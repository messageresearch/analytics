[0:00] trillions a day that you've created us
[0:02] you've placed Us in it
[0:05] so happy and thankful Lord
[0:09] that you've given us this day Lord we
[0:11] thank you this morning Father for you
[0:14] ministering to every heart every soul
[0:17] and every life
[0:20] father we've come to the service here
[0:22] this evening and we need you one more
[0:26] time Lord I
[0:28] feel scattered and
[0:30] need you Lord to come and take over my
[0:33] mind and my thoughts and
[0:35] may it not be a man that speaks tonight
[0:37] but may you speak lip to ear to Every
[0:40] Soul here Lord we believe that you can
[0:43] provide something
[0:45] for everyone tonight you're that God you
[0:47] broke the bread Lord and you fed five
[0:49] thousand
[0:51] fish bread fetus again tonight Lord
[0:54] father as we look into your word we ask
[0:56] Lord that you would help us now father
[0:59] to find your mind and to move quickly
[1:01] aside in we ask it now in the precious
[1:05] name of our Lord and savior
[1:07] Jesus Christ can you say Amen this
[1:09] evening
[1:10] and God bless you it's certainly uh good
[1:12] to been here I told Brother Paul I said
[1:15] sometimes going somewhere else to church
[1:17] is like a vacation to a pastor it's good
[1:21] to go and see other people and and to
[1:23] realize that you're not the only one in
[1:24] the battle because the devil certainly
[1:26] tries to make you think that you're the
[1:28] only one you're the Lone Ranger in the
[1:30] battle and but there's um one thing I
[1:34] found that we all are in a battle
[1:36] together can you see me and we're all
[1:38] fighting the same same enemy you might
[1:40] be fighting it North I'm fighting in the
[1:42] South but we're fighting it to be able
[1:44] to go home thank you that will be all
[1:46] the music I I leave the singing up to my
[1:48] wife I'm not the best singer in the
[1:50] world I try sometimes but then I think I
[1:53] fail maybe I just need to practice more
[1:55] and I might be all right I can sort of
[1:58] carry a tune but I'm not a great singer
[2:00] I don't even think I'm a good preacher I
[2:02] certainly I've told the church I said I
[2:04] wouldn't have called me to preach the
[2:06] gospel you know if I could have chose a
[2:08] gift it would have been singing I would
[2:10] if God said which gift do you own I said
[2:12] I want to sing but we don't get to
[2:14] choose those things we gifts and
[2:17] callings are without repentance Joshua
[2:19] chapter 1 verses one through nine I
[2:22] don't want to take up too much of your
[2:23] time I want to move straight to the word
[2:24] of God I want to take a little thought
[2:27] something that I've been meditating for
[2:28] a while and
[2:30] just asking the Lord I knew it was going
[2:31] to be a youth median it's going to be
[2:34] really simple tonight but
[2:36] I don't know why we're going this way
[2:37] but we're we're living in an hour that
[2:41] that we have to know him more than
[2:43] anything else because that's the only
[2:45] thing that's going to stand can you say
[2:48] Amen to that Joshua chapter 1 verses 1
[2:51] through 9 it says now after the death of
[2:54] Moses the servant of the Lord it came to
[2:57] pass that Joshua that the Lord rather
[2:59] spake unto Joshua the son of nun Moses
[3:03] Minister saying Moses my servant is dead
[3:07] now therefore arise and go over this
[3:09] Jordan
[3:10] thou and all this people into the land
[3:13] which I do give to them
[3:15] even to the children of Israel every
[3:18] place that the soul of your foot shall
[3:20] tread that have I given unto you as I
[3:24] said unto Moses now notice what he's
[3:27] doing he's reminding him of the prophet
[3:30] in his words but it's not going to stay
[3:33] right there it's going somewhere else
[3:36] from the wilderness
[3:38] and this Lebanon
[3:40] and to the Great River the river
[3:42] Euphrates and all the land of the
[3:44] Hittites and into the great sea toward
[3:46] the going down of the sun shall be your
[3:49] Coast there shall not any man be able to
[3:52] stand before thee all the days of thy
[3:55] life
[3:55] now I like this part as I was with Moses
[4:00] so will I be with thee
[4:03] I will not fail thee nor forsake thee
[4:08] I like what he gives him the
[4:10] encouragement he says be strong and of a
[4:13] good courage
[4:15] For unto this people shalt out divide
[4:18] for an inheritance the lamb which I
[4:20] swear unto their fathers to give them
[4:23] only be thou strong and very courageous
[4:26] that thou mayest observe to do according
[4:29] to all the law which Moses my servant
[4:32] commanded thee turn not from it to the
[4:36] right hand nor to the left
[4:38] that thou mayest Prosper with orsoever
[4:41] thou goest
[4:43] this book of the law shall not depart
[4:45] out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate
[4:48] therein day and night that thou must
[4:50] observe to do according to all that is
[4:53] written therein for then shall thou make
[4:56] thy way prosperous young person if you
[4:58] want to be prosperous listen to what the
[5:00] word is saying and then shall then Thou
[5:03] shalt have good success I love what he
[5:06] says to him he says have not I commanded
[5:09] thee be strong and of a good courage Be
[5:12] not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for
[5:15] the Lord thy God is with thee whether so
[5:18] ever
[5:19] thou goest Heavenly Father Lord we
[5:23] one more time approach you we have read
[5:25] your word and
[5:27] we need to know what you once said
[5:29] tonight so we're surrendering I'm laying
[5:31] my nervousness aside my thoughts aside
[5:34] and asking you to take over this body
[5:36] and take over these thoughts and may you
[5:38] speak what you once spoke tonight Father
[5:41] for I am helpless I am just a mutant
[5:43] like a microphone that has no one to
[5:46] speak through it Lord I could say some
[5:47] things and it might would be of a help
[5:50] but I'm not interested in me speaking
[5:52] and being to help I want you to come and
[5:55] I want you to be the help tonight father
[5:57] meet the need as you said you would in
[5:59] Jesus Christ's name we ask you
[6:02] amen God bless you may be seated I want
[6:05] to take just a real simple thought this
[6:07] evening and be conscious of time here
[6:09] but if I could give it a title it's just
[6:11] something that the Lord put on my heart
[6:13] of accepting
[6:14] the commission
[6:16] accepting the commission
[6:19] and I begin to look at the life of
[6:21] Joshua and I looked up the word accept
[6:23] it means to receive willingly to be able
[6:27] or designed to take a hold of something
[6:30] so in other words if you're going to
[6:31] accept it if if it's been given then
[6:35] that means you have the ability to grasp
[6:37] it you have the ability to take hold of
[6:39] it the word commission means an
[6:41] authorization or a command to act in a
[6:44] prescribed manner or to perform a
[6:46] prescribed Acts or it's a charge or an
[6:49] authority to act for in behalf of or in
[6:52] the place of another now remember he
[6:54] said as I was with Moses so will I be
[6:58] with thee and so to receive this command
[7:02] means that to accept it means that that
[7:04] Joshua had to be willing to take a hold
[7:07] of something Joshua had to be able to
[7:09] say you know what you're talking to me
[7:12] and I'm going to take a hold of it
[7:14] before we maybe this evening just look
[7:16] at the commission we want to um back up
[7:19] for just a minute just um Joshua and his
[7:22] life maybe some inspiration I'm not a
[7:25] Storyteller but we're going to attempt
[7:27] by inspiration just to look at a few
[7:29] things and the Bible says it don't say
[7:31] much about Joshua I think it's number 17
[7:34] I believe it is or Exodus one of those
[7:37] books 17 and verse 9 is the first place
[7:39] you really find the word Joshua you you
[7:41] find him mentioned but it says that he
[7:44] was born the son of none so we know he
[7:46] was born he was born in Hebrew and he
[7:48] was born into captivity he was born into
[7:51] slavery so he was birthed into something
[7:54] that he didn't have a choice to be
[7:56] birthed into are you with me so in other
[7:58] words he was born but he was born for a
[8:01] purpose
[8:02] he God God had allowed this boy to be
[8:05] born for a particular reason and I want
[8:07] you to think about it young person as
[8:09] we're going through this tonight you
[8:11] just wasn't born to be born but you were
[8:13] born for a purpose you were born for a
[8:16] reason and the only person that can
[8:19] reveal that purpose to you God might use
[8:22] your pastor God might use a minister but
[8:25] it's going to take God himself revealing
[8:28] that purpose to you nobody else can you
[8:31] know you can say well brother so and so
[8:33] told me this or mama told me this or
[8:35] daddy told me this that's fine and good
[8:37] but it still comes back to God telling
[8:41] you what your purpose is
[8:43] are you with me this evening and I
[8:45] thought about maybe as a child if we
[8:48] could just go back into the life of
[8:49] Joshua's a child at night maybe after a
[8:53] long hard day of slavery and he'd
[8:55] watched his mom and dad and they were
[8:57] beaten with with whips and they were
[8:59] maybe bloody and they were bruised and
[9:02] they would come in and and and even
[9:04] though they were tired what little
[9:06] supper they had they would eat and right
[9:08] before they went to bed they began to
[9:10] talk about well you know in the word God
[9:12] promised us a deliverer he said that one
[9:15] day he was going to ascend and deliver
[9:17] and Deliver Us From This Bitter bondage
[9:20] and this had gone on year after year
[9:23] after year but sometimes
[9:27] it falls upon the right ears at the
[9:30] right time and the right moment when God
[9:33] is allowing something to transpire it
[9:36] falls upon the ears that's there for a
[9:39] purpose and so Joshua we begin to listen
[9:42] to these stories over and over him and
[9:45] he began he begin to maybe imagine well
[9:47] what's that deliver going to be like him
[9:49] and who is Jehovah anyway I've heard Mom
[9:52] and Dad talk about him and that he's
[9:54] going to send this one but as he grew he
[9:56] heard the promise over and over and over
[9:59] you know how sometimes we sit in church
[10:01] and we'll hear it over and over and over
[10:04] and over and we really just don't get it
[10:09] and we get upset because well I I'm not
[10:12] understanding don't worry about it
[10:15] it's there for a purpose and there for a
[10:18] reason and I can listen to his thoughts
[10:21] now as a as a boy and as he may be grew
[10:24] into his teenage years he said well you
[10:26] know I've heard that deliver thing all
[10:28] of my life I've heard that God is going
[10:31] to sin to deliver but when I'm watching
[10:33] Mom and Dad's health breakdown and I'm
[10:35] there ain't nothing happening around
[10:37] here and I I don't like where I'm at I
[10:39] don't like the situation that I'm in so
[10:41] when is God going to sin to deliver will
[10:44] he ever actually come in my lifetime
[10:46] will I ever actually see it or is this
[10:49] something that I'm going to get old and
[10:50] I'm going to repeat to my children
[10:54] is Jehovah even real if God loved us how
[10:58] can he let us suffer the way he suffers
[11:01] you know we all ask that at times we all
[11:03] get a little offended at God we get
[11:05] upset well if you really love me then
[11:07] why is it this way why is it that way
[11:10] but see God don't always tell you
[11:12] everything sometimes he withholds
[11:15] himself because there's a reason and a
[11:18] purpose for that
[11:20] if he was really real then how could we
[11:23] be where we're at today
[11:27] you might be asking yourself well
[11:29] everything's in a mess right now
[11:32] everybody's leaving everybody's doing
[11:34] this no everything is right on time
[11:37] there's nothing out of order with God
[11:41] but one day I can see Joshua maybe he he
[11:45] he
[11:47] maybe he's seen Moses
[11:49] and maybe he heard the story well yeah
[11:53] Moses there's something different about
[11:55] him he's going to be our deliverer he's
[11:56] going to one he's going to deliver us
[11:58] and he wants him and he hears the story
[12:00] where he kills one Egyptian and they say
[12:02] well praise the Lord this is it Jehovah
[12:04] is going to deliver us
[12:07] and the next thing you know oh he hid
[12:09] his body in the sand
[12:11] see Joshua
[12:14] has heard these things over and over and
[12:16] over
[12:17] but he's liking something he's lacking a
[12:20] reality he's missing something in his
[12:23] life everything that he was hearing
[12:25] everything that he was looking at was
[12:27] true
[12:28] but he himself wasn't liking something
[12:31] he was he was needing something and so
[12:34] then he hears how Moses well Moses got
[12:37] sent out to the backside he ran he got
[12:39] run out through the desert and there's
[12:41] no way he could have survived I thought
[12:43] he was this you know young person it's
[12:45] when you think it's this it's never
[12:48] really that
[12:49] are you with me it's when you think it's
[12:51] this it's never really that just ask
[12:54] some of these adults that's a little bit
[12:55] older we haven't figured out it ain't
[12:57] the way we thought it was supposed to be
[12:59] well I'm so disappointed brother to him
[13:02] well join the crowd who hasn't had
[13:04] disappointment who thought we was going
[13:06] to stay here this long we thought the
[13:08] Lord was coming but nonetheless he's
[13:11] still coming
[13:12] and you're here young person for a
[13:14] reason and for a purpose God has placed
[13:18] you here
[13:19] and and you know life was difficult for
[13:22] him if there was no end inside him and
[13:25] then maybe one day as Joshua was going
[13:27] down to the pit and he was working all
[13:29] of a sudden he gets some unexpected news
[13:31] hey Moses is still alive and and now
[13:34] Moses has come back with the message and
[13:36] he's talking to the king and he says let
[13:39] my people go
[13:41] Joshua was like oh I've heard all that
[13:43] before
[13:45] there's been other deliveries that's
[13:47] raised up
[13:48] who is this Prophet with a message
[13:51] kind of sound familiar don't a prophet
[13:53] and a message
[13:56] but in in the ending of Exodus chapter
[13:59] 12
[14:00] Joshua finds himself following a prophet
[14:03] up out of Egypt
[14:06] and and we find in Exodus 17 I want you
[14:09] to listen now he finds himself receiving
[14:12] and following the instructions of a
[14:15] prophet Without Really knowing what it's
[14:18] about
[14:19] because he could see God in this man's
[14:22] life
[14:22] and he knew if he just did what he said
[14:25] it was going to work out but that wasn't
[14:27] where God was taking Joshua God wasn't
[14:30] leaving Joshua at the prophet he was
[14:33] taking him for a purpose he had called
[14:35] him for a specific reason
[14:38] and he finds him under the inspiration
[14:40] and the instructions of this prophet and
[14:43] he finds himself winning battles he
[14:45] knows I'm going to follow this message
[14:47] because that's pretty good it works it's
[14:50] worked out pretty good so far so I'm
[14:51] going to follow the message of the hour
[14:55] but now watch
[14:57] Joshua
[14:59] God had Joshua in mind for something
[15:02] very specific
[15:06] because God came to Moses
[15:09] and he said Moses write this in a book
[15:12] of Memorial and rehearse it in Joshua's
[15:16] ears
[15:18] so in other words it just wasn't about
[15:20] Mo Joshua fall in a prophet but God was
[15:25] trying to do something very specific
[15:27] with this young man he had a purpose he
[15:30] had caught him to a place Joshua we
[15:32] didn't understand it but he said record
[15:35] this in a book Moses and you rehearse it
[15:38] over and over in the ears of Joshua
[15:42] I thought about how maybe Joshua didn't
[15:44] catch it right then but what was
[15:47] happening when Moses said now Joshua
[15:49] what God told me to tell you this God
[15:52] was not established in a relationship
[15:55] between Moses and Joshua but he was
[15:58] reestablished in a relationship between
[16:00] Joshua and himself
[16:03] because he knew there was coming a time
[16:05] when Moses would go off the scene he
[16:08] knew there was coming a time that Joshua
[16:10] was going to be nor than just the
[16:12] message that God sent him a prophet are
[16:14] you with me now Joshua had the fortunate
[16:17] experience that he was there and
[16:19] experienced it but many of us today
[16:21] never have
[16:23] are you with me now
[16:25] Exodus 24 and verse 13 in other words
[16:28] God was bringing this thing real
[16:30] personal to Joshua it says in Moses rose
[16:34] up and his minister or his servant or
[16:37] his attendant Joshua and Moses went up
[16:40] into the Mountain of God so watch God
[16:43] has already spoken to Moses to speak to
[16:46] Joshua but now he's still here he's
[16:48] still following this prophet
[16:51] wonderful are you with me still
[16:53] following this Prophet Now put on your
[16:55] spiritual thinking caps whatever Moses
[16:58] spoke he followed it without
[16:59] understanding
[17:01] sometimes blindly
[17:05] Joshua went up with Moses and waited as
[17:09] God gave the instructions or gave the
[17:11] word now watch this he recognized that
[17:14] Moses was God's chosen Prophet because
[17:17] of the signs of a prophet was Vindicated
[17:20] before his eyes
[17:22] and to receive a prophet is to receive
[17:25] God
[17:27] John 13 and 20 says verily verily I say
[17:30] unto you he that receiveth whomsoever I
[17:32] sin receiveth me and he that receiveth
[17:35] me receiveth him that sent me
[17:38] but now watch this in Exodus 32 and 1
[17:42] we're going to place here with us in
[17:44] just a minute
[17:45] it says and when the people saw that
[17:47] Moses was delayed to come out of the
[17:49] mount
[17:50] in other words Moses had gone off the
[17:53] scene
[17:54] and all of a sudden there was a bunch of
[17:57] murmuring
[17:58] and complaining
[18:00] we don't even know what happened to
[18:02] Moses
[18:03] we don't even know if Moses was a
[18:05] prophet now
[18:06] we thought we were going to the promised
[18:09] land but here we are
[18:10] we'd have been better off if we'd stayed
[18:12] in Egypt
[18:13] we'd been better off if we stayed with
[18:15] what we believed
[18:18] if he'd have been a real prophet he
[18:20] wouldn't have struck the rock twice
[18:24] listen young people if you hadn't heard
[18:26] it you're going to hear things in the
[18:27] next few years you're going to hear
[18:29] things that's going to rock your world
[18:31] and you've got to have your ship
[18:32] stabilized
[18:34] are you with me
[18:38] Moses he's just a liar and a deceiver
[18:41] he's a false prophet
[18:43] well he was wrong here so he's got to be
[18:45] wrong over there
[18:48] oh my
[18:50] you know what I just think we've been
[18:51] following an occult all these years
[18:54] mom and dad they're cuckoo after all
[18:56] these years
[18:59] listen now
[19:02] I'm tired of a bunch of rules
[19:05] but your laws a bunch of regulations
[19:10] think about it
[19:12] let us get a captain
[19:14] let's let somebody lead us back
[19:19] well Moses is just a hypocrite he told
[19:21] us not to kill and he killed an Egyptian
[19:28] we don't need him anymore
[19:32] Moses had a temper if he was a real
[19:34] prophet of God he wouldn't even have
[19:36] that
[19:39] do you know what young people
[19:42] those murmurs and complainers and
[19:44] groaners were doing
[19:46] they were following a prophet
[19:49] they were not following the God that was
[19:52] working through
[19:54] the prophet
[19:55] are you with me now
[19:57] listen this very thing is repeating
[20:00] itself
[20:01] it's here today where oh we don't need
[20:03] this and we don't need that we've missed
[20:06] the point
[20:08] I want to get you a quote here in just a
[20:10] minute something that brother Branham
[20:12] said that just stirred my soul
[20:15] but for Joshua it wasn't just about a
[20:18] prophet
[20:19] it wasn't just about a connection
[20:23] let me drop something in here you know
[20:26] David was a young man before he was King
[20:30] he had a relationship
[20:32] with Jehovah
[20:35] he had a relationship before God sent
[20:38] him a prophet
[20:40] you know the difference between David
[20:42] and Saul young person
[20:45] Saul had a connection to Jehovah through
[20:48] a prophet
[20:50] but he never had a relationship
[20:54] and when all of that was pulled back
[20:56] from Saul he didn't know what to do
[20:59] because he didn't know the god of Samuel
[21:03] there's a difference between having a
[21:05] connection to something and actually
[21:07] having a relationship with it
[21:11] David didn't have a connection he had
[21:13] relationship
[21:15] so then when God took Samuel off the
[21:18] scene he had the words of Samuel but he
[21:21] had God also
[21:23] that's what established David through
[21:25] his trials through his mistakes when
[21:27] those walked away from David when those
[21:29] forsook David
[21:32] he still had his God
[21:35] oh my think about it
[21:38] for Joshua it wasn't unnecessarily about
[21:41] a prophet though he adhered to the
[21:43] prophet though he listened to the
[21:45] prophet
[21:46] he respected Moses and the instructions
[21:49] that was given by Moses but his eyes
[21:52] wasn't really on Moses
[21:56] if you get your eyes on your pastor he's
[21:59] going to disappoint you
[22:01] he's going to fail you
[22:04] because he's human
[22:06] but if you can ever see the god working
[22:09] through him
[22:10] and ever understand that through the
[22:12] Frailty of human flesh that God lives
[22:15] and dwells and moves and has his being
[22:18] then he can really help you I want you
[22:21] to think about this Joshua was there
[22:24] when the Red Sea was opened
[22:27] Joshua was there when the Egyptians
[22:30] drowned
[22:31] Joshua was there when Mary picked up the
[22:35] tambourine and began to dance because
[22:36] she had been delivered from the enemy
[22:39] he was there he had seen it he was there
[22:42] when Manna fell out of heaven
[22:45] he partook of it he knew what it tastes
[22:48] like Joshua was there when the earth
[22:50] swallowed up opened up and swallowed the
[22:52] rebels because they disbelieved Moses
[22:55] and his message
[22:57] Joshua was there when they were fussing
[22:59] about the doctrine of Moses
[23:02] listen young people let me tell you
[23:04] something from somebody that's becoming
[23:05] an old man don't ever argue about the
[23:08] truth
[23:09] leave it alone let God deal with you on
[23:12] it he'll take care of it you don't have
[23:15] to worry about rightly dividing it you
[23:17] let the holy spirit in your life rightly
[23:19] divide the word of Truth to you
[23:22] are you with me
[23:24] oh my
[23:28] he was there when they said well Moses
[23:30] didn't really mean that
[23:33] or he actually meant this
[23:36] Joshua heard it all
[23:38] but remember
[23:40] he said
[23:42] Moses
[23:43] write this
[23:45] in a book of Memorial
[23:47] and rehearse it
[23:49] and Joshua's ears
[23:54] just wasn't a connection but it was
[23:56] something that was very personal to
[24:00] Joshua
[24:03] are you with me
[24:05] now watch this I want to show you that
[24:07] he had this connection in Exodus and 33
[24:11] in a couple verses there
[24:13] one place it says that Moses because of
[24:16] certain things it came to pass that he
[24:19] took the Tabernacle and he put it
[24:21] outside he put it outside the Tabernacle
[24:25] we put it outside of the camp and
[24:26] anybody that went to seek the Lord had
[24:29] to go outside of a camp
[24:31] to actually find him
[24:34] in other words they had to go away from
[24:36] their own thinking to actually find him
[24:39] one time Moses went into the Tabernacle
[24:42] and come out to the people but the Bible
[24:44] said Joshua departed not
[24:47] from the Tabernacle why God was
[24:50] established in himself to Joshua now
[24:54] why because he had a commission for
[24:56] Joshua would it take a hold of he had
[24:58] something that Joshua was going to do
[25:01] now everything that Joshua had heard all
[25:04] his life was starting to make sense
[25:09] Joshua was willing to go outside of
[25:11] theology Joshua was willing to go
[25:14] outside of a doctrinal camp Joshua could
[25:17] see God in Moses but he needed more than
[25:20] that
[25:22] you can see God in your pastor you can
[25:25] see God in your mother but you must see
[25:27] God in yourself
[25:30] are you with me you must see God in you
[25:32] young person
[25:35] oh my
[25:37] God see God was not established in a
[25:40] connection
[25:41] to himself through a prophet
[25:44] he was establishing a relationship with
[25:48] Joshua
[25:50] so that when God changed the mask
[25:54] Joshua we wouldn't get thrown away he
[25:56] wouldn't get thrown off in the
[25:58] wilderness he wouldn't he wouldn't he
[26:00] wouldn't find himself well I don't even
[26:01] know if it's true I don't even know what
[26:03] to believe
[26:10] think about it
[26:12] I want to read you a quote
[26:14] listen to what brother Branham says and
[26:16] it's in the Ephesian Church age
[26:19] he said Revelations chapter 2 and verse
[26:22] 4 he says nevertheless I have somewhat
[26:25] against thee
[26:26] because thou has left thy first love
[26:30] now listen when I read this I got a
[26:32] little excited about it he said to
[26:34] understand this you must realize that
[26:37] the spirit is not speaking to the
[26:39] original Saints at Ephesus alone
[26:43] the messages is to the entire age which
[26:46] lasted about 120 years now he didn't
[26:49] leave it there listen to what he says
[26:51] it's a message then is to all
[26:54] generations in that span and he says Now
[26:57] history keeps repeating itself
[27:05] we've got young people that's been born
[27:08] along this Wilderness Journey
[27:10] we've got young people that's heard
[27:12] fussing and fight over the message
[27:15] fighting over Doctrine
[27:18] and they're like what's that about
[27:21] I need to know if Jesus loves me
[27:28] you know what I found as a pastor here
[27:31] in the last five years I preached enough
[27:33] funerals now to realize that what's
[27:35] going to take you across the river do
[27:37] you know the person
[27:39] amen
[27:41] he's good right
[27:43] I watched people let go of their fights
[27:46] I let people go go of their beliefs
[27:51] because you have to know him
[27:55] to cross
[27:58] listen to what he says now
[28:02] he said history keeps repeating itself
[28:06] in the generations of Israel we see
[28:09] Revival in one generation only to see
[28:12] the fires fading in the next
[28:16] in the third generation's Embers may be
[28:19] glowing slightly but in the fourth
[28:22] generation there being maybe no Vestige
[28:26] whatsoever of the original Flame
[28:29] think about it
[28:31] down four generations deep
[28:35] I'm looking at a fourth generation
[28:38] since God sent a prophet
[28:41] I'm looking at four generations deep
[28:45] this is my heart this evening this is
[28:47] where I'm at when I'm I'm looking out
[28:49] I'm looking at four generations deep I
[28:52] look at myself my father was there in
[28:55] 1960 and brother branham's meetings
[28:57] there was brother Branham there was my
[28:58] father there was me and now here's my
[29:00] children and my grandchildren
[29:04] they've got to have a part of the
[29:06] original fire
[29:09] it's not coming in and putting her name
[29:12] on a mineral young person but it's
[29:15] experiencing a part of the original fire
[29:19] shouting's good speaking in tongues is
[29:22] good I believe in everybody I've
[29:23] experienced all of the nine spiritual
[29:26] gifts but you can experience every bit
[29:29] of those and still not have the fire
[29:33] are you with me you can experience all
[29:35] of it and still not have the fire oh I
[29:39] like this he said in the fourth there
[29:41] may be no Vestige whatsoever of the
[29:43] original flame he said but then God
[29:47] are you with me it's not God coming to a
[29:50] prophet to you but it's God himself
[29:53] right Elites the original fire again
[29:56] back into the church
[29:58] there's a generation that's going to
[30:00] raise up they ain't going to fuss they
[30:02] ain't gonna fight they ain't have an old
[30:04] fighter spirit because all they know is
[30:06] what Joshua has revealed to them they
[30:09] ain't gonna worry about was there a
[30:11] bridge ain't gonna worry about was there
[30:13] a bear they ain't gonna worry about this
[30:15] ain't gonna worry about that because God
[30:17] has reserved them for the fourth
[30:19] generation why because we're approaching
[30:22] the coming of the lord it's a dark hour
[30:24] in which we're living and if it's dark
[30:27] there then there's a fire that's greater
[30:29] than the darkness
[30:31] I said there's a fire that's greater
[30:33] than the darkness God himself listen
[30:35] man's Ministry is done
[30:39] are you with me
[30:41] listen young person you respect the
[30:43] ministers but you'll be looking for God
[30:46] through that minister
[30:48] that's the only thing that's going to
[30:50] light your fire I can't light my young
[30:52] people's fire at home but I want to
[30:55] preach the gospel in such a way that it
[30:57] becomes a reality to where it's just not
[31:00] God's in a prophet it's not this
[31:02] Doctrine and we believe X and we believe
[31:04] why and we believe Z I told the young
[31:07] people at home I said the devil believes
[31:09] that also but what he cannot produce is
[31:12] the life the fire of God
[31:15] [Music]
[31:17] you know as well as our older folks that
[31:20] what their young people are facing today
[31:22] is a greater challenge than what we
[31:24] faced
[31:26] are you with me
[31:28] it's a greater challenge today than it
[31:30] was back then
[31:33] he said in the fourth generation that
[31:36] God lights the fire again and the same
[31:39] process is repeated
[31:42] it's simply the manifestation of the
[31:44] truth that God has no grandchildren
[31:49] okay
[31:51] just because your mom and dad believes
[31:54] the message just because your grandpa
[31:55] leaves the mess believes the message
[31:57] that ain't got nothing to do with it
[32:01] it's got to be a fire lit on the inside
[32:03] of you
[32:05] it's got to be the original fire the
[32:08] acts 238 the Pentecostal
[32:11] I hope that ain't a dirty word around
[32:13] here
[32:14] listen pick the cost if you don't have
[32:17] Pentecost in your life we don't have it
[32:21] I ain't talking about Pentecostal isms
[32:24] but what happened in Acts 2 38 was what
[32:27] was called Pentecost it's when God set
[32:30] the fire in the church and that's the
[32:32] pattern hereafter
[32:37] listen I taught my children you asked my
[32:40] two older ones it's a home I taught them
[32:42] and I'm teaching Samuel about the life
[32:44] of the prophet and about the exports of
[32:46] God through him but I said you've got to
[32:48] have the same relationship that he had
[32:51] because God don't have no grandbabies in
[32:53] this I love my grandbabies now I love
[32:56] holding my little boy my little girl but
[32:58] I realize they born in sin they shaping
[33:00] an iniquity and they're going to have to
[33:02] they're gonna have to have a birth are
[33:04] you with me
[33:06] they're gonna have to be born again just
[33:08] like we did you know what I find
[33:10] sometimes old people ain't never been
[33:11] born again
[33:16] settled into a belief structure
[33:19] settled into a belief I did when God
[33:21] comes along and tries to move us we just
[33:23] like
[33:25] foreign
[33:27] I've been believing this for 40 years
[33:30] now
[33:31] what can you tell me
[33:34] see Joshua wasn't like that
[33:39] Joshua found his alone time with his God
[33:43] he was still listening to the ministry
[33:46] but something was happening with Joshua
[33:49] there was a fire that was getting lit
[33:51] inside Joshua
[33:54] he said salvation is not passed on by
[33:57] the natural birth any more than this
[33:59] truth to Apostolic succession it isn't
[34:03] in the word he said you start out with
[34:04] truly born-again Believers and the Next
[34:07] Generation comes along and there are no
[34:09] longer just plain Christians but they
[34:12] have taken a denominational name and now
[34:15] are Baptist
[34:18] can I say something to be okay
[34:21] I'm going to anyway
[34:23] if you don't have me back you're okay I
[34:24] love you anyway
[34:26] we've taken the name of message
[34:28] believers
[34:29] but what is a message believer
[34:33] what is a message believer
[34:40] somebody tell me what is a message
[34:42] believer
[34:44] listen
[34:46] Methodist and brother Bram says Etc
[34:50] he said that's exactly what they are to
[34:52] they aren't Christians
[34:55] [Music]
[34:57] watch now after the death of Moses
[35:02] the servant of the Lord it came to pass
[35:05] that the Lord spake
[35:08] directly
[35:10] and to Joshua
[35:15] he spake one-on-one to Joshua now
[35:23] well I need the preacher to speak to me
[35:26] maybe God wants you to get a loan
[35:29] and get quiet
[35:31] and let him speak to you
[35:37] that Moses my servant is there now
[35:39] therefore arise and go over this Jordan
[35:44] Joshua could have said well
[35:46] I'm not capable of doing it I'm not old
[35:49] enough to do it
[35:51] what do I do God says I just need you to
[35:54] listen to me
[35:56] I need you to rise
[35:59] and I need you to take the commission
[36:01] that I've given you
[36:06] see it was no longer with somebody else
[36:08] young person
[36:10] it was with him personally now
[36:13] he had accepted the commission
[36:17] well
[36:19] God can't lie
[36:22] I I I I've seen him with Moses and
[36:26] he says I'll be with you now
[36:31] I'll be with you as I was
[36:33] with Moses
[36:37] now watch what he says
[36:39] in verse 3 he says every place that the
[36:42] soul of your mama's foot shall tread
[36:47] every place that your daddy's foot is
[36:50] going to tread
[36:52] your pastor's foot
[36:54] the prophet's foot brother Brown's foot
[37:00] I told the church a while back I said we
[37:02] can identify Malachi 4 5 and 6 we can
[37:05] identify the who the Lord was we can
[37:07] identify the messenger but can you
[37:09] identify the you in that picture
[37:13] he was sent for a very specific reason
[37:19] there shall not be any man to be able to
[37:21] stand before thee all the days of the
[37:24] life as I was with Moses so will I be
[37:28] with thee I will not fail thee
[37:33] nor forsake thee
[37:38] in other words it just wasn't contained
[37:41] somewhere else
[37:43] but it was now very personal
[37:45] was Joshua because he said I accept
[37:49] I received this thing it's no longer
[37:51] just a figment of my imagination now
[37:55] I want to give you a a story here for
[37:58] just a minute I won't be too much longer
[38:00] I want to give you a story of a of a
[38:03] young man who who grew up in the message
[38:05] if I can say it that way and and it's
[38:08] like I said this morning I believe the
[38:09] message and I believe the messenger
[38:11] there ain't nothing wrong with any of
[38:13] that
[38:16] but young person I'm going to tell you
[38:18] something God has to walk off the pages
[38:21] of the Bible God has to walk off of a
[38:24] quote and has to walk down into your
[38:27] life
[38:29] or guess what's going to happen there's
[38:31] going to be a Vortex that comes along a
[38:33] tornado and just sucks you right out and
[38:35] you're gonna be like well I thought
[38:38] I thought I believed
[38:41] what did you believe really
[38:46] did you believe in him or did you
[38:48] believe in an idea did you believe in a
[38:50] theology did you believe in something
[38:52] way out here
[38:56] there was a young man that was raised in
[38:59] the message that all of his life and
[39:02] he listened to it and he heard every
[39:05] Doctrine coming and going
[39:08] he didn't even know what to believe
[39:09] anymore
[39:11] he's like was it I don't even know if
[39:13] it's true
[39:15] this was before
[39:18] it was a mass Exodus
[39:22] he don't even know what to believe
[39:24] he's got all these filters in his mind
[39:26] he's got all these ideas of what it's
[39:28] like
[39:31] and he's like well well what do I really
[39:34] believe
[39:36] um
[39:36] well I I I know they've said he's a
[39:39] prophet but is he really a prophet I
[39:40] mean I've heard and I know people that's
[39:43] been in those meetings
[39:46] but
[39:48] see God is the butt Destroyer
[39:52] he's the one that wants to answer all
[39:55] your questions he wants to take you from
[39:58] a spirit of confusion
[40:00] to a spirit of clarity
[40:03] and this young man was raised him he was
[40:05] he he grew up and he believed and he did
[40:09] all the right things and he knew all the
[40:11] right sayings and he knew how to act in
[40:14] church and oh he was a believer
[40:18] outside
[40:20] but not inside
[40:24] and he had a certain filter because
[40:26] that's what Mom and Dad believed
[40:29] he had this filter and everything was
[40:31] filtered through this and this was the
[40:33] message of the hour for him
[40:38] and he got up he got older and he got
[40:40] married
[40:41] and he started having children
[40:44] and he was like
[40:45] hmm
[40:47] I'm not so sure anymore
[40:50] I heard what Mom and Dad said but
[40:55] I don't know I just
[40:57] I'm a little confused
[41:00] what do I do
[41:02] and then one day
[41:04] he gets tired of the confusion
[41:07] one day he he grabs a a a a player
[41:13] and grab some MP3s
[41:16] he says I'm going to figure this thing
[41:18] out for myself
[41:22] and he says you know I I I don't know
[41:25] what's true
[41:26] I don't know what really to believe
[41:30] but Lord I believe that this is your
[41:33] voice
[41:34] to me
[41:35] he did have enough sense to say that
[41:39] and he said I don't have a filter
[41:41] I don't have a doctoral filter but I
[41:44] want you to reveal you to me
[41:47] are you with me he'd heard of God of a
[41:50] prophet he'd seen God in Mom and Dad but
[41:53] he didn't know God for himself
[41:55] are you with me he didn't know that God
[41:57] he was wondering where is the god of
[42:00] Elijah where is the god do I read the
[42:02] Bible he we read the Bible and we see
[42:05] that the god that does all these things
[42:06] that God's still supposed to be in the
[42:08] church but he's not seeing him
[42:11] what he's seen is a bunch of fussing and
[42:13] fighting out of what's supposed to be
[42:15] mature adults but they're immature and
[42:18] they separate over Doctrine it won't
[42:19] speak to each other for 30 years
[42:22] and he's like there's something wrong
[42:24] with this picture
[42:26] and he begins to have a Joshua
[42:29] experience
[42:30] he begins to listen for himself
[42:35] and all of a sudden
[42:37] hears a story of a
[42:40] of a woman that drops dead a city block
[42:43] away
[42:45] and brother branham's media and says she
[42:47] said if I die take me on through the
[42:50] prayer line anyway
[42:52] and so The Story Goes brother Brandon
[42:54] related how that how that she was
[42:57] brought through the prayer line and God
[42:59] raised her from the dead
[43:02] this young man that said I'll serve a
[43:05] god like that where is that God
[43:08] are you with me not the god of Doctrine
[43:10] we got to have the right teaching
[43:11] instruction but we can have all that and
[43:13] never know that he's real never know
[43:15] that he's alive
[43:17] never know that there's a generation
[43:19] that's going on or you understand that's
[43:21] had the power of God in it but it must
[43:23] become reality to the Next Generation
[43:30] and he starts crying
[43:32] he says Lord that is not fair to me
[43:37] don't ever tell God something ain't Fair
[43:40] that's not fair you took that gift off
[43:43] the scene
[43:44] five years before I was born if I had a
[43:47] button I would go back and push that
[43:49] button so I could see that
[43:52] why because inside of every human being
[43:55] they want to know the reality of true
[43:58] power
[44:01] and he's sitting here and he's crying
[44:03] he's weeping because where is that God
[44:09] and he says hey
[44:11] listen to me
[44:13] I've got a commission if you'll accept
[44:15] it will you take it
[44:20] and the voice speaks to him and says I
[44:23] have a question for you
[44:25] where was her faith
[44:28] anchored
[44:32] because this young man was wanting to
[44:33] see a God that was alive
[44:35] not a god of teaching not of God
[44:38] contained in a Pulpit but a God who
[44:40] walked down the aisles a God who walked
[44:43] in the home a God who walked at work
[44:47] are you with me
[44:49] I thought that when he would call he
[44:51] would answer
[44:53] he didn't know if he was existing or not
[44:58] and that young man says I I don't know
[45:02] where Faith was anchored
[45:05] and the Holy Spirit speaks back to him
[45:08] and says her faith was anchored
[45:12] in a risen savior
[45:14] working through a submitted vessel
[45:18] I am Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[45:21] today and forever
[45:25] and in the instant
[45:28] he became a True Believer
[45:32] you see that was me
[45:34] I was raised
[45:38] mom and dad had been to the meetings
[45:40] oh I would have loved to have been there
[45:43] but God's gift is gone
[45:46] God's a god of history now
[45:48] where is this God
[45:51] from that moment I have never doubted
[45:53] him one time
[45:57] because you know what I took a
[45:59] commission
[46:01] that if you repent be baptized in the
[46:04] name of the Lord Jesus Christ you will
[46:06] receive the literal life of God himself
[46:10] it's not second-handed anymore
[46:13] it's not contained to another vessel but
[46:16] it's contained in inside of this and
[46:19] these become Oracles of God that's
[46:21] walking
[46:22] we don't listen young people you don't
[46:24] gotta wait until you're 50 to get it you
[46:26] don't got to wait until you go through
[46:28] this oh you got to say God who are you
[46:31] and where are you he says I am so glad
[46:33] you finally asked me I'm glad somebody
[46:36] asking me who I am let me show you that
[46:40] I was in the Old Testament and I am now
[46:43] in the New Testament the same God that
[46:45] was in the pillar of fire that I will be
[46:47] in you and I will dwell in you and I
[46:50] will walk in you
[46:52] and as I was with Moses as I was with
[46:55] Joshua
[46:57] as I was with brother Bynum so will I be
[47:01] with the housewife
[47:02] so will I be with the young sister that
[47:05] don't feel like she's nothing so will I
[47:08] be with you when you feel like turning
[47:10] and walking away that I am the god who
[47:13] give the message I am the god that sent
[47:15] the messenger I am the god of that
[47:18] Covenant and I am still alive today
[47:22] if it's not it's theology it's dead
[47:25] religion
[47:26] I told you this morning I ain't a
[47:28] popular preacher and I ain't afraid to
[47:30] speak the truth but God must become real
[47:33] to you tonight God must become real to
[47:36] every young person we got a generation
[47:38] that's coming now the devil's sweeping
[47:41] and taking confusing the minds and it's
[47:44] not going to be mama and daddy that
[47:46] stabilizes a ship it's going to be your
[47:49] prayer but it's going to be God himself
[47:51] stepping down into young hearts it says
[47:54] no I am still that same God I am the god
[47:58] of Elijah and you can stand when the
[48:01] whole world turns if everybody walks
[48:04] away from the message I'm going to have
[48:06] one young person that's going to stand
[48:09] and say I believe
[48:11] why because it won't be you that's doing
[48:13] the believing anymore
[48:15] it won't be you that's doing the
[48:17] believing anymore
[48:19] see when God became a reality to me I
[48:21] knew that at that point there was
[48:22] nothing that was possible nothing that
[48:24] was impossible
[48:26] where I wanted to see God I've seen him
[48:28] everywhere at that point
[48:31] I'm just going to give you testimony and
[48:33] I'm getting relieved I ain't talking
[48:34] about Tim but I'm talking about a man
[48:36] who struggled to know listen I believe
[48:40] Doctrine but I had no overcoming power
[48:43] I know coming over power over lust over
[48:45] pornography over other Devils that come
[48:47] in on my life it gave me no power when I
[48:50] said I believe God sent a prophet the
[48:52] devil laughed at me
[48:54] he said I do too he cast Me In Hell many
[48:56] times
[48:58] are you with me he wasn't afraid of
[48:59] Peter when Peter had been with Jesus but
[49:02] when Peter had the same God inside of
[49:05] him that Jesus did that was a completely
[49:08] different story
[49:10] are you with me God is giving you a
[49:13] commission not just to believe a message
[49:15] but to believe the god of the message to
[49:18] take him off the pages of the Bible and
[49:21] make him a living reality to you
[49:25] not just to say oh that was a good
[49:27] thought thank you Lord and go home and
[49:30] fight
[49:31] are you with me you're going to fight
[49:33] either way
[49:35] but if you'll let him you put some in
[49:36] your hand and you'll be able to pull the
[49:38] sword
[49:39] to say you know what I don't care what
[49:41] Devil's come
[49:43] I have not been given a spirit of fear
[49:46] but of power and of a sound mind
[49:49] and of love and you've given you the
[49:51] spirit the sword of the spirit to be
[49:53] able to cut the Devils you know
[49:55] sometimes who I'd rather have pray for
[49:57] me than I would an older person a young
[49:59] person you know why because they don't
[50:02] know anything but believe they ain't
[50:04] they don't have baggage they ain't been
[50:06] through doctrinal battles they ain't had
[50:08] scars they just know how to believe why
[50:12] because God is the reality to them
[50:16] Joshua didn't get hung up I would
[50:18] imagine him walking down he say it ain't
[50:20] gonna be too much longer we're going to
[50:21] take over now I know you've heard a lot
[50:23] of stuff we're going to cross over but
[50:25] now you need to let all that stuff go
[50:26] just know that we've been called to take
[50:29] the land
[50:34] you ain't been called to just believe a
[50:36] message
[50:37] you've been called to become the message
[50:41] you've been called for the message to
[50:43] take on a body of Flesh
[50:46] Jesus Christ is come not has 10 or will
[50:50] but is come present tense in the flesh
[50:53] see I know what it's like to not know
[50:56] who he was
[50:57] but now I know him in the power of his
[50:59] resurrection
[51:01] to a point that when the doctrine
[51:04] Medical Science tell you
[51:06] well your babies
[51:08] you little girl she's got down syndrome
[51:10] and this is going to be the problem
[51:12] that's going to be the problem
[51:14] and in the instant something inside says
[51:16] I refuse
[51:19] are you with me oh if that happened to
[51:21] me six seven years before that being
[51:23] like well I guess this is what it is
[51:25] no but God has not called you to just
[51:28] believe
[51:29] that's the first step but God has called
[51:32] you to an action when the doctor says
[51:34] well she's going to have the operation
[51:36] on her heart because she's got a hole in
[51:38] her heart
[51:39] I refuse to accept it
[51:42] you know why because he wasn't a figment
[51:45] anymore
[51:46] he was a reality to me and I knew that
[51:49] there was nothing that I've asked him
[51:52] that he would not do
[51:54] you realize that if he's that real to
[51:57] you and you ask him he said I will do it
[52:06] I will do what he says
[52:08] there is nothing that he can
[52:11] what we do sometimes we get our eyes on
[52:13] the preacher with a gift
[52:16] oh that preacher will pray for me
[52:19] but what about your prayer
[52:21] what about your prayer
[52:23] you you can enter into her infirmity
[52:25] better than I can you are about the same
[52:27] age you understand what I'm saying you
[52:28] got the same struggles the same troubles
[52:32] you see what I'm saying this isn't just
[52:34] contained to a preacher anymore it ain't
[52:36] contained to Abyss it can't contain to a
[52:38] prophet but it's to go out to the whole
[52:42] body so that it can calm the reality of
[52:45] the Flesh of God one more time
[52:51] your daughter's got a hole in her heart
[52:53] she'll have to have surgery I said I
[52:54] don't believe it well we can show you
[52:56] the exercise I don't care what the X-ray
[52:58] says
[52:59] my God said if I would ask him
[53:06] you know what I am crazy enough to
[53:08] believe
[53:08] that I might be the first individual in
[53:12] the world that God will rewrite the
[53:15] genetics of a child
[53:19] oh I can't believe that I'm going to
[53:20] take a body change and be changed in a
[53:23] moment of Twinkle and I and I can't
[53:24] believe that God can rewrite genetics
[53:29] come on now
[53:32] foreign
[53:34] you know I I when she was first born
[53:36] eight years ago I was on my way up here
[53:38] to Ohio to another church to preach and
[53:40] I got to call your daughters have to be
[53:42] transferred to Charlotte she's got this
[53:43] problem this problem you know what I did
[53:45] brother I turned my van around and I
[53:47] cleaned out my seat
[53:49] the drought the passenger side and I
[53:51] said Lord
[53:53] would you come and ride with me back to
[53:55] Charlotte
[53:58] he's not a figment
[54:00] Lord would you come and ride
[54:03] there was a being that come and sit down
[54:05] inside my beside my chair you know when
[54:08] I began to sing I felt this prison I
[54:11] feel the pull
[54:12] that's one of my face that song was
[54:13] written for me
[54:15] I began to sing that
[54:17] and that presence came and sat in my car
[54:20] and he spoke to me he said because of
[54:22] your faith oh it was a struggle to
[54:25] believe because of what medical science
[54:26] was telling me listen brother Tim ain't
[54:29] nothing special
[54:30] I'm trying to tell you each one of you
[54:32] that this God is just this real he said
[54:35] because of your faith I have healed your
[54:37] daughter from Down syndrome
[54:39] you know what when they say this
[54:41] somebody out on the street does she have
[54:43] Downstream I said well the doctor said
[54:44] she did
[54:46] Tim ain't confessing it
[54:48] because I'm calling because I know him
[54:51] now
[54:52] he's not a figment he's not tied back
[54:54] into brother Branham anymore are you
[54:57] with me but he's present tense right
[54:59] here right now this is what's been
[55:02] missing a long time
[55:03] we put him in the preachers we put him
[55:06] off somewhere else but I want to bring
[55:07] him down to your door tonight I want you
[55:10] to understand that this God my God your
[55:13] God is alive today
[55:18] I don't have to accept you don't have to
[55:20] accept what he's trying to do to you
[55:22] tonight
[55:24] maybe you've got the Holy Ghost and
[55:26] you've had it for a while now
[55:28] and he's trying to tell you you don't
[55:30] got it you can't make it
[55:32] and you've believed that lie and you're
[55:34] struggling
[55:35] I've seen people that has it for years
[55:38] and they don't act like it
[55:40] well I ain't worthy enough who is
[55:44] see I'll take the word and turn it back
[55:46] on the devil I know I ain't you telling
[55:48] you telling me that I ain't work don't
[55:50] you think I already know that
[55:54] but he said
[55:56] that Bob that's a reality said I have
[55:59] taken your unrighteousness
[56:01] and I have clothed you with my
[56:04] righteousness so devil you don't get to
[56:06] stay around here anymore are you with me
[56:09] we let him play too much we let him play
[56:12] in our lives we let him play in our mind
[56:14] we don't have to we've been a commission
[56:16] to take the word
[56:20] watch how real it had become to Joshua
[56:22] I'm getting ready to close watch how
[56:24] real it'll become to him he had never
[56:26] seen God
[56:28] but he knew his voice
[56:30] and one day under the commission he was
[56:33] under such an anointing he seen a man
[56:36] standing over with a sword drawn
[56:38] he's like uh
[56:40] I'm under commission to do this
[56:43] and he walked over to him
[56:45] it was so real to him that he was
[56:47] willing to fight anything that got in
[56:49] his path even God himself
[56:56] are you for us
[56:58] are you against us
[57:00] he said oh Joshua I'm the one that spoke
[57:03] to you I'm the one that gave you the
[57:05] commission
[57:07] this job's a little bit too big for you
[57:09] see when you face a job that's a little
[57:11] too big
[57:12] God says take your shoes off
[57:15] let me get the job done
[57:17] he's the best friend
[57:19] that you'll ever have
[57:21] he'll never forsake you he'll never turn
[57:25] his back on you
[57:29] David said when my mother and my father
[57:32] have forsaken me
[57:34] he said the Lord will take me up
[57:41] learn the message
[57:43] listen to it for yourself
[57:47] not second-handed
[57:49] listen to it for yourself
[57:52] but know the giver of the message first
[57:57] that will answer all of your questions
[58:00] God is called each and every one of you
[58:02] young people
[58:04] he's given you a commission
[58:06] to take the land
[58:09] oh sometimes I envy y'all I wish I could
[58:12] be your age coming up and just know God
[58:15] and not have to fight through as much
[58:17] stuff as I've had to fight through to
[58:18] believe
[58:19] but it's made me who I am today
[58:22] it's made me to know him in the power of
[58:24] his resurrection to know that the God
[58:27] that was with the prophet brother is
[58:29] with me
[58:31] how can you say that
[58:34] how can I not say it
[58:36] that means the same God that was with
[58:38] the prophet will also be with you even
[58:40] in you to the end of the world see we
[58:43] don't get to separate this message from
[58:45] the scriptures
[58:47] when you do we begin to make it say
[58:49] something it did not say
[58:53] and it creates confusion
[58:56] but to know him he is the revealer of
[59:00] all truth he is the one that brings the
[59:03] clarity to you
[59:05] well should I or shouldn't I well I got
[59:08] to find a quote whether I should or
[59:09] shouldn't
[59:10] really
[59:12] if you know him
[59:14] you don't need a scripture verse and you
[59:17] don't need a quote he will tell you
[59:19] God not do that
[59:21] shhh
[59:24] can I ask you a question what quotes and
[59:28] what scriptures did Abraham have
[59:34] he just had a one-on-one conversation
[59:36] with god
[59:37] just like this
[59:39] God has such confidence in him he said
[59:42] shall I hide anything
[59:44] from Abraham
[59:47] we're seeds of Abraham we're supposed to
[59:49] have that same one-on-one relationship
[59:51] the same commission that Joshua had
[59:56] well what I might have carried brother
[59:57] Tim the truth
[1:00:00] in a body of Flesh again
[1:00:03] so that Christ can manifest himself
[1:00:06] and whatever desire he wants to in
[1:00:09] whatever way he wants to
[1:00:12] I'm glad that some of y'all don't have
[1:00:14] to detox
[1:00:16] but if you don't know him this evening
[1:00:18] if you don't know that God that I'm
[1:00:20] talking about I want to introduce you to
[1:00:22] him
[1:00:23] I want to give you the opportunity to
[1:00:25] say I want that God I want the god of
[1:00:28] Joshua I want the god of the Prophet I
[1:00:31] want the god of brother Brown I want the
[1:00:32] god of Brothers him
[1:00:38] I had to believe it for myself
[1:00:41] and now when I listen to the message
[1:00:45] I hear other stuff I'm like that's
[1:00:46] that's an uncertain sound
[1:00:49] you know why because the one who gave it
[1:00:52] to me is on the inside
[1:00:54] directing my path
[1:00:57] bringing me to the place to where I need
[1:00:59] to be
[1:01:01] let's bow our heads
[1:01:03] Lord Jesus as a musician comes
[1:01:07] father we have testified of you of your
[1:01:09] power of your glory and of your grace
[1:01:13] oh God I thought about when brother Paul
[1:01:16] read that scripture this morning
[1:01:18] Psalm 78 of uttering the dark sayings of
[1:01:22] old
[1:01:23] God how I had slipped from one
[1:01:26] generation to the next and they had
[1:01:28] didn't even know you in a deep down just
[1:01:31] like the woman at the well didn't know
[1:01:33] who she knew that when the Messiah would
[1:01:35] come she had
[1:01:37] this historical understanding she had
[1:01:39] some reference of who you were and what
[1:01:41] you were to do
[1:01:43] but when you said I am he
[1:01:47] it was a very personal commission to her
[1:01:52] she said Oh Come See this man
[1:01:55] who's told me all I've ever done
[1:01:59] Lord if one tonight does not know you in
[1:02:02] the way that I'm speaking Lord
[1:02:05] may they come to know you tonight
[1:02:09] may they just say Lord I'm willing to
[1:02:10] lay everything aside younger old
[1:02:13] and I need to know you
[1:02:15] that way
[1:02:18] I believe the message
[1:02:20] I believe the prophet
[1:02:24] but I need to know the god
[1:02:27] of it all
[1:02:31] would you grant it to us tonight father
[1:02:34] granted Lord
[1:02:35] [Music]
[1:02:37] Hallelujah yes Lord Jesus in Jesus name
[1:02:41] we ask you I want
