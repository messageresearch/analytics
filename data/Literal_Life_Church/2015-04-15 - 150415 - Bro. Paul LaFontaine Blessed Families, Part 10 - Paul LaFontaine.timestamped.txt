[4:26] you have your Bibles we'll read together
[4:28] tonight and uh talk about blessed
[4:31] families again we're enjoying being able
[4:34] to talk together about this and this is
[4:35] the next place in
[4:37] Scripture it speaks of families um
[4:41] mentioned quite a few places but these
[4:42] are key places that I'm drawing out that
[4:45] are inspired to me and uh this would be
[4:48] part 10 bless families we just want to
[4:51] read you in the book of Nehemiah special
[4:53] very special book I've enjoyed the study
[4:55] through it through the years and I pray
[4:57] that it will be a blessing to you
[4:59] tonight
[5:01] amen Nehemiah chapter 4 Nehemiah chapter
[5:04] 4 and verse
[5:09] 7 see everybody back the towns took our
[5:12] kids to Johnson City and they were there
[5:14] for enjoy the services this weekend and
[5:16] it's good to have him back with us
[5:18] tonight after their trip on the weekend
[5:21] back as well a lot of weddings going on
[5:23] was at a wedding there several of them
[5:24] there's more coming up jar is coming up
[5:27] jar this isn't your last service with us
[5:28] it Sunday
[5:32] probably all different after that for
[5:35] sure for the good for the good let's be
[5:39] praying for him and Betsy I there's a
[5:40] lot of pressure and a lot of things that
[5:41] come up to the wedding day so let's just
[5:44] give them extra special prayer before
[5:46] the Lord and pray God will bless that
[5:47] day for them I think a lot of the church
[5:49] is going or half of them anyway so we'll
[5:52] have some home I twisted one of the
[5:53] preachers arms to be home here to have a
[5:56] preacher and uh we appreciate brother
[5:58] Josiah doing that uh staying home and uh
[6:01] so there'll be a few here to have a
[6:02] service and so that'll be good Nehemiah
[6:05] chapter 4 verse 7 says but it came to
[6:07] pass that when samulet and tobah and the
[6:11] Arabians and the ammonites and the aites
[6:15] heard that the walls of Jerusalem were
[6:16] made up and that the breaches begin to
[6:18] be
[6:19] stopped then they were very wroth and
[6:22] conspired all of them together to come
[6:24] and fight against Jerusalem and to
[6:26] hinder it nevertheless we made our
[6:29] prayer to to God and set a watch against
[6:31] them day and night because of them and
[6:33] Judah said the strength of the bearers
[6:35] of burdens is decayed and there is much
[6:37] rubbish so that we are not able to build
[6:40] the wall and our adversar said they
[6:42] shall not know neither see till we come
[6:45] in the midst among them and slay them
[6:47] and cause the work to cease and it came
[6:49] to pass that when the Jews which dwelt
[6:51] by them came they said unto us 10 times
[6:54] from all places when she shall return
[6:57] unto us they will be upon you what a
[6:59] threat there verse 13 Nehemiah says
[7:03] therefore set I in the lower places
[7:05] behind the wall and on the higher places
[7:08] I even set the people after their
[7:11] families with swords their Spears and
[7:14] their bows and I looked and Rose up and
[7:16] said unto the Nobles and to the rulers
[7:18] and to the rest of the people be not ye
[7:21] afraid of them remember the Lord which
[7:24] is great and terrible and fight for your
[7:26] brethren your sons your daughters your
[7:29] wives and your houses you know sometimes
[7:32] you got to fight for your daughters and
[7:34] fight for your sons and fight for your
[7:36] household when the enemy really comes in
[7:38] like a flood then we sometimes have to
[7:40] rise up and fight to save our families
[7:43] amen Heavenly Father we ask you to bless
[7:45] your word tonight and may it be inspired
[7:47] not because of me or my gift but may the
[7:50] Holy Ghost Inspire the word to each
[7:52] individual heart for all of us to catch
[7:54] the vision Lord of what you have for us
[7:57] in this day even the young ones catching
[7:59] the vision for their families in the
[8:00] future as you should T may they catch
[8:02] something out of the word Lord that
[8:04] would just stabilize them and anchor
[8:06] certain things Lord to be able to have a
[8:08] good family in the day we live in and
[8:10] bless all the families of literal life
[8:12] Lord and I just pray you'll bless my
[8:14] family as we look at these things may it
[8:16] be another stepping stone for us tonight
[8:18] and we commit the service wholly to you
[8:20] my precious father in Jesus name we ask
[8:22] it amen God bless you as you're seated
[8:25] tonight we just want to go to the word
[8:27] of God and um
[8:29] look at the book of Nehemiah here and
[8:31] look at the incident that took place
[8:33] where he says that he set up the
[8:34] families with their swords and their
[8:36] Spears and their bows but before I do
[8:39] I'd like to say something to the
[8:40] congregation and uh not everyone is here
[8:42] tonight but I'd like to say something
[8:43] about families uh so that uh we we don't
[8:46] have some Among Us who feel not aart or
[8:49] feel kind of left out in this series I
[8:51] don't want anybody to feel left out um
[8:54] and so if you're listening on the
[8:55] Internet or some weren't able to be here
[8:57] tonight A lot of times we listen
[8:58] streaming now I want everybody to know
[9:00] that sometimes family situations can
[9:02] change and I don't want certain ones to
[9:05] feel out because their family situations
[9:07] are different within a body of Christ
[9:09] you you have people and you have people
[9:12] that don't have any family at all you
[9:13] have people that have unbelieving family
[9:15] members in in the city that they live in
[9:17] and so they can only connect on certain
[9:20] things with those unbelieving family
[9:21] members and all of you know that it's
[9:23] just hard to uh come in a common page
[9:26] with a lot of I have a lot of family up
[9:28] here in Michigan I see him maybe every
[9:30] two or three years because we just don't
[9:32] have that much in common it's difficult
[9:33] to you know after about 10 minutes the
[9:35] conversation's over you've kind of
[9:37] reached uh all you can reach unless
[9:39] they're open to talking further and so
[9:41] we have some that way we have some with
[9:43] no family at all we have some with
[9:45] single family homes where the where the
[9:47] mom is raising the children and and uh
[9:49] doing her very best to do that without a
[9:51] father in the home um we have widows uh
[9:55] in the assembly can you say am man and
[9:57] we have we have older bachelors we have
[9:59] younger Bachelors but we have older
[10:01] bachelors and so those are those are
[10:03] different uh family situations that I
[10:07] don't want you to feel like that we're
[10:08] isolating just a certain perfect family
[10:10] of a husband and wife and father and
[10:12] mother and the children and all that uh
[10:14] I I believe with all my heart that when
[10:16] I speak about these principles of a
[10:18] family it includes all the families
[10:21] whatever situation they may be in and uh
[10:24] so I want you to feel that way because
[10:26] in the scripture in 1 Corinthians 7 it
[10:28] even says uh and we have examples of
[10:30] this but it says if the unbelieving
[10:32] depart if you have a husband or wife and
[10:34] the Bible says if the unbelieving depart
[10:37] let him depart uh a brother or sister is
[10:40] not under bondage in such
[10:43] cases so I'll read it to you again if
[10:45] the unbelieving depart let him depart a
[10:48] brother or sister is not under bondage
[10:50] in other words they're not under bondage
[10:51] to stay in that thing that that that is
[10:54] a a bad situation they're not under bage
[10:56] to stay continuing in that to be under
[10:58] that kind kind of into bondage in such
[11:01] cases and when I hear the scripture say
[11:02] in such cases then it tells me back in
[11:06] Paul's day there were other cases than
[11:08] the normal of a husband and wife and the
[11:10] children there was such cases can you
[11:12] say Amen there were other cases and I
[11:15] would say in the day we live in with
[11:17] Satan's attack on the family there's a
[11:18] lot of other cases that come up there's
[11:21] a lot of other situations that is not
[11:23] our choice can you say Amen it's not
[11:25] what the people have chosen and so uh in
[11:27] that we have to realize that so many
[11:30] different family situations pop up the
[11:33] body of Christ needs to support all of
[11:35] the family situations in every way that
[11:37] we can and when someone is lacking
[11:40] something then God will provide that
[11:42] within the body of Christ or at least he
[11:45] should when we yield ourselves if a CH a
[11:47] child is missing a father then she can
[11:50] see a father figure and and Garner a
[11:53] father figure by watching the images of
[11:55] a father within the body of Christ so
[11:58] she won't be lacking can you say me if
[12:00] she was in the world she may not see a
[12:01] good father but she ought to be able to
[12:03] look at the body and say wow I got to
[12:05] see the good image of a good father had
[12:07] a family uh young girl lived with us
[12:09] just uh about a year or so years ago and
[12:13] it wasn't a good family situation uh it
[12:15] was just a very broken up family and so
[12:17] she's married today and happy and
[12:19] serving the lord and she often looks
[12:21] back at the very short time she's been
[12:22] in our home and our home is not perfect
[12:25] by any means but she was able to see
[12:27] some good images that gave her hope that
[12:30] there's a the the the uh the family
[12:32] ended up splitting up and things but she
[12:33] said that I was able to see good images
[12:35] that I could apply to my marriage in the
[12:37] future and you see that's how God does
[12:39] it God never leaves anybody hanging God
[12:42] never leaves anybody just alone can you
[12:43] say amen and if we realize how important
[12:46] the body of Christ is we can find those
[12:48] needs met within the body and so there's
[12:50] so many family situations that pop up I
[12:52] never want anyone to feel left out and
[12:54] let me say this you are in the greatest
[12:58] Family on the face of the Earth and
[13:00] that's the family of God that's right
[13:03] can you say amen amen so don't let the
[13:05] devil tell you you don't have a family
[13:06] you do have a family and it's the
[13:08] greatest family it's the body of Christ
[13:10] and it it has I believe through Christ
[13:13] it has what you need the family of God
[13:16] but sometimes there's different
[13:17] situations how many knew that Timothy uh
[13:19] Timothy was a in a very Timothy was
[13:21] under Paul and he was uh uh Paul was his
[13:24] mentor in the Bible but the history says
[13:26] of Timothy which his name means honoring
[13:29] God Timothy was a son of a mixed
[13:31] marriage Timothy was a son of a mixed
[13:34] marriage and it appears his father died
[13:36] when he was still young and he was
[13:38] raised by his mother and grandmother
[13:41] according to strict Jewish
[13:43] Traditions that's Timothy there's two
[13:45] books in the Bible written with him Paul
[13:47] speaking to Timothy but it came from a
[13:49] mixed marriage and also came with a
[13:51] father dying very young the father
[13:53] wasn't in the picture in Timothy's life
[13:55] so if we use the criteria sometimes say
[13:57] well he's not going to have any hope he
[13:58] can't you know no that's not true he was
[14:00] raised by his grandmother and mother
[14:02] that were Holy Ghost filled people and
[14:04] I'd say he come out pretty good right
[14:06] can I get an amen I think Timothy come
[14:08] out pretty good and Paul refers that he
[14:11] says that uh follow the anointing or
[14:13] follow there something that the
[14:14] instruction you were given by the laying
[14:16] on the hands and foll the instruction
[14:18] your grandmother gave you through the
[14:20] teachings of Christ and all these other
[14:22] things I think it was great ra raised
[14:23] very strict Jewish and then when they
[14:25] came into the faith of God then they
[14:27] became Holy Ghost filled he grew as a
[14:30] young uh Paul being his mentor and then
[14:33] Paul goes so far as to say later he says
[14:35] I have no man likeminded that I could
[14:38] trust save
[14:39] Timothy he came right underneath that
[14:42] Ministry and God Paul could trust
[14:44] Timothy to preach this gospel the same
[14:46] way and there was a lot of men in Paul's
[14:48] life but he certainly trusted Timothy so
[14:50] there's a family situation then it goes
[14:51] on to say he was a resident of lisra or
[14:54] Derby and when Paul and Barnabas arrived
[14:57] in 44 ad his family was converted to the
[15:01] faith and under that conversion I don't
[15:03] know how Tim how young Timothy was but
[15:05] because the grandmother and the mother
[15:08] got filled with the Holy Ghost Timothy
[15:10] was just fine somebody say praise the
[15:13] Lord because the grandmother and mother
[15:15] didn't have a father but he had the Holy
[15:17] Ghost filled grandmother and mother and
[15:19] that was a family yes amen praise the
[15:22] Lord God fills the spaces can you say
[15:24] amen God will love you don't F alone God
[15:27] will love you and God will
[15:29] nurture you as he's the great father and
[15:32] he'll provide what you need now we're
[15:34] going on tonight and we're looking in a
[15:36] place the next place in scripture to
[15:38] encourage the families and uh we looking
[15:41] in here in Nehemiah and we're seeing
[15:44] this setting here uh in Nehemiah has a
[15:47] couple things that we want to bring out
[15:49] we'll probably only get to one tonight
[15:51] maybe finish it next Wednesday night but
[15:53] there's a couple main themes here right
[15:54] in the text and it says verse 13
[15:57] therefore set I in the lower places
[15:59] behind the wall and on the higher places
[16:01] I even set the people after their
[16:03] families with their swords their Spears
[16:05] and their bows and what he means there
[16:07] is he set them at a place on the wall
[16:09] because they had come to build the build
[16:11] the wall of Jerusalem and he set them
[16:13] but he didn't set them where the
[16:14] families were separate he set them
[16:16] according to their families to build
[16:18] together and so what we're going to talk
[16:20] about tonight is a couple things that I
[16:22] see in this that would be a blessing to
[16:24] the families and that is number one
[16:26] working together for God vision for this
[16:29] day we're going to see here working
[16:32] together for God's vision for this day
[16:35] and uh number two always being ready to
[16:39] fight the forces that hinder the
[16:42] vision amen always being ready to fight
[16:45] against the forces that will hinder the
[16:46] vision because we're going to find and I
[16:48] I won't have time to read it all tonight
[16:50] of course but you read the book of
[16:51] Nehemiah you're going to find samlet and
[16:54] uh uh you're going to find these fellas
[16:56] names of samet and toaya being two men
[16:59] used of the enemy for the sole purpose
[17:01] of trying to stop this building of the
[17:03] wall to try to stop this purpose to try
[17:05] to come against it and they were
[17:07] constantly agitating they were
[17:08] constantly doing everything they can to
[17:10] hinder uh these families building back
[17:12] this wall of Jerusalem if you're trying
[17:14] to serve the Lord and trying to set a
[17:16] higher standard and trying to head in
[17:19] the right direction nobody's perfect
[17:20] here tonight but you're trying to set
[17:22] some order to your family no matter how
[17:24] little a move you make get ready there's
[17:26] a toaya and there's a sble it against
[17:29] you right and they come through people
[17:31] can you say Amen they have names the
[17:33] devil Works through people and he is
[17:35] going to really try hard to come against
[17:38] any family or any father or mother or
[17:41] that step up and say I want to live
[17:43] according to God's principles for my
[17:45] family get ready for a fight get ready
[17:48] for something to be against it and so I
[17:50] was just going to give a quick
[17:51] background and let you know that uh
[17:54] where what the setting is just in case
[17:56] you don't know cuz I know some are just
[17:58] starting to read their Bibles The Young
[17:59] Ones uh some are getting back into their
[18:02] Bibles and so if you never read what
[18:04] neemi Nehemiah is about then you have to
[18:07] realize uh years ago the temple was
[18:10] destroyed God's people rejected God
[18:12] rejected their Prophets The Temple was
[18:14] destroyed they were prophesied Jeremiah
[18:16] said you're going to go into captivity a
[18:17] lot of the religious leaders didn't
[18:19] believe that was going to happen a lot
[18:20] of them said no it can never happen to
[18:21] God's people well it did they were taken
[18:24] captive by Nebuchadnezzar and these men
[18:26] taken into Babylon they killed off aot
[18:28] the people they took the young ones the
[18:30] the the the the nicel looking young men
[18:32] and they took them into captivity in
[18:34] Babylon and they took a lot of captives
[18:36] I don't know how many but they took a
[18:37] lot of them and then they tra trampled
[18:39] down the temple they destroyed God's
[18:41] people's Temple and so now then there
[18:44] was a prophecy that said after 70 years
[18:47] uh you will be restored in other words
[18:50] your temple will be built back up again
[18:52] and if you'll turn to me if my people
[18:54] will turn to me then I have a promise
[18:56] that I will restore everything that got
[18:58] trampled down and I'll take you from
[19:00] your cap captivity and take you back
[19:02] into your Homeland and so after 70 years
[19:04] even Daniel caught that he said I
[19:06] understood the number of years that we
[19:08] were to go back according to the books I
[19:10] read of the Prophet praise the lord we
[19:13] understand a lot when we read the books
[19:14] of the
[19:16] Prophet Daniel said I understood by
[19:18] books I understood by Spoken Word books
[19:21] well I didn't quite say it that way but
[19:23] I understood by what books was he
[19:24] reading he was reading the prophets
[19:25] books of Jeremiah he's reading writings
[19:27] and by reading those he got discernment
[19:30] to understand wow in 70 in just a few
[19:32] more years we're headed back no matter
[19:34] what Nebuchadnezzar all the kings say
[19:36] we're headed back because God promised
[19:38] he would restore us so now the season
[19:41] came for restoration it came the time
[19:44] and as the Holy Spirit began to move
[19:46] upon men he moved on three main men and
[19:49] that was zerubabel Ezra and Nehemiah to
[19:52] be leaders to the people to lead groups
[19:55] of families to start the journey and
[19:58] head head back to Jerusalem and begin
[20:00] rebuilding the temple begin to rebuild
[20:02] the priesthood begin to put the
[20:04] sacrifice back in place and also to
[20:06] rebuild the wall and so these three men
[20:09] were used and instrumentals to do that
[20:10] so here they come under a a a holy
[20:13] spirit restoration Ministry to to build
[20:16] and to come back and to to be able to uh
[20:19] come back to their place as God's people
[20:21] again now these are types and shadows of
[20:25] uh the times that we live in because we
[20:28] are under a message that said he would
[20:30] restore all the years that has been lost
[20:33] in other words Joel 228 says though the
[20:36] caterpillar and all these different uh
[20:39] uh uh uh uh animals would eat away at
[20:42] the true tree of life and it's in there
[20:44] in Joel's prophecy they'll eat away at
[20:45] it uh but he said I will restore sayith
[20:48] the Lord so now as we get to the end of
[20:50] that it's time for restoration God
[20:52] begins to work and begins to restore the
[20:54] people back we're under a message of
[20:56] restoration we have come in the last
[20:59] days Jesus spoke of it John uh John
[21:02] spoke of it many of the scriptures speak
[21:04] of the last days are a day of
[21:06] restoration restoring us back to
[21:08] biblical truth restoring us back to
[21:11] Faith in that truth restoring us back to
[21:13] believing that all things are possible
[21:15] restoring us back to the faith of the
[21:17] fathers restoring us back to being like
[21:19] those in the apostolic days can you say
[21:22] man that your faith could raise in your
[21:24] position in Christ that they shall lay
[21:26] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[21:28] we're not being coming into some
[21:29] religion that we're a good person and
[21:31] come to church we want the faith of the
[21:33] fathers of Pentecost every believer in
[21:36] the end time say I want that kind of
[21:38] faith not that you're trying to do
[21:40] Miracles but you're also not trying just
[21:43] to be a good religious person that's not
[21:46] our Our Calling can you say Amen our
[21:48] calling is a full restoration back to
[21:50] what our fathers were on the day of
[21:52] Pentecost to Hill shall turn the hearts
[21:54] of the children back to the Pentecostal
[21:57] fathers what whatever they were the
[21:59] Purity everything that they were Faith
[22:02] their love their devotion together that
[22:04] everything that they were I want that I
[22:08] crave that can you say amen I want to be
[22:10] some religion and some denomination and
[22:12] some I'm wearing what I need to wear and
[22:14] I'm I'm giving to the poor I'm doing
[22:15] religious Deeds no the faith of the
[22:17] Pentecostal fathers living in me every
[22:20] day Lord that's what a Christian is
[22:22] today and that's what we're shooting
[22:25] for that's our promise it's a day of
[22:27] restoration and so the the types and the
[22:29] shadows of our times are back here in
[22:32] the book of Nehemiah every time we read
[22:34] now and I didn't discover this till you
[22:35] know maybe 15 16 years ago I didn't
[22:38] realize was reading the message message
[22:40] of Grace and brother bradam reads this
[22:42] scripture if you want to turn with me to
[22:43] Zachariah chapter 4 because this was a
[22:46] prophet during the days of those
[22:48] Restorations and uh they're going to go
[22:50] back and rebuild the
[22:51] Temple and in the book of Zechariah is
[22:55] what he reads in uh message of of
[22:59] grace verse 7 says chapter 4: 7 who art
[23:03] thou a great Mountain before Zer
[23:04] rubbable Thou shalt become a plain and
[23:07] he shall bring forth The Headstone
[23:08] therefore with
[23:10] shoutings uh Grace Grace unto it
[23:12] moreover the word of the Lord came unto
[23:14] me
[23:15] saying the hands of zerubabel hath laid
[23:19] the foundation of this house his hand
[23:21] shall also finish it and thou shalt know
[23:24] that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto
[23:27] you so it's prophecy of zerubabel when
[23:30] he comes back to build the foundation of
[23:32] God's Temple it's prophecy about the end
[23:35] time that there will be a Ministry of
[23:37] restoration begin and lay the
[23:38] foundations to bring us back to the
[23:40] people that we should be a people of
[23:42] Faith a people back to the faith of
[23:44] Pentecost a people
[23:46] that's molded into a bride that can be
[23:49] married to Christ can you say Amen a
[23:52] people that's coming to full maturity as
[23:54] Sons and Daughters of God with the
[23:56] character with faith virtue knowledge
[23:58] Temperance and patience all those things
[24:00] built into us the character of Christ
[24:02] and so that's prophecy but one thing I
[24:04] noticed here a couple years ago is that
[24:07] we're a part of the building it's not
[24:09] just say well Zer robable came he laid
[24:11] the foundation when I look at that I see
[24:13] and and brother Braham comments right
[24:14] there he says see that's the Malachi 45
[24:17] behold I send you the Elijah the prophet
[24:20] before the great and Dreadful day of the
[24:21] Lord and he shall turn the hearts of the
[24:23] fathers to the children the children to
[24:25] the fathers he types it right with our
[24:27] restoration min Ministry that Jesus
[24:29] himself said behold I send you he said
[24:31] I'll send you Elijah who truly shall
[24:35] restore all
[24:36] things and Jesus himself himself spoke
[24:39] of it so it begins with the ministry to
[24:42] lay the foundations but foundations are
[24:45] enough I said foundations Aren't Enough
[24:48] once the rubble's done once the
[24:50] foundations are laid that doesn't mean
[24:51] the ministers over it because it says
[24:53] the hands of the reubel have laid the
[24:54] foundation of this house his hands shall
[24:56] also what
[24:58] finish it God's going to finish it
[25:00] Sunday I said Revelations 10:7 one of
[25:02] the Mysteries is is it's the mystery of
[25:04] Christ The Mystery of God shall be
[25:06] finished in the days of the seventh
[25:07] angel so he's want to finish this
[25:10] mystery of Christ being in you so but
[25:13] one of the things I realize in chapter
[25:14] in hegi uh just one book back hegi
[25:18] chapter 1 he's talking about zero and he
[25:21] hegi the prop is talking about Zer
[25:22] robable and he's he's asking the people
[25:25] in verse 5 to consider their ways verse
[25:27] four is it time for you oh ye to dwell
[25:29] in your sealed houses and this how Li
[25:32] house lie
[25:33] waste uh excuse me verse two verse two
[25:37] thus speaketh the Lord of hosts saying
[25:38] this people say the time has not come
[25:40] the time that the Lord's House should be
[25:42] built then came with the word of the
[25:44] Lord to hegi the prophet is it time for
[25:46] you oh ye to dwell in your sealed houses
[25:49] and this house lie waste now therefore
[25:51] thus say the Lord consider your ways ye
[25:54] have sown much and bring in bring little
[25:57] ye eat but you have not enough you drink
[25:59] but you are not filled with drink you
[26:01] clothe you but there is none warm and he
[26:02] that
[26:26] earnthenecklace definitely when they
[26:28] gave me that figure this morning we had
[26:30] to do an extension because our taxes
[26:32] take forever to do we said my wife said
[26:34] somebody else is doing them this year
[26:35] we're having somebody else because it's
[26:36] just so hard to do all of ours and when
[26:38] they came brought that figure that was
[26:39] looking like this morning I was going oh
[26:42] the lord giveth in the IRS take it away
[26:44] but here says that's the way that's the
[26:46] world we live in and he's telling the
[26:49] people you you clothe yourself you
[26:50] you're working you got your own houses
[26:53] and it's all fine except for the house
[26:55] of the Lord was being neglected
[26:58] and you're part of building the house of
[27:00] the Lord that's why I want you to catch
[27:02] it isn't just rubbable it isn't just
[27:04] brother brand but we all have a part in
[27:08] building God's work for the last days
[27:10] amen amen go up to the mountain and
[27:12] bring wood and build the house and I
[27:14] will take pleasure and I will be
[27:16] glorified sayith the Lord so he's saying
[27:18] for the people to build the house but
[27:20] you will be instrumental and building
[27:22] and that's why I don't believe Z zable
[27:24] is a shadow of just William brandham
[27:27] because he says his hands will finish it
[27:29] I believe it's the entire Ministry of
[27:31] the last days that will finish the whole
[27:33] restoration work can you say man
[27:35] according to Revelations 10:7 and the
[27:38] Mystery of God should be finished as
[27:40] Heath declared to his servants the
[27:41] prophets we're living in those times
[27:43] God's finishes finishing his work in you
[27:46] are you listening amen we're living in
[27:48] the days God's finishes in his work in
[27:50] his bride he's finishing that and you
[27:52] have uh an in you're an instrument for
[27:55] that in other words you have a part in
[27:57] that families have a part in that and so
[28:00] that's what I want you to to look at
[28:01] tonight as they as they come together
[28:04] and don't be afraid of Shadows and types
[28:06] by the way because that's the way we
[28:08] look at the
[28:09] Bible remember I've been preaching about
[28:12] Jesus said others look at it and they
[28:14] don't understand the parable or they
[28:15] just hear the parable and they walk away
[28:17] but he says you're you're called to
[28:20] understand the mystery of the
[28:21] parable to others it's not given but to
[28:24] you it's given to understand the
[28:25] Mysteries and so we are people who look
[28:28] at the Bible different because we're
[28:30] saying Lord reveal to me what the shadow
[28:32] is I don't want to just read a story in
[28:34] the Old Testament I want to see what
[28:35] it's shadowing and if you don't believe
[28:37] the batt Bible Shadows things then you
[28:39] can't even hardly read the book of
[28:41] Hebrews because the book of Hebrews is
[28:43] Paul taking all the priesthood he's
[28:45] taken all the the the tent all the
[28:47] furniture and he's just laying it out
[28:49] and every one of those things in the Old
[28:51] Testament type is foreshadowing the true
[28:55] reality that's coming so if you don't
[28:57] Believe In Shadows and types and that oh
[28:59] you can't apply something to today then
[29:01] you can't even believe your Bible
[29:02] because it's prophets that catch those
[29:04] shadows and tell us those things so we
[29:06] can see the very time that we're living
[29:08] in yes that's right it's a secret many
[29:11] times the denominations look over and
[29:13] say we don't we don't want to go there
[29:15] because we can interpret it a lot of
[29:16] different ways well scriptures of no
[29:18] private interpretation the Holy Ghost
[29:20] interprets it by bringing it to pass and
[29:23] in the day that you live in God will
[29:25] through his holy spirit interet the hour
[29:27] that you're living in so you can see
[29:29] plainly the day you're living in to walk
[29:31] in the precepts that you're supposed to
[29:32] walk in for the day amen and so now the
[29:35] in the end time is a restoration
[29:37] Ministry and the the shadow of it is
[29:41] under Zer robable Ezra Nehemiah leaders
[29:43] that led families to head back into this
[29:46] we're part of the building and he is
[29:48] using us two one has laid the foundation
[29:51] but there's some to finish it the Myster
[29:53] is to be finished so now the temple was
[29:55] built the the foundation was built and
[29:57] the temple built under Z rable the uh
[30:00] the the priesthood was set up by Ezra
[30:03] and then we come to the book of Nehemiah
[30:06] and as I said I can't read it all but
[30:08] please read it because you get to the
[30:09] start Nehemiah serving a king as the cup
[30:12] Bearer I think he was and he gets word
[30:15] that the wall is crumbled down and the
[30:17] Wall's not been rebuked for some reason
[30:20] he gets this Vision in his heart and he
[30:22] starts crying that the wall of God is
[30:25] not built around the uh the Temple for
[30:28] some reason God just struck his heart
[30:30] and he began to weep and he was very sad
[30:32] for days come in to work that day and
[30:35] the boss said I've never seen you
[30:41] sad pretty good
[30:44] testimony we should learn from
[30:48] that never seen him
[30:53] sad he said I know he said but I've just
[30:56] got some news
[30:58] oh King that back in my land where we
[31:00] come from the Temple's been rebuilt but
[31:02] the walls are torn down and if there's
[31:04] no walls there's no protection for my
[31:07] temple God put it in his heart and God
[31:10] put it upon the king's heart he says
[31:12] listen you take the people that you want
[31:14] to take I'll Supply everything you need
[31:16] you put a trip together look at God
[31:18] working on that man's heart he's not
[31:20] he's not a Jew he's not a Jew is said
[31:23] you do what you need to do I'm
[31:24] supporting that and so now he puts
[31:26] together a whole group to head back and
[31:29] they got all the things that they need
[31:31] and they head back for the sole purpose
[31:33] of rebuilding the wall neemi Nehemiah
[31:36] caught the Revelation the walls are
[31:38] turned torn down and he led a group of
[31:41] people to go back and to build the wall
[31:44] around the temple and when they got back
[31:47] he come in through the night at night he
[31:49] was viewing all the tearing down of the
[31:50] walls he was just so sad about it you
[31:53] got we got a lot of work to do here we
[31:55] got to build but we've got got to do it
[31:57] together and the next the next day as he
[32:00] begin to pursue and put things in order
[32:02] to do it all of a sudden he realizes
[32:04] right away he's going to have some
[32:06] people against it he's going to have
[32:07] some pressure he's going to learn
[32:09] samulet and and tobiah are going to be
[32:12] men that are going to be beh uh going to
[32:14] be uh coming against him and coming
[32:17] against the people discourage the people
[32:19] that you can't do this and all this and
[32:21] he has to keep encouraging the people he
[32:23] has to keep praying say God you called
[32:25] me to do this God this is the work this
[32:27] is the finishing work to build the wall
[32:29] is the final thing to do and we want to
[32:32] do this and we believe we're called to
[32:33] do it and uh samulet and the Bible says
[32:38] his name means strength but he's a
[32:39] moabit samul is a moabit we know where
[32:42] that came from that tribe where it came
[32:45] from and he became the opponent of
[32:47] Nehemiah and The Returned Exiles in
[32:50] their goal of rebuilding the walls of
[32:53] Jerusalem tobiah means Jehovah is good
[32:56] to means Jehovah is good and he's the he
[33:00] was the head of the family he returned
[33:01] from Exile with zable but listen to this
[33:03] tobah this toaya he returned with Exile
[33:07] with zero but they were unable to prove
[33:09] their connection with Israel the second
[33:12] uh person was an ammonite Tobi was an
[33:14] ammonite who with samulet opposed the
[33:17] rebuilding of Jerusalem now it says
[33:18] they're two different men but it's quite
[33:21] possible that could be the same man one
[33:23] of them who returned back was rubbable
[33:25] but eventually joined in and was
[33:27] influenced by samulet to not be on the
[33:29] ones building the wall but to become a
[33:31] an agitation to ones who are trying to
[33:34] go further and grow in the Lord come on
[33:36] come on now all of a sudden people are
[33:38] along with you oh they're with you say
[33:40] yeah we're all growing together we got
[33:42] the same purpose we got the same mind we
[33:44] got the same vision let's move together
[33:46] and all of a sudden he's influenced by
[33:47] somebody else and now it becomes an
[33:50] agitation to those who want to go
[33:51] forward in the message who who who who
[33:54] want say this is God's vision for the
[33:55] hour this is God's purpose for the hour
[33:58] this is where this is the direction all
[33:59] of our families are headed by the Holy
[34:02] Spirit if somebody turns and goes the
[34:04] opposite way it never works in the body
[34:06] of Christ it's always brings division
[34:08] it's always a an agitation when that
[34:12] happens so the same devil that's working
[34:14] back then is the same devil working
[34:16] today that's right the sablet still come
[34:19] alive there's people that it's against
[34:20] you growing any further than what you
[34:22] are today that's right there's a devil
[34:24] that anoints people to discourage you
[34:26] from going any further right you got to
[34:29] be aware of that they were so against it
[34:32] have your Bibles there if you have them
[34:35] and look look to the things they said
[34:37] chapter two I'm going to move through
[34:38] these quickly chapter 2 and verse 10
[34:40] says when samlet The Hite and tobiah the
[34:43] servant the am Amorite heard of it it
[34:46] heard of what them rebuilding the wall
[34:48] it grieved them exceeding exceedingly
[34:51] that there was come a man to seek the
[34:53] welfare of the children of Israel they
[34:56] hated
[34:57] Nehemiah they couldn't stand it it they
[34:59] they they became exceedingly upset and
[35:02] it grieved them exceedingly two verse 19
[35:05] says but when samulet the horonite and
[35:08] Tobi the servant the ammonite and gam
[35:11] and the Arabian heard it they laughed us
[35:13] to scorn and despised us and said what
[35:16] is this thing that ye do will ye rebel
[35:19] against the king so here they laugh him
[35:22] to scorn get ready to get chuckled at
[35:25] get ready to get laughed at get ready to
[35:28] be scorned for what you
[35:32] believe and the purpose that you have
[35:35] catching God's vision for the hour this
[35:36] is what God said he was going to do in
[35:38] this hour according to the Bible and
[35:40] this is what I'm lined up with get ready
[35:42] to get laughed
[35:44] at says in chapter 4 and verse
[35:47] one but it came to pass that when samul
[35:50] had heard that they builded the wall he
[35:51] was wroth and took great indignation and
[35:54] mocked the Jews and he spake before his
[35:56] brother and in the army of Samaria said
[35:58] what did these feeble Jews will they
[36:00] fortify themselves will they sacrifice
[36:03] will they make an end in a day will they
[36:05] revive the stones out of the heaps of
[36:07] the rubbish which are burned just making
[36:09] fun of it it's not possible they can't
[36:11] do it what do they going to accomplish
[36:13] by themselves and guess what guess what
[36:16] they
[36:17] did because God was with them they
[36:20] finished the work of the Lord because
[36:22] God was with
[36:24] them amen if God be for us who can be
[36:28] against us if God spoken in his word no
[36:32] Devil's going to stop it I'm convinced
[36:34] neither death nor life or anything could
[36:36] separate us from the love of God Amen we
[36:39] will fulfill his purpose as we're
[36:41] obedient to him look at verse 7even and
[36:43] 8 but it came to pass that when samulet
[36:45] and toah the Arabians and the ammonites
[36:47] and the aites heard that the walls of
[36:49] Jerusalem were made up and that the
[36:51] breaches began to be stopped then they
[36:52] were very WTH and conspired all of them
[36:56] together to come come and to fight
[36:57] against Jerusalem and to hinder it
[37:00] nevertheless Nehemiah said we made our
[37:02] prayer unto God and set a watch against
[37:04] them day and night because of them verse
[37:07] excuse me chapter
[37:09] 6 chapter 6 and verse 12 says and lo I
[37:13] perceive that God had not sent him but
[37:15] that he had Pro pronounced this prophecy
[37:18] against me for tobah and samet had hired
[37:22] him tobiah and samet when they couldn't
[37:24] stop it themselves they hired a prophet
[37:26] to prophesy against them sounds familiar
[37:29] doesn't it B hiring balum yeah so now
[37:33] that makes it harder because it's a
[37:34] prophecy the Jews believe in prophecies
[37:37] but they were taught make sure that
[37:38] prophecy's coming from me he said one
[37:41] day in Deuteronomy 13 said how do we
[37:42] know Deuteronomy 18 how do we know that
[37:45] the prophecy comes from you Lord if I
[37:47] say it and it comes to pass then it came
[37:49] from me if I say it it don't come to
[37:51] pass it didn't come from me right the
[37:54] test of the prophecy amen and so he says
[37:57] I perceive that God had not sent him but
[37:59] that he Pro he pronounced this prophecy
[38:02] against me for tobah and samlet had
[38:03] hired him therefore was he hired that I
[38:05] should be afraid and so do and sin and
[38:09] that they might have matter for an evil
[38:10] report that they might reproach me
[38:12] what's the purpose that we might be
[38:15] afraid that we could be scared that we
[38:17] could be put under fear verse 14 says my
[38:20] God think thou upon tobiah and samulet
[38:24] according to these their works and on
[38:26] the prophet no no Noah that was the
[38:29] propheus and the rest of the prophets
[38:31] that they would put me in
[38:35] fear lord it's all you can do sometimes
[38:37] bring it to the
[38:39] Lord L I don't know why they're saying
[38:41] that I don't know why they're against me
[38:42] I don't know why they're being so
[38:44] vindictive towards me and towards the
[38:46] message and just they just become so
[38:48] hateful it seems like they don't even
[38:50] like to hear the term message anymore
[38:52] they become so tainted that they don't
[38:54] even like to hear the term message
[38:57] they get so angry tell you that's not me
[39:00] friend that's not God something is
[39:02] influenced them that way something So
[39:05] Glorious have God sent us and they
[39:06] become so vindictive towards it and so
[39:09] it's what what's it to do to put us
[39:11] under fear to put us under scare to make
[39:16] us afraid to get us to stop in our work
[39:20] of the Lord and what we're trying to do
[39:21] in our families and the direction we're
[39:24] trying to H to rebuild to bring us back
[39:26] to Faith again we're not there friends
[39:28] we're not back to that faith of
[39:30] Pentecost
[39:33] yet and I'm not wanting to sh stop short
[39:36] of it amen sometimes when you look at
[39:38] the church you say how in the world this
[39:40] going to this church going to come back
[39:42] to a Pentecostal church with the faith
[39:43] of the
[39:45] fathers I want to tell you as a pastor I
[39:47] don't want to stop short I don't care
[39:48] what it looks like that's where we're
[39:50] headed amen we have we have to dedicate
[39:53] ourselves we have to consecrate
[39:54] ourselves we have to fast and pray we
[39:57] have to ask for it can you say Amen it
[39:59] has to be our goal throughout this
[40:02] series on blessed families you have to
[40:03] have a goal you're reaching for and all
[40:05] that family is reaching for the same go
[40:07] the you have to tell what the goal is
[40:09] and then say we're not there Lord we we
[40:11] don't know how we can get there but it
[40:13] is the scriptural goal and that is our
[40:15] goal Lord help us help us to consecrate
[40:17] ourselves help us to lay down our own
[40:19] selfishness and attitudes help us to lay
[40:21] down things of the world because this is
[40:23] the goal and those actions prove that
[40:25] you want that
[40:28] go and if you don't want that then you
[40:31] stop short of the promise then then
[40:32] you're happy with where you're at I'm
[40:35] not happy with where I'm
[40:37] at not happy with where I'm at I'm
[40:41] thankful for where I'm at I'm thankful
[40:43] for all that God has given me I'm
[40:46] grateful for what he's done in my life
[40:47] I'm grateful for the Revelation I
[40:49] couldn't have made it this far without
[40:50] the revelation of God but I'm not
[40:52] satisfied with where I'm at or this
[40:54] church we need more faith faith we need
[40:56] more Revival we need people's lives we
[40:59] need more contri we need more humility
[41:02] we need to be at the altar
[41:04] ourselves laying Our Lives before God we
[41:07] need more humility we need more
[41:10] Brokenness we need repentance that's the
[41:13] only way to have Revival fires burning
[41:16] it doesn't come by us just staying cold
[41:17] and
[41:18] formal how many will pray with it for
[41:21] with
[41:22] me praise the Lord I got some on board
[41:25] praise the Lord I was thinking of that
[41:26] guy that today got his sentence what's
[41:28] his name the football
[41:30] player and watching there on the video
[41:33] and watch his reaction no Brokenness no
[41:36] tears life in prison two or three life
[41:39] sentences just so proud and
[41:41] hoty no Brokenness for what he's done of
[41:44] course it's proved that he did it they
[41:46] said the Jailer is saying today on the
[41:48] news the Jailer was with him the whole
[41:50] time he says he's just in another world
[41:51] he doesn't even know he's in jail
[41:53] doesn't even sense he doesn't think he's
[41:55] going to get get caught or anything he
[41:57] lives in another another thing he says
[41:59] he just he doesn't even know it until
[42:00] the sentence came today and when the
[42:02] sentence came he has no expression he
[42:04] has no feeling there's no tears There's
[42:06] No
[42:08] Remorse how does a man get to that
[42:11] spot
[42:13] Pride he don't have to answer to anybody
[42:16] he don't have to learn from anybody he's
[42:18] only he's a young man but he's given all
[42:20] these millions of dollars and no
[42:21] character to be able to handle it think
[42:23] I can kill people and get by with it
[42:25] right no Brokenness no humility No
[42:29] Remorse for what you've
[42:31] done Lord help
[42:34] us that's the kind of thing the world
[42:36] can make you that's the kind of thing
[42:38] the that the devil tries to make the
[42:40] church they're not teachable anymore I
[42:43] always want to be teachable I was always
[42:45] want to be correctable whatever the holy
[42:47] spirit's taking me further and if I get
[42:49] to the place I can't be teachable then I
[42:51] I can't grow
[42:53] anymore can I get an amen amen unless
[42:56] we're broken and humble to come to the
[42:58] altar or to be moved to Tears by the
[43:01] presence of God then we're moving out of
[43:03] the place that we can grow in the Lord
[43:05] that's right amen amen so Lord bring
[43:08] back that Brokenness that I can be
[43:09] touched by the presence of God I can be
[43:12] moved by his presence and I can be
[43:14] corrected when I need to be
[43:17] corrected these are the things that
[43:18] bring Revival right not cold Hearts
[43:21] that's for
[43:23] sure ah Hallelujah so you see all the
[43:26] things that he did and so now while he's
[43:28] building this back in chapter 4 now how
[43:32] he's building this he builds it setting
[43:33] up the families by the walls with their
[43:37] families together and it's read in the
[43:39] Amplified it's read this way so I set
[43:41] armed Men Behind the wall in places
[43:43] where it was least protected interesting
[43:47] I set armed Men Behind the wall in
[43:51] places where it was least protected come
[43:54] on that's good that's good
[43:57] right so there's the thrust by Nehemiah
[43:59] so now I'm going to set up protections
[44:01] so that we can keep working on this wall
[44:04] as families but because of the threat of
[44:07] what might be coming at any time we've
[44:10] got to set some Arm Forces there and
[44:13] we've got to set it in the place that's
[44:15] what least
[44:17] protected we can start with our children
[44:20] come on
[44:21] now because that's the place Satan tries
[44:24] to get our
[44:27] wives we can't get to the man he goes to
[44:30] the weaker vessel attacks her yes get to
[44:33] the children attack them can't get to
[44:36] the man sometimes maybe it's the other
[44:37] way around can't get he can get to the
[44:39] man because he's got some weak spot he
[44:41] doesn't not have underneath the blood he
[44:42] doesn't overcome it yet so he's got a
[44:44] weak spot there so now I'm going to he's
[44:45] in other words Satan is going to attack
[44:47] the weak spot he's going to go to where
[44:49] you're weak and that's what he's
[44:51] teaching us here Nehemiah he's saying
[44:53] take your weak spot and cover it with
[44:55] guards
[44:58] you weak a little bit of this and lust
[44:59] and all these other things you better
[45:01] cover up your weak spots that's the way
[45:03] we're going to live and build this wall
[45:05] is that you got to go to the weak spots
[45:07] and set the guard
[45:08] there amen you got to go overboard when
[45:11] it comes to protecting those
[45:13] SP that's why courtship we had such a
[45:16] great conversation at the youth meeting
[45:17] the other night to to to talk about
[45:19] courtship because I don't want to feel
[45:20] like it's all kinds of rules that's not
[45:22] all about it but what it is is that
[45:23] we're living in a world that's gone to
[45:25] the extreme this way so sometimes it
[45:27] looks like Brother Paul's going the
[45:28] extreme this way it's to counter the age
[45:31] we live in it's to counter our weak
[45:34] spots and So a family should live that
[45:37] way as Nehemiah is teaching us while
[45:40] we're building this great wall and
[45:41] building for the Lord and doing these
[45:43] things that we should do for God's work
[45:45] in this hour we can't do it without
[45:47] protecting our weak
[45:49] spots and watch how the devil gets in in
[45:52] an area would never dream he would get
[45:54] in slip flipping in somewhere he said I
[45:57] put those men there he said Behind the
[45:59] Walls and then he says I set the
[46:01] families in order building in guarding
[46:04] we won't get to the guarding this week
[46:06] as much we'll get to the building we'll
[46:07] get to the guarding next week here they
[46:10] have their swords later on the
[46:12] scripture he said the men were putting
[46:16] up stones and building with one hand and
[46:18] had their sword in the
[46:20] other Lord that's how they build this
[46:23] wall I want you to read that because
[46:25] you'll oh get to it next week that's
[46:27] that's how I do here they are they're
[46:28] working here with one hand but they got
[46:30] their sword in the other that's the way
[46:32] to do
[46:33] it so now he sets these along the wall
[46:36] but he sets them up according to their
[46:39] families in other words I get from that
[46:42] when you're going to have this great
[46:43] work of the Lord the families are set up
[46:47] together building this
[46:51] together
[46:52] and they're catching the goal for the
[46:55] hour they're catching ing the purpose
[46:56] they've come back out of Babylon
[46:57] captivity they've headed back and for
[47:01] some reason God wants them to not do
[47:04] this as separate family members and you
[47:07] know you got the teenager over here and
[47:09] he's on the other side and you got the
[47:11] children over here for some reason he
[47:15] said I want you to build this together I
[47:18] want you to work on this as a family
[47:21] together right sir catch what God's
[47:24] saying now friends because we ought to
[47:26] be really listening because we live in a
[47:29] day that is always trying to separate
[47:32] the family
[47:33] members where the teenagers go here and
[47:36] the children will go over here and
[47:38] they're shipped out over here and you
[47:40] got to sh sometimes they ship them out
[47:42] to daycare over here and this way and
[47:44] the mom's going here and the Dad's going
[47:46] here they're like two ships passing in
[47:48] the night that's the society we live in
[47:50] that's the day we live in no wonder
[47:52] families break up so quickly I'm not
[47:54] even talking about spiritually I'm just
[47:56] talking about it always has us going 50
[47:58] different
[48:00] directions where rarely there's time for
[48:03] the family to be together to even talk
[48:05] about what their goal is what they want
[48:08] to accomplish what they want to do get
[48:10] to get to know one another and get a
[48:12] feeling for one another and then I can
[48:14] fight for you together because children
[48:15] and the family feel more security when
[48:18] there's times together they feel
[48:20] security from
[48:23] that so now here they are catching the
[48:26] goal and being a part of the F of this
[48:28] as a family Nehemiah wanted them working
[48:30] together on this not separate there's so
[48:33] many things that send us different ways
[48:36] in the world we live in and put us in
[48:38] different age groups even the church
[48:39] does that did you know that we got
[48:41] Sunday school we got youth
[48:44] groups we got couples
[48:47] meetings and there was a book that a
[48:50] fellow read about the church world that
[48:52] that he wondered if all of that had
[48:54] contributed cuz a lot of churches I I
[48:56] like it when we can all come together
[48:57] for the regular service where we sit
[48:59] together as families for the word but a
[49:01] lot of churches I didn't know this till
[49:02] later on that that the entire service
[49:05] the children are all in a children's
[49:06] area the entire time and I'm always
[49:09] wondering how those teachers get fed the
[49:11] word of gone for that week if they're
[49:13] just with the kids the whole time and
[49:15] then they've got the youth they got a
[49:16] whole youth explosion or whatever they
[49:18] call it they got a youth thing going on
[49:20] and and uh all the parents and then they
[49:23] got the older ones in different classes
[49:25] suay morning and so the whole everything
[49:27] is separate ages and I'm not saying
[49:28] that's a bad thing except for except for
[49:31] it doesn't seem to have the big vision
[49:33] of bringing the families together that
[49:35] they can learn it because there's
[49:36] benefits there's benefits to the young
[49:39] ones being around the older ones if
[49:41] they're with their peers all the time I
[49:43] don't know how much they're going to
[49:46] learn
[49:48] amen and so you know if there's a boy
[49:52] and he hasn't been around his dad a lot
[49:55] he didn't have a good dad situation then
[49:57] in the body of Christ there would be
[49:59] opportunities for him to be around older
[50:01] strong Holy Ghost filled men amen that's
[50:03] what that boy needs he doesn't need to
[50:05] be around the girls all the time he
[50:08] doesn't need to be around the youth all
[50:09] the time he needs an image of a strong
[50:11] man to learn from so if we're always
[50:14] separating them all the time and you
[50:15] never have opportunities for them to be
[50:17] together then those those strengths
[50:20] can't take place you understand it would
[50:22] be the girl the same way you know she
[50:24] had a bad home situation or whatever and
[50:26] so now if she stays amongst the youth
[50:29] she may not be able to see the images
[50:31] she needs to see to go and become a wife
[50:33] and a mother according to God's word she
[50:35] didn't see the Right image so the only
[50:36] way she sees it is to hear these women
[50:38] talk hear these older women sister inz
[50:41] and the different ones and hear them
[50:42] talk and my mom and see how they
[50:44] function and and they might say things
[50:46] sometimes and that that younger girl go
[50:49] that's
[50:51] whatever you know but they still need to
[50:54] hear it that's right they need to see
[50:56] that long pattern of that woman being
[50:57] faithful all those years everything's
[51:00] consistent in her life Holy Ghost
[51:02] filled and that's why the Bible says let
[51:04] the older women teach the younger women
[51:06] to be keepers at
[51:08] home amen that's bible teach them to
[51:12] take care of their children to be
[51:13] keepers of home that's what the Bible
[51:14] say the older women should teach the
[51:15] young woman it's not by just having a
[51:17] class teaching them we've done that but
[51:19] it's by example it's by watching their
[51:21] mannerisms how do they relate to their
[51:23] husband how you know how all these
[51:25] things happen images are more important
[51:28] than what said over the
[51:30] pulpit if you could preach all the truth
[51:33] and not see images of it being lived
[51:35] what good would it
[51:36] do if I preaw this and our young people
[51:39] couldn't see images of a holy ghost
[51:42] filled person and how that acts then IM
[51:45] see image is more important even than
[51:47] just hearing it in the
[51:48] word they need to be able to look and so
[51:51] now you start separating this too much
[51:53] maybe this is a good lesson for us is
[51:55] that let me say to you young men is that
[51:57] you need to be around the guys that's
[51:59] great it's lovely I'm not against it but
[52:01] you also need to be around these older
[52:02] guys in the church he's older men you
[52:05] need to learn with them about finances
[52:07] you need to learn how they do that how
[52:09] they talk about their money how they
[52:10] talk about different things that they do
[52:12] and you can learn from that I'd rather
[52:13] you learn here than somewhere else
[52:15] right you young girls that are young
[52:18] marrieds you need to learn from the
[52:20] older marriage you need to be around
[52:21] that some not always all the teenage
[52:23] girls yeah your in you're kind of going
[52:27] backwards you might stay a teenager your
[52:29] husband didn't marry a teenager well
[52:32] maybe he
[52:33] did but he doesn't want a teenager the
[52:36] rest of your life and young girl uh that
[52:38] that guy you married that girl's
[52:40] probably saying to you I don't want you
[52:41] to stay a teenage boy all your life grow
[52:45] up you know 50,000 IR hours a week on
[52:51] video
[52:52] games time to grow up when I was a child
[52:55] I was a child when I became a man I put
[52:57] away childish
[52:59] things these are images you see and the
[53:02] world we live in is to keep everybody a
[53:03] teenager I guarantee you that's right
[53:06] keep them in a young teenage State
[53:07] that's the world we live in but the
[53:09] Bible Praises somebody growing into not
[53:11] that they don't become fun anymore but
[53:13] they grow into aged men that are
[53:16] inheriting the promises that's what the
[53:18] Bible glorifies and that's what all of
[53:19] us young should be shooting for somebody
[53:22] that's growing into that maturity of
[53:23] wisdom of life know how to handle the
[53:26] devil you know how to handle your
[53:28] finances according to the word of God
[53:29] you know how to do this you you figured
[53:31] it you figured it out by the word of God
[53:33] and you're living that out you boys need
[53:35] to see those images and you girls need
[53:37] to see those images of older women and
[53:39] if you run from that you're running from
[53:41] a Biblical way and you're not going to
[53:42] grow up in certain areas that's right
[53:45] all this is not in my notes tonight this
[53:47] is all
[53:48] free
[53:49] completely it's all free
[53:52] actually so now you feel relieved right
[53:55] no special offerings tonight you know
[53:59] it's a good subject we don't talk about
[54:02] this enough good because the world
[54:04] separates but we want to be careful that
[54:06] we're not separating so much the
[54:08] families according to the scripture God
[54:10] likes the families to be together yeah
[54:13] working on the work of the Lord
[54:16] together and uh taking a family trip
[54:20] together amen no matter how hard it is
[54:24] sometimes
[54:25] on that family
[54:27] trip it's good it's all good brother
[54:30] Braham says in uh Middletown Ohio down
[54:33] here in the message uncertain sound our
[54:36] home life has broke up and years ago it
[54:38] used to be that mother and dad was home
[54:39] at night used to be that mother and dad
[54:41] was home at night if it wasn't for
[54:43] church sometimes or something they were
[54:44] home at night and they never let their
[54:46] children they never let their children
[54:48] roam the streets and run around all
[54:49] night and nowadays it seems to kind of a
[54:51] popular opinion oh how how you just go
[54:54] to the modern home today and look what
[54:56] it is Papa he has to hurry down to the
[54:57] pool room the boys are down playing pool
[54:59] or bowling or something him and M the
[55:02] sister's at the canteen somewhere at
[55:04] some rock and roll party Junior's got
[55:06] the hot rod out seeing how many he can
[55:07] outrun with it and that's about what
[55:09] home life is and the Bible oh the Bible
[55:12] it's a great book but it's put in a
[55:13] drawer somewhere until the until the
[55:15] pastor comes over or somebody comes over
[55:19] and we just don't have the home life we
[55:21] used to have home life is so uncertain
[55:25] and I'll add
[55:26] insecure thus it makes those teenagers
[55:30] and kids feel separated feel
[55:35] insecure they're they're trying to put
[55:37] on a show that they're not scared like
[55:39] the guy walking through the graveyard or
[55:41] walking by the graveyard he's whistling
[55:43] so he can tell everybody he's not as
[55:45] scared but he's
[55:47] scared children sometimes won't admit it
[55:49] but they're scared to death because they
[55:51] feel insecurity there's no solidness in
[55:54] the family there's no Unity there's no
[55:56] togetherness there's not what is the
[55:58] absolute of what we believe what do we
[56:01] come what do we come together on I know
[56:04] I'm I'm I Stumble sometimes in my words
[56:07] but I pray the Holy Spirit would get
[56:08] this to you tonight I'm talking about
[56:10] the families being together so that the
[56:12] children and teenagers feel a security
[56:15] in something besides money feel a
[56:18] security in something besides
[56:20] entertainment do you forget what I said
[56:22] last Wednesday night your home can't be
[56:24] a child centered home you can't have an
[56:27] entertainment do you have an
[56:28] entertainment centered home that's all
[56:31] about what's the next entertainment
[56:33] what's the next vacation and you live
[56:35] for that it's what everybody talks about
[56:38] what's the next entertainment what's the
[56:39] next movie that's coming out so we can
[56:41] all watch together that's an
[56:42] entertainment centered
[56:44] home can't do that can't be a wife
[56:47] centered home everything revolves around
[56:50] the emotions of the wife or the emotions
[56:52] of the
[56:53] husband no it can't be an emotion
[56:56] centered home as I was preached to you
[56:57] last last week it has to be a Christ
[57:00] centered home so will you have emotions
[57:02] yes will you have these things to deal
[57:05] with yes all that's normal but what you
[57:07] always come back to well we have a need
[57:08] in our life we feel like we're getting
[57:10] off track families come together let's
[57:12] pray about this let's bring this before
[57:13] the Lord that's a Christ centered home
[57:15] amen daddy comes and says guys I I've
[57:18] been wrong on some stuff I've got off
[57:20] track here I shouldn't acted that way
[57:21] shouldn't have done this I've done made
[57:22] some bad decisions and I apologize you
[57:25] kids and I'm going to do my best to not
[57:26] ever do that again that's a Christ
[57:28] centered home why because it's the
[57:30] humility of
[57:31] Christ that's pointing to Christ it's
[57:34] pointing the kids to Christ yes Mom says
[57:37] you know I I I've done some things and I
[57:39] just I want I'll make that right and I
[57:40] want to be able to do that that's a
[57:43] Christ Center home let's go to prayer
[57:46] let's go to church let's let's take our
[57:48] vacation and get in a couple of those
[57:50] meetings that are going on let's hear
[57:52] the good word of God that's Christ
[57:53] centered home
[57:55] anybody anybody listening tonight now
[57:58] can't be centered around anything else
[58:01] or it can't be a blessed
[58:04] family and so we have an atmosphere in
[58:06] the world that breaks up families and
[58:07] I'm about ready to wrap it up here
[58:08] tonight so we have an atmosphere that
[58:10] breaks up families in the world and it
[58:12] starts by getting everybody going
[58:14] separate ways as brother Bram says
[58:16] Susie's running over here and she's got
[58:18] this to do and all there and I know we
[58:20] get busy doing things and then there's
[58:22] never a night when the family comes
[58:23] together there's never a Time where we
[58:25] just come together and Center on Christ
[58:27] in prayer and talking about things even
[58:29] if it's not just on that kids need a
[58:32] chance to share the burdens they're
[58:34] going through and if Mom and Dad don't
[58:37] have time to hear that they're too busy
[58:40] you're too busy if you don't have time
[58:43] to hear the burdens of your kid that's
[58:46] not being child centered that's being a
[58:48] parent like our our heavenly father
[58:50] who's willing to listen to us any time
[58:52] amen there's nothing more important for
[58:54] God when his children are crying out to
[58:56] him he lays everything else aside for
[58:58] you amen and that's what we do as
[59:01] parents we say my this is critical that
[59:04] I set everything else aside and hear the
[59:06] heart and have the heart of my kids not
[59:08] their heads have their hearts where is
[59:10] the heart of that kid where's the heart
[59:13] of that teenager and that's that's a
[59:14] little bit more
[59:15] challenging to know where the heart of
[59:17] your teenager
[59:19] is but you got to spend
[59:21] time if I go a few days and I don't know
[59:24] the heart of one of my my teenagers I
[59:26] start getting nervous I start getting
[59:28] unsettled right what are they
[59:32] thinking what what are they you know
[59:33] what's going on in
[59:35] that uh brain of
[59:38] theirs you know what are they thinking
[59:40] they're sitting over there and you know
[59:42] they're going like this usually and when
[59:44] they're not they're they're going like
[59:46] this and you ask your son you say how
[59:49] was your day it was all
[59:51] right how's life all right
[59:55] it's about the extent of what you get
[59:56] out of them
[59:58] sometimes really sharing their heart is
[1:00:01] all
[1:00:04] right
[1:00:07] but you got to know where their heart is
[1:00:10] you got to romance their heart you've
[1:00:12] got to come close to them and want to
[1:00:14] know what's what's what what's going on
[1:00:17] so you can pray for them so you can
[1:00:19] encourage
[1:00:20] them praise the
[1:00:23] Lord so now now we have to work against
[1:00:27] this world that separates us all the
[1:00:29] time that we come together more often
[1:00:32] and when you do that trust me you will
[1:00:34] have more Security in your wife more
[1:00:38] Security in your children more security
[1:00:41] as a whole as a family you think you'll
[1:00:43] watch things turn around that you maybe
[1:00:45] couldn't feel like you couldn't turn
[1:00:46] around but because the family has a goal
[1:00:48] and that's what I'm preaching to you
[1:00:49] tonight as they were headed back from
[1:00:51] captivity they had a goal they would
[1:00:55] have to get jobs and me do all that but
[1:00:56] they what was the goal to rebuild this
[1:00:59] wall to rebuild this this is the work of
[1:01:01] the Lord this is his vision for the hour
[1:01:03] and guess what family we're a part of
[1:01:05] that Vision teach your children to be a
[1:01:08] part of the vision of the hour yes find
[1:01:11] out what God's vision is and teach your
[1:01:13] children to be a part of it do you have
[1:01:14] a goal do you have a family
[1:01:18] goal do you have a a a a a a mission
[1:01:23] statement do you have what you're
[1:01:24] shooting for as a family have you ever
[1:01:26] sit down and talked about where you're
[1:01:28] going as a family you know the Bible
[1:01:30] says without a vision the people perish
[1:01:32] what is your family Vision where do you
[1:01:35] want to
[1:01:36] go where do you want to be five years
[1:01:39] from now where what is the ultimate goal
[1:01:41] and and that goal should be rooted in
[1:01:43] Christ and his goal that we're of the
[1:01:45] day we're living in and uh if we see our
[1:01:48] place in the vision for the last days
[1:01:50] then we bring our family in line with
[1:01:52] his vision for this hour as they did in
[1:01:55] the days of Nehemiah and you connect
[1:01:58] those children you listening fathers
[1:02:01] mothers connect those children with the
[1:02:04] scriptures on how God says we live to
[1:02:07] please
[1:02:09] him don't just assume they know
[1:02:12] it connect them with the absolutes of
[1:02:15] the word is everybody tired tonight or
[1:02:17] some are
[1:02:20] tired
[1:02:22] hello all right now I got your
[1:02:26] attention connect those children with
[1:02:28] the
[1:02:31] scriptures that show how God says we
[1:02:33] live to please him connect him with
[1:02:36] those scriptures see it just seems so
[1:02:38] intellectual so no no no just connect
[1:02:41] them with the scriptures let God do the
[1:02:43] rest pray and let God do the rest his
[1:02:46] word is his will and we're a family
[1:02:49] that's seeking his will and not our own
[1:02:51] will that's right now how many families
[1:02:53] say I'm seeking God's will will it's a
[1:02:55] lot easier to raise your hand on that
[1:02:57] than to really believe it and put it
[1:02:58] into practice because his word is his
[1:03:02] will you want God's will for your life a
[1:03:04] lot of times we think of his will in
[1:03:06] terms of what job I'm supposed to have
[1:03:08] or what what city I'm supposed to live
[1:03:09] in yeah that's all part of it but a few
[1:03:11] years ago I preached that first of all
[1:03:13] the will of God is the word of God the
[1:03:15] word of God for the day what did God
[1:03:16] want to accomplish for this day and so
[1:03:18] when we connect with that and know God's
[1:03:20] will for the day then and you pray with
[1:03:22] that then God will lead you guide you as
[1:03:24] a Shepherd to what job you're supposed
[1:03:26] to have what city you're supposed to
[1:03:28] live what church you're supposed to be
[1:03:29] in he'll show you his will but always
[1:03:31] remember his word is his
[1:03:34] will and you could search for a job all
[1:03:36] you want to and the city you're supposed
[1:03:38] to live in and do all these other things
[1:03:40] and completely miss the vision that
[1:03:43] God's trying to accomplish in this day
[1:03:45] that we live in right some of this stuff
[1:03:48] is I think uh practical but I pray it's
[1:03:51] a blessing to you so now our family
[1:03:55] our identity for our family what is your
[1:03:58] family identity what are you known by my
[1:04:01] dad used to say if you
[1:04:03] were you were convicted as a Christian
[1:04:07] when they went around your house and
[1:04:08] went around your life would there be
[1:04:10] enough evidence to convict you for being
[1:04:12] a CH for being a
[1:04:14] Christian and so now what is your family
[1:04:16] identity what are you known for and our
[1:04:19] our identity for our family should not
[1:04:21] be some new version of the Bible but
[1:04:23] bible-based
[1:04:25] and people know that our family is
[1:04:27] bible-based our identity is
[1:04:29] distinctively a Christian family that
[1:04:31] obeys the precepts of God that's our
[1:04:33] identity that doesn't
[1:04:34] change you can have all kinds of sorts
[1:04:37] of identities people you're what you're
[1:04:38] known
[1:04:39] by but it should start with this and if
[1:04:43] you live in the blessed time to receive
[1:04:46] a Ministry that expresses God's will for
[1:04:49] the present
[1:04:50] times then praise God Amen if you're
[1:04:54] blessed which you are to live in a day
[1:04:56] where God expresses a Ministry to bring
[1:04:59] God's will for the present time then you
[1:05:02] should praise God and that's what we
[1:05:03] should follow Bible says let me read it
[1:05:06] the way it says this in Titus 2:
[1:05:09] 11-2 for the grace of God that bringeth
[1:05:12] salvation hath appeared to all
[1:05:14] men teaching us that denying ungodliness
[1:05:18] and worldly lust we should live
[1:05:21] soberly righteously and
[1:05:24] Godly in this present
[1:05:28] world now Paul's talking about his time
[1:05:31] because he said that right we should be
[1:05:33] soberly righteously Godly in this
[1:05:35] present World well we can apply that to
[1:05:37] our day and say our goal as a family is
[1:05:40] to deny ungodliness and worldly lust and
[1:05:43] we should live soberly righteously and
[1:05:45] godly in our present world not Paul's
[1:05:48] day in this present world what does it
[1:05:50] mean to live righteous in our world what
[1:05:53] does does it mean to live Godly in our
[1:05:55] world what does it mean to live soberly
[1:05:58] in our present day so then you start
[1:06:00] taking all the extremes of this Earth
[1:06:02] and what they teach us right from uh
[1:06:05] beauty is emphasized over character a
[1:06:08] woman's body is emphasized the nakedness
[1:06:10] of a woman's body is is thrown out there
[1:06:13] not to be totally naked but to show just
[1:06:15] enough of it that it excites men's lust
[1:06:17] that's the world we live in so how do we
[1:06:20] live soberly and righteously to teach
[1:06:22] our children we go the opposite of that
[1:06:24] and we believe in modesty because why
[1:06:26] we're living in this present world where
[1:06:28] a woman's body is emphasized and put out
[1:06:29] there as flesh wholesale
[1:06:33] beauty so that's our present world
[1:06:36] what's our present world was TVs and
[1:06:38] movies Paul's present world no so you
[1:06:41] don't think preachers got to preach
[1:06:42] about TV and movies come on why because
[1:06:45] the Bible says we're supposed to live
[1:06:46] righteously and godly in our present
[1:06:48] World well I need Scripture for that
[1:06:51] well you're not going to find a
[1:06:52] scripture about TV yeah except for tell
[1:06:56] the vision to no
[1:06:57] man which doesn't really fit that's a
[1:06:59] long
[1:07:01] shot but I can use set no evil thing
[1:07:04] before
[1:07:05] you but you're not going to find
[1:07:07] television in there you're not going to
[1:07:09] find internet in there that's right but
[1:07:12] you're going to find about being trapped
[1:07:14] by the
[1:07:20] internet don't shake your head Jared
[1:07:23] being my s
[1:07:28] tonight you're not going to find the
[1:07:30] worldwide web in there you're going to
[1:07:32] find stuff about being trapped but not
[1:07:34] the
[1:07:36] worldwide
[1:07:40] web interesting isn't
[1:07:43] it I got to see it in here I I got to
[1:07:46] see what we're supposed to wear in there
[1:07:48] well you're the Blessed people that get
[1:07:51] specifics from a man sent from God
[1:07:54] that's right his ministry is over but he
[1:07:56] set the order for the age and I'm not
[1:07:58] going to be ashamed to say this I'm not
[1:08:01] going to be ashamed to preach it because
[1:08:02] I feel it's not a curse it's a blessing
[1:08:06] that you because some of the other ages
[1:08:07] never had that quality to be able to
[1:08:10] come from God and tell us in this
[1:08:12] present age this is how someone should
[1:08:14] dress this is how we should live this is
[1:08:17] how we should
[1:08:18] act so I don't have any problem teaching
[1:08:20] my kids that I don't feel no shame maybe
[1:08:23] they Co it's a cult or something it's
[1:08:24] not a cult John the Baptist wasn't a
[1:08:27] cult when the Bible said there was a man
[1:08:29] sent from God whose name was John he
[1:08:32] came from God to point us to Christ so
[1:08:35] why would I be ashamed to point my kids
[1:08:37] to the very Ministry that was sent and
[1:08:39] the word that was sent through him to
[1:08:41] bring us back to how Christ would live
[1:08:43] in the present day that we live in
[1:08:46] amen unashamed of
[1:08:49] it you're blessed that's how families
[1:08:51] are blessed amen can you say Amen praise
[1:08:54] the Lord I know I'm wrapping it up here
[1:08:56] but you if you want to live soberly
[1:08:58] righteously and godly in this present
[1:08:59] world you do the opposite of the times
[1:09:02] you live in and you'll probably be
[1:09:03] better off do the opposite all right I'm
[1:09:06] going to wrap it up because people are
[1:09:07] so tired
[1:09:09] tonight in this age it was a Ministry to
[1:09:11] restore to give us the stones to rebuild
[1:09:13] as he gave them we put them in a in as
[1:09:16] God gave the stones to rebuild our lives
[1:09:18] we put them in place in our lives
[1:09:21] friends under Zer robable the ministry
[1:09:23] restoration he's given us the tools and
[1:09:26] the things that we need to rebuild a
[1:09:29] family to restore Faith to restore us
[1:09:32] back to a fully matured Sons and
[1:09:35] Daughters of God today he's given us all
[1:09:38] what we
[1:09:39] need but we have to put it in place we
[1:09:43] have to put those stones in place like I
[1:09:45] told a SI young sister the other night
[1:09:47] is that if God puts a stone in front of
[1:09:51] your path a stone is a revelation a rock
[1:09:53] has a revelation don't worry about what
[1:09:55] you're not doing yet what you're not
[1:09:57] seeing Oh I need need to do this just
[1:09:59] step on that stone if it's from God and
[1:10:01] stand on that Revelation and watch for
[1:10:04] the next one to pop out and God will
[1:10:05] show you next because we live by
[1:10:07] Revelation amen God's given us these
[1:10:10] stones to build to build people of Faith
[1:10:14] to build the bride for the last days to
[1:10:16] build
[1:10:18] families restoration reconciliation he's
[1:10:21] given us the tools to do and he's given
[1:10:24] us the building temples for Jesus to
[1:10:26] live in stone by Stone Faith virtue
[1:10:29] knowledge Stone by Stone Faith virtue
[1:10:32] knowledge Temperance patience the statue
[1:10:34] of a perect man that great stone that he
[1:10:36] talks about in Zachariah great stone
[1:10:39] with cry's Grace Grace unto it that
[1:10:41] great and that Capstone love coming on
[1:10:43] it he's building us into the people of
[1:10:46] God by those virtues of Faith virtue
[1:10:48] knowledge Temperance patience brotherly
[1:10:51] kindness every day things happen in the
[1:10:53] whole home and you can either act like
[1:10:56] the world or you can yield to God to say
[1:10:59] God build the stones of Faith virtue
[1:11:02] knowledge Temperance patience in me you
[1:11:04] need more patience or your kid needs it
[1:11:08] pray and say God help us to place that
[1:11:10] stone in our lives need more brotherly
[1:11:13] kindness some of your teenagers need
[1:11:15] more brotherly kindness or sisterly
[1:11:17] kindness you need more virtue you need
[1:11:20] more faith you need more knowledge
[1:11:22] patience Temperance charity brother
[1:11:26] Donnie had a great message on charity
[1:11:27] last Saturday night you should listen to
[1:11:29] it you'd be surprised what charity is
[1:11:31] and how it acts according to 1
[1:11:33] Corinthians
[1:11:34] 13 it's the
[1:11:36] Capstone we need charity in our lives we
[1:11:40] need to put it
[1:11:41] on what is your family goal what do you
[1:11:44] want to accomplish for him what's your
[1:11:47] family
[1:11:49] Vision man got make some money
[1:11:55] send the kids to college and I don't
[1:11:57] know after that I think you should pray
[1:11:59] and get a little better Family Vision
[1:12:01] than
[1:12:02] that teach your kids to have a f better
[1:12:05] Family Vision Without A Vision the
[1:12:06] people perish we're today in the work of
[1:12:10] taking this message and watching the
[1:12:11] Holy Ghost build a people unto himself
[1:12:15] and if families could catch that Vision
[1:12:18] then I believe that it will put them in
[1:12:20] a channel that God can do the work in
[1:12:22] your life and to bring you to that
[1:12:24] Perfection and that place that you want
[1:12:26] to come to that the Holy Ghost is really
[1:12:28] using your family for something for his
[1:12:31] kingdom and that's what we should desire
[1:12:33] can you say amen I pulled a lifetime
[1:12:36] vision statement of our family this kind
[1:12:38] of a intimate close thing to us I wrote
[1:12:40] several years ago and I'm not reading
[1:12:43] for you to copy this at all but I wrote
[1:12:47] this years ago family mission statement
[1:12:48] we will honor and obey the word of God
[1:12:50] in all that we say and
[1:12:52] do
[1:12:54] Christ will be the center and unseen
[1:12:56] guest in our home haven't even had a
[1:12:59] chance to put this up on a uh a picture
[1:13:02] or something but I like to put it up in
[1:13:04] words on the
[1:13:05] wall we will live the example and the
[1:13:10] life of Jesus Christ to those around us
[1:13:12] serving the body of Christ and not
[1:13:14] ourselves will be our utmost
[1:13:18] priority we will strive for perfect
[1:13:20] Oneness in Christ in our marriage and
[1:13:23] our
[1:13:25] family what's our
[1:13:27] values we always live for others
[1:13:29] starting with our own family members in
[1:13:32] our treatment of each other we will
[1:13:33] maintain the highest level of respect
[1:13:35] including not falsely
[1:13:39] accusing not raising our voice in
[1:13:43] Anger not putting each other down and
[1:13:47] this applies to any other people as
[1:13:49] well say brother Paul how do you get
[1:13:52] that well we may not have it all yet but
[1:13:54] I think it's good to set a goal based
[1:13:56] upon the word of God I think it's good
[1:13:58] to put it before us that's where we're
[1:14:01] headed that's what Christ expects of us
[1:14:03] that's what he'd like to see living
[1:14:05] through us as he lives in our lives uh
[1:14:08] being in church when the doors are open
[1:14:09] is one of our one of our priorities in
[1:14:11] life unless an absolute emergency no
[1:14:13] event will be placed instead of church
[1:14:15] we will limit what is purchased with
[1:14:17] credit most purchases will be done
[1:14:18] because of the cash has been saved to do
[1:14:20] so money is a tool we use for life and
[1:14:22] we should always be in control of it
[1:14:24] money should never control us or our
[1:14:27] emotions what we receive we consider a
[1:14:29] gift from God and we seek to take care
[1:14:32] of it and be a wise Steward over it
[1:14:33] stand with me if I read as I read the
[1:14:35] rest of this I don't want you
[1:14:38] to what we received we consider a gift
[1:14:41] from God and we'll seek to take care of
[1:14:43] it and be a wise Steward over it
[1:14:45] decisions are made only after prayer
[1:14:47] major decisions are not made until
[1:14:50] thorough research as to the best
[1:14:52] decision counsel from our accountability
[1:14:54] Partners in a time of much prayer time
[1:14:57] is one of God's greatest tools to swow
[1:14:58] his perfect will the children are to
[1:15:01] fully obey the leadership and correction
[1:15:03] of parents Disobedience will be punished
[1:15:06] one warning is allowed and then judgment
[1:15:08] warning then judgment the children's
[1:15:11] priority in younger years is education
[1:15:13] in school and godly principles of Life
[1:15:15] other social events or entertainments
[1:15:17] are always a reward after school and
[1:15:19] other work is done entertainments and
[1:15:21] relaxing time are small portion of life
[1:15:24] to enjoy never in
[1:15:26] excess honesty Integrity love joy peace
[1:15:30] longsuffering faithfulness and respect
[1:15:32] are foundations for our family and
[1:15:35] should never be
[1:15:36] compromised any influence of people or
[1:15:39] things with an evil spirit to break the
[1:15:41] Oneness of our family will not be
[1:15:43] welcome in our home as the children grow
[1:15:46] into young adulthood the parents will
[1:15:48] still be involved in the choice of
[1:15:50] Associates and friends no serious
[1:15:52] relationship with the opposite sex will
[1:15:54] be allowed until 18 years of age this is
[1:15:56] to ensure a happy undistracted young
[1:15:59] adulthood and preparation for marriage
[1:16:02] and life in future
[1:16:04] years the vision for the family the
[1:16:06] vision of our family will be aligned
[1:16:08] with the vision of God for the times we
[1:16:10] live in God has a purpose God has a
[1:16:12] message for every generation and any
[1:16:15] goal or dream or purpose we pursue will
[1:16:18] fit in with God's achievement for the
[1:16:21] day he revealed that purpose through a
[1:16:23] prophet according to Malachi 4:5 and6 he
[1:16:26] began that purpose by using this Prophet
[1:16:28] to fulfill Revelations 10:7 the steals
[1:16:30] taken off the book of redemption and the
[1:16:32] Mystery of God being finished this book
[1:16:35] being opened will prepare and bring a
[1:16:37] bride to Perfection and maturity to be
[1:16:39] married to a Son of God to the Son of
[1:16:41] God washed in the word without spot or
[1:16:43] blemish we become carriers of these
[1:16:46] Mysteries and Proclaim them to this
[1:16:49] Final Destination in any way that we can
[1:16:52] we we are the final voice to the final
[1:16:55] age you say well that seemed kind of
[1:16:56] heavy I wrote that when the kids were
[1:16:58] little that seems kind of heavy but it's
[1:17:00] the vision for the hour and I want them
[1:17:01] to hear it amen they might not
[1:17:04] understand it all but that's what God
[1:17:05] has done and that's the times God's
[1:17:07] placed Us in and I want them to know
[1:17:10] that we are a part of this building can
[1:17:13] you say Amen we're part of the message
[1:17:15] we're part of what God wanted to achieve
[1:17:17] for this hour and I believe that's what
[1:17:19] Nehemiah was trying to say Hey listen
[1:17:22] put your word towards the work of the
[1:17:23] Lord here and God will bless you and do
[1:17:26] it together as a family do it together
[1:17:29] as a
[1:17:32] family praise the Lord would you pray
[1:17:34] with
[1:17:37] me would you raise your hand if you want
[1:17:39] prayer
[1:17:40] tonight would you lift your voice and
[1:17:42] pray with me this evening Heavenly
[1:17:44] Father your goodness to us Lord is just
[1:17:47] been abundant and we have enjoyed being
[1:17:49] able to learn from your word in this
[1:17:51] simple way father I pray it is simple to
[1:17:54] the people Lord not trying to bring it
[1:17:56] in some great Revelation or something
[1:17:58] Lord that's ununderstandable but Lord we
[1:18:01] can be practical so that Lord the
[1:18:03] families can be blessed bless every
[1:18:05] family Lord no matter what condition
[1:18:07] what place that they're in what stage
[1:18:09] Lord how their family would be single
[1:18:11] families whatever it would be we pray
[1:18:13] that you will bless them encourage them
[1:18:15] in the things of the lord lord what a
[1:18:17] great thing that Nehemiah did that day
[1:18:19] when he gathered all the children with
[1:18:20] each family and said you work on this
[1:18:23] wall together you stand there and hold
[1:18:25] your weapons in your hand and be ready
[1:18:27] for the enemy but work on it together so
[1:18:29] the children can see this family has a
[1:18:31] purpose and that's fulfilling the word
[1:18:33] of God for our day that they can look
[1:18:35] back one day and see that wall finished
[1:18:38] see all the sance and all the influences
[1:18:40] trying to come against it they can look
[1:18:42] back those children can see look what
[1:18:44] God has done through our family
[1:18:46] finishing the work of God what a blessed
[1:18:48] thing that would be Lord and I pray at
[1:18:50] the end of the road my family would be
[1:18:52] able to to look together and say the god
[1:18:56] of Glory has accomplished helping Souls
[1:18:59] helping somebody for the kingdom helping
[1:19:02] somebody along the way Lord building
[1:19:05] these building stones into our lives
[1:19:07] Lord let them see what the work you can
[1:19:10] do father Lord many families starting up
[1:19:13] and just beginning and young children I
[1:19:15] just pray you'll bless them Lord each
[1:19:18] one that they catch the vision for this
