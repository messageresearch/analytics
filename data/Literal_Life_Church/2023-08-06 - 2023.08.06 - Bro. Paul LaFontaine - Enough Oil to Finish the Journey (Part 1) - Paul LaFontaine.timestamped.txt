[0:00] outcome
[0:01] you know I I can't help but mention
[0:04] what's happened this week in the
[0:05] incident with sister Kelly and she's
[0:07] here this morning which surprises me
[0:09] actually but I just want to ask this do
[0:12] you would you like to get up and share
[0:14] your testimony this week of God's
[0:16] protection or do you want me to read
[0:18] your text I'll give you the choice
[0:21] or say no to both
[0:24] this is just too good this is too good
[0:26] to pass up
[0:28] and just when you just when the devil
[0:36] just when the devil starts to put Little
[0:39] voices in our mind that somehow God
[0:41] isn't watching over us as Angels aren't
[0:43] around you have an incident like this
[0:45] this week and it becomes crystal clear
[0:47] to Sister Kelly it should be crystal
[0:49] clear to us don't you ever believe that
[0:51] lie
[0:53] the Bible says angels are encamped
[0:55] around those that fear Him He knows
[0:57] what's going on he'll watch over us
[0:59] he'll protect us praise the Lord
[1:04] well I can certainly say it is a
[1:06] pleasure to be here
[1:08] I was thinking about this on the way I
[1:10] was like how do you condense that you
[1:12] know but um so take your time off I'll
[1:15] cut into my sermon a little bit
[1:19] um so long story short is as most of you
[1:22] know this some of you don't but I am an
[1:24] Outreach marketer so I drive a lot
[1:27] and we were having a car show at work I
[1:30] travel an hour to work and
[1:33] had been Marketing in Adrian and I was
[1:36] running five minutes late
[1:44] whether naturally or spiritually are
[1:47] God's hand
[1:51] so I made it and I was five minutes from
[1:54] work
[1:56] and I was listening to a sermon and I
[1:59] had I told Brother Paul that
[2:01] God was kind of digging into my life and
[2:05] I appreciate that because sometimes you
[2:06] need God to dig into your life you know
[2:08] and he was digging in and just kind of
[2:11] rooting everything out and I was having
[2:13] Church in my car and I was like I'm like
[2:16] I'm running late for this car show and
[2:17] I'm like I'm gonna pull over I'm gonna
[2:19] pull over and I'm gonna pray and I was
[2:21] just repenting of things and getting
[2:23] things cleaned out and I thank God for
[2:25] that
[2:26] um that was just God's mercy but
[2:29] I had been driving down the road and I
[2:33] heard sirens coming up behind me and I
[2:36] pulled over and I'm like I wasn't
[2:37] speeding you know was I speeding
[2:39] sometimes when I'm having church I speed
[2:41] you know
[2:43] you don't know that
[2:47] so I um I pulled over and the police
[2:50] officer zoomed past me and um
[2:53] again I wasn't paying attention I pulled
[2:55] back out but that slowed me down too
[2:58] slowed my speed down
[3:00] and I looked up ahead and I saw the cops
[3:04] Circle back and I'm looking at it
[3:06] because I see all these lights flashing
[3:08] in the distance and
[3:10] um before I knew it I saw a car coming
[3:12] straight at me in my Lane
[3:14] and I'm like
[3:16] you you know things happen so fast
[3:18] you're not you don't have time to
[3:19] process and I looked at him and I could
[3:22] see him in his windshield and he was not
[3:24] slowing down
[3:25] like at all
[3:27] and before I knew it he hit me head on
[3:32] and all I remember is the impact and the
[3:34] airbags going off and I could feel the
[3:37] car just sliding and sliding and it just
[3:39] kept sliding
[3:42] and all of a sudden I came to and I was
[3:44] like what just happened and the first
[3:46] thing you're thinking is you know what's
[3:48] going on what's wrong and um I managed
[3:50] to get out of the car
[3:52] and get on the ground and I was I looked
[3:55] over and all of a sudden all these cop
[3:57] cars were everywhere like usually you
[3:59] have one or two you know there's cops
[4:01] everywhere there was and I looked behind
[4:03] me and there was a guy the guy who hit
[4:06] me on the ground cops were over him his
[4:10] face was on the ground they were
[4:11] arresting him and I thought to myself I
[4:13] thought well this is
[4:14] he must have really done something to
[4:16] Merit this kind of you know reaction
[4:21] and all of a sudden there was SWAT teams
[4:23] there was all this stuff long story
[4:26] short I got they took me to the hospital
[4:28] but on the way to the hospital
[4:30] uh before the hospital he was yelling at
[4:32] me and he was saying um he's like they
[4:34] were taken with a cop car and he goes
[4:36] I'm sorry I'm sorry I was trying to kill
[4:38] myself
[4:40] and I just looked at him in the cop
[4:42] beside me just like don't even pay
[4:43] attention
[4:45] don't pay attention to him and I got to
[4:47] in the I got in the ambulance and the
[4:50] paramedic said to me he says do you know
[4:52] what happened and I'm like not really
[4:54] you know and he says well he just tried
[4:56] to kill three people
[4:58] shoot them
[5:00] and I thought okay oh my gosh okay so I
[5:03] went to the hospital they had to I'd
[5:06] have a full CT scan and a bunch of
[5:09] X-rays and everything and I'm getting
[5:11] this text message from work where
[5:13] they're like well
[5:15] um
[5:16] you know there's a lot of commotion
[5:17] going on and I'm thinking oh they must
[5:19] know about the shooter
[5:21] here to find out he had open fire at the
[5:24] car show
[5:25] at my work
[5:28] and
[5:29] the employees were parked at a parking
[5:32] lot on the other side and all the
[5:34] classic cars were going to be in the
[5:35] parking lot of the building and it was a
[5:38] domestic dispute and he was waiting on
[5:39] an employee
[5:41] and he opened fire
[5:43] and he did kill her
[5:46] she didn't survive the night
[5:48] he shot another family member's son
[5:52] damaged his arm and then he took off and
[5:56] just so happened to hit me head on
[5:58] but it allowed him to be apprehended
[6:01] which was the grace of God as well
[6:03] they said that I had just purchased this
[6:05] car two weeks ago my little bumblebee it
[6:08] was yellow
[6:10] and they said that the car
[6:13] being the size it was and this the uh
[6:16] the build it was saved my life
[6:20] and I really truly believe that that was
[6:22] the Lord because I had felt led to sell
[6:24] my car my other car and God opened a
[6:27] door for that and um
[6:29] and they said just the fact that you
[6:30] came out of it they estimated that he
[6:32] hit mid 85 miles per hour
[6:34] and the fact that I came through that
[6:36] was just a miracle of God's grace and
[6:40] his protection and his you know that's
[6:43] how quick your life can just be snuffed
[6:45] out and you want your heart right with
[6:47] the Lord you want everything right with
[6:50] the Lord like I've come to realize
[6:52] nothing else matters
[6:54] nothing matters
[6:56] but the Lord
[6:58] and his grace
[7:00] and I'm so thankful and I just wanted to
[7:02] say this last thing and then I'll shut
[7:03] up
[7:05] um I had a lot of phone calls and my
[7:09] employees are traumatized some of my
[7:10] staff they actually watched him shoot
[7:12] her
[7:13] so they're traumatized and a lot of
[7:15] people call me and they said we're
[7:17] watching the news and we do not see your
[7:19] car
[7:20] we don't see it where is it on the news
[7:23] and the state police called me and they
[7:25] said the funny thing about all of this
[7:27] is from the air from up above
[7:31] your car was hidden under a tree you hit
[7:35] a tree I didn't know I hit a tree
[7:38] you hit a tree and nobody could see you
[7:41] you were hidden
[7:42] from above and a friend of mine said to
[7:44] me that branches of trees often mean
[7:47] wings
[7:48] and I thought about being under his
[7:50] wings that from the above you know
[7:52] sometimes you just see the Collision you
[7:54] just see the crash you see your mistakes
[7:56] you see all the things and God looks
[7:58] down and says yeah but when you're under
[7:59] the blood you are under my wings and so
[8:02] I just really am thankful and I just I'm
[8:04] so thankful for all of you I've been
[8:06] you've all reached out to me and I am
[8:07] just touched by your kindness and your
[8:09] prayers and
[8:11] God is still using me for some reason
[8:14] thank you
[8:22] this one that was shot as your co-worker
[8:25] right yes she was a co-worker and um she
[8:29] had I don't know if she knew the Lord or
[8:30] not but she she had time and she um yeah
[8:35] she was an employee so if you were to
[8:37] write arrive right on time if I would
[8:39] have five minutes later you would have
[8:41] been part of the shooting no doubt yep I
[8:43] would have pulled into the parking lot
[8:45] right when he was shooting her had I
[8:47] been five minutes sooner your mom says
[8:50] you stopped at McDonald's for a drink
[8:52] needed a drink you know
[8:54] and ironically the person in front of me
[8:56] was taking a long
[8:59] time and I was getting annoyed and we
[9:01] get annoyed with our delays you know and
[9:03] I I was like oh I need to go I need to
[9:05] go and God's like you're not going
[9:07] nowhere
[9:08] I just thought of that you don't feel so
[9:11] bad to stop them by McDonald's and it
[9:13] makes me feel good because sometimes you
[9:14] can be in the will of God
[9:19] okay
[9:20] praise the Lord
[9:22] thank you sister Kelly praise the Lord
[9:24] amen
[9:31] I guess I'd like to preach a whole
[9:33] sermon on this but I just thank God that
[9:36] he shows us through these things our
[9:38] lives are in his hands and you know
[9:40] we're in a time where there's
[9:42] nervousness sometimes about our
[9:44] protection year and we've talked a
[9:46] little bit about it and the people that
[9:47] are going into churches and shooters for
[9:49] whatever reason going insane but but you
[9:52] know what and I I was a part of a two or
[9:55] three hour meeting with the deacons a
[9:56] few months ago and we've done everything
[9:58] to talk through scenarios and just talk
[10:01] through different things our brother
[10:02] here from Pennsylvania helps churches
[10:04] and talk about those things because we
[10:05] live in that reality but a greater
[10:07] reality I never want to forget and and
[10:10] for I'll just mention again we have
[10:12] things in place and we have different
[10:13] ones and different a plan but ultimately
[10:16] I am not afraid
[10:19] I'm not afraid because when you have an
[10:21] incident like this God knows what's
[10:23] going to happen and I'd rather be in his
[10:25] protection than any other protection man
[10:27] can offer and and and even so we're not
[10:30] doing enough here I've heard that come
[10:32] back from some we're not doing enough
[10:33] listen uh it's enough with the Lord's
[10:35] protection he knows what's going to
[10:37] happen
[10:38] he'll watch over us and this is an
[10:40] example of that can you say man and I'm
[10:43] glad to be around his angels as
[10:45] protection there's Angels around us and
[10:47] our children because the times we live
[10:49] in we could not get by without it so we
[10:52] rejoice in this testimony I'd like you
[10:54] guys to put that up on Facebook if
[10:56] Sister Kelly doesn't mind I want to tell
[10:57] the world and tell the devil that God is
[11:00] watching over his people I'd like to
[11:03] also say that it is something about when
[11:05] she pulls over and is moved by the
[11:07] message and makes it a priority for God
[11:10] going deeply into her life and she
[11:11] shared more details to me but when
[11:14] someone is being moved by the word and
[11:16] we're willing to repent and go let God
[11:18] go deeper into things even from her
[11:20] childhood she said God dealing with
[11:22] things and are getting it out and she's
[11:24] willing to stop and pray and weep in
[11:26] Brokenness let me tell you something
[11:28] somebody is going that direction the
[11:30] devil's mad
[11:32] if you're gonna do that the devil's
[11:35] going to get angry
[11:36] and and so her doing that to me you're
[11:40] in the light of Duty and brother Ram
[11:41] says when you're in the light of Duty
[11:42] God's going to watch over your life
[11:46] she was in the line of duty what she was
[11:48] doing
[11:49] amen she was right in the perfect will
[11:52] of God and a five-minute delay to pray
[11:55] and deal with something deeply God's
[11:58] hand of protection was around her
[12:00] God was with her can you say amen and
[12:03] sometimes you're in the will of God to
[12:05] stop at McDonald's as well
[12:10] I'll catch that from my wife for saying
[12:13] that
[12:16] praise the Lord God is good amen let's
[12:18] Stand Together read the word together
[12:21] oh let's give him another hand God
[12:23] you're so good praise you to God
[12:28] my my

[13:26] encouraging
[13:27] words from our sister and for her to
[13:30] come out of that alive on so many levels
[13:32] is just God's grace to her and we're
[13:34] grateful Matthew 25 and verse 1 Matthew
[13:38] 25 and verse 1.
[13:42] then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be
[13:44] likened unto ten virgins
[13:47] which took their lamps and went forth to
[13:49] meet the bridegroom and five of them
[13:51] were wise and five were foolish
[13:55] they that were foolish foolish took
[13:57] their lamps and took no oil with them
[14:01] but the wise took oil in their vessels
[14:04] with their lamps while the bridegroom
[14:06] tarried they all slumbered and slept so
[14:09] you notice that the bridegroom coming
[14:11] there was a delay in his coming or there
[14:13] was a a temporary tearing that took
[14:16] place I believe we live during that time
[14:19] while the bridegroom Terry they all
[14:21] slumbered and slept and at midnight
[14:22] there was a cry made behold the
[14:24] bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him
[14:27] then all those virgins arose and trimmed
[14:30] their lamps so all the virgins arose by
[14:33] the Midnight Cry that were getting close
[14:35] and the bridegroom is coming all of them
[14:37] arose and were were stirred by that and
[14:40] the foolish that otherwise give us of
[14:42] your oil for our lamps have gone out but
[14:45] the wise answer is saying not so lest
[14:47] there be not enough for us and you but
[14:51] go rather to them that sell and buy for
[14:54] yourselves and while they went to buy
[14:56] the bridegroom came and they that were
[14:59] ready went in with him to the marriage
[15:01] and the door was shut afterward came
[15:05] also the other virgin saying Lord Lord
[15:07] open to us but he answered and said
[15:10] verily I say unto you I know you not
[15:12] watch therefore for ye know neither the
[15:16] day nor the hour wherein the son of man
[15:19] cometh and we can say Amen to the word
[15:21] of God Amen I want to speak on enough
[15:24] oil to finish the journey enough oil to
[15:28] finish the journey
[15:30] father bless and anoint us Lord as your
[15:33] servant this morning
[15:35] when we speak of oil we speak of your
[15:37] anointing oil that was poured over lord
[15:39] the kings and Lord the prophets and the
[15:43] King David Lord was anointed when he was
[15:46] young even and Lord this spoke of your
[15:48] holy spirit being the thing that
[15:50] separated those men as being their
[15:52] positions Lord when you pour that
[15:54] anointing oil upon them then you
[15:56] separated them for a particular distinct
[15:59] service Lord God I just pray that that
[16:02] would happen here this morning as you
[16:04] set aside this people Lord to be called
[16:07] by your name to be called by the message
[16:09] of the last days but Lord we realize we
[16:12] can't get by without your anointing oil
[16:14] Lord I pray that you'll come and speak
[16:17] through US those anointed words today
[16:18] through your servant I'm weak within
[16:20] myself but I'm strong with the word of
[16:23] God you've given me father and I pray
[16:25] you'll bless every heart and every soul
[16:27] under our care this morning may they be
[16:29] under your care I want to pause and say
[16:31] thank you for the protection over sister
[16:33] Kelly's life Lord
[16:35] and to see that she was in the line of
[16:37] duty following you and obeying you Lord
[16:39] and and just being mindful the spirit
[16:42] Lord and being in the spirit having
[16:44] Church in her car she said Lord these
[16:46] are the things that please you and Lord
[16:48] when we do something that pleases you
[16:50] then you come around and answer
[16:51] supernaturally with your protection and
[16:54] your love over her life God we're
[16:56] thankful that she wasn't no bones were
[16:58] broken father and she could have lost
[17:00] her life in so many ways but God she's
[17:03] here the first Sunday morning worshiping
[17:05] you glad to be alive Lord and so today
[17:08] is a congregation we say thank you thank
[17:12] you Lord for preserving her life and we
[17:15] pray you'll continue to be that over our
[17:16] lives as well we commit the service to
[17:19] you now in Jesus name amen unless you
[17:22] may be seated
[17:31] Matthew 24 and 25
[17:34] in the Bible we have Jesus giving the
[17:36] prophecy of the 2000 years after he is
[17:39] gone
[17:40] and particularly their prophecies and
[17:42] specifics about the end time and this is
[17:45] why these scriptures should be very
[17:46] important to us and any Christian really
[17:49] should be interested in Matthew 24 and
[17:52] 25 as Jesus begins to break really the
[17:55] Seven Seals uh in his own way and the
[17:58] way he did it John has the Seven Seals
[18:00] and by Vision at the Book of Revelations
[18:02] but Jesus actually Expresses in Matthew
[18:05] 24 and 25 uh all Seven Seals and you can
[18:08] take what he says and and put it place
[18:10] it right on the seals in the Book of
[18:12] Revelations and so he's he's elaborating
[18:15] and speaking Prophecy of the specifics
[18:18] of what will happen in the end time and
[18:21] when you get to the very end though
[18:23] which is what we live in when you get to
[18:25] the very end because he had just said a
[18:28] few scriptures earlier he said no man
[18:30] knows the day or the hour no man knows
[18:32] the day of the hour this is a secret
[18:34] that God the final end the final hour
[18:36] the final time of his coming he keeps it
[18:40] secret only the father knows and so it's
[18:42] not something that he would reveal and
[18:45] make it plain here because that's
[18:47] something that's only going to be
[18:48] revealed in Rapture time it's only going
[18:50] to be revealed to the to the to the
[18:52] bride in other words this isn't
[18:54] something that everybody will know and
[18:56] because they know what they can be a
[18:58] part of this will be the secret part and
[19:01] so the seventh seal will be a secret
[19:02] which is the coming of the Lord don't
[19:05] get lost in the terminology here I want
[19:07] to explain it so even a 13 year old can
[19:09] understand this morning Jesus is
[19:11] speaking of all the end time events but
[19:13] when we get to the very end then he
[19:16] breaks in Matthew 25 he breaks into
[19:18] Parables for the seventh seal so and he
[19:21] had to do that because that's the one
[19:23] that's secret that's the one that's
[19:25] hidden and so all the others he's being
[19:28] specific about but when he breaks into
[19:29] the seventh that's when you find Matthew
[19:31] 25 and that's when you find the seventh
[19:34] seal hidden in Parables but how many
[19:36] knows that Jesus said about Parables
[19:38] when he was asked by the disciples why
[19:40] do you speak in Parables he said because
[19:42] it's given unto you to know the
[19:44] mysteries of God it's not given to
[19:46] everybody but it's given to you so if he
[19:49] breaks into Parables for the seventh
[19:51] seal I'll tell you our curiosity are we
[19:54] ought to be sitting at the edge of our
[19:55] seat saying what does this mean because
[19:56] this is where I live right now I'm at
[19:59] the end time God's not called me to
[20:00] Luther's day or Wesley's day he's called
[20:02] me to write at the closing seconds of
[20:05] time and I want to catch this mystery of
[20:07] what God's doing
[20:09] and so the you know the rest of the
[20:11] world may not care about Matthew 25
[20:12] although there is a curiosity there's
[20:15] always a curiosity for man to know the
[20:17] day or to know the hour the devil would
[20:20] like to know the actual day and the
[20:22] actual hour of the coming of the Lord
[20:23] all men have wanted and and Scholars
[20:27] would love to know that but God says
[20:29] that's something I'm going to hold and
[20:31] I'm going to break it into three
[20:32] Parables and I'm going to Parables to
[20:35] the young people parables are like
[20:36] stories and they're things that are
[20:38] speaking of something else and these
[20:40] Parables speak of the coming of the Lord
[20:42] for the seventh seal to be hidden by a
[20:45] parable every Christian should pay close
[20:47] attention then to this scripture and
[20:50] these Parables when God breaks open the
[20:52] mystery of the seventh seal then that
[20:55] should perk our attention can you say
[20:57] Amen because that's you know why I'm
[20:59] interested in it because that's the part
[21:01] of the book that I'm a part of is the
[21:03] last minutes of time the last seconds of
[21:06] time just before the day and the hour
[21:07] I'm living in that time and so when he
[21:10] speaks of these things I'm interested
[21:12] because I know that's the part of the
[21:14] book if you get a chance listen to
[21:15] Wednesday night because that's this book
[21:17] of redemption that has our names in it
[21:19] has our place in it and that's your true
[21:21] identity we spoke of those things
[21:23] Wednesday night I know where my identity
[21:25] is I don't live in Luther's day I don't
[21:27] live in Jesus day my day is right now
[21:30] right before the Rapture that's my time
[21:32] and that's where my name is in the Book
[21:34] of Life
[21:36] and so I had to catch that Ministry
[21:38] while it's going on how many would like
[21:40] to catch the mystery of the rapture
[21:42] that's only for the bride can you say
[21:44] man that's one I want to definitely
[21:46] catch it's a revelation that's one
[21:48] Revelation I want to get is the
[21:49] Revelation for the rapture
[21:52] Hallelujah so now the first Parable in
[21:55] Matthew 25 is very revealing as it
[21:58] covers virgins starting a journey toward
[22:02] meeting the bridegroom well that's
[22:03] perfect because we know at the end of
[22:06] the book there's a marriage we know
[22:07] enough scriptures to know there's a
[22:09] marriage between Christ and his bride so
[22:11] now in the parable it's perfect because
[22:13] you have virgins starting a journey
[22:15] toward meeting the bridegroom they start
[22:18] not the rest of the world but these
[22:19] virgins these sanctified people these
[22:22] Christians they say my it's time for the
[22:24] bridegroom to come and so there's a call
[22:26] go ye out to meet him and I'm going to
[22:28] begin this journey and this of course so
[22:31] the children understand the bridegroom
[22:33] is the type of Christ that's Christ and
[22:36] then there's not one virgin but there's
[22:38] ten virgins and why why wouldn't you say
[22:40] well there's just one because usually a
[22:42] man marries just one woman in this
[22:44] Parable there's ten virgins because we
[22:47] are a many-membered bride it's not just
[22:49] one person but we're a mini member and
[22:51] bride so that's why it says 10 has many
[22:54] can you say Amen so showing it will be a
[22:57] mini-membered bride not one person it's
[22:59] perfect because at the end there's a
[23:02] marriage spoken of throughout the Bible
[23:03] and I'll just say these things Paul said
[23:05] I have espoused you to one husband he's
[23:08] starting to use the term he said I've
[23:11] come and brought the message Paul said
[23:13] and I've espoused you there's an
[23:15] engagement and I've espoused you not to
[23:18] many husbands but to one husband so
[23:20] there's a marriage going to take place
[23:22] there's a courtship there's an
[23:23] engagement and there's a marriage and
[23:25] the end time supposed to take place and
[23:28] so then we then we find that Paul uh
[23:30] said I have a spouse you to one husband
[23:32] he also said in Ephesians that God would
[23:35] have a glorious bride without spot
[23:37] without wrinkle he will prepare himself
[23:40] a spotless bride to marry and she'll be
[23:43] without blemish I mean he's familiar
[23:45] with that scripture
[23:47] so that he will provide the atonement to
[23:49] sanctify this bride and he sanctifies
[23:53] her so that he can marry her it's almost
[23:55] like creating your virginity because we
[23:57] know in our flesh we weren't born
[23:59] virgins we were born with a sin nature
[24:01] but by the power of the word he creates
[24:04] our virginity and shows us what we were
[24:06] from the foundation of the world that
[24:08] before sin came in the picture I was in
[24:10] the mind of God thus I'm a virgin unto
[24:12] the Lord because he Sanctified my life
[24:16] that's power friends when you're
[24:18] creating virginity
[24:20] but he says I'll wash her I'll make her
[24:22] a spotless Pride before I marry so then
[24:24] he he she will be a virgin and then when
[24:28] you go to the Book of Revelations it
[24:30] says the marriage of the Lamb has come
[24:32] and the pride hath made herself ready
[24:36] praise be to God lay in some
[24:38] foundational things that at the end it's
[24:41] about a marriage
[24:43] at the end time it's about a spiritual
[24:45] union with you and Christ
[24:49] that's what it's about that's what the
[24:51] parable speaks of and so now the
[24:53] marriage has come brida made herself
[24:55] ready the end time is not you know it's
[24:57] about a marriage it's not about a it's
[24:59] not about a a dating relationship with
[25:02] Christ
[25:03] when it gets to the end it's not this
[25:06] casual dating of Christ or a part-time
[25:10] on-again off-again relationship with
[25:13] Jesus Christ can I get an amen
[25:16] you may be God maybe have winked at your
[25:19] ignorance in past days about that but
[25:20] not today we're not called to a dating
[25:22] relationship we're not called to to to
[25:25] come in relationship at a camp meeting
[25:27] with them and get all stirred up and
[25:29] then we we deny him later while we're at
[25:31] school we're not called to a dating
[25:33] relationship we're not called to a a
[25:36] clicking uh on again off of him I'm in a
[25:39] relationship you click the button and
[25:40] you're in a relationship two weeks later
[25:42] you unclick say I'm out of a
[25:44] relationship that's not that's this
[25:46] generation how they go about
[25:47] relationships
[25:48] might as well take a minute and say this
[25:51] generation has cheapened relationship
[25:53] has cheapened marriage has cheapened
[25:56] commitment
[25:57] friends are not committed anymore within
[25:59] a drop of the house somebody drops a
[26:01] friendship there's no loyalty can you
[26:03] because it's an adulterous generation
[26:05] and nobody's loyal to one husband or one
[26:08] spouse or one person for life completely
[26:11] for life it's in and out if I Don't Feel
[26:13] Like Loving in you anymore I'll just
[26:15] drop out of the relationship I'll just
[26:16] divorce you it's a divorce generation
[26:19] and spiritually it's a divorce
[26:21] generation because people go to a cat
[26:23] meeting go to a meeting they they give
[26:25] themselves okay I'm all excited and then
[26:27] all of a sudden they're right back to
[26:28] the things of the world that's not a
[26:30] marriage relationship
[26:32] I'm gonna preach this morning that's not
[26:34] a marriage relationship in the end time
[26:37] it's not a dating relationship it's not
[26:40] an on-again off-again I kind of come and
[26:42] go as I and commun and people approach
[26:44] church that way as well
[26:46] if it's convenient for me if it fits
[26:48] around all all of my schedule then I'll
[26:51] be there but no uh this is a marriage
[26:54] can you say of mine this is not about
[26:56] church attendance this is a union
[26:58] between you and Christ
[27:02] Hallelujah this is an eternal Union of
[27:06] your soul
[27:07] this is not a dating game
[27:09] it's not clicking on and off this is a
[27:12] union that seals you into a marriage for
[27:15] life and there is no returning to other
[27:17] lovers that's it
[27:19] you make a vow to Christ and you're
[27:21] coming Union with him it's a marriage
[27:24] it's more than a feeling more than an
[27:26] infatuation can you say amount it's more
[27:29] than a Disney love
[27:31] this is the Disney generation
[27:34] and love has been interpreted and
[27:36] relationships have been interpreted by
[27:38] Disney and by Hollywood
[27:41] and then they spill that over into their
[27:43] relationship with Christ so I can just
[27:45] take you or leave you if I don't feel it
[27:48] amen
[27:50] my wife had sent me something here and
[27:52] and I I was going to read sister Kelly's
[27:56] thing off my phone forgive me for one
[27:58] service having my phone the deacons
[28:00] don't want us to have our phone in
[28:01] church
[28:02] so forgive me but my wife sent me this I
[28:04] don't know if you got it but I just
[28:06] thought this is amazing because it's
[28:08] such a generation living on feelings and
[28:10] then interpreting this this fellow John
[28:12] Piper says my feelings are not God God
[28:14] is God
[28:16] my feelings do not Define truth
[28:19] God's word defines truth
[28:21] my feelings are echoes and responses to
[28:24] what my mind perceives and sometimes
[28:26] many times my feelings are out of sync
[28:29] with truth
[28:33] when that happens and it happens every
[28:35] day in some measure I try not to bend
[28:37] the truth to justify my imperfect
[28:40] feelings but rather I plead with God
[28:43] purify my perceptions of your truth and
[28:46] transform my feelings so that they are
[28:49] in sync with the truth
[28:53] what you feel is not to be interpreted
[28:55] as truth your conclusion based upon your
[28:58] feelings and we do not approach our
[29:01] relationship with Christ with feelings
[29:03] because you may not have the right
[29:05] feelings tomorrow morning this is not a
[29:08] romance where I don't feel it anymore
[29:10] I'm not feeling I've had men come down
[29:12] I'm going to divorce my wife even in
[29:13] this church I've lost my love for I've
[29:15] lost my love while you didn't have the
[29:17] right love in the beginning
[29:19] you didn't have the commitment of the
[29:20] building beginning because someday the
[29:22] feelings will be gone that all that
[29:24] might be gone and your life's trials my
[29:27] challenge but the commitment still
[29:29] stands
[29:35] it's more than an infatuation it's more
[29:37] than a feeling it's more than Disney
[29:39] love
[29:40] praise the Lord so it's a many member
[29:43] bride but yet this Parable says they're
[29:45] split into two categories
[29:48] I didn't split them up
[29:50] God split them up
[29:53] and this this uh splitting into
[29:56] categories
[29:57] God split them into two wise virgins and
[30:00] foolish virgins he's the one that split
[30:03] it up and that's relevant to the end
[30:04] time because it and that that comes in
[30:08] direct conflict with the ecumenical
[30:11] Antichrist spirit
[30:13] that says we're all the same
[30:17] and if you believe in Christ we're all
[30:20] the same
[30:21] and Jesus teaches it different in the
[30:24] end time we'll all come together in a
[30:26] great Oneness with one another and we
[30:28] all believe Christ that we're all the
[30:29] same
[30:30] in my heart I want to believe that and
[30:33] in my heart I don't have a right to
[30:35] categorize people I don't have a right
[30:37] to judge people say you're a foolish
[30:39] virgin you're a wise virgin we don't
[30:41] personally have a right to do that even
[30:42] though we do it sometimes I don't like
[30:44] to be put in a category you don't like
[30:46] to be equipped in a category but we
[30:48] don't have a right as another person to
[30:49] put another person out or put them in
[30:51] your your serpent seat we don't have a
[30:53] right to do that but God God has a plan
[30:57] and God throughout his scriptures God
[31:00] has definitely had categories maybe this
[31:03] is why people don't like God is that
[31:05] they're put into categories sometimes
[31:07] I think God does it to show hey
[31:10] uh
[31:11] if you realize you're not where you need
[31:13] to be then God can give you
[31:16] and at the end of uh three kinds of
[31:18] Believers which if that's God's nature
[31:20] to split people into categories like
[31:22] that even though he offers to whosoever
[31:24] will three kinds of Believers in every
[31:27] Cog in every group of people make
[31:29] Believers unbelievers and True Believers
[31:31] but at the end of that sermon the grace
[31:33] of God says if you've recognize yourself
[31:36] as an unbeliever this morning then come
[31:38] to an altar in your heart come to an
[31:40] altar and say God I cry out to you make
[31:42] me a believer
[31:44] the grace of God is there
[31:46] if your life has all the fruits of
[31:48] serpent seed and worldliness then that's
[31:50] the time you say oh God have mercy on me
[31:53] fill me with your spirit
[31:56] and I just got to believe because we're
[31:58] not out of here yet God will respond to
[32:01] the Cry of every heart
[32:05] and I'm glad of that can you say Amen
[32:08] but he's the one that split it up and
[32:10] and the thing that says we are all one
[32:13] if we believe Jesus Christ we're all the
[32:15] same Jesus taught that the different
[32:16] seeds where they fell in the ground he
[32:18] taught that Jesus said to the religious
[32:20] people you're of your father the devil
[32:23] not your being you're you're acting like
[32:26] the devil you're the sons of the devil
[32:27] that's pretty straight it was the Bible
[32:30] that said that Jacob have I loved and
[32:32] Esau have I hated
[32:35] it was Paul who taught the seed shall
[32:38] not be Heir with the shock it was that's
[32:40] all Bible can you say Amen the seed and
[32:42] these are all around the Realms of
[32:44] Christians the seed the Pentecostal
[32:46] shark the seeds shall not be here with a
[32:48] shark he made the distinctions and even
[32:50] at the end time through the prophet the
[32:52] three kinds of Believers so it's not
[32:54] surprising that in a parable about the
[32:56] last few minutes on God's clock there's
[32:59] two groups one wise and one foolish
[33:03] that's what the word of God says but
[33:06] notice all the virgins all started out
[33:10] on a journey to go meet the bridegroom
[33:14] all heard the Midnight Cry Now friends
[33:18] I'm telling you this Parable is not
[33:21] talking about out there
[33:24] it's pretty internal
[33:27] because they're all hearing the Midnight
[33:30] Cry now it's time go ye out to meet him
[33:33] possibly sitting in the same group
[33:35] hearing the same preaching
[33:39] all were stirred out of their sleeping
[33:42] all were stirred up by the word by the
[33:45] Midnight Cry all of them got up and were
[33:47] awoken by the cry all of them got up and
[33:51] all of them trimmed their lamps
[33:55] which is part of the process of
[33:57] spiritually trimming a lamps you can
[33:59] have a lamp a vessel and the vessel
[34:02] speaks of Your Vessel for the Lord this
[34:04] vessel and so you can have a vessel but
[34:06] you see you've got a a wick in there if
[34:09] you guys want to show that picture of uh
[34:11] just so we have a visual for the young
[34:12] people and everybody else uh this is
[34:14] kind of what it looked like back in
[34:15] Jerusalem the days of Jerusalem is kind
[34:17] of what it looked like and this is what
[34:18] he's speaking of in the parable is that
[34:20] you got a vessel you got the oil in the
[34:22] vessel and then you got something
[34:23] sticking out the wick sticking out the
[34:25] end and this is the type of thing if you
[34:27] didn't uh and maybe some of you know
[34:29] this most people know this if you don't
[34:30] keep that trimmed at the end it won't
[34:33] burn right like that and if it doesn't
[34:35] burn bright in the darkness you won't be
[34:38] able to see
[34:40] so there's some components there and for
[34:42] the parable all the components are there
[34:45] as far as trimming the laps they Rose
[34:47] it's dark out it's midnight it's become
[34:49] gross Darkness upon the people it's a
[34:51] dark time how many how many would say
[34:53] say I in the last two years we're living
[34:56] in darker times I'm feeling it in my
[34:59] spirit
[35:00] if you got any God about you you know
[35:02] this is different now we're in different
[35:04] territory this is dark dark times we're
[35:07] living in it's not like 30 years ago
[35:08] when we tend to Camp so went to meetings
[35:10] this is a darkness that is set into us
[35:13] people are questioning where they stand
[35:15] people are fighting mind battles can you
[35:17] say man we're in a different time which
[35:20] lets us know we need to trim our Labs we
[35:23] need the oil like we've never needed it
[35:26] before
[35:27] we need to be established and know that
[35:29] we have a reserve of oil back can you
[35:32] say mine
[35:33] or we won't make it through this
[35:35] Darkness
[35:36] oh Darkness Darkness Darkness so much
[35:39] out there you know a few weeks ago that
[35:41] all the writers in Hollywood went on
[35:43] strike in New York they were on strike
[35:45] and they were saying in the news this is
[35:46] bad because this shuts down all new
[35:49] movies being written and I raised my
[35:51] hand I said praise be to God let it
[35:54] happen forever
[35:57] that no more trash could come from that
[35:59] place in California and New York because
[36:02] that's been the major cause of Mines
[36:04] people feeding out even Christians
[36:06] feeding on it that's been the cause of
[36:08] this Darkness
[36:10] Minds can't think clearly anymore
[36:13] because you've been fed Hollywood
[36:16] praise the Lord amen and so
[36:20] it got quiet right there
[36:23] okay
[36:24] I'll get quiet too I'll take a drink
[36:30] if you don't know what's real getting
[36:31] more dark you better get on your feet
[36:33] and recognize
[36:35] this Darkness right I've been a
[36:37] Christian since I was 16 years old
[36:40] and I have never since in the last two
[36:42] years watched gross Darkness take even
[36:45] some Christians life
[36:47] and they start to it's it's unstable
[36:50] don't know where they stand and I don't
[36:52] have a hatred towards that I'm just
[36:54] saying oh God what's the answer
[36:58] I can tell you this sermon I preached
[36:59] this morning couldn't get away from it
[37:01] about a month ago I got this note in my
[37:04] Bible and it just says the last minute
[37:06] Discovery is that you don't have enough
[37:09] oil
[37:10] that's what this sermon comes this isn't
[37:13] just some concocted thing that's what
[37:15] God told me to preach on this morning
[37:19] every individual needs to be established
[37:22] and know that they have the reserve
[37:24] there's nothing more important than the
[37:26] oil
[37:26] your money your job your career your
[37:29] house
[37:31] anything your boyfriend nothing and
[37:33] sister Kelly said it nothing is more
[37:35] important than God
[37:43] sometimes it takes an incident like that
[37:44] to drive sister Kelly any of us it's a
[37:47] shame sometimes it drives us to that
[37:49] sobering feeling wow we're at the last
[37:50] days why am I making such a priority on
[37:53] other things
[37:54] when the priority should be the oil
[37:56] do I have the oil do I have a reserve of
[37:59] the oil because in this current Darkness
[38:02] I won't survive without the oil
[38:07] praise be to his name amen they're all
[38:10] stirred up they get up they trim their
[38:11] lamps all the same group doing all the
[38:13] same things now maybe wearing all the
[38:16] same things
[38:19] but something happens they started a
[38:21] journey towards the Lord
[38:23] all together towards the bridegroom
[38:27] but without this group was without
[38:30] the most important thing they began the
[38:33] journey without the most important thing
[38:35] and the discovery was I don't have
[38:38] enough to finish the journey I don't
[38:40] have enough to make it through to make
[38:42] the journey and to finish it and we
[38:44] learn from this Parable if you don't
[38:46] learn anything else the tragic end
[38:49] I I read to you the rest but the tragic
[38:52] end to starting a journey without the
[38:55] most important thing
[38:58] that's why I enjoy our young people to
[39:00] go to camps
[39:01] and to hear the preaching of the word
[39:04] because no matter what happens
[39:06] if that heart is looking for and seeking
[39:09] the Holy Ghost
[39:10] and that Minister can be used and God
[39:13] makes the connection it happened for me
[39:15] at 16 years old it was an eternal
[39:18] connection
[39:20] and if that happens we want to provide
[39:22] the environment because there's no
[39:24] greater way for them to start the
[39:26] journey not to bring in the message for
[39:28] years and be in a message church that
[39:30] they'll they'll give out eventually but
[39:32] to start their Journey with the oil
[39:37] can I get an amen start it's better to
[39:40] start and if there's discovery that I
[39:42] don't have what I need you can start
[39:44] today you can start right now God I want
[39:47] to start this journey all over because I
[39:49] realized I didn't start it the right way
[39:50] the most important thing is for me to
[39:53] seek the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[39:55] his oil in my life
[39:58] and be honest about that because there's
[40:00] many coming to me and discovering
[40:02] discovering and I say praise God you're
[40:04] discovering this now it's time to lay
[40:06] the right foundations and say I'm
[40:08] praying for one thing in my life and
[40:10] that's the oil
[40:12] I said a few weeks ago you never have
[40:14] anybody come up for prayer hardly at all
[40:15] say I'm seeking the baptism the Holy
[40:17] Ghost it's usually for healing it's
[40:19] usually for something else and God can
[40:21] provide all that but I'm telling you as
[40:22] a minister I can count on one hand in
[40:25] the last 10 years how many people have
[40:26] come and asked would you pray with me
[40:29] that I receive the true genuine oil the
[40:32] Holy Spirit In My Life
[40:35] and if we're not asking for it
[40:37] God says you have to ask
[40:39] what father would not give what his
[40:41] children would like Jesus said and those
[40:43] that asked for the Holy Ghost will not
[40:45] the father give it to him
[40:51] they started the journey towards the
[40:53] Lord and realized they couldn't finish
[40:55] the journey because they didn't have
[40:57] enough oil
[41:00] if you were to try to think of an
[41:02] example in illustration and I guess it's
[41:04] any kind of Journey I guess you could
[41:05] plan a camping trip and you're going to
[41:07] go across the country and maybe meet
[41:09] someone special at the end of the trip
[41:11] maybe somebody special in California or
[41:14] Arizona I've got a lot of special
[41:15] friends in in Arizona but you're going
[41:18] to meet someone at the end but you got a
[41:19] month of and you're going to make it a
[41:20] camping trip you're going to need a lot
[41:22] of things for that camping trip
[41:23] especially if you don't have all the
[41:24] conveniences of life you're going to
[41:26] have to think it through you're going to
[41:27] have to and there's a lot of campers
[41:28] here Josiah and his wife and different
[41:30] ones in the church they're campers I'm
[41:32] not my idea of roughing it is Motel 6.
[41:37] and I've done a little camping I did a
[41:39] bike trip across Michigan with the boys
[41:41] across Michigan and we'd camped out
[41:43] every night of course we would stop by
[41:45] restaurants during the day so it wasn't
[41:46] really bad but I found out what it was
[41:48] like to camp out and you got to have
[41:50] what you need and you're going to be in
[41:52] the wilderness if you go across the
[41:53] country you're going to be in the
[41:54] wilderness you're going to need things
[41:55] you're going to need food with you
[41:56] because if you're going to Wilderness
[41:58] you don't have a place just to
[42:00] conveniently go buy food you're going to
[42:02] need food you're going to need snacks I
[42:04] bring a lot of snacks when I do things
[42:05] when I go overseas I can't eat the food
[42:07] very much so one of my suitcases is full
[42:10] of snacks
[42:12] you're going to need things you're going
[42:14] to need to think about this trip in this
[42:16] journey what do I need what's essential
[42:18] for this journey
[42:20] towards the Lord
[42:22] you better think it through
[42:24] so I need my food I need my I need lots
[42:27] of stuff I need snacks Twinkies whatever
[42:30] I need to you know and you're going to
[42:32] need some warm clothes because it's
[42:33] going to get cold on the journey
[42:36] money
[42:39] probably not very much
[42:43] he caught it
[42:46] because you're not going to be around
[42:48] Walmart you're not going to be you're
[42:49] going to be in the wilderness you're
[42:51] going to be around lots of stuff but
[42:54] you're going to give me so your money is
[42:56] really no good and I can tell you I can
[42:58] tell you that where we're going in this
[43:00] marriage with the bridegroom your money
[43:02] doesn't really mean anything you can't
[43:04] buy your way into this your retirement
[43:07] that you have set up God bless you but
[43:09] don't you ever let that be a security
[43:10] our security has to be in the Lord today
[43:14] and this kind of Journey Through the
[43:16] Wilderness your money is no really no
[43:18] good
[43:20] Your Nest Egg isn't really any good I've
[43:22] had Brothers come and say I had a nest
[43:24] egg for 20 years and now the economy now
[43:27] it's gone it's finished it can be gone
[43:29] just like that friends I've said it over
[43:31] and over again we cannot put our trust
[43:33] in worldly Goods or worldly things or
[43:36] houses or lands we can't put our trust
[43:38] in governments or any of these things we
[43:42] have one place especially right now to
[43:44] cling to and make sure we stay filled
[43:46] it's about the holy spirit it's about
[43:49] walking in his spirit it's about
[43:51] remaining filled with the spirit it's
[43:53] about getting of the Holy Spirit if we
[43:55] don't have it it's all about the oil in
[43:57] the last days
[44:01] it's about the oil you get your warm
[44:03] clothes you know you get lots of stuff
[44:06] and then you think you will you're
[44:09] supposed to think you will have 12 hours
[44:11] usually out of that day that it's going
[44:13] to be completely dark and so you won't
[44:16] have any light so you have to think
[44:18] about light you're going to need light
[44:20] you're going to need flashlights
[44:24] I'm being practical so you understand
[44:26] if you forgot the flashlights and you're
[44:29] going a month 12 hours out of your day
[44:32] it's going to be complete pitch Darkness
[44:34] is anybody catching your spiritual
[44:36] journey
[44:37] and anybody catching the Midnight Hour
[44:39] that you live in The Darkest Hour the
[44:41] Midnight Hour
[44:43] you're going to need light
[44:45] you're going to need flashlights and
[44:46] guess what what if you went and you had
[44:48] flashlights but you didn't bring the
[44:50] energy for the flashlight oh I forgot
[44:53] the batteries that would be me on a
[44:55] camping trip
[44:57] but when you think about being in the
[44:59] dark for 12 hours and the Animals
[45:01] because that's another thing to think
[45:02] about the vicious animals that come out
[45:05] of the woods and you're gonna in in
[45:07] snakes and all these other things you
[45:09] got to think you're going to have to
[45:10] have some weapon against the animals
[45:12] you're going to have to have some
[45:13] protection can you say Amen so you're
[45:16] thinking this through a head because on
[45:18] this journey and it's so true to the
[45:20] Christian Journey it's not going to be
[45:22] at Walmart it's going to be a Wilderness
[45:24] you're going to have dark times can you
[45:26] say Amen you're going to have vicious
[45:28] animals come at you you're going to have
[45:30] vicious people come after you it's going
[45:32] to be a journey that's not perfect
[45:36] so you need the essential things
[45:39] and one of the most essential things
[45:40] you'll need in the darkness is light is
[45:42] light I want you guys to keep that up
[45:44] because I want that image to be in their
[45:46] minds today and the congregation is mine
[45:48] this is what it is you can trim your
[45:50] laps it can be Burning Brightly but I
[45:52] can tell you if that vessel is depleted
[45:54] or that vessel never got oil to begin
[45:57] with none of this is going to work right
[45:59] and you're going to be traveling through
[46:00] the darkness with just you in your own
[46:03] energy and I'm telling you you can't
[46:05] make it in this hour
[46:09] without the oil
[46:13] Hallelujah can't make a marriage without
[46:15] the oil
[46:17] can't have a family without the oil
[46:20] can't be a young person strong in the
[46:22] Lord without the oil
[46:24] this came to me also when I was speaking
[46:26] a few weeks ago to the young people
[46:27] about a strong young man that can that
[46:30] can stand against a weak girl a strong
[46:33] girl that can stand against a weak Boy
[46:35] or the wrong kind of boy it's strength
[46:37] God is calling for strength in this hour
[46:39] in young people God's calling for
[46:41] strength in the congregation where does
[46:43] that strength come from the oil the Holy
[46:45] Spirit
[46:46] that's where it originates from it's
[46:49] that Your Vessel has got a reserve of
[46:51] the oil
[46:52] that's where we become strong in the
[46:54] Lord so on this journey let me finish
[46:56] this month-long trip to meet someone
[46:58] special you need batteries because
[47:00] batteries would be the essential thing
[47:02] tied to the light that's going to shine
[47:04] to keep you through the darkness its
[47:07] energy to fuel the light and the Holy
[47:10] Ghost the holy spirit is the only energy
[47:12] God has provided in order for you to
[47:15] have a light to make it through this
[47:17] Darkness there is no other psychology
[47:19] there is no other source to go to can
[47:22] you say Amen there is no other doctor
[47:24] God has provided it in the oil can you
[47:27] say it now
[47:28] in this Dark Hour nothing will make this
[47:31] journey or finish this journey without
[47:33] the oil of the Holy Spirit
[47:36] and they didn't have enough because they
[47:38] didn't why didn't they have enough when
[47:40] they started they didn't make it a
[47:41] priority when they started
[47:43] and to every Christian the Holy Spirit
[47:48] is what we should make more important
[47:50] than anything else in our lives
[47:54] I don't know this may be just so simple
[47:56] this morning
[47:58] somehow can it please can it please not
[48:01] just be go in one ear and out the other
[48:03] he that hath
[48:05] he that hath an ear to hear Let Him hear
[48:08] this morning what the spirit is saying
[48:10] to your life
[48:12] that you receive it this morning don't
[48:15] have some message Pride I'm doing it
[48:17] right I gave my heart to God I've seen
[48:19] God in my life although praise the Lord
[48:21] but where are you today
[48:24] we need the Holy Spirit we need to stay
[48:27] filled with the Holy Spirit we need to
[48:28] live in the spirit we need to walk in
[48:30] the spirit we have things coming up and
[48:33] I believe more things cancer we have
[48:35] serious things that we have to attack
[48:37] and we're going to need a David's with
[48:39] faith can you say man with their three
[48:42] stones I'm standing here knowing there's
[48:44] a great giant sometimes in the church
[48:46] his Spirit trying to take people's lives
[48:48] over cause them to have mistrust in the
[48:50] ministry and mistrusting the message I'm
[48:53] dealing with a giant but I stand here as
[48:55] a David with the faith in these three
[48:57] stones of revelation God has given me
[49:00] I'm going to swing that in faith because
[49:02] that's the answer to the Giant
[49:04] do you think I humanly have the
[49:06] psychology to work out problems in the
[49:08] church I don't but I know a God that's
[49:11] bigger than the giant I know a God
[49:13] that's bigger than your criticism I know
[49:15] a God that's bigger and bigger than your
[49:18] instability
[49:19] he can stabilize you the Holy Spirit can
[49:22] stabilize you there's some people still
[49:24] questioning even if they're established
[49:26] in this message they're still wondering
[49:27] about this message I want to see you
[49:29] established
[49:31] in strength can you say Amen like I said
[49:33] Wednesday night your identity in the
[49:35] book you know who you are you found your
[49:36] place in the book I know who I am so
[49:39] that when I ask you like I asked the
[49:40] young people at Virginia the other day I
[49:42] said who are you I do this young guy I
[49:43] said who are you you'll answer your name
[49:45] well I'm Susie my name is Susie no who
[49:47] are you I just said I'm Susie no who are
[49:50] you I'm Susie
[49:52] whatever and she gives her name because
[49:54] that's what we think you're asking who
[49:55] you are but when God asks it's kind of
[49:57] like when he asked Peter he said Peter
[49:59] do you love me yes Lord you know I love
[50:01] you
[50:03] a few minutes later Peter but do you
[50:05] love me
[50:06] well Lord why are you asking me that yes
[50:08] you know I love you he's probing deeper
[50:11] sister Kelly he's probing deeper
[50:15] third time Peter gets frustrated Lord he
[50:18] I love you
[50:19] well God does really know whether you
[50:21] love him
[50:23] feed my sheep
[50:24] whereas the sacrifice
[50:26] do you really but only God knows if you
[50:28] really love them because we can say it
[50:29] with our lips all day long
[50:32] probes deeper probes are what what is
[50:34] what is your name I'm Sherry LaFontaine
[50:36] and we answer back but in the Book of
[50:38] Life in the book of redemption it's not
[50:40] just our names there it's this book of
[50:42] redemption that was open the Seven Seals
[50:44] taken off it is our true identity and
[50:46] it's not our names in there like Joe's
[50:49] friend or Ormond Neville or William
[50:51] Branham that's not the names of it it's
[50:52] our position in the scripture in the day
[50:55] that is being revealed and you see
[50:57] that's why John get excited John got
[50:59] excited because he's seeing his name in
[51:00] the book well he didn't say John the
[51:02] Revelator blue Glory John I'm in there
[51:05] that's not what he's seen he's seen his
[51:07] day he's seen his hour and he's seen his
[51:09] position in that hour I know who I am
[51:14] I've seen my name in the book and all of
[51:16] creation heard me shouting and dancing
[51:19] screaming
[51:21] so who are you
[51:23] I would love for somebody to stand in
[51:26] this hour I know who I am
[51:29] I believe the message of the last days
[51:31] 100
[51:32] I believe God sent a prophet William
[51:35] Branham
[51:37] no no no scare I believe he opened the
[51:40] word I believe he took the seals off the
[51:42] book I Fellowship around that I
[51:44] fellowship with the Saints who believe
[51:45] that I'm around those I know where I am
[51:48] where I stand and I may not be perfect
[51:50] but I know where I stand that's who I am
[51:51] and I want the whole world to know it
[51:53] there's no question there's no shakiness
[51:55] there's no wimpiness about it I stand
[51:58] with the people of God I stand with the
[52:00] pastors that are preaching this message
[52:02] I believe it with all of my heart
[52:05] from the top of my head to the soul of
[52:07] my feet
[52:08] that strength that's identity
[52:12] takes the Holy Spirit the oil to feel
[52:15] you that much that there's no identity
[52:17] crisis going on
[52:18] don't overlook what I preached Wednesday
[52:20] night I believe it was for a lot of you
[52:21] because you're in a identity crisis some
[52:24] of you identity crisis
[52:26] you're not going to find
[52:28] your identity on Pinterest
[52:32] you're not going to find it on Facebook
[52:34] you're not going to find it through
[52:35] other books but there's one book you'll
[52:37] find your true identity and that's this
[52:40] book of redemption
[52:41] and I said Wednesday I'm gonna say it
[52:43] again because if you didn't hear it I
[52:45] think the the audio didn't turn out
[52:46] right or something hopefully they can
[52:47] get it post it but you see now it's it
[52:50] is the what is the message then what is
[52:52] the message well it's a gathering of
[52:54] people it's some man with a seventh
[52:57] grade education that brought some of his
[52:59] thoughts on things on the Bible now we
[53:01] have all different interpretations of
[53:02] the message and when's United brought
[53:04] you what the message really is it's the
[53:06] revealing
[53:07] of This Book of redemption which is our
[53:10] book of identity
[53:12] God says finally I'm going to give it
[53:14] back to the people that sons of God can
[53:15] look and say I know who I am now
[53:19] and I'm not listening to my parents who
[53:21] told me I was this or this this is who I
[53:25] really am
[53:28] blessed be the name of the Lord I feel
[53:30] his holy spirit here this morning
[53:32] calling Hearts can you say Amen
[53:35] so I think it's a call when I made a
[53:37] call to the young people that we need
[53:38] strong women strong girls in this
[53:41] generation to be able to stand against
[53:43] weak boys we need strong boys to stand
[53:46] against the weak girls we need strength
[53:49] we need you to stand by the Holy Ghost
[53:51] on the word of God not wishy-washy not
[53:54] living in all kinds of In Between Worlds
[53:57] that's where amnon called Tamar to come
[54:00] and he was living an in-between world a
[54:02] world that was alone and a world out
[54:03] here professing something out here and
[54:05] wearing something out here we need
[54:07] people to be who they are what they
[54:09] confess to be in their heart in their
[54:11] private in their bedroom they need to be
[54:13] that identity wherever they're at that
[54:16] strength can you say man to live in Two
[54:18] Worlds is weakness to live in one world
[54:19] God's world that's strength in this hour
[54:23] and so it was a call for guys and girls
[54:25] it's a call for the congregation but you
[54:27] know what it's a call for it maybe even
[54:28] today it's a call for repentance
[54:32] it's a call for repentance
[54:33] starting from the preacher all the way
[54:35] down this is the call to repent because
[54:37] if we leave the service say I
[54:39] acknowledge he had a good sermon today
[54:40] but if we don't repent God doesn't have
[54:43] anything to work with
[54:46] to get us where we need to be
[54:51] God keep filling our lamps
[54:55] walk in the spirit live in the spirit
[54:59] if you're 80 years old keep seeking it
[55:04] if you're 80 90 years old keep saying
[55:06] God fill my lamp today give me some
[55:09] Reserve Lord
[55:11] you said it's available I know you did
[55:13] something for me at the altar when I was
[55:15] 16 years old but God
[55:17] and remember the people they come the
[55:19] foolish person come and said give us of
[55:21] your oil they were trying to Piggy Bank
[55:23] off of somebody else's oil and you know
[55:25] what they said they said my wife and I
[55:26] were talking about this no we we have
[55:28] just enough for ourselves we don't have
[55:30] a reserved to give to somebody else
[55:32] you're gonna have to go get it for
[55:33] yourself
[55:37] I don't have enough I don't feel like
[55:39] somebody but I do have enough to make it
[55:41] but it's by his grace but I don't have
[55:42] enough to share it with somebody else
[55:44] I've got it for myself and it is enough
[55:47] he is enough to make it to the end the
[55:50] Holy Ghost is enough to get you to the
[55:52] end of this journey the Holy Ghost is
[55:54] enough to get you in a Rapture can you
[55:56] say Amen
[55:58] Hallelujah they're trimming their lamps
[56:00] we have to do that to our laps notice
[56:02] when the light was out there was no when
[56:04] there was Daylight there was no need for
[56:06] a lamp so they didn't recognize they
[56:08] didn't have any oil but thick Darkness
[56:10] came midnight came and they needed light
[56:12] in the midnight time in fact both Rose
[56:15] and realized how dark it was I think
[56:17] everybody realizes how dark it is
[56:19] anybody anybody can see the darkness of
[56:21] this present Darkness this present
[56:23] situation but the foolish did not
[56:25] realize they were missing something
[56:26] until two things the foolish did not
[56:29] realize they were missing something
[56:30] until the delay in his coming came and
[56:33] they all fell asleep and then it got
[56:35] really really dark and they woke up and
[56:37] it was pitch dark in the room and here
[56:40] it was real hard it was real evil oh
[56:43] people are waking up to the fact that
[56:45] we're living in a brainwashed generation
[56:47] with no Revelation because when you have
[56:48] Darkness you have no Revelation no
[56:50] understanding not even Common Sense
[56:52] anymore people are waking up to this
[56:54] generation even political people are
[56:56] realizing they're going what is going on
[56:58] on with this country there's not even
[57:00] Common Sense anymore
[57:03] even worldly people are recognize
[57:05] something's changed in our country
[57:08] the discovery but for these groups this
[57:10] group in that Darkness they discovered
[57:13] I'm lacking oil in my vessel
[57:16] I hope even a child would understand
[57:17] this this morning the vessel
[57:22] when he says the vessel that means our
[57:23] vessel you are a vessel child young
[57:26] person
[57:28] your body is a vessel
[57:30] that's what vessel means we have to trim
[57:33] the wick of our lamp so it does not just
[57:35] have smoke but light if you didn't trim
[57:37] that it'd just be smoke coming out of
[57:39] that Wick it'd just be all flickering
[57:41] and then it eventually go out but if you
[57:43] keep it trimmed and in a spiritual life
[57:46] there is this trimming that goes on in
[57:48] our lives I might be trimming some this
[57:51] morning I don't know but I know God has
[57:53] to come and trim and when we grow up we
[57:55] realize we let God trim our Wick can you
[57:58] say Amen so I can burn brightly trim
[58:01] this off and trim this often trim those
[58:03] short skirts off
[58:05] well don't trim them off actually let
[58:07] them grow longer
[58:09] that didn't come out right
[58:12] go in the message there's a lot of stuff
[58:14] to trim off trim off
[58:16] trim
[58:17] trim so there's a lot of sanctification
[58:19] there's a lot of things that you feed on
[58:21] the word and if you want to eliminate
[58:23] that part you'll be weak as well but you
[58:26] do realize you could stay in the message
[58:28] for 30 years and do all that moving of
[58:30] the Holy Spirit to okay I better do that
[58:32] I better change that yeah we're trying
[58:34] to change that you can do all of the uh
[58:38] clipping of the wick all you want to
[58:43] you catching it
[58:45] but the oil has to be first
[58:49] or trimming the lamps gets old after a
[58:52] while
[58:53] oh boy here he goes again here's that
[58:56] preacher on our short skirts and here he
[58:58] is in our makeup and here and it's not
[59:00] just that it's brothers that treat each
[59:02] other wrong it's bitterness it's you
[59:05] know I try to preach on whatever God
[59:06] tells you it's all kinds it's not just
[59:08] short skirts
[59:11] here he goes again and
[59:13] trimming trimming oh I got trimmed again
[59:15] today why do you want to keep a life of
[59:17] just getting trimmed
[59:19] because it's a lot easier just say Lord
[59:21] I need the oil
[59:24] I need something to energize this
[59:26] trimming can you say man I need
[59:29] something to energize me that I'm
[59:30] excited and I actually can say Amen when
[59:33] he preaches the gospel when he preaches
[59:35] the word
[59:37] that my heart is all into it my heart is
[59:39] in the word is anybody understanding
[59:41] what I'm saying today my feeble way of
[59:43] breaking it down I wish I could
[59:45] articulate it better but listen we all
[59:48] need more of the oil of the Holy Spirit
[59:49] forget all the politics and the message
[59:51] forget all the great preachers and all
[59:53] this going forget all that just if I
[59:55] could get my congregation to focus on
[59:57] one thing Lord do I have the oil and if
[1:00:00] I have it Lord trim my lamb make me
[1:00:03] ready I want to finish this journey to
[1:00:05] this rapture
[1:00:09] forget about what people said about you
[1:00:11] the church that's what people do people
[1:00:12] say things 20 years ago they said
[1:00:14] something and they haven't got it over
[1:00:15] it yet it's time to get over it it's
[1:00:17] time to forgive it's time to leave it
[1:00:19] alone because in my Bible in the parable
[1:00:21] it doesn't speak about somebody holding
[1:00:23] back because somebody said something it
[1:00:25] speaks about one thing do you have the
[1:00:28] oil
[1:00:32] that's what the parable says it ends all
[1:00:34] about the oil
[1:00:38] that's where we're at
[1:00:41] I hope even a child will understand
[1:00:42] we're the vessel the wick in our lamp
[1:00:45] has to be trimmed or you'll just get
[1:00:47] smoke coming out we need to be a burning
[1:00:49] Shining Light for the message light we
[1:00:52] need to sanctify Our Lives how many
[1:00:53] believe that how many want to be a
[1:00:55] Bernie Shining Light in this Darkness
[1:01:01] but the greatest thing in all this is
[1:01:03] the essential thing that we need
[1:01:05] is the oil
[1:01:08] this is the essential oils
[1:01:17] there's only one real essential oil
[1:01:25] no I don't want to kill some of your
[1:01:27] sister's businesses you know make all
[1:01:29] the money you can and if you got
[1:01:31] something for calmness I'll I'll burn it
[1:01:34] in my room and whatever but I I really
[1:01:36] got an oil for calmness I really got an
[1:01:39] oil for making me feel better I really
[1:01:41] got an essential oil here it's the most
[1:01:43] important thing in my life
[1:01:46] I turned that tape on on my phone I turn
[1:01:49] that voice on I turn that Bible on my
[1:01:51] room I can go and even sleep by it I can
[1:01:53] listen to it I'm letting the oil flow
[1:01:56] out can you say man I'll let it burn in
[1:01:58] my room I'll let it burn in my heart
[1:02:00] because this is really the only
[1:02:01] essential oil
[1:02:05] I'm going to be in church I'm going to
[1:02:07] be where the doors where the words being
[1:02:09] preached I'm going to sing with all my
[1:02:10] heart can you say Amen I'm going to be
[1:02:13] around the Holy Spirit I need more of it
[1:02:15] I'm going to do whatever I can this is
[1:02:17] the essential oil that I need
[1:02:20] hope nobody's offended but listen this
[1:02:22] is what the parable says for our time
[1:02:24] it's about the oil
[1:02:27] so many preachers through the years it's
[1:02:29] all their Ministries only to trim the
[1:02:31] lamps
[1:02:32] man I got to trim those people I got to
[1:02:34] trim their laps some more and that's all
[1:02:35] their Ministry Ministers of the Old
[1:02:38] Testament instead of Ministers of the
[1:02:40] new testament which has Grace in it
[1:02:42] which says holy ghost in it Old
[1:02:44] Testament ministers just try to conform
[1:02:46] to people and they're always trimming
[1:02:48] their lamps
[1:02:50] and sometimes preachers have to do that
[1:02:52] but listen you're going to get tired of
[1:02:54] trimming your lamps unless you have the
[1:02:56] energy
[1:02:57] of the Holy Spirit
[1:03:00] this has been such a burden in my heart
[1:03:01] can you say amen I pray we trust you'll
[1:03:04] be with it this morning
[1:03:06] the last minute discovery that you don't
[1:03:09] have the oil
[1:03:10] and the strength that we need is in the
[1:03:12] Holy Ghost
[1:03:13] I find being honest to the congregation
[1:03:15] I find I hold back a little bit
[1:03:18] in talking about
[1:03:20] this area
[1:03:23] you know I've been a pastor who who
[1:03:25] likes to
[1:03:27] I first of all I don't like to bring a
[1:03:29] personal judgment on somebody if they
[1:03:31] don't have the Holy Ghost even though
[1:03:34] you can have the discernment sometimes
[1:03:36] to watch the fruit and alive and if it
[1:03:38] keeps over a pattern
[1:03:40] then you could probably say in your
[1:03:42] heart I think they might be missing the
[1:03:44] beginning part and that's the oil
[1:03:46] they've gone through sanctification they
[1:03:49] try to do the right things because Mommy
[1:03:50] and Daddy said to do it but then the
[1:03:52] overall fruits is but you see I've tried
[1:03:54] to be one to hold back making that
[1:03:56] declaration over the pulpit because I
[1:03:57] don't really have a right there's
[1:03:59] there's one place he says we have the
[1:04:01] discernment to tell within a few minutes
[1:04:03] whether the person has the Holy Spirit
[1:04:04] that's one quote then it's the person
[1:04:07] asked for the REM says how do we how can
[1:04:09] we pin down this person has the Holy
[1:04:11] Ghost and brothers says there's not a
[1:04:13] way in the world for you to do it
[1:04:15] so because of that quote I back off to
[1:04:18] getting into a personal Judgment of
[1:04:20] starting to say and some preachers do
[1:04:22] God bless them if the Lord showed him
[1:04:23] that that's fine I was in a camp meeting
[1:04:25] when I was young and uh you know a
[1:04:28] preacher was going at it and ministering
[1:04:30] and very fiery and he pointed to a boy
[1:04:33] says this is your night to receive the
[1:04:34] Holy Ghost and he came up he has prayed
[1:04:37] for and I trust that that boy was truly
[1:04:40] filled with the Holy Ghost but I as a
[1:04:41] minister have never done those things
[1:04:43] and thus you know for sure you better be
[1:04:45] careful of people's lives
[1:04:48] because if for somehow that boy didn't
[1:04:50] get that and he was told by a minister
[1:04:52] that you did
[1:04:54] then he goes home and he sees no fruit
[1:04:56] in his life he still desires worldly
[1:04:58] things he goes right back to worldly
[1:05:00] things no evidence no Vindication there
[1:05:03] that something's changed in his life
[1:05:04] that confuses that boy because the
[1:05:06] preacher said I got it and it doesn't
[1:05:08] look like a habit he might be confused
[1:05:10] the rest of his life I think we need to
[1:05:12] have a care
[1:05:13] and what we personally judge someone
[1:05:17] and maybe this is why I'm hesitant to
[1:05:19] preached messages that are so strong and
[1:05:20] bold like this morning to challenge you
[1:05:23] by the scripture because it's a
[1:05:25] scripture that's challenging you in the
[1:05:26] end time it's about the oil do you have
[1:05:28] it or don't you have it
[1:05:31] it's Jesus that preached this sermon
[1:05:34] for our time
[1:05:37] and so I hold back because I don't want
[1:05:39] to be that way I've been in meetings and
[1:05:40] even as a young boy watching that I
[1:05:42] thought God if you ever call me the
[1:05:43] mystery I want to be careful because I
[1:05:45] don't want to confuse that young person
[1:05:46] I you know whatever and I tend to be a
[1:05:49] pastor too and I'm saying these things I
[1:05:51] didn't expect to say it but I tend to be
[1:05:53] a pastor too who likes to encourage if
[1:05:56] God has done something in your life
[1:05:58] you know if you've gave your heart to
[1:06:00] the Lord I want to celebrate if you're
[1:06:01] baptized I want to celebrate that with
[1:06:03] you if if you have God do something in
[1:06:06] your life I want to sell it at God
[1:06:08] because the Holy Spirit can do things in
[1:06:10] your life way early in your journey but
[1:06:12] you don't have it in your soul yet but
[1:06:14] the Holy Spirit can deal with you
[1:06:16] the Bible says that you can't even come
[1:06:18] to repentance unless the Holy Spirit
[1:06:19] leads you to do it
[1:06:22] the Baptist ways in he'll come and you
[1:06:24] mechanically do it no that heart has to
[1:06:25] be being led towards repentance by God
[1:06:27] then the message is preached and there's
[1:06:29] a connection There's real repentance
[1:06:31] that goes on you can mechanically
[1:06:33] intellectually say I'm sorry I Repent
[1:06:35] but there's no heart in it
[1:06:37] it's God that leads you to repentance
[1:06:40] it's it's the holy spirit that leads you
[1:06:42] to be baptized it's the holy spirit that
[1:06:44] does it to sanctify your life and a lot
[1:06:46] of ministers attach sanctification to
[1:06:49] the Holy Ghost if you get the Holy Ghost
[1:06:50] you'll stop doing this and stop doing
[1:06:52] this and stop smoking stop drinking and
[1:06:54] I'm leery of that because I know it
[1:06:55] brings the power in your life to
[1:06:56] overcome things but the holy spirit is
[1:06:58] deeper than just sanctifying your life
[1:07:01] because there's people that sanctify
[1:07:03] from worldly things and they don't have
[1:07:05] the Holy Spirit they're completely
[1:07:06] Sanctified they're our Holiness groups
[1:07:09] that would go Way Beyond Us in
[1:07:11] sanctification and living a holy life
[1:07:13] how many can raise your hand so holiness
[1:07:16] is important sanctification is important
[1:07:18] we should sanctify our life but people
[1:07:19] come only so far and they're dressing
[1:07:21] right they're looking right they're
[1:07:22] acting right they're in a message church
[1:07:24] but the question is but but do you have
[1:07:26] the oil yet is your heart in this word
[1:07:29] for this hour
[1:07:33] so this is this is deeper and it's not
[1:07:35] complicated because I don't want the
[1:07:37] young people or anybody to feel today
[1:07:38] he's making it further no I'm trying to
[1:07:40] bring it closer to you
[1:07:42] not further away to say I may have lived
[1:07:45] a good life I've had long hair long
[1:07:47] dress I've done the right things I've
[1:07:48] obeyed my parents praise the Lord but
[1:07:51] the question is between you and God do I
[1:07:53] have the thing that's showing the fruits
[1:07:55] that my heart is in this word
[1:07:57] of obedience and my heart is here in the
[1:08:00] message of the hour and this is my heart
[1:08:03] if everybody goes away my heart is here
[1:08:05] committed to it I'm in a marriage with
[1:08:07] this word
[1:08:09] and only you can answer that question
[1:08:12] only you can go to God for it
[1:08:15] but I don't want to be a pastor who
[1:08:17] limits people and they only go so far
[1:08:20] as long as they come to Paul Fontaine no
[1:08:22] no no no
[1:08:22] I Church no no my church won't do it I
[1:08:25] don't want to limit I want to say to you
[1:08:27] boldly and plainly seek the Lord and if
[1:08:30] you're lacking the oil
[1:08:34] then be honest about it
[1:08:36] say Lord I know you did something for me
[1:08:39] back there and it's real I'll never let
[1:08:40] the devil take it away from me but my
[1:08:43] life may be showing signs of
[1:08:45] depleting here
[1:08:47] maybe at the beginning and I didn't have
[1:08:49] the essential thing so now Lord I'm
[1:08:52] willing to start all over and say I'm
[1:08:54] going to pray and fast whatever I need
[1:08:57] to do I want you to know I want to be
[1:09:00] filled with the true Holy Spirit
[1:09:04] praise God
[1:09:07] so I back off a little bit
[1:09:10] but not this morning I I wanted to make
[1:09:13] it clear to you
[1:09:14] that this will all be over someday and
[1:09:16] this church will be gone someday it
[1:09:18] might be gone even before the Rapture I
[1:09:21] don't know
[1:09:22] how are you going to survive how are you
[1:09:24] going to make it
[1:09:28] if you didn't have any friends or any
[1:09:30] support let some of you drive a long
[1:09:31] ways you don't have much support where
[1:09:33] you're at well that's the test of our
[1:09:35] times because it's not that you lean on
[1:09:37] other people
[1:09:40] I love Fellowship too but I don't always
[1:09:42] have Fellowship I don't always have all
[1:09:44] the friends but I've got the oil
[1:09:48] and I can overcome with the oil
[1:09:50] I can make it through any Darkness with
[1:09:52] the oil
[1:09:54] does anybody get anything out of this
[1:09:55] this morning
[1:09:57] Hallelujah
[1:09:59] [Applause]
[1:10:02] a little afraid to speak boldly you know
[1:10:05] in
[1:10:07] your
[1:10:09] if your heart is not in this word of the
[1:10:11] hour anchored strong in your personal
[1:10:12] vessels
[1:10:14] is not holding this anointing on your
[1:10:16] soul this anointing of the holy spirit
[1:10:18] that agrees and receives this message
[1:10:21] unrestricted I receive it then you may
[1:10:24] be missing the most essential thing
[1:10:26] and have all the rest together but
[1:10:28] missing the most essential thing the
[1:10:30] Bible mystery in this Parable proclaims
[1:10:32] it more bold than I could ever do this
[1:10:34] morning
[1:10:36] that there are people there are good
[1:10:37] people
[1:10:38] that are finding something coming up
[1:10:39] short of the oil it's concerning
[1:10:43] the parable is concerning
[1:10:46] they tried to piggyback off others give
[1:10:48] us of your oil we have not enough
[1:10:50] this Christian writer Terry Bain said
[1:10:52] when you are using oil in the lap you
[1:10:54] trim the wick so that when you light it
[1:10:56] the flame will be clear and bright and
[1:10:58] untrimmed Wick can you give me 10 more
[1:11:00] minutes
[1:11:02] he said all of them trimmed their wicks
[1:11:04] in Matthew 25 in other words they made
[1:11:06] the worst the most of whatever lamp they
[1:11:08] had
[1:11:09] they made the most of whatever lamp they
[1:11:11] had with oil without it by trimming the
[1:11:13] lamps they're making the most of it
[1:11:15] the problem was not the lamp or the wick
[1:11:17] but the oil five of them had enough oil
[1:11:19] and five of them did not without the
[1:11:21] Holy Spirit we may have a perfectly good
[1:11:23] lamp
[1:11:25] but no oil to keep it burning
[1:11:28] some people respond to the gospel and
[1:11:29] have a correct understanding of the
[1:11:31] Gospel but they only have an
[1:11:32] intellectual Ascent to it it has no
[1:11:35] effect on their lives because they
[1:11:36] haven't committed themselves to it this
[1:11:38] is not enough to save them even the
[1:11:40] demons know who Jesus is but they are
[1:11:42] not saved James 2 19 you believe there's
[1:11:45] one God good even the demons believe
[1:11:48] there's one God in shutter and tremble
[1:11:51] it's not enough just to believe it's not
[1:11:53] enough to just say I'm in the message
[1:11:56] it won't hold you in the dark times
[1:11:58] young person it's not enough just to
[1:12:01] wear the right clothes
[1:12:02] there has to be a personal relationship
[1:12:05] with Christ's a marriage with you in
[1:12:07] Christ there are some people who have
[1:12:09] this kind of faith in God they agree
[1:12:11] with what the Bible teaches and even
[1:12:13] accept the truth of the Gospel but they
[1:12:15] are trying to live the Christian Life in
[1:12:17] their own power
[1:12:18] they have never really put their trust
[1:12:20] in Christ and they have have never
[1:12:22] received the Holy Spirit to enable them
[1:12:25] to live out their faith they may know
[1:12:27] about Jesus but they do not have a
[1:12:29] personal relationship with Jesus Through
[1:12:31] the Holy Spirit as a result there's no
[1:12:33] evidence real evidence of Jesus Christ
[1:12:35] in their lives they live for this world
[1:12:37] and not for the Kingdom of Heaven by the
[1:12:38] way this isn't brother Branham this is a
[1:12:40] Christian writer I think he's saying it
[1:12:41] right
[1:12:43] they live for this world and not for the
[1:12:45] Kingdom of Heaven they will not have the
[1:12:46] strength or endurance to withstand the
[1:12:49] trials and Temptation that face those
[1:12:51] who belong to Christ because they do not
[1:12:53] have the Holy Spirit power to enable
[1:12:56] them you can't do this with your own
[1:12:58] power you must do it by the power of the
[1:13:00] oil
[1:13:03] you want my take on Matthew 25 as I'm
[1:13:05] drawing this to the close it is foolish
[1:13:07] to pursue Christ the bridegroom without
[1:13:09] the oil first
[1:13:11] hey I didn't call them foolish virgins
[1:13:13] God did
[1:13:15] it's foolish to pursue God
[1:13:18] without saying first Lord fill me with
[1:13:20] the Holy Spirit
[1:13:22] it's gambling with your life to think
[1:13:24] that trimming your lap every now and
[1:13:25] then at camp
[1:13:27] and that is enough or going to church or
[1:13:29] being in the message church or being
[1:13:31] stirred to wake up by the Midnight Cry
[1:13:32] it's not enough it's not enough to
[1:13:34] depend on others it's not enough to to
[1:13:36] this day to only open your Bible at
[1:13:38] church it's not enough to overcome this
[1:13:40] Midnight Hour Darkness with just being a
[1:13:42] good boy or just being a good Deacon son
[1:13:44] or no it's not enough in this or it
[1:13:47] won't get you through
[1:13:50] got to have the oil first it must be
[1:13:52] first on the journey and if you are
[1:13:53] discovering it wasn't then my friends
[1:13:55] start over and seek him it must be first
[1:14:01] I want to address something I know some
[1:14:03] of our young people are attending camp
[1:14:04] this week and many camps this summer and
[1:14:06] I just want to say as some teaching from
[1:14:08] a pastor all right
[1:14:10] I support wherever the atmosphere of the
[1:14:13] Holy Spirit
[1:14:14] can deal with you
[1:14:16] and be personal with you
[1:14:19] but I want to say in instruction to our
[1:14:21] young people because brother Brown made
[1:14:23] comments that the Pentecostals sometimes
[1:14:24] in that group they would get off track
[1:14:27] because a pastor didn't teach them
[1:14:28] properly
[1:14:29] young people listen don't ever let
[1:14:31] others praise and other a person another
[1:14:34] person's emotion take away or distract
[1:14:37] you from you really getting a hold of
[1:14:39] God yourself
[1:14:41] don't be intimidated by the emotion of
[1:14:44] another person God may lead them to
[1:14:46] emotion and he'll an emotionless
[1:14:49] religion if it's a dry-eyed repentance I
[1:14:51] don't know if you have broken this but
[1:14:52] you will be moved in some way if you're
[1:14:54] ready to give your heart to God you will
[1:14:57] be moved I don't believe it's a
[1:14:58] drive-eyed repentance but don't look
[1:15:00] there and say I must not have got
[1:15:02] anything because they're shouting and
[1:15:03] dancing all over the building they got
[1:15:05] it and I didn't you hold your heart
[1:15:07] before God because he promised you the
[1:15:10] Holy Ghost
[1:15:13] is that okay with everybody
[1:15:15] [Applause]
[1:15:18] don't let others praise an emotion take
[1:15:20] away from distracting you from really
[1:15:22] getting hold of God yourself and you let
[1:15:25] the emotion take care of itself
[1:15:27] in your own life you probably will get
[1:15:29] emotional but don't dictate it that I
[1:15:31] didn't get nothing because somebody else
[1:15:33] looks like they did
[1:15:38] always be knowing that some of those are
[1:15:41] getting something real
[1:15:43] and some of those are just in the flesh
[1:15:47] and they're not getting anything
[1:15:50] why how do I know that because I talk to
[1:15:53] some that come home at camps and things
[1:15:55] and they go home and they still Bound by
[1:15:57] pornography they still got the same
[1:15:59] habits and they shouted more than
[1:16:00] anybody at that camp
[1:16:02] it's not in the shouting it's are you
[1:16:04] getting something real to overcome
[1:16:06] pornography in order to become the devil
[1:16:09] gotta get something real so you shut
[1:16:12] yourself out from all that's going on
[1:16:14] and not compare yourself with others at
[1:16:16] these camps and say God I'm here to get
[1:16:18] something from you I'm not even here to
[1:16:20] meet my friends I know young teenagers
[1:16:22] go more for their friends and there's
[1:16:24] not anything wrong with that you need
[1:16:25] good friends but I would say to you
[1:16:27] before you go this week or this summer
[1:16:29] anywhere I would say Lord I want to let
[1:16:31] you know I'm not going just for friends
[1:16:33] with the fun or the volleyball
[1:16:34] volleyball the message sport
[1:16:38] I'm not going for the volleyball I'm not
[1:16:40] going for friends I'm not going there
[1:16:42] God I'm going to meet you
[1:16:45] I need something deeper with you
[1:16:47] Mommy and Daddy all won't always be
[1:16:50] there and I'm gonna need the oil in my
[1:16:52] vessel Lord I'm gonna need oil
[1:16:57] you said you give it to those who are
[1:16:58] asking for it if you're not even asking
[1:17:00] then he's not going to give it to you
[1:17:02] but I'm asking it's my inheritance it's
[1:17:06] mine can you say Amen
[1:17:08] taking it for myself Hallelujah
[1:17:10] then watch your life and watch the
[1:17:12] fruits that follow
[1:17:14] the oils first I was telling the young
[1:17:15] people can I just have a couple more
[1:17:17] minutes today
[1:17:18] you excuse me I was going to finish the
[1:17:20] rest of this Sunday but I'll finish it
[1:17:21] now with this quote that's coming up but
[1:17:23] I want to say to you
[1:17:25] I was at a camp and I received the Holy
[1:17:28] Spirit when I was 16 years old at byc
[1:17:31] and there was a evangelist there excuse
[1:17:34] me brother Harold Hildebrandt was there
[1:17:35] and all I can remember in my experience
[1:17:37] some of you have heard this before but
[1:17:38] for the new ones that haven't heard it
[1:17:41] I give my life to God when I was I think
[1:17:43] eight or nine years old mom would
[1:17:44] remember the age it was down there I
[1:17:46] think brother Delbert Barnhart was
[1:17:48] baptizing me these recently sister Paula
[1:17:52] and then found a picture of it so I have
[1:17:53] a picture of my baptism didn't know that
[1:17:55] was around eight or nine years old right
[1:17:57] Mom something like that give my heart to
[1:17:58] God repented was baptized back then and
[1:18:01] then doing all the right things and
[1:18:03] following and good parents and good
[1:18:05] strictness and you know confidence and
[1:18:07] boundaries all that I thank God for it
[1:18:11] but then something happened to me
[1:18:12] because I had been in all these message
[1:18:14] ranks and these meetings heard the
[1:18:16] quotes heard the quotes heard the quotes
[1:18:18] heard all these things and uh
[1:18:21] something happened though that night
[1:18:22] when brother Hildebrandt was preaching
[1:18:24] and by the way it was about 10 or 15 of
[1:18:27] us in my age group Brian and Lucille
[1:18:29] Erickson Mark Johnson some of my friends
[1:18:35] Daryl you might have been there but
[1:18:37] there's a whole host of us that night
[1:18:38] that received the Holy Ghost
[1:18:42] still going on with the Lord today
[1:18:45] we talk about that why don't we get
[1:18:46] together with them but you know what
[1:18:49] I didn't get it at the altar I didn't
[1:18:51] believe I got something was happened to
[1:18:52] me while I was sitting there hearing the
[1:18:54] word
[1:18:55] something was changing me and I was I
[1:18:57] was I was jolted by the fact that wait a
[1:19:00] minute
[1:19:00] I'm not hearing this just here now and
[1:19:02] going heard that before that before
[1:19:05] heard that oh yeah my dad talked about
[1:19:06] that yeah I know that quote something
[1:19:09] was different something was resonating
[1:19:11] down here
[1:19:13] something was rising in me while I was
[1:19:16] sitting there and I was I was rising in
[1:19:19] my soul and my soul was screaming Amen
[1:19:22] to the word of God
[1:19:25] I receive it amen now
[1:19:29] I might talk about this oil a little bit
[1:19:30] more next week and break it down a bit
[1:19:32] because the oil the Holy Ghost is
[1:19:35] probably the most debated
[1:19:38] confused subject not because of God
[1:19:42] but in this hour Even in our own ranks
[1:19:44] the Holy Ghost is loosely
[1:19:47] taught
[1:19:49] so much to the people that I think
[1:19:51] people get confused as to what it really
[1:19:54] is and what the evidence of it is
[1:19:58] someone I would like to go into that
[1:20:00] because there's no sense in saying you
[1:20:01] need the Holy Spirit unless you
[1:20:02] understand what it is you're seeking
[1:20:06] so I remember coming on glued my soul
[1:20:09] was rising and I was hearing it through
[1:20:11] different ears something was saying hey
[1:20:13] man to God and I did go to the altar
[1:20:15] that night but I knew something else had
[1:20:17] already changed within me I just I just
[1:20:19] felt it the word was being preached and
[1:20:22] I personally was personalizing this that
[1:20:24] he was becoming personal to me the new
[1:20:27] birth is a revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:20:28] personally to you that's the new birth
[1:20:31] that's the Holy Ghost it's the
[1:20:33] revelation of Jesus Christ personally
[1:20:36] to you not through daddy and mommy not
[1:20:38] through Camp not through friends
[1:20:41] he becomes personal
[1:20:45] this is different but you know what I
[1:20:47] always say
[1:20:49] I didn't really know my life had been
[1:20:51] changed until I get out in my regular
[1:20:54] routine every day and seeing something
[1:20:55] that's been changed
[1:20:57] that's why you can't just say because I
[1:20:59] was there in a meeting I believe
[1:21:01] something had changed but you have to
[1:21:02] watch your life because the Holy Ghost
[1:21:03] is the Life of Christ of overcoming how
[1:21:06] do you get to see it unless you're
[1:21:07] tempted hard to be tempted at a camp
[1:21:11] so I remember about six months before
[1:21:13] that I'd go to visit my grandpa up here
[1:21:15] in Chelsea Michigan and if I stayed
[1:21:17] there alone with them then man I got to
[1:21:19] watch TV and got to watch all that I
[1:21:22] wanted and I stayed up all night Grandpa
[1:21:23] went to bed early and I watched all
[1:21:25] kinds of things on that TV things I
[1:21:27] should have never watched and that was
[1:21:29] in 19 whatever
[1:21:36] and I I just fed on it oh boy not being
[1:21:40] around in TV just oh you're just
[1:21:42] drinking this stuff in you know worldly
[1:21:44] bad bad bad stuff nothing there to stop
[1:21:48] me nothing there not even my conscience
[1:21:50] what's a message conscience can be
[1:21:51] pretty strong sometimes
[1:21:53] I shouldn't do this mommy and daddy is
[1:21:55] going to see me
[1:21:56] that's a message conscience
[1:21:58] it's not about God or conviction of the
[1:22:00] Holy Ghost it's about
[1:22:03] mom and dad might judge me
[1:22:05] you got to have something deeper than
[1:22:06] that
[1:22:08] is this okay with everybody
[1:22:11] and
[1:22:12] so then I'd feel this terrible terrible
[1:22:16] thing but I just kept doing it and so
[1:22:18] then I went to camp
[1:22:19] and I come back and three or four months
[1:22:22] later then I was going to stay the night
[1:22:23] at Grandpa's again so I guess this was a
[1:22:25] test
[1:22:26] they stayed the first few nights and
[1:22:27] then I
[1:22:29] said I'm just going to go to bed you
[1:22:30] know
[1:22:31] I don't want that I believe something
[1:22:33] was changed in me
[1:22:35] one night
[1:22:36] in a moment of weakness and say I'll
[1:22:38] just try to filter through this a little
[1:22:40] bit and I'll sit here and I stayed up
[1:22:41] and I watched a couple things that I
[1:22:43] shouldn't see
[1:22:44] and then I got up the next day
[1:22:47] and the next probably three weeks I
[1:22:50] lived with such
[1:22:53] conviction in my heart
[1:22:55] I said God
[1:22:57] I didn't want to do that
[1:22:59] please forgive me Lord help me not to
[1:23:01] feed on those things
[1:23:03] I just I felt so bad and it then it
[1:23:07] dawned on me
[1:23:08] sister Dawn
[1:23:14] sometimes she Dawns on me she'll send me
[1:23:15] a text and send me an encouraging word
[1:23:17] and it Dawns on me and gives me Faith
[1:23:22] I'm a weird preacher ain't I Joel you
[1:23:24] know you know I am might as well admit
[1:23:26] it okay we're related
[1:23:29] we can relate by being weird okay
[1:23:32] I was so but it just dawned on me I said
[1:23:34] why why do I feel so convicted and so
[1:23:38] bad because when I would get up
[1:23:40] oh I felt a little scared my parents
[1:23:42] will find out but when I got up before I
[1:23:44] didn't feel this
[1:23:46] I didn't feel terrible like this
[1:23:48] convicted like this
[1:23:50] and that was one of the biggest
[1:23:51] evidences for me besides going on with
[1:23:54] this love of truth because remember the
[1:23:56] Holy Ghost he says when I sin the Holy
[1:23:58] Ghost he says it'll lead you and guide
[1:24:01] you into all truth it's associated with
[1:24:03] truth so your soul is saying Amen to
[1:24:05] truth even though the flesh sometimes
[1:24:07] they ouch but the soul saying amen
[1:24:10] that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:13] so I was I began to Rejoice because I
[1:24:16] realized Lord
[1:24:17] something's changed in me because I
[1:24:19] didn't act like that before I mean I was
[1:24:22] so broken about it I hope that's okay
[1:24:25] this morning and I if I share that with
[1:24:27] some places I think five people think
[1:24:29] I'm watering down the Holy Ghost I'm not
[1:24:31] what I'm not watering it down I try to
[1:24:34] preach to people hey you still
[1:24:35] two-thirds of you is still not born
[1:24:37] again
[1:24:39] but if the desires change down here and
[1:24:41] you'll live in that spirit
[1:24:43] it will overcome the flesh
[1:24:46] there's nothing more powerful to
[1:24:47] overcome the flesh psychology will never
[1:24:49] do it the Holy Ghost is powerful enough
[1:24:51] if you'll yield to it it'll overcome the
[1:24:53] temptation
[1:24:55] so I was rejoicing because I knew God
[1:24:57] had changed me and something had
[1:24:59] happened to me young people when you go
[1:25:01] to Camp here's one of the greatest
[1:25:03] things brother bam talked about and it's
[1:25:05] interesting in this quote he says I
[1:25:07] heard brother Neville say this morning
[1:25:08] I'm closing now some someone might have
[1:25:11] been asking why I didn't preach on the
[1:25:13] Holy Ghost why didn't you do this so
[1:25:15] there isn't some type of thing in his
[1:25:17] congregation and that's interesting in
[1:25:19] itself that you need to teach on the
[1:25:20] Holy Ghost you need to we need to know
[1:25:22] and in those some of the Pentecostal
[1:25:24] Realms it's like okay let's get down to
[1:25:26] the evidence of the Holy Ghost what is
[1:25:27] it because they were saying speaking in
[1:25:29] tongues was the initial evidence the
[1:25:31] Holy Ghost and you still had a lot of
[1:25:32] that hanging around and so we need to
[1:25:35] sell this you need to teach on it and so
[1:25:37] he didn't do it he just basically
[1:25:38] explained it in one paragraph
[1:25:41] they're pressuring him saying when is
[1:25:43] this going to happen
[1:25:44] here it is
[1:25:49] Peter God
[1:25:50] you know you don't have to have 12
[1:25:52] sessions on this
[1:25:55] it's not complicated Satan's made it
[1:25:57] complicated
[1:25:59] here it is the Holy Ghost is the action
[1:26:02] in you it's a life not an emotion
[1:26:07] not some sort of fleshly evidence I
[1:26:10] believe in flesh the evidences I believe
[1:26:12] we're emotional people and I believe we
[1:26:14] get stimulated by the word of God like
[1:26:16] you have this morning you get excited
[1:26:18] you'll worship you'll Rejoice last
[1:26:20] weekend at the camp Friday night I was
[1:26:22] dancing the pastor was dancing the
[1:26:24] pastor's wife was dancing everybody was
[1:26:26] getting stimulated by the word of God
[1:26:27] I'm not against it but don't ever use it
[1:26:31] as an evidence that you have the oil
[1:26:34] it's a completely separate thing
[1:26:38] it's the life it's
[1:26:40] an it's not some sort of fleshy evidence
[1:26:42] but it is a person Jesus Christ the word
[1:26:45] of God established in your heart when I
[1:26:48] think of the word established it's not
[1:26:49] here today and going tomorrow something
[1:26:51] is settled and established in your heart
[1:26:55] to Quicken every word
[1:26:58] for of this age
[1:27:00] that's the evidence of Holy Ghost
[1:27:03] it's to Quicken every word of this age
[1:27:04] not Luther's age this age it's to say
[1:27:07] Amen because nobody else is going to say
[1:27:09] Amen to it it's to live it it's to say
[1:27:10] Amen to it right and it takes the Holy
[1:27:14] Spirit
[1:27:15] to make the word live for this age
[1:27:17] that's why he sends the Holy Ghost to
[1:27:19] make the word for that age to make it
[1:27:21] live
[1:27:22] so it's living in bodies not just books
[1:27:24] and tapes
[1:27:25] right watch the Holy Ghost In Action not
[1:27:31] so much in demonstrations
[1:27:35] but in action what it does according
[1:27:40] to the word
[1:27:45] and I say a man
[1:27:50] amen
[1:27:51] let's Stand Together
[1:27:56] be filled with the spirit
[1:28:00] your lamps trimmed and cleaned
[1:28:03] look up
[1:28:05] your Redemption
[1:28:08] is here
[1:28:10] the day of redemption
[1:28:14] is he
[1:28:16] men's hearts are failing for fear
[1:28:24] be filled with the spirit your last
[1:28:30] trimmed and
[1:28:32] clear
[1:28:34] look up
[1:28:36] your Redemption
[1:28:38] is me sing it one more time before we
[1:28:42] pray the day of
[1:28:46] [Music]
[1:28:49] all men's hearts
[1:28:52] are failing
[1:28:54] for fear
[1:28:56] be
[1:28:58] filled with the spirit
[1:29:01] your lamps trimmed and clear
