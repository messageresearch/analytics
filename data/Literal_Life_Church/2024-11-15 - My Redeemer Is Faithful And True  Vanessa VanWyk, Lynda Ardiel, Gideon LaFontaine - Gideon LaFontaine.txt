My Redeemer Is Faithful And True

Verse 1:
As I look back on the road I've travelled,
I see so many times He carried me through;
And if there's one thing that I've learned in my life,
My Redeemer is faithful and true.
My Redeemer is faithful and true.

Chorus:
My Redeemer is faithful and true.
Everything He has said He will do,
And every morning His mercies are new.
My Redeemer is faithful and true.

Verse 2:
My heart rejoices when I read the promise
'There is a place I am preparing for you.'
I know someday I'll see my Lord face to face,
'Cause my Redeemer is faithful and true.
My Redeemer is faithful and true.

Bridge:
And in every situation He has proved His love to me;
When I lack the understanding, He gives more grace to me.

Written by James Isaac Elliott and Steven Curtis Chapman
