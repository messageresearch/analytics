========================================

um last year we were planning to actually come last year and the year changed and uh we were not able to be here so i'm preaching a sermon that i had in my heart for last year so i pray to be a blessing to you some that are here have heard this but act as if you've never heard it before amen genesis 21 verse 1 says in the lord visit to sarah as he had said and the lord did unto sarah as he had spoken vasara conceived and bear abraham his son in his old age at the set time of which god had spoken to him and abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him whom sarah bare to him isaac amen the lord had a blessing to reading of his word you can be seated in the presence of the lord as brother paul was saying last week he was there for us in west palm beach and ministered on a wonderful topic of uh working together and it was just so timely for our church and just many of the saints were just really really blessed by it and we thank you all for uh allowing him to share his gift with us and um this morning you know i wanted to just kind of take a thought on step into the vision and step into the vision and um as we said you know last year 2020 was supposed to be a year vision and you know just just the numbers along 2020 it just kind of set people up for you know just great expectations for the year and uh even though things might have changed naturally uh for most people i still feel the bride is still uh under a vision amen and the bride has not moved from what god has called her to uh in this hour and you know and it's not i don't want to make it light i know that we've had some loved ones to pass away from from covet amen and we we realized that um that you know there are families that are still you know dealing with that uh i know god's still in control amen and you know we realize uh that because of what happened in the garden of eden um you know at some point in time we all are going to face something and whether it goes through a car accident a airplane accident um you know just something just comes out of nowhere you know we all got to face this at some point but we we're encouraged that god is still in control amen no matter what it is that we face and you know so when we look at this uh this you know just looking at it from the year 2020 a year of vision uh when you go to the doctor and you have your vision checked and the the doctor comes out and says you know uh you have 20 20 vision you actually walk out and you're pretty excited about i got 20 20 vision that's that's great but really what the doctor is telling you is that you are normal you're normal right and as as as believers we really don't want to be just normal right and one of the things that i thought to myself at the beginning of the year i don't want to be disordinary i want to be extraordinary right i don't want to see the usual i want to see god do the unusual right i don't want to be the same as everybody else i actually want to be different there's nothing wrong with that design to be different i don't want to just see the natural i want to experience the supernatural praise the lord i don't want to just be average i want to be above average i don't want to just get by i want to excel amen and uh and we don't want to just meet expectations we want to exceed them because that's the way our god does he does the exceeding the abundant above all we can ask or think so you know we uh you know we we saw um uh you know the different things that happened in the year but you know as i was just kind of thinking to myself you know a lot of people probably have a vision for their business and vision for uh their careers and vision for this and vision for that and you know they wrote their visions down but the year just changed everything hallelujah glory to god but but but but i said lord you know with all this vision that people are setting out you know to attain uh what is the greatest vision that you could have for us as your bride hallelujah and what i'm going to share with you today this vision hasn't changed no matter what happened in that year the vision that god has for his people has not changed glory to god amen and what i'm trying to do is share a portion of this vision that god has for you and when you can catch the vision my encouragement is step into the vision amen let the vision become a manifestation in your life hallelujah amen so as i thought about that and i'm just beginning to pray uh over you know what what would be the greatest vision that you could have for your bride uh this uh this this this came back to me i started looking at a section in the church age book glory to god and uh and and i found where the prophet was told to pick up his pen and write hallelujah and here's a statement that is being made here in the pyramid in church and he says one night as i was seeking the lord the holy spirit told me to pick up my pen and write as i grasped the pen to write his spirit gave me a message for the church glory i want to bring it to you it has to do with the word and the bride so what i want you to get from this is that brother branham is simply recording what the spirit is saying about you hallelujah the words that i'm about to read are not even brother branham's words it's the words of the holy spirit directly to you through his prophet hallelujah so i think it's important for us to understand what is the holy spirit speaking directly to us amen so it goes on in this quote it says uh here is what i'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction is that each specie brings forth after its own kind even according to genesis 1 11 and god said let the earth bring forth grass and the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so whatever life was in the sea came forth into a plant and thence into fruit the very same law applies to the church today whatever seed started the church will come forth and be like the original seed because it is the same seat so what we read in scripture about the church we should also expect to see in the church today because it's still a part of the same seed all right it says in these days the true bright church christ's seat will come to the headstone and she will be the super church i like this promise she will be the super church a super race as she nears him they in the bride will be so much like him that they will be given they will be even uh be in this very image this is in order to be united with him they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the living god denominations cannot produce this wrong seed they will produce their creeds and their dogmas mixed with the word this mongrel eyes and brings forth a hybrid product now i want to just stop there and just inject this you know you're not here in this church by accident you're not here in uh uh and i'll just go a little further you're not in a message church by accident glory to god there are many churches as i was driving here this morning i saw many parking lots full of cars with people inside of church amen but there was a specific reason why god would have elected for you to be a part of literal life hallelujah there's a specific reason why you would have been drawn to a man to hear the word of god from this pulpit hallelujah because this pulpit is preaching a message of transformation this pulpit is preaching a message that will change our our bodies hallelujah amen so so god does not make a a accident by putting you in a message church a message church is not an alternative to denomination a message church is not an alternative amen god is trying to bring you back to the truth because when you hear truth truth will make you free stay with me here just for a little bit he says the first son adam was the spoken seed word of god he was given a bribe to reproduce himself that is why the bride was given to him to reproduce himself to produce another son of god but she failed she she failed by hybridization she calls him to die now we could go through just about and i did this on last year i went paragraph by paragraph through these statements and i preached the entire year on this this uh stepping i mean on this uh pick up your pen and write i preached the entire year i can't take time to go through all that today so i'm gonna hit highlights but hopefully hopefully you'll catch enough of this where you can see yourself and you can say hey hey hey this pertains to me and i am going to step into what god has called me to be glory to god all right let's go a little further he says this um the second son jesus also a spoken seed word of god was given abroad like his adam amen but before he could marry her she also had fallen she like adam's wife was put to the test whether she would believe the word of god and live or doubt the word and die she doubted she left the word she died very important there she left the word she died if you want to remain alive you have to stay fortified behind the word of god stay for the fortified behind the word of god amen he made a mistake by trying to make give her own interpretation to the word of god the the word says don't eat of the tree it's very simple hallelujah very simple sometimes god just gives us simple commands and we have a hard time following it amen but just stay fortified behind what god said watch this he goes on he says from a little group of the true seed of the word god will present christ with the beloved right she is a virgin of his word she is a virgin because she knows no man made creeds of dogmas by and through the members of the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of god to be to be made manifest in the virgin now one more statement i want to make here the word of promise came to the virgin mary but that word of promise was he himself to be made manifest now the angel is writing amen the holy spirit is giving brother branham what to write to the church this is about reproduction glory to god he was given a bride to reproduce glory hallelujah amen to produce him reproduce himself again you're not here by accident you have been elected by almighty god to be his wife glory hallelujah let that think let let that sink in god has elected you amongst so many other churches amen he's elected you to become his wife glory hallelujah think about it said the word of promise came to the virgin mary but that word of promise was he himself to be made manifest god was made manifest he himself acted at that time and fulfilled his own word of promise in the virgin it was an angel that had brought her the message but the angel's message was the word of god isaiah 9 6 he fulfilled that at the time all that was written of him because she accepted his word to her now i want to just uh break into this story with mary and we're going to turn in our bible to luke 1 verse 26 uh just get that in your just get your finger on that for a little bit but i want to just kind of set this up a little bit in the garden of eden eve failed to hold uh stay fortified behind the word of god and and now every funeral that occurs is because of what eve did every time we go to the hospital to visit somebody it's because of what eve did right i mean every negative thing every war that happens in in in our world it's because of what eve did the plague that is striking the world right now it's because of what eve did and all she had to do is just stay behind one word don't eat of the tree that's all she had to do it seems very simple right you know but but here she reads it with the word of god and it produced every every evil thing that we see right now but in the beginning when god came down and he began to try to figure out okay what happened because you know adam and eve they used to go to church every uh every day in the cool of the evening god would come down and and one day they didn't show up to church hallelujah they didn't show up to church and and god knew now that they're usually here every day at this time oh hallelujah so god began to ask a question now adam and eve knew he was there they could not hide from the presence of god and today when people decide that they're not going to come to church you can't hide from the presence of god glory to god god knows exactly where you are so so god comes and says adam adam where art thou adam begins to have this conversation with god saying i'm i'm over here and what are you doing over there adam we're supposed to be in church right now what are you doing so adam shows up to church late and then he comes with some new garment song oh hallelujah somebody now now bye-bye by this big leaf garment that he's wearing god knows that something has happened god already knew it before they came to church what god was waiting for is for them to confess it god already knew what was going on so here they come in and and uh and god said now hey uh it's it's pretty obvious you got some new clothes and i didn't give them to you what happened here well you know lord this woman that you gave me and he just start passing the book so then he turns to the woman saying now what happened here eve said well even you say the serpent that you put here in the garden and they tried to blame their sin on god catch that now they actually tried to blame their decisions on god the woman you gave me the serpent you put in the guard no this was not god's problem this was their problem and they have to learn how to deal with their problem you can't blame the pastor for your problem you can't blame your mama your daddy your brother you can't blame anybody you have to accept responsibility hallelujah that's where god can do something with you when you learn to accept responsibility for the decisions you've made here they sit there and god begins to kind of go through all the okay well since all of you were involved all of you are going to have to suffer some consequences from this eve you know you're going to bear children in hard labor adam you're going to work by the sweat of your brow and the serpent you're going to be cursed and you're going to go on your belly for the rest of your life hallelujah but even in the midst of this god makes a promise here in genesis 3 15. it says and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel so god gives a promise and and in this particular scripture god is already speaking of the virgin birth this is the first promise and and i'm gonna tell you when god has prophesied something it's got to come to pass if it's truly thus saith the lord it must come to pass now now we're going and we find you know god speaking this but isaiah in the book of isaiah chapter 7 verse 14 isaiah picks up amen on this same prophecy and adds a little bit more to it now i want you to read this with me isaiah 7 14 says therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name emmanuel now i want you to think about this if you were the prophet isaiah you rose up in church one day the spirit of the lord comes upon you and you say oh i feel something telling me to say it and i gotta say it a virgin shall conceive can you imagine what the congregation thought see see we we take these words and they don't mean as much just now as it might have meant at that time a man rises up and says a virgin shall conceive the people would have went home with mine down us how is that possible hallelujah just the same way it is for a woman to have a seat because a woman carries the egg how is that possible god god when when we're looking at god things are not impossible anymore oh hallelujah see with us it might be impossible but we're talking about god all things are possible when it comes to god something as as difficult as a virgin conceiving a virgin having a baby pick up mary now in luke 1. what i read to you in genesis 3 15 was the vision what i read to you in isaiah 7 14 it was the vision hallelujah this was a vision that god had already wrote about mary before she even came god never put her name in scripture but he did put her condition a virgin will conceive and i can go a little further with that god has a virgin bride that will conceive and bear a child hallelujah look look at luke 1 verse 26 and in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god unto a city of galilee named nazareth glory hallelujah to a virgin espouse to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgin's name was mary now now uh brother branham gives us some some insight on what's going on here on this day they had just come from church and and the priests had just finished reading out of the book of isaiah talking about the virgin conceiving and uh brother random says maybe mary and joseph was discussed in the scripture and and mary's maybe saying joseph what you think what do you think it means that the priest just read it but what do you think that means jose i i really don't know i don't know what to tell you i mean that's what that's what the prophet said and i believe the prophet isaiah hallelujah i just believe the prophet isaiah that's what he said so if he said a virgin's going to conceive you know what i'm going to say a virgin's going to conceive that's the way we got to be with god's prophet that he sent us i might not understand it but that's what he said and i just believe what he said glory to god so they're having this conversation they're talking about the word of god not even realizing that mary herself is the one that the scripture was speaking of she's talking about it but doesn't realize she is actually born for this look at this verse 28 and the angel came into her uh the angel came in unto her and said hell thou art highly favored the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his team and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be now she separated from joseph after this conversation and now the angel gabriel appears unto her and she's having a conversation with the angel oh glory to god let's go on amen and the angel said unto her fear not because she was under you know great duress like what is this i'm i'm experiencing something supernatural never seen anything like this what is going on here he said fear not watch hallelujah mary for thou hast found favor with god and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth the son and shalt call his name jesus glory he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david and he shall reign over the house of jacob forever and of this kingdom there shall be no end then say mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing i know not a man now i want you to catch something here mary is is a proud of her testimony of being a virgin she's engaged to amen to joseph and she doesn't want to do anything to shatter this relationship she doesn't want to do anything to shatter her testimony and now the angel is telling her this is gonna happen that's gonna happen but she's how can this be sin i know not a man i thought that was very remarkable for her to be able to say something like that in the presence of an angel how can this be i know not a man hallelujah now watch the angel is going to share something with mary and when he shares it with her she's going to hear a sermon with language that she's never heard in church before sometimes we come into a message church and we hear things that we've never heard before but i want to tell you something even though you don't understand it stand behind it stay fortified with it it will bring you to where god wants you to be watch this watch this the next verse hallelujah amen what verse is that i can't uh 35 okay so it says this and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god language she never heard before no one ever preached about the holy ghost in her church no one ever ever took a topic or uh a sermon on the holy ghost so this is something she never heard before and i want you to also understand this the angel's telling her look you will have nothing to do with this promise being made manifest this will come by the spirit of god and i want to tell you today amen when we talk about stepping into the vision it's not what you do all you got to do is just accept the word of god but the holy spirit will bring this promise to pass inside of you if you yield yourself to it glory glory glory let's go on a little further verse 36 and behold thy cousin and i love this i just love the way this reads behold our cousin elizabeth she has also conceived a son of her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called baron now why would the angel tell mary about elizabeth how did she not know about it elizabeth was hiding elizabeth was in hiding elizabeth had many miscarriages so she probably thought i mean me with the age that i am having a baby now i don't i don't know how this is going to happen she didn't tell anybody not only that elizabeth was having problems with john in her womb he was stillborn until he heard mary's testimony one day you're gonna hear the testimony from almighty god and it'll bring life to you church it says uh uh he's encouraging her faith by telling her your cousin elizabeth is also pregnant with child now i can see mary going through her mind elizabeth now you realize the age of elizabeth but you said elizabeth not only pregnant six months pregnant elizabeth well if god can do that for elizabeth then god can do that for me he's just igniting and encouraging her faith hallelujah you need to hear testimonies that will encourage your faith when i stepped into this church i have my faith and courage i know what god can do hallelujah glory to god look amen it goes on oh hallelujah verse 36 again behold that cousin elizabeth she also uh she has also conceived a son in her old age and this is a six month with her who was called barren i love this next statement because see we face things church and we don't we don't you know we think it's impossible for us to overcome i mean elizabeth pregnant impossible marry a virgin conceiving if there was anything impossible that absolutely was impossible i mean not capable of occurring that's what impossible means it's not capable of occurring hallelujah but the next verse tells us something that should encourage all of us for with god oh church nothing shall be impossible i gotta encourage you with that i said with god nothing shall be impossible i don't care what you're facing this morning i said no it's included in the category of nothing shall be impossible oh glory to god if you're if you got a negative report from the doctor it's not impossible if you need a new job god can open up a door your lack of degrees does not stop you from receiving a blessing from almighty god nothing shall be impossible if you're unable to have a child it's still not impossible glory to god if you need an approval on a loan it's not impossible glory to god if you need a place to rent it's not impossible for god to open up a door for you if you need the restoration of a way with child it is not impossible no matter what you hear about that child it's still not impossible if you need papers for citizenship it's not impossible if you need a job transfer it's not impossible if you need a loved one released from prison it is not impossible with god nothing shall be impossible [Applause] mary you can't make this happen there's nothing you can do as a virgin there's nothing you can do the only thing you can do is surrender yourself to the word of god and look at what mary does in verse 38. mary said see sometimes god's waiting to see what you're gonna say mary said behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word i didn't say this you said it as the angel of the lord you spoke to me and all i'm going to say is be it unto me i want to step into the vision isaiah wrote about it god himself spoke about it in genesis 3 and now the manifestation and i like to put it this way the words that god spoke in genesis 3 were just whirling around like this waiting circling the earth and just waiting waiting waiting waiting for mary to come to the earth isaiah isaiah makes a prophecy and his his prophecy attaches to the one that's already worldly now there's a double prophecy on this and there was more in the old testament and it's just waiting waiting waiting and when an gabriel the angel comes at the set time hallelujah now he needs just one thing for mary to yield and i'm telling you all god needs from you this morning is you to yield you don't have to make it up you don't have to make it happen he will bring it to pass you want to know why he will bring it to pass because it's it's his word and he watches over his word to perform it he just needs some merit to rise up and say be it unto me according to thy words when we look at this amen and pick up your pen and write somebody's got to come on the seat and say be it unto me according to thy word mary say behold the hand made of the lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her brother branham made some statements here that i just want to uh uh mention to you first first the definition of impossible means is incapable of occurring cannot be done that's what impossible means cannot be done but when we're so i'm gonna tell you just like this if you're a christian and you believe the virgin birth you already believe in miracles if you just believe in a virgin birth you already believe in miracles hallelujah all christians believe in miracles we believe that our god is able to do the impossible no matter what we hear no matter what we feel we still believe our god is able to do the impossible look at this the the the word impossible means that which cannot be done uh incapable of uh of occurring and uh and and you know i i just when i look at this scripture i realize that that definition goes right out the window because god did something impossible in mary brother branham said she had to believe the impossibles something that had never happened before but she never argued she never questioned anymore his word was enough for her is the word of god enough for you his word was enough for her he says but god takes the impossibles and makes them real when he took at his word he also said this but impossibles fade out when gods took at his word he said give us more mary's around here that that that can take god at his word and praise him when you feel anything or not whether you feel anything or not let me read that again give us more merits around here that can take god at his word and praise him whether you feel anything or not now i know you say brother jack i've been waiting on god to manifest his promise to me but how are you waiting i know you're waiting my question is how are you waiting because what brother branham just told us that we need more marriage that will wait on the lord right you know that they'll take god his word and while they're waiting they will praise him see praise actually puts you in the right attitude praise actually puts you in the right mindset that's that's why you got to learn how to worship god in the middle of your waiting oh hallelujah church glory to god i don't know about you but there's been many times in my life where i'm going through a little something and as i'm going through there's just all of a sudden just a song will drop into my heart and as i'm pondering you know the thing and i'm wondering okay lord how is this going to work out and how is that going to work out and what about this and what about that and you know then god will just kind of drop a little song in my heart and it just lifts my spirit and i get encouraged to away into a place where i forget about what i'm going through oh hallelujah i want to tell you something church so you know we we come last night for the for the service and you know and and uh brother paul was making some comments about worship and recently i was in prayer amen and uh and while i was in prayer the scripture just kind of quick into my heart i will enter his gates with thanksgiving in my heart and then it says i will enter his course with praise hallelujah and i thought about this i said the first thing david tells us is that we have to come and approach god with the attitude of gratitude i'm gonna enter with thanksgiving i'm not gonna come with a downcast spirit when i come to church yes i am going through but i will not be downcast in the presence of the king hallelujah i'm not gonna show that type of emotion in the presence of the king i'm gonna refuse to do that i'm gonna start thanking god for the things that he's already done for me so i'm going to enter his course with thanksgiving my heart has to be right when i come into the house of god and when my heart is made right in his presence then i can enter its course with praise sometimes it's hard to clap your hands in the presence of the lord when you've got so much on your mind but when you can just begin to think about how good he has been then it's easy to lift your hands it's easy to worship a little bit hallelujah church i enter the courts with thanksgiving i mean it's gates with thanksgiving that means soon as i come through the door big smile on my face god bless you my brother god bless you my sister i am so happy to be here everything changes when i come into just the gates you know what i haven't even come into the sanctuary yet i'm just in the gates and i got a smile on my face just by coming to the gates [Applause] and then amen now once i come into the sanctuary everything changes because the bible says i enter his courts with praise going to lift my voice i'm going to lift my hand if i get if i feel good enough i might run around and shout a little bit because that's how david told me to come somebody just reminded me i think i was talking to brother michael belton it reminded me of something that i said a brother hurt and and and i made this statement at home i said you know if you haven't been criticized for your worship you haven't even worshipped yet if there's nothing been said about your worship the way that you worship you haven't even started to worship god yet brother jack how can you say that you're jesse no i'm not emotional i'm in the bible because paul said i worship god in a way they call heresy that means i mean i look crazy did not david look crazy when he worshipped he i mean his his wife began to criticize him for his worship if we haven't been criticized for our worship we haven't even entered yet i'm in good company with david and i'm in good company with paul i got another one for you too brother random was sitting in church one night some saints come and they got to worship my brother ram said don't take all that why would they do something like that oh lord in my church the next thing you know brother branham you know uh began to cast that spirit to the stop that was the spirit talking to brother branham and he had to cast it to the side and it said before you knew it he was you know thinking about certain places in the bible where they began to dance they began to sting and it was a sign of victory [Applause] he said it was a sign of victory he said before you know it after he pushed all that to the side he found himself in the middle of the aisle worshiping with them sisters oh hallelujah won't that be something to create an atmosphere in the prophet's church will you cause the prophet to come worship with you oh glory to god amen here mary had an attitude of gratitude and the way we can see this if we just followed her story mary went on from this experience and she went immediately to elizabeth she tells me to say oh you know elizabeth and oh i i forgot to mention this brother branham said when when mary said the words be it unto me according to that word he says that's where the pregnancy took place just by agreeing with the word no sensation no emotion just amen to the word she became pregnant and mary right after that experience went out began to talk with elizabeth elizabeth you know uh got good news i'm pregnant oh you and joseph got married no because you know you gotta imagine come on these are two sisters that are talking right because because elizabeth gonna say well y'all got married i wasn't invited to the wedding what happened i got no invitation and we're family right he said no no no no no no that's not what took place say something say what happened is that an angel visited me and he said that i would conceive and have a child i just said beat unto me according to the word and i'm pregnant i'm expecting oh elizabeth i'm fulfilling genesis 3 15. elizabeth i'm fulfilling isaiah 7 14. these scriptures that we've heard in church for years now my manifestation is here i am part of this vision i got good news i'm part of the vision glory to god it's no longer a man just uh just words on a page it's no longer just quotes that we're reading but somebody rises up and they become the manifestation of what was spoken a little say uh now you know what this is gonna look like yeah i realized that i realized all those things but i want to tell you something else elizabeth you know what else he said he said you were six months pregnant oh how do you know that the angel told me he says not only did he tell me that you know he told me what the name of my baby was gonna be the name of my baby is gonna be jesus and let himself say that again what what did you say his name was gonna be jesus said for six months this baby that i had in my in my womb had not moved but upon your visit [Applause] and you speaking his name now this baby in my womb is now showing signs of life i believe your testimony man her testimony gave life to elizabeth your testimony with your life to somebody else hallelujah let's uh look at something here oh glory to god glory glory glory to god the scripture that we read actually before we go to i'm going back to genesis but there's a little quote here that i wanted to share with you brother brandon made a statement and and uh show us the father and it'll satisfy and in this quote he he makes he's in a prayer line and he makes these statements i don't know what you're going through but i tell you what sometimes your condition can be found in a quote your condition can be found just in scripture and all you have to do is learn how to just just be like mary god be it unto me according to that word he says this he can heal diabetes you believe it sitting there praying about it aren't you that's right brother you believe me to be his prophet he can heal high blood pressure too you believe that sister here with your hand up what's heart trouble to god or arthritis either one he says oh my i wish you could he says this if you could catch the vision so he's saying here this uh uh over the audience is just a vision after vision after vision breaking forth over the people he says if you could just catch the vision see if they could catch it then they could rise up and claim their healing oh glory if you could catch the vision this is the first that you really believe this is it now you believe in look at this now you got all the doubts moved back the christian spirit is overrode the other unbelievers hallelujah you're all inside now that's the way the holy spirit's supposed to work that's it said if thou cast believe and i love that statement about your christian spirit or faith has overrode unbelief and we need that to happen in us today let faith override unbelief [Music] now let me just give you an example of an override you sisters love to shop i didn't get any amens sisters when they go shopping no that's not gonna be anything bad it's gonna be all good since but when sisters go shopping they don't shop like brothers brothers go in get what they're gonna get and they're out just like that i heard that amen over there i heard me but not sisters sisters go in when they when they scope out this nice rack of clothes and and it's on sale what they do is in their mind they're thinking a couple things i'm gonna buy one for me i'm gonna get this one for sister so and so i'm gonna get that one for sister so-so and then they're checking the account and like i don't got enough to get nothing for everybody so what i'm gonna do is send a text message to my different friends and say you know what you need to come to this store because you know what they got a nice sale going on and you you want to get here is that right sisters you go through all of that and then you walk up to the register all excited about this great deal you had and they start swiping and ringing you know the things up when they start ringing it up it rings up for more than what you told everybody it costs so at that point in time you have some conversation with the cashier it has a sign in the back for this price and you just run it up for this uh i think you all need to edit this and make changes to because this is what it showed back there and then the cashier politely tells you in the nicest worst they can i don't have the authority to change the price well it doesn't sit like that with you come on sister say amen right so it's not gonna it's not gonna stay if you don't have the authority what i need is a manager i need somebody with keys i need somebody with authority that can come and change the price and when the manager comes you're not there to talk about how is your day and and how it's how's your family i have one reason why i'm speaking with you do you have the authority to change the price on what i just texted everybody and told them what the price was because i'm not leaving here until you change the price hallelujah and see what you did to call for the manager to override hallelujah the price that was given that was running up ringing up on the register you had somebody there to override it i want to tell you this morning we have a manager in heaven his name is jesus christ and he's here to override anything that you're going through all things are possible with god hallelujah [Music] [Applause] you don't have to settle for that doctor's report you don't have to settle for anything call for the manager [Applause] he's here to override it glory to god whatever you're facing he is here to override glory glory glory genesis 21 we were reading this earlier and just want to come back to it oh glory when we look at verse 1 and the lord visited sarah as he had said and the lord did unto sarah as he had spoken and and as i meditated on this this verse i thought that see now in genesis 21 we move from it just being a promise that i'm going to visit you sarah at the time of life now we're moving to the stage of manifestation and what i'm saying is that as the bride of christ we have to move from just promises and quotes at some point in time we have to step into the manifestation of it hallelujah and i want to i need you to understand the manifestation the way it works is not you doing anything except surrendering that's all god needs a surrender like i said mary never heard anybody preach about the holy ghost with her what is this but she didn't argue with it she just said be it unto me according to your word i don't know i don't know anything that you're talking about i've never that is foreign to me but be it unto me according to your word god came down in genesis 18 and he visited abraham and sarah and uh he came with two angels as he was coming down to visit them and and uh and god himself was sitting there you know having uh calf and milk cornbread whatever it was sitting there eating with with abraham and sarah and uh and and sarah was as he began to just kind of have conversation with abraham says you know uh now i told you that i was going to visit you and sarah is going to have a have a child it says uh yeah i remember that and now you've got to remember also abraham laughed at the promise too those of you that are bible readers abraham laughed at the promise when he first heard it hallelujah but sarah laughed and it seemed like she got in trouble because god said why is sarah laughing i just told you i'm going to visit him while sarah laughing with his back turned to the tent very easy for us to put that scripture and apply it to brother branham's ministry very easy very easy glory to god i see that too says he says but but when she laughs at why is sarah laughing behind us in the tent why is that happening sarah say i didn't laugh he says uh uh yes you did i heard you as soon as i made the promise you start laughing at it and you know what some of us come to church we hear the word of god preach to us and we laugh with unbelief that can never happen to me but one day god's going to stop you laughing and he's going to show you that what i promise is going to come to pass he said he says why is sarah laughing i wasn't laughing yes you were laughing say oh you did this you did that but we we can stop there but i love this scripture in hebrews 11 11. it shows a different side of sarah just like it has to show a different side of us yes there might have been a season in our life where we doubted the promises of god we doubted whether it would happen or not but but some some at some point in time maybe this could be the service where god ignites something in your soul he said god i believe that word hebrews 11 11 says through faith also sarah herself i like the way paul writes this not not just i'm not dependent on abraham's faith sarah say i have my own faith in god hallelujah sometimes you can't just depend on daddy's faith and depend on mama's faith but there must come a season in a time where you begin to stand on your own faith hallelujah because god don't have grandchildren through faith also sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered with child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who it promised she moved from laughing to one day judging god faithful to the promise that he made oh god when the bride can recognize who she is the prophet said the rapture will go as the bride we got to recognize he's faithful that made the promise to us something happened in sarah not just a change in her body but maybe a change in her attitude let me go a little deeper on this story because brother branham gives us insight you want to know why sarah seemed seemingly got in trouble when the angels showed up when god himself and the two angels showed up and had had fellowship there at abraham's house sarah was actually uh upset with abraham the brother brandon tells us this she was just coming out of like an argument with him and her argument was what look at lot and his wife down there in sodom and look at look at what she's doing down there but i'm dwelling in the planes because sometimes our sisters don't want to dwell in the planes is that okay to say that my face is too plain i gotta add this and i gotta add that my dress is too plain so i gotta do this i gotta do that sisters don't like dwelling in the place but you can get a visitation from almighty god when you're dwelling in the place her attitude was wrong and this is why when she got in trouble with god's because of what her attitude was the argument that her and abraham was just having ain't that something out of an argument god comes to visit this house you need to think about these things because we this is practical we go through things like this but god wants to come and visit your house how many might have come into the house of god today just leaving the argument i had a brother in my church shared this he said you know the husband and wife uh they came to church and had just finished arguing and um in the car and they got him to the church and um and wife was just sitting there she didn't have an attitude of gratitude she was just sitting there you know and then the husband just oh praise god glory amen hallelujah the wife looked at him and said how can you be such a hypocrite acting like that knowing the argument that we just had how can you do that in the house of god he says well you know the reason i can do this because i wasn't mad at god i was mad at you i'ma praise god we got to learn how to keep that keep it out there but come in and give god the glory and the honor and the praise because of what he's done for you as an individual the bible says and the lord visited sarah as it said and lord didn't say as he had spoken other thing i want you to get here when god came down to genesis 18 he was in a physical form when he made the promise to abraham in genesis 18 in the body of a man god was standing there but in genesis 21 he does not come back in a physical form the bible says and the lord visited sarah as he had said and the lord did unto sarah as he has spoken for sarah conceived and bear abraham as stunned as old age at at the set time of which god had spoken to him and abraham called the name of the son that was born unto him whom sarah bear to him asked isaac when god came in genesis 2 1 it was not in physical form this time he comes the same way that he came unto mary he came in spirit form i'm here to tell you that for this promise to be made manifest in you for you to step into the vision that god has for his pride in this hour is going to be not by might not by power but it's going to be by the spirit if the spirit brought it to pass in sarah and the spirit brought it to pass in mary the same spirit will bring it to pass in us oh hallelujah hallelujah we just got to step into the vision there's a testimony here that i want to share as i bring this to a close i was inspired by something brother branham spoke in the message wisdom versus faith and he talked about brother welch evans brother welch evans was the brother who went to church brought all of his family and all his belongings he was there in church drove miles to get there he gets there to church and as he's there in the service of the lord the devil attacks him while he's in the church and while he well you know can you imagine go i'm going to hear the prophet i'm going to hear and i you know usually brother ram speaking a prayer line takes place everybody knew they were going to experience the presence of god everybody knew that so brother welch is there and while he's there outside in the parking lot the devil takes his car out the parking lot runs off with it guy just takes off he comes down he's like oh where's my car brother sat the service is over he's just fellowship whenever where's my car my car's gone oh lord what is this all my belongings in there i drove so far and my car why they steal my car brother evans it's just beginning to get a little concerned and they got to the prophets like brother branham would you please pray we don't know what to do the car is going we don't know what to do brother ramsay just calm down relax everybody just relax relax let's pray and as you begin to pray the holy spirit quicken to and and i want to tell you this will happen to you sometimes in your prayer god will quicken a scripture and when he quickens that scripture you just stand on that scripture and not only that when he quickens it repeat the scripture back to him remind god of what he said to you in his promised word so this scripture was quick and quick and the scripture said uh if you abide in me and my words abide in you then ask what you will brother branham quoted that scripture back and said lord we're asking that brother wells will get his car back and while they were praying a vision popped and brother branham said oh i see a young man he's driving the car he's going to turn the car around he's bringing it back to this city brother welch you're going to find the car over here did you have a whole tank of gas says yes so you're going to have half a tech when it gets back it's going to be sitting there just go get go get your car told them exactly where to go now brother adam said when they prayed the because the young man that stole it used to be a christian he was a backslider brother branham said the prayer actually had something to connect to the prayer has something to connect to so what happened is that he ended up under conviction because he used to be a christian and god could deal with him still mamas and daddies i want to tell if your children used to be christians just say a prayer over that child and let the word go after the child and bring them back in oh it's not by might it's not by power but by the spirit of god the spirit went after that man because it has something to attach to and it the prayer they seal the prayer in the name of jesus and the prayer went after the man started dealing with him in his heart and then he turned around and brought the car back all they did was sin the word i encourage you to do the same thing just send the word of god my brother welch seemed to always have testing trials with cars but welch was selling a car said i'm selling this car for 400 first person give me 400 they can buy it and i i'll be good well this fella comes along and it says uh i'm interested in your car okay well great so i just like to take it for a test drive you don't mind sure no problem you know it's all good you know fella got in took up a test drive but did not return stole the car so brother branham told brother welch it says you know uh i don't know why what that happened what happened we're just commit it to the lord in prayer that's all we can do god showed the prophet no vision on this one just committed to the lord in prayer and we'll just see what god does so just prayed over it kept it before the lord and brother welch had the right attitude in the midst of it and one day uh there's some brothers that were in the church and they said brother welch you know that car you you uh you you that man took he said we saw the car over in the city of bowling green it's sitting in bowling green right now he says is that right yes it's in bowling green the bill will say okay well you know that's about 30 miles from here that's i'll just let it be i won't i won't worry about it but one uh one day brother brother bradley finished preaching sermon and they were leaving to come to florida and brother brother branham saw a vision of brother welch getting his money for the car not getting the car but at least getting his money but in this vision god told him not to tell brother welch brother welch had to catch the vision and then step into it so here you know brother welch is going to go with brother branham to florida and they they they've got this trip planned and as they're as they're on the way brother branham gets in the car brother brother evans and sister evans and brother brother brother ram said you know brother welch we're going to go through bowling green on our way to florida that's all he said brother will say bowling green that's 30 miles out of the way why are we going to bowling green hey brother brother well we're just going to go through bowling green on our way to florida holy green all right you want to go to bowling green that's fine you want to go to bowling green but what i don't understand this 30 not 30 minutes out of the way brother brandon said he couldn't say nothing so finally brother welch was sitting there just kind of pondering and thinking as they're driving brother brandon praying please lord let him catch you please god let him catch you please god let him catch it i'm just driving and i think the holy spirit is saying please let the bride catch it please let the bracket please god let them see what's written about them brother welch say you know uh brother branham said yes you said we were going through bowling green yes you know that man that got my car he's in bowling green yes well the ex brother branham says if it were you and somebody had your car and stole it like that what would you do would you go get your money he says well since you asked and all brother he could he never told him it was a vision he just said he just answered the question says if it were me i would go get my money well say okay well let's go they pulled up right to the man's house knocked on his door and they knocked on the door the man was so alarmed to see him like oh welch yeah looks like you're enjoying the car four hundred dollars sir the man didn't have it so he got whatever he could out of his house and gave it to me hold on let me go to my neighbors went to the neighbor's house borrowed the money to remain in balance gave his brother welch and he walked out there with us four hundred dollars didn't realize he was in a vision but he had to catch it and when he caught it he had to step into it by knocking on the door to receive his money hallelujah church we have to be able to catch what god is doing you're not here in this church by accident god has called you to be his bride and you're here to reproduce christ and you don't have to do this on your own god just needs some merits people that will say lord be it unto me according to thy word god bless you god bless you [Applause] several word of prayer this prayer as the musicians would come lord jesus we realize god that when you speak to us it's not for naught it's not because you have nothing else better to do you have purpose in everything that you do you have purpose for the prophet picking up his pen and writing lord and the angel of the lord the spirit of god the holy spirit wrote these things to us and father you're bringing it back to our remembrance again because you want us to step into this the bride has the mind of christ lord and uh she knows what he wants done with the word it's been placed in us it's been planted and it's the seas have been growing for for years lord just as the promise had to wait for mary to come on the earth god i believe this promise that you spoke and pick up your pen and write wait for a group of people to come to the earth and these people would step into it father prayed it god you would help us to be all that you have called us to be that we won't fall short of the promises that you've made to us help us to be like sarah who somewhere along the line something changed and she began to believe she had faith in the promise she had faith that you were able to perform what you spoke to her help us to hear your voice god and to become all that you've called us to be god i pray a special blessing upon brother paul the pastor of this church this church his precious wife and children family his mom his brothers sisters but all the saints and god just looking at the testimony that you have given them and father my
