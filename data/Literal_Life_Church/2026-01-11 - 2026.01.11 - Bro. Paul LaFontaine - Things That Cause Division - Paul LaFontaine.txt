Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Bless you, Jesus. Amen. Everybody said, "Amen." &gt;&gt; From the depths of our hearts. Praise the Lord. Thank you girls for that special and leading us into that worship and those thoughts of God that uh are the most amazing thing is how much he has loved us. &gt;&gt; Uh even when we've been unlovable and even when we didn't even know him, he was loving us. He loved us before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; We appreciate him this morning. God bless you all in Christian love. It just feels real good to be in the house of the Lord. Feels good to be someplace warm, but the warmness of the the fires of God, we just appreciate it. I love going to church. I love the fellowship of the word. I don't have to preach. I just want to be in his presence. &gt;&gt; I just want to be wherever he is. &gt;&gt; And I appreciate him so much this morning. It's been a very um busy and eventful week for us as a family. And um the baby and mom are doing well. And I know I've watched it this week as I was there Monday to Friday. The only reason I'm I've come home is because everything just leveled out with uh with little Letty there, our granddaughter, and also my daughter. And uh just I watched I watched your prayers in action and the prayers of the saints around the world. And I want to say how much I appreciate it watching that firsthand because it could have went a lot of different directions. It could have been extended their condition. And uh they're both doing very well this morning. And uh I thank the Lord for it. She's going to be, I believe, a healthy little girl. And uh so we appreciate you lifting us up this week and uh just being that uh strength that we needed, you know, during this time. We felt your prayers and uh so it's just, you know, it's kind of funny. I don't know if any of you set your New Year's resolutions. Some of mine were to have a more disciplined schedule. And I wrote it all out and planned it all out. This day I'm going to do this. And the whole week is completely changed. And isn't that about right about life? You know, we try to set things, but God has his his interruptions sometimes that he's going to get glory out of things and we need to always be sensitive to him interrupting our schedules because he might want us to do something for him. &gt;&gt; And uh so it's his plan and it's his his calendar that I'm more want to be submissive to than our own calendars. Praise the Lord. God bless you this morning. Let's turn in our Bibles if you would to Proverbs chapter 6. We're going to read a couple places this morning. And I uh I'll do just a little switching to what maybe we're used to. Just be a little bit more pastoral this morning and do it might be end up being some instruction. I want to talk about things that cause division and uh hopefully it'll be a blessing to everybody, but uh sometimes we just get in this mode a little bit. Want to give some instruction and pastor away. Uh sometimes a pastor will get into these things where others ministries wouldn't. And so just maybe to uh give some good teaching in this area and things that cause division sometimes that we don't recognize that would cause division. And there's one thing about division. We know the author of the one who wants to divide the body of Christ. And that's not necessarily you or I. It's the devil &gt;&gt; because he hates oneness. the fair the Pharisees picked up stones against uh Christ when he said I and my father are one. So as the bride is coming into not just a revelation of it, she's actually becoming one with the bridegroom. That's what's happening. Uh you can imagine the enemy is fighting your life much more and also fighting because the oneness and the unity is not just with Christ but it's with one another. &gt;&gt; And that's an amazing miracle because uh you all got different mindsets. You have different backgrounds. You have different opinions. And uh so to bring that together and to find humility and find a way to bring us as one because Jesus not only prayed that he and the father was one but the bride would be one with him and they would be one with one another. That's quite a tall order &gt;&gt; especially when you got opinions and uh some opinions like yours. It's a difficult task. It would be a miracle. And uh but you know I I want to help this morning and be to look at these things a little closer because it's not just that he dividing from the enemy is what the denominational spirit is. Brother Brand when he referred to denominationalism there sometimes he talked about dividing and separating the body of Christ. So he he's about conquering and dividing. So he's about dividing us. And so that's when we have a spirit of divide. It's denominational whether it's under the guise of the message or not. It's the it's the enemy's work. &gt;&gt; Uh so we don't want to be denominational, right? &gt;&gt; We don't want to we if we see those traits, that's what we've come out of. &gt;&gt; So we're looking for something greater in our lives. &gt;&gt; So we want to just try to maybe not fix things. It was so funny yesterday uh coming through uh Seattle going to the airport. I seen this plumbing truck. It says Universal Plumbing and the slogan was uh we're we are to uh we are to repair what your husband fixed. I got a kick out of that one. I thought that's good. Well, I'm not here to fix anything here this morning, but um I just want to be used of the Lord to look at this subject a little bit. Don't know if we'll finish everything, but um we'll just look at it. Proverbs chapter 6. And we'll use this as a foundation starting at verse 12. A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward m forward mouth. He winkketh with his eyes. He speaketh with his feet. He teacheth with his fingers. Forwardness is in his heart. He devisth mischief continually. He sweth discord. Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly, suddenly shall he be broken without remedy. These six things doth the Lord hate. Yay, seven are an abomination unto him. So here's seven things that are uh uh things that the Lord hates and also uh abominations. So this is really should perk our ears up. We're often read from things in the new the Old Testament in the law that are abominations to God. And things that are abomination don't really change. God doesn't change. If if it was an abomination back then, then it's still an abomination today. Why? Because God doesn't change. In the Old Testament law, there's so many of them. And some are dietary laws and things that we don't use today, but there are some things that don't change. The Ten Commandments don't change. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And uh there are abominations. A woman shouldn't wear that which pertainth to a man, even pertains to a man. You never want to leave a hint that when you walk out, sisters, you walk out, then you leave even a hint that you're masculine. God's not made you masculine. &gt;&gt; So that that is still true today. So, but these are strange things that God hates because we can jump onto the Old Testament law, but these are different things that we would expect that God hates. A proud look, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief, a false witness that speaketh lies, and he that sweth discord or divide among the brethren. Now, when we look and say, see, God's going to express what he really, really hates here, then we're thinking maybe we're thinking a dress code or we're thinking outward things or we're thinking of church order. Uh, but these are the things that God hates as well. And probably we should pay attention to this because we don't want to be under a spirit that would be manifesting these things &gt;&gt; because God hates them. I got a feeling that the reason he hates this so much is because he's a god who's trying to bring oneness with his people to himself and also oneness amongst themselves. And so he would hate anything that tries to kill that oneness. &gt;&gt; And remember what I preach, I I say this to young people a lot as well. Whatever God hates, we want to hate it too, &gt;&gt; right? We want so much Holy Ghost that whatever God whatever smells God bad to God, we want it to be the same with us. That's the way we want to live. I want to read one more place in 1 Corinthians 1 just so that we don't say this. This principle is only true in the Old Testament. Well, then we get to the new church, one of the message churches here, the Corinthian church. All the Ephesians and Galatians and Corinthians, all the little churches were little message churches that rose as a result of the ministry of the son of man. 1 Corinthians chapter 1 and the Corinthian uh local church was an interesting one. So, but he says to the fir in the first chapter of uh 1 Corinthians, he says to them verse 10, I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you, but that ye perfectly be joined together in the same mind, and in the same judgment. For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of Khloe, that there are contentions among you. This is not a Jewish church. This is not a church that believes another God. This is the church of the living God. This is a this is believers who have the Holy Ghost. and he's going to be honest with his uh prophet eye and say, "I've heard this, but I also see this that there's contentions and divisions among you. This shouldn't be so. &gt;&gt; This shouldn't be so." Um, just before we pray, I was I was it was interesting to see he ends second Corinthians, where is it here? I didn't plan to read this, but he ends on the same subject. 2 Corinthians 13 verse 11. He ends the both chap both books saying the same thing. Verse 11. Finally, brethren, farewell, be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace, and the God of love and peace shall be with you. So he starts it with saying the goal is to be of one mind. And he ends it. So that must be the theme of all the things he says in the to the Corinthians. We have to allow the Holy Ghost to bring us into one mind, one accord and to to dissolve the divisions among us. Heavenly Father, we ask for your help today. And Lord, I just want to pause and say thank you for the restoration of my granddaughter and my daughter. Lord could have went a different direction, Lord. You but you heard the prayers and cries of the people in our family. And I'm thankful this morning they're healthy and they're moving along. And I just pray you'll be with them. And my wife who's there with them. Lord, I just pray you give them strength. It's been a a weary week for us. But Lord, you have you have restored us and you have answered back to us and we're thankful. We love you so much. Certainly love these people who have showed their hunger for the word to gather here this morning. I love them, Lord. I uh I see their love for you, their love to worship you. And Lord, that's a challenge for me to stay close to you that I could feed them, Lord, your word. Thank you, Father. Thank you for your love. You have loved us more than any other love we've ever known. And I pray you'll bless the word this morning in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Forgive me. I just wanted to read the meaning to that forward man. Not forward but forward. It's not a familiar word that we use but it is mentioned other places in the Bible. A forward man. And there's not it's it's it's nothing good about this kind of man. Forwardness is the quality of being stubbornly contrary, disobedient, uncooperative, characterized by a reluctance to yield or comply. often involving perverseness, uh, peevishness and a rebellious or rebellious or difficult to manage attitude with roots in old English meaning turned away from what is right or expected. It's an archaic word frequently used in the Bible to describe a heart or a mouth inclined towards evil, deceit, and sowing discord. So, it's not just his heart, it's what comes out of his mouth. It's towards evil, deceit, and sowing discord rather than following righteous paths. His actions are tied to devising mischief or sowing discord or division. And so you look at these some of there's many scriptures about it, but you look at these other scriptures if you guys don't pull mind pulling them up quickly. Proverbs 4:24, it's uh this describes a man. It's in his heart. Mischief is in his heart, but then it comes out of his mouth. So, it's a big mouth problem. It's an uncontrolled mouth. It's a mouth that gives itself permission to say anything it wants to say at any time. It doesn't matter what damage it does. This is a man who does not have the Holy Spirit in control of his mouth. Now, I know that the Lord has if you have the Holy Ghost, he has control of your soul and lives with the control of your soul. But that's not all the further we go in this message. The word has taken us even the prophet mentioned he said to be transformed by the renewing of the mind. Brother Bham says now that you've been saved now that you've been baptized now that you been filled with the Holy Ghost. Now he said we let the word transform our minds and change our thinking that we can grow beyond just having the Holy Ghost. That one place he says the Holy Ghost begins to grow out and pushes out and it all of a sudden grabs your mouth. It grabs your eyes that you don't look at the wrong things. It grabs your heart. It It just takes control. And uh but Proverbs 4:24 says about his mouth, "Put away from thee a forward mouth and perverse lips put far from thee." Proverbs 8:13. I don't know how quick you guys can pull those up. Proverbs 8:13, "The fear of the Lord is to hate evil, pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the forward mouth do I hate." Proverbs 10:31. The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom, but the forward tongue shall be cut out. Proverbs 10:32, "The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable, but the mouth of the wicked speaketh forwardness." And the last one, Proverbs 16:28. Proverbs 16:28, "A forward man seweth strife, and a whisperer separateth chief friends." This is how powerful this is. Is that it actually takes close close friends, close unions, and actually uses its tongue to separate the closest friends. &gt;&gt; That's the enemy. &gt;&gt; That's the devil. &gt;&gt; The spirit that takes this person and gives them permission, I don't want to spend a lot of time on the forward man, but you should study it. The spirit that takes this person and gives them permission to spill anything out of their mouth at any time seeks to divide. Sometimes a person has this on them and doesn't even realize it and has not learned that what they're saying is dividing people. What they're saying is is is is hurting the church. What's coming out of their mouth? How many remember the children of Israel when they were murmuring in their tents? Nobody could see it between except those that were murmuring the mom and dad and the children. They couldn't hear it. They thought they were hiding it, but God heard the murmuring in the tents and he went through Moses and said, "There's murmuring going on. &gt;&gt; There's things being said that shouldn't be said. This is dividing the people. THIS IS DISRESPECT TOWARDS THIS PROPHET, TOWARDS THE PILLAR OF FIRE, TOWARDS the leadership of the Lord, towards the unity of the the children of Israel." And God identified it. And so now the closest friends can be divided by this spirit. And and we watch how we we've seen this firsthand as a pastor watch it come into the youth group. Watch it come into the church and people that were closest friends in the youth group, people that were closest friends in the church or it could even be in a business. They're not as close anymore. Something divided them. And when you step back as a pastor and you look and you watch someone take that spirit, it's out to divide even the close. It actually resents close friendships. And so they're going to say things, did you know this about person? Did you know this about it? And so underhandedly, they're taking the closest friends and dividing those friends up. &gt;&gt; So moving along, here's my take on the verses 17 and 18. Now, if you if you still have it there, if you still have it open to Proverbs 6, 17, 18, 19, the six the seven things that God hates. I'm moving along now because I I want to preserve the time. But in 17 and 1819, this is kind of my this is uh this is breaking kind of se uh seven seven seals here on the things that God hates. Um you never hear much on the you hear a lot about the seven seals but not so much about these seven things that God hates. Uh so this is the mystery behind the seven things. This is kind of the Lefontaine standard revised version of verse 17, 18, and 19. If you could read it together. Number one, pride makes him think he knows everything and is better than anyone. So his pride puts others down. &gt;&gt; That's just my amplified version. &gt;&gt; Number two, he draws quick conclusions of people and things before the facts are in &gt;&gt; and he goes ahead and tells the lies whether he's found out the truth or not. The next one is he finds dirt on people who have not done anything wrong. They are innocent. But he finds dirt and he brings up dirt on people. &gt;&gt; If he hasn't heard anything, he can concoct his own lies in his imagination and tell those things and say those things not based upon truth but based upon his own imagination. &gt;&gt; Next one. If he sees something that causes or creates mischief or he sees something that's damaging or talk that's going on or some type of mischief is damage or playful trouble. They they don't say, "Well, we're just doing it out of joking around." It's playful trouble. They're making mischief. They're doing, you know, kids that get into mischief and they're just playing around, but it can be dangerous. It can be dam damaging sometimes. And so this person sees others doing this and he doesn't run away from it. He runs towards it &gt;&gt; because he loves to find mischief. He loves to find something like that. And so he he does it he he runs towards it instead of away. He joins in with it. He don't run away from gossip or or correct the gossip going on. And I just wanted to say to you here that that we have taught these things for years and we believe that we have learned how damaging gossip really is. &gt;&gt; When you've been through things as a church, then you teach that the the less that you can say that's not edifying, the better. In other words, train your mouth. Say, "Lord, let my mouth watch it. Watch my tongue, especially when I'm home. You can talk real nice here, but it especially when I'm with my family or with someone else or another believer in the church to watch my tongue because we have learned in this congregation how damaging the tongue can be and how bad gossip can be. &gt;&gt; The prophet preached a sermon one time uh and he he said, "I finished that." He said, "I felt like I covered every exposed every sin a person could do. place was convicted, everything. And one sister come up in his church and said, "You didn't hit me today. Good message, but you didn't hit me." She runs off and and he said, "Well, that's good. I'm glad you're living so close that, you know, it didn't hit you." And the brother comes. Do you know her? Do you know she's the worst gossip in the church? You forgot to hit gossiping. She got by that Sunday anyway. &gt;&gt; And this morning, I'm not here to personally correct anybody. I'm I'm here to bring the word of God and I'm here to grow sons and daughters of God to adoption. &gt;&gt; Can I get an amen? &gt;&gt; That's where we're at. And so growing to adoption isn't just that we understand the mysteries and the seven seals. That can tend to bring without character that can tend to bring an arrogancy to it. &gt;&gt; That can TEND TO BRING PRIDE to it. So when the rubber meets the road, we want to let the character grow in many areas of our life. as Paul says in Ephesians to grow up into him in all things. &gt;&gt; Come on now. That's Bible. To grow up into him in all things. And so you can't be spiritually mature and emotionally immature. &gt;&gt; Your emotions and your spirit must be under God's leadership as well. &gt;&gt; So if we're talking about adoption, it's not just growing spiritually and in the word. It's growing emotionally that your emotions and your life and your mouth is lined up with the maturity of where the word is taking you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, if this is a service that doesn't hit anything in your life, then God bless you. Stick around. The Lord has your number. &gt;&gt; So, did I finish him? No. He So, he he runs towards the gossip. We don't believe in gossip around here. I just wanted to say it. We don't believe in it. We don't believe in running our tongue. I don't know what church that you come from 10 years ago or what you grew up in, but we want to set the record that whether it's me or you, we want to be careful what we say because it can be damaging because the the the enemy can use it even though if you think it's innocent, it can be used to be damaging. So, we we want to just set that this morning and I trust you take it in in in a good spirit. So, now we we don't we we run away from it. I think it's good if you hear gossip going on. I think you should good be good to politely correct that. And we've had people leave sometimes because they were used to an environment of gossiping and they get corrected by someone here and it's just like they they quickly leave because you either make a choice. You can grow in the Lord into maturity and character or you can keep things the way that you had them. But I think we should correct it sometimes and change the conversation and certainly not don't run towards those types of houses of gossip but run away from those things. So he runs it he actually joins the club of mischief. He joins it. He didn't run from it. And then he he also he's not an eyewitness. I uh excuse me. Uh yeah this is he's not an eyewitness to something but steps into the witness stand and tells the lies anyway. That was number six. So he hasn't seen it. He doesn't know it. He's not an eyewitness, but he makes himself a witness in a court case and puts himself on the stand and tells the lies anyway. And the last one is he sews discord among the brethren. He plants little seed thoughts by his words in other people's minds against other people. He sws the seeds of divide to divide the body of Christ or to divide a marriage or to divide a home. &gt;&gt; Discord means Kenny, I want you to come up here a minute if you would. Discord means number one, disagreement between people. And second, I was really surprised to see this and I'll let Kenny on the fly see if he can give me a a visual or something here. The second meaning to discord is is a lack of harmony between notes sounding together. If you don't know music, you have the the melody part of the song, which we all sing usually the melody, but the harmony is what makes it so nice because there's there's harmonizing notes that go with it to make it more beautiful. &gt;&gt; So, we want to have harmony in the body of Christ, right? So, but in order to have really good harmony, you have to make sure those harmonic notes. Uh, and you could ask Kenny at depth about this. He'd know this. My sister Sharon would know these things. In order to have that, you've got to have those harmony notes because there's a lot of notes on that piano. But you have to bring that note in the harmony with that melody line. And if it's not in that, then we realize we're going to recognize right away it's not in harmony. We're not in harmony. Something's wrong because somebody is playing the wrong note. &gt;&gt; Even people that are not musically inclined. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I won't mention names here. You should be able to recognize this. And I'm going to ask brother Kenny to play Amazing Grace if you would. If you haven't prepared something yet uh in the last 10 seconds, I want you to play me amazing great beautifully with all the harmonies that play Amazing Grace just as nice as you can play it. [Music] Okay, now just play the melody line without the harmony. [Music] Okay, so that's pretty, but I like harmony. I like to sing with my siblings like I last did last Sunday. I don't like to sing by myself because the melo it's it's it's good, but then add in the harmonies with that and play it again. It's just prettier. [Music] That's a big difference. That's a That's a church that's playing in harmony &gt;&gt; with the great conductor &gt;&gt; according to the sheet music. &gt;&gt; And I was at a I I I went to the Toledo Symphony a couple years ago and everything Brother Brandham preached just come alive because you see that everybody had to be so disciplined. You couldn't play your own music. Everybody had to be disciplined to play to the music that was in front of them. And everyone had a different instrument with a different sound to it. Was trained different on the instrument. But when they come together as an orchestra, they had to be disciplined to not do their own thing, but to play according to the music of the director, the conductor or the one who wrote the music. &gt;&gt; And I couldn't believe the discipline. And I thought, my I know there's probably a lot of liberal people in there that do their own thing in a lot of ways, but I was amazed that they're disciplined to say we do it according to music. It was so disciplined and it was just and it was beautiful, beautiful music. It would have been chaos if somebody was doing their own thing. Now, if you can play it with getting some of those harmony notes off because it's not just that harmony is beautiful, but then the persons that playing the harmony parts with the melody has to be on note too and play the notes, right? Or it would sound like this. [Music] Woo. That's enough. That's enough. Thank you. We were cringing at all that. Some of you don't even know music and you're cringing at it. If he played that way every Sunday, we'd fire him. But that's a good piano player that can play good and he can play bad to give an example. Uh and by the way, I taught him everything I know. He grew up in my church and he's one of the best. One of the best. The Lord's blessed us. One of the best. And uh if I had just if I had just an afternoon with him, I could really show him some stuff. I'll tell you that. But I'm over here cringing and you're cringing because that ain't the way it's supposed to be. &gt;&gt; That ain't the way. And it's all because he just moved one little finger and some little finger got rebellious. &gt;&gt; Just one of the fingers and all it got rebellious and played something that wasn't in harmony with the melody of the song. &gt;&gt; So when when it says divide is is that the harmony is not there. It's not. It says a lack of harmony between notes sounding together. The notes are supposed to sound together. &gt;&gt; And when someone gets off note, someone gets off key. I've told you about when I was a uh in junior high, I played with the orchestra and uh I played the tr uh the um the baritone or the tuba. And so uh me being a little bit have the ear for music, I was learning that. But just to make a long story short, when we all got our first first got our instruments and we played together uh in in front of Mr. Cunningham, it sounded it it was it was atrocious. It was terrible. And then as we went through the school year and we kept playing, it didn't get too much better. I mean, it was just the kids were learning how to play music and it was it was a little bit closer, but it just and I and so now we're coming up on the final season concert and I knowing music and I wouldn't sound that great either, but knowing music, I said, "Are we actually going to have a concert and play in front of our parents when we sound like this?" I wanted to ask Mr. Cunningham that. And I didn't, but I said, "This is going to be a disaster. This sounds bad." And what happened was is that the last day of the concert about two hours before we all came in and every person took their instrument into a private office with the director by ourselves and he had a little tuning machine and we blew that blew a note into that machine and he seen how much was off and he adjusted our valves, he adjusted this, he tuned the strings of the violin, he tuned the instrument up. &gt;&gt; The director alone personally &gt;&gt; tuned each instrument. &gt;&gt; It wasn't a part of the master. But but when he tuned it individually in that secret place &gt;&gt; when there was a little room &gt;&gt; that you individually tuned the instrument, then we come out and everybody was tuned. And when we got out there that night, it actually was beautiful music because each instrument had been tuned. &gt;&gt; And I learned so much as a boy that listen now. It's not just that you have an orchestra. It's not just that you have the sheet music and the message. We've got the sheet music. &gt;&gt; We've got the director. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; We've we've got all the things that we need. But if you have all of that and you don't go home and get with Christ and have him tune up your life, &gt;&gt; we're not going to have harmony in this church. &gt;&gt; You're not going to have harmony in your home. &gt;&gt; You're not going to have harmony in your marriage because you have to be teachable, correctable, and to let God to just move those little vows. I I felt like saying to Mr. Scrum, why didn't you do this at the beginning of the year? Please. But maybe it was to teach us a lesson that you not only have to be a part of I'm in the orchestra, I'm in the body of Christ, I'm in the bride, &gt;&gt; but there is an individual tuning up &gt;&gt; that God does to our lives. &gt;&gt; So all of these words in Proverbs 6, God hates all of these words and these actions. Why? Because he hates divide in his people. It's the opposite of what he desires. That we will all be of the same mind through perfect love. That's his desire. And this is a miracle that Satan fights against. This is a miracle that Satan hates. This is what he comes against as oneness. Even more is when a people with all different opinions and backgrounds and personalities and being emotionally damaged by our past to make all of that submissive to a greater thing that God wants to create. That's a miracle in itself. AND GOD HAS ALREADY PROPHESIED THAT MIRACLE WILL TAKE PLACE THAT THAT GOD AND HIS PEOPLE WOULD BE ONE. They would BE ONE WITH CHRIST. There is a marriage at the end time. There is an indivisible union with Christ. Can you say amen? And it will bring that atmosphere of divine PERFECT LOVE AND THE BRIDE WILL BE functioning only by the motive of divine perfect love. That's right. &gt;&gt; So something is working in our in our under our message that's greater than gifts. &gt;&gt; And he taught the Corinthians this because they were so gift bent. &gt;&gt; The gifts were all there. Praise the Lord. But Paul in 1 Corinthians 13 and ma basically the whole uh a whole chapter of Corinthians, he's trying to teach them there's something that wants to work among us greater than our gifts, greater than the pastor's gifts, greater than the musical gifts. &gt;&gt; What if God takes your gift away? In other words, why what if you can't do it anymore? Who are you then in Christ? That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So maturity is growing beyond lifting up the gifts and he wants to do something greater than our gifts. Our identity is NOT RELATED TO JUST OUR GIFT. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said BY THIS SHALL ALL MEN KNOW &gt;&gt; that you are my disciples by your love one for another. &gt;&gt; So that sounds real denomination. It is. It's what it's what Christ the word said. &gt;&gt; By this thing, the whole world will look and say that's God's people. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of Christians on the face of the earth. There's a lot of churches. But when I meet this person and I get around them, that is God's people. &gt;&gt; And by this shall all men know that you're you are my people by your love one for another. &gt;&gt; I wanted to make this point before I go further with this this morning. is it's a point about division because there is a side to division that is correct. In other words, it's where Jesus said in Luke 12:51, suppose ye that I'm come to give peace on the earth, I tell you nay, but rather division. Now, this seems confusing if you don't understand it because the word actually brings separation. The word brings division. He said in John 7:43, so there was a division among the people because of him. So now we see then when the word comes it will cause a separation but the word will bring the separation not you. &gt;&gt; So there is a division that I'm not talking about this morning but I wanted to mention it to you because somebody might say well what about what Jesus said he didn't come to bring peace but a divide and separating from families. Abraham separated from his kindred in order to come to his inheritance. all these other things. There's a truth there, but it's the word that will bring that and not you intentionally bring it. You just live the word. You embrace the word. GOD WILL DO THE SEPARATING THAT HE HAS TO DO. BUT WHEN we intentionally do it, something's wrong. Now, &gt;&gt; I realize you have there's there's things and the word will lead you to separate from the things of the world. &gt;&gt; Can I get an amen? The word will, if you get IN THE WORD, CHRIST will lead you to separate from the things of the world, to separate from the wrong kind of associates, to separate from things that are weakening you, to separate from the wrong kinds of movies and the wrong kinds of uh uh uh uh WhatsApp and and social media, the word, IF YOU GET CLOSER to him, you're going to be separating from that stuff &gt;&gt; and sometimes associates. So there is a division that happens, but it's the word that causes that. And then we have the scripture to not be unequally yolked together with unbelievers. This is a divide that's godly. God calls for it. But the devil is to divide God's own people internally. We know this. Satan is the author of this. Denominationalism divides the body. You say, "Well, I don't know. I I I I'm not talking about the people. I'm talking about denominational systems for 2,000 YEARS HAS NOT BROUGHT THE ONENESS of Christ. It's brought divide. &gt;&gt; It's brought pride. &gt;&gt; I know the way to life. Our denomination is the only way. &gt;&gt; So denomination divides. It's a spirit to divide us. If it doesn't do it on doctrine, which it tries to do, he will use other things. Satan, if he can't separate us on doctrine, he will use other things. He will use anything to divide us. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I often read this funny little story to my staff or sometimes when ministers or pastors when I'm talking to them, and I know this seems a little strange, but it we must be aware that this is how the enemy can work. There was a church where the preacher and the song leader were not getting along. This began to spill over into the worship services. And one week, the preacher preached on commitment and how we should dedicate ourselves to the service. The song leader led a song that said, "I shall not be moved." The next Sunday, the preacher preached on giving and how we should gladly give to the work of the Lord. The song leader then led the song, "Jesus paid it all." There's a real tension going on here. Yeah. &gt;&gt; The next Sunday, the preacher PREACHED ON GOSSIPING AND HOW WE SHOULD WATCH OUR TONGUES. The song leader led a song, I love to tell the story. The preacher became very disgusted over the situation and the next Sunday he told the congregation he was considering resigning. The song leader led a song, "Oh, why not tonight?" And as it came to pass, the preacher did resign. And the next week informed the church that it was Jesus that led him there and it was Jesus that was taking him away. And the song leader then led the song, "What a friend we have in Jesus." People have a hard time laughing freely at that. I always get joy out of it because you know why? For 35, 40 years, I've watched how the enemy can divide even the leadership. &gt;&gt; And he uses sometimes very small things to do it. Sometimes it's big things, sometimes it's not. That's not the point. And sometimes God orders a separation in your life. But we need to be always submissive that the devil doesn't use us as a part of the problem. and the tension doesn't get to this place become so carnal. That's what uh Paul called the Corinthians, carnal. Their immaturity was carnal. We're not called to be carnal in our reactions. So, I want to move on to some things that cause division. I know this is very different this morning, but I trust it'll be a blessing to you. Let's move to the New Testament and some things out of Corinthians that we can see. Now, these are believers, the little churches now, and one of them is the Corinthian church. They're all different with many kinds of people, different people, different uh cultures, different backgrounds, different religious backgrounds. There were the Gentiles in the churches and then there was the Jews in the churches. And the Bible's pretty clear to show that often the tensions rose when the Jews wanted to hold on to something from their past church upbringing. And the Gentiles were scared of certain things, too, because they had worship, but it wasn't right worship. And so you bring all this together in a church and you realize if you don't understand how the enemy works, he'll use those things to cause divide. &gt;&gt; And so I'm going to name seven of them here that uh that I'm sure there's many more, but uh these are the things I'm bringing this morning. If you guys want to bring those seven things up, this is what I find as we're going to read through these things this morning. In other words, seven things that uh bring division to glory in men or to glory in flesh. &gt;&gt; I'm going to read it here in a minute. &gt;&gt; When we start gloring in men or gloring in their flesh, whether it be the prophet or a pastor or someone else, uh those that's something that causes division in the body. Number two, handling matters with immaturity &gt;&gt; that causes division. Number three, intentionally to wound a weak conscience. This is in the Bible, to intentionally wound a weak conscience or a weak brother. It says though that those that are strong ought to bear the infirmities and the reproach of the weak. &gt;&gt; We don't put down the weak that are not strong in the Lord yet. &gt;&gt; Can I get an amen? We do not belittle or put down someone who's not strong in the Lord yet. If we're really strong in the Lord ourselves, we are to bear the reproach and bear the bear that until they are strong. &gt;&gt; So, we're not too critical of somebody who's expressing some actions that we know are not right. We are not to belittle that, say, "Man, I'm not even sure you're part of the body of Christ the way you're acting. I know you don't have the Holy Ghost. I'm going to show you today." We're not to have that attitude. WE'RE NOT TO DECIDE WHO HAS THE HOLY Ghost and who doesn't. &gt;&gt; We don't have A RIGHT TO DECIDE WHO'S bride and who's not bride. &gt;&gt; To do that is immaturity. &gt;&gt; And so handling matters with immaturity. Number three, intentionally wound a weak conscience. Number four, selfish and self-centered. If we have that, it causes divine. Number five, living a different life at home than at church. Say, how in the world does that cause divide? Well, it did. Back in Joshua's day when somebody brought something in their home that wasn't right, it had an effect on the whole congregation. &gt;&gt; So, that's immaturity to say, "I have my own private life. I have what I want to have." But it can damage and bring divide in the body of Christ. Number six, being no number number five. And then number six, being unforgiving. An unforgiving spirit will cause divide. And number seven, raising personal preferences lifted too high. &gt;&gt; Sometimes a personal preference of somebody becomes a religion. &gt;&gt; And sometimes they can have quotes to prove it. &gt;&gt; But if you fight for that thing and I want to make this a part, THIS NEEDS TO BE A PART AND I'VE GOT A QUOTE for it. There's something already wrong in your attitude. Can I get an amen this morning? You don't take your personal preferences, even if you feel like you've got strong things to endorse you. Be careful how you handle that and enforce it on everybody else. &gt;&gt; Things that cause divide. If you get your Bible, we're turning to First Corinthians again and we're going to work through each of these things. That's what we're going to do. All right. 1 Corinthians, if you get real quiet, then I'm prepared for that. 1 Corinthians 1, after he says what we read in the text, 1:10, I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and the same judgment. For it have been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of Khloe, that there are contentions among you. Now this I say that every one of you saith, I am of Paul, and I am of Apollos, and I am of Cphus, and I of Christ. Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul? I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Christmas and Gaes, other people baptized them. Because they might have leaned to this carnal way of saying, "Well, Paul baptized me. &gt;&gt; He's the man. He's the prophet of the hour. I was baptized by him. &gt;&gt; Carnal, immature, &gt;&gt; divides the church. &gt;&gt; My pastor, he's h he's the cat's meow. You guys ought to owe to go to our church. &gt;&gt; Carnality, immaturity, glorifying flesh &gt;&gt; divides the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Lest any of you should say that I had baptized in my own name, and I baptized also the household of Stephanus. Besides, I know not whether I baptize any other. For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel, not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made none of effect. And he goes into this, which you've read probably more frequently than the scriptures I read before. For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness, but unto us which are saved. It's the power of God comes down to the foolishness of preaching. So, always remember that there's not some ultra star that's going to be lifted above Christ in our ranks. It's still flesh. And he chose the foolishness of preaching to save people because that man is still flesh no matter how great his gift is. &gt;&gt; And then he says in through that subject 27:29 I want to catch, but God has chosen the foolish things of this world to confound the wise. And God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty and base things of the world and things which are despised. Hath God chosen yay things which are not to bring to not things that are why verse 29 that no flesh should glory in his presence. &gt;&gt; We're going to maturity now. &gt;&gt; It is wrong and it it divides when we begin to lift up someone in their flesh and glorify their gift or their flesh. It takes away from the glory of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it divides the church. &gt;&gt; People lift up men too much. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; People lift up men too much. Even in our own rank sometimes dividing over who has the best. Dividing over who has the best church. Dividing whoever whoever has the best teacher in the message, whoever has the best. And this is the divide. And Paul's rebuking it. It's very denominational. Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; I was just having uh breakfast with a brother uh that a couple brothers, but they said, "I listen, I've been to Pentecost. I came out of Pentecost, been there, done that, got the t-shirt. There was so many attributes of it that became wrong and off the word." He said, "I didn't come out of Pentecost to go back to those attributes again." And one of them was all this glorifying of the stars and the and the great preachers and this guy and this guy. get him in for your convention and all this. He said, "I seen all that in Pentecost. I'm disappointed to see it in our own ranks. &gt;&gt; I'VE COME OUT. I'VE BEEN TO PENTECOST. THERE'S NO RAPTURING FAITH BACK THERE." &gt;&gt; And we are certainly supposed to be growing out of &gt;&gt; Pentecostal traditions. And this is one of them Paul brought all the way back in the Corinthian church. This is going to divide the body of Christ. If you say, "I'm of here. I'm of &gt;&gt; I'm of this one. &gt;&gt; I'm of that one." &gt;&gt; Everybody get it? &gt;&gt; Second one. 1 Corinthians 6. Would you please? And we have to move through these quickly now. And this is the second one, which is handling matters with immaturity. All right. 1 Corinthians 6. Darian of you having a matter. I just underlined that word matter because matters come up. Matters come up. If Paul said if you have a matter then there was matters and it matters how you handle matters. &gt;&gt; Put that on your refrigerator this week. &gt;&gt; It's very important. And so dare any of you having a matter against one another, go to the law before the unjust and not before the saints. Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? And if the world shall be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters? &gt;&gt; What is he saying? You don't have the maturity to handle the smallest matters amongst yourself. &gt;&gt; You are so carnal that you couldn't work it out amongst yourself. So you had to go sue one another and take it to a worldly court. This is why we don't believe in suing one another. Why? Because we should have the maturity to deal with matters amongst one another to be the adults in the room and come and say, "Listen, let's talk about this. Let's get this resolved. Let's get this reconciled. Let's not gossip about it for six months. Let's sit down for sometimes it's very short time and we work this out. Did you say this about me? Did you did you do and you get it worked out and when it's over you do what's called reconciling." Now, in reconciling, you don't necessarily always fully agree, but reconcile can reconcile even if you don't fully agree. Hopefully, you come to an agreement. Hopefully, there's repentance. Hopefully, if somebody DID SOMETHING WRONG, YOU MAKE IT RIGHT. AND WHEN YOU MAKE IT RIGHT, BOTH OF you leave that room as adults saying, "This is done. It is over. I will never let the devil use it ever again. It's &gt;&gt; finished. It's reconciled." &gt;&gt; We've been given the ministry of reconciliation. reconciling the world to Christ, reconciling believers in the seed of God to Christ. It's the ministry of reconciliation. Well, if that's true on a higher level, shouldn't it be true among us? Can I get an amen from anybody? &gt;&gt; You You can't let the devil continue to use something and fester and immaturity is what caused them to go to law with one another. There's so much in here. I'm going to ask you to read a lot of it this week yourself. Verse three, know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life. You know what he's saying? We're being groomed and we're being prepared handling little matters of life here because we're going to judge angels someday. &gt;&gt; And if we don't have a maturity to judge matters between us and our wife and us, &gt;&gt; we're probably not ready to judge angels. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, brother Paul, I'm ready. I I I'm going to be a judge some. I'm going to rule and reign. Well, your whole attitude says, "I don't want you ruling and reigning over me." &gt;&gt; If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church. &gt;&gt; I speak to your shame. Is it so that there is not a wise man among you? No, not one that shall be able to judge between his brother. But, brother, that's pretty sad when there's not a adult in the room. But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers. Now therefore, there is utterly a fault among you, because you go to the law with one another. Why do you not rather take wrong? Why do you not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded? Nay, you do wrong and defraud, and that your brethren know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God. So, let me just skip and just add in if I can. Uh, no, that's that's the last. So children can't work out their fights with one another, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They need adults most of the time to step in. And so this is sad. That's why I say what causes divide is handling matters with immaturity. This is a whole another sermon and maybe this the Lord will let me get into it this year. But the whole immature emotional immaturity hinders you growing in spiritual maturity. All right, the third one. 1 Corinthians chapter 8. And this is intentionally wound a weak conscience. 1 Corinthians chapter 8. Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffth up, but charity edifith. Divine love will to will edify, would build up. Pride will tear down. And if any man think he knoweth anything, he knoweth nothing, yet he ought to know. But if any man love God the same is known of him, as concerning therefore the eating of those things which are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other god but one. We know that. So in other words, this big issue of um the Jews were taught not to eat any meat sacrificed to idols. We realize that with Daniel and all the the stories. And then the Gentiles ate things and they were to other gods. So you have this tension because people were hesitant of what they ate. It made him cause they have a lack of faith. Is that is that from uh is that sacrifice to idols? Well, where did this meat come from? And so it made him a little nervous. And Paul says, "But we have the knowledge uh we know that the idols nothing in the world and there's none other god but one. For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or earth, as there be God's many and lords many, but to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him, and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and by we by him. How be it, there's not in every how be it there's not in every man that knowledge. For some with conscience of the idol unto this hour, eat it as a thing offered unto an idol, and their conscience being weak, is defiled. But meat commendeth not us not to God. For neither if we eat are we better, neither if we eat not are we worse. But take heed. This is the warning. Lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to them that are weak. &gt;&gt; So we could say, well my goodness, grow up. There's nothing to that idol. It doesn't mean anything. There's no other gods except our God. Go ahead and eat it. But you see, if they're weak yet, we wait until they're strong. We don't get an attitude, you're way behind, you're so, you know, we don't get that attitude and we're actually, if we in our attitude create a stumbling block for a weak one, we're dividing the church. &gt;&gt; Verse 10, for if any man see thee which hath knowledge, sit at me to the idol's temple, shall not the conscious of him that is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols? and through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish for whom Christ died. But when we should never want that to happen that a weak brother gives up &gt;&gt; because of our actions, &gt;&gt; because we're flaunting it. I have this liberty. It doesn't bother me at all. You know, &gt;&gt; that's just as wrong as the brother that's weak. &gt;&gt; That's what Paul's teaching. We should never want to put a stumbling block in front of anybody's way. And I won't have time to go into it today. The more Paul talks about it. We are in a suffering. We are in a sacrifice. And we sacrifice our own wants and wishes and even sometimes our little liberties &gt;&gt; in the name of maintaining unity in the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; I tell ministers this as I've been privileged to train some of them or at least talk to them about what we do. And I say, "You know what ministry is? It's not just being behind the pulpit. There's several places Paul says to Timothy and different ones. It's the suffering and it's the sacrifices you will make so that you can live a life that the people have confidence in you. &gt;&gt; But most young preachers, young ministers, and some that aren't even called, they just want pulpit time. &gt;&gt; But ministry is so much more than pulpit time. When you look ahead and see the sacrifices you'll make as a minister, &gt;&gt; probably a lot of them would bow out &gt;&gt; because you suffer, you sacrifice, you your family sacrif they've sacrificed things in the name of presenting the very best of this message to the church of God. &gt;&gt; Verse 11 verse but verse 12. But when ye sin, so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ. Wow, that's pretty strong. Wherefore, if meat make thy brother to offend, I will eat no flesh, while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend. All right. And that's where he says it in chapter 9:12. If others be partakers of this power over you, are we not rather, nevertheless, we have not used this power, but suffer all things lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ. So he's saying even as far as giving, I have the power to take the giving, but I'm I'm not going to take that because I'm going to suffer that cuz I don't want somebody to be stumbled by that. &gt;&gt; That's maturity. &gt;&gt; That's maturity. All right. So now number four. Uh okay. Where where am I at now? Now go to chapter 10 if you would. Which number are we on? Okay. Number three, okay, chapter 10 and verse 23, he deals with it again. All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient. All things are lawful for me, but all things don't edify. So Paul lives in a freedom here. He doesn't live by a law. He doesn't live by something that's just no relationship with Christ that it's just dos and don'ts. All things are lawful, but all things are not experienced. And all things don't edify. So if you're going to go out and say, "I'm allowed to do this. I can do this." But it doesn't edify someone else. It actually tears someone else. It hinders their conscience. &gt;&gt; Be careful of that. &gt;&gt; Because everything we do is to edify, is to build up the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Let no man seek his own, but every man another's wealth. &gt;&gt; Whatsoever. See that? See, that goes to the un the unselfishness. Whatsoever sold in the sha. Okay, let's let's just catch 23 through 33. Okay, he's still dealing with it. So, we don't want to excuse me for just slowing down here. I I'll be mindful of the time, but I want to slow down and make sure we catch these things. For if the uh verse 25, whatever is sold in shambles that eat, asking no questions for conscience sake, for the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof. If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be disposed to go, whatsoever is set before you, a eat, asking no questions for conscience sake. But if any man say unto you, this is offered in sacrifice unto idols. Eat not for his sake, that showed it uh and for conscience sake, for the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof. Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other. For why is my liberty judged of another man's conscience? For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I even spo evil spoken of? for that which I give thanks. Whether therefore ye eat or drink or whatsoever you do, do all to the glory of who? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Give not offense, neither to Jews, nor Gentiles, nor to the church of God, even as I please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved. What's it about? Unselfishness. It's about living a life of o to others, not just selfishly. I'm going to do this myself. I have the liberty to do this. So when you talk about number four, selfish and self-centered, that covers it. That that chapter covered it. Is that when he says the profit, we're in this for the profit of not just ourselves, but the spiritual profit of ourselves and others too. So if your profiting spiritually is not profiting others and actually discouraging others, there's something wrong with that. &gt;&gt; There's something wrong with that. &gt;&gt; Let's go to number five. Number five says, "Living a different life at home than at church." Now in 1 Corinthians 5, uh in 1 Corinthians 5, back to first 5, it is reported commonly that there's fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles that one should have his father's wife. So, there's a bit of an incest thing going on in the church. In the church, uh a uh a man is getting with his uh uh stepmom and is committing wrong things with her. This is in the church. This is in the message ranks. &gt;&gt; Unfortunately, it's not supposed to be named among us, but these things can happen. It's a shame when it happens, but it happens. It happened in the Corinthian church. under Paul the prophet and I'm just going to I'm going to summarize so we don't have to read all you know what happens where Paul rebukes this and the reason I say living a different life at home in the church that's what he's going to correct but one of the things he corrects is how the Corinthian church was acting they were actually covering for it they were pretending it wasn't happening and this boy was coming taking communion being a part of the service probably got his hands lifted he's worshiping you know and everybody begins to learn he's having an improper relationship with his stepmom know, and the church knew it was going on and didn't do anything about it. Well, he's worshiping. Just let him come and worship. So, I'm hoping I bring a balance today that that can divide the church as well. &gt;&gt; Is that we're letting sin just sit there and not do something about it. &gt;&gt; And Paul said, "Deliver up such a one." They took him out from underneath the blood. We rarely do that. But Paul says this is something to shake that person to say you're dealing with the body of Christ. You're dealing you're disrespecting the body of Christ and so we'll let you to yourself and let God deal with you. Okay? And the church had to act mature to do that. &gt;&gt; Is anybody on board? That takes a maturity, a love in maturity to deal with that situation. So we don't if we don't deal with that, that's hurting the person. We It's hurting the body. It's hurting everybody else. And so he's telling the church, you're being very immature and not dealing with that. You're pretending. Listen, you I'm going to get to the other side of this a minute. How we handle matters that we see in the church. But if you see something, you need to go to prayer because you don't want that sin. If you hear something, wait till it's confirmed. But be careful what you say. You need to go to the Lord. Say, "Lord, don't let that sin go." God expose that thing. And God may even do use you to do it, but we're not going to let it go on. And we're going to pray because it will divide the body. It will spread to other places. I've watched congregations and if adultery stop starts, if you don't nip it in the bud, it just keeps passing throughout the congregation. &gt;&gt; Leadership has to deal with it. Someone has to do it. Well, let the Holy Ghost deal with it. But you got to act on what the Holy Ghost is doing to deal with that sin in the camp. &gt;&gt; Oh, let's maybe it's the preacher. Well, uh, oh, we don't want to ruin his ministry. We don't want to. No, don't say nothing. Don't No, you're obligated. If it's sin, &gt;&gt; you're obligated to say something to the right people and get this sin dealt with. &gt;&gt; Something wrong with the preacher who want to live. You're helping him pretend. You're helping him. And that's what Paul's saying in this chapter is that they're not they're they're living a different life at home than they are in the church. And letting that sin go on is not something. So you read that if you would on your own. Uh he said, "Put away that there can be no leaven in the lump." And you know, I think it's it's pretty straight how he deals with that. But here's here's the other side. Second Corinthians 2, this is forgiveness now &gt;&gt; because God dealt with this man. &gt;&gt; And in second Corinthians chapter 2, God dealt with him. He repented and he wanted to be restored back to the church. And the people were hesitant. Paul has to address it again. And he even says here, I was pretty straightforward how you should handle that situation. But now that he's repented, let's read what happens here. Because if you have just all correction without forgiving someone who's come back to God, &gt;&gt; we're going to give you about five years to prove yourself. &gt;&gt; Be careful of those limits you put on things. God can restore heart in a second. &gt;&gt; They may have to grow, but you don't know where that heart is. And so you don't set time limits on you being cordial to them, &gt;&gt; you treating them right. &gt;&gt; You see, &gt;&gt; so it was I'm glad this was in here. It's in here for a reason. 2 Corinthians chapter 2 verse one. But I determined this with myself that I would not come again to you in heaviness. For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad? but the same which is sorry by me. And I wrote this same unto you less when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice, having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all. For out of much affliction and anguish of heart, I wrote unto you with many tears. Paul didn't want to have to write that for them to deal with that. Not that you should be grieved, but that might that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you. But if any have caused grief, he has not grieved me, but in part that I might not overcharge you. sufficient to man to such a man is this punishment which was inflicted on many. Took him out from underneath the blood. Let God deal with them at that time. And I've heard it said, be careful of you making contact with somebody like that and trying to, you know, just out of your emotions, you know, oh, I hope they don't feel so bad. Leave them alone to God. &gt;&gt; Let God deal with them his own way. This happened. He came back sufficient to such a man as his punishment which was afflicted of many. So that contritewise ye ought rather to forgive him and comfort him, lest perhaps such one be swallowed up with over much sorrow. Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love towards him. Can I get an amen? &gt;&gt; For to this end also I did write that I might know the proof of you whether you be obedient in all things. To whom we forgive anything, I forgive also. For I forgave anything to whom I forgave it. For your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ. lest Satan should get an advantage of us, for we are not ignorant of his devices. Well, here's a way Satan can get in to cause divide, a lack of forgiveness. &gt;&gt; And he'll get the advantage over us if we have a lack of forgiveness to say, "Brother, I thank the Lord that you have been restored. I embrace you. I comfort you. I will encourage you in the Lord." Amen. &gt;&gt; I will say I'm so straight and forward this morning and corrective that I will compliment this congregation that we do get compliments from those outside that come and those who have been in sin that when they came back they were not belittled. They were not looked down on. &gt;&gt; The congregation rejoiced that they were back. &gt;&gt; If you're back this morning we rejoice that you're back. God bless you. [Applause] Just come and be broken with us &gt;&gt; and come and grow with us. Cuz if everybody say everybody, I know what it means to be broken. &gt;&gt; I'm still broken in some ways, &gt;&gt; but I'm under the right word. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Let's do the last one. The last one is uh personal preferences lifted too high. Wish I had about an hour on this. But now we go to Romans chapter 14. We go back to where he's actually dealing with the eating meat and things like that. But this takes a little bit deeper. Romans 14:1. Him that is weak in the faith rejoice receive ye but not to doubtful disputation. So now the way Paul's saying it here is that him that is weak, weak conscience, we talked about before, someone who is not strong yet receive but not to doubtful disputations. And years ago, the Lord taught me what doubtful disputations. And when I looked it up, what it everybody put their seat belts on now, okay? Because you're going to need some maturity to look at this. Doubtful disputations has one meaning that said things that are not expressingly black and white in the scripture. &gt;&gt; Boy, you're on scary territory, brother Paul. Because we think that things are just expressingly black and white in the scripture and the message. And I'm here to tell you sometimes it's not. And maybe God allowed some of the things as a test for us to let our character kick in instead of our religious pride to take that thing and make it a religion for us and everybody else. &gt;&gt; And he calls it disputations because they're doubtful things, but they're things that cause arguments. That's why I make the seventh one the last one here is that when we take our personal opinions or our things that aren't necessarily you got a lot of strong message on and you lift it up as being this is A STANDARD AND EVERYBODY OUGHT TO BE ON that standard. It creates division and it creates disputations and it creates arguments in the body of Christ. And when you peel back the layers you don't have too much to stand on. It's just a personal opinion. &gt;&gt; You're preaching it as if it's message. &gt;&gt; I have a beard today. But when I was a kid in our ranks, of course, I couldn't had beard then. There was nothing coming out. I'm not looking at you guys. No. But when it finally came out at I don't know 50 years old, I said, "Okay, I finally got one. and I'm used. But back then, my dad, he was he and this is an example of laying down your life for ministry. He he had a mustache and uh so then God called him out some places to preach. Well, the first place he went somewhere in Ohio, first place he went, the pastor was offended because he preached against mustaches. He said it's wrong. And he said there's some He said there's a quote. Brother Ram says when when the man has a mustache, he's hiding something. Said there's a quote. Oh, Brother Ken, are you here today? Ken Slacka. He's not here. &gt;&gt; Brother Ken's been with me since we started the church. But Brother Ken and I have been looking for that quote for 40 years. We still can't find it. What? &gt;&gt; Upper lip. &gt;&gt; It's only hiding his upper lip. That's true. &gt;&gt; Technically, it could be right. He's hiding his upper lip. &gt;&gt; You know what my dad did, though? He went home. I remember this as a kid. He shaved it off. Now, did he have to? No. But if he was going to get invitations, and that was an issue back then, he didn't want to go in and offend anybody and that be a stumbling block. So, he couldn't minister to the people. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine being up there and you got your mustache, you know, hanging out and only 80% of the people are going to receive what you're preaching. &gt;&gt; I'm I am taken back. I'm leaving here. I can't believe he's got a mustache. &gt;&gt; So, I teach ministers sometimes is that this is the sacrifices you'll make sometimes. &gt;&gt; Is it important you just go preach or is it important you live a life that's sacrificial? Actually, the first time I heard Gloria Gaither speak, she said the same thing. She says, "We go to churches from the very beginning." And she says, "If we learn they believe a certain thing, &gt;&gt; she said, "I'll tell my girls that are going to be on stage to back off of dressing that way because we don't want to offend that church." &gt;&gt; God bless her. &gt;&gt; Most of the music world is not stuck with that principle, but it's a biblical principle. &gt;&gt; They don't we don't just go and flaunt things. And so the principle here that I'm trying to teach you is and Paul says in the Bible is that we don't re we receive but not to doubtful dispensations. In other words, we we have fellowship together but don't make those things cause arguments and divisions. &gt;&gt; It's not worth it. &gt;&gt; What are those things, brother Paul? I'm not gonna talk about those because if I get into that it just gets into personal opinion. I mean for years it's like the basketball out here and there should be no sports. First time I went to Honduras I was in a pickle because they're asking me they had questions and answers and I got the young people on this side probably 200 young people and I got all the ministers all mostly in Honduras over here and the old generation said you couldn't play any sports at all. It was against the word. &gt;&gt; And the young people sent the question up to me. Is it okay to play volleyball? Is it okay to play soccer? &gt;&gt; Mhm. That's the kind of things you get in the middle of the Lord gave me an answer. It was real simple. Well, I said, "Brothers," I said, "I know hunting is a sport." And &gt;&gt; guess what? It settled it. &gt;&gt; It's a prophet. He He was a hunter. That's right. &gt;&gt; Hunting is I'm telling you it the place calmed down. They've been playing volleyball ever since I left. That was 30 years ago. And soccer. I If you hear that, I was the cause of it. But there's not a thing. It's It's not the thing. It's the thing what people make out of it. If it's a spirit of competition, that's wrong. If it's going in all these places with a bunch of naked bodies, that's wrong. You see, but I brought it in front of my church. I I brought it because I had to deal with 20, 30 years ago. I dealt with the subject of Christmas. I dealt with subject of basketball. I brought a basketball to church and I held it in front of the people. I said, "There's no sin IN THIS BASKETBALL. THERE'S NOTHING IN IT." PAUL said there's nothing of sin of itself. There's nothing evil of itself. It's not the instrument. It's what you do with it. It's the spirits that can go with it. &gt;&gt; Held it in front of the church. Is that, you know, AT TIMES WE'RE GOING TO PLAY BASKETBALL HERE. There's not a thing wrong for the boys to do that. If they got caught up up in it, if they started to wear their hair like basketball stars, &gt;&gt; we got a problem. &gt;&gt; It's an identity problem. &gt;&gt; But the innocence of playing volleyball or basketball, incidentally, uh Clayton, he's doing tremendous on his team there at Stateline. My boys all played &gt;&gt; and thank God for his Christian example. He's in a Christian school, but thank God he's a light in that school. And uh he does pretty good job there. I got I understand we got some young football players too, right? All right. Yep. Let me know when you're playing. Come out and see how well you do. But you know, it's like all these things I'm not going to see. I mentioned one Christmas. I'm not even getting into that. But later scripture says, "One man esteemth one day above another day." And that was in the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; And if you don't esteem it, well, praise the Lord. But don't you dare lift something up. &gt;&gt; It's really funny. Last week after Christmas, let me say this. &gt;&gt; I get some responses. H that's a little too much. And then I get these quotes sent to me that Brother Random says, "We got some gifts for the kids today at Christmas. They're under the tree." And I'm going, where's the tree at? So, I've got to research that. But I'm just saying to you, we cannot carnally take things &gt;&gt; and make them into something that would cause divide. &gt;&gt; We should respect every person and where they stand. &gt;&gt; And whatsoever is not of faith is sin. In other words, brother Brand says, if you have a doubt about something, don't do it. &gt;&gt; And if you go do something, oh, they're doing it, so I'm going to go do it. No, no, no. What sort of faith? If you can't do it in faith, then I'd be hesitant of that. &gt;&gt; But I do will tell you, you better check out and let the word balance you out because a lot of times for years we heard this was said, this was said and it made a standard and they're not standards at all &gt;&gt; in the word. I've got things brothers are quoting sometimes and I hold my tongue because not in this church but other churches that I'm going to ask them where what what Bible scripture do you have to preach that and what quote because there's none and you're preaching it. I say if God has given us the stabilizers in the ship, his word, we ought to hang our lives close to what he said &gt;&gt; and not our own opinions. &gt;&gt; I'm not got a bad attitude. I I think everyone is entitled to my opinion. Fusses come over preferences. Can you say amen? Would you mind reading this? I think they got it here. Would you mind giving me a few more minutes? &gt;&gt; I'm getting close. But let's read Romans 14 in the Amplified just so we understand what it means. Romans 14:14. I don't know if Ian got that for me or not, but this is the Amplified. And you can read along. Ro, excuse me. No, it'd be Romans. Yes. Romans 14 and verse I think it goes back to verse one. As for those ones whose f faith is weak, accept him into your fellowship, but not for the purpose of quarreling over his opinions. One man's faith permits him to eat everything, while the weak believer eats only vegetables to avoid eating ritually unclean meat or something previously considered unclean. The one who eats everything is not to look down on the one who does not eat. &gt;&gt; And the one who does not eat must not criticize or pass judgment on the one who eats everything. It's probably me. Oh Lord, I'm glad my wife's not here to hear that. For God has accepted him. Who are you to judge the servant of another? &gt;&gt; Before his own master, he stands approved or falls out of favor. And he who serves the master, the Lord will stand for the Lord is able to make him stand. I would like to preach another sermon. Who are you to judge another man's servant? &gt;&gt; Who are YOU TO PREACH ACROSS your pulpit and slam another man how he's leading his church? &gt;&gt; He doesn't come under YOU AS MASTER. HE HAS A MASTER AND THAT'S THE LORD. &gt;&gt; SO HOW GOD LEADS HIM TO LEAD THAT CHURCH, WE OUGHT TO LEAVE IT ALONE. We ought to support it. We ought to pray for them. BUT IMMATURITY IS BASHING THEM FOR HOW they're leading the church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So who are you to judge another? So verse five, one person regards one day as a better, one more important than another, while another regards every day the same as another day. Let everyone be f fully persuaded, assured in his own mind. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I looked up the unofficial holidays and all the things that sep celebrate. There's like hundreds of them now. Ice cream for Breakfast Day, International Cat Day, International Clients Day, International Dark Sky Day, International No Diet Day. That should come after the ice cream for breakfast. International Students Day. International Surfing Day. No, that one should come after eating ice cream for breakfast. Surfing. That would be good. international talk like a pirate day. I couldn't believe all of them, but I thought it was kind of funny because someone could say, "Yes, I want to celebrate this day. I want to celebrate this this National Dog Day or I want to celebrate this we eat this certain thing day." No problem. You have the freedom to go do it. Just don't come and tell me &gt;&gt; to make it a church doctrine. We ought to bring this in here. We, you know, this is I found some quotes on this and I found a scripture. We ought to incorporate this. I'm not interested in incorporating anything that's not on the pure balanced word of God or adding anything or taking anything away because every time you add to this MESSAGE SOME STANDARD THAT'S NOT REALLY THERE, you bind the people up. &gt;&gt; THERE'S ONLY FREEDOM IN TRUTH. [Applause] been around too many years where they attach something and I'm trying to find that quote on mustaches and every time you do it, you bind people up &gt;&gt; with standards that aren't there. &gt;&gt; Now, all the ones that are standards, I'm going to preach them. I'm not going to leave anything out for anybody's feelings. That's my duty as a pastor. If God leads ME TO READ THAT QUOTE, I'm going to read it. And if it takes the very hide off of the people, I'm going to do it. &gt;&gt; If it's the word, But I have no business adding to it or you setting a certain day. What if so? So so let's finish the scripture. He says one person regards the day verse five better more important than the other while other regards every day. Let everyone be fully convinced assured satisfies in his own mind. He who observes the day observes it for the Lord. He who eats eats for the Lord since he gives thanks to God. While he abstains abstains for the Lord and gives thanks to God. None of us lives for himself, for his own benefit, but for the Lord. And none of us dies for himself, but for the Lord. If we live, we live for the Lord. If we die, we die for the Lord. So then, whether we live or die, we are the Lords. For Christ died and lived again for this reason, that he might be the Lord both of the dead and the living. But you, WHY DO YOU CRITICIZE YOUR BROTHER? OR YOU AGAIN, WHY do you look down on your believing brother or REGARD HIM WITH CONTEMPT? FOR WE WILL ALL STAND BEFORE THE JUDGMENT seat of God, who alone is judged. For it is written, as I live the Lord, every knee shall bow and every t tongue shall confess praise to God. So then each of us will give an account of himself to God. Then let us not criticize one another anymore, but rather determine this, not to put an obstacle or stumbling block or a source of temptation in another believer's way. I know him, I am convinced as one in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean, ritually, defiled, or unholy in itself, but nonetheless, it is unclean to anyone who thinks it is unclean. If your brother is being hurt, offended because of food that you insist on eating, you are no longer walking in love towards him. Do not let what you eat destroy and spiritually harm one for whom Christ died. Therefore, do not let what is good a good thing for you because of your freedom to choose be spoken of as evil by someone else. For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking what one likes. The kingdom of God is not eating or drinking or what one likes but of righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. For the one who serves Christ in this way, recognizing that food choices secondary is acceptable to God and is approved by men. So then let us pursue with enthusiasm the things which make for peace and the building up of one another, things which lead to spiritual growth. Do not for the sake of food tear down THE WORK OF GOD. DON'T LIFT YOUR PERSONAL OPINION, YOUR PERSONAL DOCTRINE or thing that's not scripturally or message-based enough. Don't lift it up WHERE IT CAUSES OFFENSE and divide in the body. &gt;&gt; Verse 22, the faith which you have that gives you freedom of choice has have you as your own conviction before God. Just keep it between yourself and God seeking his will. Happy is he who has no reason to condemn himself for what he approves. But he who is uncertain about eating a particular thing is condemned if he eats because he is not acting from faith. Whatever is not from faith is sin. Whatever is done with doubt is sinful. &gt;&gt; It's good mature teaching. Now I they didn't have this up but let me go on chapter 15. If you'd follow me in your Bibles chapter 15 and verse I'm in another chapter now. Chapter 15 verse1 15. He goes on to say, "Now we who are strong in our convictions of faith ought to patiently put up with the weakness of those who are not strong and not just please ourselves. Let each one of us make it a practice to please his neighbor for good, to build him up spiritually. For even Christ did not please himself, but as is written in scripture, the reproaches of those who reproached you, the father fell on me, the son." You know, us parents bear the reproach of our children sometimes &gt;&gt; when they're weward and they go off track and all that. It's embarrassing. But Christ bore our reproach. &gt;&gt; Christ bore our reproach. So when we have a weak saint that hasn't grown in certain areas, we bear that. We bear the infirmities of the weak until they're strong. &gt;&gt; Verse four, for whatever was written in earlier times was written for our instruction, so that through endurance and the encouragement of the scriptures, we might have hope and overflow with confidence in his promises. Now may the God who gives endurance and who supplies encouragement grant that you be of the same mind with one another according to Christ Jesus so that with one accord you may have one voice glorify and praise honor the God and the father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, continue to accept and welcome one another just as Christ has accepted and welcomed us to his glory. Last quote. It's a question that was asked brother Brandham in the first Corinthians verse 34. It says, "Let your women keep silent in the churches for it is not permitted unto them to speak. For it is a shame for a woman to speak in church. Now if a woman with short hair speaks in tongues in churches in church, it is the spirit of the Holy Ghost that speaks through her. or is it a false spirit? This is a real hard question and I can only answer it the best way that I know how. See now, I could not judge because I was not sent to judge. &gt;&gt; I want you all to be listening for this the instruction here to our lives. There's matters that have to be handled, but they have to be handled with love and maturity. &gt;&gt; And I believe these things teach this. I could not judge because I was not sent to judge. But if a person is speaking in tongues, they are anointed of God. You see, they may be out of order. That may be true. And they may be doing something that's not right. &gt;&gt; But I wouldn't want to say that it wasn't the Holy Spirit. because I wouldn't know. You see, and now and that's a that's a man of God &gt;&gt; saying I wouldn't know. Look at the maturity. &gt;&gt; In other words, he's saying if God hasn't shown me something and I don't know, then I'm not going to act on it. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to call it something right away. Now, in his preaching, did he preach it strong? Yes. But we're not talking about we're talking about a a question that was asked. How do I handle this situation? He's teaching us how to handle it with maturity. &gt;&gt; But did he preach that person can be anointed? Did he preach against a woman wearing the wrong thing? Did he preach first Corinthians 7 and 11? Did he preach? Yes. And the church has got away from it. But it's Bible nonetheless. And now there's many times that people misjudge one another. Oh boy. Can you say amen to that? There's many times that people misjudge one. I'm aware of the time It's still cold outside. &gt;&gt; And now there's many times that people misjudge one another. And it is a bad thing to do. You say, "Well, she's got short hair. She's wearing her dresses too short. That's not the Holy Spirit upon her." Don't do that. &gt;&gt; Don't do that. That's not right. You don't know what's in that woman's heart. That's right. &gt;&gt; You don't know nothing about it. &gt;&gt; Sure puts us in our place. &gt;&gt; You don't know. You think you know, but you don't really know. &gt;&gt; You know that the Holy Spirit would make her conduct herself a little better. We know that. That may that may be true. But I'll tell you as you and I let God do the judging of that. and lets you and I just pray for that person that God will show them the light. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Here's some time ago, a man met me out here outside and I had a pianist here that had a little short little skirt and it wasn't exactly I guess just right and the lady had short hair and she was just a babe in this way and she was playing the piano. It's real quiet right now. &gt;&gt; And a man met me out there and just tearing me to pieces. He said, "And you're a Pentecostal preacher." And let that woman set up there that short hair and just going on like that. You know what? No. Like, why is this guy being rough in this? Because early Pentecost, the women didn't do that. &gt;&gt; Matter of fact, in our country early on, &gt;&gt; there was a difference. And women didn't do that. &gt;&gt; Now it's a common thing. Now it's, you know, so so that's why and then the Pentecostal realms for sure it was not allowed. You know, it's because they knew the scripture on it. We've gotten way far away from that. And he's right, you're a Pentecostal preacher. Let the woman set up there that short here and just going on like everything. Well, I said, I think the woman has a good spirit in her. &gt;&gt; I certainly do not agree with that. You know, the skirt part up here and the two pieces, one of them is down here and one of kind. It's a skirt like they wear and it's so real thin and shows that underneath garment that they have around there. He's being pretty descriptive. This is a bit immodest. Hello everybody. &gt;&gt; A reminder to all of you. &gt;&gt; Don't wear something you can see through. Sisters, &gt;&gt; that's not modest. &gt;&gt; Skirt like that where and so it's real thin and shows underneath garment. They shave around. I don't think that should I don't think that should be done. I don't like that. I don't I really don't. They they might be just as spiritfilled as anybody. I don't know. God knows that. &gt;&gt; But I wouldn't condemn that woman and say that she was going to hell &gt;&gt; by the sight. This same person had in his church a lady who had long hair and wore long dresses and had a temper enough to fight a buzzsaw &gt;&gt; and just as mean as she could be. &gt;&gt; She's wearing everything right on the outside, but oh, she had problems on the inside. She probably thought she was more spiritual than everybody. But I'm telling you, I'm talking about things not on the outside that make you spiritual. I'm talking about character. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about something deeper. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about adoption, maturity. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about submission. &gt;&gt; Not to a church form. Submission to Christ the word because you want to. &gt;&gt; She had enough temper to fight a B just as me. Now, long hair and long skirts don't take you to heaven. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Long hair, long hair and long shirts don't take you to heaven. No, sir. It's the spirit that takes you &gt;&gt; to heaven. &gt;&gt; Now, you see, let me say something as a pastor here. What happens when you read that for especially young girls, they take it as an endorsement &gt;&gt; and they're going to go wear what they want to wear and nobody better say something about me because brother Paul read the quote. And so I have the awkward position of reading these things. There's a there's a quote about makeup that uh talks about if you have you don't have any color in your face and maybe you need a little color, but you shouldn't be painted up like a barn. That's not a good idea. That's there's scripture that talks about that. And also just it's the world says it's pretty. God says it's not natural. The way God made you is pretty. &gt;&gt; Character is pretty. &gt;&gt; But I'm in that awkward position. If I read this a lot then then usually now I don't understand why 50 year old women or 30-y old women take those quotes and say I'm going with it. I'm going to wear what I want. I don't understand that. I can understand someone who's just trying to get their footing. But nevertheless, we got to have a grace for everybody. We got to have understanding. There's there's some reason. It could be rebellion, but it it could be they haven't found their identity in the word yet. I completely I don't know. But we just got to have that, you know, bear with the weak until they're strong in that area. &gt;&gt; Can I say can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So, and and you know, uh anyway, you know, that's that's the position that we're in sometimes. I haven't read that quote a lot because it just becomes and that's sad that it becomes an endorsement. Okay, I'm taking that one thing. &gt;&gt; And then you got 30 other 40 other quotes that just are correcting the Jezebels of this generation. &gt;&gt; Then you cake that on and it shows you're empty inside. &gt;&gt; Oh boy. But the pastor, listen now, then you should remember that many times pastors don't mention those things. Well, look at that. I hear I'm reading it. Here I am doing it. Pastors don't mention those things. And people just automatically go on think it's all right. But a pastor should really tear into that. And then the sisters of the church, those sisters who are in character standing, wearing their clothes neatly, they should be examples of sweetness and motherly and sisterly like. And I think that any woman that's motherly and godly and sister ought to go to such a person, this girl on the piano, and with sweetness of spirit, just sit down and talk to that lady. And if she is of God, the Holy Spirit will understand those things and she'll correct herself. &gt;&gt; But when the real when when you really quickly condemn her and drive her away, you might harm that young baby. You see? &gt;&gt; So I wouldn't condemn that person. &gt;&gt; You know what he's talking about? Handling matters amongst yourself, &gt;&gt; not acting too quickly in your opinion. &gt;&gt; Does it need to be corrected? Yes, it does. But how does it get corrected? &gt;&gt; That's maturity. &gt;&gt; Kenny, musicians, come or I'll just keep preaching and preaching and teaching and keeping going on this. It's a never- ending subject. Does everybody recognize today how much our Lord loves us for these quotes and these scriptures and where he wants to take us &gt;&gt; in his word? &gt;&gt; And the divide in congregations most the time these days is not over big things, it's over little things. &gt;&gt; And we let the devil continue to divide that way. Every person should pray about where they belong. Every person should pray about where they stand in the word. Every person should know, as Paul mentioned, be fully persuaded in his own mind. And I believe that fully persuaded comes from knowing your place and your word based and you're not opinion-based. You have a right to your own opinion, but they should always be submissive to the word. And when we take our opinions and we begin to lift them and make them cause for dispute and arguments and then get in that little detail, but how long should that be? in. How long should that screw? Every time we go there, we bind things up and it brings division. &gt;&gt; There's a greater work that's working among the people of God. &gt;&gt; It's greater than pastors. It's greater than deacons. It's greater than you. &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Ghost in us. &gt;&gt; Does he know how to run a church? Yes, he does. &gt;&gt; Does he know how to correct things? Yes, he does. So, we're sensitive to the Holy Spirit to correct things as God gives the leadership to do it. And in this case, he's guiding that a a sweet sister coming in the right way to bring the correction would have more of an effect than that guy who's yelling, "Get it taken care of. Take her up." You know, I know it's the wrong attitude. &gt;&gt; The wrong attitude is taught. The wrong attitude has caused a lot of divide within the body of Christ. Listen, we are, how many would raise your hand to our country? You know, our country right now is divided more than it's ever been. &gt;&gt; And I don't know if it's going to end until the Superman, the Antichrist, comes on the scene to bring it all together. &gt;&gt; But right now, it's it's so divided &gt;&gt; and there's wrong on both sides. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I don't believe somebody should flaunt their rebellion towards the law who's trying to keep the law, &gt;&gt; but I don't agree with I hate that a woman had to die over that and get shot. I don't think necessarily that would be balanced either. I'm not choosing either side, but it just shows the divide in this country. If that spirit is everywhere and and permeates this nation and churches and organizations, then we ought to rise to our feet. Let the church of God arise. Gideon sang it. Let the worshippers arise and say, "Lord, the world can be divided, &gt;&gt; but God, don't let the body of Christ be divided. &gt;&gt; Let us run towards each other in love. except receive as Paul said. Doesn't mean we're compromising, but we're giving time for people to grow. &gt;&gt; Maybe they don't have a problem with a little bit immodest dress. Maybe they got a temper and they hide it. He needs to get rid of that temper. Yeah, he does. You better bring it to God. It's going to damage his family, his marriage. But that's only one of hundreds of things &gt;&gt; that can be laying there that God's got to deal with. &gt;&gt; If you sit still in front of the Lord and you just be patient, God will deal with every thing that's not right. &gt;&gt; That's right. in his own way. &gt;&gt; I've got a 100% confidence the leadership that we're under will deal with your lives because he knows you better than I do. &gt;&gt; He knows your background. He knows your pride. Whatever it is, if you sit still, and that's why, you know, Brother Brent says that the bride can just sit still long enough. &gt;&gt; And I've made you do it for two hours today, hour and a half. If we can just sit still, just trust, just let him do the work. Everything that's not perfectly right, he'll bring it right. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Bind us together. Key of probably bind us. Let's stand together. Bind us together with cords. [Music] Jesus, bind us, [Music] &gt;&gt; Lord. Bind us. Bind us together. Jesus, bind us together. Lord bind us together with bord cannot be broken. Jesus bind us. Bind us together, Lord. Bind us together in there is only one God. Oh, there is only one God. [Music] There is only one king. [Music] There is only one body. One body. [Music] That is what I see. One more time. Bind us together. Jesus. find us. [Music] Oh, can I be broken? [Music] Bind us together, Lord. Bind us. find us ever. [Music] Can we pray together now? Just lift your hand and say, "I don't want to do anything that offends. I don't want to live a life that sends a message out there and I live something different at the church. I don't want to live a double life because it would cause some young girl, some young young girl to stumble at that if I'm putting up something as a post on my social media that's a different life than what I'm doing at church. That's I don't want to do that. I don't want to lift my personal likes and dislikes and personal opinions to rise to a place that causes fusses amongst the people. [Music] But I want to be, as Paul said, the goal is to be in one mind, one accord of the same mind that we all speak the same thing. It's not so much we speak of the same in opinions, but we're speaking the same character that Christ has exampled to us and taught us. That's what we want to speak is the same thing. The word of God this generation, I don't want to step out of that and separate myself. say, "I'm my own body of Christ. I do my own thing." No. No. We are part of We're submissive to one another. We're we're submissive to the word, but we're also submissive to the the body of Christ that we all find that one mind and one accord. What could God do if we continue to find that? So once again, just raise your hand, say, "Pray for me, Brother Paul." that that real deep true pure submission would be there to give all of my life and character and my home life, everything yielded to him to find the right balance in my life and that I could be a light even as the prophet was saying Lord to to be some sister sweetly coming to that girl and being a light to her even in those situations we want to be a light. Lord, bless everyone that's heard this long service today. Lord, I pray that it would help us, that would strengthen us that was take a step forward, Lord, to the things that you're calling us more and more to. That church, that Ephesian church has all the word with it and all the truths and how you've called us from the foundation of the world, but yet Lord has maturity and the gifts and working with one another as a body. Lord, we believe Calvar's purchased it all. We want to take all of that, take us and bind us together by the Holy Ghost this morning, Lord. Let every selfish motive be laid aside. You know what? I've prayed for my own life this year coming year. Lord, take me on that journey, Lord, to know you more than I've ever known you before. I pray, committing each life to you now in Jesus name. Oh, I want to know you more. deep within my soul. I want to know, oh, I want to know you. I to feel your heart and know your mind. Looking in your eyes within me. eyes that say, "I want to know." Oh, I want to know you. Before we are dismissed today, could you just turn to somebody say, "I want to know him more." Pray for me. Pray for me, brother, sister, that I know our my Lord more than I've ever known him before. deep within my soul. I want to know him more. [Music] This light shining through me. God bless you as you're dismissed this morning. Thank you for giving me time. And I know it's extra time today, but it's been a joy to be in his house. If you have to be dismissed, get in, you can come and lead some songs. I love you all so much. If you need prayer for a need, this is the body of Christ. Come, come and we'll take it before the Lord. Amen. Oh, I want to know. Yes, Lord. Oh, deep within my soul. Yes, Lord, I want to know you. To feel your heart and know your mind. Looking in your eyes, [Music] know you. Oh, I want to know you. Oh. Can we sing it one more time? Oh, I want to know you. &gt;&gt; Oh God, bind us together, Lord. It's your people. Make us one with you, Lord. Make us one with you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Deeper than we ever did before. &gt;&gt; Fill your heart, &gt;&gt; Lord. To be living from your mind, the mind of Christ. [Music] For your request, we're going to read if you will for me. [Music] Oh, I want to know. [Music] Oh, I want you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Deep within my soul, I want to know. Oh, I want to know you. Feel your heart and know your mind. Looking in your eyes up within Christ, let's say I want to know you.
