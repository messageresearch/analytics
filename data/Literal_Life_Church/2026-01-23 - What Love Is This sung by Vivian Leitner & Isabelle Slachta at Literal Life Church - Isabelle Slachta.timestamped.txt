[0:14] You never change.
[0:19] You are the God you say you are. When
[0:23] I'm afraid,
[0:27] you come and steal my beating heart. You
[0:32] stay the same.
[0:36] When hope is just a distant thought, you
[0:40] take my pain
[0:44] and you lead me to the cross.
[0:49] What love
[0:51] is this?
[0:54] That you gave your life
[0:58] for me
[1:01] and made a way for me to know you.
[1:06] And I
[1:08] confess
[1:11] you're always enough
[1:15] for me.
[1:18] You're all I need.
[1:22] I look to you.
[1:26] I see the scars upon your hands and hold
[1:32] the truth
[1:35] that when I can, you always can. And
[1:40] standing
[1:41] here
[1:43] beneath the shadow of the cross, I'm
[1:48] overwhelmed
[1:52] that I keep finding open arms.
[1:57] What love
[1:59] is this?
[2:01] That you gave your life
[2:05] for me
[2:08] and made a way for me to know you.
[2:14] And I
[2:16] confess
[2:18] you're always enough
[2:22] for me.
[2:25] You're all I need,
[2:30] Jesus.
[2:32] In your suffering.
[2:37] You were reaching.
[2:42] You thought of me.
[2:47] Jesus
[2:49] in your suffering
[2:53] you were reaching.
[2:58] You thought of me.
[3:03] What a love
[3:05] is this
[3:07] that you gave your life
[3:11] for me
[3:15] and made a way for me to know you.
[3:20] And I
[3:22] confess
[3:24] you're always enough
[3:28] for me.
[3:32] You're all I need
[3:37] and I
[3:39] confess
[3:41] you're always enough
[3:45] for me.
[3:49] You're all I need.
