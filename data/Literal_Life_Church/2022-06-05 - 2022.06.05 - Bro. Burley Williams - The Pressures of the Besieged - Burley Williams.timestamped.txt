[0:01] i appreciate brother paul
[0:03] long time friend
[0:07] been a good many years
[0:13] amen
[0:18] ecclesiastes chapter nine
[0:30] 13
[0:32] to verse 18.
[0:36] he said this wisdom
[0:38] have i seen also under the sun
[0:41] and it seemed great unto me there was a
[0:44] city
[0:45] and a few men within it
[0:47] and there came a great king against it
[0:49] and besieged it
[0:51] and built great bull works against it
[0:55] and that was found in
[0:57] a poor wise man
[0:59] and by his wisdom delivered the city
[1:02] yet no man remembereth
[1:04] that same poor man
[1:07] then he said i wisdom is better than
[1:09] strength
[1:11] nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is
[1:13] despised
[1:15] and his words are not heard
[1:17] the words of wise men
[1:20] are heard and quiet more than the cry of
[1:22] him that ruleth among fools
[1:25] wisdom is better than weapons of war
[1:29] but one center destroys much good amen
[1:33] you must be seated
[1:37] i would like to uh
[1:40] uh give a title
[1:43] uh the pressures of a besiege
[1:49] the pressures of a besiege
[1:52] amen
[1:54] now
[1:56] the word besiege is a very interesting
[1:58] word
[1:59] and it got a lot of
[2:01] meanings to it
[2:03] and
[2:05] one that's interesting to me well which
[2:07] we know
[2:08] a besieged means a place with armed
[2:11] forces
[2:13] in order to capture it by force
[2:16] to surrender and lay a siege to it
[2:20] and it also means it also means surround
[2:22] with armed forces
[2:24] they say the army besieged the castle
[2:27] then it also means to press
[2:30] with a request
[2:32] it means that also so other words
[2:35] we can go through different scriptures
[2:36] in the bible
[2:38] and it gives different examples about a
[2:40] besiege and how things happen
[2:43] but the pressures i i want you to catch
[2:47] what i'm trying to minister this morning
[2:49] it's the pressure what a bc causes
[2:52] people to do
[2:54] and how it makes them act and sometimes
[2:56] people don't
[2:58] know how they realizing why they're
[3:00] acting certain way until they can just
[3:01] stop a moment
[3:03] and just stop just say hold on a minute
[3:05] because
[3:06] when things are
[3:07] happening rapidly in your life a lot of
[3:10] times we don't think we just act
[3:12] we just start moving
[3:14] and then coming to conclusions and all
[3:16] kinds of stuff and and then a lot of
[3:18] times it's wrong
[3:21] now uh in the besiege
[3:23] it's a terrible thing
[3:25] but i find in the bible
[3:27] the children of israel besieged people
[3:30] and also the people besieged them
[3:33] it depends on what happened
[3:36] and god uh
[3:37] allowed moses
[3:39] which we want to turn to deuteronomy 28
[3:42] god allowed moses to write things about
[3:45] a besiege
[3:46] to the children of israel and it hasn't
[3:48] happened yet
[3:50] because in deuteronomy a lot of things
[3:52] that moses would tell them they haven't
[3:55] even done it yet but it's prophecy
[3:58] later on it actually happens
[4:01] so we're going to see in deuteronomy how
[4:03] that moses is going to begin to explain
[4:05] things
[4:06] about what the besieged do
[4:08] and then later on they actually start
[4:10] fulfilling those things
[4:12] now
[4:13] one thing about the siege
[4:16] when the enemy
[4:17] surrounds the city
[4:20] he
[4:21] he don't he he blocks every gate
[4:24] that's the purpose
[4:25] he don't want nothing coming in don't
[4:27] want nothing going out he blocks every
[4:29] gate
[4:30] that's the first thing he don't even
[4:32] throw a weapon
[4:33] he don't even use a weapon the main
[4:35] thing is to block the gates
[4:38] so what they'll do
[4:40] which the def one definition of that
[4:42] word is a seat means to sit there
[4:45] so what the enemy would do to the city
[4:47] he would just sit there
[4:49] while they're on the inside and his
[4:52] purpose is for them to run
[4:54] resources he wants them to run out of
[4:57] resources run out of food
[4:59] and then it makes his battle easy
[5:02] once he knows that they're got no more
[5:04] food and they don't done everything they
[5:06] can
[5:07] he just say all right guys let's just go
[5:09] ahead and take it over
[5:10] and then they're so weak
[5:12] they can't even fight back
[5:14] and then in many cases once they get so
[5:16] weak they just surrender
[5:18] because also in the besieged it means to
[5:21] press
[5:22] with requests in other words the enemy
[5:25] would be on the outside we have requests
[5:28] if you just surrender
[5:30] just surrender don't fight back
[5:33] just come on out to us and we want to be
[5:35] over you you'll be fine
[5:37] you see that's how the enemy is
[5:39] he does a lot of people like that see a
[5:41] lot of people give in to pressure
[5:44] they get tired they just say well i'm
[5:46] just tired then they just give up don't
[5:49] fight back no more that's exactly how
[5:52] the devil works he wants you to get
[5:54] tired
[5:55] you know parents sometimes get so tired
[5:58] battling with the children and they give
[6:00] up on the child
[6:02] then they let them just go do anything
[6:04] they want to do
[6:05] say i'm just tired just go just go then
[6:07] the devil won
[6:09] what he done he had besieged that parent
[6:12] sat there with pressure and then they
[6:14] just give up
[6:16] we don't supposed to give up
[6:18] there supposed to be no retreat no
[6:20] surrender
[6:21] can we say amen but that's what the
[6:23] enemy does
[6:25] now
[6:26] let me just read this the the prophet
[6:28] said in the message letting off the
[6:30] pressure
[6:31] he said i thought this and letting off
[6:33] this thing
[6:34] everybody is just becoming a neurotic
[6:37] age
[6:38] everybody is built up
[6:40] haven't got no time
[6:42] and that builds up to a place that it
[6:45] breaks up things
[6:47] you know i hear people always say it
[6:49] just ain't enough time in the day
[6:52] i'm sorry it's still 24 hours in the day
[6:55] time is still the same
[6:57] it's us don't got so busy to it seem
[7:00] like an eight months time but that
[7:01] clock's still gonna flip around 24 hours
[7:05] so you can't blame it on time
[7:08] but he says here that builds up to a
[7:10] place it breaks up things
[7:14] pressure breaks up things
[7:17] and those things you can put any title
[7:19] you want on it family friendship
[7:21] relationship homes
[7:24] churches it breaks up things
[7:27] it causes people to have hard
[7:30] feelings
[7:32] when they snap them off say things you
[7:35] don't mean to say
[7:37] that's what pressure does
[7:39] see when you don't know how to deal with
[7:41] pressure you're going to do things you
[7:43] regret it happens all the time so you
[7:46] have to learn how to deal with pressure
[7:47] and i'll tell you i don't
[7:49] been through a life of pressure and uh
[7:51] and i know i can't get away from it i
[7:54] learned how to deal with it
[7:56] because i know who i am i'm a son of god
[7:58] and i know it's for a reason now this is
[8:01] me
[8:02] and i always say this because people got
[8:04] their own ideas but this is me
[8:07] i don't never ask god why
[8:12] i just don't i don't i don't say why
[8:15] why are you doing this why i don't do
[8:17] that
[8:18] whenever i go through something
[8:20] i i just say what are you trying to show
[8:22] me
[8:24] i want to catch what he's trying to show
[8:27] me or what he's wanting me to see
[8:29] that's that's what i do because i know
[8:31] it's something he wants me to see
[8:33] yeah because wise can lead up to doubts
[8:37] i'm questioning god that's what it could
[8:39] lead to
[8:40] and he says
[8:42] now everybody
[8:44] he now he said now everybody is guilty
[8:46] of it
[8:48] i am guilty you're all guilty now this
[8:51] the prophet saying that we're all guilty
[8:54] amen i asked the church the other day i
[8:56] said how many of you ever been used by
[8:58] the devil raise your hand
[9:01] some of them didn't raise their hand i
[9:03] said you were just used by the devil
[9:04] dead
[9:06] because you didn't raise your hand
[9:11] amen
[9:12] because you know and people just don't
[9:14] don't want to be honest in these day and
[9:16] time
[9:17] i just like being honest honestly just
[9:19] honest you know
[9:21] praise the lord
[9:23] he says everybody is guilty i'm guilty
[9:25] you're all guilty we do things under
[9:28] pressure that we don't otherwise
[9:31] he said there's an excess pressure built
[9:34] up today
[9:35] i believe before i go any further i
[9:37] might say this
[9:38] i believe it's the enemy
[9:40] coming down
[9:42] and pressing
[9:43] i believe it's the devil see the closer
[9:47] we get to the rapture
[9:49] it'll be more pressure
[9:51] it will have to be that way because the
[9:53] devil uses these things to bring
[9:56] distractions to keep you from the right
[9:58] attractions
[9:59] that's that's what how the enemy
[10:01] operates
[10:02] he want to throw you all focus he want
[10:04] to throw you off balance but you know
[10:06] when it comes to the end of the day
[10:08] every individual will have to see them
[10:10] things in their own life
[10:12] it's easy to point out something in
[10:14] somebody else's life but i think we need
[10:16] to just consider and look at ourselves
[10:19] can we say amen that's just the way it
[10:21] should be
[10:22] he said we know the coming of the lord
[10:24] is at hand the bible said in the last
[10:26] days
[10:27] the devil would go about like a rowing
[10:30] lion
[10:31] and you think he and if he could get you
[10:33] under pressure
[10:35] hurrying
[10:36] running over something
[10:38] you will make decisions that you
[10:41] wouldn't make if you sit down and think
[10:43] it over
[10:45] can we say man how you ever have
[10:47] somebody get mad at you when they ask
[10:49] you something then you say
[10:50] wait a minute they said why are you
[10:52] taking your time we need to know now you
[10:54] need to do something now you don't have
[10:55] people do you like that
[10:57] they want to rush you
[10:59] see when people try to rush you they
[11:01] it's a good sign too that they unstable
[11:04] in their own life so now they want to
[11:05] put that pressure on you to make you
[11:07] make a quick hasty decision about things
[11:11] amen but we we shouldn't do those things
[11:13] but this is the pressure age that we in
[11:16] it could cause those things if we just
[11:18] don't stop for a moment and just think
[11:21] that's right
[11:23] now
[11:25] the pressures of a besiege we're going
[11:26] to get back to ecclesiastes in a moment
[11:29] now turn with me to deuteronomy chapter
[11:32] 28.
[11:39] i'm seeing pressure today on so many
[11:41] different levels
[11:43] in ministries
[11:46] one thing in ministry
[11:48] there's battles amongst ministers
[11:50] because somebody done said something
[11:52] about you you didn't like it or whatever
[11:56] the worst thing a minister could ever do
[11:57] is bring that to the pulpit and preach
[12:00] his personal battle to his congregation
[12:02] the worst thing you could ever do
[12:06] you know
[12:10] your pastor i knew he wouldn't
[12:13] well let me just use myself
[12:17] i can cause my church to get mad at
[12:19] somebody
[12:21] by the way i preach and then i could be
[12:25] the person that's wrong
[12:30] i can say i can talk to my church
[12:33] you know these brothers saying certain
[12:34] certain things about me and blah blah
[12:36] blah and the congregation go
[12:43] talk about my pastor make no sense
[12:46] but you really don't know what they said
[12:47] and you're already getting mad
[12:51] what they could be saying about me could
[12:52] be true but i'm projecting it to the
[12:54] congregation
[12:56] what they saying about me but it could
[12:58] be true what they're saying about me
[13:02] so when somebody tell me
[13:04] this one said this about me and this
[13:07] this this i say what did they say
[13:11] i don't be like whoa about you see when
[13:14] you get real close to friends and
[13:15] buddies and friendship you automatically
[13:18] get mad at whoever mad at your friend
[13:20] but that's not christianity
[13:23] i want to know
[13:25] what the facts are what is the truth
[13:28] because sometimes you know say well
[13:29] brother what are they saying about you
[13:31] i said tell me what they said about
[13:33] y'all i might not like you then just
[13:34] tell me what did they say
[13:38] and then everybody said well they said
[13:40] they said this this this did you do it
[13:43] well yeah i swear i feel the same way
[13:45] about you that they feel about you
[13:46] because what you did is wrong
[13:50] so i like to know
[13:53] what is it
[13:54] but we like to jump to conclusions on
[13:56] things because the association we have
[13:59] with the person the word of god don't
[14:01] work that way the word of god it fits
[14:04] every situation it is not prejudiced
[14:07] it means exactly what it says
[14:10] that's why when it comes to the word of
[14:12] god
[14:14] if you love god you're going to love god
[14:16] if he says something bad about you
[14:18] you're still going to love him a lot of
[14:20] people love the gospel as long as
[14:22] they're hearing things that they want to
[14:24] hear
[14:25] but when it comes to correction and
[14:27] rebuke that's when people really get
[14:29] offended that's when you really find out
[14:31] where their relationship really is with
[14:32] the lord
[14:34] god is never wrong
[14:36] he's always right
[14:38] can we say praise the lord
[14:40] so the bible is a prophecy the bible is
[14:43] a book of prophecy that's exactly what
[14:45] it is and
[14:49] everything
[14:51] is controlled by prophecy
[14:54] what has already been spoken is being
[14:56] refilled be fulfilled again
[14:58] that's why solomon said there's nothing
[15:00] new under the sun
[15:01] that's why we got all of this word we
[15:03] got the bible we got the message
[15:05] everything we need to know it lies in
[15:07] the bible this is our resources
[15:11] now in deuteronomy chapter 28 verse 1
[15:15] it said it shall come to pass if thou
[15:17] hearken diligently unto the voice of the
[15:18] lord thy god to observe and do all his
[15:21] commandments
[15:22] which i command thee this day that the
[15:24] lord thy god would set thee on high
[15:27] above all the nations of the earth
[15:31] and all these blessings shall come on
[15:32] thee and overtake thee if thou shalt
[15:35] hearken unto the voice of the lord thy
[15:38] god you know when people don't
[15:40] understand the nature of god
[15:42] they miss
[15:44] they just can't misunderstand what god
[15:46] is saying god is not a god just want to
[15:48] say i want to bless you and curse you
[15:51] he just don't throw things out there god
[15:53] has a reason for everything that he says
[15:56] for instance
[15:57] uh you would find even in the book of
[15:59] deuteronomy
[16:01] i can't remember what chapter it is
[16:03] moses i think it's chapter 31 somewhere
[16:06] around now moses told the children of
[16:08] israel all these years god had you out
[16:11] here in the wilderness he said it's to
[16:13] prove you
[16:15] and to try you
[16:16] and to humble you
[16:18] so god allowed all these incidents now
[16:21] you go back and read that scripture he
[16:22] said you remember when the children of
[16:24] israel said they was hungry
[16:26] god knew they was going to be hungry
[16:28] because moses told them he suffered you
[16:32] to be hungry
[16:34] god let them be hungry just to see how
[16:36] they're going to respond and what
[16:38] they're going to do god was doing all of
[16:40] the testing so god let you and me
[16:43] literally go through things so he can
[16:45] see how you're going to respond and how
[16:47] you're going to react to it
[16:49] that's why i don't think it's strange
[16:50] when something happens god is testing
[16:52] you and me because he has to do that
[16:55] can we say amen
[16:57] testing trials is not to break us down
[16:59] it's actually the builders up if you
[17:01] look at it the right way
[17:04] so he said blessed shalt thou be in the
[17:06] city blessed shalt thou be in the field
[17:09] blessed shall i be the fruit of thy body
[17:10] and the fruit of thy ground fruited like
[17:13] cow on the increase of thy kind in the
[17:15] flocks of thy sheep god has given
[17:17] blessings and these blessings rely on
[17:20] keeping my commandments
[17:23] so he let them get hungry and
[17:25] then he fed them bread and so forth and
[17:28] fed the manna god done that for a reason
[17:30] but if you notice
[17:32] the key thing
[17:34] when he gave them the matter
[17:38] then he gave commandments
[17:40] you can only pick so much up for this
[17:42] day
[17:43] and then that's it
[17:45] then he's saying don't leave none for
[17:46] the next day
[17:48] he started giving that's see
[17:50] the manner was the food
[17:53] but his word was the commandments
[17:55] how to go get it
[17:57] when to go get it how much to go get it
[18:00] that's what the test was what's so much
[18:02] the food it was his word
[18:04] that's why the scripture said god was
[18:07] trying to show that man shall not live
[18:09] by bread
[18:10] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[18:13] out of the mouth of god
[18:15] see all of that was a test and it's the
[18:17] exact same thing today today god want to
[18:20] see
[18:22] god ain't worrying about the test
[18:25] god is a god is not afraid to put his
[18:28] saints in prison
[18:31] god got no problem put you in jail
[18:32] letting you go to jail he ain't got no
[18:34] problem with that he's well known for
[18:36] putting believers in some strange places
[18:39] because god is not worried about that
[18:41] situation he have that confidence in
[18:43] that believer they're going to keep my
[18:45] word
[18:47] can we say praise the lord he allowed
[18:49] paul
[18:50] i mean carnal minds
[18:52] say what kind of god is this put people
[18:55] in jail let them go to jail be such a
[18:57] loving god why are you going to let you
[18:58] go to jail
[18:59] why are you going to let you get sawed
[19:01] asunder if he's such a loving god what
[19:03] kind of god is this because god is not
[19:05] afraid to put his believers through
[19:07] trials
[19:08] he could have stopped him from going in
[19:10] the fiery furnace but he didn't
[19:12] he let him walk right in it
[19:14] but he was actually waiting in there for
[19:16] him
[19:16] so god is not afraid to let you go
[19:19] through trial really it's showing his
[19:21] confidence that he has in you
[19:26] job had no idea
[19:29] that god and the devil
[19:31] was talking to each other
[19:33] but joe was going through this pain
[19:37] but god was letting the devil know do
[19:40] whatever you want this is a good one
[19:42] here
[19:43] and joe didn't have a clue
[19:46] because if joe would have had a clue
[19:48] process
[19:49] lord
[19:51] why in the world you gonna let me go
[19:53] through this and you told the devil i
[19:55] was perfect
[19:59] god told the devil job is perfect
[20:02] then all right give me some trials
[20:05] and we say i want to be perfect i want
[20:07] to be mature
[20:09] trials come with that
[20:13] praise the lord
[20:16] let's jump down to verse 52.
[20:20] i'm cause if you have you have to read
[20:22] that whole chapter
[20:24] to catch what's going on but i want to
[20:27] jump to verse 52 because verse 52
[20:30] we get to the place when god tell them
[20:33] when you don't keep my word
[20:36] this is what i'm gonna let the enemy do
[20:37] to you
[20:39] he gonna let them know if you don't keep
[20:40] my word the enemy is gonna be able to do
[20:43] this to you
[20:47] notice he says
[20:49] now this is what i want you to catch
[20:51] he said he shall be seized thee
[20:56] excuse me
[20:57] in all thy gates
[21:00] into the high high and fence wall come
[21:04] down
[21:05] wherein thou trusted now moses is
[21:08] talking to them
[21:09] but where are the fences
[21:11] where are the gates
[21:15] see the temple wasn't even built yet
[21:19] but god let them know
[21:20] this is going to come to pass
[21:22] this is what's going to happen to you if
[21:25] you don't keep my word see this is a
[21:27] prophecy
[21:28] now they probably like
[21:30] what are you talking about most fences
[21:32] and walls and gates what are you talking
[21:34] about you see in the bible
[21:36] when they build a city the first thing
[21:39] they build is the walls
[21:42] not the city
[21:43] they build the walls because the wall
[21:45] represents the protection
[21:47] that goes around it so that the enemy
[21:49] can't get in
[21:52] see
[21:52] so he's this is a prophecy
[21:55] and he says
[21:58] he shall besiege thee and all thy gates
[22:00] into the high and fenced walls come down
[22:05] worrying thou trusters he's saying worry
[22:08] and i trusted because long as they know
[22:10] them fences is out there and the enemy
[22:12] is out there they trusting in the wall
[22:13] that's all he ain't going to get over
[22:14] that wall
[22:16] we were in the bottom because he got to
[22:17] get over the wall but you remember never
[22:19] connecting them thought the exact same
[22:21] thing
[22:22] they was trusting in their walls the
[22:23] prophet god talked about but the enemy
[22:26] came up under the wall and that's how he
[22:27] got him
[22:28] so moses said you trusting in your walls
[22:30] and all this stuff is just like america
[22:33] what's she saying she trusted in the
[22:35] armed forces and all of these things
[22:37] she's relaxing oh you let ukraine try to
[22:39] come near us we now
[22:42] all of this is prophecy
[22:44] because what's going to happen to
[22:45] america is going to happen just like in
[22:47] the book of jeremiah jeremiah told them
[22:50] told the children of israel when the
[22:52] king of babylon come to you he's done
[22:54] him try to fight him is cause your
[22:56] weapons won't work
[22:59] it ain't gonna work even though you got
[23:00] good weapons they won't work because
[23:02] prophecy make them not work
[23:05] so god controls every thing
[23:11] so he let them know
[23:13] he shall besiege thee and all thy gates
[23:16] throughout all thy land with the lord
[23:18] thy god
[23:19] giveth thee now he's showing what the
[23:23] enemy is going to do notice all thy
[23:25] gates that means he's going to stand in
[23:27] front of every one of them so they can't
[23:29] get out and nothing can come in
[23:32] that's the tactic of the enemy but now
[23:34] what he's visiting to do now
[23:37] is start talking about the pressures
[23:39] because of you in the besiege what
[23:42] pressure is going to make you do
[23:44] now notice right here
[23:46] it's
[23:48] now i want y'all to think about this
[23:50] moses talking to people i know they
[23:52] think he's crazy because it didn't
[23:54] happen yet
[23:57] but it did happen
[23:58] later on
[24:00] look what he gonna say the pressure
[24:02] going to make you do
[24:06] verse 53
[24:08] thou shalt eat the fruit
[24:10] of thy own body
[24:12] the flesh of thy sons and thy daughters
[24:15] with the lord that god hath given thee
[24:17] in the siege
[24:19] and in this straightness worth thy enemy
[24:22] shall be stretched deep now i'm pretty
[24:24] sure they said moses you
[24:27] you really don't lost it
[24:28] we're gonna eat our own children
[24:31] come on moses
[24:33] this is prophecy he said but this when
[24:36] the enemy sees you this is what you're
[24:38] going to end up doing you see
[24:40] we understand what happened even when
[24:42] titus
[24:43] we understand through history they did
[24:45] eat one another's children but these
[24:48] things happen in the bible times too
[24:50] so but that is not even humanly right
[24:54] where somebody would eat their own child
[24:57] but it happened because in that siege
[25:00] that pressure got so bad
[25:02] see what happened when the enemy was out
[25:05] there as long as they had some resources
[25:07] that's all we all good everything is
[25:09] fine but they kept eating and they kept
[25:11] eating and they kept eating you remember
[25:13] it just happened in the book of kings
[25:15] they got the they got to eating their
[25:16] horses and they started doing everything
[25:18] when the syrians had surrounded them
[25:20] exact same thing that happened
[25:23] but then when all of the resources
[25:25] started going out
[25:26] they were starving so bad
[25:28] and depression was so bad
[25:32] they looked at junior
[25:38] could you imagine the pressure on the
[25:40] parents
[25:42] husband and wife talking
[25:45] we starving
[25:47] well we got these kids here
[25:49] no no
[25:51] time go by
[25:53] we starving
[25:54] then all of a sudden
[25:57] which one of these children caused the
[25:59] most problem
[26:04] we'll take that one first
[26:10] now naturally
[26:12] we won't do that
[26:14] but pressure can be so bad spiritually
[26:17] you'll eat your children
[26:22] you start doing it spiritually
[26:25] eating one another
[26:27] causing pressure
[26:29] all right
[26:31] let me just keep going
[26:34] i want you to watch how i make people
[26:36] change
[26:40] listen to verse 56
[26:43] the tender
[26:45] and the delicate woman among you
[26:49] which would not adventure
[26:51] to set the soul of her foot upon the
[26:54] ground for delicateness
[26:56] and tenderness
[26:58] her eye shall be evil towards her
[27:01] husband
[27:02] what this is talking about a humble
[27:05] sister
[27:07] quiet
[27:09] by nature
[27:10] y'all met people like that
[27:13] oh they're just so sweet and quiet just
[27:15] to be in their presence
[27:18] but the bible telling us that delicate
[27:21] tender sister
[27:23] pressure will make her change too
[27:30] sometimes as a pastor
[27:32] somebody might be like well you know
[27:33] that sister done such and such
[27:35] can you be like
[27:39] are we talking about the same sister
[27:42] yeah
[27:44] and yo she's so
[27:46] nice i i have to disagree i don't see
[27:49] that
[27:50] i don't see no but pressure
[27:54] pressure
[27:56] huh
[27:57] sometimes
[27:59] people be
[28:00] see when you don't act right around your
[28:02] children
[28:03] but you can only act right around adults
[28:05] and church people
[28:07] when somebody's giving you a compliment
[28:09] but your children really know how you
[28:10] live
[28:12] and it was like oh that precious brother
[28:13] he's just such a man of god and gender
[28:15] and kind and the family be like
[28:20] we looking at two different people
[28:26] it's that this sister this tender sister
[28:29] would make her look even at her own
[28:31] husband
[28:32] pressure
[28:33] make a change
[28:36] because the devil doesn't gotta seek
[28:38] somewhere in her life
[28:40] and he won't move
[28:42] now he's making her great character
[28:47] i know this ain't a popular sermon this
[28:49] morning i know you'd rather hear the
[28:50] seals or you'd rather hear the trumpets
[28:53] and all of these good things which is
[28:55] wonderful but you ain't got character
[28:57] that don't mean nothing
[29:01] it don't
[29:04] what that song you just saying
[29:07] religion doesn't work anymore
[29:10] but revelation does and character
[29:14] praise the lord
[29:20] amen
[29:23] notice
[29:26] it said her eye shall be evil towards
[29:29] the husband
[29:30] of her bosom
[29:32] towards her son
[29:33] towards her daughter
[29:35] now pressure
[29:37] in the sea
[29:38] caused individuals to attack their own
[29:40] family
[29:42] from within
[29:47] listen
[29:48] verse 57
[29:49] toward her young one that cometh out
[29:52] from between her feet to other children
[29:55] which she shall bear
[29:57] for she shall eat them
[29:59] for want of things secretly
[30:03] in the siege
[30:04] and straightness wherein thy enemy shall
[30:07] distress thee and thy gates that's what
[30:10] when the devil to put a besiege around
[30:12] you
[30:13] he'll cause you to go against people
[30:16] speak think evil think bad and it all
[30:19] because the results of pressure
[30:22] that's why you have to take that time
[30:24] say wait a minute see i'm the type of
[30:26] person whenever i'm going through
[30:27] something i stay away from people
[30:30] because i don't want to offend nobody
[30:33] i go deal with me
[30:35] i have to deal with me
[30:38] my family we've been taught very well
[30:40] when i come home
[30:42] if something don't went wrong
[30:44] pressure when i walk in the door my wife
[30:46] can just look
[30:48] when she'll know she was just saying
[30:50] nothing and i just
[30:54] go through
[30:55] chain clothes turn around walk right
[30:57] back outside
[30:59] and i can walk around my yard and think
[31:02] just think man
[31:04] don't even say nothing
[31:06] go out there
[31:08] then come back then when i get the
[31:09] problem solved i go back in the house
[31:12] hey hey how you doing
[31:16] facebook because i don't dealt with me
[31:23] but today
[31:26] you're all right
[31:29] excuse me
[31:30] sir
[31:33] but that breaker cut
[31:36] that's what happens
[31:38] then start devouring
[31:42] it's something i say all the time
[31:45] in this message and it's come to family
[31:47] life and a lot of things we're all a
[31:48] bunch of historians
[31:52] we can always say you remember you did
[31:53] that you remember you said that you
[31:54] remember that you remember you remember
[31:56] you've been bringing up history
[31:58] that goes to show you really didn't
[31:59] forgive
[32:02] because when you really forgive
[32:03] something you're not going to bring it
[32:04] back up
[32:06] but that besiege
[32:08] that pressure
[32:10] can cause all of that
[32:18] he said thou would not observe to do all
[32:20] the words of the law that are written in
[32:21] this book that thou mayest fear the
[32:23] glorious
[32:25] and fearful name the lord thy god he
[32:28] just let him know
[32:29] when the enemy comes around you besiege
[32:31] you this is what you're going to do this
[32:33] is what's going to happen you see we're
[32:36] in satan's eden
[32:39] surrounded by a wall of laodicea
[32:43] and we're living in the midst of it
[32:46] but we got resources
[32:49] to feed from to eat from to keep us
[32:52] strong to be able to fight
[32:56] because the enemy want to keep you and
[32:58] get you to starve because once you
[33:00] starve and you ain't if you ain't
[33:01] studying fasting laying in this word of
[33:04] god i'm here to tell you you're going to
[33:06] be sticky
[33:08] you're going to be a fault finder you're
[33:10] going to be a blamer
[33:11] and you'll never look at yourself
[33:14] and the problem literally sometimes it's
[33:16] just you
[33:18] and me
[33:20] because when you look in the word of god
[33:22] and when you study the word of god god's
[33:24] going to show you up
[33:26] he'll show you your bad about you he'll
[33:27] show you the good about you
[33:29] that's the god that we have
[33:33] can we say amen
[33:36] turn me to first samuel chapter 23
[33:45] ain't gonna be wrong brother paul
[34:01] this uh
[34:07] this pressure it just
[34:10] even when you could do good
[34:13] to someone
[34:14] pressure can cause them to even go
[34:16] against you
[34:18] yet you even done good
[34:23] if i can remember the scripture i want
[34:24] to show you something in the morning but
[34:26] i'll i'll keep thinking about it as we
[34:27] go
[34:28] but i want to go to in deuteronomy i
[34:31] mean first samuel 23 verse 1. watch this
[34:33] right here
[34:35] this is the time
[34:36] saul is chasing david trying to kill
[34:39] david and all so forth
[34:41] he said then they told david saying
[34:43] behold
[34:45] the philistines fight against cali
[34:48] and they rob the threshing floors saul
[34:50] will come on the scene
[34:52] later
[34:53] therefore david inquired of the lord
[34:55] saying shall i go and smite these
[34:57] philistines
[34:58] and the lord said unto david go and
[35:00] smite the philistines and save collide
[35:03] in other words
[35:05] it's not even david fight
[35:07] but he going down there and helped them
[35:08] in cali
[35:10] he asked him lord shall i go help him
[35:11] he's go go help him save him save him
[35:13] from the philistines
[35:15] and david man said unto him behold we'd
[35:17] be afraid here in judah
[35:19] how much more than if we come to calais
[35:23] against the armies of the philistines
[35:25] and david inquired the lord yet again
[35:27] and the lord answering to him said arise
[35:29] go down to kalau
[35:31] for i will deliver the philistines in
[35:33] thy hands
[35:35] that same god speaks today
[35:37] but we can just go to him as we would
[35:38] just listen say lord what do you want me
[35:41] to do
[35:42] i believe if we be patient enough he'll
[35:43] speak in here directly and tell you
[35:45] exactly what to do
[35:52] verse 5.
[35:53] david said
[35:55] so david and his men went to collab
[35:58] and fought with the philistine and
[36:00] brought away their cattle smoked them
[36:02] with the slaughter so david saved the
[36:05] inhabitants of kilau
[36:08] when it came to pass when a.b atha the
[36:10] son of emily fled to david to collab
[36:13] that he came down with an epar in his
[36:15] hand
[36:17] and it was told saul that david was come
[36:19] to callow
[36:21] and saul said god had delivered him in
[36:23] my hand
[36:24] for he is shut in by entering into a
[36:27] town
[36:28] that has gates and bars see saul knew
[36:31] once david is in there
[36:33] he can't come out it got bars around and
[36:36] now i got him
[36:37] but look how a religious evil spirit
[36:40] can talk about saying god did it saul
[36:43] got an evil spirit on him now he's
[36:44] saying the lord don't gave me david
[36:48] see when you're dealing with religious
[36:49] demons
[36:50] religious spirit they talk and say god
[36:53] said god said but yet they're just as
[36:54] wrong as they can be
[36:56] that's the deceitfulness of this age
[37:01] and he says here
[37:05] verse 9.
[37:09] no i'm sorry
[37:10] and salt verse 8 and saul called all the
[37:12] people together to war to go down to
[37:14] callow to besiege david
[37:18] and his men see they're going to be
[37:19] sieged again
[37:21] and david knew that saul secretly
[37:24] practiced mischief against him
[37:27] he said to abraham to the priest praying
[37:29] heather to the ephod
[37:32] then said david oh lord god of israel i
[37:35] like david's attitude
[37:39] he consulted god first what to do
[37:42] he shouldn't
[37:44] now if he would have been in that
[37:45] relationship with the lord like he
[37:46] should have done he would have done it
[37:47] with bathsheba
[37:49] see he didn't seek the lord because they
[37:50] were his own personal lusts
[37:52] something he wanted to do
[37:54] so a lot of times people say they don't
[37:56] seek god when they got something they
[37:58] already going to do it anyway they ain't
[37:59] going to seek the lord
[38:01] but we should seek him in all things
[38:05] amen
[38:08] i can feel my preacher coming on now
[38:15] notice what he says here
[38:19] verse 10
[38:21] then said david oh lord god is your thy
[38:23] servant has certainly heard that saul
[38:25] seeketh to come to kalau
[38:27] to destroy the city for my sake
[38:31] he said will the man of color deliver me
[38:34] up
[38:35] in his hand
[38:37] will saul come down
[38:39] as thy servant hath heard
[38:42] oh lord god of israel i beseech thee
[38:44] tell thy servant and the lord said he
[38:47] will come down
[38:50] then david said david will the man the
[38:53] collage deliver me up
[38:56] and my man into the hand of saul and the
[38:58] lord said they will
[39:01] deliver thee up why
[39:03] david don't save them
[39:05] but now they hear saul is coming the
[39:08] pressure going to get on them they say
[39:10] david i'm sorry buddy you sure did help
[39:12] us out but there he is all he hiding
[39:14] right there
[39:16] pressure makes you turn on the people
[39:18] that even try to help you
[39:23] and we don't understand it's a time
[39:25] i just
[39:27] why what
[39:29] pressure don't hit them
[39:31] to them act that way
[39:34] can we say praise the lord
[39:41] i want to go back to ecclesiastes now
[39:46] chapter nine
[39:52] a lot of things happening now
[39:55] around the message
[39:57] it's a result of pressure
[40:01] people responding
[40:04] wrong way because of pressure
[40:07] especially when somebody feel like they
[40:10] when you know kind of
[40:12] touch their pride
[40:15] they really want to fight back and say
[40:17] things
[40:18] it shouldn't be that way
[40:20] can we say praise the lord
[40:24] that's why even even in family life you
[40:26] know a lot of times people tell me they
[40:28] say brother you just preach on family
[40:29] stuff too much you know i said what was
[40:31] wrong with that
[40:35] we're the family of
[40:36] god what's wrong with that
[40:39] because if you got towards homes you're
[40:40] going to have a tour of church
[40:42] because the strengths of the family is
[40:44] what make the church
[40:47] that's why you need some some sign you
[40:48] got some family struggling but they can
[40:51] see a family that's strong and really
[40:52] holding the line that'll influence them
[40:55] that's a good that that brings a good
[40:57] influence encouraging somebody else
[41:00] but if we're all tore up
[41:03] that's a pretty bad situation to be in
[41:07] can you say man let it be a situation
[41:09] like two drowning man
[41:11] asking each other for help
[41:15] and both of them drowning
[41:17] help me
[41:19] it won't work like that somebody got to
[41:20] stay above these things friends
[41:23] and i believe we as the bride of jesus
[41:24] christ don't get caught up into what's
[41:26] going on we get caught up in the words
[41:27] and now let me look differently let me
[41:30] think differently let me not get caught
[41:31] up into
[41:32] this because it's very easy to do
[41:36] i don't get caught up into the minister
[41:38] associations of the message today
[41:42] i don't get caught up with a certain
[41:43] group i like being independent i like
[41:46] being who i am i can go preach wherever
[41:48] i want to go preach or wherever i feel
[41:49] led by god grace that's when i if he
[41:52] tell me go preach for three people i can
[41:53] still go pray you know you got some
[41:55] preacher they don't really want to
[41:56] preach unless it's a special meeting
[42:00] if it ain't a special meeting you call
[42:02] and say hey brother i wonder what you
[42:04] doing this weekend i mean i can get you
[42:06] come by pre-trial oh is it a special
[42:07] meeting
[42:10] yeah every church service is a special
[42:12] meeting
[42:17] then let me know it's something in your
[42:19] ministry you need some dying you need
[42:21] god to kill you a little bit more
[42:26] that's right
[42:30] just think
[42:33] in the besiege
[42:35] they start eating one another
[42:38] and pressure causes people to do that
[42:40] rip each other down cuddy people just
[42:43] say all kind of bad things
[42:45] all because of pressure
[42:47] i was talking about paul
[42:49] you know it's people we're talking about
[42:51] the holy ghost
[42:52] there are some things that brother
[42:54] burnham said about the holy ghost don't
[42:55] do
[42:56] and if you really really want to get so
[42:58] so so technical
[43:00] what you say who got it right
[43:03] whoa whoa
[43:04] he started talking about one place and
[43:06] the message was the holy ghost and you
[43:08] hear these other people saying things
[43:10] about you and stuff like that he start
[43:12] talking about the holy ghost yeah you
[43:13] ain't gonna revile back
[43:15] you ain't gonna want to go go back at
[43:17] them
[43:18] but look at me to do that somebody say
[43:19] something about it oh i'm gonna say
[43:21] something get them back
[43:22] now if i want to take the quote say well
[43:24] according what prophets there you ain't
[43:25] got the holy ghost
[43:27] but i don't do that because i know we
[43:29] die daily
[43:30] we die as we grow
[43:36] that's correct
[43:39] but when you look at things a certain
[43:40] way you want to put somebody in your
[43:42] little circle in your little ball and
[43:43] they need to act the way you want them
[43:45] to act it don't work like that i want to
[43:47] i want to be just the way god wants me
[43:49] to be
[43:52] but
[43:53] the enemy
[43:55] when he's around them
[43:57] when he get a sense they don't run out
[43:58] of resources
[44:01] then they start knocking the gates down
[44:04] the man that can try to hold the gates
[44:06] but no strength the enemy just pushed
[44:08] the gate and they just fall back with it
[44:10] and the enemy just walks in and triumphs
[44:13] because nobody has no strength to fight
[44:15] because all of the resources
[44:18] are gone
[44:21] but it's that city
[44:23] when the enemy is out there if that city
[44:25] we had a secret resources and inside
[44:28] where they never went out
[44:30] the enemy could be out there thinking
[44:34] it's time to go get them now but didn't
[44:35] know it was a secret supplier in there
[44:38] when that enemy hit that gate and when
[44:39] he bounced in there guess what
[44:41] strong warriors are right there waiting
[44:44] on them and wear them out and be like
[44:46] retreat i thought they were starving i
[44:48] thought they were dead man they still
[44:50] strong
[44:51] they almost got something in there it's
[44:53] a hidden resource
[44:55] i'm here to tell you that's what the
[44:56] bride has
[44:58] she has a resource
[45:00] the word of god that never runs out and
[45:04] i want to show you where it comes from
[45:07] in ecclesiastes 9
[45:11] this wisdom
[45:12] chapter 9 verse 13 what we read this
[45:15] wisdom have i seen under the sun and it
[45:18] seemed great unto me
[45:20] there was a little city
[45:23] few men within it
[45:24] and there came a great king against it
[45:27] and we seized it and built great bull
[45:30] works against it what this is talking
[45:32] about when the enemy besieged the city
[45:36] then he start building bull walks you
[45:38] know if you look at weaponry in the
[45:40] bible times they have big old weapons
[45:42] that throw stones
[45:44] that are not gates down they had big old
[45:47] logs where they could bump the gates so
[45:49] the enemy should be sitting out there
[45:50] building this billionaire getting all
[45:52] his weapons his battlements set up and
[45:55] they can look over the fence
[45:57] what are they doing
[45:58] no
[46:00] that this time you really didn't want
[46:01] the watchman telling you the truth
[46:04] to watch me say
[46:06] they building some big old great thing
[46:08] it
[46:09] from the looks of it guys it throw rocks
[46:12] they'd be like
[46:13] oh
[46:14] pulling the confidence down
[46:17] then they said watch me one of the night
[46:18] he gets up there
[46:21] it's some kind of spiky thing they got
[46:22] and it looked like it could really rip
[46:24] through a gate that's what i'm seeing
[46:26] guys
[46:26] oh but the watchman's got to report the
[46:29] truth
[46:31] got to report the truth
[46:34] that's what they do he sets around the
[46:36] city built great bull works against it
[46:40] getting all his weapons set up because
[46:42] he said this city is done i'm going to
[46:43] take over the inhabitants the city and
[46:46] all
[46:47] but what this this case
[46:50] while they was doing that
[46:52] it said verse 15.
[46:55] now that was found in it in the poor
[46:57] wise man
[46:59] he by his wisdom delivered the city
[47:02] yet no man remembered that same poor man
[47:05] whoever this wise man was
[47:09] how he delivered the city
[47:12] he didn't do it by weapons
[47:14] so in other words it was some words he
[47:16] was able to tell them to help them
[47:19] overcome what the enemy was trying to do
[47:23] this man here
[47:25] what i'm reading to you actually is this
[47:28] entire gospel
[47:30] let's look at it again
[47:33] verse 14
[47:34] it said there was a little city
[47:37] i would like to put in there there was a
[47:38] little bride
[47:41] and they sent a few man within it fear
[47:44] not little flock a few in the bride
[47:46] and there came a great king
[47:49] and against it in this satan's eden
[47:52] and received it with facebook
[47:55] besieged it with the internet besieged
[47:58] it with tick tock but besieged it with
[48:00] instagram
[48:03] because that's what the best results in
[48:05] all of these things what the devil would
[48:08] have built around all of us
[48:10] to bring us into a besiege
[48:13] are you with me
[48:14] but notice
[48:16] verse 15 that was founded in a poor
[48:19] wise man
[48:21] from the hills of kentucky
[48:25] poor
[48:26] wise man
[48:27] weighing boring in the backside of
[48:29] kentucky in the log cabin
[48:32] wise but where did his wisdom come from
[48:35] listen to the scripture by his wisdom
[48:37] delivered the bride
[48:41] amen
[48:42] not his wisdom but the wisdom god gave
[48:45] him to deliver the bride god sent this
[48:49] message this is our resources regardless
[48:52] how much the devil don't created things
[48:54] or cause things if you keep feasting
[48:56] upon this word of god that besiege is
[48:58] not gonna make you devour somebody going
[49:01] to make you devour the enemy not your
[49:03] brother not your sister
[49:04] [Applause]
[49:06] but listen to what he says he said but
[49:09] no man
[49:10] remember
[49:11] that poor man's message anymore
[49:16] the very message god sent to deliver the
[49:19] bride now you got people want to go
[49:21] against the message but god sent it for
[49:23] deliverance
[49:24] they don't want to consult the message
[49:26] no more don't want nobody's talking
[49:27] about prophet no more no nobody want to
[49:30] say anything oh we don't we just need
[49:31] the bible now we don't need the message
[49:33] no more that's a lie we need both of
[49:35] them we need it all
[49:37] this message comes so god bride can
[49:40] become out of this besiege
[49:42] not let it influence you but you
[49:44] overcome it
[49:48] this is the pattern of today
[49:52] and it eat the fat
[49:55] we run out of resources
[49:57] we got all resources that's what the
[49:59] prophet god told the prophet start the
[50:01] food
[50:04] we got everything we need laying here
[50:06] but you got to eat it
[50:09] just so you can maintain strength
[50:12] for every war every battle that you
[50:14] faced
[50:19] verse 16
[50:20] then said our wisdom is better than
[50:22] strength nevertheless
[50:26] the poor man's message
[50:29] is despised
[50:33] the message to many
[50:35] is despised
[50:38] too many they despised this message
[50:41] but yet at the time when they were
[50:43] believing it
[50:44] it was causing them to overcome
[50:47] but now because of personal things in
[50:49] their life they want to do and the word
[50:51] is contrary so now they got to despise
[50:53] the message to justify their own
[50:55] personal desire
[51:00] and his words
[51:02] are not heard
[51:05] isn't it a shame
[51:07] they don't got that bad today
[51:10] now i don't have to
[51:12] say brother branham said every time i
[51:14] quote something
[51:15] i have to do that
[51:18] if you study the message you're knowing
[51:19] somebody preaching the message
[51:23] it's bad the categories we get now
[51:27] if you don't say brother branham enough
[51:28] you're not preaching the message
[51:30] that's sad that's really really sad
[51:34] it really is i got no problems somebody
[51:37] saying brother banner said or the
[51:38] prophet said or they don't even say it
[51:40] at all they just keep they preach the
[51:42] real real word they don't bother me long
[51:44] as they're preaching the revealed word
[51:46] i'm good
[51:49] but then i don't want nobody to tell me
[51:50] i can't say his name i can't say the
[51:52] prophet that's not going to happen if i
[51:54] feel led to say it i'm going to say it
[51:56] if i feel it not to say it i'm not going
[51:57] to say it
[51:59] what does that matter long as the word
[52:01] is being preached
[52:03] the revelation that god hath gave him in
[52:05] this hour
[52:09] but all of these now
[52:11] because of pressure
[52:13] things been set in categories now who's
[52:15] really preaching the message and who's
[52:17] not really preaching the message
[52:19] and that is wrong
[52:24] like well i'm preaching now i'm not
[52:26] jumping
[52:27] i'm not screaming i'm not running
[52:30] but sometimes at my church you might
[52:32] think somebody don't pull gas on me lit
[52:34] me on fire you'll be screaming and
[52:35] kicking
[52:37] sometimes i preach just like that
[52:39] sometimes i don't i preach just like
[52:41] this then you get the other light
[52:44] he ain't lively today i'm just as live
[52:46] as i ever been
[52:50] you go by whatever god wants to do
[52:53] whatever god wants to say and you fall
[52:56] under that anointing
[52:58] right now i don't feel like jumping and
[53:00] kicking
[53:01] if i try to do it it won't work
[53:06] skipping y'all gonna be like
[53:09] is he mad
[53:11] cause he's not fitting
[53:13] the anointing what god want me to
[53:14] present this morning
[53:21] you have to be led by the spirit what to
[53:23] say when to say god
[53:26] how do you want me what you want me to
[53:27] do lord
[53:30] but now people want to predict the way a
[53:32] sermon or service should be
[53:34] no it shouldn't be like that friend it's
[53:36] whatever he wants to do
[53:41] i respect every ministry
[53:44] i don't categorize nobody
[53:46] i just respect every god call ministry
[53:50] because i want to because i know that
[53:52] it's a gift of god that is called to
[53:54] feed my soul
[53:58] i was sitting in the minister's meeting
[54:03] some people are saying sharp now you
[54:04] know oh that's good oh yeah
[54:07] i think one brother
[54:09] said one simple thing
[54:11] like a bomb explode
[54:13] he just raised his hand said a few
[54:15] things it was good
[54:17] whoa
[54:19] he didn't even raise his voice
[54:24] so you got to get caught up in not our
[54:25] own spirit
[54:28] get caught up in the holy spirit
[54:33] i never forget many times when i didn't
[54:35] have the message on tape
[54:37] just reading books
[54:40] sometimes you can read a book
[54:42] you start just coming out of your cloak
[54:49] look at what he's saying then when you
[54:52] finally get the tape would have been
[54:54] ain't even screaming
[54:56] and you like
[54:58] whoa
[55:00] whoa
[55:05] so you don't assume he was jumping and
[55:07] kicking but he
[55:10] is all right
[55:12] what is the anointing
[55:14] the anointing is to know what to say
[55:16] and when to say it
[55:20] that's a quote
[55:23] praise the lord brother brandon said the
[55:25] greatest anointing
[55:26] that was on any human being
[55:29] it was the lord jesus christ
[55:32] he said when he took the book he found a
[55:34] place written of him he said then when
[55:37] he read it
[55:38] he sat down
[55:41] he said that was the greatest anointing
[55:44] of any human being
[55:47] so the anointing is it's not something
[55:49] outwardly
[55:51] it's something that's lined up with the
[55:53] authority of god and it falls right in
[55:55] the channel the way god said because you
[55:58] know you can say one word it could mean
[56:01] more than saying a thousand words you
[56:04] can just say one
[56:07] so the pressures today brothers and
[56:09] sisters
[56:10] let us just think about our ways
[56:13] do like david as i sat and i thought
[56:15] upon my ways
[56:17] then he said i turned my feet into thy
[56:19] testimonies
[56:20] could i guarantee you
[56:22] when you yourself is under a lot of
[56:24] pressure
[56:26] whoever you around
[56:27] if you are careful you'll influence them
[56:29] and your pressure will fall on them
[56:32] and they'll start taking your thoughts
[56:35] and i always take that back to saul
[56:38] when saul was chasing david
[56:40] the army of god was chasing david and
[56:44] they didn't know why they was chasing
[56:45] david
[56:47] because they had fell upon the saw
[56:49] spirit
[56:50] trying to kill david
[56:53] but then the bible said when saul died
[56:56] when saul died the very one that was
[56:58] trying to chase david down now they come
[57:00] back to david
[57:02] after saul died
[57:04] and then they told david you were the
[57:06] one
[57:07] that led us in and out
[57:09] in the beginning
[57:11] then the same man that was trying to
[57:13] kill him now they telling david that why
[57:15] could they tell david that now
[57:17] because the anointing the influence that
[57:19] it was only was now broken
[57:22] now they can see david for who he was
[57:25] to
[57:26] go study the message one man's influence
[57:28] into another
[57:30] them things are true the prophet bring
[57:32] things out falling upon the different
[57:34] people's influences i want to be
[57:36] influenced by the holy spirit
[57:39] that's what i want to be influenced by
[57:41] and the beautiful thing about that story
[57:44] when there was undersaw
[57:48] fighting with him fighting for him all
[57:50] of those damn things you got to go all
[57:53] the way back to uh joshua
[57:56] each one of those tribes had gotten
[57:58] their inheritance
[57:59] they had gotten their position they had
[58:01] gotten their place in the land
[58:03] each one of them established
[58:05] but when they asked for a king fell upon
[58:08] the saul's anointing
[58:10] that's what messed them up
[58:13] that's what messed them up
[58:14] because all of that fighting they was
[58:16] doing was not for the lord they were
[58:18] doing it for saul
[58:20] because all used them and then david
[58:23] anointed to be the king
[58:27] one thing when god anoints
[58:30] something or have a position for you
[58:32] something for you to do in your life
[58:34] you don't have to prove it you don't
[58:36] have to fight for a position
[58:39] god will make sure you get it
[58:42] david knew the throne belonged to him
[58:45] but he never fought for it
[58:48] even when his sons wanted
[58:51] he didn't fight for it
[58:53] because he knew
[58:54] if god said it i supposed to be the king
[58:57] he said it through that prophet if god
[58:59] said god will bring that to pass
[59:02] and look what david went through one
[59:04] thing about david
[59:05] yes he was knowing it to be the king
[59:09] but he wasn't knowing it to sit on the
[59:10] throne
[59:12] no i mean he didn't he was anointed to
[59:14] be the king
[59:15] but he didn't had a character to sit on
[59:17] the throne
[59:18] that's why he went through all that with
[59:20] saul and everything prepare him
[59:24] for the throne
[59:25] that's why when god got something
[59:27] ordained for your life
[59:28] he gonna take you through all sorts of
[59:30] things in life to prepare you for it
[59:33] instead of just putting you there he's
[59:35] going to prepare you for it and when he
[59:37] when he takes you through them things
[59:39] and then you're ready he said this is my
[59:41] son
[59:42] this is my daughter
[59:44] now the character fits or the
[59:46] predestinated calling that i have for
[59:48] that's how god do things
[59:51] and what's so beautiful
[59:55] they would saw trying to kill david
[59:59] but when saul died david took those same
[1:00:02] men
[1:00:03] took their gifts
[1:00:05] the bible said all of them came to david
[1:00:09] and the bible said they came to make
[1:00:10] david
[1:00:12] king
[1:00:13] when saul died all those gifts came
[1:00:15] together to make david king see the
[1:00:18] administration had to change see that's
[1:00:20] what this message is all about
[1:00:23] to take us from under a denominational
[1:00:25] influence
[1:00:28] see what david did
[1:00:30] when they came back under david it put
[1:00:32] all the gifts in the right place and
[1:00:34] they fought to make david king that's
[1:00:36] what the message came from
[1:00:38] because in the denominations in the
[1:00:40] pentecostal them was true gifts of god
[1:00:43] but they was killing the cause of christ
[1:00:46] bringing a reproach to the gospel
[1:00:49] so when god put us up under this
[1:00:50] administration of malachi 4
[1:00:53] same gifts but it took them
[1:00:55] to give god the glory
[1:00:58] that's why any minister i don't care who
[1:01:00] he is
[1:01:01] if he's preaching to lift up himself
[1:01:04] something is wrong
[1:01:07] we should preach christ so that people
[1:01:10] can feel closer be drawn closer to the
[1:01:12] lord and farther away from themselves
[1:01:16] i like what the prophet of god said in
[1:01:17] the message what is the holy ghost he
[1:01:19] said whatever he was telling people how
[1:01:21] to receive the holy ghost hang around
[1:01:23] and stay around and then he said however
[1:01:25] long it takes for you to die
[1:01:28] just stay around so you can get the holy
[1:01:30] ghost
[1:01:31] and today people just don't want to die
[1:01:33] to them saying oh i die daily friend
[1:01:36] i get rebuked sometimes he says how do
[1:01:39] you know god loves you i said oh
[1:01:42] oh i know he loves me is how do you know
[1:01:44] i said man he whips me so bad
[1:01:48] he tears me up when i think wrong he
[1:01:50] convicts me oh man he just really beats
[1:01:54] me pretty good he said
[1:01:56] what i said yeah
[1:01:58] that's how i know he loves me
[1:01:59] what son of mine that i have i don't
[1:02:02] chase it
[1:02:04] and it's love
[1:02:07] god bless you i'm a
[1:02:09] god bless you it's a lot to be saved but
[1:02:10] i think i don't say it enough
[1:02:12] because my heart is burdened
[1:02:14] on so many things that happen today but
[1:02:16] it's a simple solution
[1:02:19] stop
[1:02:21] and check yourself
[1:02:24] check yourself
[1:02:25] pressure upon our young people
[1:02:28] to fit into a crowd
[1:02:30] want to be with this little group
[1:02:31] pressure then drop standard just to fit
[1:02:33] in no this will be siege
[1:02:37] that's a besieged can we say amen
[1:02:40] and i have to deal with these things
[1:02:42] myself you know my own church
[1:02:44] and uh
[1:02:45] it's just a lot of pressure coming from
[1:02:47] every hand
[1:02:49] i'll tell you you remember when they
[1:02:50] asked the prophet to say do you is tv a
[1:02:53] curse
[1:02:55] he replied back he said i'll agree with
[1:02:57] you
[1:02:58] he said but it's what the person do with
[1:03:00] it he said it could have been a blessing
[1:03:03] so all these things facebook and these
[1:03:05] things can be blessings can be cursed
[1:03:08] it depends who the individual is what
[1:03:11] they're doing with it
[1:03:13] and then you get some preachers they
[1:03:15] pretty much put you in hell if you're on
[1:03:16] facebook
[1:03:21] i don't do that
[1:03:23] but i will challenge the individual
[1:03:26] what are you doing with it
[1:03:28] what are you watching how far are you
[1:03:30] doing with this stuff
[1:03:31] is it pulling you
[1:03:33] let me tell you something friend every
[1:03:35] time you wake up in the morning and you
[1:03:37] reach over the first time you grab is
[1:03:38] your phone
[1:03:40] something wrong
[1:03:46] facebook
[1:03:47] good morning facebook
[1:03:49] then at nighttime
[1:03:51] good night facebook fam
[1:03:55] that facebook become your family your
[1:03:58] church
[1:03:59] your minister
[1:04:03] that's addiction
[1:04:07] sorry
[1:04:08] oh yeah
[1:04:09] it's an addiction
[1:04:11] games are addictions
[1:04:14] people get attitudes when they play
[1:04:15] games
[1:04:18] playing your little game on your phone
[1:04:20] somebody say something to you what
[1:04:23] send me that
[1:04:30] that's a spirit man
[1:04:33] that's a spirit
[1:04:35] and they could have something very very
[1:04:36] important to tell you but your game to
[1:04:39] get to another level in your game is
[1:04:41] more important than that
[1:04:44] and the hurt that it brings to children
[1:04:49] wait
[1:04:56] child walk away
[1:04:59] then when they get a little game
[1:05:03] he said hey hey guys let's go outside
[1:05:11] i'm gonna play my game
[1:05:13] put that game down you're gonna spend
[1:05:14] time with the family right now put it
[1:05:16] down
[1:05:17] but you
[1:05:18] get away
[1:05:20] that's parent abuse
[1:05:24] that's what it is
[1:05:26] parent abuse
[1:05:28] oh okay
[1:05:33] praise the
[1:05:34] lord you reap what you sow
[1:05:38] then when your children get big
[1:05:41] move out get married you call them
[1:05:44] hey
[1:05:45] uh mama can i call you back
[1:05:47] uh
[1:05:49] something wrong i just got to call you
[1:05:50] back mama
[1:05:52] okay
[1:05:53] you hang up mama go
[1:05:57] they do to you what you did they did
[1:06:00] then three hours passed they finished
[1:06:02] their game they called you back mom what
[1:06:03] the what you wanted never mind now
[1:06:08] all this stuff consumes our time
[1:06:12] and then we gotta find time to pray
[1:06:15] i don't know what's wrong with people
[1:06:16] when they come to you and say i really
[1:06:18] need you to pray for me and uh
[1:06:20] it's uh it's pretty rough
[1:06:23] they just want you to pray
[1:06:25] but when you start trying to analyze the
[1:06:27] problem
[1:06:28] they get mad
[1:06:30] what's going on well this this what
[1:06:32] happened
[1:06:34] so
[1:06:35] uh you've been studying and
[1:06:37] praying and
[1:06:38] how much that's how much it's not not
[1:06:40] much
[1:06:41] you've been so busy ain't had time to do
[1:06:43] that so well that's your problem
[1:06:45] you ain't even praying for yourself you
[1:06:47] want me to wait for magic one
[1:06:50] to fix your problem now when you're the
[1:06:51] problem
[1:07:01] i got to say this
[1:07:04] you know
[1:07:05] in family life children
[1:07:07] especially when you got two three kids
[1:07:11] when they get older
[1:07:13] one of them might lose fellowship
[1:07:16] with mom and dad and they know it
[1:07:19] they don't make them mad they know they
[1:07:21] can't ask them for nothing they know
[1:07:23] that
[1:07:24] because they know they can't you know
[1:07:25] what they do like
[1:07:27] they'll find a favorite child
[1:07:29] i say go ask dad can we go sleep
[1:07:31] somewhere so okay
[1:07:33] because they know they ain't got
[1:07:34] fellowship with mom and dad they won't
[1:07:36] do it so they'll get another sibling to
[1:07:37] do it
[1:07:40] because they know there's no fellowship
[1:07:45] that's why sometimes when people ask me
[1:07:47] to pray for them
[1:07:49] i i find out why
[1:07:51] because a lot of times they don't lost
[1:07:53] fellowship
[1:07:55] with the lord
[1:07:57] and they see you still in fellowship
[1:07:58] here and they want you would you
[1:08:00] intercede for me
[1:08:01] we're supposed to be the interceders
[1:08:08] it's exactly right
[1:08:10] you looking interesting like the prophet
[1:08:12] god let's look at type in speaking
[1:08:14] conditions
[1:08:16] he mentioned a couple of times he's when
[1:08:19] when you go to the lord if you in
[1:08:21] speaking
[1:08:22] conditions
[1:08:23] with him
[1:08:25] in other words no condemnation
[1:08:27] in your heart you know you can go
[1:08:29] straight to him
[1:08:30] because god want to talk to you he want
[1:08:31] to listen but you can't go to him in any
[1:08:34] kind of way
[1:08:35] you just can't do it that's why the
[1:08:38] first thing we need to do when we
[1:08:39] approach the lord if there's something
[1:08:41] you ought to fellowship with him you
[1:08:43] need to start with repentance
[1:08:45] father forgive me
[1:08:47] i need to talk
[1:08:50] lord i don't do this i've been this i've
[1:08:52] been thinking this lord i don't like it
[1:08:53] it's not me
[1:08:55] i need to talk then you'll feel his
[1:08:57] presence start coming he said now we can
[1:08:59] talk
[1:09:00] but are you doing all kind of things
[1:09:01] lord i need you to listen i got a
[1:09:03] situation i need you to take care of me
[1:09:05] he don't even hear it
[1:09:09] but that's why people treat you we can't
[1:09:10] treat god like an errand boy
[1:09:13] we have to approach him the right way
[1:09:17] can we say praise the lord
[1:09:20] i better quit
[1:09:22] uh god bless you but this is what was on
[1:09:24] my heart this morning
[1:09:26] because pressure is on every hand
[1:09:28] but we got to know how to let off that
[1:09:30] pressure
[1:09:31] and sometimes it takes a moment just to
[1:09:33] stop
[1:09:35] say lord help me
[1:09:37] i need to talk
[1:09:39] amen my uh
[1:09:40] even my son
[1:09:44] who's your marriage i know he's on a lot
[1:09:46] of pressure sometimes
[1:09:49] here's another thing
[1:09:51] people can be so under pressure so bad
[1:09:54] but try to get you to think they're not
[1:09:58] you can just see through that
[1:10:00] they try to cite their mind of
[1:10:01] everything is okay you could just see
[1:10:03] through it
[1:10:04] i listen to my son say the thing cause
[1:10:06] he got to make some decisions oh i'm
[1:10:08] good i figure it out
[1:10:10] yeah i'm good at it man
[1:10:11] i'm just saying all he needs to do is
[1:10:13] say dad i need help
[1:10:16] but you know what i have to do just let
[1:10:18] it keep dragging on till he can get to
[1:10:19] the place real life hey hey pop i need
[1:10:22] it
[1:10:22] can you do something for me all right
[1:10:24] don't don't don't don't
[1:10:26] you know i don't like people to you know
[1:10:28] sometimes people like to throw things at
[1:10:30] you to get you to guess what they want
[1:10:32] you to they trying to say to you
[1:10:34] i don't like that tell me
[1:10:37] hello
[1:10:38] just tell me let's get down to the
[1:10:40] nitty-gritty what's the problem family
[1:10:43] life husband
[1:10:44] but let's get to it
[1:10:46] so tell me wow she he well he hasn't who
[1:10:49] about you
[1:10:50] what about you
[1:10:52] what about you brother how you treating
[1:10:53] your life
[1:10:55] or do you feel you got some kind of uh
[1:10:57] high calling you deserve higher than her
[1:10:59] i see all of one
[1:11:02] hello
[1:11:03] you're one
[1:11:04] you work together in a marriage if you
[1:11:06] can't work together they're gonna
[1:11:08] eventually split
[1:11:09] you gotta work together and that
[1:11:11] togetherness is not your mind only where
[1:11:14] y'all come together you often have the
[1:11:15] same mind going in the same direction
[1:11:18] can we say man for the right cause
[1:11:23] the selfishness today
[1:11:25] ruins marriages because one got a goal
[1:11:28] our own personal goal and this one got a
[1:11:30] personal goal it won't work
[1:11:32] but isn't it beautiful when they can
[1:11:34] talk about their goals and they help
[1:11:35] each other with the goal
[1:11:38] working together that's beautiful
[1:11:40] because it's all it's the so we can
[1:11:42] stable lives to family we want our
[1:11:45] children to be stable that's what it
[1:11:47] should be but that selfishness and i see
[1:11:49] it a lot and it ruined marriages
[1:11:52] it's bad
[1:11:55] amen
[1:11:57] god bless you
[1:11:59] let's get the lord
[1:12:08] bless you for fine
