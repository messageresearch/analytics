========================================

just kind of break the ice and you know get on get all my scaredness out of the way this is called some church members it says fred somebody thomas everybody peter anybody and joe nobody were neighbors but they were not like you me they were odd people and most difficult to understand the way the way they lived was a shame all four belong to the same church but you would not have enjoyed worshiping with them everybody went fishing on sunday or stayed home to visit with friends anybody wanted to worship but was afraid somebody wouldn't speak to him so guess who went to church yeah nobody really nobody was the only decent one of the four nobody did the visiting nobody worked on the church building once they needed a sunday school teacher everybody thought anybody would do it and anybody thought somebody would do it and you know who did it that's exactly right nobody it happened that a fifth neighbor an unbeliever moved into the area everybody thought somebody to try to win them for christ anybody could have made an effort you probably know who finally won him amen this little parable brings to focus again the fact that each one of us is personally responsible for god's work if we leave it for somebody or everybody or anybody nobody will do it let's work till jesus comes so i thought that was real good and this one is called no excuse sunday so to make it possible for everyone to attend church next sunday we're going to have a special no excuse sunday cots will be placed in the foyer for those who say sunday is my only day to sleep in there'll be a special section with lounge chairs for those who feel that our pews are too hard eye drops will be available for those with tart eyes from watching tv late saturday night we will have steel helmets for those who say the roof will cave in if i ever come to church blankets will be furnished for those who think the church is too cold and fans for those who say it is too hot score scorecards will be available for those who wish to list the hypocrites available uh uh listed hypocrites uh present relatives and friends will be in attendance for those who can't go to church and cook dinner too we will distribute step out stewardship buttons for those who feel the church is always asking for money one section will be devoted to trees and grass for those who like to seek god in nature doctors and nurses will be in attendance for those who plan to be sick on sunday the sanctuary will be decorated with both christmas porn setters and easter lilies for those who never have seen the church without them and says we will provide hearing aids for those who can't hear the preacher and cotton for those who can amen there shouldn't be no excuse should they to come to church amen let's stand together you love the lord tonight up there i like that you know amen i appreciate that hallelujah you love him tonight you appreciate the lord amen let's just have a word of prayer heavenly father lord jesus we love you tonight lord and we appreciate you so much for your mercy and your goodness to us lord allowing us once again to be able to gather in your house with brothers and sisters of like precious faith and father we just asked oh god that you just help us tonight lord as we would try to draw something from each other lord and from your word father lord because lord that's what we come here for is draw strength one from another lord and to receive from you lord father i pray lord that we can all pull from your gift tonight lord would you speak to us through your word lord maybe through a song or whatever it may be father just speak to us lord jesus and when we leave this building we can say like they did on the road to emmaus did not our hearts burn within us as you talk with us along the way and we'll be careful to give you the glory and the honor and the praise for it all for we ask these things in saying amen if you have your bibles tonight turn with me to the book of genesis the fifth chapter then in genesis the sixth chapter try not to hold you very long or you just want to say what maybe the lord's led up put upon our hearts to say tonight and just appreciate the invitation from brother paul and just each and every one of you tonight hey man genesis the fifth chapter and we want to look at the 22nd verse and enoch walked with god after he begat methuselah 300 years and began sons and daughters and all the days of enoch were five years and enoch walked with god and he was not for god took him then over in the sixth chapter and the eighth and ninth verse it says but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord these are the generations of noah noah was a just man and are perfect in his generations and noah walked with god may the lord add his blessings to the reading of the word you may be seated i like to take for a thought if i can tonight just for a little bit walking with god walking with god and so we just we just look at this and we find out we see here in the book of genesis and there where it said in the that enoch walked with god and went on when we read in the sixth verse it said that noah found grace in the eyes of the lord and that's what i want to find tonight if i can is grace in his eyes i may not find grace in your eyes tonight but as long as i can find grace in his eyes i think i'll be all right cause i sure do want his grace and his mercy to us i sure don't want his judgment and we find out that here noah it says that but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord and these are the generations that knowing those are perfect was a just man perfect in his generations and we find out according to that message of the and the scriptures that we've been that was in the age where it was just evil altogether just everywhere you turn just evil on every hand just like it is today because the scripture did say over there in saint luke as it was in the days of uh uh a lot as it was in the days of noah shall shot me and we see that today we see all these things happening to us today don't we we see all these things happening and everything and it just goes to show us that you know do we still can walk with god if noah walked with god and the age that he was living in where the bible says that the all the imagine every man all the man's imagination was evil everywhere you turned was evil just sodom everywhere but noah still found grace in the eyes of the lord and the bible says and noah walk with god so if noah could do that what about me and you tonight amen we can walk with god i like that amen we can walk with god just the way that noah did we can find grace in the eyes of the lord but let's just look i want to look at for a little bit tonight at enoch's walk with god let's look at it here just here for a little bit it says let me just start with this what is meant by enoch's walk i think it was a walk that was it was pleasing to god because the scripture says over there in hebrews the fifth chapter and the and hebrews 11 chapter i mean in the fifth verse and sixth verse it says by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony brother paul that he pleased god that's the kind of testimony i want tonight that my walk is pleasing to him said this walked please god he had that testimony that he pleased god verse 6 says but without faith we all know what faith is a revelation revelation of what god wants his word revelation how god wants us to live and how he wants us to act says by but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is he that cometh to god must believe that he is god i believe he's god tonight amen we heard the testimony about that brother he's still the same god tonight amen i don't care who you are or what you think you are he's still jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever god hasn't lost it power god didn't go off the scene in 1965 god's still here and he's still god amen he's still the same god amen if he healed back then he can heal today because he's still the same yesterday today and forever if he saved back then he can save the day amen if he delivered back then he can deliver today amen if you need deliverance tonight he can deliver you because i believe that he amen must first believe that he is amen and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him i looked up that word diligently because i ain't too smart and it means an energetic application so i believe that when we come into the house of god we are to put an energetic application to it amen we are going to put something forth to it we should let the soul leader do it all we should let the prayer people do it all we shouldn't let the preacher do it all but we have a part to do amen i want to put everything i got into the service tonight amen and not just tonight but every service i tend to i want to put everything i got into it amen i don't have to wait for the doctor to say let's raise our hands there should be just something on the inside of me that's burning amen and i can't help it but i raised my hands to the one who bled and died for me hallelujah amen he's a rewarder of them that do that you want to get something out of the service you're going to put something into the service amen so i want to come here tonight and put my part in the service amen and say god you promised amen it's according to your word that you're a rewarder of them that diligently seek you so i'm seeking you tonight with everything i got amen i believe that's what was meant by enoch's walk amen that is what was pleasing hey man now he didn't do no special deed he probably didn't have no special gift but by faith he walked with god amen that's what it is tonight my friends it's a faith walk amen there's some things we might not understand we might not can comprehend amen but i know one thing that god's got everything in control amen we may look at the picture tonight the way the world's going and it may look bleak you say oh brother david it looks awful and i say amen but i tell you what we got a god that can see us through amen he never did say he'd see us around it it says over it he sees under it but he promised that he'd see us through it amen and i believe tonight my god can see me through hallelujah wasn't no special gift that he had but it was just by faith that he walked he took god at his word amen god said it he believed it that's what i want to do tonight just take god in his word lord whatever you say i believe it lord you said you can heal me then i believe it lord amen you said you'd fill me with the holy ghost then i believe it lord you can give me the baptism lord you can give me a refilling if that's what i so desire tonight hey and a lot of us need that amen we need god to recharge us again amen we need god to come on the scene and baptize us once again refill us with the holy ghost you know the bible says that the church was birthed in acts 2. amen they were birthed that's when the church was birthed but in acts 4 they was back in the upper room praying and crying say lord you see their threatenings you see they beat us they're going to they said that they'd whip this lord let's say they'd stone us and kill us if we preach anymore in your name come lord help us and the bible says the place where they were gathered where was shaken and they were all filled with the holy ghost and they went out and began to preach the word with more boldness than what they had before hey we need a refilling every now and then amen a renewing of our spirit a renewing of our soul amen another thing about enoch's walk i believe he realized in the divine presence of the almighty god i don't believe you can walk with somebody day in and day out and not realize they're right there hey you brothers and sisters if you work or whatever you do hey man you can't work with somebody day to day and not know a little bit about them hey you can you'll know their ups and downs you know what makes them tick what turns them on what turns them off if you if you're that close to them you know working side by side will i be the enoch he was that much he was that close so close to god that god knew him and and enoch knew god hey amen hallelujah he realized in the divine presence amen that you can't walk with someone daily without knowing that amen a little bit about him and he knew a little bit about enoch and in fact they shared the same interest amen hey man every now and then you get together with somebody on at the job or whatever and sometimes you share the same interests you know how it is when we get together with brothers and sisters of life precious faith you begin to talk about you may talk about cars you may talk about sports or whatever but it come around and say let me tell you what the prophet said here let me tell you what the bible says here and the bible says there's a book of remembrance wrote off about them who speak one another to one another about him oh i hope i'm in that book tonight hey amen so they shared the same interest they and also they was traveling in the same direction i want to be traveling in the same direction that he is hallelujah amen another thing they was going at the same pace hey they used to tell me i don't know how many used to walk to church amen any old timers in here that used to work the church by lantern light but they tell me they used to walk to church and it got dark before they got back home and they had to use a lantern to get back home by and they had to keep the same pace with the light because they said if they got ahead of the light they wrecked up and then they got to lagging behind the light they wrecked up i tell you what we need to keep the same pace with the light amen walk in the light as he is in the light because if we get ahead of the light we'll mess up brother paul but if we lag behind we'll mess up i want to keep the same pace amen hallelujah and then there was no distractions i don't want no distractions you know my my son-in-law he works for chick-fil-a and years ago they used to have a deal because you know you and you get it today you go to a restaurant and you see a family they're all sitting in a restaurant together but they communicating they're on their all on their mechanical devices god help us i don't want no distractions amen i say god whatever distracts me from walking with you lord cut it out of my life tonight lord whatever it might be lord just cut it out cut everything out that's not like you lord and another thing i want it to be heartfelt amen i don't want to just go through the motions but i want it to be heartfelt amen when i say hallelujah i want it to come from way down on the inside hey man i don't want to just be a put on there's no too much pretending today man i don't want to be a pretender amen but i want to be something that's real and genuine amen i want to be like that deer that the prophet talked about you mean that guy with the lizard eyes amen that had that whistle that blew and he seen that mother deer come out he seen something that was real god help me to help me to be real tonight help me to be genuine tonight and the only way i can do that is if i walk with him that's the only way by walking with god that i can be real and let him walk with me no distractions amen let it be heartfelt and lord let me be like abraham let me be your friend amen i just want to be his friend tonight hey man another thing about enoch's walk he had great communication i like that great communication in other words enoch could tell him of his joys and praise hallelujah oh i want to be like that have great community say lord here i am tonight lord i want to tell you how much i love you how much i appreciate you lord how much i think about you lord how much i care about you lord i want to be able to have that kind of communication with him that i can tell him of my joys in praise i can tell in my sorrows in prayer amen i can tell of my sorrows in prayer i can say lord here i am again amen and i've come just to talk to you lord i come to just to tell you lord that i've been going through this and this but lord i know you know it lord and i know you can take care of the situation i'll be able to tell my sins in confession amen just come out and say lord here's what i need here's what i've done lord would you forgive me lord i can't tell everybody that amen there's one thing about him he won't spread it all over facebook amen hallelujah amen i can tell him my sins and confession amen and he hey man he's in that we're going to advocate with jesus christ the righteous tonight amen he'll put it under his blood in the sea of forgiveness never be remembered no more oh my i love that amen i thank god for that and man and i just i want it be a continuous walk not just a day or two not just on sunday or on wednesday but every day seven days a week 24 7. hey man i want that to be that kind of walk hey man another thing about enoch's walk i believe his life was progressive hey i believe in a progressive revelation hey some things that i know now that i didn't know back then and i thank god for it amen i believe enoch's life was like that therefore he could enjoy more hey i'm that way i want my life to be i wanted to be one a progressive that i could enjoy more and if i can if i enjoy more i can understand more amen he'll reveal to me those things that i need as i have need of it hallelujah i'll enjoy more i'll understand more i love more hallelujah i love more and i'll receive more and the more i receive the more i can give out amen i want to be able to give out more amen i want to be like they was peter and john when they went to the house of prayer and they said silver and gold have a nun but brother brown said there was a that's real pentecostal preachers silver and gold have i none but such as i have give unto thee in the name of the lord rise up and walk well they didn't have it to give out amen that man would have said they're crippled but because they had something to give out hey man that man that was sitting there lame all them years hey man he had to go get a job now amen he went leaping and dancing and praising god hallelujah i like to have a dvd of that see him leaping and praising god amen because there was something that happened silver and gold have we none but such as we have amen oh that's what i and i can only do that if i walk with him amen be able to give out what i receive hey man i want my life to be one that's progressive my walk to be progressive amen that i can enjoy more receive more understand more love more and give out more amen hallelujah amen oh i believe also enoch's walk was one that was holy because god would never walk outside the way of holiness what did they do when they uh then priests went in there you know how they were dressed and they walked holy holy holy unto the lord that's how i want to walk holy holy unto the lord when that priest went out there a bell and a pomegranate bell and it ringed holy holy unto the lord and they tell me now i guess legend history declares that they try to rope around that ankle the priest because if he went out that if he went in there behind the veil behind to the holy of holies and his life wasn't right amen what happened he died and nobody could so they had to drag him out you know how you know a person's dead or not their bells stopped ringing to deny that if our bells are still ringing holy holy unto the lord i want my bells to still be ringing tonight holy holy unto the lord amen hallelujah i want him to be walking that way amen because the lord he don't have no company with the unjust and rebellious another thing about enoch's walk it was a happy one amen because with god who can be jury yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and my staff they comfort me you know what the prophet said that rod and that staff was was hard preaching amen that that comforts me you can't preach it too hard for a believer you can't say it too hard for a believer amen it was a it could be dreary if you're walking with god amen i want it to be one of joy the bible says the joy of the lord is my strength how many believes that tonight can i come out here i'll try to get you got to measure with six feet you know i ain't scared of that stuff amen let's say it's here to stay covered hey but just cause it's here to stay and it comes around every season that don't mean i have to get it every time it comes around amen 95 bad hey man i don't have to get it every time it comes around amen but let me tell you joy and happy they're two different things we're supposed to be happy people but we're also supposed to be full of joy amen happy comes from the word hat or happen in other words in order for you to be happy something has to happen the preacher shakes your hand and you're happy they sing your favorite song and you're happy they don't stay too long church service is over at your time let somebody say brother david preach as long as you want we go home at nine o'clock you're happy amen but joy comes from a different source it comes from the creator himself and if the pastor don't shake your hand if they don't sing your favorite song you still got joy and the joy of the lord is my strength amen hallelujah amen oh we don't have to be dreamy tonight another thing about enoch's walk it was a safe one what a protection he had hey i've been protected before how many times we went to a restaurant about our heads and prayed over our food especially in this iron age we're living in we better pray and god has protected us i believe there's been many times hey man here i walked here back a couple years ago i don't know there was a guy was trying to do me and my wife was eating at a restaurant on a breakfast on a one saturday morning so we get our we get a refill on our drinks and we walk out and these two guys teenagers they was in in the same restaurant and you know free country they can eat where they want to but they stopped in front of us right from the sidewalk and a buddy of theirs drove up in a car and they started uh cussing and said what blankety blink do you want and that guy got out that car and he started following me to my car my wife said i ain't gonna say nothing cause i don't know what he's trying to do well he got in my car my wife uh pushed the door at you she sat down pushed the door latches and uh and just uh but the latch wouldn't catch in the back on the in the in the back seat on the driver's side he opened my door and sat down in my back seat my wife said i ain't never seen the sign of you like this before i got i seen him in my rearview mirror i got out of the car open the back door and i said get out of my car all he did was look at me he didn't say a word he stared just stared at me eyes was kind of glazed over he walked back over to his buddies and they were laughing i said if y'all think this is funny it ain't now i got a license to pack but i wasn't packing oh i don't know what happened but i don't know if god's hand was upon us i don't know what he was trying to do amen but i thank god my walk with god it's a safe one hey man i gotta protect protection amen i got a hedge built around me hallelujah i got a hedge built around me amen because the scripture says he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty amen hallelujah you know another thing about enoch's walk it was one of honor amen do what with the king of kings and the lord of lords what an honor amen to walk with the king of kings amen the prophet of god said i counted the privilege that he came down and let me have my picture taken with him i counted the honor that i can walk with him to the tonight and not just tonight but every night every day of the week hey man oh hallelujah i remember about that little girl you remember that brother ern baxter the one of brother madam's managers you remember those i i forget where they were and you know he's from canada and they had the parade that king was coming out and they gave every uh a pupil in the school a flag to wave and so after the parade went by and the king went by and you know and every it all and that when the classes got assembled back there was a little girl that was missing they wanted to find her the teacher they found her up against a pole just to cry her heart out she said honey what's wrong is there something wrong with you said said no ma'am said well honey did you get to see the king said yeah i saw the king said well did you wave your flag said yeah i'll wait my flag said which one said well i'm so small i saw the king and i waved my flag but i'm so small i don't know if the king seen me i'll tell you one thing he sees us tonight he's seen you come in this house he sees you raising your hands and worshiping him it's an honor amen it's an honor to serve him amen it's an honor to walk with him you know another thing about enoch's walk it was one that was noteworthy because all it said in the scripture was enoch walked with god not too many details just that he walked with god now hey what what would be better than that but after you're gone and they put that on your headstone amen paula fontaine walk with god amen david gadman walk with god what an honor that would be amen you don't need too many details just that you walk with god hallelujah who needs details anyway i you know he was a public man he probably worked but you know what he still walked with god he didn't care what was going on around him he didn't let them hey man mold and and and and and and uh do the standard or proclaim the standard that he should live by he made the standard that they should live by because he walked with god amen he also was a family man because the bible says he he begets sons and daughters amen so therefore amen i remember brother homer telling me one time when they first came in the message he said man you try to listen to change and you get them and they wasn't too good because you know when we first came to message 1969 and all that and some of the tapes wasn't too good and you know the noise on the background i'm glad they filter now we can get them on our phones on our ipads ipods everything else he said he used to wait to all of his children had was in bed and it was quiet after he worked all day and he had to get in there and he tried to listen to tape because he wouldn't hear what the voice of god for this day was saying hey man hey we know with everything that's going on hey sometimes we it's kind of it's kind of hard sometimes you know especially sunday morning oh the devil's really right there ain't he you know the wise lake with the breakfast you can't find your belt honey where's my belt at it's the same place you put it at the last time you wore it you know how it is amen you know being a family you know how it is you know the kids are crying you know and all this and walking around and you find out hey where's all the joy i had and all of a sudden you had to say let's be quiet let's pray and that's god to help us amen ask god to be with us as we're going to the house of god amen and said hey who who knows who's preaching it could be brother paul it could be somebody else but hey if god's got a word for us i want to be able to receive that word that he's got for me so i want to pray for the service i want to enter in and pull from the gift so even though he's a family man he still walked with god amen he lived in an evil age it's a day of markers and despisers where few loved god church and state were proposing a lie a lot alliance fashion and pleasure rule of the day hour an unhallowed compromise was the order of the day let me just can i just read you something real quick somebody and i ain't going to read it all just the same time but somebody said wrote this as writer describe the conditions between enoch and the flood enoch's noise time and he said the universal prevalence of lust and violence encouraged by longevity which put the thought of death far away from the antediluvians was the prostimate cause of the destruction of the ungodly world a confluence of various streams of evil and swelled into overflowing torrent of corruption the adulteress or atheistical race of cain the religious decline kind and final apostasy of the sethikes who disappointed in their hope of the promised deliverer abandoned their faith are attracted by the whirling prosperity and gay lives of the canaanites gradually cultivated their society and forming matrimonial alliances with them merged into full conformity with the world the wickedness increased with filter rapidly until in the 10th generation the iniquity of the old world came to the full the tenth generation i was telling brother homer the other day i thank god for brother paul his family when i first met you know raised in this message and sometimes when we're raised in it sometimes you know how it can become it can be just come common to us hey man sometimes we need to go back and look again like elijah told his servant when he said hey when he prayed for rain and he came back said i don't see nothing he said go look again every now and then we need to look again we need to take another look amen find out what this thing is all about amen but i was telling brother homer here it was 69 my mom and dad got baptized hardy arkansas been me and my brother raise up then i get married have a family and now my family's got they're having fun four generations but i'll tell you what i still believe god's coming again and i still believe god sent a prophet to this generation and i still believe the only way in a rapture is go by the way of this message hallelujah amen oh hallelujah the bible says amen it's it here let me just say where this writer finished it he took his thoughts from psalms 14 1 through 3 where it says the full has said in his heart there is no god they are corrupt they have done abominable works there is none that doeth good the lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see if there was any that did understand and seek god they're all going to size they're all together become filthy there is none that doeth good no not one so this was the condition of the earth on the day and the day of enoch to noah every sin every evil fault thought every kind of balance every kind of corruption the aesthetic atheistic race of cain dominated missed marriages conformity by the world their heart was evil their attitudes were evil their dispositions were evil their designs were evil their walk was without was wicked and yet enoch walked with god noah walked with god both without the holy ghost like mean you did and if they did it back then we're way the world and it's the same today can't we walk with god hallelujah amen jude 14 15 says in enoch also the seventh from adam prophesied to thee said behold the lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints to execute judgment upon all and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed and all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him brother brown said like this in 1954 show us the father i can see him when he died his soul went down into the regions of the lost i can see a knock at the door of the lost somebody said who is it opens the doors and there the mingling souls they're in prison waiting for the day of judgment he said you already believed enoch you might you ought to have believed the prophets i'm the virgin born son of god that enoch said he'd come with ten thousands of his saints i'm he i'm the one and everything was written me in my father's word i have confirmed yet uh you're under on the cross it's finished close the door that's all of it they had to recognize he's still the same god that's kind of walk home again enoch's walk he finished his work early i worked some places sometimes said hey david you finished work early done a good job aren't i'm just going home he finished his work early so lord said all righty knock you done good come on home amen come on home enoch amen because he had a testimony amen he traveled faster and reached his home sooner and he was a young man in that day compared to the rest of them young man so that means you young people you can live like he not did you can walk like he did you can walk like god amen the bible says you know because flesh and blood it had to be translated flesh and blood won't inherit this kingdom so he had to be translated and the bible says that god took him i don't know if maybe some people see him when he was i don't know i ain't you know for a doctor but they seen jesus when he was taken amen all i know the bible says that god took him i believe one of these days it'd be like this some some morning between six and nine hallelujah you're gonna look for me and i'm gonna be gone hallelujah i don't know he might have been missed amen he was not found they might have looked for him like they'd look for elijah 50 men of the sons of the prophets went and looked searched and you know oh but you know what i believe they'll really miss a true child of god amen oh the bible says you know the russia has cosmonauts america has astronauts but god has was nots because he was not well god took him that's what i'm going to be i'm going to be a was not one of these days hallelujah amen i believe enoch's departure what's a testimony amen because a lot of people maybe begin to doubt of a change of body you know people begin to doubt say hey i wonder this thing is really true i say it like this it's true that's true as i know hey amen it's so true that i don't want no other amen i heard a voice one day it said come out of here my people hallelujah hallelujah you know i see y'all don't have no picture you know the one with the halo houston texas they want to condemn that if you got it hanging in your church and said you got a picture of a man but that hoffman head they don't say nothing about the hawkman head is just a painting it's just a painting of what hoffman thought christ looked like at 33 but the one with the halo over brother branham's head that's the real the prophet god said it was the same light that spoke to moses in the burning bush it was the same light that knocked paul on the road to damascus all of his high horse and it's the same light that we have tonight with us hallelujah it's still real amen oh one of these days we're going to be out of here hey man oh there's going to be a rapture there's going to be a reward for the righteous amen hallelujah that's the that's what i'm looking for hey man i'm looking for that now can i read you a couple of quotes 1954 he swore by himself jeffersonville and said and you're here to fulfill it too it says just walk unconscious of fear walk unconscious of criticism walk unconscious of the world walk as you walk in christ walk with him not paying any attention to right or left hand just keep on moving if something comes up in the church walk with god [Music] i don't like that preacher walk with god i don't like the song leader walk with god brother brown says hallelujah if sickness strikes you walk with god if the neighbor don't like you walk with god just keep on walking with god enoch one day walk by that you know what he done he walked all the way home with god all the way home with them kind of reminds me of a story there was two black sisters and they were fellowshipping together and they began to talk and say hey don't you know we had a good service last night i tell you that brother paul lafontaine whoo he sure did preach it my did he ever for more shell the corn my oh and talk about the testimonies and then other sisters said yes sir what about this one my brother that got healed my and what about this sister what about this and they're just talking and then the other sister said you know what let's get late i got to go home oh don't go home we're just having such a good time fellowshipping back and forth she said y'all but i got to go home she said i'll tell you what why don't you come walk halfway home with me so they get to walking and they get to talking about the services and about the things of god about the message of the hour and all of a sudden that sister said look at the other sister they said look at him what i've done went done i didn't walk all the way home with you she said that's all right come on in it's supper time amen i believe that's what we're going to do one day we're going to take a walk and we're going to talk with god and then talk with them and we'll say look at here lord what i've done wouldn't done i didn't walk all the way home with you he said come on in it's supper time hallelujah it's suppertime hey man he said walk with god amen he said doctor says you're going to die walk with god doctor says you can't we'll walk with god just walk with god that's all for god has promised you he never leave him nor forsake you he'll be with you to the end of the world and he took an oath by that covenant that he'd give you that he'd confirm it just walk with god then that's what i'm doing so just walk with god then same message he said don't pattern yourself after somebody of the world you're patterning yourself after him see watch him watch his life don't act like so and so does sister susie or brother jackson well i hope ain't no sister susie's in here brother jackson's but he said don't do it like they do amen or whatever it might be said don't look like don't act like them you just walk with him fill my way every day with love as i walk with that heavenly dove just stay right there with him watch how he sweetens you and cuts all the world away oh my you don't care what the people say you're walking with god hallelujah 1961 or greater than solomon but you know when something is moving in your heart to find god you don't know no fear [Music] hey man you're here tonight he said brother david i gotta have a closer walk i need more god in my life he said you don't know no fear hey you don't care who's here who's singing what hey man who's doing what you don't care how what they're dressed like what they're acting like hey man you're just you just want to find him you just want that closer walk with him that's all your desire is that's all your prayer is that god just give me that closer walk that i need he said you don't know no fear you say can i walk brother branham you really hung you really hungry to walk god's putting in your heart you say i might make a mistake what mistake god will take you through it am i you don't never don't you work don't you never worry that if god is telling you to in your heart say brother adam i like to i like to preach the whole gospel but i'm afraid to they let's com communicate me they take my papers away from it throw it back at them and start walking with god that's good just take the papers and say here keep your papers i'm walking with god again 1961 only believe he said wouldn't that be nice if we had a testimony like that brethren i do only that which pleases god that's the kind of testimony i want i only do that which pleases god amen he said wouldn't that be wonderful like he not walked with god 500 years and had a testimony that he pleased god he didn't have to die just went up so then just a little afternoon stroll he just started walking out and just thought well i've been on earth long enough i'll just walk on up and just started by faith he thought well i've been here long enough so i'm kind of tired of being here around here i think i'm just throwing up to i'll hit the milky white way and just walk off up knock on the door so that's what he did see by faith he did it the bible said so he just got tired of staying here he said well i'm just going to walk up home god just went up through he just went up through the air walking he did that by faith the bible said he did and so when he felt death come knocking around my door one night he said when i feel death come what we're knocking around my door i want to have that kind of faith don't you just say well so long old world i'm going to walk away from you now and just start walking on just walk right on up and pass the moon and stars and the milky way way and go into the spears and ears how the fear just go on into glory he said that's right that's what i want to do amen just go right on up to glory hey man he'll hit that milky white way of running hey man go running up the milky white way hallelujah oh hallelujah you talk amen like bro hallelujah i'll tell you one thing it does something to you amen it just does something to you it recharges you it rejuvenates you hey man it's just like you're just like stephen was like a house on fire on a windy day amen oh hallelujah it kind of reminds me of that story that when brother brown said about his life story about they brought that old man out there to preach he said why didn't they put some of them young preachers out there and said but he didn't take his text from what they did he took it back over there brought god down the horizon rainbow and all that said where were you at when the sons of god shouted for joy amen and all that all he said all of a sudden the holy ghost hit him he jumped up clicked his heels dancing off the platform said you ain't got enough room up here for me to preach brother i said man he had more room than when i got at home he said now if that got on the old man and made him act that way what would he do if it got on me what about us tonight walking with god oh just to get so so so up hey man just that quick and power all down on the inside the inside that ain't never in hell can take it away from us hallelujah he said he just he said by faith just started walking on up again easter seal 1965. he said let's take another man with this quick empire he said there was a man not long way long ago by the name of enoch when a new thing came along when something came along and said well now we have to go back to the old school or this that the other he not walk with god what listen i like this this 1965 the easter seal he said he not walk with god whatever god said do enoch never missed one word can you imagine he said he never missed one word what a testimony he walked with god what was he he was a son of god he was an eagle that had been called to that day all just like me an eagle that's been called to this day amen this day hallelujah when i begin to look around and i'm beginning to see things happening amen i say this day this scripture is fulfilled god said he's going to have a people that's that he's going to have a bride without smarter wrinkles at this day this scripture's being fulfilled hallelujah he's going to have somebody that's going to believe his word hallelujah and say when you when come time he was so full of that quick empire remember he had walked 500 years or more before god and not one time had he missed his word not one time did he misbehave himself i thought my not one time did he do but kept the testimony everything god told him to do he wouldn't done it he says no argument about it he said oh brother i i just happen to believe this i just happen to believe this i don't care what you believe tonight i just happen to believe this he said he just he didn't miss one word whatever god told him to do he just wouldn't done it no argument about it hallelujah not one time he said no argument he just went and done it no matter what anybody else thought he wouldn't done it why he was full of that quick empire and when it came time for that old man to die god just sent down the ladder and he walked up home he quickened him and took his mortal body up in a rapture amen that's the quickening power you believe that tonight you're walking with god tonight let's stand together hallelujah i'm walking with him tonight hey man i thought my what a walk that enoch had and i said god give me that same walk that he had lord that whatever you say for me to do i'll do it lord i won't miss one word i'll i'll be faithful to you lord jesus lord i'll have that walk it won't be just on sunday and wednesday but every day of the week lord i'll walk with you lord amen i'll fill my way every day with love as i walk with that heavenly i'll walk with you let me can i just read you one more i thought this was real good rebrands says this and then you know i thought that's real good what he said 1956 father the hour has come listen what he says he said in jehoshaphat his son rising up to take his place had a good background to look upon to see that one now listen what he says to see that when a man will walk for god and walk with god god will walk with that man i like that when a man will walk for god and with god god walk with that man and he goes on to say listen what he goes on to say he said god will walk but when that same individual turns his back from god then god just lets him shift for himself and we find out it's very sad thing when we have to shift for ourself that's amazing so when a man will walk for god and with god god will walk with that man but when that same individual turns his back and don't walk with god no more he lets that man shift for himself and said it's a hard thing for somebody to shift for themselves so my prayer tonight as we bow our heads is god don't let me never forsake you let me walk for you and with you because i have a promise by the prophet of god that he said when a man walks for god and with god god will walk with that man when that same individual turns his back and don't walk with god no more god just lets him shift for himself i don't want to shift for myself i want her tonight with our heads about our eyes closed right before we turn it back if you're here tonight and you say god help me i want to walk with you just like enoch i don't have that kind of walk that he had a safe one one of protection a holy one one that's with great complication i want to walk for you lord and i want to walk with you because you promised lord by your prophet that you said if a man will walk with me like that i'll walk with that man but if he don't and turns his back then he'll have to shift for himself i don't want to have to shift for myself i'm in enough trouble or getting enough trouble just trying to walk with him and walk for him let alone trying to shift it for myself amen god bless that hand that hand my hands up let's just buy our heads heavenly father lord we love you tonight we appreciate you so much lord jesus [Music] we thank you for everything that you've done for us lord and lord i just want to i want to walk for you lord and i want to walk with you lord may

let me walk with you lord let me walk for you lording with you lord jesus let me tell you my joys and praise my sorrows and prayer i can tell you confess my sins to you lord and you're faithful you
