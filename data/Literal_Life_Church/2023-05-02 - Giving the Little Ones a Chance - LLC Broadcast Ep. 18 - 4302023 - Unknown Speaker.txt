[Music] God I know that you are with me so I'll keep holding to your promise when all I see is [Music] [Applause] [Music] around me [Music] so out here [Music] [Applause] [Music] Deuteronomy chapter 1 and verse 35. surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land which I swear to give unto your fathers save Caleb the sub save Caleb the son of japina he shall see it and to him will I give the land that he had trodden upon and to his children because he hath holy followed the Lord so catch what he's saying here that that God is saying through Moses that none of that generation of the parents will go into the full promised land and he'll he'll explain it later but none of them will go in save Caleb and his children in verse 38 but Joshua the son of my son of none he'll go in which standeth before me he shall go in thither encourage him for he shall cause Israel to inherit so God says none of that generation will go into the promise but Caleb and Joshua verse 39 moreover your little ones which ye shall said should be a prey and your children which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil they shall go in thither and unto them will I give it and they shall possess it now the setting here this morning is of course God's Prophet Moses and he is uh saying to the people of God in Deuteronomy that God is angry and he's expressing that to say I want to let you know that God is angry with something and what God was angry with was the the generation that didn't take a hold of God's promise they didn't want to go into God's full promise they they sell themselves short or they complained and they said we can't go in even though it's been promised by God there's too many hurdles to it and so God over time in the wilderness became angry with this particular generation because they wouldn't go take the land they wouldn't take a hold of this thing they wouldn't take the promise and go take the promise that God had said this is your land and it doesn't matter the obstacles it doesn't matter what's in front of you I promised it to you and so you can go take that land but we see there's a whole generation that's that that cut themselves short in other words they wouldn't take a hold of the whole thing they stayed in the wilderness and they they wouldn't go take the full promise God was actually uh grieved Hebrews says I was grieved with that whole generation and I want you to remember this is the generation that's not out in the world or not in Egypt this is the generation that come in under a prophet under a message and took them out of Egypt and yet they stopped short of the full promise and God said I was grieved with that generation I was grieved with him and he still showed them Miracles he still delivered them he still gave them water when they needed water he still gave them food when they needed food he'd performed many Supernatural things but why was he grieved because the people that generation refused to go all the way into their promise they sent spies into the land to see if it was true what Moses and the prophet had said so catch this now everything Moses said they sent spies in and they went and and they come back and they said they said it's all there the promise is there and here's the evidence they brought back evidence what the prophet said is true and here's the evidence of it and still with the evidence there was men that influenced these parents there was men that said yes it's there but we can't do it well why can't we do it because there's an enemy there's obstacles there's Giants there's great walled cities and that intimidated them and so the parents became influenced by certain people on the internet that was bringing a bad rap on the promise said the parents were influenced to hold them back from going completely into their land because somebody influenced them to say nobody can go that far we can't make it into that there's too many obstacles no person can live that way and so they made a decision actually our children are actually safer here in the wilderness and in numbers 14 3 numbers 14 3 this is what they said and wherefore hath the Lord brought us into this land this is what the people were saying this generation wherefore hath the Lord brought us into this land the Wilderness to Fall by the sword that our wives and our children should be a prey were it not better for us to return to Egypt can you imagine the mentality and attitude that God supernaturally brought him out open the Red Sea drowned Pharaoh's Army and now they're complaining and saying our children are not even going to be safe out here or in the promised land wouldn't it be better if we go back to Egypt no wonder God was grieved with those people no wonder God was grieved that they would pass down this doubt to their children and say stay away from that that's not a good thing that's not a good influence and you'll be a prey if you get around that too much let's just stay right here and so the the parents were influenced by other people who put a doubt on God's message of the land can you imagine parents saying that our children are safer and better off in Egypt under Pharaoh what what a mentality that's a mentality that's a lie of the enemy that your children are safer back in Egypt that's one of the greatest lies your children the safest place for your children is under the promise of the hour it was a lie because their families were safer out in the wilderness with the pillar of Fire by night and a cloud over them by A Cloud by a day and a pillar of Fire by night they were safer much safer even with the Enemy fighting them against them fighting against them they were safer in the wilderness and safer in the Promised Land under a pillar of Fire even in Goshen just the outskirts of Egypt when the death angel came they were safer there with the token applied to their home and he said that Death Angel won't strike your kid your firstborn if you've got the token the safest place for your children is under God's word now I'm preaching to parents first here but I'm going to get to real quickly that God has Grace for the little ones and when the parents won't get a hold of this God says I'm going to Grace give Grace and I'm going to give a chance to the little ones can I get an amen this morning when parents mess it up and don't think I'm just preaching and beating up your parents this morning because remember there was a Joshua there was a Caleb of the older generation that went into the promise as well most of the parents just stayed in the wilderness but there were some parents there that said I want my Mountain I want my land I'm taking me and my children into it I'm not afraid of this somebody say Amen this morning that's exactly the place that my children need to be is in the promise of the Holy Ghost and I'm going to keep them in the right environment I'm going to keep them in church I'm going to keep it around good fellowship and I'm going to pray him through to the promise which is the Holy Ghost because the promise is for me but it's not just for me it's for my children it's to a media far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call so when these parents listen to other voices of Doubt on the internet they said we're not going all the way in we're staying here in the borderline borderline Believers we're borderline lifestyle we can't go back all the way to Egypt now but we can stay here and they would not fully repent and take a full hold on the promise and that angered God and he said none of that generation will go in except except Caleb Joshua and another group your little ones your little ones your children I will give the little ones a chance at my word God's Grace said I'm going to give the little ones a chance now this is amazing because you know that there is a precept that Moses said several times that the iniquities of the fathers would be visited upon the children unto the second and third generation how many reasons you hadn't heard that precept the iniquities of the father so there is a trickle-down effect of what you do as parents if you don't get Deliverance if you don't overcome things it'll trickle down to further Generations oh yeah God said it can you say Amen so the iniquities of the fathers will be visited upon the children until the third and fourth generation so even with that principle that's there God still says I will still even though that's there I will still give grace to the little ones I'll give them a chance at a Revival I'll give them a chance of the promise it doesn't matter that the parents are toxic parents it doesn't matter that the parents are borderline believers I'm going to give them a chance to break the curse any of you sit here and say well I'm not I'm not a dysfunctional parent we're all dysfunctional people because our parents Adam and Eve were dysfunctional come on now our parents Adam and Eve were dysfunctional toxic parents and we're children all that we inherited the the nature of the serpent because of our parents Adam and Eve following everybody us one of us inherited that no matter no wonder we get into trouble can you say Matt and so so I like as I said I'm not belittling this morning I'm just saying God says if the parents mess up I'm gonna give grace to the little ones to have a chance to take the promise themselves and we see it today in many cases where a child or teenager Rises up and said listen my my parents only went so far and that's fine that's between them and God but I'm going to take a hold of this promise I'm going to take a hold of this word god fill me with your spirit I'm gonna take a hold of this word the kids are going to rise up I'm gonna give them Grace I'm going to give them a chance they can break this curse handed down by their parents I'm going to give them the promise a chance at the promise none of that generation appearance will go in but the little ones I will I will give them and God said the parents will not go in but I'm leaving a promise if God I'm moving along now if God gives them a chance listen if God gives them a chance I think we should give them a chance but we're giving the little ones a chance and we had the the in this same week after 50 years the abortion laws of Roe versus Wade gets overturned by the Supreme Court it's an amazing thing now it's a victory to many people it's a victory and I'll call it that this morning it's a victory it's something to Rejoice or Rejoice over can you say Amen uh many forces have been worked at work for a long time the right to life many forces have been working for almost 50 years since the law came in to work against it and so real victory for them they've worked hard to get this thing reversed and and I I'm not supposed to be political here uh in case you're listening to this I'm not doing that I want to bring out the biblical point and show us that that when something is wrong especially for children I wouldn't call it a victory as much as I'd call it a rise of a fight to fight back and every once in a while we have a light in this country that rises up and begins to fight back the abortion laws and so so I want to say it's it's I don't I'm not calling it a full Victory because we know scripturally the the the the the iniquity will Heap up more and more and we still have it coming back to the States and and different states will decide different things but we've we find that we'll call it a victory but it's more of a fight I don't think it's an ultimate Victory as you know it's not an ultimate victory until you change hearts by the Lord you're not going to change anything until people's hearts are changed by the Holy Spirit and if you're listening here today on uh on the broadcast or anyone who's listening I just tell you you're not going to solve the problems of this nation it's almost too late as a nation the way that you can solve is that individuals getting the true genuine birth of the Holy Ghost in their lives and that's what changes the problems in our nation and so we see then that that I think it's a a a an amazing thing to see that it changed and I see that Victory take place but you're not going to have a full victory until you have the Holy Holy Spirit in people's lives 60 million abortions of babies since that law was passed 60 million don't be offended if you're listening but I'm going to say this that's you could you could call it American style genocide as Franklin Graham called it I know some people will be offended at that that's listening listen it's it's it's you have to call something what it is 60 million and if you study the generation that that pushed to pass that law back at that time it was a rebellious generation to the word people were rising up and bucking up against Authority and bucking against against government Authority and bucking up against especially God's Authority and his word and everything that was normal for years in his word it was a rebellious generation and the Beatles outwardly threw their songs and through the manner and the way they acted reflected that Rebellion many rock groups but the Beatles in particular don't be offended I'm speaking Against The Beatles but I'm trying to tell you the truth by by articles that were written they were the they were they were the front image of the entire change in that generation being rebellious to the word of God and that was the generation that passed the law that now killed 60 million babies there's a fighting back thank God for some light that's left to fight for the little ones The Unborn but don't just fight for The Unborn fight for the born fight for our children one thing for sure God is behind it because he can only take so much of Satan killing the little ones God throughout the Bible can only handle so much when Satan takes the little ones there'll be other ones destroyed but when he tampers too much with the little ones and the children God Rises up If the parents wrote won't do it God Rises up can you say Amen not just as a nation but if that child has been abused or that child has come under the wrong thing God finally says that's enough I'm going to deal directly with that heart and I've watched young people come from terrible backgrounds and God connects with their heart and says I love you you can have a different life I've actually said it to him you've got to get past the past because God has a different blueprint for your life in Matthew 18 says this is Jesus talking at the same time came the disciples unto Jesus saying who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven and Jesus called a little child unto them and set the child in the midst of them and said verily I say to you except you be converted and become as little children ye shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven whosoever there shall therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven and whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me but whosoever shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me it were better for him than a milestone Millstone was hanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea that's pretty serious and it's saying that you can't hurt a child of God without hurting God you can't wrongly influence a child and not and God not get angry about it whosoever offends one of these innocent little ones and directs them you say well what does the word there offend mean I'm glad you asked it means in the Greek scandalizo and it means to put a stumbling block or impediment in the way upon which another May trip and fall to entice to sin there's actually parents that are that are teaching their children whether verbally or by their lifestyle to dabble in sinful things God doesn't like that because you're offending a little one it also means to cause I want you to listen close now to cause a person to begin to distrust and desert one whom he ought to trust and obey so here's the person in their life they should be trusting them listen our kids cannot trust that many things in life matter of fact there's almost nothing they can trust you can't trust government you can't trust the schools you can't trust some of the leaders in the schools there's hardly anything left to trust and trust is everything because you can't have confidence in someone to come forward with Christ unless there's trust there's hardly any trust left in this world please don't take the one that they're supposed to trust and cast doubt on them is anybody listening this morning that's offending a little one is that someone they're supposed to trust someone they're supposed to uh to to obey to cause to fall away from that person and cause a person to distress and desert one whom they ought to trust and Obey it goes on to say to be offended in one in essence to see in another what I disapprove of and what hinders me from acknowledging his authority to cause one to judge unfavorably or unjustly of another since one who stumbles or whose foot gets entangled feels annoyed to cause one displeasure at a thing to make indignant to make the little one indignant make them displeased pass that down to them there's a lot of not a lot of things we can trust and I've said this before and it fits here I guess parents I'm not your enemy so don't make me the enemy I'm on your side I'm your friend there's not too many there's a lot of things that your enemy in this world but don't make true men of God and the True Body of Christ don't make them the enemy to your children give them a chance to trust even though there's a lot of mistrust there's a lot of hurt there's a lot of people say stupid things sometimes but you teach your children that's the reality of life but don't cause them to have a wall up towards the True Body of Christ and to the true ministers and yet you can be friends with everybody else thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information please contact us by visiting our website
