Why should I fear when the very same Jesus stays always near? He lives in my heart and he hears when I cry. I'll call on his name till the storm passes by. First verse out on the water. The storms raging high. The waters around them were troubled that night. Fear filled their hearts and they thought they would die. They failed to remember that the masses all stand in this next part. He spoke and he spoke the word and the winds all stood still. Even the waters they obey his will and he calms the stor just like he will mind if I just remember that he lives deep inside. So why should I worry? Why should I fear? When the very same Jesus, he stays always here. He lives in my heart and he hears when I cry. Hallelujah. I'll call on his name till the storm passes by. We read in the Bible how he walked with him brought light to the darkness when the way so dim. How great it would be to have a steps leading mine and to walk with the master all the time. So when trials come and death is so near, I just search for the master. He said we'll be there time in all trouble and my body in pain. All I have to do is call on his name. So why should I worry? [Music] Why should I fear when the very same Jesus stays always here? He lives in my heart and he hears when I cry. I call on his name till the storm pass. Last time why should I? Why should I worry? Why should I fear when the very same Jesus stays always near? He lives in my heart and he hears when I cry. I'll call on his name till the storm passes by. My s Savior, Savior. That's a prayer request would come. Hear my humble cry. And while on others thou are calling. This is my prayer Lord. Oh do not pass me by. Last time crying Savior. Crying saveior. [Music] Oh, hear my humble cry. And while on others thou are called. [Music] God bless you tonight. Uh yeah. So, like Gideon said, um I'm still here. Uh I've been to the airport several times and this last time they're like because of weather and stuff in Chicago, they keep turning us around and everything is very delayed. And I just she was going on the computer and looking for a flight for me. And I'm like, I just need to get home. And I just felt in my heart just, you know, just go with it. Like the Lord was just giving me peace. And I just felt strong like this is for a reason. And right as I was kind of feeling that way, she's like, "Well, there's probably a reason for all this." And I felt that that was a confirmation of what the Lord was saying to me in my heart. And then and then she followed up by saying, "This is a airport lady, not even a Christian." She's like, "It looks like you're supposed to be in church." So we're I was going to sing uh because he lives, but Gideon already sang it. So um let's sing that song I Claim the Blood. Let's do uh B flat. And can we just do organ to start and then you guys join in? [Music] I have a source of strength when I am weak. [Music] that takes me through when life is pressing me. Oh, I have a source of power from above. [Music] I'm covered over by a shield of blood. Let's sing it. I claim the blood Jesus shed on Calary. Those precious blood stains were made there just for me. For all my sin, my sickness, and my pain. When I need healing, I claim those precious blood stains. And I do not know how others make it through. [Music] You never go to Calary as I do for there's a hill link landing stream which flows with peace that only his redeemed can Oh, and I claim the blood Jesus shed on Calary. [Music] Those precious blood stains were made there just for me. for all my sins, my sickness, and my pain. [Music] When I need healing, I claim those precious blood stains. Let's sing it one more time. I claim the blood Jesus shed on Calary. Those precious blood stains were made there just for me. For all my sins, my sickness, and my pain. When I need healing, I claim those precious blood stains. When I need healing, when I need healing, I claim those precious blood stains. [Music] Thank you, father. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. There's a source tonight. Amen. Hallelujah. Claim it. Praise the Lord. Let's sing this song as our brother Brandon would come. This is your house. Let's all stand together and sing it. Praise God. Dedicate this temple to you, Lord. Yes, Lord. Oh, let your glory fill this sanctuary. Be enthroned on the praisees of your peace. people. Lord, we agree in unity. Tell them now that this is your house. Father, come and dwell. Your house. Oh, a holy house of prayer where the lost and the lonely bring their burdens and their care. This is your house. Oh, this is your house. Come and dwell. Amen. and God bless you this evening. And if you want to be opening to Acts chapter 3 and verse 19, just one quick announcement. Um we're going to have prayer for the young kids going back to school on this Sunday. So if you'd like to participate in that, bring your kids. God bless you. I hope everyone's doing well tonight. Looks like we've had quite a few out for uh sickness. Um or word got out that I was preaching tonight, but those were last minute things. So, I don't think that was it. God bless you this evening. Acts uh 3:19. Repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord. And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you, whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began. Let's pray. Lord Jesus, we ask you to bless your word tonight. Father, I pray that you'd help us each, Lord, to get out of the way and that you have your preeminence. I just pray you'd speak to your people and edify them this evening. take this thought you've placed on my heart, Lord, and I just pray you'd put your words in my mouth in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You can be seated. There's a couple couple things in this set of scripture that I want to look at that's been on my heart and um is just the word the word refreshing, the times of refreshing. And that that statement's been going through my mind, times of refreshing. when the times of refreshing come and we find that the word refreshing here means to refresh to cool off from the heat and actually one of the definitions of the word is revival it's revival and so the times of refreshing come from the Holy Spirit and they come when when we can have revival and it refreshes us and and then we find the restitution of all things which is to restore to perfect state before the fall &gt;&gt; it's restoration to a perfect state, which that perfect state looks back before the fall. And so, just kind of put linking these two together is there's there's a restoration that comes that's been promised for our day. And I believe that that restoration when it comes when it when it came, it it brings refreshing to us. And and not only was it just a just a a refreshing when it when it came at the time it came with the prophet on the scene, but I believe God gives us time of refreshing uh all throughout our Christian journey. And so that's the direction I want to go this evening. One thing that I noticed when I was we were going through Job is is God restores a double double uh portion to Job at the latter end of his life. And uh Job 42:12 says, "So the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning. For he had 14,000 sheep and 6,000 camels and a thousand yolk of oxen and a thousand sheasses. He had also seven sons and three daughters." Now, this is this just caught my attention here. Not not only is Job receiving a double double portion, that his trial is coming to an end. He's God's restoring and and you know, Job could rejoice in that. But what's interesting here is he's he's given seven sons and three daughters again. But for some reason this time, the scripture actually spells out the name of the daughters. And I'm I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this. I just thought it was it caught my attention. So, and he called the name of the first um I'm going to pronounce these completely wrong. Uh Jamaima, and the name of the second, Kesia, and the name of the third, Karen Hep. And in the land where no women found so fair as the daughters of Job, and their fathers gave them inheritance among their brethren. After this lived Job in 140 years, and saw his sons and his sons sons, even four generations. So Job died being old and full of days. So, it wasn't just that God gave him anything in particular. I mean, you have all these camels and all the things that Job was given. And yet, there's there's something he's he's there's an emphasis on on his children. There's an emphasis on his daughters. There's an emphasis on his grandchildren. And and uh just and I believe that there's we can start looking that and and picking it apart and saying, "Well, where's the real refreshment that Job receives? Was it from all the things or was it from the relationships? And and I want to take it even a bit further. And and was it was it all the things? Was it the restoration of things? What if God didn't do that? But yet Job came out of this trial and he knew God in a deeper way in ways that he didn't know him before. And so we'll get to that a little bit more in a minute. But but I believe it was it was it was God refreshing him after this great trial. And and I believe that this this points to something that we receive in God is and and I'm not going to spend a lot of time on trials either, but you know, when we go through trials and and tribulations, there's a refreshing time that comes after it. And I believe that even through that, if if the trial isn't done, if it isn't over, then God gives us times of refreshing all through it to keep us going, to keep us sane. Amen. But look how look how look how low he got the the the the the first time and and how he questioned God and and and then you know just this refreshment knowing God in ways he didn't before. Job 19:25 to 27 for I know my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth. And though the after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God, whom I shall see for myself, and my eyes shall behold and not another. Though my though my reigns be consumed within me. So Job is getting is is getting um a a a a vision of the restitution of all things through Christ. He's seeing Christ. I know my redeemer lives. And that's the refreshing that's coming to him in the middle of this. And then Job 42 1-6 then Job answered the Lord and said well first of all Job gets he he receives word from the Lord he he receives a a messenger from the Lord Eliu we remember but he also receives direct contact with God and that direct contact this is the end then Job answered the Lord and said I know that thou can't do everything what a refreshing to the spirit of Job through this is that through all of this hardship I know that there's nothing you can't do. He says that uh uh uh I know that there's nothing and and no thought can be withholden from thee. Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? Therefore have I uttered that I understood not things too wonderful for me which I knew not. Here I beseech thee, and I will speak, I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me. I have heard of thee by hearing of the ear, but now mine eye seeth thee. Wherefore I abhore myself and repent and dust and ashes. Job could come through this and he knew God by a headn knowledge. But he comes through this and he says, "But now my spirit, I'm refreshed. I'm refreshed in God because I I I once I I heard you, but now I see you. I know you in a deeper way." And it was refreshment to Job. And so I'm I'm bringing you tonight that there's there's a refreshment when God reveals himself to us that's refreshing to our souls. This revelation of Job is so great at the end of the book. And and and I don't know the reasons why his daughters are mentioned. I could speculate a little bit, but I don't want to do that too much other than just a couple things here, points on it, because I I do want to encourage our sisters a little bit here, too. But Job the revelation was so great that he names the names of his daughters are spelled out. His sons aren't named but his daughters are. Now daughters he's also he also says they were given an inheritance but in those days the daughter was not given an inheritance unless there was no brother to receive it. Then it could go to her. And there was actually that that became law in the book of Moses because there was a man who died and he had no sons and his daughters came to Moses and she said, "Hey, there's no there's no man to take this. What what about us?" Moses says, "Hold on. I got to go talk to God about this." He goes and talks to God and God says, "You know what? They're actually speaking right. Give them and make write this down as a law." So this this gave the daughters of God a part in the inheritance. Now that that was old testament that was something natural. But his daughters are given an inheritance among their brothers. It was rare for that day. But then even their names come out and bring out what I believe. Job sees Christ. He my I know my redeemer lives. Now just watch this a minute. I might be going out a little limb here, but I don't think I am. Uh now the one I called Jamaima was is actually Yamima. I thought mima means dove and peace. A dove is a is is peace. The next one is kito quesia which is a fragrant incense. It's expensive. It's rare. It's beautiful. And that was actually one of the incense that was brought to Christ at his birth by the w or when when the wise men came to him. Karen hap hapuk is means a horn of adornment. We know that a horn means strength in the scripture. And that that word hapuk is is actually paint. It's a cosmetic. But uh one thing that kept coming out as I was trying to research this a little bit um was in particular is the color red. And the red for the blood of Christ. It's a it's a outward beauty that comes from an inward character is the meaning of her name. So the ending of Job's trial brought peace, a beautiful fragrance from inward character growth. And that and and then he names his daughter these things. So, Job 1 emphasizes the sons, but at the end it it it focuses more on the daughters. And I just thought I thought of the daughters of Zion, a beautiful branch to the Lord, a bride adorned for her husband. She's made ready. It's it's all about the bride of Christ. And so, at the end of Job, this revelation that's coming forth is all about these daughters. Is all about the women. Is all about, you say, the church, the bride, the Christ. Over in the New Testament, we find Peter giving the wise marriage counsel. 1 Peter 3:7, "Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honor unto the wife as under the weaker vessel." Oh, we stop there. Well, the weaker vessel. But he goes on and he says, "It is being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered." So Peter's bringing this marriage council out that brothers, you can't just walk all over her. This is a daughter of a king. She has the same rights to God as you do. &gt;&gt; And and she's a daughter of the king. We ought to treat her like a daughter of the king. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I just I just thought this was just something beautiful coming out of Job. Just this this revelation is just just seems to be everywhere in him. And and and that's the refreshment I believe that Job received. I noticed how after God revealed himself to the children of Israel as Jehovah Rafa, then in Exodus 15:27, it says they came to um Eilim where uh where were 12 wells of water and three score and 10 palm trees and they encamped there by the waters. Now there's there's just something that keeps coming up when you're talking about refreshing that you can't you can't get away from this tie with water. And so here they're they're they've got shade. It was it was after their trial and God revealed one of his attributes to them. Catch now the thought the revelation God revealed himself to them to to to that they rested in a place of refreshment out of the sun under these palms near the sources of water and there was there was there's 12 tribes and there's 12 wells. There's plenty of water for all who thirst. &gt;&gt; Come unto me all who are weary and heavy laden and I will give you rest. What's what's that rest? What's the rest in the scripture is the Holy Spirit. God will give us his Holy Spirit. But I don't believe that it's just a one-time filling. I believe we need refreshing in this life. Many refillings. We need God. I I'm I'm weary this evening. I need a refreshment from you. In John 7 uh 37:38, if any man thirst, let him come to me and drink. If we drink from him, out of out of the innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. He's He's a living fountain. He He and And this is brother Brandham speaking. He to me is that fountain that saved Hagar's life and the child when they were dying in the wilderness. I believe he's the rock in Isaiah 32. He's the rock in a weary land. He's the shelter in the time of storm. When when they were in the wilderness, he struck the rock. He was the rock that water came out of and and and gave them refreshment for their for their weariness. Zechariah 13, he's the fountain that opens in the house of David for sin. And Psalms 36:9, he's David's fountain of life. He's the still waters of David. He's the green pastures. He's he's the water by the brookside for David. Remember he says, "Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I'll fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me." That's the scripture. They leadth me into green pastures. It's the refreshment for for his soul. Genesis 17, he's Abraham's nursing breast, El Shadi. But when his life was gone from him, a a man 100 years old, how will this thing be? His wife old, he said, I am El Shadi, the breasted one. uh like a baby. Now watch this. The baby that's fretting and it's sick and its strength is gone from it. Lean upon the mother's bosom and nurse its strength back. Sure. Not only when it's nursing, it isn't fretting no more. At the mother's breast, it's satisfied while it's getting its strength. That what caught me is that that fretting. If you're fretting, you're not resting. You're not you're not refreshing. You're worrying. And and and and worrying brings wearying. Yes. &gt;&gt; Worrying brings wearing. We get weary when we when we're worrying. When we're not we're not refreshed. We're we're we're we're we're nervous. We're worked up. We we we can't settle ourselves. &gt;&gt; We need a refreshing. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, if you're fretting tonight, &gt;&gt; he's Jehovah Shalom. &gt;&gt; And I just want to look at that just a minute. Jehovah Shalom is is one of the redemptive names of Jehovah. It means the Lord is our peace. The Lord is our peace. Judges 6 and 23 and 24 and I'll just reference it. Gideon was afraid and he's and he's hiding. This is the story of Gideon. This is when God Jehovah reveals himself as as I'll be your peace is Gideon and and it's a time of persecution and they're that they're they're under heavy attack and they they can't seem to to get what God has promised them. the enemy comes and takes their grain and and it and you know just seems like that the enemy is always trying to take their revelation, but Gideon is down by the wine press, you know, the story, and the angel comes to him and things and and Gideon, I just thought Gideon was afraid and he's drowning in his own complexes. Right? &gt;&gt; He just the whole thing, his whole speech back to the angel of the Lord was was, "Well, I'm this and my family's this and we're lowly and this and that and and you know, but the angel saying, but that's not how God sees you. &gt;&gt; Your name in the book says you're a mighty man of valor." &gt;&gt; But an encounter and and and a word from the Lord brought him peace to where he he he calls the place Jehovah Shalom. &gt;&gt; The prince the the prince of peace. God is the prince of peace. Jesus Christ is Psalms 23:4. Let's just read Psalms 23. It's short. The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul. He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Yay, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me, thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies. Thou anointest my head with oil. My cup runth over. He anoints his head with oil. What's oil in the scripture is is the spirit of God. He anoints my head with with He anoints us with his spirit. My cup runth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life. And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Why does David want to dwell in the house of the Lord forever? Because that's refreshing in his is in his presence. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Psalms 23:4, we we you know, thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. Well, what's a rod for? Spare the rod, spoil the child. Right? What's the rod for? It's it's it's proddding the sheep, but it's also protecting the sheep. So, you could say he took our he he it it's it's Jehovah shalom. The Lord is our peace. His direction, his correction, his protection brings us peace. Isaiah 53:5, he took our chastening so we could have peace. Isaiah 26:3, he gives us perfect peace when our mind is stayed on him. If you if you're fretting, going back to fretting, if you're fretting, just let your mind be stayed on him. &gt;&gt; When we trust in him, we trust in him. The scripture says you can have perfect peace. And and listen, I know when when things are when when our mind is spinning, it's sometimes it's hard to catch your mind and and and bring it into subjection. But I believe that if the scripture says that bringing every thought subject to the obedience of Jesus Christ, if he says that you can be in perfect peace and I'll keep your mind and your heart, then there it has to be possible. God wouldn't God wouldn't dangle a carrot out in front of us and say, "Well, keep your mind in perfect peace." when we know that this world is keeping our mind all stirred up and we're and and it's just a time of anxiety and and and it's just the world we live in and it's fast-paced and and I want to get to some things in a minute and I just thought, but God, how do we how do we do that in this age? Talks about the cool of the morning and the dew and enjoying it. And I thought, well, but I mean, I literally you get in your truck and you go and you flying down the highway because you're getting run off the road otherwise. And and I just thought, where's the enjoyment? But there has to be if God says you can keep your mind in perfect peace. There has to be a perfect peace in your mind, that's possible. &gt;&gt; God doesn't do that to that would be a cruel father. &gt;&gt; God doesn't do things that way. So it has to be possible. &gt;&gt; John 14:27, he gave us his peace as he went to Calvary. Not as the world give I uh uh not as the world I give you my peace. Not the peace of the world. The peace of the world fades away. It doesn't last long before you have to find something else for your peace. Before you have to find something else for your comfort. That's why you know you you'll hear us say you got to what are you turning to for your comfort? What are you looking for for peace? What are you turning to when you want refreshing for your soul? Because it it's okay to watch a little something. And it's okay to, you know, enjoy things that are in this world, a little vacation or something, but but it's it's if you if you're constantly going to those things or if you're turning to the wrong things in those times, you're going to you you your spirit can't isn't actually it actually makes your spirit fret more. It makes your spirit more anxious. So, we have to go to the right source for our peace. Amen. &gt;&gt; Philippians 4:6-7, "Don't be anxious, but give everything to him in prayer and seeking him, asking him about it, &gt;&gt; giving him thanksgiving." This is my own words. Letting him know what our request is, our desire, our heart. God wants to know your heart. &gt;&gt; And he and he and he trades all of your worry with peace, which passes all understanding. Peace so powerful that it keeps our hearts and our minds through Christ. That's that's attainable. &gt;&gt; That's possible. &gt;&gt; That's and that and that is for you. Everyone say that's for me. &gt;&gt; That's for me. &gt;&gt; That's for me. &gt;&gt; Some of you aren't moving your lips. That's 100% participation, please. That's for me. &gt;&gt; That's for me. &gt;&gt; Thank you. God bless you. That's true. &gt;&gt; But you see you see that now I'm not going to I'm not I'm not criticizing you, but I'm just saying why why didn't you speak it? &gt;&gt; Is it because is it because we're tired? I get it. Or is it because you don't believe it? &gt;&gt; Because I'm telling you that's for you. &gt;&gt; So So listen, cast down the negative thoughts. &gt;&gt; Cast away, like brother Paul was saying Sunday, cast away the negativity from your lips. And and when you're feeling weary, when you're feeling burdened, when you're feeling like your mind is just spinning and spinning, start speaking word. Start speaking. But go tell God, "Brother Brandon gave me permission that I can claim this for myself. &gt;&gt; If you've got any confidence in me, forget me. It's the word of God. Speak the word of God &gt;&gt; that you it is for you. Speak those things. Worrying is not refreshing. Like I said, worrying causes wearying. &gt;&gt; It there's no merit to worrying. &gt;&gt; It it it can it can actually drive worry can actually be used to drive us to God, but that's where we cast our cares upon him because he cares for you. And then you leave it there. &gt;&gt; But it can cause us to get in his way, too. If we're not bringing it to God, then we can act out of our worry and make the situation worse. There's no merit. I was thinking there's no merit to worrying. You don't get an award for worrying. &gt;&gt; You don't get to the end of the road and get a medal. &gt;&gt; There's no medal for worrying. &gt;&gt; It must be possible. In fact, you get a crown of gold &gt;&gt; when you cast your cares upon him. &gt;&gt; It must be possible to cast our cares upon him because the scripture says, &gt;&gt; "Hallelujah." &gt;&gt; Amen. Another thing that doesn't refresh us, I'm just going to list a couple things that came to my mind. Another thing that doesn't refresh us, staying outside the presence of God. Our opening scripture said times of refreshing that come from the presence of God. So if you want to see receive times of refreshing, then you have to be where his presence is. &gt;&gt; We we have to be in his presence. Staying away from church and where the body is is not refreshing. Right. &gt;&gt; We're to assemble ourselves the more as the time as the end time approaches. If we say we believe we're closer, now this is this is what got me as I was thinking about this. If we say we believe we're closer than we've ever been and then stay away from church and the things that the church is doing, I'm not so sure that you really believe we're closer than we've ever been. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Because if you really believe that, then you would follow what the scripture says and you would assemble yourselves all together all the more. One time Jonah ran from the presence of God and it caused a great storm that affected those around him negatively. He ran from the presence of God and you remember the storm rose up and they said, "What is this?" And he said, "It's me. Throw me over." Soon as they got rid of rid of him, the storm stopped. All right. &gt;&gt; Jonah caused the storm &gt;&gt; running from the presence of God and it affected that's what that's the key. It affected those around him. &gt;&gt; Cain went out from the presence of God and created his own way of doing things. &gt;&gt; What did that create? It brought death &gt;&gt; and it brought weariness. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He created civilization. And what's what's it bring us? We get weary. &gt;&gt; It's true. That's true. &gt;&gt; Adam and Eve went out from the presence of God and since then has been sorrow and putting on religion rather than getting the real thing. &gt;&gt; And when you put religion on, you're not refreshed. &gt;&gt; It's not refreshing. &gt;&gt; Sometimes sometimes now we can go from I was just thinking about something brother Paul's always taught taught me. Sometimes we can go from event to event to event. And even though we're going where the presence of God is, we're not really refreshing ourselves. You have to get refreshment for yourself. It could be we're we're just simply so busy that we're not slowing down enough to receive the refreshing in those times. &gt;&gt; We're we're giving out, but we're not receiving in. &gt;&gt; We have to make sure we're refreshing ourselves in the Lord. &gt;&gt; Very good. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, what refreshes us? I put this in because of this past weekend and I thought it was it was real good. And if you want to want to read a little more of what brother Brandham says about music, it's in this it's in the message life and 58 uh May 12th. And he says that's real joy to my heart and I was so glad to refresh myself in the presence of that good singing tonight. I don't want to go. I don't want to go. It's It's the music's too loud. I don't like the songs they sing. That church, they you know, the way Ike plays the drums is just offensive. I don't see them, so I I guess I could say that freely. But I just thought it was good. That's amazing. The it it refreshes myself in the presence of that good singing. For all who worked to make this last weekend what it was, Abraham was met by Melzdc after his battle for Lot. Abraham gave out for his brother. &gt;&gt; He recovered. He went and he and he and he he he went to war for Lot. and and the musicians, the singers, the event in itself, it was you you're going you're you're letting out of your your own energies, your own uh uh your gifts, your your your everything you are. You're pouring yourself into the event. Abraham did that. And after that, he met God. &gt;&gt; And so, I believe that there's a blessing for you. &gt;&gt; You might be tired and weary still tonight. You might be homesick after the event, but I believe that there there's a blessing for you. &gt;&gt; And and and and there was there was revelation for for Abraham. He knew Melzdc. He knew God. &gt;&gt; It it was refreshment to him. It it was they communed together. That was refreshing to Abraham. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the third seal, he says, "When the truth of a promised word of God," and this is I really just want to try to lay this in as I as much as I can. When the truth of a promised word of God has been truly revealed to his saints that's filled with oil. They get stimulated. Wine is stimulation. Glory. I feel it right now. Stimulation with joy. Shout. See, for with stammering lips and with other tongues will I speak to this people. And this is the refreshment. This is the wine that's poured out. What is wine in the Bible? Refreshment. This is the refreshment that comes from the presence of the Lord. It's got to be scriptural. But they were stimulated by what? By revelation. &gt;&gt; So the revelation is wine. And brother Brenham's saying wine in the in the in the scripture that was the refreshment that when they they couldn't drink the water, when they needed refreshment, they would drink the wine. Wine. We drink wine. It's the revelation. It's it's the word of God. made plain. It's It's vindicated revelation made plain. It brings joy. It it it if you're down, it makes you happy. &gt;&gt; It it encourages you. &gt;&gt; It it it does all these things we need for refreshment that we look for. Uh the the the scouring out by the gospel. When you scour something, you're refreshing it. True. &gt;&gt; You know what real victory is when you've been refreshed by the word, hearing the full gospel when you come here and you hear the full gospel preached. And and and you know, just thinking about the the I just had that thought, the rain on my mind. The rain and there's a former rain and a latter rain that's been poured out. It shall be light in the evening time. Even when it's dark, misty, neither night or day, it shall be light. But but the the the the the former rain, the teaching rain, the sewing rain, and then the latter rain, the harvest rain. It it needs the anointing upon it. It needs the spirit of God upon it. You have to come into the presence of God. You you need to stay in the word because that's the refreshing, the rain that falls. When God washes us by the water of his word and separates us from sin and unbelief, it's a refreshment to us. the the the the the water and the rain and and how how a a drink of cool water is refreshing. Rain is refreshing, especially after a drought or when the humidity is high. You know, we get high humidity and it just you walk outside and it just it just feels wet. The moisture's in the air, but it's a miserable wetness. &gt;&gt; Let the rain come and there's something refreshing about a soft rolling thunder and the sound of rain. Amen. &gt;&gt; The smell right before a rain, the the the odor, the the the the the perfume, especially in desert country. So, you feel dry tonight &gt;&gt; in the desert country out in Arizona before the rain, you get this just this beautiful rich smell that comes just I don't know how to describe it other than wet dirt. It just smells like wet dirt. It gets this wet dirt smell and it's so fragrant and lets you know that the rain is coming when you're when you're when you're feeling weary, when you when you're feeling dry, when you feel like you're not connecting, it just just pray for the rain. Just God, give me revelation. God, bring the rain. Bring revive my soul. I I'm dry now, but the but in the driest times, it's when the be the rain is the most beautiful. the revelation, the the the the the teaching, the the spirit coming and watering that word &gt;&gt; rain dropping down upon the natural vegetation of the earth. It's a type of spiritual rain which gives eternal life. Scripture calls it the former rain. So we we we went through this. The rain produces the blessings upon the earth and the spirit reigning produces the blessings of God. But we can get so caught up on the blessings of God that we forget where the blessings came from. &gt;&gt; And so we're not just we're not just enjoying the blessings of God, but we want to enjoy God. &gt;&gt; We want to enjoy the revelation that comes with the blessings. If I come and I'm just getting blessed, that's that's not stimulating. You might you the rain falls on the just and the unjust. Now, I'm not calling you just and unjust, but I'm just saying it it it can fall and you can get stimulated, but it's not doing anything. It's not really refreshing you. You need it to go deeper. You need it to water your soul. At the end of the service when the full gospel's been preached, the refreshing that comes from giving our praise to him, the Holy Ghost watering that promise that you received through the word being preached &gt;&gt; for your healing, for your salvation, for a better walk, for for fear to leave you, for whatever you have need of. But if we always leave right after the service, &gt;&gt; come on now. &gt;&gt; Sometimes before the ministry has dismissed, we miss an important part of refreshing ourselves. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We water. We give back to God. And God, we we just ask him, Lord, just just water what you've given me. &gt;&gt; And it and it's and it's it's that hurry. It's that rush. Why are you in a hurry? &gt;&gt; Why are you leaving so fast? You're missing you're you're missing a blessing. &gt;&gt; You're missing an important part of the service. You're checking out too soon. &gt;&gt; You you you might want to just clock in and clock out, but you're clocking out too early. &gt;&gt; Receiving the Holy Ghost into our souls is the greatest refreshing. &gt;&gt; Even after we receive the spirit, we need those times of refreshing. The the the they the um they were up in the upper room. They received the spirit of God. It was refreshment to them. But then just two chapters later, I think it is. They needed another refreshing. &gt;&gt; They were in fear. They they were worrying. But when that refreshing came, the worry left. &gt;&gt; When you're sick and come into his presence, we are healed. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; When the doctor says there's no more can be done or says it's cancer, the best thing we can do is get them into the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham's talking. He says this woman on the stretcher he said what what do we do for what what can we do? We lift her into the presence of God. You create an atmosphere &gt;&gt; so that they can come into the presence of God and receive their healing. You see this goes much deeper than the thing than what we think it is. You come and you create an atmosphere. You put your lick of fire together and that creates an atmosphere of refreshing not just for you but for the one who might be sick or discouraged. But we can just send the presence of God to them if they if they're too sick and they can't make it. Sister Sister uh Galuchia was telling me, Emily, they want to be here, but she just can't right now. We can send the pres sister Emily, we send the presence of God to you just now. &gt;&gt; We can send it to them. We lift them up. We lift their name up before the throne of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. And when the church gets to that place where Christ means so much to us that we thirst to get in his presence and with each other, it's lifegiving resource. Brother Brandham said, &gt;&gt; "What is any sweeter?" I'm I'm coming down fast now. Just I just I was thinking, you know, we're talking about the spiritual things, but there's natural things, too, that refreshes us that God gives us in this life. And one of the things that came to my mind, I guess, along the lines with what we said Peter's Peter's wise marriage council was joint joints of grace. Uh uh and and what is any sweeter in a man's life? What is any sweeter than to come home when he's tired and weary with his little bucket in his hand from working all day or plowing or whatever he might be to walk in and have a lovely wife to meet him at the door. Sit down on his lap a minute and brush his brow a little and kiss him on the cheek and put her arm around him. Say, "Dear, I know you're tired. You You've worked so hard. Give him consolation." Now that he knows that that arm is around him is absolutely his. It's his. Never is it around any other man or any other desire. The kiss that's on his cheek is from real pure holy heart that just loves him and him alone. How it makes you I know makes you stick your chest out and say, "I'm not so tired after all." See, that's it. It does something to you. That's something God gives you to refresh you. &gt;&gt; He that finds a wife finds a good thing. What is more refreshing than a husband putting his arm around his wife after she's had a long day with the kids? Taking taking care of the house, maybe feeling a bit lonely and down. A husband giving his wife an affectionate hug. Giving her a little a little kiss of affection, letting her know she's beautiful to you still. Even though I I don't know if it's somewhere in the message and men latched on to it or where it came from, but even if she doesn't greet you with a bow in her hair and her hair's, you know, sticking up every which way, this this is war with them kids. &gt;&gt; Telling her she still looks beautiful. Giving her somebody to talk to to to let her know somebody loves her and was thinking about her throughout the day. &gt;&gt; That's refreshing to her. That refreshes her spirit. She might have fought them kids and and might have might have lost a little bit, but reinforcements is home with bigger guns and just just that is a refreshment to her. &gt;&gt; It's refreshing to be around godly friendships, &gt;&gt; that believe the way you believe, &gt;&gt; that support you in what you do, &gt;&gt; that laugh together and relate to each other in the time of life you're in. That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Seems like if we'll show ourselves friendly and get around a bit that God gives us good friendships in the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Friendships that'll refresh our spirit. That'll that'll that'll refresh us and and and help us in life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Youth meetings are a good thing to attend. &gt;&gt; We we do them here for you. &gt;&gt; And it's a good thing to attend. It's good friendships to build. It's good refreshment. It's, you know, you go to school and you and and you go to schools and maybe it's a it's a it's a good school, but maybe they don't believe exactly the way you do. Maybe you go to public school. It was always a refreshment to me to come in. I I mean, I needed a place to go and I was going to find some place to go because that's just what teens do. &gt;&gt; But I was given a place to go each Friday night. And and and I took it up. And I I mean, I had a great time growing up. We had good friendships. We had good good teaching and and it was just it it's a memory to me. &gt;&gt; They're good. They're good things. &gt;&gt; So, I'm get I'm getting close to the quote you have, but not yet. Just a little bit more reading. And every Christian comes the same way when he comes into the presence of God. First, he has to be refreshed. The Holy Spirit has to take hold of a man, renew him, and make him another person. The Holy Ghost comes in just a refreshment. The Holy Ghost comes in the quiet of the hour. God has to give you a spirit that makes you even even agreeable. You're you're just you're not quiet. Your spirit's not quiet. &gt;&gt; You know, you go out in the morning real early when the de is on the ground. The dew falls just before daylight. Usually sometime in the night after the hustle and bustle of the world is gone, is to bed after everything's asleep. Did you ever go out early of a morning and you go out early and and everything is so fresh? Just feel fresh early in the morning. The old earth has been hit away for a while and it's refreshed. Have you ever got up in the middle of the night and you just you just step outside for a minute? You there's less cars anyway, &gt;&gt; less cars. There's just there's a stillness in the air. There's there's a quiet the God God has laid the earth to sleep &gt;&gt; and there's just it's just a refreshing just to step out into that quietness &gt;&gt; and did did you ever come in the presence of a man or woman who had hid themselves away from the world remember Jonah Jonah left the presence of God and look at the negative effect but this is somebody who's going to the presence of God a man or woman hid themselves it's a refreshing to talk to him they refresh themselves elves, they begin to come to life. And did you ever go into the rose garden early of a morning up down the highways real early dees on the ground hold the odor of honeysuckle and so forth? Just like a Christian who has hid himself away with God in the stillness of the night or somewhere and come forth the next day with a freshness, a odorous life, a pleasant place to be, somebody you like to talk to, &gt;&gt; somebody that can encourage you, somebody you got confidence in. You want people to talk to you. &gt;&gt; Refresh yourself in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; People like to talk to you. Your neighbor over there, how you love to talk with her. See, it's the freshness, the odorous. Um, and the thing and the and the next thing, it yields fruit. Everywhere the Holy Spirit comes, it always plants the seed of God and yields fruit. The the staff of of uh Moses was placed in in the glory of God, the shikina, and it budded. It came to life. And that's what he's saying. When you get into the presence of God, you come to life. You produce fruit. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Another great thing of entering into this place is a place where you can have confidence. You can believe. You can have confidence. You need confidence. Get into the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Now, this is the quote you have. Look at it. Look at it. The budding. The first thing we find out what makes trees bud, it's a refreshment. What makes the refreshing? Early of a morning, you go out early, find out after the night, everything gets still, the dew falls and it brings a refreshing. The trouble of it is today the people don't have time to get before God and get still. The trouble of it today, the people don't have time to get before God and get still. &gt;&gt; They got so many things to do. They belong to this. They got to do this. They got to do have this. They got to be here. You don't have time. Listen, the devil's just took up all your time. &gt;&gt; Oh my &gt;&gt; my my. The devil is taking up all your time. I think we need to reassess what we're busy doing. &gt;&gt; The devil's taking up all your time. You don't have time to get still before God, to get quiet. You don't have time. I I you know, this is this is amazing. I want to be refreshed. I need refreshing. Well, get just get still be I don't got time. I don't got time. Well, the devil's pulled something on you. &gt;&gt; Get in the quiet. And remember, after all, you're a nature. And after all, nature gets quiet. Isn't this amazing? And still, then the dew begins to fall. That refreshes and brings forth life. And you are a nature yourself. &gt;&gt; And when you get quiet and still, I'm giving you the keys now. Amen. &gt;&gt; When you get quiet and still before God, then the dew of heaven begins to fall and begins to refresh. &gt;&gt; Did you ever go out of a morning after the night has passed early of a morning also it blossoms to give fragrance? And did you ever go out early of a morning to the define the fragrance? You find out that early of the morning when you get out the dew is hanging low, the trees are budding, the blossoms are coming up, the perfume is go along the road, smell the honeysuckles into the rose garden. That's why it's been quiet. Nature has through the night. It got quiet and God bathed it in refreshing. &gt;&gt; That's what you need to do is get away and get quiet before God so he can bathe you with the refreshment from heaven. Amen. Get alone to yourself. Close the doors. Pull them together and say, "Now, Lord, here I am in your presence. &gt;&gt; Here I am in your presence." Musicians, you can come. &gt;&gt; You can stand to your feet. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just bow our hearts for a minute as they as they prepare and just let your let yourself get quiet for a minute. Been hustle and bustle all day. It's it's work and kids and school and things and just just let yourself get quiet. And I pray in the in the presence of God that you'll you'll feel refreshed tonight. Lord, I pray for your people this evening. I pray for I I need refreshing, Lord. Just Lord, we go through trials and tribulations and and just everyday life and we're battling constantly. The accuser of the brethren comes before us day and night and Lord, it it weies us and then we we we just there's so much in this life that Satan has created. Not only does he steal our time from us, makes us so busy that we we can't get still. Even when we do get a quiet moment, we can't still ourselves. It's just we're we're too busy. He's created this environment around us. And yet, Lord, yet you've promised times of refreshing. And so Lord, just feeling your presence now. I pray that everybody under the sound of my voice would feel your presence. And Lord, we don't just want your blessings. I I I remember reading when when that vision came and that blast and or the dream or whatever it was before it had happened and it worried brother Brandham and and he said he just he just came and he was praying and and your power came your anointing came down and he said that's real power. He said, "That's not the blessings you feel." Lord, we thank you for the blessings. We We want the blessings, but Lord, we want something deeper than the We want the We want the one who's giving the blessings, Lord. We We want and and I don't mean it arrogantly, Lord. We want We want power to live every day. We want your anointing. We want, Lord, and and by that, we can't just have your blessings. We need you, Lord. We need you, Father, to to stabilize our minds, to to stabilize, Lord, our nervous system. Lord, we need you. And we we cry out to you, Lord. We we tell you just humbly just now, Lord, with with lifted hands, we need you, Lord, and we need refreshing from you tonight, Lord. were weary. Father, many have given themselves out over the weekend. They're weary, Lord. It was a great weekend. I'm not taking from it. I'm not knocking it. But I'm just saying, Lord, we're tired and we just need refreshing, Lord. And I pray you'd grant it tonight to every heart. Those who need who need healing, we lift them into your presence. We lift Sister Emily into your presence tonight. We lift those who can't be here. We lift brother Tom into your presence tonight. &gt;&gt; We lift sister Loretta into your presence tonight. We lift little Gyra into your presence tonight. Brother Jim, all the ones Kenny and Tina, Elelliana, anyone else, Lord, who who needs a touch from you, Father, refresh them. Let your presence pour out upon them, Lord. We ask it just the the best way we know how. We ask for your refreshing now for every weary soul. Just Lord, Lord, just feeling their weariness just now. I pray you'd refresh them. Let your spirit come. Lord, as we just sometimes we do have to go right away, but Lord, we just want to stay a moment. Let you water what the what what promises you've given us tonight. Let you water your word. &gt;&gt; Lord, we ask you, Father, you've you've brought seowing rain. Now bring reaping rain. Just water the word with your spirit. Lord, water it with your presence. Give us refreshings, I pray, Lord. Refresh this church. refresh this body, Lord. I've been thinking there's a there's a song and I'm just too inadequate to sing it, but send us a Holy Ghost revival, Lord. Not just bathing the church with it, but bathing every heart with it, every individual with it. Bring us revival, I pray, as as Satan sws his evil seed, trying to thwart the master's plan. the servants's tired and discouraged. They're doing the best they can, but Lord, we need a Holy Ghost revival. &gt;&gt; Revive us, Lord. I pray &gt;&gt; in Jesus name. Jesus name in the presence of Jehovah [Music] God Almighty.
