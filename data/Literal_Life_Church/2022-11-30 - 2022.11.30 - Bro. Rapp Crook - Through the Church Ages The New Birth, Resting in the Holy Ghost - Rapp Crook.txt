TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we made it glad for that and just uh just a month ago it I feel like I'm kind of rusty and out of uh out of rhythm because a month ago we had lost my voice uh one uh three or four days out of that week and it was just I I warned Brandon on Monday said I hope I can make it but just be ready just in case and and he was and I appreciate that but uh what's uh we finished up the uh we're toward the end of the uh smyrnian Church ages we're going through the uh Church age book and uh last time we I believe it was we talked about uh Alberta Brandon restored the truth that there's no eternal hell that uh that um you'll be it'll be a limited time of punishment but the only one form of eternal life and that's God's life and by making Eternal uh hell a place of geography um hell is just where you're at and the eternal life is where it's where God's at geography isn't the basis of what eternal life is it's a relationship and brother Branham restores that and it's just beautiful wait when you see it that way but toward the end of the uh um the Smyrna Church age um brother Brandon you can have Security in your relationship with God this is the kind of experience this Cliffhanger experience that's what the devil wants us to experience in her walk with God but what God wants us to experience is this it's still an exciting experience but is this person hanging on by his own strength he's not he's able to completely rest in the strength of the ropes and the strength every time how he's anchored and he's in a dangerous spot but he's resting and there's a picture and one from Brother Lonnie's teachings I got years ago and it's of of this guy hanging onto this chain link this this change he's going over the Flames of hell just hanging on for dear life I couldn't find that Graphics I had to come up with these but that's what the devil wants us to experience we're just hanging on for dear life but this is what it really is in the next picture was the fella is sitting in the chain and he is just gradually rioting across he's resting upon not his own muscles or his own grip he's resting on the strength of the chain and that chain is the grace of God will get us over and that's what we're trying to get here as and if I could just put the service in a nutshell the new birth is simple as God brings in the scriptures brother Branham teaches it it's simple the devil wants to make it complicated because if it's confusing he's got us if he can get us confused he's goddess because there we have it confusion is one of the Satan's Chief tools so if you're getting confused hey it's not the work of the Holy Spirit that's getting you confused we'll talk about how each Christian's experience will vary we don't we don't measure ourselves by ourselves we don't have to imitate somebody else's experience that's very human to do that but that's not how God works God is Not and they're creating cookie cutter Christians every single person is going to be unique and when we can rest in who we are in Christ rest in the Holy Ghost we will be the most individual that we have ever been when the when the world talks about individualism it seems like everybody gets more and more alike because they're getting pressed into the devil's image but when we're resting in who we are in Christ then true individuality comes out because it's the uniqueness of Christ and each one of us that's coming out we get actually get in God's way when we try to imitate another's experience been there done that yes we we get in God's way the book of Galatians says we don't want to frustrate the grace of God but we do that when we try to imitate someone's experience another's experience and lastly just try to hammer away if the new birth doesn't depend on us we repent we're baptized God does the rest we just continue on walking with him the devil wants us to think you've got to do this this this and this and then you might you might come into qualification to receive the new birth baloney that's what the devil wants us to think so that we won't even have the guts the boldness to enter into God's presence but no my son didn't have to worry can I present my list to Dad it's it's there's that relationship then the Acts 2 37 you repent you're baptized in the Name of Christ for the remission of sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost God does not pay you the Holy Spirit he does not exchange you the Holy Spirit he gives you the Holy Spirit it's a promise it's unto you to your children to all that are far off as many as the Lord Our God shall call about a month ago I believe brother Ken Andes was here before coming he was just sharing how simple the new birth was and I just really appreciated his perspective on and he quoted this next scripture he says if you parents if you know how to give good gifts to your children and your carnal you're evil you know how to give good gifts to your children how much more shall your heavenly father give good things that ask of them and again the devil corrupts Us by saying yeah sand is watching you and only if you're really really good will you get something for Christmas that's parents have a different kind of relationship it's not paying it's you're giving out of the goodness of of of of of your heart but how the devil wants to switch that relationship in our minds and it's not the goodness of God it's not the grace of God it's our works to earn something from God that's what he wants to get and it was interesting this comparing this in the in the book of Acts when Simon the Sorcerer he wants he sees what what Peter's doing there in Samaria and he says mike Peter I'll pay you and if I can pay you enough will you give me the gift of the Holy Spirit and Peter says thy money perish with thee because you thought that you could purchase the gift of God with money now none of us have probably asked the Lord God how big of a check do you need to write and put an offering plate in order to get the Holy Spirit we haven't probably thought that way but we've probably thought how many hours can you spend at the altar how long do we need to fast how many how many of this that or the other thing do I have to have done before I can receive that and then we're thinking and we're really what we're thinking we're trying to buy it we're trying to get good enough and God's saying the same thing your good works perish with thee because you thought that you could purchase the gift of God with money and when someone is giving you a wonderful gift and then they want to pay you for it and pay you for it that almost ruins the gift experience because it just wants to be generous just just receive the gift and say thank you and appreciate but you want to pay it for me that ruins the giving experience if that's what the devil wants us to do he wants us to get the idea that we can pay enough but could we ever pay enough no all he's trying to do is to Rob us of the joy of serving God so he can keep us on pins and needles wondering am I going to make it am I going to make it this is a White Knuckle experience when really all we we can actually let go over the Rope because we're sitting in a seat that's eternally cure anchored by God himself we can sit back and enjoy the view and take our rest to take a little climb further take our rest that's the Christian experience that God intends for us one that is filled with joy and peace yes there will be trials yes there will be turbulence but through it all we can still have joy and peace so no we can't purchase the gift of God with money Simon couldn't it and we can't purchase any gift of God with any amount of good works in the book of Philippians Paul writes that we can be confident of this very thing they who began the good work in you will perform it to the day of Jesus Christ he is the author of it he's the finisher of it all we have is a role in the story but he's the author he's the finisher we can relax so like I right here in the notes the devil wants our Christian experience to be a white knuckled Cliffhanger when God intends for it to be a journey of peace and joy because we can rest secure what he's already done for us so this evening I Pray by God's grace that we can emphasize that the new birth it is a supernatural experience which makes it difficult to Define in its specifics we want to be able to nail down exactly what happened how it happened what happened when it happened and we won't have every single detail so we can be completely secure but it's a supernatural experience which is going to defy explanation of all things we're just going to have to accept some things by faith um when we focus on having a particular experience I will know I have had the Holy Spirit if I experience X if I get a revelation of x if I get something then if that's our mentality if we're not careful we're going to start pursuing that thing that Revelation that experience instead of pursuing Jesus Christ we get the cart before the horse but that's what the devil tries to get this to do we we unintentionally start seeking something else other than Christ and the devil loves it if he can get Christ clouded out of our picture then we're not looking at him if we're looking at him Paul writes in First Corinthians as we gaze At His Image were transformed into that image but if we can start looking at our own image and our own imperfections the devil's goddess because there's nothing that's going to be transforming us to be greater than that so without realizing when we have this mentality that I've got to have X or Y before I have the Holy Spirit and we pursue X or Y instead of Christ and then we're seeking God by our own Works instead of by faith and as soon as we start doing that we lose our peace we lose our joy and our Christian experience becomes a white knuckled cliffhanger I love the quotes for brother Branham talks about um how the Christian Life is built entirely upon rest and a couple of sermons in 1956 he he talks about this he talks about he woke up in the middle of the night and starts preaching to his wife and just sharing with her what God showed to him how the Christian Life is based solidly upon rest a Christian's not tossed about a Christian doesn't run from place to place a Christian isn't fuss fume worry about things a Christian rests it's all over it's all finished for the believer at Calvary at Calvary Jesus Christ is it calvary it's finished we've come to faith in Christ it's finished it's all finished there we've repented we've confessed his name the rest is just going to be working out what's already been put in this as we take in Christ's nutrients as we're in as we're receiving more if we continue walking with him the rest is just going to happen remember Minister ministering one time talking about why is the Old Testament so much longer than the New Testament why could the New Testament be so short well in the Old Testament a lot of Abraham's life is told a lot of David's life is told the ups and downs everything in between in the New Testament the only part that really needs telling is when somebody comes to Christ because you've got that part the rest is definite the rest is going to happen it doesn't really matter what happens after that because you've had that experience the rest doesn't need to be told so that's I think that's beautiful we can just rest amen the top of page two he says the whole principle the whole Christian principle is based upon rest and he says as he was lying there in bed next to his wife it was just burning in my heart resting he said why are we troubled Jesus said let not your hearts be troubled we're just resting come to me and ye can find rest but when our hearts are troubled where do we go a lot of times we don't go to Christ we'll go to our favorite playlist we'll go to our favorite podcast we'll go to our favorite whatever it is but not to Christ but let not your hearts be troubled Jesus said come to me and ye shall find rest why are we troubled because we're going somewhere else besides Christ because even you can be in the most difficult storm in your life yeah you can still experience rest there have we experienced that before it's just a supernatural thing why am I feeling this piece there's no way I should feel that but there's a calm in that storm because you're going to Christ with the troubles amen in the uh in the church age book we'll be reading some from the smyrnan church age and looking at um brother Brands can be emphasizing that the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's that's part of being born again and it's important to realize that God is sovereign and he's going to meet each person he'll meet each one of us as he chooses and we can have a desire God I want you to meet me just like this and if you meet me like this then I'll know that I've had the Holy Spirit but that kind of puts us on the throne and telling God how he needs to come to us and there's a situation is actually the reverse where we come to Christ and however he wants to come to us that's a that's up to him he's Sovereign he meets as he chooses and and the church age book about the part of the slides here I'm gonna pick up this is on page 157. he's talking about the Holy Spirit and he says now before we leave this subject I want to make myself very clear on what the baptism of the Holy Ghost is according to the word he said it's not according to me it's not according to you it has to be according to thus saith the Lord or we're falsely LED amen he says to begin with you'll notice in my meetings when I finished preaching an Evangelistic service or some teaching message I cast the net and invite a response from the people I asked him to come forward and receive the Holy Spirit everybody in the audience is hearing the same words come forward and receive the Holy Spirit but to some people they're hearing it one way people are hearing it a different way and how that's being translated affects what's being done he says my Pentecostal friends upon hearing me say this and invite people to come up and receive the Holy Spirit they they think I'm inviting people that come forward to be baptized with the Holy Ghost because they're already born again so when I invite those who are spirits filled to come and deal with those who've answered the invitation to receive the spirit these dear ones search forward and deal with the people in such manner as to encourage them to yield to God and believe to speak in tongues and this has caused a great deal of confusion and I want to tell you exactly what I mean I mean for The Sinner to come forward and be born again which is to be baptized into the body of Christ by the Holy Ghost and then you've got somebody dealing with them trying to get them to a certain experience that's actually bypassing what they need and he said I just want them to come forward be born again and they should be um and be born again which is be baptized in the body of Christ by the Holy Ghost which is exactly what took place at Pentecost when the church was launched in other words to be born of the spirit is to be truly baptized with the Holy Ghost it's one and the same think back to the day of Pentecost Peter's there preaching repent be baptized all of you in your name of the Holy Spirit you receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the spirit Falls it was that simple repent be baptized you receive the gift of the Holy Ghost it was that simple every time it happened to the book of Acts repent be baptized they received the gifts of the holy spirit period there was nothing else involved and we can we can brother bread I'm saying it's all one and the same experience let me see I don't want to go too fast here sorry at the top of Page Three I didn't have everything on there um I should bother page two these directions came as a direct answer from Peter relative to what had actually happened at Pentecost what came to pass was that God according to Joel was pouring out the promised Holy Spirit upon All Flesh he wasn't poured out before that time or given before that time this was it but this was to come from now on by repenting being baptized in the name of the Jesus Christ and then God was Duty bound to fill the ones who came he's Duty bound to fill the ones with came you you step forward and do what Christ has asked you to do he's Duty bound he will fulfill this word Peter and then any of the Apostles never said you must be born again and then be filled with the Holy Spirit he didn't say that it could be come full repent be baptized you shall be filled with the gift of the Holy Spirit and we think of it sometimes as multiple experiences because we're humans but because we thank God something happened with me at this particular meeting and then I go on and something else happens to another meeting and then something else happens at another meeting we're Bound by time and that's just that's how we see things but to God that's outside of time to God starts working in their lives it's all one experience to God and we think I'm close to God when I feel this presence there in the meeting and when they go away I'm at work or I'm at home I'm further away from God but no we're still walking with God it's all part of the same spiritual walk with God you can be walking with God anywhere you're at it's all the same thing and then John 8 31 I don't have this in the in the slides but Jesus said to the Jews who believed on him if ye continue in my word then you're my disciples indeed you believe Keep On Believing it's all the same experience God's going to do it you're my disciples and all you have to do is believe you step out in faith and keep out on stepping out in faith and keep on walking with him he's going to fulfill it you don't have to wonder do I have to do I have to be special perfect a certain way just keep walking that's all there is to it that's simple now some of us like to I know we like to but we tend to approach our walk with God as in a sort of a checklist mentality okay I've repented check I've been baptized check and then now I'm ready for the spirit so I haven't and let me think okay I'll pray longer I'll pray longer check oh fast some check and before long we're doing these good things we have the attitude by praying longer I'm getting God's arm I'm twisting it twist until he says Uncle okay okay I'll give you the holy spirit because you finally prayed long enough that's not the relationship that God has with us that's not the relationship that we have with our children or that our parents should have with us we're just seeking God that's all that it is so there is no checklist mentality my brother Branham says the apostolic way God had no set rule when I saw this quote the first I said whoa hold up no set rule Acts 2 38 to set rule you got to repent got to be baptized and then you'll to me that was a set rule but you know what God's Sovereign Peter Cornelius never got baptized but he received the gift of the Holy Spirit and I think for God that was God showing to Peter Cornelius the Gentiles good enough for me he better be good enough for you now Peter he was doing away with all of Peter's judaistic checklists and God loves to do away with our checklist also when the heart's hungry he'll give you what you're hungry for and the devil loves to give us all kinds of junk food to say our hunger but if we keep hungering keep continuing you know if you if you keep following a diet it's going to have an effect on you how hard is to keep following that diet but if we continue in his word it's going to have an effect on us if you want the Holy Ghost it can fall on you right now hold up it can't be that simple it can't no it is that simple when you want to come to God God wants to fill us more than a week you can even imagine being filled we can't how can how can the child comprehend the love that his or her parent has for her there's no way that the child can understand what it means for a parent to love them no way we can't imagine how much God loved us how much God wants to bless us and do good for us it's we're so separate from we we can't have that imagination but God wants it that much so there's no checklist mentality there is a promise blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled so if you haven't been filled yet and you're just hungering and thirsting you're already blessed hungering and thirsting is a great blessing because how many people out in the world aren't hungering and thirsting after God to have a hunger for God that's the great one of the greatest things in life to hunger for God that is not something to be taken for granted in the days of Moses Noah God said my spirit will not always strive with man so that God is striving and pulling Upon Our Hearts that's a great thing because there's no guarantee that'll go forever it's a wonderful thing but there's a promise you're blessed because you're hungering and thirsting for God because you shall be filled not because of the work that you've done not because of how good you've been how hard you've prayed how much you've fasted not because of that because God loves you it is his promise and he'll fulfill it Satan loves confusion though confusion robs us of blessings of what God has already done for us Satan doesn't want us to have this glorious experience looking out of her God's Great creation and climbing up the rocks to to meet God up and he doesn't want us to have this glorious experience but by confusing us he makes this what God intends his glorious journey into this Cliffhanger experience confusion robbers of blessings of what God has already done for us you can remember an experience with God you might have been God just for the working there in your life and you feel so close to God you're like man God am I in this child he loves me so much and then you get away from that and you start thinking man do I have the Holy Spirit or not does the Lord really love me or have I have I sinned away my day of Grace we have those kinds of questions sometimes what's the devil doing there he's confusing us to take away what God's already done for us because he touched our hearts there if he began working in our hearts he's the author he's the finisher a lot of us husbands might leave home projects half done God doesn't he finishes his own projects he's not going to leave us hanging there wondering is it going to happen or not he's it's going to get done it's gonna get done he's the author and the finisher we can rest in that confusion Rob this of what God is of enjoying what God's already done for us so if we notice confusion in our life God is not the author of it Satan is the author of any confusion in her life and if we're getting confused go back to the basics what's the most frequently told Bible story in the book of throughout the Old Testament the story of Israel coming out of Egypt that's made into songs sung again and again and again and again why so that it stays in their memory so it's imprinted that we are God's chosen people he did so much to draw us out of Egypt he preserved us the Wilderness In Spite of Ourselves and it's told again and again and again and again and we should do that same kind of thing with our kids sing Jesus loves me this I know why so it gets in their mind it stays in their mind they'll forget all kinds of things but get it in their mind so they know Jesus does love me he has a plan for my life so that's that's that's there and that we can forget our own testimony sometimes I actually remember going down to Louisiana Camp God touched my life as a 13 year old three or four years down the road I was getting discouraged and commands anything ever happened and I did an amazing thing I actually talked to my dad that's really hard for teenagers to do right and dads could say hey I can tell you one thing rap you went down to that camp but you came back somebody different and I'd forgotten that how often do we forget our own testimony when when the children in the Old Testament as the children of Israel are going through things if God met Abraham Isaac or Jacob and he did something for him they made an altar of stones there why says they're going back they'll see that hey look there's an altar oh I remember what God did this is Bethel hey boys this is where I spent all night I couldn't sleep and I finally got to sleep and I got this dream of this ladder Angels going up and down up and down and I put this all here so I wouldn't forget about it so when God does something in their lives make a big altar so that we can be reminded of it and I've got in the back of my Bible here I've got a couple sticky notes of dated what God's done for me I can remember this one was this is Wednesday July 11 2001 and this person was I want victory in this area of my life I want to be encouraged not discouraged by stronger Christians think why could you be discouraged by stronger Christians because you look at it man you could never be like that and if I've got to be like that to get the gift of the Holy Ghost I'm a lost cause but you know what I put that there this is the request and then put on the back of it I think God's really done this for me absolutely done it for me and this is my little altar of stones because it reminds you what God's done for you so I don't know if you put something on your mirror wherever there and there in your car if God's done something for you if he's right right in your Bible a day so then you're building this little altar as you're reading oh yeah God did something for me he is author of my faith he's continuing the story he's he's not the fixed man that stops he's continuing and I'm still in this experience with God he hasn't stopped amen now the spiritual nature of the new birth makes it difficult for us to pin the particulars down we'd love to be able to say I know exactly on this date this time the Holy Spirit came into my life sometimes that's possible I can remember there was a teenager we were in um little youth group and the youth leader asked how many of you are able to remember the date and time when God filled your Holy Spirit and I remember a couple of them raised their hands like wow these are really super spiritual young people but you know what those ones who were so confident this day this time God did something for me they're gone now they're completely out in the world you wouldn't it's amazing gone and maybe they were looking more I finally achieved this and then you're doing it based upon your own works and you're seeking this experience and you're seeking The Experience instead of actually seeking Christ and we get the ex the devil left I don't know how the this is how it happened we get the experience but we don't continue on because I think I just got the experience all I have to have but the Christ says no I want you want me keep on going chase after me don't stop with the experience go after me continue in my word follow after me that's what it's all about don't stop whenever you've got this particular Revelation or this particular experience this would ever keep on with God keep on walking with him that's what it's all about not anything this that or other amen it's a spiritual experience Supernatural experience defies full explanation leave it that way John 3 8 says the wind blows where it listeth you hear the sound thereof but you can't tell where it's coming from or where it's going so is everyone that's born of the spirit that's a description of the new birth it happens you can see the wind going back and forth little kids will observe it Dad where's the wind come from kids can ask some good questions comes from the Lord how's the New Birth come from what do you have to do to get it just follow the lord repent and be baptized and God will take care of it that wind will come amen brother Branham quotes this and he speaks the following you don't know where it comes from where it's been where it's going where is that wind but you know one thing where it's going to take you wherever it come from it doesn't matter but it'll take you back with it that's the important thing we think if I know how I got this where that wind came from that wind came because I did this and I did this then I approached God this way and I finally did this long enough and then all that wind came we're saying we know where it came from but no that wind came from a sovereign Act of God we can't do any other way I might have told this story before I can remember a Young Guy's young men's bible study prayer meeting was just a spontaneous thing years back I was probably 16 17 years old remember the car I drove it was two-tone old 1984 I think it was your aunt's car by the time that I bought off of him there was an old car but I uh I met up with John but the John Brooks's mothers and we had a little prayer meeting in the basement of his parents house they it was just still being worked on just got together and we started praying and it was just a sovereign thing the Holy One brother started oh started in prayer and then we just one brother praise and the spirit of prayer just came down that goes from one brother to another brother to another brother we were there for I don't know how long it was but it was just a sovereign Act of God a couple weeks later hey guys let's get together for a prayer meeting so we get to send the same Brothers together I'm thinking okay this brother opened in prayer last time it worked out really good we'll ask the same breath of the opening prayer this time and it was as flat as anything because we tried to say we know where it came from came because we did this this this and this that's not how spiritual experiences work it's Sovereign just get together and like yes we want to be with God we don't but he planned it you can't plan that spiritual experience you just get together with an open heart hunger for God and who knows what will happen but we only know one thing wherever it came from it doesn't matter however it got there it doesn't matter but it didn't depend on us came from God but it'll take you right back with it I love this quote I don't know the mechanics of the Holy Ghost for the Branham said but I know it fell on me I can't tell the mechanics of it but I know the blessings of it that's all I care to know about it is the blessings of the Holy Ghost and mechanics he works them that's his secret I read this quote over the summer said wow that's beautiful we all want to figure out the mechanics so we can give the handbook here's how you receive the Holy Ghost brother follow these mechanics that's not how it works it's his secret we just go trust relax in him amen sometimes we get so focused on trying to figure out the mechanics that we miss the forest for the trees I tried to figure out the particulars of our own experience that were the keys we think man this is exactly what it was and we miss what God actually was doing there and um First John 3 7 talks about how there were three that bear record in heaven the father of the word the Holy Ghost these three are one there's three that bear with this Nerf the spirit the word and the blood and these three agree in one and brother Bram uses us to talk about how the natural birth and the spiritual birth go in parallel water blood spirit that's how it is naturally and spiritually and I think about this uh this little child does he remember being born and being held like a biased mother like this no he doesn't it would be really strange if he becomes a teenager gets to be about 18 19 20 years old and he wants to go find out was I really born I want to go find out that birth certificate I want to know where it really happened what time it actually happened who was the doctor who signed it who was the nurse present that'd be really really weird but you know what that's what we sometimes do we want to pry into this Supernatural experience so much that we almost destroy the supernatural experience what this child doesn't need to have physical proof he's alive he's alive that's enough and our inability to remember details of our physical birth doesn't alter the fact of our birth our inability to understand when how we were spiritually Born Again doesn't alter the fact that we've been born again has God changed our hearts yes are we different than what we used to be yes relax enjoy it you don't trying to understand every single thing is just as ridiculous as this little baby growing up I want to see my birth certificate to know that I'm alive take your pulse to have a desire for God yes you're alive God's going to work on you because that desire for God you weren't born with it I mean that God put into you that's a real special special thing amen brother Branham says water blood spirit same thing just as you go along the three elements that those are the three elements that take you back into the body like it brings from your natural birth it types your spiritual birth the baby's born the first things water next blood that's in life that's the way you come into the kingdom of God the same way do you have a physical do you have a natural desire for God no but do you are you feeling a desire for God that's a supernatural thing to take your pulse I'm alive enjoy the enjoy the journey from there on out brother Paul and different other brothers have been telling in the last year or so the story of a man who came to brother Brandon one day he sees this tract is there a way to be saved and he picks up the tracks and he just starts reading it and reading it and reading it and it grips him and he prays a simple prayer of faith and then he goes on his journey but somewhere along the journey some confusion came along and he came to brother Branham come sits on this poor brother Branham I was once a businessman I've spent years trying to get saved that might sound a little bit like us I've spent years trying to get the Holy Spirit I spent years trying to do whatever um and he was telling all of his trouble so his wife went down and got the spirit but he couldn't get the spirit and here we have it says what do you mean brother he told me where he was from he expressed himself and they said are you trying to get saved he says yes I'm trying to get saved I said the Lord wants and he says I believe I've crossed the line brother Brandon where you can't get saved anymore so oh I don't know about that only tells the story I went to my brother Billy Graham's meetings a famous preacher and he told me to do this and I went to the inquiry room and had a meeting we prayed together and something then nothing happened after that they said it was safe but nothing happened then they went over to another the free methodists and they said you just got to get Sanctified and experience with God and I got happy enough so I could shout and but you know what I didn't feel like I still didn't have it they went to Brother Oral Roberts meetings and they said I spoke with tongues and but but the Branham I still ain't got it he says and well brother Brandon says here I took the liberty here to to color code the conversation the Green's going to be brother Branham speaking and blue is going to be the brother speaking back to him he says my brother the only thing you're just confused and I said the confusion is one of the key key strategies of the devil to take away the blessings of a God that's already done for you and we're going to see it happening here you're just confused I want to ask you something did you always love the Lord Jesus and he says well I belong to the Pentecostal church but I just went there and says well what happened that you change your mind all at once you grew up in the Pentecostal church but I just I just went there wasn't anything personal and brother Brandon Maxwell why did you change your mind he says well one day I was coming in for making a sale out in the yard and I happened to reach in my pocket and somebody had given me a little old tract and I sat down in the office and began to read distracting the awful ass feeling come over me that I ought to get right with God and I've been searching ever since and the brother bam stops and says I want to ask you something when this feeling came over you you'd never been able to get out of it no I haven't he says well that's when you received Christ it doesn't mean raising up your hands that's all right shouting speaking in tongues all these demonstrations that's attributes that follows this but first is to receive Christ he thought he had to have this this this or the other thing to receive Christ but that desire that's the all telling that's your spiritual pulse is that desire still there they asked them brother Brandon I've been saved all the time sure look do you love him with all my heart well one time you didn't love him that's right and now you do love them that's the truth well you had them all the time it's simple you you hear the call however that call is you respond to it you repent the baptized you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost period period we think all these other things have to happen in between and sometimes they might but they don't have to repent you're hungering for it God will give it to you period And when they you well you had them all the time and then he jumped off the porch began crying holding me his arms oh god I've been a Christian all these years but you see the thing of it was he wasn't straightened out in the beginning and here's how a wrong conception or a wrong understanding of how God works man you might have started with God and he and you you had a supernatural experience you were born again the devil has you deceived for years thinking you're not and you're just thinking oh my I hope I'm good enough for God the devil's telling you're not a wild man but you just keep right on going you keep right on going and you keep running going because your desire is so strong it pushes back against all those lies you keep pushing back pushing back but he's with you all the time you already had that the devil's making a White Knuckle experience that doesn't have to be that way we can rest in the Holy Spirit and of course some folks can hear this say my then you can just make Grace disgrace because you don't have to do anything you have to seek after God or anything but I tell you if you've got a real desire after God you're going to run after him and pursue him you're not going to desire anything else you're not going to desire to go out in the world and maintain a confession you might do something wrong but you desire so bad to get right back in the community with them that's the strong spiritual pulse that there is that desire you're going to fail but you know when the Christian Falls a Christian always going to fall forward because you're going to get back up and you're still making progress you can't fall away you'll fall forward amen every experience every Christian's experience can be different I just want to talk about that for a few minutes here second Corinthians 10 12 says they measure themselves by themselves comparing themselves among themselves they are not wise but that's what so many of us do and I can remember I've you might have told me I've told you before I'm in youth meeting sitting next to my best friend and he's just raising his hands and worshiping God tears streaming down his face like Niagara Falls I think man he's so spiritual I'm just squeezing my eyes as hard as I can and I can't get anything to come out of my eyes like man I'm a hopeless case but that's just different how we're made it doesn't mean anything else well God man looked on the outward appearance we look on that word appearance say my how many ounces of Tears did you let I didn't let that much I'm that much further from God but God looked at our hearts and that's the most important things when we compare each other with each other we make it a carnal race and that's not a wise thing at all I can remember reading in the message things are to be for the first time I was probably uh 20 21 years old I'm reading this as the first time and it was such a blessing it was really freeing and liberating just seeing how God is all kinds he's a god of variety that's what it says he's a god of variety and he made all of you in a variety some men are real blusterous some are real dogmatic others are fine others are kind and they just find all different kinds of people and in his kingdom the dogmatic people are in his kingdom the blusterous people are in his people are in his kingdom he doesn't say the blusterous person's kind he doesn't say the dogmatic person's fine but he says God makes him all a different way and they're all in his kingdom and when I read this man that just helps me relax and it says uh look at Saint Peter and judge him by Andrew this is on page six see Andrew is that prayer Warrior he just stayed on his knees all the time whereas Peter fell asleep in the Garden of Gethsemane the Apostle Peter is one of those fire brands that just preached the house down Andrew you only see him a couple of times he brings the boy with the with the Five Loaves two fishes to Jesus he brings another friend to Jesus another friend of Jesus he's just really good at bringing individuals to Jesus that Peter's out there and he's just he's just like he is his name's on the advertisement for special meetings everyone's right there everyone's there because it's going to be a special experience Andrew doesn't get special meetings he brings in one by one Andrew didn't have Andrew wasn't the one who multiplied the loaves he just brought the one to Jesus he's just this guy in the background but he's still on his kingdom Paul was more scholarly like I can imagine Peter and Paul to have complexes about each other because Paul wasn't a good speaker and he was he was he wasn't comfortable in front of people but I think Peter you give him an audience he'd just come alive Paul likes you really carefully think things through and Peter's reading he said man Paul he writes things that are really hard to be understood and he might have been tempted to say Paul he's just an intellectual he might have been tempted to say that but he says they're all in his kingdom see Moses wrote the first four books of the Old Testament he wrote the first five books actually he wrote the Old Testament the rest of it was the laws King so forth someone with the prophets Moses wrote the law the different books of the Bible and then it goes on and on Paul rewrites much of the New Testament Matthew Mark Luke and John Paul separates law and Grace puts it into place but he's using such a variety of different people to do this that's a beautiful thing he does the same thing today we don't we can just be at rest in the way God made us whether we're dogmatic or blusterous or kind or find we don't have to change ourselves we just have to die to self and God will use whatever nature he put in this into his glory and that'll be the expression of Christ that only you can express and we can just rest in that the important thing is that the Holy Spirit works in your life it doesn't matter what kind of personality we have or don't have the important thing is the holy spirit works in your life just leave the how up to him so what is the uh the evidence of the holy spirit it's not seeking this thing that thing this or that experience it's just continuing with them are we just going to continue with him and um in the Book of Revelation every single Church age ends with the hath and ear to hear Let Them hear what the spirit saath to the churches and on page 183 here um let me find it it says um I want you to notice very carefully that Jesus did not say that the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost was speaking in tongues interpreting prophesying shouting dancing he said the evidence would be that you would be in the truth you would be in the word of God for your age evidence has to do with receiving the word the evidence of a Spirit-filled Christian believer is not to produce the truth but to receive the truth to believe and Obey it the spirit gives the word if you have the spirit you'll hear the word for your age and just continue in it and I like that statement the EV the the evidence of the Spirit-filled Christian believer is not to produce the truth to live a certain life that is so Flawless or whatever this it's not producing the truth it's to receive the truth Jesus said my sheep hear my voice that's the indication who is sheep are he didn't say my sheep produced the best quality wool that's how I know they're my she didn't say that he said my sheep hear my voice that's the important thing doesn't my sheep have particular bad no just all this it's not what they should produce it's what the sheep hear that's the evidence of being a real Spirit-filled believer so going on the evidence being that you receive the word for your age and continue in that John 14 26 the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send into my name he shall teach you all things the holy spirit will teach all things and if you receive the Holy Spirit you're going to be receiving what he's teaching that's the that's an Evidence of that Revelation 2 7 he that hasn't here let him hear and then on page 153 the evidence is hearing what the spirit says and it's really interesting if you look at the seven if you look up fast forward to the seventh Church age delayed the CN age this is the only age that's talking saying I am this I am that I am rich and increased with Goods I have needed nothing it's the only age that's talking the evidence isn't how much we're speaking how much we're producing the evidence is just hearing and receiving the truth the spirit's talking the spirit's teaching that's what Jesus said would come now when we hear this evidence of the holy spirit is receiving the word for your age like man that means I've got to understand everything and that can be like a really high high um barrier to overcome and Jesus said in Matthew 13 blessed are your eyes for they see in your ears for they hear and this is after Jesus is going into The Parables of the Kingdom like The Parables of the seed the sower different ones like this and I can imagine the disciples when they when he says this Bluster your eyes or they see your ears for they say Yes man we feel special because we hear we know this is the one we're feeling really special and super but as You Follow The Parables Jesus tell us the parable of the sower you tell us the parable the tares and um then the crowd goes away they don't get it but you know the disciples don't get it either after Jesus sends the maltes away they're both they're together with them in the house in the privacy of the house they feel able to be open enough I say Jesus we didn't get it could you explain the parable of the tears of the field at first thinking yes we know it we're the people we know we have ears here is just seeing it at the end of the day it all went over my head Jesus does that mean I don't have eyes to see in the ears to hear and it would feel like if I don't understand what the preacher is saying if I don't understand what brother Brandon's saying how can I ever make it we the devil will tell us that that's the disciples we're experiencing here but Jesus explained it to them and you know what what's different between these disciples who didn't understand it and the multitudes who didn't understand it the disciples stayed the multitude heard it that what in the world is he saying let's go home the disciples heard us says what in the world is he saying and it just couldn't get out of their ears they couldn't get what does he say what does he mean by this there's something there they might not really see but they see that there's something to see and I just like this this this picture here what do you see here I looked at it as man I see something but it's a kind of a strange picture what do you see here I see trees I see a couple little Huts I see some birds flying over but then somebody's gonna tell you there's more to it than that Gabby sees it do you see an elephant yeah you see there's there's an elephant there when you see there's no there's something more than you look at it you look at oh man they're my oh and you as soon as you know there's something more to be seen to see there do you see it Gideon Gideon doesn't see it yet you got to pray for Gideon he didn't get it yet no he uh yeah got those little pieces of fence between the Huts those are the those are the feet the birds are the back oh good Brandon's gonna explain the the space between the first tree and the and the first time that's that's the trunk but this is like what Jesus is telling the disciples he's telling these Parables say there's something more that we see here there's something more to see and they go they're walking that I just can't see it I just can't see it but they can't get it out of their hands they can't get out of their eyes till they have the actions explain to them other people says this is baloney throw it away and walk away why because there's nothing on the inside blessed are your eyes though for you see and if you don't see it yet Gideon you will okay but that's how it is we might feel like things go over our head that's okay you're still here hang with it it'll be fine because you see that there's something to see and in God's time he'll show it to you and until then yes relax because you can just relax and enjoy the journey it's not like oh I got White Knuckles I can't get I can't make until I can explain what the seventh seal is it's a lost cause I must not be it don't worry it's intriguing God will give it to you in his time and we can just relax and God will deal with each one of us individually and kind of want to close with uh with this we don't want to impersonate somebody else's experience brother Brandon toward the end of his discussion in the smyrnian church he asks what has caused all of this misunderstanding and he says the answer is experience we have gone by experience and not by the word I did that with my with that little brother's prayer meeting I was involved with and for the second prayer meeting I went by experience I said if you want the blessing ask Brother David to open with prayer Brother David opens with prayer it's going to happen I'm going by experience and it's going to be disappointing and confusing the second time it doesn't happen that's how we that's how the confusion happens away with experience as you're measuring line there's only one Plumb line one rod and that's the word watch carefully and get this Peter said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost Paul said if you receive the Holy Ghost since he believed this is the whole of our problem right here people repent of their sins they get baptized in the water but they don't go on and receive the Holy Ghost you believe unto receiving the spirit Believing on Jesus is the step in the right direction and then they just stop I've got it but Jesus says keep it continueth in my word as my disciple indeed I'm not after an experience of being wet in the water and coming out and everybody applaud and pray with me I'm not seeking the experience I mean after an emotional experience at the altar though I love that I'm pursuing Jesus these things are steps along the way I just keep on walking walking walking I pursue him and nothing else and then I don't have to grasp and hold on to any experience I'm grasping holding on to him when we impersonate somebody else's experience and then impersonates a strong word sound like we're doing something bad we don't mean to that when we're trying to get something that somebody else has been blessed with we think we've got to have that too we can be pushing ourselves into something that's a sovereign work of God and our well-intended efforts can frustrate the grace of God last year we closed our our school year with a pretty interesting Chapel service done by Brother Richard grills from down in Bluffton and here he had he had a bunch of eggs and he had kids coming up and he said what do you think is going to happen this kid puts this egg up against his head what's going to happen What will be the result what'll be the it'll it is interesting because every and it was for this he had to get the seniors first the seniors had to come up and hit themselves in the head and the point was we can say we think what we know is going to happen but we should always say the Lord will this or that could happen with the Lord's will we can't be the produced perspective of the future because we don't know maybe it's a hard-boiled egg that's been smuggled there maybe the person gets really nervous so nervous that they get all sweaty palms and egg slips and it just doesn't work out the way they thought maybe they just hit really hard maybe they don't we don't know what's going to happen and he was teaching in that way as I watched we had like a dozen kids coming up there and I have a little video of little Marcus here um he had he had a blast I just wanna um there's a little here's Marcus uh I'm going to play a short video clip but the the visuals it's important here Marcus can't wait his hands on that egg is it gonna happen now what happens when brother Marcus with the egg just say that again he couldn't wait no I can't wait to get the egg and he gets the egg and man he just goes at it [Applause] got up there they had a blast doing it now one of the four seniors um wouldn't do it and there was just kind of like um not gonna go there um one of the four seniors wouldn't do it and they said look I'll volunteer Mr cook I got volunteered to go up and they sure enough they got a kick out of seeing me up there I'm looking at what is this gonna how am I going to get out of this but yeah I I had you had to be a good sport and I did it as well oh I got to see the real thing here there we go but you know what people have different experiences the first guy was a little bit nervous he's kind of on his head but you know it cracked and got yoke on them he had an experience with the egg there was no doubt about it but one guy he really got into it and this was the experiences just that it won the day for sure it went all over the place I was afraid I was going to clean off my American flag I mean he had this thing down he'd been he said please follow me calling me I want to do this and he is he's having a blaster but I watched all these kids doing this I thought man you know what this is everybody wants to have the same egg experience I woke it up I want to have that experience just like that kid had and the next kid who followed him wanted to do it but it didn't work out that way I think he had his finger spread too far I'll probably have to egg a certain way I had the mechanics down by the end of it but you know what only one person had this experience where this went everywhere carpet everywhere we have graduation that next day we had to clean everything up because this kid had an experience at this point from Dan to Beersheba the egg and think I want that experience but everybody had their own experience with the egg I would have loved to bring the eggs here but I wasn't brave enough but you know when we come to God each one of us are going to have our own experience with God some of us might be calm cool and collected we just say I mean it's a big step of faith we just want to get the egg in their hands we just step up to the altar we just and the Egg just cracks open a little bit but we get God on us we get it's a little bitty thing but you know what God worked on us we hadn't experience with the egg we had an experience with God but somebody else going to get up there he's gonna whack and they'll just go all over the church does that mean that they're more spiritual it does not that's just how God works every of us all of us are going to have our own experience with God that's how God designed it don't copy somebody else's experience don't try to get somebody else's experience just get that egg in your hand and go whack and whatever happens rejoice in it you'll have the same smile on it Levi had that Marcus had it's just great hit a great experience that's the kind of experience with God we want to have listen whatever happens happens and I love God and God loves me I'm gonna go forward that's what God wants for us Galatians 2 20. do I have that here I do Paul says I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet that I but Christ liveth in me and the life I now live in the flesh it's not my own life I live it by the faith of the Son of God it's not even our faith it's the faith of the Son of God faith is a gift who loved me and gave himself for me I don't frustrate the grace of God I frustrate the grace of God when I try to have the same experience the brother Jason had when I try to have the same experience the brother Michael had and I had the same experience that somebody else said then I'm frustrating the grace of God because if righteousness come by the law Christ is dead in vain if we think we have to do this this or this to purchase the goodness of God we'll hear the same thing that Peter said to Simon you and your money away with you it's a gift just enjoy the gift on the bottom of page seven on top of page eight I've got different things that brother Brandon said I'm gonna close here were by the time but he's talking different people who are approaching him in the prayer line the first one uh this is and when their eyes were open they knew him he says now just believe with all your heart don't doubt don't doubt just have faith in God let's start looking on this side over here somewhere somebody somebody just look you have to stand around here all kinds of belief don't don't press at it so you jump over the top of it I can imagine somebody thinking that but try to believe as hard as I can he says don't press at it you jump over the top of it it's it's it's part of you just relax yourself and say well sure it's the word I believe it just relax yourself and that's how God comes to you and the message greater than solemnness here he says your faith is unconscious don't press now or jump you jump away from it it's right with you just relax yourself and believe just believe now have faith sometimes your faith is unconscious you have it and you don't know it and there's different places where he he calls somebody out and he says my am I you there yes you with the green shirt on and and and and and the tie you've been praying God's heard your prayer and he says I'm doing this is that shocked you when I called you out there and you would think if somebody's believing they're expecting to be called out but faith is unconscious and then when they're called out they're actually surprised man that's not expecting Faith No it is Faith is just an unconscious thing we don't always realize how it works or when it works but lastly the new birth doesn't depend upon us it's all upon what Christ did at Calvary for us and upon the seed of God that sown within us without those things it's it's impossible and just want to um in the on page eight there's a quote from the spring and church age he says now we're coming to a conclusion musicians can come as the Eternal logos God was manifest in the son and Jesus to win throughout all the fullness of the godhead bodily the Eternal Father one the Eternal one was the father manifest In the Flesh of Jesus this goes on is that in that same way when the spirit is Manifest in flesh when those Eternal thoughts are maniflashed in flesh those are the sons of God as we're called he says we did not come become seed when we were born again we were seed and that's why we were born again for only the elect can be reborn and this comes right from the scripture acts 13 48 when the Gentiles heard the preaching they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed it's not that they were believed that they believed and thin were ordained because they believed no they were ordained and that's the only reason why they could believe so it's not a White Knuckle experience if we're experiencing White Knuckles in our walk with God we're listening to the devil too much the Christian life that God has for us is where we can just relax and what God has already done for us amen let's pray Heavenly Father I thank you Lord for what you have done for us I thank you Lord for how you called and and pulled on our hearts father Lord we could look back in our lives and how things could have been different in so many ways at different times but yet you were the one who kept us all the time and we're thankful for that oh God and Lord I just pray that if if as we've listened this evening and that we've seen sometimes we have we we recognize I've been seeking God by my own works and not by Faith Lord forgive us for that we don't want to frustrate the grace of God Lord help us each one of us to relax to open up and so we can just see what you've done us and we just continue walking I don't care Lord when it happens what happens but that happens I'm just going to keep on walking I'm not be seeking anything else but you I'm you are the one I want Lord to boil you down to a certain experience or through emotional Revelation or or a certain set of perfection that's so that's so so so so cheap I just I want you Lord Lord I pray that you'd help us to run that race that you would energize us each step of the way oh God I pray that you would encourage each one in their walk lord lord lord I pray you give them peace and rest and Assurance oh God in Jesus Christ's name
