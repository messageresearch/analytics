========================================
by tonight so um there's a short testimony before i kind of get into mine but it's a sister actually brother timothy preached friday night he talked about the chains being broken amen do you believe that with christ our chains are broken forever amen it's eternal breaking amen you believe that tonight amen say amen amen you believe it praise god amen so he we get done with the service and him and ronnie long um go out in the office and um he uh kind of talking and the spirit actually if i got the story right the spirit kind of falls right into that room right there and um he um he says to ronnie and they're about actually about to leave the office into the into their cabin going to the cart into the cabin back so he can rest my brother timothy pruitt was going to rest there and something stopped him right before he leaves the building he can just feel this pole and there's this says he says to brother ronnie i've got one more chain to break he has one more chain to break and right there the spirit just fell he said that the it was just such an anointing that the water even was you know the building was shaking it was the water kind of moving and it was just set this power they were just weeping there in the office and he comes back out and uh it was such a proclamation to the young sisters that they are fearfully and one wonderfully made amen that chain was broken so tonight i want to say to all you sisters amen you are fearfully and wonderfully made amen there was specific sisters that got back to them that were battling that in their mind that night and um they they testified of it it's like that was for me amen were fearfully and wonderfully made they had struggles with feeling ugly lord he aren't you glad the lord looks within amen amen he thinks you're beautiful amen amen he looks at amen the beautiful things hallelujah amen he made you there's a reason amen praise the lord amen i want to testify of that amen just a beautiful time first time i was involved with praying for people on a prayer line i was just so encouraged to see the sincere hearts coming through that line i could i couldn't it was just you had you had maybe four or five-year-olds coming through the line and then right behind them you've had 90 year old i mean what a beautiful thing god he speaks to everyone amen hallelujah aren't you glad he speaks to you praise the lord but um it was just a beautiful time in the lord amen i feel so encouraged in my spirit amen i just i mean there's just so many things on my heart that i just want to share and i pray that you'd pull and just back me up if there's something that i say that is a little off then take me for what i mean and not what i say all right you got me take me for what i mean so amen and then my you know my personal prayer this last weekend was god for for god to give me backbone i uh i went went into the prayer line you know spoke to brother wayne about it and the last couple years actually i've been on and off with physical back pain but god's he's um he's been showing me that i need a spiritual backbone i need something strong i need something that will that will uh help me speak up when things are are when the devil's fighting i want i want something that i can speak up to and then call it out for what it is amen so that's my true desire so uh bear with me tonight amen is it good to be in the house of the lord tonight it's good to be in his house let's give the lord a handclap of praise tonight hallelujah praise the lord you may all stand with me let's turn to the scripture tonight first john 5 4 4 and 5 there first john you got me singing that song this means war amen it's good to be on the winning side isn't it amen praise the lord let's let's find it here okay first john 5 i love this here we go for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that jesus is the son of god amen let's uh let's just bow our heads tonight in a word of prayer amen just asking god to lead us in the right direction tonight your heavenly father lord lord i come with my vessel lord tonight lord jesus god wanting you to speak lord not my words lord jesus nothing that i can do god you would you would take over lord jesus and god let this not just be about me lord but god we're in this lord jesus to be fed so we give you the service right now lord jesus feed us tonight god from your throne lord lord from the oldest one here to the youngest one lord let it let it minister to each and every life lord jesus that it may bring forth fruit good fruit lord jesus that's my one desire lord jesus just um bless it lord we give it to you in jesus name amen praise the lord praise god amen you may be seated tonight so i mean this kind of goes along with my whole testimony as far as wanting backbone amen how many want more backbone do you want backbone amen to fend off the enemy amen and all of his tricks amen that's my that's a true desire i feel like i can relate so much to gideon in the bible because uh gideon he felt incapable and he felt like he couldn't do much all of his brothers were around him and he uh he was the small one probably he didn't he was just awkward probably didn't know what to do but amen god can use anything amen amen god can use god can use you amen if you're available amen it took them a little bit amen to finally catch what god was trying to do through him but when he did amen the enemy fell amen enemy came down so so this is a question i asked tonight do you want god to fill every fiber of your being that's my first question tonight do you want him to fill every fiber seems like that's been going on in my heart for a couple weeks as the ministers of speaking you kind of hear it on repeat do god wants to fill every fiber of your being amen that's every door in your life amen he wants to fill every single door amen and there's there's things um so so what i what i say is check your heart see what your true desire is what do you really want i mean you can look up through all your life and say you know there's things i want but what is my true desire what's my goal what's what what do i want right so true desires um check your heart and see if your true desire is for god to feel you completely as we know from the message if there's a call to the deep there's a there's a response from that deep amen amen there's something there that's always going to respond so if you're in a state of stagnant tonight amen there's a deep there's something calling you higher amen out of that amen there's a song that um me and dad know from the gaither vocal band you may have heard it but i'd like to read the lyrics tonight just so we kind of kind of catch my thought here tonight it says waiting there for 38 years it's called the song is called do you want to be well waiting there for 38 years cried so long he ran out of tears just a worn out man looking for a healing hand then one day his chance came along a healing man who who can make him strong and he and he caught his eyes but his question took him by surprise this was his question do you want to be well do you really want to be well are you willing to take up your mat and help yourself do you want to be free really want to be free if you want to be healed and whole you've got to want to be well amen amen every tr have you ever tried to fix yourself and every every time you got up you fell and you wallowed there drowning in your own despair have you gotten used to the chains are you so attached to the pain are you afraid to part then ask them then ask the man for a brand new heart do you want to be well it goes to the chorus it says the bridge that goes there's a better life waiting just for you there's endless open spaces in in the sun hallelujah i just i really want to hit that home tonight do you want to be well just we find ourselves i i'm kind of getting to that story uh tonight of aiken hopefully we can kind of go through joshua chapter 7 tonight but i remember brother isaiah a few weeks ago talking about getting down to business with god amen do you really want god to do something in your life amen do you want change amen do you amen he's uh he's seeking you more than anything he wants that for you amen he wants he there's always see with god god's limitless right he's always has a higher calling for you amen there's never a place where god says all right you're good where you are amen as as when we say that to ourselves that's when we're in the wrong you believe that amen that's when we kind of build up the self-righteousness this pride right that's not what god's looking for i don't believe amen god has never failed to meet a sincere soul that wants change healing deliverance or the holy ghost we have hack we have access to it all there's a bomb in gilead and god is saying balls in your court now balls in your court will you claim the promises he's saying he's asking why he he asked we have all that we need all that we have and especially in this day with the last day's message we have all that we need in the word he's revealed it to us and he asked why why won't you grab it why see i've been there personally when i accept a habit in my life that's probably innocent per se but maybe it's not maybe it's not an innocent habit i uh but because we're human we tend to get this self-righteousness or this pride like we can handle it right and a lot of times this this comes even before even after a big victory in our lives amen pride is probably one of the biggest pitfalls we can get after a big victory amen because that's the where the devil can he can um he can basically you get this pride and you god god will show you god will reveal it to you that you're nothing and he's something amen so i i've personally been there and uh even you know just these couple weeks with things that are in my life and i want to get personal with you tonight just about you know habits on you know this phone here right right here habits that i feel like let's say for me personally and i want to get real down to earth here that like i i would go to bed right and this would be this would have to be playing some sort of video it wasn't anything that was probably damaging my soul or anything but it was just it was just um empty right it but it was something it was something to me like i had i needed that to go to bed and in this generation you'd be surprised that in this day and age i go i i uh i work with nurses and they they tell me that um in this generation i've heard pretty crazy statistics on this as well that they um there's there's this high um ranking of people in the u.s that go to bed to uh true crime right they go to bed to this um they find peace in crazy craziness this is a high statistics i wish i had the high the the statistics on it but even when i'm you know in the in the work here um like there was you know there's a co-worker that was saying it's like i can't get to bed without true crime they can't find peace without it that's delusional that is insanity do you realize where we're living in right now and the only thing the devil wants us to do is be right in there where our minds are mush right and our minds aren't mush by the blood of the lamb our minds are not mush all right praise the lord hallelujah amen he's giving us a new mind amen he made us new creatures in christ praise god that gets me excited hallelujah thank you lord thank you lord so he says balls in your court will you claim your promises i perse um we are human and we tend to get self-righteous just like we can handle it and the devil can use that as a hindrance because as human nature we are habitual right so uh the title for my sermon tonight is removing the hindrances removing the hindrances amen there's nothing more than god wants is for you to live an overcoming life amen amen every single day that's that's why paul says we must die daily amen so he can take over god can take over and that's where the real overcomer is is christ our mighty rock amen praise the lord and if you could pull up that first um if you could pull up that first one there just read this along with me this is the only long quote i have i know sometimes long quotes can be uh you know hard to stay with me but just just bear with me here like in the scriptures found in the book of second kings the first chapter ahab the unruly king of the samaria had died and his son had taken his place and he was an ungodly man just like his father hezekiah and one day when he was walking in his in his porch he fell through the lattice falling to the ground he injured himself and some disease set into his body and then he called called two of his soldiers the temple guards and sent them upon to ukraine ekkran to the temple of biazab and the god of that country which was which was a devil god something like a fortune fortune tellers and he said go and inquire by beelzebub but be uh by the prophets of baal ziba i'm going to come off of this bet i'm am i going to come off of this bed or not so he's asking the god and as they started the angel of the lord come to elijah the tishbite the true prophet of god and told him what was going on and said go stand in the way and and head these men off and he said he said to them it's not there a god is there not a god in israel isn't there a prophet in israel that you can't consult about these matters but do but do you go to beelzebub so we have a re we have a source a man a true source amen but you see what's happening is this this king this king is uh going to he doesn't feel confident in the in the word right he doesn't feel confident in the in the word for his day he uh he's going to something different right because okay we'll get to it and it wasn't because there wasn't a god in israel neither was it because there wasn't a prophet in israel but it was the king's stubbornness and his hatred for the true prophet of israel and this is worse come to worst but i pray if you're at this place tonight cry out to god cry out to god it wasn't because of that god hadn't supplied the remedy god always had has a remedy amen amen it wasn't because that was that he was too stubborn and he didn't like elijah because elijah had predicted all the evil that happened to his father therefore he had created listen to this therefore he had created by the habits of his home to hate the man of god to just despise him and reject him i don't know if you understand how how powerful habits are in our life and here i'm talking about things that i went through as far as thinking that you know these innocent things like a video that i'd watch on my phone aren't affecting me right it's the habits that are destroying me and they can lead to this right one i love this one compromise at a time leads to spiritual death right amen and if you reject the true and living god there's only one other thing you can go go to that's an untrue god or a false god see there's no confidence you find yourself in such a place of of numbness spiritual amnesia that you can't look to god you can't find him anywhere because you're feeling unworthy there's only one other thing you can go to that's an untrue god or a false god right you're finding an artificial satisfaction and it will never last amen that's why people in this world they only can find satisfaction in drinking or smoking right they can only find it there i mean even even at work you know they they talk about you know people that they they like put people down for being alcoholics but then at the same time they they're there themselves they're like but i can't put down the only thing that gives me life and joy in my life they'll talk about that that's why they go to it because you know that's all they have right um it's an untrue false god if this if this people of this nation refuses to serve the true and living god there's only one thing left for them to accept that's a false god next one if there's a true religion of jehovah the people refuse to walk in that religious order then there's only one thing for them to do that's fine the other fault false way to walk in it and how foolish it seems to the mind to the reasonable mind oh my that could reason out why take something false when you can have something true why would man go after the things of the world to satisfy the thirst that's in him when god created that thirst alleluia he's created that thirst for him to thirst after god amen there's something in you before you even thought amen that there was polling and the devil all he wants to do is deceive you amen right from the get-go and he wants to give you something artificial amen aren't you glad we don't we don't have the artificial we have the true alleluia thank you god why would he satisfy it with drinking and gambling and crowsing when there's a peace in joy and longsuffering and goodness and mercy in god oh aren't you glad we have access to all that thank you lord jesus we have access to all of it praise the lord so that was my long quote but i'd like to i'd like for kind of us to do a bible study tonight i'd like to just go through joshua 7 tonight so if you've got your bibles let's go through joshua 7 because it talks about i don't know if you've ever heard them before but it's about brother aiken how many know of brother aiken you guys know of him all right well we'll talk about it amen joshua seven hopefully i don't i should be looking at my time here because i don't all right we're good we are doing good amen yeah the other night we i think it was five five and a half hours we were in service and it felt like maybe 30 minutes so i mean god's time well god doesn't have time amen praise the lord but we will be mindful we know we know uh this is mid-week so so joshua seven so talking about aiken so this is this is just kind of a backstory this is right after jericho right one of their um i mean historic victories right um for the children of israel god fight uh god fought pretty much for them all they did was obey the word amen praise the lord god fought over the city because israel obeyed the word of the word of the lord living according to all of his word nothing nothing can stand up in our way if we do that amen praise the lord we can look at israel and obviously israel is a type of the believer right we all believe that amen recognize so we must recognize this is within right we're recognizing this is all happening within the joshua commission right and israel um is is over jordan right they come into i believe with the joshua commission it's um the holy ghost commission right in uh in canaan right uh the believer this is uh i love this the believer must fight once once we've crossed over jordan right the believer must fight for every inch of land he gets right so your your battle really just started when that holy ghost comes in right hey man you're a sojourner now you don't want any things of the world amen you're a soldier a pilgrim amen we're of another kingdom amen praise the lord hallelujah so we have this holy ghost this holy ghost walk is no picnic by revelation god is revealing the hidden things that satan has covered through the church ages and by god's grace we will overcome and have our full inheritance amen he is restored amen he's restored everything praise the lord so we'll get right into this amen so follow along with me but the children of israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing for aiken the son of karmi and the son of zabdi and the son of zerai and the tribe of judah took of the accursed thing and the anger of the lord was kindled against the children of israel right so we find that aiken here has um i mean you probably know the story but um we find the aiken there's it's it's affecting all of israel right and how how how uh things are going as far as the the battles so um and joshua sent men from jericho to ai which is uh besides bethavin on the east side of bethel and spake unto them saying go up and view the country and the men went up and view viewed ai and they returned to joshua and said unto him let not all the people go up but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite ai and make not all the people to labor that they're for the for they are but a few so there went up there of the people about three thousand men and they fled before the men of ai in the men of a i smote them about thirty and six men for they uh for they chased off them from before the gate and unto uh shiburum i'm like my dad i have trouble with these these names um and smote them in in um going down wherefore the hearts of the people melted and became his water so what you're seeing here is um israel's wondering what's happening right they don't know what's going on because they have the promise right they have what they need but something's going on they're they're wondering what's going on we we can't we can't beat this enemy right and they actually they they don't bring their full army they they're kind of approaching it half-heartedly too um but and joshua ran his clothes and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the lord unto the evening tide and the elders of israel and put dust upon their heads and joshua said alas o lord god wherefore thou ha thou at all brought this people over jordan to deliver us into the hand of the amorites to destroy us so you see uh joshua crying out to god here um i i mean from his from his words he's he's really broken about this would um would to god we we had been content and dwell on the other side of george jordan oh lord what shall i say when israel turneth their backs before their enemies so you see you see joshua crying out and i i'm seeing this kind of as joshua joshua's soul he's crying out to god wondering what's wrong right for them for the canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it and shall pretty much round about us they come all around us and in it and shall cut off our name from the earth and what will thou do unto the great name and i love this what the lord says the lord's like stop wait he says stop he says the lord says unto joshua get thee up stop stop wondering what's going on there's sin in the camp right wherefore elias thou this upon this face so he's saying he's like you kind of need to grow up here there's there's some there's something going on but um there i'm getting i'm getting to it but there there needs to be there needs to be um a cut or a as my title is a remover of hindrance right israel had sinned and they have also transgressed my covenant which i commanded them for they have even taken of the accursed thing and have also stolen and assembled also and they have put it even among their own stuff therefore the children of israel could not stand before the enemies but turn their backs before their enemies because they were a curse neither will i be with you any more except you destroy the curse from among you so i even for my personal testimony you can find yourself in a place of um wondering why you don't feel like you're getting the breakthrough or you're you you don't know why what's going on but there's things in your life that you won't give up right you won't give up those hindrances that you won't give up because um because you know you think you can handle it right amen so um and he says this is what the lord says up sanctify the people and say sanctify yourselves against tomorrow for thus saith the lord god of israel there is an this is bold see this is the thing with god people think and this is the deception of this new modern church that god is so loving and he there's no judgment but this this is god right here right he says there's an accursed thing in the midst of thee oh israel thou can't not stand before thine enemies until you take away the accursed thing from among you right so you're at this place you can't go any farther until that thing's out right you're asking for victory right you want victory so much you come to service every sunday i've got the victory i've got the victory right but then there's things in your life you can't you can't get away from right you can't break off and as brother isaiah said he said he said he said you need the holy ghost to quit smoking no you need to stop right he says no you need to stop right praise god so he says in the morning he says in the morning there therefore you shall be brought according to your tribes and it shall be that the tribe which the lord taketh shall come according to the families thereof and the family which the lord shall take shall come by his by the household and the household which the lord shall take shall come man by man so you see even the the quote we read before the habits of the household right what's going on in the households that are affecting this right it starts in the house it starts in the home it starts with the individual but the individual creates that atmosphere amen and then you you wonder and i i pray that you forgive me but um you wonder why uh kids kids would um you know have a disrespect towards a minister or something like that why it's because the parents right it's because of the attitude in the house right if they're if they're talking about it right then the kids all they're seeing is what the parents are doing amen that's the habit of the house amen i mean if there's gossip going out that kid see the kids all they all they see next time they see that person is is that right all that all they want is just you stay away and there's just this disrespect right so it's the habits of the home and man it's what you say what you profess in the home amen amen i i truly believe um the um you know ministers we are human right we are human we make mistakes amen but never disrespect the gift of god amen in that brother amen he may make the the wildest mistake amen but if there's if there's still a gift amen that can be used and it hasn't gone again gone against script scripture or the word of god then then god can still use him right he can still he can still be available we pray we pray that the lord would correct him and he'd come to himself amen amen that should be our true prayer amen instead of tearing him down and keep tearing him down amen he's losing his he's losing his influence amen amen so we have here so god's getting down to business with this god is not messing around right when it comes to this hindrance in your life he's not he's not messing around in the morning um in the morning therefore um shall we brought according to the tribes and it shall so we read that so he's coming he's coming to the individual he's coming to the households he's come to the tribes right he i mean imagine how many people are in israel right and he's going through all of these he's trying to figure this out right god's down to business right let's be bound down to business amen praise the lord amen and it shall be verse 15 and it shall be that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire and he and all that he hath because he hath transgressed the covenant of the lord and because he hath wrought folly in israel so josiah or sorry so joshua rose up early in the morning and brought israel by their tribes and the tribe of judah was taken and he brought the family of judah and he took the family of zur heights he's all rights and he brought the family of the czar it's man by man and zebda was taken so he's getting down to aiken right and he brought his household man by man and aiken the son of karmy and son of zebdy and son of zarah and the tribe of judah was taken and joshua said unto aiken my son give i pray thee glory to the lord god of israel and make confession unto him and tell me now what that has done hide it not from me and even even with aiken's ending he came he honestly once it once it got down to it he came with an honest heart he said answered aiken answered joshua and said indeed i have sinned he he comes to the conclusion yes i've sinned against the lord of god and thus and thus i have i have done amen are you coming honestly before the throne of god when you when you really want something from god are you coming honestly or are you saying yes i still have these things in my life that i i want to hold on to or are you coming honestly are you saying yes yes lord i'm wrong right and joshua um and aiken answered joshua said indeed i have sinned against the lord god of israel and thus and thus have i done when i saw among the spoils see catch this when i saw among the spoils the goodly babylonish garment amen this the 200 shekels of silver and a wedge of gold of 50 shekels wait when i coveted them lord forgive us then i coveted then i coveted them and took them and behold they're hid in the in the earth in the midst of my tent so he's hiding it right it's been hidden amen deep underneath what you're going through and you don't want to let it go because it's your it's your outlet right it's your so-called outlet that you you feed on constantly you don't you don't want to give it up at all aiken answered when i saw among so here we are verse 21 almost there there hid in the earth in the midst of the tent and the silver un under it so joshua sent messengers and they ran into the tent and this is this is god's judgment here and behold it was hid in his tent and the silver under it and they took him out of the midst of the tent and brought them unto joshua and unto all the children of israel and laid them unto before before the lord and this is this is the in joshua and all of israel with with him took achin and the son of zarah and and the silver and the garment and the wedge of gold and the sun so he's taking all all of it right he's not missing one thing on top of not just what what um you know it can he coveted he's not he's taking everything right he's taking everything amen every every part of that that certain thing that's hindering you he's taking it all right it's a full purge amen full sanctification and this is remember this is this is in your walk of the this is in the joshua commission this is happening during that time so just because we have the holy ghost doesn't mean we have a time of repent we we don't repent anymore or we don't need a purging anymore right so in joshua in all of israel we have it in his asses and his sheep and his tent and all that he had and they brought him unto the valley of acre and joshua said why hast thou troubled us the lord shall trouble thee this day and all and all israel stoned him with stones and burned them with fire after they had stoned them with these stones and they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day so the lord turned from the fierceness of his anger wherefore the name of that place was called the valley of trouble acre unto this day so god's actually naming this place and you know god god turns beauty for ashes right he he turns he sorry am i saying that right beauty for ashes right he turns he takes what the enemy meant for evil right and he he turns it for good amen he takes this and uh he actually names this place trouble because honestly we've we've all had trouble amen we've all had a time when we've been here amen we need to come to that place of trouble so he's taking this and saying this is look back at this and don't look back amen don't look back he's he's as a memorial he calls it valley acre unto this day so so we keep moving on here um aiken had secret things he was hiding in his tent right the proverb says open rebuke is better than secret love amen come honestly before the throne of god amen he coveted he desired babylon a babylonian garment and this as you if you if you can just see it here as israel is a part of the believer so you see that this isn't just two individuals going at it this is this is your battle what you can go through right it's not i'm trying to natural types the spiritual but just bear me bear with me as far as this can be going in an individual you know while that the holy ghost may be inside but this can still be happening that things need to be burned out of your life amen amen and he coveted babylonian garments or money amen it could be something as simple as money i mean you think of brother kyle mentions this you know a lot um as far as um um judas you know what was it what was it that he he wanted he wanted the money right he coveted that money and that was that was his his hindrance right and he didn't get over it right um coveted the things of this world so i say to you tonight get down to business repent the holy ghost-filled life is a content constant repentance there should never be a time when we stop repenting amen amen that doesn't mean we should be down in the dumps all the time like oh i'm unworthy unworthy no we have access to repentance amen god god's given us that right of repentance amen we can repent before him and turn amen have our turning point brother jack was saying a few weeks ago amen brother burley said one time brother billy williams he said and he said one it's okay to make mistakes but make new ones amen don't look back forget the things which are behind and press toward the mark of the higher calling amen there's always a higher calling with god god is limitless amen pull up that next quote there amen uh go to the next one i think it's in yeah and uh some homework for you to do this will go along with what i've spoken but listen to that how can i overcome amen um people wonder like where's their barrier um but amen find it in the word amen find find uh find your resources in the word amen of how you fight amen we sing that song this is how i fight my battles what are we using we're using this amen that's how we fight our battles amen amen neither can you so he's talking about trying to do like trying to live this christian walk and then trying to do it neither can you neither can i but if we'll just hold still and let him do it just yield to him hear lord here i am just just let me be nothing i i yield you put my hand in the right place that's the victory that's overcoming amen it's a complete surrender god's looking for a complete surrender the thing that the thing you have to overcome is yourself right this israel in israel israel had to overcome itself amen in that instance right and define what was wrong and overcome itself itself your idea your thing and surrender yourself to him he overcame for you he knows the way we don't amen amen that's the type of humility we should have amen last thing i i catch from this this whole aiken um it takes a lot of pride to um to hide things right it takes a lot of pride to hold things in and not not expose the devil amen if he's if if honestly if he's working in you right and then um he would have a lot of pride to know that god's know god's word right he knows he knows the law and still take these things these cursed things if we want to know the devil in all of his tricks which that's overcoming knowing the devil in all of his tricks amen amen and if we want to know we must understand that after victories in our life we must never find ourselves with a spirit of pride amen we and i i i can speak for my testimony you you find yourself in this this mountaintop right and uh i don't know if you've i i call it bride pride right i call it bride pride where pretty much um you're up here everyone else is down here right and you've got it and then you start thinking that you can handle things right and god will be sure to correct you on those on those things amen you'll find yourself going through those cycles because you find yourself in a place of pride that um pride cometh before destruction right if we want to know if we want to know the devil in all of his tricks we must understand that our victories in our life um let's see one of one of the great i believe this is one of the greatest pitfalls after an experience with god is because with the experience of the holy ghost um you're a babe in christ right you don't know a lot a whole lot amen and um as far as character goes right and sometimes pride can build up the devil can hit you with some pride where um you know you're up you're right and no one else is amen and you'll you'll just be sitting on your uh on your um you know sitting on your your phone looking at things it's like no i'm good i'm good i can handle it right that's the first thing from the truth amen god wants a full uh full dedication amen so um spirit let's see one of the greatest pitfalls is a christian can have the experience uh with god as a prideful spirit because we think we can handle it but one comp uh but one compromise after the next will lead to spiritual death or stagnancy amen we don't want to be spiritually stagnant amen amen or spiritual amnesia amen but i want to encourage you tonight after we read all this uh joshua 7 i want you to look at this amen once once um once uh this purging is taking place right read with me chapter eight look at me all right now look at me look at the scripture yeah don't don't look at me amen and the lord said unto joshua fear not neither be thou dismayed take all the people of the world with thee and arise go up to aic and i have given unto thee thy hand the king of ai and his and his people in his city and his land amen so once that's taken care of we're ready to go right we're ready to get on the move amen praise god so i just wanted to encourage you there's not this this time of purging and that's it right no we're gaining ground amen every day amen as we keep surrendering keep yielding amen we're on the winning side we're just going to keep moving forward hallelujah praise the lord and thou shalt do to ai and her king as thou just this unto jericho amen so we're now back at god moving taking over right it's where we're not we're not fighting our battles and then god's fighting our battles again amen so cut amen i just want to encourage you if you've got something in your life amen that you feel like that is a it's a habit or it's something that's holding you back from your victory repent cut it out amen look for your victory if you really want do you want to be well amen if you want to see your victory amen just surrender to god he'll give it to you amen and be available be available to to have god correct you amen with this corrective love amen praise the lord i just want to encourage you tonight um recognize that's what we're doing we're recognizing what's going on right knowing the devil and all of his tricks we're acting on the word amen we're figuring this thing out we're uh if there's something in our life we're not trying to figure it out up here but if there's something in our life holding us back from the victory then we're we're acting on the word amen what the word says we're believing and when we removing removing that hindrance and then praise god we move forward with that mighty captain fighting he fights our battles amen just give up and let jesus amen just as he did with jericho amen so is
