this mountain long enough turn turn you northward and command thou the people saying ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau it's interesting that he calls the children of Esau your brethren but if you look back they are related to the children of Esau your brother and the children of Esau which dwell in seir and they shall be afraid of you take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore meddle not with them meddle not with these brothers for I will not give you of their land no not so much as a foot breath because I have given Mount seir unto Esau for a possession I want to skip to verse eight and when ye passed by our Brethren the children of Esau which dwelt in sear through the way of the plain from elth and from Eon gabbar we turned and passed by the way of the Wilderness of Moab and the Lord said unto me distress not the moabites neither contend with them in battle for I will not give thee of their land for a possession because I have given our unto the children of lot for a possession verse 14 and they spake in which we came from Cades Baria until we were come over the brook of zared was 38 years until all the generation of the men of War were wasted out from the among of among the host as the Lord swear unto them for indeed the hand of the Lord was against them to destroy them with among the among the hosts until they were consumed and then I want to just read one more verse in 19 if you will and when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon distress them not nor meddle with them for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession because I have given it unto the children of lot for their possession I'd like to speak a little bit this morning on moving on from from brothers who hold you back this is a quite a powerful section of scripture here that I really can't get away from from a little while I I think it's a powerful word from the Lord in the scripture that instructs the people to turn northward to their true inheritance this is what it looked like when the children of Israel came out of Egypt now here is uh Egypt over here and this is where they're under bondage to pharaoh living in the land of Goan right here and then God sends a prophet and calls them out of Egypt supernaturally sending signs and wonders and miracles to the prophet to show that he was alive and I'm going to bring my people out and the purpose wasn't just to show Miracles the purpose was I'm going to bring my people out of bondage so God come down he said said to Moses I am come down to deliver my people and I'm sending you Moses the prophet which is God's pattern throughout Generations when they get under bondage God says I'm going to come down and I'm going to do something and Moses I'm sending you notice God's pattern God's come down but he's sending a prophet to do it and so he's never changed that pattern so now when they're here they they come out of Egypt and they cross the Red Sea here if you read in Sunday school if you were listening in Sunday school these are all stories that you heard they come out of Egypt they come here uh God drowns Pharaoh's Army in this was a great Victory on the other side of right here they're shouting and rejoicing and then for some reason they head south even even though the land God has given him is up here and you know Gaza because of what's in the news now but here's the land of Israel and God promised this part of real estate to Israel as their promised land that he promised to Abraham and it's taken all these years to make this journey but here if you look and these are simple little things that you can everybody can catch they only had just a few days journey to go from Egypt or from here straight up to their land why in the world did they head south for all all of these these two years Mount Si is where God gave them the word The Ten Commandments then they come back up this way and then as I've been preaching they Circle this mountain the sear mountains they Circle this mountain for 38 of the 40 years only three days journey to get to their uh destination and they Circle this mountain for 30 years I just read it in the Bible 38 years you circled this mountain until finally finally God says he's had enough they've probably had enough and he says I'm tired of you circling this mountain it's time to turn northward in our walk with the Lord and how God is leading the bride I can clearly say there Comes A Time When God Says in your life it's time to quit wandering around mountains it's time to quit wandering around the same things it's time to get out of the cycles that Satan has put you in and when he says it's time to move on to your full inheritance it's it's time to move on and he may be speaking that to you today how many how many years you can be in bondage you can be also not in bondage but the Wilderness wandering around in the wilderness and this is a real mystery why they came all the way down here but I'm going to give a few things in a few minutes that I'll remind you of the reasons why they wandered that long and didn't go northward but he's telling them to go northward because they're going to Cross Jordan and when they Cross Jordan then they'll take their land and fight for their land and take it back just want to make one point out of the scripture this morning while they're here and while they head up through this area there are what God calls Brothers brothers and he doesn't want the people to go through these brothers he calls them brothers if God calls them brothers we have to call them brothers but he wants to make a point the brothers or the family or the maybe back in their history they're tied to Abraham is Esau all these guys were tied here Abraham someway uh Jacob and so Jacob Esau uh ishmail all these people of the of the lineage that come from those people they're related but God makes the point I do not want you to to meddle with these brothers because if you meddle with them you'll stay put with those brothers and it'll keep you from moving on to the land that I give you here's the point he said I have given them this land but I have not given you this land I've given you something better that's not belittling what they have but you're not called to stay there and meddle with these Brethren you're called to something higher let me as a gospel Minister this morning to say to anyone that's here anyone listening on the broadcast I believe because you're listening this morning I believe I can safely say God has called you to something higher than what you're living now God has called you to something higher and you cannot remain circling a mountain in your life when God is calling you to something higher can you say amen and so as looking at the mat 38 years wandering and actually cing circling around and around the mountain stuck in the same place God got weary of it and he said I've called you to something higher and that called to something higher is in harmony with the New Testament when Paul said to forget those things which are behind and press toward the mark of the a high calling in Christ Jesus so it's in the New Testament too that God finally says hey get past your past forget your past I love the subject of the past I love to preach about it because I I I have realized through the years and especially pastoring and also in my own life getting past those things behind you is people don't realize all the things that can include your past there's a lot it's not just your past sins of being in the world and adultery and whatever else you did in the world uh then you became a Christian but it's not just your past sins that you get past but there's many things that are related to your past that can keep you from moving on to a higher calling I don't want anybody this morning to stay where you're at but God has called you to a higher calling and one of the ways you get to that is to forget your past you say well what if I'm not forgiven yet bring it to the cross of Christ can I get an amen what if the devil's still beating me up bring it to the Cross of Christ he said if we're if we repent of our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us of our sins to wash away our past whatever you've done you you've killed somebody the the worst things bring it to the Lord he says I will bring forgiveness from the flood of Calvary you'll be washed and completely clean can you say Amen can I get an amen this morning this is the gospel can you say this is the good news that you don't have to carry your guilt of sin you can bring it to him and he'll wash it all away that's the Simplicity of the Gospel of Jesus Christ to know that you have been forgiven lot of times with people though in their past they've been forgiven they said I accept God's forgiveness but Satan still tries to use it and there's other past things past not just past sins past former teaching about God you've been wrong about God well I went to that Sunday School in that denomination all those years you may have been taught a little bit wrong about God so if that's your P you say well who in the Bible did that the Apostle Paul the prophet Paul he learned in all the highest teachers of the land he learned all about Jehovah God and when he come to that Pillar of Fire and the reality of God he said I had to forget not my past sins not just my sins had to forget all of my former learning about God and consider it dung in order to receive Christ so that's a past that's not you know drinking and adultery and all these things that's a past of learning God the wrong way on and say I've got to die to that past Lord show me the right way amen it's a higher calling can you say Amen there's some other things of the past I I can mention past influences of other people past hurts and pains from people I know nobody's ever had past hurts and pains from people I have I know none of you have I'm being sarcastic none of past hurts and pain somebody's done me wrong someone did something dastardly to me 20 years ago I'll never forgive that person well you may be bound the rest of your life because forgiveness is the only thing to be released to be released of that past sins past hurts and pain past Church situations that damaged you should be getting a bigger amen than that there are past Church situations that we don't like to talk about but they're hurtful situations and people don't get past those things true but in order to move to the higher calling you got to get past that every history of the church has good bad and ugly in Israel's history they had Miracles they had signs the water turned to blood they had a sign in the heaven of the pillar of fire they had a cloud by day a pillar of fire at night they had wonders done by Moses they had the uh water come out of the rock they had healings and our history has had the same thing don't tell me that God hasn't done Supernatural healings in this congregation from this testimony from last testimony all the way back till we had a young girl that got cancer she was 8 years old and God supernaturally healed her of that cancer and she still alive today we've got a history of God doing Mighty things come along and say there's been nothing happening in the bride till now I defy that God has been doing Mighty things through the years I don't know where you've been but he's been doing and our history is full of all kinds of good things healings that defy the doctor's word yeah anybody with me this morning we've had healings recently of cancer that defy the doctor's word defy the pronouncement of a doctor that defy a sentence of death we've got testimonies that God stepped in our history has good but it has bad and ugly too and Israel in their history had fighting bickering fussing but I just want to be honest one of the things people are appreciating about the testimonies is the honesty the transparency how many to raise your hand no sense in hiding anything tell it like it is this is what I'm going through and I know think you you think I'm a super duper human being but I'm not a super duper human being I'm a a flesh man but I got a super god that's living in me somebody say Amen I've got a super duper God living in me with a super sign but I by myself am not a super human being I'm capable of anything of this world I'm capable of killing someone without God I'm nothing yeah but because of God because he's real he can take worthlessness he can take ashes and make Beauty out of Ashes can somebody say amen God can take the most impossible situation Glory I serve a god like that this morning glory people think it's the people and they're expecting Perfection out of the people it's not the perfect people it's the perfect God in living in the people you get the Holy Ghost you'll be perfect that's wrong teaching if you get the Holy Ghost you receive the power to be able to overcome but you'll never be perfect in these bodies oh can I say it you'll never reach perfect perfection in these bodies because these bodies are not born again can you say Amen but in the Holy Ghost you have a power within you to bring this body under subjection Glory it's not a sinless perfect in this body but there is a body that I'm going to that's sinless and this is all just practice this is getting it's just like yielding to the Lord until finally this body gets so fed up with being under subjection to God that just this body falls off and I step into another dimension of a perfect body a perfect body that never had a wrong thought a perfect body that that never gets sick a perfect body that never gets depressed I'm telling you friends that's your destination this morning you will receive a perfect body but it's not here Israel had that history but God finally says it's time to move forward Glory it's time to move forward that's right all the Miracles didn't say that you're in your land yet that's right that's not the proof that you're in your land yet because we're still having Miracles that doesn't prove you're in your land yet Pentecost had that we've had that for years you can have all the Miracles and still not be in your land fully yet how many raise your hand I want to be in that land God's called me to I don't want to be stuck with brothers that's keeping me as I want to be in that land if he called me to a higher calling how many raise your I want to be in that higher calling I want to press into that higher calling it's about our journey the Lord with us and so this is a journey can you see that yeah it's a Journey like Israel had a journey and with a journey you have a destination if you start out on a trip you know you have a destination and you can see many good sites along the way but if you're headed somewhere you're not fully satisfied until you get to the destination can you say amen amen uh you can take a trip across America you can see a lot of pretty sites along the way but what's the destination in this journey of serving the lord you can see many good things but you can see some bad things too you can come through Construction you can come through things that would delay you you have to go around a detour I hate detours you have to go around but the journey is the journey go what's it about it's not about the construction it's not about the delays it's about the destination it's not if you're under a trial for 3 years that's not what God's looking at it's about the destination it's about the victory at the end glory be to God I might get excited this morning you're not already excited hallelujah it's about the destination you know when you go on a journey you can have car trouble you're headed somewhere and you know I'm an impatient person it's like I want to get there I want to get to especially if I'm going to the mountains and God's calling me back those Smoky Mountains I want to get there I want to get there it's like 7 hours and I want to get there and then you can have but in a journey you can have car trouble you can have a flat tire anybody listening this morning with a trip you get The Good the Bad and the Ugly you you you can get on the wrong road none of you have ever done this either you get on the wrong road the GPS leads you the wrong way yeah I thought it was perfect I can tell you it's not perfect you know you have this argument in the car too is that the husbands get real arrogant they know more than Siri they no more than this woman that's talking to you and so you have this little argument going on because the husband feels like she's not right I'm right and he gets proved wrong when you're off in the desert somewhere and papa thought he had it right and the wife she just so nice and sweet I told you so I told you to listen to her well listen I've listened to her and the reason I don't trust her who is this woman anyway how did she come into my life I was doing fine without her I don't trust it we we were headed through Kentucky and we said there's this be beautiful national park there and we said we put it in the GPS we had MMA and Papa and everybody kids were small we took in there took it took back and they had the direction they had their address of the park but somehow that GPS took us through the some of the most primitive parts of Kentucky I'm telling you these people were way back woods they weren't even driving cars they were driving four-wheelers everywhere I didn't see any cars they just kept getting this GPS kept following and going and then it takes us down this little country road I'm seeing cows I'm seeing Barns and as we kept going down this the road gets more narrow and more narrow then we turn up here we turn up here and Papa's in the back car and he's he calls and he says I don't think this is it let's turn around no oh we're going forward keep going then it gets it goes smaller we can barely fit on this little path and then it stops in front of this house and there's a little path going up on a mountain now I know the the park is somewhat on the mountain problem is the GPS took us to the other side of the mountain instead of the right side where the entrance is so I could have got to the park but there's this like hiking path and the GPS says to go left and take your cars up the hiking path and then that's when we humbled oursel and said we better not do that you can have a GPS mislead you on a journey you can have people mislead you and you can get uh you can get detoured detoured from where you're supposed to go in the Lord by intentional people by people maybe unintentional listen if you're following the Lord there's only one GPS you need to be following Glory not somebody's version of the message but the true message of God can I get an amen you need need you don't need to follow man except God speaks through that man and whatever is he speaking from the Lord you follow that because we Paul said follow me as I follow Christ so there are men that we follow but it better be the Lord it better be his word that's the only true GPS in your life to get you to the destination and if you don't know where you are you can't really decide where you're going you have to figure out where you are first well I'm a sinner today I'm I hav an accepting Christ at all I don't feel like I need it maybe that's where you are but if you find out where you are and you cry out to God and say this is where I'm I at I realized today one simple thing I don't know that preacher he's strange he's loud he's yelling he's got weird glasses I don't know him from Sam but you know what today I I I establish in my heart I need the Lord and start there at least you know where you're going to start from because a GPS has to know where you're at first to take you to the destination I can't wait to get to the destination that God has called me to get to spiritually naturally spiritually to reach the High Calling Are We There Yet Daddy and if I'm not there yet God take me there and physically this Rapture this body change we're called to go to that Rapture we're called to go to heaven that is our destination Daddy are we there yet we're not there yet but we're getting close yeah thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information
