of Christ we believe you can be fed and we pray that you'll be blessed visit our website for more information at literallife.church may God bless you my friend and may the music and message encourage you today [Music] thank you [Music] if I know me still be in the boat scared to death trying to stay afloat [Music] on the Waters of that rain if I know me but I know him the one who speaks peace [Music] no creation no base and I'm praying for the paying forth to get out of the boat sink or swim I know me but I know we're here follow me still be one July is late he didn't come in time and that stone would still be there in place and I never had if I know me but I know him [Music] speaks life to the grace [Music] and I'm praying for the face [Music] [Music] [Music] I know [Music] [Applause] but I know him I know him no one who speaks peace [Music] [Music] faith that all Jesus cause I know me cause I know me but I know we're here [Music] thank you Proverbs 24 and verse 30 I went by the field of the slothful and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding and lo it was all grown over with thorns and nettles had covered the face thereof and the stone wall thereof was broken down so Solomon has went by this man who has this Vineyard and he's seen it grown over I want you to remember that term it's all grown over with thorns and nettles covered the face thereof and the stone thereof was broken down and then I saw and considered it well I looked upon it and received instruction now it's strange that you would look at a man's yard and Vineyard and garden and receive instruction but God can speak through anything I received instruction yet a little sleep a little Slumber a little folding of the hands to sleep so shall thy poverty come as one the traveleth and the and thy want as an armed man you know there are some lessons sometimes that we get by reading by hearing preaching by hearing teaching we not only receive lessons but we receive Revelation from the word of God and so there are there are channels that God has given us for us to get lessons from and most of the time it's from reading and hearing and preaching and teaching but then there are some lessons and instruction and even Revelation that we get in everyday life and that's everyday life by experience and a lot of that experience is not just going through things ourself but observing the life of others watching the life of others we can receive instruction by watching the life of others and we can we can receive wisdom by looking at the fruit of other people's lives and how they are acting how they are responding and we watch it more than what will give up or what more than what we'll admit sometimes that we're very observant of other people's lives and uh often we compare ourselves and the Bible says talks about comparing yourselves and everybody's trying to keep up with the Joneses and get what the next person has so in doing that we're always observing we're always looking and those who are on social media are always watching someone else and whether we realize that we we learn from that and we take instruction from that and we can be influenced from that and we watch how people act and so we can be watching from time sometimes and watch not just a day not just a moment but we can watch for uh many many years from a distance we can watch years unfold in a person's life and then we can see the end result of a person's life and we can observe and see that we can watch them for years and then we see the end result of what direction they went and what they did and we can see the fruit of that and sometimes when we look at a life we're impressed sometimes we say we conclude and say you know what if I would like my life to end I would like to in it to end that way sometimes we're attracted to a life and we say I would like to be more like that there's several mentors in my life that I that I look to and I've looked up to and many of them some of them are even in this church but many of them around the world and I'm glad that God put somebody there because Paul said in the Bible follow me as I follow Christ follow in other words of Christ is in that person and you see the fruit of them growing in the fruit of Christ then we realize that's a person to follow that's a person to look to and I've said I said I want to be I want I don't want to be like that person I tease preachers sometimes because I'll I'll say them even sometimes sometimes when they're younger but when I see something good in them I tell them I want to be just like you when I grow up and uh they kind of chuckle at that because they say the same thing back to me but that's that's something that we look at because we as we get older we look at and we observe things and we see good things and so we're sometimes we're impressed with watching people's lives but sometimes we're disappointed and then we learn from that and watching them and we conclude I don't want to be that way I don't want it to end up that way I don't want to take the same path that that one took I remember in the Bible there was one of the Patriarchs I believe it was Isaac or excuse me um Jacob and uh he had said when his sons went and uh took the the men of the city and one of them had violated their uh their sister and so they went all the brothers and they went and uh circumcised all the men and and and and killed some of them and the daddy didn't know they went and did it when they come back he said you shouldn't have done that and then he prayed he says Lord let me not come into that type of anger that's the way he quoted he says Lord let me never come into that type of anger so he's saying I've seen what they've done but oh Lord I don't want to take that path and sometimes you can look at a life and say I know I don't want to take that path and sometimes you see the path they took and you see the end result and when you see the end result then I know I don't take that path this is what Solomon did here in the text when we read that he got a huge Lesson by walking by someone's Garden someone's yard Solomon walked by a Vineyard and he's seen the garden not kept up seeing the garden was not kept up so things were falling apart and there was Weeds growing and there was Nettles growing and there was Thorns coming up and so he seen the vineyard and he's seen this Garden was not thriving it wasn't producing like it should it wasn't beautiful like it should be and he observed it and said he's seen things over growing and things coming out and and so and I'm sure that person that owned the house and Vineyard they started out they wanted a beautiful every person's one it's a beautiful Vineyard or beautiful yard or a beautiful thing but we all realized that if we watch all the if we if we look in all the magazines of The beautiful landscape yards it doesn't happen just by a picture yeah can I get an amen out of that tonight at least you know you can look at it all you want to but it takes a lot of work it takes a lot of effort and then once you get it in and it looks beautiful then it takes a lot of work after that to keep it thriving to keep it beautiful can you say Mom that's why I don't like Gardens I don't like to plant all this stuff because there's you know weeds that come up and things and so I in the family get left with weeding and why have a garden when it's going to be all suffocating with weeds and all that and that's just the personal little um trouble that I have with Gardens but you see now uh Solomon said it's evident that this person in this so Solomon he looked at the Garden and he looked at this and it was actually a reflection of the person a bit now that seems a bit critical but but it is your life and your your home and your life and your finances and things like that it can reflect something that might be lacking in your life and people get defensive when you talk about it but Solomon's doing that he's walking by this and I'm sure it was a nice person I'm sure they had a great goal to have a Vineyard to have a beautiful fruit coming from it grapes and all but it was evident that the person in the house was not willing to put in the time it takes to keep it flourishing and to keep it growing and there was visible outside things that became a reflection of the person in the house because he made that diagnosis he right away called him a sloth he said his this is a slothful person and he did it by looking at what was taking place outside uh and so so now the visible outside became a reflection of the person in the house and Solomon said he's slothful he's and slawful means lazy and uh a slothful also means the lack of Courage I thought this was interesting an interesting meaning into laziness because we look at laziness a certain way but in the spiritual way laziness is a lack of courage and Zeal for the great things God has in store for those who love him God has great things in store God has more fruit to bear from your life when Jesus in John 15 was speaking about abide in the vine you shall bring forth more fruit and then he goes and said then you'll be pruned and you'll be things even more fruit can you say amen and then he says another stage he said you'll bring forth much fruit more fruit much fruit and as God keeps pruning us and we keep yielding and he keeps cleaning the garden and all these other things he wants us to bring forth more fruit how many know that God has great things in store for them to love him we know that can you say man but we want we don't want to offer a slackness or a slothfulness or a laziness towards God when we know that there are weeds growing in our garden when we know that there's something that's growing within us and we won't address it we let it overgrow everything we can't ignore it can you say Amen we have to be willing to say if I want the results that God has promised me then I got to be willing to take these weeds and things in my life and really be serious with them then he says the end result will be poverty in an armed robber that's what it means there the end result of that person's life will be poverty so in other words they were getting fruit there from their Garden but after all the weeds grow up and take away he has no fruit he has nothing to eat and so now he has to go to Extreme Measures to steal food from someone else an armed robber would go steal food an armed robber if they're not if listen let me say it this way and I'm jumping quickly through things here if they refuse to make their own garden flourish to feed themselves so they'll start stealing from others or bumming off of others or mooching off of others let me say this if if if you don't get the Holy Spirit yourself then you'll mooch off the Holy Spirit from somebody else and you can't do that they said give us of your oil we don't have enough for ourselves going by and get your own oil amen so now we can't mooch off with somebody else this is your own garden this is your own place to flow this is your own spiritual walk and and guess what if everybody falls by the wayside you're not going to want to be depending on them can you say Amen if you have to stand alone you want to say Lord I'll stand with you and this is my garden and I want my garden to flourish in the name of the Lord so this text could be taken many ways it has good lessons in it that I could preach many ways it has good work ethic I could preach on that it it it it shows what it leads to leads to Poverty I could preach this text and preach about procrastination procrastination I can preach about business I could talk about wealth I could talk about good gardening it's all in there but that's not my subject tonight my subject is pulling crabgrass because I hate crabgrass I hate it and this this lesson tonight that I want to take from this scripture is about thorns and nettles and crabgrass and things that we need to weed out and they're not being weeded out this is a spiritual lesson in laziness spiritual laziness to not root out things that take over a good Spirit-filled life be not willing to address what it is that's starting to grow slowly not willing to do it and ignoring it and you can't Thrive spiritually things my subject is pulling crabgrass because I hate crabgrass crabgrass is trying to be real grass and it's not real grass it doesn't look like real grass it looks close sometimes but it's not real grass it's crabgrass and it gets right in the middle of real grass and it makes it look bad and this fella in Proverbs was not willing to see it and to do something about it and if you don't deal with it it begins to take over it begins to keep growing and the term is grown over everything else grown over and that's that's what you got to look at is that when these things are let go in your life then they grow over the other things grown over they're not meant to be there they're squelching you spiritually they're holding you back and they grow over everything else and it breaks a makes a real bad Journey so this thing of addressing our spiritual life and our garden started at the beginning when in Genesis 2 15 it says Adam and Eve he put them in the garden to dress it and to keep it he put them in the Garden of Eden to dress it so this is part of the original plan of God and I know that was a literal Garden of Eden but it has a spiritual connotation so don't leave this part out that God puts a man and woman in a garden to dress it and to keep it and the word keep of course means to guard it so there's a certain guard you put over it from animals getting in or whether that's why they put a wall up sometimes they that's why they put certain fake animals to scare other animals a scarecrow whatever but what are you doing you're gardening your garden you're guarding it when you're asleep you're guarding it when you're away because other things could get in and destroy your garden he put them in the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it to guard it and but but to dress it uh he said I put them there to to to guard it but to dress a garden means to preserve it to preserve it and to preserve a garden you have to pull things out that don't belong there that's what Adam and Eve were given as a commission to to dress and to guard to preserve to protect this is what they were given and we don't have those things literally today we have a spiritual inheritance we have a spiritual place that God is planting seeds how many knows where the the mind is the womb to the soul the mind is where the seed is planted we want it to drop from the mind to Revelation but it starts in the mind and when the mind is all messed up and the mind is too busy and the mind is confused or the mind is filled with pornography or the mind is filled with people that hurt you or the thinking life is filled with all kinds of trash god can't plant that seed properly and you because your mind's all messed up so where guards over our minds we're preserving our minds because that's the betting ground to plant God's seeds can you say Amen so this vessel is a garden of God this vessel is a is this Garden that he's given us to to dress and to keep and to guard over and to watch over our minds and to watch over our Spirits because God is wanting to bring forth more fruit from our lives crabgrass is actually similar to similar to that Nettles and that's why I use the text because a crabgrass is a creeping grass I don't even like the name already the meaning a creeping a creeping graph if you're real grass you don't need to creep it's just something devilish about that whole thing creep do you have to creep you just grow up as healthy grass but when you're creeping there's already something wrong with you you gotta go it's a creeping grass that can become a serious weed guy says crabgrass is appropriately named as it often grows low to the ground spreading outwards you're supposed to go upward and you're spreading outwards resembling a crab and that's where crabgrass and the legs just to kind of grow out from it and like this Nettles it just keeps growing and growing and takes over and it sucks the life from the good things and so uh I don't I won't go on but I'll just say it's got to be pulled up from the roots can you say Amen it's got to be pulled up from the roots there's no other way to deal with it and if we don't deal with I'm going to be direct if we don't deal with our defenses our Thorns our anger our resentment our crabbiness our victim mentality our negativity are complaining our crabbiness if we don't deal with it it will just keep growing in our life and I know this is a simple message to you tonight but it's where the rubber meets the road if you ignore the crabgrass in your life it'll take over the good that's in you it'll smother out living in the spirit of God we can't be lazy can you say Amen about something in our life that's irritating others and irritating us it should be irritating you and we can't be lazy about that it's going to keep growing and it's time to get it out and to root it out and to say well some people say well that wasn't that wasn't really me I've had a bad week that really wasn't me well if it wasn't really you then get it out of you because it's taken over your garden people said well that I acted out of place but that wasn't really me well if it wasn't you then why did you do it if it's not a part of your garden it's not a part of your plan it's not a part of your Vineyard doesn't fit the word don't be criticizing somebody else look at your own garden say do I have some crabgrass here do I have some Nettles here do I have some thorns in my life and you say man then I'm ignoring and it's becoming irritating to my wife or to my husband or to my children praise the Lord I used to make fun of people old people especially that got down and I'd watch them all day in their front yard in their Gardens and in their landscape down in their hands and knees I laughed at them for years because they're they're they're they're pulling everyone out pulling everyone out for hours in the Heat and I laugh because as a young person you say you know there's other things for that you know I was going to title this message tonight the young use a weed whacker the old pull it out from the roots I said I thought all those years I've been laughing at those people and I'd be getting the weed whacker and thinking that's that's solving the problem and you know why we choose it because it's the easy way we choose the weed whacker because it's a quick and now we got batteries I got the battery weed whackers you don't have to string the cord all the way out there it's got a good battery you can go for a long time and you weed whack off the top of the weeds but you're not pulling it out by the root now I'm describing many many Christians today that are willing to come into service and the weed Walker whacker knocks the surface things off and you feel good for a while but nobody hardly is willing to stay with it until God you say God I want you to root this out of my life but when you get older you don't think in the terms of young because you realize all the years I'm whacking that off it's not doing any good I'm going to have to get down as an old person even not even your back problems everything else I'm going to have to lay down there like they're doing and I'm gonna have to grab that and pull it out by the roots is anybody listening to what I'm preaching here tonight I must stay with if you need the Holy Ghost you're going to stay with it until God gives it to you if you need a deeper walk with God's going to stay with it you're going to keep bringing that prayer before God if you've got habits in your life say God I'm going to stay before your throne until you take this habit Away From Me Lord you don't quit can you say man you don't give up when you've got a garden and you want it to flourish you don't give up you keep working at it may God help us to keep working at it I rejoice when someone is willing to be honest and submit we have many in this congregation and I like the atmosphere maybe it's because it's the way I lean but I like people who will get real honest and real submissive to say I want to get to the bottom of my issues and why I'm acting the way I'm acting sometimes it ends up I need the Holy Ghost but sometimes it's not that sometimes that you're ignoring something that Satan's using you're given certain territory and when we cross into this Promised Land of the life of the Holy Ghost no territory belongs to Satan at all you've got to go take it when they stepped over Jordan and they had the whole land before then that new generation and God encouragement says I will be with you as I was with Moses what a charge that should give to your hearts can you say Amen to tell Joshua as I was with Moses I will be with you you go and take it every place to put your ghost every place your foot will get upon is your ground Satan could be ran out of there and then later on in Joshua as they conquered many of the lands he Joshua when he when he was old he said stand up he says listen tell the rest of the tribes of evil Israel how long will you be slacked concerning the promise there's still so much more land to possess you read your Bible that's what it says there's still land to possess how many believe there's still land in your life to possess yeah we're still here there's still them to possess so we got to be up and going we can't lay back we can't give up we can't get lazy now no it's too late to get lazy we gotta take this whole promise and territory that Satan is squatting on we got to say I'm going after him I'm kicking him out I'm taking the land I'm taking all of me Body Soul and Spirit memory imagination Consciousness affected reason see taste feel smell and hear can you say Amen belongs to God I'm going to give it back to God I'm going to take my territory away from Satan because I want my garden to flourish in the Lord I want to be a well-watered I want to stay in church so I can say keep the moisture can you say amen I want to stay in my Bible because I can start you feed me the right nutrients can you say Amen you people have those Gardens and you're a lot better than I I am at it I know that but you know and you've got to put certain nutrients in it that's why we read our Bible God I need some nutrients today because I I got a garden here I want to address it I want to I want to pull the crabgrass out and I want to come to church and raise my hand and get under the moisture of the holy spirit so I can be watered so I don't become dry can you say Amen you have a garden in your life Sons and Daughters of God that was Adam and Eve's commission to dress and guard it you have a garden in your life and it can be grown over with the wrong things but I here to tell you it can flourish when we can't discover what it is and we can't pull it out he says step aside if you let me I'll pull the root out for you good thing we don't have to do this gardening on our own but his holy spirit would just navigate our lives and say yeah there it is there would you like me to take that from your life how willing are you for me to take that jealousy and that crabbiness how willing are you and when willing says step aside I'll pull it out of you thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information
