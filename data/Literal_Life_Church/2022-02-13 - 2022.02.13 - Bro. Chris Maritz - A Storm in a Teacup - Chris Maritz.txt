TRANSCRIPT
========================================
a subject um it might seem strange uh you know just the the subject matter or the title this morning but i want to call it uh this storm in a teacup a storm in a teacup now it's kind of a phrase that people use out there and it's it's generally means you know is to make something bigger than what it really is and today we want to look at the storms in our lives and to recognize you know it's not something to ignore those things you know we don't want to ignore troubles and trials and things like that they come for a reason and so we want to look at these things and and right we'd rather want to recognize them and see how best to deal with those storms so that's kind of the approach we want to take this morning is is to recognize we have storms and that our trials are are something that we face and and how do we face those trials why do they happen to us what is the intention behind these things and do we need to be afraid of them you know there's there's a lot of things happening out there the world is changing and and there's all kinds of things are changing around us but but there's god always has the answer for those things so we're going to turn to the word and we're going to ask the lord to give us an answer this morning amen amen in first john 4 and 4 if you'll turn with me there and well known scripture it says you are of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world amen greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world and in john 18 and 11 i'll just read that for you then said jesus unto peter put up thy sword into the sheath the cup which my father hath given me shall i not drink it amen we're going to bow our heads just for a moment once more gracious heavenly father we want to just give you thanks from our hearts this morning we give you praise lord we love you we so appreciate you this morning your presence in this place lord you are awesome you are wonderful lord and you are faithful lord so we just want to step aside lord let your holy spirit have full preeminence this morning you would take control of every thought every word that would be spoken lord i humble myself before you this morning lord i don't know these people lord but you know them father better than anybody you know our needs this morning you know what is going on in the deep recesses of our hearts and our souls oh god but lord you know lord because you're the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart you know how to speak lord you know how to answer you know how to change you know how to deliver so lord we turn to you this morning father we ask for you to come we invite you lord take control of the service just now and we'll be quick to give you all the praise and all the glory we thank you for the reading of your word this morning may it encourage us let it bless us and give us nourishment for the journey that we face in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated so i think we can all agree this morning that there are storms all around us and we face things and trials and and we don't want to have a pity party this morning so don't get me wrong today we want to look at these things with a sober mind we don't want to approach it in the sense of i'm so weak and and it's such a weary and a dreadful land and and i can't just wait to get out of here know this we have a purpose in all these things and god has custom built us for this age he made us with the intent of facing these things with the intent of us overcoming and i feel like god wants to tell us his secret concerning us amen like he said in in the old testament he said shall i come and tell them the secret concerning them what what what my thoughts are concerning them in this day what my purpose is for all these things and i feel like the lord wants to tell us this morning i have a purpose in all these things amen don't think that kova took god by surprise don't think that all our families and church issues and all these kinds of things to god by surprise he knew these things would happen amen and we look at them as a great storm we look at them as great trials but we we must not forget that those things have a purpose in our life that there's a blessing in those things amen and we see even here jesus saying unto peter because sometimes we want to fight against those trials we try to try to avoid those storms we try to go around it or try to think that as a christian now you know our life will be a bit of ease and you know we'll just coast through here and go into eternity that's not how it happens i just want to put a disclaimer out there this morning amen but look at even jesus even as as his disciple uh peter there you know with his zealous heart and and he wanted to defend jesus from what was happening there but jesus knew the blessing that was waiting in the drinking of that cup amen and and to peter this looked like everything was falling apart and the whole world has turned against this the this jesus and and their teacher their this messiah that has come and and you know they thought maybe everything was you know was falling apart and why is it happening the way it's happening and we didn't think that we would uh find ourself in this kind of a situation or this kind of a scenario what's happening and out of his flesh he reaches for his sword and he tries to defend the gospel he tries to defend the truth for the day not recognizing that in the storm was a blessing coming oh my my brother and sister we don't have to fear the storms in our life we don't have to worry about the things that are happening god has made us for this day god has given us an anointing god has given us a spirit to overcome amen i think of joshua and caleb amen they had a special anointing that's why they could withstand the trials of their day that's why they could walk into the promised land because god had put a spirit a special spirit upon them hallelujah amen i feel good this morning so we recognize we live in a time of a great shaking a great trouble and great storms and things but the key this morning and i want to reiterate that once more is not to run from the storms we don't hide and cower from these things my brother and sister and i want to encourage you young people if you go to a public school or if you get a career and you go to work one day you don't have to kind of you know go into work and kind of hide from everything and try to you know just be really tender and careful my brother sister you are the light of the world a man greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world you don't have to be ashamed you don't have to be afraid you can stand and be accounted for amen god will take care of the rest the key is not to run from our storms and our challenges and our trials but rather recognize that he that is in you is greater than he that is in the world it is to recognize that you are more than able to overcome the storm because there is a blessing that god has waiting for you in the center of that storm amen there's a blessing i remember and sometimes it just comes as little things but you know i remember going through a great trial in my life not knowing which way to turn and not knowing what tomorrow holds and you know you just everything seems like just a big fog you know you just don't know which way to go and i remember going to work i was an electrician and i had to go this up this really long walkway up to this log home that we were doing work in and and i'm walking up the uh up this little trail and i remember going up there and just the weight of of the burden i was feeling it was crushing me you know you just feel like it's just too much to bear sometimes and and i just said that name of jesus i can't believe he sang that song this morning and i just said jesus i'm walking with you this morning and and i felt that it was just in the in the very early hours of the morning and you know what it wasn't an audible voice that came it wasn't god didn't send an angel or anything like that it wasn't like that it's just you know it was like a love touch from god i was just walking up that walkway and i can still remember the the feel of the the wooden rail on my hand but god just came by just like a cool breeze and he just to let me know it's okay i'm with you and it's enough to put push you through that day and then tomorrow he knows how to supply for that day and you know and you look back through your life and and my brother sister i think we would have to agree that god was there at every turn he knows just how to push us just enough he knows how to give us just enough strength for the next step amen we were driving down to phoenix one year this is a little while ago now and we were coming down this big hill and as you come down this this hill you can see the other side there's a valley and then there's a the you can see where the road comes up again on the other side and as we come over this hill there's a great big sandstorm blowing through this valley i don't know how many here have seen a sandstorm before but you know this this sandstorm you can't see anything you know so but i could see the road coming up on the other side and i don't know what that is about me but i thought well if i can see the road on the other side we'll just gotta keep the string real straight and just push on through everything should work out right anyway i found out later you're not supposed to drive through a sandstorm it's not good for you or your or your family or anybody but you know something told me that if i can see the the destination if i can just keep my eyes fixed on the destination and keep the wheels straight stay in the middle of the road i don't have to veer off this way don't have to go after this i just stay right in the middle of the road i should be able to make it all the way through and i remember coming down into the into that that area where the sandstorm was blowing through and and it was getting a little bit eerie you know i think once i started hitting the outskirts of the sandstorm you know you start to realize this is not a joke right this is not a something to be playing around with you know there was cars slowing down drastically and and you have to watch for that because because you can't see very far in front of you so in the in the time of the storm you know there's there's many hazards things happen you know and so you've got to be careful things slow down you know everything becomes slower and you and everything becomes really personal and very close up in the time of a storm amen you know what i'm talking about this morning and so you know you start to face things that you wouldn't face on just an open road and you have to be careful and you know maybe maybe even though you feel confident about something and and and maybe i felt confident about just plowing through and just keeping my eyes on the road and just keep it straight and just keep pulling through you know there's people that are not as confident and so they slow down and you got to watch out for that they become a hazard on the on the on the road and so you know all these little things start to happen and and we started to pull through and then there's vehicles that just you know they couldn't take it anymore what do they do they stop they just stop right in the middle of the road they they they it's too much the storm is is overwhelming they can't see where they're going they don't have any confidence in their vehicle or their what what they have with them or or where they're going so what happens is they just stop they they're paralyzed because of the storm and and they don't just put me in a awkward position or in a dangerous position but they put themselves in a very dangerous position amen so we don't want to stop in the middle of a storm we don't want to get paralyzed in our storms when we're going through a storm we've got to keep our eyes on jesus christ remember that this storm will pass that there is a destination that he's bringing us to that the road continues the road does not end in the storm it continues all the way through to the destination amen this storm even though everything seemed to slow down it seemed like an eternity in there it was only about five minutes actually and it's amazing you know when we finally reached our destination you know people ask you about your trip how was your trip how's the drive down and you know it's about a 24-hour drive from vancouver to phoenix and uh you know so it's a lot of time there and this little storm was about five minutes worth but you know the thing that you tend to talk about is the storm you talk about those five minutes you don't talk about the beautiful open roads and the sunshine and the blessings and how well everybody was driving and everything around you know you focus in on that one thing and during the season my brother and sister where we have coven and our governments and all this stuff i won't get into any details today but you know as we as we see all these things is we have to be careful we don't become distracted during this time because we can tend to focus on on you know this has been taken away from me or this has become harder or or life isn't what it used to be or is this a new normal and we start to focus on these things and then we start to make rash decisions based on those feelings and that's a very dangerous thing to be doing in the time of storm we need to keep our eyes fixed on the prize we need to stay in the middle of the road the storm will pass amen god will bring us through greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world storm in a teacup those storms can be very distracting let's be honest and i think that social media my brother and sister now i'm not here to preach anything specific forgive me brother paul but you know i personally don't have social media i leave that up to my wife i'm not i am not smart enough to handle all that stuff i find it way too distracting right and you see what social media has done today it how it distracts people right we we should have more time to read the message and to listen to tapes and to and to feed on the word and to pray but suddenly we have no time but we have time for social media and social media can be my brother and sister it can be a very great distraction we have to be careful keep our eyes fixed on the prize some people look at the storms and they refuse to go and they say you know what this is too big for me i'll just skip it maybe go back to vancouver i just you know this is too much i wasn't expecting the storm wasn't expecting it to get this hard wasn't expecting it to get this complicated or confusing or whatever it may be so just forget it i'm just i'm just gonna pull out and go home people get bogged down in storms you see a relationship where you see a young person they they were happy coming to church and they were you know excited and he saw the joy of the lord in their lives and and then suddenly all something changed something changes right they got bogged down in something and they need to break out of that now the bible tells us that we are if we are children that we are heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ so be that we suffer with him that we may also glorify be go also glorified together for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us and that's a very important part there that revealed in us it's not an outside thing but god wants to reveal there's there's a there's a sharing of the sufferings of god there's a fellowship of the sufferings of god that we share in but it's not so that we can see who can endure the most or who who is strongest it's not about that it's god wants to reveal something that's in us he wants to prove you he wants to show something that's of value that he put there that's inside of you so we need to have the right attitude because god has a purpose in what we're going through the amplified bible in romans 5 3 it says moreover let us also be full of joy now now it doesn't matter what circumstance you're facing what you're going through we need to be full of joy now let us exalt and triumph in our troubles and rejoice in our sufferings how many here is so excited about their trial that they're going through can i see your hand this morning i mean i am just ecstatic i can't tell you how happy i am this is what the bible's telling us you know the prophet said we have things backwards right in the time of trial we should be excited we should exalt we should we should triumph in these things why because god is revealing something it's it's a moment where you're going to have a encounter with god that you cannot have otherwise god wants to have a fellowship he wants to have a communion he wants to share something with you he wants to tell you something about himself and who you are see it's we are to exalt and triumph in our troubles and rejoice in our sufferings knowing that pressure and affliction and hardship produce patient and unswerving endurance goes on and says and endurance fortitude develops the maturity of character how many wants to be mature well there's only one way to that maturity amen approve faith and tried integrity and character of this sort produces the habit of joyful and confident hope of eternal salvation you ever seen someone who's just quiet and you know they have that confidence about them you know they don't get too excited about this and that they just you know they're they're entered into a rest because they know what this is all about they know god's on the scene greater is he that is in me there's a rest they know who they are amen so i'm going to ask you a question this morning will you refuse to drink from the cup that god has given you think of jesus he had a cup that had been offered him a cup to drink from think of what every what what what all was in that cup the full wrath of god was poured out upon christ he had to drink the full wrath of god for us all of our sins all the all the judgment everything that we should have gotten he drank it for us and he was handed that cup to drink he had a decision to make will he drink from that cup what will you do we saw how peter tried to prevent jesus from drinking of that cup and drinking the cup was the scripture being played out and being fulfilled and peter wasn't watching that he was looking at the circumstances but in the meantime the word needed to be fulfilled something beautiful was happening the incredible part is what was happening was for peter's benefit and he was trying to stop it and read that to you once more the cup which my father hath given me shall i not drink it so we see that we are called to drink of the cup that is allotted to us each and every one of us we have a cup that's been given to us like jesus was and he set an example for us because if he can drink from that cup can we not drink from our cup so don't pass the cup off to someone else jesus recognized that the cup was his to drink that was his allotted portion no one else could drink of it no one else was going to do it no one else was able to drink from that cup but god knows what you can handle god had poured the full wrath his full wrath into this cup so we would never have been able to drink of that cup like that he had to do it for us but we must drink the cup that has been given to us we must and my brother sister whatever trial or or suffering or whatever you're going through sickness this morning i want you to put that all in front of you like a vision this morning put all those things out there and i don't want you to be afraid of it if it's a complex depression whatever it may be if you're looking for answers whatever is happening in your life right now i want you to face it put it out there there's a cup that you can't drink this morning we must drink it the sooner you drink it the better don't put it off to another day mark 10 and 38 says but jesus said unto them you know not what you ask can you drink of the cup that i drink of and be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with well i need i need uh brother brandon if he can come up at this time he's been given a cup to drink from i i believe he's the assistant pastor here so he's going to assist this morning now i want you to watch carefully this is very very tricky stuff very tricky and very dangerous but here's a storm brother okay and it's been made just for you because we love you appreciate you now careful now you have to drink that cup drink from that cup brother you have to drink all of it i'm sorry yeah there's no cheating here oh thank you very much well done brother good job brother all right thank you very much brother brandon was invited this morning to bring his cup something that he had to drink from and the storm was poured into his cup and our brother drank the cup and uh how are you feeling brother feeling okay okay that was just water just in case anybody's wondering but i think our brother looks pretty good still we'll we'll take a we'll check on him in another 10 minutes right we've got our brother deacon brother dan over there brother paul just keep an eye on her brother make sure he's doing okay but he looks he's smiling i mean he looks happy right and this is really how simple this drinking from the cup is i want you to notice something if i can just put it like this this this storm in the teacup is an expression where we make something bigger than what it really is we make it so much bigger we we see a storm like it's out there right and it's great thundering and you know in south africa man we used to get some awesome thunderstorms you know it would shake the very ground you know i mean but it's out there and you feel so fragile in a storm right you feel so like insignificant so tiny and you see those ships that get rocked in in the big waves and you know the storm we always put storms all the way around us but the storms god gives us he puts in a cup and it's for us to have a different impression different perspective on the storms god has allotted to us the the cup that he's asked us to drink from it's not all out there and and unreachable and and unattainable it's not like that it's poured into a cup now i didn't see our brother brandon when he when he was drinking from that cup he didn't look like he was struggling very much i mean that looked really easy in other words all the strength he needed to drink that cup was already in him i didn't touch him right brother brandon no there was no tricks here right i'm just showing you how simple this is it's not very deep just follow me this morning right but all the strength he had needed off he had complete control over that storm he had complete say it was his decision he he had complete power over everything in that cup he lifted that cup to his own lips he drank from he consumed everything that was in that cup he had the strength to do that and that is what god has done for us greater is he that is in us than he is in the world you have the strength to overcome you have the power you can say this morning lord this storm looked so big before i came to church this morning this looks so impossible but lord i see now that you've poured it into a cup for me and i can consume the storm you have the power to overcome everything you have need of is already inside of you you don't have to fear for nothing amen it's just every time when a trial comes and where you see a storm arise in your life remember that kappa brother brandon lifted this morning it was easy it really was that's why we can rejoice in our trials we can triumph because god has given us the strength to overcome amen thank god for his great grace amen the difference in the storm in the storms that we face is god puts them in a cup they are catered for our needs to bring something out out that is in us god's showing the value or the strength he has placed in us in our weaknesses he is made strong amen now let's look at the commission here that god gave us you'll find this once you start understanding this principle you're going to find it all throughout the scriptures mark 16 and 18 tells us in our commission he says they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick they shall recover this is part of our promise if you drink any deadly thing it can't hurt you amen praise the lord amen that word drink there it means to absorb to receive to to to absorb to become part of anything you absorb you think of their thoughts or anything like that or things that have happened in your life the things that you absorb it can't hurt you that is even in ideas or concepts or knowledge things that you have taken on that that may affect your mind that may cause doubt or or may do something to alter your opinion or things like that all those things you have absorbed it can't hurt you if you recognize what's inside of you you know some people will make an excuse and say well my family is this way so so i can be this way you know my there's an anger problem in my family so you know i just inherited that so i'm just gonna you know this is the new norm for me i'm sorry you're a new creature in christ jesus he's made all things new amen okay amen we have been called to drink of the cup we are made for this very moment in time we were placed here specifically because of the challenges that are here god has raised up a standard and it's in you god has provided the strength that we may drink and overcome and consume the storm of our day even death when the floods arise god raises the standard the bible tells us in isaiah 59 and 19 so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against him amen don't fear the floods my brother and sister wasn't it jesus christ who walked on the water think of it this morning you know we we need to start reading our bibles amen the one that walked on waters is here with us we don't have to fear floods psalms 93 and 1. just give you some scriptures here you can take home with you the lord reigneth he is clothed with majesty the lord is clothed with strength wherewith he hath girded himself the world also established that it cannot be moved he says my throne is established of all thou art from everlasting the floods have lifted up o lord the floods have lifted up their voice the floods lift up their waves the lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters yea then the mighty waves of the sea psalms 107 28 then they cry unto the lord in their trouble and he bringeth them out of their distresses he maketh the storm a calm so that the waves thereof are still. then are they glad because they be quiet so he bringeth them unto their desired haven he brings us he doesn't just take care of the storm but he takes us all the way to the destination brings us to their desired haven oh there's some good scriptures here the lord is good a stronghold in the day of trouble and he knoweth them that trust in him here's another one the lord shall fight for you and he shall hold your peace and the lord he it is that doth go before thee he will be with thee he will not fail thee neither for safety fear not neither be dismayed we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord jesus that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our body paul had a great attitude when it came to these things in labors you said i was more abundant in stripes above measure in prisons more frequent i think he knew something about storms in deaths often of the jews five times received i 40 stripes save one thrice was i beaten with rods once was i stoned thrice i suffered a shipwreck a night and a day have i slept in the deep in journeyings often in perils of waters in perils of robbers in perils by my own countrymen in perils by the heathen in perils in the city in perils in the wilderness in perils in the sea in perils among false brethren in weariness and painfulness in watchings often in hunger and thirst in fastings often in cold and nakedness in the care of all the churches he says but if i needs to glory i will glory in the things that which concern mine infirmities what is god trying to tell us today greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world who is in you this morning it's the same one that created the heavens and the earth the bible says teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i am with you always even unto the end of the world amen prophet says in the message he that is in you he says then if he is in you it's not you any more living it's him living in you see it's not your thinking what you think about it it's what he said about this now we've read some scriptures but there are hundreds of scriptures pertaining to you the winds now remember god created the winds it's air god created the waves it's water he made all these things amen he knows all about the the water and the winds and all these things he's made them he says but now that was the devil that got into the winds that sent that storm but it notices here he says couldn't the creator that created the wind say go back there where i created you so god created all these things everything we see around us is is because of god because of the word of god amen the worlds were framed by the word of god right everything we see out there is a testimony of its creator you see it's god's signature on everything amen but then the devil gets involved right he likes to he comes and he perverts he he can't create anything but he'll use what god has created and he'll get in there and pervert it and change it up but remember can't doesn't the creator of those things stand more powerful than than the devil can't he tell what he has created to go back to its original condition that's what he's saying here greater is he just carrying on in the quote here greater is he it's god the creator the winds and the waves have to obey him demons become paralyzed all nature obey him because he was the creator of nature oh when when we think of that he says it takes the bite out of it see then we understand these things you see what is it it isn't man man cannot do that man is part of the creation see but it's the winds and the waves that obey the creator see he says he that's in you is the creator who made the winds he can rebuke the devil out of the winds and there is a calm he can rebuke the devil out of the storm and there's no storm he's the creator and greater is he that's in you than he that is in the world starting to get a picture here of what's inside of us what you carry with you through your trials greater is he that is that wasn't joshua than the son joshua was a man sin born like you and i and greater was he that was in joshua and in the sun that was running by the commandment of god that is a striking thing my brother and sister god commanded that sun to shine and turn itself around and it's governed and controlled by the laws of god but greater was he that was in joshua than the laws of god was because the creator himself was in joshua that's powerful when joshua looked up to the sun and he said you stand there where you are at and moon you hang there where you are at till i finish this battle and the sun and the moon obeyed him for he that was in joshua was greater than the sun and the moon he that was in joshua what about god in the bride at the end time amen my brother and sister don't underestimate who you are and what's inside of you greater is he that's in you it doesn't matter you know sometimes we have this little box of you know of of how we try to put god you know in this little category and we try to put ourselves in a category of trying to be humble and timid and the meek you know and that kind of approach and and we're careful you know because if we pray for something maybe it's not the will of god or my brother and sister we don't have to be timid like that if you feel inspired and god's moving on your heart and you are facing a storm just speak the word of god speak the word and go forth the creator is living inside of you we don't have to be afraid anymore he's not giving us a spirit of fear but sound mind sober sound mind what does the bible tell us that it's given us a mind for life and peace amen he that was in moses was greater than all of egypt hmm he that is in you is greater than all of the united states greater is he that was in daniel than he than than the lions greater is he that was in david than the bear that stole his sheep greater is he that was in david than the lion that came in and took one of his lambs greater is he that was in david than the enemy goliath we can go through a lot of bible characters today i think we get the point but the thing to this morning is what about you greater is he that is in you than he that is in your trial then your sickness then your temptations in your habits in your complexes then your hardship then your loneliness greater is he that is in you greater is he that is in you than that wheelchair greater is he that is in you than that stretcher greater is he that's in you than that cancer greater is he that is in you then that affliction greater is he than anything that there is the devil could put on you greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world greater is he yes amen he is in us that's the christ he was the conqueror of every enemy for us when he was here on earth he conquered sin he conquered sickness he conquered death he conquered hell he conquered the grave and now he lives in us as the conqueror the champion the conqueror my brother and sister is living inside of us and do you think there's anything new for him he knows how to defeat that devil amen he's the same yesterday today and forever he's not afraid to be hung on a cross to take the stinger of death into him he knows what he's made of he's living in us today if christ lives in you will we not do the same things as he did like the nature of an artist amen john 14 12 just as a reminder he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because i go unto my the father that's living inside of us is the same one that drank the full wrath of god and remember when he was drinking from that cup it was also a great storm there was an earthquake that took place on a cross jesus is the calmer of the storms he's not afraid of the storms amen that same one lives in you this morning i guess this afternoon i'm just getting warmed up i just woke up about three hours ago amen mark 4 and 37 says and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so that it was now full and he arose and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm i always found that interesting that it wasn't just a calm but when god does something it's not just a calm he's not just going to take care of his situation he's going to do something great it was a great calm that took place something special happened so much so that the scribe that wrote this my brother and sister he made sure to note he was a great calm sorry and he said unto them why are you so fearful how is it that you have no faith and they feared exceedingly and said one to another what matter of man is this that even the wind and the sea obey what manner of man is this what manner of god what manner of of a holy spirit do we have that even the nature you know nature is waiting for us nature is groaning and and travailing it's an it's in such great anticipation that it's it's breaking forth and it's in pain have you ever desired something that much we had a couple's uh banquet last night you desire to to be with your your spouse you know there's a there's a hunger there's a there's a pain maybe it's just me right but there's a desire that needs to be filled and earth is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god it's waiting on you how many points do you think that those disciples got for worrying about the storm you know how many you know if they had to have a little meeting in the boat and say you know the storm is this big or or it's a category this or whatever you know we're getting coming up with some pretty fancy words up there in vancouver now for storms we've had some very interesting weather and now they don't just call it rain anymore it's called an atmospheric river right i mean do we get any points for that it's just rain right but this is what it's coming to right we we can take science and we can analyze it and we can look at churches and we analyze or criticize or we look at families and analyze and criticize or we look at individuals we analyze and we criticize it and we need to be careful because all that is is a distraction because when jesus comes on the scene he's not looking at any of the little pointers you want to give to how great the storm is or or how smart the devil has become or you know how bad this individual is he's not looking at any of that amen he's there for your benefit he wants to show you something he's not looking at the storms he made those things he's holding the cup in his hand praise the lord you know god has a way of comforting people you believe that we go through trials and we go through things in our lives and god knows how to how to come by and get your attention let you know i'm with you it's going to be okay it's going to work out i know i've needed that amen he just knows how to speak you know something will happen and or the dates or something lines up or you know somebody calls you or says something you know those things mean a lot god has a way of comforting his people i think when we look at the prophet's life brother branham look at the challenges he faced the storms that he faced the issues the the the people and the questions and you know all the things that he faced in his day you know look at how god tended to him in his storm i want to show you something because i believe that god allowed him to go through things for our example so we can see who's on the scene for the bride who's here for you and i look at this here i want to just kind of change the the direction here a little bit and just show you how god comes on the scene during in the middle of a storm and i want you to ask yourself the question as we go through this little story ask yourself the question do you think brother branham would ever regretted that moment in his life do you think he would trade the storm with anything in his life watch this here think about your storm are you willing to forego that cup he knows about the things brother branham was going through he knew what was in the heart of brother branham and i want you to look at the detail in which he takes care of of this with brother branham in this message he that is in you i think it's appropriate even the message title he that is in you 1963 at the end of the year brother branham in the beginning of the service he's dedicating two kids now he's had some incredible storms in his life you know what happened early on in his life and so forth and god was gently trying to comfort him trying to lift him up a little bit and in this dedication there's this one boy and then a girl look at this here he says my here's the first one i'm quoting right from the from the message here my here's the first one a little pair of brown eyes looking at me with a big cute smile now remember i want you i want you to put yourself in the scene he's going through tremendous trials tremendous storms and all kinds of things and here he is just a regular sunday service whatever the service was an evening service and and he's got and he's got to preach the word and he's going to preach on the subject he that is in you and and watch what god is doing in the middle of all of this god is orchestrating something this brown little eye is looking at me a big cute smile a little girl he says what's her name the mother says that sharon rose sharon rose god is doing something for this man he knows about the storm he knows about the questions he knows about the the things he has dealt with in his life and here he's dedicating this little girl and the mother says it's sharon rose sharon rose he says sharon rose that's a great name to me we named her brother branham after your child after my little girl that's gone on we named her before she was even born brother branham we named it before she was born if it had to be a little girl he was going to we was he was going to name it sharon rose we were sure she was going to be a girl she had to be prophet says had to be she's sharon rose goodman you know what i don't know that you know it or not if my wife was standing here she would probably almost faint this is the same kind of dress that my little girl had at the dedication little sharon rose this one maybe maybe may this one live where god has taken mine you know my little sharon rose looked just like that i guess there's anybody here remembers her by how she looked she had little brown eyes like that like her mother real sweet little girl with dark hair he says dear god as i hold this little treasure a little sharon rose you know in my heart lord what i'm thinking so i don't have to express it he recognized god was doing something you remember the service says he that is in you you know my heart lord i don't even have to say it lord i know you know about me this morning you're speaking write to me lord i'm listening i hear you in the middle of this trial how do you do brother he says let's see arnett the father says yes arnot arnett that's right he says we named our boy after you is that right william william arnett james william arnett that's a fine boy then he starts into the sermon at about paragraph 86 you can go read this whole message if you like he says well i said to the brother and that morning he was he was hunting and so forth he says now the first drop of rain starts to fall the first snow the first sleet anything take for the camp just as hard as you can because within 15 minutes you can see you can't see your hand before you and it will just twist and blow and i don't care how well you know the country he says you're going to stay right there and you'll perish he says because sometimes you can't even breathe the sleep is blowing so and you would die right there so here they're in the mountains and and he's warning these brothers when the storm comes get out of here okay he's a woodsman he knows what he's talking about he knows these places and he knows that when this storm comes you won't survive it they're anticipating a storm sure enough the forecast forecasted storm arrives he couldn't even see the bottom of the mountain anymore he couldn't see any more from where he was sitting he said and then he goes on and talks about there it was that blizzard that has been forecasted the storm that you knew was coming it was there now in his mind he knows he needs to get out of there because if he stayed there he would die you see sometimes storm comes where we know we feel get this feeling in our heart lord i can't handle this i can't take this this is bigger than me so what does he do he starts making his way back to camp he knows what to do now i want you to watch something remember god has a cup allotted to each and every one of us and remember what i said in the beginning there's a blessing in that cup sometimes all we see is is just the storm but there's something there god wants to reveal something in us and if and if we excuse ourselves from drinking that cup you'll never see what that blessing was watch what happens here now it says and so then i started down he's making his way away from the storm and i got about halfway down there and something said to me just as plain as you hear me stop and go back i want you to think of those words here's a woodsman well acquainted with the mountains he knows what that storm he's already told his other brothers don't stay here because you'll die now a voice comes to him sometimes we feel like god does this to us why am i so special why do i have to go through this can't you pick on somebody else but he what is he doing god is giving an invitation to brother branham an invitation stop stop what you're doing and go back go back where to the storm that storm that you know that if you go in there you're gonna die but i'm giving you an invitation now don't ask me to explain that my brother and sister but god wants to reveal something that's in brother branham he wants to show him something stop and go back don't fear the storm don't worry about those things i'll i'll be with you i will fight your battles for you turn around and go back he says go back through that storm half mile or more back up the mountain into that dark place that dark timber forest when he can hardly see as far as that organ is what an invitation how many of us would accept an invitation like that you know it's easy to accept an invitation to a wedding or something like that but can you imagine an invitation like this i have a cup for you to drink from maybe you'll wake up tomorrow morning and god has got a cup waiting for you to drink from it's an invitation my brother and sister don't fear it you know that's why we don't have to fear a doctor's diagnosis we don't have to fear these things my brother and sister it's an invitation from god he says but i'm he says i'm getting old now i've been a christian for 33 years and i know that no matter what how ridiculous it might seem mind the lord do what the lord says so he goes up he says i was the one who made the winds this is god speaking to brother branham now he says i'm the one who made the winds to cease upon the sea i was the one who made the waves to go down i created the heavens and the earth was i not the one that told you to speak to those squirrels and they come into existence he says i am god he said speak to those winds and that storm and it will go away now the bible lays before me which i lay where which my life is in that he says i raised up i said i do not doubt your voice lord i said clouds and snow and rain and sleet i resent your coming in the name of jesus christ go to your places i say that the sun must come out come immediately and shine for four days till our hunting trip is over and i leave with my brethren and you know the rest it happened exactly that way now you might say that's amazing what a beautiful testimony there's more okay there's more because sometimes we look at the signs and we go wow that was amazing and we stopped there okay but there's more to this what was happening watch this is now after the storm remember now he has consumed the storm now just what just right after this now watch what happens here he says i thought the very god of creation it's all in his hands what is he telling me this is really what i want to drive home today what is god telling me he says i picked up my gun i wiped off the scope started to walk back and go down the hill and something said to me why don't you stroll with me through the wilderness walk with me i said yes lord with all my heart it would be one of the greatest things i could do was walk with you so i put my gun over my shoulder you know enoch walked with god like that once it's the same invitation to us today an invitation to walk with him now watch he keeps walking with god and he speaks about the place where he would remember meda and their wedding anniversary on the mountain there thought of how old he was getting and you know he was just talking back and forth with the lord kind of reminiscing over his life and the things the lord has done for him and he says and so as i went along like that something took place all of a sudden in every motion principle i was a boy i thought as a boy what was happening i want you to really pay attention what's happening here because one day it's going to happen to us after the storm is over there's a communion that takes place and we can't we can't have one without the other he was going young like almost a body change and i had my head down and i looked up and just as plain as i ever saw her there she stood before me with her arms out and i stopped rubbed my face i looked and i said mita is that you honey i looked here i thought what now what has happened and i thought oh yes i'm walking with him and it changed then and i was back an old man again and the vision was gone from front of me then he sees those three deers now it keeps moving along the story it's beautiful he says then he sees those three deer and and he doesn't shoot them because remember he made a promise to god he says i wipe my face like that and just then something happened a voice spoke out just as clear right out of them blue skies not a cloud it's all been within just a little bit of time and a voice spoke out and said you remembered your promise didn't you i said yes lord he said i'll remember mine too i'll never leave you nor forsake you the burden then left my heart and it hasn't been there ever since may it never be again does the lord know how to move on our situation let us know that he loves us he's with us in our storms and i think if brother branham you think of the option he had there to to either go back up that hill into the storm or just keep going down the hill he had a decision to make will you drink from this cup there's something that was waiting for brother branham on the other side of that storm and he wouldn't have gotten there i don't think if he didn't go through the storm why not walk with me through this wilderness you know i would give anything to hear that but am i willing to drink from the cup that's really the question so the trials that we're looking at and the things we face in our lives my brother and sister it's just a storm in a teacup it's so little it's it's so small compared to what happens right after i want to walk with him i want to talk with him i want to hear him say well done my good and faithful servant but we have to be willing to drink now i want to just say again we don't have to fear the cup we don't have to fear those things because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world i'm closing after the story brother branham goes into his sermon he that is in you what a setting for a sermon what an understanding of who god was to him the relationship that brother branham had with jesus christ we have the same thing you know we look at the prophet's life and we go wow that's amazing he's the first fruits of what we have yes we have that each and every one of you i don't care how old or how young you are this morning my brother sister if you've been baptized you've seen the holy ghost in your life been sealed guess what greater is he that is in you and he that is in the world um musicians can come i'm i'm finished the mighty conquerors living within us today i want you to take courage as you as as we change the order of the service and you start thinking lord remember me this morning i have a need today i would love to feel your hand on my shoulder and then give me an invitation like he gave to brother brennan i want to walk with you in this wilderness i want to talk with you i want to sit with you for a little while i want you to take me beyond the veil where i see myself young with my wife and my family take me into those heavenly places show me the the blessings that we have in heavenly places in christ jesus take me beyond this fleshly elements just for a moment oh god and encourage me and strengthen me for this journey so i asked again this afternoon are you willing to drink from your cup if god came here today and he could visibly give you and hand you a cup each and every one of you and you could see the trial that was laying in there you might not know what the blessing is in that you might not know what's going to happen you don't know those things but you know that greater is he that is in you i don't have to fear this [Music] with god anything is possible there's nothing impossible with with god by stripes we were healed amen there's so many blessings we could lay on the table today you don't have to fear what's in the cup we were made for such a time as this no one else is going to drink that cup you know there's a great cloud of witnesses watching and waiting watching us they can't drink our cup we have to drink it they've already drunk their cup they've done their part they're waiting for us they're cheering us on it's going to be all right it's worth it all amen i say this morning by just a confession of faith lord because of your grace because of your strength lord i will drink from my cup let me consume my cup because i see the other side of the journey i see the other side of that storm and it comes up over the hill just just in a little while we come up on the other side of the hill and we'll reach our destination we're coming to our haven of rest let's be willing let's be bold let's be strong don't fear what people say out there don't listen to the criticisms and and the naysayers my brothers and sisters is between you and god it's your cup to drink it's not their cup to drink they can say all they want but it's for you to drink because there's a blessing hiding in there the glory that will be revealed in us amen god bless you let's stand together as we turn it over to brother paul amen god bless you brother and sister have faith in god pressing the battle amen we love you keep us in your prayers and we'll be praying for you and i want to encourage you don't leave today unless you've sorted that out with god if you want to pray we can pray but i want to encourage you don't leave until you've settled that thing with god today say lord i have a storm in my life i have something i'm dealing with but lord with this understanding today lord i i know you're with me you're in this lord i'm not alone in this thing and i can handle this i'm strong enough because of your grace because of your strength even though i might feel weak you know it's amazing and i don't mean to keep you long but it's amazing you think of hannah the bible says that god shut up her womb and here hannah is thinking you know she's sad because she wants to give a son to her husband and she wants to do the things that are expected of her to do but the bible tells us that god shut up her womb so god knew what she was going through god had a purpose god had a reason he was creating a desire in her so that when she would come to the temple and cry out to god that there would be an extra portion given to her for her need you know the bible tells us she was given a double portion in her storm in her trial god gave her an extra portion to meet the need that she had and you know that that extra portion it literally signifies that that that high priest was giving her a meal for hannah and for the unborn child that she couldn't have [Music] god provided in her hour of me and there was something revealed and a great prophet samuel was birthed out of that storm what about your trial what about your situation can god not turn it around and and make it a great blessing a great triumph i want to say this morning i wouldn't trade any of my trials for anything i have no regrets my brother and sister no regrets for the things i face because i know him he's allowed me to walk with him [Music] and nothing nothing can ever satisfy them god bless you me [Music] behind we'll follow where he lives [Music] [Music] him with [Music] all the way
