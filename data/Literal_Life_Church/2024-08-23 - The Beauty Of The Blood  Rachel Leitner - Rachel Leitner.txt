The Beauty Of The Blood

Verse 1:
Coming clean
All the secrets he has kept from her so long
Are finally known
Her big mistake
That one regret that haunts her to this day
It just won't fade
So many different stories we thought could not be redeemed
But it's against our darkest failures we start to see

Chorus:
The beauty of the blood
The goodness of this grace
The mercy undeserved
That could never be explained
Heaven's best takes all the scars
For the worst in all of us
That's the glory of the cross
The wonder of His love
That's the beauty of the blood

Verse 2:
What a thought
Just a single drop forever wiped away
Our every stain
And with its power
Every chain that held us now lies at our feet
We stand free

Bridge:
Forever changed
I stand amazed
By everything it does

Chorus:
That's the beauty of the blood
The goodness of this grace
The mercy undeserved
That could never be explained
Heaven's best takes all the scars
For the worst in all of us
That's the glory of the cross
The wonder of His love
That's the glory of the cross
The wonder of His love
That's the beauty of the blood
The beauty of the blood

Written by Tony Wood, Michael Farren, and Joseph Habedank
