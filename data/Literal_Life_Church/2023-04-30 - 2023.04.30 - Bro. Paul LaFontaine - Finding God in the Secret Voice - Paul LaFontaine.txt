========================================

and uh we'll be mindful of the time and yet we know that we want to give time to the word of God can you say Amen praise the Lord so if you would turn with me again to our scripture in first kin First Kings 19 and we'll remind you and Echo that scripture again from Elijah's experience here and then uh First Corinthians 19 and we'll just read one verse and we'll read one in Revelations First Corinthians 19 and verse 10 verse excuse me First Corinthians 19 and verse 11. he said go forth and stand upon the mount before the Lord and behold the Lord pass by and a great and strong wind rent the mountains and break in pieces the Rocks before the Lord but the Lord was not in the wind and after the wind and earthquake but the Lord was not in the earthquake and after the earthquake of fire but the Lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still Small Voice and God showed Elijah that I will be in the still Small Voice Revelations chapter 10 and verse 7 and I'm going to connect these two verses because we move from the Days of Elijah to our day in the Fulfillment of scripture and we're living in Revelations 10 right now and Revelations 10 if we get time later in the message we'll break it down if not we'll do it the next service Revelations 10 and we're just picking up verse 7 to the day we live in but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophet so if the Sabbath Angel is to be a vocal cord to bring the final mystery singular mystery to the Church of God in the last days I think it's pretty important we know who the seventh messenger is I think it's important pretty important we know who the seventh angel is and all these were seven Messengers angels in his right hand say was an angel in the other dimension no angels can be Earthly Messengers bodies can you say in bodies and so it's important that we know who the seventh messenger is because he's the one who will be used of God to Break Forth this mystery to his people and I want to title this today just to Fort for a short time finding God in the secret voice Heavenly Father we graciously thank you Lord for the mercies that you extend to us the blood of Jesus Christ the message of Christ of the last days and Lord we're grateful for what you've done Lord not only financially for the church but mostly Lord the Revival the spiritual the changed lives that we observe over and over again and it can be a little child that weeps at an altar and they recognize the presence of the Lord and their need for God lord from the small things to the great things you're doing a mighty work and Lord it shows you're in in charge of your church Lord we want to yield to you we want your Holy Spirit to continue to guide us during these times and we know when we walk outside these doors we walk into a great Darkness but Lord the light that we receive through your word here will be enough light to be able to shine in this darkness and to pierce the darkness Lord help us to live lives that are Sanctified dedicated to you Lord Spirit-filled lives Lord with our lamps trimmed and burning Lord for we're burning at the the Midnight Hour Lord we're burning the oil at the midnight time and I pray father we'd stay filled with the true spirit of God God come and meet with us today as we deliver your word in Jesus name we ask him amen amen God bless you may be seated so we have been covering some things concerning the stability that we find in the word of God and I am preaching recently of the one source that God sent to us in these particular times for our stability and our security and uh you know God hones down and bring things down many times God can speak through many things God can speak through many uh venues and different things Through the Ages but it seems like in his mystery at the end time he really brings it down to a secret a mystery and and he wants to show us where that place is that he dwells Elijah had to know uh from God he had to be taught I'm not in the earthquake I'm not in the wind why is he saying that because we could look for God in different things but at this particular moment in Elijah's life he wanted to tell Elijah I'm not in the earthquake I'm not in the wind that's ripping the the Rocks apart I I'm not in the in the fire but I want to let you know where I am and where you can find me and that's in this still small voice and so when we get to the end and I'll just throw this out to you when you get to the seventh mystery the seventh seal there's not much written about it but I can tell you it's similar in nature and characteristic when it says and when he had opened the seventh seal which is the final seal when he opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven for the space of a half hour so there is a span of time that there's something happening so mysteriously and so secretly that the public will not know that it's going on now God is not all that always that way God has a way to display himself through the supernatural to the entire world God can do anything he wants can you say amen God can open up the blinded eyes God can raise the dead can you say amen and he's done that and can still do that but when Believers come to the depth of the mystery of God it's not that God would display himself to The World God doesn't want to just show off to the world and God doesn't want to just endorse you and prove that you're right to everybody it's kind of like what they said at the cross Jesus come down and prove yourself prove that you we believe you're the Son of God come down and prove yourself the soldiers were were kind of taunting him saying if you're the Son of God come down God doesn't show off for anybody God has bound his word can you say amen and so though he can display things to the world sometimes when he comes to the final mystery it's a secret to the rest of the world and it's only for believers to catch it praise the lord well I didn't get a lot of amends on that but if I need to I can go back through the scripture and show you God can change his his God can change his his display and he can show us that you have to find him but it's in a mystery it's in a secret and he's going to make himself let me go to Jesus if you don't understand let me go to Jesus when his disciples ask him why do you speak to us in Parables why why can't you just plainly say it out there he said because it is given to you to know the mysteries of the Kingdom it's given to you so I'll sit down with right now with you and I'll share the secret of what the parable means but it's not given to some I'm just quoting Jesus now so there is a voice within the voice you can hear a literal voice of even Jesus you can hear a literal voice of even a messenger can you say Amen but there's a voice that's within the voice that speaks to his people that reveals a mystery that she needs to know and it's beyond Miracles it's beyond signs it's beyond wonders it's beyond signs in the heaven can you say Amen it's coming to the final thing that we need in our lives for stability can you say man because if you were depending on a miracle God will do it but if you're just depending on that then you might be disappointed when God chooses not to do a miracle that day am I going to stand alone here do I need to go to John 6 my favorite place in the Bible to talk about the third part of Jesus Ministry Jesus had three parts to his ministry he healed the sick great Supernatural things he discerned the thoughts of the people but there was a deeper part and in John chapter 6 we have the chapter starting with 5 000 followers who saw his miracles of multiplying the fishes and Loaves he they watched it he's got five thousand followers and he has to leave them because they're so excited about the food and they're so excited about the miracle and so excited that he had to exit because he feared they were going to take him and make him a king that's how enthused they were about Jesus I'm gonna teach you the word of God today I hope you're listening okay they were so enthused they were going to make him King it wasn't time for him to be a king he's obligated to the word of God so he's got to escape this big crowd we're ready to make you a king now it's not time for that the word doesn't say that now but in their enthusiasm for a true work of God and miracles of god they wanted to make own King Jesus exit and then they come back to him and he starts to speak things about the bread of life it's about eating it's about these spiritually partaking he says then he comes down he says does this offend you I'm the bread of life the next verse to say I can read them to you because many of his disciples come to him and said this is a hard saying why are you talking like this you're the bread of life just just do the Miracles many of his disciples left him at that point because they were tied to only the miracles of Jesus was it Jesus who did them yes if he does a miracle here today as far as visibly heals cancer how many believe he still does it he can raise the dead here today he can do anything he wants to do but if you're only tied to that you're not getting to the mystery of Christ in your life in one chapter he goes from 5 000 followers to the last of the chapter to 12 left the Jesus you serve something happened he goes from 5 000 followers in one chapter down to 12 followers and one's a devil it's like Jesus what happened to your ministry everybody's left you everybody's gone where's the following where's the big crowds I'm afraid of big crowds I'm afraid of big big things because my Jesus when he gets to a certain point and begins to bring the word to the people then he starts to lose followers now if Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever how many believe he's the same today we often think of that scripture he's the same yesterday he can perform Miracles he can do the same he can do whatever he wants to do we believe that but that scripture also means that his nature is the same and that is he can show the world Miracles till he has thousands following him but when he starts bringing the word he'll start losing followers because people want the Miracles but they don't want the word that's why you have make-believers and unbelievers and Believers in every congregation and I'm going to add another one spectators Spectators they're not on the team fighting against the devil they're on the outskirts sitting on the app just watching everything looking for something to go wrong I guess and so Jesus comes to the end I didn't expect to get into this scripture but it's just to explain this is the nature at the end time when the Seven Seals revealed he said there was silence in heaven we don't like a god of Silence we don't like a guy God that's being silent or that's hard to find his still Small Voice that's too much work for us we want an audible voice we would like a prophecy and I'm not against prophecies we like something just so straight and so audible like that and so we tend to cling to those things as like my last series I talked about Divine love and Paul says we could have prophecies we could understand all Mysteries and yet not have the real thing of divine love and so it didn't dump out the gifts it didn't dump out what what the Pentecostal experience brought us but but when God take there's a reason God attracts our attention with the Miracles I said to you before I don't need another miracle to keep me in the message if God never did another miracle I'm stable upon the word of God now I pray for him to do Miracles because our teenagers need to see a God that's real and he will never stop doing those as our faith unites together can you say Amen he's able to do the impossible but personally I don't need to see another thing of blind eyes opener the dead race I've seen it I've watched it as a young kid I watched the man be prayed for and some of you were in that service in Lima I've watched a man completely blind be prayed for and Shout around the room his eyes completely completely became open I needed to see that and say my God is the same yesterday today and forever but now as I've grown as a Christian God can do it and I'll glorify my shout but if he doesn't do it I'm not leaving I'm not exiting I'm not questioning whether everything's true or not my experiences become deeper than that I fell in love fallen in love with the Jesus the the true Christ can you say Amen it's the Christ of the message it's not what he does it's who he is I've fallen in love with who he is [Applause] he's a person and he never wanted the children of Israel just to lean on all the Miracles they complained and said God we don't have any water give us the water God we don't have any food they were childish babies Pentecostal babies that needed signs to keep them going we want to go back to Egypt went to God we just go back to the world if God's not going to do another sign how immature God said that for 40 years they have not known my ways they know my works but they don't know my ways God wanted a people to come up close to him and get such in close relationship that they become one with Christ that this mystery see what are you talking about what Paul preached Christ The Mystery of God revealed Christ in you the hope of glory that's more than a miracle that's more than being a part of a movement that's more than shouting in dancing thank you so you know Jesus one chapter 5 000 followers down to 12 and one's the devil and can I just mention what he said there because it goes with my theme finding God's secret voice you know what the key was of stability you know what kept Him in Peter didn't even understand all that was going on but he had a revelation simple Revelation this is the way he worded it he said Jesus said to the twelve you're going to go away also are you leaving come on now friends this is Jesus who you serve with 12 followers left 12. that doesn't seem like the numbers that the mega churches are bringing in how many true experiences of repentance and Holy Ghost is happening in those atmospheres not to be critical but God's Not About Numbers God's not about quantity he's about quality of the holy spirit in people's lives I'd rather preach to 10 people that are getting filled with the spirit than 200. Peter catches something because Jesus test him said you guys going to go away all also you're going to leave as well this is offending you are you going to go something rose up in Peter he says to whom shall we go so to Peter the Revelation was there are no other sources there is nothing else for me that's what what powerful words to whom shall we go I have found the source you are the source I'm not going anywhere I'm not going to get on Google and search something else I found my Christ I'm here to stay what did Jesus find what did they find in Jesus he said thou Peter said thou Hast the words of eternal life he didn't say you've got enough miracles to keep me wasn't the Miracles it was still still small voice what was calling Peter right at that moment the still Small Voice that was a voice within the voice that no education gave him no Seminary gave him and he said Peter Upon This Rock he said when he said thou with the Christ the son of me he says flesh and blood has not revealed this to you you didn't get it in college you didn't learn it by learning the father has sent you a revelation of who he is in this hour who I am and you're holding that Revelation in your heart and he's speaking it I don't even know completely what I found but I know I found him and I'm not going anywhere I'm here Jesus said a few scriptures earlier my words that I speak unto you he says the flesh profiteth nothing the flesh these are powerful words friends I'm way off of my notes today the flesh profiteth nothing but my words that I speak unto you they are Spirit they are life he's saying the same thing he said to Elijah it's not God in the earthquake it's not God in the Wind but you'll find him in the still small voice my words I speak unto you they are Spirit they are life so we've been getting into the stability and security that we find in the one source that God gave us in Christ in that still Small Voice in when he speaks to us so uh intimately through his word that's the stable voice can you say amen and to speak these things is to be so that we not fall into the Trap of turning to other things for our stability there's really only one thing left in this world we can trust and put confidence in now and that's the word of God there's only thing one one thing left in this world that will not corrupt everything else will corrupt political systems are corrupt government systems are corrupt Hollywood has been corrupted almost since it started everything has corruption in it but the Bible says the only thing that's Incorruptible is the word of God it's the only source left that we turn to and so we see then that because it won't corrupt that's the thing and then he says some other things like all other things besides what he gave us to live by and to bring us the Holy Ghost and debris assurance and to bring a stability in this hour he said every other thing will be shaken God will shake everything else including religious intellectual experience and cause it to fail in your eyes because he because he wants you to know the only stability is in the word of this age so everything's shaken here's some scriptures Hebrews 12 25 see that ye refuse not him that speaketh notice Paul doesn't say in Hebrews see that you refuse not him that's doing miracles see that you refuse him not him that's speaking the power is what he's speaking the power to live is when he's speaking can you say Amen see that you refuse not him that speaker for if they escaped not who refused him that spake on Earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from Heaven whose voice then shook the Earth but now he has promised saying yet once more I shake not the Earth only but also heaven and this word yet once more signifying the signify the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken May remain wherefore we receive a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have Grace whereby we may serve god acceptedly with reverence and godly fear so he shakes everything and the only thing left is the unmovable thing the word of God that we live by that's what we should live by says another thing in second Thessalonians 2 verse 1 I'd be so because I want to take this further all kingdoms will be shaken all political systems will be shaken religious denominations will be shaken if they're not based upon the word of God everything will shake underneath us can you say amen and God will do that but here's another thing that shakes look at this in second Thessalonians 2 verse one now we beseech your brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto him and just make a note the rest of verse the rest of the chapters about the Antichrist Spirit but look what he says that ye be not soon shaken in mind so he shakes every Kingdom of this Earth but we're it's deeper than that now Satan wants to shake us in our thinking Shake us in our emotions Shake us in our minds to where we're troubled and we're feeling shaky and we're feeling nervous where in our minds Paul said that'll happen in the last days when the Antichrist spirit is beginning to manifest itself people could be shaken in their mind but he's saying you soon not be shaken or be troubled neither by Spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as the day of Christ is at hand let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and then that man of sin be revealed the Son of Perdition we're in the day of the revealing of the Antichrist spirit and I can tell you my friend if you're listening it is not just some Russian thing it's not communism but Jesus said it'd be so close to the real thing that it would deceive the very elective possible the Antichrist spirit is here it's working but it's not out there in Russia can you say man it's of a religious nature it's trying to impersonate the true Christ yeah and you can see things that just soak look so close to the real thing and it's only the discernment of the Lord that'll allow you to be able to detect The Faults from the real that's the day we live in no wonder our minds could become shaken Lord what do I believe what's real are you in that God I'm saying things that our young people probably think God are you in that it seems so real are you in it we better pray we better know let no man deceive you I want to know that I know that I know and so he messes with the mind he messes with the Mind Satan's messing with the Mind Satan's messing with absolutes I mean you know Satan's messing with absolutes obvious one is the the absolute in science and the absolute and the word of God guys are guys and girls are girls now Satan's messing with the absolutes you know when I read the news now I just I want to quit reading it because every day this stuff is in the news and you know we got the trans and then and then now yesterday I read that there's somebody decides they want to be a handicapped person and I forget the term but they want to be in a wheelchair and they they choose to look like they're handicapped and they're not and you know I'm sitting there thinking I gotta quit reading this stuff because it's messing with me it's like there is no sound thinking anymore but you know let's not talk about the trans gender let's talk about how he messes with absolutes in the word of God he comes within the message of the last days the movement of the message not the message of Jesus Christ for the last days but the movement and he's working among us to mess with the absolutes so people are shaken in mind I just tell the devil all the time don't mess with my absolutes it's established in my heart this is God's absolute Malachi 4 5 is an absolute to me who who the Sabbath Angel is an absolute to me I know who that is I know who Malachi 4 5 and 6 is don't mess with my absolute but he does and it's interesting that his attacks start to you know Satan young people listen Satan is not this red creature with a pitchfork if you had that in Sunday school or whatever that is not the devil pitchfork Tale red you got that there's the devil the devil works right within the church to deceive you to the wrong thing how do you prove that from the Garden of Eden he was subtle he was slick he was handsome stood upright talking to Eve and all he did was put a question mark at the end of the word of God we need to question this here's the word this is what God Said yehad God said he's actually quoting the word by the way so the devil was not in this Pitchfork red creature he was a Slicker that was quoting the word now if we want to grow up and be Saints here let's grow up and be Saints I'm not here to just Pat people on the back listen the devil is our adversary but he's subtle like the Beast was in the Garden of Eden and he quotes the word he quotes the word but it puts a question mark at the end of it right he's the one that puts the question mark on God said to Adam and you believe it even when you don't completely understand it I'll show you I'll show you understanding I'll let you know over time but I want you to believe it he just wants us to be brainwashed people just believe it and not understand it well if you're brainwashed by the right thing it wouldn't be so bad I don't mind being brainwashed by the true word of God I just wash all my thinking away so I can think like the the God wants me to think so he's subtle he was a Slicker he wasn't a red creature with a pitchfork he's quoting the word and he's deceiving Eve that way and he's still the same way we must know let me just get further here we must know where we stand today because of this we must know where we're standing we must know what we're standing on if we're on the wrong thing God will move it if we're on the wrong Foundation God will move and crash that a foundation and we will watch it fall apart kind of like quicksand quicksand is not regular sand sand is bad enough you remember Jesus said don't build your life on the sand building on a rock which is a revelation of Christ build your marriage build your life young person build your life build your career on the rock of a revelation of who Jesus is build everything your finances build it on the Rock but he says he that builds it on Sand is seeking sand it's movable and quicksand is work because it sucks you in quicksand is a mixture of water and sand together quicksand is a mixture of water and sand together and water is movable boy it doesn't take science to figure that out water is not water is movable and you put you put uh water around or close to that sand it becomes quick sand and you can't step in it because it's going to suck you in you're going to be sliding and then you're going to go down because why don't build your life upon that we must know where we stand can you say man we must know what we're standing on in the hour we live in can you say man and then when we're standing on something that's wrong I want you to know God loves you enough that if you're on the wrong Foundation he will shake it not to discourage you but to say it's time to get your life on the right foundation Jeremiah 23 12 swear for Jeremiah 23 12 wherefore their way shall be unto them as as slippery ways slippery ways that's my demonstration this morning is slippery he says they they that their way shall let be them as a slippery ways in the darkness so it's not just slippery it's in the darkest they shall be driven on and fall therein for I will bring evil upon them even the year their visitation saith the Lord it's slippery ways there's no Foundation to it there's no word there's no voice of the Lord there there's nothing to base their lives so they choose to live on the slippery ways and they become unstable the word unstables in the Bible James 1 8 a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways second Peter 2 14 says having eyes full of adultery and that cannot cease from sin beguiling unstable Souls a heart they have exercised with covenants practices cursed children beguiling unstable souls and then second Peter once again Peter says about Paul as also in all Paul's Epistles speaking in them of these things in which are some things hard to be understood he says the prophet Paul brought some things that even Peter said they're hard to be understood which they that are unlearned and unstable wrestle with rest wrestle with Peter says I I don't understand everything Paul's saying but for unstable unlearned people they wrestle with it as they do also other scriptures did he just com did he just compare Paul's writings with scriptures he did they wrestle you know the thing is is if you wrestle with the messenger you you end up wrestling with a lot of scripture other scripture unto their own destruction we need to know what we're standing on we need God to bring stability to our lives can I get a response this morning we need to know that we're standing on the right foundation can you say Amen and we're being challenged of what we believe what we really have at the core of ourselves there's a discovery going on in many people's lives growing up in the message they're discovering things sometimes and they're discovering that they're wearing out from just doing the right thing on the outside that that's wearing out that doing the right thing is not enough I'm going to articulate this because I feel the lord gave it to me there's great discoveries going on and sometimes it can be embarrassing but many lives there's discoveries that go on that realize wow I thought I was on the right foundation and I'm not I thought I had the Holy Ghost and I don't I'm not preaching anybody here that has it they know that they have it but their Discovery is as I thought I was here and I did the right thing and I'm wearing out of just doing the right thing because Mommy and Daddy said to do it and because the messenger said to do it and because this that and the other but that's wearing out because why the times we live in your foundation has to be more sure than that there's too many demonic forces that we're fighting against you can't be on sinking sand you can't have a foul's nation that's shaky you've got to know where you stand to go against this devil he's subtle he's slick you got to know where you stand and so though this discovery that's happened Lord I realize I had a sister tell me the other day I had a preacher there's a pastor that was here and sharing his testimony I grew up in the message and even got into preaching and I didn't have what I needed I thank God for that type of honesty because I'll just say this it might be embarrassing to realize you don't have the right foundation it might be embarrassing but what's more embarrassing to meet it at the end I say it's worse to continue pretending than it is to be honest I don't have the right foundation and I need an altar in my heart don't ever be ashamed to admit the foundation's not right and to say well I can just keep building no you can't build if you have the wrong Foundation you can't build correctly the house won't stand you know there are building projects that start that somehow some glitch happens in the blueprints and the builders start the foundation and they build it up and they discover oh my goodness we did something wrong there's something wrong here and the foundation's wrong so we have to we have to tear it all down this is what the prophet said to one brother one brother who said I didn't understand about the godhead and baptism and he said I thought I had what I needed I didn't understand the truth of it in the Bible that there's one God and you have to be baptized in the in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ a father is not a name boy I'm giving the word today and I if you can't say Amen just chew on it I'm just asking you to take it with you father's not a name son is not a name you said Jesus said baptize the father son who goes but he said in the name of and the name is not a father the name is the Lord Jesus Christ and so this fellow he had this struggling he's wrestling with us and he has a dream about a house because he's a contractor he has this house and the wrong Foundation was there and so he said the prophet Prophet said to him brother Brian said what's the dream about that he said this thing I have to tear the whole house down and I had completely rebuilt the foundations God's showing you your doctrine's wrong you can't just build off of that false Doctrine you've got to start at a foundation and rebuild the whole thing again yes you've got to start over say God I'm here at your altar I'm repenting I have the wrong thing can you say man there's no shame in that there is embarrassment there it can be embarrassing but I'd rather tell the whole world and say listen this is where I'm at than to go on pretending putting something on is so embarrassing because these contractors say you know what we spent millions of dollars that's another thing rebuilding foundations it's painful and it's expensive and it's embarrassing because the whole city sees it's like what are they doing now well they're tearing the whole thing down well what kind of idiot what a person who did that it's embarrassing we have to tear all the foundations and we have to rebuild them again you think God is embarrassed at that no God's all about foundations preparations so I encourage you through repentance true repentance if you come to that Discovery I have family members my sister would tell you 25 26 years old great wonderful Godly girl she discovered she needed something at that age she didn't have what she needed she'll tell you hundreds of testimonies saying I grew up in this message I grew up I don't have what I have I respect it I honor it but it's getting old I don't have any power to live against this devil I'm lacking something praise the Lord praise the Lord and you recognize you're lacking something just be willing to say I'm willing to start from scratch with my Lord and say God I want you to tear up tear it up and rebuild everything so that the house that I build on is not on sinking sand oh I feel his spirit in here this morning God is speaking I believe it's a hard saying and that's what the disciples felt like this is hard it's hard to hear sometimes but see listen friends I want to be I want to be obedient to the Lord to share my heart for you can you say man I don't want to be a deceiver I want us all to have a true experience with the holy ghost from the pastor to the deacons everyone must know where they stand in this hour I've got a spirit in my heart oh I love it when a 14 year old gets filled with the spirit of God and they know where they stand they might still be a little immature but they know they got something from God somebody say praise the lord we need young people filled with the spirit we need parents filled with the spirit we need older people filled with the spirit we need our foundation to be sure can you say Amen we need to know where we stand today based upon the word of God and know that if we have to rebuild that there's really to God no shame in rebuilding it's actually a blessing when God shows it to us can you say Amen praise be to God oh how many wanna say Lord rebuild me if I need to be rebuilt Hallelujah Satan's last attack I can take you through the scriptures to the core of our only stability left he's striking at the core the word came by the prophet of the age and he strikes at the core of that word which becomes the only stability that we have left demonic forces talking to you talking you out of it if you can be talked out of something then you must have been originally talked into it so the foundation's wrong good we don't need to be unstable that we can be talked out of something but we want to have a stability that we can't this isn't an intellectual exercise this is an experience with him Christ and so did not demonic forces trying to get this but the discovery comes I need something more than somebody forcing I need something more than somebody forcing me how to dress I need something more than somebody telling me what to do praise God for these truthful discoveries I say praise God that it's manifesting time how many believe it's manifesting time over time every seed will come out Jesus said every seed will manifest a matter of fact somebody so tears with the weed and the farmer said what is this and Jesus said an enemy hath done this while the wheat was being sold the tares was being sold by an enemy he said should we get the tears either he said no no no no no no don't because if you root out the tears you root out the weed with it let them both grow together let them grow in the same congregation and over time it'll manifest what they are and they'll see who they are and everybody will see who they are and that's a that's a bad thing no manifesting time is a good thing it's a good thing because I believe as he said in three kinds of Believers he says if you've seen yourself as a make-believer this morning you've seen yourself as an unbeliever then pray and get to an altar and say God make me a believer make me a Believer there's Grace there's Mercy can you say amen I know about election but listen I know I had he write that said she said whatever whatever you ask right now whatever you ask and knowing that a new birth takes God dealing with somebody a mother asked her one request she was a poor woman and she could have had lots of money in that moment that at that moment brother Brown gave a testimony of the supernatural Miracles that was going on and she said to him in her house she had nothing to eat hardly at all she was a poor one Hattie Wright said brother random that ain't nothing but the truth and the Holy Spirit swooped into that place and said tell her she can ask whatever she wants right now whatever she will guess what she asked for in the bedroom over there was two young Sons laughing at what was going on they're laughing they're mocking you know what she asked for not money she asked for the Salvation of her two sons Hallelujah and God saved those two boys they begin to weak and they got salvation praise the Lord so you know it's in what we ask for and we see then that God moves upon us and God shows us his way and God makes these if we if things are manifested then that's a good thing it seems so heartbreaking when things manifest but it makes you if it makes you in the end a real believer and obeying the word for your age it was worth it when your foundations are wrong the building will never be right can you say Amen so we go back we tear out we start over it's an expensive thing it's a laborous task but it's worth it I want to tell you this morning that it's worth it it'll be worth it in the end and so I sat across the table from a minister if I said his name you know him great influence there's several of them great influence in our ranks and they just denied everything this denied it in front of me a friend of mine and he began to explain all the fanaticism and all the trouble and just a bunch of stuff for two hours he's just and I just said I said brother I said I see all that I see the trouble I see the fanaticism that follows this last day's message I see the things that are the work of the enemy working right close to the work of God I see people that are weird if I was basing this upon following people and their instability I would have been gone a long time ago something happened to me as a 16 year old boy and I say the same thing as Peter to whom shall we go thou Hast the words of eternal life something happened to me and it's not based upon the fanaticism and the unstableness of people sometimes either on congregation they're in and out they don't know what they believe from one day the next that's fine I'm going to keep preaching it I'm going to keep praying for you I pray for many of you more than what you realize for the stability in your life but I can't force it on you I just got to preach it I pray for you but my stability does not based upon people's ups and downs or my ups and downs can you say man I'm anchored into the anchor of Christ [Applause] The Anchor Holds it's held up till now and it's going to hold the other storms that are coming I'm in a storm right now but the anchor is holding friends the anchor is holding it's everything I can do to preach this morning but The Anchor Holds I'm not going anywhere because I'm rooted to the truth of what this last day's message of Christ has given me I've met the person this is not about a movement this is not even about William Branham or any other of those the ministers that were used of God it's not about that it's the Christ that I found in a still small voice I didn't find him in a denominational Creed I'm sorry people are fine and there's lovely people I have great friends there but in a denominational Creed you know what it does it takes away from the word and when you take away from the word you take away from the spirit of Christ I didn't find him in a denominational Creed I found him in the word for this hour it's not about a man and if it's about any man it's about the man Christ Jesus there is no other mediator between man and God except the man Christ Jesus anybody leaving as a visitor to say think we're promoting any man we we believe there's a seven days messenger We Believe Malachi 4 5 was fulfilled but every fulfillment of that is to bring the bride in the last days back to the Bible and back to the Christ the Living God [Applause] the main attraction here is Christ and the message of the last days has revealed the Christ is the mystery of God revealed the mystery in Revelations 10 is what the bride will come to not the Miracles of Christ the mystery of Christ would the god that every young person every adult you might be 50 years old and saying I don't have what I need well praise the Lord my brother let's pray together let's get what we need I said to that brother I said when I look at all the trouble when I look at all of it I'm going to find a place to close here I promise when I look across the table Adam I said when I see all the trouble when I see the fanaticism when I see the strange doctrines that that's come out of this movement when I look at all that an emphasis on the outside rather than the inside emphasis on a man instead of Christ emphasis on interpreting doctrine that they shouldn't be interpreting I could go on and on but when I seen all I said to this man when I see all of it the true message that God sent is the only thing that I can trust and rest on as being solid in my life the message of Christ for the last days is what God sent that is the only stability in its revealing of Christ it is the only stability to turn to so I said to him you're throwing the baby out with the bathwater you're looking at all this financing you're throwing the baby out with the bathwater I said I'm not throwing the baby out with the bathwater all the dirt all the Dirty Water cast it out but don't throw the baby out it's the only thing left that's solid it's the only thing left that's stable praise the Lord Elijah under that third mystery what God was not in and he wasn't in the earthquake he wasn't in the fire he wasn't in the wind at that third pole we come to what God is in and what he's speaking in it's in the secret voice the still Small Voice Elijah was shaken until he found where God was and he got quiet and listened can you say amen and he reassured him you will not always find me excuse me you will always find me Elijah in this still Small Voice and at the end time you will always find the reality of him in the voice that he has sent you know another thing you told Elijah I'm I'm reading my notes here and I'm actually looking for a place to close I promise you there's a lot there's a lot here you know another thing he told Elijah that it's brought in confidence not only he says I'll always be in that still Small Voice if you'll get quiet if you'll settle down You'll Always Find me in that still small voice are you listening isn't it a joy to know there's a place that you'll always find God you always find me get quiet Listen to listen to that word and let him speak to you and the answers will be there here's another thing he said because he thought he was all alone I must be the only one believing this young people say that I must be the only one I've had young girls say I'm gonna be a I'm going to be a Old Maid the rest of my life there's no man out there for me I know what it is to be despised and rejected of all men how old are you I'm 18. feeling alone the devil abuses it so Believers today Elijah felt he was the only one and Jezebel was breathing down his neck felt like he was the only one here's another encouragement that he felt stable he said I got 7 000 down there in the land that's believing the same thing as you there's some real Believers on this young person there's some real believers filled with the Holy Ghost you might walk through a school that they might persecute you you might work walk through a college you might go to a job that nobody believes like you don't you ever believe the lie from the devil that you stand alone in this I said Elijah I got 7 000 around this world let's believe in this word praise the Lord do you love them this morning God is good amen God has put his voice in his word there's a voice within his voice and that is our stability that's where we find our peace and when you know you are hearing his true voice and it leads you day by day by this message and you know there's there's there's more of you around the world that's believing you feel a peace settled over you in your heart can you say Amen you feel a peace settle over you in your heart you feel a stability come Lord I may not be all that I uh want to be I may not be all that I need to be but thank God I'm not what I used to be and I'm in the right Channel that I can hear from God we must know where that channel is and find it we must know who our pastor is all the five Federal Ministry ministers to us but then there's a there's a particular channel that the pastor feeds your family and you can say I'm growing under this gift this pastor his shepherding his leadership today you need to know who your pastor is and have trust and confidence not in me but in the office can you say Amen this is the channel God's feeding my family we need to know where we stand we need to know where we know we're standing in the word of God we need to read the word of God [Music] I'm being honest with you if God has done this active our lamb has stepped into this this stepped into the vision John had and our lamb that went to Calvary 2000 years later now on this day he takes the book of redemption and he he peels the seals off of it the Mysteries around the book he does that in our hour and he breathes forth the seals you say well how did he do that how did our lamb do that that's all invisible but then he says in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound he'll burst forth all of these things through who he has on Earth so he begins to give this to his people give it to his people give to this P just give it and then within that there's this this voice of the Lord Jesus Christ I will speak to my people at the end time I will have a channel that I'll burst forth and I'll speak all this for but they have to be listening they got to shut out the other voices in their lives are you willing to shut out the other voices I wonder if we have some in our assembly that haven't even cracked ever even looked at a seal book haven't even looked at a church age book haven't even read much of their Bible haven't you know listened to the seals that troubles me it really does and I'm here not to make you feel bad I'm here to say God's done something God's spoke something God had a channel that he worked through see well what about all the other well my goodness God blessed throughout 2000 years of church here in history with Godly ministers Godly men the reformers God used and he's still using Mighty Men praise the Lord praise the Lord but every people have trouble when you hone it down to seven Messengers in Jesus right hand through the church ages All The Godly ministers in Paul's age there's a lot of Godly ministers but then there's seven angels in his right hand there's seven Messengers God singles out says this is the one that this is the one I'll really greatly use to bring my word to the people Paul irenius Columbo help me out brother rap Martin Luther Wesley I have seven stars on my right hand you come under those Messengers that are speaking to me I'll bring my church through and then he says the last one the Thunders break the seals break and I'll pour it all how's he going to do it he gives us the exact time frame in the days of the voice of the seventh angel I'll burst forth all those voices and I'll speak those things when that bursts forth and you haven't even read it you haven't even listened to it I only need my I only need my Bible yeah but the in your Bible it says he's in Malachi 4 5 and 6. in your Bible says the seventh Messenger will be the one that finishes the mystery your Bible says that and you're not going to listen to the messenger now I'll burst the fourth and the last thing I want to say if you'll sit still and repent and just say Lord I I'm I'm available to you I'll sit still I want to be listening to a voice Beyond just the seventh angel because see some people say that's the voice of Jesus Christ no no no no no no the voice of Jesus Christ speaks through his ministers as long as I hear the seven things oh that's good no no no no there's a voice within the voice so I'm hearing all this stuff blasted forth and it might be loud I played it in my home that might be loud but takes another thing to hear the still Small Voice that's speaking within it and all of a sudden somebody realized wow I shouldn't have listened to all the people that are being so critical because I realize there's something in here there's something in here that I didn't realize was in here you know and I preach it I preach things and I become like I'm from another planet you some of you are thinking that this morning it's like where did this guy come from where in the world it's because you're not feeding on the same thing the same voice Jesus Christ he's not going to say anything different to you that does to me it's going to be consistent it's going to be stable it's going to be he's so if you're listening the same voice I am it's a lot easier to say Amen that registers amen that's the truth amen I'm not forcing you to say man I like amens but I'm not forcing you to say it I want you to have the amenor on the inside the Holy Ghost is the amenor and it only agrees with the word of God and only feeds on the word of God so if I preach the true word of God if you've got the amen or something down here is saying amen even if it don't make it to your lips sometimes well I'm kind of reserved and quiet okay but if you got that amen or his registrant saying you know there was a guy one time fighting with somebody because it was a Pentecostal saying that the tongues is initial evidence the tongues is initial evidence all he goes he said that's not scriptural he's trying to point him back to it say no it was other tongues not unknown tongues of the day of Pentecost does God speak with unknown tongues yes he does that's not what happened in the day Pentecost it was other tongues and everybody heard them in their own language there was nothing mysterious about it that's what God had dead on the Bay of Pentecost then the Pentecostals took that and said that's the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost where's no scripture for that sometimes in the book of Acts they didn't speak with tongues so did they not get it so he's arguing he's arguing so later this guy comes to further truth not at that moment though he's going to argue he's going to fight with him you're wrong you're wrong and he said later he testified he says wow that guy why was arguing with him because some people they they win the argument but they don't win the war you know so they feel like they win the argument but anyway he's fighting and he said later he said you know what the whole time I was arguing with him something down in here was saying but he's telling the truth that's honest the man's telling the truth and yet he's fighting it because our flesh will fight but Jesus said the flesh profits nothing the words that I speak unto you they are Spirit they are alive our life is in his word by his word I'll prevail by his word I'll overcome by his word I'll become a conqueror can you say Amen by his word will be stabilized to make it to the rapture not by religion not by denomination by his word we'll have the stability to make it through this age I'm going through a trial this week by his word you'll make it through because his presence is in his word can we stand together this morning can we give God glory can we give them a hand of praise by his word by his word foreign [Music] I believe it by his word [Music] by his word [Music] I'll overcome [Music] I believe it amen oh bye his word [Music] I'll overcome just worshiping now [Music] oh my father [Music] his words [Music] my his word [Music] how overcome I'll overcome by his work I'll prevent and I'll overcome lay hands on one another this morning and praying this altar is open this morning the Lord had us really Linger on the foundation part foreign Lord has Linger on that today in the service just think about that now if the foundations are wrong you should have a fervor in your heart I want those foundations to be right whatever it is I'm lacking I want those foundations to be right I'm going to raise your hand and say God if you have to rebuild do it in me do it in me if I could come compilation to whom shall we go there is no other source there is no other place to go it's not this church friend it's not this church okay it's not in a man it's not even in William Branham it's in Christ the word Christ the last day's message to bring the people of God to the mystery Christ in you the hope of glory God has to rebuild things or change things I trust you would cry out to him this morning say God changed me God send your Holy Spirit just now identify that your word is true God let just take all my Rebellion away from take all those things Lord that are little glitches in my life that keep me from the true thing father I pray for these people this morning and myself that we would find that stability in your word Lord and and Lord as the scripture said that we soon be shaken in mind Help the People Lord to get a hold of something that's an absolute Lord that they wouldn't be shaken in mind but Lord they'll know where they stand for the enemy that lies ahead Satan going about like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour and Lord we know his teeth have been taken out but he certainly Roars and scares us and does everything he can may we know where we stand like Daniel and that Lion's Den Lord they couldn't touch him because he knew where he stood in the word and you came

wave of forgiveness will come over the people as they bring these things before you bless our Lord's Supper communion service tonight as we gather together I pray we would be just connected in Oneness completely with you Lord there be no hindrances between you and us God I'm sorry Lord the times that I've failed you Lord if I said anything wrong today forgive me Father I want to be right I want to
