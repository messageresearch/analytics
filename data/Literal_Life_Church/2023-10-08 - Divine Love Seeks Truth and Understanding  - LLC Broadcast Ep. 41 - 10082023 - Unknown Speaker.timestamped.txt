[0:27] [Music]
[0:28] I've scaled all the highest of mountains
[0:34] and I've stood at the edge of their
[0:38] peaks
[0:39] but I still can't see to the edge of
[0:44] your love for me
[0:46] [Music]
[0:52] a wildest of waters
[0:56] and I sunk to the deaths of the sea but
[1:03] I still couldn't find them their deaths
[1:06] of your love for me
[1:18] can't contain all your love for me no
[1:25] matter how high or far I reach there is
[1:37] [Music]
[1:41] old belief in the valley
[1:46] and I barely held on through the night
[1:52] but just when I thought it was darkest
[1:57] the sun began to rise
[2:02] cause Canyons
[2:05] wide Oceans
[2:08] Deep can't continue
[2:13] [Music]
[2:30] where can I run that you wanna run after
[2:34] me oh how could I fall when you already
[2:39] took the fall for me beyond the stars to
[2:45] the very breath I breathe
[2:48] there's nowhere to your love for me
[2:54] where could I run
[2:57] that you wanna run after me after me
[3:00] how could I fall when you already took
[3:04] the fall for me beyond the stars to the
[3:09] very breath I breathe
[3:14] [Music]
[3:24] can't contain all your love for me no
[3:31] matter how high or far I reach there's
[3:37] no ways to your love for me your love
[3:44] for me
[3:48] oh there's nothing like your love
[3:55] foreign
[4:00] s chapter 3 and verse 16.
[4:04] that he would Grant you according to the
[4:07] riches of his glory to be strengthened
[4:10] with might by his spirit
[4:12] where in the Inner Man we know we have
[4:16] an outer man we know we have this flesh
[4:19] but where we need to be strengthened is
[4:21] in the Inner Man
[4:22] and we actually need to be living every
[4:25] day from the inner man we need to be
[4:28] operating from the inner man how many
[4:30] would like to live that way
[4:32] so his theme is the inner man then he
[4:35] says that Christ May dwell in your
[4:37] hearts by faith that ye being rooted and
[4:41] grounded in love rooted how many wants
[4:45] to be rooted and grounded in love
[4:47] amen that's a good motive that's a good
[4:49] source where everything is is happening
[4:52] and your reactions to everything it's
[4:54] the Divine Capstone love of God that's
[4:56] what's rooted that's what that's at the
[4:58] roots of who you are in the inner man
[5:00] that you may be able to comprehend I
[5:03] want you to notice that word comprehend
[5:04] because that's that's understanding
[5:06] that's understanding of things that you
[5:09] may be able to understand with All
[5:11] Saints what is the breath and length and
[5:14] depth and height of what to know the
[5:17] love of Christ which passeth knowledge
[5:20] that ye might be filled with all the
[5:23] fullness of god notice verse 19 is what
[5:25] I've been preaching on a little bit and
[5:27] that the love of God Divine love that
[5:29] which is within us will pass knowledge
[5:32] in other words you can't let your
[5:34] thoughts interrupt what the love of God
[5:35] wants to do let me remember that from
[5:37] last Sunday I think I preached on when
[5:40] When Love is motivating you and it
[5:42] begins to move in your heart and it's
[5:43] divine love go with it
[5:45] what interrupts it our own thinking
[5:48] this proves that by scripture when he
[5:50] says to know the love of Christ which
[5:52] passeth knowledge the love of God can go
[5:55] Way Beyond what your mind can do
[5:57] it's more powerful than your mind can
[6:00] you say man it passes all knowledge
[6:02] we're so uh bent in this generation to
[6:05] use our minds and all these other things
[6:07] and and God gave us a mind but you see
[6:09] when it interrupts the love of God and
[6:10] the leading of the Holy Spirit that's
[6:12] when we're in trouble
[6:14] so this love passeth knowledge that ye
[6:17] might be filled with all the fullness of
[6:19] God how many you want to be filled with
[6:20] the fullness of God now unto him that is
[6:23] able to do exceedingly abundantly above
[6:27] all that we could ask or here we are
[6:30] again
[6:31] think
[6:32] this love can go beyond what you could
[6:35] even think about doing
[6:37] okay that's why we need to liver that
[6:39] you'll be able to unto him that is able
[6:42] to do exceedingly abundantly above all
[6:45] that we ask or think according to the
[6:48] power that worketh where it's working in
[6:51] us the the theme out of the four or five
[6:53] verses that I read is that we live from
[6:55] the inner man the inner man be
[6:57] strengthened so you have the inner man
[6:58] you had your life rooted and grounded in
[7:01] love and may we may be able to
[7:03] comprehend which is understanding you
[7:06] have the theme of understanding and then
[7:09] we have the love of Christ that passes
[7:10] knowledge and can do above whatever we
[7:13] ask or think so there are some elements
[7:15] key elements in that scripture that I'm
[7:18] going to pull out in some other
[7:19] scriptures and I want to speak as a
[7:21] theme this morning this is my subject
[7:23] Divine love seeks out truth and
[7:27] understanding Divine love seeks truth
[7:30] and understanding I want to delve into
[7:32] that and speak about it because a lot of
[7:35] times our mind and we're thinking only
[7:37] with our mind without the love of Christ
[7:39] without the Holy Ghost our minds will
[7:41] come to a certain place there because
[7:43] they're limited
[7:45] um they will stop at certain points and
[7:48] it'll only goes so far but Divine love
[7:51] is always seeking for more truth and
[7:55] seeking for a greater understanding
[7:58] of every situation first of all it seeks
[8:02] a greater understanding of God
[8:04] if you're understanding in Revelation of
[8:06] God is limited then that's going to
[8:08] eventually bring trouble so we should
[8:10] always be saying Lord increase my
[8:12] Revelation and understanding of you
[8:14] first Corinthians 10 1 moreover Brethren
[8:16] I would not that ye should be ignorant
[8:18] how that all of our fathers were under
[8:20] the cloud and all passed through the sea
[8:22] and were all baptized unto Moses the
[8:25] prophet in the cloud and in the sea and
[8:27] did all eat the same spiritual drink and
[8:30] did all drink the same spiritual drink
[8:32] for they drink of that spiritual rock
[8:34] that followed them and that rock was
[8:36] Christ now can anybody hear some of our
[8:38] history in the last days in the first
[8:40] four verses they have a cloud they have
[8:43] a prophet can you say Amen they all eat
[8:45] they all seen the same Miracles under
[8:47] the prophet they had a journey to come
[8:50] out of Egypt the message called them out
[8:52] of Egypt they got all that they got the
[8:54] cloud in the sky they got the pillar of
[8:56] fire at night they drank from the
[8:57] spiritual rock that was Rock was Christ
[8:59] they all enjoyed and this is this is our
[9:02] history now look at the history here now
[9:04] verse 5 but with many of them God was
[9:07] not well pleased for they were
[9:09] overthrown in the wilderness these
[9:11] things were examples to the intent that
[9:13] we should not lust after evil things as
[9:15] they lust it neither be idolaters as
[9:18] were some of them as it was written the
[9:20] people sat down to eat and drink and
[9:22] Rose up to play neither let us commit
[9:24] fornication as some of them committed
[9:26] and fell in one day three and twenty
[9:28] thousand neither let us tempt Christ as
[9:31] some of them also tempted and were
[9:33] destroyed as serpents neither murmur ye
[9:35] as some of them also murmured and were
[9:37] destroyed of the destroyed this is I
[9:40] didn't want this to be a part of our
[9:42] history but I can tell you the same
[9:44] people that Wonder a prophet had these
[9:46] characteristics as well
[9:49] idolaters yes
[9:51] not the world not out the systems The
[9:55] People Under The Prophet
[9:57] to people under the cloud idolaters
[10:00] murmurs complaining tempting the Lord
[10:02] you know how they tempt the Lord they
[10:04] said is the Lord even among us or not
[10:06] that's tempting the Lord
[10:09] now all these things happen unto them
[10:11] for examples and they were unto us for
[10:13] examples and they were written for our
[10:15] admonition our rebuke upon whom the ends
[10:18] of the world are come so we see the
[10:20] history we see it it types us we see all
[10:23] those things happen but notice verse 12
[10:25] wherefore let him that thinketh he stand
[10:30] take heed lest he fall the problem was
[10:35] in their thinking
[10:37] and so if you're going to take their
[10:39] example then it's going to go back to
[10:41] our thing let him a man thinketh he
[10:43] stand take heed lest he fall if you get
[10:46] lifted up in yourself and says you know
[10:48] I don't need this I don't need to
[10:49] respect this I'm better than this it was
[10:52] their thinking and trying to work out is
[10:54] God Among Us or not why does God give us
[10:57] all this to eat and then now we're
[10:58] thirsty I want to go back to Egypt it
[11:00] was childlessness and what the
[11:02] childlessness was is they were using
[11:04] their own thinking to process the
[11:07] message
[11:10] they were still after 40 years were
[11:13] using too much of their own thinking to
[11:16] process God and you can't use your mind
[11:19] to try to process God you won't figure
[11:22] it out you're going to be confused
[11:26] you can't let your mind abort the
[11:29] knowledge and what God's trying to do
[11:31] you don't think we have murmuring and
[11:32] complaining you don't think we have
[11:34] people committing a fornication well I
[11:36] don't live in fornication out you know
[11:38] fornication is a young person living
[11:39] with another with a girl with a mate
[11:41] without being married to you we don't
[11:43] believe in that the Bible forbids it's
[11:45] against fornication if they're living
[11:47] with a man or a woman out of wedlock
[11:49] they're living in sin they're living in
[11:51] fornication how many still believe that
[11:55] okay it's your Bible can you say man but
[11:58] these had a fornication and it isn't
[11:59] always just physical fornication but
[12:02] they committed it sometimes it's
[12:04] spiritual fornication sometimes it's
[12:06] idolatry sometimes it's a different type
[12:08] of idolatry we have all this but where
[12:10] is the problem if you're going to take
[12:12] an example the problem is let a man take
[12:15] heed in his thinking when he thinketh he
[12:18] stand take heed lest he fall and they
[12:21] all fell in the wilderness even though
[12:23] they were under a prophet Psalms 106
[12:26] verse 7.
[12:29] our fathers David talking about our
[12:32] history the history of the Jews our
[12:34] fathers understood not thy wonders in
[12:37] Egypt they remembered not the multitude
[12:40] of thy mercies but provoked him at the
[12:42] sea even at the Red Sea but that's the
[12:44] scripture he used as a text God being
[12:46] misunderstood because they misunderstood
[12:49] God and didn't understand the Wonders
[12:52] and didn't understand what God was doing
[12:53] this is how they got into all this
[12:55] trouble quick with me go with back with
[12:58] me to the New Testament to Colossians
[13:00] chapter 2 if you would and as I said I'm
[13:02] just laying these in as a foundation and
[13:05] then we can move on but I want you to
[13:07] catch the themes they didn't understand
[13:10] Colossians chapter 2 and verse 1 says
[13:13] for I would that that ye knew what great
[13:16] conflict I have for you and for them at
[13:19] laodicea for as many as have not seen my
[13:22] face in the flesh that their hearts
[13:24] might be comforted being knit together
[13:27] in love and unto all all Riches of the
[13:31] full Assurance of what understanding the
[13:35] full Assurance of understanding
[13:37] to the acknowledgment of the mystery of
[13:40] God and the father and our Christ and
[13:43] that is the is the uh is a more intimate
[13:46] understanding of the mystery of God all
[13:49] of us need a more intimate understanding
[13:53] of the mystery of God
[13:55] and that's when you have your hearts
[13:57] knitted in love in whom are all hid the
[13:59] treasures of wisdom uh and knowledge
[14:04] and they will just leave it there but
[14:05] here's the same thing understanding
[14:07] here's the same thing love
[14:10] knitted together in love
[14:12] understanding growing Divine love seeks
[14:15] truth and seeks understanding that's
[14:17] what we're growing in in this Divine
[14:19] love our hearts being knit together oh
[14:21] how we love have a greater knit together
[14:24] knit together by what by Divine love not
[14:28] separating from one another but our
[14:31] hearts knit together by love you'll
[14:33] never get everybody together in their
[14:34] minds there's too many opinions and and
[14:37] mine are probably just as bad as yours
[14:38] but if we can lay opinions aside and lay
[14:41] our thinking aside and our complexes and
[14:44] our reading into things and say let
[14:46] Divine love knit our hearts together let
[14:50] this Supernatural thing happen Among Us
[14:53] but it comes by understanding one
[14:56] another and God deeper and if you won't
[14:58] take the time to understand somebody
[15:00] you're going to remain trapped in what
[15:03] you think of them
[15:04] all of these are a theme of
[15:06] understanding love and they go together
[15:07] so with that scriptural basis now
[15:10] I'm presenting to you that Divine love
[15:12] when it's moving in you
[15:14] will always seek out the truth and true
[15:17] understanding it will always keep
[15:20] seeking more truth and understanding
[15:23] whether it's of God or whether it's of
[15:25] the other person
[15:27] and as the truth comes out and as more
[15:30] understanding comes out there's so many
[15:32] factors to something that happens
[15:35] and uh so a lot of people don't wait for
[15:38] the true facts to come in they just
[15:40] their mind concludes bang that's it
[15:42] that's what happened and then they
[15:44] categorize that person put them in a
[15:46] certain place you know they must be
[15:47] Serpentine
[15:49] we don't have a right to do that
[15:52] he must be this way he must be that way
[15:54] and we conclude lacking information
[15:56] lacking understanding of it can you say
[15:58] man and and so there's a lot of factors
[16:00] to something that takes place in your
[16:02] life and uh you know something something
[16:04] happens sometimes when people 30 40
[16:08] years later in a family usually it's in
[16:11] family situations and something happened
[16:13] way back then and there was a
[16:15] disturbance and there was a disagreement
[16:16] and and so everybody Drew their lines in
[16:20] the sand everybody dug their heels in
[16:22] and I've talked to family members and
[16:24] say I've even talked to that person in
[16:26] 30 years since that incident I haven't
[16:28] talked to them in 30 years and not every
[16:30] situation is this way but some
[16:32] situations are is that somehow something
[16:35] happens where the more truth comes out
[16:37] and more understanding and they talk
[16:39] they're at a birthday party and they
[16:40] just talk and the other person says well
[16:42] I did this because of this and I was it
[16:44] and all of a sudden the other person
[16:45] goes I didn't know that
[16:48] I didn't know that's why you did that
[16:52] and now more after 30 years there's an
[16:55] understanding
[16:57] of what really took place and the facts
[17:01] we don't even go we're we're going to go
[17:03] with it when he when we don't even have
[17:04] all the facts in but I want to say this
[17:07] even when you got facts even when
[17:09] somebody has sinned
[17:10] even when you know that's the facts they
[17:13] did it I'm reminding you of Jesus when
[17:16] the Pharisees brought that woman they
[17:17] had facts they caught her in the ACT I'm
[17:20] going to say to you that the love of
[17:22] Christ is even greater than that
[17:25] it's greater than the truth there's
[17:27] forgiveness in it and it's greater than
[17:29] the facts you may stand there in your
[17:30] mind I got facts that's it it's truth it
[17:33] happened they did me wrong they sinned
[17:34] it's over not with the love of Christ
[17:36] it's never over got the facts you got
[17:39] scissors and then here's another thing
[17:41] you've got if you have all the facts you
[17:44] got that person's heart you you can have
[17:46] something happen and not know the
[17:48] person's heart sometimes can you say man
[17:51] not know where they're at not under not
[17:53] understand where they were coming from
[17:56] during that time and misread and
[17:58] misinterpret and misunderstand
[18:01] why they acted that way it's not to
[18:03] justify sin but we should be seeking to
[18:06] know the full facts and know the
[18:08] understanding of the person's heart
[18:11] this is divine love
[18:13] this is what divine love does
[18:15] because when you got a full
[18:16] understanding of it then you really know
[18:18] how to pray you really know how to act
[18:21] you really know how to respond correctly
[18:23] instead of your mind figuring it all out
[18:26] and you're concluding isn't it time that
[18:29] we're operating from Divine love isn't
[18:31] it time that our denominational
[18:33] differences end
[18:35] isn't it time that we quit lifting up
[18:38] big preachers and making little ones
[18:40] more little and isn't it time to grow
[18:42] out of all this childishness
[18:48] isn't this the final end operating from
[18:51] the inward man every individual
[18:53] operating including preachers operating
[18:55] from the Inman inward man
[18:58] I can tell you everything possible
[19:00] everything is possible when coming from
[19:02] that inward man all things are possible
[19:04] but most the time I wonder if we're not
[19:06] giving him a chance to operate we're all
[19:09] Christians this morning we all love God
[19:11] we're lovely people you're all lovely
[19:13] people I love you all of you I hope you
[19:16] you love me I believe you do but I
[19:18] wonder how many decisions every day and
[19:20] actions are made in our life from
[19:22] another source than your inward mind
[19:25] that's what Thrills me about the grace
[19:27] of God today
[19:29] I'm thrilled about the grace of God
[19:31] because we have his favor
[19:35] to receive preaching like this
[19:40] we are favored of God to hear what God
[19:46] wants to give us through the ministry
[19:48] and through what we read in our Bibles
[19:49] and study the word we are favored
[19:51] because he's going to give us
[19:52] instruction and he's going to lead us if
[19:55] we'll yield into a life of let this mind
[19:59] be in you which is also in Christ Jesus
[20:01] and that we're LED from the inward man
[20:04] his grace is going to lead us there if
[20:06] we'll submit
[20:08] submissions got such a bad word to it
[20:10] a bad connotation today it's a Biblical
[20:13] word
[20:17] no matter how many decisions so it
[20:18] Thrills me of the Grace today we are we
[20:20] have his favor and listen to this
[20:22] despite this overwhelming influence of
[20:25] our flesh the overwhelming influence of
[20:27] our minds the overwhelming influence of
[20:30] our past our fears our abuse from other
[20:33] people are people that have
[20:36] targeted us our mistakes our sins our
[20:40] weaknesses our inbred family sins and
[20:43] strains in our family our pride and if
[20:46] you are eliminating you from any of
[20:48] these I'm reading you've got too much
[20:50] pride all of us have this
[20:55] say Amen or ouch or something
[20:59] inbred weaknesses from family inbred
[21:01] strains and family Pride a family Pride
[21:04] a religious Pride our fleshly atmosphere
[21:06] we live in our laodicean age of laziness
[21:09] spiritually our dirty sex appeal-driven
[21:11] world it's a dirty sexual uh perverted
[21:14] world can you say man our material and
[21:17] money driven America that everything's
[21:19] about the Mighty Dollar you take all
[21:22] that and God's grace still comes down to
[21:24] us and said but I want you to live from
[21:27] the Imran
[21:29] I'm calling to you to something higher
[21:31] it's not your possessions it's not your
[21:34] businesses it's not how somebody has
[21:36] done you wrong that's all lesser things
[21:38] let's let loose of lesser things let's
[21:40] let it go and get to living from Divine
[21:43] love
[21:44] how many conclusions have we made about
[21:46] God and others that did not have the
[21:48] full truth to them
[21:52] how many years ago did it happen
[21:55] and there are stories like I said that
[21:56] go on for years and then all of a sudden
[21:58] there's an understanding
[22:00] and there's been walls up for years been
[22:01] hatred for years and then somehow it
[22:03] gets talked about and ends up that the
[22:05] whole thing was a complete
[22:06] misunderstanding no one took the time to
[22:10] be adults
[22:12] and sit down and seek the full story
[22:19] there's something about
[22:21] wants to conclude about things there's
[22:24] something about our thing that wants to
[22:25] bring a final judgment on stuff
[22:28] and really only God has the final say
[22:32] God has the final judgment on matters we
[22:35] should be able to judge matters Paul
[22:37] said that to the Corinthians you
[22:38] shouldn't be going to law with one
[22:39] another you should be judge matters
[22:41] amongst yourself in other words he's
[22:42] saying you should have the maturity to
[22:45] work it out the judge matters it's
[22:46] settled it's done we're going on with
[22:48] the Lord
[22:49] but no nobody wants to sit down and be
[22:51] adults about it and our mind wants to
[22:54] judge it wants to conclude and it wants
[22:56] to put people in a category I don't know
[22:58] why we're bent that way but we are our
[23:00] thinking without the love of God listens
[23:03] out to a status of God itself
[23:07] our minds are the facts the law our
[23:10] minds bring the facts
[23:13] our minds are the lawyer our minds are
[23:15] the jury and our minds are the judge and
[23:19] our minds are the sentence
[23:22] we got a whole Court in our imagination
[23:24] in our mind but it can interrupt it can
[23:25] judge it can sentence it can bring a
[23:27] final judgment on something and our
[23:29] minds are too limited and and not
[23:31] infinite they're finite and they're
[23:33] they're not infinite like gauze and it's
[23:35] quite often because God knows all things
[23:37] he's the infinite God he knows every
[23:39] hair of your head of everybody's head
[23:41] you don't understand infinite like that
[23:44] he knows everything he knew it from the
[23:46] beginning your mind don't know that
[23:51] quite often
[23:53] that our minds becomes the whole justice
[23:55] system and it becomes like the justice
[23:57] system in our world that is not very
[23:59] balanced and doesn't get to the full
[24:01] truth sometimes
[24:03] our thinking becomes a filter besides
[24:05] events that never get a full
[24:06] understanding it filters all future
[24:09] events through that filter did you hear
[24:12] what I said our thinking becomes a
[24:14] filter besides events that never get a
[24:17] full understanding it filters all future
[24:19] events through that filter to where
[24:22] there's no trust
[24:24] but I'm preaching to you the love of God
[24:26] and the love of God is not that way and
[24:28] it seeks truth and it seats
[24:30] understanding of one another
[24:32] can you say man
[24:34] this is a presence that seeks out and is
[24:37] mature enough to fully understand before
[24:39] it makes a judgment call and then it's a
[24:42] power to wash all sin away and wash it
[24:45] away to forgive and not just forgive to
[24:49] be reconciled because how many know if
[24:51] you've studied it there's a difference
[24:52] in forgiveness and Reconciliation you
[24:55] can forgive somebody but not be
[24:56] reconciled you say well how can I
[24:58] reconcile somebody who doesn't reconcile
[25:00] that's not your fault that's their fault
[25:02] but Divine love is not only seeking
[25:05] forgiveness and repentance it's seeking
[25:07] reconciliation
[25:10] I must bring that if I can do everything
[25:12] to bring that together to understand to
[25:14] forgive and bring the fellowship that
[25:16] Satan doesn't get in between us I must
[25:18] bring it together as best I can
[25:21] and if they shut it down that I've done
[25:23] my part to express the love of God but
[25:25] we should not stop at forgiveness
[25:28] my relationship with the Lord did not
[25:31] stop when he forgave me I have been
[25:33] reconciled in Fellowship back to my god
[25:36] there are no walls between us there is
[25:39] no guilt if I sit and make a mistake I
[25:42] bring it quickly under the blood and I'm
[25:44] right back in Fellowship again this is
[25:46] the three basis for relationship true
[25:48] repentance
[25:49] true forgiveness
[25:51] and true reconciliation and the mind
[25:54] even says no I'm not going to go talk to
[25:56] that person no I'm not going to go try
[25:57] to resolve this I'm not going to do it
[25:59] your mind says that because we're afraid
[26:01] of Confrontation
[26:03] they're not they're not going to listen
[26:05] anyway
[26:07] it's all here this isn't down here
[26:10] it's all here it's not worth it I don't
[26:12] like confrontation I just I'm an easy
[26:14] going fella you know just let everything
[26:17] just happen and there's only thing one
[26:19] thing I can see in the scriptures
[26:20] sometimes that would make us be silent
[26:22] and that's when Jesus was falsely
[26:24] accused and he opened not his mouth
[26:28] but most other things and sometimes even
[26:30] that you're seeking understanding
[26:33] and you're seeking reconciliation this
[26:35] is what the love of God does but there's
[26:38] not enough adulthood sometimes to sit
[26:40] down work it out clear it out move on
[26:41] the Mind stops you from doing just the
[26:44] brotherly love thing which I can give
[26:45] you several scriptures someone has ought
[26:47] against you someone has overtaken in a
[26:49] fault ye with your spiritual goal
[26:51] restores that to one in the spirit of
[26:53] meekness considering yourself lest you
[26:55] fall also I don't see this happening a
[26:57] lot
[27:00] we're too scared to do it our mind
[27:01] interrupted our mind aborts it
[27:04] I imagine says ever just leave it alone
[27:07] not always we shouldn't always leave it
[27:09] alone
[27:10] the scripture encourages us to try to
[27:12] resolve scripture says go to another one
[27:14] go to another one the mind and doctors
[27:16] exalts itself said I don't really need
[27:19] them anyway in my life
[27:21] or I tried I tried to do it I text them
[27:24] and said hello and they never
[27:27] reconciled with me
[27:29] you text them and said hello that was an
[27:32] effort to reconcile
[27:34] that's it they're done you know I tried
[27:36] you did
[27:41] no spending time to really resolve it
[27:45] this is something to advise to all of
[27:48] our Lives brothers and sisters all of
[27:50] our Lives there's so many examples now
[27:51] that I could give you in my life so that
[27:54] I'm not preaching at you I'm preaching
[27:55] it myself of misunderstandings and a
[27:58] lack of understanding for the heart and
[28:01] red things the wrong way because of not
[28:04] fully understanding
[28:06] and lack of this can damage the family
