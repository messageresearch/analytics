========================================

the little ones a chance deuteronomy chapter 1 and verse 35 surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land which i swear to give unto your fathers save caleb the save caleb the son of jephena he shall see it and to him will i give the land that he had trodden upon and to his children because he hath wholly followed the lord so catch what he's saying here that that god is saying through moses that none of that generation of the parents will go into the full promised land and he ex he'll explain it later but none of them will go in save caleb and his children and verse 38 but joshua the son of ma son of none he'll go in which standeth before me he shall go in thither encourage him for he shall cause israel to inherit so god says none of that generation will go into the promise but caleb and joshua verse 39 moreover your little ones which ye said should be a prey and your children which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil they shall go in thither and unto them will i give it and they shall possess it i want to speak on giving the little ones a chance heavenly father bless your word bless the precious souls that have come to hear your word some here and some online and i pray you'll find them where they're at in their lives and minister to them lord because your word when it's spoken lord it's already been spoken by the prophets it's spoken today it's re-spoke again today through one of the members of the fifo ministry but lord when it is spoken it is so powerful that you said it will not return void it will bring a fruit from it so i pray it would go forth today with no agendas with nothing tainted nothing none of my motives in it lord just appear just the way that you said it and may you give revelation and strength to every person here every person here has a story every person here has a background they have something that they're comfort they've come from whether bad or good or whatever it is every person has their own story but lord how how wonderful when you interrupt that story and bring redemption into their story there's nothing lord that you can't redeem there's nothing lord that you can't restore and you're the one that says i will give you beauty for ashes you give me your ashes i'll give you beauty back and i'll give you the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness these are the things in the trade that you give us lord we come and receive it this morning may your anointing come and speak through us we pray in jesus name we ask him amen amen once you shake somebody's hand before you're seated god bless you all in the name of the lord now the setting here this morning is of course god's prophet moses and he is saying to the people of god in deuteronomy that god is angry and he's expressing that to say i want to let you know that god is angry with something and what god was angry with was the the generation that didn't take a hold of god's promise they didn't want to go into god's full promise they they sell themselves shorter they complained and they said we can't go in even though it's been promised by god there's too many hurdles to it and so god over time in the wilderness became angry with this particular generation because they wouldn't go take the land they wouldn't take a hold of this thing they wouldn't take the promise and go take the promise that god had said this is your land and it doesn't matter the obstacles it doesn't matter what's in front of you i've promised it to you and so you can go take that land but we see there's a whole generation that's that that cut themselves short in other words they wouldn't take a hold of the whole thing they stayed in the wilderness and they they wouldn't go take the full promise god was actually uh grieved uh hebrews says i was grieved with that whole generation and i want you to remember this is the generation that's not out in the world or not in egypt this is the generation that come in under a prophet under a message and took them out of egypt and yet they stopped short of the full promise and god said i was grieved with that generation i was grieved with him and he still showed them miracles he still delivered them he still gave them water when they needed water he still gave them food when they needed food he performed many supernatural things but why was he grieved because the people that generation refused to go all the way into their promise and so now god says through the prophet god is angry and god's displeased with that generation because they didn't go in and catch this they even sent spies agents he had to be there yesterday they sent spies into the land to see if it was true what moses the prophet had said so catch this now everything moses said they sent spies in and they went and and they come back and they said they said it's all there the promise is there and here's the evidence they brought back evidence what the prophet said is true and here's the evidence of it and still with the evidence there was men that influenced these parents there was men that said yes it's there but we can't do it well why can't we do it because there's an enemy there's obstacles there's giants there's great walled cities and that intimidated them and so the parents became influenced by certain people on the internet that was bringing a bad rap on the promise i said the parents were influenced to hold them back from going completely into their land because somebody influenced him to say nobody can go that far we can't make it into that there's too many obstacles no person can live that way and so they made a decision actually our children are actually safer here in the wilderness because i i looked that up in numbers 14 3 because he says here he said you said that your children will be a prey if you go into the land your children the parents are saying if i go do that my children will be a prey to the enemy and so they said the children my children won't be safe and they i was wondering if they said that and of course if god said they said it they said i just had to find it and in numbers 14 3 numbers 14 3 this is what they said and wherefore hath the lord brought us into this land this is what the people were saying this generation wherefore hath the lord brought us into this land the wilderness to fall by the sword that our wives and our children should be a prey were it not better for us to return to egypt can you imagine the mentality and attitude that god supernaturally brought them out opened the red sea drowned pharaoh's army and now they're complaining and saying our children are not even going to be safe out here or in the promised land wouldn't it be better if we go back to egypt no wonder god was grieved with those people no wonder god was grieved that they would pass down this doubt to their children and say stay away from that that's not a good thing that's not a good influence and you'll be a prey if you get around that too much let's just stay right here and so they the parents were influenced by other people who put a doubt on god's message of the land i said the parents were influenced by other people who put a doubt on god's message of the promise the obstacles are too big we can't do it fear gripped their heart and they said we can't do it and if we do our children will be a prey they actually said in the wilderness it'd be better for us to go can you imagine parents saying that our children are safer and better off in egypt under pharaoh i'm going to preach it i had a whole subject last night and the lord completely changed i know this is what the lord said for me to say and i'm going to tell you how how can how can message believers under moses message make a decision about their children to actually say our children were actually safer back in egypt under pharaoh what what a mentality that's a mentality that's a lie of the enemy that your children are safer back in egypt that's one of the greatest lies your children the safest place for your children is under the promise of the hour sent through a prophet [Applause] can you imagine parents saying that and following this prophet moses we're safer back in egypt and then following this prophet moses on some wild goose chase out here in the wilderness following this prophet we don't even know where we're going here we don't know if the land is there this is before they had evidence this we're just on a wild goose chase with and then then we got all these laws and rules that came from the mountain and every every time i turn around there's another commandment and there's another precept and it's pat and this and moses message was packed he's packed us with all kinds of laws how to live and even what to wear all this holiness from moses is legalism we were better in egypt were you if you label all of holiness legalism you're greatly deceived because when god brings true holiness first of all in the soul in the spirit and then on maybe on the outside god never brings it to make you a legalist god brings it for protection for safety for for gender separation can you say amen god knows human beings because he created human beings and when he brings a precept it's for our good and it's for our children's good i ought to be getting some greater amens than that it was a lie because their families were safer out in the wilderness with the pillar of fire by night and a cloud over them by a cloud by a day and a pillar of fire by night they were safer much safer even with the enemy fighting them against them fighting against them they were safer in the wilderness and safer in the promised land under a pillar of fire even in goshen just the outskirts of egypt when the death angel came they were safer there with the token applied to their home and he said that death angel won't strike your kid your firstborn if you've got the token the safest place for your children is under god's word now i'm preaching to parents first here but i'm going to get to real quickly that god has grace for the little ones and when the parents won't get a hold of this god says i'm gonna grace give grace and i'm gonna give a chance to the little ones can i get an amen this morning when parents mess it up and don't think i'm just preaching and beating up your parents this morning because remember there was a joshua there was a caleb of the older generation that went into the promise as well most of the parents just stayed in the wilderness but there were some parents there that said i want my mountain i want my land i'm taking me and my children into it i'm not afraid of this somebody's saying man this morning that's exactly the place that my children need to be is in the promise of the holy ghost and i'm going to keep them in the right environment i'm going to keep them in church i'm going to keep them around good fellowship and i'm going to pray them through to the promise which is the holy ghost because the promise is for me but it's not just for me it's for my children it's to a media far off even as many as the lord our god shall call amen so when these parents listened to other voices of doubt on the internet they said we're not going all the way in we're staying here in the borderline borderline believers borderline lifestyle we can't go back all the way to egypt now but we can stay here and they would not fully repent and take a full hold on the promise and that angered god and he said none of that generation will go in except except caleb joshua and another group your little ones your little ones your children i will give the little ones a chance at my word god's grace said i'm gonna give the little ones a chance now this is amazing because you know that there is a precept that moses said several times that the iniquities of the fathers would be visited upon the children unto the second and third generation how many reasons they hadn't heard that precept the iniquities of the father so there is a trickle-down effect of what you do as parents if if you don't get deliverance if you don't overcome things it'll trickle down to further generations oh yeah god said it can you say amen so the iniquities of the fathers will be visited upon the children until the third and fourth generation so even with that principle that's there god still says i will steal even though that's there i will still give grace to the little ones i'll give them a chance at a revival i'll give them a chance of the promise it doesn't matter that the parents are toxic parents it doesn't matter that the parents are borderline believers i'm going to give them a chance to break the curse [Applause] and you know you sit here and say well i'm not a i'm not a dysfunctional parent we're all dysfunctional people because our parents adam and eve were dysfunctional come on now our parents adam and eve were dysfunctional toxic parents and we're children all that we inherited the the nature of the serpent because of our parents adam and eve falling everybody one of us inherited that no matter no wonder we get into trouble can you say that and so so so like as i said i'm not belittling this morning i'm just saying god says if the parents mess up i'm going to give grace to the little ones to have a chance to take the promise themselves and we see it today in many cases where a child or teenager rises up and said listen my my parents only went so far and that's fine that's between them and god but i'm gonna take a hold of this promise i'm gonna take a hold of this word god fill me with your spirit i'm gonna take a hold of this word the people are putting it down the people are putting motorists down there's all kinds of internet sites about it they're calling it this that and the other but listen god spoke through this man god is above us in a purifier god has been in a pillar of cloud and so god is in this and i'm going to take a hold of it for myself praise the lord none of that generations of parents will go in but the little ones will and i was inspired by this by sister cher and my sister as she shared this to her volunteers a couple nights ago that part of her vision and she said god said that the parents would not go in but i'm going to leave a promise for the kids i'm going to promise them i'm gonna give them a chance sharon mentioned it and it just triggered me first of all i was saying i need to go check that out i need to check her out see if that's in there and i did and it was and i read it to you this morning god said that generation that just confused things that generation has all the stuff and trust me you know me as a pastor i could take the next hour and show the the the the complication and the the lack of simplicity and to and the trouble and the bitterness that's in parents today and what the shame is is they pass that down to their children to carry on and i'm going to say to you clearly this morning that's not fair to do that they deserve a pure chance at this message they deserve a trust in the preachers a trust in the right men of god there's wrong men of god there's right men of god and your children my dad used to say it this way be careful what you say against the preachers because he said when you're not able to help your kid someday someday that minister may be able to help your kid and if you put them down then you lose a chance for them to be able to minister when you can't minister to them the kids are going to rise up i'm going to give them grace i'm going to give them a chance they can break this curse handed down by their parents i'm going to give them the promise a chance at the promise none of that generation and parents will go in but the little ones i will i will give them and god said the parents would not go in but i'm leaving a promise if god i'm moving along now if god gives them a chance listen if god gives them a chance i think we should give them a chance can i get it amen if god gives them a chance despite what's happened in the past i think we should give them a chance i think we should give them a fresh start untainted not mixed with anything you come from things that were mixed up and diluted i think the kids deserve a better chance to take a look at it and a chance specifically at receiving christ a fresh start to not carry on with all the bitterness from the past and carry on the same grudges i don't think it's fair to pass our to pass our past ju our past grudges onto our children i don't think it's right to pass pass our past judgments and grudges to our children there's an andy griffith episode that i like and it's an episode where there's two families from generations feuding with each other it's not called the hatfields and mccoy we know that was a real feud that took place somewhere in west virginia but this was the names were different i don't remember the names but these two families are fighting for generation after generation you know in north carolina and so they're going back and forth so so then uh two young people wanted to get married from both sides and i love this episode because annie griffith starts to get into it he's going to marry him they show up with guns at one another pointing guns at one another this ain't gonna happen we've never married that other family we're staying this is a tradition carried on this is a feud and they were expecting their children and the next generation to carry on the same feud from all the generations back and so andy uh the sheriff he researches it and goes back into the history books found some things out and he talks the heads of these two families and brings them together and he says i've done some research and come to find out in all the years of the threats between these families nobody's ever taken a shot and killed another one but there's a lot of threats i'm going to kill them i'm going to get rid of they're holding their guns at one another i'm going to take a anybody here that's offended at me bringing up andy griffith give me grace please just write it off as my problem it's just to bring a point and a point that should be received because boy do we ever get feuds between families and threats but the worst part of it is you pass your feud onto your children that's why i've always said about young people i like them because they can get together and sometimes parents can't come together in a meeting because they're different beliefs and all these other things i'm not going to meet i'm not going to do that but the young people they can get together because they don't have all those pa that history can you say man they can get together and worship and accept one another and get a hold of god i like that about the young people i don't know what happened to you 20 years ago but i'm gonna go fellowship and enjoy the word of god i can be with those people i can handle those people i can pray with those people sometimes brotherly love shows up more in the young people and so we find they were fighting and so he says listen guys there's no history of anybody actually taking out this is that true no that can't be true and so he said we're going to settle this forever we're going to have you guys walk away from one another with your guns and you're going to turn around you're going to shoot and you're going to we're going to get a shooting because you always talk about there's going to be a shoot and there's going to be a shooting i'm going to shoot that a hatfield i'm going to shoot them and also all of a sudden so they get in line and they go and they keep stopping them no we've got to stop but oh we got to stopped to keep stopping they didn't want to do it they couldn't follow through with their threats so to make a long andy griffith shore story short and he finally convinces them that if these two get married your offspring is actually going to be stronger with the two strong families you're really going to bring up a generation and they were sold and they showed up at the wedding and the feud was over why because they were looking at the future instead of the feud of the past [Applause] i'd like to make some points here and i'm not going to be long today i know we're tired from the last two days i'd like to make some points here of the events this week that just come to me last night last sunday we dedicated another baby precious little boy for kyle and laura thursday we had a law that's been in for 50 years reversed at least in the supreme court roe versus wade the abortion law after 50 years that happened thursday right on the very week this week when we would focus on our children that we would fight for our children that we would give them a chance that we'd take three or four days and focus off of one another and focus just on the children and i want to say thanks again for those who labored our ministers i've done it before when you're ministering four or five times of the same subject for two days it can wear you out to those children especially the little ones who don't have a great attention span but our ministers did great and i i want to give them a hand this morning for ministering to the children the bible basics amen but we're giving the little ones a chance and we had the in the same week after 50 years the abortion laws of roe versus wade gets overturned by the supreme court it's an amazing thing now it's a victory to many people it's a victory and i'll call it that this morning it's a victory it's something to rejoice so rejoice over can you say amen many forces have been worked at work for a long time the right to life many forces have been working for almost 50 years since the law came in to work against it it's a real victory for them they've worked hard to get this thing reversed and and i'm not supposed to be political here uh in case you're listening to this i'm not doing that i want to bring out the biblical point and show us that that when something is wrong especially for children i wouldn't call it a victory as much as i'd call it a rise of a fight to fight back and every once in a while we have a light in this country that rises up and begins to fight back when satan is so blatantly diablo is so blatantly trying to influence our children and dilute the formula the kids and everybody should know jaden is just playing that part he played it pretty well but to make it clear he's not diablo he's a brother and he believes in christ but the abortion laws and so so i want to say it's it's i don't i'm not calling it a full victory because we know scripturally the the the iniquity will heap up more and more and we still have it coming back to the states and and different states will decide different things but we we find that we'll call it a victory but it's more of a fight i don't think it's an ultimate victory as you know uh it it it's not an ultimate victory until you change hearts by the lord you're not gonna change anything until people's hearts are changed by the holy spirit and if you're listening here today on uh on the broadcast or anyone who's listening i just tell you you're not going to solve the problems of this nation it's almost too late as a nation the way that you can solve is the individuals getting the true genuine birth of the holy ghost in their lives and that's what changes the problems in our nation and so we see then that that i think it's a a an amazing thing to see that it changed and i see that victory take place but you're not going to have a full victory until you have the holy holy spirit in people's lives i would not call it a victory as much as i call it as fighting back a spirit in people to rise up and to fight back at the wave of sin in our country especially concerning our children there's a fight back from parents when they realize just through covet they realize what their children are being taught in the schools they weren't looking close enough and they're many of them were being surprised pulling their kids out of schools because they realize what are they doing to our children they're taking away our rights as parents they're influencing to transgender and all these other things they're trying to take our children's minds and there's a little light that rises up in paris to fight back and if that's happened on a little level around our country may god rise in the parents hearts today to fight back at the enemy coming against our kids [Applause] whatever it is that's happening then may parents rise to the occasion today to fight back at the enemy there's a fight back when they see what's being taught and the control the government has taken over our little ones four years old teaching their gender confusion teaching gender confusion disney movies that blatantly blatantly have same-sex same-sex couples there's a reaction to it and whenever there is a strong reaction i say thank god there's still some that have some discernment in this country there's still some little light shining i know this as a nation i know all the prophecies i know where it's going there's not going to be a national revival if some preacher tells you that it's not true it's not in in the bible for it to be a national revival the next revival is to israel god's people israel but there can be individual revivals and little little lights rise up and say i'm gonna fight back i'm gonna stand for my kids can i get an amen this morning 60 million abortions of babies since that law was passed 60 million and don't be offended if you're listening but i'm going to say this that's you could you could call it american style genocide as franklin graham called it i know some people will be offended at that that's listening but listen it's it's it's you have to call something what it is 60 million and if you study the generation that that pushed to pass that law back at that time it was a rebellious generation to the word people were rising up and bucking up against authority and buckingham gumps against government authority and bucking up against especially god's authority and his word and everything that was normal for years in his word it was a rebellious generation and the beatles outwardly through their songs and through the manner and the way they acted reflected that rebellion many rock groups but the beatles in particular don't be offended i'm speaking against the beatles but i'm trying to tell you the truth by by articles that were written they were the they were they were the front image of entire change in that generation being rebellious to the word of god and that was the generation that passed the law that now killed 60 million babies but praise god praise god there's a fighting back thank god for some light that's left to fight for the little ones the unborn but don't just fight for the unborn fight for the born fight for our children one thing for sure god is behind it because he can only take so much of satan killing the little ones god throughout the bible can only handle so much when satan takes the little ones there'll be other ones destroyed but when he tampers too much with the little ones and the children god rises up if the parents won't do it god rises up can you say amen not just as a nation but if that child has been abused or that child has come under the wrong thing god finally says that's enough i'm going to deal directly with that heart and i've watched young people come from terrible backgrounds and god connects with their heart and says i love you you can have a different life i've actually said it to him you've got to get past the past because god has a different blueprint for your life got a boy in this assembly that was left at four or five years old left on the street corner never seen his parents just left him there someone picked it up raised him in the admonition of the lord why because god said i won't leave that child alone i'll pick him up and now he's here today serving the lord i don't want to embarrass him but i'll tell you i watch this all the time if the parents won't do it god will get a hold of the heart of that child can you say amen and where we messed up because if you're an honest parent we're not all perfect parents we mess up we have to apologize to our kids there's only one perfect parent and that's god our father can you say amen but when we mess up we apologize but with all of our mess-ups god says i will deal with that child because he cares for the little ones anybody here in my message today my scripture for last sunday for the dedication was psalm 78 give your all my people to my law include incline your ears and i'm just about ready to close here in a minute give your o my people to my law incline your ears to the words of my mouth i will open my mouth in a parable i will utter dark sayings of old which we will hurt we have heard and known and our fathers have told us we will not hide them from their children showing to the generation to come the praises of the lord and his strength and his wonderful works that he hath done we're not going to hide that from our kids we're not going to give a bad impression can you say amen of the church of church people we're not going to do that we're going to declare god's strength we're going to declare the positive we're going to declare the wonderful works that god has done for he has established a testimony in jacob and appointed a law in israel which he commanded our fathers that they should make them known to their children they should make them known to their children that the generation to come might know them even the children which should be born who shall arise and declare them to their children that they might set their hope in god not forget the works of god but keep his commandments and might not be as their fathers a stubborn and rebellious generation i didn't read that last sunday in the dedication didn't really fit in a nice pleasant dedication but i'm reading it this sunday that are that these children that have a chance at the word might not be as their fathers stubborn rebellious a generation that set not their heart or right and whose spirit was not steadfast with god an inconsistent spirit one week they're in church the next week they're out one week they've got this priority next week that they're not steadfast in the word so god says i'm going to give the new generation a chance i'm giving the little ones a chance that they won't be as their fathers stubborn god's going to give the new generation a chance despite the rebellion of the parents that's what that scripture says there's another reference as i bring it down to a close and i know i promised that but i really truly am i've just got another couple quotes here here's another reference to the little ones and it's in the new testament and matthew 18 says this is jesus talking at the same time came the disciples unto jesus saying who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven and jesus called a little child unto them and set the child in the midst of them and said verily i send you except to be converted and become as little children ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven whosoever there shall therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven and whosoever oh my what a message jesus is sending us here when we become so intellectual that we talk ourselves right out of the message of the hour a lot of you said he amended the first statement but you didn't say amen to the second thing we complicate it we complicate it and jesus said unless you get to the place you receive it like this little child who doesn't know anything doesn't know good and evil but they know enough know that's god he's being real to me i'll just accept it my heart just accepts it i have no walls up to it i have no mental filter that i'm bringing it all through just receive it those of you sitting here this morning i appeal to you in the name of the lord that if you got too complicated that you reach your hand to the lord and say god take all the complicated things out of my mind and thinking let me come back again as a little child and restart give me another chance to relearn about christ whosoever shall humble himself as this little child the same as greatest in the kingdom of heaven and whosoever shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me but whosoever shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me it were better for him that a milestone millstone was hanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea that's pretty serious and it's saying that you can't hurt a child of god without hurting god you can't wrongly influence a child and not and god not get angry about it who sort of offends one of these innocent little ones and directs them you say well what does the word there offend me i'm glad you asked it means in the greek scandaliso and it means to put a stumbling block or impediment in the way upon which another may trip and fall to entice to sin there's actually parents that are that are teaching their children whether verbally or by their lifestyle to dabble in sinful things god doesn't like that because you're offending a little one it also means to cause i want you to listen close now to cause a person to begin to distrust and desert one whom he ought to trust and obey so here's the person in their life they should be trusting them listen our kids cannot trust that many things in life matter of fact there's almost nothing they can trust you can't trust government you can't trust the schools you can't trust some of the leaders in the schools there's hardly anything left to trust and trust is everything because you can't have confidence in someone to come forward with christ unless there's trust there's hardly any trust left in this world please don't take the one that they're supposed to trust and cast doubt on them is anybody listening this morning that's offending a little one is that someone they're supposed to trust someone they're supposed to uh to to obey to cause to fall away from that person and cause a person to distrust and desert one whom they ought to trust and obey goes on to say to be offended in one in essence to see in another what i disapprove of and what hinders me from acknowledging his authority to cause one to judge unfavorably or unjustly of another since one who stumbles or whose foot gets entangled feels annoyed to cause one displeasure at a thing to make in indignant to make the little one in indignant make them displeased you pass that down to them there's a lot of not a lot of things we can trust and i've said this before and it fits here i guess i'm not your enemy so don't make me the enemy i'm on your side i'm your friend there's not too many there's a lot of things that's your enemy in this world but don't make true men of god and the true body of christ don't make them the enemy to your children give them a chance to trust even though there's a lot of mistrust there's a lot of hurt there's a lot of people say stupid things sometimes but you teach your children that's the reality of life but don't cause them to have a wall up towards the true body of christ and to the true ministers and yet you can be friends with everybody else i didn't expect to be this specific today but i love you and i'm making a call to the parents let's give the little ones a fresh chance god does not feel too good about when the little ones don't have a chance they want they need a fresh start a fresh chance at the message of christ not brought through your filter of trash that you've seen in the church or hurt by leaders why talk about that in front of them why talk about the negative in front of them and pass down and offend one of these little ones keep it to yourself and now i'll take it further besides keeping it to yourself let brotherly love continue amen amen you got something between somebody go today and make it right get the air clear let brotherly love continue because they don't have it out there brother brahms said the only place true genuine victory and divine love love will be left is amongst the elect and that doesn't mean a message church it means the real elected people the only place genuine love would be left is among those people so i say let brotherly love continue got something to to clear the ear go do it go do that's a better example to our kids than holding a grudge for 10 years that brotherly love continued god dealt with me very deeply monday night about the antichrist spirit and i held it back but i want to speak on it because there's a there's a bit of a deception to say we always think the antichrist spirit it's out there it's in other churches the antichrist is going to be incarnate in this and we know all these truths and it's out there it's never here and i'm here to tell you it's among us trying to divide the brotherhood amen and how many would raise your hand and say i want that victory in capstone love i want my life to be capped with love thank you but the capstone only fits perfectly on brotherly kindness so if you want it how bad do you want it you can't skip a step because the capstone won't fit if you're missing brotherly kindness it only perfectly fits on something simply called brotherly kindness let brotherly love continue why is he saying that why is john i'm in the first second third book of john you can read it this week and get ready he's the only one that brings up the antichrist the term antichrist john john jude revelations the last three books of the bible deal with the antichrist spirit and their prophecies for us who would live amongst the antichrist spirit so we know what it is john draws a dividing line but why is he saying love one another his answer to the antichrist spirit is genuine a victory in genuine love fight against it fighting grandson antichrist spirit what do we fight against we don't fight carnality with carnality we don't fight fire with fire we don't fight it with an arrogant spirit john said we fight it with the real genuine victory in divine love that's how we fight the antichrist spirit i didn't expect to say that today but you can read it he keeps talking about love let brother love continue why does he have to say that because in our age it's going to be a fight it's going to be a fight to keep brotherly love continuing god's go god's going to be there but satan's going to be right there working in between us trying to divide us listen i'm closing there is a promise there is a promise if the older ones won't take it god gives a chance to the little ones [Applause] if the older ones won't take the full promise and take a hold of this thing that generation won't take a hold of it god gives grace to the new ones they're going to take it and in the new testament acts 2 i'll read it to you again repent be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promises unto you to your children to all that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call stop complicating the word and be praying that god will fill our children with the promise that he has left us the promise is for you but it's also for your children can you say amen that's the formula that's the formula they had in the play yesterday at the at the vacation bible school kids days the formula that that the agent had gideon what was his name gideon miles miles that's the formula it's repent be baptized you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost this never changed that's the formula it has power within it and diablo here was is always trying to dilute the promise and bring it down to oh if they just love the lord that's fine if they just do this if they shake the preacher's hand if they if they're going to church they're fine no no it's got to be deeper the formula has power in it the holy ghost has power in it and the formula is the promise from the book of acts until today we parents have a promise for our children that they shall be saved that they shall be repent that they shall be baptized in his name and that they should be filled with the holy ghost it's a promise how many parents will jump onto it this morning that promise was for me but it's for my children as well so in the new testament that's the promise it has power in it don't let any diablo dilute it down to something else it is the power of the holy spirit for our children but we should not settle for anything less than the formula can you say amen i talked about abortion and the prophet made a comment about it he says she didn't take abortion cases in the united states in 1954 she said she has done something she had an abortion she didn't give that this is how he words it and this is with my sermon that woman that took that abortion she done something she didn't give the little fella a chance to live so brother brandon just got described as abortion you're not giving that little fella a chance to live and that's a reflection of what's happening with the ones that are alive listen let's give the little ones a chance to live last quote and i believe they have it here each generation i'm closing on this each generation receiving because it's repeating back again from adam and eve again the first crop the garden of eden so he's referring back to adam and eve our first parents half of them lost wise virgins sleeping versions so coming up now to the prophecies of the end time half of them one kept the word the other one hybrid it right back and forth just as hard as they can go right like that it's been down through the age that's right hybriding hybriding diablo diluting the promise trying to dilute the formula hybriding is always there and it ends up over here in revelations at the second coming of christ now remember correctly that's why each generation has its own revival it gets a chance at the word every generation has a chance at a new revival despite denominationalism despite it even creeping in in our doors as well god says i'll raise up another generation and even though they've hybrid the word i'm going to give them a chance at the word i'm going to give them a chance at revival can you say praise the lord amen i'm done that's all i need to say today you know what i'm going to do children i'm gonna pray for the children all
