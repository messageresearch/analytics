========================================

Hello everyone. Pastor Paula Fontaine and Literal Life Church in Petersburg, Michigan would like to invite you to take the next half hour and enjoy some time in the word of God. If you're hungry for more God, we believe you can be fed. And we pray that you'll be blessed. Visit our website for more information at literalife.urch. May God bless you, my friend. May the music and message encourage you today. Do you ever find yourself asking God where he's been? Ever get up out of bed saying, "I can't do this again?" [Music] Have you ever been afraid of what tomorrow's going to bring? And you're facing it alone. At least that's what you think. I can tell you after going through that valley, even though I didn't see it at the time, it was in my weakest moments that he held me. and they know you'll find. He will carry you when you can't go on. He will be your strength when your strength is gone. He will lift you up. He will be enough to get you through. When the road is long and you want to quit cuz you think you've got nothing left to give, you can fall apart. Fall into his arms. He will carry you. [Music] And when you get the kind of news that you hoped you'd never hear. And when you're chasing down a dream just to watch it disappear. And when somebody that you love turns and walks away. and they leave you standing there with shattered faith. You don't have to pick up all the broken pieces. You don't have to try to cover up the scars. You are loved and you can always run to Jesus just as you are. He will car you when you can't go on. He will be your strength. When your strength is gone, he will lift you up. He will be enough to get you through. When the road is long and you want to quit, cuz you think you've got nothing left to give, you can fall apart. Fall into his arms. He will carry you. His Lord is never weary. No, he's never tired. Through the toughest fight, through the longest night, through the fight and through the fight, he will carry you when you can't go on. He'll be your strength when your strength is gone. He will lift you up. He will be enough to get you through. When the road is long and you want to quit, cuz you think you've got nothing left to give, you can fall apart. Fall into his arms. He will carry you. Oh, he will carry you. John 5 and verse 16. And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus and sought to slay him because he had done these things on the Sabbath day. He had just healed a man at the pool of Bethesda and he did it on the Sabbath day. So they were uh criticizing that. But Jesus answered them, "My father workketh here hitherto, and I work." Therefore, the Jews sought the more to kill him. Because he's not only he not only had uh broken the Sabbath, but said also that God was his father, making himself equal with God. So this is a a relevant scripture to realize when the devil he gets mad at miracles uh and he's technical about here about the Sabbath day. But the Bible says he really got upset when Jesus said his father was his father. That's when they really got more angry. So this is the thing that makes the devil more angry is when we start to call ourselves sons and daughters of God and he's our father. He doesn't like cuz that what that meant to them. If he says I'm his son, then I'm coe I'm equal with him. So, in some ways, they had a greater revelation back then of what that meant than even scholars today because if he says he's the son of God, then he was equal with God. And Satan hated that. They were very angry at that. They wanted to kill him. Then answered Jesus, and said unto them, verily, verily, I say unto you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do. For what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise. For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth him all things that himself doeth, and he will show him greater works than these, that ye may marvel. So, uh, that's my subject tonight is to recognize Jesus said the son can do nothing of himself. Now, remember Jesus had all the authority there and yet he was submissive under the father. This is where a son uh gets his authority to be able to properly use is when he's properly under the submission of the father and under the father's authority and actually would say I don't do anything. I don't act. I don't step out. I don't see any. I don't say anything unless my father tells me to say it. That's a submission of a son. Can you say amen? And then finish it by saying it's almost as he was saying 20. For the father loveth the son and showeth him all things that himself doeth. And he will show him greater works than these. And when I talk about the third pole a little bit tonight, when you see the term greater works, that's where we're at because it's something greater than what we've had before. greater works. So, a son here uh that you may marvel that a son will come into the greater works by his submission. Now, John chapter 8, it's real close there. It won't take you long to get there. 8 verse 28. John 8:28. Then said Jesus unto them, when ye have lifted up the Son of Man, then then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself. But as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things. And he that sent me is with me. The Father hath not left me alone. For I do always those things that please him. Under submission, I don't act. I don't step out until I know my father's given the cue to do so. There's a there's a there's an example of a son. The last time that we uh talked about things, we talked about waiting. Uh we talked about waiting a little bit. Remember I took the scripture back with Moses where uh it said stand still and see the glory of God just before they come to the Red Sea and it said stand still. And then just a few scriptures later God tells Moses speak and go forward. Why are you crying? And I tried to balance those out to say it's important when God knows we can wait for him to move then we can move into the thing of him saying speak and go forward. So one of the things that I want to bring out tonight and that's very we we find the subject of waiting becomes very important in the new ministry in the third poll I was saying something Sunday that one of God's greatest assets to find to show you his will is time. And sometimes the more time you give something, you can really try uh find his will. But if you don't give it much time and you rush through it, uh you you might find yourself out of the will of God. But over time, God can show you signs and show you things that vindicate this is right. I can move on this now. So the other reason that we learn to wait is that this work must be a sovereign work of God. Can you say amen? If there's any other thing to talk about that needs to be and we need to know it has to be his sovereign work which means um I didn't write it down but sovereign is his authority. He has complete authority. It has to be him. He's Lord God. And so when we're under that then when he does this and the first of all we learned about the third pole. There's no imitation to this. God doesn't give any hints to it to the devil because he'll impersonate it. This will not be impersonated. He gives no symbols, nothing to know. It's just something powerful he's going to he's doing and he will do in the bride. Satan can't get his hands on it. Can you say amen? And and and so we understand that it it it can't be something that said but also it cannot have any human element in it. It's got to be a sovereign work of God. Amen. So this is another reason that we learn as sons how to wait on this until God does it his way because it has to at the end of it we have to say this is the sovereign work of God. God did this. No preacher did this. Can you say now now mind you he's going to do it through us. But at the end of it we'll say this was his work in me. No human nobody takes the glory none of this thing going on. You know that I did this I did this. We'll all know this was God that came and did this and it had and even unbelievers can testify sometimes that had to be God. That wasn't human. Can you say amen? So, so that's another reason why it's important to wait under this third pole. It will be done in us, but it is only done sovereign by him. And we only act when he says to speak. We only step out and act when he says to speak. In other words, this work is not something that uh can be based in our own enthusiasm. This new ministry cannot be based in us acting out of fear because that's another it's not a good motivator. But fear, even in parenting, people use fear as a motivator. That's not a good motivator. And so, uh, in the third poll, we can't act and just step out and try to produce something out of fear or out of something's not going on. We can't step out on our own in our own enthusiasm. And while we wait for him, we don't push ahead to try to make things happen. We can't do that with this. We can't push ahead and say nothing's going on. And then also, we don't presume something God is saying and then act. We can't presume under this third Paul. We can't just use our enthusiasm. We can't step out by just our own fear. We're going to make something happen. We got enough here to go on and so we're going to push forward. We don't presume something God is saying and then we act on it. We don't put words in God's mouth. Is this the spoken word of God? Yes, it is. Will it be on our lips? Yes, it is. But we don't put words in God's mouth and say, "God said this and he didn't say it." Amen. We don't put words in God's mouth. We don't manipulate an outcome that we want. That's another thing you can apply to the will of God. You don't manipulate the outcome that you want and then turn around and call it the will of God. There's a neutrality in praying about the will of God. And he said, brother said, "Pray until you become neutral." He didn't even say, "Pray for your need yet or what the will of God is." He said, "No, he just said, you better pray first that you become neutral because a lot of people, they're not really neutral." And so we watch, you know, someone and I've had people say, "God told me to do this." And I don't want to mock that because we want to respect it, but I have had examples and probably all of us had examples that we acted in our own enthusiasm and we called it God. You know, God gets blamed for a lot of things. And it wasn't really him. It was more us our own enthusiasm. Why? So So why am I saying we must learn how to wait? Yes. And so the new ministry is not this random sayings and just saying things for the purpose of just saying it that God said. I feel some people want to speak something sometimes that's of God to appear more spiritual than somebody else. Oh, come on now. Say amen to that, too. I feel sometimes people want to speak something to appear more spiritual to somebody else. And I'm not against uh craving to see more of God. We should have a craving and hunger to see more of God. Matter of fact, God uh works upon the faith of the people. In other words, he sees the faith. He sees the expecting. Um we under need to always be under expectation. Expectation is a wonderful thing. When we come to church, when we get up in the morning, we should be under expectations. So that's a healthy thing. We should have a craving for God do to mighty things. But we should have expectation. But we should not try to make it happen under our expectation. You say, "God, what are you going to do today? I am ready. I'm available to you." If he does something great, great, fine. If he does something little, fine. But I'm under expectation. God's going to do something. But we should never tell God what to do. We should never put our our words in his mouth. Can you say amen? So I am not speaking against a craving to see more of God if it's pure. Sometimes uh it's not a craving just to see God. It's a craving to be seen. It's a craving to be spiritual. It's a craving to be acknowledged and to impress people with saying God said. A craving to be praised and admired. Listen, we got to grow out of our uh uh uh young craving to just be accepted. and we're willing to do anything to be impressive and accepted by everybody. We should start first and say, "I want to be accepted by God." Matter of fact, when you know the revelation, he already accepted you at Calvary. He already paid the price for your sin. So, you're not even your working your way towards acceptance or God. Let me tell you, my brother and sister tonight, you've already been accepted by God. Praise the Lord. But people out of a craving to be praised and accepted, they'll go out of their way to impress everybody. And they do this in a spiritual way by saying, "God told me to do this and God told me to do that and this happened and this." I like to hear testimonies that are pure. But if it's tainted with a craving to be seen and to be more spiritual, it's tainted. If it's tainted, it's tainted. Well, that was profound, wasn't it? So, you know, um we we find then uh you know, I I've never been a follower of super spiritual people. Um I'm a I I like to see supernatural people and the supernatural is God. Not super spiritual, supernatural. Can you say amen? Because that's what he wants to do. It's something supernatural, something beyond you that God. But super spiritual people sometimes they can really they they look too much into things and they're looking to find God and every little thing and they go to interpret it and you know I I come to church tonight with two different pairs of socks on, two different colors and I'm just trying to figure out what God's trying to tell me and what is the symbolism and something's really significant about that and no, you just put on the wrong socks. You just got the wrong socks. Can you say amen? Don't try to read into it. And I've you I've maybe I'm a little bit cynical because I've seen so much of this especially in our own rank sometimes that people trying to make something out of something. You don't have to do that. Let God be God. Let him be sovereign. Be available for him. And then when he does it, testify of the Lord. So sons of God come into sunship. the same sunship that Jesus did with humility and submission that says I don't act unless the father shows me and has truly told me to act. I don't I do nothing except the father shows me. If I if I live my life I want to see it in the word and I know this is his word. This is the father's word. I want to see his word and if I know and feel solid it's in his word then I can step out and act on it and I want to live that life. I don't want to say, "Okay, there's just a few uh important verses in here and I'll try to catch the themes and and go with that and I'm just going to go with it in other things." We ought to mature to say if I can find the answers in his word and be feel solid about it, then I can step out on faith on that because our faith has to be based on something. Can't be based on our emotions. Can't be based on uncertainty. It's got to be based on the word, a father's word. I do nothing except my father shows me. So the sons of God, all sons and daughters of God, come into the same sunship as Jesus with a humility first and then a submission that says, "I don't act unless the father has truly told me to act." And this leads into a teaching about sons uh that uh that they need to grow into maturity, into discipline, into submission. The same Jesus, the same submission that Jesus had, submission of sons. Jesus had authority, but his authority was under the father's leadership. The bride has authority, but it has to be under his leadership. We have to act. Now, tonight we will find that there are some things we already have authority to do. They shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. That's God's promise. So, I don't need necessarily a word from the Lord. I already have one for that. So, we're separating two things here that there's certain things. Okay, I'm going to pray for somebody because the the word tells me I have the authority as a believer to do that and to believe that they'll be healed. And that happens all the time. God works in that. When we come into more the third pole and speaking something, we need to make sure that the Lord has spoken it to us to say and to proceed. Can you say amen? Because we realize if he speaks something like he did in the examples of the prophet then you have to know that he has said it before you step out on that. That's not something that lays there. That's something maybe he would uh uh uh tell you to do. You want to make sure of that. So now it was Jesus was under the father's leadership and that's when the authority is perfectly correct. Otherwise authority can be used the wrong way. Oh, how that is another subject tonight that we could talk about or some other time is that uh authority when it's under the right authority is perfectly correct. Otherwise, authority even what it says to you in the word can be used the wrong way. Parental authority, you may have it according to the Bible, but you may use it the wrong way. See, God doesn't want his authority used the wrong way. God doesn't want you overstepping bounds with your authority. Uh overstepping boundaries, you you can't do that. You have it. The scripture says a husband can do that cuz he has he's the the head over the wife. But oh, how he can misuse of his authority if he's not under authority. So that's how it works. And so Jesus had it, but he wants God wants mature sons to be able to handle it. And so the the sons of God who muh who are growing in maturity and becoming ready for this third pearl are this is the distinction. They're they are uh they they are wanting to live in a sovereign work of God or his sovereign voice to be in it before they act. And they would rather wait for no matter how long it takes to wait to wait for the sovereign move of God. That's mature sons. We look for the God moments. We wait for the God moments that we can it's undeniable this is our God. Our supernatural God has spoken in this and he has stepped in and we all stand back and everybody nobody can deny this was God. This was a sovereign move. Even a revival I like to be able to say there's a revival start. It's a sovereign revival of God. It it wasn't necessarily that we mechanically made it happen or worked it up by the music or worked it up by emotion or the preachers worked it up. I like it to know that we were just ready and available and we were open to what God did. And God sovereignly sends a revival in our hearts. It has to be sovereign. It can't be humanmade or pressed or emotionally built up. And this is what sons of God are learning. The sons of God who are maturing and becoming ready for this third pole are looking for a sovereign work of God or his sovereign voice to be heard in it. And they would rather wait for that. No matter how long it takes to wait, we look for those God moments when it's and uh and when it's done. No one can deny at all that the sovereign God did it and no one can claim glory for it. That's right. Hallelujah. In the biblical I did write down what sovereign means here. It means it describes God's supreme authority and power over creation encompassing his right to govern the universe according to what? His will. So if we're looking for the sovereign God to move in and the sovereign God to speak to us what to do before we move, we're looking for we're under his authority and now he's going to he's been given the right to govern situations and to govern things according to his will, not your will. And so we're looking for a sovereign God. We should be looking for that in our lives too every day. You know, it's it's him stepping in. It's him leading. Can you say amen? And sons of God are led by the spirit of God. So we wait for that. Uh we prefer it to be that way. Not say, "Well, uh nothing is happening here. Oh, nothing's happening. So let's make something happen." No. This is part of maturing and waiting on God as well. How long do I have to wait, brother Paul? However long it takes until a sovereign God moves in. This is part of the maturity as sons of God. How long do we have to wait? Sometimes your attitude gets revealed in the waiting. So that's a good thing. And I think some of the other brothers have been preaching on that, brother Brandon and different ones. It's it's uh sometimes your attitude gets revealed in the waiting and you have a bad attitude and it's an immature attitude. So maybe that's one of the reasons why there was waiting is to reveal that bad attitude and to reveal that explosion that takes place and I don't know why God's not answering and all these other things. Well, God's got to deal with that first. Um kind of like on the boat with Jesus, he had to deal with the disciples uh lack of faith. He was more interested in their fear and their lack of faith than he was speaking to the storm. And I've said it, he'd rather speak to your fear before he speaks to your storm. He'd rather deal with your lack of faith and deal with your fear because the same Jesus that can speak to the storm can speak to your fear. Can you say amen? And so, you know, this is how God deals with sons now. Not not immature just people, flighty people that's not all in the kingdom. We're talking about sons that want to mature. or if Andrew or Peter up in the upper room even in the upper room if Andrew would have said stepped there and say brothers you know it's been 5 days and we know what's supposed to come according to the scripture it's here in the Bible why don't we just get going and go to preaching and brother Brandham gives that example is that they if they weren't willing to wait and just say let's just believe and go on but the promise of the Holy Ghost was supposed to come and you had to wait for that real thing to be fulfilled and if they said let's you know brothers it's been five days already we understandless. Let's go forward. No. Brother Bram says they had to wait for a response back for God to do his work according to the word. So if if the day of Pentecost is that way, then how much more now under this third poll that we don't stand up and say, "Let's try to make it happen. Let's take off. Let's interpret it. Let's do it. Let's do it." No, let's not do it until God sovereignly does it. Is that okay with everybody? So I think that's a good example. And there's many other examples in the scripture to show the importance of waiting, but especially in this hour. They said, "Why don't we just go and preach?" No, stay there until you know a sovereign God has answered back in his promise and you can say, "This is the word being fulfilled. This is truly a sovereign work of God." This principle is for sure applied to the third pole of waiting until God says says the time to go. But do you know there's enough examples this also applies to even the nine spiritual gifts in the church that we should not act in our own enthusiasm and humanism. This is the part you get into with the nine spiritual gifts. Um we're not talking about a gift of a prophet. We're not talking about what God does in the spoken word and the bride at the end. We're talking about the nine spiritual gifts which we believe in that are scriptural. You're just ready. You're available. You wait on God. He can use you with a word of wisdom, a prayer over the sick. Read the other nine spiritual gifts in First Corinthians. That's why from the youngest teenager, get the Holy Ghost. Yield to the Lord. God can use you in one of the nine spiritual gifts. They're in the church ready to God wants to use it. But you have to you have to give your life over and have the Holy Ghost and then say, "Lord, you use me for whatever way." But but guess what? You don't give yourself a gift. You don't push your way into it. You don't come to church and say, "Well, what gift can I can manifest today?" You don't say any of that. You're just filled, sitting there, ready. If God uses you this week and he and he or he doesn't or if he uses you 10 years from now, it doesn't matter when. You're waiting for God to use you. But you don't legislate and you don't push anything. Now, if that's true with the nine spiritual gifts, how about this third Paul? We don't make things happen. We don't push the gifts. I preach expectation and preachers can preach certain expectations and they can get result of what they're wanting. So I have to be very careful what expectations I preach the people under because whatever you preach that's probably what you'll get but they better be the right expectations or you're misleading God's people.
