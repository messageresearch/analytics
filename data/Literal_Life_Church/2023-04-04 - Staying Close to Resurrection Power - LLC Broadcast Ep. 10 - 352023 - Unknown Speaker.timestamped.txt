[1:42] [Music]
[1:50] Jesus
[1:58] [Music]
[2:01] Christ
[2:02] [Music]
[2:09] happened
[2:14] [Music]
[2:20] probably
[2:23] [Music]
[2:31] you remember
[2:35] foreign
[2:42] [Music]
[3:09] it's not time
[3:11] she talking
[3:12] [Music]
[3:19] show me
[3:24] boys
[3:25] [Music]
[3:56] at the time
[4:10] [Music]
[4:18] okay I'll sing it again if you will
[4:21] remember remember
[4:29] but Jesus
[4:32] [Music]
[4:56] before he dropped the charger
[5:02] although I was wrong
[5:18] pass them all away
[5:21] [Music]
[6:08] Jesus Christ all the charges have been
[6:11] dropped
[6:13] I said for the vital
[6:16] that's a good feeling I'm
[6:20] before and somebody just wrote off the
[6:22] whole death you remember that feeling
[6:25] multiply that by a million times and
[6:28] that's what the Lord has done for us in
[6:29] the same man
[6:32] Jesus
[6:49] Hallelujah
[6:55] [Music]
[7:18] [Music]
[7:20] Mark 16 verse 9. now when Jesus was
[7:23] risen early the first day of the week he
[7:27] appeared first
[7:29] to Mary Magdalene
[7:31] out of whom he had cast
[7:34] Seven Devils
[7:37] I'm going to read it again now when
[7:39] Jesus was risen early the first day of
[7:41] the week he appeared first to marry
[7:45] Magdalene
[7:47] it would seem like
[7:49] he would appear to some of the other
[7:51] popular ones some of the other disciples
[7:54] first
[7:56] but scripture wanted to identify and
[7:59] make it clear
[8:00] that the first one he appeared to was a
[8:04] woman
[8:06] didn't come from a good background
[8:09] delivered of Seven Devils
[8:12] and he wanted to emphasize that out of
[8:15] all the disciples and out of all the
[8:17] people
[8:18] first one
[8:20] who gets to see him after his
[8:21] resurrection
[8:23] is Mary Magdalene
[8:27] who was delivered of Seven Devils
[8:30] I tell you there's no seniority in this
[8:34] there's no big eyes or little use it
[8:37] doesn't matter how many years you've
[8:38] been in the message
[8:40] it doesn't matter if you come from a
[8:42] good background or a bad background
[8:43] [Music]
[8:45] can you say man
[8:47] that's what God chose here and he says
[8:48] you know what I'm going to take this
[8:50] woman and I'm going to let her see me
[8:52] first and then I'm going to tell her you
[8:55] go tell my disciples
[8:57] I'm alive I want to pick up something
[9:00] here after right after our Lord died
[9:02] that's a part of the journey that I
[9:04] don't want to miss there was a follower
[9:06] of Jesus named Joseph of armathea and he
[9:10] was a very wealthy man who went right
[9:13] away after Jesus died on the cross and
[9:17] his body was taken down from the cross
[9:19] and he went right away I don't know the
[9:21] time he went but I know he went and
[9:22] appealed to pilate and the Bible says
[9:24] that he one place that says he was
[9:26] begging pilate another place he says he
[9:28] was bold with pilate and so you got to
[9:31] imagine just the scare maybe that might
[9:32] be in him to go and do this because the
[9:35] followers of Jesus were looked down on
[9:37] some of the disciples were hiding they
[9:39] didn't know what they would do with him
[9:40] after Jesus died but this man had a
[9:42] boldness he was a wealthy man he had a
[9:44] boldness to go right before Pilate and
[9:45] say listen I'm begging for his body I
[9:47] want his body I want to be able to take
[9:49] it I want to would you do it and the
[9:51] Bible says he begs so I don't know how
[9:52] long it took him but he begged enough
[9:54] and was bold enough that he got
[9:56] permission from pilate to go get the
[9:58] body and so he went he took the wit and
[10:01] took the dead body of Jesus and he took
[10:03] the body and he bought some real
[10:06] expensive linen and he wrapped that body
[10:09] carefully and the minute I'll talk about
[10:10] how they uh had the spices and they
[10:13] would do that to the body to uh be able
[10:15] to for for different reasons and I'll
[10:17] just get to that in a minute but he took
[10:19] it and he carefully just uh wrapped up
[10:21] put spices and wrapped the body and find
[10:24] linen and gave Jesus a proper burial and
[10:27] he gave his own uh tomb to Jesus in
[10:30] other words he he had a tomb that he had
[10:33] purchased it was also in a very wealthy
[10:35] expensive area and Joseph felt to give
[10:39] his own tomb that he had been no doubt
[10:41] paying on or already paid for to give
[10:42] that to Jesus and so we have the natural
[10:45] side where he's wanting to give him a
[10:47] proper burial and take care of that body
[10:49] but you got to think that some of these
[10:51] people are kind of acting by a
[10:53] revelation within them too to make a
[10:55] preparation of a place because you know
[10:58] that deep within them there had to be
[11:00] something that believed when Jesus said
[11:02] in three days out rise again
[11:05] so there's two things going on they're
[11:07] doing it naturally to take care of the
[11:08] body but at the same time their actions
[11:11] and what they're doing is actually
[11:13] walking in the scripture he gave his own
[11:15] tomb he had purchased and of course
[11:17] Jesus would only be borrowing the tomb
[11:19] for three days but it's an amazing the
[11:22] actions of hearing Brother Joseph Jesus
[11:24] made no prior main arrangements for his
[11:27] burial we don't have any scripture that
[11:29] says that Jesus called Joseph or called
[11:31] different ones from the cross or before
[11:33] knew enough any meetings where he made a
[11:36] a arrangements for his burial because he
[11:38] knew he would only be here temporarily
[11:40] so he's not calling ahead and said I
[11:42] want you to do this and Joseph I'd like
[11:44] you to get me a tomb I'm going to need
[11:46] it for three days and so if you do this
[11:49] and do that there's no instructions for
[11:50] that so Joseph is acting on his own and
[11:53] he goes and does this I don't know Jesus
[11:55] made no prior arrangements and but but
[11:57] the thing is that we want to get to this
[11:59] all of this was happening by the word of
[12:03] God
[12:03] and I didn't see it till Friday night
[12:05] when brother Brandon was reading through
[12:07] the scriptures in Isaiah 53 in many
[12:09] scriptures as each one of those things
[12:11] took place and he was wounded for our
[12:13] transgression he took the stripes upon
[12:15] his back it's all in the word so every
[12:18] move that Jesus made especially at the
[12:20] end of his life in the last few hours
[12:22] it's scripture after scripture after
[12:25] scripture this was not happening just
[12:27] because men were doing it to him but
[12:29] scripture was being fulfilled over and
[12:31] over and over again
[12:33] even when Jesus spoke the words my God
[12:35] my God why is thou forsaking me it's all
[12:38] been spoken before God prophesied of it
[12:41] before
[12:42] so he's G we know that Jesus was walking
[12:45] in the word even in his death
[12:50] but I didn't see it till Friday night
[12:52] because Brandon read one of the
[12:53] scriptures in Isaiah 53 and we see all
[12:56] the Prophecies of Jesus fulfilling over
[12:58] and over again but there's this
[12:59] scripture in verse 9 I think it is and
[13:01] it says and he made his grave with the
[13:04] wicked and with the rich in his death
[13:07] because he had done no violence neither
[13:10] was any deceit found in his mouth and
[13:12] when he read that I thought my isn't
[13:14] that amazing so it's not just Jesus
[13:16] fulfilling the word but others are
[13:18] walking in the word as well and I was
[13:20] just wondering how long it took our
[13:23] brother Joseph to discover I don't know
[13:25] if he discovered it three days later I
[13:27] don't know if he discovered later in the
[13:29] upper room because he was there but
[13:31] later on he must have discovered that
[13:33] not only in Isaiah 53 while he was
[13:35] reading Not only was Jesus in there but
[13:38] Joseph was in there because he provided
[13:40] this very wealthy place for Jesus
[13:43] it talks about the rich and he says
[13:45] he'll be with the rich and his death I
[13:47] wonder if Joseph said no you know what
[13:49] that's me
[13:52] few days ago I did all that because I
[13:54] wanted to do it on an honor for Jesus
[13:55] body I didn't realize there's a
[13:57] scripture about me
[13:59] I'm walking in the word every day I
[14:02] didn't know it but I'm walking in the
[14:04] very scripture just like Jesus I
[14:07] understand my God my God why is Thou
[14:09] forsaken me I understand Jesus place in
[14:12] the word I see how he come and fulfilled
[14:14] all that but once you see yourself in
[14:16] there and you realize you're walking in
[14:18] the word I tell you you get a Revival in
[14:20] your heart
[14:21] this Mary Magdalene she she wants to
[14:24] stay close to Jesus even though he is
[14:27] dead so there's very little written
[14:29] about Mary Magdalene very little just
[14:31] one or two verses on that's her
[14:33] biography but she is named uh she's
[14:38] named in all the places all four gospels
[14:41] her name is there we've only got one
[14:43] other scripture for her about her life
[14:45] being delivered to Seven Devils that's
[14:47] it that's her biography but in all the
[14:49] gospels she's mentioned at the re at the
[14:52] crucifixion she's mentioned as Jesus is
[14:54] walking down the Via Dolorosa the way of
[14:56] suffering she she was at the crucifixion
[14:59] she was at the foot of the cross with
[15:01] Jesus Mary's uh Jesus mother Mary uh as
[15:05] far as how we look at it and then then
[15:08] she was there and then they had to go
[15:10] home after and she watched him die they
[15:12] watched him take the body now she was
[15:14] there through all of it and and then she
[15:16] went home because they had to stay home
[15:17] for the Sabbath they couldn't do any
[15:19] work but the prophet refers to going to
[15:21] her going home the scripture refers
[15:23] excuse me the scripture reversed she
[15:25] goes home Friday night and with Mary
[15:26] they begin to prepare spices because
[15:28] they're going to go be near that body
[15:30] after the Sabbath is older they're going
[15:32] to go give spices to that body she wants
[15:34] to be near she wants to be near that
[15:36] body I don't understand it carnally you
[15:38] don't understand it but she wants to
[15:40] stay near that body even though
[15:42] everything says he's dead he's finished
[15:44] he's done she still wants to stay near
[15:46] the body of Christ
[15:49] all right amen
[15:51] I say this real clearly to you
[15:54] I don't care what's going on in your
[15:56] life
[15:57] I don't care how low it's got and I
[15:59] don't care how hopeless it seems
[16:01] you know what you should do stay close
[16:03] to the body of Christ
[16:07] your answer is not to distance yourself
[16:09] and have an arm's length relationship
[16:11] and go out there no your answer during
[16:13] those dead times is to stay close to the
[16:16] body of Christ
[16:18] doesn't
[16:19] the Proclaim that as we get closer
[16:25] closer and so much the more as we see
[16:28] the day approaching
[16:29] why because we're in Resurrection time
[16:34] we're not 30 years ago we're closer to
[16:37] Resurrection time than we've ever been
[16:39] before and this woman an ill-fame woman
[16:41] that come to the Lord she just wanted to
[16:44] stay close to that body so you know she
[16:48] is named
[16:49] in all the places she in all the
[16:53] resurrection places and the closing
[16:54] hours of Jesus that's when she's named
[16:57] Mary Magdalene Mary Magdalene in other
[17:00] words she may not have a name
[17:03] she may not have been somebody
[17:06] but she popped up
[17:07] at the most important time
[17:13] and that was Resurrection time
[17:16] he's alive and well this morning
[17:19] it changes our life he changes our
[17:21] countenance
[17:22] doesn't matter what you're going through
[17:23] doesn't matter what you feel the deepest
[17:25] depression can be lifted by the power of
[17:28] Resurrection this morning
[17:32] so the small bile that is of Mary
[17:35] Magdalene is Luke 8 chapter 2. that's
[17:38] all we have you guys can pull it up Luke
[17:40] 8 chapter 2 and uh it says this is about
[17:44] Mary Magdalene just if you wanted to
[17:46] know what said about her
[17:48] says and it came to pass verse 1
[17:50] afterward that he went through every
[17:52] city Village preaching and showing the
[17:54] Glad Titans of the kingdom and the
[17:55] twelve were with him and certain women
[17:57] which had been healed of evil spirits
[17:59] and infirmities how many raise your hand
[18:02] and say I've been healed of infirmities
[18:03] and spirits
[18:06] because of Jesus
[18:08] certain women which had been healed of
[18:10] evil spirits and infirmities Mary called
[18:12] Magdalene of of out of whom went Seven
[18:16] Devils and Joanna the the wife of shusa
[18:19] Herod Stewart and Susanna and many
[18:22] others I like to go into each of these
[18:24] lives and see where they come from Herod
[18:25] Stewart my goodness Harold Stewart the
[18:27] wife of Herod Stewart Susanna and many
[18:29] others which ministered unto him Christ
[18:32] of their substance but you see now
[18:34] that's all that's written out of her
[18:36] life but she's all over during the time
[18:38] of the Resurrection
[18:41] she's there
[18:44] were you there
[18:47] When They Crucified My Lord
[18:50] and guess what Mary could say I was
[18:53] really there
[18:55] I was there at the cross I was there
[18:57] when he died I was there in between I
[19:00] ran I got up early Sunday morning I
[19:02] don't know how early you got up this
[19:03] morning she ran she got there as quick
[19:05] as she should and she could say I was
[19:08] there when he come out of the Tomb and I
[19:10] was the first one he appeared to
[19:15] then she had to go tell 12 disciples I
[19:18] need to stay to my notes here and preach
[19:20] this but I can't help but say it
[19:23] she's the one that had to go this woman
[19:25] the woman we don't listen to a woman
[19:29] you know in the culture even the Jewish
[19:31] culture there's a just a bit of that you
[19:34] can't deny it you know and it just it's
[19:36] man they get proud and they don't treat
[19:37] their women right and stuff so but
[19:39] here's a woman and Jesus says I'm going
[19:41] to appear to her first and I want her to
[19:44] be the first witness of my resurrection
[19:46] and she has to go tell the disciples who
[19:49] by the way are hiding they didn't run
[19:51] towards the tomb they didn't want to be
[19:52] around the body they had basically given
[19:54] up
[19:57] and Jesus said you know what you see me
[20:00] I want you to go into the house of those
[20:02] disciples and you be the one saying I've
[20:04] seen him he's alive
[20:07] [Applause]
[20:09] Lord are you sure I want to do you sure
[20:12] you want me to do this I'm a woman
[20:14] they're not going to believe and guess
[20:15] what they didn't
[20:20] and then Peter
[20:22] and John I think it was finally decided
[20:24] they started to run towards the tomb
[20:26] found out he wasn't there
[20:29] the woman's telling the truth
[20:33] she's the first Witness
[20:35] I'm saying Jesus chose Mary Magdalene to
[20:39] be the first one to get to see him and
[20:41] the first one to witness his
[20:44] resurrection
[20:45] so you think this morning you're
[20:48] unworthy to witness you're unworthy
[20:50] because of your life you can't say
[20:52] nothing get the preacher to do it call
[20:54] Brother Paul somebody's asking me a
[20:56] question call Brother Paul no don't call
[20:58] Brother Paul
[21:00] tell how the candle got lit yourself
[21:02] you'll be a witness to Jesus Christ and
[21:05] so then when Joseph went to get the body
[21:07] there on Saturday
[21:10] um the name Nicodemus pops up and he
[21:12] wants to go with Joseph Joseph you're
[21:14] going to get the body I want to go with
[21:15] you I'm going to buy some expensive
[21:17] spices this is all in your Bible now I'm
[21:19] going to buy some expensive spices
[21:21] because I want to Value the body of Our
[21:23] Lord can I go with you when you go get
[21:25] the body you got permission I'm going to
[21:26] go and I'll help you work on the body
[21:27] we'll put in the Tomb and so Nicodemus
[21:29] does anybody remember that name
[21:32] who came to Jesus a ruler a Pharisee in
[21:36] Israel and he came to Jesus by Night
[21:38] secretly
[21:40] and he asked questions about the new
[21:43] birth
[21:45] and he got his questions answered
[21:48] but there's no other scriptures from we
[21:50] don't see him again there's no biography
[21:53] there's no there's no there's not even
[21:55] he was delivered to Seven Devils like
[21:57] Mary Magdalene but his name pops up and
[21:59] he wants to buy the expensive spices to
[22:02] anoint the body of Jesus and to to get
[22:04] it to prepare his body he pops up again
[22:08] at the end
[22:11] didn't Jesus say the last shall be first
[22:14] and the first shall be last didn't he
[22:17] give the parable of each worker getting
[22:19] a penny and they worked and worked and
[22:21] worked all those years and then some
[22:23] workers in the city said we don't have a
[22:25] job and they and the the king says we'll
[22:27] go to my person in charge and they'll
[22:29] give you a job and some of them came the
[22:31] last hour and they went and got a job
[22:33] and when payday came they were all paid
[22:37] first by the way paid first the last
[22:39] minute dudes got paid first the same
[22:42] amount as all the other ones that had
[22:45] worked for years and all of them said
[22:48] what's up with that
[22:53] dude
[22:55] very fair
[22:58] what's up with this we worked all these
[23:01] years striving we've labored we've done
[23:04] this and this new kid on the Block comes
[23:07] along he's only been around an hour
[23:10] he come at the very last minute
[23:15] Nicodemus where you been
[23:18] I don't know but I'm here now
[23:20] [Music]
[23:22] I want to honor this body
[23:24] there's something in the media says it's
[23:25] truth I don't know all the details I
[23:28] don't know any of the scriptures I don't
[23:30] even know what I'm doing but I want to
[23:31] honor this body
[23:33] I want to stay close to this body
[23:35] [Applause]
[23:39] last minute
[23:41] Believers coming in
[23:43] listen
[23:45] God has his own leadership it's not
[23:48] about position
[23:50] if it had been about position Mary
[23:53] Magdalene was not qualified to be the
[23:55] first to see our lord Jesus was saying
[23:58] this is not about position it's not
[24:01] about the leadership it's not the big
[24:03] eyes are little use
[24:05] it's those that are staying close to me
[24:08] what if Jesus were to come down and ask
[24:10] me who my leadership was and then he
[24:12] said no no no no and he grabs all you
[24:14] guys and brings you up front
[24:16] Paul
[24:18] knew what
[24:20] I choose these guys this is your
[24:22] leadership
[24:23] just blow our minds
[24:26] always isn't that can't happen can't
[24:27] happen well one thing I learned about
[24:30] these guys and the girls too is that
[24:32] they're not struggling for positions
[24:36] they're just enjoying being here
[24:39] being at Sunday school I'm sure they
[24:41] might resist sometimes but for the most
[24:43] part they just want to be around
[24:46] I just want to be here
[24:48] I think that's honorable
[24:51] but what comes out of these guys is
[24:52] Purity there's not a struggle
[24:55] they learn that when they become an
[24:56] adult
[24:58] they come closer to the kingdom of God
[25:00] it's all about just stay around the
[25:01] kingdom of God
[25:02] just stay around where he's at
[25:04] it's not about position
[25:07] it's not about position
[25:10] it's about character
[25:12] it's about loving our Lord the Bible
[25:14] shows Mary went home Friday after she
[25:16] was dead and her and her other the other
[25:18] Mary prepared spices they did nothing on
[25:21] the Saturday the Sabbath they weren't
[25:22] supposed to even prepare spices but they
[25:24] did it on they did it before they
[25:26] prepared it and they got up early Sunday
[25:28] morning they prepared them on Friday got
[25:30] up early Sunday morning and there's
[25:32] you'd be surprised how many scriptures
[25:34] speak about this it's in the Bible got
[25:36] up early got the spices
[25:38] and in history now the main reason a
[25:40] dead body was anointed with spices was
[25:42] to control the smell of decomposition
[25:44] Jews did not practice embalming and the
[25:47] funeral spices were a way to help
[25:49] minimize unpleasant odors that's why
[25:51] Martha at the grave of Lazarus there she
[25:53] was saying something like that that if
[25:55] you opened up that it's going to smell
[25:56] and different things and because they
[25:58] didn't embalm and so she was worried
[26:00] about that but the the the spices the
[26:03] women brought to Jesus too
[26:05] were intended to eliminate such an order
[26:09] and to honor the body of Christ
[26:14] why are they doing all that well it's to
[26:16] honor the body of Christ
[26:18] and I'll tell you when you do the
[26:20] simplest little things to honor him
[26:22] he doesn't forget it
[26:25] so it's honor
[26:27] never find these actions at this time by
[26:29] the disciples the scripture shows the
[26:31] disciples crying mourning hiding but
[26:34] these here women wanted to be around the
[26:36] body of Christ to honor the body of
[26:38] Christ and this may not fit but I just
[26:40] want to
[26:41] just stay close I I just want to I'm
[26:44] taking this lesson out of this this
[26:46] morning because I know we're in the days
[26:48] of the time of the final Resurrection
[26:52] how many Believers would agree with me
[26:53] we're in the times that could happen any
[26:56] time that the Saints should appear and
[26:58] we're getting out of here we're closer
[27:00] than we've ever been
[27:03] and this may be a strange sermon to you
[27:06] but I just want to say I want to stay
[27:08] close to the body of Christ
[27:13] honoring it then out doing something
[27:15] else right now that's where I want to
[27:17] stay close to if you get my message
[27:19] today it's staying close to resurrection
[27:21] power staying close to the body of
[27:24] Christ this thing is almost over it's
[27:27] not time to fight can you say Iman it's
[27:30] not time to fight over Doctrine it's not
[27:32] turn time to take stabs at other
[27:34] churches it's not time to fight it's
[27:37] time to love one another with Divine
[27:38] love and stay close to the body of
[27:41] Christ stay close to the word of God
[27:45] it's time to honor our Lord and his body
[27:48] like we never have
[27:51] honor means you don't speak against it
[27:53] honor means you don't gossip against it
[27:54] honor means you have high respect for
[27:57] your brothers and sisters
[28:01] [Applause]
[28:03] Body of Christ because Resurrection is
[28:05] about ready to take place
