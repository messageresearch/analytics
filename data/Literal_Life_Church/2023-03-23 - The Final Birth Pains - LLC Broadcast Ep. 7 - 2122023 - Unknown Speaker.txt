hi everybody Pastor Paul LaFontaine and literal Life Church in Petersburg Michigan would like to invite you to take the next half hour and enjoy some time in the word of God if you're hungry for more of Christ we believe you can be fed and we pray that you'll be blessed visit our website for more information at literallife.church may God bless you my friend and may the music and message encourage you today [Music] thank you [Music] he loves to hear he Praises from these people he loves to hear things from the Mountain Times but I believe it draws a tear to his face when he is [Music] Hallelujah [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] but when the rain this story [Music] he's touched by the sound [Music] Hallelujah [Music] [Music] love my world soon [Music] Hallelujah [Music] [Music] Christmas time [Music] Jesus I'll never give up [Music] because [Music] my way [Music] amenities [Music] knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lust and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation so this group knows that things are to take place but they're mocking it and scoffing it uh they're and their their manner of life is to live as if it's not going to happen but if God said it's going to happen it's going to happen so this is another group who's living there they're scoffing but their their manner of life is to live uh not only scoffing it and not believing that it's true but there is something else in the world that says if it is true we're going to do everything without our power to stop it and that's another uh weakness and arrogance of man for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of God the heavens were of old and the Earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished it happened I mean we can say Amen but the heavens and the Earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto the fire against the day of judgment and Perdition of ungodly men but believe beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day of the Lord is this a thousand years and a thousand years as one day the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is long-suffering to us word not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens will shall pass away with great noise and elements shall melt with fervent heat the Earth also and the works that therein are shall be burned up seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation all holy manner of life in all holy conversation and godliness looking for and Hasting unto the coming of the day of our God God wherein the heaven shall be on fire shall be dissolved and the element shall melt with fervent heat nevertheless we according to his promise now here's the other group we're living according to his promise we're living on his promises we're looking for something else can you say amen and you can't endure what's coming on the earth unless you know of the promise that there's something else coming nevertheless we according to his promised look for the new heavens and new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness wherefore beloved seeing that ye look for such things be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless if you won't mind back to John one of the gospels John chapter 16 and they can pull up their pull it up there quickly if they want John 16 and verse 20 verily rarely I say unto you that ye shall weep and lament but the world shall rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful but your sorrow your sorrow and here's the other group now there's one group that that may sorrow and yet they may rejoice in this world we may go through sour but the world shall rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into Joy a woman when she is in travail hath sorrow because her hour is come but as soon as she is delivered of a child she REM she remembers no more than anguish for joy that a man is Born Into the world and whenever you have something brand new coming in God you always have a death and you always have pain that comes before it can you say Amen and we'll get into that a little bit because that's the process in God's kingdom that's the way it works in God's kingdom that's not the way that it works in the world we tend to polish ourselves up we tend to try to make ourselves better the world gets better and better we intellectually try to change something or do something or patch up what's already done even if it's dirty and it's filthy we patch it up and do the best we can but when God does something he does it brand new and then it comes the way that its birth is through pain through suffering through hard times can you say Amen I'll tell you if you have a real true New Birth this morning it's because probably a lot of your life and especially right before the New Birth you went through hard times you went through pain because why you had to die out to yourself to have a new birth and it's just the way the kingdom of God works you can avoid it you can get around it you can try to polish it up I'm a good person I'm okay I love God but that's not the new birth there has to be a death before there's a new birth many people will not allow themselves to go through that pain but if they only knew the joy if they only knew what was coming then they would die out to themselves because what God has brand new is so much far beyond what you're living now Hallelujah and so now by looking at it this way we see this these nervous scary events as bringing us closer to the birth of a new life a new heavens and a new Earth so we see these events as not the scary nervous events that the world looks at it as but we see it as something of giving birth to the new life giving birth to the new world and that is a very exciting result that when it's all over can you say Amen the prophet opens the mystery that we know if it's in the final days when it's all over as a woman going through her final days of birth pains when it's all over then a baby is born the pain increases before the baby is born can you say man the contractions increase that you know and how feeble I am to talk about this this morning when I haven't had a baby myself we have Professionals in this room that have been through this and none of you guys better talk about you knowing about you don't know nothing and how many sisters would raise their hand how many has ever had their husbands say to somebody we're gonna have a baby or we had a baby and the wife looks over what you mean we we had a baby you didn't do nothing hardly but you mean we partner yeah so none of you but there's some professionals in the room and I'll say this that the mystery of God is actually written in the life of a woman The Mystery of the Bride the mystery of what the bride goes through the mystery of everything and bringing forth Christ lies and she lives out this mystery when she dresses modest and lives like God said to the center she's she's a light she's a word more than what I can preach the woman is the mystery to this world of what God's doing in his bride that's a pretty important position God bless you sisters we give you praise and honor this morning for holding up that standard she been through it just they know so I'm not going to talk about it but we know that as she gets closer and closer the pain gets more intense and the suffering gets more intense can you say Amen pains increase but see when you know the joy that's just a few minutes away you can endure and you can have Hallelujah in the valley somebody say praise the Lord you can have Hallelujah in the valley so the pains increase there's another reference to it in Luke chapter 21 thought I would read that if you guys want to pull out Luke chapter 21 it says verse 25 this is where he refers to it Luke 21 25 it says and there shall be signs in the sun and the moon and the stars and upon the Earth distress of nations with perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring men's Hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken and then shall they see the son of man coming in the cloud with power and great glory and when these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your heads for your Redemption draws now Jesus is saying the same thing when there's perplexity of Nations when there's earthquakes in diverse places when men's Hearts failing for fear when all this stuff begins to intensify and get more and more as you'll see in the scripture more and more then when these things begin to come to pass then we can look up and lift at our lift up our head because the joy that set before us that says to us our Redemption is drawing nigh it's the only way to look at events the right way and that's with the revelation you Bound by the scare and as I said last Sunday you're going to make an issue with some family in the church knowing these events are taken and we're this close you're going to distance yourself from the body of Christ now you're going to backslide I say to you as a gospel Minister you need to be under the word you need to be clinging to the body of Christ you don't need to be running away [Applause] God have mercy on people that are doing that even today God have mercy on their souls so if you don't see it the way Jesus is saying goes on to say look up lift up your head for your Redemption is drawing nigh and and so they just we'll continue with that in a minute but if you don't see it this way you will be looking at things like the world looks at it where you where you stand and you where you're standing there and they're going to hand you the next uh fear that you're going to worry about the next year a woman when she's in travail has sorrow because her Hours come but as soon as she has delivered the of the child she remembersth no more the anguish for Joy than a man that is Born Into the world the spiritual birth is the same way as the natural birth a lot of people run from the pain part of it can you say Amen but if you would just sit still and know the pain that's in you is to bring forth new life it's not the new birth is not a new intellectual exercise it's not shaken the preacher's hand it's not speaking in tongues it's not a feeling or emotion the new birth goes much deeper than that can you say amen and and it works by a natural birth it's the pain that a woman goes through you're not going to get to that new birth without some pain without your system being jolted your life crumbling apart sometimes divorces and all kinds of things can happen and a lot of times it's driving the person in this pain of life to seek God can you say a man just say finally God I need you more than anything else I don't care about anything except a new birth pain drives you to that suffering drives you to that because that's the way God set it up can you say Amen praise the Lord and and in God's kingdom you can't get around it and and so we see that new life it's not an intellectual but your whole life changes I had some good fellowship with Michael and uh Jason coming home Friday night from the youth meeting and to see God forming these young men's lives and to be able to hear their testimonies in their story where they came from where they're at now and I don't mean to embarrass them this morning but God God is doing something God these new ones that have come God's doing something in their life but I can tell you it's not without pain it's not without suffering it's not without God challenging the mind and challenging everything they ever knew before it's painful friends but I'll tell you I complimented my brother to see that he's stuck with it he's sticking with it and and he's staying around the word of God a lot of people would have bailed out a long time ago but this young man here wants to be baptized here in the next couple weeks he's stuck with the word of God in name of Jesus God's doing something but it's not without pain we think sometimes the birth is just like that but a lot of times this I'm through a lot of pain and suffering losses can you say Amen challenges where the word is rebuking you and all these other things but all the end result is what we're looking at Hallelujah I could join my brother and grab his hand and step into a Rapture with brother Jason step into a Rapture with brother brother Michael a bunch of other stories in the church technically you shouldn't be here today through your story you shouldn't be here you shouldn't be saying Amen to the word of God there's a lot of other places you could be but it's God grace and the pain that you've been through that puts you here this morning your story every story is different but I guarantee you your story if it's of God will bring you to being ready for a rapture amen you don't like your story I don't like mine either we didn't get a choice of our story we didn't get a choice of what our family would go through we didn't get that choice but God certainly was watching over it and the most inhumane the most the most tragic things that happen to us can't get what much worse than Brothers throwing Joseph into the pit his own flesh and blood selling him to Egypt into slavery slavery you can't get much by the feeling rejected and betrayed and yet God's working to fulfill the vision for his life Hallelujah I feel his presence here this morning I may not be long I'm not feeling that well I'm feeling I'm not accepting those rattlesnakes and symptoms but in the in my soul I just feel that I love the presence of God I love to be near him I I love to hear his voice like brother Boaz said if you're if you're hearing that still small voice this morning you you know that he has to be real close for you to hear a still small voice I think God doesn't have to shout at us but it's a still small voice so your whole life changes when God's getting over you it it inconvenes it it gives you inconveniences in life doesn't it do that with a woman uh that's become pregnant and her life now becomes inconvenienced once again sisters you know all about it but life wasn't about it you can't always move around as easy as you did as you get bigger and I was suggesting those uh I read up on all this you know and I was I said hun I read up that you're when you're pregnant like you're supposed to be wearing snow skis around the house and walking in them because your back will get out of shape so do you want me to go buy you some snow skis and you're walking around the house no I don't want no school snow skins not gonna waddle around I'm already waddling around snow skis that's what they said and your life becomes inconvenienced and you can't do all the things you did before and you get you go through morning sickness and you go through these things and and then there's sisters that don't have any of that which everybody else is jealous of they don't have any of it but in most cases you have changes and you can't fit into the clothes that you fit in before and and what's going on and there's something growing inside of you there's a new life growing inside of you and this is a type of the spiritual is that when you have new life that's getting ready to be birthed in you there's going to be pain there's going to be suffering you're going to be inconvenienced so if I'm scaring all you young girls that are single right now don't you ever let me scare you because there's nothing there's nothing in the world like bringing forth a child into this world nothing like it the pain the suffering you probably will have it but there's nothing like the joy it's pain suffering can you say Amen but when the baby's there it's all done and Jesus said it when the baby comes then all of a sudden the joy that's there he said that when the joys there and the joy of what has come you don't remember any of the pain anymore I'm telling you friends we're getting ready to step into a dimension I said we're getting ready to step into a dimension real soon and there's things that you won't be able to remember no more you won't remember those bills that are due tomorrow you won't remember the hard time that you came through earlier in your marriage you won't remember all the struggles in your family you won't remember the people that done you wrong you won't remember any listen if God can forget it all then there's a place that we come that we can forget it all and when we step into that other dimension the pain the sorrow the trials our story we will not remember any of it because of the joy one of the favorite things in nature to me is the trees in the fall you know that I love the fall time and I didn't bring a picture with me I have a lot of pictures I collect them I found another one the other day in a in an office that we purchased I found a beautiful just a beautiful picture and those colors in the fall are so extremely brilliant and bright and the most beautiful thing you ever seen you know that and I love it it just it moves me every time I see the Smoky Mountains that way and just see all the different colors brilliant so I took a picture of this picture and I sent it to a brother who's going through a kind of a hard time right now in the church and going through some suffering and starting to see some things in his life that he needs to address and die out to and I know he's going through a death and I sent that to him and I says isn't it amazing only in the kingdom of God that you can have something so beautiful while they're going through a death [Music] it is only in the kingdom of God that Death Becomes a beautiful thing beautiful is the death of his Saints we don't want to lose our loved ones but in Christ it's not an end can you say Amen it's a beautiful thing they go on to their new body can you say man only in the kingdom of God is death a beautiful thing and I was encouraging the brother that you keep dying out to yourself you keep doing that the beauty of God is showing in your life we're not here to become another polished church and make sure everything's just perfect we're here that if we don't have repentance and you say well I already repented 20 years ago when I gave my heart to the Lord hasn't somebody told you that we have to repent all the time we need an altar almost daily in our lives so don't you dare come here every Sunday and just nod and say I'm okay the truth is we're not okay can you say man we always need more of God we always need more correction and the only way to change that is to repent we need repentance if God speaks to your heart and corrects something then just just set brother Paul aside somebody take that as from the Lord and the next step said God I cry out to you please burn the things of the world out of my life Take Me Lord this is almost wrapped up this is almost over you might not have another Sunday to repent who are we to assume that we need atmosphere of repentance and if you realize that the pain of dying out to your own desires because see the birth pains is in you individually too through pain through suffering through things that take us things we don't understand things that are hurtful to us things that where we suffer if we realize that the pain of dining out to our own desires and truly repenting and saying Lord I'm done when we come to that it's going to bring forth God's life within us and that's when we say every bit of pain was worth it maybe it's embarrassment I'm embarrassed that the Lord has exposed this in my life you'll get at the end of it say it was worse it was worth all the embarrassment people talk people said things other times we don't want people to know things and we try to and that's fine that's fine none of us like to be embarrassed but one day you're going to say this was worth all the embarrassment whatever man could say whatever man can do if it brings the end result it's worth all the pain worth all the trouble with all the trials it will be worth it all when we see Jesus thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information please contact us by visiting our website literallife.church and if you would like to
