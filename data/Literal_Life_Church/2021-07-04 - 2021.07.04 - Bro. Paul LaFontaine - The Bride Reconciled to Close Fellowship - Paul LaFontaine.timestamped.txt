[0:00] last sunday in hosea
[0:04] we're so glad this morning to know the
[0:05] master of the wind
[0:08] so no so glad to know he can calm the
[0:10] storm
[0:12] and i just might mention that incident
[0:14] where
[0:15] he allowed a son of god spoke to him to
[0:17] speak to the storm in colorado
[0:20] i might mention that here at the end of
[0:22] the service today
[0:24] but i'll mention one thing that the lord
[0:26] spoke to him after he spoke to the storm
[0:28] and a storm brewing that was going to
[0:30] come up in the colorado mountains and
[0:33] he did speak to the storm and within
[0:35] just a few minutes
[0:36] all the clouds went away with sunshine
[0:39] but it was after that that
[0:40] god spoke to him as he was walking back
[0:42] down the mountain and said
[0:44] why don't you just walk with me a while
[0:48] he said i'd love to walk with you it's
[0:50] what my service is about this morning
[0:52] god loves to walk with us i want to
[0:54] speak about the bride reconciled
[0:57] to close fellowship the bride reconciled
[0:59] the close fellowship
[1:01] you want to be close to him today so
[1:04] hosea chapter 2 and verse 14
[1:06] says therefore behold i will allure her
[1:12] and bring her into the wilderness and
[1:15] speak comfortably unto her it's god
[1:17] speaking about
[1:18] israel after she had been adulterous and
[1:20] after she had
[1:21] got away from him he said i will alert
[1:24] her i will
[1:25] call her to come away and bring her into
[1:27] the wilderness and
[1:28] i think god brings us into the
[1:30] wilderness sometimes that represents
[1:32] trials but i think in a wilderness with
[1:34] god
[1:35] it's so he can get us away from all the
[1:36] other voices that we're listening to
[1:39] and all the other busyness so he can
[1:41] speak comfortably to us
[1:44] and i will give her her vineyards from
[1:46] vince and the valley of acor
[1:48] for a door of hope and she shall sing
[1:50] there as in the days of her youth and as
[1:53] in the day when she came up
[1:54] out of the land of egypt and it shall be
[1:57] at that day saith the lord that thou
[1:58] shalt call me ishi
[2:00] husband and shalt call me no more
[2:04] bellai which means master you will no
[2:07] longer call me master
[2:08] but you will call me husband for i will
[2:11] take away the names of balaam out of her
[2:13] mouth and they shall
[2:14] no more be remembered by their name and
[2:16] in that day will i make a covenant
[2:18] for them with the beast of the field
[2:20] with the fowls of the air and with the
[2:22] creeping things of the ground
[2:23] and i will break the bowl and the sword
[2:25] and the battle of the earth out of the
[2:27] earth and will make them
[2:28] to lie down safely and i will betroth
[2:31] thee
[2:31] unto me forever yea i will betroth thee
[2:34] unto me in righteousness
[2:36] and in judgment and in loving kindness
[2:39] and in mercies
[2:40] i will even betroth thee unto me
[2:43] in faithfulness and thou shalt know
[2:47] the lord amen song of solomon chapter 2.
[3:13] the song of solomon chapter 2 and one
[3:15] verse there
[3:17] verse 10
[3:20] my beloved spake and said unto me
[3:24] rise up my love my
[3:27] fair one and come away heavenly father
[3:31] we just pray that you will bless us as
[3:32] we
[3:33] worship you lord and we can always sense
[3:37] when you're present it just makes us
[3:39] just
[3:40] want to reach out and tell you how much
[3:41] we love you lord
[3:44] we can always sense when there's another
[3:45] presence in the room lord besides all of
[3:47] us
[3:48] lord even the youngest child i feel
[3:50] sometimes consents
[3:52] there's something different that's in
[3:54] our midst
[3:55] lord jesus you come to minister to us
[3:58] this morning and to find us lord and
[4:01] draw us closer to yourself
[4:03] and lord we pray that you will find us
[4:06] and that you will draw us and that you
[4:07] will speak
[4:08] those things that you had in your mind
[4:10] in your heart
[4:11] to the people and when you bring those
[4:13] things father
[4:15] i pray that we would have the heart to
[4:17] be able to receive them
[4:19] with all of our hearts and lord know
[4:21] that it's a word from you
[4:23] that you love us so much that you've
[4:24] sent your word to heal us to restore us
[4:27] to strengthen us to encourage us to give
[4:30] us joy
[4:31] lord i pray whatever it would be this
[4:33] morning that we would have receptive
[4:35] hearts
[4:36] and be reconciled to you and we just
[4:38] pray that you'll
[4:39] just put that within me that i need this
[4:41] morning not my own words
[4:43] but put something within me lord that
[4:45] you can speak through me
[4:47] and call the people we pray in jesus
[4:49] name we ask him
[4:50] amen amen god bless you shake hands
[4:52] before you take your seat
[4:54] with someone god bless you each one and
[4:56] all of our visitors if i miss one of you
[4:58] welcome this morning it's so wonderful
[5:00] to have you
[5:04] the depth of god's reconciling power
[5:09] when he wants to reconcile one of his
[5:11] sons and daughters
[5:12] or his bride the depth of it goes beyond
[5:16] what i'm able to
[5:17] speak of myself or able to articulate
[5:20] and they've just been asking the lord to
[5:22] help me
[5:22] and i'll say personally through this
[5:24] little series of talking about
[5:26] the bride last weekend we we feel a real
[5:30] personal
[5:31] drawing towards the lord deeper than
[5:33] we've ever felt before
[5:35] for us to consider these things
[5:36] personally in our lives and in our
[5:38] hearts
[5:39] for all too often we tend to take for
[5:42] granted
[5:43] our relationship with the lord all too
[5:47] often
[5:47] in the times we live in everything else
[5:50] seems to take
[5:51] priority over our relationship with the
[5:53] lord
[5:54] i think some of us will be honest enough
[5:55] to say that's just the times we live in
[5:58] and things kind of crowd our lives and
[6:00] get in our way
[6:02] and even this reference in the scripture
[6:04] that he'll bring her back to when she
[6:06] sang as a young woman as a young bride
[6:09] i think god desires that original
[6:11] fellowship that you originally have from
[6:13] him but we have so many things
[6:14] to get in our way so many things to make
[6:17] us tired sometimes we're too tired even
[6:19] to give ourselves in a relationship and
[6:21] that's familiar because in our
[6:22] relationships
[6:23] with one another sometimes we're too
[6:25] tired sometimes we need to have a
[6:27] discussion and we're wore out for the
[6:29] whole day
[6:30] and we know there needs to be
[6:31] reconciliation and something said and
[6:33] we're just
[6:34] wore out from life that the energy to
[6:36] put into relationships is not
[6:38] left and that's the times we live in so
[6:41] if we're wore out of energy to put into
[6:42] relationships then we know
[6:44] that sometimes it can affect our
[6:47] relationship with the lord
[6:49] we also have a very in our culture a
[6:51] very uh
[6:52] material driven culture we have a very
[6:54] uh industrious type culture
[6:57] we have a push behind us all the time to
[6:59] to do things and to do this and do house
[7:02] projects and to do this and to push for
[7:04] war and then we got to save the money
[7:06] for it and then we got to make some
[7:07] extra money for it
[7:08] and we got to do this and we got to do
[7:09] that we got house projects and things
[7:11] and i'm not preaching at you i'm
[7:13] preaching at me because we can become
[7:15] overwhelmed and overcharged and over
[7:17] over or just overly worked can you say
[7:20] man
[7:21] and and and what i i think some things
[7:23] can suffer from that and we're not aware
[7:25] of it
[7:26] but i'll tell you when my relationship
[7:28] with the lord suffers all
[7:30] over those things i start to feel a bit
[7:33] guilty
[7:34] and i feel like that he's the one
[7:36] putting in
[7:37] trying to call me there's a song lauren
[7:39] o'haras used to
[7:40] to sing and it's god speaking he said i
[7:42] miss my time with you
[7:44] i missed my time with you our moments
[7:46] together
[7:47] i need to be with you each day and it
[7:50] hurts me when you say
[7:51] you're too busy trying to serve me busy
[7:55] trying to even serve me
[7:56] but how can you serve me when your
[7:58] spirit is empty
[8:00] and god says there's a longing in my
[8:02] heart wanting more than just a part of
[8:04] you
[8:05] it's true i miss my time with you
[8:10] and if there's any failure in the
[8:11] relationship to stay close
[8:13] it's it's on my side it's not on his
[8:15] side
[8:17] and so i don't think god makes us feel
[8:19] guilty about that i don't think god does
[8:20] god is not a pusher god is not one to
[8:23] push someone into relationship
[8:24] god does not want god is not a god of
[8:27] guilt can you say man
[8:29] god is not a god of guilt god is the god
[8:32] who wants to remove guilt
[8:34] the guilt of your sin can you say amen
[8:37] the guilt of your trouble the guilt of
[8:38] what you've been through
[8:40] god is a god if he went to calvary he
[8:42] was showing in love
[8:43] to remove all guilt and condemnation of
[8:46] sin can you say man
[8:47] but so many our lives are guilt-driven
[8:49] today and even when it comes to a heart
[8:51] that wants to serve god
[8:53] we feel guilt because we're not doing
[8:54] our part of the relationship
[8:56] but it's not god bringing that on us he
[8:58] just woos us
[8:59] and as the scripture even says here he's
[9:01] wooing her and
[9:02] alluring her because he wants to come
[9:05] into the wilderness
[9:06] and speak comfortable words and hear you
[9:08] speak back to him
[9:10] it's real become very personal to me
[9:12] because i'm a busy man
[9:14] and especially in the last few years uh
[9:16] busier some people used to say oh you're
[9:18] so busy you don't have any time for me i
[9:19] used to resent that but
[9:20] i have to admit now i'm a busy man now i
[9:23] still have time for something that's of
[9:25] god and something to help you that's who
[9:26] i'm here for
[9:28] that's what i'm here for but listen now
[9:30] my my concern
[9:31] personally is we're not so driven by
[9:34] other things
[9:35] that our relationship with god and the
[9:38] loving relationship and the communion
[9:40] and the fellowship is is is missed
[9:47] so you know when we talked last sunday
[9:50] about the depth of reconciliation
[9:53] we taught you that it goes beyond
[9:55] forgiveness to reconcile with a
[9:57] relationship
[9:58] is going beyond forgiveness i'm sorry
[10:00] and there's
[10:01] i forgive you but god in his
[10:03] reconciliation is not just
[10:06] bringing somebody to forgiveness even
[10:08] for salvation and all that
[10:09] but god is reconciling sons and
[10:11] daughters of god back to the fellowship
[10:13] they had
[10:14] that was in the garden of eden calvary
[10:16] has not just purchased
[10:18] forgiveness for our sins but calvary has
[10:20] washed away our sins
[10:22] and put us back into a relationship with
[10:25] jesus christ
[10:27] and that's what redemption is all about
[10:28] can you say amen and
[10:30] the the we find this theme then in is
[10:33] expressed in the service
[10:34] invisible union of the bride of christ
[10:37] we listened to it yesterday i'd
[10:38] encourage you to listen to it
[10:40] as brother branham speaks of invisible
[10:42] union of the bride of christ just the
[10:44] title
[10:45] makes you want to ponder and just look
[10:47] at it and realize
[10:49] what is god trying to say to us this
[10:51] invisible union
[10:53] of the bride of christ because you see
[10:55] it's about a union it's a union of a
[10:57] relationship
[10:58] and that's why last sunday i read you
[11:00] all the scriptures that god began to
[11:02] refer to his relationship
[11:03] as a as not bali is not not a master
[11:07] you used to refer to me as i'm your
[11:09] servant you're my master but he says i'm
[11:11] trying to move you to a relationship now
[11:14] of bride and he starts to refer to i'm
[11:16] the groom
[11:17] you're the bride and what he's saying in
[11:19] that this is the type of relationship
[11:21] i want and you know in this life that
[11:24] relationship
[11:25] is more exclusive and closer than any
[11:27] other relationship in life
[11:30] and when god begins to refer to his to
[11:32] his people that way
[11:33] you're not just my servants but your
[11:35] bride we ought to pay attention
[11:37] and what we've become in the message is
[11:39] that i'm in the bride because i go to a
[11:40] message church
[11:41] i'm in the bride because i have message
[11:43] tapes i'm in the bride because i go to
[11:45] this and no no
[11:46] it's not a movement it's not a movement
[11:48] it's a relationship
[11:50] by a new birth it's a union between you
[11:53] and christ
[11:54] it's an invisible marriage that takes
[11:57] place
[11:59] that's what this message is all about
[12:02] we've made it a movement
[12:03] we've made pride because we're part of
[12:05] this we're part of that i'm in the bride
[12:07] because i have message books i'm in the
[12:08] bride
[12:09] because i go to brother paul's church
[12:10] but i always correct that and say no no
[12:12] no no this is a by a new birth this is a
[12:15] relationship
[12:16] with jesus christ i read you to the
[12:18] quote a couple weeks ago brother bam
[12:19] says i don't bring a message one moment
[12:22] one moment to be able to build a
[12:24] denomination
[12:25] or to build an organization or point the
[12:28] people to me
[12:28] but he said if i can accomplish this one
[12:31] thing and that's to establish a
[12:33] relationship
[12:34] between god and the people it's the
[12:37] purpose of the message
[12:39] and if you're invested in the message 30
[12:40] years and you're in no relationship with
[12:42] him
[12:43] then then you need to examine
[12:46] your entire life and examine why you
[12:49] believe this thing
[12:52] because this is not about books and
[12:54] tapes or a movement
[12:55] or what you grew up in this is about a
[12:58] person
[13:00] this message is about a person
[13:03] see while other people are preaching the
[13:05] person yeah they do the portions of
[13:07] revelation they know
[13:08] they preach about the person but under
[13:10] the message the person of christ has
[13:12] been
[13:12] fully unveiled to us planet earth has
[13:15] never received more of a revelation of
[13:17] jesus christ
[13:18] than under this message we know him by
[13:21] god's grace we know him for all
[13:24] that he is
[13:27] and that's for the bride to know
[13:30] and uh so it's you know a union of a
[13:33] marriage is deeper than a servant
[13:36] or a like a a physical brother or
[13:39] physical sister or
[13:40] uh or a servant and a master
[13:43] relationship but it's bride and
[13:44] bridegroom
[13:45] and we took you through all the
[13:46] references to show you as he begins to
[13:48] speak in isaiah
[13:49] and through the prophets and then john
[13:51] the baptist and then he refers to bride
[13:53] and bridegroom
[13:54] and then we come to the end of the bible
[13:56] where he says the marriage of the land
[13:57] has come and the bride hath made herself
[14:00] ready it's god that's starting to
[14:02] refer to there's a special group of
[14:04] people there's an elect lady
[14:06] there's one that's not servants that but
[14:08] they're
[14:09] my wife
[14:12] they're my wife and to me it should
[14:15] speak to us now okay
[14:16] praise the lord i'm his wife but it
[14:19] calls me
[14:20] to an intimate relationship with him
[14:26] if he speaks of a bride and he says i
[14:28] will have a bride
[14:29] then we must understand and feel honored
[14:32] by that
[14:34] because the level of that term being his
[14:37] chosen bride
[14:38] his chosen bride and how many believe
[14:40] that how many of you are his chosen
[14:42] bride
[14:43] you know when a man chooses he's got all
[14:45] the all the women and these guys
[14:47] if he's a holy ghost-filled man he's
[14:48] looking for a holy ghost-filled woman
[14:50] that's all he's looking for the holy
[14:51] ghost filled
[14:52] uh brother brahm says in that marriage
[14:53] and divorce if if she's pretty or
[14:55] choosing of a bride
[14:56] if she's pretty that's great but she's
[14:58] got to have the character of the holy
[15:00] ghost and there's things we're looking
[15:01] for
[15:01] so but then that narrows down narrows
[15:03] down you're not going to marry all those
[15:04] women you can't marry all those women
[15:06] and there might be a lot of lovely ones
[15:07] filled with the holy ghost but yet
[15:09] there's going to be one day a chosen one
[15:11] i chose her
[15:12] she chose me and by the way she has a
[15:14] choice too by the way
[15:17] it's not just you choosing her she has a
[15:19] choice as well god doesn't override our
[15:21] choice
[15:22] we choose him as well but he chose us
[15:25] before the foundation
[15:26] of the world and we feel the honor of
[15:27] him he chose me as his bride and we
[15:30] respond back but you see now it's not
[15:32] just about the term
[15:33] it's about you have been chosen his is
[15:36] chosen bride
[15:37] and it's an honor to hold that title but
[15:40] with it goes
[15:41] this exclusive unashamed relationship
[15:44] with one another this intimacy this love
[15:46] that is shared and when you share that
[15:49] love with him
[15:50] you don't share that love with anyone
[15:52] else
[15:56] the intimacy that you have with christ
[15:59] some of those things cannot
[16:01] be shared with anyone else and the
[16:03] worship that you have for him
[16:05] cannot be shared with anyone else and
[16:08] this is what happens in the book of
[16:09] hosea as
[16:10] israel starts to share her heart with
[16:13] just idols and with everyone and you'll
[16:16] find in the book of hosea especially in
[16:18] that book
[16:19] he refers to this adulterous
[16:21] relationship and i know
[16:22] that's a very extreme thing to talk
[16:24] about in the service it was extreme for
[16:26] them to talk about
[16:27] it was very open open but god
[16:30] was not holding back he was saying that
[16:32] i feel
[16:33] as you begin to give your hearts to
[16:35] isles i'm going to say that
[16:37] it's like being an adulterous
[16:39] relationship where my wife is sharing
[16:41] her her worship and her life and her
[16:45] heart
[16:45] with other husbands and with other men
[16:50] and it's a very jolting thing and i want
[16:52] to i want to elaborate a little bit on
[16:53] it this morning and i'm prepared
[16:55] for it to get quiet a little bit and
[16:57] then maybe at the end
[16:59] you'll you'll see what i'm trying to
[17:00] present to you by the grace of god
[17:04] if he speaks of a bride and he says we
[17:06] have one and we have that term
[17:08] the chosen bride it's special it's
[17:10] beyond a casual acquaintance
[17:12] uh it's beyond uh just the relationship
[17:16] of an
[17:17] uncle that bails you out financially
[17:19] every now and then
[17:21] it's beyond the relationship of a
[17:23] grandpa because even brother brown says
[17:25] god has no grandchildren in the kingdom
[17:27] of god
[17:28] because there's a difference in a parent
[17:30] and a grandchildren a parent will
[17:31] correct a child
[17:32] a grandpa or grandma becomes dodie
[17:35] sometimes
[17:35] and when the child needs to be corrected
[17:37] sometimes grandparents will back off
[17:39] sometimes they try to back their parents
[17:41] off don't thank them
[17:43] they didn't really mean it i'm speaking
[17:45] from experience
[17:48] but then sometimes you want them to
[17:49] spank them you better spank that kid
[17:52] but we don't want to do it but people
[17:54] have made the christian walk
[17:56] where daddy's a dodi it's a dodie
[17:59] grandpa they're serving
[18:01] and i can get money from him anytime and
[18:03] i can get if i get hurt i can cry to him
[18:05] anytime and i can go this and i
[18:07] go this but to see there's no there's no
[18:10] marriage relationship there
[18:11] it's just a dodie grandpa and
[18:13] grandchildren brother evan says god
[18:14] doesn't have any grandchildren
[18:16] he has sons and daughters birthed by the
[18:19] kingdom of god birth by the new birth
[18:21] and and so now we see then it's not a
[18:25] grandpa it's not a housemaid and i read
[18:28] to you some women
[18:29] in the bible last sunday i referred to
[18:31] it was interesting to see
[18:33] in some of these women like sarah and
[18:36] esther
[18:37] and um uh referred to uh
[18:40] abigail as well and many of these women
[18:44] they came to god for a need or they came
[18:46] to their husband rebecca came
[18:47] and she was gonna just do a nice act of
[18:49] watering the camels
[18:51] of of isaac but she didn't realize these
[18:54] women didn't realize abigail didn't
[18:55] realize
[18:56] they would actually be given and chosen
[18:58] as the bride as the wife
[19:00] they just came to they just came to give
[19:02] a service to him
[19:03] i have a need in my life and sometimes
[19:05] we didn't realize that
[19:06] you had a need maybe you were coming to
[19:08] god for some i'm in a desperate
[19:09] situation in my marriage or my family or
[19:11] whatever it is
[19:12] and you're coming to him for certain
[19:14] things but then you realize
[19:16] our needs can be met but then then when
[19:18] we become his bride and he chooses his
[19:20] bride
[19:21] it's not about just our needs being met
[19:26] but now i'm his wife so how how can i
[19:29] serve
[19:29] my husband christ's needs
[19:34] amen and that becomes different because
[19:36] nobody else wants to serve him that way
[19:38] but the bride does because
[19:40] brother branham says as a wife serves
[19:42] her husband
[19:44] she serves the lord why is that ever
[19:47] not popular anymore
[19:51] that's not politically correct well i
[19:54] can read about
[19:55] 50 000 other quotes that are becoming
[19:57] more more and more not politically
[19:59] correct to read
[20:00] but i still believe the word is the word
[20:02] and i still believe when you honor
[20:04] relationships the way god said they
[20:06] should be not out of demand but out of
[20:08] respect
[20:09] your homes your marriages and your
[20:11] families
[20:12] will have power and be blessed you don't
[20:16] tamper with this word and accept new
[20:18] modern ideas in modern ways and not pay
[20:21] for it
[20:23] families are paying dearly in this world
[20:27] because they've got away from the
[20:29] principles of god's word
[20:31] and the blessed position of a woman
[20:34] and that that connection she makes with
[20:36] a man
[20:37] and her husband she can build him up and
[20:39] she can
[20:40] set him on on fire to do what he needs
[20:43] to do
[20:43] like no other person in this world
[20:47] it's the same spiritually he didn't want
[20:49] just a servant
[20:50] to just run and go do what they're told
[20:52] to do christ
[20:54] wanted a bride
[21:00] this is an exclusive love it's an
[21:03] exclusive fellowship it's not shared
[21:05] with anyone
[21:06] this love is a different kind of love
[21:08] and that's why then there
[21:10] there there when there has been a true
[21:12] union
[21:13] for like my mom and my dad for 56 years
[21:15] with someone
[21:16] when there's been a union like that a
[21:18] true union for 56 years with someone
[21:21] when god takes one of those life is not
[21:24] what it was anymore when they have to
[21:26] lose their loved one
[21:27] you've been with somebody that long my
[21:29] mom talks about it with me
[21:30] you've been with somebody that long in a
[21:32] true union and god takes one of them i
[21:35] was reading a story yesterday
[21:36] of a couple in that uh that condo that
[21:39] collapsed in florida
[21:40] and they had just went across the street
[21:42] to have a a
[21:44] lunch with their son or whatever it was
[21:45] a dinner with his son because he was
[21:48] he could see their thing across in their
[21:50] condo and he wanted to live there and
[21:51] watch over them
[21:52] had the last dinner with them and they
[21:54] always said their whole life we don't
[21:55] want one to go before the other because
[21:57] they loved each other so much
[21:58] and sure enough they went down in that
[22:00] thing and they went together and the son
[22:01] he said that's the only joy i have
[22:03] is they got to go together but you take
[22:06] a one who's been together 65 years
[22:09] like my mom and some of these other
[22:10] marriages and god takes one of them
[22:12] there's that that void in the heart none
[22:15] of us will understand that
[22:16] and why is it because there was this
[22:18] union that shared
[22:19] with with no one else in this world
[22:24] that's the kind of marriages we need
[22:26] that's the kind of union we need
[22:29] it was the garden it was the fall in the
[22:32] garden
[22:33] that made adam and eve begin to become
[22:36] selfish and blame everybody else for
[22:38] their problems
[22:40] they had unity and oneness and then all
[22:43] of a sudden when satan got in and began
[22:45] to mess up the family and mess up the
[22:46] marriage
[22:47] when they fell by sin all of a sudden
[22:50] god comes to adam
[22:51] and says what what has happened and he
[22:54] turns to her instead of
[22:56] instead of saying we fell together he
[22:59] said
[22:59] the wife that you gave me she's
[23:03] the problem well if he was still in
[23:06] oneness he'd never done that to his wife
[23:09] i've been in counseling sessions where
[23:11] the the husband he didn't do nothing
[23:13] wrong he's standing there blaming the
[23:14] wife the whole time just blaming him
[23:16] blair said she's my problem if she would
[23:18] get straightened out
[23:18] our marriage would be fine and i'm the
[23:21] guy that's got to say
[23:23] no your marriage would not be fine
[23:25] mainly because your attitude
[23:29] but you take someone that has been
[23:32] married that long in the in
[23:34] in a union and you realize 56 years
[23:37] because the other person was so attached
[23:39] to you in spirit
[23:40] more than anyone else in life not even a
[23:43] new husband or wife can replace that
[23:45] sometimes they want to just go on
[23:48] to be with the lord so they can be with
[23:50] their mate and to be with the lord
[23:52] life is never the same that's the type
[23:54] of close union but friends
[23:56] i want it to be that close with christ
[24:00] i want my relationship with him to be
[24:02] that close can you say amen
[24:04] that i can never be apart from him it
[24:06] hurts me
[24:07] to be out of fellowship with him it
[24:09] hurts me to be apart from him
[24:13] this isn't can you say man this isn't
[24:14] just a part-time affair can you say amen
[24:18] life is a life can i want to live
[24:21] so that i can never be apart from him
[24:23] this isn't a part-time affair it isn't
[24:25] some
[24:25] flirtatious relationship marriage is not
[24:28] just a flirtatious relationship
[24:30] or a passing thing or you see a person
[24:33] for one night or for one hour or
[24:35] whatever it is
[24:36] that's not what marriage is it's a
[24:38] lifelong fellowship
[24:40] intimacy and relationship can you say
[24:43] amen
[24:45] i didn't finish the story but when sin
[24:47] came in then we have adam
[24:49] instead of standing with his wife
[24:50] blaming his wife and when god went to
[24:53] eve
[24:53] eve says the serpent she beguiled me and
[24:56] all of a sudden everybody is blaming
[24:58] everybody
[24:58] else everybody's blaming everybody else
[25:01] instead of trying to find a unity
[25:03] in the marriage this stuff some of this
[25:06] stuff is not my note so somebody must
[25:08] need it
[25:12] there is a a oneness that is special
[25:15] to a marriage and it is a marriage
[25:18] relationship with god as well with
[25:20] christ
[25:21] and and so now we live in a world of
[25:24] relationships where partners
[25:27] go to another partner just to get their
[25:30] needs met
[25:31] every now and then but that's not a
[25:34] union
[25:36] that's the world we live in matter of
[25:38] fact you know some people maybe want me
[25:40] to speak of world events and
[25:42] stuff going on i'll tell you friends
[25:44] outside of these doors
[25:46] that's how i felt last night i don't
[25:48] even want to look at the news anymore
[25:52] when you walk outside these doors you're
[25:54] living in the craziest world that's ever
[25:56] been on the face of the earth
[25:58] people brother bram say they go insane
[26:00] they are there
[26:02] we are the news and mothers want to go
[26:04] in the military
[26:06] and they want to be honored as sergeants
[26:07] and move up in the in the ranks of
[26:09] military
[26:10] mothers wanting to do that and everybody
[26:11] promoted i think it's a wonderful thing
[26:12] i can be a better mother that way
[26:14] and i said god how deceived
[26:17] can a person be in their minds god never
[26:21] intended for a mom to go away in the
[26:23] name of her country
[26:24] to be away from her children that long
[26:26] but how you're not going to tell them
[26:28] now
[26:28] they're going off in their minds they've
[26:30] gone crazy no one thinks
[26:31] properly about this stuff anymore and
[26:34] that's not there's more crazy stuff than
[26:36] that
[26:36] some stuff i can't even mention over the
[26:38] pulpit you live in a crazy world i'll
[26:40] tell you
[26:40] i'm glad to be in the word and i'm glad
[26:42] to have a place like this
[26:44] set aside that i can come out of this
[26:46] crazy world
[26:48] but relationship in the world they can
[26:50] just go with any partner just to get
[26:52] their needs met every now and then but
[26:54] that's not a union
[26:55] i wonder how many people want to be
[26:56] called the bride and all they do is talk
[26:59] every now and then with the bridegroom
[27:00] you don't you see you just everyone
[27:04] we have sometimes sunday morning
[27:06] christians
[27:07] sunday morning is that that's the only
[27:09] time i got to give my son anymore i want
[27:10] it it's good to be in church i want to
[27:11] be in church
[27:12] but this just isn't a sunday morning
[27:14] affair under this message
[27:18] this is a relationship every day that
[27:21] you are connected in union with christ
[27:24] every day and when others in your family
[27:28] are distant from christ and they're not
[27:30] that's a real challenge because you've
[27:32] got to realize
[27:33] i'm not following them i'm staying in my
[27:35] relationship with the lord
[27:37] and don't be just sunday morning
[27:39] christians sunday morning people that
[27:41] are just
[27:42] that that just that's when i go that's
[27:44] when i spend my time
[27:46] i feel better about myself when i leave
[27:48] i'm here to tell you this is a marriage
[27:50] relationship to be married
[27:52] to christ the word can you say man and
[27:54] it is a close
[27:55] relationship not just sundays when we're
[27:58] in church
[28:01] you don't micromanage a relationship
[28:03] like marriage
[28:06] you're part of one another how many can
[28:08] marriages can say you don't micromanage
[28:10] one another
[28:13] just me and brother kyle i guess
[28:17] now it's a why why don't you micromanage
[28:19] one another because it's a different
[28:21] relationship you can micromanage a
[28:24] servant
[28:27] you can micromanage your kids sometimes
[28:29] sometimes
[28:31] but in marriage it's a different
[28:32] relationship
[28:34] and you don't micromanage this i i need
[28:36] you this certain time
[28:38] and i need you but here i don't need you
[28:41] and so i need
[28:42] my me time and you just you know and no
[28:45] i've told some marriages in counseling
[28:47] you shouldn't have got married because
[28:49] you don't understand what the marriage
[28:51] relationship
[28:51] is you can't go off and i'm just going
[28:54] to do my own thing and i don't need you
[28:56] no no it doesn't work that way
[28:57] this is a different relationship but we
[29:00] do that with the lord sometimes
[29:02] we micromanage our relationship with the
[29:05] lord
[29:05] i come to him when i need him
[29:09] but what about when he needs you
[29:13] he doesn't need us well he created us to
[29:17] be his bride
[29:18] he loves us he wants time with us
[29:22] i didn't know the service was going to
[29:24] go this way but
[29:26] i feel his presence here and i'm going
[29:27] to stay in this channel
[29:31] the marriage relationship people have
[29:35] put it in an affair
[29:36] they put it in it they bring their
[29:38] selfishness into it
[29:40] and i'm telling you you have to be burnt
[29:42] of all your selfishness
[29:44] and you can't micromanage and say this
[29:47] this that and the other you can't do
[29:48] that it's not that type of relationship
[29:51] now not only is the bride and groom
[29:52] spoke of in the nature of relationship
[29:55] in the bible but adultery is spoken of
[29:57] in the bible both naturally and
[29:58] spiritually
[29:59] and it's spoken very plainly adultery
[30:02] also fornication
[30:03] also having an affair and also flirting
[30:06] with someone
[30:07] who you're not married to all of this is
[30:10] in the bible
[30:11] and so and many times god crosses it
[30:13] over to spiritually
[30:16] and he talks about i hate to
[30:18] mention that in public but the bible
[30:20] talks about
[30:21] and that means that it's speaking
[30:22] spiritually also of the natural
[30:24] woman who gives herself to all kinds of
[30:26] men but also
[30:29] it speaks of a spiritual we have the
[30:31] great horror we have the church we have
[30:32] ones and what it is basically
[30:34] spiritually given your heart and given
[30:36] yourself to any seed
[30:37] of any man but god wants an exclusive
[30:40] relationship where a wife only receives
[30:42] the seed
[30:43] of her husband
[30:46] so if the bible if the bible speaks of
[30:49] these things
[30:49] all these things an a fair relationship
[30:52] an adultery relationship
[30:54] flirting someone i want to let you know
[30:56] all of these pornography
[30:57] all of these were never meant to be and
[31:00] they're a damage to a true marriage
[31:02] and a true union you can't have a true
[31:05] union
[31:05] you might be living with a woman but if
[31:08] you got pornography in your life
[31:10] you'll never have the right union with
[31:12] that woman god gave you
[31:15] those things are of the world and they
[31:18] damage the union and
[31:19] sometimes you can live with them for
[31:21] years but if you dabble in flirting with
[31:23] other women
[31:24] whether you know them or not it's going
[31:26] to bring damage to the union
[31:28] you can't have open fellowship with one
[31:31] another
[31:32] your intimacy cannot be right when
[31:35] there's another woman involved
[31:39] so god speaks pretty plain and proverbs
[31:42] in so many places it's such a damage
[31:44] so it's the same spiritually and so
[31:46] because it's throughout the bible i have
[31:47] pretty good grounds to speak about
[31:48] spiritual adultery
[31:50] it's all through the bible it's all
[31:51] through the message and you just have to
[31:53] trust me on that
[31:54] is that some places the way brother
[31:55] branham words things it's so plain
[31:58] sometimes can i read that it's just so
[32:00] plain because god
[32:01] had to be playing that not only in the
[32:03] natural relationship you don't play with
[32:05] these things
[32:06] it is a it is a special relationship
[32:09] you don't play with it you give it
[32:11] you're all can you say man
[32:12] but then when we come to our lord we
[32:14] don't play with our relationship with
[32:16] the lord
[32:17] he loves us we're to love him back we're
[32:19] to stay as close to him
[32:21] as we can stay in the hour we live in he
[32:24] wants fellowship with us
[32:25] and this quote here we're going to read
[32:27] in the second coming of the lord early
[32:29] on in the message
[32:30] he says could you imagine if you guys
[32:32] have that quote could you imagine coming
[32:34] in at nighttime
[32:35] tired weary worn if you're a farmer
[32:37] mechanic preacher whatever you are come
[32:39] in
[32:39] when you go to your little home you're
[32:41] longing to you can get there you open
[32:43] the door and a sweet little wife stands
[32:44] there she greets you
[32:45] she's all prettied and cleaned up she
[32:47] walks over and kisses you on the cheek
[32:49] she says dad you're tired
[32:50] she sets you down in a chair she sets
[32:52] herself down in your lap and she puts
[32:54] her arms around you and she pats you it
[32:56] just seems like then that you're not
[32:57] tired something picks you up
[32:58] it's something that god gave you for
[33:00] that purpose it's a part of you
[33:02] now she's a true wife but if those lips
[33:04] has kissed another man that day
[33:06] or some other time what if you're
[33:08] conscious of that what if them arms has
[33:10] hugged another man
[33:12] she is absolutely abomination on your
[33:14] lap that burn
[33:15] kiss burns like a judas kiss those arms
[33:18] you'd rather they wouldn't be around you
[33:19] oh
[33:20] may she be all she all prettied up her
[33:22] hair may be curly
[33:23] her eyes may be brown her cheeks may be
[33:26] rosy her little skirts may be ironed
[33:28] she may be so pretty but if that real
[33:30] genuine godly respect and love and
[33:32] confidence isn't there
[33:33] she'd be better off to stay off your lap
[33:35] you don't want you don't want nothing to
[33:37] do with her she's an indebted to you i
[33:39] don't care how pretty she makes herself
[33:41] she's still wrong until she has proven
[33:43] to be a real genuine sweetheart
[33:45] loving nobody but you no other kiss from
[33:48] her lips but yours
[33:49] no other arms must hold her but yours
[33:52] and you know it
[33:53] what a feeling what a consolation
[33:56] that is husband and wife which is a type
[33:59] of
[33:59] christ and his church and when you go to
[34:01] your church you may have the best pews
[34:03] in the city you may have the highest
[34:05] steeple there
[34:06] is in the city you may have the best
[34:07] pipe organ you may dress the best
[34:09] you you may sing like a mockingbird but
[34:12] all of that
[34:13] if you're kissing and flirting with the
[34:15] world that kiss on the cheeks of christ
[34:18] is the judastarian kiss
[34:25] he doesn't want nothing to do with you
[34:28] he looks upon your wedding engagement
[34:30] ring and he finds the tablet move
[34:32] he finds love has gone it's a form he
[34:34] finds
[34:35] loyalty is gone you've committed
[34:37] fornications with the world
[34:38] you go to dances and boogie woogie
[34:40] parties and watch old dirty television
[34:42] programs
[34:43] you are committing adultery with christ
[34:46] on him
[34:47] as calling him your husband that's
[34:50] pretty straight
[34:52] but when we look at dirty television on
[34:55] our phones
[34:57] and i say phones because televisions are
[34:59] almost out
[35:01] and we want to claim that we're the
[35:02] bride of jesus christ
[35:04] we're committing spiritual adultery
[35:07] now you excuse me for being straight but
[35:10] i'm preaching to everybody here this
[35:11] morning
[35:12] this is a relationship that's honored
[35:14] and sacred
[35:16] you make a mistake you quickly brings i
[35:18] have made a mistake and you got a
[35:19] husband i believe
[35:20] that will forgive you but what he wants
[35:22] is faithfulness
[35:24] what he wants is an exclusive
[35:26] relationship he doesn't want you
[35:28] flirting with the world all week long
[35:30] and then come you raise your hands in
[35:32] church on sunday that's not what this
[35:34] is it's not what the message is it's not
[35:36] what the bride is
[35:37] it's not what christianity even is
[35:39] that's not what it's about it's just
[35:41] an affair with jesus christ it is a
[35:44] committed
[35:45] faithful relationship with him
[35:49] that's why you talk to people say if
[35:50] you're not ready to make that commitment
[35:52] in my
[35:52] you better wait until god has moved your
[35:54] heart i'm ready to make a lifelong
[35:55] commitment
[35:56] this is a marriage i talk to young
[35:58] children being baptized and i say
[35:59] there's two or three steps for reasons
[36:01] why we get baptized
[36:02] and that is we die to ourselves and so
[36:04] we're put under the water as if we
[36:06] what do we do with dead people we bury
[36:08] dead people right the
[36:09] little kid says yes and we bury people
[36:11] so you're buried in christ but i don't
[36:13] leave you underneath the water you come
[36:14] back up again
[36:15] the new man in christ it's a type to the
[36:17] church can you say man
[36:19] but i said one of the parts of baptism
[36:21] is that you take on his name
[36:23] and that's an honor i will baptize you
[36:25] today in the name of the lord jesus
[36:27] christ
[36:28] you take on his name as his bride and
[36:31] that means everything that you do you
[36:33] should watch what you do
[36:34] you should taste stay close to the word
[36:36] because now you represent
[36:38] jesus christ you're a christian
[36:42] follower wife of jesus christ
[36:46] you don't go out and say i was baptized
[36:47] today and go right back to the things of
[36:49] the world no no
[36:50] i've changed my name i'm no longer my
[36:52] name but i'm taking on
[36:54] mrs jesus christ that's a special thing
[36:59] when brother brown preached these things
[37:00] choosing of a bride and marriage and
[37:02] divorce and
[37:03] and the restoration of the bride tree
[37:05] and invisible union of the bride
[37:08] these are not just sermons but they are
[37:10] announcements to this generation
[37:12] that this is the time i'm going to have
[37:14] my bride
[37:20] hallelujah now
[37:24] the human spirit can only take so much
[37:27] unfaithfulness
[37:29] when a person's married or even a
[37:32] even a boyfriend or girlfriend you know
[37:35] we
[37:36] this thing is so loose anymore when when
[37:38] the prophet talks about kissing
[37:41] and you come home and your wife has
[37:42] kissed another man
[37:44] there's something about the our human
[37:46] spirit that it hurts us
[37:48] terribly if we're married or even a
[37:51] boyfriend girlfriend
[37:52] if we know that they have been with
[37:54] another person or kissed another person
[37:56] or whatever
[37:57] that that doesn't go so well even if
[37:59] it's a boyfriend or girlfriend
[38:01] hey you're committed to me i'm your
[38:03] boyfriend and your girlfriend
[38:04] what are you doing over there what are
[38:05] you talking to her for there's all these
[38:08] jealousies that rise up and some of them
[38:10] are normal
[38:11] some of them are normal because the
[38:12] bible says god's jealous over us
[38:15] with can you say amen god's jealous over
[38:18] you
[38:19] and paul said as the prophet i'm jealous
[38:22] over you as a bride with a godly
[38:24] jealousy
[38:25] did you know there was such a thing
[38:28] god is jealous over your soul and your
[38:31] relationship
[38:32] and you being his bride he's jealous
[38:34] over you with a
[38:35] godly jealousy and so some of this is
[38:38] normal but you'll watch it
[38:39] it's that our human spirit can't handle
[38:41] someone being unfaithful
[38:42] when we've been committed as a marriage
[38:44] or a friend even a friend
[38:45] we we we are crushed when someone
[38:49] violates
[38:49] our relationship the human spirit a wife
[38:53] especially
[38:54] cannot hardly handle it when there's
[38:56] been unfaithfulness from a man in a
[38:57] marriage
[38:58] a man i just heard i just had a
[39:00] testimony last sunday
[39:01] of a man and uh he was talking to me a
[39:04] little bit about it
[39:05] and my it's just he found out uh early
[39:08] on there was things going on
[39:10] and he says i wept i wept for hours i
[39:12] went for days
[39:13] i hadn't heard that too mentioned a man
[39:14] but but it doesn't only crush a woman it
[39:16] crushes a man
[39:17] found out my wife was unfaithful
[39:20] and it just couldn't believe it couldn't
[39:23] believe it just
[39:23] crushed him just wept for days because
[39:26] the human spirit
[39:27] now friends think of that think if your
[39:30] husband failed you or your wife failed
[39:32] you
[39:32] or said i want a divorce or think of you
[39:35] young people think when you're going
[39:37] with someone it looks like everything's
[39:38] going well and they just
[39:39] they go with someone else overnight
[39:42] think of how you feel
[39:44] the human spirit doesn't handle it well
[39:46] i want you to think of how i feel
[39:48] and think how god feels
[39:51] because you can multiply it by 100
[39:53] million times
[39:54] and see how his love has been crushed
[39:59] that he's been hurt i miss my time with
[40:02] you
[40:03] they're giving their hearts to
[40:05] everything else here and
[40:07] and they committed their heart to me
[40:11] it shows up in the human spirit you know
[40:13] i realize i'm talking here to
[40:15] many in the streaming and some here that
[40:17] been through relationships that broken
[40:20] down
[40:20] families i am excited to have
[40:24] many people here that have come from
[40:26] broken families
[40:27] experienced divorce experience these
[40:29] different things
[40:30] and guess what everything that has
[40:33] fallen
[40:34] and void in your life my god and i'm
[40:38] watching this
[40:39] my god can fill the void
[40:43] he can restore relationships and we
[40:45] believe in that
[40:46] but if the other party is not ready or
[40:48] they're not going to do it
[40:49] god can restore you in such a
[40:53] relationship with jesus christ
[40:55] that you can go on with the lord
[41:00] it wasn't for the grace of god some of
[41:02] your marriages here wouldn't still be
[41:03] together
[41:04] can you say man but you know boyfriend
[41:08] girlfriend it's
[41:09] even that affects you know i don't know
[41:12] if some of you older ones has been going
[41:13] to my church for many years remember i
[41:14] used to like tell the story of the
[41:16] little
[41:18] girl who wrote gave a picture to her
[41:21] boyfriend because she
[41:23] he asked for a picture of her so they're
[41:25] going together now we're going together
[41:27] yeah
[41:27] we're boyfriend and girlfriend and so
[41:29] she writes she gets this big picture and
[41:31] she writes a big thing with note with it
[41:33] says
[41:34] honey i love you i'd go to the end of
[41:37] the earth with you
[41:38] i love you so much and she went on and
[41:40] on with poems and everything
[41:43] this is a this is an eternal thing i
[41:46] love you and my feelings right she just
[41:48] went on
[41:48] and on and on and then the guy turned
[41:50] the picture over and it said p.s
[41:53] if we ever break up i'd like to have my
[41:55] picture back
[41:58] and i'd like to talk about that because
[41:59] that's the world we live in
[42:02] they stand at the altar and that's why i
[42:05] try to say hey listen let's mean what
[42:06] you say
[42:07] you take that vow before god you better
[42:10] mean it
[42:12] but today they can take it and be
[42:16] separated the next week because the
[42:19] world has taught us
[42:21] they have watered down the marriage
[42:23] relationship and my message to you is
[42:25] that
[42:25] satan would like to water down what
[42:28] bride and bridegroom really
[42:30] mean it's not that you came to all the
[42:32] conventions in the message
[42:34] this is an intimacy and relationship
[42:36] with him
[42:37] that if your world falls apart if
[42:40] everything falls apart if preachers
[42:41] leave the message
[42:43] god didn't leave you your husband didn't
[42:45] leave you can you say amen
[42:47] if your family falls apart you can go on
[42:49] with the relationship with jesus christ
[42:52] this relationship should not end
[42:54] [Applause]
[42:57] because he's faithful to you other
[42:59] people may not be faithful but he will
[43:01] always be faithful to you
[43:03] he just wants us to be faithful to him
[43:10] you can't have an affair with the world
[43:12] and this is the way brother brown
[43:14] lords it now just say the way you say it
[43:16] you can't have an affair with the world
[43:17] or a denominational fair affair and be
[43:20] married to christ at the same time and
[43:21] this is a term he begins using
[43:23] in invisible union coming from the
[43:25] scripture if you guys would bring up
[43:26] romans 7 verse 3.
[43:28] romans 7 3 is his text in invisible
[43:30] union where he says so then
[43:32] while her husband romans 7 and verse 3
[43:36] so then while her husband liveth she be
[43:38] married to another
[43:40] man she shall be called an adulteress
[43:42] but if her husband be
[43:44] dead she is free from that law so that
[43:47] she is no
[43:48] adulteress though she be married to
[43:50] another man
[43:51] so now he's speaking naturally and he's
[43:53] saying now if her husband's dead
[43:55] she's free to marry because why if she
[43:58] has two husbands if she has two
[44:00] two men and even in this case where
[44:02] she's going to the two men
[44:03] she is an adulteress god never intended
[44:06] for it to be that way
[44:08] but that's the natural part of it that
[44:09] the woman can't be remarried unless her
[44:12] husband is dead
[44:13] romans 7 4 goes to the spiritual verse 4
[44:15] please
[44:16] wherefore my brethren ye also are become
[44:18] dead to the law
[44:20] by the body of christ that ye should be
[44:22] married to another
[44:23] even to him who's raised from the dead
[44:26] that we should bring forth fruit from
[44:27] god
[44:28] spiritually speaking that old things of
[44:30] the world
[44:31] and that denominational husband has to
[44:34] be dead
[44:34] so you can come to a new birth with
[44:36] christ alone
[44:39] and if that denominational husband is
[44:41] not dead
[44:42] or if you're having an affair with the
[44:44] denominate with
[44:45] the system of denomination and trying to
[44:47] still embrace christ
[44:49] and that's why i have millions of people
[44:50] on the face of the earth their union
[44:52] they're tied to the belief of their
[44:53] denomination
[44:54] and then over here say i believe in
[44:56] christ but really you're married to the
[44:57] systems and the beliefs of that
[44:58] denomination
[45:00] you can't paul says you can't carry on a
[45:02] relationship
[45:03] like that one has to be dead
[45:07] and then he says you can't have a
[45:10] denominational affair now that's not
[45:12] being married that's just an affair
[45:14] an affair is when you're married and
[45:16] you're having an affair with someone
[45:18] else and your husband don't know about
[45:19] it
[45:21] everybody okay with me being plain
[45:25] this is a unique service this morning
[45:27] but he says in the scripture the union
[45:29] with christ is an exclusive union and we
[45:32] don't share a love
[45:33] with uh or another union with someone
[45:37] else
[45:38] we can speak of these things an affair
[45:41] he said you can't carry on a
[45:43] denominational affair
[45:45] or a flirting with denominational
[45:47] systems
[45:48] and embrace jesus christ he wants an
[45:51] exclusive
[45:52] relationship now last week there was a
[45:56] reason i went back to hosea
[45:58] i discovered that this prophet to israel
[46:01] or ephraim they're referred to
[46:02] in hosea and unfortunately today i will
[46:05] not be able to read
[46:06] all the scriptures i wanted to read
[46:08] through there but you will find in the
[46:10] book of hosea as you read it
[46:12] it's referred to as ephraim who is
[46:15] israel and he spoke quite a bit on this
[46:18] subject of
[46:19] adulterousness in fact god
[46:22] in fact god had hosea
[46:26] mary a woman who would become an
[46:29] adulteress
[46:30] now the theologians argue over this
[46:33] they many of them like to say god had
[46:36] the prophet
[46:36] mary uh a prostitute
[46:40] there's discussions over that and i like
[46:42] to lean towards it because we don't know
[46:44] the first
[46:45] but god knew that she wouldn't be
[46:47] faithful is what it was
[46:48] and so he in hosea 1 says i want
[46:52] you to marry this woman who will not be
[46:55] faithful to you and that's what she did
[46:57] he married her and jose is probably
[47:00] saying
[47:01] god are you sure what are you doing this
[47:02] for i want you to marry this woman
[47:04] she will be gone but become an
[47:06] adulteress and but i'm doing it because
[47:09] i
[47:09] need to do i need to display a sign to
[47:12] all of israel that this is how i
[47:14] feel that you have become adulterous to
[47:16] me and i want you to be exclusive to me
[47:19] i want to be your husband i want you to
[47:20] be my wife so he has hosea marry this
[47:23] woman
[47:23] sure enough she turns out she starts to
[47:26] be in affairs with other men
[47:28] and it's all lived out in his life so
[47:31] that he can
[47:32] experience what the feeling is naturally
[47:35] express it to the people what it feels
[47:37] like when a wife
[47:38] is unfaithful share it with israel and
[47:41] say
[47:41] this israel is how i feel
[47:46] when you commit adultery on me and you
[47:48] give your heart to other idols
[47:51] and worship other ones besides me this
[47:53] is how i feel
[47:57] and so hosea chapter 1 and you can read
[48:00] all this i don't have time to as i said
[48:02] to go through all the scriptures today
[48:03] but you watch israel israel she's taken
[48:06] with adult
[48:07] uh adultery idols and that's why he
[48:10] calls her an adulteress
[48:12] in verse chapter five or verse three he
[48:14] says she's hiding
[48:15] you know i just want to let you know
[48:16] there's nothing you can hide from your
[48:19] lord in chapter 6 verse 10
[48:23] god's grieved about it grieve by it
[48:26] remember this is what hosea
[48:27] his wife told him he felt it israel seen
[48:31] it
[48:31] and he they even watched it in the
[48:33] prophet as hosea suffered through
[48:35] the reality of a woman being unfaithful
[48:38] to her husband
[48:40] israel watched it in hosea's life
[48:44] and finally caught it that this is what
[48:46] she was doing to the lord
[48:53] in chapter 7 verse 8 says that israel
[48:56] was
[48:58] mixed with the other people not
[49:00] separating from the worldly people
[49:01] mingling
[49:02] like a cake only finished on one side he
[49:05] said
[49:06] cake not finished on one side is useless
[49:08] you kind of throw it away
[49:09] in other words it's halfway it's only
[49:11] cooked on one side i'm going to go
[49:13] through these quickly but
[49:14] he says you're like a cake that's only
[49:15] cooked on one side in other words
[49:18] you're halfway with me you're not fully
[49:21] with me
[49:22] in chapter eight verse nine he said hi
[49:24] you have hired lovers
[49:27] this woman referring to israel ephraim
[49:31] you've hired other lovers
[49:37] amen
[49:41] and you paid for that bad movie on your
[49:43] phone
[49:49] i love you you paid for that bad movie
[49:54] on your phone
[49:56] you hired it
[50:00] you paid for that script subscription
[50:02] that only has dirty movies
[50:14] chapter 12 verse 8 speaks about her
[50:16] money and she's caught up in her
[50:18] possessions
[50:19] but god says your money has led you away
[50:20] as well i think of our lives
[50:23] you know what i'm thinking of hosea
[50:25] mentions all these
[50:26] characteristics of ephraim
[50:30] and i thought of my own life and i think
[50:32] of our lives
[50:33] the numerous things that take us away
[50:38] from our intimacy with jesus christ
[50:42] the entertainments the busyness the
[50:45] world
[50:46] we're attracted to other things just
[50:49] distractions
[50:51] from our relationship one preacher
[50:54] referred to it as
[50:55] satan's weapons of mass distraction
[51:00] we live in the age of distractions
[51:01] distractions from what
[51:03] from our relationship with jesus christ
[51:05] on a daily basis
[51:08] we're the culture of distractions and

[53:46] my family members sometimes and i'm
[53:49] going
[53:49] you don't need to know every second
[53:52] what's going on in people's lives
[53:55] young people you you don't need to know
[53:58] all that
[53:59] if your walk with this christ
[54:03] is suffering and you feel empty and you
[54:06] feel
[54:06] away from him and you feel i'm not as
[54:09] close to the lord as i need to be
[54:12] that is not as important as your
[54:14] relationship with the lord
[54:18] what your friend did in louisiana or
[54:21] arizona what they're doing
[54:23] next what they their new outfit they got
[54:26] is not as important
[54:30] if it takes you away from this
[54:32] relationship
[54:34] because this is a relationship this is
[54:36] not a dress code
[54:38] this is not a social gathering
[54:44] stood here for 33 years
[54:47] and this is about my relationship with
[54:49] christ and your relationship with christ
[54:51] that's why we preach and that's why we
[54:53] preach the message of the last days
[55:01] i didn't expect to ask that but ask
[55:03] yourself how much this week how much
[55:05] time
[55:06] was spent just with the lord
[55:12] because he loves us he wants to allure
[55:15] us into the wilderness you know what he
[55:17] has to say come away little bride
[55:19] rise up come away little bride i think
[55:22] that word come away
[55:24] and i'm alluring you out to the
[55:25] wilderness i think that means more for
[55:28] today in our
[55:29] materialistic social media our minds are
[55:33] taken
[55:33] our time is taken i think those fit
[55:36] where he's standing saying
[55:39] come away
[55:43] leave the phone leave the phone put it
[55:46] in a safe and lock it up for two hours
[55:49] no come away and so when you when he
[55:51] says come away you get up start walking
[55:53] towards them with your phone
[55:56] oh yeah you do like with my kids i i
[56:00] need to have serious talk with you i
[56:01] need to talk
[56:02] and then bring in their phones leave the
[56:04] phone in the bedroom
[56:06] because it's i'm checking your
[56:09] scriptures dad no no you're not checking
[56:11] the scriptures i'm here
[56:15] no no gay says come away
[56:18] my love come away brother donnie wrote
[56:20] that song and you're bringing your phone
[56:22] he says no no
[56:23] can you leave your phone
[56:26] can you tell everybody just to leave you
[56:28] alone for a while and just give you some
[56:29] time
[56:30] just i need to speak to the lord a while
[56:32] he said come on come away to the windows
[56:33] i think in the culture we live in the
[56:35] lord is saying it more than ever
[56:37] but he's not going to come out and grab
[56:39] you and push you
[56:40] and say come away jaden now
[56:44] get up here i want time with you alone
[56:47] come on
[56:52] now let's fellowship

[57:06] god doesn't work that way it's just that
[57:08] still small voice saying

[57:25] post
[57:27] whatever you want to do but i'm just
[57:29] calling you away from it all
[57:30] it's not as important as you think
[57:34] trust me people i'm preaching to myself
[57:35] more more than you
[57:37] i want a closer relationship with my
[57:41] lord
[57:43] if can we agree on that this morning you
[57:45] may not some like some of the things i
[57:46] say
[57:47] but can we agree on that do we have the
[57:48] same heart how bad do we want it
[57:51] how close do we want to be with him i
[57:54] want a closer relationship with my lord
[57:57] that i can walk
[57:58] and talk with him and he can and speak
[58:00] with me because when this all is done
[58:03] our possessions will be gone we'll lose
[58:05] him we'll go through seasons we'll go
[58:06] through seasons where
[58:07] where we'll we'll have some a lot of
[58:09] funds but i guarantee you you're going
[58:11] to go through scenes where you won't
[58:12] have it again
[58:14] come on say amen you don't trust in
[58:15] those riches uncertain riches
[58:18] my son-in-law was asking if becca would
[58:21] buy some
[58:23] fireworks tonight and and he gave the
[58:25] amount she says yeah i can get it he
[58:27] said well let's just
[58:28] wait till next year we'll give him my
[58:29] wife said i may not have the money next
[58:31] year
[58:33] i said that's true we go through seasons
[58:34] of life we go through seasons of trouble
[58:36] with our marriage
[58:37] we go through seasons of trouble with
[58:39] our family that's the way a life
[58:40] is can you say amen and so now
[58:44] god calls us to a relationship that
[58:47] whatever season we're going through
[58:49] our fellowship with him can remain
[58:52] intact
[58:54] our joy can remain intact
[58:58] because he's faithful he's not up and
[59:00] down like a roller coaster
[59:02] like we are sometimes he's there he's
[59:05] faithful
[59:06] and he loves us can you say amen
[59:10] he allures her away and says come away
[59:13] my love come away
[59:15] oh praise the lord turn to hosea and i'm
[59:19] going to find a place to end here
[59:27] hosea

[59:34] no no no no go back so in our text in
[59:38] chapter two it's god speaking i'm gonna
[59:40] lure her
[59:41] but then in chapter three is when hosea
[59:43] himself
[59:44] goes to buy back his wife who's went
[59:47] into idolatry or excuse me
[59:48] harlow tree chapter three and verse one
[59:51] can you give me a few more minutes
[59:54] i mean the the fireworks aren't until 10
[59:56] o'clock tonight
[59:57] so i got a lot of time here and really
[1:00:00] the fireworks are going on right in here
[1:00:02] right now
[1:00:05] praise the lord can't get any better
[1:00:06] than this and i'm not talking about me
[1:00:08] but just to sit in the presence of the
[1:00:10] lord and hear from him
[1:00:11] you can't get any better than this this
[1:00:14] beats any fireworks
[1:00:16] i know some of your kids are falling
[1:00:17] asleep i understand that and
[1:00:19] some of you are falling asleep i
[1:00:20] understand that sometimes
[1:00:24] but hosea chapter 3 is when when he goes
[1:00:26] and buys her
[1:00:27] then said the lord to me go yet love a
[1:00:29] woman beloved of her friend
[1:00:30] yet an adulteress according to the love
[1:00:33] of the lord toward the children of
[1:00:34] israel who look to other gods and love
[1:00:36] flagons of wine pints and different
[1:00:38] things of wine and that's where she got
[1:00:40] so i
[1:00:41] bought her for me for 15 pieces of
[1:00:43] silver so he goes and gets his wife
[1:00:45] and he buys her back he pays the price
[1:00:47] who's this speaking of
[1:00:48] the lord jesus christ when you got away
[1:00:52] from god was alienated from him
[1:00:54] he went and paid the price at calvary
[1:00:58] judas sowed him for 30 pieces of silver
[1:01:00] hosea buys her for 15 pieces of silver
[1:01:03] that's double god paid double can you
[1:01:04] say man for you
[1:01:07] so i bought her for me for 15 pieces of
[1:01:09] silver and for a home or a barley and a
[1:01:11] half omaha barley and i said unto her
[1:01:13] say listen now she's in a dollar tree
[1:01:16] she feels condemned she said
[1:01:18] but he says i'm going and he goes and
[1:01:19] finds this woman that he married
[1:01:21] and he says what's the price i'm going
[1:01:24] to buy her back
[1:01:25] because my love for her i want to woo
[1:01:28] her i want to bring her back to myself
[1:01:30] i want her back in fellowship again so
[1:01:32] what price do i need to pay
[1:01:34] to get back in fellowship with her again
[1:01:36] that's the lord jesus in your life
[1:01:38] and aren't your glad friends even when
[1:01:40] you backslide a while
[1:01:41] his love is still saying i already paid
[1:01:44] the price
[1:01:45] for your relationship i paid the
[1:01:48] ultimate price
[1:01:49] to bring you back into fellowship again
[1:01:52] and then he says to her and i said unto
[1:01:54] her
[1:01:55] thou shalt abide for me many days thou
[1:01:58] shalt not play the harlot and thou shalt
[1:02:00] not be for another man
[1:02:02] so will i also be for thee you know what
[1:02:05] he's saying
[1:02:06] i love you so much i paid the price but
[1:02:08] he says you don't have to play the
[1:02:10] harlot anymore
[1:02:10] i don't want you to play the harlot i
[1:02:12] want you to abide with me now forever
[1:02:14] and i thou shall not be for another man
[1:02:18] and i will i also be just for the
[1:02:20] exclusive

[1:02:25] shalt be for thou
[1:02:26] shalt not be for another man so will i
[1:02:29] also be
[1:02:30] for thee that's what hosea said to his
[1:02:31] wife as he buys her back
[1:02:34] i love it and then he goes on to say
[1:02:38] well i was looking for that i love her

[1:08:52] jesus said if you say to this mountain
[1:08:55] and when that power came back
[1:08:56] to sons in the last days he says why

[1:09:01] and he spoke and says let this all go
[1:09:03] away
[1:09:05] in the name of jesus christ and it all
[1:09:07] went away and within minutes the sun was
[1:09:09] shining
[1:09:10] should have been a storm that lasted for
[1:09:12] days
[1:09:15] all went away and as he's walking back

[1:09:29] storm what was more important to god
[1:09:32] i'm going gonna challenge you right now

[1:09:35] the third poll that he spoke to the
[1:09:37] storm oh praise god he spoke to the
[1:09:39] storm
[1:09:39] what a wonderful thing that's what we
[1:09:41] all look for
[1:09:43] but what was more important to god it
[1:09:46] wasn't speaking to the storm he can do
[1:09:47] that
[1:09:48] we heard master of the wind we serve the
[1:09:50] master of the wind we know the master
[1:09:53] god comes around doesn't leave it with
[1:09:55] just speaking to the storm and it goes
[1:09:56] away
[1:09:57] he says will you just walk with me
[1:10:00] in this woods for a while he said i
[1:10:02] would love to walk with you just talk

[1:10:23] jesus i'm sorry
[1:10:27] lord for the things i
[1:10:30] needed all about
[1:10:36] well it's all about
[1:10:39] you jesus quote here
[1:10:44] is before we pray together this last
[1:10:47] quote and god makes it
[1:10:48] making a promise
[1:10:53] the other day down at brother cox's
[1:10:56] brother rem says an old mother dove had
[1:10:58] two little babies
[1:10:59] and they set right up on the top of the
[1:11:00] building so the cats couldn't get them
[1:11:03] and the old mother dove would feed them
[1:11:05] then she'd come down and get them and
[1:11:07] make them get up in the tree and
[1:11:09] they would sit there with their necks
[1:11:10] around one another and coo and make love
[1:11:12] all day long
[1:11:14] two little baby gentle baby doves and i
[1:11:16] thought of how god the dove
[1:11:18] is such a loving bird and the dove of
[1:11:21] god wanting to make love with his human
[1:11:23] beings
[1:11:24] god wants to be loved god wants to love
[1:11:28] you
[1:11:30] god so loved the world he gave his only
[1:11:32] begotten son that whosoever
[1:11:33] believeth in him should not perish but
[1:11:36] to have everlasting life
[1:11:37] blessed be the lord then god wanting to
[1:11:40] make love
[1:11:41] he had to make something lovable he had
[1:11:44] to make something gentle like himself
[1:11:46] he had to make something that could be
[1:11:47] loved he had to make something of his
[1:11:49] own nature
[1:11:50] you couldn't love nothing that wasn't of
[1:11:52] your own nature loving has to unite with
[1:11:54] love
[1:11:55] and a husband and wife have to love one
[1:11:56] another if they ever make the great a
[1:11:58] family
[1:11:59] has to love one another if they're going
[1:12:00] to ever make the great
[1:12:02] something to be loved you search
[1:12:04] everywhere finding a girl to be your
[1:12:06] wife that you love
[1:12:07] she searches finding a husband that she
