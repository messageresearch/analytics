[4:39] Jesus Victory belongs to
[4:42] [Music]
[4:46] H
[4:49] oh the victory belongs to
[4:53] Jesus Victory belongs to Acts chapter 24
[4:58] and uh this might a little lengthy
[5:00] reading but I'll go ahead and read it
[5:01] now uh verse 1-6 after 5 days ananas the
[5:06] high priest he descended with the elders
[5:08] and with a a certain orator named turus
[5:12] I don't know if I'm saying his name
[5:13] right but turus who informed the
[5:16] governor against Paul turus was a a
[5:18] lawyer hired by the priest hired by the
[5:22] Jews to come against Paul and to present
[5:25] the accusations against Paul and what
[5:27] they were saying that he did and they
[5:29] were trying to come against and take
[5:31] Paul out and finish him and they bring
[5:33] him before a Roman here and turus was
[5:36] the uh was the lawyer that they hired
[5:39] verse two and when he was called forth
[5:41] turus be to accuse him saying seeing
[5:44] that by thee we enjoy great quietness
[5:47] and that very worthy Deeds are done unto
[5:49] this nation by thy Providence we accept
[5:52] it always in our all places most noble
[5:55] Felix with all thankfulness so here's a
[5:58] good lawyer who's buttering bring up the
[6:00] judge and uh giv some compliments to him
[6:04] notwithstanding that I be not uh further
[6:07] tedious unto thee I pray thee that thou
[6:09] wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few
[6:12] words for we have found this man Paul a
[6:15] a pestilent fellow uh that's a
[6:18] irritating fellow irritator and a mover
[6:21] of sedition among the Jews throughout
[6:24] the world and a ring leader of a sect of
[6:26] the nazarenes who also hath gone about
[6:29] to profane the temple whom we took and
[6:31] would have judged according to our law
[6:34] but the chief Captain liasis Came Upon
[6:36] Us and with great violence took him away
[6:38] out of our hands commanding his accusers
[6:41] to come unto thee Felix by examining of
[6:44] whom thyself mayest take knowledge of
[6:47] all these things whereof we accuse him
[6:49] and the Jews also ascented saying that
[6:52] these things are true these things were
[6:55] so so everybody's agreeing Paul's
[6:57] standing here they got the lawyer they
[6:59] presented all the accusations and
[7:01] everybody's agreeing yes he's done these
[7:03] things then Paul after that the governor
[7:06] had beckoned unto him to speak answered
[7:08] for as much as I know that thou Hast
[7:10] been of many years the judge under this
[7:12] nation I do the more cheerfully answer
[7:15] for myself because that thou mayest
[7:17] understand that there are yet but 12
[7:19] days since I went up to Jerusalem for to
[7:22] worship and they neither found me in the
[7:24] temple disputing with any man neither
[7:27] raising up the people neither in the
[7:30] synagogues nor in the city neither can
[7:33] they prove the things whereof they now
[7:36] accuse me but this I confess unto thee
[7:39] that after the way which is called
[7:42] heresy so worship I the god of my
[7:44] fathers believing all things which are
[7:46] written in the law and in the prophets
[7:48] and have hope toward God which they
[7:51] themselves also allow that there shall
[7:53] be a resurrection of the Dead both of
[7:56] the just and unjust in other words he's
[7:58] saying it says that in the law as well
[8:00] fellas and I believe all the law but I
[8:02] also believe that there's a resurrection
[8:04] of the Dead both the just and the unjust
[8:06] and herein do I exercise myself to have
[8:10] always a conscience void of offense
[8:15] toward God and toward men I I suppose we
[8:19] could say a conscious or heart free of
[8:22] condemnation is a subject we probably
[8:25] can't say too much about just simply
[8:28] because it's the main theme or the main
[8:30] thrust of the enemy he can bring
[8:33] sickness on you he could do a lot of
[8:35] things try to tear up your family but
[8:37] the main thing he focuses on is to get a
[8:40] Believer to question and have guilt and
[8:42] question and doubt who he is and who she
[8:45] is that's his main focus and if he if he
[8:48] does it to if he did it to Jesus then
[8:51] he'll do it to you how many knows he did
[8:53] it to Jesus he was the one that was
[8:56] trying to make Jesus question question
[8:58] whether he was the son of God imagine
[9:00] the arrogancy and the pride of this fell
[9:02] coming before Jesus the anointed Son of
[9:04] God and tempting him when he was hungry
[9:06] in the wilderness and making him bring
[9:09] up the question and say if thou be the
[9:12] Son of God he's bringing up that
[9:14] question in order to cause him to doubt
[9:17] and we know how Jesus responded there he
[9:20] come he come against the wrong person
[9:22] there because this is a man brother
[9:23] Braham said he had perfect Faith because
[9:25] he knew his place in the scripture can
[9:28] you say amen he knew where he stood he
[9:30] knew what he was there for there was no
[9:32] and when you know where you stand when
[9:34] you know you have confidence when you
[9:37] have no guilt no shame can you say Amen
[9:40] then you can stand against any devil and
[9:42] the devil can't penetrate himself to you
[9:45] and that's how Jesus was that's how we
[9:47] want to be is to have that kind of
[9:49] confidence and so it's him that comes
[9:51] and questions who we are it's him that
[9:54] brings the condemnation he's the author
[9:57] of lies he's the author of condemnation
[9:59] and this is the realm more than any
[10:02] other attack against the enemy and the
[10:04] bride in this age and against you more
[10:06] than any other thing is to bring
[10:08] condemnation and guilt and make you
[10:11] question and doubt the word and doubt
[10:13] who you
[10:14] are a lot of times I might say it a lot
[10:17] of times people are overwhelmed with all
[10:19] their pressures of Life they get alone
[10:21] too much they get overwhelmed with all
[10:23] the pressures of life and that's when
[10:25] the devil really hits them when they get
[10:27] alone and they have so many hits at the
[10:29] same time they can't just can't seem to
[10:31] process at all and then the devil brings
[10:33] up this thing well maybe I don't believe
[10:36] or maybe I'm not a Christian or
[10:37] something like that we got to know where
[10:39] we stand and as I said I don't think you
[10:41] can talk about a Christian being free of
[10:44] condemnation I don't think you can talk
[10:46] about it enough I believe we need
[10:48] victory in this I believe we need to
[10:50] walk in it every day because you're
[10:52] going to face an enemy that's going to
[10:54] come back at you again and again to try
[10:57] to bring guilt he he he the number one
[11:00] professional uh person to put a guilt
[11:03] trip on a Believer I know you got people
[11:06] you're thinking of probably right now
[11:07] that are Guilt Trip people can put a
[11:09] guilt trip on you you might be it might
[11:11] be the person next to you I don't know
[11:13] but people can put a guilt trip on you
[11:15] but there's nobody as professional at it
[11:18] as the enemy that's right and as I said
[11:21] Sunday he tries to put guilt on you even
[11:24] when you haven't done anything wrong
[11:26] that's pretty wicked can you say amen
[11:28] that's pretty sad so this is why we have
[11:30] to know where we stand so when when the
[11:32] deepest let me just say it this way when
[11:34] the deepest inner parts of us which is
[11:37] first of all your soul and then your
[11:40] heart what we spoke about Sunday which
[11:42] is the seed of your emotions we could
[11:44] say the conscience or the subconscious
[11:46] when you have when the the deepest inner
[11:49] parts of us the soul and the Heart Is
[11:52] emptied of all guilt and shame then I
[11:56] believe there stands a Christian at his
[11:59] very best I see Paul in that scripture a
[12:01] Christian at his very best he said I
[12:04] live and exercise a life that there's no
[12:07] offense there's no guilt before God
[12:10] there's no there's no shame and before
[12:12] men I won't let any man shame me I won't
[12:15] let any man falsely accuse me and he
[12:18] stood the very best now a lot of us
[12:20] would say the best of a Christian was is
[12:22] that he has Miracles and signs and
[12:24] wonders in the faith of Pentecost acting
[12:27] and doing these Mighty works and I
[12:28] believe believe that with all my heart I
[12:30] believe Jesus said the works that I do
[12:33] shall you do also the church will
[12:35] continue the works of Jesus
[12:37] Christ but how do we get to the faith to
[12:40] bring forth those works I guarantee you
[12:43] won't get to it with guilt on your heart
[12:44] I guarantee you won't get on a heart
[12:46] that's got all kinds of guilt and shame
[12:48] and condemnation you can't get to that
[12:50] kind of Faith so somehow the atonement
[12:53] washed all the guilt from the people in
[12:55] the upper room they were emptied out of
[12:57] everything all the guilt was gone all
[13:00] the shame was gone and now the faith
[13:02] kicks in to be like the Son of
[13:05] God that's why I'm preaching about this
[13:07] because we have to deal with this first
[13:10] before we come to the faith of the
[13:11] apostolic faith praise the Lord so I
[13:14] believe that's when a Christian that's
[13:16] when a Christian is at his very best you
[13:19] say where he's at his best when he's
[13:20] exercising all these Miracles he's at
[13:23] his best when he's standing there a Son
[13:24] of God free in his heart free in his
[13:27] mind free in his spirit I'm going to
[13:29] show you some places that this is echoed
[13:31] throughout the scripture and throughout
[13:32] the message especially throughout the
[13:34] message so this is a Christian at his
[13:36] very best and there's not much the devil
[13:39] can do when a Christian stands in that
[13:41] place there's he he can't penetrate this
[13:45] type of guilt-free this this type of
[13:47] lack of Shame there's no Shadows of
[13:50] doubt I know I who I am everything is
[13:54] under the blood of Jesus Christ he's
[13:57] pardoned me and I've accepted his pardon
[14:00] everything is under the blood there's
[14:02] nothing between people I've forgiven
[14:04] people and I'm standing here ready to be
[14:07] used by the
[14:08] Lord there's a vessel the devil's afraid
[14:11] of there's a vessel that the devil's
[14:14] going how how in the world am I going to
[14:16] get this guy
[14:19] down that's the very that's the
[14:20] Christian at his very best I'd say a
[14:22] Christian at his best is when the devil
[14:25] can't get anywhere with him
[14:29] and he says it in greatest battle ever
[14:31] fought he says when God can get a man in
[14:34] his hands till he can get his senses
[14:38] conscience everything cleaned out until
[14:40] it stands with God behind it in the
[14:44] spirit there's not a devil in the world
[14:46] can poke a doubt in there now that seems
[14:49] unrealistic in this uh unbelieving age
[14:52] that we live in no Christian can live
[14:54] that close to God that's what Society
[14:56] tells you that's what the church can
[14:57] tell you nobody can live like the
[14:59] apostles but the word of God says we are
[15:02] to carry on the work of the Apostles and
[15:05] if he says a man can live that close to
[15:07] God with conscience cleaned out senses
[15:10] cleaned out till he stands with God
[15:13] behind it and the devil there's no devil
[15:16] that can poke a doubt in there I don't
[15:18] care how many unbelieving say Devils say
[15:21] that's not possible it's possible that I
[15:23] can live that there's no place for the
[15:27] devil to poke a doubt in
[15:30] you know us Believers we can reach for
[15:32] the
[15:33] stars because that's what God told
[15:35] Abraham his seed
[15:37] [Applause]
[15:38] was come on now your seed will be as the
[15:42] stars of Heaven first he says it'll be
[15:46] like the the
[15:48] sand but he says then it's going to go
[15:50] from dust to Stars you can reach for the
[15:53] stars and these these promises of the
[15:55] word because why you're the Stars you're
[15:57] Abraham's seed
[15:59] Hallelujah not movie stars Lord have
[16:01] mercy I don't want to be a movie star
[16:03] there's some of the most vile people
[16:04] some of the singers some of the most
[16:05] vile people on the face of the Earth you
[16:08] don't want to be like
[16:10] them spirits of Lucifer and spirits of
[16:13] all kinds of things that raise up stars
[16:15] and Divas like that we follow after them
[16:18] I tell you there's Sons and Daughters of
[16:20] God that are stars of God Abraham seed
[16:23] that's who I want to be that's the
[16:25] humble person I want to be in this face
[16:27] face of this Earth he go goes on to see
[16:29] it's your mind later in the quote he
[16:31] says it's your mind that opens up the
[16:33] door or closes the door and listens to
[16:36] your conscience listens to your memory
[16:38] listens to your affections but when your
[16:40] mind closes itself to these things and
[16:43] let God the spirit of his word come in
[16:46] it blows the rest of the stuff out every
[16:49] doubt is gone every fear is gone every
[16:51] sensation of Doubt is gone every feeling
[16:54] is gone there's nothing standing there
[16:56] but the word of God and Satan cannot
[16:59] battle against that no sir he cannot
[17:02] battle against it praise be to God now
[17:07] you're talking a Christian at his best
[17:09] state and the devil don't know how to
[17:11] mess with
[17:12] him it's wonderful so I love what Paul
[17:15] says here that he says I I stand with a
[17:19] conscience exercise myself you know when
[17:22] you use the word exercise you know what
[17:24] all of us Americans think of I make you
[17:27] think of the big gym and we think of
[17:29] exercis and we think of working out and
[17:31] we think if if you do that great uh it's
[17:34] a wonderful thing but we think of EX and
[17:37] we exercise us ourselves more in mental
[17:42] exercises and physical exercises we
[17:45] Americans tend to do that more than we
[17:47] do exercise ourself as the scripture
[17:50] says unto
[17:52] godliness but look at this one I ex this
[17:55] is a life of a Christian I exercise my
[17:59] self to have
[18:02] always a
[18:04] conscious void empty of offense toward
[18:07] God or toward
[18:09] men he says that's the way I've chosen
[18:11] to live I'm going to live that way I'm
[18:13] going to live without guilt there's
[18:15] going to be no offenses if there's
[18:17] something wrong I'm going to make it
[18:18] right right away and even people's
[18:20] accusations of me I will not let Lodge
[18:24] in my
[18:25] conscience God did I do it God forgive
[18:29] me did I hurt someone else go ask them
[18:31] for forgiveness it's done Washed by the
[18:34] blood of the lamb and I go the next
[18:36] moment clean by my
[18:39] Lord this is a lifestyle Paul lived I
[18:41] believe he was living his very best that
[18:44] he could say I could exercise to be free
[18:46] of guilt unmoved by any doubts about
[18:49] being accepted with God settled and also
[18:51] void of offense of men void of offense
[18:54] means this a conscience void of offense
[18:57] is a Guiltless conscience ience to be
[19:00] Guiltless means that all wrongdoings
[19:02] which were condemned by the conscience
[19:04] have been dealt with before God and have
[19:07] been forgiven by him I'm going to read
[19:09] that again it means to be guildless
[19:11] means that all wrongdoings which were
[19:13] condemned by the conscience now notice
[19:15] notice the devil if we make a mistakes
[19:18] our conscience is going to condemn us of
[19:21] course and we're going to feel
[19:22] conviction as well from the Lord
[19:24] conviction is a good thing but when
[19:26] conscience lingers and on when you've
[19:28] been forgiven then you've got to deal
[19:30] with the conscience say I've got to let
[19:32] God I got to take God's forgiveness here
[19:34] I've got to relieve my conscience so
[19:36] when we're condemned by our conscience
[19:38] that has the the wrongdoings have been
[19:40] dealt with before God they've been dealt
[19:44] with they're not lingering for years
[19:47] they're not hanging on you they have
[19:50] been dealt with before God and have been
[19:52] forgiven by God and what I've been
[19:55] preaching on lately it's not just God
[19:57] forgives us but it's us forgiving
[20:00] others it's dealt with deal with it deal
[20:04] with that all against a brother or
[20:05] sister deal with that unforgiving Spirit
[20:09] you got to you got to face it right and
[20:13] then he says hence there is no this is
[20:15] another writer or just the meaning of
[20:17] this a biblical meaning hence there is
[20:19] no more feeling my this is powerful this
[20:24] what this is what a conscious void of
[20:25] offense means there is no more feeling
[20:29] of guilt and condemnation resident in
[20:33] the
[20:34] conscience not that it's there not even
[20:37] a feeling would be left there of guilt
[20:40] why because we're supposed to live
[20:42] guilt-free that's right we're supposed
[20:45] to live guilt
[20:47] free so you got to realize in this
[20:50] incident with Paul there's false
[20:51] accusations and lies being told towards
[20:54] him in front of the whole uh the whole
[20:56] congregation there and all thew Jews
[20:58] that were accusing him and all the the
[21:00] high priest and Priests there wasn't any
[21:02] truth to what they were saying and they
[21:05] handed it off to a lawyer and he
[21:07] polished it up a bit like lawyers do and
[21:09] he made it sound real good to Felix and
[21:12] he presented this thing and he laid out
[21:14] about four or five things that Paul had
[21:17] done supposedly done and uh so you see
[21:20] now there's one thing to deal deal with
[21:22] what you've done wrong it's another
[21:24] thing to deal with guilt being put on
[21:26] you of what you have not done or things
[21:29] you have maybe been forgiven of already
[21:32] and Satan's bringing it back in this
[21:34] incident he hadn't done any of that
[21:37] right this was the enemy's lies against
[21:39] him now friends I'm emphasizing more
[21:42] that part because we should know by now
[21:44] if we make a mistake we bring it for for
[21:48] the Lord as I said Sunday brother Bri
[21:50] said I want to live such a sensitive
[21:52] life to the holy spirit that the least
[21:54] bit of grieving if I've grieved his
[21:56] spirit and if we're sensitive to the
[21:58] Lord we should know when we grieved his
[22:01] Spirit but I want to be sensitive that
[22:03] the least of the grieve I just feel like
[22:05] I grieved you Lord forgive me you go
[22:07] back through what did I say through the
[22:08] day what did I do Lord and you're
[22:10] quickly dealing with that so that's the
[22:11] realm we should be living in but there's
[22:13] a deeper thing there's a there's a
[22:15] deeper thing here of the accuser of the
[22:18] Brethren and other people being used of
[22:21] the accuser of their Brethren to make
[22:23] you feel guilty about stuff you didn't
[22:26] do
[22:29] a lot of us don't think we have to deal
[22:30] with that guil we we just deal with it
[22:32] we take it and mle over it for weeks and
[22:34] weeks and weeks somebody's put a guilt
[22:37] trip on us and we don't go through the
[22:39] process sitting out and say did I do
[22:41] that I didn't do that I didn't do that
[22:43] you just go through it say God you just
[22:44] relieve yourself God I didn't do that so
[22:46] now you come to conclusion many times
[22:49] something's been said as an accusation
[22:50] against me so what am I going to do with
[22:53] that you better do something with it
[22:54] because lies have a power over your
[22:57] spirit if you believe it if you if you
[23:01] let it Lodge in your mind if you let it
[23:03] Nest you know it hurts when somebody
[23:05] says something a lie against us none of
[23:08] us like that you shouldn't say them
[23:09] against other people unless you know
[23:11] your
[23:12] facts just shut your mouth don't care
[23:15] don't pass something on that you've
[23:17] heard just shut your mouth so if you
[23:19] don't like to get it then you shouldn't
[23:20] give it out but when you receive it it
[23:22] hurts so the hurt sometimes because it
[23:25] affects us and it hurts us and then it
[23:27] makes us a bit angry we Lodge it and we
[23:29] let it sit there and it's a lie lie has
[23:33] a power over somebody to bring them
[23:36] under a delusion and I'm thinking of
[23:38] first Thessalonians they'll believe a
[23:40] lie and be damned by it because they
[23:42] believed a lie God will send them strong
[23:46] delusion and under the delusion that's
[23:49] how they can believe a lie because they
[23:51] become numb to
[23:53] truth and a lie cast a a cloud and a
[23:57] shadow on somebody but lies can have
[24:00] power over
[24:01] us that actually some people begin to
[24:04] believe it I heard a really neat quote
[24:06] today where he said there's just three
[24:09] votes God voted for
[24:11] you Satan voted against you this
[24:14] election season by the
[24:15] way there's only three votes God voted
[24:18] for you he's already voted for you did
[24:20] you know that you already have God's
[24:23] vote man that ought to make us feel good
[24:25] but Satan's vote is against you and what
[24:29] what uh what takes the tying vote over
[24:32] is that he said what's your
[24:35] vote because when you vote for what God
[24:37] says about you when you vote for
[24:40] yourself it's a
[24:41] win can you say Amen but when you start
[24:44] listening to what the devil tells about
[24:46] you that's your vote you're going to
[24:48] lose but if you vote with God that's it
[24:50] two against one it's over you won
[24:53] Hallelujah he's the lawyer against you
[24:55] he's the accuser of the Brethren and
[24:57] Paul stood before every one of these
[25:00] people just as calm cool and collected
[25:04] unmoved by what was being said he said I
[25:07] live all the time with both my soul and
[25:10] my heart free of condemnation and this
[25:14] situation isn't any different than the
[25:16] way that I live every day how many you
[25:17] know when sons of God live that way then
[25:20] no pressure that comes from the
[25:21] government changes them Daniel had a
[25:24] process of praying three times a day
[25:26] opening up the window he had a habit he
[25:28] had a routine can you say Amen then the
[25:31] laws
[25:32] changed but the laws didn't change his
[25:35] consistency to
[25:37] God I don't change for no pressure from
[25:40] some law and government I don't change
[25:42] because somebody's trying to accuse me
[25:44] to worship other God there's only one
[25:46] God I worship I do it three times a day
[25:49] I'm going to keep doing it when Daniel
[25:51] had heard the law was passed he threw
[25:54] the windows open and worshiped as he did
[25:56] the day before
[25:58] there ain't no law that changes our
[26:00] relationship with God there ain't no law
[26:03] that changes our identity in Jesus
[26:05] Christ we know who we are Paul said my
[26:08] soul and my heart are free of
[26:10] condemnation I don't allow condemnation
[26:12] in my life and if it comes it's not
[26:15] allowed to go very long so I stand
[26:17] before you confident I didn't do any of
[26:20] the things that you said that I just did
[26:23] with boundaries
[26:25] strong I would call Paul a Christian at
[26:29] his very best and so Christians beat
[26:32] themselves up when they set boundaries
[26:34] for people not to abuse them because
[26:37] we're taught to give give always give be
[26:39] Christlike give give and we are to do
[26:41] that there's supposed to be something
[26:42] outflowing from us all the
[26:44] time but we don't do it in the name of
[26:48] somebody crossing the line back on us
[26:51] and our boundaries there are spiritual
[26:54] boundaries there are spiritual
[26:57] limits you you know uh in counseling
[26:59] sometimes if I go a long long time and
[27:02] people aren't listening to what you say
[27:04] and they're draining your energy after a
[27:07] while you got to set some B say I've
[27:09] given you this to go it's up to you now
[27:13] but you're not going to drain my time
[27:15] till alls of the night for weeks and
[27:16] weeks you're not going to do that
[27:17] because I don't see any change in your
[27:20] life you see so we have to have
[27:23] boundaries but and that's a whole
[27:24] different subject but to the enemy he's
[27:27] trying to cross your boundaries all the
[27:30] time he's going to try to take your joy
[27:33] he's going to try to get in your
[27:35] conscience he's going to step over in
[27:38] over the line and say I I wonder if I
[27:40] can get in here and I'll listen to a
[27:42] little bit of this music and so he gets
[27:44] a place in your life cuz you give him a
[27:46] place but the boundaries are no that
[27:49] stuff's out there this is my god-given
[27:51] rights and boundaries to keep my joy and
[27:54] you say it say say Satan you forgot but
[27:57] this is the line this is all the further
[28:00] you get to talk to me this is all the
[28:02] further you get to go I'm a Christian
[28:05] I'm a believer I'm a Son of God and this
[28:07] is my rights to stand right here thank
