[0:00] Hello everyone. Pastor Paula Fontaine

[3:08] enmy tries to lie to
[3:12] me, I will believe the truth you've

[4:13] [Music]
[4:16] [Applause]
[4:17] Jesus, when I look
[4:21] around and everything's
[4:25] crazy, you are still
[4:28] God and that's never
[4:32] changing. In the midst of my
[4:36] fear and my
[4:40] indecision, you are my
[4:43] focus fixed in my vision.
[4:48] And I look
[4:50] around and everything's
[4:54] crazy. You are still
[4:58] God and that's never
[5:01] changing. In the midst of my
[5:05] fears and my
[5:09] indeision, you are
[5:16] still
[5:19] [Applause]
[5:21] [Music]
[5:23] my Jesus.
[5:25] [Music]
[5:30] Jesus and all of my
[5:35] joy in
[5:37] you
[5:39] [Music]
[5:39] [Applause]
[5:41] Jesus.
[5:46] Jesus.
[5:49] Oh Jesus.
[5:52] [Music]
[5:59] Come near to
[6:02] me,
[6:03] closer to
[6:05] me, Jesus.
[6:11] Lord, Matthew 11 and verse two. Now when
[6:15] John had heard in the prison the works
[6:18] of Christ, he sent two of his disciples
[6:21] and said unto him, "Art thou he that
[6:24] should come or do we look for another?"
[6:27] This is a interesting comment from John
[6:29] the Baptist. Uh there wasn't anybody who
[6:32] was stronger to identify that this was
[6:35] the one Messiah. This is the lamb of
[6:37] God. Uh he pointed all the people one
[6:40] day when Jesus showed up. He pointed all
[6:42] the people to it. So he's very strong.
[6:44] Besides, he has a commission from the
[6:46] scripture to introduce the Messiah. So,
[6:48] this is kind of a strange comment, but
[6:51] uh I like when the scripture gives our
[6:53] humanness as well because he's sitting
[6:55] there probably maybe getting a lot of
[6:57] questions and the time and he gets a
[7:00] little bit overwhelmed by some thoughts
[7:02] of doubt. So, he sends word ask him if
[7:04] he's the
[7:05] one. Amen. So then Jesus answered and
[7:08] said unto them, "Go and show John again
[7:11] those again those things which you do
[7:13] hear and see. The blind receive their
[7:15] sight, the lame walk, the lepers are
[7:17] cleansed, and the deaf hear the dead are
[7:20] raised up, and the poor have the gospel
[7:23] preached to them." And then he adds
[7:25] this, "And blessed is he whosoever shall
[7:28] not be offended in me."
[7:30] So, it's it's not just seeing all the
[7:32] the power of God and seeing the
[7:35] identification. John, look at this
[7:37] again. The kingdom of God is certainly
[7:39] coming here. Here's the evidence. Go
[7:41] back and tell him this. But also,
[7:43] there's this other strange uh forgotten
[7:45] parable that he places here. Says,
[7:47] "Blessed is he who is not offended.
[7:49] Blessed is he who is not uh in other
[7:52] words, afraid of or offended at what's
[7:55] happening here, but they actually are
[7:57] going to receive it. Amen. There's going
[7:59] to be ones that's going to receive this.
[8:01] This is the kingdom of God. And and so I
[8:04] think that's an important point. We'll
[8:05] get back to that in a minute. And as
[8:06] they departed, Jesus began to say unto
[8:09] the multitudes concerning John, "What
[8:10] went you out to in the wilderness to see
[8:13] a reed shaken with the wind? But what
[8:16] went ye out to see? A man clothed in
[8:18] soft raignment? Behold that they that
[8:20] wear soft clothing are in king's houses.
[8:22] But what went ye out to see? A prophet?
[8:24] Yay, I say unto you, and more than a
[8:26] prophet, for this is he of whom it is
[8:28] written, Behold, I send my messenger
[8:30] before thy face, and which shall prepare
[8:33] thy way before thee. I'll tell you, when
[8:35] we forget who we are, or forget
[8:37] sometimes have doubt. Jesus never
[8:40] forgets who we are and he pointed them
[8:42] back as John has a scriptural
[8:44] identification. That's why he's here.
[8:46] When we forget, God knows our position
[8:48] and reminds you of your position in the
[8:50] scripture. Verily I say unto you, among
[8:53] them that are born of women, there hath
[8:55] not risen a greater than John the
[8:56] Baptist. Notwithstanding, he that is
[8:59] least in the kingdom of heaven is
[9:01] greater than he. And from the days of
[9:03] John the Baptist until now, the kingdom
[9:06] of heaven suffereth violence, and the
[9:09] violent take it by force. I'm going to
[9:11] get into this that he identifies this
[9:13] time as a special time. And when he says
[9:16] the kingdom of heaven is suffering
[9:17] violence, that means that the kingdom of
[9:20] heaven has come to earth and it's
[9:22] suffering violent and the violent take
[9:24] it by force. For all the prophets in the
[9:27] law prophesied until John and if ye will
[9:30] receive this, this is Elias which was
[9:32] was for to come. He that hath ears, let
[9:35] him hear. Excuse me for the lengthy
[9:36] reading, but I want to read all this
[9:38] because I may refer to a lot of these
[9:40] places. But where to shall I liken this
[9:42] generation? It's a very mysterious set
[9:45] of scriptures here. It is like unto
[9:48] children sitting into the markets and
[9:50] calling unto their fellows and
[9:52] saying,"We have piped unto you and ye
[9:54] have not danced. We have mourned unto
[9:57] you and ye have not lamented." So these
[10:00] musicians are these ones sitting in the
[10:02] market saying, "We're if they're if
[10:06] they're piping unto you and expecting a
[10:08] dance, that's what they would do at a
[10:09] wedding, a certain type of music in the
[10:11] Jewish weddings. But the music helps
[10:13] enhance to draw them into the event
[10:15] that's happening. And when they're drawn
[10:17] in, the event that's happening is a
[10:19] wedding. And if you participate, more
[10:21] than likely you'll be dancing. They
[10:24] weren't. They were just sitting. Then a
[10:26] funeral, he says, "We have mourned unto
[10:27] you, played that kind of music, and ye
[10:30] have not lamented." So in other words,
[10:31] you're not catching the event that's
[10:33] going on. This is what this is saying is
[10:35] that there will be pe be people that
[10:37] look at it from the outward and don't
[10:39] participate in what the event actually
[10:41] is happening when it's happening.
[10:43] For John came neither drinking or eating
[10:47] and they say he hath the devil. The son
[10:49] of man cometh eating and drinking and
[10:51] said behold a man is gluttonous and a
[10:53] wine bber a friend of publicans and
[10:56] sinners but wisdom is justified of her
[10:59] children. That's a predestination
[11:01] scripture there. And that is God's
[11:03] children, his own. They will catch
[11:06] what's going on. They will catch what's
[11:08] going on. And they will not only they
[11:10] will not only see it, they will embrace
[11:12] it. They'll take it by force. They'll
[11:14] participate in it. Why? Because they see
[11:17] the kingdom has come to them. I If you
[11:19] don't mind, one other scripture in
[11:20] Matthew
[11:21] 13:44. One small parable. Matthew
[11:26] 13:44. Again, the kingdom of heaven is
[11:28] likened unto a treasure hid in a field,
[11:32] the which when a man hath found, he
[11:35] hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and
[11:38] sellth all that he hath, and buyth that
[11:42] field. The kingdom of God has come to
[11:45] us, and it's a treasure. You have to
[11:48] look at it like a treasure. You have to
[11:50] look at it like it's pre a precious
[11:52] treasure. And when you see it as a
[11:54] treasure, you will seek it with all your
[11:56] heart. You will sell out everything
[11:58] else. There isn't any family or money or
[12:01] retirement or anything in this life that
[12:04] becomes more important than seeking this
[12:06] treasure.
[12:08] That you won't seek it that way unless
[12:11] you see it as God's kingdom and his
[12:13] treasure. When a man catches this is
[12:16] this is uh below the surface of this
[12:19] thing, it's the kingdom of God that's
[12:21] come to us. And when you see that, you
[12:23] see it as a great treasure. Can you say
[12:25] amen? And it becomes the most important
[12:28] thing. When a believer sees that beneath
[12:30] the surface, it's not just another
[12:32] field, but this field has the kingdom of
[12:35] God hidden in it. He aggressively
[12:37] pursues that field. He sells everything
[12:40] and buys that field. Why? It's the
[12:42] kingdom of God. And that's the greatest
[12:45] treasure of any. When people see the
[12:47] message for what it really is, and
[12:48] that's what I brought up last Sunday is
[12:50] that I wonder how many people don't see
[12:52] this message as the kingdom of God
[12:54] coming to us. How many people didn't see
[12:58] what Jesus really was when he was
[13:00] standing in front of them? They they
[13:03] were blinded by it. Could it be? Could
[13:05] it be their doubts of it? And remember,
[13:07] even John had some doubts himself. So,
[13:10] uh, Brother Bam said his eagle eyes got
[13:11] filmed over there for a few days. So
[13:14] doubts are hanging around everywhere.
[13:16] And if you stay in those doubts, they
[13:17] will convince you there's nothing to
[13:19] this. Can you say amen? Even John
[13:22] himself. But see, Jesus had more
[13:24] confidence in John in his position that
[13:26] he would come around because he wasn't
[13:28] called to let his doubts let him leave
[13:30] this message and put it as another
[13:32] pebble on another pebble on the beach.
[13:34] No, he knew that he was an elected seed
[13:36] of God and that he had already
[13:38] identified it and he will identify it
[13:40] again. That confidence is in the
[13:42] predestinated to see to say this is not
[13:46] just a surface movement. He even looked
[13:49] past the miracles and signs and wonders
[13:51] to see this is his kingdom coming to us.
[13:55] That's what I'm presenting is that how
[13:57] many people just still see it on a
[13:59] surface level, but when you see it as
[14:01] his kingdom, it becomes greater than
[14:03] everything in your life. I quoted Tony
[14:06] Evans last week and I just wanted to
[14:07] finish what he said. He said, "A
[14:09] treasure is worth fighting for. A
[14:12] priceless treasure like this one, it's
[14:14] worth fighting for. And men will settle
[14:18] for trinkets and gadgets and golf clubs
[14:21] and video games and careers and cars and
[14:26] vacation packages. And these things are
[14:29] okay. All okay unless they take you off
[14:32] course from pursuing the kingdom."
[14:36] Well said. Can you say amen? And he's
[14:38] directing it towards men. Men are
[14:40] chasing all these things. And men have
[14:42] that ambition. They chase after a goal.
[14:44] I want to make more money. I want to do
[14:45] this. I want to build my retirement. And
[14:47] there's nothing wrong with that
[14:48] ambition. But when it trumps when it
[14:50] trumps the kingdom and you've laid the
[14:53] kingdom aside, something's wrong with
[14:55] that.
[14:57] This has to become the most precious
[14:59] thing in life. And when it is, it'll
[15:01] have priority in your life. This message
[15:04] will have prov priority. Let me be
[15:06] basic. You'll be listening to it. You'll
[15:08] be reading it. You'll be in your Bible
[15:10] because why? Something's hidden in here
[15:12] that you've got to find. And you got to
[15:14] pursue it with all of your heart. I I
[15:17] would pursue it as strong as you pursue
[15:19] money and career and golf clubs
[15:24] and cars and trucks. I can't preach
[15:26] against trucks because I got a truck. I
[15:29] love my truck. But it's never as
[15:31] important as the kingdom. Amen. And if
[15:34] you brothers would uh pursue
[15:37] aggressively the kingdom of God, being
[15:40] in it, being reading it, mining out all
[15:42] the truths of it, don't tell me that
[15:44] you're mainly interested in the kingdom
[15:45] when you won't even go find God's
[15:47] answers when it comes to your finances.
[15:51] You've had enough preachers tell you
[15:52] that the answers to how to run your
[15:54] money is in the Bible. Money is spoken
[15:56] of probably more than any other subject.
[15:58] Money is spoken of. He's got his
[16:00] principles of how son of God handles
[16:02] money. Don't tell me you're interested
[16:03] in the kingdom and you won't even dig to
[16:05] find what he said about it. Don't tell
[16:07] me you want a good marriage and you're
[16:08] not interested in finding in the Bible
[16:10] the kingdom principles of marriage. Can
[16:13] I get an amen? Don't tell me you want
[16:15] things to better be better in your home.
[16:17] And you won't even get into the message
[16:18] or in into the word to find what God
[16:21] said about the home. But when we're
[16:23] interested that this is his kingdom,
[16:25] we're going to pursue it with all of our
[16:27] hearts. And so that's the things men
[16:29] choose. Tony Evans said it. Uh, should I
[16:32] list the women and what they
[16:34] pursue? Well, it's all quiet
[16:37] now. Oh, yeah. They've got their
[16:39] ambitions and their things and competing
[16:42] to be prettier than the next woman.
[16:45] Everything else is more
[16:47] important. Wow, that was quite I stay
[16:50] off of that
[16:51] subject. But listen, the kingdom of God
[16:54] that has come to us must be the goal.
[16:59] And we must sell out to everything to
[17:01] take a hold of it. Can you say amen? We
[17:03] But we won't react that way unless we
[17:05] see it there and we see it as the
[17:07] greatest treasure in life. We won't be
[17:09] serious about church or the message
[17:12] unless we see it as more than that, more
[17:14] than just something that surfaced. We
[17:16] see it. And when we see it, we seize it.
[17:19] That's why I'd like to title this this
[17:20] morning. The ones who seize the kingdom.
[17:23] Actually, he said, "And the violent take
[17:25] it by force." When they know the kingdom
[17:27] is there, they're taking it by force. In
[17:29] a minute, I'll tell you why you have to
[17:31] take it by force. It's not just
[17:32] nonchalantly, okay, it's here. The
[17:34] kingdom is here. Praise the Lord. I'll
[17:36] praise the Lord. The kingdom is here.
[17:37] But we have to take the kingdom by
[17:39] force. We have to be aggressive and take
[17:42] it into our lives. We don't passively
[17:45] just say, "Hope it comes to me." We have
[17:47] to aggressively take a hold of it. And
[17:50] when we know it's a treasure, we will do
[17:51] that. I believe that with all my heart.
[17:53] the saints shall possess the kingdom.
[17:55] And that's why I say there's a
[17:56] difference in receiving it and nodding
[17:58] at it and believing the message. I'm
[18:01] taking it for myself.
[18:04] I'm taking it as my own. I'm possessing
[18:07] it into my life. Can you say amen?
[18:09] Taking it and possessing it, they're
[18:11] actually different. Taking means
[18:12] receiving. Possessing means taking
[18:15] possession. It means to claim it as your
[18:17] own property. Like the man who bought
[18:18] that piece of land, sold everything in.
[18:21] I'm buying that piece of land. Why do
[18:22] you want it? Because you can't see it.
[18:24] There's a treasure. There's a hidden
[18:26] treasure. And so I'm selling out to the
[18:28] rest of it. And I'm buying that piece of
[18:30] land. I want ownership in that land.
[18:33] It's a possession of it. I want to own
[18:35] it. Can you say amen? Glory be to God.
[18:38] So now possessing means take it. To
[18:40] claim it as one's own property, to own
[18:42] it as equality, to obtain power over, to
[18:45] dominate. It's personalized. It's
[18:47] possessing is saying this is mine. This
[18:50] is me. It's a domain that I have
[18:52] co-ownership with and I am exercising. I
[18:56] am exercising that ownership and I'm
[18:58] taking it. The first part is receiving
[19:01] it and then taking it. But you see now
[19:04] the the next part is possessing this
[19:06] kingdom. Taking this kingdom. Can you
[19:08] say amen? This is a setting up of his
[19:10] kingdom on earth on earth. And I am
[19:12] identified with it. I believe it. I
[19:14] receive it. It's from God. He sent
[19:15] Elijah and I receive Elijah. It's the
[19:17] kingdom of his word being set up. and I
[19:19] receive it as just as that the work of
[19:22] God is to believe and receive the
[19:24] servants he sends. Jesus said it
[19:27] Pharisees said, "What do we do to do the
[19:29] works of God?" Jesus said, "This is the
[19:31] work of God that you believe on whom God
[19:33] sends." Receiving it. It's mine. We
[19:37] believe it. We not only believe it, but
[19:39] we take possession of it. We go to this
[19:42] step now that would hit home. Receiving
[19:44] as the kingdom does not mean you have
[19:47] receiving doesn't mean you've possessed
[19:48] it yet. I pray in my congregation it
[19:51] wouldn't be just people that receive
[19:53] this as a kingdom but they possess it.
[19:56] I'm taking it as my own. I'll go to the
[19:58] altar. I'll do what I have to do. I'm
[19:59] going to surrender my life because it's
[20:01] not just church. This is his kingdom.
[20:04] And I'm possessing. I'm going to take a
[20:06] home. If somebody left you a million
[20:08] dollars and you heard you got a left a
[20:10] million dollars, you can call and accept
[20:12] it over the phone. You can believe it's
[20:14] yours. Your name is on it, but you did
[20:17] not go get it yet.
[20:21] Can you say amen?
[20:23] Calling and saying, "I accept my prize.
[20:26] I accept my million dollars." No, but
[20:28] you haven't possessed it yet. I don't
[20:30] want to just call and accept this
[20:32] message and accept this is the kingdom
[20:34] of God. I know I have a part in it and
[20:36] I'm going to go down and collect what's
[20:38] mine. The rights that are mine. I'm
[20:41] going to take it and possess. I want to
[20:43] see that million dollars coming up in my
[20:45] account.
[20:47] Then I've really possessed it. Can you
[20:49] say amen this morning? I don't want to
[20:51] just stand and nod and sit and nod in
[20:53] church and say, "I believe what you're
[20:54] preaching, Brother Paul. I'm preaching
[20:56] it so you'll possess it and take a hold
[20:58] of it yourself. I want to see it in your
[21:00] account." Then you've really possessed
[21:02] it. the rights. You have a right to it.
[21:05] Can you say amen? Somebody gave you a
[21:08] house. You can even hold the deed of it
[21:11] with your name on it, but you don't live
[21:13] in it yet. You don't possess it
[21:17] yet. Possessing is deeper. Esther,
[21:20] there's a mystery under Esther when she
[21:22] becomes moved in your heart to move
[21:24] forward towards the king. That's the
[21:26] bride. Can you say amen? He draws us.
[21:29] But she felt the confidence to come into
[21:31] the courts of the king and to get his
[21:34] attention. The king loved her, but she
[21:36] had to come towards the king. She had to
[21:39] move into his courts. Can you say amen?
[21:42] And she did it by revelation that I'm
[21:43] his I believe I'm his queen and he is my
[21:46] king. And she moves in confidence
[21:49] towards him.
[21:52] Praise the Lord. If you got your Bibles
[21:54] still open to Matthew 11 or if you can
[21:56] pull it up there, I want to just uh
[21:58] comment just a few things here on
[22:00] Matthew 11. Again, these little eagle
[22:02] eyes got filmed over, but Jesus had no
[22:04] doubt about him. It was crystal clear.
[22:06] Jesus not did not waver with John even
[22:09] in his moments of doubt. Aren't you glad
[22:12] God doesn't waver with you even in your
[22:14] moments of doubt? Amen.
[22:17] John the Baptist, the one who was
[22:18] initiating the kingdom of God coming and
[22:21] before the first coming of Christ before
[22:23] before the first advent of Christ, he
[22:26] sends John the Baptist with the spirit
[22:28] of Elijah to introduce that. Pretty
[22:29] important position
[22:31] and he comes and does that. And even
[22:34] that strong word clarification, it was
[22:38] crystal clear. Behold the lamb of God
[22:40] that takes away the sins of the world.
[22:41] Jesus didn't waver with John even in
[22:44] John's moments of doubt. And he says,
[22:46] "Go tell John all you see evidence that
[22:48] something is happening beyond man. The
[22:50] kingdom of God is here." The the the
[22:53] lame leap, the the blind see. Just look.
[22:55] I don't need to explain myself. The
[22:57] evidences show, hey, the kingdom of God
[22:59] is here. But guess what? Not everybody,
[23:01] even through those miracles, is going to
[23:04] acknowledge and take a hold of this.
[23:07] There'll be a host even in Jesus day
[23:10] that they can see it all, but they're
[23:12] not going to take a hold of it. Jesus
[23:13] said, "Look all the look at what's
[23:15] happening." And for those miracles, the
[23:18] blind to see, the lame to walk, ears
[23:21] opened, for all of those things to be
[23:24] happening, the kingdom has come. And you
[23:26] know what's happening? Something has
[23:28] come shaking up demon power. That's
[23:32] right. Because when you have blinded
[23:34] eyes, when you have lame, it's demons.
[23:38] Yes. And they've so taken over. Satan
[23:42] loves to take God's people and just make
[23:44] them sick and make them then there's no
[23:46] hope. I'm going to be this way the rest
[23:49] of my life. Even blind the Barnameus
[23:52] from birth. I'm cursed with this the
[23:54] rest of my life. I don't know why it's
[23:55] happened. I'll be blind forever. Guess
[23:57] what? When the kingdom came, it wasn't
[23:59] forever. Amen. When the kingdom's
[24:01] around, you're not doomed to life. Oh,
[24:04] can I preach this morning and say if the
[24:07] kingdom of Christ is around even this
[24:09] morning, you're not doomed to any
[24:11] condition that the doctor said that you
[24:13] got, including depression,
[24:16] including oppression,
[24:18] it's just demon doubts and demon fears.
[24:21] I don't mean to call you a demon. I
[24:22] understand when somebody has depression,
[24:24] but don't ever accept it as being
[24:27] final. Cuz when the kingdom is present,
[24:30] when it came the first time, it it it it
[24:33] shook up those demons. It says your days
[24:36] are numbered. This depression's going to
[24:38] be over. This blindness is going to be
[24:40] over. If we go to verse 12, Matthew
[24:43] 11:12, and remember that little comment
[24:45] that he makes after those miracles, he
[24:47] says, he says, uh, "Blessed is he who's
[24:51] not offended in me." I want you to hold
[24:53] that because what he's saying is that
[24:57] there will be a group that will be
[25:01] offended and will stumble when his
[25:04] kingdom
[25:06] comes because Satan will put stumbling
[25:09] blocks. But then he says, "Blessed is
[25:11] the person who overcomes those stumbling
[25:14] blocks."
[25:16] They overcome those that offense.
[25:20] Somebody's going to get offended means
[25:21] they're going to stumble over something.
[25:23] But blessed is he who gets over. They
[25:26] see all the miracles and everything. But
[25:28] but you see now the devil's work is not
[25:31] only blindness and sicknesses and all
[25:33] that, but you know what a greater work
[25:35] of the enemy is today? People being
[25:38] stumbled,
[25:41] people being offended.
[25:43] And their offense and their stumbling
[25:46] causes them not to embrace the kingdom.
[25:50] Come on now, say amen. So what's Jesus
[25:53] saying? The the enemy has made these
[25:55] people sick. But also the en enemy is
[25:57] the author of stumbling people that they
[26:00] can't receive this as his kingdom and
[26:03] they can't embrace it. So he's talking
[26:05] about a group that will stumble over
[26:07] that. Blessed is he who's not offended
[26:09] in me. That they're going to overcome
[26:11] that stumbling stone and they're going
[26:13] to say, "No, I see this for what it is."
[26:16] So now if we come now to verse 12, I've
[26:19] got to get moving on here. And the and
[26:20] from the days of John the Baptist until
[26:23] now, the kingdom of heaven suffered
[26:24] violent and the violent take it by
[26:26] force. So he's talking about a
[26:28] transition that's happened. He's he's
[26:30] saying the kingdom has come. There's a
[26:32] change here. And when John began to
[26:35] preach out in the wilderness and he what
[26:38] was he preaching? Repent for the kingdom
[26:40] of God is at hand. Repent for the
[26:43] kingdom of God. He's saying it in front
[26:45] of the people. We're right here. Guess
[26:48] what's coming? The kingdom is coming.
[26:50] How do I need to How do you need to get
[26:51] in there? Repent. But that's a big
[26:54] proclamation. And Jesus is saying it
[26:56] from the day. But look at Jesus now.
[26:58] Greater insight, greater revelation.
[27:01] Since the day that John first started
[27:03] preaching and that voice started to go
[27:06] out into the earth, it be that the the
[27:09] kingdom of heaven is suffering violence.
[27:12] There's going to be an allout attack
[27:14] from the enemy realm against that
[27:17] kingdom. It's going to shake up the
[27:20] other dimension. Everything was normal
[27:23] before everything people Satan had
[27:26] people bound and it had become so
[27:28] normal. They had just accepted it for
[27:30] life and Satan was ruling over all kinds
[27:33] of people's lives in all kinds of area.
[27:35] But when the kingdom came, Satan could
[27:38] tell it's be to shake his kingdom up.
[27:40] Jesus sent the 70 and said, "Go casting
[27:43] out devils." And Jesus after they come
[27:45] back, they were rejoicing. The devils
[27:47] were subject. And Jesus said, "I beheld
[27:50] as Satan falling like lightning from
[27:52] heaven." You know what he's saying? When
[27:54] you when the believers went and prayed
[27:55] and cast out devils, it's shaking up all
[27:58] the kingdom of the demons. And he said,
[28:00] "I beheld Satan falling like lightning."
[28:02] He looked into the other dimension. And
[28:05] when believers have faith and pray,
[28:08] demon powers are shaken up. for watching
