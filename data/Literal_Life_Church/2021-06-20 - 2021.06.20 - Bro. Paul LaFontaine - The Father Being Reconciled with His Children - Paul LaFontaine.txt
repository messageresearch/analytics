TRANSCRIPT
========================================
chapter five we will spend some time in the word and we welcome brother tim mills family his mom his aunt his two children it's good to have you all today god bless you any other visitors i notice the townsends are in today as well god bless you brother sister townsend and all the children we appreciate you being with us and any other visitors god bless you and it's a good day today to be a christian it's a good day to hold to the rock of christ it's good to have your life established upon the rock of god everything else is sinking sand everything else is shifting sand build your life upon the rock and that's one of the reasons why we come to church can you say amen we read from the word and she asked the lord to give us a revelation because a revelation is the rock that we build our lives upon life is not complete without jesus christ amen life is not you can have a lot of good things in life but life is not complete without him so second corinthians chapter 5 and i read this scripture a few weeks ago and we've been on a little series here talking about our participation in creation a lot of people wouldn't think that we participate in the lord's creation of new creatures but we do we participated in our words that we say and pass on to other people things that we know by the holy spirit within us and so i want to take a portion and get back to second corinthians 5 today for a short time and i want you to really be listening i believe the lord has something for us here let's just start at verse 18. verse excuse me verse 17. no it wouldn't be that it would be all the way back up to you think the preacher knows you know where to start somebody says just pick one verse 14 for the love of christ constraineth us because we thus judge that if one died i'll use this microphone now that if one died the love of christ concrete because we judge that if one died for all then we're all dead and that he died for all that they which should not they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again wherefore henceforth know we know man after the flesh yea though we known christ after the flesh yet no now henceforth know we him no more therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things become new you notice that new creation there and the new creation is christ coming in you that's by creation that's not by just you giving your heart to the lord god god brings the new man christ in you and that's a new creation and all things are of god who hath reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation today my subject is this reconciliation verse 18 all things are of god who hath reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world to himself i want you just because of father's day i want you to word it this way is that the father was in christ the word pulling and drawing and reconciling his children back to himself the father was in christ but what was in there he was reconciling his children back to himself to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation now then we are ba ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us we pray you in christ said be ye reconciled to god what a powerful statement that paul can make and if you have christ in you you can make there's a cry in our hearts to this world to those that are his children come be reconciled back to god i'm standing in christ's dead be reconciled back to god amen heavenly father bless your word today bless those ears that here today whether it be streaming or in the building today we just pray that hearts would open up to your word and as we spend this time with you we pray that the holy ghost that is so real among us we felt your presence here this morning come and be real to us speak to us give us that revelation from your throne i pray and lord may the relationship with you be closer than it has ever been because of the words that are spoken this war morning we commit the service holy to you in the name of the lord jesus christ we ask it amen and amen amen god bless you shake someone's hand before you're seated this morning god bless you each one it's good to have you in the service amen paul says here that he was given the ministry of reconciliation that's quite a powerful statement that it wasn't just that god was in christ but the ministry of reconciling children back to the father come into paul's hands and paul's words that he spoke and this is what we've been speaking on the power of our words because god didn't just make us christians just so that we can be delivered but he made us christians so that the words we speak from christ within us can bring deliverance to someone else this isn't a selfish thing that i have the lord and it's just me and the lord but god puts you in his body and fills you with himself so that you can give the kingdom to someone else that you can preach the kingdom to someone else you may not be a preacher behind this pulpit but god gives you something so that you can speak words of life to someone else remember last sunday solomon said in the bible death and life are in the power of the tongue your words can speak death to someone but your words can also speak life to someone and for christians we can speak life because we have life we can speak life to someone because we have life to give to someone and so this word of reconciliation i want to do i wanted a little bit this morning i want to title this message the father reconciled with his children and fit right in with father's day the father being reconciled with his children and so this word of reconciliation not only did paul have it but we are given that as well and we are given words that have power within them if we have the holy ghost sons and daughters of god become reconciled with their father even today because the very reason that we're still here and not in heaven yet is there still some children to be reconciled with the father we in the bride we call it the seed of god one of the reasons we're still here is there's still some seed of god out there there's still some children of god out there and one of the reasons we're not gone yet in a rapture is because there's still children to be reconciled with the father that might be your child that might be your son or daughter that's away from the lord that might be you sitting here this morning that might be a stranger that you've never met but you'll meet them this week and you'll say something to them they're still children to be reconciled with the heavenly father and you will be used to reconcile that amen and so that that's been uh the the a theme that i've been and talking about but i i want to we've been talking about how god does that how does he reconcile how does he draw life how does he pull that christ out of someone and we've been speaking very specifically in the last few services about how he does it but it's god reconciling do you want anybody want to know what the message of the last days is the message of the last days is really god it's the word coming to us to bring sons and daughters back to god that's what the message is is to bring sons and daughters of god who are alienated from god who are away from god to draw them back to pull them back to speak a word to draw his sons back into his kingdom that's what the message was set for people are saying that the message is this that and the other and and doubting it and making it a dress code or whatever it is that's all part of it but i don't look at it that way i look at it his word came to us because jesus christ is the word and he said he would come in the last days and speak his word and his word is a word of reconciliation bringing his sons and daughters back can you say amen and that's what jesus said one place he says when one sinner repenteth all of heaven has a shouting time when one sinner comes back to the father then all of heaven rejoices what makes heaven rejoice it's when one of his sons is reconciled back to him that's why we rejoice in that because all of heaven is rejoicing what makes heaven rejoice what makes heaven what makes the whole of heaven get excited is when one sinner comes back the son comes back and so now we have a message a word it's a word of reconciliation god speaks in the last days and when he speaks that message is the purpose of it is a word to bring sons and daughters back into fellowship again with the father praise the lord the word the word reconciliation means the restoration of friendly relations it means also the action of making one view or believe the belief compatible with another i like the first uh meaning to it and also the in the greek meeting it's similar the restoration of friendly relations in other words you're not on friendly relations there's been a a disfellowship there's been a wall that's come up between you and god and so now to reconcile that it means that it's to bring a restoration to fellowship a restoration and this reconciling is such an important word not only to god but also in our family relationships and also in marriage relationships how many has ever heard the term when someone gets a divorce a lot of times the only reason the only reason is that it's irreconcilable differences that's what they write in the sheet of paper irreconcilable differences it may not be something as extreme as adultery or something like that but it's just they've tried so hard and they cannot reconcile their differences so that's what they have a grounds for a divorce for we cannot reconcile what is shame in this age that things can't be reconciled but let me tell you about a father let me tell you about a god this morning for marriage for family whoever it is when he comes in your heart you're serving a god that knows about reconciliation he knows how to do reconciliation he knows how to restore a marriage and the reason he knows how to bring it back together again and take down all the walls is because he's had to do that with you he's had to take every wall down and he come running for you to find you you're not looking for him but he loves you so much the father's coming looking for you you're my child and i want to see you back in fellowship with me even after the fall when they fell in sin and they're hiding in the bushes and they're hiding there covering themselves with their own little fig leaf religion even then it was god who's coming to find his son and say adam where are you it wasn't us saying god i need you i need help it was god running towards his children what happened where are you at why are you hiding oh god we did this and then we fell in sin he says come out of those bushes i'm going to give you a blood i'm going to give you an atonement brother joel spoke on atonement wednesday night i'm going to give you a place of fellowship again because i'm crying for fellowship with my children a third of the angels fell by lucifer's deception and god never went after them but one son of god falls one daughter of god falls and god is rushing to them saying where are you that's how much he loves you this morning a third of the angels and there's no word that god went after them but one son and one daughter that got away from god and said he's running towards them aren't you glad this morning it's not you running towards god but it's him finding you we serve of god of reconciliation we serve of god of restoration in the greek uh reconcile means and i can't pronounce the greek word apocalso to fully reconcile and one writer says this reconciliation completely transforms someone from one condition to another it removes all the enmity and leaves no hindrance to peace and unity it removes all the walls it removes the enmity that means you become an enemy of god you become against god and in any relationship you become enemies to one another here's a power in reconciliation that removes all enmity and leaves no hindrance to peace and unity that's why we sing the song saying it wednesday night after our brother joelle spoke on atonement he is our peace he is our peace who has broken down the wall he brings peace in the relationship when there wasn't peace between us if you're without god this morning there's no peace between you and god and there's probably not a lot of peace with other people as well because how can you have the proper peace with other people if you haven't made peace with god you and god are at odds oh you may pray when you're an emergency but i'm not talking about that i'm talking about fellowship i'm talking about there's nothing between you and god there's no sin there's no love there's no hindrance there's harmony and fellowship between you and god and god has a way of drawing you that he removes all the hindrances to peace and unity and you are one with the heavenly father paul says in the bible that at that time ye were without christ and i'm reading these scriptures because in the meaning they used this word enmity there was a time you were without christ being aliens i don't know if you can find the scripture brothers being aliens from the commonwealth of israel and strangers from the covenants of the promise having no hope and without god in the world but now in christ jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of jesus christ for he is our peace who hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us having abolished in the flesh the enmity even the law of commandments contained in ordinances for to make in himself of twain one new man so making peace and that he might reconcile both unto god in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereof there's that word enmity again there's the word aliens we were aliens we we were without god we were we were we were not nigh to god but his blood made us nigh colossians 1 20 if you brothers can pull it up having made peace through the blood of his cross having made peace through the blood of his cross would you have that colossians 1 20 having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him i say whether they be things in earth or things in heaven and you that were sometimes alienated there it is again he called us aliens before and now we're alien and you who were sometimes alienated and listen to this and enemies in your mind by wicked works yet now hath god reconciled in the body of his flesh through that to present you holy unblameable unreprovable in his sight my i say praise the lord aliens distant from god can you say amen and who made the effort first to that you were no longer an alien god did through his blood leave those scriptures up god did through his blood he said that in the body was flesh to present you so he doesn't just bring you and reconcile you and and by the way i don't have time to get into this reconciliation is deeper than just forgiveness and repentance reconciliation is deeper than just repentance and forgiveness you can forgive someone but not be reconciled with them you can repent but there's another thing of reconciling god's power is not just and that's a lot of christianity it's people come and repent but they haven't been reconciled in a fellowship with god yet the message came to reconcile us with god sons and daughters back in eden again in fellowship with him amen so now uh when we look at words like aliens and you're distant from god but you see in an enmity against uh you as his child were an enemy against your father i know we don't like to hear that but without god we are actually an enmity we're at enmity with god we're an enemy of god you say well i wasn't an enemy of god until you get the new birth you're actually not you're actually an enemy of god say where did you get that i just read it to you in the bible we're an enemy against god we are enemies against him hard to swallow actually it says in james 4 4 which said sonny james is from the show me state and he's pretty straight about stuff brother james in the bible this is the way he said it james 4 4 you can bring the scripture up james 4 and verse 4 ye adulterers and adulteresses james is pretty straight ye adulterers and your adulteresses know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with god whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is an enemy of god don't forget brother paul didn't say that your bible that you read says can i have that scripture i sure love the scriptures to be up so you people can see them james 4 and verse 4 ye adulterers and adulteresses know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with god whosoever therefore whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is an enemy of god amen praise the lord so it wasn't god that was enemy against us it wasn't god that had done us wrong we have a perfect heavenly father this morning but us without god and not in fellowship with god and friendship with the world we're at enmity against god we're fighting against god not me i'm a good person listen great tremendous but listen if you're not in fellowship with him by the blood of jesus christ your friendship with the world is an enemy against god and the only way to break that that enmity is the blood of jesus christ and the father coming to you and you being reconciled with him it's the only answer since you're so quiet here this morning i'll just slow down and be quiet myself let me take a minute and just a minute and talk about the detachment of fathers in this generation from their children it is one of the worst problems that we have fathers emotionally detached for the most part emotionally detached from their children sometimes they provide for them sometimes they do everything for them but they're detached and that effect has symptoms to it on a culture you can have mom there and mom's one thing but and a lot of times mom is the hands-on person which she's supposed to be but because of that dad backs off and dad is emotionally detached from his children there's a lot of symptoms that come in culture because fathers are detached from the children they're not reconciled with their children and the distance starts when they're young sometimes and gets worse and worse and worse and worse i tell you you ought to thank god today if you have a good father in this life you ought to raise your hand say thank you lord that i had a good father that wasn't emotionally detached and wasn't just not there and you had a good relationship with him because we have some good ones but since it's father's day we have to talk about this whole culture a problem there's a theme in the bible of children being alienated from the heavenly father but the reason we were alienated was because of sin because of our sin can you say amen and then redemption throughout is throughout the bible the redemption says i'm bringing my children back i'm paying the price i'm bringing them back into fellowship again we didn't deserve that but god says i'll pay the price and i'm bringing my children back because he didn't fail us we failed him that's the difference in the culture of this world we have fathers that fail their children not all fathers but fathers fail their children they're looking as a young child to a connection with the father it is so important that teenage girls connect with their father even young girls it's not just mom but daddy's connect a girl develops a girl it's a confidence in herself a girl develops and if she doesn't get that attention from her father she'll seek that attention through the wrong type of boy it happens every day girls because daddy didn't connect and tell her she was pretty and all these other things and i heard somebody recently say father shouldn't say their their their daughters are pretty i don't know what where what in the world don't you know the heavenly father and how he compliments and he praises and he encourages his sons and daughters how can you miss that a father's power over a daughter to tell her she's pretty and she's valuable we'll give her confidence in this life amen it's good to have you awake welcome back i finally found the thing that woke you up this is a this is a nash international problem father's detached and it has lots of symptoms to us that we won't spend a lot of time on this but redemption the body says he'll bring us back so this wall this detachment if it's spoken of in the bible with our heavenly father then this is a prevalent problem in our generation more than any other generation and there are clear symptoms to the failure of our culture that comes from children not having the best relationship with their fathers did you know that our ability and this is from this is from a psychologist did you know that our ability to sustain satisfying or committed relationships to find gratification in our work life to be effective parents to speak up and assert ourselves is largely dependent on the relationship we had and have with our fathers let me read it again our ability to sustain satisfying and committed relationships in life to find gratification in our work life to be effective parents to speak up and assert ourselves is largely dependent on the relationship we have our fathers our relationship with our fathers is a powerful bond that's been rarely closely examined until recent years it was overlooked as a major influence on a child's development and quality of life as is the impact our relationship with our fathers have on our own mothers this relationship has an enormous and long-lasting influence on a child which continues throughout their adult life we might not realize it but countless areas that concern our personal lives and well-being are linked to the kind of relationship we had with our dads the biggest problem in relationship is usually the inability to commit the fear of abandonment the lack of communication poor emotional intelligence or understanding of ourselves and understanding our wife or our husband these are the things that come from it and it becomes it says because we got different type of dads in this world we've got the absent dad we've got the divorced dad we've got the addicted dad we've got the distant dad we've got the critical dad we've got the rejecting neglecting dad we've got the unfaithful dad we've got the doting dad we've got the seductive dad we've got the abandoner dad we've got the deceased dad we've got the taken dad who's separated from his children and we have the narcissist dad this is what they've diagnosed is the wrong kind of dads in life and we see all the symptoms that come because of these type of deaths once again raise your hand thank god if you didn't have a lot of these characteristics in your father there is no perfect father in this life the perfect father we look to is our heavenly father he's the perfect father and thank god we have one as an image to look to but thank god if you didn't have a lot of this stuff but this is prevalent in our society these type of dads and there are symptoms in our culture because of all i could read the definition of all this i didn't want to spend much time on this because i don't like psychology just to diagnose the problem i think they diagnosed it right but i have the answer this morning i don't like just to talk about our problems because we get in the molly grubs about and think there's no hope there is hope this morning in our heavenly father and whatever relationship has been damaged or destroyed there is healing in the heavenly father there's healing in the word praise the lord and this of course is because there's no perfect father in life we have all dealt with some of these at some level no doubt some of these types of fathers and sometimes there's reconciliation with them but sometimes there's never reconciliation and what do we do we grow as a christian anyway we can get beyond it anyway through the help of the lord and we forgive and we thank god for the good things that was in our father you can get over it you can be healed there one writer said there are no perfect parents and there are certainly no perfect children but there are plenty of perfect moments along the way can you say imagine plenty of perfect moments along the way and that's because of god's help that's because the presence of the lord that's because an image of our heavenly father can so affect a man and a mom and a dad that he can be influenced from that from our heavenly father's image and he can be a begin to express the image of what a real father is say what about all the past it can be forgiven it can be changed in 33 years 34 years of pastoring i've seen it happen over and over and over again god through his presence changing a narcissist father changing a father who abandons his family the power of god can do it is that okay with everybody but the biggest victory is to come to know the heavenly father who loves us in all the ways that we missed out let me say it again the greatest victory in a christian's life is that in the imperfections of our father on earth we come to know a heavenly father who loves us in all the ways that we missed out on in this relationship he didn't fail us we failed him we fell in sin we alienated ourself but then this father comes to us to pay the price to reconcile us back to him he paid the price to reconcile us back to him and then come closer to us because he wants friendly relationship and he gives us unconditional love because he's drawing us back in he loves us unconditionally it'd be like you had a father in this life and you hadn't been with him last night i was reading tons of stories that i could find of detached children from their fathers sometimes 20 30 years and a lot of times it wasn't the father's fault it was the child who went astray a child who married maybe the wrong person and that that mate pulled his the man away from his family couldn't see the grandkids couldn't see the father it was one father said 20 years 20 years and then all of a sudden he got a divorce from his wife and the doors open he had been sending letters he had been sending him and his wife just sending letters trying to make reconciliation trying to have some form of fellowship 20 years he shut them out i thought of ourselves friends how we can shut out the father's love can you say amen god trying to speak to you through ministers god trying to love you in different ways i'm trying to get a hold of you that's so you can be reconciled and you shut it out and shut it out and shut it out until finally something happened to open the door and he says finally now we're in fellowship we can see our grandkids and we've made reconciliation praise god if that can happen in that way then god can do it in our lives amen and so we we're the ones who fell away and it would be like a father if you haven't seen him in 20 years and you moved way far away from your father on earth and the father is sending you letters and he's trying to make contact maybe the letter's getting get to you maybe you turn down letters i'm making up my own story here but it's just as an example that he could be so far away and live in a different country and then and then you hear of him coming he's coming and he comes and he shows up at the service this morning first time you've seen him in 20 years you've got such bitterness in your heart sets such a feeling in your heart and now you haven't seen him because of you you haven't seen him and he pays five thousand dollars for a ticket he comes in and sits right beside you and you're going what are you doing here after 20 years what are you doing here he says i've come i've paid five thousand dollars for a ticket i've traveled all this way flew into a certain airport and i've come i haven't come to see america i haven't come to see new york i haven't come i've come for one purpose i've paid the price for one purpose is to sit here next to you and i'm asking for reconciliation that's our heavenly father that's how far he's willing to come to leave the portals of heaven and to come down among us what's the whole story of jesus christ the father coming down to become flesh so he can be reconciled with you you not the person sitting next to you reconciled with you the word is sent to every generation and in that word is the father how many know that jesus christ is the word jesus christ is not just the man 2000 years ago he is the word of every generation jesus is the word of every judge i can prove it to you by the bible moses left the comforts of egypt to follow the lord and he left the for the reproach of christ hebrews says for the reproach of christ how can you use christ in moses christ wasn't around oh yes he was the word of that day was christ and the word of every day of that hour is christ being expressed and in that word is the father that's how he comes to you through the word spoken by a prophet or spoken by a minister oh if god can let you look past the veil of all your hindrances and all your bitterness and all the flesh that you've seen and all the trouble that you've seen and look past the veil past the skin and see in the ministers and in the prophet it is your father in them speaking to be reconciled back to you but it's the skin test as i said last sunday it's always the skin test people don't believe it because they fail at the skin that god's hiding in but the father is in the word calling out to you the father came in the message of the last days and it's the father calling his children for this last days praise the lord why did you come and pay all this money why did you come from so far why did you pay that kind of money and your father says to get back in harmony and fellowship with you i'm here for one purpose i said i'm here for one purpose today i'm here in this church speaking to you for no other reason except for to say god is there anything that you can anoint in my words to draw your children closer to yourself i didn't come here to be seen i didn't come here for you to see my nice suit that has purple stripes through it and it's so nice i didn't come for you to see that although it is a pretty nice suit i didn't come here to be seen i didn't come here for lunch i didn't come i'm only here for one purpose and i can guarantee the heavenly father has been in this service and he's only come for one purpose it's because you're you're one of his children and he wants to be reconciled with you he doesn't just want this distant relationship he wants to he wants to be in fellowship with you like adam and eve were in the garden of eden no hindrances no sin everything's under the blood and there's open fellowship with one another and i'm not talking about the person next to you i'm talking to you he wants fellowship with you to get back in harmony with you so we'll just take the next step here just for a minute you still with me amen god reconciled us back to fellowship with himself through someone the bible says god was in christ reconciling the world to himself and so in order to reconcile he worked and spoke through someone and it was jesus christ the word that he came and spoke through everything that he did everything that christ was everything that he said had one great purpose it was to draw god's people in and restore them back to him there was a pull in jesus to attract people to him for the result of connecting them back to god people were drawn to them you know the scripture i mentioned about one sinner that repenteth all heaven rejoices that's scripture just before it comes a situation where jesus was in a house and all the sinners gathered around him all the people that were it wasn't the pharisees that it wasn't the religious people that gathered around jesus he was drawing sinners i always say what was it in jesus that was so attractive that the sinners felt comfortable to come and listen to him and religious people did not i wonder if that would happen today i wonder if all of our religious organizations and let me just say this our organizations not the people but our systems of organization i don't feel like the heavenly father uses them to reconcile children back to god i think they're just systems god's never used a system he didn't use it in the pharisees and sadducees he don't use it today but he uses his word through gospel ministers to reconcile his children back to himself i know that's a straight statement but god doesn't work through systems and all kinds of organized religion god has never worked through that god does not want to work through that he just wants to work through his word bring his presence and the father comes down in that word and draws his children to himself that's why you can have a person that's never been to a religious organization never walk through the door of a church and someone can witness to them and the power of god is in that witness and they come to the lord right there with never being in a church because this isn't based upon which church you go to isn't that the first question everybody asks you what's church do you i'm a christian which church do you go to why does that always have to be an issue which church do you go to this isn't a church identity this is an identity with jesus christ this gospel of redemption is about god coming and being reconciled with his sons and daughters and he has accomplished that not only through calvary but 2 000 years later he's come and opened his word to the people who through the seven seals were being revealed spoke through his messenger malachi 4 5-6 and then now brings his word to us to bring all of his children back to his throne god the father was in the word reconciling the world to himself praise the lord so this text that he read is is has predestination this is why i preach and live paul has said i have this ministry of reconciliation now this is why i preach and live the truth to reconcile restore people back to god and god has committed to us the word of reconciliation as well we are standing in christ's dead this morning with the invitation come and be reconciled back to god but but i don't need to do anything further i'm a good person i think in our own eyes we're all a good person didn't the bible say every man is righteous in his own eyes if we're going to let us us diagnose ourselves we come out smelling pretty good sometimes don't we but when the word examines which is what we're supposed to be examined by says in first corinthians examine your own selves by what by yourselves no by the word then we see we need god then we see we fail then we see our imperfections and we look at the mirror of the word and thing about this mirror is that we're looking at it and it may reflect our imperfections but there's a power in here that we see the image and if we keep looking at this we're changed into the image of the heavenly father but we all come if we diagnose ourself we all come out smelling pretty good we all come out looking pretty good the gospel is not based upon just you being a good person because i can name a lot of rap artists a lot of movie stars speak against christ mock it mock it so i can't even say what they say but because they say they're a good person they're going to make it into heaven and if they ever ask me i would have to be truthful and say that's not how we make it to heaven see some of you have bought into a little bit of that idea if i can just be nice to people and be a good person i think you should be nice to people you should do that it's much nicer world it's a much nicer world if we're nice to people always be humble and kind tim mcgraw says oh it's so nice oh and teach your children i love that that's fine i love that somebody has those themes out always be humble and kind but it's interesting it's always without the word without christ without redemption without the blood and we can't be reconciled to god without the blood of jesus christ which is in his word and us embracing his word completely i take your word lord the blood and fellowship is in the word okay where are you getting your scriptures at you got scripture basis for that yes and i'm trying to think of it right now give me a minute got so many things going through my mind someone in first john where it says the blood he says by the blood by the word we have fellowship with one another and the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all sin that's what it says so the blood is tied with the word and our fellowship with god and one another is tied to the blood and to the word and when man detach it from that then you're detaching from christ's redemption and the way he's said to do things it has to be through blood and his benefits of his blood is in the word i'm being real deep with you here this morning but i'm just asking you to think about it good people there'll probably be a lot of good people that don't make it to heaven because why they turn down the blood of jesus christ so that's a real straight statement but i don't like people to buy into the idea if i'm just kind i'll you know i'll get a free pass i won't even get that free pass i think we should be kind we think we should be loving and i think if you have christianity you'd be more loving and kind than anybody else you'd be this vicious mean person and claim christ i don't think that's right either but we'll get in because and then he says i've got to move along and close he says we having this ministry of reconciliation we know no man after the flesh because we are always looking in our witness for that part of christ within them to rise above all the sin and darkness and past to connect them back with christ connect connect them back with the father it's our ministry it's a believer's ministry the holy ghost how you have the ministry of reconciliation that's why you can't know any man after the flesh if you judge them by the flesh you'll say they'll never make it they'll never do you judge them by their past they'll never make it in but something within us has to look past the flesh and say something or minister something to see is there anything in that life that's down there sometimes friend even if they've grown up in church their whole life they become so covered over with all kinds of mud and bitterness and everything it's hard to find something in there that's going to respond to the lord but it's our job to keep praying and keep speaking until the darkness is moved away and oh there it is there's something within them to respond to god can you say amen there's something there and we're looking for that we know no man after the flesh but we're doing and i like this quote i have them put it on the screen john henry joett he's a great christian writer and he said we are called and he's saying this to preachers and pastors but i think it goes for all of us john henry joe said and i'd like you to put it up you have it there john henry joe it said we are called to be guides and guardians of the souls of men leading them into the way of peace we are to be constantly engaged with eternal interest leading the thoughts and the wills of men to the things that primarily matter and disengaging them from lesser or meanier concerns which hold them in servitude leave it right there this is what we're called to not the rest of the world is called this us christians we're called to lean their thoughts away from things that aren't as important in menial things of life to the things of eternal life that's what we're supposed to be witnessing about to guide their minds and to guide their souls towards not temporal things but eternal things i like that can you say amen we are to be the friends of the bridegroom winning men not to ourselves but to him matchmaking for the lord amen ever heard of a matchmaker me and my wife have done a little bit of that through prayer some of them have worked out some of them not so well i do believe we had a little part in eli and kendall and that turned out real well eli's been in my church since i started the church brother eli is our treasure now kindle my sec our secretary and what a tremendous couple for the lord what a tremendous couple for the lord and now they have a son and growing in the lord she came to our retreat years ago didn't know anything about the message of the last days didn't know much about anything god got a hold of her heart that was years and years ago and uh but eli was in my church grew up on church as a shy fellow and so a few times i would suggest certain girls and he'd run away so i had to re we had to be really careful you know so me and my wife we were a little bit involved in this matchmaking and we had to tread very softly when it come to kindle we just said if i said a few things and and i won't give the details because i want to embarrass them but here they are today matchmaker matchmaker make me a match find me a fine there's some other ones in here too i think but all you guys just stay away from my daughters though she went to camp gabriel went to camp she's 18. she gets these guys all around her like sharks you know just swarming i said you if a guy asked for your number at camp this is your response get a piece of paper and write it down 1-800 get lost you hand it back to them so we are to be friends of the bridegroom winning not to ourselves and you know john henry joe is referring to what is in the bible where they come and ask john the baptist i just i wish i could go into this next sunday or sometime this whole bridegroom and friend friend because he says the friend of the bridegroom they come to john his disciples come said why are we baptizing people and now jesus is over there baptizing because john said behold the lamb of god and there was a transition from the prophet to christ and he's baptizing people and john sometimes what's going on here now which ministry is you know is right now and should he be baptizing isn't this us shouldn't we be pointing to you john the baptist shouldn't we you know encourage the people who would be coming and you know just visit jeffersonville and just come and put your attention on you aren't you the one and so he says no no no no he said he that's a friend of the bridegroom friend of the bridegroom rejoices at the voice of the bridegroom but a friend of the bridegroom isn't necessarily the bride so now christ has come he's calling his bride and he says i'm rejoicing that because it's time to call his bride this is a whole different level this is not the best man of the wedding this is not a friend of the bridegroom but this is the bride and groom coming together in relationship right his last words were this i must decrease john the baptist the prophet i must decrease and he must increase now and that's the way we need to be when we're a witness he says it's not about bringing people to us it's just pointing people to the heavenly father can you say amen that's our job and he said but to him matchmaking for the lord abundantly satisfied when we have brought the bride and the bridegroom together that's what should bring us satisfaction is when the bride and the bridegroom come together is when sons and daughters are reconciled with their heavenly father can you say amen praise the lord so i'm going to have to find a place so we are not here to serve ourselves but drawing out others that part of christ that's lost and we and that can't find their way back to fellowship with god everything that we say and do should reflect this purpose be ye reconciled back to god i have the holy ghost within me for one purpose not to show off but that i call out my spiritual life calls out to every person no matter where they're at be ye reconciled back to god now this quote of brother branham was the last quote in the church age book and i like to read it i read it periodically because it to me it shows the purpose here we are john joe is saying this thing and your prophet says the same thing whatever people think of william mary and branham here's his purpose not for one moment if you have this quote i like to read it over and over but brother branham says not for one moment do i bring a message to the people that they may follow me or join my church or start some fellowship at an organization i have never done that and will not do that now i have no interest in those things but i do have an interest in the things of god and people and if i can accomplish just one thing i will be satisfied that one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between god and men they said it through the bible and the prophet of the last days which we believe if you have time after the service i'll share with you throughout the bible malachi 4 5 6 luke 17. all these other scriptures that speak of a restorative ministry at the end he's dead and gone on he's done his work already but this was his purpose it's not to start an organization it's not to start a movement but to accomplish one thing to see a spiritual relationship established between god and men you can take the whole message no matter what you've seen on the internet no matter what post you've seen from people that are so bitter you better quit listening to those voices and listen to the voice itself himself that he never come to start a cult and whatever way you look at the message this is the purpose you can take the entire message of william branham and sum it up this is to accomplish one thing to reconcile you back to the father can i get an amen this morning so one scripture says and i'm closing he said he came with the blood of the cross and he says when he paid the price at the blood of his cross he did it to reconcile to reconcile all things unto him things are in heaven things that are in earth with at that cross right after he paid the price there was a power there was a seeking that went forth from the cross from that day forward to go find all of his children and it says i'm seeking i'm reconciling all things in heaven all things in earth and the prophet comments right there and he says now watch where that goes now watch where it all goes in heaven and in earth it doesn't matter what came from the cross is now the father coming through the word and he's coming out from the cross now and he has one purpose he's seeking his children he's seeking to be reconciled with his children now this is 2 000 years later but he's still seeking his children he said i'm gonna reconcile all things in christ wherever they're at he's hunting he's seeking you weren't seeking him you see and so he comes i know kyle so i can embarrass him so he comes in a little high school and lindsay's going to high school and she's serving the lord her parents are here today trying to direct her in the way of life and they did a good job to get her in church around the world she served the lord kyle becomes interested and starts to be wooed by not only her good looks but also something within her and he says can i go out on a date i'm paraphrasing my own story here but can i go on a date and she says no i don't do that i don't do that but you can come to church with me i don't know what he felt about that but he was willing to come to church for her god see that was a little romance going on but they they didn't know till now till later it was the father said i'm i'm reconciling with my children and he's using a little romantic incident but from calvary ever since calvary has been seeking his children and he finds kyle and he says that's my son that's my son and through this little romantic incident he finds him in that high school he comes baptized filled with the spirit of god raising a family in the admonition of the lord that's what this message is all about you just keep seeking keep singing somebody's thinking where is he going to step towards nancy what in the world see some of your stories i i don't have the permission to embarrass you i did it to kyle but some of the stories i don't have the permission to to do it but there's you're sitting by all kinds of stories and i can tell you they're not it's not a religion of some denomination the father came and found his daughter sister laura's story she will share it with you amazing story and today she sends sits here as a paradox loving this word still praying for her family to come to this world but it's a paradox she's sitting here but i can tell you this there's there's no religion here the father found his daughter and spoke things through the ministers whoever it was and she something in her connected with the heavenly father through the word it's the message that's the message don't let the internet tell you that the message is anything else it's the father seeking his children this guy this guy here just you know in and out and a little bit up and down there just trying to find his way and then you know he was dating a girl and she wasn't a believer i teased him i said you're still dating that philistine he said yep but we loved him and we you know and then he was away for about but then something comes and anybody who wants to say that this young man is sitting on the front row enjoying raising his hands serving the lord that this is some religion you're crazy god the heavenly father was seeking his son and he's found him and his son responded and that's what's happening here don't you ever make this a religion this is the father seeking his children sorry bud you can get me in an alley later but i'm working out i always want to let you know my son-in-law has got me working out every day he's about to kill me i might be ready for you it's the father since calvary what's he been doing sends the holy spirit in his word and he's getting all of his children he wants fellowship with he wants to be reconciled say well what about all my sin he paid the price for that leave it at calvary leave it at the cross he looks at you through righteous eyes through his own eyes he sees you righteous let me tell you another story can i tell you one more before we go today is the anniversary of brother tim sister janeth we married them two years ago here a few months before that we baptized her in him in the name of the lord jesus christ so in colombia a little girl mom died at five years old family didn't show her much attention 12 years old she's turned out she leaves home has nobody has no love goes to bogota the big city how many people 9 million people 12 year old girl lost in a city that big and none of us really know all that took place she was pretty quiet about it but she's by herself no god no no friends no family no one and she did that for years just made her own way in a huge city and then time went on i think she was would you say 28 29 30 and brother tim has some business there he goes to columbia it's involved in the i don't know if it was a coffee business back then but he's down there and i don't know it was before that but her cousins are in the message of the last days believing the truth of god she has two or three cousins that were message pastors down there they just feel in their heart they just say where's where's janith at she's because never hardly contact her where's she at and they felt to seek her out and so they made contact with her somehow and it's amazing they even found her so i'm just stopping at everything here and tell you it wasn't the cousins seeking her out it was her heavenly father through people it was god that dropped it on those men's hearts this godfather's seeking this girl no one had no one no telling what you know what she had to go through so they figure out they give her some materials they witness to her a little bit talk to her about it something slow begins to happen and then tim visits and they meet at a restaurant or wherever they met and she's she doesn't know english he doesn't know spanish so they sit down and they have a date and they're communicating with their phones to translate everything that gets said so there's there's a little attraction starting here and they're willing to do whatever they need to do to talk with one another so they have their first time together as first date together and they talk and he asks a question something like you know what what's your greatest fear and she said that i would that i would die alone that i would die alone and he responds and he says well that's not going to happen he's on his way home and the plane says this is my first date why in the world am i telling this girl that's not going to happen he said you've been preaching lately about this creation participating what we say has power in it we don't realize what we're saying sometimes he said right there he said i said something to her making a commitment almost saying something it had to be god saying that from me to her that's not going to happen you're not going to die alone relationship continues i just want to let you know brother tim you you know this but that wasn't you through you the father was seeking his daughter janith you don't think he's seen her when she was 12 years old cast out of her home you don't think the father was watching over her life preserving her life you don't think he was there the whole time watch and all of a sudden he orders these people to talk to her tim comes in her life they come back they eventually get together they're married she comes back in here she you know he can he can tell you the details i i said i'll tell it this morning because he probably couldn't make it through it but you can ask him it's a wonderful story related to our assembly here and it was the father seeking his daughter the father seeking the daughter jesus said one day i have needs to go by samaria i don't just arrange everything disciples i've got to go by sumerian walks up that recent movie of the chosen shows it so well and here she's a woman at the well and here he comes up and he's waiting there at the well she's the only one there and they make this connection in a matter of just a few minutes of a conversation a girl finds out i'm not a harlot i'm a daughter of god why did he have a need to go by samaria because the father was reconciling with a daughter so they get together and they get in the coffee business they're doing all these things you know and then she says i've got to find a church club her cousins told her about our church a couple years ago and they start come down and tim's going two hours away is there anything closer than two hours away but there was a hunger in both of them god was seeking boaz and miriam happen to live up there which is so convenient they don't live there anymore as of yesterday they're my neighbors down here in lambertville and temperance welcome neighbor [Applause] but god had boaz and miriam there for a purpose for jonathan tim because from what i've been preaching it has to come through the body somewhere they ministered to them they helped them they encouraged them they brought them down to church but they started coming down but he came down and they they come in this service in the first service brother tim says he's nervous he doesn't know anybody he just don't know what to do but he knows that his wife needs the fellowship he needs the fellowship they need to hear the word of god the cousins recommended the church they come down and he said that she she he he was a little nervous and he went in the bathroom and he come out and he looked in the best of our old church here two years ago and he's seen janet surrounded surrounded by the women of this church and he just looked at it and says this this is of god this is this is great this is what she needs surrounded her i think the sisters even wednesday night we had somebody just stop by and people just stopped by in church here and just getting to her right away welcoming them god bless you sisters for that we're not here for ourselves we're not here just to please ourselves and surroundings is just loving her and she he loved the fellowship and attention and then they got baptized at that baptism he says is when god really changed sister janet really she grew so quick in the lord i never seen anybody so grow so quick in the word she just grew she'd become just a mature way she looked at things so quickly so quickly but he knew this is the place that they needed to come no matter now the distance doesn't mean anything to them i can tell you there's many there's hundreds of stories even in this church this is the one i want to talk about because the families in town they want to come and be prayed for our dear sister his mom what was your name against pat lost her they lost their father lost her husband october of last year we lost our dad mom and her were able to get together yesterday and compare notes encourage one another we need the body of christ but i just wanted to end with janet today because i i see there's no other story to it except the father was finding his son and his daughter and he will find you wherever you're at you may be sitting in here this morning but he loves you he will find you and you're going to find when you come to him if you really come to him the right way it's it's not about worrying about people it's not about worrying about all the details it's just come to him just repent just come don't try to over complicate this don't try to get distracted by people just embrace the love of god as he embraces you can you say amen hundreds of stories but i can tell you it's all about the father being reconciled with his children can you say amen why don't you stand with me that was brother tim's birthday yesterday and their anniversary today the story to me doesn't end it in a defeat because the last part of it where he says she says i don't want to die alone he says that's not going to happen he was almost prophesying because janith who was by herself all those years was certainly not alone when god took her and she certainly wasn't alone when she stepped into the other dimension she got to see my dad quicker than i do amen she was surrounded by the body she was surrounded by friends and then when she went in that hospital the other thing was is that i went up and sat in the lobby knowing i couldn't get in there because of covet and i just wanted to be there for brother tim and pray and i said i don't know why i'm coming up here but i just want to support you guys he asked the nurse she wasn't supposed to do this and she was a christian lady and he asked and asked and asked a few times to find she comes she said let's do it let's do it let's get the pastor up here something was happening she didn't you know like she said i don't want to die alone and through covet god gets the pastor upstairs i snuck up there don't tell nobody state of michigan come and get me governor come get me and i walked into a room where a lady was all smiles all smiles suffering in pain but all smiles complete mature christian that's how i always say if they've come to that victory in divine love and god says it's their time to go then it's their time because all of us when we come to a victory in divine love we're going she'd already come to it quicker than me she says i know if you lay hands on me i know that god can completely take this cancer away and i'll step up and walk out of here i know completely possible with god then she just turned she says if god chooses not to do that i'm ready to go do you want me to tell anything to your dad i just i wasn't even thinking about this you know what if she goes she gets to see him before me she said do i need to write down what do you want to tell your daddy tell your friends this is real this is real and that woman she's in the hospital miriam got to go see her i got to see her we sent support and listen sister janet did not die alone and she certainly didn't cross into the other dimension alone i think janet had an effect on all of us a lot of some of you are crying she had an effect on our lives more than we had on her how many raise your hand and say that what the miraculous work of the lord that took place in that girl's life and in tim's life this gospel this last day's message is not complicated the father is going to find his sons and daughters he's found a lot of you this morning and he wants to be in fellowship with you with no hindrances heavenly father i appreciate you brother tim would you guys come and if you don't mind i just got to pray for you anyone else who needs prayer this morning heavenly father um is there some who gather around us to pray for their family this loss that they had and recently and we want to send them with our blessing today god's doing something god's held this family together god's doing something you see you you guys are part of the this whole blueprint that god had this whole plan you guys are all part of it you see you have to know that every once we have those moments we realize it's not just life we're walking into god's plan and we're part of god's plan and that's a reality i'd like all of us in this congregation to know today we're not just playing religion here this is a heavenly father who loves every one of us and i say it this way jesus said all that the father hath given me will come you either come hard or you'll come easy but if you're his child you're coming anybody else in the audience wants to repent and come back to the heavenly father today like the prodigal son you come right on he's ready to receive you this morning amen will you pray with me heavenly father i just want to lay my hands on brother tim today and his dear family that's here we have felt you so real in the service today lord your love is is being expressed so much lord we're overwhelmed by it father the love of christ that came in sister janith lord just those last two or three years god it overwhelms us to see what you can do with a life like that the testimony she leaves lord has said such a powerful impact how your love broke through a girl lord it was not loved right no parents to love her right set out to the city oh god and you watched over that little girl lord you your heart was poor lord she didn't know she was the daughter of god she didn't know she was yours until someone spoke the word and she looked to the word and she said i'm a daughter of god i'm so happy today lord and i pray you'll bless this family this dear sister lord has lost her husband i pray father sounds like he was a great great man what a hard thing it was difficult to see these losses lord but yet we know it's heaven's gate we have a hope that we will see them again bless her and encourage her and my mom too and her lord in these lonely times i think they've been we're together 60 years you're not with a person that long and not just have a bond and a union bless her lord in those lonely times encourage her in those times lord brother tim's son and his daughter here this morning in the end be with them lord bless them father take them on to know you in greater ways lord pray father you receive them and bless their family lord i pray in the name of jesus christ i lay my hands on jason this morning lord drawing drawing a son back to you a prodigal back to you lord your arms are outstretched to him this morning like that prodigal son's father he wasn't judgmental he wasn't critical he just said i'm glad to have my son back into my kingdom oh god restore his heart completely back to you i pray in the name of the lord jesus christ any others that are here this morning loan any other prodigals i pray father they know your love is receiving them that your love is embracing them and you've been seeking for them lord and they would receive you in the name of jesus christ we love you this morning you've loved us as a heavenly father you've never stopped loving us you never will lord we feel that love this morning thank you father for your grace in our lives thank you lord heavenly father i appreciate you heavenly father [Music] receiving me [Music] it [Music] heavenly father welcome back [Music] is [Music] true [Music] [Music] his own [Music] no matter [Music] he knows my name
