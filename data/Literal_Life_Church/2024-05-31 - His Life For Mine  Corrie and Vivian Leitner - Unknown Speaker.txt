His Life For Mine

Lyrics:
His heart was broken, mine was mended
He became sin, now I am clean.
The cross he carried bore my burden.
The nails that held him set me free.

His life for mine, his life for mine
How could it ever be?
That he would die, God's son would die
To save a retch like me
What love divine, he gave his life for mine.

His scars of suffering brought me healing
He spilled his blood to fill my soul.
His crown of thorns made me royalty
His sorrow gave me joy untold

His life for mine, his life for mine
How could it ever be?
That he would die, God's son would die
To save a retch like me
What love divine, he gave his life for mine.

He was despised and rejected, stripped of his garments and oppressed
I am loved and accepted and I wear a robe of righteousness

His life for mine, his life for mine
How could it ever be?
That he would die, God's son would die
To save a retch like me
What love divine, he gave his life for mine.
