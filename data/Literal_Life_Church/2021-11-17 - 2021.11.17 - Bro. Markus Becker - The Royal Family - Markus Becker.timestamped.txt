[0:00] thank you very much to the musicians god
[0:02] bless you brothers and sisters
[0:04] um let us read two portions of the
[0:07] scripture
[0:08] in the book of hebrews
[0:10] chapter 2 verse 11 and i would like to
[0:13] title the subject for this evening the
[0:15] royal family
[0:17] and
[0:18] the the verse that i'm reading i would
[0:21] like to take to believe what the bible
[0:23] says it seems to be a little bit
[0:25] spectacular for us
[0:28] it's
[0:28] not ecclesiastical thinking but this is
[0:31] what the bible says you know
[0:33] chapter 2 verse 11.
[0:36] for both i'm speaking about you and me
[0:40] he
[0:41] that sanctifiers that's christ
[0:44] and they who are sanctified that's us
[0:47] are all of one
[0:51] having the same father coming from the
[0:52] same source
[0:55] for which cause he is not ashamed to
[0:57] call them brothers
[1:00] that means a lot that means a lot and
[1:01] let us read in the book of esther
[1:06] esther chapter 2
[1:08] chapter 2 verse
[1:10] 5. and by my accent you understand that
[1:13] you have to take what i want to say not
[1:15] what i'm saying okay
[1:18] verse 5. now in shushan the palace there
[1:21] was a certain jew
[1:23] whose name was mordecai the son of jair
[1:26] the son of shemi the son of kish a
[1:29] benjamite
[1:31] who had been carried away from jerusalem
[1:33] with the
[1:34] cap captivity which had been carried
[1:37] away with joconia king of judah whom
[1:41] nebuchadnezzar
[1:43] the king of babylon had carried away
[1:46] and he brought up hadassah that is
[1:48] esther his uncle's daughter for she had
[1:51] neither neither father
[1:54] nor mother and the mate was fair and
[1:57] beautiful who mordecai when her father
[1:59] and mother were dead
[2:01] took for his own daughter may the lord
[2:03] add his blessing to the reading of his
[2:05] word he may be seated
[2:09] now i'm very very thankful to be here
[2:12] and i think brother paul my good friend
[2:14] my great example to
[2:16] grant me to speak to you my name is
[2:18] marcus becker i come from germany my
[2:20] pastor is pastor brother rhodewald
[2:22] he sends his greetings to all of you
[2:25] especially to our most noble brother
[2:28] i'm here right in the u.s for some days
[2:31] for two weeks and
[2:32] yeah i had a reason to come by
[2:34] i told brother paul we knew us for many
[2:37] many years and we lost a little bit
[2:38] track
[2:39] and um
[2:41] if i could say a
[2:43] great compliment i remember that
[2:46] him to be a good preacher i was his
[2:48] interpreter
[2:50] um
[2:51] blessed services but
[2:53] preaching is a gift but character is
[2:55] something different you know
[2:56] so i remember when we were watching a
[2:58] little bit what's going on at bcf you
[3:00] know when our brother jeff resigned and
[3:03] there was some kind like a
[3:05] vacuum
[3:07] and
[3:08] brother brother paul
[3:11] entered in to preach there
[3:13] and i was impressed i was very very
[3:15] impressed you know not many people will
[3:17] do this you know
[3:18] to step into something that where you
[3:20] can lose nothing where you can gain
[3:22] nothing but lose everything
[3:24] because people surely will misunderstand
[3:26] that you know
[3:27] and i would say that that that that
[3:29] impressed me and i always said when
[3:32] whenever i would meet him i would let
[3:34] him know that that changed that that
[3:36] formed my life in a certain way you know
[3:38] to have that kind of a character
[3:40] and uh i was really blessed but i'm i'm
[3:42] really honored to say this to be part of
[3:44] the family look
[3:46] if somebody is young and he's new he
[3:49] makes a lot of mistakes
[3:51] we have to live but he needs somebody
[3:53] who is standing in the gap
[3:55] because we have a message mentality
[3:56] whenever when somebody makes a big
[3:58] mistakes
[3:59] we try to to to be distant you take it
[4:03] due to to let me say to not to
[4:05] unquestion but then put him out of a
[4:06] brotherhood i always call it the message
[4:09] cold war you know
[4:11] the cold war then we have our democrat
[4:14] you know we have the east and the west
[4:15] and we ignore and we isolate and we put
[4:18] in the circle and we put out of the
[4:20] circle and this is not a
[4:22] very much of a mature attitude
[4:26] young people need they need
[4:28] somebody stand in the gap taking the
[4:30] shame
[4:31] because because and and that i've seen
[4:33] this in brother paul and i thought
[4:35] really brother paul that
[4:37] that
[4:38] how you could say that um
[4:40] it it blessed my life and it it changed
[4:43] my vision
[4:45] a couple of weeks ago i was in peru and
[4:47] there was a church
[4:48] big split because the pastor passed away
[4:51] and a lot of hard feelings and things
[4:54] people say foolish things out of wrong
[4:56] emotions
[4:59] yeah and i'm happy that many things that
[5:02] we said over all these years are under
[5:03] the blood
[5:05] because it was not always the holy
[5:07] spirit speaking to us
[5:09] sometimes it was our frustration
[5:11] speaking to us
[5:13] and and if everybody takes
[5:15] let me say it takes dethinks let me say
[5:17] serious and makes a story and he said
[5:20] and he said
[5:21] i mean
[5:22] we are right but the question today is
[5:24] not is uh who is right
[5:27] the question is we have people
[5:29] we have young people they are watching
[5:31] us we have families we have children
[5:33] they want to see the character behind
[5:35] our preaching
[5:37] so when i went there i knew and and they
[5:39] asked several ministers and they refused
[5:41] to go because this is a situation where
[5:43] you can only lose you know
[5:45] but i told him i said i will come
[5:46] because i have nothing to lose anyhow
[5:48] [Laughter]
[5:50] so so i was and i when i went there i
[5:52] had to think twice but i thought about
[5:53] brother paul i said we have to do
[5:55] sometimes you have to stand in the gap
[5:58] if people understand or do not
[6:00] understand no matter we are brothers we
[6:02] are friends
[6:03] and so i could be over help and so god
[6:05] blessed his influence that is what i was
[6:07] searching brother branham speaks about
[6:08] uzuziah and he said on the other side of
[6:11] the eternity i will tell him
[6:13] you influenced my life
[6:16] exactly so and brother paul i want to
[6:17] say you influenced my life in a very
[6:19] good way so god bless our noble brother
[6:22] i'm a gallant man of god i mean
[6:25] absolutely so and so i'm very happy i
[6:28] always try to when i i always thought by
[6:30] myself if i see him next time i will let
[6:31] him know you know really
[6:33] god bless you so
[6:35] uh i know it's the one so let me go
[6:36] directly into the word of the lord i
[6:38] left all the greetings and all these
[6:40] things i'm really blessed
[6:42] the royal family
[6:44] and
[6:45] let me be myself okay
[6:47] i'm traveling a lot around so i learned
[6:49] how to respect people i learned how to
[6:52] respect cultures
[6:55] the more you the more older you get the
[6:57] more you learn to respect people their
[6:59] mentality their
[7:00] backgrounds sometimes when we first
[7:03] traveled we traveled as germans
[7:07] and germany is a many germs therefore
[7:10] you know there's a lot of problems
[7:11] you're in trouble already when you
[7:13] arrive
[7:14] but uh but
[7:16] we learned really to understand cultures
[7:18] and let people stand the way they are we
[7:20] cannot germanize everybody yeah we want
[7:22] to germatize them with the word of the
[7:24] lord but not germanize them man
[7:27] so so also
[7:29] i hope i can say i can start with a
[7:31] sentence
[7:32] uh not offending you
[7:35] but the message that we believe does not
[7:37] come from america
[7:38] it comes from the presence of our father
[7:42] amen amen it does not come from
[7:44] jefferson but no
[7:46] it is not brother branham's message
[7:48] brother branham was the voice
[7:50] the voice and what we listen is the
[7:52] voice behind the voice
[7:55] the message of the hour is not a
[7:57] doctrine
[7:58] the message of the hour is our father
[8:00] talking to us
[8:03] when we gave our heart to the lord our
[8:05] our attribute
[8:06] god laid laid part of himself into our
[8:09] lives
[8:10] and and it is written in psalm it was
[8:12] said he even laid eternity into our
[8:15] hearts there's only one who is eternal
[8:17] that's god himself
[8:19] so when we answer to the altar called it
[8:21] was not our brain our brain was not fast
[8:23] enough it was the attribute answering to
[8:25] that call
[8:27] so so so so and then brother bram said
[8:30] this bible became a new bible
[8:32] it's not that we should that we should
[8:34] throw the bible away because the prophet
[8:36] said the bible is the book of the year
[8:38] he said it will always be the book of
[8:40] the year till the end
[8:41] so so what is a new bible and we
[8:43] understand that's our story
[8:46] this is our book that's our
[8:47] identification
[8:49] and and here we have that little girl by
[8:51] the name of esther by the way i want to
[8:53] greet the family of brother paul the
[8:55] boys that i met over there in brother
[8:57] ron peterson
[8:58] have very good memories still
[9:01] so esther
[9:02] uh the story starts with
[9:06] a king
[9:08] who had a had a wife was not very much
[9:11] obedient
[9:12] and the king
[9:15] the princes around the king he gave him
[9:17] a principle he said look if your wife is
[9:20] not obedient to your command all of our
[9:22] wives will
[9:23] do whatever they want
[9:26] they understood that we are examples
[9:30] do we understand that we are an example
[9:31] for our children
[9:33] for the people they watch us they
[9:34] observe us and we have a young
[9:36] generation especially preachers kids
[9:38] they they can detect
[9:40] uh they can even see body languages
[9:43] they can detect tensions you try to to
[9:45] to to
[9:47] to to smile and to smile things away but
[9:49] they can detect already some vibes
[9:51] so it's so important that that we for
[9:53] all problems that we have that we find
[9:55] solutions
[9:57] if not it is a powerless church they
[9:59] have just a doctrine or some pictures of
[10:01] brother brandon but we need solutions to
[10:03] go on you know
[10:05] so so we see that that this little girl
[10:08] esther
[10:11] her life story starts with two names
[10:14] one is esther which means
[10:17] star
[10:18] the other one is hadassah
[10:22] some translations say bright other
[10:24] translations say mer
[10:27] and you have to understand that we have
[10:29] two names
[10:31] amen on one hand side you are just an
[10:34] american
[10:36] or the other inside on the inner man you
[10:38] come from god
[10:41] brother royal family is a privilege
[10:44] nobody can preach you in
[10:46] and nobody can preach you out of this
[10:49] no sir
[10:50] amen therefore this message that we
[10:52] believe is not a cult
[10:54] and a cult uh as long as you're a good
[10:56] brother people come to you and say oh
[10:58] it's our brother from before before the
[11:00] foundation of the world and we were
[11:02] eager and somehow you left and from that
[11:04] moment and the same people would say
[11:05] okay he left us because he was never
[11:07] part of us
[11:08] so you come back and you repent oh our
[11:11] brother from eternity we know us already
[11:13] and okay who who wants to believe this
[11:16] if somebody is a brother he's a brother
[11:19] even if he's in spiritual amnesia but if
[11:21] he's a brother he's a brother
[11:23] if somebody's an eagle he's an eagle
[11:25] sometimes he forgets what he is but he
[11:26] still is what he is
[11:28] amen
[11:29] therefore this message is not a cult
[11:32] amen and and and and you are just a
[11:36] simple man uh over there in the u.s i'm
[11:39] just a simple brother from from germany
[11:41] i tell you one thing i'm a very very
[11:44] sympathetic man
[11:46] if you only would knew me
[11:48] because i i i this is now marcus this is
[11:51] my vision brother bram speaks about the
[11:53] tent vision and people say where is the
[11:55] tent
[11:56] is it in
[11:57] costa rica is it in germany is it in the
[12:00] u.s
[12:01] i said maybe this is my own
[12:02] interpretation of it and you don't have
[12:04] to accept it but i believe the bride is
[12:06] the tent
[12:08] because because we live in a tent if
[12:10] this earthly tabernacle
[12:13] will in that tabernacle is nothing else
[12:15] in a tent if this earthly tabernacle
[12:18] will be dissolved we have a building
[12:19] from god which is eternal
[12:23] and then paul continues in romans he
[12:25] said we're now living in a tent
[12:28] in a tabernacle
[12:30] remember the vision that that moses who
[12:32] was the first one having a tent vision
[12:34] that was moses
[12:36] going up and when he came down he built
[12:38] up the tabernacle according the vision
[12:40] that he saw and this was brother brandon
[12:42] revealing that his body soul and spirits
[12:45] and brother ben even said the curtain
[12:47] between the only supporters in the whole
[12:49] and in that place is our self-will the
[12:52] the the temple in jerusalem is a shadow
[12:55] on a human being
[12:58] and we're living in it this is no marcus
[13:00] we live in it for 70 80 years
[13:04] and then we go to our real death in our
[13:07] true body
[13:08] therefore i said i'm a very very
[13:10] sympathetic man but i'm just living in a
[13:12] german tent
[13:14] for 70 80 years standing in my own way
[13:17] having my complexes having my genes
[13:20] having having my story having my
[13:21] childhood
[13:23] but in me
[13:25] there is something of god
[13:27] and in you exactly the same thing
[13:30] so so
[13:31] that question of our esther who comes
[13:34] into view
[13:36] she is
[13:37] she she
[13:38] she is a she is a she does not have a
[13:41] father and doesn't have a mother
[13:43] she is part of the jewish group taken
[13:46] away in captivity captivity
[13:49] so our great king ahaz varus he is king
[13:53] over 127 countries
[13:58] now he wants to marry again and we are
[14:00] not preaching this evening about
[14:02] marriage in divorce no centimeter
[14:05] okay i wouldn't dare to do it behind
[14:06] another pulpit but we speak about a
[14:08] spiritual
[14:10] application nothing else okay please
[14:12] don't
[14:13] misinterpret it
[14:15] so he's searching now for a new wife
[14:19] a girl that he can marry
[14:21] and
[14:23] she is that woman is a nice girl
[14:26] but she has a special qualifications the
[14:29] bible makes it very sure
[14:32] she has no father
[14:34] and she has no mother
[14:36] now that reminds us to melchizedek
[14:40] a man who had no father
[14:42] and got no mother remember he who
[14:45] sanctifies
[14:46] and he who's who is sanctified
[14:49] comes of one
[14:51] the same family
[14:53] so so let us see a little bit her
[14:55] background and i would ask uh the
[14:56] brothers and sisters to to to to just
[14:59] i'm a german but when it comes to
[15:01] technique i get a little bit nervous can
[15:03] you just put some of the slides yeah
[15:06] and i will tell you in some kind like a
[15:08] story because
[15:10] this is now the time of the roman empire
[15:14] we are in the fourth century
[15:17] and we have uh an eastern part in the
[15:19] western part
[15:21] uh this is now 300 around
[15:25] after christ
[15:27] in the roman empire we have different
[15:30] caesars emperors
[15:33] now in human nature
[15:38] many if somebody is a human leader he
[15:40] cannot
[15:41] see
[15:42] somebody besides him
[15:45] okay so
[15:47] we cannot have two caesars
[15:49] uh we cannot have two emperors so on one
[15:52] day we have our most noble friend by the
[15:54] name of constantine
[15:57] who decided now go into war with the
[16:01] other caesar to find out
[16:04] if we are two
[16:05] is one too much
[16:07] okay
[16:08] this is tombstone
[16:11] this is billy the kid against against
[16:13] the daltons so
[16:16] this saloon only needs one
[16:20] okay this is human nature
[16:23] brother brahm said if you have a gift
[16:24] watch
[16:25] what you will do with the gift
[16:28] will you help your brothers
[16:30] or would you pull them down
[16:32] would you make a name for themselves for
[16:34] yourself like like nimrod or will you
[16:36] help your brothers
[16:37] to come into their position
[16:40] but human nature brother i tell you is
[16:42] is selfish nature
[16:45] i mean
[16:46] can you go please go back again brother
[16:48] so we see that now war starts
[16:52] and uh what happens is
[16:55] god is in control because he wanted to
[16:58] propagate christianity over the roman
[17:01] empire
[17:02] at that time it is god's plan
[17:05] what happens is that
[17:07] right before the night or the day
[17:10] there's different legions about it
[17:12] we see that constantine he sees a light
[17:16] over the sun
[17:17] and a cross
[17:20] and he hears these noble words in hick
[17:23] in hawk signo vince's that means you
[17:25] will win with this sign
[17:29] so
[17:30] he believes in a god that he that he
[17:32] doesn't know and
[17:34] his group will have now a sign of a
[17:38] cross
[17:39] on their shields and he's fighting
[17:42] on the milivian bridge in rome against
[17:45] marcenzius
[17:47] and constantine wins the wins the battle
[17:51] and from now on constantine he is the
[17:55] leader over the whole roman empire
[17:59] that question is settled
[18:01] at the same time we have
[18:04] different opinions in the church
[18:07] great opinions because
[18:10] we have different schools of churches in
[18:12] the eastern part
[18:15] and in the western part
[18:17] the question is this
[18:19] is
[18:20] jesus created
[18:23] or is he part of god
[18:26] that is not a problem for them as long
[18:29] as there are two different emperors but
[18:31] now it becomes into one state
[18:35] and this question have to be solved
[18:38] in other
[18:39] that means uh let me read it like this
[18:41] one purpose of the that is wikipedia one
[18:44] purpose of the council was to resolve
[18:47] disagreements arising from within the
[18:50] church of alexandria
[18:52] over the nature of jesus in his
[18:54] relationship to the father
[18:56] in particular whether the son had been
[18:58] begotten by the father from his own
[19:01] being and therefore having no beginning
[19:04] or else created out of nothing or
[19:06] therefore having a beginning so we have
[19:09] two big schools and they are one against
[19:12] the other
[19:13] one is arias one is okay
[19:16] the question is clear
[19:18] constantine was an unbeliever
[19:22] he wants to make deals
[19:24] i mean tremendous something like this
[19:27] unbelievable
[19:29] i mean he wants to make deals
[19:32] and maxenzios he's a loser
[19:35] he's a total disaster you know something
[19:37] like this so what happens he makes a
[19:40] deal because he understands
[19:42] the god that i don't know is very very
[19:45] strong because i saw the vision
[19:48] but i don't understand the doctrine
[19:50] so we now have to make this as a state
[19:53] religion
[19:55] but you cannot have a state religion if
[19:58] the religious leaders don't understand
[20:00] their own doctrine
[20:03] you understand
[20:05] he brought them together on the council
[20:07] of nicaea to say look brother i'm not
[20:10] interested in the solution because i'm
[20:12] not believing anyhow but when we come
[20:14] out of this
[20:16] we have one doctrine okay
[20:19] it's true because he wanted to make a
[20:21] deal
[20:22] he now wants to make this god they call
[20:25] it christian christian christianos
[20:28] christians
[20:29] but i cannot make it state religion when
[20:32] they don't know their own doctrine
[20:34] so first we come together
[20:36] you make you make a deal you make an
[20:38] agreement no matter what i believe
[20:41] everything because he was a believer any
[20:43] he wasn't a believer anyhow
[20:45] and they found out
[20:47] that
[20:48] they believed in jesus to be part of god
[20:52] not just
[20:53] somebody who was created like an angel
[20:56] but part of god this was the birth of
[20:58] the trinity
[21:00] idea now i will not go into it certainly
[21:03] it's not my place on the wednesday
[21:04] because i'd like to like to tell a story
[21:06] about esther but brother brandon makes
[21:08] sure jesus was completely god and
[21:10] completely man
[21:12] that
[21:13] that's what he says
[21:14] but it is an important question
[21:17] they call it a question of being homo
[21:20] homo uzios of one substance
[21:24] so
[21:25] there is a big difference
[21:28] between something which is created and
[21:30] something which is burst
[21:32] now if i'm creating something i'm
[21:35] building something up
[21:38] but if i'm birthing something that means
[21:40] part of me is in this i created many
[21:45] things
[21:46] but i burst only one daughter
[21:49] and the difference between the things i
[21:51] created in the birth part of me is in my
[21:53] daughter my own genes
[21:56] she is not just created she's she's
[21:58] begotten
[22:00] part of me is in her
[22:02] that's the difference between a birth
[22:04] and just a membership
[22:06] it's a big difference
[22:08] once your birth part of god is in you
[22:11] blessed be the name of the lord so we
[22:13] see this and please make the next one it
[22:16] was an essential question of that time
[22:19] and brother branham says and that is
[22:21] what constantine and his successes did
[22:24] at nicaea and after nicea they invented
[22:27] the people of god to the convention and
[22:29] when the church sat down and eat and
[22:31] rose up to play partaking of church from
[22:34] ceremonies pagan fees named after
[22:36] christian rights she was trapped she had
[22:39] a committed fornication and god walked
[22:41] out brother brain said the true
[22:43] believers should not have gone there
[22:45] and he he parallels it with with with
[22:48] the more bites
[22:50] they said we are all one but brother we
[22:52] are not all one we are not all one we
[22:55] are
[22:55] this message was not based on william
[22:58] branham
[22:59] this message is was based on the pillar
[23:01] of fire
[23:02] that's a difference okay
[23:04] so we see it was a very important
[23:07] question and now the question is now
[23:09] where is the bride in it
[23:11] and let's have let's see it brother
[23:13] for the next one okay
[23:15] so
[23:16] here's what brother brahma said so he
[23:18] first was god jehovah
[23:20] and out of him let's just picture now as
[23:24] a little drama so you can get us
[23:26] let's see come out of space there was
[23:29] nothing let's make a little white light
[23:31] like a mystic light like a halo
[23:34] and that was the logos that went out of
[23:36] god in the beginning
[23:38] that was the son of god that came out of
[23:40] the bosom of the father that was what
[23:42] was in the beginning was the word and
[23:44] the word was with god and the word was
[23:46] god and the word was made flesh and
[23:48] dwelt among us in the beginning was god
[23:50] and then out of god came the logos a
[23:53] part of god that went out of god
[23:57] you remember that brother brahms said
[23:58] the first thing that i see is
[24:01] a little white light
[24:03] and he calls it like a child playing in
[24:05] the in in in the garden but then brother
[24:07] bram said this and i was puzzled over it
[24:09] he said the first thing that god created
[24:11] was angels another quote
[24:14] how to bring it together sure he created
[24:17] angels
[24:18] creation
[24:20] but that logos was not created
[24:23] it came out of him
[24:26] do you understand that we don't have two
[24:27] gods
[24:29] it's one person
[24:31] amen because that logos came out of him
[24:34] it was not created like the angels it
[24:37] was part of him
[24:39] now we learned through the message of
[24:41] the hour and here you see the royal
[24:42] family and
[24:44] remember this is what just one service
[24:46] please know there's much more to say and
[24:48] i don't know if i have all the balance
[24:50] in it but it's not a question for this
[24:51] evening
[24:53] but
[24:54] brother brahm taught us
[24:56] the bride was in christ even on
[24:58] calvary as eve was in adam
[25:03] in what form ever but she's part of him
[25:06] we were reading it in in in hebrew
[25:09] but if the bride was in christ and
[25:12] christ was melchizedek before then the
[25:15] bride must have been in him too
[25:19] i don't speak about the church the bride
[25:22] i mean part eve part of adam
[25:26] they call it the family of god
[25:29] so if the bride was in melchizedek
[25:31] i mean in some form in his thoughts
[25:33] whatever
[25:35] be sure she must have been in the logos
[25:39] because mercedes came out of that logos
[25:42] amen
[25:43] so if she was in that logos she must
[25:46] have been on god
[25:50] nobody can preach you into it
[25:52] therefore brother blame said if you have
[25:53] eternal life you always hear this
[25:56] but there will be people that will get
[25:58] eternal life that's true they will be
[26:01] safe not
[26:02] even at the white stone judgment but
[26:04] here we speak about a family a royal
[26:06] family
[26:07] that's different
[26:09] i'm a royal family
[26:11] so so
[26:12] in whatever form i cannot tell you but
[26:15] here is a picture amen next one please
[26:18] here's what brother bram said the
[26:20] eternal thoughts of god let me ask you
[26:23] are the thoughts of god eternal
[26:25] if you can see this you will see many
[26:28] things
[26:29] god is unchangeable both essence and
[26:31] behavior we have studied that and proven
[26:33] that already god is infinite in his
[26:35] abilities so therefore he is god
[26:38] must be omniscient if he is omniscient
[26:40] then he is not now learning nor is he
[26:43] taking counsel even with himself nor is
[26:47] he at any time adding to his knowledge
[26:49] if he can add to his knowledge then he's
[26:51] not omniscient
[26:52] the best way we could say is that
[26:54] sometimes he will be but this is not
[26:56] spirit scriptural
[26:58] he is omniscient he has never had a new
[27:00] thought about anything because all his
[27:02] thoughts he has always had and always
[27:05] will have
[27:06] and knows the end from the beginning
[27:08] because he's god
[27:09] and now now you're coming in thus the
[27:12] thoughts of god are eternal
[27:15] they are real
[27:17] and here's the difference between our
[27:19] thoughts our thoughts we think about
[27:22] things
[27:23] but his thought is substance
[27:27] they are real they are not simply like a
[27:30] man with a blueprint
[27:32] he has drawn up which one day will be
[27:35] translated into substance and form but
[27:38] they are already real and eternal and
[27:42] part of gods
[27:46] so when we say we were in the mind of
[27:48] god it was not just god was just
[27:50] thinking about us
[27:52] we were part of him
[27:54] part of his being
[27:56] blessed be i don't know who else was in
[27:59] that thought but we're just speaking
[28:00] about the bride you understand esther
[28:03] she had no father and she had no mother
[28:07] bless blessed be the long
[28:09] so one thing is sure
[28:11] and i i always like to make that little
[28:14] demonstration that that brother beckett
[28:16] was making with some years ago this is
[28:18] just a demonstration it's not a doctrine
[28:20] just a demonstration to make things
[28:22] tangible
[28:24] now god before the foundation he made a
[28:26] picture of his family
[28:28] and here we were
[28:31] i mean therefore we are not arrogant
[28:35] but we are proud of our father
[28:38] we are proud who we are not arrogant but
[28:40] proud who we are
[28:41] amen so god took our souls
[28:45] and throwed it
[28:47] in seven church ages on seven countries
[28:50] some in america some in germany some in
[28:52] luther's time some in wesley some in
[28:54] paul some some in our time and god knows
[28:56] one thing my sheep will hear my voice
[29:00] i will i place the receiver in their
[29:02] hearts
[29:03] amen and and god knows one thing
[29:06] when time is over
[29:09] the whole fa the family will be back
[29:11] together
[29:13] and brother branham explains it
[29:15] brother blame said this and and the
[29:18] prophet was the first one
[29:20] who said in the time in the days of the
[29:22] voice of the seventh angel the mystery
[29:25] of god
[29:27] not mysteries
[29:29] scofield already revealed mysteries
[29:32] but there were big mysteries
[29:34] i mean the mystery brother brain was the
[29:36] first man
[29:38] ever on this earth who said without you
[29:40] god is not complete anymore
[29:44] amen
[29:45] yet we were in his mind we could not
[29:47] have fellowship we should have been
[29:49] expressed but we were already part of
[29:51] him
[29:54] as my daughter was always in me
[29:56] she was not created she needed her time
[29:58] to be expressed
[30:00] so we wanted to come directly in our in
[30:03] our theophany
[30:05] amen and we landed in ohio
[30:10] and we came into families god never
[30:12] asked us do you want to be bro do you
[30:14] want to be male or female
[30:16] you want to be american or german
[30:20] amen god never asked us do you want to
[30:22] be black or white
[30:25] sometimes we came into families that we
[30:27] were not choosing
[30:29] um i came from a family which was
[30:31] divorced
[30:32] and i hated myself in that situation but
[30:35] god there's a quote that brother blame
[30:36] said he said god planned our birth for
[30:39] many generations
[30:41] [Applause]
[30:42] god did not only knew that we were that
[30:44] will come he plans our coming
[30:49] so in second world war all these hitler
[30:51] boys could not kill your father or your
[30:54] grandfather
[30:55] because you must have been expressed
[30:58] so you could just send them right into
[31:00] this secret line all these hitler boys
[31:02] come but god had to protect your father
[31:04] because he knew you had to come
[31:08] blessed be the name of the lord
[31:10] and if god planned my birth surely god
[31:12] planned my death
[31:15] therefore he came to maryland monroe and
[31:17] said there's a young girl she will dying
[31:19] at this in this minute god knows the
[31:21] minute when we will die
[31:23] when we are born god knows already this
[31:25] is the end of his life
[31:27] what what what a thing how we are in the
[31:29] hands of the lord
[31:30] can you say amen
[31:33] that's very special nobody can preach
[31:35] you into the family
[31:37] and nobody can put you out
[31:39] when we were younger we would like to
[31:41] bring we give people if we have problems
[31:43] with people we like to to to give them
[31:45] over to satan
[31:47] because we did not have any remedy we
[31:49] didn't have a solution so it was easy to
[31:51] just unchristianize him it was the most
[31:53] easy way for
[31:55] unmatured people to to just say this is
[31:57] not a real brother so because
[31:59] today we learned we have to give them
[32:01] into god's hands
[32:03] he said heavenly father my my brother is
[32:05] as law as wrong as he can be but i
[32:07] believe it's my brother
[32:09] so so you had a lot of patience with me
[32:11] lord have patience with my brother
[32:14] amen can you say amen so so when in
[32:17] south america something they are very
[32:19] they are much much more of guerrero
[32:21] fighters so one comes to the other and
[32:24] he says now now i will send you over to
[32:27] hell i said if he comes next time you
[32:29] say you cannot send me to hell because
[32:31] you didn't pay my price
[32:35] amen you didn't pay my price you will
[32:36] send me nowhere
[32:37] i have a father
[32:39] can you say amen
[32:41] next one please i mean
[32:43] i mean so therefore we we came on this
[32:47] earth
[32:48] and we came into a body that we didn't
[32:51] like
[32:53] i mean when we were teenagers we hated
[32:55] ourselves i mean you remember the
[32:58] freckles
[32:59] i still remember that the preaching
[33:00] about the freckles i hated my freckles
[33:04] my i see now my daughter hates the
[33:05] freckles
[33:06] i learned from you brother paul i tell
[33:08] you honey you will get a husband who
[33:10] loves your freckles one day
[33:12] exactly so but we hated us
[33:15] i mean do you know one thing brother
[33:18] most of our problem is we're staying in
[33:20] our own way
[33:22] and and brother blame himself he says
[33:23] i'm a melancholic
[33:26] and and even in the message uh on the
[33:29] wings of a snow white dove i mean that
[33:31] is 1965 he said all my life i was a
[33:34] neurotic
[33:35] so we thought as pentecostals the holy
[33:37] ghost come and everything itself is not
[33:41] it's not because we still have own our
[33:43] human nature
[33:44] but we have enough grace and enough
[33:46] power to bring that human nature under
[33:48] his control
[33:50] but it's there
[33:51] it's there brother bram said i'm a nor
[33:53] and here is 1963 he brother bran
[33:56] received the holy ghost
[33:59] it was another question of the new birth
[34:01] that that is where we outmade our
[34:03] mistakes
[34:04] we
[34:05] we come in the flesh and then we ask
[34:06] ourselves if we were born again so
[34:08] another prayer line
[34:10] another prayer line another laying on
[34:12] our hands
[34:13] i said brother you can go so much in
[34:14] prayer lines that at the end you don't
[34:16] know if you are saved or not
[34:18] more prayer lines and more doubts come
[34:20] on
[34:20] amen
[34:22] you have to make a star but from there
[34:23] you have to grow and you have to
[34:25] understand you have still that nature
[34:27] it's a process
[34:29] a person says yeah there's prayer and i
[34:31] was great i'm i i do prayers myself
[34:33] that's fine but the main thing is is is
[34:36] a process
[34:38] people sometimes think a minister comes
[34:40] like santa claus
[34:42] and and preaches things it cannot be
[34:44] because growth comes by god
[34:47] show me the prayer line for rapturing
[34:48] face it will not be
[34:50] rapturing faces in the word
[34:52] so if this answers in the word all my
[34:54] answers are in the word
[34:56] if young people need a prayer line let's
[34:57] go on but don't make it make a tradition
[35:00] of if if i wasn't at the altar it wasn't
[35:03] spiritual no take take your blessing
[35:06] wherever you are
[35:08] let's bless it be the name on here of
[35:10] the prophet look look look and he comes
[35:12] in the flesh and he says i build up a
[35:15] because he listened to people
[35:18] brother has two things for ministers
[35:20] that is difficult and if the younger you
[35:22] are the more you are affected to it
[35:25] the first thing is eat perpetual critics
[35:28] because this discourages you
[35:31] but the other thing is perpetual
[35:32] applause
[35:35] we need a balance in both things
[35:37] we need it but we need the critics
[35:40] and we need the applause but everything
[35:42] which is out of balance brings us out of
[35:43] balance
[35:45] can you say amen
[35:48] blessed be the name of the lord so so
[35:50] here he comes he listens to to these
[35:53] voices now i always tell the young
[35:54] people i said you are wednesday for
[35:56] example and we don't feel well we have a
[35:58] little cuff like
[36:01] and then we hear a voice not today you
[36:02] cannot go to church
[36:04] no no but you you will bring a pandemia
[36:07] over the whole church no you have to
[36:08] sleep
[36:10] have you ever heard that voice
[36:12] can you say amen
[36:14] so in other words that voice speaks
[36:15] german and english
[36:18] because i hear it in german you hear it
[36:19] in english
[36:21] and and i always say this if satan tells
[36:24] you not to come to church you tell him
[36:25] no you stay at home
[36:28] amen
[36:30] amen you say no you stay at home
[36:33] blessed be blessed be the name of the
[36:34] lord but we come into the flesh and once
[36:37] you meant to come into the flesh don't
[36:40] doubt your salvation
[36:42] don't don't doubt your family
[36:45] but come back and know the potential
[36:47] lays in me
[36:49] and let god again touch that eternal
[36:52] pardon you and you're coming back on
[36:54] track
[36:54] so whenever god came and and the prophet
[36:57] had his wings moved it's a
[37:00] swing moves
[37:02] okay he was a melancholic so god always
[37:05] brought him up on a higher level
[37:07] amen amen here he comes in another
[37:09] dimension will it help you to see the
[37:11] other dimension yes amen
[37:13] here he has again he is down and
[37:16] somebody comes in clifton cafeterias he
[37:18] said because thou has chosen brother
[37:21] brain said i'm i'm never the same
[37:22] william branham again and two years
[37:24] later he preaches the present stage of
[37:25] my ministry he's completely depressed
[37:28] that's how he goes sometimes we forget
[37:30] who we are
[37:31] and then god comes and reminds us who we
[37:33] are
[37:36] brother i'm i'm dealing some time with
[37:37] people with with with some kind like
[37:39] like like uh hell mental health issues
[37:43] and and it will occur more and more in
[37:45] our church because this is a very
[37:46] difficult time to live
[37:48] and one of the sisters she gave me a
[37:50] great compliment she said brother marcus
[37:52] one thing is so my psyche is not my
[37:55] faith
[37:56] my face is here my psyche is here
[37:59] um if you're a menopause your psyche is
[38:01] upside down but your face always holds
[38:04] you don't feel it but god doesn't go
[38:06] after feeling god goes after his his
[38:08] eternal plan
[38:10] can you say amen
[38:12] blessed be the name of the lord so so so
[38:14] so so god says to brother ben look to
[38:16] the right
[38:17] this is your life i ask you the question
[38:20] when did these
[38:22] mountains appear
[38:24] 1963
[38:27] when god
[38:29] created the earth
[38:30] he made already that ridge of mountains
[38:33] knowing that in millions of years i have
[38:35] a seventh angel
[38:37] he will be a melancholic
[38:39] so we are he he was already portraying
[38:42] his life
[38:44] right when he created the earth don't
[38:46] you think that god knows about
[38:48] everything about us
[38:50] and we we start in our prayer line um
[38:53] heavenly father you know and you know
[38:54] and god says i know
[38:58] i'm ben you know you know you know my
[39:00] life and you know and god says i know
[39:03] amen
[39:04] so so so he was building up he was
[39:07] showing the end from the beginning i
[39:09] always say this
[39:10] now
[39:11] the voice says to brother branham this
[39:13] is
[39:14] your life
[39:16] and i want to tell to you
[39:18] this
[39:19] is
[39:20] your life
[39:24] so brother if you are under on the
[39:25] mountaintop don't become arrogant oh
[39:29] if i see this family and their children
[39:31] i
[39:32] they should only believe they should
[39:34] only believe and god says okay i will
[39:35] bring the same thing to you
[39:37] and then if you're on the mountaintop
[39:39] never forget that the next valley will
[39:41] come
[39:42] there's no reason to be arrogant because
[39:44] we are not having now a good time but
[39:46] one thing is sure if you end the valley
[39:48] don't give up
[39:50] if in the valley never give up because
[39:52] one thing is sure the next mountaintop
[39:54] comes
[39:57] can you say amen
[39:59] but it doesn't come by nice
[40:01] bible slogans
[40:04] it comes by an understanding from where
[40:05] we come from
[40:07] we come from the mind of god
[40:09] and nobody will stop us
[40:11] even we will not stop ourselves
[40:14] we will pay for our nonsense
[40:17] but it will not throw us out of the
[40:19] family of god
[40:21] i talk about the bride okay this would
[40:24] be the name of the lord can you say amen
[40:27] so so therefore the the voice says to
[40:30] brother brahm he god understands people
[40:34] god understands human being and i i
[40:36] repeated what i'm doing from time to
[40:38] time
[40:39] a young boy he wanted to to buy some
[40:41] dogs okay
[40:43] and he goes and he sees
[40:45] one handicapped dog and the owner of the
[40:47] dogs he comes down the staircase and he
[40:50] says why do you want to have that dog i
[40:51] mean he's handicapped he cannot walk
[40:54] like the rest he cannot and the boy
[40:56] is putting up his trousers
[40:59] and from his knee down he has a protest
[41:02] an artificial leg
[41:04] and the boy says this i want to have
[41:05] this dog because when we go out i
[41:07] understand him and he understands me
[41:10] and brother branham quote brother
[41:12] branham god became man to understand man
[41:16] quote brother branham but god became
[41:18] teenager to understand teenagers
[41:21] that's our father
[41:23] so when you pray even you you you pray
[41:25] about immoral thoughts
[41:28] god knows what you talk about it
[41:31] i mean he understands that we are human
[41:33] beings can you say amen
[41:35] that makes our message so sympathetic
[41:39] that makes the gospel the good news
[41:42] that brings relationship this message is
[41:44] not a doctrine this message is a
[41:46] relationship
[41:48] to our father
[41:50] because we come from the same family but
[41:52] we did not know who we were
[41:54] until we heard a voice
[41:56] we came to the lord and we were just uh
[41:59] somebody brought us under conviction and
[42:01] you're this and you're this and you
[42:02] listen christ died for me yes
[42:04] and we have to start like this but you
[42:06] cannot live your whole christian life
[42:07] under convictions
[42:09] once you must find out i'm a son of god
[42:11] i was trapped into the things of this
[42:14] world
[42:15] but the judge is my attorney
[42:18] can you say amen
[42:19] and brother i tell you this if somebody
[42:21] believes this from all his heart he will
[42:23] not become a worldly person
[42:25] no he will not he will do everything to
[42:27] serve the lord
[42:28] because he understands who he is
[42:31] blessed be the name of the lord make the
[42:32] next one
[42:33] amen this is the last one before yes
[42:36] this is the nice again therefore
[42:38] i showed you in the bible in the message
[42:40] of the hour
[42:42] we do not live by slogans
[42:45] have you ever heard when the young
[42:46] people that come out brother marcus
[42:48] we were in the convention i tell you
[42:50] brother that was deep
[42:52] and we never heard it that way i always
[42:54] say yeah yeah you never heard it that
[42:55] way because the prophet never said it
[42:57] that way therefore you never heard it
[42:59] that way okay
[43:01] but brother mike that was that was how
[43:03] do you say tremendous
[43:05] it was unbelievable
[43:08] fine
[43:09] then i said to the young person what did
[43:10] you get what did you understand nothing
[43:13] nothing okay if nothing i mean what is
[43:15] tremendous about nothing
[43:18] amen then then i say to him total
[43:20] disaster
[43:22] amen
[43:23] because you must we are not here to
[43:25] impress people
[43:27] we are here to help people
[43:29] to find their position in christ
[43:32] to find a relationship i don't
[43:33] understand all the doctrine of william
[43:35] brennan but i have a father
[43:37] what is your doctrine i have a father
[43:42] he called me his own
[43:45] long before even time began do we
[43:50] believe that my life
[43:53] in
[43:54] his hands
[43:56] so you see by the point you're not the
[43:57] only one who can sing
[43:59] [Laughter]
[44:02] so look this is a picture
[44:04] of of this is an unbeliever
[44:06] this is just uh how you call it uh
[44:10] a filmer of animals
[44:15] i think it's on youtube or whatever but
[44:17] a boy gave it to me
[44:19] this is an eagle and a crow national
[44:22] geographic some of these film of
[44:24] national geographic so
[44:26] the the eagle
[44:28] uh he had a crow sitting on his back and
[44:31] that crow was
[44:34] attacking the eagle right
[44:36] on the neck
[44:38] and this is the report of the unbeliever
[44:41] he knows nothing about the message and
[44:42] eagles and so forth and he said this
[44:44] the eagle when he recognized there's an
[44:47] enemy right on his back he did nothing
[44:50] and the crow was just picking on the
[44:51] head
[44:52] but at a certain moment the eagle just
[44:54] started to rise
[44:57] goes up and up and up and up and the
[44:59] eagle knows one thing
[45:01] hey friend
[45:03] you better go
[45:05] or you explode
[45:07] you see
[45:08] he does he does not fight the enemy he
[45:10] just goes up in another dimension
[45:13] they say amen
[45:15] and he said okay sports friends okay you
[45:17] can try but
[45:19] are you still there
[45:22] [Applause]
[45:25] brother we have something
[45:26] this message gives us a vision
[45:30] this message is not law and order
[45:32] this message comes from our father
[45:35] this message shows who we are really
[45:38] this message makes makes us to stand up
[45:41] harley i always love that picture
[45:43] sometimes sometimes we are boxers and we
[45:45] and we get it
[45:47] and then and then you click
[45:51] one two three four five and we're just
[45:56] six
[45:59] seven
[46:00] eight
[46:01] nine
[46:02] ten and we're coming back
[46:04] brother to fall
[46:06] is human to stand up as godly
[46:10] you will find out if you're family of
[46:11] god there's something in you that stands
[46:13] up
[46:14] it is not your capacity is god in you
[46:17] standing up
[46:18] blessed be the name of the lord
[46:20] once you find out who you are you can
[46:22] have patience with others
[46:24] you can even have patience with
[46:25] unbelievers because you say if god
[46:27] doesn't reveal what can the person do
[46:29] about that
[46:30] we understand we live by god's grace
[46:34] and we understand even growth is god's
[46:36] grace
[46:36] so we can we understand we have to have
[46:39] patience with the family of god because
[46:40] god has much patience with us
[46:43] we're not judgmental anymore
[46:45] it's not that we don't call sin sin
[46:46] that's fine but but we are not
[46:49] judgmental about brothers sisters we
[46:52] just say lord have a way for them
[46:54] so that is the background for our sister
[46:56] esther thank you very much for the
[46:57] technicians
[46:59] so what happens is this
[47:02] and i'm finishing by that by the little
[47:03] drama
[47:05] so we cannot read the bible
[47:08] in a western in a western understanding
[47:12] but this king he was inviting all these
[47:15] girls for one night
[47:17] into his room
[47:19] what happened was clear they played card
[47:22] okay
[47:23] exactly so
[47:25] so this was for the for the for the for
[47:26] the teenagers and 40 okay
[47:29] right
[47:30] so when the night was over of playing
[47:33] memory
[47:36] he was just sending the girl away
[47:39] and he was just asking her if he wants
[47:41] to play memory again
[47:43] so he had a full a full house
[47:46] of girls
[47:48] and esther she was made ready and she
[47:51] came under the care
[47:53] of a great servant
[47:56] it is always a main servant introducing
[47:59] the bride to the bridegroom
[48:02] remember the story of ruth
[48:03] and boaz came who is that girl it was
[48:05] the servant explaining who the girl is
[48:07] remember eliezer presenting the bride to
[48:10] isaac
[48:11] it's always it's always a servant
[48:14] presenting the bridegroom to the bride
[48:17] and she came under the care of the main
[48:20] servant
[48:22] and she asked nothing now one thing it
[48:24] was clear all these girls knew one thing
[48:26] that king
[48:28] he will marry one of us our girls one of
[48:30] us girls
[48:32] so they tried to make a
[48:35] individual feature
[48:37] uh special earrings special deals
[48:40] special so that the king will remind
[48:42] them so that they might become the right
[48:46] but esther did not ask for nothing
[48:49] only what hey guy told her
[48:52] now esther was a wise girl
[48:54] because she understood one thing if
[48:56] somebody knows the taste of the king
[48:58] then it's higa
[49:01] and we have to understand that brother
[49:03] there was nobody living as close
[49:06] to the king as our prophet
[49:10] and you say amen
[49:11] none of the prophets
[49:13] could live could see as as far as
[49:16] william branham
[49:17] moses could just see in the beginning
[49:20] john could say in the beginning was but
[49:22] this prophet brought us before the
[49:24] beginning
[49:25] a little white light comes out of him
[49:28] blessed be the name of the lord that
[49:30] means he he knew higa knew the taste
[49:35] amen
[49:36] amen and brother branham knew the taste
[49:39] of christ for our age
[49:42] so it's good to take him as an example
[49:46] and whatever
[49:48] you honor god by many things
[49:51] i remember i know this is wednesday just
[49:53] just let me let me let me but by many
[49:56] things we honor god so many things how
[49:59] brother branham handled things
[50:00] especially in the church look how he
[50:02] went when he goes to hunt
[50:03] look how he goes to church
[50:05] it wasn't it was a reflection of he felt
[50:09] that would that would be pleasing unto
[50:11] god
[50:12] so i can take him as an example without
[50:15] idolizing the men
[50:16] but what happened is
[50:18] that she was under his care
[50:21] and the bible says this esther was taken
[50:24] unto king ahasberos
[50:27] into his royal
[50:29] in the 10th month which is the month
[50:32] tibet in the seventh year of the reign
[50:36] so esther came into the palace of the
[50:38] king on the tenth months of the seventh
[50:41] year
[50:42] here we have our prophet
[50:45] amen
[50:46] remember remember one thing
[50:50] there were three magicians or three
[50:53] astronomers and they saw the star and
[50:56] they were just following the star
[50:59] and that star
[51:01] led them to the king
[51:03] so the three astronomers didn't say oh
[51:06] there's tremendous three stars in one
[51:08] line let's make a picture like let's
[51:10] make a doctrine of three stars in one
[51:12] line and we are the leaders of that new
[51:13] movement the three-star lion movement
[51:15] exactly we become the high priest of
[51:17] that whole
[51:18] that that star
[51:20] led them to a person to the king
[51:23] and and and they and they had every
[51:25] evening they had search service
[51:28] that's marcus okay they had family altar
[51:30] and they had a they had they were
[51:32] preaching to one another but they had
[51:34] nothing to say
[51:35] the only thing that they were preaching
[51:36] was
[51:37] we have seen the star can you say even
[51:39] amen blessed be the name of the lord
[51:41] they had no doctrine but they have seen
[51:43] the star
[51:44] and look and we have seen the star
[51:48] the seventh star
[51:49] we have seen the star but this star did
[51:52] not lead us to branham tabernacle but
[51:54] led us to the king
[51:57] to the person
[51:58] can you say amen he did not lead us to
[52:00] himself it led us to the king therefore
[52:04] almond sunset mountain brother abraham
[52:06] said the son is the king of all lights
[52:10] he says shalom good morning church
[52:13] the night is over shalom
[52:16] who appeared the king
[52:18] the light
[52:19] blessed be the name of the lord so we
[52:21] are not brahmites
[52:23] we are not brahmites no
[52:25] but we are christians
[52:27] but we understand the bible
[52:29] so what happened is this is on the tenth
[52:33] month of the seventh year she now came
[52:35] to the was presented to the king
[52:38] so
[52:40] all these girls wanted to impress the
[52:42] king
[52:43] by
[52:44] um something outstanding
[52:48] i just give this as an example because
[52:50] i'm lacking i like singing
[52:52] though brother abraham said only those
[52:54] who are gifted should sing so i find my
[52:57] i i found my limitation about it
[53:02] as an example
[53:04] a person say
[53:07] i i'm impressing god because i can sing
[53:10] then you see jimmy swaggart
[53:12] gee
[53:14] [Music]
[53:16] sing it again brothers
[53:20] and it's wonderful if you can sing but
[53:21] god has angels who can sing better than
[53:23] us
[53:26] somebody says i'm you know i know the
[53:29] message
[53:30] and i have a lot of wisdom that's
[53:31] wonderful but god is the source of all
[53:33] wisdom
[53:34] who wants to impress god
[53:37] amen we only impress him in this loudly
[53:40] seen age with humble
[53:42] hearts serving the lord and if we sing
[53:45] or preach or whatever we do it for the
[53:47] glory of god
[53:50] amen but we cannot impress god with our
[53:52] human abilities
[53:54] we cannot mix them together but doing
[53:56] everything for its purpose and now here
[53:58] comes that little little little girl
[54:01] and brother rain said yes she was not
[54:03] adorned with nothing
[54:05] because they thought the king is just
[54:07] looking for
[54:08] female attraction you understand what i
[54:10] want to say but she knew that king has
[54:13] character
[54:14] and brother raymond said this
[54:17] the story of esther
[54:19] jesus never mentioned it in the bible
[54:24] paul never mentions the story of esther
[54:26] amen
[54:27] martin luther said we should throw the
[54:29] book of esther into the river
[54:32] he he really thought it's not part of
[54:34] the bible and martin luther was asked
[54:36] the question why is the book of esther
[54:38] not mention the bible or why doesn't
[54:40] belong to the bible he said first it's
[54:42] to jewish
[54:44] second is a feminist book
[54:46] third the name of jehovah is not even
[54:49] mentioned in the whole book of esther so
[54:50] it has no place but here comes the
[54:53] seventh angel
[54:55] taking that whole story for after 2000
[54:57] years and preaches the marriage of the
[55:00] lamb
[55:02] making sense to the story of esther
[55:04] because we are that esther
[55:07] and then brother blame said this
[55:09] he said when esther came into the
[55:11] presence of that king he said she was
[55:14] just adorned with the holy
[55:19] with spirit holy spirit
[55:21] not with knowledge about the seventh
[55:22] seal
[55:23] this is part of the holy spirit very
[55:25] important part but that's not all
[55:27] because you can have a very nice
[55:29] understanding and an arrogant spirit
[55:32] you can have a very modest appeal
[55:35] but a very bad character behind the
[55:37] morris appeal a person said we are
[55:39] better than others because you know and
[55:41] we have longer discipline the muslims
[55:43] have longer hair than us
[55:45] that's not what is imp that's part of
[55:48] the gospel but that's not the center of
[55:49] the whole thing
[55:51] the center is a heart
[55:53] it's a character it's a love
[55:56] blessed be the name so when he came
[55:58] remember that king was king of 127
[56:01] countries
[56:02] esther had nothing to bring
[56:04] she was just a girl without father and
[56:06] her mother
[56:08] but when she came in and and brother
[56:10] brandon makes the drama he said when she
[56:12] came in the king was so impressed
[56:16] the only adoration that she had our
[56:19] jewelry let me call it like this was the
[56:21] holy spirit
[56:23] and the king directly found out
[56:25] this girl is not a barbie
[56:30] um this is not barbie i always tell the
[56:32] sisters if you want to make up yourself
[56:34] as barbie you get you get ken as husband
[56:39] if you want to have ken as harvard go
[56:41] but if you want to have somebody with
[56:43] value
[56:44] i mean be a woman of value
[56:46] and the bible says god puts together
[56:51] blessed be the name don't make yourself
[56:52] cheap please not
[56:54] don't make yourself be
[56:56] know who you are i'm a daughter of god
[57:00] i'm a son of god
[57:01] may i'm at home i'm just a janitor
[57:04] so while i'm preaching i'm looking if
[57:06] all the lights are fine the fire
[57:08] extinguishers everything is because it's
[57:09] part of my job but in me i'm a son of
[57:12] god
[57:13] no me is different this is just a tent
[57:16] in which i'm living but one day i will
[57:18] step out of it and go into my theophany
[57:21] and you do exactly the same
[57:23] so the king was so impressed amen we are
[57:26] not going into all these details but
[57:28] what happens is this
[57:31] when haman when haman was rised up
[57:34] remember haman and esther i know i've
[57:39] omitting all these things because i know
[57:41] the story is well known
[57:43] but
[57:45] haman and esther were both on the one
[57:48] roof
[57:50] and
[57:51] they were both blessed under king
[57:53] ahasberos and brother branham explains
[57:55] in the church book there is the two
[57:57] wines and they grow together and god
[58:00] lets to grow both
[58:01] god blesses both
[58:03] but the moments that haman tries to
[58:07] touch esther
[58:09] then the king comes on the plan
[58:12] so so so here we have the plan essa
[58:15] becomes an intercessor
[58:18] i don't mean brother brahm didn't save
[58:20] anyone they're all saved by calvary
[58:24] i asked a brother i said brother
[58:26] we believe we believe the bride is the
[58:28] final voice for the final age all these
[58:30] things we believe all this but i said
[58:31] that somebody goes into federal prison
[58:33] he never was in the message he was never
[58:35] was in a christian church so he reads
[58:37] the bible and is so impressed and he
[58:39] gives his heart to the lord he never
[58:40] read the message he doesn't know brother
[58:41] brain no it doesn't is he saved or not i
[58:43] said surely he saved
[58:46] on what basis on calvary
[58:48] on calvary if not we enter up in a sect
[58:51] in a cult
[58:52] you have to have so much messy but to be
[58:53] saved i mean if you if you start by this
[58:55] you are back in the mormon church
[58:57] god help us okay
[58:59] so so so so we are intercessors but not
[59:02] in that thing as that
[59:04] as as if we we can make a connection to
[59:06] god but
[59:08] we help
[59:10] we go for our brother
[59:12] we go for our sister
[59:14] we are in the plan of god
[59:15] have you ever thought about this he was
[59:17] in a
[59:19] finish nearly i mean but i have i have
[59:21] no no notes i'm just saying why don't we
[59:24] from from from wikipedia but
[59:26] you see have i thought about this here
[59:28] is jesus coming to mary and
[59:30] martha and martha she was running to
[59:34] jesus and said if you would have been
[59:36] here lather would not would not have
[59:37] beaten
[59:38] not died okay
[59:40] so she knows she stops mourning because
[59:43] he knows jesus is here
[59:45] at the same time maria was still
[59:48] mourning
[59:49] because she doesn't know that jesus is
[59:51] here
[59:52] so martha goes to maria and says the
[59:56] master calls you
[59:58] that's the story now who makes the
[1:00:00] calling
[1:00:01] jesus but who is the voice martyr
[1:00:06] do you understand
[1:00:07] jesus calls today but who is his voice
[1:00:10] who are his hands who are his feet you
[1:00:14] it's the voice of god you are the voice
[1:00:15] of god
[1:00:18] amen
[1:00:19] amen
[1:00:20] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:00:22] therefore every father is the head of
[1:00:23] his own home
[1:00:24] every pastor is the head of his church
[1:00:27] every messenger is the head of a church
[1:00:28] age and christ is the head of all seven
[1:00:30] messengers therefore there will be
[1:00:32] another people
[1:00:34] who will be the final voice for the
[1:00:36] final age under their messenger yes
[1:00:39] that's what it is not with their own
[1:00:40] message under their messenger
[1:00:43] so what happens
[1:00:45] i mean
[1:00:47] i mean heyman wants to kill
[1:00:49] uh
[1:00:50] the jews and here's the plan she becomes
[1:00:52] an intercessor she's now before the
[1:00:54] throne and and and and he she is timely
[1:00:58] there that's what mordecai says now is
[1:01:00] is not right the right time that you
[1:01:01] came into this position
[1:01:04] and remember your life
[1:01:06] is a blessing to somebody who brother
[1:01:08] paul and we cannot reach
[1:01:11] you have a ministry
[1:01:13] your life is the ministry
[1:01:15] sometimes i think
[1:01:18] i see many things
[1:01:21] but brother brahim said you mothers you
[1:01:23] are the fifth gospel
[1:01:25] it's an honor to take care of the
[1:01:26] children you don't have to go in another
[1:01:28] country to say i'm a missionary you are
[1:01:30] a missionary in your own home
[1:01:33] and god honors this
[1:01:36] blessed be the name of the lord and you
[1:01:38] see hey
[1:01:39] he he she invites haman the next time
[1:01:42] the king is still in love it's not just
[1:01:44] sexual love no he loves that character
[1:01:47] you can reach the story of the of esther
[1:01:50] the king doesn't even touch the girl
[1:01:52] because she said the king didn't touch
[1:01:54] me for 30 days she was not she was not
[1:01:56] barbie this was different
[1:01:59] this was different
[1:02:00] i mean
[1:02:01] for him i mean she had a lot of value
[1:02:04] okay
[1:02:05] so she invites him for the first time
[1:02:07] and the king leaves the throne and comes
[1:02:09] into the house of
[1:02:10] in the female palace
[1:02:13] and
[1:02:15] the king says half of my kingdom will be
[1:02:18] for you esther
[1:02:20] amen and esther says if you would come
[1:02:22] tomorrow again and i wondered myself i
[1:02:24] said esther why didn't you now react
[1:02:26] it's not possible now here's the
[1:02:28] situation hang him up and it's time to
[1:02:30] do something with haman
[1:02:33] but god doesn't make mistakes
[1:02:35] god doesn't
[1:02:37] because the next day he came again the
[1:02:39] king was human and the bible said in the
[1:02:41] night the king couldn't sleep yes in
[1:02:44] that night the king couldn't sleep and
[1:02:46] the book was brought unto him
[1:02:49] and the book was opened
[1:02:53] do you see between the first and the
[1:02:54] coming second coming of christ there's a
[1:02:56] book to be opened
[1:02:58] and here are the names right in
[1:03:00] and our names are right in it
[1:03:03] brother ren said what a happy day for
[1:03:04] john when his seals were open and he saw
[1:03:06] himself
[1:03:07] or saw his name
[1:03:09] however you want to bring it and he said
[1:03:10] there is john i saw my name right in the
[1:03:12] book
[1:03:13] blessed be the name of the lord and the
[1:03:15] king was so thrilled about the jews and
[1:03:17] what mordecai so when esther said
[1:03:20] i mean mordecai wants a haman wants to
[1:03:23] kill us the king was a hundred percent
[1:03:25] that was nitro and glitzerine coming
[1:03:27] together
[1:03:29] god doesn't make mistakes
[1:03:31] can you say amen
[1:03:33] so the family of god brother and sister
[1:03:35] this message that we believe is red bull
[1:03:39] it's red bull if you need energy for
[1:03:40] your life this message
[1:03:43] is red bull
[1:03:44] it's different it's more than just i go
[1:03:46] to church i mean i'm this message is our
[1:03:49] father talking to us
[1:03:51] you find yourself hey i'm ruth you find
[1:03:53] yourself i'm esther that's me that was
[1:03:56] my story do you do you see how esther
[1:03:58] from a little girl from a hillbilly a
[1:04:00] hillbilly girl now came into the
[1:04:02] position of a queen
[1:04:04] do you understand that god is not
[1:04:06] bringing us now always to a new birth
[1:04:08] that's fine for youngsters but god is
[1:04:11] now molding us
[1:04:13] to take over the throne
[1:04:16] so god sends problems and things and and
[1:04:18] he wants to see our reaction
[1:04:21] we ask for an easy life god calls for
[1:04:23] troubles
[1:04:25] because he says i want that character to
[1:04:27] be built in you
[1:04:29] can you say amen god brings problems
[1:04:31] even problematic brothers we want to
[1:04:34] shoot them on the moon god says i sent
[1:04:35] them again
[1:04:38] because he wants us to grow with all
[1:04:40] these problems
[1:04:41] because one day that rapture will we
[1:04:44] don't believe in the rapture in in some
[1:04:45] kind of a uh denominational way the
[1:04:48] rapture will be just one step for us
[1:04:51] we are already in the brotherhood called
[1:04:53] raptured condition
[1:04:54] this is already the preparation for
[1:04:56] everything we're in the cycle already
[1:04:59] can you say amen
[1:05:00] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:05:03] amen do you love the lord
[1:05:05] i'm what our father we have
[1:05:07] if the musician said fine if the
[1:05:08] musicians would come to the poll he said
[1:05:10] okay i mean if they would call and come
[1:05:13] and
[1:05:13] let me finish by this
[1:05:15] i may put everything aside
[1:05:18] hallelujah
[1:05:19] i mean what a father we have brother for
[1:05:23] me
[1:05:24] to preach the message is a great honor
[1:05:27] to live the message is a great honor
[1:05:29] to be part of that movement i'm not
[1:05:31] ashamed of my father we know in the
[1:05:34] framework of this message there's a lot
[1:05:36] of childish things
[1:05:38] we know this there's a lot of scandals
[1:05:39] there's nothing wrong about it look the
[1:05:41] first exodus and you will see the
[1:05:42] parallel and the third but you have to
[1:05:44] see the core of that whole thing
[1:05:47] i mean maybe you have the song i have a
[1:05:48] father amen and we
[1:05:51] sing it because this is brother mark is
[1:05:52] what is what is your doctrine amen as
[1:05:55] for me in my house we serve the lord
[1:05:57] that is my doctrine
[1:05:59] there was a brother between esther and
[1:06:01] that king there was a true love
[1:06:04] love is not a feeling
[1:06:06] love is more than butterflies
[1:06:08] love is his substance
[1:06:10] if brothers love one another you cannot
[1:06:13] let let him go
[1:06:14] you cannot
[1:06:16] you cannot make cold war and says okay
[1:06:18] let him do no there's something in you
[1:06:19] like you know
[1:06:22] and then say income do are you
[1:06:23] responsible for your brother and you say
[1:06:25] yes i'm responsible for my brother and
[1:06:27] for my sister i am
[1:06:28] amen because i'm not cain
[1:06:31] who told god and uh my brother my
[1:06:33] husband brother no no we are family
[1:06:35] do you agree with everything no i don't
[1:06:37] agree no not at all but my brother's my
[1:06:39] brother
[1:06:40] if he wants to list me that's fine if
[1:06:42] not i come back
[1:06:43] [Laughter]
[1:06:45] that's the way how god was dealing with
[1:06:47] us
[1:06:49] brother branham one time and the
[1:06:50] finishing buddies
[1:06:53] really finishing
[1:06:56] he speaks about the
[1:06:57] gallant man of david
[1:07:01] i honestly say i don't say it because
[1:07:03] i'm here i believe our brother paul is
[1:07:05] one of these gallant soldiers
[1:07:07] gallant man and brother brain preaches
[1:07:09] in the message
[1:07:12] there's a man who can turn on the light
[1:07:15] he speaks about this
[1:07:17] mighty man about david gallant man
[1:07:21] man of valor
[1:07:23] character
[1:07:25] man of
[1:07:27] caliber
[1:07:29] the prophet said the woman of sraptor
[1:07:31] had the same caliber like the prophet
[1:07:34] elijah
[1:07:35] that's what he says the same caliber
[1:07:39] that's family of god
[1:07:41] brother branham was our brother
[1:07:43] sometimes he would say branham said and
[1:07:45] brandon said he said hey that's my
[1:07:46] brother
[1:07:47] this is my brother
[1:07:48] i have another ministry but it's my
[1:07:50] brother it's part of my family
[1:07:52] therefore we cried all when we were
[1:07:55] reading his life story
[1:07:57] germans never cry only in football only
[1:07:59] in soccer
[1:08:00] germans only cry in soccer but when we
[1:08:02] were reading the story of brother we
[1:08:04] were crying
[1:08:05] because that was our story
[1:08:07] that was closer to our family story than
[1:08:09] our family story in the flesh
[1:08:12] and and these people there's so much
[1:08:15] love david love
[1:08:17] is is mortar
[1:08:19] love is is is substance between people i
[1:08:24] mean love is more than just okay let him
[1:08:26] go
[1:08:27] and david just said i would like to have
[1:08:30] a drink from the well
[1:08:33] enter in bethlehem
[1:08:36] and here's what brother blame said
[1:08:38] he said these men i mean they were
[1:08:40] fighters
[1:08:44] they were real fighters
[1:08:46] but when it comes to david they love the
[1:08:48] man so much
[1:08:50] brother brahm said this the least of his
[1:08:53] com least of his wishes were command for
[1:08:56] these men
[1:08:57] david didn't say you you you go i'm the
[1:09:00] king here you no no he just felt and
[1:09:02] these men said let's do it for our
[1:09:03] brother
[1:09:04] and for 14 miles
[1:09:07] two took the sword and one took the
[1:09:09] bucket at them
[1:09:10] [Music]
[1:09:15] and they came back
[1:09:17] and david was so touched by this
[1:09:20] amen and he poured it out to god he said
[1:09:23] i will not drink this
[1:09:25] this man this is the blood of these men
[1:09:28] you see how the water becomes blood even
[1:09:30] in the gospel
[1:09:32] i mean the bloody word becomes the word
[1:09:33] for the age
[1:09:35] amen this is the blood of this man
[1:09:37] [Music]
[1:09:38] and brother brahm said this
[1:09:40] and you have to find out that is you
[1:09:43] brother bram said these men had a
[1:09:45] revelation that david will become king
[1:09:48] one day
[1:09:50] you are not interested what the world
[1:09:52] says about this message you know what it
[1:09:55] is
[1:09:58] amen
[1:10:00] and when david became king he remembered
[1:10:02] these mighty men
[1:10:05] and they came into their positions some
[1:10:07] over cities and some other countries
[1:10:09] brother when our king
[1:10:11] will be crowned we come into our
[1:10:13] positions who we really are rather it
[1:10:16] matters to serve the lord
[1:10:18] sister it matters to serve the lord
[1:10:23] blessed be the name of the lord what a
[1:10:24] family we are
[1:10:26] nobody preaches you in
[1:10:28] nobody can preach you out
[1:10:30] god made the choosing
[1:10:32] so let's live a life
[1:10:34] for the honor and the glory of our
[1:10:36] father
[1:10:37] amen can you say amen
[1:10:40] i have
[1:10:49] he calls me

[1:13:01] thankful how he speaks to you so
[1:13:02] personally and gives us
[1:13:05] our potentials lay within us and he has
[1:13:08] to keep speaking it to us to show us
[1:13:11] that we keep looking at ourselves in the
[1:13:13] first birth
[1:13:14] but you can no longer look at yourself
[1:13:16] in the first birth it's who you are as a

[1:13:28] brother picks it up tonight
[1:13:30] and you know jesus didn't talk about
[1:13:32] esther
[1:13:33] paul didn't talk about it but she sure
[1:13:35] needed to be brought up in the bible
[1:13:38] and there are scriptures like that even
[1:13:40] in paul
[1:13:42] when he would deal with certain things
[1:13:43] even in church order
[1:13:45] he would pull something from the old
[1:13:47] testament that was needed for the day
[1:13:48] that he lived in a prophet can do that
[1:13:51] you know so he pulls it forward and
[1:13:54] brings it and that's our prophet had to
[1:13:55] pull forward esther and bring it out of
[1:13:58] hiding and bring it out of
[1:13:59] just a story can you say man because we
[1:14:02] are that esther tonight praise the lord
