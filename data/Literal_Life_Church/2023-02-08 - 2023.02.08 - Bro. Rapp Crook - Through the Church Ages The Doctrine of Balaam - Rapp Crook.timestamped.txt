[0:00] turn their Bibles to Revelation chapter
[0:02] 2
[0:03] it's been nearly two months since we had
[0:07] our last uh session over the church ages
[0:11] um
[0:12] so I don't remember what was preached or
[0:15] eaten a couple months ago so I'll just
[0:16] do a quick quick review
[0:18] last December we talked about uh about
[0:23] the pergamian church age and in the in
[0:25] the beginning first part we talked about
[0:27] how the uh how the first Jewish converts
[0:30] came into Rome and established the First
[0:33] Church of Rome we'd call that and um and
[0:37] it was flourishing for a time but then
[0:38] the Roman Emperor kicked all the Jews
[0:41] out of Rome for a period of think about
[0:44] 13 years and in that period in that
[0:47] 13-year period
[0:50] um and apostasy who was able to enter
[0:52] the church idolatry entered the church
[0:54] and um after the Exile after the Jews
[0:57] were able to come back after the
[0:58] Christians were able to come back they
[1:00] were appalled to see what the condition
[1:02] that that First Church of Rome was was
[1:05] in and um they started a second Church
[1:08] of Rome which actually held trued what
[1:11] the um what what the gospel taught but
[1:14] through Satan was able to take over this
[1:16] First Church of Rome name and that was
[1:18] kind of like compared to taking over the
[1:20] Instagram account you can send all these
[1:22] messages out this is the name of the
[1:23] First Church of Rome and it sounds
[1:24] really credible when actually it was uh
[1:27] it was falsehood
[1:30] um that was kind of the that was the
[1:32] goal of the devil um then and still is
[1:35] to be able to take over uh and and to to
[1:38] be to to Reign from the throne that uh
[1:42] that was for God alone and that was what
[1:45] he uh succeeded in doing there in that
[1:47] programian church age
[1:49] I'm almost there
[1:52] there we go that looks good
[1:54] so Revelation Chapter 2 and we'll just
[1:58] read this message to the perconium
[2:00] church starting in verse 12.
[2:04] and to the angel of the church in
[2:06] pergamus right these things Seth he
[2:09] which hath the sword with two edges the
[2:11] sharp sword with two edges I Know Thy
[2:13] works and where they'll dwellest even
[2:15] where Satan's seat is this is a very
[2:18] difficult Place uh to be living and
[2:21] trying to be a believer and you hold
[2:23] fast my name and you have not denied my
[2:25] faith even in those days where an
[2:27] Antipas was my faithful martyr who was
[2:30] slain among you where Satan dwells but I
[2:34] have a few things against you because
[2:35] you have there them that hold the
[2:38] doctrine of Balaam and that's what we're
[2:40] going to talk about this evening what is
[2:42] this doctrine of Balaam sometimes
[2:43] referred to in the Bible as the Council
[2:45] of Balaam or the teaching of Bill talk
[2:47] about that
[2:48] but Balaam taught balak to cast a
[2:51] stumbling block before the children of
[2:52] Israel to eat things sacrificed unto
[2:55] idols and to commit fornication so we'll
[2:58] look at those those three things are
[2:59] important the stumbling block element
[3:02] eating things sacrificed into idolism
[3:04] that goes finally and ends in
[3:06] fornication
[3:07] so hast thou also them that hold the
[3:11] doctrine of the Nicolaitans which thing
[3:13] I hate repent or else I will come unto
[3:17] thee quickly and will fight against them
[3:19] with the sword of my mouth he that hath
[3:22] an ear let him hear what the spirits
[3:23] after the churches to him that
[3:25] overcometh will I give to eat of the
[3:27] Hidden Manna and will give him a white
[3:28] stone and in the stone a new name
[3:30] written which no man knows saving he
[3:33] that receiveth it
[3:35] may the Lord add his uh blessing with
[3:37] the word this evening you may be seated
[3:40] foreign
[3:41] so we just want to take a look at how
[3:44] the doctrine of Balaam
[3:46] worked in this programian age but we'll
[3:48] also spend some time seeing what was the
[3:51] goal of the devil using Balaam back in
[3:55] the time of the moabites this is the
[3:57] allusion to that Bible story back in the
[3:59] Book of Numbers how it worked in the
[4:02] pergamian age under emperor Constantine
[4:05] and of course the doctrine of Balaam is
[4:07] still being used today and how how we
[4:10] can thanks to the discernment that God
[4:12] gives it gives us in his words see how
[4:15] the devil is still using some of these
[4:17] same strategies today
[4:21] um but the Brandon talks about in the uh
[4:23] pergamian age so this is the age when
[4:25] State and church were wedded together
[4:27] but there was the Babylonian religion
[4:29] that officially joined that First Church
[4:31] of Rome and then Satan now had access to
[4:35] the name of Christ he now this he's
[4:38] Satan is now running a church so he can
[4:41] issue proclamations out in Christ's name
[4:43] he was enthroned as God and worship this
[4:46] is what he had dreamed of
[4:48] um and I back up back before he was
[4:50] kicked out of heaven Isaiah 14 talks
[4:52] about how I want to be enthroned in
[4:54] place of God second Thessalonians talks
[4:57] about that also he wants to be seated as
[4:59] God in the temple of God and the Pagan
[5:01] Roman Emperor the Pagan Roman Empire had
[5:04] been dead and it was raised back in the
[5:07] papal room as an in prophesied also
[5:10] and we see that pergamus was indeed the
[5:13] throne and Dwelling Place of Satan
[5:15] brother Branham says though it was not
[5:17] originally the place where Satan dwelt
[5:20] Babylon has always been literally and
[5:22] figuratively his headquarters and it was
[5:25] in that city of Babylon the satanic
[5:27] worship had its origin and if you read
[5:30] in the church age book
[5:31] um in the in this chapter about the
[5:33] pergamian age brother Branham goes on
[5:35] for some pages about the pagan origins
[5:38] of Roman Catholicism and I just want to
[5:41] take a few minutes on that
[5:44] um
[5:44] After the flood the Earth was
[5:47] um the Earth was a purged of of sin it
[5:51] was a after the After the flood the
[5:53] Earth was just a there was it was a
[5:55] beautiful place it was it was it wasn't
[5:57] quite edinic but um it was it was there
[6:00] was no no sin just imagine just think
[6:03] about Sister Laura she had this uh um
[6:06] she had this terrible work environment
[6:07] and then she's in a completely different
[6:09] place how Noah and his wife hamsham and
[6:12] japheth they had been they've been
[6:13] living in the place that was completely
[6:15] just everything was terrible about it
[6:18] then they walk off the flood and this is
[6:20] like
[6:21] that's like almost like a new Heaven A
[6:23] New Earth everything is just
[6:26] sure clean is a breath of fresh air you
[6:29] didn't have to worry about what you were
[6:30] hearing what you were listening to with
[6:32] what you were seeing it was just
[6:33] beautiful
[6:35] and I can imagine
[6:37] Satan watching this
[6:40] because he had accomplished quite a lot
[6:43] in the days of Noah
[6:44] he was being he was being worshiped he
[6:47] was he was having his way on Earth as it
[6:50] were the sons of God and the daughters
[6:52] of men were mixing nobody could really
[6:54] see a difference nothing was such a big
[6:56] deal anymore and now Satan's looking
[6:58] that man has come again in close
[7:01] fellowship with God as soon as Noah and
[7:04] his family get off the ark
[7:06] Satan would have been making
[7:09] how would they be they've been
[7:10] quarantined in this Arc for 150 days at
[7:14] least and they come off and Satan would
[7:16] be holding his fist up against God why
[7:17] did you keep me in there so long you
[7:19] could have done this faster but no in
[7:21] this family come off and it's an altar
[7:24] it's worship it's communion and and and
[7:27] God receives their offering immediately
[7:29] he has this rainbow Covenant and the
[7:31] clowns and for say it's like oh no this
[7:34] is a flashback to Eden
[7:37] and Satan's looking at this and he's not
[7:39] going to let it go for very long
[7:41] he wants Satan's goal it's always been
[7:44] to to be enthroned as God and receive
[7:46] men's worship and he's saying hey this
[7:49] is getting messed up again how can I
[7:51] switch this back how can I reverse back
[7:54] to what I had before
[7:56] so if you read in um if um if you're in
[8:00] the church age book but brother Branham
[8:01] talks about a man named Nimrod and he's
[8:05] quoting from Genesis chapter 10. this is
[8:08] the genealogy Kush began Nimrod in this
[8:11] genealogy not a lot is told about the
[8:14] individuals who are named until you get
[8:16] to Nimrod you actually get a couple
[8:17] sentences about him Nimrod began to be a
[8:20] mighty one in the Earth
[8:22] and after the flood the animals come off
[8:26] the ark and one of the things that
[8:28] changes after the flood is that God put
[8:30] the fear of man in the hearts of the
[8:33] animals that no longer was it in the
[8:35] condition where they or that Lions would
[8:37] come and snuggle up against you and rub
[8:39] against you and be purring
[8:41] um there was a there was a roar there
[8:43] the men were allowed to hunt and kill
[8:46] the animals and the Animals had there
[8:48] there was a yeah there was a there was a
[8:50] different relationship and in the
[8:52] hislops to Babylons and other places it
[8:54] talks about how the animals they began
[8:57] to multiply very quickly they're on the
[8:59] earth and soon they had these beasts of
[9:01] prey who could who could hinder men as
[9:04] they were trying to build their cities
[9:05] and someone who was able to hunt well
[9:08] and defend the people would become a
[9:11] natural leader and such a man was Nimrod
[9:14] he was a mighty Hunter before the Lord
[9:17] that's why it said even this Nimrod the
[9:20] mighty Hunter before the Lord now this
[9:23] phrase before the Lord
[9:25] um it's not quite what we might think it
[9:28] means at first glance nimrod's name
[9:31] means Rebellion
[9:34] he's the first mighty one he's the first
[9:36] Tyrant actually he's the first Mighty
[9:38] Hunter and he's able to gather Villages
[9:41] and cities under his control and he
[9:44] rules them with a with an iron hand and
[9:46] he sets himself up
[9:48] he sets himself up before the Lord he's
[9:51] putting himself up before the Lord not
[9:54] not he's before the Lord serving God but
[9:57] he wants people to be looking at him
[9:59] instead of the Lord and as far as on
[10:01] their list of priorities it's Nimrod not
[10:04] God and he's leading to people then in
[10:07] rebellion and Satan is using Nimrod here
[10:10] to get himself back enthroned upon the
[10:14] temple of God because he doesn't like
[10:16] this this close communion that man has
[10:18] with God After the flood
[10:21] he builds a city in the tower there he
[10:23] is again he's going to be using Nimrod
[10:25] to interrupt this uh this close
[10:27] communion between God and man the Nimrod
[10:29] appears and pretty much every
[10:32] um mythology of every ethnic group he'll
[10:35] come up under different names but the
[10:37] statues will be similar they'll be
[10:38] different character it'll be a similar
[10:40] characteristics and traits that the
[10:42] Nimrod character will have
[10:44] well Nimrod leads this leads this effort
[10:48] there at the Tower of Babel
[10:51] and uh at this time at this point all
[10:53] the Earth is of one language of one
[10:55] speech After the flood God had sent man
[10:58] out to go and repopulate the Earth and
[11:01] um nimrod's folks uh they're not so sure
[11:03] they want to do that they want to make a
[11:05] city they want to make a tower whose top
[11:09] May reach unto heaven
[11:11] why are they doing this it's not for the
[11:13] glory of God they want to make a name
[11:15] for themselves let us make us a name and
[11:20] we want to be better prepared so that we
[11:22] can be in the place if God ever decides
[11:24] to to uh to cast Thunderbolts down at us
[11:27] again if he ever tries to get at us
[11:28] again we want to have protection so that
[11:32] we can be out of God's reach that's what
[11:35] he's trying to do
[11:37] so he um all of this is masked in the
[11:40] religious language but his purpose is
[11:44] Defiance against the Lord
[11:46] just a couple quotes from this book The
[11:48] Two Babylons
[11:50] um all tradition from the earliest times
[11:53] Bears testimony to the apostasy of
[11:56] nimrod and to his success in Leading Men
[11:58] away from the patriarchal faith that
[12:01] Faith had been passed down from Noah to
[12:03] Shem and and further
[12:06] nimrod's purpose was to deliver the
[12:09] people's minds from the awe and awe of
[12:12] God and fear of judgments of Heaven that
[12:14] must have rested on them while the
[12:17] memory of the flood was yet recent
[12:19] after after the flood has gone off and
[12:23] and Noah and his family are establishing
[12:25] their first families there was a I think
[12:28] a really a strong fear of God because
[12:31] everybody had seen what God was able to
[12:32] do and and you could you could hear the
[12:34] stories and the testimonies and nimrod's
[12:36] purpose was to create a distance between
[12:38] that he didn't he wanted to break men
[12:40] off from that patriarchal faith
[12:42] now
[12:44] um Hislop continues God must have seemed
[12:46] very near to the Earth
[12:48] After the flood is over and to maintain
[12:51] this Union Between Heaven and Earth
[12:53] which is what the rainbow symbolizes to
[12:56] maintain this closeness between Heaven
[12:58] and Earth and to keep this relationship
[13:00] between Heaven and Earth as close as
[13:01] possible that must have been the grand
[13:03] aim of all Who Loved God and the best
[13:05] interest of the human race
[13:07] but this close relationship between
[13:09] Heaven and Earth implied
[13:11] restraining sin and the pleasures of sin
[13:15] after which the natural mind continually
[13:17] goes after
[13:19] however Nimrod called this bondage
[13:24] avoiding sin so that we can have a close
[13:26] relationship with God Nimrod says that's
[13:28] bondage he didn't want that and that's
[13:30] what the devil's always going to try to
[13:32] twist things around nimrod's calling it
[13:34] bondage and he introduces apostasy of
[13:36] false teaching and he's encouraging a
[13:38] free life among his followers
[13:41] among those who rallied around him to
[13:43] separate them from holy influences that
[13:46] had in his view controlled them
[13:49] he helped them to put God and the strict
[13:52] spirituality of God's law
[13:54] at a distance
[13:56] and then everybody would feel they could
[13:58] breathe freely and walk at Liberty
[14:02] those are the same kinds of words and
[14:04] Concepts that the devil uses today
[14:07] because God's law was just bondage if
[14:09] you want to have real Freedom do what
[14:12] you want go out in the world have a free
[14:14] life breathe freely that's true Liberty
[14:16] it's the same thing all over again it's
[14:18] the strategy that Satan will be able to
[14:21] sit and thrown upon the temple he really
[14:23] wants to have which is upon your heart
[14:27] according to the system which Nimrod was
[14:29] the Grand instrument introducing
[14:32] men were led to believe that a real
[14:34] spiritual change of heart was not
[14:36] necessary
[14:38] and that even as far as any change was
[14:40] needful they could be regenerated by
[14:42] mere external means their own works it's
[14:45] evident that he led
[14:47] mankind to seek their Chief good in
[14:50] sensual enjoyment and showed them how
[14:52] they might enjoy the pleasures of sin
[14:54] without any fear of the wrath of a holy
[14:57] God that's the purpose of the Tower of
[14:59] Babylon we're afraid that if God would
[15:02] ever want to destroy the Earth with the
[15:04] flood because of us doing our own ways
[15:06] we're going to have insurance against
[15:08] that we're going to build a tower that
[15:10] is Judgment proof so that we can do
[15:13] whatever we want
[15:15] that's the purpose that was the purpose
[15:17] of uh of this of of nimrod there at that
[15:22] time
[15:23] and after the confusion of languages at
[15:25] Babel nimrod's false teaching spread
[15:28] over the entire world
[15:30] and you can see the evidence of that
[15:32] pretty much every culture all over the
[15:34] world will have some kind of flood Story
[15:36] the details will be different but the
[15:39] the basis of the story will be the same
[15:43] another thing you can see are some of
[15:46] the artwork and images of a certain
[15:48] element of this Nimrod story after
[15:50] Nimrod died
[15:51] his wife whose name was samiramis she
[15:55] had a son whom she named tamus and she
[15:59] claimed then that um this um this son
[16:04] was a miracle was it was a miraculous
[16:07] conception and this son was simply
[16:10] Nimrod reincarnated
[16:13] and then this father
[16:15] became their son who should be worshiped
[16:18] and the mother should be worshiped as
[16:19] well this is the devil's version
[16:22] of Genesis 3 15 how the woman is going
[16:25] to have a seed come and this the seed
[16:27] will will defeat The Serpent and he's
[16:30] giving the Satan's giving a substitute a
[16:32] fulfillment for this prophecy and says
[16:34] you should worship the son because
[16:36] that's who the fathers you should
[16:37] worship the mother as well it's
[16:39] confusion and you can see the evidence
[16:41] of this story you see to the upper left
[16:44] that's the Babylonian goddess simiramis
[16:46] you can see the similarity with an
[16:48] Indian goddess and Krishna there and
[16:51] another Indian goddess with an infant
[16:53] iswara
[16:54] an Egyptian goddess and then you have
[16:56] the Roman Catholic Mary see this artwork
[16:59] is all over the world because this is
[17:01] the nimrod's false teaching that's um
[17:04] that's that's gone all over the place
[17:06] he's trying to
[17:07] um to to fulfill Genesis 3 15 himself so
[17:12] that um there was the people the people
[17:14] will not be expecting any Messiah again
[17:16] that he is the Messiah himself and he
[17:19] wants to receive their worship that's
[17:20] his goal he wants to be enthroned and
[17:23] receive worship
[17:25] and brother Branham says that the story
[17:28] of nimrod he's a he's a wicked man he
[17:30] went out and forced all the little
[17:31] countries to come into one place and
[17:32] build this Tower he says this is where
[17:34] you see denominational religion being
[17:36] typed in in the Bible this is a some
[17:39] this one story that's uniting all kinds
[17:42] of different cultures all kinds of
[17:43] different religions but it's uniting
[17:45] them all and that is where
[17:47] um Satan is receiving his worship
[17:51] now that's kind of the background this
[17:52] is this is this is kind of Satan's modus
[17:55] operandi his his way of working he wants
[17:57] to work to break up any Fellowship
[17:59] between God and man he doesn't he he
[18:01] hates that God man could ever have a
[18:03] covenant binding them together
[18:05] and you can imagine
[18:07] um he's he's tracking things he knows
[18:09] who the god of who the people of God are
[18:11] in general terms that they're the
[18:13] children of of Abraham and he sees
[18:15] they're finally down in Egypt and he's
[18:18] he's having a Heyday in Egypt
[18:20] um killing all these uh Hebrew boys and
[18:22] making the the Jews work as hard as they
[18:24] can however when um when he sees the
[18:28] children of Israel exiting Egypt through
[18:32] a miraculous Exodus I'm sure Satan
[18:34] starts thinking of this this could be a
[18:36] problem because I don't want them to
[18:37] come into a covenant again he's he's
[18:39] seeing them led by a uh led by a pillar
[18:42] of fire he said how can I how can I soak
[18:44] in the fusion here and he successfully
[18:46] sows confusion there in the wilderness
[18:48] and they have to traip surround the
[18:50] Wilderness another 40 years but
[18:53] um there as Israel's finally getting
[18:55] closer and closer to the promised land
[18:57] he's seeing here's the people they've
[18:58] made it through this Wilderness I've
[18:59] made it as hard as I could on them but
[19:02] they're here
[19:03] they're being led by this Pillar of Fire
[19:05] the Throne of God the mercy seat is in
[19:08] the middle of their Camp the Shekinah
[19:10] Glory is among them and he couldn't
[19:12] tolerate any signs of a renewed Covenant
[19:15] A Renewed relationship between God and
[19:17] man is what he's been trying to break up
[19:18] sense the Garden of Eden so again he
[19:22] sees this happening and he's going to go
[19:23] right to work how can I disrupt this
[19:28] now the children of Israel they'd gone
[19:29] through the Exodus they'd gone through
[19:31] the Wilderness for for 40 years
[19:33] and the numbers uh numbers numbers 24
[19:36] they have some outstanding they've made
[19:39] it through they're on their they're on
[19:40] their way right up to the up to the
[19:43] River Jordan
[19:44] um and numbers 24 they they they they
[19:47] defeat sihon King of the ammonites they
[19:49] defeat OG the king of beishan they have
[19:52] some pretty remarkable victories in in
[19:54] number of 24.
[19:57] and in their minds
[20:00] they don't see Numbers 22 23 and 24 or
[20:05] 25 coming
[20:08] that's the story of Balaam the children
[20:10] of Israel don't see that
[20:12] they've they've defeated the dog of the
[20:14] king of beishan they're ready to go
[20:16] under the promised land they don't see
[20:19] that balak the king of Moab is looking
[20:22] at this as I've got to stop this I've
[20:23] got to do something they don't see that
[20:25] he's sending Messengers to Balaam so we
[20:28] can curse them and that's a similar
[20:30] thing that they're almost there they've
[20:32] defeated these Kings and they abide in
[20:35] in there in shittim and they are so
[20:39] close they're right across the river
[20:40] from Jericho they're so close I just
[20:43] think for us
[20:45] we've gone so far and we're on the cusp
[20:48] of the Rapture we're almost there and
[20:51] they were just as oblivious to balak and
[20:54] balaam's conspiracy as we might be what
[20:57] is the devil conspiring to in Heavenly
[21:00] places these the story of Balaam they
[21:03] don't see coming they don't see it
[21:04] developing they've got one Victory
[21:06] another Victory they said onto Jericho
[21:08] we're almost there they encamp and shoot
[21:10] everything we're ready to go we're
[21:12] getting ready to go they don't realize
[21:14] that Balaam has been trying to curse
[21:17] them perhaps for a few weeks they don't
[21:18] realize that
[21:20] because the story of Balaam is like a
[21:22] parenthetical we tell the story about
[21:24] Israel doing Victory here Victory there
[21:27] and then we step back and on the other
[21:30] side of town
[21:31] Bale acting the moabites looks all this
[21:34] and he's not happy about it
[21:37] and he's already conspiring with Balaam
[21:39] gets people to go to bring Balaam to him
[21:41] they're so close and how important it is
[21:44] to God had given the children of Israel
[21:48] this prophetic gift to help them see
[21:50] where they were to help them to see what
[21:53] their task was how they should be living
[21:56] in that present day
[21:58] and at one point here they stopped
[22:01] listening to Moses and start listening
[22:03] to teaching of Balaam and it's the worst
[22:06] mistake they ever made yet they were so
[22:10] close I didn't realize how close they
[22:13] were they thought the next Bible story
[22:15] was going over the Jordan River
[22:18] but it wasn't
[22:19] you know so we're getting ready to see
[22:21] Balaam here and just by way of review
[22:23] this doctrine of Balaam has three parts
[22:26] balance Doctrine consists first of
[22:29] stumbling blocks
[22:30] and then eating things sacrificed to
[22:32] idols and then committing fornications
[22:35] it starts so just with simple stumbling
[22:38] blocks I want to pay attention how that
[22:40] works
[22:42] and we'll notice how Balaam approaches
[22:45] his decision making when he's invited by
[22:47] balak to come and curse the people
[22:49] because we see these stumbling blocks
[22:52] balaam's own thought processes as he
[22:54] makes decisions how he speaks to God
[22:57] these these things are stumbling him up
[23:00] as well
[23:01] and he doesn't this is just how he
[23:03] operates and he's going to be teaching
[23:05] other people to work this way as well
[23:07] we know the story that uh balak sends
[23:11] Messengers to Balaam and they come to
[23:13] Balaam and say to himach the son of
[23:16] zippoor let nothing I pray You Hinder
[23:19] thee from coming unto me for I will
[23:21] promote you under a very great honor
[23:24] I'll do whatever you say just come I
[23:28] pray you curse these people let nothing
[23:30] hinder you whatever you want nice house
[23:33] nice car whatever you want I will
[23:35] provide it
[23:37] and Balaam is really good at talking The
[23:41] Talk
[23:42] because he says all the right things
[23:44] here Balaam answers and says to the
[23:47] Servants of balak you know if balak
[23:49] could give me his entire house full of
[23:51] silver of gold I still couldn't go
[23:54] beyond the word of the Lord my God I
[23:56] couldn't do less or more he's so good
[23:58] that he's saying all the right things
[24:00] here
[24:02] for some reason
[24:04] he says but why don't you wait
[24:07] just this night that I will get the
[24:11] confirmation from the Lord I will know
[24:13] what the Lord will say unto me more
[24:17] God had already told him don't go
[24:21] he told them he couldn't go that he
[24:24] couldn't go over God's command yet he
[24:27] still says
[24:29] maybe I missed it I don't know he hears
[24:32] all these things that are being offered
[24:33] to him and says my why would this be
[24:36] wrong
[24:37] why would it be wrong to have all these
[24:40] these blessings
[24:43] blessings are a good thing
[24:46] shouldn't I mean God leads through open
[24:49] doors right and this seems like an open
[24:52] door and what could I what good could I
[24:54] do with this
[24:56] but he's he's got wrong principles for
[24:59] decision making and these are stumbling
[25:02] him
[25:04] the teaching of Balaam
[25:06] is first of all in practice
[25:08] God's word is just advice
[25:11] he will say I can only do what God says
[25:15] to do I can't go beyond I can't go more
[25:18] or less than what God says to he says
[25:20] all the right things so if you just
[25:22] listen to what Balaam says amen this
[25:24] guy's got it right he holds directly to
[25:27] the truth if you just listen
[25:30] but if you watch how we apply says how
[25:33] he lives his own life
[25:35] God's word is just advice
[25:38] I can go and ask God a second time I can
[25:40] go ask him a third time I can get a
[25:42] second third fourth fifth opinion of
[25:43] what God says because in the multitude
[25:46] of counters or safety right
[25:49] God's word is not absolute for him
[25:52] and that's a stumbling block
[25:54] when we say yeah this is what it says in
[25:57] the app is that really right because
[25:59] yeah if I were to do this thing that I
[26:02] might not feel completely right about
[26:03] yeah maybe I'm just being a little
[26:06] a little legalistic on something here
[26:08] because I were to do this I could really
[26:10] be blessed it'd be a really nice thing
[26:12] because Balaam also is teaching that
[26:13] blessings are the truest indicators of
[26:16] what's right
[26:17] that's what balaam's thinking
[26:19] and this is going to trip him up it
[26:21] trips the Israelites up and they can
[26:23] trip us up
[26:25] because this is this this and these are
[26:27] these are principles that are still very
[26:29] much in play today people can talk the
[26:32] talk really really well but the Bible is
[26:34] the word of God and everything but when
[26:36] it actually comes down to it
[26:39] they'll do what they want but they'll
[26:42] still have their praise and worship on
[26:44] those of this or that on still talk
[26:45] about being Christians be on their
[26:47] Instagram Channel talk about this or
[26:49] that and they talk about Christians but
[26:51] it's word isn't an absolute to them and
[26:53] that is a modern manifestation of the
[26:56] doctrine of Balaam and blessings might
[26:58] the greatest blessing nowadays is
[27:00] feeling good about yourself
[27:03] because would God want me to feel bad
[27:04] about myself
[27:06] so if I can do this and feel good about
[27:08] it that must be
[27:10] the will of God because God gives me a
[27:14] conscience and if I feel all right about
[27:16] it that must be just fine but you know
[27:18] what our consciences can be defiled
[27:20] Titus talks about that and nowadays with
[27:23] the culture we live in it's very easy
[27:25] for our conscience to be defiled so we
[27:28] can't listen just to what our Conscience
[27:29] Says we have to go back as our is this
[27:32] what God's word says and that is the
[27:35] absolute
[27:36] but um it is it's nice to channel the
[27:39] culture every now and then we know who
[27:41] this lady is Right Oprah Winfrey she
[27:43] says if something feels right I do it
[27:46] if it feels wrong I don't you've got to
[27:48] be willing to take your chances doing
[27:50] stuff that may look crazy to other
[27:52] people or not doing something that looks
[27:55] right to others but feels wrong to you
[27:56] because you just just do it if it feels
[27:59] right if you get good results good vibes
[28:02] from it that must be right just do it if
[28:05] it feels good do it that is that's the
[28:08] way people live today
[28:10] both inside and outside of church
[28:12] unfortunate because this doctrine of
[28:14] Balaam is still there because Baylor
[28:16] thought God wouldn't want to keep me
[28:18] from honor or riches Woody
[28:22] so he asks God again God
[28:25] can I go back can I go Lord can I go
[28:28] and God says yes you may
[28:33] but you must say exactly what I say but
[28:35] you may go
[28:37] and here's where we get this concept of
[28:39] the permissive will
[28:41] and a lot of people love the permissive
[28:44] will because they say God said I could
[28:45] do it so it's going to be the right
[28:46] thing and we'll just see how this idea
[28:49] of the permissive will plays out because
[28:51] it can be very deceptive but we don't
[28:53] want to play around with God's
[28:55] permissive will
[28:57] brother Branham says just speaking to
[28:59] the second stumbling block of the
[29:01] doctrine of Balaam you can't judge God
[29:04] by Prosperity the world prospers but
[29:08] that doesn't mean the world right the
[29:10] richest man in the world
[29:12] is he being prospered yeah he's doing a
[29:14] lot of he's prospering does that mean
[29:15] that he's right no
[29:17] Balaam prospered by the brother you
[29:19] judge God by his word he keeps his word
[29:21] identifies the truth as long as you live
[29:24] never forget this God doesn't change his
[29:28] mind
[29:29] yet he will bless
[29:31] he'll let you go with his permissive
[29:33] will but you won't change his mind he
[29:37] won't change his plan he won't change
[29:39] his word for you no sir you've got to
[29:42] change
[29:43] you can't have God's word match your
[29:45] experience you've got to have your
[29:47] experience match God's word
[29:50] and that's the big thing to do because
[29:51] we think oh the permissible is all work
[29:54] together for good in the end right
[29:57] that's not how it works because if I
[29:59] could say it's my it's God's will for
[30:02] those row of chairs to be moved five
[30:04] feet forward
[30:05] and I ask these guys in the front row to
[30:07] do that and they say sure we'll do that
[30:08] but that's a lot of work and no they
[30:10] don't end up doing it they don't do it
[30:12] they're going off and I let them go on I
[30:15] don't strike them with Thunderbolts
[30:16] because they're not doing it I let them
[30:18] go off do their own thing but my perfect
[30:20] will hasn't changed I asked somebody
[30:22] else to go do it and they do it so
[30:24] they're Disobedience going into the
[30:26] permissive will does not hinder God's
[30:28] perfect will from taking place that's
[30:31] what that means when we say that the
[30:33] permissive will will work out into God's
[30:35] perfect will it won't keep God's perfect
[30:37] will from happening but it doesn't mean
[30:38] that your role in that perfect will
[30:40] might be the same
[30:41] it can sound very very um very confusing
[30:44] and tempting but we don't want to mess
[30:47] with God's permissive will
[30:49] so we know the story that Balaam and
[30:51] Bala went to several mountains Israel is
[30:53] completely oblivious to this they don't
[30:55] realize what's happening they're
[30:57] probably making plans to go into the for
[31:00] the next campaign
[31:01] but balak and Balaam they're trying to
[31:03] throw curses over Israel from different
[31:05] locations none of it works and then
[31:08] after time and time again balak just has
[31:11] had enough his anger is kindled against
[31:13] Balaam he smites his hands together and
[31:16] says I wanted to promote you to honor
[31:19] but God has kept you back from honor
[31:23] that's what the devil still trying to
[31:25] say to us today when he invites us to
[31:28] compromise invite us to go back and have
[31:31] a relationship with the worldly friend
[31:32] or whatever he says God is keeping it
[31:35] back from good things God is keeping you
[31:38] back from a good life God is keeping you
[31:40] back from this that's the same thing
[31:42] he's saying today
[31:44] God was protecting balamir he was
[31:47] protecting him and God's protecting us
[31:50] till today but I can just imagine though
[31:52] Balaam goes home he's uh this is this is
[31:56] kind of their last words here and the
[31:58] balaam's going home he says man
[32:01] it just didn't really sit right that
[32:03] last conversation with balak and he was
[32:07] still thinking about all those house
[32:08] full of gold and silversmen
[32:11] did I not did I get that wrong God
[32:13] because I don't feel this doesn't sit
[32:16] well I had to go back and see if we can
[32:18] get this better and you guys go back
[32:21] and here you've got he goes back and he
[32:25] and balak talk and Balaam hatches this
[32:28] plan
[32:29] he can't curse Israel but he can get
[32:32] Israel to start doing things that will
[32:34] bring a curse upon themselves
[32:37] and that is the fruit of the doctrine of
[32:40] Balaam
[32:42] and the second Corinthians chapter 10
[32:44] Paul references this very stories as
[32:47] these things in the Old Testament took
[32:49] place as examples for us so that we
[32:53] won't desire evil like they did
[32:55] and all these things happen to them for
[32:57] an example they were written down for
[32:59] our instruction on whom the end of the
[33:01] ages has come
[33:03] just like to the children of Israel that
[33:06] at the very end of their Journey at the
[33:08] edge of the Jordan River ready to go in
[33:10] and we are the End of the Age it has
[33:12] come we're on the border of Eternity
[33:14] ready to go in and these things written
[33:17] for our examples so that we will not
[33:21] um lust after evil things so that we
[33:23] will take heed let him who thinks he
[33:26] stands take lest he fall
[33:28] and numbers 25 here
[33:31] Israel Abode and chittim this is the
[33:33] verse that happens right after Balaam
[33:36] leaves balak
[33:37] and then somehow Balaam comes back
[33:41] and that's where it says the people
[33:43] somehow begin to commit whoredom with
[33:45] the daughters Moab
[33:47] how'd it happen he says they called The
[33:49] People Under The sacrifices of their
[33:51] gods and the people that eat and bowed
[33:54] down to their gods and Israel joined
[33:57] himself unto Baal peor which is a place
[34:01] right there where they have that feast
[34:02] and the anger of the Lord was kindled
[34:05] against Israel
[34:07] and they were so close
[34:10] so very close
[34:13] and later on
[34:16] um in the Book of Numbers it looked
[34:18] looks back to this and we see why did
[34:20] they fall because Balaam caused the
[34:24] children of Israel to sin it was his
[34:26] counsel that caused them to go to these
[34:28] feasts and finally commit whoredom with
[34:31] the children of Moab
[34:32] but I wondered I looked up what Baal
[34:35] pure actually means this is interesting
[34:38] and Baal means Lord and pior means Gap
[34:43] Lord of The Gap and I got to thinking
[34:46] about it that this sounds a little bit
[34:48] like Lord of the loophole
[34:51] hmm
[34:53] and a loophole is just a way you always
[34:55] there there are rules you're always
[34:57] looking for loopholes people do what you
[34:59] want without breaking any of the rules
[35:02] and I just thought a loophole where all
[35:06] the way people can always a lot of
[35:07] Christians might look like like this
[35:09] these are these money lenders looking
[35:11] for loopholes to make profits but
[35:13] sometimes Christians today could be
[35:16] looking like these sharks they want to
[35:17] live their life looking for loopholes
[35:20] excuses to do what they want to do and
[35:23] it's looked at this this loophole it
[35:25] looks very inviting because yeah I can I
[35:27] can do what I want right here anyway but
[35:30] eventually this loophole it's going to
[35:32] resem if you if you keep going through
[35:34] the loopholes like this it's going to
[35:36] resemble a noose
[35:38] in the end and that's what happens to
[35:41] the children of Israel they want to do
[35:43] what they wanted to do they they were
[35:45] convinced that they could because after
[35:47] all Balaam taught them that God's word
[35:49] is really good God's word gives good
[35:52] advice but you know what Moses doesn't
[35:54] have the option on on on on on Truth get
[35:58] a second opinion get the third opinion
[36:00] and you know what blessings are great
[36:02] and what's the big deal Moab and Israel
[36:05] we're we're cousins we just want to
[36:09] invite you over to have like a house
[36:11] touring party this is like a family
[36:13] reunion can't we bury the hatchet lot
[36:16] and Abraham a quarreled long ago when
[36:18] that was too bad but you know what over
[36:21] the years we've been able to develop
[36:22] ways to handle such quarrels and we can
[36:25] get over this we can settle this we can
[36:27] have we can have Fellowship welcome
[36:29] welcome to the neighborhood kind of
[36:30] thing
[36:31] and the teaching of Balaam this next
[36:33] part
[36:34] is going to be bringing people to sing
[36:38] sacrifice to idols
[36:40] it's the stumbling blocks that Balaam
[36:42] lays first that God's word is just
[36:44] advice and blessings are the truest
[36:47] indicator of God's leadership these
[36:49] stumbling blocks are what allowed the
[36:51] children of Israel to make these steps
[36:53] to even go to this feast in the first
[36:56] place
[36:57] and the teaching of Balaam says The end
[37:00] justifies the means we want to have a
[37:03] bigger group we want to be able to
[37:04] appeal better to the community we want
[37:07] to be able to be more inclusive who
[37:10] wants to be exclusive we want to we want
[37:12] to draw the circle bigger and include
[37:13] lots and lots more people these things
[37:15] sound really good it's a good end so to
[37:18] accomplish this end we can start
[37:20] incorporating different methods that
[37:22] Moses never used
[37:24] different methods are great because the
[37:26] end makes it right
[37:29] but you know what different methods have
[37:32] a way of aborting the end in the long
[37:36] run
[37:36] and changing the end in the long run and
[37:39] these forms of different religious
[37:41] worship
[37:42] actually functions as a smoke screen
[37:46] this great banquet that Moab set up is a
[37:48] housewing party welcomed the new
[37:50] neighbors to the block
[37:53] bury the hatchet between Abraham and lot
[37:55] and everything this was just a smoke
[37:57] screen because Satan was really just
[37:59] trying to interrupt and break apart the
[38:03] Covenant relationship between Israel and
[38:06] between God he didn't want them to be
[38:08] led by this Pillar of Fire anymore you
[38:09] don't have this close Fellowship anymore
[38:11] that was the ultimate goal
[38:20] foreign
[38:24] age as well
[38:27] he just wanted to get himself enthroned
[38:30] there upon this Temple he wanted to be
[38:32] to be worshiped as God
[38:35] and didn't matter how it happened
[38:37] Constantine said hey let's just go ahead
[38:39] and uh we can we can rename some of
[38:42] these feast days there used to be pagans
[38:44] feast days just give him Christian names
[38:46] you can come to we we can change a
[38:49] little little different things we'll
[38:51] just call it Christian and we'll make it
[38:52] Christian and you'll have freedom in the
[38:54] Empire
[38:56] who wouldn't want that
[38:58] and this is just a way and he would
[39:00] start changing the methods
[39:02] to have this religious worship changing
[39:04] the methods of religious worship to
[39:06] achieve this this good and everybody
[39:07] wanted but out of bounds methods have a
[39:11] way of leading you to Out of Bounds ends
[39:13] and that's what Balaam ended up doing
[39:16] because the true purpose of the devil is
[39:19] still to exalt himself as God there in
[39:22] the temple of God acting like he is God
[39:27] and there are a couple of uh brother
[39:28] Brandon has some really nice concise
[39:30] summaries of the doctrine of bail and
[39:32] like this first one the doctrine of
[39:33] Balaam go ahead do it your way
[39:38] Moses I'm you would I you have to we
[39:41] don't know what conversations took place
[39:43] in the camp of Israel what Moses tried
[39:46] to say to the people to dissuade them
[39:49] I'm sure there were many conversations
[39:51] but eventually Moses couldn't keep them
[39:54] back and God said go ahead do it your
[39:56] way but it's not going to be good do it
[39:59] your way
[40:00] and Bale and his Doctrine was just right
[40:02] for this group of people it met their
[40:03] taste exactly it appealed to them and
[40:06] this takes you right back to what Nimrod
[40:10] was trying to do right after the flood
[40:11] this way that God's trying to teach to
[40:14] preserve a close relationship between
[40:15] Heaven and Earth that's bondage we want
[40:18] to break that bondage and I will lead
[40:21] I'll teach you to leave a sensual life
[40:22] you have freedom you'll have Liberty
[40:24] that's true freedom
[40:26] just completely reversing it in the
[40:28] doctrine of balance doing the exact same
[40:30] thing when Satan is witnessing a New
[40:33] Covenant relationship as the people are
[40:34] coming right to their Promised Land
[40:38] the doctrine of Balaam what was it it
[40:41] was this idea to have this great
[40:42] Festival up there the Feast of belpure
[40:45] it was a feast to worship
[40:47] and Moab knew enough about
[40:50] abrahamic tradition how to how to offer
[40:52] sacrifices they could have the right
[40:54] form on their sacrifices they could do
[40:57] all those things that was just a smoke
[40:59] screen
[41:00] to get Israel to come and eat Meats
[41:03] sacrifice to idols
[41:05] it's the same thing Constantine did
[41:08] and he's uh the statements we're all
[41:11] just the same there's no difference
[41:13] between us we're all just Christians it
[41:15] was what what can be said today there's
[41:18] no difference it's all it's all good
[41:20] um God's a God of all Races we're the
[41:23] same after all that's what counts and he
[41:25] messes all that counts amongst the
[41:26] churches today is is members
[41:29] if we can have bigger numbers bigger
[41:31] members membership uh more more success
[41:34] that justifies anything we do to achieve
[41:38] that goal but different methods are
[41:40] going to lead to a different goal in the
[41:43] long run
[41:44] now this eating thing sacrifice to idols
[41:48] brother Brian says I don't say that this
[41:50] really means they were literally eating
[41:51] meat sacrificed to idols
[41:54] that there was a there was a an image of
[41:56] Baal there in the camp and they come and
[41:59] they they saute all the meat there
[42:01] before Bale and they and then they give
[42:03] it to the children of Israel it doesn't
[42:06] have to mean it doesn't have to mean
[42:08] that Paul didn't make such a big deal
[42:10] about the he says eating Meats those
[42:13] Idols are are are nothing Paul says the
[42:16] New Testament just a matter of
[42:17] conscience but when he says I see this
[42:19] in the same light I see the words of the
[42:21] Lord except to eat my flesh and drink my
[42:23] blood you have no life in you it wasn't
[42:25] literally calling his disciples to be
[42:27] cannibals man shall not live by bread
[42:30] alone by every word that proceeds out of
[42:31] the mouth of God you can see that eating
[42:33] is actually partaking in a spiritual
[42:36] sense so necessarily that they're down
[42:38] eating these steaks that have been
[42:40] offered to bail but they're per they're
[42:42] having Fellowship where there was no
[42:44] basis for Fellowship to be had they're
[42:47] going off and having Fellowship on the
[42:49] devil's territory they're going off and
[42:51] having Revival meetings in the local bar
[42:54] and they're getting on the devil's
[42:55] territory there and that's just not a
[42:58] good thing and gradually one thing led
[43:01] to another it says that is there any
[43:03] Moses is there any Commandment that says
[43:06] we can't do this and Moses probably was
[43:08] able to name some things I'm sure he was
[43:10] but yeah but that's for a little
[43:12] different setting a little different
[43:13] setting and they were able to carve
[43:14] themselves at a loophole so they could
[43:17] go down and have this Feast with their
[43:19] new neighbors but remember Baal the
[43:22] devil is the lord of the loophole so
[43:25] they found their way people who want to
[43:26] do wrong will always find a reason to do
[43:29] wrong they might even find a quote or a
[43:32] Bible verse to justify it and they'll
[43:34] say God's letting me do it I even got a
[43:37] raise because after I started working
[43:38] Wednesday nights and Sundays God this is
[43:41] this is fine don't sweat it I will
[43:43] stream anyway it'll be fine
[43:46] God's not the Lord the loophole God's
[43:49] the lord of the clear leadership the
[43:51] devil's the lord of the loophole so we
[43:52] can justify our way but that doesn't
[43:54] mean it's right
[43:56] and very gradually
[43:58] um
[43:59] it started with just stumbling blocks
[44:01] thinking ah
[44:03] God's word is just advice I can really
[44:05] do what I want
[44:07] I'm being blessed I'm getting good
[44:09] things from these decisions I'm making
[44:11] it must be God's will then it must be
[44:14] fine and then they start fellowshipping
[44:16] with with folks and being an atmosphere
[44:19] they really have no business to be in
[44:22] and then it goes from one thing to
[44:24] another before too long they're actually
[44:26] committing fornication which they never
[44:28] would have thought that they would be
[44:30] doing
[44:31] but sin as a way of taking you farther
[44:33] than you wanted to go keeping you longer
[44:36] than you wanted to stay costing more
[44:38] than you want to pay and the doctor of
[44:40] balance kind of leads you leads you
[44:42] leads you belong until you you're
[44:44] trapped
[44:48] the doctrine of Balaam leads to this
[44:50] fornication
[44:53] brother Branham continues in the church
[44:55] age book he says after uh that he says
[44:58] you can see the eating is actually
[44:59] partaking in a spiritual sense he said
[45:02] so when these people were bowing to the
[45:03] images lighting candles using pagan
[45:06] holidays
[45:07] that were renamed for Christians Saints
[45:10] confessing their sins to men all of
[45:13] which belong to the devil's religion he
[45:15] says they were partakers with the devil
[45:17] and not of the Lord
[45:19] Satan had substituted something else
[45:23] given a good purpose to it and then just
[45:26] whitewashed it something that sounded
[45:28] good
[45:28] but they were still on idolatry whether
[45:31] they admitted it or not they could talk
[45:34] all they wanted the altars and the
[45:35] Innocents are only to remind them of the
[45:37] prayers of the Lord and whatever they
[45:38] think it means and they can pray before
[45:40] the image they say it's just for the
[45:42] sake of emphasis when they confess their
[45:44] sins of the priests it's really just the
[45:46] God they're doing in their hearts and
[45:47] all these things they can say what they
[45:49] want but they're still partaking in the
[45:52] Babylonian satanic religion joining
[45:55] themselves to Idols committing spiritual
[45:58] fornication
[45:59] so Constantine here is substituting
[46:03] that's us
[46:05] when we hear what Constantine did
[46:07] renaming the holidays
[46:09] um all these different things that
[46:11] sounds that that sounds strange to us we
[46:13] would come up with that idea
[46:15] but that was not too strange in the
[46:17] culture they were in
[46:19] all costing is doing is the prevalent
[46:23] ideas of the culture and making them
[46:25] acceptable to the to to the church and
[46:28] going forward with it he's just
[46:30] substituting the religion of the culture
[46:33] for the gospel giving it Christian names
[46:36] giving a Christian a whitewash over all
[46:38] the mythology and inviting all the
[46:40] Bishops to unite with it all he was was
[46:43] combining the religion of the culture
[46:46] with Christianity
[46:48] and he still wants to do that today
[46:52] I've shared this uh this statement from
[46:54] William Booth before
[46:56] but he's looking at the 20th century he
[46:58] says the chief danger that confronts the
[47:00] coming Century will be religion without
[47:03] the Holy Ghost
[47:05] Christianity without Christ forgiveness
[47:08] without repentance
[47:10] salvation without regeneration
[47:13] politics without God
[47:15] heaven without hell
[47:17] they've taken the gospel out but they
[47:20] still call it religion still call it
[47:22] Christianity but there's no Holy Ghost
[47:24] there's no Christ there's no repentance
[47:27] but he wants to have good feelings he
[47:30] wants to have morality all these things
[47:31] but they're substituting something else
[47:33] for the gospel and he's seeing he's not
[47:36] saying it this way he's seeing the
[47:37] doctrine of Balaam coming in and he's
[47:39] seeing the the culture is going to take
[47:41] over Christianity and he's speaking
[47:43] really really clearly about this
[47:46] and I've shared before this most what
[47:49] most churches
[47:51] what many many churches
[47:53] talk about what many people want from
[47:56] from church nowadays is just um
[47:58] moralistic teaching
[48:02] therapeutic teaching that involves God
[48:04] somewhere really just just be nice to
[48:07] each other if we can just be nice then
[48:09] we're Christians right that's the
[48:10] essence of Christianity just love your
[48:12] neighbor just be nice
[48:15] and he says basically these these uh
[48:18] forget the article but um
[48:20] the tenets of this be nice religion is
[48:23] hey God made the world and watches over
[48:25] it God's up there he wants us to be good
[48:28] nice and fair he wants you to be happy
[48:31] and feel good about yourself if you
[48:33] don't feel good about yourself you're
[48:34] probably making a decision wrong
[48:36] somewhere but you know what when you
[48:39] come to your opinion you don't feel good
[48:40] about yourself when you hear about your
[48:43] sin you don't feel good about yourself
[48:45] when you hear about hell and judgment
[48:47] you don't feel good about yourself but
[48:48] that's the point we want to be able to
[48:51] sing Just As I Am Without One Plea we
[48:54] come to the altar just as we just as I
[48:57] am that God accepts us just as we are so
[48:59] we can leave just as we were but that's
[49:02] not the gospel he loves us too much for
[49:04] that he doesn't want us to say as we are
[49:07] he wants to transform us so that we can
[49:09] become what he wants us to be
[49:12] but we want to stay just as we are
[49:15] nice people will live happily ever after
[49:17] and God's cool with giving you your
[49:19] space
[49:21] but if you really need him he'll be
[49:22] there for you
[49:24] basically in this uh religion God is
[49:28] just a combination of a butler and
[49:30] therapist
[49:32] he does what you want him to do and
[49:34] makes you feel good about it in the
[49:36] process he's on call takes care of any
[49:39] problems that arise professionally helps
[49:41] people feel better about themselves not
[49:42] any real change doesn't get too
[49:44] personally involved in the process
[49:47] this is the religion of the culture
[49:50] creeping into the church just like the
[49:54] idolatry of that fourth Century crept
[49:57] into the church
[49:58] because God sees that there's a renewed
[50:01] God wants to sorry this the devil sees
[50:03] that God is trying to restore his
[50:06] Covenant with his people he's trying to
[50:08] restore fellowship with his people and
[50:10] they're almost into the promise saying I
[50:12] want to break that up now he's doing the
[50:15] very same thing he did in the days of
[50:17] Noah and the days of nimrod doing he did
[50:19] the same thing he did in the days of
[50:20] Moses in the days of Balaam same thing
[50:23] in the days of constant he's doing the
[50:25] same thing now so he could interrupt
[50:27] break apart that Fellowship
[50:30] and I just want to share a quotation
[50:33] from a a book called radical this was
[50:37] published in 2004 I Believe by a uh
[50:42] um I think he's a Baptist Minister David
[50:44] Platt
[50:45] and his thesis is that you are not
[50:48] worshiping the Jesus of the Bible that's
[50:50] what he's arguing in the book he says
[50:53] we've started to redefine Christianity
[50:56] we're giving in to the dangerous
[50:58] temptation to take the Jesus of the
[51:00] Bible and twist him into a version of
[51:02] Jesus that we're more comfortable with a
[51:04] nice middle class American Jesus
[51:08] a Jesus who doesn't mind materialism and
[51:10] who would never call us to give away
[51:12] everything we have
[51:14] a Jesus who would not expect us to
[51:16] forsake our closest relationships that
[51:18] he receives all our affection
[51:20] a Jesus who is fine with nominal
[51:22] devotion who just says I'm a Christian
[51:24] but does not infringe on our Comforts
[51:27] because after all he loves us just the
[51:29] way we are
[51:32] Jesus wants us to be balanced
[51:34] he wants us to avoid dangerous extremes
[51:37] and who for that matter wants us to
[51:39] avoid danger altogether
[51:41] we were wanting a Jesus who brings us
[51:43] comfort and prosperity as we live out
[51:45] our Christian spin on the American dream
[51:48] but do you and I realize what we're
[51:50] doing at this point we are molding Jesus
[51:53] into our image
[51:56] that's idolatry
[51:58] he's beginning to look a lot like us
[52:00] because after all that's who we're most
[52:03] comfortable with
[52:04] and the danger now
[52:06] is that when We Gather in our church
[52:09] buildings to sing and lift up our hands
[52:11] in worship we may not actually be
[52:14] worshiping the Jesus of the Bible
[52:16] instead we may be worshiping ourselves
[52:20] when I read this I think back to Second
[52:22] Thessalonians 2 where Satan is as God
[52:25] sitting in the temple of God thing
[52:27] making people worship him as though he
[52:29] is God
[52:30] right back to that and brother Branham
[52:32] says this very same thing decades
[52:35] earlier
[52:36] as the God of this world today the
[52:39] worshiped person of this world today is
[52:40] Satan and people are ignorant of
[52:42] worshiping Satan but it's Satan
[52:44] impersonating himself as the church
[52:48] they worship Satan thinking they're
[52:50] worshiping God through the church
[52:53] but that's the way Satan's done it and
[52:56] when I heard this quote growing up I
[52:58] thought man that's hard I don't see how
[53:00] that could be
[53:03] how it is and even people in
[53:06] denominational circles are awake to this
[53:09] this isn't right this isn't right we're
[53:11] trapped in the wrong system this is not
[53:13] the right way because we're not we don't
[53:15] want to worship an American Dream we
[53:17] want god of the Bible's different but
[53:19] brother Brandon pegged it decades ago
[53:22] because we we people are recreating
[53:25] Jesus in their own image and I was
[53:28] texting Sherry earlier this last week or
[53:31] so and she's got the song making up her
[53:34] own God as we go
[53:36] and his love means approval
[53:39] Mercy now condoned Murphy doesn't just
[53:43] forgive us it condones affirms what
[53:45] we're doing
[53:46] his loving kindness means never saying
[53:49] no God wouldn't say no because no hurts
[53:52] my feelings and God wants me to be happy
[53:55] we're making up her own God as we go his
[53:57] will means you're happy Christians
[54:00] always glow so if you're not glowing
[54:02] you need to adjust what you're doing
[54:04] doing what feels right must be good for
[54:07] the soul for making up her own God as we
[54:09] go let's be real
[54:12] sometimes we go by what we feel thinking
[54:14] God must think the way we do no his
[54:17] thoughts are so far above our thoughts
[54:19] we can't comprehend them we just say yes
[54:21] Lord
[54:22] lay aside the word let the conscience be
[54:25] your guide
[54:27] so you can feel right about it this
[54:29] making up your own version of Christ we
[54:32] blend in to win them that's the doctrine
[54:35] of Balaam
[54:36] worships just to show we're sharing in
[54:39] Jesus the Bible would know we're just
[54:41] making up our own God as we go
[54:45] peace is the answer
[54:47] God just wants you to have peace truth
[54:50] rocks the boat
[54:53] go tell the pastor to stop preaching
[54:56] because it's interrupting your peace
[54:58] just go with the flow we're making up
[55:00] our own God as we go
[55:04] and his ways are higher higher than
[55:06] we'll ever know so let's wake up don't
[55:10] make up our own God as we go
[55:12] she pegged in that song that song is
[55:16] describing the doctrine of Balaam
[55:21] I just want to close with one further
[55:23] point the doctrine of Balaam
[55:26] we can say that's really the permissive
[55:28] will of God
[55:30] charading
[55:31] as though it were the perfect will of
[55:33] God
[55:35] and on um sometimes we hear that we hear
[55:38] the quote
[55:39] um brother Brandon says and does God
[55:41] ever change his mind about the word if
[55:44] the people won't walk in this perfect
[55:45] will he does have a permissive will
[55:47] he'll let you walk in notice he permits
[55:50] it all right but he'll make it work out
[55:51] for his glory in his perfect will
[55:54] and I can imagine somebody's read that
[55:57] quote he says I can just breathe a sigh
[55:59] of relief because if I've made the if if
[56:02] I if I've missed God's perfect will
[56:03] he'll bring me right about right back
[56:06] into his perfect will everything will be
[56:07] all right
[56:09] and I think we can have a wrong idea
[56:12] what that means
[56:14] because really what the permissive will
[56:16] does it shows what's in our hearts
[56:20] it's going to show that you know we
[56:22] really don't want to do what God wants
[56:24] we really are looking for an excuse to
[56:26] do what we want to do
[56:29] the permissive will is really just
[56:31] exposing our own heart but we can take
[56:34] that statement the permissive will makes
[56:35] way for the perfect will so I can go
[56:37] ahead and take that risk because God
[56:39] will lead me back anyway because yeah
[56:41] all things work together for good right
[56:43] and God's a happily ever after kind of
[56:47] God right
[56:49] but I just want to emphasize this
[56:51] permissive will
[56:52] is dangerous we shouldn't approach you
[56:55] think oh God will make it work
[56:57] everything all right for me
[56:59] it's not that way he lets us go in the
[57:01] permissive will he did to the children
[57:04] of Israel here's the my people would not
[57:06] hearken to my voice Israel would none of
[57:08] me so I finally gave up under their own
[57:11] hearts lusts and they walked in their
[57:13] own councils and the Hosea he says
[57:15] Ephraim is joined unto Idols let him
[57:17] alone
[57:18] anybody any parent ever have their kids
[57:20] begged for something long enough long
[57:22] enough long I finally you're just sick
[57:23] of it go for it have fun go play
[57:26] and you said yeah go for it and you know
[57:28] they're gonna you know and you're doing
[57:30] it you're so upset and they're gonna
[57:31] it's not going to work out well for you
[57:32] just sick of it go for it you do that
[57:35] but that that that's not the perfect
[57:38] will by any means you just give them up
[57:41] to go do what you want brother Brandon
[57:43] says um
[57:45] he has a permission he has a permissive
[57:48] will
[57:49] now there is where the trouble Lays
[57:53] so we don't want to take this idea of
[57:54] the permissive Wellness oh it'll be fine
[57:56] in the end no we go to the permissive
[57:59] real route we're stepping into trouble
[58:03] we try to work on God's permissive will
[58:05] and he will permit it he says and he
[58:09] will make it work out to glorify his
[58:10] perfect will in some way
[58:12] let's keep on talking about this says he
[58:14] will give you the desire of your heart
[58:16] he promised that you know that he
[58:18] promised to give you the desire of your
[58:20] heart but you know what let your desire
[58:22] be the word of God let your desire be
[58:24] his will never your own will because if
[58:27] we keep asking God for something and he
[58:28] keeps saying no I don't want my own will
[58:33] because that'll be a rough way to go
[58:37] uh further in that same message as God
[58:40] ever changed his mind about his word he
[58:41] says he he Grant yes he grants you
[58:43] permission
[58:45] to to permit your will he gives a
[58:47] permissive will knowing what's in your
[58:49] heart
[58:50] knowing that you say well brother
[58:51] Brandon I do so on so and it doesn't
[58:53] bother me God blesses me every day I
[58:55] sing in the spirit I dance in the spirit
[58:57] hey he'll permit it if you keep wanting
[58:59] to go that way go ahead he'll permit it
[59:01] go ahead
[59:03] but you'll make it a stumbling block
[59:05] like Balaam did
[59:08] so this these statements together it
[59:11] seems like yeah his perfect will makes
[59:13] the way permissible makes way for the
[59:15] perfect will all things work together
[59:17] for good so God's is going to make it
[59:19] happily ever after ending for me
[59:22] that God is going to be like a Disney
[59:24] kind of God we can do whatever we want
[59:26] and we'll end up in the palace at the
[59:28] end anyway
[59:30] that's not how it is it sounds really
[59:33] good sounds really deceptive but that's
[59:35] not how that works
[59:39] in Esther chapter 4 and verse 14.
[59:44] um this is when Mordecai shares with her
[59:47] the plans of Haman it says would you
[59:50] need to go and talk to the king and that
[59:52] says I can't do that he hasn't invited
[59:55] me
[59:56] and Mordecai says if you hold your peace
[59:58] at this time
[1:00:00] enlargement Deliverance will arise from
[1:00:02] the to the Jews from another place
[1:00:04] you hold your peace God will let you
[1:00:07] hold your peace you have a choice you
[1:00:08] hold your peace that's fine you do that
[1:00:10] God will still take care of us your
[1:00:13] choice isn't going to interrupt God's
[1:00:15] perfect will of preserving the Jews
[1:00:16] that's not going to happen
[1:00:18] but you've chosen your role in it
[1:00:21] who knoweth whether you're come to the
[1:00:23] kingdom for such a time as this
[1:00:25] so our steps into God's permissive will
[1:00:28] won't prevent his perfect will from
[1:00:30] being accomplished
[1:00:32] but our time in the permissive will
[1:00:34] could affect our role and the unfolding
[1:00:39] of God's perfect will and that's
[1:00:41] important the impermissive will is
[1:00:44] nothing to be trifled with don't embrace
[1:00:46] the permissive Wills oh yeah it's still
[1:00:47] a form of God's will no he's letting you
[1:00:51] do what you want to do but the devil is
[1:00:53] the lord of the loophole and you'll pay
[1:00:54] for it and by God's grace he might bring
[1:00:57] you back but don't play around with that
[1:01:01] and then the at the end of the church
[1:01:03] age book in the last chapter
[1:01:05] um
[1:01:06] brother Branham talks about this real
[1:01:08] real clear he says today we have that
[1:01:10] very same thing women preachers
[1:01:12] organizations false Doctrine people
[1:01:14] worshiping God manifesting the spirit
[1:01:16] going right on like Balaam did claim it
[1:01:19] God spoke to them even when the
[1:01:21] commission receives his opposite to the
[1:01:23] revealed word I won't deny God spoke to
[1:01:25] them but it was just like when he spoke
[1:01:27] to Balaam that second time he knew that
[1:01:30] Balaam wanted his own heart's desire
[1:01:32] above the word and he gave it to him
[1:01:35] all the while in the end God was having
[1:01:38] his own way
[1:01:40] even so today God tells folks to go
[1:01:43] ahead in their own Hearts desires for
[1:01:45] they've already rejected the word
[1:01:47] but the will of God will be done
[1:01:49] regardless and that's the clearest
[1:01:51] expression I have found about the
[1:01:53] permissive will of God that will still
[1:01:55] make a way for God's perfect will to be
[1:01:57] glorified
[1:01:58] but that doesn't mean that we'll be
[1:02:00] right there if we choose the person
[1:02:01] above it we'll have an unvarnished place
[1:02:03] in there
[1:02:04] the permissible of God is nothing to be
[1:02:07] toyed with good
[1:02:09] so I just want to close we can be
[1:02:13] thankful for prophetic insights that we
[1:02:15] can see what the strategy of the Yemen
[1:02:17] if what the strategy of the enemy is he
[1:02:20] knows we're right on the cusp of the
[1:02:22] promise and right on the cusp of
[1:02:24] Eternity and just like for the children
[1:02:26] of Israel those three chapters where
[1:02:28] Balaam was trying to curse them that was
[1:02:30] parenthetical they didn't even see it
[1:02:32] they were making preparations getting
[1:02:35] ready to go across the river but they
[1:02:37] had prophetic Insight they had somebody
[1:02:39] there who was telling them don't do this
[1:02:41] don't do this that was that was Moses
[1:02:43] and we also have a discernment that's
[1:02:46] able to show us what's wrong with these
[1:02:49] kinds of statements the church world
[1:02:51] today is all they want is members
[1:02:52] brother Branham says the Balaam Doctrine
[1:02:55] going around today were just the same
[1:02:56] we're all Christians trying to bring
[1:02:58] Unity by politics and organization only
[1:03:01] the word of God brings Unity
[1:03:04] but when we know the time we're living
[1:03:05] in the end time evangelist message is
[1:03:08] not numbers
[1:03:09] the end time evangelist message is
[1:03:11] Malachi for it's a restoring that goes
[1:03:14] forth It's to jerk people out of the
[1:03:16] Creeds and bring them back to the
[1:03:18] original faith of the Pentecostal
[1:03:20] fathers
[1:03:21] the beauty of the church has not been
[1:03:24] the structure that's not the numbers the
[1:03:26] beauty of the church is in the character
[1:03:28] of the people and that's why God brings
[1:03:30] a word to restore people to the
[1:03:32] character that he wants them to have and
[1:03:35] we have a prophetic gift like this we
[1:03:37] can see the the scriptures that are
[1:03:38] playing out for our day what our rule is
[1:03:41] and we can see oh this is a strategy
[1:03:42] here to try to break our fellowship with
[1:03:44] God to break God's covenant relationship
[1:03:46] with us I want nothing to do with that
[1:03:48] as nice as it might sound it's not it
[1:03:51] because Balaam could make his words
[1:03:53] sound really nice
[1:03:55] but gra all the things he was trying to
[1:03:57] do were just a smoke screen
[1:03:58] to break people's fellowship with God so
[1:04:01] I just say just like Israel was right on
[1:04:03] the cusp of it in the promised land so
[1:04:06] are we and that just holds fast to the
[1:04:10] word that God's given us don't make up
[1:04:11] our own God as we go holds fast as God
[1:04:14] reveals himself in his word we don't
[1:04:16] want to change God to fit us God wants
[1:04:19] to change us go to God as we are so he
[1:04:22] can transform us into whom he wants us
[1:04:26] to be
[1:04:27] amen that's what we have for this
[1:04:29] evening trust you is a blessing Let's uh
[1:04:31] let's pray and I'll just uh write the
[1:04:33] musicians to come and brother Gideon
[1:04:36] Heavenly Father we thank you for this
[1:04:38] this example of Balaam and the children
[1:04:41] of Israel and
[1:04:43] just uh interesting how often this story
[1:04:46] is uh
[1:04:48] is reminded is that reminders are given
[1:04:52] of it throughout the New Testament
[1:04:53] multiple times just warnings with what
[1:04:56] happened at bill pior
[1:04:58] Lord I pray that you would help us to
[1:05:00] seek your perfect will o God
[1:05:02] Lord that we would have you be Lord of
[1:05:05] our hearts and we wouldn't be seeking
[1:05:06] out some loophole some excuse to do our
[1:05:08] own Will O God
[1:05:10] Lord I pray that you would help us to
[1:05:12] have clear discernment
[1:05:14] of what the what the culture is trying
[1:05:16] to uh to preach at us and that we would
[1:05:18] say no I don't want that I want to see
[1:05:20] exactly what God's word has Lord
[1:05:22] father I pray give us a greater hunger
[1:05:24] for that and Lord if someone here at
[1:05:27] night hasn't cracked open the their
[1:05:29] Bible or a message book or spent time
[1:05:32] with you or they pray that even this
[1:05:34] evening or in the morning they'd begin
[1:05:35] that that you just gradually break off
[1:05:38] the the skills from their eyes we could
[1:05:40] see clearly the day that we're living
[1:05:41] and we might know how we should live oh
[1:05:44] God Lord I ask your blessing upon each
[1:05:46] family in Jesus name
