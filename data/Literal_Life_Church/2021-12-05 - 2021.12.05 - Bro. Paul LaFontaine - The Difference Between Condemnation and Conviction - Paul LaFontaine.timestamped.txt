[0:00] 1 chapter 8 and verse 1.
[0:03] and we trust that you had a good week
[0:05] god has certainly been good to us we
[0:07] have what's much to come to church for
[0:09] and thank him for and worship we could
[0:11] never worship him enough for what he's
[0:13] done in our lives we appreciate him so
[0:15] much and we are looking forward to the
[0:16] lord's supper today
[0:18] at 3 30. amen remember i want you to
[0:20] have some testimonies if you do of
[0:22] personal victories in your life we're
[0:24] going to have some of that this evening
[0:25] maybe the choir can sing have some
[0:27] worship and time together testimonies
[0:29] and take the lord's supper together john
[0:32] chapter 8 and verse
[0:34] 1 jesus went unto the mount of olives
[0:37] and early
[0:39] in the morning he came again into the
[0:41] temple and all the people came unto him
[0:44] and he sat down and taught them
[0:46] and the scribes and pharisees brought
[0:48] unto him a woman taken in adultery and
[0:51] when they had set her in the midst they
[0:53] said unto him master
[0:55] this was
[0:56] this woman was taken in adultery
[0:59] in the very act
[1:01] and now moses and the law commanded us
[1:03] that such should be stoned
[1:06] but what sayest thou so you can imagine
[1:08] the position that they're trying to put
[1:10] jesus in here and you couldn't deny that
[1:13] that's exactly what the old testament
[1:14] law said
[1:16] and so they're bringing this
[1:18] woman for several reasons not just that
[1:20] they caught her in the act
[1:22] but they're testing
[1:24] jesus here verse six and then they said
[1:28] tempting him
[1:29] and that they might have to accuse him
[1:31] but jesus stooped down and with his
[1:33] finger wrote on the ground
[1:36] as though he heard them not
[1:38] so when remember jesus is looking into
[1:40] another dimension besides what's just
[1:42] going on he's seeing it from a different
[1:44] perspective
[1:46] and so he is he he wrote with his finger
[1:48] on the ground and as though he had heard
[1:50] them not so when they continued asking
[1:53] him he lifted up himself and said unto
[1:55] them he that is without sin among you
[1:58] let him first cast a stone at her
[2:01] and again he stooped down and wrote on
[2:04] the ground
[2:07] and they which heard it
[2:09] being convicted by their own conscience
[2:13] and today i want to speak about the
[2:15] difference between condemnation and
[2:17] conviction
[2:20] when they heard it being convicted by
[2:22] their own conscience
[2:24] went out one by one beginning at the
[2:26] eldest even unto the last and jesus was
[2:29] left alone
[2:31] and the woman standing in the midst when
[2:33] jesus had lifted up himself
[2:36] and saw none but the woman he said unto
[2:39] her
[2:40] woman
[2:40] where are those thine accusers hath no
[2:43] man condemn thee
[2:45] so there's the word condemnation there's
[2:47] a
[2:48] condemning and she said no man lord and
[2:52] jesus said unto her neither do i condemn
[2:55] thee
[2:56] go
[2:57] and sin no more
[3:00] so in this set of scriptures we have
[3:02] both
[3:03] both things going on we have
[3:05] condemnation
[3:06] but we have conviction
[3:08] and we must know the difference in that
[3:11] when jesus comes there's no condemnation
[3:15] but there is
[3:16] conviction amen father we pray you'll
[3:19] bless us today you know
[3:22] yesterday the joy it was to study it and
[3:24] to spend time with you and personal
[3:29] things lord just personal time with you
[3:33] lord i feel so grateful today that
[3:36] that early in my life lord
[3:40] you didn't condemn me
[3:43] i certainly deserved it lord
[3:48] and though i had a good upbringing and
[3:50] maybe not guilty of
[3:52] maybe the same things as this woman i
[3:55] was just as much a sinner
[3:58] and i remember you met me lord and
[4:02] i felt the conviction
[4:04] but i thank you today that you didn't
[4:06] condemn me
[4:08] didn't say i was finished
[4:11] but you love me today and i'm only
[4:13] standing today because of that love
[4:17] i pray today lord you'd visit us in this
[4:19] house
[4:21] i pray today you'll make your presence
[4:23] known
[4:25] to the person who feels unworthy to the
[4:28] person feels that they doesn't they
[4:30] don't deserve the gospel and they don't
[4:32] deserve your love
[4:34] i pray you'll minister to them and
[4:35] everyone else lord it's under the sound
[4:38] of our voice
[4:40] nor we can stand in a surefooted place
[4:42] today and that's upon the word of god
[4:45] lord minister strengthen bring victory
[4:47] bring deliverance
[4:49] bring strength to the weary heart
[4:52] lord i pray this will minister to many
[4:54] as you've give it to me i give it back
[4:56] to the people and we just thank you lord
[4:58] for your blessings looking forward to
[5:00] the great day to spend in your presence
[5:03] and in fellowship with you and if there
[5:05] is anything lord between us and you
[5:08] we just lay it at your cross today
[5:10] asked you lord to forgive us of it
[5:12] we love you father we just commit this
[5:14] day to you in jesus name amen
[5:18] amen god bless you may be seated
[5:22] someone asked me this question the other
[5:23] day
[5:25] um
[5:26] what's the difference between
[5:28] condemnation and
[5:29] conviction
[5:32] and
[5:33] i just said well that's a great question
[5:34] that's a great question and i hadn't
[5:36] really pondered it very much before
[5:39] sometimes when i say that's a great
[5:41] question because i don't really have the
[5:42] answer
[5:45] it's better to be honest right
[5:48] but i've been thinking about it ever
[5:49] since they asked me i've been thinking
[5:51] about it and then i begin to study it
[5:52] this week and begin to ponder and look
[5:54] at it and
[5:56] i think probably i could honestly answer
[5:58] it without study and i could honestly
[6:01] say that i can answer
[6:03] more from years of experience of serving
[6:05] the lord then rather the things in the
[6:07] word about it i can answer for years now
[6:10] serving the lord that the christian
[6:12] experiences that and as you grow and you
[6:13] mature god helps you to be able to
[6:15] understand the difference between
[6:17] conviction and condemnation
[6:19] and i've kind of grown into that so i
[6:21] can answer by knowing it only by
[6:22] experience
[6:24] and but i find in this subject of
[6:26] condemnation and conviction the waters
[6:28] get a little muddy a bit and they're
[6:30] interpreted the same way sometimes and
[6:32] they're looked at
[6:35] looked at the same way or they're
[6:36] interpreted the same way but they're
[6:38] very much are different things they are
[6:40] different and i think it's important for
[6:43] a believer that he knows and understands
[6:46] and if you don't understand the
[6:47] difference in conviction and
[6:49] condemnation
[6:50] satan will certainly interpret it to you
[6:54] and this is this is a these are subjects
[6:57] and this is a subject that that he likes
[6:59] to wreak havoc with with the christian
[7:02] any christian a christian that's uh
[7:04] struggling a christian that's maybe even
[7:06] on the mountain and victorious and doing
[7:09] very well and just staying filled with
[7:11] the spirit satan's still gonna fight you
[7:13] and a lot of times in this thing it's in
[7:15] this thing of condemnation it's in this
[7:17] thing of the difference in condemnation
[7:19] and conviction i trust i'll just try
[7:21] just trust me today to know and i trust
[7:24] that you trust me that satan does not
[7:26] like godly conviction
[7:29] so that's a sign right away that we know
[7:31] if it's godly conviction satan doesn't
[7:33] like that because he knows that leads to
[7:35] true it can lead to true repentance he
[7:38] knows that can lead to true victory and
[7:40] when you come to more victory satan's
[7:42] defeated so he doesn't like true
[7:43] conviction
[7:45] and and so these and many times these
[7:47] meanings are used sometimes the same but
[7:49] they're very different sometimes even
[7:52] ministers fail to clarify when they're
[7:54] preaching about condemnation or
[7:56] conviction and the the waters get a
[7:58] little bit muddy with us ministers and i
[7:59] just ask for forgiveness on behalf of
[8:02] ministers sometimes we don't clarify
[8:04] things and we don't present it the best
[8:06] way that we probably could and be led of
[8:08] the spirit to make sure that people
[8:10] understand because us ministers
[8:13] sometimes fail to clarify things enough
[8:15] and can preach condemnation
[8:19] many times and not realize it and preach
[8:20] the people under condemnation instead of
[8:23] letting the holy spirit do his work of
[8:25] conviction that's what we want that's
[8:27] what we desire in preaching the gospel
[8:30] is to preach the gospel and remember the
[8:32] prophet said that we don't save anybody
[8:35] a preacher doesn't save anybody
[8:37] a preacher doesn't heal anybody you were
[8:40] already saved 2 000 years ago at calvary
[8:43] you actually were saved before the
[8:45] foundation of the world in god's mind
[8:47] amen you're not saved the night that you
[8:49] give your heart to the lord you actually
[8:51] god had you in his mind you're saved
[8:52] back then and god purchased your
[8:54] salvation at calvary can i get into
[8:56] greater amen this morning and so we
[8:58] don't save people by preaching we're
[9:00] preaching to drive away the unbelieving
[9:02] devils that you're listening to and if
[9:04] you quit listening to them you get saved
[9:08] amen so we don't save anybody and we
[9:11] certainly don't want to preach
[9:13] condemnation to the people we preach so
[9:15] that the holy spirit can walk in the
[9:17] room and come in the room and bring
[9:18] conviction to all of our hearts where we
[9:21] are where we're short at what we need
[9:23] what we need in our lives and so
[9:25] conviction is a good thing can you say
[9:26] amen
[9:27] two of these things con i'm just making
[9:29] some opening statements here and then
[9:30] we'll get to preaching these two things
[9:33] condemnation and conviction are both
[9:36] very much a part of the christian
[9:37] experience how many could raise your
[9:39] hand and say that these things are very
[9:41] much a part of the christian experience
[9:43] condemnation and conviction
[9:45] and they they are spoken of uh in the
[9:48] word of god they're certainly spoken of
[9:50] in the word of god and they very much
[9:52] need to be talked about because they are
[9:53] both quite often
[9:55] both of these things are quite often and
[9:57] most the time happening in our lives on
[10:00] a subconscious level
[10:04] and conviction happen at a subconscious
[10:06] level not necessarily on a conscious
[10:09] level and because they are on a
[10:11] subconscious level the devil can mix
[10:14] things up and the devil can defeat
[10:15] people because it's happening not on a
[10:18] visible level but at a subconscious
[10:20] level and how many know as brother
[10:22] branham taught us that we as christians
[10:24] have to have our subconscious in line
[10:26] with our conscience can you say man we
[10:29] can't be saying we believe out here and
[10:31] we're a christian out here and we got
[10:33] doubt down here in our spirit we've got
[10:35] to get this spirit of subconscious
[10:37] believing just like our words are
[10:39] believing
[10:40] i believe this message i believe christ
[10:42] i believe this word well our spirit has
[10:45] to believe it too and our life has to
[10:47] testify out of it as well
[10:49] and that's when we're moving into
[10:51] something the devil is afraid of but
[10:53] it's a subconscious and i just say this
[10:55] about a subconscious level you're
[10:56] growing in the lord if you're not
[10:58] ignoring your subconscious
[11:01] what's happening in the subconscious
[11:03] with you is what's really happening
[11:07] and the prophet taught us that that's
[11:09] what's really happened you can have a
[11:10] lot of things on the surface but what's
[11:12] happening below the surface is what's
[11:14] really happening and so uh so this is
[11:18] it's it's eternal it can be an internal
[11:21] battle and everyone everyone because
[11:24] everyone has a soul
[11:25] and thus a place that that that
[11:29] that god has the potential for god to
[11:31] dwell
[11:32] uh
[11:33] everyone has a soul and thus they have a
[11:34] place
[11:36] that that they can be connected to god
[11:39] and to even be approved by god every
[11:41] person and that's why this not only
[11:43] affects christians but it affects people
[11:44] who are unbelievers as well because they
[11:47] have a soul and if you have a soul you
[11:49] have a place for god
[11:50] if you have a soul there's a longing
[11:52] within you to be approved of god to be
[11:54] accepted of god
[11:58] and it's funny people will spend their
[11:59] whole lives doing things and giving to
[12:02] charities and doing good things and
[12:03] they're straightening their life out and
[12:05] all it is they have a soul they want to
[12:06] be pleasing to god and so they're doing
[12:08] all these works and it's because of a
[12:09] craving i want to be accepted by god i
[12:12] want to make it into heaven i want to be
[12:13] a good person i want to be and all of us
[12:16] have this craving how can i be accepted
[12:18] by god how can it be approved of god
[12:20] having the approval of god almighty is
[12:23] everything in life
[12:26] but oh we can spend our whole lives
[12:28] trying to reach for other things to get
[12:29] god's approval and and complicate things
[12:32] and work so hard and i can tell you as a
[12:35] gospel minister this morning it's much
[12:37] more simple than what you're making it
[12:39] to get god's approval
[12:42] and as a matter of fact when you really
[12:44] look at it god did not look at you to
[12:47] try to get his approval he already took
[12:49] care of it at calvary
[12:52] can i get an amen
[12:55] so you can't work to get god's approval
[12:58] he took care of it himself
[13:04] now i'm going to start preaching
[13:08] but man wants to be connected with god
[13:11] and they wants the approval of god
[13:13] to be rejected and to be disapproved
[13:16] to know that god is not approving of to
[13:18] you to know that god is he he's
[13:22] he's condemning you and god is writing
[13:24] you off and god is cutting you off and i
[13:27] i can't get reconnected with god and
[13:29] just the human spirit has a hard time
[13:31] with that i know there's some real
[13:33] extreme cases where you know
[13:36] solomon says in uh
[13:38] in proverbs the fool hath said in his
[13:42] heart
[13:42] there is no god that's like the last age
[13:45] of a fool and if you read proverbs
[13:47] you'll see stages of a fool a fool
[13:50] starts doing this and a full star but
[13:51] the final stage of a fool is basically
[13:54] he says there is no god
[13:56] now that's an extreme case nobody in
[13:58] here is underneath that category nobody
[14:01] in here is in that stage i just don't
[14:02] believe it but you can come to that
[14:04] there's no god i don't need god and
[14:07] that's the biggest lie a person can take
[14:09] on to themself is they don't need god
[14:11] god gave you a soul for him to dwell in
[14:14] can you say man and you need god living
[14:16] in that soul
[14:21] so
[14:22] the spirit of fear
[14:24] has its heyday
[14:26] in our subconscious
[14:31] trying to figure things out
[14:35] luther was an example of this
[14:38] in his uh martin luther was an example
[14:40] of this in his inward struggle if
[14:42] anybody's ever read his diaries or his
[14:45] life or what he
[14:46] and especially the days you can watch a
[14:48] couple movies on it i think don luther
[14:50] on luther but if you watch his life
[14:52] before he really had an experience with
[14:55] god this man struggled he felt like that
[14:57] some of the other priests thought he had
[14:59] demons bother him and he even admitted
[15:01] to it it's just this constant and he's
[15:03] doing all the right things and he's
[15:04] fasting and he's sacrificing he's just
[15:06] doing all this stuff and he could not
[15:09] get peace with god no matter what he did
[15:11] of course he was in a church that was
[15:13] that was performance based that was
[15:15] works related he was in the catholic
[15:17] church that everything you did to get
[15:19] acceptance with god was doing something
[15:21] burning a candle going to confession
[15:23] doing all the stuff and so that's all he
[15:25] knew growing up he had a decent
[15:27] upbringing but that's all he was taught
[15:29] and then when he came into the church to
[15:30] be a priest then they taught him all
[15:31] that over again you got to keep now you
[15:33] got now they added about 50 things that
[15:35] he had to do to get approval from god
[15:37] but he was not at peace do you know that
[15:39] that mother teresa was the same way they
[15:42] put out a thing of some of her diaries
[15:43] after she died here's a woman that
[15:45] affected so many and feeding the poor
[15:47] and her life was a great testimony of
[15:49] what a person can sacrifice and do for
[15:52] her life is incredible but now you read
[15:54] her her things and she never she never
[15:56] got peace with god she had an internal
[15:59] struggle the whole time she never could
[16:02] find full approval from god
[16:05] and in these diaries now reveal she's
[16:07] crying out she just she can't get peace
[16:09] and she's helping the whole world she's
[16:10] helping the orphans in all of india but
[16:13] she never had a subtleness she never
[16:15] could get that peace
[16:18] and luther if you read it he was the
[16:20] same way this internal fear that god has
[16:23] not accepted me and he lived under such
[16:25] a
[16:26] performance-based upbringing and a
[16:28] works-based church
[16:31] associated and he associated works with
[16:33] his connection with god it was bait all
[16:35] based on works he could never do enough
[16:38] he could never do enough and so he
[16:39] battled and then one day one day
[16:43] look reading in romans
[16:45] justification
[16:46] was revealed to him
[16:49] true justification was revealed to him
[16:51] and it was just simple and that is that
[16:53] in in christ in christ
[16:56] was a finished work that christ did
[17:01] so he's going how can i have all these
[17:03] things that i have to gain and try to
[17:05] get approval from god and yet in christ
[17:07] it's showing in romans that
[17:09] that when christ was crucified he died
[17:12] for all of my sins and my approval was
[17:15] in that when god approved christ at
[17:17] calvary when god approved that sacrifice
[17:20] then he proved of me
[17:24] oh i should be getting some greater
[17:26] amens this morning
[17:28] hopefully in about 20 minutes i can quit
[17:30] preaching we can just start shouting
[17:31] because you need to know that this isn't
[17:34] a performance-based religion this isn't
[17:36] a works-based religion
[17:39] this is the finished work of what christ
[17:42] has done for your life
[17:43] and when that love overwhelms you and
[17:45] begin to notice what he's done then it's
[17:48] not a prophet problem living a life
[17:50] worthy of the gospel because i'm not
[17:52] living a life worthy to get acceptance
[17:54] i'm saying i value it i appreciate it
[17:57] and my love says i want to do everything
[17:59] to love him back
[18:02] [Applause]
[18:06] hallelujah
[18:09] so what a testimony you can read
[18:11] luther's life
[18:13] that the very best
[18:15] of our very best
[18:18] performance
[18:20] will always
[18:22] fall short
[18:24] and never
[18:26] fully satisfy
[18:34] that the very best
[18:36] of our efforts the very best of our very
[18:39] best
[18:40] religious efforts and giving
[18:43] and sacrifice
[18:45] still
[18:46] will always
[18:47] fall short
[18:51] and never
[18:52] fully satisfy
[18:55] god
[18:59] so god came
[19:02] and he brought a satisfied approval of
[19:05] his sons
[19:07] by what he did at the
[19:08] cross luther sees romans and it said in
[19:12] there
[19:13] therefore
[19:14] and i don't have time to read go back
[19:17] and read before romans 8 where he says
[19:19] therefore because as brother lonnie used
[19:21] to say go see what the therefore is
[19:24] there for.
[19:27] because he said hold something for seven
[19:29] chapters leading up to this conclusion
[19:31] therefore
[19:32] there is now
[19:33] no
[19:34] condemnation
[19:41] but but but no no there's no buts about
[19:43] it there is therefore no condemnation
[19:47] none
[19:49] to them who are in christ jesus
[19:53] who walk not after the flesh
[19:55] but walk after his word
[19:59] so where's this condemnation coming from
[20:04] where's this where's the origin of this
[20:06] condemning
[20:08] accusing
[20:09] voice
[20:10] in your mind
[20:12] if you don't get anything else today i
[20:14] can tell you
[20:16] that voice does not come from
[20:18] god and it does not come from this word
[20:25] so he says i'll take care of it and
[20:27] root luther read therefore there is now
[20:29] no condemnation to them in christ
[20:31] and walking out the flesh but after the
[20:33] spirit therefore here's another place
[20:34] therefore being justified by faith in
[20:37] his son
[20:38] we have
[20:40] peace
[20:42] where where do we have peace at in the
[20:45] soul
[20:46] my mind not may not have peace every day
[20:50] based upon watching too much of the news
[20:54] based upon my kids not doing what i want
[20:56] them to do
[20:58] based upon i don't have enough to meet
[20:59] my bills
[21:02] should i name 10 other things that
[21:04] happened to you this week
[21:07] my my peace is not always completely
[21:09] settled in my mind and in my spirit but
[21:12] in my soul god has provided a complete
[21:15] settledness
[21:17] a complete rest
[21:20] therefore being justified by faith not
[21:23] by our works but by faith in his son and
[21:25] his finished work at calvary we have
[21:27] peace where in our souls it settles it
[21:30] when i am truly in christ not by
[21:33] religion but i'm in christ i'm in his
[21:35] word and i've i'm trusting in that and
[21:38] i'm living that then i am in another
[21:40] category i move myself out of the
[21:43] category of being under condemnation in
[21:46] the condemnation of the world i'm not in
[21:48] the category of being condemned with the
[21:50] world i'm in when i'm in christ i'm in
[21:52] another category i am no longer
[21:55] condemned by god
[21:58] there is therefore no condemnation to
[22:00] them which are in christ jesus
[22:03] and i'm in another category because it
[22:06] settles it and it brings peace it brings
[22:09] peace can you say amen how many can
[22:11] raise your hands that i know what that
[22:12] peace is all about i've experienced i
[22:14] know what it means to have peace in my
[22:18] soul in the midst of the storms of life
[22:20] there's peace in my soul i'm settled in
[22:23] my soul there's never a question about
[22:25] where i'm going there's never a question
[22:27] about the rapture
[22:28] [Applause]
[22:32] brother marcus becker preached a
[22:33] wonderful message friday down in uh down
[22:36] in lima just a couple weeks ago and i
[22:38] was just astounded but he was he was
[22:40] along some of these lines and i was so
[22:41] ministered too but i'll tell you there's
[22:44] there's a rest there's a peace and he
[22:45] said there seems to be a fear of people
[22:47] i won't make the rapture i won't make
[22:49] the rapture and he had a beautiful
[22:50] thought he said this is based upon the
[22:52] love of god this is a baseball and god
[22:53] said no no no my people my people
[22:56] because they're in christ they're
[22:57] already a part of the rapture we're not
[22:59] working our way to a rapture
[23:04] what is this fear that says i've got to
[23:07] do more to make the rapture
[23:14] praise the lord
[23:16] you know i just want to settle down and
[23:17] just smile right now because i know that
[23:20] i am giving the devil a huge
[23:23] boot in the rear
[23:26] a black eye i know he doesn't like this
[23:32] and hopefully by the end of this service
[23:34] you'll trust me and you'll be smiling
[23:36] too can you say amen
[23:38] because the devil has some of you bound
[23:39] but you need to say you say this is the
[23:41] word of god this is what he said about
[23:44] me
[23:44] i'm accepted in the beloved i'm accepted
[23:47] because the sacrifice was accepted
[23:50] [Applause]
[23:52] the same one who stood in that boat with
[23:55] the disciples and reached forth at the
[23:57] end of the boat and said peace be still
[24:00] and he calmed the storm the same one is
[24:02] here today and can say peace be still to
[24:06] your soul
[24:08] the same one is here
[24:11] and if he can speak to a literal storm
[24:13] he can speak to the storm in your soul
[24:17] let you raise your hand say i accept
[24:18] that in the name of the lord jesus
[24:20] christ i accept it
[24:22] i may not understand everything you're
[24:24] saying preacher but i accept it i need
[24:26] it
[24:27] same one who spoke to the storm spokes
[24:29] to the storm in your soul
[24:31] said peace be still because therefore
[24:33] being justified
[24:35] by faith in the son of god we have peace
[24:38] maybe not in the spirit level all the
[24:40] time but in the soul
[24:42] it's a settled
[24:44] deal so
[24:48] the approval thing my judgment of your
[24:50] sin
[24:52] jesus says my judgment of your sin was
[24:54] fully satisfied by my son's death at the
[24:57] cross that's what god says god says my
[25:00] judgment of your sin because sin has to
[25:01] be judged the soul that sinneth it shall
[25:04] die
[25:04] that's bible that's the word
[25:07] the soul that sinneth it shall die but
[25:09] he says my judgment of your sin was
[25:12] fully satisfied by my son's death at the
[25:15] cross when i approved of him then i
[25:18] approved of you
[25:21] we actually were born with a cloud
[25:24] and that's why this condemnation is so
[25:26] important to talk about it because
[25:28] before you did anything wrong
[25:31] before you did sins plural
[25:34] before your first lie
[25:36] before
[25:37] you did things like me like stealing
[25:40] twinkies out of the cupboard
[25:42] or off the twinkie truck before i did
[25:45] any of that
[25:47] my life was condemned when i was born
[25:52] i was born under a cloud of condemnation
[25:55] before i did anything wrong because my
[25:58] daddy my the first adam
[26:01] he fell he fell he felt he he fell with
[26:04] her and when they fell i inherited all
[26:08] of this condemnation
[26:11] that's why brother brown says he says
[26:12] what what happened in the garden you
[26:14] can't even repent of that we repent of
[26:16] our sins that we've done but we can't
[26:18] repent of that serpent nature that we
[26:20] have because we didn't even do it
[26:23] you still got to repent of it
[26:25] but he says you can't even repent of
[26:27] that
[26:29] which lets me know that i can't even
[26:31] take care of an inherent
[26:33] condemnation that i was born with as a
[26:35] little baby hanging over my soul that i
[26:37] am condemned and un unacceptable to god
[26:41] the day i was born it's hard to look at
[26:43] those little babies and say in soul
[26:45] level they're unacceptable god oh my
[26:47] goodness wow
[26:50] but in a soul level unless they come to
[26:52] a new birth
[26:53] they still got condemnation on them
[26:55] adam's condemnation
[26:57] brother brown preached that condemnation
[26:58] by representation so one man represented
[27:02] us all and we all got the boatload of
[27:04] condemnation from one guy and one gal
[27:07] that failed
[27:09] and it'd just come over and it come over
[27:11] and come over in 2021 all of a sudden
[27:14] we're born with this condemnation on us
[27:16] whether we've done anything wrong or not
[27:18] so you sitting here that's done a bunch
[27:20] of stuff wrong drugs and needles and
[27:22] and adultery and
[27:25] okay
[27:26] you you did a lot of bad things okay
[27:29] we don't want to hear about them
[27:31] we just want to testify what god's doing
[27:33] in your life now
[27:34] but we got people in this room do a lot
[27:36] of bad things some of them i know i
[27:38] thought but you were bad
[27:41] you're a bad case and then we got some
[27:43] that over here that didn't i'm not
[27:45] talking about on this side of the
[27:47] building
[27:47] we've got some over here that are goody
[27:49] two shoes they didn't do too much wrong
[27:52] aren't you glad you sat in this side
[27:53] today
[27:55] sat in the right spot man
[27:57] no i'm gonna let you know that these
[27:59] over here that are really bad
[28:01] and these over here that didn't do too
[28:03] many things bad are just as bad as these
[28:06] over here
[28:08] condemned
[28:10] unacceptable to god
[28:13] so we get this thing like elijah and oh
[28:15] he's such a great man and elijah spirit
[28:17] coming on the prophet this day such a
[28:19] great man no and yet we heard the
[28:21] scripture on wednesday night such a
[28:23] wonderful message make sure you listen
[28:24] to it elijah was a man subject to like
[28:27] passions as we are
[28:29] weaknesses human weaknesses a temper got
[28:31] down in his spirit got depressed read
[28:33] about it
[28:35] and yet god heard his prayer
[28:38] god closed up the heavens and god heard
[28:40] his prayer god open up the heavens god
[28:42] heard his prayer because it wasn't based
[28:44] upon his righteousness it was based upon
[28:46] god's righteousness
[28:48] [Music]
[28:50] so we're on the same boat elijah elijah
[28:53] was born with condemnation
[28:55] moses was born with this spirit
[28:57] unacceptable to god it's all and
[28:59] unacceptable to him it's condemnation by
[29:02] representation but bring up that quote
[29:03] if you would back there because i'm
[29:05] going to show you where he said now if
[29:06] one person can cause all that
[29:08] condemnation then it's the same as true
[29:10] that one person doing the right thing
[29:13] can cause the righteousness of god to
[29:15] come on my life
[29:18] if i was declared condemned by adam and
[29:21] what he did in eve then i can be
[29:23] declared righteous by the act of one man
[29:30] that's it
[29:32] that's in man he can't help being what
[29:34] he is because he's born in that
[29:35] condition man is represented in heaven
[29:38] as a sinner by a sinner i was speaking
[29:40] on this some time ago and someone said
[29:42] then that's not just if i'm to be
[29:44] represented by one man's disobedient
[29:47] that i don't have a chance i said that's
[29:49] true because you're born a sinner but
[29:52] you are represented you were represented
[29:54] by adam you are condemned to
[29:56] condemnation by representation
[30:00] well then that looks very cruel but turn
[30:03] it on the other side then we are
[30:05] ordained to eternal life
[30:07] by representation
[30:10] where one represents us to death another
[30:13] represents us unto eternal life so it
[30:16] puts us back again
[30:18] before
[30:20] the throne again
[30:26] but what do i need to do to do that no
[30:28] it
[30:29] that act
[30:31] it puts you back before the throne again
[30:40] [Applause]
[30:47] getting brother diggs spirit up here
[30:52] you know he'd be shouting brother dicks
[30:55] you ought to say praise the lord this
[30:56] morning you ought to say thank you lord
[30:59] for your word that's the word and it's
[31:00] true
[31:02] hallelujah
[31:04] blessed be his name
[31:08] he paid for my sin it's pain and full
[31:10] [Applause]
[31:13] something that we couldn't even repent
[31:16] of god says because you can't even
[31:18] repent of it i'll take care of that
[31:21] serpent nature i'll go to calvary i'll
[31:24] give my life and i will be satisfied
[31:27] [Applause]
[31:29] and if you'll believe and come to a new
[31:31] birth
[31:32] i'll get rid of that serpent nature and
[31:35] i'll put my nature down on the inside
[31:38] [Music]
[31:44] hallelujah
[31:48] but in my experience
[31:50] with this rotten enemy
[31:52] that i'm giving a black eye to today in
[31:54] my experience with him i don't know
[31:56] about your experience that even after a
[31:58] person has found peace in their soul
[32:02] satan
[32:04] can bring this trouble struggle up again
[32:08] in the minds of christians
[32:13] the struggle between condemnation and
[32:15] conviction
[32:17] not understanding it
[32:19] and
[32:20] the galatians in the bible are an
[32:22] example
[32:23] the galatians are an example if you read
[32:26] the book of galatians these were
[32:29] heathens
[32:30] that had come to the same new birth that
[32:32] paul was preaching to the jews
[32:35] the jews had way too much of their
[32:37] religion still in them when they came to
[32:38] the lord they had the holy ghost but
[32:39] they had way too much religion
[32:41] and they were going to require the
[32:42] galatians to get circumcised to try to
[32:44] become a jew and paul's saying
[32:46] we're not trying to become jews here
[32:48] we're trying to become christians
[32:50] so don't require that
[32:52] some of them when did someone and all of
[32:54] a sudden this cloud come over the
[32:55] galatians by the brothers in jerusalem
[32:58] by the preachers
[33:04] preachers with the holy ghost
[33:06] but hadn't grown out of their
[33:08] traditionalism
[33:10] oh boy is somebody going to say amen
[33:13] preachers with the holy ghost
[33:17] but not mature enough yet
[33:19] to learn how to preach the people
[33:21] under the right thing but to take the
[33:24] message and preach these galatians under
[33:26] condemnation
[33:28] so they're coming they're all under a
[33:30] cloud and paul meets them in galatians
[33:32] says why are you guys so depressed
[33:34] what's happened well the brothers in
[33:36] jerusalem been preaching this and we
[33:38] need to be circumcised in this and and
[33:40] paul says
[33:42] who hath bewitched you
[33:45] i'm quoting from your bible now
[33:48] this is the words he used bewitched is a
[33:50] spell
[33:52] the preachers in jerusalem preaching the
[33:54] wrong way cast a spell on the minds of
[33:58] the galatians
[33:59] that caused them to think that they
[34:01] would be condemned and unacceptable to
[34:03] god if they didn't get circumcised and
[34:05] follow the jewish ways
[34:09] who hath bewitched you that you could
[34:11] believe everything he starts reminding
[34:13] them their new birth he says
[34:15] you were birthed you didn't have any of
[34:17] that are you got you got born again
[34:18] experienced you've been birthed by the
[34:20] word did you come to liberty
[34:22] yeah we were so free it was just simple
[34:25] we came to your message paul we believe
[34:27] the gospel jesus christ i can remember
[34:30] services where we were shouting and
[34:31] feeling free in the spirit calvary saved
[34:34] me calvary did the work
[34:36] and now we're all bound and lost our
[34:38] liberty and paul says well then i'm here
[34:41] to tell you stand fast in the liberty
[34:45] when christ set you free
[34:47] get back to where your standing is
[34:54] and stop letting these men preach you
[34:56] under condemnation you were free before
[34:59] stand in the liberty christ has made you
[35:01] free and be not entangled again
[35:06] [Music]
[35:07] with the yoke of bondage
[35:11] again
[35:12] they were entangled by the yoke of
[35:14] bondage in the world came to the message
[35:17] and got a new birth but now they're
[35:19] entangled by the yoke of bondage again
[35:22] a religious yoke of bondage
[35:26] everybody understand what i'm saying
[35:28] so the devil will not leave alone
[35:31] christians that have the holy ghost to
[35:33] still work in the realm of condemnation
[35:35] to make them feel condemned the
[35:37] galatians our example read your bible
[35:39] this week and find out if that's not
[35:40] true it's i'm so glad that book is in
[35:42] the bible i'm so glad of it for the
[35:44] message because sometimes in pockets of
[35:46] our
[35:47] our group we find the same type of
[35:49] things going on and that's very
[35:51] unfortunate to have to say that
[35:52] truthfully but we find that we must not
[35:55] as ministers preach the people under
[35:57] condemnation we must never use the word
[36:00] to preach them under condemnation and a
[36:02] final
[36:03] uh striking you're unapproved by god
[36:06] your final you've crossed the line if
[36:08] you do this we cannot cannot preach that
[36:11] way to the bride of jesus christ
[36:15] we can preach
[36:16] we can preach all the word we can preach
[36:18] when people we can bring correction of
[36:20] the holy spirit the conviction of the
[36:22] holy spirit could convict somebody i
[36:23] need to be corrected we can preach
[36:25] correction but don't you dare preach
[36:28] condemnation to a bride who's been
[36:30] declared the pure virtuous bride of
[36:33] jesus christ
[36:34] [Applause]
[36:42] sometimes we have to preach to us
[36:44] preachers too
[36:46] not just to the congregations
[36:50] so
[36:51] you can see why knowing the difference
[36:53] between condemnation and conviction is
[36:55] important to a christian's victory how
[36:57] many would agree now
[36:58] it's important to your victory this
[37:00] morning if you want victory in christ
[37:02] we've got to talk about this
[37:03] condemnation and conviction
[37:06] i've seen someone truly led into a real
[37:10] conviction of the holy spirit in
[37:12] services or sometimes out of services
[37:16] and it's real conviction and they're
[37:18] quickly they quickly label it that
[37:22] they're feeling condemned
[37:25] because they've been taught wrong
[37:28] truly convicted by the holy spirit in a
[37:30] service
[37:31] and if they're not taught right i'm
[37:33] feeling condemned i'm feeling condemned
[37:35] i'm leaving so they go out the door they
[37:37] don't repent
[37:38] and they label it condition i'm not
[37:40] coming to that church and i'm not going
[37:42] to let my kids come to that church
[37:43] because it's all just condemnation
[37:46] in some cases it might be
[37:48] but now i'm trying to bring the contrast
[37:50] to what conviction is that's why you
[37:52] need to know the difference
[37:54] and so you can be led by real conviction
[37:57] and then quickly label it condemning and
[37:59] missed the door of repentance
[38:02] i've seen parents coddle their children
[38:06] that have been moved by true godly
[38:08] sorrow for their sin
[38:10] 14 15 26 years old
[38:14] they've been moved by real
[38:17] godly conviction and the parents coddle
[38:19] them
[38:20] and think that they're being done wrong
[38:23] and they need to shield their kids from
[38:25] that
[38:26] what a big mistake
[38:29] kids won't be responsible for that the
[38:30] parents will be responsible for it
[38:32] because you don't understand the
[38:33] difference in conviction and
[38:34] condemnation
[38:38] you might have led your kid away from a
[38:40] true repentant heart to go on with the
[38:42] lord because you labeled it they're
[38:44] hurting you
[38:46] big mistake
[38:48] let me say it clearly conviction of the
[38:50] holy spirit and correction of the holy
[38:52] spirit when it's done in love and it's
[38:54] done by god his holy spirit
[38:58] is never something to protect yourself
[39:00] from
[39:05] it's something to embrace
[39:07] this i've been doing this for whatever
[39:09] now 40 years serving the lord i have
[39:12] never regretted god coming and
[39:14] convicting my heart it doesn't feel good
[39:17] sometimes i get a spanking from papa
[39:20] it does not feel good when it's
[39:21] happening but i have never regretted the
[39:24] lord's holy spirit coming and convicting
[39:27] my heart and says you're guilty of doing
[39:29] that i said lord i can't hide it i'm
[39:31] guilty forgive me lord i've never
[39:33] regretted it i've never wanted to run
[39:36] from it i wouldn't i wouldn't want to
[39:38] look at a life without that in my life
[39:41] without the correction of the holy
[39:42] spirit and godly people to correct me do
[39:45] you want to live without the correction
[39:47] of god do you want to live without
[39:49] conviction do we want to have a church
[39:51] without conviction
[39:53] absolutely not
[39:54] but the church world has removed all
[39:56] those things to make everybody feel
[39:59] comfortable
[40:01] give them the right music and give them
[40:03] the right things and pat them on the
[40:05] back every service don't talk about this
[40:07] don't talk about that whatever's
[40:09] offensive politically or any way don't
[40:12] talk about it and their churches fill up
[40:14] because that's the way they've
[40:16] reinvented jesus for the people we don't
[40:18] want that kind of atmosphere we want the
[40:21] true holy ghost among us to do what he
[40:24] wants to do
[40:27] i don't know where my life would be
[40:29] today
[40:30] without
[40:32] the conviction of the holy spirit
[40:35] i wouldn't want to know
[40:37] and me repenting and me obeying it it's
[40:39] glorious it's wonderful it's painful it
[40:42] hurts it's exposing
[40:45] when we give our kids a spanking
[40:49] then we always say this is going to hurt
[40:51] you hurt me honey more than it's gonna
[40:53] hurt you
[40:54] and you know the kid's thinking it's
[40:56] hard really
[40:58] how can this be hurting you
[41:01] how many thought that when you were a
[41:02] kid
[41:04] classic statement of parents honey this
[41:05] is going to hurt me then it's going to
[41:07] hurt me man i hate to do this
[41:13] and they're going ah
[41:15] how does this hurt you more than me
[41:19] some of us got
[41:20] some of us didn't get enough spankings
[41:22] when we were kids
[41:24] some of us maybe got too many
[41:27] but it's all over now
[41:30] some of us got too harsh of spankings
[41:32] some parents took their anger out on us
[41:36] but you know what if you're where you're
[41:37] at today you have a love for god love
[41:40] for his word
[41:42] then you just let that all wash and say
[41:44] i needed it i took it i needed it i'm
[41:48] not gonna mull over it can you say man
[41:51] i am what i am by the grace of god
[41:53] help me a lot lord not to beat my
[41:55] children so harshly i'm
[41:58] i'm looking to the future to do better
[42:00] things but you know what i am what i am
[42:02] by the grace of god today and i'm not
[42:04] looking at the past i'm looking at the
[42:06] future with my lord somebody give praise
[42:09] to the lord this morning blessed be his
[42:11] name
[42:16] there is no perfect parent
[42:19] you didn't have them i didn't have them
[42:21] and guess what you're not a perfect
[42:23] parent either
[42:27] that's why we need the
[42:28] lord praise the lord i'm having a good
[42:31] time this morning i know about you but
[42:33] i'm glad to be here i'm having a good
[42:34] time in the lord
[42:35] [Applause]
[42:37] so then you see
[42:39] there's one
[42:40] on the other side of it maybe they don't
[42:42] catch the conviction of the lord they
[42:43] read it as condemnation but then we see
[42:45] ones trying to live a christian life
[42:47] under condemnation
[42:50] but not conviction they're trying to
[42:52] live the christian life under
[42:53] condemnation but not the conviction of
[42:55] the holy spirit
[42:57] and satan makes all the waters real
[42:59] muddy
[43:00] so let me just tackle this thing a
[43:01] little deeper now
[43:05] after after i have a drink of water
[43:10] trying to take care of myself better
[43:12] lately
[43:14] for the sake of the lord and
[43:17] getting some testing done and make sure
[43:19] i got everything on track
[43:21] drink more water
[43:24] i got to have in a couple weeks gotta
[43:26] have a
[43:28] colonology
[43:34] mom colonology isn't it
[43:43] i like mine better
[43:45] my my nurse son-in-law is shaking his
[43:47] head
[43:48] god help my father-in-law
[43:51] colonology
[43:53] that's what they call it if it's a
[43:54] preacher gets it done colonology
[43:58] i'm changing the name because that's for
[44:00] preachers he gets the colonology
[44:03] it's not fun i know that
[44:07] the meaning to condemnation is the
[44:09] action of condemning someone to
[44:10] punishment
[44:12] a sentencing
[44:13] so it's not just the going through the
[44:16] jury process of trying to find what's
[44:18] the truth it's the action of condemning
[44:21] you've been condemned
[44:23] it's a final verdict okay it's a
[44:25] condemning and then the punishment goes
[44:27] with it whether it's 30 years or
[44:29] whatever it is 50 years or life sentence
[44:31] whatever it is it's the final
[44:34] judgment
[44:35] and notice
[44:37] it can be done sometimes
[44:40] when whether they're guilty or not
[44:44] which fits with the message very well
[44:46] because satan is the professional at
[44:49] pronouncing
[44:51] a final judgment on a believer
[44:54] and it's not true
[44:59] you're doomed you cross the line
[45:02] so it's a it's a final judgment it's a
[45:05] what
[45:06] and it can be done a final judgment can
[45:08] done be done whether they are guilty or
[45:10] not the punishment and the judgment is
[45:13] dished out that's condemnation you've
[45:15] been condemned it's not the hearing it's
[45:18] the final condemnation and the
[45:20] punishment that goes with it
[45:22] and some people get the wrong judgment
[45:25] and i've been reading up on this because
[45:26] i i seen a video the other day of a man
[45:29] in missouri and he was in jail for 43
[45:32] years
[45:33] and there was one lawyer that looked it
[45:35] over again and said wait a minute
[45:37] something's desperately wrong and she
[45:38] took several months and she realized
[45:41] there's there's some holes in this 43
[45:43] years in prison okay he never said he
[45:46] was guilty never guilty of three they
[45:48] said three murders and so 43 years
[45:51] and the witness then they got the
[45:53] witness and the witness said
[45:55] she found the witness that witnessed
[45:56] against him said she found out that she
[45:58] was accusing this uh the i was she was
[46:01] accusing the wrong man back 43 years ago
[46:04] i accused the wrong man of the murder
[46:08] his name is kevin strickland and i just
[46:11] been watching it uh on on the video on
[46:13] my news thing on my on my app i've been
[46:15] watching him and watching him you know
[46:17] and he learned about this while he's
[46:20] watching a a soap opera in prison it
[46:22] gets they break into
[46:25] they break into a news briefing and he
[46:28] finds out that he's going to be released
[46:30] after 43 years not from the lawyer but
[46:33] watching his soap opera and they break
[46:35] into and there's his picture and says he
[46:38] that it's going to be overturned and
[46:40] he's going to be released i don't know
[46:41] how that guy acted but to find out that
[46:44] way
[46:49] 43 years accused wrong in prison in
[46:52] bondage that long and he has to find out
[46:55] on the tv that hey buddy you're released
[47:00] you were falsely accused
[47:02] i wonder if in the service today through
[47:04] the victory of my sermon
[47:06] you've been under bondage way too long
[47:08] and my message would be to you come out
[47:11] of that bondage you were falsely accused
[47:13] [Applause]
[47:18] the devil's been talking to you way too
[47:20] much
[47:22] [Applause]
[47:26] i watched the interview and you said
[47:28] what do you want to do first when you
[47:29] get out say i want to see my mom
[47:32] she got sick with cole and she's been
[47:33] sick she hasn't been able to come and
[47:35] see me i just want my mom remember this
[47:36] boy's a teenager you know when he did
[47:38] these things he hasn't had a life he has
[47:40] no life and so i just want to see my
[47:42] mama i want to see my mom
[47:44] my mom's so special to me unfortunately
[47:46] she died two weeks before he got out
[47:48] didn't get to see his mind went directly
[47:49] to the
[47:50] to the uh cemetery and and cedar that
[47:53] way but
[47:54] what a tragedy but here's the other
[47:56] thing he said what's what's another
[47:57] thing you want to do he says i've never
[47:59] seen the ocean
[48:00] i want to go see the ocean
[48:03] i've only seen pictures
[48:05] and i don't want to just see the ocean
[48:07] i can't even believe there's something
[48:08] that's so beautiful that exists i want
[48:10] to go to the ocean
[48:11] and
[48:13] i don't want to just go to i want to
[48:14] jump in the ocean
[48:16] i want to swim in it in fact i'd like to
[48:18] go out away from the land and go out in
[48:21] the ocean
[48:25] you know i tell you things begin to just
[48:26] swell up
[48:28] when you're set free
[48:33] in the year 2020
[48:36] this is really interesting now
[48:39] there were 129
[48:41] exonerations nationwide
[48:43] defendants exonerated last year lost a
[48:46] total of 1700 years behind bars
[48:50] an average of 13.4 years
[48:53] per exoneration according to the report
[48:55] from the national registry of
[48:57] exonerations and 30 of wrongful
[49:00] convictions in the registry's database
[49:02] can be traced back to mistaken
[49:06] eyewitness
[49:07] identifications
[49:10] there's you know and there's been a
[49:11] thrust of this lately i don't know if
[49:13] it's a natural type in the spiritual for
[49:15] the bride but there's been a thrust of
[49:16] this because of dna because all these
[49:18] modern testing there's greater proof can
[49:21] you say man and i'll tell you when this
[49:22] bride gets into the word more there's
[49:24] greater proof there's greater proof till
[49:27] she concludes i'm not guilty can you say
[49:29] mine i've been justified
[49:33] i've been under this bondage in this
[49:35] prison for 43 years for 30 years for 20
[49:38] years but today i'm walking out of this
[49:41] prison
[49:42] i've been set free can you say amen
[49:45] i've been falsely accused
[49:52] blessed be his name
[49:55] coming
[49:56] out right here today it ends i'm coming
[50:00] out
[50:01] i will no longer live under satan's
[50:03] condemnation
[50:04] [Applause]
[50:07] from this day forward i raise my hand if
[50:09] you can't do nothing else sorry for
[50:11] yelling but i'm excited i'm not mad i'm
[50:14] excited if you can't do nothing else
[50:17] just raise your hand and say may god
[50:18] bring me into that liberty in jesus
[50:20] christ hallelujah
[50:26] did you see the kid in minnesota
[50:29] that was
[50:30] not guilty on all accounts
[50:32] and i'm not trying to bring a political
[50:34] thing about this it's a big stir about
[50:36] it
[50:36] liberals don't like what happened he got
[50:38] off scot-free
[50:39] conservatives like that he was defending
[50:40] himself with his gun
[50:42] that's not what i'm talking about
[50:44] i was watching the video of this
[50:46] this kid as he stood there
[50:49] and on seven argued
[50:52] accounts jury declares
[50:55] not guilty
[50:57] his faith
[50:59] on this account the journey is not
[51:02] killed he just breaks up
[51:03] on the third one not killed he just
[51:05] crumbles to his chair
[51:09] because there's just nowhere in between
[51:11] you're either condemned to life
[51:13] or you're completely set free in this
[51:14] case
[51:16] imagine the feeling that overwhelmed him
[51:19] so what happens at the altar that's what
[51:21] happens in your life sometimes
[51:23] when he declares you not guilty
[51:26] when he says god's approval was
[51:27] satisfied at calvary
[51:31] i believe it affects
[51:33] our spirit
[51:35] my wife said she just looked at and just
[51:36] wept just wept at this young man and i
[51:39] don't you know i'm not trying to discern
[51:42] and i'm just saying when someone has the
[51:44] declaration like that
[51:46] and feels that free
[51:48] that he can walk right out of the
[51:49] courtroom
[51:51] that is a type and these exonerations
[51:54] are a type
[51:56] this bride becoming free
[52:05] my goodness friends
[52:07] i had to just shut the bible and just
[52:09] start shouting to the glory of god
[52:12] this isn't just a story this is what's
[52:14] happening now in the bride of jesus
[52:16] christ i got people coming people
[52:18] calling me texting saying listen i've
[52:20] lived underneath the religion of this
[52:22] message for years and i'm through with
[52:24] religion religion hasn't worked this
[52:27] message isn't about religion
[52:31] this message is not about religion
[52:34] it's about relationship
[52:40] it's about relationship
[52:48] blessed be the name of the lord i say
[52:50] blessed be the name of the lord
[52:53] thank you for the truth
[52:55] that i have been approved and set free
[53:00] [Applause]
[53:04] and there isn't anything that i can do
[53:06] to make god love me more than he does
[53:10] this morning there's not one ounce of
[53:12] something i can do to make him love me
[53:13] more and there isn't anything i can do
[53:16] to make him love me any less
[53:20] [Applause]
[53:21] nothing nothing
[53:24] there isn't anything you can do to make
[53:26] god love you any less
[53:30] there isn't anything you could do to
[53:31] make him love you anymore
[53:33] he loved you before the foundation of
[53:35] the world
[53:37] sent jesus christ
[53:40] sent the prophets of the bible why
[53:42] because he loved you
[53:46] it was for love alone
[53:48] that he sent his word to the people
[53:51] oh let's give him another handclap of
[53:53] praise
[53:54] i just love you so much
[54:01] thank you jesus
[54:06] satan is your mistaken witness
[54:09] greatly mistaken he's your accuser
[54:17] wow
[54:22] and try to
[54:25] the other meaning to condemnation is not
[54:26] just a final
[54:28] punishment but it's a strong disapproval
[54:31] that you're
[54:32] unaccepted you as a person
[54:35] are unapproved of
[54:36] you're unaccepted
[54:41] so
[54:42] i could preach more on that but i'm done
[54:44] with that one of condemnation now i
[54:46] think you get the point
[54:49] but i want to make something real clear
[54:52] since calvary
[54:55] those who truly receive christ are in
[54:57] christ and are known they are no longer
[55:00] under the condemnation of god
[55:04] or the judgments of god
[55:07] whatever he had he took us our
[55:09] punishment whatever we had we he took
[55:10] our punishment for us
[55:13] god no longer deals with those in the
[55:14] book of life in the lamb's book of life
[55:16] in the realm
[55:17] of final judgment or final disapproval
[55:20] can i say it again
[55:23] god no longer deals
[55:26] with those in the book of the life and
[55:28] those in the lamb's book of life
[55:30] in the realm of final disapproval or
[55:32] final judgment
[55:38] so if you're living under that you can
[55:39] rest assured
[55:41] it's not coming from god at all
[55:44] this becomes satan's language
[55:47] satan's realm
[55:49] if you've been born again by the word
[55:53] and you come into condemnation
[55:55] if you don't remember anything else
[55:56] today remember it's not god condemning
[55:59] you
[56:01] his anger
[56:03] his judgment
[56:04] has already been satisfied
[56:09] that's condemnation but this is
[56:11] conviction a formal declaration that
[56:13] someone
[56:14] is guilty of a criminal defense
[56:17] made by the verdict of a jury or a
[56:19] decision of the judge in a court of law
[56:22] so conviction
[56:24] we look at it in terms of the jury and
[56:26] all that come and you decide
[56:29] and ultimately only god knows the heart
[56:30] whether the person's guilty of it or not
[56:33] but
[56:34] when you're guilty you're guilty
[56:36] wouldn't it be great if people would
[56:38] just admit they're guilty
[56:40] i'd have a lot more tax
[56:42] money lot less court cases
[56:46] but men without the birth are liars and
[56:48] they put on stuff you know but if we
[56:50] just admit we're guilty
[56:52] when we're guilty
[56:54] here's the evidence
[56:55] yes i see the evidence i'm guilty i've
[56:58] said that to policemen that pulled me
[57:00] over
[57:03] and it still doesn't help sometimes they
[57:04] still give me a ticket
[57:07] trying to be a christian here and admit
[57:08] my guilt
[57:11] but when when you're guilty you're
[57:12] guilty but when you're not you're not
[57:16] so in the realms of conviction let's
[57:18] never mind a jury deciding and never
[57:19] mind other christians deciding your
[57:21] verdict
[57:22] but let's leave conviction
[57:25] in god's hands
[57:27] okay you don't have to have a bunch of
[57:29] people
[57:29] presenting a case against you and also
[57:32] there's a verdict and you're guilty
[57:34] you know your heart okay so when but
[57:35] when god convicts you
[57:38] then it's time to open up to it
[57:40] can you say man i'm sorry i'm going
[57:42] longer i was going to close there but
[57:44] just a little bit on conviction and i'll
[57:46] have to finish this next next week
[57:49] you got you got some time
[57:51] we're staying for communion right so i
[57:53] can preach all the way through
[57:56] and then you know what this leads
[57:58] perfectly up to the communion scriptures
[58:01] tonight
[58:03] because i'm going to read to you in
[58:04] first corinthians 11 where it says
[58:07] we are corrected and we respond to
[58:09] correction
[58:11] so that we will not be condemned
[58:14] with the world
[58:16] different category
[58:17] we're not under their condemnation we're
[58:19] in a different category
[58:24] so we're talking about godly conviction
[58:26] that is to lead you to godly repentance
[58:28] that's what i'm talking about godly
[58:30] conviction that leads you to godly
[58:31] repentance one thing it's one thing when
[58:34] someone else is trying to convict you
[58:36] it's another thing when god is moving on
[58:38] you to reveal that you're guilty and
[58:41] it's now listen this is not the feeling
[58:42] of guilt this is actually god moving to
[58:45] show you you're guilty
[58:47] okay we don't want that removed from our
[58:49] lives it's the truth the truth is the
[58:51] truth the truth will set you free
[58:53] so if you're guilty and you own up to it
[58:55] and repent of it then you've admitted to
[58:57] the truth it happened i did it god
[58:59] please forgive me and his blood cleanses
[59:02] us from all sins this is conviction it's
[59:04] not somebody else convicting you and
[59:05] it's not the feeling of guilt because
[59:07] you cannot be guilty and feeling the
[59:09] feeling of guilt i got another sermon on
[59:12] that
[59:13] he had cities of refuge for people who
[59:15] were not guilty
[59:18] but they were feeling the feeling of you
[59:20] so they could run into the city of
[59:21] refuge and be protected there because
[59:24] they weren't really guilty
[59:27] amen so there are times when you're
[59:29] feeling the feeling of guilt but you're
[59:31] not really guilty but it's a whole
[59:33] different picture when god is moved in
[59:36] on your life and he's revealed and
[59:38] exposed because he knows the secrets of
[59:40] the heart and he exposes you you're
[59:42] guilty of this it's not the feeling geek
[59:44] but you are guilty and you know it he
[59:46] lovingly shows you and we never want to
[59:49] be without that in our lives can you say
[59:52] amen and when we're guilty we need to
[59:55] say god you have shown me i am guilty
[59:58] and i'm owning up to it please forgive
[1:00:01] me help me never to do that again this
[1:00:04] is sober sincere repentance
[1:00:07] and you don't want this out of your life
[1:00:09] this is not condemnation this is the
[1:00:12] move of conviction in our lives
[1:00:15] amen you gotta separate it
[1:00:17] you know i thanksgiving yesterday
[1:00:21] or friday i sent my whole family a text
[1:00:23] from thanksgiving because
[1:00:25] somebody
[1:00:26] was guilty of taking my phone
[1:00:30] on thanksgiving day because we had
[1:00:32] everybody at the household 23 of us
[1:00:34] and somebody was guilty of taking my
[1:00:36] phone
[1:00:37] and taken pictures of 200 pictures all
[1:00:42] throughout my house
[1:00:44] of yeah of of
[1:00:46] the doors and every nook and cranny and
[1:00:48] the closets and the floors there's no
[1:00:51] pictures of people i was going through
[1:00:53] 200 out of my phone and i was starting
[1:00:56] to get upset i did not take these
[1:00:58] pictures
[1:01:00] somebody is guilty of taking pictures of
[1:01:02] things i don't want i don't want every
[1:01:04] nook and cranny in my home
[1:01:06] photographed taking up the storage in my
[1:01:08] phone i'm going to find out who done
[1:01:11] this
[1:01:13] i'm getting to the bottom of this
[1:01:15] somebody did this as a joke on me so i'm
[1:01:18] going through them i said
[1:01:19] who in the world done this and there are
[1:01:21] times when something happens at the
[1:01:23] house like
[1:01:24] so one of the kids or somebody drives on
[1:01:26] my grass
[1:01:29] my nice grass i have a goal in life to
[1:01:32] have my grass looking like john
[1:01:34] garrett's
[1:01:37] it's taken me years and i can't get
[1:01:38] there
[1:01:39] but i'm watching over the grass you know
[1:01:41] and so i put up these
[1:01:42] posts and i do everything when you drive
[1:01:45] through
[1:01:46] cars are for the driveway
[1:01:49] the grass is to enjoy cars driveway
[1:01:54] grass play playing
[1:01:56] you're supposed to somebody ran over the
[1:01:58] post the other day
[1:02:03] this stuff happens all the time you're
[1:02:04] laughing this stuff happens and most the
[1:02:06] time i send out a text all right i want
[1:02:08] you to tell me who did this and i get no
[1:02:11] response nothing
[1:02:14] nobody even says nothing terrible it's
[1:02:16] very disrespectful
[1:02:20] and so
[1:02:21] on that note i don't think she raya
[1:02:25] i have to praise ryan today because she
[1:02:27] quickly returned a text and said dad
[1:02:30] my husband's truck is too big and i ran
[1:02:32] over your stick
[1:02:33] with the truck she quickly confessed
[1:02:36] raya you're my favorite child today god
[1:02:39] bless you thank you for your admitting
[1:02:41] guilt and your honesty
[1:02:43] god's going to bless you for that
[1:02:47] the other kids i just don't know about
[1:02:48] yet
[1:02:52] anyway i go through all these 200
[1:02:54] pictures and
[1:02:55] there's two pictures in there
[1:02:57] that gave it away
[1:03:01] and then i knew i had evidence
[1:03:06] of
[1:03:07] who it was
[1:03:09] out of all the pictures of the nook and
[1:03:11] crannies of my house and i know this is
[1:03:13] a little bit comical but i thought
[1:03:15] i would
[1:03:16] [Laughter]
[1:03:22] so they're not here today they're
[1:03:24] probably listening in but emmaus and
[1:03:26] israel
[1:03:28] my little nephews
[1:03:30] second nephews
[1:03:32] i mean look at this you know
[1:03:34] you have been caught
[1:03:37] you shouldn't have put that up because
[1:03:38] you are guilty
[1:03:41] but the thing is about it
[1:03:42] i mean look at this guy israel he has no
[1:03:45] remorse he's in your face
[1:03:48] sticking his tongue out there's no
[1:03:50] repentance or anything there
[1:03:54] these are my second nephews and you boys
[1:03:57] if you're listening you're guilty you've
[1:03:59] been caught
[1:04:00] and my punishment it's not like the lord
[1:04:03] he forgives you completely
[1:04:05] i if you come and confess next week
[1:04:07] you're on vacation but if you're
[1:04:08] listening israel emmaus if you come and
[1:04:10] confess to uncle paul
[1:04:13] i'll let you off the hook but there is a
[1:04:15] punishment i want to see a box of
[1:04:17] twinkies on my desk next week and then
[1:04:19] you're off
[1:04:22] take that off so i don't get criticized
[1:04:24] by other message ministers
[1:04:30] his presence
[1:04:33] can bring the evidence
[1:04:36] like nobody
[1:04:38] and convict you
[1:04:39] even if stuff you don't fully know
[1:04:41] yourself but then you realize wow lord
[1:04:43] i'm wrong in that
[1:04:44] sometimes it's attitudes it's not you
[1:04:47] you did something wrong it's your
[1:04:48] attitude
[1:04:49] but i was right i was right in that
[1:04:52] incident but your attitude is wrong
[1:04:54] we've got to ask forgiveness for our
[1:04:56] attitude sometimes
[1:05:00] god convicts of these things
[1:05:06] when god brings conviction there's no
[1:05:08] need to hide
[1:05:09] because it'll do you good in the end
[1:05:12] some people run from it and call it
[1:05:13] condemnation but if we're convicted
[1:05:16] and some people who are convicted never
[1:05:18] repent they walk away i'm going to quit
[1:05:19] coming to that church it's all
[1:05:20] condemnation i'm not going to take my
[1:05:22] kids there anymore it's just condemning
[1:05:24] them
[1:05:24] it is
[1:05:26] what if it's the chastening of the lord
[1:05:28] and what if chastening means you're a
[1:05:30] son
[1:05:34] it's conviction of him what if it's just
[1:05:36] taking the very hide off your back and
[1:05:38] those short skirts and those tight
[1:05:40] skirts and he's just going at it and
[1:05:42] just be careful you don't label it as
[1:05:44] condemnation
[1:05:46] it might be the lord reminding you
[1:05:49] of what modesty is
[1:05:53] because he loves you
[1:05:57] but his conviction never ever has a
[1:06:00] final judgment
[1:06:02] or
[1:06:02] disapproval of the person
[1:06:08] if you do that you're getting off the
[1:06:10] scripture
[1:06:11] his conviction never has a final
[1:06:14] judgment or pronouncement of punishment
[1:06:16] final punishment or disapproval of the
[1:06:18] person it's kind of like when you raise
[1:06:20] kids you're correcting what they did
[1:06:21] wrong but you're not disowning the sun
[1:06:25] no matter what they do wrong they're
[1:06:27] still my son my sons and my daughters
[1:06:29] are still even if they drive on my grass
[1:06:30] they're still my sons and daughters
[1:06:32] i don't kick them out of the house for
[1:06:33] that that's right
[1:06:35] i feel like it sometimes but i don't
[1:06:36] kick them out of the house for that why
[1:06:38] they're my sons they're my daughters i
[1:06:39] love them anyway my love doesn't change
[1:06:41] because they ride on my grass
[1:06:43] do you get it if my love for them can be
[1:06:45] that way then god's love for you has to
[1:06:47] be the same way
[1:06:49] he don't disown you as a daughter of god
[1:06:51] because you messed up
[1:06:56] but he will convict you
[1:06:58] and you should run and embrace it as
[1:07:00] soon as he does
[1:07:04] some christian writers said about
[1:07:05] conviction what gives us conviction of
[1:07:07] sin is not the number of sins we have
[1:07:09] committed it is the sight of the
[1:07:10] holiness of god
[1:07:12] henry blackaby said when when a holy god
[1:07:14] draws near
[1:07:16] in a true revival people come under
[1:07:18] terrible conviction of sin the
[1:07:20] outstanding the outstanding feature of a
[1:07:22] spiritual waking has been the profound
[1:07:24] consciousness of the presence and
[1:07:26] holiness of god
[1:07:27] another writer said conviction of sin is
[1:07:29] god's way of inviting you to restore
[1:07:31] fellowship with him
[1:07:32] i like that one
[1:07:34] conviction of sin it's not condemnation
[1:07:36] it's god's way of inviting you to
[1:07:38] restore fellowship with him again
[1:07:42] conviction is not repentance
[1:07:44] conviction leads to repentance but you
[1:07:46] can be convicted without repentance
[1:07:50] conviction is more than a mere feeling
[1:07:51] of guilt for someone we have done wrong
[1:07:53] something we have done wrong
[1:07:55] conviction is more than just the feeling
[1:07:56] of guilt it's normal to feel guilty
[1:07:58] after doing something that we know we
[1:07:59] shouldn't have done conviction goes
[1:08:01] above and beyond having a feeling
[1:08:03] convict in the greek is translated as in
[1:08:06] lyncho which means to convince someone
[1:08:08] of the truth to reprove to accuse in
[1:08:11] other words he's god's trying to
[1:08:14] convince you of the truth
[1:08:15] to reprimand to reprove you so we see
[1:08:18] that conviction brings out the truth it
[1:08:20] accuses of our wrongs and rebukes us of
[1:08:22] our sins as we have seen through the
[1:08:24] verses we have discussed conviction is
[1:08:26] good brokenness is good it draws us
[1:08:29] closer to god how many raise your hand
[1:08:30] and say jaws are closer to god
[1:08:32] conviction of the holy spirit always
[1:08:34] wants to draw you in closer to god not
[1:08:36] to run you away not to write you off not
[1:08:39] to cut you off
[1:08:40] if you find yourself in deep conviction
[1:08:42] for something don't ignore it go to your
[1:08:44] prayer closet and get right with god
[1:08:46] today today is your day of
[1:08:47] reconciliation our lord wants to be with
[1:08:50] you he wants to manifest himself through
[1:08:51] you and he cannot do that if you're not
[1:08:53] right with him yes brokenness is painful
[1:08:56] but it's necessary it is beautiful thank
[1:08:59] god for conviction
[1:09:01] there's a clear difference between
[1:09:03] conviction and condemnation
[1:09:05] conviction comes from the lord and it
[1:09:06] leads to life and joy
[1:09:10] however condemnation comes from satan
[1:09:12] and it leads to despair
[1:09:14] conviction is intended to lead us to the
[1:09:16] lord but condemnation drives us away
[1:09:18] from him condemnation causes us to look
[1:09:21] to self
[1:09:23] conviction causes us to look to christ
[1:09:26] when someone is conviction when someone
[1:09:28] is experiencing condemnation there is no
[1:09:30] solution to their problem
[1:09:32] when we are experiencing the conviction
[1:09:34] there's hope
[1:09:35] because of the cross jesus christ died
[1:09:37] for our sins when we look to the cross
[1:09:39] we find freedom and hope
[1:09:41] for god said he did not send his son
[1:09:44] into the world to condemn the world
[1:09:50] but that the world through him
[1:09:53] might be saved
[1:09:55] do you hear that even the world god did
[1:09:57] not send his son to condemn the world
[1:10:00] god is not about condemnation
[1:10:12] hallelujah
[1:10:19] so the pharisees bring the
[1:10:22] the woman caught in the act
[1:10:25] they sitting there
[1:10:27] and they're all about condemnation of
[1:10:29] this woman we caught her in the act
[1:10:31] we got the word we got the quotes on it
[1:10:33] from moses
[1:10:35] we got it but we're going to bring jesus
[1:10:37] in well
[1:10:38] if you bring jesus in
[1:10:41] that was probably their mistake
[1:10:45] [Laughter]
[1:10:49] because jesus
[1:10:51] he's going to be looking from a whole
[1:10:53] different picture at this theme
[1:10:56] jesus is going to look back into the
[1:10:58] eternities of time and see
[1:11:00] wait a minute
[1:11:02] they've brought my daughter here
[1:11:10] they don't know it but they just brought
[1:11:12] my daughter
[1:11:14] and she is in sin
[1:11:16] but i'm i'm looking ahead into the mind
[1:11:18] of god and she's my daughter
[1:11:24] but they're coming with one agenda i got
[1:11:26] the quote i got the word
[1:11:28] i got moses i got the quotes of the
[1:11:30] prophet
[1:11:33] got a whole i got the case and it's not
[1:11:35] just hearsay we caught her right doing
[1:11:37] it she was doing it
[1:11:41] what do you think jesus
[1:11:43] so as he deals with these guys he don't
[1:11:45] just well i'll tell you no no he just he
[1:11:48] doesn't say nothing he just drops down
[1:11:50] to the ground and nobody knows what he
[1:11:52] wrote but all we know is that when he
[1:11:55] wrote something
[1:11:56] conviction fell on the whole group
[1:12:00] so it's been sad that he's probably
[1:12:03] writing out these men
[1:12:07] and things that they have done
[1:12:10] some names because god knows all the
[1:12:12] names
[1:12:13] he probably he probably took a section
[1:12:15] of the sand and he wrote this pharisee's
[1:12:18] name at the top and then he put a line
[1:12:19] and then he he listed a bunch of stuff
[1:12:21] under that name he did another lady
[1:12:23] listed
[1:12:24] and they're looking at going
[1:12:26] and you know what that was this is
[1:12:28] conviction
[1:12:29] because around jesus is conviction
[1:12:32] and they're looking at that going
[1:12:34] wow first of all
[1:12:38] god knows me
[1:12:40] in this presence i can't hide anything
[1:12:43] he just wrote my life right there
[1:12:45] god knows i did that i was hiding it for
[1:12:47] all these years as a pharisee and god
[1:12:49] knows everything i've done
[1:12:50] he's writing it out
[1:12:52] i'm taking license there but
[1:12:54] something brought conviction on the
[1:12:56] place
[1:12:58] so he writes it all and then
[1:13:00] he
[1:13:01] i think he wrote theirs first because
[1:13:03] they all start to back off
[1:13:05] begin to
[1:13:07] drop their stones and he says stands up
[1:13:09] and says
[1:13:10] all right we're going to proceed with
[1:13:12] this with your stones
[1:13:13] he that's without sin let him come
[1:13:16] forward and cast the first stone
[1:13:20] they just dropped their stones
[1:13:22] then it says he got back down in the
[1:13:23] ground again
[1:13:26] i'm wondering if he wrote this woman's
[1:13:28] life
[1:13:29] wrote the men's names
[1:13:31] because if conviction is there then
[1:13:33] she's feeling conviction as well
[1:13:37] and she goes
[1:13:38] he knows my name
[1:13:41] he knows my life he knows everything i
[1:13:43] can't hide anything from him
[1:13:45] but here's the difference
[1:13:47] they had the opportunity and that
[1:13:48] presence to repent
[1:13:51] that would have been the place right
[1:13:53] there to drop their stone and say
[1:13:55] i'm guilty
[1:13:58] i'm feeling condemnation i'm feeling
[1:14:00] conviction not condemnation
[1:14:02] and we tried what am i doing they should
[1:14:04] have been saying what in the world i'm
[1:14:06] doing with this stone in my hand
[1:14:10] i know it's one o'clock but i just feel
[1:14:12] to finish this just right here what am i
[1:14:15] repentant should have said what in the
[1:14:17] world am i holding this stone in my hand
[1:14:21] you all remember this when you get so
[1:14:22] critical of people
[1:14:25] critical of your husband
[1:14:27] overly critical of your wife critical of
[1:14:29] other believers in the church
[1:14:34] conviction and repentance tends to wash
[1:14:37] all that away
[1:14:39] because he who has forgiven you gives
[1:14:42] you forgiveness for others
[1:14:44] they should have been dropping their
[1:14:45] stones so what am i doing with this
[1:14:46] stone
[1:14:48] and can you imagine these preachers he's
[1:14:50] offering them conviction and they drop
[1:14:52] the stones and they begin walking away
[1:14:55] instead of it's kind of like cain who
[1:14:57] was serpentine brother tony
[1:14:59] and god still offered him repentance
[1:15:03] serpent seed couldn't even be saved
[1:15:06] and he says if you'll do what your
[1:15:08] brother did
[1:15:09] i'll accept you
[1:15:11] and people want to say god's out just
[1:15:12] condemning everybody no he's not
[1:15:15] he's giving everybody an opportunity
[1:15:17] he gave serpents to eat an opportunity
[1:15:20] he just didn't have anything in him to
[1:15:22] repent
[1:15:23] that's not god's fault can you say amen
[1:15:26] he said no i'm going to do my own
[1:15:28] sacrifice cain walked away and he
[1:15:30] serpentine had the opportunity if you'll
[1:15:32] do the sacrifice of your brother i will
[1:15:34] accept you right now serpency
[1:15:37] and those pharisees could have had a
[1:15:39] change in their life if they had
[1:15:41] responded to the spirit of conviction
[1:15:43] around them and christ around them
[1:15:44] dropped their stones and walked away and
[1:15:46] went back to their religion again i'll
[1:15:48] tell you today friends i don't want to
[1:15:50] go back to any religion can you say man
[1:15:52] i'm staying right here in the presence
[1:15:54] of jesus christ
[1:15:57] i'm staying right here in his presence
[1:16:01] let him rebuke me let him expose me let
[1:16:04] him tell me where i'm wrong in my life
[1:16:06] because i know it will be for my good
[1:16:09] was it for the good of this lady i'd say
[1:16:11] it was because he said where's your
[1:16:14] accusers now tonight i'd like to talk
[1:16:15] about that just about 10 minutes in
[1:16:17] communion where's your accusers because
[1:16:18] we're so concerned about the accusers
[1:16:20] and and all the people are saying things
[1:16:22] about us and all these other things get
[1:16:24] your mind off of all the other accusers
[1:16:27] god has a way of removing the accusers
[1:16:29] it's not about people it's about where
[1:16:31] you stand with god
[1:16:35] it's about you and jesus it's not about
[1:16:37] what people are saying about you
[1:16:40] and he said where's your accusers now
[1:16:41] and she goes i guess they're gone so
[1:16:44] it's just me and jesus
[1:16:47] where are those who are condemning you
[1:16:49] god has a way of removing him removing
[1:16:51] him
[1:16:53] and he removed her accusers
[1:16:55] and he said these words that i was going
[1:16:57] to make the title of my message today
[1:17:00] if they're gone neither do i
[1:17:04] condemn you
[1:17:06] i've convicted you
[1:17:08] but i'm not gonna condemn you
[1:17:11] go
[1:17:12] and sin no more
[1:17:15] come on let's stand let's give god glory
[1:17:18] go and sin no more
[1:17:19] [Applause]
[1:17:23] and that speaks when someone's repented
[1:17:25] imagine she was just weeping just
[1:17:27] weeping
[1:17:29] he the declaration come forth
[1:17:33] from
[1:17:34] christ
[1:17:37] neither do i condemn you
[1:17:40] now go and sin no more and that's the
[1:17:42] future for you
[1:17:45] that you have a different life ahead
[1:17:48] when there's true repentance it's going
[1:17:49] to be different down the road
[1:17:54] praise the lord i feel weak in my body
[1:17:57] but has this helped
[1:17:58] people here this morning as it helped
[1:17:59] you to see
