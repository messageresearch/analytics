[18:17] Fontaine's church and it's been a lot of
[18:19] years since we got to fellowship with
[18:20] the Fontaine. And so uh and somebody
[18:23] said something about, you know, singing
[18:25] or something and I said, "Well,
[18:26] absolutely I will." And so then my wife
[18:28] said, "Well, if you're going to sing,
[18:29] why don't you do one that you wrote?"
[18:30] And I said, "Well, okay." So this this
[18:33] is a little bit thrown together at the

[18:43] the time we're living in and uh you
[18:45] know, it's the bride's time and it's a
[18:47] time of war. It's a time of victory and
[18:49] it's a time to follow our chief captain
[18:51] Jesus Christ. So, that's kind of what
[18:52] it's about. So,
[18:55] [Music]
[19:04] this is a war song.
[19:07] It's not for peace.
[19:10] It's a song of violence.
[19:13] Out in the streets,

[24:26] to be with you again. While we're

[24:31] book of James.
[24:35] You can see it's been a very long time.
[24:39] Paul day. I'm sorry.
[24:51] this morning.
[25:00] Testing. 1 2 3 4 5 6.
[25:03] Very good. James chapter 5 and verse 11.
[25:08] Behold, we count them happy which
[25:11] endure. And that's that's true when you
[25:14] see somebody who's uh running a race or
[25:16] trying to to climb a mountaintop or
[25:19] something and they you see they're
[25:20] almost to the very peak and at the last
[25:23] they they give up and go back. Oh man,
[25:25] you were almost there. And what it's
[25:27] what what's um bitterness. You look at
[25:30] somebody who turns back when they're
[25:31] almost to the end. But we count them
[25:34] happy which endure.
[25:37] You have heard of the patience or
[25:39] steadfastness of Job and have seen the
[25:42] end of the Lord that the Lord is very
[25:45] pitiful. He's compassionate and he is of
[25:49] tender mercy. And uh today we're going
[25:52] to take a uh take a a look through the
[25:55] the book of Job looking at uh at Job's
[25:58] testimony. Let's let's pray. Heavenly
[26:00] Father, we thank you for your goodness
[26:02] and your grace to us, Lord. Father, I
[26:05] thank you for the songs of praise that
[26:07] have been sung, Lord. The the
[26:08] testimonies of your goodness to our
[26:10] lives, Lord. And Father, I just um Lord,
[26:14] we just ask your your blessing upon the
[26:16] service today, Lord. I pray you'd move
[26:17] and speak to each one of us in a special
[26:19] way, oh God, in Jesus name. Amen. God
[26:22] bless you. You may be seated.
[26:25] Now it's with uh when whenever we speak
[26:28] about uh trials and uh and suffering and
[26:32] things that go that go tragic in our
[26:35] lives, you always speak about it very
[26:37] very cautiously, very carefully because
[26:39] it's not an not an easy thing. And just
[26:42] this morning like uh when they got up
[26:44] and uh and saw the the notification on
[26:47] WhatsApp about the the Evans who lost
[26:49] their their barn and and the terrible
[26:51] fire that might that's the that's part
[26:53] of Job's story. All of a sudden tragedy
[26:56] strikes and you think what if that were
[26:58] my house? What if that were my family?
[27:01] And you start asking all the questions
[27:03] and you don't know and tragedy strikes
[27:06] every single one of us. There's not a
[27:09] single one of us who hasn't had bad
[27:12] things happen in our lives and you
[27:14] wonder why did this happen and um that's
[27:18] the that's the testimony of Job. And
[27:21] it's been a um it's been a uh it's been
[27:24] it's been a blessing over the last year.
[27:26] I I about this time last year, um our
[27:30] family started our uh our little trial
[27:32] that we've been going through. And I
[27:34] remember taking my wife to the hospital
[27:35] and coming back and gathering things to
[27:38] take back to tour to her. I I'm the kind
[27:40] of guy who who never likes to be
[27:42] somewhere without a book because you'll
[27:44] be in the waiting room. You don't want
[27:46] to lose those precious moments. So I
[27:48] think what book do I want to have? What
[27:49] book do I want to have? Man, and there's
[27:51] this I bought this little book years
[27:53] ago. hadn't read it before on the on on
[27:56] on the book of Job. So, I started
[27:58] reading that and I've been uh I've been
[28:00] going through it ever since. I just want
[28:02] to share some of the things that uh that
[28:04] God's opened up to me. Brother Brandon,
[28:07] he held a series on the book of Job one
[28:09] time. We don't have the recordings of
[28:11] it, but he says uh I remember here a few
[28:14] years ago. I was 2 years one time on Job
[28:17] and I had Job on the ash sheep for about
[28:20] four weeks. Every Sunday and somewhere
[28:23] else is every Sunday, every Wednesday it
[28:26] was Job on the ash sheep. Such a
[28:28] beautiful story. God dealing with his
[28:31] saint. And everybody else who was
[28:34] experiencing Job's story at the time
[28:37] didn't think it was God dealing with a
[28:39] saint. It was God dealing with a sinner.
[28:41] And but brother Brandham's coming clear.
[28:43] This is a beautiful story. God dealing
[28:46] with his saint. How we all get in these
[28:48] places of distress. Don't know where to
[28:51] turn and we don't know why. And I just
[28:54] want to spend a little bit of time going
[28:55] through the uh book of Job. It can be a
[28:59] really hard book to read because um he
[29:02] and his friends, they're having these
[29:03] discussions back and forth and his
[29:06] friends are saying things that sound
[29:07] right half the time, but you know
[29:09] they're not quite right. So what do you
[29:11] really do with it? Um, so that's what
[29:13] we're going to kind of take a look at.
[29:14] But maybe we can start off in Job
[29:16] chapter 1. When we look at Job here, if
[29:20] anyone ever has a perfect life
[29:24] at the beginning of Job's story, it was
[29:27] Job and his family. I mean, they they
[29:31] had all the outward markers of someone
[29:35] who was being blessed by God. But Job 1
[29:39] verse one. Now there was a man in the
[29:42] land of Oz whose name was Job.
[29:46] And that man was perfect and upright,
[29:49] one that feared God and assued evil. And
[29:54] we can keep on going. Then um there were
[29:57] born unto him seven sons and three
[29:59] daughters. His substance also was 7,000
[30:02] sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yolk of oxen,
[30:07] which I take to be a thousand oxen
[30:09] because it takes two oxen and a yolk.
[30:12] 500 chiaes and a very great household.
[30:14] You have to have lots of employees to to
[30:17] run all these things. This man was the
[30:19] greatest of all the men of the east.
[30:22] And his sons went and feasted in their
[30:24] houses, everyone his day, and sent and
[30:26] called for their three sisters to eat
[30:28] and drink with them. And so it was when
[30:30] the days of their feasting were gone
[30:31] about that Job sent and sanctified them
[30:34] and rose up early in the morning,
[30:36] offered burnt offerings according to the
[30:38] number of them all. For Job said, "It
[30:40] may be that my sons have sinned and
[30:43] cursed God in their hearts." Thus did
[30:45] Job continually. Job was the picture of
[30:49] success. You think he has the the
[30:51] perfect testimony. He's got his uh he's
[30:54] got what a beautiful walk with God that
[30:56] he has. He's he has a blameless
[30:59] testimony. And notice you and I are
[31:01] reading the background of the story. We
[31:02] know what is being said about Job in
[31:04] heaven starting off, but no one else in
[31:07] the story knows this.
[31:09] Everybody else is just judging from what
[31:12] they see, making statements based upon
[31:14] the appearance. Nobody else sees this.
[31:17] He's a picture of success in his
[31:19] business and his finances. This guy is
[31:21] prospering. and you look at him and say,
[31:23] "Man, this guy must be paying his
[31:24] tithes, doing lots of offerings because
[31:26] look at all the blessings God's giving
[31:28] him." People can make those statements
[31:29] based on what they're seeing. He's
[31:32] respected in his community, in his home
[31:34] and family. He seems to be leading a
[31:38] perfect life, faultless testimony, all
[31:40] of the outward markers of God's favor.
[31:44] Is there any place in his life that's
[31:46] not being successful?
[31:48] Doesn't seem to be. his uh his sons and
[31:51] daughters. They're a help, happy, and
[31:53] healthy family. There's no sign of
[31:55] dysfunction. I mean, the kids like being
[31:57] together, even as adults, they they hang
[31:59] out together. Everybody enjoys each
[32:01] other's company. This is this is a great
[32:03] family. And he keeps his children
[32:05] covered in prayer each morning making
[32:08] petition for God's mercy. Um he's just a
[32:12] wonderful, wonderful man.
[32:16] Now later on in the book of Job, Job is
[32:18] starting to look back how life was
[32:20] before everything went wrong. And we can
[32:25] kind of look at his what what he says in
[32:27] Job 29 as he looks back. This is at the
[32:30] end of his last speech and you can kind
[32:32] of see that um
[32:35] he might have had a wrong idea about how
[32:39] God worked.
[32:42] We'll look at Job 29 and uh you'll see
[32:44] that he he kind of thought that
[32:48] he he had a certain expectation of how
[32:50] life was going to be and it was not it
[32:52] was not a correct expectation.
[32:54] Job 29:12 he says because
[32:58] because I delivered the poor that cried
[33:01] because I delivered the fatherless and
[33:02] him that had none to help him. I caused
[33:04] the widow's heart to sing for joy. He's
[33:07] showing all the different things he did
[33:08] when he was a respected member of the
[33:11] community. He thought, "Because I've
[33:12] done all these good things, this is how
[33:14] I think life is going to end up for me.
[33:18] I caused the widow's heart to sing for
[33:20] joy. I was eyes to the blind. I was feet
[33:22] to the lame. I was father to the poor.
[33:25] The cause which I knew not. Someone
[33:27] brings me this situation that seems to
[33:29] be unjust, I know nothing about it, but
[33:31] I'm going to search it out to make sure
[33:33] justice is done here. I broke the jaws
[33:36] of the wicked. I plucked the spoil out
[33:37] of his teeth because I've done all these
[33:41] things.
[33:42] Then I said, "I'm
[33:46] going to live a long fruitful life, live
[33:48] happily ever after. I'm going to die in
[33:50] my nest on my beautiful estate here.
[33:53] I'll multiply my days as the sand."
[33:57] That's what Job's expectation was.
[34:00] And that's what we often can think of,
[34:02] too. Hey, if you just do the right
[34:04] things in life, bad things probably
[34:07] aren't going to happen to you because
[34:09] yeah, why do bad things happen to good
[34:11] people?
[34:13] In Job's day, there was only one
[34:15] question. Sorry, one one answer to that
[34:18] question. They don't.
[34:20] And if bad things happen to good people,
[34:22] then that person probably wasn't as good
[34:25] as you thought they were.
[34:28] So Job has an outstanding testimony
[34:32] before the Lord, upright, blameless.
[34:36] Yet there's a he's something that's not
[34:39] quite right in his in his thinking about
[34:42] God. Kind of like the person Brother
[34:44] Brandham talks about. I'd rather be
[34:47] wrong in my doctrine
[34:49] and right in my heart. Job had a right
[34:52] heart with God. He had a right
[34:54] relationship with God. Yet you know
[34:57] what? Is it possible for any of us to
[35:00] ever be completely right in our
[35:02] doctrine?
[35:05] God is infinite.
[35:07] How could we make any statement about
[35:09] God with human words?
[35:11] Amen.
[35:12] That is not going to be some way
[35:14] lacking. God will always be bigger than
[35:18] our statements about him.
[35:20] And Job, he's from the uprightness of
[35:24] his heart, this expectation has come.
[35:27] I've done all these good things. I'm
[35:28] just looking back. I'm looking forward
[35:30] to getting old, being in my being in my
[35:33] easy chair here on my front porch,
[35:34] watching my kids frolic about the uh
[35:37] about the about the front lawn, playing
[35:39] together. I'm going to enjoy my old age
[35:41] because I have served God so faithfully.
[35:43] He's going to bless me. I'm looking
[35:44] forward to enjoying that.
[35:47] But um Job had a wrong expectation.
[35:51] But he was right in his heart. So when
[35:54] things went different than his
[35:56] expectation, he had a choice. Am I going
[35:59] to hold on to my expectation of how I
[36:02] think God should treat me
[36:04] or am I just going to hold on to God?
[36:08] And that uh that is what we that's a
[36:10] difficulty that all of us will face at
[36:12] some point in our life. Oswald Chambers,
[36:15] he's the author of the devotional, My
[36:17] Utmost for His Highest. He also wrote a
[36:19] book about Job called Baffled to Fight
[36:21] Better. He said, "It must be remembered
[36:23] what Job's creed was." Job believed that
[36:27] God prospered and blessed the upright
[36:30] man who trusted in him and that the man
[36:32] who was not upright was not prospered.
[36:36] And then came calamity after calamity.
[36:40] Everything Job believed about God was
[36:44] contradicted and his creed went to the
[36:48] wind.
[36:50] And at that moment, he has a choice. Am
[36:52] I going to hang on to my belief about
[36:55] God and be I want to be proven right
[36:58] that what I've said and believe about
[37:00] God will be true or do I let go of that
[37:01] and say let God be God. I'm just going
[37:03] to hang on to God. That's the important
[37:06] thing. Do we believe our beliefs about
[37:08] God or do we believe God? They can be
[37:11] close together, but they can also be far
[37:13] apart sometimes.
[37:15] And in the unfolding drama of his trial,
[37:18] everything Job thought about God was
[37:21] going to be ripped away. And he has no
[37:23] idea why. Yet, from the start, Job's
[37:27] heart was right with God.
[37:31] He's a successful man in every way. But
[37:33] unbeknownst to him, Job's life had
[37:36] attracted the attention of Satan.
[37:40] This enemy had long journeyed over the
[37:42] earth. He'd witnessed the worship of Job
[37:45] going up to heaven. And Satan had
[37:47] witnessed the blessings of God raining
[37:50] down on Job. Satan had heard all the
[37:54] prayers and the proclamations of love
[37:57] from Job. He'd observed God's great
[37:59] pleasure with his most faithful son.
[38:06] Okay,
[38:08] try this.
[38:13] Satan has heard all these things. He's
[38:15] seen Job praying, uh, praising God, seen
[38:18] God blessing Job, and Satan scoffed at
[38:21] it all because he thought, I know why
[38:24] this is happening.
[38:26] This was no love between God and Job.
[38:29] This was just a mutual coincidence of
[38:33] wants. Job, he needs blessing, so he
[38:36] praises God. And God, he wants somebody
[38:40] to praise him, so he showers blessings
[38:42] down. And they just call it love. But
[38:44] Satan, no, that's not love. This is a
[38:46] selfdeception of the highest order. Job
[38:50] and Jehovah have no relationship of
[38:53] disinterested love. Satan says, "Satan
[38:56] knows that such relationships don't
[38:58] exist. The greatest love to Satan. The
[39:01] only love he knows is self love.
[39:04] Any relationship between creatures was
[39:07] not built upon love for the other
[39:08] person. It was built upon love for one's
[39:12] self.
[39:13] Self-interested transactions was all
[39:16] that was the base of any relationship.
[39:19] Considering Job, Satan thought, who
[39:21] wouldn't offer worship to a God who
[39:24] blessed so liberally? And considering
[39:26] God, what spirit wouldn't be satisfied
[39:30] and happy with such lavish proclamations
[39:33] of worship? Satan understood
[39:36] self-interest? He admired successful
[39:40] transactional relationships.
[39:42] But Satan couldn't stand the lie that
[39:47] Job and God loved each other. So his
[39:50] purpose is to reveal the farce behind
[39:53] Jehovah's purported love for humanity
[39:56] and expose Jehovah to be no more and no
[40:00] less than an angel who had written of
[40:03] Victor's history of heaven's war.
[40:07] That is the purpose behind Satan's
[40:11] meeting with God in Job chapter 1 verse
[40:14] 6.
[40:18] [Music]
[40:20] Now there was a day when the sons of God
[40:23] came to present themselves before the
[40:25] Lord.
[40:26] And Satan came also among them. And the
[40:30] Lord said unto Satan, "Which comest
[40:33] thou?" Then Satan answered the Lord and
[40:35] said, "From going to and from the earth,
[40:37] from what? Walking up and down in it?"
[40:40] And the Lord said to Satan, "Have you
[40:41] considered my servant Job? There's none
[40:44] like him in the earth, a perfect and
[40:45] upright man, one that fears God and
[40:48] chooses evil. And then Satan asked the
[40:51] Lord and said, "Do Job fear God for not
[40:57] for nothing? How could you make a hedge
[40:59] about about his house and everything he
[41:01] has on every side? He blessed the work
[41:03] of his hands, his substance increases
[41:06] the land. But put forth your hand now,
[41:09] touch all that heath, and he will curse
[41:11] you to your face.
[41:14] Does Job fear God for not? And this
[41:18] question to Satan, he's trying to reveal
[41:21] the lie that this is a a relationship of
[41:24] love. All this is is transaction.
[41:28] Job worships, God blesses. It's like the
[41:31] water cycle, the evaporation,
[41:33] precipitates, all that it is. Now when I
[41:37] before I've always read this story, read
[41:40] this question. I thought that Satan was
[41:42] attacking Job's testimony and to a
[41:44] certain extent he is. But if you think
[41:46] about the question deeper, who is Satan
[41:49] really accusing?
[41:50] Yeah.
[41:51] Does Job fear God for not?
[41:54] I'd always thought it was Job who was
[41:57] being attacked, but at its deepest
[42:00] level, it's not Job,
[42:01] right?
[42:02] It's God. If we were to paraphrase this
[42:06] uh this this question, Satan would be
[42:10] saying, "The only reason Job fears you
[42:13] is because you pay him to do it. You two
[42:16] make a contract. You protect and prosper
[42:18] him as long as he obeys and worships
[42:20] you. You're not a god worthy of worship.
[42:22] You're no better than the mafia boss.
[42:24] You have to pay people to honor you." So
[42:27] when Satan asks God, "Is job pure God
[42:31] for nothing?" It's not just the town.
[42:33] Job at its deepest level, it's an attack
[42:35] on God. It's a challenge of God himself
[42:38] that God, you are not worthy of worship.
[42:43] That's what's really going on here.
[42:45] That's right.
[42:46] And the whole time throughout the book
[42:47] of Job, Job thinks that he's the one on
[42:50] trial. He said, "Man, I wish that God
[42:52] would come, that he'd come on the scene
[42:54] and be my witness, and then they came to
[42:55] me that I am righteous." But Job had the
[42:58] wrong picture because he wasn't on
[42:59] trial. Satan puts God on trial.
[43:03] And God is saying, "You're putting me on
[43:05] trial. I want to find a good witness
[43:07] here. If there's any witness who pull
[43:10] the carpet underneath Satan's argument
[43:12] is going to be Job."
[43:14] And God said, "I'm going to put Job on
[43:16] the witness stand." And you can ask him
[43:18] whatever questions you want. You can be
[43:20] the the the most irritating, the the
[43:24] worst prosecuting attorney in a cross
[43:27] examination, ask him the trickiest
[43:28] question. Job will stay true the entire
[43:31] time.
[43:33] It's ultimately God who's on trial in
[43:36] this story.
[43:38] And he's tapping Job to be his witness.
[43:42] No attorney is going to put somebody on
[43:44] the witness stand, be cross-examined by
[43:46] the other side, and he doesn't have
[43:49] confidence.
[43:50] So when God says God has counted you
[43:53] worthy when you have a test
[43:57] he says I am putting my full confidence
[43:59] in this witness sat as whatever
[44:02] questions whatever situations I'm he's
[44:04] going to be he's going to give the the
[44:07] the test is going to win the day in
[44:10] court is counted you worthy
[44:15] test trial that shows the grace of God
[44:17] has found has found you found favor with
[44:19] God God believes you'll stand the test.
[44:22] Well, amen.
[44:23] When it looks like everything has gone
[44:26] wrong,
[44:27] God's giving you a trial. He's got
[44:30] confidence in you. He doesn't have to
[44:32] baby you around. You are a real
[44:35] Christian.
[44:37] So,
[44:39] Satan lays out uh this challenge to God.
[44:43] You're not a God worthy of worship. You
[44:45] just have to pay people to worship you.
[44:47] This is a challenge to God's character.
[44:49] And God says, "Game on."
[44:52] You can do whatever you want to my
[44:54] servant Job within these boundaries.
[44:56] Take whatever he wants away from him and
[44:58] he will still worship.
[45:01] And God does put boundaries upon Satan.
[45:03] He don't he's not supposed to touch Job
[45:05] in this first this first phase of
[45:08] temptation.
[45:10] Um but notice one of the things we'll
[45:12] we'll will will learn from this uh this
[45:15] this story what is really valuable
[45:19] none of the things that Jo that that
[45:21] Satan touches in phase one of the story
[45:23] that that people think are so valuable
[45:24] in life all the worldly possessions the
[45:27] great house everything all those things
[45:29] are taken away from Job yet Job's
[45:32] identity who he is isn't touched
[45:35] you've got all kinds of stories about
[45:37] people who go from rags to riches wow
[45:39] all a sudden they're they're super
[45:41] successful. Then the stock market
[45:43] crashes and they go from riches to rags
[45:45] to one day. And because they've so
[45:48] identified themselves with their career,
[45:50] with their wealth, with their status,
[45:53] they've identified themselves with that
[45:54] and the stock market crashes. They've
[45:56] thrown themselves out of the building
[45:58] because to them they've lost their very
[46:00] identity when they lose their wealth.
[46:02] Well, Job loses everything.
[46:04] But his identity was not based on any of
[46:08] that. His identity was not touched in in
[46:11] this first phase of Job of Satan's
[46:13] attack upon Job.
[46:16] And then in one day,
[46:19] disaster strikes Job's home. First the
[46:22] civilians come and Job's ox and asses
[46:25] are stolen and his servants slay except
[46:28] one who has escaped alone to tell them.
[46:33] Two hours later, the fire from heaven
[46:36] falls. All of his sheep are burned up.
[46:39] All of his servants are slain except one
[46:44] who's escaped alone to tell them.
[46:47] Hour or two later, this job is just
[46:49] reeling from one shock after another.
[46:51] The Calaldanss come carry away all of
[46:52] his camels to slay all of his servants
[46:55] except the one who escapes them to tell
[46:58] them. And then lastly, this great wind
[47:01] comes. The house collapses on Job's
[47:04] children and his servants. And only one
[47:06] servant has escaped alone to tell him.
[47:13] What a day. The worst days of our lives
[47:17] I don't think could compare with this.
[47:19] And why?
[47:23] Why?
[47:25] We've read the first the first part of
[47:27] the story. We know why
[47:32] it was nothing wrong with Job. is God
[47:34] and Satan. They've they've made Job's
[47:36] life their battleground. But if we
[47:38] didn't know the battleground, Job
[47:41] chapter one,
[47:43] what might we be thinking?
[47:45] Man,
[47:46] Lord, I pray for my my brother Job. He's
[47:49] going through a real trial and he's lost
[47:51] everything. Help Lord be listening
[47:53] carefully to what you're trying to tell
[47:55] him here.
[47:57] God, I pray that you would help Job to
[47:59] get things right in his life. and tent
[48:01] for more things come. That's what we
[48:04] would probably all right be saying if we
[48:09] didn't know the backdrop. That's right.
[48:11] We need to be really careful being
[48:12] commentators on other people's trials
[48:14] because we don't know what's going on
[48:18] without the insight of Job 1. We would
[48:20] probably have agreed with Job's friends.
[48:23] Happy is the man of God correcteth. We
[48:26] might have said those very things and
[48:28] encouraged Job to repent as well. Job
[48:32] knew what had happened. Four servants
[48:35] had come to tell him, but he didn't know
[48:38] why.
[48:39] And that's the crux of the matter
[48:41] because if God
[48:44] had sent an angel, the nine of Job
[48:47] tomorrow is going to look like the worst
[48:49] day of Abraham. Job just hold on. keep
[48:52] on worshiping no matter what because we
[48:54] are going to deal the devil of death
[48:56] blow with this.
[48:57] If God had done that, Joel been
[49:00] prepared. He would have been doing it
[49:01] all, going through the motions. But God
[49:04] would have been guilty of witness
[49:06] tampering.
[49:08] The whole trial would have been
[49:10] compromised. Job couldn't know. Job
[49:14] couldn't be told. He just he's flying
[49:17] blind to the trial. He has no idea why
[49:20] all this has happened. thinks in Job
[49:22] think what have I done wrong God? What
[49:24] have I done right? He goes to Cathol I I
[49:26] offered the sacrifices last night. I
[49:27] prayed for my kids last night. What is
[49:29] wrong God? I don't know. He has he's
[49:32] flying blind. The only He can't answer
[49:34] the why question.
[49:36] The only thing that he has to go on is
[49:38] God's character.
[49:39] Amen.
[49:39] He's known God for years and years. He's
[49:41] had a relationship with God. God has
[49:43] always been faith before. I don't know
[49:45] what God's doing now, but I just got to
[49:48] trust him. That's the only thing that
[49:50] Job has to go on.
[49:53] And notice what does Job do after he
[49:56] loses everything.
[49:58] He says in verse 21,
[50:01] he Job falls to the ground and worships.
[50:04] Naked will I out of my mother's womb.
[50:07] Naked shall I return thither. The Lord
[50:09] gave and the Lord take it away. That's
[50:12] right.
[50:12] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[50:16] Amen. Amen.
[50:17] What if his what what did his four
[50:18] servants think? What did his wife think?
[50:21] What is this guy saying? And all this
[50:23] Job sin not
[50:25] or judge God foolishly. Job makes it
[50:28] through phase one of the trial with
[50:30] flying colors.
[50:33] And we always think that trials only
[50:35] have one phase.
[50:38] Job now enters phase two.
[50:42] Satan again
[50:44] is going to come before the throne of
[50:46] God. Again, he's going to go into
[50:50] negotiations with God. Yeah, God.
[50:52] Anybody will continue worshiping you
[50:55] skin for skin and man will give
[50:56] everything for his life. But uh what is
[50:59] he going to do next?
[51:02] Job chapter 2, let's go over there.
[51:05] Let's see here.
[51:07] Back to this
[51:09] again. There was a day when the sons of
[51:12] God came before the sons uh came to
[51:15] present himself before the Lord and
[51:16] Satan came also among them. And uh Satan
[51:20] says in verse four, God says, "Hey, have
[51:23] you considered my servant Job?
[51:24] Everything you've done for done against
[51:27] him. You moved me against him to destroy
[51:30] him without cause." Satan says, "Skin
[51:33] for his skin. All the men half will give
[51:34] for his life. put forth your hand now
[51:37] and touch his bone and his flesh and he
[51:39] will curse thee to thy face. And the
[51:43] Lord said, behold, he's in your hand but
[51:46] save his life. And now in the second
[51:48] part of the trial,
[51:50] God is permitting Satan to touch Job's
[51:53] health.
[51:55] And that's a really hard trial
[51:58] because when we're not feeling good,
[52:01] say, "Oh, it's not her back that hurts
[52:03] or head that hurts or not just the the
[52:06] bad feelings for too long." We start
[52:08] translating those students and not
[52:09] saying, "I'm not feeling good." We say,
[52:11] "I'm not good."
[52:13] That if you're not feeling good for a
[52:15] long enough time, we're going to start
[52:16] thinking there's something wrong with
[52:18] me.
[52:19] And just descend going darker and darker
[52:22] and darker. That's where Satan wants to
[52:25] take Job. That's right.
[52:26] He wants to strike him in his flesh and
[52:28] that's the way to get to his mind. And
[52:30] he's just going to paralyze him with
[52:32] fear, with anxiety, with depression, and
[52:35] he's just going to make Job give up.
[52:39] That is his plan.
[52:41] That's right. That's right. And Satan
[52:43] leaves um God's presence in heaven and
[52:48] he goes forth and he smites Job with
[52:51] sore boils from the sole of his feet to
[52:54] the crown of his head. Job doesn't have
[52:55] a house party. He has nothing. He's he
[52:59] he's he has no friends. He's all by
[53:01] himself. He's on this heap and he's just
[53:04] with a potur scrape trying to make his
[53:07] skin clean from these putrifying
[53:10] boils.
[53:12] He's sitting down among the ashes. His
[53:14] wife comes to him and says, "Do you
[53:16] still retain your integrity? Just curse
[53:18] God and die."
[53:21] And she's thinking thinking rationally
[53:24] almost dare to say because she life is
[53:27] this bad joke. Let's just get out of it.
[53:30] If this is what life is going to look
[53:32] like, we've had a great life so far. If
[53:34] this is how life's going to be, what do
[53:36] we need to do just to end it all? That's
[53:38] the temptation that she's laying out
[53:40] there
[53:41] and it's it's a hard one. But again,
[53:44] Job, he responds
[53:47] with such
[53:49] such certainty of God.
[53:51] He says, "What shall we receive good at
[53:54] the hand of God and shall we not receive
[53:56] evil?"
[53:58] And all this Job did not sin with his
[54:01] lips.
[54:03] And Job's story here is a very special
[54:06] one.
[54:08] He is going to be the answer to the
[54:11] question that go that Satan throws at
[54:14] God's feet. Does Job fear God for not
[54:17] the message Christ is the mystery of God
[54:19] revealed? There are a few places where
[54:21] brother Graham says something like we
[54:23] have the answer to the devil's question.
[54:25] That's right.
[54:25] Remember reading that years ago that's
[54:27] great to have the answer to the devil's
[54:29] question. But what's the question?
[54:32] Because if I have the answer, you know
[54:33] what what it goes with. And I think it
[54:35] goes with this kind of a question.
[54:37] Does Job fear God for not? Do you fear
[54:40] God for nothing?
[54:41] Right?
[54:41] And he says we have Satan's answer.
[54:43] God's vindicated himself to the that he
[54:47] proves himself his promise in this last
[54:49] day. The Lord is here at the same time.
[54:51] There's the devil's answer. He goes on
[54:53] to say, "We are his victory. The church
[54:56] is his victory. We come forth to the
[54:58] last days of this glorious gospel
[54:59] showing his victory. He died for his
[55:01] purpose. We are proof of his victory.
[55:04] Amen.
[55:05] So Job is put on the witness stand to
[55:08] answer Satan's question. And Job doesn't
[55:12] just have the answer. His life is the
[55:15] answer.
[55:16] Job the life he lives. Worshiping God in
[55:20] the worst of times when God is showering
[55:22] no blessings upon him. Job continues to
[55:25] worship God. That life is Satan's
[55:30] answer.
[55:31] He's right.
[55:42] And I just want to speak something for
[55:44] Job's wife. You know, she's the one who
[55:46] says unto him, "Do you still retain
[55:48] integrity? Curse God and die." And you
[55:51] want to notice that God didn't smite
[55:53] your debt. God doesn't do anything to
[55:56] judge her. I think that God has
[55:58] understanding for the frailties of our
[56:01] flesh. She says something. Job says,
[56:03] "You're speaking like a foolish woman
[56:04] right now." In the next chapter, Job
[56:06] could be said, "You're speaking like a
[56:08] foolish man, too." Because Job is
[56:09] starting to talk about, "I wish I were
[56:11] just dead." Now, I wish like I would
[56:14] have been still born. Job is saying the
[56:16] very same things. And God is God that
[56:19] has mercy and grace for each one of them
[56:21] because he understands the frailties of
[56:25] our flesh.
[56:28] And in Job's despair, he is wrestling
[56:31] with the why question.
[56:35] Why in Job chapter 3, why didn't I die
[56:37] for my mother's womb? Why didn't I give
[56:40] up the ghost when I came out of the
[56:42] belly? Verse 12, why did the knees
[56:44] permit me? Why did the breast nation
[56:46] suck? Verse 20. Why is light given to
[56:49] him that's in misery and life to the
[56:50] bitter and soul? Why is light given to a
[56:52] man whose way is hidden God has ended
[56:54] in? Why? Why? Why?
[56:58] This is the very same man who a chapter
[57:02] earlier says the Lord have given or it's
[57:04] taken away. Blessed be the Lord. Very
[57:08] same man.
[57:10] So this is not a weakness in Job's
[57:12] testimony from all of a sudden he's
[57:14] falling on his face before God losing
[57:16] his integrity. No, it's the same man in
[57:19] mortal human flesh. In the book of Job,
[57:22] we find his testimony. Some days he's
[57:24] making strong statements about God.
[57:27] Other days he's he's he's in the molyrs
[57:30] really, really low and other days he's
[57:31] up and down, up and down. But it's the
[57:34] same job through all of his more ups and
[57:36] downs that God says, you consider the
[57:39] man like my servant Job, upright, fears
[57:42] God. Job's testimony was pristine. Yet,
[57:47] that doesn't change that he's human.
[57:49] That's right.
[57:51] In times of testing, Job's first
[57:53] question was why? Why? Why?
[57:56] And as hard as it is, I just want to
[57:59] suggest that that's not the most useful
[58:02] question
[58:03] for us to ask.
[58:04] That's right.
[58:05] Because hidden behind the why question
[58:08] is really a fingered accusation.
[58:10] Right. God, I'm asking why, but really,
[58:14] it's your fault and you're not dealing
[58:16] with me fairly or justly.
[58:19] And in Job chapter 3, he's marinated in
[58:22] his why questions so long that in
[58:25] chapter 4, he starts accusing God
[58:29] and going to the next step. So, our
[58:31] first question really shouldn't be why,
[58:35] but what?
[58:36] What can I get out of this? Not how can
[58:39] I get out of this? That's what Job's
[58:41] wife was asking. How can I get out of
[58:42] this? But the best question is, what can
[58:45] I get out of this? Because God is not
[58:48] wasting pain. He's not wasting. Right.
[58:51] That's right.
[58:53] Job's friends came
[58:57] and I'd say they probably helped him the
[58:59] most when they just sat with him and
[59:01] said nothing.
[59:03] Because explanations rarely help a human
[59:07] heart. Right.
[59:08] Expectations don't help those who hurt.
[59:11] Job's friends, they heard his words
[59:13] throughout the entire book. They hear
[59:15] his words, but they don't hear his pain.
[59:18] Instead, they wrangle with his words
[59:21] and they never minister to his heart.
[59:24] And when they hear they they they come
[59:28] at the end of chapter 2, they hear his
[59:31] why why why they hear him venting his
[59:34] spleen. Chapter 3, they hear his
[59:36] accusations with God. Sometimes in
[59:38] chapter 4, Elephas comes up and he just
[59:41] hammers Job. This job, you need to get
[59:45] right with God.
[59:47] And all they're doing is listening to
[59:49] the words, but they never pause saying,
[59:51] "Why is he saying these things? What's
[59:54] going on in his heart?"
[59:55] That's right.
[59:56] And it's so interesting. His friends
[59:59] deal with Job's words. God never does.
[1:00:02] That's right. And God never deals with
[1:00:05] Job according to what Job says. Cuz Job
[1:00:07] says some pretty rough things about it.
[1:00:09] At one point he thinks says God is like
[1:00:12] an archer shooting poison arrows at me
[1:00:15] and my spirit is sucking up poison from
[1:00:18] the arrows and I'm dying. God is hunting
[1:00:22] me. God is trying to kill me. He's that
[1:00:25] is this picture of God in the midst of
[1:00:27] this suffering. And God never comes
[1:00:30] along and says, "Jo, how could you say
[1:00:31] that about me? I have done so much for
[1:00:33] you. You are false. God doesn't do that.
[1:00:37] In fact, at the end of the book, God
[1:00:39] says that Job's friends did not speak
[1:00:42] what is right about me, but my servant
[1:00:44] Job has.
[1:00:46] That's right.
[1:00:46] It's like God isn't God is ignoring
[1:00:49] sometimes Job's words
[1:00:51] and he's hearing his heart. But I
[1:00:54] thought when I when I when I read this
[1:00:55] as of the men, how often as a husband do
[1:00:58] I respond to the words that my wife has
[1:01:01] thrown at me?
[1:01:02] And instead of just
[1:01:05] listening to what the heart might be
[1:01:07] said, say the same thing about my kids.
[1:01:09] I I my kids I'm right on top of that.
[1:01:13] But maybe better is to slow things down
[1:01:15] and try to deal with them like we want
[1:01:17] God to deal with us.
[1:01:19] We like to deal with people's words.
[1:01:21] hurt what other people do with our
[1:01:22] hearts.
[1:01:23] We need to try to do the same thing.
[1:01:26] Joe's friends heard the words but not
[1:01:28] his pain and they argued with him
[1:01:30] instead of ministering to him.
[1:01:35] Does reading an X-ray or take the pain
[1:01:37] of a broken leg away?
[1:01:39] You go to urgent care. Oh man, this is
[1:01:41] killing me. They take the X-ray and the
[1:01:43] doctor shows, man, you got a broken leg.
[1:01:45] Oh, I feel so much better now. No, no.
[1:01:49] Explaining the source of the pain
[1:01:51] doesn't solve the problem.
[1:01:54] We live on promises, on explanations.
[1:01:57] So, we shouldn't spend too much time
[1:01:59] asking God why.
[1:02:01] And if you notice, God never answers the
[1:02:05] why question. That's right. He never
[1:02:07] tells Job why.
[1:02:11] Because the reason doesn't help us. We
[1:02:14] need God more than we need any kind of
[1:02:16] reason.
[1:02:18] [Music]
[1:02:20] So now Job's friends, they're going to
[1:02:22] start talking to him. And Elf, the
[1:02:25] Temonites, he's the uh he's the first
[1:02:27] one. And uh one uh one commentator has
[1:02:31] said what Satan could not do with all
[1:02:33] the Seans and the Calaldanss and the
[1:02:35] winds and the and the fires that he does
[1:02:38] with the debating approaches and
[1:02:40] controversial assaults of Job's friends.
[1:02:43] Oh, the curse of controversy.
[1:02:47] Job's friends, they weren't a super good
[1:02:50] help to him. So, Elephaz starts out
[1:02:53] coming. And uh to Elephaz, God always
[1:02:57] has whatever God has done in the past,
[1:02:59] he has to do now. I have known God. Do
[1:03:02] this in my in my past experience. That's
[1:03:05] how God's going to deal with you now.
[1:03:06] And we know that Jesus Christ is the
[1:03:08] same yesterday, today, and forever. But
[1:03:11] we have to give God elbow room.
[1:03:13] God is going to be God. We can say that
[1:03:15] God's always done this, this, or this,
[1:03:17] but God will always be greater than our
[1:03:19] expectations of him. And we have to give
[1:03:22] God that room because Elephaz and his
[1:03:26] friends think they know everything about
[1:03:28] Job's situation. But the one thing they
[1:03:30] don't know is the most important thing,
[1:03:32] and that's the background of chapter
[1:03:34] one.
[1:03:34] That God says Job is perfect, upright,
[1:03:38] fears God, assues evil. The reason he's
[1:03:41] going through this is because God is
[1:03:44] putting Job on the witness stand and Job
[1:03:46] is the battleground between God and
[1:03:47] Satan. They don't know the background
[1:03:49] and they're going to draw all the wrong
[1:03:52] conclusions because of that. So, Elephaz
[1:03:57] starts out, well, Job, whoever perished
[1:04:01] being innocent. Elad's going to speak
[1:04:04] with cold logic here. We're on the wrong
[1:04:07] screen here. Yeah. He's saying, "Job,
[1:04:10] the innocent don't perish. You're
[1:04:13] perishing. Therefore, Job, you must not
[1:04:16] be innocent." That's how he's dealing
[1:04:19] with them. But you never you're never
[1:04:20] going to heal somebody with just cold
[1:04:22] logic.
[1:04:23] He says, "Happy is the man whom God
[1:04:26] correctth." Job, look on the bright
[1:04:28] side. God's just correcting you.
[1:04:31] And God's not done with you, so look on
[1:04:33] the bright side. It'll be fine. And I
[1:04:35] can remember one time after my wife got
[1:04:36] out of the hospital, I was reading my
[1:04:38] Bible there at breakfast. I was there by
[1:04:40] myself in the kitchen and she comes down
[1:04:42] and my you reading your Bible this
[1:04:44] morning. Great. Let me see what you've
[1:04:47] been reading. I can get a blessing
[1:04:48] today, too. And I've been reading in Job
[1:04:50] chapter 5. I have this scripture that's
[1:04:51] highlighted. And she reads Job 5:17,
[1:04:54] "Happy is the man whom God correctth."
[1:04:58] What's that saying about me?
[1:05:01] That's that's what Elephaz is saying.
[1:05:04] and his words have a grain of truth to
[1:05:06] them. If God is correcting you, it can
[1:05:10] end out well. But if you're speaking
[1:05:12] that to someone who God's not
[1:05:13] correcting,
[1:05:14] that's right.
[1:05:15] That's just going to be confusing.
[1:05:17] And then all of Job's friends are going
[1:05:19] to kind of rehash this line, saying,
[1:05:21] "Job, you can see things aren't going so
[1:05:23] well for you." So Job, just confess your
[1:05:26] sins and God will restore everything
[1:05:28] that you've lost. Just do this, Job. But
[1:05:31] if you know what this is really a
[1:05:33] paraphrase of what Satan had said at the
[1:05:35] beginning,
[1:05:36] does Job fear God for nothing? Job just
[1:05:38] fear God again and you'll get the stuff
[1:05:41] back
[1:05:43] and Job's not going to fall for it.
[1:05:46] So with Elephas and his friends, you'll
[1:05:48] notice there are times when they say
[1:05:50] right things,
[1:05:52] but they're speaking the right things to
[1:05:54] the wrong person.
[1:05:56] And brother Brandham says there's three
[1:05:57] things in the scripture you cannot do.
[1:05:59] three musts. You must not misinterpret
[1:06:01] the word, misplace the word, or
[1:06:04] dislocate the word. If you do any of
[1:06:06] these three things, you throw the whole
[1:06:08] thing into a confusion into chaos. And
[1:06:11] that's what Job's three friends did the
[1:06:13] entire time. They misinterpreted,
[1:06:16] dislocated, misplaced the word, and it
[1:06:19] threw Job into a chaos. They were trying
[1:06:22] to be helpful, just like people are
[1:06:24] sending you text messages in their
[1:06:25] trials sometimes that don't land the way
[1:06:27] they were intended to.
[1:06:29] They mean well, but they might be saying
[1:06:32] the right thing to the wrong person.
[1:06:34] Billad just continues with it. Billad's
[1:06:37] going to be saying, "Job, God's justice
[1:06:39] is perfect. Who are you to fight God's
[1:06:41] justice?" Well, Job wasn't going through
[1:06:43] a trial of God's justice. Billad thought
[1:06:46] he was. And he actually goes goes there.
[1:06:48] He says in this translation, Job, it's
[1:06:50] plain that your children sinned against
[1:06:52] God. Otherwise, why would God have
[1:06:54] punished them?
[1:06:56] He says some some really harsh things
[1:07:00] and he says again, Job, just seek the
[1:07:02] Lord. If you were pure and right, he'd
[1:07:04] prosper you. Again, these friends are
[1:07:06] just rehashing the devil's line. Job,
[1:07:09] just do right and God will bless you
[1:07:11] again. But Job isn't going to fall for
[1:07:14] it.
[1:07:18] And it gets worse and worse. Zofar just
[1:07:20] says as he starts speaking, Job, you're
[1:07:23] a windbag, a liar. That's my paraphrase.
[1:07:26] Who can stop listen to the the wind of
[1:07:28] these words? That's what he's calling
[1:07:30] him. God is actually punishing you less
[1:07:32] than you deserve. He suggests that in
[1:07:34] Job 11:6. And you know what?
[1:07:38] Have we ever said that to our kids
[1:07:40] before? I'm being nice to you. You
[1:07:42] deserve a lot worse than I'm giving to
[1:07:43] you. Um, but that's kind of Zofar is is
[1:07:47] saying that.
[1:07:49] Then he says, Job, you should have known
[1:07:51] better.
[1:07:53] You were prosperous for a time and the
[1:07:55] prosperity is gone. That's because
[1:07:57] you're wicked because the triumphing of
[1:07:59] the wicked is short. The joy of the
[1:08:00] hypocrite is for a moment. Job, your
[1:08:03] experience is proof. You're a wicked
[1:08:06] person. You're a hypocrite. You're a
[1:08:07] seeker, a sinner. Repent so the good
[1:08:10] stuff can come back.
[1:08:12] That's how his friends keep on
[1:08:15] approaching him. And we're not going to
[1:08:17] go through all the arguments cuz really
[1:08:19] in rounds two and three, they just get
[1:08:21] louder and louder. But they're saying
[1:08:23] the very same things again and again and
[1:08:27] again. If you were Job,
[1:08:31] what would you say? You're just you're
[1:08:34] you're feeling bad already.
[1:08:36] Then you're hearing all these
[1:08:38] accusations.
[1:08:39] What do you say is you try to defend
[1:08:41] yourself? Well, one of his main question
[1:08:45] is, Lord, how long is this trial going
[1:08:48] to last?
[1:08:50] He's going through a really heavy trial.
[1:08:52] It is a bitter trial. He feels like
[1:08:55] there is no hope in this. It is just
[1:08:57] completely hopeless. And if we look in
[1:09:00] Job chapter 7, Job kind of looks at
[1:09:04] says, "God,
[1:09:06] beginning times and ending times are
[1:09:08] baked into the human condition.
[1:09:11] There's an appointed time to man on
[1:09:13] earth. There's a beginning time and
[1:09:15] ending time. You hire somebody, he's
[1:09:17] going to have appointed time. It's a
[1:09:19] servant. You go out to the field in the
[1:09:20] morning around noon, you see where the
[1:09:22] sun is. I know about how far I am. Dusk,
[1:09:26] I'm about done. God, I should have that
[1:09:29] kind of knowledge in my trial, too. I
[1:09:31] should be able to see where's the middle
[1:09:33] point. Where approximately is this going
[1:09:35] to end? We would feel that if we feel
[1:09:38] like if we know how if there's we know
[1:09:39] there's an end point, how much further
[1:09:41] we have to go, that could be
[1:09:42] psychologically easier for us. And Job
[1:09:45] saying, "God, this is how it is in all
[1:09:47] humanity." But it's not with me. Why not
[1:09:52] God?
[1:09:54] I am made to possess months of vanity.
[1:09:58] Wearyome nights are appointed to me.
[1:10:00] This is not just a week or two trial
[1:10:01] with Joel. This is at least months long.
[1:10:04] When I lie down, I say, "Oh,
[1:10:07] when am I going to arise?" Just have
[1:10:09] this whole thing be repeated again. He's
[1:10:12] he's surviving
[1:10:14] the night, then he has to go through the
[1:10:15] day. And it's just it's just a really
[1:10:17] really hard time. How long God? And then
[1:10:21] as he keeps being accused by his
[1:10:23] friends, he keeps asking,
[1:10:26] "How can anybody be righteous before
[1:10:28] God?" If you get down to it, I'm sure if
[1:10:30] you in investigated my life, you could
[1:10:32] probably find some little failures. He's
[1:10:33] saying, "How can a man be just compared
[1:10:37] to God?
[1:10:39] How can I get God to vindicate my
[1:10:43] righteousness?"
[1:10:45] And that's again, Job wants God to be
[1:10:48] his witness and he's desperately crying
[1:10:50] out for that. But the whole time he is
[1:10:53] being God's witness. He doesn't He has
[1:10:56] no clue about it. But he continues to
[1:10:59] hold fast to his integrity. He's not
[1:11:01] going to say, "Okay, maybe I'm going
[1:11:02] through this trial. Maybe I don't have
[1:11:04] the baptism of the Holy Spirit like I
[1:11:05] had, so I'm going to go ahead and
[1:11:06] confess. I need I need to be prayed for
[1:11:08] again." He's not going to do that. No,
[1:11:10] I'm going to hold fast to my integrity.
[1:11:11] I have been serving God. God has dealt
[1:11:14] with me. I don't know what what's going
[1:11:16] on is going on, but I'm going to stand
[1:11:18] strong before him. I am certain of God.
[1:11:25] He wants to meet God in court. He says
[1:11:28] this desperately, and part of it is,
[1:11:29] man, as soon as he says it, what he
[1:11:32] almost, what have I just said? What a
[1:11:34] frightful thought having to meet God in
[1:11:36] court. What would I even say if I got
[1:11:38] there? he thinks. And even if I were to
[1:11:42] declare my innocence, would that help?
[1:11:45] Because he's still thinking of God
[1:11:46] sometimes
[1:11:48] as this great hunter who's after him.
[1:11:51] And Job chapter 6, the arrows of the
[1:11:53] Almighty, poisons seeping into my
[1:11:57] spirit. You hunt me like a fierce lion.
[1:11:59] If that's your image of God through your
[1:12:01] trial or sometimes in your trial, it's
[1:12:03] going to be hard to think if I could go
[1:12:05] and talk to God, is that going to help
[1:12:08] anything?
[1:12:09] that that's that that's part of his uh
[1:12:12] that's part of his problem.
[1:12:14] Which leads him to say, "If I only had a
[1:12:18] mediator, someone who could stand in the
[1:12:21] gap for me, who could go and speak for
[1:12:24] me. If I only had this mediator in the
[1:12:27] east, um this person was called a a
[1:12:29] daysman." So it' be two two people maybe
[1:12:32] with a business transaction or maybe
[1:12:34] they're neighbors and they they're
[1:12:36] having disputes in the days now would be
[1:12:37] somebody who gets them both together at
[1:12:39] the table handing either one of us. Okay
[1:12:41] guys, we're going to talk this out and
[1:12:42] we're not going to leave until we're
[1:12:43] friends again. Job saying, "I wish I had
[1:12:46] somebody like that who could bring us
[1:12:48] together in a safe space and we could
[1:12:51] resolve these differences." But you know
[1:12:52] what? God isn't a man.
[1:12:54] That's right.
[1:12:55] As I am that I should answer him and we
[1:12:57] come together in judgment. And there
[1:12:59] isn't a days man betw twix us that might
[1:13:02] lay his hand upon us both. Job wants
[1:13:06] that. But he said that's not the way
[1:13:08] this is. I wish there would be a days. I
[1:13:10] wish there would be a mediator, someone
[1:13:12] to stand in the gap for me, but that is
[1:13:15] not the way life seems to be made here.
[1:13:25] So that's in a in a nutshell how Job has
[1:13:27] been trying to answer and uh and and
[1:13:31] defend himself against the charges of
[1:13:32] his friends.
[1:13:34] At the end of the book though, let's
[1:13:36] turn over to Job chapter 32. And we're
[1:13:38] going to meet a young man who uh we
[1:13:42] don't know when he he joined uh uh this
[1:13:46] discussion group, we'll call it, for
[1:13:48] lack of a better word. Um but Job has
[1:13:50] been there on the ice sheep. uh Zofar,
[1:13:53] Bildad, and Elephaz. They're all there
[1:13:55] with him. And Elahu,
[1:13:59] I don't know when he comes, but he
[1:14:00] perhaps comes up and he he listens to
[1:14:03] these men going back and forth and just
[1:14:05] raking Job over the coal, so to speak.
[1:14:08] He listens to him. And because he's
[1:14:10] younger than all of them, he waits until
[1:14:12] they're done before he starts to speak.
[1:14:15] And once he starts to speak,
[1:14:18] he has a special message for Job. And
[1:14:21] that's what we want to take a look at
[1:14:23] Elu.
[1:14:25] Who was he? Because uh Ellew the other
[1:14:29] men have buildad the shoe height. Elfaz
[1:14:32] the temonite. Elhu is just Elu.
[1:14:36] That's right.
[1:14:37] Who is he?
[1:14:40] Interestingly enough, he's the only
[1:14:42] character in the story who has God
[1:14:45] identified in his name. None of the
[1:14:48] other characters have an attri are
[1:14:50] expressing an attribute of God in their
[1:14:53] name. Elahu means he is my God and it is
[1:14:58] given in Job 32 that it is Elahu
[1:15:01] um the son of Barakel and Barakel is
[1:15:05] father means God blesses. There's
[1:15:08] something interesting about Elohu
[1:15:12] and
[1:15:14] Elue has listened to this debate raging
[1:15:17] and raging. This might have taken weeks.
[1:15:19] We don't know how long this is going on.
[1:15:21] He he's he's listening to it.
[1:15:24] And like we said, each with each round,
[1:15:27] everybody is raising their voices louder
[1:15:29] and and sharpening their arguments and
[1:15:31] and being more hurtful in their use of
[1:15:34] words. And and really I wonder if
[1:15:36] sometimes Job's friends don't push him
[1:15:39] further to to to say things that he
[1:15:40] probably wouldn't have said if they'd
[1:15:43] been speaking to him differently. But
[1:15:46] anger has really ruled the roost here in
[1:15:50] this in this in this discussion group so
[1:15:53] far. And
[1:15:56] anybody can become angry.
[1:16:01] That's easy.
[1:16:03] But to be angry with the right person
[1:16:07] to the right degree
[1:16:09] at the right time
[1:16:11] for the right purpose
[1:16:13] in the right way. That is not easy.
[1:16:19] And somehow Elohu does that
[1:16:24] because every time Job's friends have
[1:16:27] spoken,
[1:16:29] Elfaz finishes and Job jumps right in
[1:16:31] there and argues back against him. And
[1:16:33] then Buildad answers and then Job jumps
[1:16:35] up and argues back against him. Then
[1:16:37] Zofar answers. Job jumps back up and
[1:16:40] argues back against him. And it goes and
[1:16:42] goes and goes like this. But Elohu, he
[1:16:44] just starts speaking
[1:16:47] and Job says nothing.
[1:16:50] That is a gift to be able to bring some
[1:16:54] kind of word of correction because
[1:16:57] Elohim isn't just saying Job, poor guy,
[1:16:59] you'll be with him. He's not say he's
[1:17:00] not just saying that. He is he's
[1:17:02] bringing a word of correction to Job,
[1:17:04] too. He's different, though. And that's
[1:17:08] a that's a really special thing.
[1:17:12] Job is Elu rather is here. He's trying
[1:17:15] to change the focus because for the
[1:17:18] entire speech, for the entire book of
[1:17:21] Job, Job has been talking about himself,
[1:17:25] how he feels, his trial, how hopeless it
[1:17:28] is. And then Job's friends are accusing
[1:17:30] him and he responds back. Job and his
[1:17:33] misery have been the focus of
[1:17:36] everything.
[1:17:38] And Elahu comes back here and he's
[1:17:40] trying to change the focus is God's
[1:17:42] we're going to stop stop talking about
[1:17:44] Job so much and we're going to start
[1:17:46] talking about God
[1:17:48] and he's train changing the focus off of
[1:17:51] Job self and trying to get Job's eyes to
[1:17:55] God. And I kind of see Eloh here as a
[1:17:58] forerunner. He's preparing the way
[1:18:01] because in just a few chapters God's
[1:18:03] going to come down on the scene and he's
[1:18:05] going to speak to Job. But while
[1:18:07] everybody's eyes are right here at Job,
[1:18:09] God's be speaking from here. They need
[1:18:11] to be ready. They need to have their
[1:18:12] hearts turned, their eyes turned. Eloh
[1:18:14] does this, guys. Start looking to God.
[1:18:16] Start looking to God. And by the time
[1:18:18] Eloh is done, Job's no longer the focus.
[1:18:22] It is God who's the focus. And then God
[1:18:25] comes down and speaks. And we'll get to
[1:18:27] that in a minute. Elohu is different.
[1:18:30] His approach is different. There's
[1:18:33] something about how he says that no
[1:18:35] debate or no argument is sparked. His
[1:18:41] great concern was not to debate what Job
[1:18:44] said about himself, but to refute what
[1:18:47] Job said about God. And notice how he
[1:18:50] does this. Brother Brand says, "After a
[1:18:52] while, from the east came a little
[1:18:54] prince by the name of Elahu representing
[1:18:56] Jesus Christ. And first he began to
[1:18:59] straighten Job out about where he'd done
[1:19:01] wrong and things of accusing God. Job
[1:19:05] says some pretty hard things about God.
[1:19:07] And then when he began to speak to him
[1:19:10] not as a sinner,
[1:19:13] when Elephaz spoke to him or Bildad
[1:19:15] spoke to him or Zofar spoke to him, they
[1:19:18] had their minds made up about Job. They
[1:19:20] knew exactly what the case was. Knew
[1:19:22] exactly what Job had to do. If he does
[1:19:23] this, this is exactly what's going to
[1:19:25] happen. They had their minds made up.
[1:19:26] They spoke to him as a sinner and all
[1:19:29] they got was argument and controversy.
[1:19:33] But Elu comes in here. He doesn't raise
[1:19:36] any of the crazy things that Job has
[1:19:38] said about God. He doesn't raise those
[1:19:40] up. He speaks to Job's heart. He speaks
[1:19:42] to Job's pain.
[1:19:44] Notice what Job's friends do. They
[1:19:47] remind Job each time they speak about
[1:19:49] the bad things he might have said or
[1:19:51] something he might have done. But Job is
[1:19:54] this the same guy who says God is like a
[1:19:56] a lion trying to hunt me. He's the same
[1:19:58] God who the same guy who said the Lord
[1:20:00] giveth, the Lord taketh away. Blessed be
[1:20:02] the name of the Lord.
[1:20:03] That's right.
[1:20:04] A real friend would remind you about a
[1:20:07] positive confession you'd made.
[1:20:09] Job remember he just said, "Naked came I
[1:20:12] out of the mother's womb. Naked I would
[1:20:14] go back to it. Blessed be the name." You
[1:20:16] could have reminded him about that.
[1:20:18] Taken him back to when he's saying
[1:20:19] something good. Every time they speak,
[1:20:21] they're taking it back to mistakes they
[1:20:23] think he made or bad things he could
[1:20:25] have done. Elhu is the opposite. He goes
[1:20:27] back and reminds Job about some good
[1:20:30] things that he said.
[1:20:32] Elohu has listened.
[1:20:36] It's obvious when he speaks that he's
[1:20:38] been listening to Job because he one of
[1:20:42] one of the things that Job is asked
[1:20:43] about says uh um if you if you plant a
[1:20:47] seed, that seed's going to rise back up
[1:20:49] again. and it'll it'll birth into a
[1:20:50] flower. The dead seed is resurrected in
[1:20:53] the in in the flower. But what about me?
[1:20:56] If I die, will a man live again? And
[1:20:58] he's asking about these things. And Job
[1:21:00] makes some makes some incredible
[1:21:03] expressions of resurrection
[1:21:06] in the book. It's like come what is a we
[1:21:09] can't say it's the purpose of a trial.
[1:21:10] What is the good thing that comes out of
[1:21:11] the trial is God pushes revelation out
[1:21:14] of us. Sometimes we don't know what's in
[1:21:17] us. Son of Job is brought to a point.
[1:21:19] The only thing he can say is my he's
[1:21:22] faithful though he slay me yet I'll
[1:21:24] trust him. Those are the things that his
[1:21:26] friends heard but they didn't respond
[1:21:28] to. But Elahude does respond to some of
[1:21:31] these things.
[1:21:34] He said, "Job, you're watching those
[1:21:36] flowers. They're in God's way. They
[1:21:38] haven't sinned. There's nothing about
[1:21:40] them that sin. But man sinned. That's
[1:21:43] the reason you don't see him no more."
[1:21:44] when he goes down, he goes to shield. We
[1:21:46] don't see him anymore. But Job, there's
[1:21:48] coming a just one who will stand in the
[1:21:50] breach. Elu has been listening. He knows
[1:21:53] that Job's heart is crying for a
[1:21:55] mediator. And that's a big part of what
[1:21:57] El is going to speak to him about. He's
[1:22:00] been listening. If Job's friends had
[1:22:03] been better listeners, they might have
[1:22:05] been better friends. Mhm. That's right.
[1:22:10] Why do bad things happen to good people?
[1:22:14] Why does tragedy strike like it does
[1:22:16] sometimes? And Elohu is going to bring
[1:22:19] new light to this age-old question.
[1:22:24] First off, suffering is not just about
[1:22:26] punishment. Now, there can be if you go
[1:22:29] if you exceed the speed limit by really
[1:22:32] egregious amounts, you just might get
[1:22:35] caught by a state trooper and you might
[1:22:37] have some suffering to do it that you've
[1:22:38] brought about yourself. Suffering can be
[1:22:41] a um can be a form of punishment. It can
[1:22:44] be. But that's not the only way to
[1:22:47] explain things. And Eloh is going to
[1:22:50] tell us that God can also preserve us
[1:22:53] from evil.
[1:22:54] That's right. or speak to us personally
[1:22:57] through difficult things that we go
[1:23:00] through. And we can take a look in our
[1:23:02] Bibles to Job chapter 33
[1:23:05] and uh Job 33 and let's look at verse
[1:23:08] we'll start at verse 14
[1:23:14] says God speaketh once y twice yet man
[1:23:19] perceives it not. How is God going to
[1:23:21] speak? Well, first he goes back in 15
[1:23:24] and it talks God can speak in a dream or
[1:23:26] in a vision of the night. He's been
[1:23:28] listening because that's how Elephas
[1:23:29] said God spoke. God came to me in a
[1:23:32] vision of the night and I saw this job.
[1:23:34] And Ellie says no, God can speak that
[1:23:36] way when deep sleep fallth upon men and
[1:23:39] slumberings upon the bed. Why is he
[1:23:41] doing this? He's opening the ears of
[1:23:43] men, sealing their instruction that he
[1:23:45] may withdraw man from his purpose and
[1:23:48] hide pride from man. God might be
[1:23:51] speaking us to with to to to change our
[1:23:53] minds about something to divert our
[1:23:56] direction a different way. Verse 18, he
[1:24:00] keepeth back his soul from the pit and
[1:24:03] his life from perishing by the sword.
[1:24:06] One of the purposes of pain could be to
[1:24:09] or one of the purposes of any message
[1:24:10] from God could be like verse 18 says to
[1:24:14] keep back his soul from the pit. So a
[1:24:17] message that God might be speaking
[1:24:18] through his words, through a dream or a
[1:24:20] vision could have that purpose. But then
[1:24:22] he goes on there is God speaks in one
[1:24:24] way. Yay too. He said in verse 14 and
[1:24:26] here's the second part. Someone could be
[1:24:28] chasened also with pain upon his bed and
[1:24:31] the multitude of his bones with strong
[1:24:33] pain and he abhores bread. His soul
[1:24:35] abhores his dainty meat. And the purpose
[1:24:38] could still be the same. God is trying
[1:24:40] to keep back his soul from the pit. One
[1:24:43] purpose of pain, it can be to protect
[1:24:45] the soul of man from the pit, to
[1:24:49] preserve us from something worse. And if
[1:24:53] God is God and we're human beings, God
[1:24:56] is going to know much more about our
[1:24:58] situation than we do.
[1:25:00] So our abil our inability to explain a
[1:25:03] good reason for this doesn't mean there
[1:25:04] isn't because God is infinite and he
[1:25:07] could have a a good reason that we've
[1:25:09] never even thought of.
[1:25:12] The apostle Paul expands upon this in
[1:25:14] the New Testament as the apostle Paul he
[1:25:18] was uh he he he suffered as well. He was
[1:25:21] given a thorn in the flesh and uh why
[1:25:25] was that thorn in the flesh given to
[1:25:27] prevent him to protect him from
[1:25:30] temptation.
[1:25:33] Lest I should be exalted above measure
[1:25:35] through the abundance of the
[1:25:36] revelations. There was given to me a
[1:25:38] thorn in the flesh, the messenger of
[1:25:41] Satan to buffet me, lest I should be
[1:25:44] exalted above measure.
[1:25:47] We don't know what this was, but God
[1:25:49] allowed Paul to be buffeted by this
[1:25:52] messenger of Satan, and it had a good
[1:25:55] purpose in his life. Paul resisted it.
[1:25:57] He prayed against it multiple times. He
[1:26:00] besought the Lord three times. God, I
[1:26:02] pray you'd take this thing away from me.
[1:26:04] And God didn't.
[1:26:06] And finally Paul just accepted the
[1:26:09] situation as it was
[1:26:13] and God's sovereignty in it.
[1:26:15] And you can imagine Paul might have been
[1:26:17] tempted trying to cast that devil out of
[1:26:19] him. But this is something that God had
[1:26:22] allowed in him. God could have God could
[1:26:25] have healed him.
[1:26:26] That's right.
[1:26:27] But when it was abundantly clear to Paul
[1:26:29] that God is something else, Paul
[1:26:31] accepted what God had and God gave him
[1:26:35] grace. My grace is sufficient for thee.
[1:26:38] My strength is made perfect in weakness.
[1:26:41] More gladly I will glory in your in my
[1:26:43] infirmities that the power of Christ may
[1:26:46] rest upon me. I take pleasure in
[1:26:47] infirmities for Christ's sake. Suffering
[1:26:51] can preserve us from temptation and it
[1:26:53] can also draw us closer to God so he can
[1:26:55] teach us.
[1:26:57] Now at the beginning of the book of Job,
[1:26:58] Job was already close to God.
[1:27:02] So these were still situations that
[1:27:03] don't explain Job's situation. But Elohu
[1:27:06] is basically just trying to tell these
[1:27:07] men who are around Job, your one
[1:27:10] explanation for every role of suffering
[1:27:12] is insufficient. There are these other
[1:27:14] things that can can explain why it is.
[1:27:18] So Job was already close to God. He
[1:27:20] would didn't have to go through this to
[1:27:21] get closer. But we can see but did but
[1:27:25] did Job get closer to God through it
[1:27:27] all? He certainly did.
[1:27:29] And
[1:27:32] it's easy for it would it was easy for
[1:27:34] Job or sorry for for the Apostle Paul to
[1:27:37] try to cast this sword in the flesh out.
[1:27:39] That's a really easy thing to try to do
[1:27:41] cuz this is this is spiritual war. I
[1:27:42] know what I'm supposed to do with this.
[1:27:44] But it can be harder sometimes
[1:27:46] to just accept what God's put in their
[1:27:48] lives for whatever purpose and God may
[1:27:50] your grace be sufficient for me. And um
[1:27:55] one one theologian said, "It's a greater
[1:27:57] thing to pray for pain's conversion than
[1:28:00] for its removal. God, whatever I'm going
[1:28:03] through, would you use it to make me
[1:28:06] stronger?" And I can remember years
[1:28:08] back, I was going through some uh um
[1:28:11] mental battles, wasn't wasn't feeling
[1:28:13] real uh real good about things. And I
[1:28:15] was uh going for a walk around Breast
[1:28:17] Reservoir there in Lima. And uh as I'm
[1:28:21] thinking, as I'm praying, as I am
[1:28:22] meditating, I'm my mind goes to the book
[1:28:25] of James. Behold, we count them happy
[1:28:27] which endure. P let let patience have
[1:28:30] her perfect work, that he may be perfect
[1:28:32] and entire, wanting nothing. And as I'm
[1:28:35] thinking of that and meditating on that,
[1:28:37] the the visual image I get in my mind is
[1:28:40] of this guy being wheeled on a gurnie to
[1:28:43] have open heart surgery, which I'm told
[1:28:45] is not a very pleasant experience. you
[1:28:47] just get torn open. It doesn't feel good
[1:28:49] at all. And I'm sure for the person
[1:28:51] who's in that experience, they they
[1:28:53] would love not to have to. And if they
[1:28:55] don't understand it, they think, man,
[1:28:57] these messengers of Satan are trying to
[1:28:59] get at my heart. They're trying to
[1:29:01] torment me. They can try to be wrestling
[1:29:02] against the doctors. I don't want this.
[1:29:04] I don't want this. But if God's got this
[1:29:06] here, I need to stay on the operating
[1:29:08] table until God's done.
[1:29:12] And not just jump off the operating
[1:29:13] table when we're done. Only trouble is
[1:29:16] we don't know when God's done. That's
[1:29:17] right.
[1:29:18] But let patience have a perfect work
[1:29:20] that we may be perfect and entire
[1:29:23] wanting nothing. Stay there until God's
[1:29:26] done working on your heart. It's easier.
[1:29:29] It's a greater thing to pray for pain's
[1:29:31] conversion to grace
[1:29:33] than to pray for its removal.
[1:29:35] We all want to pray. I pray many times,
[1:29:37] God, just get me out of this trial. But
[1:29:39] I need to pray more. God, help me to get
[1:29:41] something out of this trial. That's what
[1:29:43] we're meant to be praying for.
[1:29:48] And then Elohu goes back to Job's great
[1:29:51] desire for a mediator and he says, "God
[1:29:55] has provided a mediator." Turn. We're in
[1:29:58] Job 33 and he's been talking about this
[1:30:01] person who's being chasened in verse 22.
[1:30:04] This person is suffering. His soul was
[1:30:07] drawing near to the grave.
[1:30:09] And verse 23 says, "If there be a
[1:30:13] messenger
[1:30:15] with him," and that word messenger is
[1:30:18] that means angel of the Lord. If there
[1:30:21] were a messenger with this person who is
[1:30:24] suffering so badly, someone who can
[1:30:28] interpret his situation to him and know
[1:30:32] the truth about the situation because
[1:30:34] Satan is putting all kinds of
[1:30:36] interpretation in your mind about
[1:30:38] yourself, about God who is supposed to
[1:30:40] be now your tormentor instead of your
[1:30:42] provider and helper. If there's someone
[1:30:44] who could an angel of the Lord can be a
[1:30:47] messenger from God, be there with him,
[1:30:49] an interpreter, one among a thousand.
[1:30:52] This is a really special case to show
[1:30:55] unto man his uprightness
[1:30:58] that'll come and stand between the man
[1:31:01] and him who's the judge and say,
[1:31:03] "Deliver him from going down to the pit.
[1:31:05] I have found a ransom." This is the
[1:31:09] mediator that Job was calling out for
[1:31:12] this messenger. When God when the Bible
[1:31:14] talks about an angel of the Lord, this
[1:31:16] is when Jehovah himself like in the book
[1:31:18] of Judges, he'll come down and someone's
[1:31:21] offering a sacrifice and they look back
[1:31:24] and it's this guy. It's this man says,
[1:31:27] "Who are you?" And and there's this
[1:31:28] confusion. Is this a prophet? Who is
[1:31:30] this? And then all of a sudden, this
[1:31:32] angel of the Lord steps up into the
[1:31:33] altar and goes up in the flame and says,
[1:31:35] "This is this has been God himself. I've
[1:31:37] looked upon God." This angel of the Lord
[1:31:40] is God coming down taking skin on
[1:31:42] himself becoming tangible in our trials.
[1:31:46] That's what Job have been crying out
[1:31:47] for. And now he says there's another
[1:31:50] purpose in suffering because we can have
[1:31:52] God speaks in our suffering through a
[1:31:54] mediator who can come and speak on our
[1:31:57] behalf. And this is what God this is
[1:32:00] what brother Brandis says Job is crying
[1:32:02] out for. Job saying, "Oh, if I only knew
[1:32:05] where he was." But God was dealing with
[1:32:08] a saint in this case. And there this
[1:32:10] saint there was there scraping his
[1:32:11] boils. Some of his church friends had
[1:32:14] come to him sat with their backs turned
[1:32:15] to him. Not much consolation. But Job
[1:32:17] wanted to know, "Oh, if I only knew
[1:32:19] where his house was. But when a man is
[1:32:21] hungry and thirsting for God, God will
[1:32:24] draw nigh to the man always."
[1:32:27] Then God sent this young man by the name
[1:32:29] of Elahu down, perfect tribe of Christ.
[1:32:32] He didn't accuse Job of being a secret
[1:32:34] sitter. tried to tell them of someone
[1:32:36] who would come and stand in the breach
[1:32:39] in the last days. Put his hands upon a
[1:32:42] sinful man and upon a holy God and
[1:32:45] bridge the way just like Job was talking
[1:32:48] about this days. That's what I need in
[1:32:50] my situation. And that is what Eloh is
[1:32:55] saying, Job, what you have been crying
[1:32:57] out for, God has already provided. The
[1:33:01] Apostle Paul uses very similar language.
[1:33:03] There's one God, one mediator between
[1:33:06] God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who
[1:33:09] gave himself a ransom for all to be
[1:33:11] testified in due time. What what your
[1:33:13] heart is crying out for, that God has
[1:33:16] already provided for you. So this
[1:33:19] messenger, this is the interpreter, the
[1:33:21] deliverance. I have found the ransom.
[1:33:24] He's not just saying, I found a ransom.
[1:33:26] I am the ransom. I will be the ransom
[1:33:29] for him. And if you follow along in uh
[1:33:33] verse 25, what happens after this? His
[1:33:38] flesh will be fresher than a child.
[1:33:40] He'll return to the days of his youth.
[1:33:43] It's like after this ransom comes, this
[1:33:46] deliverance.
[1:33:47] There's a new birth that happens. He's
[1:33:50] restored.
[1:33:52] He shall pray unto God. He will be
[1:33:54] favorable unto him. He shall see his
[1:33:56] face with joy. He will render unto every
[1:33:57] man his righteousness. there's a new
[1:34:00] relationship with God all because this
[1:34:04] ransom has been paid.
[1:34:07] And then verse uh 27, you're going to
[1:34:11] see God looks upon men. If any man say,
[1:34:13] "I've sinned and perverted which was
[1:34:15] right and it profited me not," he'll
[1:34:17] deliver his soul from going to the pit,
[1:34:20] and his life shall see the light. There
[1:34:23] is now forgiveness through grace. Eloh
[1:34:26] is bringing all of this out in the midst
[1:34:29] of Job's trial, in the midst of his
[1:34:31] suffering. God has provided that which
[1:34:34] Job's heart was crying out for.
[1:34:38] And the last part of Eloh's message,
[1:34:42] remember, he's trying to set the stage.
[1:34:44] He's this forerunner. He says, "Stand
[1:34:47] still. Let God be God because God's
[1:34:51] works are marvelous." So, we'll take a
[1:34:53] look at Job 36.
[1:34:57] It says he's going to be speaking about
[1:34:59] uh a storm and the water cycle. And
[1:35:05] Job 36 and verse 26.
[1:35:08] Behold, God is great, and we know him
[1:35:11] not. Neither can the number of his years
[1:35:13] be searched out. He maketh small the
[1:35:16] drops of water. They pour down rain
[1:35:18] according to the vapor thereof. He's
[1:35:19] talking about the water cycle. And God
[1:35:22] has organized all of this. He says, "Can
[1:35:26] any man understand it?" No, but God has
[1:35:29] ordered it all.
[1:35:32] And then he goes in chapter 37, "At this
[1:35:34] also my heart trembles. It's moved out
[1:35:36] of his place. The it started raining at
[1:35:39] the thunderheads, the storm. Hear
[1:35:41] attentively the noise of his voice, the
[1:35:43] sound that goes out of his mouth. God
[1:35:45] thunders marvelously. great things doeth
[1:35:47] he which we cannot comprehend. It's just
[1:35:52] like being able to sit outside and watch
[1:35:54] this this this great summer storm from
[1:35:57] your deck. And it can be it's it's an
[1:35:59] awesome experience and it can be a
[1:36:01] little bit scary, but the power of it.
[1:36:03] It's almost like you're seeing God out
[1:36:06] there doing things. Great things doeth
[1:36:08] thee which we can't comprehend. God
[1:36:12] causes the storm to come.
[1:36:16] whether for correction, for his land,
[1:36:19] for mercy. Why do we Why are the storms
[1:36:22] coming? Maybe a storm's coming to
[1:36:24] correct something in the area. Maybe
[1:36:26] God's just sending rain and lightning to
[1:36:29] get nitrogen fixation going there for
[1:36:32] carrying taking care of his land. Or
[1:36:33] maybe God's just showing mercy. Why are
[1:36:35] storms coming? There's same reasons for
[1:36:38] the physical storms and then the
[1:36:40] spiritual storms in our lives. Maybe
[1:36:41] there is a role of correction. Maybe
[1:36:44] God's just taking care of things in our
[1:36:46] life. Maybe there's mercy. The same
[1:36:48] reasons are there for both. But Job,
[1:36:50] stand still.
[1:36:52] Consider the wondrous works of God. Do
[1:36:55] you know when God disposed them? When
[1:36:57] you know when he causes the light of his
[1:36:59] cloud to shine, the lightning flashes.
[1:37:01] Do you know why? Do you know the
[1:37:03] balancings of the clouds? Do you know
[1:37:05] the works of him which is perfect in
[1:37:07] knowledge? Do you know? And this whole
[1:37:09] time Ele has been speaking about the
[1:37:12] storms and the different seasons the
[1:37:13] storms come in. And as he's speaking, I
[1:37:16] can just imagine the everybody is
[1:37:18] silently listening to him and the wind
[1:37:20] just might pick up a little bit about
[1:37:22] them. There might be a little bit of a
[1:37:24] rumble in the distance because Elu is
[1:37:27] now gotten everybody's attention off of
[1:37:30] Job.
[1:37:31] Everybody's attention is on the power
[1:37:34] and majesty of God. And then Elohu just
[1:37:38] rests his case. He's silent. And then
[1:37:42] the Lord answered Job out of the
[1:37:46] whirlwind. Elohu has set the stage and
[1:37:48] you will never hear from Eloh again. His
[1:37:51] name is not mentioned a single time
[1:37:53] again in the book. He set the stage and
[1:37:55] he's done.
[1:37:57] All attention now is on God.
[1:38:00] And it's really interesting this name
[1:38:03] for God, the Lord. It is different than
[1:38:06] any other the on all the other names of
[1:38:08] God in the book of Job to this point.
[1:38:10] Throughout the entire book, it's always
[1:38:12] the Almighty. The Almighty. The
[1:38:14] Almighty. That's how Job and his friends
[1:38:16] look at God. The Almighty.
[1:38:19] God comes down now as Jehovah.
[1:38:24] The God who reveals himself.
[1:38:27] And what this tells us,
[1:38:32] this tells us that it is a it's not just
[1:38:35] Job, it's not just Job needing an
[1:38:37] explanation from God. Job needs a
[1:38:40] revelation of God himself.
[1:38:43] God never comes down once in the four
[1:38:46] chapters that God speaks here. He never
[1:38:48] gives Job a reason.
[1:38:50] What God does, he asks a bunch of
[1:38:53] questions.
[1:38:55] And the questions kind of fall into
[1:38:57] different categories. Job, where were
[1:38:59] you when this? Do you know how this
[1:39:01] works? Do you know how this works? Do
[1:39:03] you know how this works? Do you know how
[1:39:04] this works? And the answer to all of
[1:39:06] those questions was no, but God does.
[1:39:10] No, but God does. And what these what
[1:39:14] what what God is hammering away at here
[1:39:17] is not is that you don't need a reason.
[1:39:19] You need a person. I am the satisfaction
[1:39:23] for you. You don't need any reasons for
[1:39:26] what I've gone through. You just need a
[1:39:28] revelation of me. That's what God says
[1:39:30] again and again and again through here.
[1:39:42] He starts out by going taking Job
[1:39:44] throughout the cosmos and showing all
[1:39:47] the the great things. And Job, can you
[1:39:50] understand any of these things work? Do
[1:39:52] you? But God says, "I created it." And
[1:39:55] not only did I create it, I run it so
[1:39:58] that it still is working. And he starts,
[1:40:01] God says at the very beginning in the
[1:40:03] New Living and in the living Bible says,
[1:40:05] "Job, why are you using your ignorance
[1:40:08] to deny my providence?" God shows Job
[1:40:11] everything he's done. And Job can answer
[1:40:13] none of his questions.
[1:40:15] Why are we using our ignorance to make
[1:40:18] all these proclamations about how God
[1:40:21] works? We know nothing. And Job is
[1:40:23] brought to the point where he says,
[1:40:24] "God, I repent. I shouldn't have been
[1:40:27] speaking like I was. I repent in dust
[1:40:29] and ashes."
[1:40:35] We have a hard enough time keeping our
[1:40:37] machinery running, let alone the whole
[1:40:39] universe. God has ordered everything,
[1:40:41] keeps it running. And uh to Job's big
[1:40:45] question, how long, God? How long? If
[1:40:47] you look in Job 39, God speaks to this a
[1:40:50] little bit.
[1:40:51] He says, "Do you know the time when the
[1:40:54] wild goats of the rock bring forth Job?
[1:40:57] Can you mark when the hines are supposed
[1:41:00] to calave? Can you number the months
[1:41:03] that they fulfill? Do you know the time
[1:41:05] when they bring forth? Do you know the
[1:41:06] gestational periods for all the
[1:41:08] different animals around the around the
[1:41:10] world? All of them I've created." And
[1:41:12] the answer is, "No, you don't. No, you
[1:41:13] don't." And God is saying, Job, your
[1:41:16] inability to answer the times of things
[1:41:19] do not prevent any of the things from
[1:41:20] happening and running like they should.
[1:41:23] So, Job, your inability to know the
[1:41:25] times about your very own trial, that
[1:41:28] hinders none of the good from coming on
[1:41:31] that'll happen later. How long, it
[1:41:33] doesn't matter. You don't know the
[1:41:34] answer to the time question like the
[1:41:36] answer to all of God's questions he's
[1:41:38] asking. Do you know this? Do you? Do you
[1:41:41] know this? No, I do. God is the answer
[1:41:44] to every one of the questions.
[1:41:49] And Job is brought to a point where I
[1:41:51] know you can do everything. No thought
[1:41:53] could be withholden from thee. I have
[1:41:55] uttered things I understood not. Things
[1:41:58] too wonderful for me which I knew not.
[1:42:01] I have heard of thee by the hearing of
[1:42:03] the ear, but now mine eye seeth thee.
[1:42:07] Job thought he knew a lot about God.
[1:42:12] He had lots of beliefs about God, but it
[1:42:15] really mo a lot of most of our beliefs
[1:42:17] only really become ours perhaps by
[1:42:19] revelation when we purchase it by
[1:42:21] suffering. When we go through a trial
[1:42:24] and all of a sudden ah now I really it's
[1:42:26] quickened to us and Job he heard a lot
[1:42:31] but when his eyes saw God he experienced
[1:42:33] God for himself he knew something like
[1:42:35] he'd never known it before.
[1:42:40] Uh Job 42 and:e7.
[1:42:43] Now Job said, "Now we're going to hear
[1:42:45] God say something that
[1:42:48] is a little bit ironic."
[1:42:50] And it was so that after the Lord had
[1:42:52] spoken these words unto Job, the Lord
[1:42:54] said to Alfaz, the Temonite, "My wrath
[1:42:57] is kindled against thee and against thy
[1:42:58] two friends, for you have not spoken of
[1:43:00] me the thing that is right as my servant
[1:43:04] Job hath." And in
[1:43:08] uh verse verse eight, he's telling his
[1:43:10] friends to take seven bulocks, seven
[1:43:12] rams, go to my servant Job, offer up for
[1:43:15] yourselves a burnt offering, and my
[1:43:17] servant Job shall pray for you. For him
[1:43:19] will I accept, lest I deal with you
[1:43:21] after your folly, and that you have not
[1:43:23] spoken to me the thing which is right,
[1:43:24] like my servant Job.
[1:43:28] And four times in those two verses, God
[1:43:30] calls Job my servant Job.
[1:43:34] And the question here is how did Job
[1:43:38] serve God?
[1:43:41] And if you were to ask the question of
[1:43:43] Job,
[1:43:45] he could look back probably in the years
[1:43:47] before his trial and think, I know how I
[1:43:49] served God then.
[1:43:51] I delivered those who were being
[1:43:53] unjustly accused. I took care of the
[1:43:56] widows. I took care of the orphans. I I
[1:43:58] was eyes to the blind. I was feet to the
[1:44:01] lame, father to the poor, the help to
[1:44:03] the helpless. I broke the jaws of the
[1:44:06] wicked. Before my trial started, I was
[1:44:08] serving you.
[1:44:10] But now God is speaking after the trial,
[1:44:12] after Job's months on the ash sheet,
[1:44:16] being sick, being being unable to do any
[1:44:18] of those things that Job had called
[1:44:20] serving God. God calls him my servant
[1:44:23] Job.
[1:44:25] How did Job serve God?
[1:44:30] What had Job done
[1:44:32] well on the a sheep?
[1:44:35] And I'm sure in Job's own eyes, he
[1:44:38] probably felt useless,
[1:44:42] felt worthless. His life probably lost
[1:44:45] meaning because he couldn't do any of
[1:44:47] the things he'd used to do before. I can
[1:44:50] remember Sister Paul, a year or two ago,
[1:44:52] you sang a special after a period of
[1:44:54] time where you weren't able to sing.
[1:44:57] your voice been it was gone for whatever
[1:44:59] reason. How does a singer serve God
[1:45:01] without a voice?
[1:45:04] How is Job able to serve God when it
[1:45:06] seems like he's in checkmate and can't
[1:45:08] do anything for God?
[1:45:11] To humanize Job had been doing nothing.
[1:45:13] But I'd say in the spiritual realm, Job
[1:45:17] had been a warrior on God's behalf, even
[1:45:20] though he had never left his sick bed.
[1:45:23] Because Job's life was a testimony of
[1:45:27] the goodness of God
[1:45:31] even in the midst of suffering.
[1:45:33] Job served God by giving an answer to
[1:45:38] the devil's question. I will worship him
[1:45:42] though he slay me yet I will trust him
[1:45:45] in all things God is good. Job's life
[1:45:48] was an answer to the devil's question.
[1:45:52] And I think we should be really careful.
[1:45:54] We can never underestimate the power of
[1:45:57] a humble Christian life.
[1:46:01] And all those months of suffering, Job
[1:46:03] never preached a sermon. Job never was
[1:46:05] laying hands, praying for people,
[1:46:06] getting him healed. He never took a
[1:46:08] missionary trip. He didn't do anything
[1:46:10] for the human eye. He didn't He couldn't
[1:46:12] He was housebound. He was depressed. He
[1:46:15] couldn't do a single thing. He felt like
[1:46:19] but a humble Christian life.
[1:46:21] Amen.
[1:46:22] Brother Brandham says, "Well, you just
[1:46:23] This is in the questions answers on on
[1:46:25] the seals. Be a real humble Christian.
[1:46:29] Try to live for God. Live honest with
[1:46:32] your fellow man. Love those who don't
[1:46:35] love you. Don't try to make it a
[1:46:37] mysterious something and mess the real
[1:46:39] program of God up. Don't
[1:46:41] overspiritualize
[1:46:43] what it means to be a Christian. Because
[1:46:46] Job could do nothing except just sit
[1:46:50] there and hear his friends accuse him
[1:46:52] and praise God. That is all Job could.
[1:46:55] He didn't move anywhere.
[1:46:58] And he's called my servant Job.
[1:47:00] He would have thought this is the most
[1:47:02] unproductive time of my life.
[1:47:05] But God says, "No, he's my servant Job.
[1:47:08] He's doing something for me." Even
[1:47:10] though he thinks he's doing nothing, he
[1:47:12] is answering the devil's question.
[1:47:15] And that was the purpose for this in the
[1:47:18] trial, it was to silence Satan.
[1:47:22] And Job gave the answer. We have Satan's
[1:47:25] answer. Though he slay me, I will trust
[1:47:27] him. I don't know where God is, but I
[1:47:30] will keep on holding on being certain of
[1:47:33] God, praising him nonetheless. He gave
[1:47:36] this answer.
[1:47:39] He was the proof of God's victory. He
[1:47:41] was showing the proof that God was a
[1:47:44] good God. Even though Job experienced
[1:47:46] none of the blessings of God, his
[1:47:49] worship was the same. Nonetheless,
[1:47:54] he silenced the devil
[1:47:57] and uh the devil doesn't say a single
[1:47:59] thing in chapter 42.
[1:48:02] The devil always wants to have the last
[1:48:04] word, but he didn't.
[1:48:06] The devil sits there speechless. Job had
[1:48:10] accomplished something.
[1:48:13] And in the very end of the book,
[1:48:16] Job Job uh Job God tells Job's friends,
[1:48:21] go to Job, have him pray for you. I
[1:48:23] think that's important because as soon
[1:48:25] as Job has met the mediator, he has to
[1:48:28] become a mediator for his friends. God
[1:48:30] was in Christ reconciling the world to
[1:48:33] himself and then now we are in
[1:48:35] Christstead as ambassadors for Christ
[1:48:38] reconciling the world to God. That is
[1:48:40] what Job is called to do here at the end
[1:48:42] of the book.
[1:48:44] He's a God of restoration.
[1:48:47] So in verse 11,
[1:48:50] sorry verse verse 12. So the Lord
[1:48:52] blessed the latter end of Job more than
[1:48:54] his beginning. For he had 14,000 sheep
[1:48:58] instead of 7,000 at the beginning. He
[1:49:00] had 6,000 camels, a thousand yoke of ox,
[1:49:03] and a thousand chiaes. Double what he
[1:49:05] had at the beginning. And you know what?
[1:49:08] I could think of Job sitting there
[1:49:10] looking at uh all of his uh his
[1:49:12] blessings. Man, this trial was the best
[1:49:14] thing that ever happened for me because
[1:49:16] look at my balance sheet. It's so much
[1:49:18] greater than it was before. That's not
[1:49:20] what he's thinking. That's what his
[1:49:22] friends were expecting. They were
[1:49:24] saying, "Job, just uh just uh just uh
[1:49:27] repent of something and serve God again
[1:49:30] and he'll all all the good stuff will
[1:49:32] flow." But that wasn't the purpose. Job
[1:49:34] sitting back there. It's it's he's he's
[1:49:36] in it's it's an amazing blessing, but
[1:49:38] his the blessing was not the regaining
[1:49:41] of the wealth or the regaining of the
[1:49:43] health or the rebuilding of his family
[1:49:45] or a circle of friends. It was he had a
[1:49:48] closer walk with God than ever before.
[1:49:50] He had the clear revelation of God than
[1:49:51] he ever had before. God restored all of
[1:49:55] that. And in the meantime, Job is
[1:49:58] responsible for bankrupting Satan's
[1:50:01] bank.
[1:50:03] Because how many sheep did Satan steal?
[1:50:07] Satan stole 7,000 sheep.
[1:50:11] And God doesn't make Satan give back
[1:50:13] 7,000 sheep. Satan has to go find
[1:50:15] another 7,000 sheep and give back 14.
[1:50:19] He stole 500 yolk of oxen. 1,000 oxen.
[1:50:22] Satan has to give back a,000 yolk. He
[1:50:24] has to give back double. God is a God of
[1:50:28] restoration. Everything that was stolen
[1:50:30] from him
[1:50:31] is restored back double.
[1:50:33] That's right.
[1:50:35] And he God is fulfilling his own word
[1:50:38] here in the book of Exodus. If a man
[1:50:40] steal an ox or a sheep, if the theft be
[1:50:42] certainly found in his hand alive, the
[1:50:44] thief is caught red-handed, he has to
[1:50:47] restore double.
[1:50:50] And God fulfills his own word here in
[1:50:53] the life of Job.
[1:50:56] God is a God of restoration.
[1:51:00] And Satan not only silence Job not only
[1:51:03] silences Satan, he also helps to
[1:51:06] bankrupt Satan's bank.
[1:51:09] And I'd like to look at the book of Job
[1:51:10] in just the last few minutes.
[1:51:13] put ourselves here because just like Job
[1:51:17] from the very beginning, God has certain
[1:51:19] thoughts about the bride of Christ.
[1:51:22] Perfect, upright,
[1:51:25] fears God, assues evil, no mark on their
[1:51:27] testimony. That's what that's what the
[1:51:29] testimony is at the very beginning. But
[1:51:32] then throughout life accusations come,
[1:51:36] discussions come and it could be
[1:51:39] misinterpreting God, misinterpreting uh
[1:51:42] the promises of God. And we can go
[1:51:44] through times of chaos and confusion.
[1:51:46] But like Job, we just keep on going,
[1:51:49] keep on going worshiping God. No matter
[1:51:51] how we feel, no matter what the problems
[1:51:54] are, we just continue worshiping God.
[1:51:55] And in the end, God comes on the scene
[1:51:58] and and vindicates
[1:52:01] who was right. But really, the point is
[1:52:03] not that's the bride of Christ. The
[1:52:05] point is God is a God worthy of worship.
[1:52:08] That is the that is the point. But at
[1:52:10] the end, Satan stole so much from Job.
[1:52:14] He can take so much from our own lives.
[1:52:16] But God is a God of restoration to us
[1:52:19] just as he was to Job. and I will
[1:52:23] restore to you.
[1:52:27] God restored everything to Job. God will
[1:52:30] restore to us as well. What has the
[1:52:32] devil stolen from us? Has he stolen
[1:52:35] peace? Has he stolen joy? Has he stolen
[1:52:39] love?
[1:52:41] Has he stolen revelation? Think about
[1:52:44] John the Baptist who had so certainly
[1:52:46] proclaimed, "This is the lamb of God who
[1:52:48] takes away the sins of the world." and
[1:52:50] chapters later says, "Man, are you the
[1:52:52] one or should we look for another?"
[1:52:55] Do we go through those kinds of times?
[1:52:57] We certainly do. Job did. And yet God is
[1:53:00] a God of restoration. And whatever Satan
[1:53:02] steals, double is restored. And not just
[1:53:07] what has been taken, but he says the
[1:53:09] years that the palmer eaten, the all
[1:53:13] these different things have eaten, the
[1:53:14] years that have been stolen, they'll be
[1:53:16] restored back as well. He says, "My
[1:53:18] people will never be ashamed, never be
[1:53:21] disappointed. They will know that I am
[1:53:24] there among them. I will restore to
[1:53:28] you."
[1:53:30] Job went through the ringer and he was
[1:53:34] never told why. The only answer that he
[1:53:37] has to go back to is the best answer is
[1:53:39] God.
[1:53:40] God. Because we don't need an
[1:53:42] explanation. We just need a revelation
[1:53:44] of God. If all those times he's
[1:53:46] wondering why, why, why? But he says,
[1:53:48] "If I could only know where God was, if
[1:53:49] he could be there with me, all what thou
[1:53:51] would help me with." And that's what
[1:53:53] we'll rest with as well. Let's pray.
[1:54:00] Heavenly Father, we thank you for your
[1:54:02] goodness to us, Lord. We thank you for
[1:54:03] your grace.
[1:54:05] Father, Lord, I thank you for this
[1:54:07] testimony of Job, Lord. Lord, the answer
[1:54:11] to the devil's question, Lord. Lord, the
[1:54:15] that simple Christian life that he he
[1:54:18] lived. He wasn't even he didn't even
[1:54:20] feel like he was being a spiritual
[1:54:22] person. He probably felt really upset a
[1:54:25] lot of the times. He felt his feelings
[1:54:27] were all over the place. Yet, there were
[1:54:29] still times every now and then where
[1:54:31] where the sun seemed to shine and it uh
[1:54:33] and it just uh he could speak with
[1:54:36] certainty again. Lord, Father, wherever
[1:54:38] we are in our trials and our journeys
[1:54:40] with you, Lord, I pray, oh God, that you
[1:54:42] would give encouragement, Lord, give
[1:54:45] grace and strength, Lord. And Father, if
[1:54:48] in in our in our trials and sufferings,
[1:54:51] Lord, if there's things that the devil
[1:54:53] has stolen from us, your word says you
[1:54:56] are the restorer.
[1:54:58] Lord, I just pray if you've stolen years
[1:55:01] of joy and years of love, years of
[1:55:05] peace. Oh God, I pray, oh father, that
[1:55:07] you would come on the scene and restore
[1:55:09] these back. Oh God, I pray. Lord, we
[1:55:12] just ask your blessing over each life,
[1:55:14] over each family. Oh Lord, in Jesus
[1:55:17] name.
[1:55:18] Amen. Amen.
[1:55:21] Sing. I'd rather have Jesus.
[1:55:27] Perhaps we can stand as we sing. I'd
[1:55:31] rather
[1:55:32] have Jesus
[1:55:35] than silver or gold.
[1:55:41] I raises
[1:55:49] untold.
[1:55:52] I'd rather
[1:55:54] have Jesus
[1:55:57] than houses
[1:56:00] or land.
[1:56:03] I'd rather rather be led
[1:56:08] by his nails
[1:56:10] [Music]
[1:56:13] than to be
[1:56:16] the king
[1:56:19] of a vast

[1:56:27] his sins
[1:56:30] as well.
[1:56:33] [Applause]
[1:56:36] I'd rather
[1:56:38] have Jesus
[1:56:41] than anything
[1:56:47] this world
[1:56:50] affords
[1:56:52] to today. Second verse. Oh,
[1:56:58] I rather
[1:57:00] have Jesus
[1:57:04] than men's
[1:57:06] applause.
[1:57:09] I'd rather
[1:57:11] be faithful
[1:57:15] to his
[1:57:17] dear cause.
[1:57:20] I'd rather
[1:57:23] have Jesus
[1:57:26] than worldwide
[1:57:29] fame.
[1:57:32] I'd rather
[1:57:34] be true
[1:57:37] to his holy
[1:57:39] [Music]
[1:57:41] oh than to be
[1:57:45] a king
[1:57:48] of a vast
[1:57:54] and beheld
[1:57:56] in sins
[1:58:05] I'd rather
[1:58:07] have Jesus
[1:58:11] than anything
[1:58:15] [Music]
[1:58:16] this world
[1:58:19] afford.
[1:58:22] Last one. Sing that last few.
[1:58:25] Oh,
[1:58:27] he's fairer
[1:58:30] than the leaves
[1:58:33] of rare
[1:58:36] bloom.
[1:58:39] Sweeter
[1:58:41] than honey
[1:58:44] from out
[1:58:47] the cold
[1:58:50] is all that my hunger
[1:58:56] spirit
[1:58:59] needs.
[1:59:01] I'd rather
[1:59:04] have Jesus
[1:59:07] and let
[1:59:09] him leave
[1:59:12] than to be
[1:59:15] the king
[1:59:18] of
[1:59:21] no
[1:59:22] [Music]
[1:59:23] and beheld
[1:59:26] in sin
[1:59:28] [Music]
[1:59:30] swear.
[1:59:33] [Music]
[1:59:35] I'd rather
[1:59:37] have Jesus
[1:59:41] than anything
[1:59:46] this world
[1:59:49] affords
[1:59:50] [Music]
[1:59:52] today.
[1:59:55] Hallelujah.
[1:59:57] Praise the Lord. All my life you have
[2:00:01] been faithful.
[2:00:07] All my life you have been so so good.
[2:00:15] With every breath that I am able.
[2:00:21] Oh, I will sing
[2:00:24] of the goodness
[2:00:26] of God. All my life, oh,
[2:00:32] all my life, you have been faithful.
[2:00:38] Thank you, Lord.
[2:00:40] All my life you have been so, so good.
[2:00:48] With every breath that I am able,
[2:00:54] oh I will sing
[2:00:57] of the goodness
[2:00:59] of God in every trial. Lord, I love you,
[2:01:03] Lord.
[2:01:05] Yes, Lord. Oh, your mercy never fails
[2:01:10] me.
[2:01:13] All my days I've been held in your
[2:01:18] hands.
[2:01:21] From the moment that I wake up
[2:01:25] until I lay my head.
[2:01:29] Oh, I will sing
[2:01:32] of the goodness.
[2:01:35] Sing. I love your voice. Oh, I love your
[2:01:39] voice.
[2:01:42] And you have led me through the fire.
[2:01:48] In darkest nights, you are close like no
[2:01:53] other.
[2:01:56] I've known you as a father.
[2:02:00] I've known you as my friend.
[2:02:04] Oh, and I have lived
[2:02:07] in the goodness
[2:02:10] of God.
[2:02:12] Oh,
[2:02:15] all my life you have been faithful.
[2:02:20] Thank you, Lord. Oh,
[2:02:23] all my life you have been so so good.
[2:02:30] [Music]
[2:02:32] every breath that I am able.
[2:02:37] Oh, I will sing
[2:02:40] of the goodness.
[2:02:43] Hallelujah. Your goodness, Lord.
[2:02:48] Your goodness is running after. It's
[2:02:51] running after me. Your goodness,
[2:02:56] your goodness is running after. It's
[2:03:00] running after me.
[2:03:03] With my life laid down, I'm surrendered
[2:03:06] now. I give you everything.
[2:03:11] Oh, your goodness is running after. Last
