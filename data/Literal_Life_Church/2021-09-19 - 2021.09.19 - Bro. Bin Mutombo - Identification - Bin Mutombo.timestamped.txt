[3:37] yeah thank you so much
[3:40] yeah i just want to talk about
[3:44] uh identification
[3:52] and
[3:55] the bible says here
[4:00] your eyes
[4:03] have seen my unformed
[4:07] substance
[4:11] the eyes of god
[4:16] so
[4:17] your informed
[4:19] substance
[4:22] that means
[4:23] as we are here
[4:26] we are just a substance
[4:31] but god saw that
[4:33] he saw us
[4:36] beyond the curtain of time
[4:40] he saw us
[4:47] and the bible says
[4:50] and in your book
[4:55] we're all written
[4:58] the days that were appointed
[5:02] for me
[5:06] in the book of god
[5:10] the days you have to live here on earth
[5:15] has already written
[5:21] sometimes
[5:23] we are surprised when trials and
[5:26] tribulations
[5:27] death
[5:29] come to us
[5:33] but to god
[5:36] there is no surprise
[5:42] amen
[5:45] our days
[5:47] the bible says
[5:49] in your book were all written
[5:52] the days that were appointed
[5:57] for me
[6:02] maybe god knew you're going to be here
[6:10] 8 million days
[6:11] or 8 000 days i don't know
[6:18] there is no surprise with our god
[6:23] but when he saw us we were just a
[6:26] substance
[6:28] and formed of substance
[6:33] you were nothing
[6:38] and you knew how many days you were
[6:40] going to live on earth
[6:43] but the bible also speaks in the first
[6:46] king chapter 3 verse 14
[6:53] my son always read for me my bible can
[6:56] you read for me
[6:59] first king
[7:03] chapter 3 verse 14.
[7:16] and if thou would walk
[7:18] in my ways
[7:20] to keep my statutes and my commandments
[7:24] as thy father david did walk
[7:26] and i will lengthen thy days
[7:28] amen
[7:31] if you walk in obedience
[7:35] if you walk in the way of god
[7:39] these days
[7:40] god can
[7:47] lengthen them
[7:53] he's the one who wasn't
[7:56] the last word
[8:02] he's the one who can say okay i'll i'm
[8:04] gonna strengthen his day i'm gonna
[8:07] length his day i'm gonna keep him
[8:10] because of his obedience the way
[8:14] they walk with me
[8:21] psalm 102
[8:24] 102 24 says this
[8:27] rather longer can you read
[8:31] 102 verse
[8:39] oh my 24
[8:40] take me not away in the midst of my days
[8:43] thy years
[8:45] are throughout all generations
[8:51] of all
[8:53] lay the heaven
[8:54] of the earth
[8:55] and the heavens
[8:57] are the word
[9:00] thank you
[9:03] sometimes
[9:06] god can take somebody in the middle of
[9:09] his days
[9:14] it's like we as a parent we have a
[9:17] children
[9:20] when the children
[9:22] doesn't follow the
[9:24] rule and regulation
[9:27] the father can say go to bed i don't
[9:29] want to see you playing time out time
[9:31] out
[9:35] and the kid is gonna go
[9:37] sleep while his friends are waiting out
[9:40] there to play with him
[9:50] but he's not going to sleep in the other
[9:52] house he's going to sleep in his
[9:53] father's house
[9:59] amen
[10:06] that's why we don't have to worry
[10:09] about what happened to us
[10:14] amen
[10:19] as we look yours look to yourself and
[10:21] say i'm just a substance
[10:28] he knew you there
[10:32] but when we come down this world
[10:36] something happened to us
[10:41] we lose
[10:43] our identity
[10:47] we don't remember anymore that we used
[10:50] to be with god
[10:52] we were god's
[10:55] subject
[10:57] we totally forget about it
[11:03] and the prophet speak about
[11:08] this
[11:10] in the message
[11:11] i'm spiritual nature
[11:17] paragraph 37
[11:21] the prophet said this
[11:26] now this amnesia
[11:31] we are told
[11:33] it is a cause
[11:38] cause you to be
[11:41] to a place where you cannot
[11:44] identify
[11:46] yourself
[11:50] this is sickness
[11:54] and most of time is a sickness that
[11:59] attacks the believers
[12:08] the ended up having that
[12:11] disease
[12:14] without knowing that they are sick
[12:18] is my accent okay
[12:22] bear with me
[12:30] it is a sickness that comes an attack
[12:33] always a christians
[12:39] and we thank god for william browner
[12:43] because he went deeper to fund
[12:47] the cause of that sickness
[12:51] like doctors
[12:53] he was down he went deeper and found
[12:58] the cause of that sickness
[13:03] and the prophet said this
[13:06] when you have that sickness
[13:09] it takes away
[13:11] your identification
[13:16] then you don't know who you are
[13:21] and when we don't know who you are
[13:23] you are miserable
[13:27] amen
[13:30] brother branham said sister made her
[13:33] never take out money from the bank
[13:36] never done anything because she didn't
[13:38] have an
[13:39] id
[13:48] when you don't have a
[13:49] id
[13:53] you go to the bank
[13:54] you work for the money
[13:57] you deserve it
[13:59] they will never give you
[14:01] the money because you don't have your id
[14:08] hallelujah
[14:13] just there you are in substance
[14:18] amen
[14:19] and that means need to know who you are
[14:24] and for him to know who you are
[14:27] the authority must prove you first
[14:32] hallelujah
[14:37] the government must know who you
[14:42] are give you the identification
[14:47] then you can come you say it's me
[14:50] and this man is gonna look
[14:53] yeah it's you
[14:54] and they give you your money
[14:59] amen
[15:01] but sometimes
[15:04] you may have the id
[15:08] that is expired
[15:15] hallelujah
[15:16] you have the id
[15:18] but your id is expired
[15:24] they are not gonna give you
[15:31] amen amen
[15:36] most of us here we have our id
[15:43] you may say i'm a christian that's our
[15:45] identification
[15:49] that's why we are here
[15:55] is your id valid
[15:57] or it has already expired
[16:09] amen
[16:10] are you sure your ideas
[16:16] valid
[16:22] now the prophet said
[16:24] it is an unusually thing
[16:29] it don't happen too often
[16:33] but the goals
[16:35] is from shock
[16:42] shock
[16:44] cause does disease
[16:50] 2020
[16:54] there was a big shock in this universe
[16:59] things were not expecting
[17:05] people start feeling just like that
[17:07] everywhere in the world
[17:09] it was a shock
[17:14] not only the people of the world we've
[17:16] been
[17:17] have been infected but even us as a
[17:20] christian
[17:24] that's why we want to talk about
[17:26] identification
[17:28] to see where we are standing
[17:40] the prophet said i don't
[17:43] it don't happen too often but the cause
[17:46] is from stroke
[17:50] it is somebody
[17:52] that don't even know
[17:54] who they are
[18:00] you fund it from walls
[18:04] sometimes soldiers get it
[18:09] sometimes people get it
[18:13] another thing
[18:14] causes it
[18:16] it's worry
[18:22] people stay there and start worrying
[18:24] what am i gonna do
[18:26] i'm gonna pay my my mortgage where am i
[18:28] gonna i lost my job and the more you
[18:31] think about you worry about it
[18:37] you just
[18:41] find yourself in amnesia
[18:45] and don't forget that nature bring
[18:49] lead you to lose who you are your
[18:52] identification
[19:00] but the prophet said this
[19:03] worry
[19:04] has no vision
[19:06] to it
[19:09] there is no victory in worry
[19:13] amen
[19:14] you may worry worry worry
[19:17] remember there is no virtue in worry
[19:22] [Applause]
[19:24] you may worry
[19:26] two years one year all night one week
[19:29] there is no rich in that
[19:31] it's destroying you
[19:35] he's pushing you to the spot where you
[19:37] are not gonna know who you are
[19:55] just
[19:56] skip worry the prophet says just
[19:59] skip worry
[20:06] and accept faith
[20:10] amen
[20:12] skip worry accept the faith
[20:21] someone say well
[20:23] now
[20:25] what if you are going to be shot
[20:27] in
[20:30] the ice
[20:31] what
[20:31] uh
[20:33] well what if you're gonna be
[20:35] to be shocked
[20:40] the prophet said no don't think so
[20:50] if they're going to shoot you tomorrow
[20:51] morning
[20:54] don't worry
[20:58] i say what he could do
[21:01] nothing but
[21:03] make
[21:04] me worse
[21:09] we worry too much brothers
[21:14] we don't know tomorrow what tomorrow
[21:17] brings
[21:18] we worry too much
[21:23] and what it makes things worse for us
[21:31] amen
[21:33] forget about the worry
[21:36] get faith
[21:43] what he couldn't do
[21:45] nothing but to make me worse
[21:51] well what good is to going to do
[22:01] what good is it it's going to do to have
[22:05] faith
[22:07] i said
[22:09] it might deliver me
[22:13] hallelujah
[22:14] [Applause]
[22:17] faithful might deliver you
[22:21] but waste
[22:24] worry makes things worse
[22:30] and that's right see
[22:33] so worry
[22:35] about you to it
[22:37] at all
[22:39] but faith has all virtue
[22:43] amen
[22:50] believe
[22:52] now worries sometimes cause it
[22:59] and the prophet said
[23:02] and another thing that caused it among
[23:05] the people
[23:07] is getting between
[23:09] two
[23:10] opinions
[23:17] you don't make a decision
[23:22] your decision
[23:24] is your judgment
[23:30] and when you don't make a decision
[23:36] you are between two opinions
[23:40] the prophet said
[23:41] that will cause amnesia
[23:49] you don't make a decision
[23:52] you you be between two
[23:54] hadiya's two opinions
[23:59] and
[24:01] you get sick
[24:07] i don't know how many people are sick
[24:09] here we're from nature i don't know
[24:12] i don't want you to ask you lift up your
[24:14] hand
[24:19] you've been two opinions
[24:22] you cannot make a decision
[24:28] the double-minded person
[24:31] unstoppable
[24:34] unstable
[24:45] amen
[24:47] two opinions
[24:49] can i go can i not go can i do this can
[24:52] i do this can i give this can i not give
[24:54] this
[24:56] boom
[24:57] amnesia
[25:03] abram speak about a young girl
[25:07] two boys were one they wanted her
[25:11] they wanted to marry her
[25:14] she loves this one she loves this one
[25:17] she doesn't love this one she doesn't
[25:18] love this
[25:20] two opinions in the mirror
[25:27] and she lost all of them
[25:32] amnesia
[25:36] and it gets you to a place where you
[25:39] actually what you have done you have
[25:42] lost
[25:44] your
[25:45] reason
[25:51] you have lost your
[25:54] mind can you imagine that sickness you
[25:57] lost your mind
[26:00] listen
[26:01] when we serve god
[26:03] we serve god we fail our sound
[26:08] mind we don't save god with different
[26:11] things we save god without sound mind
[26:15] and when the devil comes to attack he
[26:17] attack our minds
[26:26] amen
[26:28] and when your mind is attacked
[26:31] you are sick
[26:37] when you stay between two opinions
[26:41] you don't know who you are
[26:46] that's why as a christian
[26:48] we have to make a decision
[26:52] god is not going to make them for us we
[26:54] have to make our decision
[27:02] that's why i say your decision
[27:05] is your judgment
[27:08] through your decision
[27:10] you judge yourself
[27:12] what you want to become
[27:16] and you do that through your
[27:18] sound mind
[27:20] a sound mind is a disciplined mind
[27:28] amen
[27:29] sound mind is a disciplined mind
[27:42] the prophet said
[27:44] you have lost your mind
[27:46] you can't make you don't know
[27:50] who you are
[27:52] you can't identify yourself
[27:56] you can
[27:57] walk around
[27:59] it
[28:00] and everything
[28:01] but you still
[28:05] can't identify
[28:07] yourself
[28:10] you have got your scholarship education
[28:14] and you can same education you had
[28:17] but you don't know where it comes from
[28:20] you don't know
[28:22] who you are
[28:23] where you belong
[28:25] that's amnasia
[28:30] so we are taught
[28:35] when amnesia comes
[28:37] step in
[28:40] you lose your
[28:43] identification
[28:46] you don't know anymore who you are
[28:52] the same message prayer of 83 the
[28:55] prophet said
[28:56] it was with moses when he went down in
[28:59] egypt
[29:01] i was with moses at that the beginning
[29:04] bush the burning bush
[29:07] if you are a christian
[29:10] you are identified with them
[29:13] bible character
[29:19] in the bible
[29:21] character
[29:22] you are
[29:23] identified with them
[29:31] in every situation you are going to go
[29:34] through
[29:35] there is your position there is somebody
[29:37] who went through that
[29:53] yes
[29:57] you cannot look at us oh
[30:00] he went through this
[30:02] everything
[30:07] maybe you don't have a girl babies
[30:11] in the bible there are some ladies who
[30:12] didn't have babies
[30:17] maybe they treat you unjustly
[30:19] but in the bible somebody was also
[30:22] treated that way
[30:26] how did he come out
[30:31] amen
[30:32] there is some things in the bible about
[30:35] you
[30:39] amen
[30:40] the prophet said with them bible
[30:43] character there is a character in the
[30:45] bible
[30:50] amen
[30:52] and we can learn from them
[30:56] and the prophets say
[30:58] don't
[30:59] forget
[31:00] it
[31:06] that just little wait don't forget it
[31:15] i was with moses
[31:17] when all the people turned against him
[31:24] amen
[31:26] sometimes as pastors
[31:29] you see people just
[31:30] come and start fighting you
[31:35] for no reason
[31:38] moses went through that
[31:44] maybe you baby in the family your
[31:46] husband and or your wife such trouble in
[31:49] the house
[31:52] somebody was there in the bible they
[31:54] went through that
[31:56] how did he handle the situation
[31:59] you can learn from them
[32:05] somebody was loaded with death
[32:12] and how did this come out of that
[32:18] you can identify yourself to those
[32:21] people
[32:22] and you will go
[32:24] you get a result
[32:31] i lost my house

[35:52] from that time my credit went up higher
[35:56] why
[35:57] god favor
[36:00] [Applause]
[36:07] when we recognize who we are
[36:10] nothing is impossible
[36:14] nothing is impossible
[36:20] god is great
[36:25] three things
[36:27] shock
[36:29] worry
[36:30] double opinions
[36:35] when we come out of those
[36:38] how god will do great things for us
[36:48] but i'm saying the message the seed
[36:50] shall not be
[36:51] be
[36:52] here with the the shack
[36:56] say
[36:58] 87
[37:00] if you don't know the word of god
[37:04] and the plan of god
[37:07] you can be
[37:09] easily shocked
[37:15] amen
[37:17] if you don't know the word of god and
[37:20] the plan of god you can easily be easily
[37:24] shook
[37:25] but when you see god's plan
[37:28] his program
[37:31] then
[37:32] by says
[37:33] you know it is god and god
[37:37] identifying himself
[37:41] doing just what he did
[37:43] in the other times
[37:46] walking
[37:47] [Music]
[37:48] proven
[37:52] you have to know the word of god
[37:57] you have to know the plan of god
[38:00] and the program of god
[38:05] because when the devil comes he found
[38:07] that you are not loaded with the word he
[38:09] will shoot you
[38:15] automatically you lose
[38:17] your
[38:19] id
[38:21] you don't recognize who you are
[38:24] you start wondering going up here
[38:26] complaining
[38:27] and the prophet says when we are
[38:29] complaining
[38:30] we are blocking the channel of faith
[38:35] your complaints broke your face
[38:44] amen
[38:48] don't do that
[38:52] you are a christian
[38:57] that's why so rob babe were able to look
[39:00] to the problem to the mountain
[39:05] who are you mounting
[39:08] before the rubber bar
[39:12] the mountains our problems
[39:19] amen
[39:21] and we have to know who we are
[39:25] if we don't know the word of god and the
[39:28] plan of god you can be easily shook
[39:32] but when you see god's plan his program
[39:37] then by faith you know it is god and god
[39:41] identifying himself
[39:43] doing just what he did
[39:46] in the other times walking
[39:50] proving
[39:52] that the reason moses could not be shook
[39:57] he talked to face to face with god
[40:02] and god told him
[40:04] i am the one
[40:06] that was with abraham
[40:08] back yonder
[40:10] i'm the one that made
[40:13] this promise
[40:15] i will be with you
[40:18] [Music]
[40:21] the prophet said how are you going to
[40:23] stop that man then
[40:30] amen
[40:31] we are christian we know who we are
[40:37] when god appeared to moses
[40:41] he talked to him
[40:44] he gave him a mission moses said
[40:47] who am i
[40:50] he wanted to know who he was
[40:55] amen
[40:59] he was there
[41:01] between two opinions why you are telling
[41:03] me this what who am i
[41:08] in little home
[41:10] he asked god if i go there they tell me
[41:12] who sent you who are you
[41:19] he want to know what's talking to him
[41:24] amen
[41:26] the power of identification
[41:32] who are you who am i
[41:39] amen
[41:45] most of time when we believe the message
[41:47] we come to church because our father
[41:50] believed the message
[41:52] and the children just out as our
[41:54] father's church
[41:55] they get baptized they are there they
[41:57] sing and
[41:58] but they never know who they are and who
[42:01] is god
[42:08] they don't have that experience
[42:15] there is a power be beyond your
[42:17] identification
[42:22] you have to know who you are
[42:25] don't say i'm a christian no you have to
[42:27] know who you are
[42:30] did you meet him
[42:32] did you meet the pill of fire
[42:38] did you know with god
[42:41] the prophet said how can
[42:44] trouble stop a man like that
[42:47] he knew who he was who was god
[42:52] that's why he took just a little stick
[42:55] 80 years old going back to egypt he said
[42:58] i'm gonna deliver the people of god
[43:01] hallelujah
[43:02] because he knew who was god
[43:04] [Applause]
[43:10] there is a power in
[43:12] beyond your id
[43:18] there is a value beyond your id
[43:25] amen
[43:28] the bible says
[43:32] in psalm
[43:34] 119 verse 130
[43:37] the entrance of your words
[43:41] gives light
[43:45] it gives understanding to the simple
[43:52] the interests
[43:56] of your word
[43:59] gives light
[44:04] when the word of god
[44:08] you
[44:10] in your heart
[44:11] not in your mind in your heart
[44:16] it's bring what gives light
[44:22] you don't walk in darkness you walk in
[44:24] the light
[44:26] it may be night
[44:29] but you you see where you go
[44:31] every step you lead you
[44:34] you know where you step you know
[44:36] who is god
[44:39] give you understanding
[44:47] amen
[44:50] just give to everybody
[44:52] but to the simple
[44:55] that's why the people get understanding
[44:58] people are willing to learn
[45:02] understanding
[45:03] to give them revelation
[45:11] amen
[45:13] the prophet said
[45:15] among all the the gift god give to the
[45:18] church on earth
[45:22] the first gift
[45:25] is wisdom
[45:33] it's wisdom
[45:36] the bible say wisdom is our sister
[45:40] somewhere the bible says wisdom is our
[45:42] mother
[45:44] you know how mothers take care of their
[45:46] children
[45:48] to protect them they don't want them to
[45:50] play with this they're always there
[45:53] for them
[45:55] that's what wisdom does for us
[46:00] and the bible says wisdom as an address
[46:06] and the address of the wisdom
[46:09] is among
[46:11] two stressed streets
[46:14] discernment
[46:17] and the reflection
[46:23] discernment is a gift
[46:26] that god gives to the body to the bride
[46:33] and wisdom will never come along
[46:36] it will always come with understanding
[46:43] he said you may be
[46:45] pastor you may be doctor you may have a
[46:47] knowledge
[46:48] the prophet said what can you do with
[46:51] your knowledge if you don't have wisdom
[46:55] [Music]
[47:02] and wisdom
[47:05] is just a gift from god
[47:09] if you want to get it the bible says
[47:12] ask
[47:16] wisdom doesn't look for age you may be
[47:18] 72 years we may be 12 years old wisdom
[47:22] will come to you
[47:27] that's why jesus christ was a little boy
[47:29] and talk to 80 people
[47:32] people they would say this boy is very
[47:34] wise
[47:41] amen
[47:42] when we have a wisdom
[47:45] you have riches
[47:51] the riches of wisdom
[47:53] are forever
[48:00] and when wisdom come to you
[48:03] he gave you
[48:04] that discernment to know who you are
[48:09] open up your id
[48:11] identification
[48:18] the bible says with wisdom
[48:20] kings reign
[48:25] not with education
[48:27] not with decrees
[48:29] with wisdom
[48:36] amen
[48:38] and when we have that wisdom
[48:41] who know how to guide your life
[48:46] you know who you are
[48:56] and what we say the entrance of your
[48:59] words gives light
[49:04] light
[49:07] and darkness
[49:09] light can be measurable
[49:11] you can measure light
[49:14] but you cannot measure darkness
[49:21] darkness
[49:23] is the absence of light
[49:29] amen
[49:31] most of us as a christian
[49:34] we fear
[49:35] darkness
[49:37] while darkness is nothing
[49:44] amen
[49:46] there is a time of darkness coming
[49:51] and we fear
[49:52] listen
[49:53] the bible says
[49:56] god eyed himself in dark
[50:03] when darkness comes
[50:05] if you look properly
[50:07] you see god in that
[50:13] that's where god hide himself in dark
[50:22] because in darkness
[50:24] that's where there is a development
[50:30] when you have a seed
[50:32] you put it on the ground
[50:35] the seed will start growing there
[50:39] in darkness
[50:41] hallelujah
[50:44] in touch time
[50:46] that's where the glory of god is
[50:56] don't fear darkness
[51:00] god is beyond
[51:05] he may hurt you
[51:06] he may hurt me
[51:08] but god is behind
[51:12] god is dead
[51:16] if you can have a discernment god is
[51:18] there
[51:21] you may not understand it now
[51:24] but later on
[51:26] you say yes lord
[51:28] thank you for that moment
[51:31] [Applause]
[51:34] it is in that moment when we make
[51:37] decisions
[51:38] we don't make a decision on the top of
[51:41] the mountain we make a decision when we
[51:45] are the voice
[51:48] [Applause]
[51:52] amen
[51:54] and light
[51:58] can be measured
[52:01] that's why we can talk about voltage we
[52:04] can talk about
[52:06] what
[52:08] there is nothing compared to that in
[52:10] darkness
[52:21] that's what the interests of the world
[52:24] bring for flight
[52:27] permanent light
[52:32] permanent light
[52:34] in your soul
[52:41] and give also
[52:43] understanding
[52:46] you have a discernment
[52:50] you know where you are standing
[52:54] and you love god
[52:57] you love god
[53:00] whatever you go to
[53:04] you love him
[53:09] the prophet said this
[53:11] in the message talking
[53:14] paragraph 4 147
[53:20] love
[53:27] love
[53:30] he said love him
[53:34] amen
[53:35] love him
[53:38] see what
[53:40] he done for you
[53:46] bro branham begin
[53:48] humming
[53:50] i love him
[53:55] he said it is by love
[53:57] [Music]
[54:00] he said love
[54:01] brings obedience
[54:08] we fight
[54:11] for people to come to church for people
[54:13] to be obedient for people to do this
[54:16] because there is there is something that
[54:18] is missing
[54:22] the love of god
[54:25] [Applause]
[54:32] the prophecy love will bring obedience
[54:35] [Music]
[54:39] when your children rebel
[54:42] there is something that is missing
[54:46] love
[54:48] show them love amen
[54:54] show them love
[54:56] you will have them war
[55:03] show them love
[55:05] because if you don't show them love
[55:09] somebody out there
[55:11] will show them love
[55:13] and they will leave you
[55:20] there is no love
[55:24] without the sacrifice
[55:32] love work with
[55:36] redemption
[55:41] he loves us so much
[55:44] he came down
[55:46] he paid the price
[55:51] love cannot come with after paying the
[55:54] price
[55:57] you have to pay a price
[56:03] they will do certain things that will
[56:05] hurt you
[56:07] she will do certain things that will
[56:09] hurt you
[56:10] he will do certain things that will hurt
[56:12] you
[56:13] but you go beyond that because you want
[56:16] to redeem them
[56:24] and the result
[56:26] will be tremendous
[56:33] you see love bring
[56:37] obedience
[56:40] love will bring good sheep
[56:46] amen
[56:48] love will bring coach
[56:55] you know
[56:56] somebody who loves
[56:59] a girl
[57:02] maybe she that girl she's a nurse in the
[57:04] hospital
[57:06] that men will be sick every day
[57:12] just to go to hospital
[57:15] oh she's the how are you i just want to
[57:18] say
[57:18] he was not sick
[57:21] because of love
[57:27] how can i see i have to go there just to
[57:30] see love bring coach
[57:36] and the prophet say
[57:37] love bring marriage
[57:42] and he said that's where we are headed
[57:46] marriage supper of the lamp
[57:50] i hear my savior calling
[57:53] that he loves me too
[57:55] oh me too
[57:59] just all your heart just feel something
[58:02] really strictly coming into you
[58:06] and that's the holy spirit because he
[58:08] first loved me
[58:10] and purchased my salvation
[58:12] on calvary
[58:18] when we loved
[58:20] the love of god
[58:23] we know we are
[58:29] god will do great things for us
[58:35] but the prophet said
[58:37] but a man got to be convinced first
[58:43] and the only convincing things
[58:46] is the manifestation
[58:48] all the identify
[58:52] of the gospel being identified in you
[58:56] the gospel must come in us
[59:00] to be identified
[59:03] when the gospel is in us
[59:09] when you see that
[59:11] you have passed from death into life and
[59:14] become a new creature in christ jesus
[59:17] does the
[59:18] identify of the holy spirit
[59:22] that's exactly right
[59:26] you have to feel it in your heart that
[59:27] the gospel is in me the word the
[59:30] entrance is in me the word is in me
[59:34] then you can be identified
[59:40] that's exactly right
[59:43] how can the holy spirit write the bible
[59:47] and turn around and deny what he wrote
[59:53] he cannot do it
[59:56] that's the identity
[59:58] of unbelief
[1:00:01] that's the identity of unbelief but the
[1:00:04] identity of belief
[1:00:07] jesus said
[1:00:09] these sons shall identify those who
[1:00:11] believe in me
[1:00:17] we have even signs that have to identify
[1:00:20] the believers
[1:00:22] the sign will show who you are
[1:00:26] everywhere you be
[1:00:27] everywhere you whatever you touch
[1:00:33] because you are a believer
[1:00:40] the prophet said
[1:00:41] if you say i am a christian
[1:00:44] and do not believe in doing
[1:00:47] and i believe all that god say is true
[1:00:51] then live
[1:00:54] any kind of life after that see
[1:00:57] your life speaks louder than what you
[1:01:00] test him your testimony does
[1:01:07] we are being
[1:01:08] identified by the works we do
[1:01:13] the life we leave
[1:01:19] how you treat other people
[1:01:23] how you teach your wife how you teach
[1:01:25] your husband
[1:01:27] how you teach your pastor
[1:01:30] how you teach your neighbors
[1:01:36] we are being identified by that
[1:01:39] the way we look alike
[1:01:45] most of people want to identify with the
[1:01:48] world
[1:01:49] look the generation we are living
[1:01:51] the basketball players they have a hair
[1:01:53] like that like a pyramid going up there
[1:01:56] and receiving a christian in the church
[1:01:58] they have those they don't know what
[1:02:00] they are
[1:02:06] it's so shameful
[1:02:13] it's because of this generation we are
[1:02:15] living in
[1:02:17] we have to be identified
[1:02:19] to the world
[1:02:22] and our ideas being expressed by the the
[1:02:25] behavior the life we live
[1:02:28] how we walk
[1:02:32] today we have a sisters we have a long
[1:02:35] hair
[1:02:38] the long skirt
[1:02:41] plus a long tongue
[1:02:51] long time
[1:02:57] they can say anything they want
[1:03:05] and we have a men who are afraid
[1:03:08] of that
[1:03:10] i just want peace
[1:03:14] i just want visa i don't want the
[1:03:16] trouble
[1:03:20] brother abraham said you are not a man
[1:03:25] thank you brothers for saying amen
[1:03:34] amen
[1:03:36] we have to know we are in that light we
[1:03:38] are living in the evening time time is
[1:03:41] no more
[1:03:46] as a man we have to stand in our house
[1:03:49] we have to show our true
[1:03:51] id
[1:03:53] we are believers
[1:03:57] we are christians
[1:04:04] if you say i'm a christian i do not
[1:04:06] believe in doing
[1:04:08] and i believe all that god says through
[1:04:11] then live
[1:04:12] any kind of life after that see
[1:04:15] your life speaks loudly than
[1:04:18] what your testimony does
[1:04:25] i preached last week in my church
[1:04:27] brother i'm saying the message
[1:04:30] be still
[1:04:32] you say 85 percent
[1:04:37] of people in northern america
[1:04:43] a word
[1:04:48] they are mentally challenged
[1:04:54] included
[1:04:55] i don't know me
[1:04:57] you
[1:05:02] oh america and canada 85
[1:05:06] percent mentally challenge all of us
[1:05:12] you take a profit to see that
[1:05:17] and when we are mentally challenged
[1:05:19] we lose our heidi
[1:05:23] we don't know anymore who we are
[1:05:26] when situation comes
[1:05:29] where is that god
[1:05:32] where is that god
[1:05:47] and you
[1:05:48] know you
[1:05:52] you know
[1:05:53] that's one of the greatest
[1:05:56] hindrance that the church of god has
[1:06:05] the
[1:06:07] bootlegger
[1:06:08] the gambler
[1:06:10] then people
[1:06:14] we won't know
[1:06:16] which
[1:06:17] way
[1:06:18] they are headed
[1:06:21] and they know
[1:06:23] themselves
[1:06:29] but they follow that profess
[1:06:31] to be a christian
[1:06:33] the woman that professed to be a
[1:06:35] christian
[1:06:36] and then leave something different
[1:06:40] it
[1:06:40] it is the
[1:06:43] greatest
[1:06:45] stumbling block
[1:06:47] that the outside world
[1:06:50] has got
[1:06:55] when we say we are christian
[1:06:57] and we don't leave the way of god
[1:07:01] it's a stumbling block for the world
[1:07:05] spirit not to even call ourself we are
[1:07:08] christians
[1:07:14] when the brothers are there
[1:07:17] you speak like a lamp
[1:07:19] when they are not there you split like
[1:07:22] a dog
[1:07:30] what is your id
[1:07:34] is your id available yeah i expired
[1:07:44] that's why sometimes our ideas already
[1:07:46] expired we don't realize we don't know
[1:07:56] because when the devil comes so sneaky
[1:07:58] come the way you can't even realize
[1:08:06] you forget who you are
[1:08:19] that there is in the outside of world
[1:08:22] anywhere
[1:08:24] it is worse than anything the world can
[1:08:29] produce
[1:08:31] is a person that
[1:08:32] supposed to be a christian
[1:08:35] and then leave something else different
[1:08:38] from that
[1:08:40] god help us
[1:08:45] lying
[1:08:47] stealing
[1:08:49] cheering
[1:08:50] and doing things that
[1:08:52] he want not to do
[1:08:54] it is
[1:08:56] just a discredit
[1:08:58] to his testimony
[1:09:02] when you take people that do those
[1:09:04] things here
[1:09:06] and they are there
[1:09:08] our character
[1:09:10] is molded
[1:09:11] in there
[1:09:12] by the life that
[1:09:14] is in us
[1:09:18] the character is modded
[1:09:22] by the character
[1:09:24] by the life we live
[1:09:32] your

[1:09:36] it's a victory
[1:09:41] your character is a victory
[1:09:46] you have to be challenged
[1:09:49] because god wants real people
[1:09:53] not fake people

[1:10:29] oh i love him
[1:10:31] i can comfort him

[1:11:07] god trust me
[1:11:14] brother it is not easy
[1:11:18] when you say you are christian
[1:11:21] you have to go through a test

[1:15:20] close

[1:15:39] we put
[1:15:40] arm together
[1:15:43] and we say we are christian

[1:16:09] the test you receive
[1:16:13] in make a decision
[1:16:17] if you don't have
[1:16:19] your id
[1:16:21] it's going to be hard
[1:16:29] before my son departed
[1:16:31] two weeks because we had a meeting
[1:16:33] family meeting
[1:16:37] after everybody talk
[1:16:39] it was this time

[1:16:45] supposed to go with him to africa we
[1:16:48] went we get a passport

[1:16:57] and the word is the family
[1:17:00] i'm going home
[1:17:05] and we knew we are going to move him to
[1:17:07] africa say i'm going home
[1:17:09] daddy i'm going home
[1:17:12] and when i go home
[1:17:15] i don't come back
[1:17:20] something struck me
[1:17:22] why is he speaking like this
[1:17:25] say a man where why are you speaking
[1:17:27] like that where are you going
[1:17:29] which one
[1:17:31] he was telling us
[1:17:33] i'm leaving you
[1:17:41] brothers
[1:17:43] there is a home
[1:17:48] you need your id
[1:17:51] you need to be prepared
[1:17:57] you need to be ready
[1:18:01] then when the trumpet of god
[1:18:04] sound
[1:18:06] you stand there in the presence of god
[1:18:13] we need our ideas
[1:18:22] our character is molded in there
[1:18:26] by the life that is in ours
[1:18:34] but oh let me give you
[1:18:37] a more beautiful sight
[1:18:45] is to see men and women
[1:18:48] who were made in the image of god
[1:18:53] to be his character
[1:18:55] yet
[1:18:57] housed into things and out in
[1:19:00] by the traps of the wild
[1:19:03] see a beautiful young lady
[1:19:06] coming down the street
[1:19:08] such real
[1:19:11] such a pretty woman
[1:19:13] and a pretty hair
[1:19:15] all cut off
[1:19:16] see a face with
[1:19:18] a pretty shaped face with so much point
[1:19:23] on it
[1:19:28] it's so
[1:19:30] beautiful
[1:19:34] we have to know who we are
[1:19:37] and why god called us for
[1:19:42] daniel paul said
[1:19:46] there was a man called an afghanistan
[1:19:48] the king of babylon
[1:19:53] one day
[1:19:56] he woke up in the morning
[1:19:59] he said babylon
[1:20:01] i have met you
[1:20:09] i have built you
[1:20:10] you saw those big powers big
[1:20:13] buildings and and they say oh i have
[1:20:16] done this.
[1:20:21] pride
[1:20:23] came to his heart
[1:20:26] because of his achievement
[1:20:32] the bible says as soon as he said that
[1:20:38] he lost
[1:20:40] his
[1:20:42] mind
[1:20:45] he lost his
[1:20:47] identification
[1:20:52] sometimes god will
[1:20:55] bless you
[1:20:57] do something for you
[1:21:00] it's because of his measure of grace
[1:21:04] and just i have done this i have done
[1:21:07] this i have done this
[1:21:09] can we see the consequences
[1:21:13] and brother branham say pride is the
[1:21:17] most the bad bad evil
[1:21:21] he say when pride comes in the church
[1:21:24] god leave the church
[1:21:27] when pride come in in the house
[1:21:30] god leave the house
[1:21:38] say pride came in the kingdom of the
[1:21:40] israelite
[1:21:43] god left to the camp for 400 years
[1:21:50] think of it
[1:21:51] 400 years
[1:21:53] he left them
[1:22:01] it's a bad evil
[1:22:04] god gave him chance
[1:22:07] when he lost his identity
[1:22:10] he become he was given a heart of a
[1:22:15] beast
[1:22:17] he started hitting grasses we you know
[1:22:20] his conditions
[1:22:22] for seven years
[1:22:31] said
[1:22:32] a christian
[1:22:34] is a mature person
[1:22:37] is not a baby
[1:22:44] when we become a christian
[1:22:47] we are matured
[1:22:49] i trust you a matured people
[1:22:55] because you love the word
[1:23:00] and the brother branham said as a
[1:23:02] christian when we come to church
[1:23:05] we come to receive a spiritual strength
[1:23:10] that's why we are here
[1:23:12] to receive a spiritual strength
[1:23:19] and he said i have traveled all over the
[1:23:21] world
[1:23:25] i have seen only three bliss who are
[1:23:28] spiritual
[1:23:30] three place
[1:23:32] they say one of them
[1:23:35] just fell
[1:23:37] and another one
[1:23:39] has associated themselves to
[1:23:42] an organization
[1:23:45] apart from that
[1:23:47] is
[1:23:48] random tabernacle
[1:23:52] you see what make us special it's not
[1:23:55] because we come we sing we praise we do
[1:23:58] this
[1:24:00] it's not because we come here we are
[1:24:03] big number
[1:24:06] but we have
[1:24:09] super spirit
[1:24:15] when we have a super spirit
[1:24:19] good mind
[1:24:23] then we can be with god every time
[1:24:35] there was a man
[1:24:40] he was a blind
[1:24:45] the prophet said
[1:24:51] bartimaeus
[1:24:53] when he was growing
[1:24:56] the grammar was telling him
[1:25:00] my son
[1:25:01] my grandson
[1:25:04] there was a god
[1:25:06] he spoke was training that little boy
[1:25:13] and what the grammar was telling him
[1:25:15] have a place in his heart
[1:25:20] and one day
[1:25:25] he gets old he gets married he had a
[1:25:28] daughter
[1:25:35] in the message
[1:25:40] the cruelty of sin
[1:25:43] and the penalty that it caused
[1:25:48] paragraph 162. he said
[1:25:51] there was and hold the blind man in the
[1:25:54] bible
[1:25:55] by the name of bartimaeus
[1:25:59] all the blind bartimaeus
[1:26:03] he had the two little dolls
[1:26:09] we are told by history
[1:26:13] that these little doves used to sit out
[1:26:16] and do little
[1:26:18] tumblers over another
[1:26:21] and the people will hold there he hold
[1:26:26] his cup
[1:26:27] and then when the people will come by
[1:26:30] they did watch these little
[1:26:33] doves
[1:26:36] do little tumblers and they drop in in
[1:26:40] cones
[1:26:41] for the other blind beggar
[1:26:44] has these two
[1:26:47] doves
[1:26:49] he go in the corner of the street and
[1:26:51] they put them he didn't have income that
[1:26:53] was his job
[1:26:57] and when people come they watch they see
[1:26:59] that
[1:27:00] wow
[1:27:01] they're so beautiful they will have some
[1:27:03] cons
[1:27:04] they put in the bucket
[1:27:09] and in the evening
[1:27:12] they will take him by this
[1:27:16] the hand and they'll lead him to his
[1:27:17] house
[1:27:19] and you give to his wife
[1:27:21] annie you can go buy food you can eat
[1:27:28] that's what he was doing that was his
[1:27:29] source of income
[1:27:32] even though he was a blind
[1:27:34] he knew who he was
[1:27:37] his grandma was teaching he was telling
[1:27:39] him what to do
[1:27:47] the prophet said
[1:27:50] he was a married man
[1:27:53] and had a little girl
[1:27:56] he had never seen
[1:27:59] the little girl
[1:28:01] in his life
[1:28:05] he has a girl but he never see
[1:28:08] that girl
[1:28:14] she was about to 12
[1:28:16] 14 years old
[1:28:19] at the stage that we were fixing
[1:28:22] to enter
[1:28:24] to his life now
[1:28:28] and he was
[1:28:30] sitting
[1:28:32] one night
[1:28:35] said his little girl
[1:28:37] got sick
[1:28:41] and he went to the lord
[1:28:45] and he said
[1:28:48] lord

[1:28:57] i will sacrifice my true doubt for you
[1:29:03] i told you where there is a love there
[1:29:05] is a sacrifice
[1:29:09] lord i love my girls so much
[1:29:13] she's now 14 years she's almost entering
[1:29:16] in our life

[1:29:24] i'll give you my two
[1:29:27] dove

[1:29:41] i will sacrifice my two doves for you
[1:29:45] tomorrow
[1:29:50] i want her to be here now tomorrow i do
[1:29:53] this
[1:29:57] so
[1:29:59] the the lord healed
[1:30:02] his little girl
[1:30:06] he sacrificed the two dolls
[1:30:12] that means the job is over
[1:30:15] no more income
[1:30:18] no more business
[1:30:21] but the love he has for his daughter
[1:30:24] was so powerful
[1:30:26] he have to make a sacrifice
[1:30:30] and god evaluated the sacrifice
[1:30:34] everything you do god evaluated it
[1:30:41] and they will pay you back
[1:30:50] by the prophet said after a while
[1:30:57] and the first things you know
[1:31:01] his dear wife got sick
[1:31:07] and she thought she was
[1:31:11] they thought she was going to die
[1:31:15] now his wife now
[1:31:19] also gets sick
[1:31:23] now my wife is gonna die
[1:31:25] lord what can i do
[1:31:29] so he goes out to the lord
[1:31:33] in the night
[1:31:37] filling his way along the side of the
[1:31:39] wall
[1:31:40] of his house
[1:31:46] you down in the field
[1:31:49] and say
[1:31:51] god
[1:31:54] god
[1:31:57] if you will just pay my wife's life
[1:32:02] tomorrow
[1:32:03] i will sacrifice
[1:32:05] my lamp
[1:32:07] for you
[1:32:12] he
[1:32:13] he was a man of sacrifice
[1:32:22] you know we are the people of the open
[1:32:25] book
[1:32:29] the mystery
[1:32:30] that was
[1:32:31] hidden have been revealed to us
[1:32:37] and there is no way we can save god as a
[1:32:41] man in the house in the family
[1:32:44] to not stand for hours
[1:32:50] every man
[1:32:52] must stand for his family
[1:32:57] every pastor must stand for his church
[1:33:07] because we talk about the open book
[1:33:10] and when we look the book that was open
[1:33:12] the first things it was the lamb was
[1:33:15] slayed before the foundation of the
[1:33:18] world the blood was there
[1:33:24] we can rejoice that we have the
[1:33:26] revelation seven seals are being
[1:33:28] revealed and seven trumpets yes
[1:33:31] by the condition for us to become
[1:33:34] partaker of the open book
[1:33:36] we have to be able to do sacrifices
[1:33:42] when is our sacrifice
[1:33:52] there was a sacrifice
[1:33:56] because the lamp was slayed
[1:34:01] and the second
[1:34:02] one was
[1:34:05] humility
[1:34:09] when christ finished
[1:34:11] the work
[1:34:14] he said now
[1:34:15] i want to identify my people
[1:34:18] listen
[1:34:19] i want to identify my people
[1:34:24] i don't want the devil to come and touch
[1:34:26] them
[1:34:30] the
[1:34:30] eyes identification
[1:34:33] jesus gave to us
[1:34:35] was
[1:34:37] the washing
[1:34:39] of our feet
[1:34:45] how can i wash
[1:34:47] past the prophet if i don't love him
[1:34:51] how can he wash my feet
[1:34:54] if he doesn't doubt that loving him
[1:35:02] how can you watch somebody something
[1:35:04] sometimes you say that black man
[1:35:11] how can i touch his feet i don't know
[1:35:13] where he's coming from
[1:35:16] but with that laugh
[1:35:20] he said oh my brother
[1:35:22] because you see behind the veil
[1:35:30] that's why jesus came
[1:35:32] he fell down in john 15.
[1:35:34] he called his disciples
[1:35:39] he took a towel he put on his clothes
[1:35:42] his body
[1:35:44] and he fell down
[1:35:46] he wanted to wash him said doctor you
[1:35:48] don't have to wash him
[1:35:49] he said you don't know
[1:35:53] if i don't wash you
[1:35:55] your feet you are not you can't become a
[1:35:57] part of me
[1:35:59] we have to be identified in christ jesus
[1:36:02] hallelujah we have to be identified in
[1:36:05] him
[1:36:07] we cannot be part of him
[1:36:12] sometimes that sister don't she's just
[1:36:15] talking brother
[1:36:16] and you stay away from her you cannot
[1:36:18] wash your feet
[1:36:21] you lose your id
[1:36:29] that's the condition of the open book
[1:36:31] people
[1:36:37] and the third condition
[1:36:40] is the paying of your tithe
[1:36:44] and offering
[1:36:47] identify you like a son and daughter of
[1:36:49] abraham
[1:36:55] is your id valuable
[1:36:58] or expired
[1:37:04] you know the struggle your past is going
[1:37:06] through
[1:37:18] say here
[1:37:22] and the first things you know
[1:37:25] his dear wife got sick and she
[1:37:28] thought
[1:37:29] they thought she was going to die
[1:37:32] so he goes into
[1:37:34] out to the lord
[1:37:36] in the night filling his way along the
[1:37:39] side of the wall of his house
[1:37:42] kneel down in his field and say god
[1:37:47] god
[1:37:48] he knew there was a god somewhere
[1:37:54] we have to know there is this god
[1:37:56] somewhere
[1:38:03] something is coming to my mind right now
[1:38:06] brother brahma speak about a couple
[1:38:12] dads died
[1:38:17] after a while the mom died they have a
[1:38:20] little boy was
[1:38:22] four to five years old
[1:38:28] and his uncle came to pick him up he
[1:38:30] said because your father and mother died
[1:38:32] i take you
[1:38:35] and they took that care little boy
[1:38:38] and every time they were touching the
[1:38:40] boy
[1:38:42] the body know how to defend himself
[1:38:45] so my mom used to give me breakfast with
[1:38:47] a big bread
[1:38:49] now these people
[1:38:50] they're suffering me and
[1:38:52] because of the age he didn't know what
[1:38:54] to say
[1:38:58] one day
[1:38:59] the boy remembers saying my dad and mom
[1:39:01] they were praying all the time
