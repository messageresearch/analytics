========================================

second Corinthians 4 18 in our Holy Bible while we look not at the things which are seen But at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal so as Christians we we cannot look at just temporal things we cannot live with our eyes on just seeing things see what we see in front of us because the temple how many know that it's faith that makes us see the Unseen we have to live by faith can you say amen and Faith sees what is unseen Faith sees God's will God's plan we cannot be Christians that look at temporal things or the same things because they're temporal they'll end they'll fade away but we must look at things that won't fade away we must live on things that won't fade away amen I find people live in the past a lot they live in a rear view mirror they live their hearts are all locked up because every day they live in a rearview mirror while they're driving that's very dangerous driving you know very dangerous to drive looking trying to drive looking always looking at something that happened in the past to you but to drive forward we must forget the past ask God to forgive us and forgive others and not look in the river but look ahead another reason that people don't look ahead with a positive attitude and a and a strength and by faith look into the Unseen is because they're looking at temporal things temporal things will pass away amen prison so I want to speak this morning on from going from the temporal things to the Eternal things from temporal things to Eternal things and Lord we ask you to bless we thank you Lord we've got a reason father to Rejoice we got a reason to lift our hands we got a reason to praise the Lord this morning because you've given us so many reasons thank you Father and we commit the service to you in Jesus name amen God bless you may be seated transition from temporal things to eternal is what Paul was saying back in our study in First Corinthians 13 and I would just have you go back because I'm trying to finish the whole chapter of First Corinthians 13. this is what he was saying here too in our chapter on Divine love and chapter on the more excellent way and there's there's a scripture I read a couple Sundays ago that said charity verse 8 13 8 charity never faileth First Corinthians 13 8 charity never failed but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether they pre-tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect has come then that which is in part shall be done away so what is this speaking of it's speaking of a transition that Christians make from temporal things even prophecies are temporal things transitioning from Temple things to Eternal things and one of the things that's Eternal is the love of God it'll never fail you so that's why we want to be living more by the love of God than temporal things that we see we we may we are healing for our bodies we may be completely miraculously healed or a miracle take place but in some cases because in these bodies you'll get sick of something again so that that means that our healing is only for this life it's a temporal thing so in other words we believe in healing and we go to God for healing but we don't have our emphasis always on even those things that are temporal we must have it on the love of God we must have run something Eternal something that lasts and so he's teaching this and notice the next scripture in verse 11 when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child now he's getting ready to really bring a correction to the baby Corinthian Church spiritual babies and what did they do when I was a child I speak as a child I understood the child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things he's talking about maturity he's talking about growing from temporal things to Eternal things and he's saying the Corinthians chose to emphasize and stay as children spiritually that when they came to church all they wanted to see is just a prophecy or a tongue or something like that which is not a problem it's that should be that's that's a wonderful thing but if you only came to church just to see those things that won't last that won't keep you we should come to church to say I want to connect with the Eternal God through Jesus Christ the word there has to be a connection with something eternal is that okay with everybody because we could come even to church and get a good feeling the service could be just explosive and we could feel good and what I find in my Christian walk is that feeling that gives me goosebumps from the presence of the Lord only lasts to about Tuesday so then if I want to keep that feeling I would get all these videos and watch them every day instead of anything else because I've been having a Revival just watching these things the anointing Autumn and then we should do that can you say Amen I forgot a huge birthday I just realized it brother Tony ajirabessa's birthday was Friday and because of the ice storm I couldn't take him out for a steak dinner stand up brother Tony happy birthday to you my friend [Applause] brother Michael's dad from Nigeria faithful to the ministry for years Pastor in Nigeria and we love having him around here we prosely them all the time God bless you buddy we love you and then brother John and sister Joy he's saying has been I went to school with Brother John in Tucson and sister joy and so we're not given our ages either but it's sure great to have you this morning and uh in in our cold white North but it's been a great friendship through the years haven't seen each other a lot but it's good to have you praise the Lord so now that I did that I don't know where I'm at here now but we we must we must move we when we come to church we should be praying say God I love the feeling I love the emotion I love to feel your presence do whatever you can do whether it's a prayer line or whether it's in my seat but most of all change me and connect me with the Eternal you do realize that our Father Abraham that's when a change happened in uh in his life is that he connected with the Eternal the whole mystery of Melchizedek that was revealed in the end time nobody understood even the Jews the great rabbis didn't understand who is this Melchizedek king of Salem that had no beginning of days or ending of life and nobody touched on it Harley they speculated and then until at the end time that had to be revealed who is this Melchizedek God breaks that mystery to us which was a mystery of our theophanes is that that isn't just this body and this life Our Father Abraham sat down and somebody in flesh and it was a theophany that came a flesh man and and he he served Abraham his son communion after Abraham in battle he served him communion and they had a a a discussion and then when he goes away from him he never seen him again nobody knows where he come from where I'm telling the Eternal God met with his son Abraham and connected with him and told them you read your Bible now what do you tell them he told Abraham who he was can you say you're the possessor of Heaven and Earth it should have been it should have been Abraham saying to this Christ this theophany can you say Amen sure that you're the perseverance but it's the Christ that's often he's saying to his son you're the possessor of Heaven and Earth what a mystery so then Jesus Christ comes some 2000 years later 3000 and now he says I only do that which I see the father show me do he's connected with the eternal skip ahead two thousand years and God has to connect with the sons of Abraham again and reveals himself again this is more than just a Pentecostal blessing that the message has given us this is deeper than just a feeling this is not just a repeat of the Azusa Street Pentecost in the end time God come down and connected with the son and is still doing it to where a prophet could say this term he said he said it this way and no other historical preacher nobody has ever dealt with the theophanese nobody has dealt with his turning around Eternal realm and now at the end time he says to you Sons God says to his sons it says when you come and you recognize ego food for this age and your body turns Heavenly this body turns heavenly and he's he's saying these terms like your body terms Heavenly under the mystery of Melchizedek you come in contact with the Eternal as well and it's not Jesus Jesus just Jesus Christ theophany you come in contact with your theophany and he says when you recognize this word as Eagle food and your body comes under subjection this sin born body who doesn't want to serve the Lord it doesn't want to line up doesn't want to do what the word says to do but somehow something happens to this body that'll never be born again this body will never be born again you're so well but this body will never be born again but you take a sinborne body and you connect with the Eternal that the soul you connected he says when this body recognizes the evil food he said you've turned Heavenly and you have heard from from your theophany so the reason this morning I have a reason to praise the reason I can lift my hands and be free and Worship the Lord no matter what's going on in my life no matter what criticism I'm receiving no matter what attitudes I can rejoice and praise the Lord because I've connected with something deeper than you and my problems I've connected with Melchizedek can you say Amen I've heard from my theophany why am I lifting my hands because my word body has no problem lifting its hands my word body has no problem with the word my word body is is eternal I have to bring up the scriptures for those critics who might say you're not getting that from the Bible yeah I am Paul said in First Corinthians he said when this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved this body I have one aeonian in the heavens and aeonian means eternal I have another body aeonian in Heavens that was all out of my notes I better get back up here in my notes wow what a powerful mystery he's unfolded to us so Paul says that we are moving we have to live and he's speaking to Christians here in First Corinthians you have to know he's speaking to the Corinthians we must not put our trust or live only on things that will fade and it's surprising to find him say that we didn't we didn't expect we know about things that fade in our life friendships fade governments fade the world's falling apart we see everything fading away nothing lasts I'm going to talk about that in a minute and that's why we can't put our trust in something that don't last we can't teach our children to make their priority in life something that won't last can I get an amen I'll get to your parents in just a minute I want to give you some encouragement that we can't do that to our children but we are surprised to hear some other things that fade because these are things from the kingdom of God prophecies will fade tongues will fade knowledge will fade away so even things that are in the kingdom of God we take them we enjoy them but we can't put all of our dependents on these things because they will fade away someday but there's something that will never fade away that's the elective love of God over your life he loved you before the foundation of the world his love never changes for you blessed be his name love never had at a beginning so love will never have an end I like serving a God and I like serving him every day knowing that I am unconditionally loved from before the foundation of the world and nothing that I do will ever change that it is spiritual immaturity for Christians to live every day consumed with temporal things foreign blessings even blessings from God caught up in temporal even little children when Paul says when I was a child I speak he's typing a young child their child their child they think is that child they act like a child and that's normal for a child but we can't stay children spiritually and he says and that's the thing when he types that even children in the natural choose quick pleasures and what feels good that's in our children they'll choose the the sucker over good food for them they'll choose temporal things they'll choose the the quick pleasure um they'll they'll pull out all the a young baby or child like my granddaughter will pull all the toys out of in the entire room and spread them all over with no thought of the dastardly thing of mom and dad saying go clean it up later they never think about that part they don't think long term they think of the temporal pleasure and they bring it all out and they pull up and they forget they have to clean it up and then you teach them that song clean up clean up clean and you try to get the joy out of cleaning up in them for because they forget and they don't want to work hard and they don't want disciplined teenagers teenagers most mostly don't like the discipline of school they like the fun they like the parties they like to go be with the youth they like to go out to Starbucks and spend all kinds of money there on a drink that should cost 20 cents is eight dollars but it's fun they never think about the budget they want the fun but not work or school and and and they don't see that the teaching and training we give them for school what they learn in school what they learn at church what they learn in the youth meetings what they learn from the pastor and from the parents that's the stuff that's long lasting for life can you say Amen but they don't want those things most of the time they kind of most kids buck up against that and but the fun will be temporal and they haven't learned yet fun will be temporal but there are principles that you get in here that are not just for life but some of them are Eternal principles Eternal principles you know the old saying if you give a man a fish you'll feed him for a day but if you teach them how to fish you'll feed them for a lifetime so but we tend to be people we must not laugh at the children because we tend to be people who look at temporal things and gravitate to temporal things just like the teenagers let's not laugh at the teenagers that's just their age sometimes but we all as adults can stay teenagers spiritually that we live every day on temporal things come on now if you can't say Amen say ouch I want everybody listen I want my teenage boys teenage girls everyone young and old to listen because these are important things we must say God I I love certain things in life but I must connect with you the Eternal God through Jesus Christ the word and nobody else can connect like that nobody else can can bring that to you nobody else can it's you saying Lord I need Christ in my life I need to find the Eternal God I need to eternal life you have to say Lord I need eternal life the Rich Young Ruler has I need eternal life and guess what he had all the blessings coming to him from following the Commandments I did what my mom and dad said I did it I've done all the Commandments Jesus said have you done the commands he said I've done all the Commandments from my youth I don't know and guess what his life was blessed his life was blessed prosperous a lot of money because he followed the principles of God and yet the whole time he's hungry for eternal life so now you have the blessings of following the Commandments and still a yearning for the Eternal on the inside and he came to Jesus he said I've done all these things but he said what do I got to buy how can I get eternal life he's still lacking the person well he's standing in front of the right person your young people you're in front of the right preachers you're in front of the right people they're Christ in flesh presenting eternal life to you every service the rich singers was in front of the right person he was the person of eternal life he could give it right there and he turned it down and you know why nobody can make that decision for you young brother young sister nobody can make that decision for you it's you starting to say I've got a hunger for something more than just doing the Commandments God bless you for doing them thank you for being obedient thank you for not being rebellious God will have certain blessings for you if you how many knows there's a great blessing of even longer days on Earth by honoring and re obeying your parents it's a principle of Life honor obey your parents and you you have long days upon the Earth can you say mine but eternal life and the person of eternal life is something different and the person is presented to you all the time through the preachers I'm standing before you not as just a oversized preacher I present eternal life to you every service but you will not go into eternal life or have it until you accept it for yourself and say I and you'll never accept and say I need this if everybody else fails and my friends in the church go the way of the world I need God I need the eternal life in me can anybody give me an amen this morning every young man every young woman every person no matter how many years you grow up even in the message has to come to that person to say do I have this person of eternal life in my life every person must answer that respond to it so it is spiritual immaturity and so what God does for you temporaril is a wonderful thing but what he puts in you is the Eternal I'm going to say that again what God does for you is temporal what he puts in you is eternal many Christians that puts hopes and things that fade away they tend to fade away themselves many Christians who put their hopes only in things that fade away tend to fade away themselves I got some friends that are not here this morning not in believing the same that they did even out in the world and and you wonder oh God what in the world happened what's going on it's because they put their whole life while they were in the message and going to a message Church they put their whole life swallowed up with temporal things that fade away and they got disappointed too much this life will disappoint you people will disappoint you there's nothing that's trustworthy in this world except the love of God it'll disappoint you all the time this life is full of more disappointments now than I've ever had in my life I can't look to the what I see I have to look at the Unseen that my God will never disappoint me can I get an amen God will never disappoint me it reminds me of a man we stood across from uh brother Barry and I across the in a restaurant across the table and just just laboring in the word and trying to to talk about the word as he was exiting the things that we believe and he went on and on about the troubles and the fanaticism that follow this and everything and I remember the wisdom from Brother Barry that looked him in the eye and said listen all of your troubles all the people that you hurt you all the things that's went on all the fanaticism he said the message is not to blame for your problems the message is not to blame for your problems I thought it was great wisdom be careful who we blame be careful we don't become a victim for life one who's been victimized they have a choice to make whether they can be healed from being victimized or whether they go on with life looking for the next person to victimize them our country is full of victims black people some black people they want reparations they want payback they want money they're considering in California they got they're going to put funds to people from the slavery in our country which is a stain on our country it was bad it was wrong they want payback because now they're the victims they've been victimized you heard our ancestors so no we want to be paid back because they're they're constantly a victim the black people aren't the only ones our country lives with victims that have been victimized but you see now God has a place for us to bring all that to be healed and to to leave it in the past this is the past that's the future our past binds us from the blessings and the positiveness of the future is anybody listening this morning we can't live life in a rear view mirror and looking and trying to drive in a rearview mirror and we look in the back and we have accidents back there and how many has ever went by and you're trying to help me know what a Gawker is we're all done it haven't we and so the traffic's moving very slow because gawkers because an accident happened we want to see who is it what well first of all is it a family or something had happened to our family my wife you know she always calls when she hears the sirens out front or out there she's calling all the kids where are you but we do we drive by an accident oh Lord that happened to him the car is all messed up and they're looking around and it slows the traffic down so we're but sometimes people drive they're not looking where they're going you know there's been incidents where they crash because they're watching another crash does anybody know what I'm preaching this morning and then there's the rear view driving as you're looking oh going going going we laugh but we have many Christians who live their constant Christian Life in the rear view mirror their hearts are locked and stuck and what happened in the past nothing can be viewed right in the future at all because they're they're looking back there at the accidents at the thing oh maybe it's some pretty scenery maybe it's a good thing but most of it is something that happened and you're looking back there trying to constantly drive and we know any decent driver can't do that you can't properly be alert for the future of where you're going when you're looking in the past Paul deals with it in Philippians when he says forget those things which are behind pressed toward the mark of the high calling in Christ and the only way you can press toward the mark of what God has for you in the future is that if you forget all of your past how do I do that brother Paul first of all you ask forgiveness for what you've done wrong and you bring it under the blood of Jesus Christ no matter how dastardly it was some of you have done some pretty dastardly things but you could ask God forgiveness and still not get past it God could forgive it and you haven't forgiven your past and you haven't forgiven yourself God's forgiven it because you sincerely ask but but you haven't forgiven yourself so you're still living back there with it hanging on you and Paul so you you may even forgive yourself but you don't forget and Paul gives us permission forget now I know how our brain works because Satan has access to our brain and he's going to bring up our past to defeat us but you can quickly dump that out wait a minute that's under the bud wait what are you doing I don't have to think about that anymore that's under the blood but most the time we we linger and it comes back and then we get angry and then can you imagine somebody's just dwelling on something that something was done dastardly to you you're dwelling on it and dwelling on it and then then you how many has ever got angry at your kids or angry at somebody in the house and you realize later you got to apologize because you weren't really angry at what they're doing you were just irritated at everything they're doing because you're mad at something from the past or something somebody else did to you people are smiling right now and you're taking it out on the kids you're taking it out in your wife you're taking it out on your husband it's nothing worse than living with somebody who a mate that lives constantly in the bitterness of the past because husbands get a lot taken out on them wives get a lot taken out on them even worse than it's rough it's like sit down this is under the blood forgive God forgives us forgive ourselves accept God's pardon accept his forgiveness and then forget it let's forget it and move on and then we forgive ourselves for what we've done wrong and then we forgive others who have done us wrong you can't have faith unless you forgive Jesus said that a Son of God has faith that if you say to this mountain be removed and cast in the say See it'll be done that's the kind of Faith that's in the potential of the son and daughter of God you can move mountains the next verse says and when you pray that you want to pray a prayer of faith when you stand praying forgive and in perfect Faith the prophet's first comment as he reads the scripture first comment before he goes into this great subject of perfect Faith he said now you can see faith is based on forgiveness how many you want more faith those other scriptures Faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word of God it's good to stay in the word of God that's that builds it as well Faith cometh by testimonies people give them testimonies that raises our faith my God can cancer God can raise the dead and there's some Faith preachers that tell testimonies and we rise in our faith to believe anything's possible God can use those things but if you had all of that and you had an unforgiving Spirit you cannot come into perfect faith without forgiveness you can't grow you can't go beyond it can you say Amen you lack and if you really say I want faith I want faith I'm a teenager I want more faith that I can move mountains that I can do exploits and I can do better things that I could that I could live a closer life to the Lord without forgiveness you can't move into greater Faith forgiveness is the power that comes in our lives to release the past and relief things so that you can be locked in the past not blocked and locked here in the past but it releases you from the past and now you can pursue reconciliation and the future and what's next for you you can't go there without true forgiveness and releasing it and washing it away and there are some situations in my life that the person hasn't even asked for forgiveness but I can forgive them and release it it's released in Jesus name I will not let it bind me anymore I'm not angry at you I'm angry at the Devil because I have some in my congregation they're just locked up and they've been locked up for years it's because they live in the rearview mirror and everything sometimes even I'm saying here gets comes to the filter of their past what a tragedy I love you enough to tell you that until you forgive and let God forgive you and forgive others can't have more faith you might not even feel worthy that you can move mountains I'm not on that level at all what God's word says you are God's word says you are you can't get there you can't build faith if you live in the past you can't get there with an unforgiving spirit people limit this forgiveness thing in the the make it mechanical and they make it complicated and we got to figure it all out and God never asks us to do that there's a flood of his blood and his forgiveness flowing from Calvary and it flows right down to his sons and daughters right into their soul and when it floods through us then it spreads and we release it to everyone in our lives don't explain it don't try to complicate it I forgive and I release it in Jesus name because I want to go on with the Lord somebody say praise the Lord this morning from the temporal from the temporal that see that's the past the past is the temporal but he said we're looking to the Eternal can you say man and sons of God need to move from temporal things to Eternal things many Christians put their hopes and things that fade away but a truly born-again person uh can start fading out because they're putting in trust in temporal things this isn't the Holy Ghost is not a temporal feeling that last until Monday afternoon the Bible says it's a seal until the day of redemption we can make the Holy Ghost so temporal but you see it's a seal and it doesn't last to the next special meeting come on let's grow up friends who if I could just make it from last year it was such a blessing oh I felt the pouring out of the spirit of God but I said well I've got to make it to March to our special meetings that's temporal how about if we worshiped now how about if we didn't live on special meetings how about in our homes sisters when you're washing the dishes and you're listening to that profit or listening to the word and something strikes your heart and nobody is around to say God I just I've got a reason to praise the Lord right now and you have your own kitchen revival can you say Amen how about if we didn't depend on temporal cat meetings but we're worshiping and serving him with fervor and passion and love in our hearts every day of the week hallelujah it's Eternal it's a seal can you say Amen in fact it's a connection with the eternal life the Holy Ghost is eternal life that comes in us it is eternal life but see now let me just elaborate just a little bit this morning even good things of this life will pass do you know that even good things that we have here they'll pass because this that's a different life we know bad things pass and Fade Away we know that but the let me say it this way and this may surprise you I don't know but the very best things that this life can offer is still temporal is that true the very best that this life could offer is still temporal we must receive the person of eternal life we must live looking beyond what we see why first why why do we look beyond what we see and not be caught up in the temporal things of the world well because number one this world is scheduled for Destruction it's on the schedule judgment and destruction are coming and fire is coming and brother Mike Wallace last weekend said that God gave a covenant which is the most powerful thing he can give his people but one of the things when he destroyed this Earth with water one of the reasons two things we look at when we look at a rainbow is that we knew we know not by reading the Bible but we know that he destroyed the Earth by water because he gave this rainbow for the first time so we can look at a rainbow how many's ever seen a rainbow we can look at that and see two things when God said it was going to rain to Noah it did and destroyed the Earth by water it happened even science proves that the whole earth was covered with water but the other thing we see in the rainbow is the grace of God because he said when you see that rainbow I'll never destroy the Earth again with water that's his promise he made it and he's never done it again and he never will do it because God keeps his promises well we got a lot another little prophecy in there says I will destroy the Earth with fire now if he did it with water then if he did it that time he's going to do it again this Earth don't get caught up in this earth and the businesses and everything else and that's your whole thing because it's all going to be gone someday this Earth is fitted for Destruction if you get your mind too caught up in what you're doing in business and not an eternal perspective then you'll be caught in this thing and worried about this all the time and down by this all the time you have to remember this is all going to fade someday it's all going to be gone someday I was sitting in my living room last night and able to study in my living room because my granddaughter wasn't there and my two kids weren't there and the house was empty we got a little feel what it was empty nest gobby and getting are gone because gobby getting have all their friends there Saturday you know usually and so it's anyway it was quiet in the house praise be to God but I was sitting in the living room brother John and I was looking around at this living room some of you been to my house and I'm looking at the woodwork and I'm looking at this and I'm looking at the scenery outside and I'm looking at the beautiful birds come and I'm looking at all that God I wouldn't ever dream that God would give this boy these nice things would have never dreamed I thank God for every time I every time I walk in this church I'm awed by what God has given us I never take it for granted I would have never dreamed we had something this nice I'm a blessed boy this is a blessed church I'm sitting there looking all around it I got the I got the truck that I want I've got the piano that I've always wanted I said God how did I ever get that out but then the next talking but I'm studying here for tomorrow and I'm saying God please I'm laboring there's something more precious than any of this these are these precious lives and Families that somehow you you allowed for me to speak to eternal life and I realize I know deep within here I could leave this service and go home and not know about it and that could all be burnt to the ground you too my truck the house you too you could go back home and get and drive up and it's all to the ground completely leveled it's gone and if that happened to me today and I go five minutes down the road and my wife she calls me you better get home she's crying I'm gonna shed a few tears but I can tell you this there's something deeper in me I ain't gonna cry for very long because I'm about what's Eternal not what's the temporal and I'm not boasting I'm just saying that's within me when I sat there and looked I said God I appreciate this so much but if I know someday this is all going to be gone this all Burns this is going to be finished if I go in the Rapture I'm going to leave it to someone else that comes and where did he go I don't know well we'll put it up on the market we'll sell it and I guess somebody else and they can go on all they want to with that house I don't care about it laboring in the word and crying all night and praying for your family's lives that's what's eternal that's the love of God that's what counts in this life can you say Amen that's I love you I love Cosby I never do this unless there was a love that come through me to you just labor find the Eternal thing for them find the Eternal thing for those people not the temporal things but find the Eternal things give your heart to them give your heart to something while we look at the things that are unseen because the things that are unseen are temporal what God does through me to you today is eternal things if you'll receive it it's an eternal thing praise the Lord it's eternal this is what counts can you say Amen if it all fades away this Earth is fitted for Destruction first Peter 3 10. but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heaven shall pass away with great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent Heat the Earth also on the works that are therein shall be burned up the prophet makes a comment it says the Earth will be swallowed up with fire with him but the works are in which means the atmospheres will will be burnt as well all the evil demonic atmospheres will be burnt by the Holy Fire of God never be around again seeing then I don't know if you have got that guys I wanted the people to see it first Peter chapter 3 and verse 10. it'll melt with fervent heat it's prophesied this this world is scheduled for destruction of fire why are you saying that to us just in case you didn't know your job your house everything you see here even this church will come under that fire and he says this will be burnt up and then he comes to verse 11 and says seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved all things will be dissolved that pretty much covers you know if we know that they'll be dissolved what manner of persons are e to be in all holy conversation and godliness how should we be living Bound by the depression of temporal things of people of our past of our trials is that how we should live no we live with our eyes on the eternal now don't get me wrong you have to use your brain God gave it to you and you pray but you still pray say God lead me in business and lead me to do what I need to do what do I need to do for my career even you young people I'm praying about my career you better bring God in that career and say God what's the career for me that I can serve you the best how can I do Eternal things through my career but these days we teach our kids it's all about that the carnal the you know it's like this life this life we can't just have that perspective seeing then all these things about what matter here's some more here's a couple more let you know the Earth is verse John 2 17 first John 2 17 and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever the world passeth away so you want to look at things that fade away the world's going to pass away young people you want to be caught up in the things of the world on social media and caught up in what they're doing news flash it's going to pass away someday and the lust will pass away someday but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever and then and they here's another one of First Corinthians 7 31. First Corinthians 7 31. just just for the people who are caught up in the Fashions of this world sisters sometimes too caught up in the van and they that use this world not as not abusing it for the fashion of this world passive away you're gonna jump onto that little fashion I'm gonna do that push the envelope I'm gonna wear this and okay I better stop it's not about just what you wear set you're caught up and watching the magazines and watching whether it's it so you're gonna just integrate that because you get if you get if you get caught up in the fashion of the world I want to let you young girls know any sisters it's gonna all pass away someday it's not a good thing to get caught up in the prophet says in 1960 this is a great quote and here's a window into things I said hatred had a beginning so it has to have an end love had no beginning so it has no end hatred is forever love is eternal hatred begins and hatred will end love never did begin it never will end you see it was eternal and When a Man Loves a Woman now here he goes to our marriages Brothers When a Man Loves a Woman and marries her because she's just pretty there'll be an end to that you young boys that's going to choose a wife he's teaching us that even when you choose a wife there has to be an eternal Divine love for that woman because if you're attracted only to the beauty and there's nothing wrong with being attracted to the beauty God made you that way I married the most beautiful woman in the world I'm still married to her of course there's a natural attraction you have to marry the most beautiful woman but I want to let you know if that's the only reason you do it if you only married because she's beautiful if you only married to have sexual relations with her that all fades that all fades but when you have a Divine love for that woman when all that Fades away and all that's done there's still something look how he says I'll let him say it he says and When a Man Loves a Woman and marries her because she's just pretty they'll be an end to that but when a man finds a woman that he loves he don't know why but he loves her and she finds a man that she loves no matter what he looks like see that's turned around the other way no matter what that guy looks it's not about what the guy looks like right it's not supposed to be anyway I mean he's you want a handsome guy I understand that but Love Goes deeper than that because he definitely ain't gonna look like he did before you were married I mean there's certain characteristics that are just going to push out she finds a man she loves no matter what he looks like he loves her she loves him that's an eternal mate in glory he's taken our marriages and tying it to the Eternal why because if it's the right love it's tied the Eternal it doesn't matter all that happens down here if you've got that love you'll tie back to that eternal that's why there's so much divorce that's why is there separation that's why the devil attacks marriages with pornography and all the other things because he works on the temporal I'm going to split this up but when there is a love there then you'll come back to that love it is eternal this is who I'll be with in the Millennium I want to be with them in the Millennium no matter what has happened here death nor nothing else can ever separate them because they are from eternity and they stepped out in the space of time and will return back to Eternity eternity look with this now they stepped they got married death death nor nothing that's what we say in the marriage vow did you remember you said that in your marriage vow you know I'll be stay with him in sickness and in health and this I don't even know all of them you said that in your marriage vow don't forget sickness Health what's the other ones better for worse fat skinny I think it's all in there pledge you my trough nobody knows what that means pledging my trough I don't know what it meant but I pledged it still got it it's probably up in the attic I don't know I don't know what the trough is I pledged it I don't know what it was but I pledged it and they stepped out in this space of time so listen now marriage God's seen you before the foundation of the world with somebody then he says sometimes if you don't get that right one here you'll have the right one over there but if you're serving the lord then you fight you find the right one over here something in eternity happened before you met each other and come together in life so now if that is there if that love is there then you were there in God's mind and then you stepped into time and got married and then a lot of pressures come in life and a lot of things happen and a lot of dastardly things and a lot of rough things because why you're in time and time's going to challenge that love but if it was before you step into time you were up here in eternity and you stepped down into time but if that eternal love is there you when your time is over you step back into eternity again standing beside one another I can't help but think when we got that perspective it brings such a strong bond and love in a husband and wife that nothing no devil can separate them or fighting for this thing we're not letting the devil when that love is overwhelming it brings all these things to say we're so bonded there ain't anybody that'll separate us from the love of God I'm way off my notes today but I'm I believe the Lord wanted me to say these things they stepped out in the space of time we'll return back to Eternity eternity has dropped down in a body called time then goes back up into eternity again it cannot perish and a woman that's beautiful that beauty will fade just as sure you give it a few years maybe today she's twisting around the street some little half-dressed woman sending more souls to Hell than all the borrowings in the country but she'll twist herself down the street thinking she's something and the Bible says they'd have stretched out next and wanted mincing that's the high heels in the Bible if you didn't know they were in there she minces that she she walks a certain way because she's got the highs heels on one there's all this in the Bible that means twisting and they go and in the last day fulfilling the scriptures and doesn't know it they stand in the yard with immoral clothes on men looking at her and don't know she may be as virtuous to her husband or boyfriend as she can be but at the day of Judges she'll answer for committing adultery with hundreds of men you don't get a lot of amens on that anymore but it's still the truth a spirit on them and they don't know the Bible said naked blind and don't know what the miserable part is they don't know it that's why I have Grace for people because if they don't know this truth a woman doesn't know what modesty is then you have Grace and share truth with them my problem is people who know these things and and don't follow I have Grace for them too though but did you know that well-formed little figure that God has given that girl wow that well-formed little figure that God has given that girl because God Made You you're fearfully and wonderful remain he made you give you the vessel you had most of us didn't get the vessel we wanted but God formed it we would have chosen to look different you know I wish I looked a little bit more like Tom Cruise and I won't tell you why but did you know that well-formed little figure that God has given that girl that may be rotten by this time next Sunday if there was an accident and she died and that well-formed body that all the men looked at and she may be using it for the wrong reason bringing the skirt up and put the tight skirt on and Bringing Down the thing to show a little bit of the breast and she did a little bit so but but you see now she's using that and she could have an accident and it's rotting in the grave a week later he's trying to teach us we can't put our trust in these things they're temporal how many hours we spend in front of the mirror and how many hours do we spend in our Bible I'm in trouble anyway so I might as well keep going how much time did you spend prepping yourself in your looks this morning and how much time did you spend praying for the preacher and in the word how late did you stay up and watch a movie last night when you could have been saying Lord I'm going to spend some time in prayer for the service today you say is this convicting to you it's convicting to me because if we live by our carnal Minds we choose the temporal gratification all the time but there are things that have eternal Merit we got to grow up and start choosing the things of Eternity the things that are important did you know the well-formed little figure God's given or maybe rotten by the next Sunday that that tall dark and handsome man maybe no nothing but just a pile of rubbish by next Sunday that all perishes but that all on the inside God love lives for Eternal so it's how I want I want to see how he ends it so watch the inside keep your eyes on the goal amen I say Amen it's teaching us it's this these things the message is not to hurt us it's to teach us to look to Eternal things it's a connection people are speaking so bad against the message and people have put a taintedness in their mind about it but it's what God sent us to teach us to get our eyes on the Eternal things it's to help us not have eternal focus in life especially Christians young men and young women in choosing a wife in money in life in choosing a career in relationships in how we spend so much time on our looks and not our soul the Bible says this life is a Mist it's a vapor if I had a a hairspray can here this morning that's what the scripture speaks about if I sprayed that a Mist would come out and a vapor would come out and you'd see sometimes you see it and then and then within seconds it all fades away that's what the Bible describes as your life our life is a vapor it's a mist why would you put confidence in something that's just a vapor that will pass away but what we will lay up on the other side what will we lay up on the other side if we get caught up in these things you ever think about will he say Well done to me young man young man it's going to be not about your dad and mom anymore someday when you step into the other dimension will he say Well done or will he turn us away these are realities that a preacher has to speak about because the Bible says is that if if you say I'm going to live to 60 70. you don't know young man 14 years old you don't know you're going to live till 70 years old you can get your license and have an accident and that the end of your days because God chooses how many days we have you could be done and then when you step into that and that accident happens and I'm praying none of this happens I'm not trying to pronounce Doom I'm talking about the reality you have no guarantee that you're going to live next year and when you quickly go and you pass away and you give your last breath in that car or I'll watch my dad give his last breath the question you need to ask yourself is that when you step into that will it be well done from Christ or will it be depart from me I never knew you and now you can wiggle with that there's a lot of versions of Heaven I did good works and I did things and I did I was a good boy the Rich Young Ruler was a good boy and he lifted up his eyes in hell you have to ask yourself a question if I were to pass right now right now what would I hear there's only two places you'd go to the dimensions of the Lost quickly Within half a second or less a moment or you step into something that we've heard people go into it and they're smiling in their face in their deathbed in the hospital I know where my dad went because in his life at about 14 years old he was connected with eternal life at 14. serve the Lord the rest of his life I know where he went he stepped into the angels and the saints of God he stepped into it Margaret I know where your husband stepped into I can see by their life I know where he stepped into Amanda I know where your dad stepped into there's not a doubt in my mind but I'm not though they're gone I'm asking our young people and I'm asking every one of you do you know when that moment happens whether it's tonight or 10 years from now where will you step into because my Bible says that's a reality for everybody sitting here no matter how good they are where you spend eternity where will you spend I shouldn't say where you spend eternity because there's no eternal hell but where where will that transition be every person has got to ask themselves that question and when you choose a life about career and relationships and a wife this life is a vapor he said to a people he's going to say to a group of people who cast out Devils who healed the sick apart from me I never knew you young man where do you stand if you were to die this week our Focus must not be all carried away with here we must look to the Unseen I'm feeling really LED in my spirit to bring this to a close right now I have just a small section here about parents parents must have an eternal focus when they're raising their children you must connect them with atmospheres that guide their soul to eternal life when they're little when they're little babies if you let them watch all the cartoons and all the new kids stuff and it has no teaching of Jesus or none of the word of God you don't have a long-term Eternal Focus for your kids and as they get older as teenagers if you're only seeking them to be successful in this world and not teaching him that it's all temporary you do a disservice to them my greatest thrill was not when my boys finished their college in December both of them this last December I was thrilled I took a lot of pictures I hate to admit this but I I kissed their degree that was in their hand I kissed it so happy you know I was really happy not because I didn't think they could finish it but I was happy to be done with all those College bills that's that wasn't my greatest thrill ER it was been my sons and daughters would call me from camp foreign and God without me had connected with them one of my sons called me said Dad nothing's happened Dad you don't understand something that was baptized dad I got baptized something something when I was 16 years old that happened I connected with the Eternal and it wasn't about my parents anymore it wasn't about what they taught me I appreciated it but God contacted me and I accepted it that was my greatest thrill in life for my children can you imagine and taking them to the airport Friday morning and he's going off to to serve in the kingdom of God I never produced that but all I can say is thank you God and parents need an eternal perspective for their children my boys were good at sports so you're not going there I'm going there my go my boys could have went on to a lot of sports I do believe that runs in the genes in our family baseball but they were involved in football they did excellent and I just tell you I don't want to make anybody angry here because I know there's a lot of different views on it they played they played they played when that coach would say our our practices are Wednesday nights we say we're sorry and our boys heard us tell them that and somehow they survived those mean parents that said we won't be there I had numerous coaches because they were so good switch it from Wednesday night to Thursday night I'm teaching my kids priorities I'm teaching them the Eternal things are more important than temporal things please don't get offended at me I'm a pastor this is what I'm supposed to do there's priorities they can enjoy all these things in life can you say Amen and then later they as they got better and things then we make decisions and right at that time in my life I had a a man in this message that was ready to go to the NFL he was chosen headed to the NFL and another guy that was going to play for the Cincinnati Reds he was actually already on the team and these are brothers that believe this word and they have families now they've grown up but they both told me in testimony that once they got into the atmospheres of the NFL and professional baseball once they got there they just realized and one of them was before they even came to the Lord but but they were coming to the Lord and with God what God was doing in them and those atmospheres now if someone does that you know I'm not be critical of them praise the Lord but they said when they were in those atmospheres nobody knows what kind of atmospheres those are and they felt like it'd be very difficult for a Christian to be in that and they said they turned down the contract both brothers turned down the contract and from what I understand both of them are blessed in business today and blessed in what they're doing yeah and so no you know we're not going to do it this way we're not going to direct you this way because there has to be with all the things like there has to be an eternal element in parents to teach them that this life Fades this life will be over money will fade careers will fade all the money we can make will be gone we can't take it with us but there is a there is an atmosphere there is a a place there's a connection and if we expose ourselves and keep exposing ourselves to that Melchizedek can connect with us connect with our children and how important is it it's everything it's everything yeah so there was opportunities that come up there was opportunities for me in music there were some opportunities that came up and I just hit that spot in my life I just I connected with God and I just said this is a great opportunity but which direction I had to pray and say God is this direction you want me to take I was in an atmosphere and musically in a group and it was a good group and it was a good start for me and they asked me to join the group and I just can't answer from anybody else but I just said for me God had done enough there that I said I was around them they were some fine Baptist people but there was cussing going on and there was smoking going on before they would go up and perform and as a young man I just said I'm sorry you know I wouldn't sang with them a few times and I said I don't want to be drawn into that type of hypocritical life I think a Christian if you decide to do I think you should be a Christian there's such a blending of wines today did you see Maverick City the group that a lot of young people are listening to and they actually have some anointed songs good songs we sing some of them here and did you see him on the Grammys they decided to sing on the Grammys they decided to sing back up choir for a rap singer who has the most vile the most vile music that you could put out in rap music of both bio lyrics and Maverick City these guys that are anointed to bring these songs they chose to sing back up for them at the Grammys did you know that one of the singers at the Grammys performed a demonic ritual in the middle of all the tables right in the middle of the concert you can watch it but if you're Christian it won't take you long to turn it off it's it's it's hell right in front of you in Maverick City somehow feels comfortable to be around that they said in the interview thank you you know they're up there and thank you for the awards God's done this God we give God glory all these other things and one of the girls that's the main singer I forget her name she said in an interview she said we thank God we thank God for the crossover success that God has given us I said Lord God touch that young girl because somebody has deceived her that success is being accepted by all of those animals the most vile people are movie stars and music stars idols and to call that God made us successful that we're accepted and get awards from them that's crossover success I can tell you that's not God's success that's not the place God intended for you to use your gift of God trying to Bear my heart these Eternal things there's these are true there are Eternal things that God has given you access to and then there are temporal things temporal praise temporal if you read the book of Joshua chapter 1 he said Moses my servant is dead take up take the people into the land follow the word go forward and you shall have good success not success good success I tell you brother John we're getting a little older I'll speak for myself when I end this life I want to have good success good success God has prospered many things in our lives naturally but it could all be gone tomorrow I want to have good success I want my children to respect me I want to have relationship with my sons and daughters while we're teaching them that we have to live in this world and have goals in this life why not teach that we're not of this world we're only here temporary when this is done we leave it all and all the trophies on the wall that you have from your successes and my kids have some all those trophies will be gone and won't even be acknowledged on the other side I don't think Christ is going to say how many trophies do you have on your wall in your room it's all going to burn won't even be acknowledged on the other side but I want to hear him say well done Rodney Griffith has a new song I don't know if some of you heard it but it's called when I step in the other side I only want to hear two words well done thou good and faithful servant let's pray yes I remember that those calls that I got remember my daughter Gabriella it's about four years ago when she come home from camp just weeping to her daddy's Dad I know that I received the Holy Spirit in the service I just wept with her I said God this is what really matters you know the thing is when they receive something from the Lord that young they're still going to be young they're still going to be immature but I rejoice in the thing that I need to Rejoice over as there's connections being made with their heart that Daddy can't make we can point them to the way we can guide them we can we can instruct we can but but the connection with Melchizedek the Eternal that is the most important thing for their lives I'm going to ask you to pray with me this morning into my heart into my heart [Music] in to stay come into my heart Lord Jesus in to my heart [Music] into mine come into my heart Lord
