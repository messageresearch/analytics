[0:00] to Isaiah chapter 3
[0:04] Isaiah chapter 3
[0:09] . see I'm so good the angels are playing
[0:11] the organs I guess I don't know
[0:16] I'm gonna I want to read this out of the
[0:17] Amplified
[0:19] and I am going to do a kind of a lengthy
[0:21] reading
[0:23] um
[0:24] and then just a little bit actually
[0:26] we'll read chapter four as well but I
[0:28] just want you to follow along in the
[0:30] Amplified
[0:31] you can stay seated because it is a
[0:33] little bit lengthy
[0:35] but we just ask the Lord to bless his
[0:37] word now
[0:38] Isaiah chapter 3 verse 1 for behold the
[0:42] Lord the Lord of hosts is taken away
[0:44] from Jerusalem and from Judah and stay
[0:48] and the stay in the staff every kind of
[0:50] prop and the whole stay of bread and the
[0:53] whole stay of water
[0:54] the Mighty Man and the man of war the
[0:58] judge and the professional prophet
[1:01] the one who foretells by uh says
[1:04] divination and the old man the captive
[1:08] of 50 and the man of rank and the
[1:10] counselor and the expert Craftsman and
[1:13] the skillful enchanter
[1:15] notice all of this is being taken away
[1:17] anything that could do the people any
[1:19] good
[1:22] and I will make boys their princes and
[1:25] with childish shall they rule over them
[1:28] with outrage instead of Justice watch
[1:31] how perfectly this types today
[1:34] and the people shall be oppressed each
[1:36] one by another and each one by his
[1:38] neighbor
[1:39] the child shall behave himself proudly
[1:42] and with
[1:45] insolence against the old man
[1:48] and the Low born Against The Honorable
[1:49] person of rank
[1:52] when a man shall take hold of his
[1:54] brother in the house of his father
[1:55] saying you have a robe and shall be our
[1:58] judge and ruler in this heap of ruins
[2:00] shall be under your control
[2:02] in that day he will answer saying I will
[2:05] not be a Healer and one who binds up I
[2:07] am not a physician for in my house is
[2:10] neither bread nor clothing you shall not
[2:12] make me a judge and ruler of the people
[2:15] for Jerusalem is ruined and Judah is
[2:17] Fallen because their speech and their
[2:19] deeds are against the Lord to provoke
[2:21] the eyes of his glory and defy his
[2:24] glorious presence
[2:25] they're respecting of persons and
[2:28] showing of partiality witnesses against
[2:30] them they Proclaim their sin like Sodom
[2:34] they do not hide it woe to them for they
[2:37] have brought evil as a reward upon
[2:40] themselves it's just we're living an
[2:42] almost complete Sodom I don't believe
[2:44] we're there yet I believe there's one
[2:46] more stage after the transgender takes
[2:48] hold I don't even want to speak it but I
[2:50] don't think we're done yet
[2:53] say to the righteousness say to the
[2:56] righteous that it shall be well with
[2:57] them for they shall eat the fruit of
[2:59] their deeds woe to the wicked it shall
[3:02] be ill with them for what their hands
[3:04] have done shall be done to them as for
[3:07] my people children are their oppressors
[3:09] and women rule over them O My People
[3:12] your leaders cause you to err and they
[3:14] confuse destroy and swallow up the
[3:17] course of your paths the preachers out
[3:20] you know in the in the denominations and
[3:23] things they just confuse the Lord stands
[3:26] up to contend and stands to judge the
[3:28] peoples and his and his people the Lord
[3:31] enters into judgment with the Elders of
[3:34] his people and their princes for by your
[3:36] ex exactions and oppressions uh and
[3:40] oppressions you have robbed the people
[3:43] and ruined the country boy is it in ruin
[3:46] you have devoured The Vineyard the spoil
[3:48] of the poor is in your house what do you
[3:51] what do you mean by crushing my people
[3:54] and grinding the faces of the poor says
[3:56] the Lord God of hosts
[3:58] moreover the Lord said now watch this
[4:01] because the daughters of Zion are
[4:04] haughty and walk without stretched necks
[4:06] and with undisciplined flirtatious and
[4:09] alluring eyes
[4:11] tripping along with mincing in an
[4:14] affected gate also says in another
[4:16] translation was swaying of the hips
[4:19] and making a tinkling noise with anklets
[4:21] on their feet therefore the Lord will
[4:24] Smite with a scab the crown of the heads
[4:26] of the daughters of Zion making them
[4:28] bald and the Lord will cause them to be
[4:31] taken as captives and to suffer the
[4:33] indignity of being stripped naked there
[4:37] I've never seen so many things in in the
[4:39] news in that of of it seems to be mainly
[4:42] women just stripping naked and and
[4:45] making some comment about it that this I
[4:48] am totally free to do this I feel
[4:49] totally Comfort but they're completely
[4:51] stripped naked and then he also says
[4:54] which I thought was interesting and I
[4:55] was just can't remember it was the other
[4:58] day and I don't know any day you go out
[5:00] you see it but it's just the the women
[5:02] don't even cut their hair anymore they
[5:05] shave it like a man it's just completely
[5:07] shaving down and this here is saying
[5:09] that the Lord's gonna Smite their head
[5:11] that they'll they'll be bald and and
[5:14] that's it's it's happening today in that
[5:16] day the Lord will take away the finery
[5:18] of their twink tinkling anklets the Caps
[5:22] of network and the Crescent head
[5:23] ornaments the pendants and the bracelets
[5:26] are chains and the Spangled face veils
[5:28] and scarfs the headbands the short ankle
[5:31] chains attached from one foot to the
[5:34] other to ensure a measured gate the
[5:36] sashes the perfume boxes the Rings and
[5:40] nose jewelry
[5:41] the changeable suits of apparel and the
[5:44] in the mantles and the wimples and the
[5:47] crisping pins the glasses in the fine
[5:50] linen and the hoods and the veils there
[5:53] was one spot
[5:55] I don't I don't think it's here it was
[5:56] another translation and and when it said
[5:59] fine linen it said fine linen
[6:01] undergarments even it was just it's just
[6:04] completely described today and it shall
[6:06] come to pass that instead of sweet smell
[6:08] there shall be stink and instead of a
[6:10] girdle or rent and instead of well-set
[6:13] hair baldness and instead of a stomach
[6:15] or an uh girding of sackcloth and
[6:18] burning instead of beauty thy men shall
[6:21] fall By The Sword and thy Mighty and the
[6:23] war you can't hardly find a real man
[6:25] today
[6:26] and in her gate shall lament and mourn
[6:29] and she being desolate shall sit upon
[6:31] the ground now notice this is saying
[6:33] that even even this has such an impact
[6:36] and such an influence that it comes into
[6:38] the daughters of Zion
[6:41] chapter 4 and verse 1 and in that day
[6:43] seven women shall take hold of one man
[6:45] saying we will eat our own bread and
[6:48] wear our own Apparel in in another again
[6:51] in another translation it says
[6:53] um let's see here I wanted to read that
[6:55] in the Amplified
[6:57] uh it will provide our own apparel
[6:59] they're gonna they're gonna wear what
[7:00] they want to wear they're gonna they're
[7:02] gonna provide what they want to wear
[7:04] only let us be called by your name to be
[7:06] taken away our reproach of being
[7:09] unmarried but in that day the branch of
[7:12] the Lord shall be beautiful and glorious
[7:15] so you have this picture of just
[7:17] complete and utter Darkness the lights
[7:19] have gone completely out it is it is
[7:22] pitch as as as as black as pitch can get
[7:25] it's just complete darkness but in that
[7:28] day the branch of the Lord shall be
[7:30] beautiful and glorious and the fruit of
[7:33] the land shall be excellent and lovely
[7:35] to those of Israel who have escaped and
[7:38] he who is left in Zion and remains in
[7:41] Jerusalem will be called holy everyone
[7:43] who is recorded for life in Jerusalem
[7:46] and for eternal life after the Lord has
[7:49] washed away the moral filth of the
[7:51] daughters of Zion their pride and their
[7:54] vanity and the haughtiness and has
[7:55] purged the bloodstains of your Jerusalem
[7:58] from the midst of it by the spirit and
[8:00] blast of judgment and by the spirit and
[8:02] blast of burning and sifting and the
[8:05] Lord will create over the whole site
[8:07] over every Dwelling Place of Mount Zion
[8:10] and over her assemblies a cloud and
[8:12] smoke by day and The Shining of a flame
[8:15] of fire by Night notice that's how God
[8:17] appeared to the children of Israel Cloud
[8:19] by day a pillar of Fire by night for
[8:22] over all the glory shall be a canopy a
[8:24] defense of divine love and protection
[8:27] and there shall be a pavilion for shape
[8:30] for shade in the daytime and from the
[8:33] Heat and for and for a place of refuge
[8:36] and a shelter from storm and from rain
[8:39] I want to catch one more scripture
[8:41] Psalms 139
[8:45] Psalms 139 and verse 14.
[8:50] just getting my scriptures out of the
[8:52] way up front
[8:55] I will praise thee for I am fearfully
[8:58] and wonderfully made marvelous are thy
[9:00] works and that my soul knoweth right
[9:03] well my substance was not hid from thee
[9:06] when I was made in secret and curiously
[9:08] wrought in the lowest parts of the earth
[9:10] Thine Eyes did see my substance yet
[9:14] being unperfect and in the book all my
[9:17] members were written which in
[9:19] continuance were fashioned when as yet
[9:22] there was none of them
[9:24] God in in this in this laodicean age in
[9:28] this age of complete and utter darkness
[9:30] when when the picture looks Grim of the
[9:32] daughters of Zion there's yet a
[9:34] beautiful branch of the Lord that's
[9:36] risen to the Lord she's beautiful in the
[9:38] sight of the Lord and not only that but
[9:41] she should know that she's fearfully and
[9:43] wonderfully made we all need to know
[9:45] that male and female we're fearfully and
[9:48] wonderfully made but what I want to
[9:50] focus on tonight is is true beauty women
[9:53] of God I want to I want to just call it
[9:56] true beauty women of God
[10:00] I hate being stuck to my notes but it
[10:02] was just how the lord gave everything to
[10:04] me and so I'm just going to follow this
[10:06] along and and uh you just you pull the
[10:09] night I know you're tired but pull on
[10:10] the gift amen
[10:12] brother random said their supposed silly
[10:14] women LED away with diverse lust
[10:16] Hollywood all this kind of stuff bob
[10:19] hair wearing shorts wearing makeups all
[10:22] this kind of stuff which is Unbecoming
[10:24] but then he says this he makes a comment
[10:26] do you know the woman plays a great part
[10:28] in the last days now he just mentions
[10:31] and is what I would say is an ill-famed
[10:34] woman it's it's the silly women it's
[10:36] it's they're LED away in diverse lust
[10:38] but he and then he says and the woman
[10:39] plays a great part in the last days but
[10:42] I also believe that if the if the woman
[10:44] of ill Fame if if the if the daughters
[10:46] of Zion who have turned away from the
[10:48] word of God play an important role in
[10:50] the last days then so does the real
[10:52] beautiful branch of the Lord the women
[10:54] of God plays an important role in in the
[10:57] last days are you with me tonight
[10:59] all right I'm gonna do my best to preach
[11:01] even if you're quiet you know the Bible
[11:03] said that those who who Escape out of
[11:06] the great damnation will be a beautiful
[11:08] Branch before the Lord someday I'll get
[11:10] to it the Lord willing for it for you
[11:12] women's let you see what God thinks of
[11:15] the women that really escape this
[11:17] damnation of this day said she would be
[11:20] beautiful that's God's God's
[11:22] proclamation of you today is that you're
[11:25] beautiful you escaping the the influence
[11:28] of this world God says you're beautiful
[11:31] a prophet comes and declares that you're
[11:34] beautiful amen
[11:36] we've heard many times that God before
[11:39] he was God he was in the spans of
[11:41] Eternity and and and he couldn't even be
[11:44] called God yet because it was just an
[11:46] eternal Jehovah it was Elohim he was
[11:49] self-existent there was nothing yet
[11:51] created but yet in him was all these
[11:54] attributes that he wanted to let to let
[11:56] out he he was craving to for these
[11:59] attributes to be let go to be manifested
[12:02] to be expressed out of himself and it
[12:05] was all bottled up inside of this
[12:07] internal being it was it was he he he
[12:09] filled all time space lie everything it
[12:13] was just Eternal there was there was no
[12:15] uh uh uh substance as it were that we
[12:19] could we could touch God and yet he had
[12:21] everything that God is wrapped up in
[12:24] there it's like the seed of an of an
[12:25] apple tree and all of that was just
[12:27] bound up in this seed called called
[12:29] Elohim and it was just he was just dying
[12:32] to express it to to to let it to let it
[12:35] grow and produce other apples
[12:39] so he created angels to worship him and
[12:41] just bear with me we're just going to
[12:42] walk through time a little bit he
[12:44] created angels and thus became God and
[12:47] he became an object of worship and that
[12:49] was an expression of his attribute that
[12:51] was that was something that God could be
[12:53] expressed his attribute could be drawn
[12:56] out of him but it it still wasn't
[12:59] everything that God was it still wasn't
[13:01] all that God had it wasn't his fullness
[13:03] so God God it's it's it's it's it's uh
[13:08] well it's it's just all those potentials
[13:11] were laying in him
[13:13] and then
[13:14] so he created the heavens and the Earth
[13:18] God did he created the heavens and the
[13:20] Earth and out of that became this bore
[13:23] this this attribute that was inside of
[13:26] God that he's a creator that attribute
[13:29] was in God and when he created the
[13:31] heavens and the Earth he became Creator
[13:32] but he didn't just want to stop there he
[13:35] could have he could have stopped with
[13:36] the with what he put in the ocean he
[13:38] could have stopped with what he put in
[13:40] the land but it wasn't good enough it
[13:42] wasn't good enough to make light and
[13:44] darkness there there there was still an
[13:46] attribute inside of God that he wanted
[13:48] to come out and so he created man he
[13:51] created Adam and placed him in the
[13:53] garden to till the soil because because
[13:55] God there there was there was
[13:57] expressions of of God there he was a
[14:00] father and he needed a son to express
[14:02] that attribute of father he needed he
[14:05] wanted a fellowship he's he's a
[14:07] fellowshipper but he needed he needed to
[14:10] express that attribute in order to
[14:12] become uh the the gray Great Fellowship
[14:16] or the one that we can commune with
[14:18] and and so he he's he's expressing these
[14:22] things and everything he's creating and
[14:24] all that he's doing he's expressing
[14:26] attributes and then
[14:29] let me catch myself here
[14:32] and and he wanted that Fellowship but I
[14:35] want you to notice something this is and
[14:36] this is really important that I think is
[14:38] just so beautiful is that he created
[14:41] Adam and and he's and he's going through
[14:43] and it's good and it's good and it's
[14:45] good and he creates Adam and he says
[14:47] it's good and and then he puts him in
[14:49] the garden to till the soil and then and
[14:51] then he says then he says but Adam needs
[14:54] a help me
[14:56] Adam is in the image of God and and if
[14:58] that's the case of Adams and the image
[15:00] of God then Adam has attributes within
[15:03] himself that he's needing to express and
[15:06] he can't do it and just how he is he's
[15:09] he's tilling the soil he's moving things
[15:11] he's naming the animals he's he's
[15:13] speaking things you know this tree over
[15:15] there I like that better and this and
[15:17] that and so so Adam becomes a little
[15:19] Creator but yet there's still attributes
[15:21] inside of Adam that need to be expressed
[15:23] to show the image of God because Adam
[15:26] was created in the image of God are you
[15:28] with me
[15:30] Adam was created in the image of God so
[15:32] all these attributes were bound up
[15:34] within Adam too but but it it the
[15:38] important thing that I want you to catch
[15:40] is it took an actual person
[15:42] close to God's heart in order to for
[15:47] those attributes to be expressed
[15:49] it took a person close to God's heart it
[15:52] took Adam being created and placed in
[15:55] the garden to have fellowship with God
[15:57] in order for these the greatest
[15:59] attributes of God to be expressed that
[16:01] took another person it took a person to
[16:04] be expressed
[16:06] Adam was working for the Lord and yet
[16:08] God looked at him and said there's
[16:09] something still missing
[16:11] there's something Adam he doesn't have a
[16:13] help me I don't know if you can be sad
[16:15] in the garden I don't know maybe he just
[16:17] said I know that feeling when I was by
[16:20] myself I didn't have one of my kind but
[16:22] I've created Adam so that's that's
[16:24] that's fulfilling for me but Adam needs
[16:27] somebody like him so so God puts Adam to
[16:30] sleep
[16:31] he puts Adam to sleep and he draws from
[16:34] the very heart of Adam to create Eve
[16:37] he draws from from the rib and and and I
[16:41] just thought it was beautiful when when
[16:43] in Solomon and uh Lily's wedding just
[16:46] that whole thought of of God taking the
[16:48] rib I always thought you know right side
[16:51] lower rib you know and and the man's
[16:53] missing a rib now and and I always
[16:54] thought that but it makes to me it makes
[16:56] more sense for God to take it from Over
[16:58] the heart of Adam to take that rib
[17:00] because it would need to be somebody who
[17:03] who he could put his arm around and who
[17:05] he could love and who he could cherish
[17:07] and who he could protect and and that
[17:09] and that and so God took it from Adam
[17:11] she was bone of his bone and flesh of
[17:13] his flesh but it took it took another
[17:15] human being it took particularly it took
[17:19] the woman to draw out the attributes out
[17:22] of Adam
[17:23] are you with me
[17:28] God is a loving husband
[17:31] so he had to create this picture on
[17:34] Earth of Adam and Eve of a husband and a
[17:37] wife he had to he had to he had to
[17:39] manifest that he had to draw that
[17:41] attribute and it took the woman Eve to
[17:44] draw that to to to to to manifest that
[17:47] that God is a husband God is a loving
[17:50] husband it's and and to show that there
[17:53] was a unity of love between husband and
[17:55] wife in a in a fullness of Fellowship
[17:57] between their hearts there was complete
[18:00] and total intimacy there was no walls no
[18:03] fences nothing hidden it was complete
[18:05] honesty complete openness complete
[18:08] Fellowship complete love
[18:11] and then and then it was also a
[18:13] fellowship between between that love and
[18:16] and between their God
[18:19] and and it was and it makes and you've
[18:22] seen it before the the the triangle of
[18:25] husband wife and God and it takes that
[18:28] to make the full picture and then when
[18:30] that was made God didn't just say that
[18:32] it was good he said it's very good
[18:36] it's very good this was the complete and
[18:39] perfect image of God was found in Adam
[18:42] and Eve
[18:44] but yet there was more attributes that
[18:47] were locked up inside of God and inside
[18:49] of Adam that needed to be expressed
[18:51] and and and I want you to just notice
[18:54] God's Great purpose was prefigured in
[18:57] Adam and Eve
[18:59] the great purpose the whole thing the
[19:01] whole picture of redemption was was was
[19:04] lying there and Adam and Eve Eve fell
[19:07] Adam stepped out as a redeemer
[19:10] God stepped out as a redeemer it was
[19:13] attributes it was attributes inside of
[19:16] Adam to be a redeemer
[19:18] to be a redeemer to his wife the the the
[19:21] scripture said Paul writes to love your
[19:23] wives as Christ of the church and laid
[19:25] himself down for it so so brother you
[19:28] have an attribute in your heart lying
[19:31] there inside of you that your wife draws
[19:33] out of you that you actually you you
[19:35] sanctify her the scripture says you
[19:38] sacrifice you you give of yourself you
[19:41] you you manifest God by by giving to
[19:45] your wife by protecting her by loving
[19:48] her
[19:49] even as you love yourself
[19:57] God wanted to express his fullness still
[20:00] he created Adam and Eve he created the
[20:02] Earth but there was a still a fullness
[20:04] of God that he wanted to express
[20:07] he's Jehovah Jireh he's a provider this
[20:10] is all even before he stepped out and
[20:13] did these things all of this was lying
[20:15] within God he's he's Jehovah Jireh a
[20:18] provider he's Jehovah Shalom our peace
[20:21] Jehovah Rapha our healer Jehovah Nissi
[20:24] our Victor Jehovah Sid canoe our
[20:26] righteousness Jehovah shama the Lord is
[20:28] present Jehovah rohai Our Shepherd
[20:32] and then I just want to point out one
[20:34] that I I I've just thought is remarkable
[20:37] to me
[20:38] remember I'm talking about true beauty
[20:40] in women of God
[20:45] Abraham needed strength in his old age
[20:49] God comes to him as El shadiyai
[20:52] El Shaddai as is the bosom one
[20:56] it's the breasted one brother Branham
[20:58] said that's just like a woman she he God
[21:01] this attribute inside of God is is is
[21:04] the breasted one and we might you know
[21:06] kind of I don't know about that that's
[21:08] kind of weird but when you understand
[21:12] a woman when she has a child she draws
[21:16] the baby to her breast and when the baby
[21:18] nurses it draws the nourishment from the
[21:21] mother it's actually getting strength
[21:23] from the mother and so when God comes to
[21:26] to
[21:27] um Abraham Abraham needed something to
[21:31] draw strength from
[21:33] and God becomes has this attribute
[21:36] inside of him that he's going to express
[21:38] to Abraham and it's God the strength
[21:41] Giver God the sustainer god the life
[21:44] Giver
[21:45] and he's still God the life Giver today
[21:47] when you need strength when you're weak
[21:49] go to al-shaday I go to the breast of go
[21:52] to God draw from his strength draw
[21:55] nourishment draw life from him
[21:58] draw fulfillment draw satisfaction in
[22:01] him that's what a baby when a baby it
[22:03] can be crying but when the mother takes
[22:05] it to herself that baby just and and you
[22:08] know it's it's just always funny you
[22:12] know with when the kids would be nursing
[22:14] you know and they're just making those
[22:16] noises of satisfaction as they're
[22:18] drawing in that life from the mother and
[22:20] it's just funny it's just they're
[22:22] they're just completely satisfied they
[22:25] they don't have a care in the world they
[22:27] don't fear they don't have a worry they
[22:29] just know that they're with Mom and
[22:31] they're drawing strength from that
[22:34] I think it's amazing this is this is
[22:36] Sister you're fearfully and wonderfully
[22:38] made God made you that way and not only
[22:41] did he make you that way but you
[22:43] actually reflect this attribute of God
[22:45] of our shadiyah you reflect that you
[22:48] have a great purpose in the economy of
[22:50] God and and you're fearfully and
[22:53] wonderfully made because when the baby
[22:55] the the baby's born anymore from what I
[22:59] understand they do it all the time as
[23:01] long as they can as the baby's health is
[23:02] good they'll put the baby right on the
[23:05] mother's chest so it goes right skin to
[23:07] skin what that's doing is it's releasing
[23:09] chemicals and the baby and in the mother
[23:11] and those chemicals they call them
[23:13] bonding chemicals they're bonding
[23:16] chemicals that just right from the
[23:18] get-go that baby and that mother is
[23:20] creating a bond when the woman is
[23:22] breastfeeding the baby there's chemicals
[23:25] being released in her brain and in that
[23:27] baby's brain it's a bonding chemical
[23:29] that's why you know not that a dad would
[23:32] be hesitant to run into a fire but but a
[23:35] woman will run into a burning building
[23:36] after her baby that's because of that
[23:39] bonding chemical she's bonded so much
[23:41] that that is now it's bone of her bone
[23:44] and flesh of her flesh she feels that
[23:47] thing she she loves that baby she loves
[23:49] that life and she'll do anything she'll
[23:52] lay down her own life for that child
[23:55] God wants to be bonded with us in that
[23:57] same way that's reflecting God's desire
[24:00] God's heart to be bonded with us so we
[24:03] draw our strength from him we draw our
[24:06] life from him and layer to see him when
[24:08] when there's so many things that we can
[24:10] turn to and we can we can go to God
[24:13] wants us to turn to him to be the
[24:15] life-giving resource is that okay with
[24:17] you
[24:21] God divided the masculine and The
[24:24] Feminine spirit that he put in Adam when
[24:26] he created Adam there was there was a
[24:29] masculine and a feminine in part to that
[24:31] and and I just thought you know Satan is
[24:34] just so cruel and such a such just
[24:36] perverts things a truth of God lies in
[24:39] there
[24:40] masculine and feminine in the beginning
[24:42] but then God didn't keep it that way he
[24:45] separated that out of Adam he he left
[24:47] Adam with the masculine part and put the
[24:50] feminine part with Eve and and and and
[24:52] took from the very makeup of Adam to put
[24:56] in the feminine part of Eve
[24:58] there was no identity confusion there
[25:01] there was no and I'm just going to call
[25:03] it straight there was no transgender
[25:05] mental illness in the creation of God
[25:08] that's all right you can be quiet the
[25:10] transgender used to be a mental illness
[25:12] and now it's it's rampant and they're in
[25:15] their Paving way because they call evil
[25:17] good and good evil we are we are in
[25:20] almost complete Sodom and that's just
[25:23] another part of it
[25:24] but there was no there was no confusion
[25:27] there was no mixing there was no
[25:28] matching it was just feminine in the
[25:31] woman and masculine in the man that's
[25:34] how God created it it was a distinct
[25:36] separation and it took the bride part
[25:39] out to a life allow for that separation
[25:42] Eve had to come forth for God to take
[25:45] that that feminine part put it in Eve it
[25:48] took her in order to make that
[25:50] distinction and that separation
[25:52] Christ needed to express his word
[25:55] through us he desires a bride to express
[25:57] himself through to have preeminence in
[26:00] our lives and he does it through his
[26:02] word because his his word is him he is
[26:05] his word when we talk about a seed it's
[26:07] the seed of God it's the word of God
[26:09] it's the gene of God and and he puts
[26:12] that in in in in those who he's
[26:14] predestined to eternal life
[26:17] she makes it possible for him to express
[26:19] himself in this way the bride of Christ
[26:22] makes it possible for him to express
[26:24] himself in this way
[26:26] Christ in the in Christ The Mystery of
[26:28] God revealed the prophet says Christ in
[26:30] you makes you the complete revelation of
[26:33] the whole thing I'm talking about the
[26:35] bride part of God it's the Bride of
[26:38] Jesus Christ she becomes the revelation
[26:40] of the entire thing you we we think that
[26:44] Jesus is the is is the revelation of it
[26:46] all and he is don't get me wrong now but
[26:49] but but he he Christ in you the hope of
[26:53] glory makes you the revelation of the
[26:55] entire thing
[26:58] so even in Jesus Christ although he was
[27:01] the fullness of the godhead he wasn't
[27:03] fully expressed in the body of Jesus
[27:06] Christ there was more that he wanted to
[27:08] express there was more that God wanted
[27:11] to give outside of the body of Jesus
[27:14] Christ
[27:15] come on say Amen
[27:17] I'm not bringing a strange Doctrine so
[27:20] God came form in the form of Flesh now
[27:23] watch the picture now going back there
[27:26] was there was a first man Adam then
[27:27] there's a second Adam and if there's a
[27:29] second Adam there was a first Eve and
[27:32] there's a second Eve so Jesus Christ is
[27:34] called the second Adam
[27:36] and he comes forth in a body God comes
[27:39] forth in a body of Jesus Christ and and
[27:42] he comes forth so that a part of him can
[27:45] be taken and then his bride can then be
[27:48] bone of his bone flesh of his flesh God
[27:51] tore into the body of Jesus Christ blood
[27:54] came out and then God that happened so
[27:57] that that the spirit of God could be
[28:00] divided into his bride so that so that
[28:02] the masculine and feminine in the second
[28:05] Adam could be separated in that in that
[28:08] in that feminine spirit of God of Jesus
[28:11] Christ could be placed in the bride
[28:15] she would be the Bride of Jesus Christ
[28:19] and because we're born of his bone and
[28:21] flesh of his flesh and and spirit of his
[28:23] Spirit we become him and he is the word
[28:27] so you in the word become the same
[28:30] person
[28:31] you in the word become the same person
[28:33] when you receive that word into yourself
[28:35] you become the same person as the word
[28:39] of God
[28:40] all of this prefigured by husband and
[28:43] wife masculine feminine Adam Eve to show
[28:47] Christ and his bride
[28:50] man he purposed a woman to do it
[28:54] he purposed the church the feminine part
[28:57] to do it in
[28:58] sister this is the reflection that you
[29:01] reflect of God
[29:03] is is the the very plan and purpose of
[29:06] God there's a mystery that's hidden
[29:09] inside of you o Daughter of Zion
[29:16] that's the importance of a woman that's
[29:18] what she represents that's the beauty of
[29:21] a Godly woman
[29:22] that's why it's important what you dress
[29:25] like
[29:27] that's why it's important what you wear
[29:29] how you wear your hair
[29:31] not because of some bondage but because
[29:33] of what you represent in God's purpose
[29:36] and God's plan it's not about the length
[29:39] of your hair it's about representing a
[29:42] consecrated Life by not cutting it I
[29:44] remember years ago I heard someone ah
[29:46] you say you know Nazarite vow and the
[29:49] woman's under that that's that's just
[29:51] that's hogwash you can't find that
[29:54] the Nazarite vow was was a vow of
[29:56] consecration unto the Lord and that's
[29:59] what the woman is representing as
[30:01] consecration into God that's why you
[30:03] don't you don't trim your hair that's
[30:05] why you don't cut your hair because it's
[30:07] a crown of concentration it shows your
[30:10] commitment to one man because in the
[30:12] scripture only a harlot would cut her
[30:14] hair
[30:18] it's a representation of life of an
[30:21] inward work
[30:23] it's it's not about how much you can
[30:25] take off before you cut too much
[30:28] it's not about how much we can get by
[30:31] with without sinning you understand now
[30:33] it's not about trimming the ends it's
[30:35] not about how much sin you can get by
[30:37] with before you just get too much
[30:39] where's where's that line at where's
[30:42] that line see you're representing
[30:43] something there's something that's lying
[30:46] within your vessel that is that is
[30:48] beautiful in the sight of God if you'll
[30:51] just follow his word
[30:52] it's not about uh how much it's a fully
[30:56] consecrated life to Jesus Christ Isaiah
[30:59] referred to it the the attitude of the
[31:01] women would become so much that they
[31:03] would cut their hair until the style
[31:06] even becomes shorter than a man's
[31:10] a woman in the representation of God's
[31:13] purpose is why a bad woman also
[31:15] represents this great drama that's
[31:17] played out through the ages
[31:19] I I don't want to focus on the bad woman
[31:22] I want to focus on the good I want you
[31:23] to see yourself as the woman of God that
[31:25] you are I want you to see yourself what
[31:27] real true beauty is but but you have to
[31:30] almost take a step back though and see
[31:32] because Eve did reject God's word and it
[31:35] was playing out into the purpose of God
[31:38] but Eve got away from her mate by going
[31:41] away from the word
[31:43] she rejected the authority of God's word
[31:46] and that's what brought death she
[31:48] received seed and knew her womb that
[31:50] wasn't her husband's seed you see a
[31:53] woman has been created sister you're
[31:55] fearfully and wonderfully made because
[31:57] you can receive a seed into your body
[31:59] from a man and and and a baby can grow
[32:02] in you and be birthed by you you become
[32:05] a life Giver
[32:06] you become a life-giver and and it's
[32:09] just so amazing fearfully and
[32:12] wonderfully made God Made You to receive
[32:15] that your immune system should attack
[32:18] that seed
[32:19] your immune system the way that God's
[32:21] made the body is is and that's why when
[32:24] they put and do an organ transplant they
[32:27] have to they have to give you medication
[32:29] and things and and hope that your body
[32:31] doesn't reject that organ because
[32:33] they're putting a life inside of you and
[32:36] your body was created that your immune
[32:38] system was created to go and attack that
[32:40] life and and let your body expel it
[32:43] get it out of your body because it's
[32:45] drawing from your life but her her
[32:47] immune system would attack it but she's
[32:51] been created in such a way that her body
[32:54] shuts off that part of her immune system
[32:56] so that it doesn't harm the life that's
[32:59] growing inside of her
[33:00] old things pass away
[33:03] All Things become new
[33:06] the old man is dead in the Life of
[33:09] Christ lives what was once rejected is
[33:12] now embraced
[33:13] in the life of a Christian so you see
[33:16] sis this is what your your you're
[33:18] expressing
[33:19] in your natural body you're expressing
[33:22] an image a greater purpose of God do you
[33:25] see it a little bit clearer tonight
[33:28] her DNA literally changes parts of her
[33:32] DNA literally changes so that her immune
[33:36] system won't attack that
[33:38] your DNA the the very thing brother
[33:41] Stephen strew talked about the DNA your
[33:43] DNA actually parts of your DNA changes
[33:46] says you're fearfully and wonderfully
[33:49] made
[33:52] a man's body can't do that
[33:55] a man's body can't do that I don't care
[33:58] what they're trying to do today
[33:59] implanting in men and everything that
[34:02] that's that's they're under an illusion
[34:04] they've gotten away they've accepted a
[34:07] perverted way
[34:08] a man's body can't do that you see he
[34:11] needs the woman to express that
[34:16] and when that life is inside she becomes
[34:19] a prisoner to that life there there's
[34:22] there's no way for her to stop it it
[34:24] grows Until It Breaks forth and
[34:26] expresses itself she craves certain
[34:29] things her diet changes all of it is is
[34:32] that life inside of her craving
[34:35] something new because she she may never
[34:37] been able my wife loves coffee and when
[34:40] she was pregnant she couldn't drink
[34:41] coffee
[34:42] that little life inside of her they
[34:45] didn't get enough spankings I guess when
[34:47] they
[34:48] you need to spank them more for making
[34:50] you not be able to drink coffee
[34:52] that life and then she'll crave things
[34:55] that she never craved before weird
[34:57] things I know I know uh one sister and
[35:00] she'll know who she is she she she would
[35:03] eat I think it was a tomato and drink a
[35:05] cup of coffee because something in it
[35:07] was what the baby was craving it was it
[35:10] was her diet changed it was it was it
[35:13] was a life inside of her that's growing
[35:14] and when you become a Christian when you
[35:16] become filled with the spirit of God
[35:18] that word of God that's inside of you
[35:20] can only feed on the word of God your
[35:23] diet changes from worldly things and
[35:25] goes to Heavenly things
[35:27] [Applause]
[35:29] your diet changes she's she's so the
[35:33] woman she's needed she is important to
[35:36] express the plan and purpose of God God
[35:39] is a husband the prophet said of the
[35:42] church and the church is his bride the
[35:44] prophet said so you'll understand I no
[35:47] longer call you church I'll call you
[35:49] bride
[35:50] he was trying to get this point across
[35:52] it's not just a church it's not just a
[35:55] just we're not just here it's you're the
[35:57] Bride of Jesus Christ
[35:59] you're an expression like the woman
[36:02] reveals the seed of a man the the the
[36:04] church is Christ himself revealed that
[36:07] little seed when it's when when that
[36:09] baby is born it's an expression of the
[36:12] man it's an expression of the love
[36:14] between the man and the woman
[36:17] but yeah eve took the wrong seed
[36:21] and and we know that she had to do that
[36:24] in order to for the attributes that were
[36:26] bound up inside of God to be expressed
[36:31] remember brother Boaz referenced that
[36:33] Samson
[36:34] was choosing against God and yet it
[36:37] played into the plan of God
[36:41] so
[36:42] we we we can fall Eve
[36:46] and and and I'd like we'd like to
[36:49] probably all sit down and have a good
[36:51] talk with her someday
[36:53] but yet God needed her
[36:56] to be to be uh uh I can't remember it's
[36:59] not necessarily a byproduct he he he he
[37:02] needed her for the fullness of of God's
[37:06] plan God's purpose to be expressed to be
[37:09] expressed
[37:10] she had to be created so she could fall
[37:13] that's why a woman shouldn't handle the
[37:15] word of God
[37:16] that's not saying anything against you
[37:18] sis that's just saying that God created
[37:21] you for a special purpose and when you
[37:24] try to handle the word of God you can
[37:26] misinterpret the word of God and be
[37:27] deceived just like Eve was
[37:33] Eve came under an illusion and took her
[37:36] own thinking over God's word
[37:38] we don't want some illusion of some sort
[37:40] but a real genuine Christ expressing
[37:43] himself right through us not some
[37:45] illusion of Christianity but a real
[37:48] genuine New Birth where Christ can
[37:50] reproduce himself through your life it's
[37:53] a life you don't live yourself but he
[37:55] comes in you and lives by himself just
[37:58] like that little baby does
[38:00] you just become so in love with him you
[38:03] just surrender all a woman she becomes
[38:05] so in love with the life inside of her
[38:07] she just surrenders to it surrenders to
[38:10] the cravings
[38:11] surrenders bears bears the backache
[38:14] Bears the pain of Labor that bonding
[38:18] chemical is so strong in a woman's body
[38:20] that even though she travails in
[38:23] childbirth the the the the chemicals in
[38:26] that woman's brain will actually almost
[38:29] make her forget
[38:31] what she went through the pain she
[38:33] experienced because and and and it and
[38:36] it makes her remember the love she felt
[38:38] so she'll go and do it again
[38:40] that's how God created you you are
[38:42] fearfully and wonderfully made
[38:49] God said
[38:50] multiply and replenish the Earth to Adam
[38:52] and Eve there was a purpose in that
[38:54] there was a purpose in it being man and
[38:56] woman it's not some illusion and I just
[38:59] say if if there's anyone under the
[39:01] illusion today getting under an illusion
[39:04] wondering whether you like whether
[39:06] you're a man and you think you like men
[39:08] or you're a woman and you think you like
[39:10] women
[39:11] or you think you want to be a woman and
[39:13] you're a man or or or or a man and
[39:16] you're a woman you're under an illusion
[39:19] you can come to God and ask God and God
[39:23] will show you the purpose for your life
[39:25] God will show you the truth of it if
[39:27] you're under an illusion of of what a
[39:30] Christian should look like or where
[39:32] you're at in your Christian walk go to
[39:35] God seek God and God will show you God
[39:38] will tell you
[39:40] our Pastor said a statement not too long
[39:42] ago he said knowing God's purpose and
[39:45] and and your purpose will settle you if
[39:49] you have that confusion go to God ask
[39:51] him to show you his purpose for for his
[39:54] purpose and his purpose for your life
[39:56] and when God shows you you won't be
[39:58] confused no more
[40:06] let me let me skip some of this
[40:08] Eve was the mystery inside of Adam
[40:10] you're the mystery inside of Jesus
[40:13] Christ
[40:16] so just simply put
[40:19] what an important role the woman plays
[40:22] in the plan and purpose of God
[40:24] you should feel valued sister
[40:26] you should you shouldn't feel that that
[40:29] hair and dress and things and is is a
[40:32] condemnation to you or or a binding and
[40:35] imprisonment to you
[40:36] ask God his purpose in that ask God his
[40:40] plan behind that ask God his purpose for
[40:42] you and you'll see how important you are
[40:44] to the plan of God
[40:49] now when a woman goes and she acts like
[40:51] I'm just going to take a little turn
[40:53] here
[40:54] when a woman goes and she acts like the
[40:57] daughters of Zion that are that that
[40:58] that that act like the daughters of man
[41:02] it becomes a grievous picture
[41:05] she's supposed to be a daughter of God
[41:07] but yet she's acting like a daughter of
[41:09] man she's she's sing but there's a
[41:12] reason that she's acting that way
[41:14] there's a reason she's doing it it could
[41:16] be a spirit
[41:17] there's a spirit on this age of that
[41:20] there's a spirit attacking any genuine
[41:22] man any genuine woman there's a spirit
[41:25] on this age that's attacking it she
[41:27] could be coming under the illusion of
[41:28] that spirit
[41:30] she surely has to reject God's word in
[41:33] order to go do that
[41:35] but it may be because she's comparing
[41:38] herself
[41:40] she's comparing herself she sees the
[41:43] women of the of man the women of this
[41:45] world are stripping their clothes off
[41:47] she sees that she compares herself she
[41:50] she she a woman is built to want to be
[41:54] pretty
[41:55] and and to men we're thankful for that
[41:58] right
[42:00] that's all right you can say Amen in
[42:02] your hearts
[42:06] but there's a desire in a woman to be
[42:09] beautiful
[42:10] and she may feel like she has to compete
[42:13] with what she's seen
[42:15] she may feel like she has to compete for
[42:17] the time and intention of her husband
[42:20] and so she'll act out in ways that that
[42:23] that she normally wouldn't and that A
[42:25] Daughter of Zion wouldn't
[42:28] but by acting that out she'll attract
[42:30] the wrong man
[42:32] she'll attract the wrong attention
[42:37] she'll do things a woman who has her
[42:39] confidence and the Lord wouldn't do if
[42:42] you could pull up that video if you have
[42:44] it
[42:47] when a woman has her confidence in the
[42:49] Lord she wouldn't do those things and
[42:51] Isaiah painted a pretty clear picture of
[42:54] what that looks like
[42:56] now I want to I want to show you just a
[42:58] little video because
[43:00] um I I just when I read this this is
[43:01] actually where this this thought or when
[43:03] I I read this in a book and and I looked
[43:05] it up and when I watched it I it just
[43:08] struck my heart so heavy that that
[43:11] to preach this
[43:14] just struck my heart when I walked when
[43:16] I looked at this video yesterday
[43:19] it was posted in April 14 2013 when I
[43:22] looked at it yesterday it has over 70
[43:24] million views
[43:26] and I'm gonna I'm gonna let it play and
[43:27] then I'm gonna comment a little bit on
[43:29] it because there's just a couple of
[43:30] things that I want to say so if you have
[43:32] that you can go ahead and hit play on it
[43:35] I'm a forensic artist worked for the San
[43:39] Jose police department from 1995 to 25.
[43:42] I showed up to a place I'd never been
[43:44] and there was a guy with a drafting
[43:46] board we couldn't see them they couldn't
[43:48] see us tell me about your hair I didn't
[43:52] know what he was doing but then I could
[43:54] tell after several questions that he was
[43:56] drawing me
[43:59] tell me about your chin I get kind of a
[44:02] little bit intrudes a little bit
[44:03] especially when I smile your jaw your
[44:07] jaw my mom told me I had a big jaw what
[44:11] would be your most prominent future kind
[44:13] of have a fat rounder face the older
[44:15] I've gotten the more freckles I've
[44:17] gotten I think I have a pretty big I
[44:19] would say I have a pretty big forehead
[44:20] [Music]
[44:23] once I get a sketch once I get a sketch
[44:25] I say thank you very much and then they
[44:28] leave I don't see them all I had been
[44:31] told before all I had been told before
[44:33] the sketch was to get friendly with this
[44:35] other woman Chloe today I'm going to ask
[44:38] you some questions about a person you
[44:41] met earlier and I'm going to ask you
[44:43] some general questions about their face
[44:45] she was thin so you could see her
[44:47] cheekbones and her chins it was a nice
[44:50] thin chin chin she had nice eyes she had
[44:54] nice eyes they lit up when she spoke she
[44:57] had blue eyes very nice blue eyes
[44:59] [Music]
[45:05] this is the schedule that you helped me
[45:08] create and that's a sketch that somebody
[45:11] described of you see
[45:14] [Music]
[45:34] [Music]
[45:39] the second one looks more open Friendly
[45:43] and
[45:45] happy
[45:46] I should be more grateful I should be
[45:48] more grateful of my natural beauty it
[45:50] impacts the choices and the friends that
[45:52] we make the jobs we apply for how we
[45:54] treat our children it impacts everything
[45:57] couldn't be more couldn't be more
[45:59] critical to your happiness do you think
[46:01] you're more beautiful than you say yeah
[46:06] [Music]
[46:09] time as women analyzing and trying to
[46:12] fix the things that aren't quite right
[46:14] and we should spend more time you should
[46:16] spend more time appreciating the things
[46:18] that we do like
[46:22] perfect
[46:27] it's the more beautiful I think
[46:30] [Music]
[46:32] but we live in an age a world that
[46:36] tells you what's ready
[46:39] and then if you're displaying the
[46:41] attributes of God and what God said
[46:43] about you then the world
[46:47] the world will tell you that's
[46:48] old-fashioned that that's whatever
[46:52] this is
[47:00] what's beautiful
[47:24] if you notice
[47:27] the the the drawing that the person that
[47:30] the people met that these women met
[47:36] it looked more like a woman
[47:40] they're seeing they're looking at it and
[47:42] they're seeing the reflection of her
[47:44] beauty they're seeing what they're
[47:46] they're just they see her in a different
[47:48] light than what that woman is looking at
[47:51] herself
[48:00] she fills these things but but God has
[48:04] said that you're beautiful
[48:06] like
[48:47] in that
[48:50] a little close stay with me are you with
[48:53] me amen thank you
[48:56] Ellie
[49:02] we could be looking at ourselves in
[49:04] comparison with what the world says
[49:06] inspiration from Satan and then the
[49:10] different people have different opinions
[49:24] then
[49:26] because everyone want to tell everyone
[49:28] but so so you have to find an absolute
[49:42] change it the only opinion of what true
[49:45] beauty is
[49:47] never changes is the opinion of God
[49:52] now she says in one spot she says
[49:56] it's not the beauty it's it's it's it's
[49:59] it's it's what you how do you perceive
[50:02] yourself that impacts the jobs you
[50:04] choose if you had to choose a job
[50:21] how beautiful you are according to the
[50:24] word of God
[50:34] and if you don't see yourself that way
[50:39] ask them to show you
[50:43] it's her self-worth it has to do with
[50:46] her confidence
[50:59] of the world
[51:01] you your confidence
[51:06] and you'll miss all the positive things
[51:08] God is doing in your life
[51:12] if your point of reference is larger
[51:15] this isn't anything
[51:28] they really are
[51:30] and then at your point of reference is
[51:36] it's all when you compare yourself it
[51:39] always gives you a false sense of
[51:41] reality
[51:43] now
[51:45] real quick
[51:49] I'm doing
[51:51] pretty good amount of time
[51:55] for a minute
[51:58] Tick Tock has become the most popular of
[52:03] social media
[52:16] it works so fast it can work as fast
[52:32] are
[52:36] [Applause]
[52:38] it's particularly targeted young teenage
[52:41] girls dad you better look at her phone
[52:46] I would recommend trash in it
[52:49] it targets young teenage girls
[52:54] at least heavy on showing things
[52:57] [Applause]
[53:17] looks like
[53:38] what to believe
[53:40] they give young people dangerous
[53:42] challenges they're using medications and
[53:45] Natural Things
[53:47] [Music]
[53:49] there's an increased ADHD anymore
[54:06] they see
[54:08] inequality thinking has been fed by the
[54:11] platform
[54:13] exploded shutdowns
[54:35] their needs
[54:43] talk
[54:48] about posting very loudly about very
[54:51] intimate and intense things and people
[54:53] are encouraged to be vulnerable
[54:56] they call it as people are
[54:59] expressing these things
[55:30] doing it so if you post a video there
[55:34] can be a complete another strange review
