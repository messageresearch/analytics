========================================

the center of my life you're the reason why I can live more abundantly let there be nothing nothing placed before you so I can see you with plain view I want to do everything through Christ the center the center of my let's sing it one more time let's close our eyes and focus on him you are the center the center of my life you're the reason why I can live more of abundantly let there be nothing nothing place before you so I I can see you in plain view everything the center the center of my life amen good morning everyone God bless you maybe while we're standing we can uh take our Bibles and open up to the book of 1 Chronicles chapter 12 it's a real pleasure for my wife and me to be here uh this this week fortunately we we at first it looked like we were only going to be able to be here for a day but um things worked out we're able to be here for a couple days and we're real happy about that I really enjoyed our time last year down in Tennessee and uh we're glad to be here again it's a real privilege this is a camp that I went to uh frequently and as a uh as a young adult and it was always a blessing I just appreciate uh the attention brother Paul and brother Barry and their assemblies give to helping us be grounded and settled as we continue our walk with the Lord but today we're going to talk about uh uh the children of isachar and uh the challenge of walking in truth in an age of competing narratives that's what we'll be looking at today let's see if I can get this verse 32 and of the children of isachar which were men that had understanding of the times to know what Israel ought to do the heads of them were 200 and all their Brethren were at their commandment so we'll be taking a look today at what made these children of isachar so special about the the time that they were living in let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you very much for your goodness and Grace To Us Lord I Thank you for bringing us here for this weekend father I just pray that you would speak to each and every one of us Lord I pray that you would help us to be more grounded and S to be more ground Lord that we might know uh the more clearly the day that we're living in and how we should be living in this time lord we just ask your blessing upon this service in Jesus name amen you may be seated just going to try to position this so I can see every everybody reasonably well very good well at the uh here in 1st Chronicles 12 kind of step back and get a little bit of the context uh David had been anointed king as a young boy and um when King Saul uh saw how successful and was and what a great warrior he was after he had slain Goliath and uh Saul slain his thousands but David his 10 thousands uh David was definitely on on Saul's uh radar screen and this was a time of uh even after Saul was uh chasing David all over the country and uh David knew that he was God's anointed man for the hour but that didn't take away that David's flesh got really anxious and fearful and nervous many times even to the extent that for a couple years he actually lived in uh in PH in philistia in Goliath's Hometown he's he's he's leaving the promised land he he's he's hiding from a Saul there in the uh there in the town of his uh greatest enemy it wasn't an easy time but finally the Philistines uh um they defeated Saul's Army uh Saul's dead and uh David uh is uh is is is crowned King and when we look at our Sunday school story books it seems like that uh Saul's uh kingdom comes to its demise and David's Kingdom starts R away in the next uh story on the next next page but that's not the way it was there was actually a time of about seven eight years of of Civil War while David is King in Hebron and uh Saul's son ishbosheth is uh is is uh is King in another place I forget what the city was but there was a civil war between the two it was a time of of of great uncertainty and Israel I can imagine ishbosheth supporters the house of Saul they could be parading down the streets saying stop the steel stop the steel David is David stealing the kingdom and uh and David supporters out there make make Israel great again make Israel great again this is this this wasn't an easy time for them to live in the Sunday school story books we read like as one goes quickly from one to the other but there was a time of uh of Civil War and you can read about it in then 2 Samuel 3:1 it says there was a long war between the house of Saul in the House of David in verse six and it came to pass while there was war between the house of Saul and the House of David it wasn't an easy time and Times of transition really they're never easy and that's when we need uh people who know that what time it is and how to live in that time and uh finally um as as this uh this Civil War was kind of winding to a close um the Leading Men of Israel United together and that's what you that's what we read in 1 Chronicles CH 12 and the Leading Men of Israel come to Hebron to make David King in 1 Chronicle tells us about the men from each tribe and and you can pick this up in the in the chapter but in it talks about the men of Judah in verse uh verse 24 of 1st Chronicles 12 they sent 6,800 men armed with shields and Spears and then the tribe of Simeon sends 7,100 men All Men of Valor these men are described Levi uh sends 4,600 men led by their might Mighty priests zadok and jeho Benjamin these are Sauls this is the tribe that Saul came from they sent 3,000 men to Hebron to to Crown David King Ephraim sent over 20,000 men all all of these men were famous for their Valor manasse sent 18,000 men Zebulon sent 50,000 men the Bible says these are men who were expert in war Nally sent a thousand captains 7,000 spearmen Dan it over 28,000 expert men in war Asher sent 40,000 and two and a half tribes on the other side of Jordan they sent 120,000 men and isachar they send just 200 men they're not described of Men of Valor doesn't say whether they have swords with them Shields or spears none of that is said about the men of isachar and the men of isachar these little this party of 200 men you wouldn't even hardly see them among this this great multitude of Mighty Warriors but these were men that were special for their time because they were men of understanding they knew the times they were living it was a chaotic time and uncertain time and these were men with discernment who understood the times to know what Israel ought to do and when we live in times of uncertainty and that describes the time that we're living in it's important to be men and women of understanding I just I I enjoy reading through the messages especially sometimes the opening prayers and some of brother brandom's messages especially those messages that sound really have a have have a have a deep title because it can be it can be intimidating as as young people to uh to start getting into the message because like where do you start you've got plank upon plank upon plank of the bookshelf where do you start and it's 70 weeks of Daniel the seven sealed or it can be kind of intimidating but it's interesting in some of these messages the very first prayer at the beginning is amazingly and beautifully simple this is the paragraph two from the third seal we've come again tonight Lord to attempt this meeting and to pray thee to open to us Lord this third seal of this book that it might be known to us that we would know what to do and how to live and how to be better Christians and to me that opening prayer some just kind of cuts through the mysteriousness because God means it to be simple he means for the vision to be simple so that we can run forward and live our life with it this isn't an isolated prayer and paragraph four is your life worthy of the Gospel brother bradam says we've assembled together father for no other purpose but to try to learn how to live better and to live close to you for we see the day approaching paragraph two of Christ is the mystery of God revealed again he's just praying for the guidance of the Holy Spirit as we meet together this morning to teach your word that we might know how to live in this present day and what is the time of day that we're living in and we can keep on going with these but again this this is paragraph 40 a man running from the presence of the Lord that we might know how to live in this present day at the approaching of the Lord Jesus that we might know just how to live in this present day what to look forward to what to do brother brandham was a man of isachar he was a man of understanding who who knew the time that we were living in to know what Israel to know what the bride ought to do in that time that's what that's the kind of people that we want to be today also that's our purpose of being here Lord we love you we're trying to prepare for that hour it's a time of great uncertainty so we want to know the time that we're living in and how we should and how we should be living in this in this time brother Brandon says we're living in a day of great uncertainty since time first began back in the Garden of Eden When sin came in and broke eternity into time I don't believe there's ever been a space of time with so much uncertainty as today because there's not even one hope left in the natural world today a lot of uncertainty and he just goes on later in the message what kind of uncertainty is there there's the uncertainty of of home life and it's not an unusual thing anymore um get a group of young people together especially out out out out out in the world you're unique if you have a mom and dad who stay together and and help you as a as as a as a healthy family and that can even come into come into our own ranks within the message just because you know moms and dads um maybe they weren't Believers or maybe they started as Believers and then things happened and they and their Rel relationship got strained and they might have got and they and they might have gotten divorced and and as as as kids we can feel very conflicted about that we can even blame ourselves that that's our fault it's not your fault like brother uh like Brother Sam was preaching last night there many men in the Bible sus who get them who find themselves in really difficult circumstances and they didn't do anything to get them there Daniel did nothing wrong to find himself in Babylon he did nothing wrong to get thrown into the lion's dead and you might feel like your home life is a lion's den and you might feel I wish I could have done this if I had have been a better kid maybe Mom and Dad would have stayed together those are the thoughts of the devil you you're not responsible for that but you might have done nothing wrong like you find yourself in the lion Den but the angel of the Lord can be with you right there and can strengthen you because that's the unfortunately a broken home is the new normal today and the devil's going to is is is knocking on the homes of Believers even till today to break them up but doesn't matter what kind of home life you have you can still be an overcomer there remember I was teaching years ago was just in the extraordinary circumstance um a home was one of my students home was just was breaking up before us and was really really sad and you're teaching your your kids you see the and you see the strain in the kids's eyes how difficult it is for them and I was teaching one day in Bible class and the Lord just gave open the scripture from Psalm 27 says that when my father and my mother forsake me then the Lord will take me up that's Psalm 27:10 so no matter what circumstances we can find ourselves in and say oh man I'm don't live in the perfect message home I'm sorry there's no perfect message home there's no perfect believer there's no perfect Christian we're all needing the the grace and the power of God um but when my mom and dad forsake me the Lord will take me up in these times of great uncertainty God's still there with you that doesn't change home life can be uncertain your job can be uncertain I mean we're all most of us here um how many of us are uh 29 and under 18 to 29 years we're all J zers then and the Gen Z you're coming of age um yeah some of us were in college around the financial crisis of 2008 2009 that's not a really good time to enter the job market I was at Ohio State and doing a year of graduate school which I never finished I met my wife that same year and I got my married instead of my masters but I was very glad to be that one year in graduate school because I how could I find a job that's really tough and then you co hits and the econom is very uncertain we live in uncertain times uncertainty of War I'd never really expected in in my lifetime to have the kind of global uncertainty of of war that we see today in the Middle East in Ukraine in uh in South Asia Asia um all over the place there's a lot of uncertainty about war the uncertainty of of of of churches it's very easy to uh we can look at at at church as being our anchor and church is a great thing we have a we can have great deacons great pastors great Sunday school teachers but those are not our anchors and um I I I I grew up in a message Church like many of you did and I I probably grew up with a good dose of uh of Church Pride so glad I had the the best pastor in the message the best Church in the message and then my pastor of so many years gets up and leaves the message talk about the time of uncertainty and you think everything is is rocks all in your life you've got the Holy Spirit you're going forward and then that happens like what am I going to do now God it's a time of uncertainty and that can that can affect a person and and um you know what I'm you can kind of almost you hate to see those things happen I kind of think though about the story of the wise man who build his house upon a rock and the foolish man who build his house upon the sand and the man who built his house upon the sand the winds came the storm came and the Wall came tumbling down right Splat well the Bible describes it great was the fall of it great was the fall of his house but it was also a great opportunity because if your faulty Foundation exposed you have an opportunity to build upon a foundation stronger than your pastor you have the opportunity to build upon a foundation that's stronger than your parents you have an opportunity to build upon a foundation where God's word is being laid Brick by Brick In your own heart and when my pastor left the message that was a very difficult time for me I was already married I had I had I had I I I had a son I'm responsible leading my home but it was it was a shaking time but it was I can look back and say it was it was a good time because God was putting us on a rock solid foundation oh uncertain sounds elections if brother brandom only knew how uncertain elections could be I'm not looking forward to next year's election year anybody else no it's it's it's it's an uncertain time and the level of uh vital is just so uh so uh so so high how that time has whoops how that time has come now so much uncertainty and you can look I mean all these are are are pretty great uncertain things but the level of uncertainty that the devil brings into it I had to check into a flight recently and usually when you check into your flight you it's a matter of course just put your pass your your passport number in all that kind of stuff your name and this was the first time I'd ever gotten this menu for gender What UN uncertain times and and we can and we can chuckle at it but it's it's not a funny thing because the people don't even know who they are or what they are and the and the and the worst thing about it you know growing up in adolescence that's a tough thing we feel strange things as we're growing up in adolesence our body send us all kinds of signals and the way the world is today even with uh schools even on your computers as you're scroll scrolling on your phones we see things that we don't really want to see we see things we weren't looking for but it can still impact you it can still grab your attention get your thoughts going in a certain way a certain direction and it's it's it's a rough thing and when folks are already in a time of their life when there's a lot of Uncertain with uh hormones and your body is changing all those things and then thoughts come you should identify with this you've got this particular feeling that's the way you are maybe maybe yeah why am I I I I uh someone I I I know a friend of mine growing up she was thinking yeah why am I such Trends good Trends with all all the girls around me I really don't have any good guy friend she comes home and asks her mom mom does that mean I'm lesbian that wouldn't have been a question I was asked 20 years ago but because all these thoughts are already there and then there then the Devil's trying to get you to identify with certain things and then you make it a a part of your identity and not just something that you feel that you want to yeah we're we're created in God's image but we're in sinense all the things that we feel we can't identify with them because that's the effects of sin in our lives but the devil makes it so hard and then man why do I not seem to fit in think maybe I'm a maybe I'm a guy in a girl's body or the other way around he's giving confusion and uncertainty all over the place and um more than ever before we need men of isar who can know the time that we're living in and how we need to live in this time it's important that um to recognize that facts and Truth are two different things things can be factual but are they true because there are many ways to put facts together into a narrative but only one of them can be right now what is this word narrative come across it sometimes but this is a uh it's a way of presenting or understanding a situation or series of events that's going to reflect or promote a particular point of view or set of values this isn't a word that we might use every single day if you listen to the news much or or watch the news you you you'll hear it bandied about but um narratives are important give you a little example here's a uh picture of my lovely family somewhat dated picture but but uh they're still lovely nonetheless um but we recently moved um got into a new house and my uh my son was uh pointing out to me the the truth that um this kitchen does not have a dishwasher and he was highly concerned about this because this is like this is all of a sudden the number one Home Improvement project that we've got to get a dishwasher I said job I think we'll be okay cuz I think we've got three dishwashers no what do you mean Dad no I got one two Dad no we need a dishwasher so um so we still don't have we still have the three dishwashers and uh my wife was the youngest of six they didn't have a dishwasher growing up they had six dishwashers as well and um we've kind of gotten into a little bit of the routine after supper we just kind of make ourselves scarce and the kids can work on washing the dishes and I try to find a corner of the house as far away from the kitchen as possible cuz this is not a real peaceful time of the evening so one one one one evening I'm in the other corner of the house making a fire because that's what men do when it's kind of cool outside it's kind of nice you're making your fire and all of a sudden you I just hear these explosions in the kitchen going on and then my wife says kids get to work in there if I hear anything else so all of a sudden my blood pressure just goes to the roof and I could there's a problem I'm going to solve it I'm about the point where I RI my belt up it's that kind of a thing so I just go there guys what's going on here and I just my my little girl the youngest one she's crying on the ground said mama told you to get up and do the dishes stand up bam I gave her a spank in my son's eyes Dad she didn't do anything he was mortified that his father had just perpetrated this act of Injustice because all that had happened was little Sophie had fallen on the floor and started crying I heard what I heard and I put it into a narrative that my kids are messing up they're disobeying if I spare the rod I will spoil the child I will take care of this narratives get give meaning and I got the narrative wrong and when we get the narrative wrong the facts of the situation were all the same child on the floor when they shouldn't have been children crying when they should have been effectively efficiently working those are the facts but my narrative I got it all wrong and I had to go back apologize to my children I had to help little Sophie do the dishes so that worked out that was my Act of uh active Penance there but we see the importance of a narrative cuz just the facts we think knowing facts is everything no you're not even halfway home by knowing facts it's the narrative how you understand those facts that is the most important and we live in a world where you've got all kinds of political events going on and uh there can be the same events take a look same people this is a protest in Berlin recently these are Palestinians uh Palestinian supporters protesting they're not conflicting that there was that there was an event that happened October 7th the the people can be talk about the same people same events but whether you think they're terrorists or Freedom Fighters all depends on your narrative same events same people but the narrative is what's important I was surprised uh I just read yesterday uh a recent poll uh surveying American young people j z 18 to 29 year olds ex 20% of them had a positive View of Osama bin Laden 20% of them so if we were basically were to ask like the first four row to stand here that would be the group that would have a positive view of Osama bin Lon 30% say his views were actually a Force for good he just shouldn't have been so violent with them how can this be it's the narrative it's the the way of understanding certain events they're not disputing he caused the 10 20 Towers to fall that's not in dispute it's the it's the it's the narrative behind it the way the way of understanding and I I admire what Benjamin Netanyahu when he made a speech shortly after October 7th he brought the Jews right back to what the narrative was the the truth is remember what amlc has done to you don't forget that because this is the battle that that we're in and it's important for us to go back what kind of battle are we in we're not battling against flesh and blood we're battling against principalities against Powers that's the narrative and we can get distracted by so many things nowadays we can get distracted by oh man we're so frustrated with Trump we're so frustrated with b and we're so Frid we can get caught up in all those little narratives none of those narratives really have that much impact on our soul and I Proverbs I think Proverbs chapter 4 says keep your heart with all diligence and it can be so hard when when we can when when when when our when political Flames can be so ignited we we care so much about one party or the other party and we're not keeping our heart then because we'll be following the news much more than we follow God's word at that point and and and we're not keeping our heart then so it's it's important um to remember what narrative is actually true and it used to be there General acceptance that there was one narrative that was true and that's God's narrative that's Revelation but God says um yeah you can agree or disagree with it but that's what God said that's the that's the reigning narrative but in our world um Revelation is kind of U there is no Revelation anymore there are no absolutes and instead of absolutes there are just conflicting narratives there's narrative one two 3 four and what does this do they said basically any narrative that you espouse can have equal value that's your Truth for you that's your Truth for you all it does really is just replace certainty with questions and that's what's happened today because there is no more re the world says there's no more revealed truth you have what you think is true they have what they think is true and we just kind of let the rest stay in the middle but this is a uh I can remember when I was in college I was I was in the cafeteria I was eating breakfast there by myself with my Bible open in the cafeteria and uh and uh having my devotions at breakfast at the same time and I came across this Psalm and I think it was ining finals week I have more understanding understanding than all my teachers I really liked that one I really like that one why is it though my teachers my professors KN know a lot more facts than I do but the number of facts isn't what determines wisdom it's the understanding that determines wisdom you might know far fewer facts but if you can put those facts together the right way like the men of isachar did you will have far more understanding than your teachers why because your testimonies are your meditation and that's is a there's a lot of lot of um competition for our for our attention nowadays Daniel chapter 12 describes the last days but thou o Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased this describes the day that we live in knowledge being increased people running to and fro the time of the end is characterized by this increasing knowledge yet we also see that knowledge itself is not enough to overcome that's not enough because in this scripture there's something that's kept back and what's kept back shut up the words seal the book till the time of the end that which is sealed up that is kept back and that is what is going to be enough to make an overcomer but just knowledge running to and fro that's not going to be enough God has Unleashed Revelation Unleashed understanding in this day and that is what makes us uh Victorious so our purpose this morning is to speak about how we can have an understanding of the times we do live in a world where knowledge abounds and there'll be more knowledge than we can really keep track of it just a time of of confusion we live in this world um via Google knowledge is literally at your fingertips you can ask Google any question you can ask chat GPT just any question and they'll give you a good answer and uh in my small group this morning we were talking about seeking God's will for your life and um it's not always easy to get an answer really quickly from the Lord on these things Google though you type in a question you'll get the answer in a couple milliseconds that's the kind of waiting time that gen Z is used to but that's not how God works and Google really doesn't care about God's will for your life they just care about clicks and your ad Revenue so don't go to Google for the big questions of your life you take those to the word of God take those to the Lord um there in there in in prayer all this knowledge Google has plenty of facts out there but all the knowledge all the facts don't imply wisdom in fact wisdom couldn't be further away than what we find on the internet today um I shared this last year that uh um hands down the two most dangerous words in the English language today are studies show you can find a study to uh to verify anything that you want to have verified and there's a and a lot of studies nowadays have to be called back because they're not verifiable there's plagiarism issues so we can look and try to find via Google um an answer with footnotes it's uh uh psychologically verified and all that that is not an absolute absolute there's only one of those that's the word of God so we have lots of facts out there but the important thing is where is truth brother brandom says the days are growing evil because man's knowledge that he received in the Garden of Eden when he left the Tree of Life to eat from the Tree of knowledge that knowledge man's knowledge is increasing constantly and as knowledge is increases they get away from the Bible and get into a theory we see that today and what this is getting away from the Bible That's Revelation you're getting into a theory that's narrative 1 narrative two narrative three narrative four there's really no absolute anymore and now the power has come for the world has become very skeptical and skepticism that's something we're just basically holding anything that has a claim of Truth at Arms length I'm not going to I don't know if I really want to accept that or not I can I I don't see this is really right about it that's really right about it I I'll listen to it look at it but I'm not going to accept it I'm not going to accept this either because I see this this and this is potential problems there a skeptic keeps everything at arms length and will Embrace nothing because he wants to keep himself safe from all the from anything that could lead him astray and if you getting away from the Bible getting into theories getting the narratives then you don't have anything that has a has a claim of Truth on you and I wouldn't have thought about this but this skepticism this has a connection to the spirit of the day one of the The Book of Revelation talks about uh lukewarmness as characterized in the age of laoda and uh synonymous for Luke Waris you can be uncommitted indifferent unconcerned irresolute you kind of keep things at arms length you'll be undecided and um I'd always kind of thought about lukewarmness as being yeah yeah living a little bit of a compromising life not really on fire for the Lord but there's more to it from that when brother brandham discusses it this from from the church age book he's crying out to this last age this lukewarm age you have the word you have more Bibles than ever but you're not doing anything about the word except dividing and hacking into pieces taking what you want and leaving out what you don't want you're not interested in living it but debating it and that's the you you can talk about you can you have one person's narrative of what God's word means somebody else's narrative what God words mean somebody else's narrative what God's word means and you can be skeptical of it because you can just talk and debate hack it to Pieces take what you want that he says that is lukewarmness because you're not accepting anything you're just keeping it at arms length and what um you're not you're not interested in living it but debating it talking about it that's not living it but just debating it because says I would sooner you were cold or hot if you were cold or rejected that I could stand that that if you'd get white hot to know its truth and live it I'd praise you for that that is when when when you're when when when you're you're lukewarm you're not doing anything about it you really giving the answer either way you're just living in the gray of questions and questions that's is a uh this is a this is a time in our lives in the world today where nobody really likes truth because truth has a claim on us we have to do something with truth whereas a question that can be actually kind of convenient um it's easy to it's easier to talk about truth and discuss it with questions because if you're just asking questions you really can't be wrong and sometimes when you ask questions some people ask questions to um actually get an answer other people ask questions to show off what they know if you've been in college you probably I've heard that you go to this Prof this Symposium or something and somebody gets up and asks a question five minutes into their talk they haven't even asked their question they just want to show off what they know they're they're not really seeking truth but how do we live in a world um where questions are the greatest and instead of just actually seeking truth how do we deal with the questions and Pope Francis he kind of uh epitomizes the spirit of the day who am I to judge the Catholic Church used to have pretty strong stands of morality on uh whether it be abortion um marriage there were some pretty strong stands but now he's just eroding all of this as who am I to judge he's not taking a taking a stand there and he's gotten some uh some flak for that he recently had a a conference at the Vatican with a bunch of Bishops and and priest and this the following article was written by one of the priests who was there who was critical of them he says Pope Francis is just giving question marks no man will give his life for a question mark he will for an exclamation point question marks litter the landscape certainty appears to be a problem not a solution without truth we're only left with our own conclusions which aren't truths Worth Dying For and thus aren't truths worth living for and I think this is a really uh perceptive remark um this is the world today there there are are are questions abound as long as you're asking questions you're doing great but really questions are there to get to truth people talk about it's all the journey the journey is more important than the destination well try telling your kids that after a 15-hour road trip the destination's important questions are also important if they get you the truth if a question doesn't get you the truth it might just be distracting you and taking up your time and the Vatican has has has has has has an issue here truth is certain it's an exclamation point um if there's an EXC there's a I get to I do I do a a class in my in in junior high towards the beginning of the year how to write emails because all of a sudden when the kids get into junior high they have their own email address they can start emailing me and I get quite the emails sometimes with bold letter types and and Exclamation point Exclamation point Mr crook would you please do this Exclamation point Exclamation point Exclamation Bo today please bold the police might not be there and then they give their names we you kind of need to how do you use how do you write an email you don't use bold face all caps exclamation points too much with your boss or your teacher that kind of thing but exclamation points they're meant to get out and grab your attention that's what they're meant for truth is certain and Truth God's truth is has exclamation points John the Baptist wasn't just saying would you like to repent would you think about maybe repenting that's not how John the Baptist was his repent the kingdom of heaven at hand it's not like our our moms who get us up for for for want to get up now it's time to go to school want to get up sweetheart come on I got breakfast for I got your favor you can I that's not how God's truth works is get up now got to get the table now repent or um behold the bridegroom comes go out to meet him now this is what truth is it meant action but that's not uh how the devil likes uh to have us have truth he wants to take all these exclamation points of Truth and show them in another light to kind of bend them gradually into a question mark because then there's nothing we have to do now not all questions many question you know uh teachers will tell you or students tell you there's no such thing as a stupid question that's uh that's uh true um not all questions um are bad not all but not all questions are are as as good as others we know that as well uh just ask the person who lives in customer service if all questions are equally good they're not but sometimes God will do things in a certain way with the intention of creating a question and here's an example in Exodus chap 12 this is as the Israel is getting the Passover ready for the first time all these families have gotten the instructions from Moses what they're supposed to do with the lamb what they're supposed to do with the Lamb's blood blood how they're supposed to apply I just ad door everything and Moses says do it this way he says it shall come to pass when you come under the land when the Lord he will give you according to he's promised you'll keep this service and it shall come to pass when your children shall say unto you why are we doing this God is doing things in a certain way to raise a question among the Next Generation so that when they say why are we doing this this way Dad Dad will say I'm so glad you asked and you can explain the importance of redemption by Blood so sometimes we can come through come up to questions in our lives that can be very uncomfortable because when you ask a question you have to make yourself vulnerable you have to admit I don't know this I'm uncertain about this and that's we don't like doing that I can remember growing up in the message I had uh questions how God is sending a prophet are we not following a man I I went to a Baptist Church school and I I I hear all the uh about the trinitarian verses in the Bible there are in trinitarian interpretations of the verses in the Bible and questions back and forth and for a long time I was afraid to ask the questions because I would be afraid man if I go ask somebody in my church to look at me what do you mean don't you believe the message and that and the fear of that question was just it stopped me dead in my tracks and consequently I didn't ask my questions for a long time and I just got more confused more confused more confused and didn't what to do with it and finally I can remember I was down at Louisiana camp and there was a Saturday evening service and I went to Camp full of expectation that God was going to give me what I had asked for and at the end of the services the altar call I'm up there just praying and praying and praying and the people next to me they're being prayed for and they're just they're just praising the Lord because God's answering their prayer and everybody in the congregation is singing victory is mine victory is mine and when you don't feel like you have Victory yet that is about the most Lonesome feeling in the world that's how I was and finally I just left the altar there and went back to my seat and I didn't know I I was praying asking God to to help me with my issue and nothing was happening and finally I got to a point I was miserable enough that I didn't care what somebody asked and I I approached brother Tim through it after brother Tim you have a few minutes I could talk to I've got some questions and now that's a beautiful thing because I struggled with my question long enough that I cared enough for the truth that's an important thing and it reminds me of a story of a man named Socrates from U ancient uh Greece some young uh some young uh young guy was came up to me asked hey could I be your could I be your student I'd really like to learn from you could I could I and Sak okay you want learn with me so he says sure so come ahead says come ahead so socres takes the guy and they go on the walk down to the center of the city you want to be my you want to be my student you want to learn of me that's fine and they finally they get seated here um by the fountain at the center of the city a Socrates then grabs the guy and puts his head in the fountain holds it there and holds it there long minute and the guy starts flailing he starts flailing he starts flailing till finally he throws Socrates office what are you trying to do to me and Socrates said when you care for answers the way you care for the air you breathe then you can be my student and that's not how Google treats you you can type I could have back then it wasn't so I don't even know if Google was invented back then I could have just typed my my my question online and could have got gotten the answer a couple seconds later and answer a couple seconds later but the virtue of having to wait months for that answer gave me a much higher care I cared about the answer because I had months of misery invested into actually seeking I mean Proverbs Chapter 2 if you seek after knowledge if you cry for understanding Google doesn't want you to cry for anything but God wants us to he he's willing to put us through hard times so that we care about this truth more than anything else that uh so I finally asked my question you know what brother Tim didn't say brother how long have you been in the message and you lack that Revelation he didn't talk down to me nothing at all he just opened the Bible and started going through things going through things and 20 minutes later we were we were done and I asked brother Tim I was praying at the altar where the Holy Spirit was moving why didn't God come and answer my question said well bud you have a Bible question you have a Bible answer and God answered my prayer he didn't answer it right there at the altar but he answered a little bit later and that was kind of the beginning for me where the message kind of making it my own you could read and and and and starting to see more and more of it so sometimes God will do things in a certain way he'll say things in a certain way that cause questions because he wants us to ask questions because when you start asking questions you're become personally invested and you'll and you'll remember it better thereafter however there are also other kinds of questions that um might not be quite so good let's um we'll skip this here look at this I didn't finish that from Exodus chapter 25 a good question the the so the children ask why are we doing this Dad gives the answer it's a sacrifice of the Lord Passover this is what God did for us and when a real question's answered like that it ends up the people bowing ahead and worshiping you get closer to God you remove those things that were keeping you from worshiping and and and you can enter in because those things will be taken care of that's that that's a really neat thing brother brandham at the start of a question answer service he says I'm not there yet he says these things are questions on the people's hearts and he wants to go over them because I trust it'll clear up our thoughts that we'll know what to do know how to live better after our questions are answered this sounds again like the spirit of the the visar want to clear up those things so we know what to do and how to live better that's an important thing but again the devil likes trying to bend those exclamation points into question marks and we just saw an example of questions that God intends for us to ask there are other kinds of questions that um we need to be aware of because they're not going to lead us to the Lord questions they're they're a nice uh nice argumentation tool or debating tool like I said they can be a way of showing off your knowledge but they can also be a way of downplaying the significance of truth without coming right out against it and that mean it can be kind of subtle because they don't really say anything but between the words they are and you can also uh um you're making someone who keeps asking questions in this way they're really not standing for anything they're just chipping away at that Foundation that you have so you really can't disagree with them because they're not saying anything they're just asking questions and these kinds of questions do you really think that's what God actually meant and what other ways could we understand this verse to be more in inclusive how do other people look at this these kinds of questions are more with the intent of taking those exclamation points of Truth hammering them down and erecting a question mark in their place and that is a spirit of the time that we live in just like that Catholic priest said certainty appears to be the problem and questions be the solution that's not the case we're not just meant to ask questions and never get answers we're not meant to go on the journey never get to the destination the destination matters too not just the journey we started with our men a visitar with a slide with this Compass anybody see an exclamation point on the compass you certainly do it's right there and when you're looking for truth you want a compass that's very certain you don't want to have a compass that is uh I don't know where do you want to go today I don't know where do you want to go today no you want a compass that tells you where North is even if it tells you you're wrong you've been going south and you've been telling your wife I know I'm going the right way what about the comp oh I'm wrong honey you want a compass that tells you the truth a compass has an exclamation point at the top of it now we said that um there's no such thing as a stupid question I will however want to talk for a few minutes about the kind of question that Paul talks about that he says you should avoid these kinds of questions and that is a foolish question because there are a lot of those out there today Paul says avoid foolish questions and that word foolish means impious or Godless a question that doesn't have God in it is probably a question meant to get you away from God but Paul tells Titus a young man avoid foolish questions avoid genealogies contentions strivings about the law for they are unprofitable and vain 1 Timothy 1:4 neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies which minister questions rather than Godly edifying which is in faith those questions that God kind of plants in our path like like he did for the uh people in the Passover the people as there when and Joshua crossed the Jordan River into the promise and he had the people build this uh altar of stones so that when they're young people their children ask what is this altar of stones here for they could give the answer those kinds of questions have God embedded in them so we can be brought back to God but questions that are this there to minister more questions to minister more questions Paul describes those as foolish questions the end of the're they're not edifying the end of the Commandment is Charity out of a pure heart and of a good good conscience of Faith unfeigned from which some having swerved aside un vain jangling vain jangling is just noise uncertain sounds not giving I mean a certain sound is when the the the bugler plays his Trump and go off to battle you want that bug to give a certain sound you know exactly what you're supposed to do but the little Vin jangle that's just distracting some have turned aside unto vain jangling Paul says Desiring to be teachers of the law understanding neither what they say nor whereof they affirm I think this is important here because it shows that there are people like to ask questions who don't even know what they stand for they're just asking questions but not really standing for anything themselves and um tell you when when you go through a time um of of of seeking when you're looking for truth and you're not and you're not sure and this is this is a similar time that I went through after my pastor of many many years left the message man now what do I do and I got to reading all kinds of things I I read everything that was out there against the message I read it I wasn't sure what what what what what am I going to do now I I I got into and there are a lot of I can look back now a lot of foolish questions there but um I can remember you can think if you're not certain about something if you're going through a math problem and say yeah 5x + 2 is 17 how do you solve it some people look at the X oh Lord there's an X in my math what am I supposed to do math is supposed to be numbers what am I supposed to do here and you can just get obsessed with what you don't know that's foolish you when you go about seeking look at what you do know well you know that two was added to the 5x so I'm going to take the two away then I got the 5x by itself I got and then I've got 15 / 5 x is going to be three how did I get there I was focusing on what I knew instead of what I don't know and the devil likes us with barrages with all kinds of questions and then we're not even sure we're not sure of anything anymore I can remember one time years ago I was at a camp under the family campus in Ohio and there was a Ministry just preached away and it was a it was a i it to me it was a deep sermon which meant I didn't understand very much of it at all and that at the end of the service at the end of the camp everybody was just rejoicing rejoicing rejoicing and I was confused I didn't I I didn't get much of anything and then again you feel so alone then everybody else was rejoicing you just like I didn't get a thing I you feel so bad back there but what helped me at that moment question came has God saved you yes God has saved me so I can I might not have understood 90% of that sermon but I knew that God saved me so I was already I could start injuring in and praising God for saving me because when we when when we feel I didn't get a thing I'm not a part of it the devil will start feeding that and is it true I didn't understand anything yes that is true the that is a fact and it's a true fact but the devil's going to put his interpretation to it you didn't understand it therefore there's not a receiver for truth inside of you therefore you this might not be a child of God and he's got this thought in there which is is a true thought I didn't understand much at all but he puts his interpretation on it and that gets you to start walking away from truth you're not even you're not even going to re praising God he can't take your salvation away from you but he practically did I wasn't even able to praise God for but you know what as soon as I started praising God thank you Lord yes you did save me thank you Lord for dying on the cross for me thank you Lord I appreciate thank you and before too long I was able to clap I was able sing and that Spirit just kind of lifted the devil tries to take away even that which we have don't let him do that so when you're confused you're not sure focus on what you do know and let God take care of what you don't know God will send an algebra teacher in your life and he'll take care of the x's and the Y's but foolish questions some characteristics of them foolish questions seek controversy not truth truth foolish questions they're just there to to stoke the fires keep things going and in my probably about year and a half two years I was I wasn't sure yeah I I wanted to believe the message but I just I I had all these questions barraging me I was and I was focusing on all those things but I finally I wondered and I've got a a file somewhere on my computer where I kind of dumped my thoughts I kind of thought would any answer be enough enough would any answer be enough and if it's a foolish question no there won't be any answer that would be enough you could come out and say this you could give every answer every single question they've asked so far it's hard to keep track of them because you start answering one line then something else comes up and something else comes up as soon as you start answering one line they really don't care about the answer they just want to keep on questioning would any answer ever be enough if it's not they're not really caring about truth they just want controversy foolish questions are not going to edify they're not going to promote godliness and foolish questions they're going to affirm nothing they're just going to be skeptical chipping away at the foundation that uh that that that that you're on and I can remember uh These Foolish questions they're not edifying they're not promoting godliness and that year and a half period whatever it was um I would get up in the morning and I used to have my daily devotions I'd get my Bible out and I I'd read but in that time period I didn't open my bible so much as I opened my computer and I read their website and I thought that I'm seeking God this way that's a foolish question because that's a foolish question it's not leading you to God it's leading you to another source besides the Bible that was a foolish question and it also times of prayer I wasn't really seeking God that way so much was again what's the next thing on the website what's the next video that's been posted what's the next thing and you just you're you're just driving yourself crazy in anxiety what's the next thing that's going to come out what's the next thing that's going to come out but it wasn't edifying it wasn't PR in godliness at all and one thing that kind of uh I finish this do a couple more scriptures here full of but foolish uned questions avoid knowing that they gender stries and the servant of the Lord must not strive the servant of the Lord isn't going to be a debater who's going to be there to win every single argument we're not here to win arguments we're here to win hearts and sometimes we put way too much too much to focus on being right we want to be shown to be right that's God doesn't care about being shown to be right it's more important to be right than to show yourself to be right the servant of the Lord must not not strive but be gentle unto all men apt to teach patient in meekness instructing those who depose themselves if God will peradventure give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil who are taken captive by him at his will in this last scripture what is the snare of the devil These Foolish questions can a snare of the devil because foolish questions they are traps masquerading as questions because the devil's going to lay a trap out there and if you're a Trapper you're going to put your trap out there and you disguise it so the animal won't won't won't won't see it and there's nothing as innocent looking as a question because there's no such thing as a stupid question so you see this out there you an interesting question and you step right where the question mark is you're caught that's one of the characteris ICS of a foolish question it's a trap it's a snare of the devil and I got to thinking um there are These Foolish questions failure to discern what kind of a question it is that could end up pretty badly that's how it was in the Garden of Eden the Fallen Eden it all started with a question a question that was wasn't discerned to be a foolish question Genesis 3:1 the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yay hath God said You shall not eat of every tree of the garden doesn't sound like anything wrong there yeah God said it praise the Lord wow you could go multiple ways with that but what was the purpose of that question because a lot of times question questions going can be a smoke screen and what's behind the question that's what you really got to try to deserve not the question itself and that Eve didn't discern what kind of question it was this question this question wasn't posed to direct Eve to God but it was actually a snare to draw her away from God and when we're on a journey when we've got questions popping up we need a certain guide we need a guide with exclamation points of truth that we can follow and the devil wants to send us through life with a question mark on our Compass but God gives us exclamation points of Truth and unfortunately today many people don't mind having a question mark on their Compass because they get to choose the way for themselves but once you get to the destination all of a sudden then you care did did you get to the right one or not so handling foolish questions um the first thing is think that we can say we're not always obligated to answer Jesus was asked many questions and very rarely did he ever give an answer that was direct to the person's question Jesus would be ask a question he just might start telling a story it didn't seem to answer the question at all he's telling the story about a coin that got lost or about uh a son who uh who squandered his inheritance he was answering the question but not the way the questioner wanted it to be answered and um I think often about um about Stephen as well step's trial was kind of was pretty similar to the trial of Jesus it was a shame it was set up from the very beginning the people who were accusing stepen they'd already paid people to ask the questions they there were no sincere questions there at all they knew the answer that they wanted to get the the the end of it was already determined from the very beginning and it's interesting Stephen has asked this question in uh in Acts chapter 7 you don't have to turn there just want to see with how the uh question gets started and you kind of see the remarkable way that he answers it and um the high priest has has has accused him of speaking Blasphemous words against the holy place and against the law and as Steven's there the high priest waves his fingers are these things so and the way that I would have started ask answering that question I would have I would probably tend to respond directly to what the question was about what am I being accused of but I would have if I had done that I would have just be breathing Oxygen on on the fire and it would have ignited Steven doesn't do that Ste it's kind of like the like a traffic officer pulls somebody to the side and says do you realize how fast you were going and why were you doing this and then all of a sudden Stephen answers in the days of Abraham in the days of Isaac that's how Stephen answers the question he doesn't seem to answer the question at all but what he's doing he's answering the question behind the question because Stephen is showing you're putting me on trial just like your fathers killed prophets just like your your fathers killed this Prophet your father came against Moses he was answering the question but not the question they put into words but the question that was igniting their hearts and that's that takes a lot of wisdom because if we directly engage with the question sometimes we're just blowing blowing oxygen there on the fire it'll blow up on our face if they really want to seek truth let them seek truth if it might just be a foolish question but I love what brother brandom says about Stephen this in the message sudden secret going away of the church in every age God's had Thunderbolt prophets and signs and wonders to condemn the thing in the midst of all popularity and stand alone for God but not only that but what if I would speak of the time of little stepen we all like the the prophets the Thunderbolts and the signs and wonders and God has had those in every day but brother R says God didn't just have that not only that not a prophet not a pastor little Steven just a member of the body of Christ how this little fellow stood before the Sanhedrin Council that morning and spoke out to those who were condemning him you stiff necks Etc he wasn't a pastor you can't expect your pastor to do it all you can't expect your trustee board to do it all or your Deacon board you've got to make yourself ready it's an individual Affair and that's what God we want to want somebody else to come to answer the question handle things sometimes that God had little Steven he has us there here us here here as well so it's a it's a powerful thing to be able to discern um if it's a foolish question or not and I can remember when I was wrestling with my questions for that time period one thing that kind of struck me as not being quite right was a lot of times questions can be posed in a really scoffing manner where it's just kind of personal attacks character attacks against brother Brandon and highly dis respectful sometimes and I just thought a scripture came to mind and it's in the book of Jude chapter 9 and it describes um a dispute that Michael the Archangel had with um with h the devil they were disputing about the body of Moses and it says Michael the Archangel when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses but he did not dare to bring against him a railing slanderous accusation but he said the Lord rebuke you and I just thought man if Michael the Archangel would have that much respect for the devil not to just be a slanderous accusation he just said the Lord rebuke he he was respectful of his opponent you could say there how much more should we be respectful when we're having a conversation with fellow human beings made in the image of God and when I saw the the spirit of scoffing that was often upon the questions I would be reading and feeding upon I just this doesn't ring ring right and another thing that kind of helped me here um it's important that we we have a we have a principle in the Bible um when when John the Baptist came he came to make ready a people prepared for the Lord and when Christ Ministry came his disciples were kind of John the Baptist disciples were kind of concerned because we you're you're losing followers John this isn't what's supposed to happen is it and John said he must increase and I decrease that's the spiritual pattern God sends a prophet and he's supposed to have the attention for a time but at a certain point that decreases so we can have the our Focus increasing upon Christ that's the way it was with John and Jesus and that's the way it is now brother brandom's life story isn't our foundation that isn't our Focus if that was your foundation this is a great opportunity to actually look past his life story look at what he preached what he taught because that is what we can build ourselves on because he brought us back to a Bible foundation and Bible faith and the more that I spent time actually there a there was a a point I started what I want to go back and I'm just going to start listening to the messages 1947 I'm just going to start listening to may be having on my computer screen because some it's not really very uh you can't hear it real well but I just started listening listening I said I want to get to know this messenger for myself from the beginning so I did that I listened to those messages did for uh you can go through the first couple years pretty quickly because there's not a lot of them but you can just kind of get a feel and it's just the genuiness just Rings through Rings through I mean my goodness if somebody was trying to be a a fake or a fraud he's going to put his best foot forward but brother brandom never stopped singing he was a terrible singer and he just kind of sings away and I guess I'm I got to work on that my wife and son pointed out last church service at the end we started singing a song said honey they muted your mic really fast and job said yeah Dad you were really really off key but that didn't matter to brother Brandon he just sang he wasn't worried about coming across as polished or anything like that he just he was just who he was and that was and that was true um another thing that that really um that really got me I I read on a this is a website of a of a fellow young Minister friend I spent time with fellowship with and and you've probably had it too when someone who's a close friend leaves that hurts I I was reading his his his website one day and he got to writing about the Book of Malachi he said hold up the Book of Malachi Mal Mal isn't even written to the Gentiles Malachi is completely for the Jews so Malachi 4 couldn't apply to us because he says Malachi 1 verse1 says the burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi so if it's to Israel You're pulling all things out of context to say that Malachi 4 applies to the to the Gentiles that can't be right I read that hold up that can't be right either I got to looking at my scripture in Malachi 1:1 that's supposed to be just is Israel it says for the from the rising of the Sun to the going down of the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles I just thought man how trust how how trustworthy are these folks who I'm putting as my sources to lead me into truth if they're if they're we playing this fast and loose because this manner of Bible interpretation doesn't work because we just had Christmas guys Isaiah 7:14 says a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and you'll call his name Emanuel but Isaiah 1:1 says the vision of Isaiah the son of Amos which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem does that mean that the Messiah was just to them no it doesn't so I just those are just a couple of things that got to see now I've got to I've got to be grounded and settled looking not just at at what they're saying because these are foolish questions I had nothing good to show for my year and a half I was just being being exhausted looking at different YouTube film clips that was gradually going to be taking certainty away from every single area of faith I said I'm going to go back to what do I believe what do I believe and ground you look okay I believe yes I believe the Bible is God's word we're going to start there I believe I'm a sinner go on go on then I believe yeah baptism in Jesus's name that's there black and white you really can't I can't swallow a trinitarian god before long you start God started putting all the structure back in place and I left that time of questioning with a stronger Foundation than I had when I went into it but I can remember remember the how how important the narrative is I remember going through that time I thought man and you could see on this particular web page is are the names of all these former leaders of the message you've already left the message and you got this list list list list man goodness Lord I've got the virus too and there's only one way this story pans out once you've got it there's only one way and I'm on it seems like I'm on the way out but that's not the case the devil might tell you this is your narrative you're having these thoughts that means that you are this that's not the case at all you can be struggling with one thing or another but that doesn't that that does not determine who you are or where you're going to be go back and seek God cuz he will tell you who you are where you are and where you need to go those are some examples of foolish questions on kind of a a doctrinal level if I could call it that but um we kind of head on the home stretch I want to take a few minutes to talk about foolish questions that can also be on a personal level ah this is a didn't forgot this 2 Timothy 3:7 talk about people ever learning never able to come to the knowledge of the truth this is somebody who's asking questions learning one opinion another opinion another opin opinion they've heard lots of opinions they can explain all the narratives that are out there but the truth they don't have that and I don't care so much about explaining all the different narratives you care about one thing there's one pearl of great price you want to have the truth that's the most important thing but there are also foolish questions on a personal level I alluded to one just now there when I was at the uh at the end of a church service didn't understand a single thing and then you kind of leave the the idea of man you don't understand truth do you have a receiver of Truth could you be a Son of God and how the devil's putting those questions in your mind and leading you down a certain way of thinking when um we have to exercise discernment with questions the devil asks us during our trials and we might is the devil ask me this question or is it my question I don't care every question that comes up we want to go back and see is God in the question or not because a foolish question will be removing God we'll try to be removing God from our narrative but brother Bram talks about a time in his life he says that was the greatest trial that he'd ever faced and that was when his uh his wife had just passed away and his little baby Sharon Rose was uh was there in the uh there in another room in the basement she was just laid out with like a mosquito net over her and it says um this was the hardest Temptation I ever met in my life just about 25 years old his wife had just passed away and Billy Paul laying at the point of death he says I opened the door he wants to go visit his daughter no nurse was there he slips down into the basement and that was where the hospital was fixed up no screens on the Windows hardly flies on their little eyes their little piece of mosquito bar we call it netting put over her face and I shoed the Flies off laid there her little eyes she suffered so hard till they were crossing and he says then Satan moved up by the side of me there and said did you say he was a good God yeah I said that did you say he was a Healer well why did your father Die In Your Arms over there and you were calling calling and he's a sinner you were calling for his life why did your brother die in your other brother's arms out there and you standing in the Pulpit preaching a few weeks ago all the devil's doing is asking questions asking questions but can you see the devil's not really just asking a question he is suggesting something he's not going out and saying God doesn't love you God doesn't care for you he's not saying that he's just asking the question inviting brother random to go along this particular uh route of thinking he says then why didn't he answer you you said he loved you and saved you he couldn't tell me there was no God I'd already seen him but he was telling me he didn't care for me the devil told us that before if we had that question for man why I've been why am I still in this situation nothing seem to be changing my life does God even care about me that that that can hurt inside very very bad brother brandom had that but now your own wife there she is dead second day now and your little boy at the point of death Billy Paul just 18 months old your little girl at 8 months old she's lying here dying with men in gidis and you just prayed and God pulled a sheet down and said shut up doesn't hear he won't hear you at all he's turned his back on you he's a good god huh he loves you huh all he's doing is asking questions and then brother brandom says everything he was telling me was the truth in the sense that everything the devil told him had happened it was factual but that's a difference facts are not truth the devil had thrown all the kinds of facts that brother brandom could not dispute all these facts did this happen yes did it happen yes did this happen yes did this happen and then the devil puts an interpretation to it and that was not true so facts are not truth and how often can that happen in our own lives where the devil tries to give us a narrative and so many events in the narrative can be factual and then he tries to put a spin on it that is not true at all and here's where we have to exercise discernment and bring every thought to The Obedience of Christ put Christ back into our story that's very important now most of the time we think that the problem problems that we have on our lives the way the situations that we're we're struggling with right now we look back why am I finding myself in this circumstance why am I here we go back and look ah it's because this happened to me when I was a kid that teacher he really messed me up with that class or this Uncle did this or we we go back and look at the thing that we say caused our problem so adversity we think the adversity is what brings the consequence directly to us we often think that events determine the consequences that we suffer but like every kindergarten will tell you you never go from a to c there's always one thing in between and that is a be the belief and this is the belief is like the narrative the belief that we adopt regarding our adversity there's something that comes between the difficulty we had and the situation we find yourself in now and and that is the belief that we adopt the narrative and a good true belief or a good true narrative will make you strong but bad and false beliefs are poison that slowly kill you and we have a choice what belief are we going to adopt about our situation because it's not everybody who grew up in a broken home ends up a drug addict not everybody who had the problem X happened to them ends up with consequence y there are lots of things that happen in between and the most important thing is what is the what is the belief that we adopt about it I can remember my my uh my my grandmother my dad's mom she uh she her um my my dad's younger brother he passed away in a tragic hunting accident when he was just like 15 years old or so like a year after that um my my grandma and grandpa they got divorced and it was a terrible time and a lot of people have that kind of adversity end up really really bad but that was a time that where my grandma she came to Faith and I I found her devotion book and she happiness is a choice Joy is a choice and you can see God you finally can you find God in your circumstance but here's what they um here's what people have read about this false beliefs are poison that slow they kill you when we accept these false beliefs to our questions about our trials and suffering our suffering multiplies exponentially on an emotional level and doctors acknowledge that emotional pain can be the worst kind of personal suffering so it's not just somebody's sick in the hospital not well but when they think oh my family doesn't care about me God doesn't care about me that thought God doesn't care about me that causes even more pain than actual physical pain symptoms that you might have and a lot of physical pain can be rooted in internal emotional factors he says between 75 and 90% of all illnesses can be traced back to our body's response to stress and this author says the majority of emotional pain arises from mistaken or irrational beliefs that we hold regarding to what happens to us by taking a wrong narrative that the devil gives to us like I was there at the end of that church service thinking God I I didn't get a thing about it I must not even have a receiver from truth am I even a child of God then the pain starts on the inside the pain and if you were to continue to go along that way you get yourself anxious into depression all kind of things just snowballing all because you adopted the devil's thought it's so important to be like the Children of isachar Men of understanding who know the times we live in who look for the exclamation points of Truth follow those Embrace those have discernments for what kinds of questions that we have I want to show us one thing and then will'll be closed how important it is with what we identify with and we want to queue up that little video clip if we could I want to show a short video clip from uh uh service that brother Brandon preached in Chicago and how important it is to take every thought and how easy it is those thoughts that we get if we identify with those thoughts and their wrong thoughts the the the power it has to do great great harm and then what we do with those thoughts we could just pull that video clip Up and then we'll uh we'll finish up from there now we are be strangers I see that you are strictly stranger to me you're from away from here you come from another city You' got a lot of trouble on your heart you got hard trouble to begin with is that right there's a whole black I see a black sheep keep following me like that or aive and that was a man confess I need he said you a wi is that true and you got a your church or something your p got F that right don't pay people tell you and the only your [Music] heart stop right there what was it that was causing that lady's trouble she believed the devil's lie and what kind of Lies is the devil trying to tell about us today musicians can come with Paul and ready what kind of Lies is the devil trying to tell us about today if we identify with those lies she started to identify with this lie am I a witch am I a witch and her that was driving her body nuts her heart trouble anxiety all these different things what kinds of Li the devil could we be identifying with today don't believe them put those to the side don't believe your own don't believe your feelings about yourself believe God's word about yourself that's how we handle foolish questions that's how we handle these things take them to God is God in this question or not if he's not I don't want to have any part of it I don't want to believe the devil's thought about me that make sense just let's pray heavenly father I thank you for your goodness and your grace to us Lord I Thank you for this Lord the small scripture from the book of Chronicles about the men of isachar such unique men Lord they seem not to offer very much just 200 men not noted for their uh battle worthiness or their swords or their Spears or their Shields but uh it's more important to be on the right side than how we're equipped Lord they were equipped in a special way though they had that discernment able to discern the spirit of the time that they lived in that they would know how to live in that age I pray Lord you would help us also give us good discernment to know what are the conditions the time that we're living in so that we could live for you today Lord I pray that you would be with each young person whatever questions they might be wrestling with whatever they might be working through Lord I pray that you would be with them come alongside them and lead them I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you thank you brother I appreciate that turn his mic off we're going to sing I really enjoyed the word really enjoyed the word this morning and um I believe that there's an army rising up amongst the young people I believe there's a new generation that are that children of issachar and they're not gullible they're not just swallowing everything that they read They're not taking all the devil's foolish questions and being troubled by it but they're they're seeking truth and they're willing to wait till God lands a revelation in their heart and there's an army rising up that way and you don't want to be a part of generation of young people sitting even in a message church and and uh just being led by lust or something or forming a marriage based upon lust you don't want that there's a young people that say no I don't I don't want that the rest of the world has that I want my marriage and my future and everything to be based upon the truth of God's word or revelation of God's word and I don't want to be numb and and numbed in my mind so much that I'm not open to receiving because that's what all the world's knowledge and questions out there that's what it makes us just makes us numb to really finding truth but there is a children of isachar that's seeking and living understanding their times navigating through it through the revelation of the word he's given us and put in our hearts we're going to make it through he wouldn't have said in Leota to him that overcometh unless he'd have some Overcomers to this leoan age and I believe uh we're speaking to a lot of that generation here this morning brother brem says each generation has its own Revival in the word of God and uh so I believe that God if you notice a lady that's always been a important part of that video that that rap show that part was so important when he she was told that and we would say it was by the devil but remember it came through a healing evangelist that actually told her that and that can be more troubling sometimes because it comes through a source that comes out of the church and so that's how much in this deceiving age we have to navigate and get to the truth because sometimes lies can come through a lot of different sources and we have to seek is this truth and I love it as how he prays for her he just lays his hands on her and just sends her off and if you kept it got kind of loud with the Clapping of the audience but he looks at her as she's going by and said you're not a witch must have been comforting to hear the truth somebody said that about you but you're not a witch you're having nervous problems and you're having troubles but what the devil said about you is not true amen praise the Lord let's stand there's an army rising up I believe it with all my heart so remember now as we as we get finished here that we will um if you
