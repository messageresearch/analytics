[25:35] praise the Lord amen well you may be see
[25:39] the come on bring Harper up
[25:42] here Harper
[25:45] and
[25:49] [Music]
[25:56] Hatfield
[26:01] oh my
[26:03] beautiful
[26:06] beautiful I wanted to read this just one
[26:08] scripture here and I think it fits
[26:11] um it says in
[26:14] Ephesians chapter 3 and verse 20 unto
[26:19] unto him that is able to do
[26:23] exceedingly abundantly above all that we
[26:27] can ask or think according to the power
[26:32] that worketh in us and the reason I'm re
[26:35] reading that is I was thinking last
[26:36] night how that and I don't want to
[26:39] answer for You Phillip and I I don't
[26:41] want to answer for you either but it
[26:43] would seemed to me that in some ways
[26:45] maybe brother
[26:47] Phillip never thought that this would
[26:51] happen it happened this glorious in this
[26:54] way a wife great wife Godly wife and
[26:58] then and then this as a bonus and I just
[27:01] think probably there were times I didn't
[27:04] counsel with you talk to you too much
[27:05] but there were times probably you didn't
[27:07] really you might lost hope that it could
[27:09] be this good but you're serving a God
[27:12] that can do exceedingly and abundantly
[27:16] whatever we could pray or ask or think
[27:18] and we're thinking at a certain level
[27:19] God can blow that away and I just really
[27:22] believe for you and for Tabitha I think
[27:25] he's done that with your marriage and
[27:28] those who are a tad older don't give up
[27:32] God is able to do exceedingly
[27:35] abundantly can you say amen and so this
[27:38] is precious time this morning to be able
[27:40] to dedicate this Harper so only names
[27:44] meanings you guys might know something
[27:45] different but Harper is one who plays
[27:48] the harp right and that's beautiful
[27:50] that's wonderful because Kenny and I
[27:52] want to see an orchestra
[27:54] started and we realize nobody's coming
[27:57] around around to play some extra except
[27:59] our dear sister Grace playing the violin
[28:02] now she does a wonderful job do you
[28:04] enjoy her violin
[28:08] CL but we want a whole Orchestra we want
[28:11] to fill in the whole front and we
[28:13] realize nobody's stepping for where we
[28:15] can't find anybody so we're just going
[28:16] to start birthing
[28:19] them for the orchestra instruments start
[28:23] breeding no I don't want to say breeding
[28:25] them
[28:26] but so I don't know I'm not putting that
[28:28] on her that pressure but her name is
[28:31] Harper so start the lessons right
[28:37] away Harper
[28:40] and
[28:43] Hatfield our Precious
[28:46] Jesus how wonderful this is Lord to see
[28:49] how you blessed brother
[28:52] philli and Lord the ups and downs
[28:54] through the years and serving you
[28:57] there's been been a faithfulness in our
[28:58] brother to hold on to the truths of the
[29:01] message of this last day and to hold on
[29:03] to
[29:04] you and then you prospered his business
[29:07] and you prospered many things in his
[29:09] life but just missing that counterpart
[29:12] that that
[29:14] helpmate and then Lord you send this
[29:16] gift to both of them this precious child
[29:20] so Lord they bring her today back to
[29:23] you we Place Harper back in your hands
[29:26] for your love love for your protection
[29:29] for your
[29:30] guidance for when you're not when when
[29:32] they're not around you would be around
[29:35] with her guardian angel to watch over
[29:37] her and when she comes of age I pray
[29:40] that you would put such a heart in her
[29:42] Lord to want to serve you and love you
[29:44] and may there not be a lot of hurdles
[29:46] and things Lord that she has to get
[29:49] over thankfully Lord she'll be raised in
[29:52] a home that has some respect and a lots
[29:54] of respect for the word of God and for
[29:57] for the token if what what and so if
[30:00] Harper would grow if you should T and
[30:02] she should grow into her young years and
[30:04] grow as an adult she'll have a good
[30:07] start Lord to be in the presence of God
[30:09] and to bring in a home that has your
[30:11] presence so bless her be with her Lord
[30:14] protect her and we give her back to you
[30:17] and ask that you bless her and put your
[30:18] anointing upon her and also upon philli
[30:21] and Tabitha that you would help them to
[30:24] be good parents Lord to watch over her
[30:28] and give her guidance that Lord when we
[30:31] don't know what to do in child wearing
[30:34] which many times we don't
[30:37] Lord and the only manual we have is the
[30:41] Bible which is really all we need but
[30:44] there are times Lord we just don't feel
[30:46] like we know what to do give them wisdom

[33:05] 5 and verse one for we know that if our
[33:10] Earthly House of this Tabernacle were
[33:12] disolved we have a building of God a
[33:15] house not made with hands Eternal in the
[33:18] heavens for in this we Gran earnestly
[33:22] Desiring to be clothed upon with our
[33:24] house which is from Heaven if so be
[33:27] being clothed we shall not be found

[33:34] word has been mentioned here groaning
[33:37] for we who are in this Tabernacle this
[33:39] body do groan being burdened not for
[33:42] that we would be unclothed but clothed
[33:45] upon that mortality might be swallowed

[35:19] Maddie here this morning visiting God
[35:20] bless you good to have you in our uh
[35:22] service this morning God bless
[35:25] you today I want to finish uh a series
[35:29] that we've been on on the Holy Ghost and
[35:32] uh I'm just trusting that some of the
[35:34] things we've broke down to the people
[35:35] through this series uh has been a
[35:38] blessing to you and uh it's been
[35:41] instructional it's been helpful for you
[35:43] to be able to understand just a little
[35:46] bit more of what this great truth is
[35:48] it's been a wonderful Journey for me to
[35:50] be able to take many of the Bible truths
[35:53] that's related to the subject of the
[35:55] Holy Ghost and to take those truths it's
[35:57] just been a great journey to take them
[35:59] piece by piece and to be able to
[36:01] understand a little better and there's
[36:03] something that I said in the first
[36:05] service in this series and that was that
[36:07] I I had a a a desire in my heart to be
[36:11] able to break this down so that we could
[36:14] take something that has become confusing
[36:17] to the people and we realize that if
[36:20] something like the Holy Ghost has become
[36:23] confusing then we know that's Satan's
[36:25] work
[36:28] say God is not the author of confusion
[36:31] but it's Satan that's the author of
[36:32] confusion and what greater subject that
[36:35] to take something so precious as an
[36:37] intimate connection with God that
[36:39] someone is filled changed transformed
[36:42] converted however you want to call it by
[36:44] the holy ghost in a new birth what
[36:46] greater subject what greater thing would
[36:49] Satan like to interrupt in your life and
[36:51] then after you have it what greater
[36:53] subject would Satan like to confuse you
[36:55] about make you you doubt that you have
[36:57] it can you say Amen it would be this
[36:59] subject but I want to say it again my
[37:02] desire was to bring it so that it's not
[37:04] confusing but it's expressed just the
[37:06] way it is in the scripture can you say
[37:08] amen and and and and to be able to
[37:10] preach it in a way uh that that your
[37:13] heart would so want it if you don't have
[37:15] it that that you would want it with all
[37:17] your heart and it would be a fool it
[37:18] would be a fool that would turn down the
[37:21] filling of the Holy
[37:23] Ghost that's the way that I wanted to
[37:26] preach it because uh it I it's something
[37:29] that we all uh not only just need but
[37:31] something we should crave for and ask
[37:34] God for it can you say Amen it's not
[37:37] something to be grieved but it's
[37:39] something to be received it's not
[37:42] something to be put off but it's
[37:44] something that must be a priority right
[37:47] now it's something so powerful to change
[37:50] you and to change your desires to bring
[37:53] the love of God and incidentally God
[37:55] gives you the Holy Ghost by a love for
[37:57] it and a passion for it by the love of
[37:59] God he doesn't give you something out of
[38:01] fear can you say Amen it's it's not
[38:04] about fear I better get this or I'm
[38:06] going to go to hell it's it's not that
[38:08] it's because you fall in love with God
[38:10] and he he he gave you his gift of the
[38:13] Holy Ghost and you say he's given me
[38:15] this I want it with all my
[38:17] heart that's the way we should look at
[38:19] it and Satan should never change that
[38:22] there's something so powerful in it and
[38:24] it's the love of God not out of fear but
[38:26] out of relationship that we would want
[38:28] it and so if you are uncertain that you
[38:31] will be in heaven today if you are
[38:34] uncertain that you will be in the
[38:36] Rapture and and you want the assurance
[38:39] that you will be in heaven and be in a
[38:41] Rapture then why are you not seeking the
[38:44] Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is the
[38:47] guarantee that you will be in a Rapture
[38:50] the Holy Ghost is the only
[38:53] guarantee that you will be in a rapture
[38:57] see I want the evidence of it I want the
[38:58] EV I want to know that I have it but
[39:00] what's the purpose you say if you want
[39:01] an Evidence and you want a guarantee
[39:04] having it in your soul is the guarantee
[39:06] that you will be a part of a
[39:09] Rapture praise the Lord last Sunday we
[39:13] uh we referred to 2 Corinthians chapter
[39:15] 5 because we were referring to the
[39:18] mystery of our Eternal bodies and that
[39:20] is our theophanies that would be the
[39:22] more technical word but uh the uh the
[39:26] Bible calls it here our Earthly House of
[39:28] this body and then the Heavenly Eternal
[39:30] house the body and maybe we didn't know
[39:33] that when we first come to Christianity
[39:35] but the Bible plainly states here we're
[39:37] in our Earthly house now but we have
[39:40] another body in the other dimension just
[39:42] real close to us if we are Christians
[39:44] and we are in his mind before the
[39:46] foundation of the world we already have
[39:48] an eternal body in the other dimension
[39:50] how many believe that and that's not
[39:52] some new weird idea Paul just said if
[39:54] this Earthly Tabernacle is dissolved for
[39:57] Christians we have a body already
[39:59] waiting for us that will take up it's an
[40:01] eternal body it's a word body it loves
[40:04] the word it never gets sick it never
[40:06] gets a migraine headache it never has
[40:09] any trouble it agrees with the word of
[40:11] God because it's a perfect word body the
[40:14] body that you're in now is not that way
[40:16] but the Christians get a new
[40:20] body praise be to God and so we were
[40:23] under the mystery of MDC in the book of
[40:25] hrew Hebrews under the mystery of mzc we
[40:29] find this truth of the theophany bodies
[40:31] that Jesus had a theophany body or else
[40:34] who was MDC who had no beginning of days
[40:37] nor ending of life it had to be Jesus
[40:39] Christ and he's still alive today can
[40:41] you say man he was in a theophany body
[40:44] and came into a flesh body there to talk
[40:47] and commune with our Father Abraham this
[40:50] mystery explains the mystery of our life
[40:53] The Secret Of Our Lives because we're
[40:55] dropping down here in a moment of time
[40:58] but we came from from somewhere and
[41:00] we're headed somewhere we're only here
[41:02] temporarily to live in these bodies but
[41:06] we we can say the same thing that Jesus
[41:09] day did I come from God I'm here in this
[41:13] Human Experience but I'm going right
[41:15] back to God
[41:18] again this Christian life isn't just for
[41:21] here there's a destination to this thing
[41:24] there's a place the Holy Ghost is in us
[41:28] someday and so I thought the last part
[41:31] of the Holy Ghost we should talk about
[41:34] where it's taking us and incidentally
[41:36] not just in this life in maturity but
[41:39] where it's taken us into the other
[41:41] dimension and there's only one p there's
[41:43] only one ticket that you have to hold in
[41:46] your heart to make it into that other
[41:48] dimension and that's the Holy
[41:51] Ghost pretty important young people it's
[41:54] pretty important it's more important
[41:56] than your career it's more important
[41:57] than who you marry it's more important
[41:59] than your job more important than your
[42:01] your what's on your
[42:04] phone more important than in some crazy
[42:07] latest movie or crazy latest song this
[42:10] is the priority of your life that I know
[42:13] that I know that I know that I have the
[42:15] Holy
[42:16] Ghost I have this in my heart and I'm
[42:18] ready to
[42:20] go and only you can pray that prayer to
[42:22] God only you can receive it I can't give
[42:24] you that I can preach it to you I can I
[42:27] can love you but you have to ask God and
[42:30] anyone who asks I believe that they will
[42:34] receive one of the points I don't want
[42:36] to miss out of this text first before I
[42:37] jump on to the rest of it and that is
[42:39] that this thing if this if this life is
[42:42] in US of the Holy Ghost we groan he uses
[42:45] the word twice we groan within ourselves
[42:49] now that's that's not a great sales
[42:52] pitch to The Holy Ghost to tell you when
[42:54] you're going to get this there's going
[42:56] to be some groaning and he uses the word
[42:58] we are oppressed or we are burdened with
[43:02] carrying this life that's not a great
[43:04] sale uh to try to sell it on but I can
[43:06] tell you there's a groaning that goes
[43:08] with it because he said here we if you
[43:10] have this life in these bodies you're
[43:13] groaning about something you're it
[43:16] brings a groaning now we know that it
[43:18] brings Deliverance it brings a change of
[43:20] nature we've preached on it brings an
[43:23] amen or to the word of God that if you
[43:25] have the Holy Ghost you'll never deny
[43:27] this word not not one book of this Bible
[43:30] not one scripture of this Bible and the
[43:32] message that restored this Bible you say
[43:35] well how do I know that I have it it's
[43:36] not a feeling it's not a sensation it's
[43:39] not an emotion because you felt good at
[43:41] Camp it's that you've got the amener on
[43:43] the inside that when God brings his word
[43:46] something down here says amen every
[43:49] time you can't even live this Christian
[43:52] Life without the Holy Ghost to say Amen
[43:55] to the word of God
[43:58] we've talked about the evidence we've
[44:00] talked about the blessings of the Holy
[44:02] Ghost that go with it and and we we
[44:04] talked about the change of nature but I
[44:06] I if you think this Christian life is
[44:09] all peaches and
[44:11] blessing and good and shouting all the
[44:14] time and
[44:15] dancing then you need to listen to
[44:17] Wednesday night
[44:20] service and some of you didn't because I
[44:22] can tell by your response and I'm not
[44:24] pushing but God brought something very
[44:26] unique to us on a little Wednesday night
[44:28] here that this experience will have
[44:31] times that God is dealing you with you
[44:34] with his left hand and not his right and
[44:37] when he deals with it his with his right
[44:40] hand you know that he's dealing with you
[44:43] and it's great and he shows his power
[44:46] but when he's dealing with you with his
[44:47] left hand which he was job there was no
[44:50] answers God had gone silent and you
[44:52] don't have a clue what's going on but
[44:54] that's when you need to trust God's
[44:56] still
[44:57] working a brother told me in the
[44:59] bathroom this morning that's actually
[45:00] where we get the real growth in
[45:02] Christianity it's when God's dealing
[45:03] with this with a left hand he told me
[45:05] that in the bathroom this
[45:09] morning should listen to Wednesday night
[45:11] because this Christian life is not all
[45:13] peaches and
[45:15] blessing there's a groaning and but you
[45:18] see now the groaning isn't a negative
[45:20] thing it's not just worldly oppression
[45:22] and depression that we feel because of
[45:24] the de demonic spirits that we fight in
[45:27] our mind every day we are we are this
[45:29] the atmospheres are saturated with
[45:33] depressing uh
[45:36] Devils all the time especially for
[45:39] Christians depressing oppression and so
[45:42] we're we're I'm not talking about that
[45:44] type of groaning or oppression or burden
[45:46] I'm talking about these bodies that are
[45:50] that are sin born they become Born Again
[45:52] In the soul but when you put another
[45:55] life in these bodies you are going to
[45:58] experience a groaning and the groaning
[46:00] is is that this really isn't the final
[46:03] body to put that life
[46:06] in so there are certain elements to it
[46:09] that just don't fit this
[46:11] body it doesn't match it doesn't go
[46:14] together we're talking about the very
[46:16] life eternal life placed in a human body
[46:20] and that's not going to always go
[46:22] together so well the only thing that it
[46:24] will do is be powerful enough as you
[46:27] yield to the spirit to bring this body
[46:30] under subjection to God but it'll never
[46:33] be born again it'll never make the
[46:35] Rapture it'll never go anywhere else
[46:37] it's sinb born can you say Amen but you
[46:40] put the very life of God that created
[46:43] the world in this
[46:47] body you're going to be groaning a
[46:50] little bit and sometimes you're
[46:51] wondering what in the world's going on
[46:52] with me I just feel a pull I feel a pull
[46:56] that's why I can sing Brother Paul's
[46:57] song I Feel the pull because I don't
[46:59] know what's going on but I I I feel
[47:01] drawn to something else I feel pulled
[47:04] towards God I feel this is not the end
[47:07] there's more to
[47:08] this it's because God put his own life
[47:11] inside of you and this body is never
[47:13] going to fully
[47:15] agree it's not going to fit well because
[47:19] this is not the body was intended to be
[47:21] in well it was in God's plan but it's
[47:23] not the final end it's not the final end
[47:25] so these groanings reminds me of a a
[47:28] woman that's
[47:31] pregnant and I'm not an expert at
[47:36] this but I I live with my wife during
[47:38] these times and I watch women who become
[47:41] pregnant and there's there's such Joy
[47:44] with it there's such great expectation
[47:48] to it uh what could this be am I going
[47:51] to have a boy or a girl and then
[47:53] sometimes you can go find out that kind
[47:55] of kills feels it because you already
[47:56] know what you're getting but there's
[47:58] still expecting now I'm going to get a
[47:59] boy or I'm going to get a girl wow now I
[48:02] can know how to uh decorate the room and
[48:03] so there's this there's these feelings
[48:06] of expectation that come inside a woman
[48:08] that's pregnant and the whole family and
[48:10] even dad but especially for the woman
[48:12] who's carrying this other life within
[48:13] her that's Joy it's great expectation of
[48:16] what's going to come in nine months or
[48:18] eight months or sometimes 10 months so
[48:20] you know it just it never you never know
[48:22] but but then you're going to have
[48:24] feelings come with that that's inside
[48:25] you it's going to kick that baby's going
[48:27] to kick sometimes and Fe for a woman to
[48:29] feel that kick that's a joy that's
[48:32] that's wonderful it's there it's
[48:35] alive there's some other uh something
[48:38] another life growing inside me and I
[48:40] feel it kicking against my tummy I mean
[48:42] my wife she had a lot of kicking I mean
[48:44] we we have some basketball players my
[48:46] boys are basketball players and I think
[48:47] they were already playing
[48:50] basketball and so you know we have all
[48:54] this goes go that goes with it but also
[48:57] for a woman there's a groaning there's
[49:01] pain and as she gets
[49:04] closer could be more
[49:06] pain how many sisters say Amen that
[49:09] happens more groans you're you're
[49:12] becoming more uncomfortable so now that
[49:15] doesn't sell well either for you know
[49:17] I'm staying away from this I'm not doing
[49:19] it because I've heard women talk about
[49:20] what it gets to at the end and the final
[49:23] birth pains and the final in the
[49:25] hospital it's going to happen and uh so
[49:27] you can talk to the sisters I mean this
[49:29] gets it gets to be more birth pains as
[49:32] it gets closer to this life cutting the
[49:36] umbilical cord and this life that's not
[49:39] supposed to stay in that woman's body
[49:41] but to take on a life it's of its own
[49:44] there's a lot of groaning there's a lot
[49:46] of pain just before that happens I
[49:49] wonder this morning if that's what
[49:51] Christians feel especially in these La I
[49:54] wonder how close we are to the Rapture I
[49:57] wonder with all the pain that we're
[49:59] feeling all the struggles all the trials
[50:01] in the last year for our family it's
[50:04] been a very very rough time we're not
[50:06] going anywhere we're we're we're dead
[50:09] more dedicated to the Lord than we ever
[50:11] have but we've had a little bit of the
[50:12] left hand of God where you don't
[50:14] understand what God is doing but I can
[50:16] tell you there's groaning there's pain
[50:18] there's things that we don't understand
[50:20] I wonder if we're how many would raise
[50:22] your hand and say I'm feeling that more
[50:23] than I ever I wonder if we're close to
[50:26] the
[50:27] Rapture I wonder if this life is growing
[50:30] inside of us and we're really close for
[50:33] the
[50:33] change cuz that's what a woman comes to
[50:36] when she comes to that and you've heard
[50:38] me mention it before all the Cravings
[50:40] that go with it some babies they crave
[50:42] this some there's Cravings that go that
[50:45] aren't your normal
[50:47] Cravings you crave this you crave that
[50:49] but when you got a it's because you have
[50:50] another life inside of you and they
[50:53] maybe don't crave the same things you
[50:55] crave but you're feeling those Cravings
[50:57] you got the Holy Ghost inside of you
[51:00] you're going to Crave the things of God
[51:03] where before the Holy Ghost you didn't
[51:05] crave
[51:07] them you're going to be craved to be fed
[51:09] by the word of God you're want to you're
[51:11] going to want to be where the the the
[51:13] word is being preached can you say Amen
[51:15] it's not a duty it's not some ritual
[51:18] it's not a Catholic idea there's the
[51:20] Holy Ghost Inside saying I've got to be
[51:22] fed there's something in me I've heard
[51:25] my from my theophany something's craving
[51:27] to be in church today to hear the word
[51:29] of
[51:32] God she had cravings for green beans she
[51:35] had craving one of my my wife's Childs
[51:37] for seafood it was Seafood constantly
[51:40] every week we were at Red Lobster we
[51:42] were at home it was Seafood but as I've
[51:44] mentioned to you one of my kid I don't
[51:46] know which one of my kids but it was she
[51:48] craved hot fudge cake from Big
[51:52] Boy and that was great
[51:56] brother Chris that was great cuz soon as
[51:59] she would Express that craving I'd start
[52:02] the car we were headed a big
[52:04] boy and she couldn't finish all of it so
[52:08] I had to do my duty to finish the rest
[52:10] of the hot fres
[52:12] cake could it be that we're hitting more
[52:15] pain more family issues yeah because
[52:19] we're closer to something taking place
[52:21] than what we
[52:22] realize there's a groaning that goes
[52:24] with this spirit and maybe that's why we
[52:26] increase in pain getting closer you know
[52:28] the world is getting ready for its third
[52:30] birth pain it had one world war had the
[52:34] second war war those were birth pains as
[52:36] far as this world it's getting ready to
[52:38] have its third one it can't survive
[52:39] another one this Earth has to break into
[52:42] another Millennium another life another
[52:44] God purging this Earth we can't survive
[52:47] another third world war it's coming even
[52:49] Trump says it's coming we're very close
[52:51] to it but I don't know we can't survive
[52:53] it why because we're closer to a new
[52:55] world breaking forth and so maybe that's
[52:58] why the pain is increased to bring us
[53:01] into that new world but also for us who
[53:03] are groaning in the spirit what is what
[53:05] is groaning mentioned for because the
[53:08] same reason that a woman groans another
[53:11] life is in you that life was never meant
[53:13] to stay in these bodies it will keep
[53:15] growing to break into another body so we
[53:18] grow it means that the Holy Ghost will
[53:21] never perfectly fit this imperfect body
[53:25] so that's why we have
[53:27] groanings why you feel the pull of
[53:30] something it's pulling you it's drawing
[53:32] you thus we Gran within
[53:38] ourselves it's actually a good
[53:41] thing so then uh Paul mentions here that
[53:45] this life is in within us is called the
[53:49] earnest it's mentioned that way about
[53:51] three places in scripture also in the
[53:53] book of Ephesians it's the earnest which
[53:55] which we see described it's pretty
[53:57] simple to describe what the earnest is
[53:58] when you receive the Holy Ghost you
[54:00] receive the earnest which is not all of
[54:01] it you receive the down payment and when
[54:05] you have a down payment of something
[54:08] then it's already yours you just don't
[54:10] have the rest of it yet but it's been
[54:12] paid for can you say Amen the Bible
[54:14] calls the Holy Ghost the earnest the
[54:16] down payment so God puts a down payment
[54:19] of his spirit in these bodies it is the
[54:22] down payment it's as good as done the
[54:24] it's already purchase so a down payment
[54:26] of course is the evidence and the
[54:28] security that we will get the rest this
[54:31] is just a portion that we have and oh
[54:34] this morning we've come and worshiped
[54:36] the the the we've worshiped the Lord
[54:38] with all of our heart and the spirit of
[54:39] the Lord comes down and how many's
[54:41] enjoyed the worship this morning
[54:42] expressing oursel to God and the
[54:44] musicians and everybody expressing
[54:46] themselves if it's this good with just
[54:49] the down payment how much is it going to
[54:51] be when we get to the other
[54:54] side I'm enjoying this but I can't wait
[54:56] till we get to the other side but it's a
[54:59] down payment brother Ram says we are pre
[55:01] predestinated with the lamb Revelations
[55:03] chapter 5 we are predestinated with the
[55:06] lamb the holy spirit is our seal the
[55:09] earnest means more is yet to come I love
[55:12] that the earnest the down pay payment
[55:14] means more is yet to come there's more
[55:17] to come you're not done when he fills
[55:19] you with the Holy Spirit there's more to
[55:22] come he says the earnest is just the
[55:24] down payment oh how beautiful just the
[55:26] down payment that holds it and secures
[55:28] it and anchors it so that no one else
[55:32] can touch it Satan cannot get a hold of
[55:35] a man or a woman that's been birthed by
[55:37] the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is
[55:39] sealed in his soul and the devil has
[55:41] been sealed out and we are sealed not
[55:44] till the next Revival we're sealed until
[55:47] the day of redemption with this down
[55:50] payment it's a
[55:52] ceiling it anchors it it holds holds it
[55:55] this down payment even holds it it
[55:57] anchors it can you say Amen it it is
[56:00] there's nothing else can touch it it's
[56:01] the earnest of our adoption the holy
[56:03] spirit is now the earnest of God in our
[56:05] heart sealed the adoption of sons
[56:08] awaiting us at the end of the road Sons
[56:11] and Daughters of God so now in redeeming
[56:13] something we know that when there's
[56:15] something to be redeemed it was yours
[56:18] and then it got lost some something took
[56:20] it away from you then it has to be
[56:22] redeemed and when you go to redeem it
[56:24] back there has to be a price with that
[56:25] Redemption you have to pay something our
[56:28] lamb Jesus Christ paid the full price to
[56:31] redeem what he had lost he lost us and
[56:34] we lost our
[56:36] inheritance and our lamb Jesus Christ
[56:39] went to Calvary and at Calvary he paid
[56:43] the price in
[56:47] full so it's already yours every every
[56:50] bit of redemption to redeem you to
[56:53] redeem Sons and Daughters of God to
[56:55] redeem this Earth everything was paid
[56:57] for at Calvary he paid the full price
[57:01] with his sacrifice at Calvary how many
[57:03] believe that this
[57:04] morning so he redeemed it back but you
[57:07] see now there's a difference in
[57:09] redeeming and paying something and
[57:12] claiming what's yours because you may
[57:14] have paid the price but you haven't come
[57:16] to claim it yet there's a there's a
[57:18] claiming time and so our inheritance is
[57:21] getting back what we lost in the Garden
[57:23] of Eden we are are his and the position
[57:26] as the son is ours and he buys it back
[57:29] but because is everybody listening now
[57:32] because there will be a season as we
[57:35] said last Sunday we bypassed our
[57:37] theophany and came right to the flesh to
[57:38] be tempted Jesus didn't bypasses
[57:41] theophany he came from word from thought
[57:43] of God to to from thought of God to word
[57:47] theophany and then to a flesh body to
[57:49] redeem us we come another way we came
[57:51] from the thought of God straight to
[57:53] these bodies to be tested and then we go
[57:56] back to a theophany body that's all
[57:57] scriptural can you say Amen so now that
[58:00] that he he buys it back but because that
[58:03] we are in a season where will be in this
[58:06] Human Experience this flesh because
[58:09] there's a season for that God says I
[58:12] will give a portion of my blood I will
[58:16] give a down payment the price he paid
[58:19] was blood how many knows the price he
[58:21] paid was blood how many knows I'm
[58:23] bringing you along now the price that he
[58:25] paid was blood for our
[58:28] Redemption how many knows that blood has
[58:31] life in
[58:32] it has his life in it so God says
[58:36] because they're going to have to walk in
[58:38] a season and actually it'll be another
[58:40] 2,000 years of human beings coming on
[58:42] the face of the Earth and living Sons
[58:44] living in a human experience God says
[58:47] I'm going to take a portion of my blood
[58:49] I'm going to take a portion of my spirit
[58:52] a down payment and I'm going to put it
[58:54] in those Earthly bodies another
[58:58] scripture says we have this treasure in
[59:01] Earth and
[59:03] vessels he said because they're still in
[59:06] the flesh and there's going to be a
[59:07] season for this Human Experience I'll go
[59:10] ahead and put a portion or a down
[59:13] payment of my blood my spirit I'll put
[59:17] it in that Earthly experience I'll make
[59:21] a down payment but the truth is when he
[59:23] makes the down payment he has every
[59:25] intention of finishing the
[59:29] work Hallelujah he put a portion of his
[59:33] blood inness not all of it yet not the
[59:35] full payment yet he's paid it all but to
[59:37] redeem us back to it all he puts a down
[59:40] payment within us so uh the man of God
[59:43] goes on to say here and who is this mzc
[59:45] which we were reading from last Sunday
[59:46] and then when you become subject to that
[59:49] Spirit it throws your whole being
[59:52] subject to that spirit I love that this
[59:55] is not a watered down Holy Ghost where
[59:57] you have no power in your life it's so
[1:00:00] powerful that when it comes in a human
[1:00:02] body it throws the whole body subject to
[1:00:06] the
[1:00:07] spirit now it doesn't make your body
[1:00:10] perfect I don't believe in preaching the
[1:00:12] Holy Ghost makes us perfect we can't be
[1:00:15] perfect in these
[1:00:16] bodies did anybody forget
[1:00:18] that no we can't be perfect in these
[1:00:21] bodies we're not going to think perfect
[1:00:24] thoughts every day but something comes
[1:00:27] in us that has the power over sin we
[1:00:30] cannot preach the Holy Ghost one night
[1:00:32] at an altar and you've reached
[1:00:34] Perfection you're never going to
[1:00:35] misbehave again we can't preach it that
[1:00:37] way you can't preach the holy ghost that
[1:00:39] way for human bodies but you can preach
[1:00:42] that it's so powerful that if you'll
[1:00:44] yield yourself the whole body becomes
[1:00:47] subject to the
[1:00:50] spirit and that spirit is nothing in the
[1:00:53] world but this seed word made manifest
[1:00:55] are quickened Hallelujah Made Alive and
[1:00:57] when the Bible said don't do this that
[1:00:59] body quickly turns to it there's no
[1:01:01] question and what is it it's the earnest
[1:01:03] of the Resurrection this body will be
[1:01:06] raised up again because it's already
[1:01:08] started the power of the re Resurrection
[1:01:12] is the Holy Ghost the same holy ghost
[1:01:14] that raised Christ out of the Tomb and
[1:01:18] he says I'll take a portion of that
[1:01:19] resurrection power somebody ought to be
[1:01:22] shouting this morning I'll take a
[1:01:24] portion of that resurrection power and
[1:01:26] I'll place a portion of it in human
[1:01:28] beings you don't think you're going to
[1:01:30] start to overcome things you don't think
[1:01:32] you're going to resurrect in this body a
[1:01:33] little bit you don't think you're going
[1:01:35] to come out of your smoking and your
[1:01:37] habits and your your sexual addictions
[1:01:39] and you don't think that poers no it's
[1:01:42] going to bring this body under
[1:01:46] subjection because it's not you and in
[1:01:49] reformation and you shook the preacher's
[1:01:51] hand it's the power of eternal life
[1:01:55] working in you a sborn
[1:01:58] body it's amazing it's a mystery it's
[1:02:02] it's
[1:02:03] more can I say this respectfully because
[1:02:06] we're at Christmas time and they're
[1:02:07] celebrating the birth of Christ well
[1:02:09] that was a sin born B that was a a body
[1:02:12] not born in sin pure Mary didn't have
[1:02:15] anything to do with it except incubator
[1:02:17] Joseph didn't have any this was a this
[1:02:20] is a gene seed of God this is a direct
[1:02:22] so but look at the power in Jesus life
[1:02:24] look what it did in his 33 years here
[1:02:27] but he was not he was he wasn't born in
[1:02:29] sin what's more glorious to take the
[1:02:32] power of God and put it in your sinb
[1:02:34] porn body that it actually would come
[1:02:37] under subjection to the word who gets
[1:02:40] what gets more
[1:02:44] Glory what gives Satan frustrations
[1:02:48] more like he felt today brother Chris
[1:02:52] when he thought when he put Jesus in the
[1:02:54] the tomb I've taken care of this man
[1:02:57] it's over and in the upper room 120
[1:02:59] little jesuses pop up and he goes now
[1:03:02] I've got to deal with
[1:03:03] 120 within days there were thousands
[1:03:06] that received the Holy Ghost now I got
[1:03:09] to deal with thousands of The Same
[1:03:11] Spirit living in them glory be to God
[1:03:14] it's his spirit it's not a Reformation
[1:03:18] it's the very Spirit of Jesus
[1:03:20] Christ you don't think it has the power
[1:03:22] in your life to overcome habits and
[1:03:24] addictions and drugs and everything else
[1:03:27] it has the power for you to
[1:03:30] [Applause]
[1:03:33] overcome oh I want it more than I ever
[1:03:35] wanted in my life he said when the Bible
[1:03:38] says he said it was once subject to sin
[1:03:40] and mire and Corruption but now it's got
[1:03:42] the earnest the down payment it's turned
[1:03:44] Heavenly can you imagine a human body
[1:03:47] sin born turns which direction turns
[1:03:50] Heavenly even though it may it won't
[1:03:52] make Heaven it turns s
[1:03:55] Heavenly I love that now that's the
[1:03:57] earnest that you're going in the
[1:04:00] Rapture that's the Assurance you're
[1:04:02] going in a Rapture when you see it's
[1:04:04] working in you in power that's the
[1:04:09] evidence now I pray that this will bring
[1:04:12] stability to the Sons and Daughters of
[1:04:14] God because there's so much instability
[1:04:17] today the devil wants to get you up and
[1:04:19] wondering from one Camp to the next
[1:04:21] whether you're saved whether you have
[1:04:22] the Holy Ghost and you got to go back
[1:04:24] the camp every year and get the Holy
[1:04:25] Ghost again I pray that I can be a
[1:04:27] pastor that preaches stability to the
[1:04:29] people get this spirit of God in your
[1:04:31] life and let it stabilize to Anchor to
[1:04:34] that if you see that power in your life
[1:04:36] that's the earnest that you are going in
[1:04:39] a
[1:04:40] Rapture what devil would tell a Believer
[1:04:43] I might miss the Rapture not if you have
[1:04:45] the down
[1:04:52] payment and a sick person Sharon a sick
[1:04:56] person laying dying nothing left but
[1:04:58] death that's all can happen I've seen
[1:05:00] Shadows of people done eat up with
[1:05:02] cancer and tuberculosis and see them
[1:05:05] persons a little while after that
[1:05:06] perfectly normal and
[1:05:12] strong if there is no Divine Healing
[1:05:15] then there is no
[1:05:16] Resurrection don't you dare believe in a
[1:05:19] resurrection someday in a Heaven someday
[1:05:21] unless you believe right here God heal
[1:05:25] [Applause]
[1:05:27] cancer cuz it's the down payment it's
[1:05:30] the down payment for it to help you
[1:05:31] overcome but it's the down payment and
[1:05:33] healing is one of the evidences when God
[1:05:35] heals in this way it's the evidence the
[1:05:38] resurrection is
[1:05:40] true because it's a portion of the
[1:05:42] resurrection power come on come on
[1:05:45] friends that that power that raised
[1:05:47] Jesus out of a grave that was a dead
[1:05:49] body for three days dead body if it can
[1:05:52] raise a dead body Sharon
[1:05:54] it can heal
[1:05:56] cancer it can heal any disease it can
[1:05:59] open up the blinded eyes it can raise
[1:06:03] the dead where has he done that come and
[1:06:05] talk to me I've got testimonies in the
[1:06:08] body of Christ around the world he still
[1:06:10] raises the
[1:06:12] dead you know what the earnest money is
[1:06:15] don't you it's the down payment can
[1:06:18] everybody say Amen it's the down payment
[1:06:21] two things here in this quote the
[1:06:22] evidence this por in us that we have
[1:06:25] this down payment it brings this sin
[1:06:27] body under subjection it's not perfect
[1:06:30] but it's subject to the word it
[1:06:31] experiences a mini Resurrection you
[1:06:34] experience a mini Resurrection in these
[1:06:35] bodies it never can be all of it it's
[1:06:38] sinb born but it's a resurrection power
[1:06:40] living within you and it turns Heavenly
[1:06:43] and that's the evidence you're going to
[1:06:45] be in the resurrection or be in a
[1:06:46] Rapture the second evidence is that the
[1:06:49] healing is the evidence the Rapture is
[1:06:51] going into a new body with no sickness
[1:06:53] but but the down payment in these bodies
[1:06:56] can heal these bodies and make them
[1:06:58] whole again why because this
[1:07:00] resurrection power has the power to take
[1:07:02] you to a new body if it has the power to
[1:07:05] take you to a new body it can heal these
[1:07:08] bodies the devil says no NOP it can't no
[1:07:12] no I've heard some I've heard some other
[1:07:14] reports where it didn't and yes we do
[1:07:17] but what about the thousands of others
[1:07:18] where it
[1:07:20] did and at the end of the day it's up to
[1:07:22] God based upon faith based on God God
[1:07:25] pulls our
[1:07:26] card right we don't really have power
[1:07:28] over that or we would be God so some
[1:07:31] some go some but you see now you can
[1:07:33] never do away with the power of
[1:07:35] Resurrection there's too many
[1:07:36] testimonies for thousands of years in
[1:07:38] the body in the Bible and also till
[1:07:40] today this very Sunday morning that we
[1:07:43] give God glory for that there's a
[1:07:45] evidence of the down payment in
[1:07:47] Believers and the down payment can heal
[1:07:50] these bodies and make them whole again
[1:07:53] no matter what the
[1:07:58] disease now the down payment think about
[1:08:02] it it's the security I'm not going to be
[1:08:04] very long today you still with
[1:08:06] me the down
[1:08:09] payment think about it it's it's it's
[1:08:12] the security that I will get the
[1:08:15] rest so if you young people or anyone
[1:08:18] for that matter you're going you see a
[1:08:19] car that you like you go see it and you
[1:08:23] like it and you have the money for it so
[1:08:26] you want to make sure that no one else
[1:08:29] gets it that it's yours so if you don't
[1:08:33] have all the cash on you then you say
[1:08:36] can I give you a down payment for the
[1:08:39] car can I give you maybe it's
[1:08:41] $2,500 and I'm going to give you $500 to
[1:08:45] hold it for me we do this a lot we're
[1:08:46] buying some somebody personally because
[1:08:48] we don't want somebody else to come and
[1:08:49] take it we'd like to have it we'd like
[1:08:51] to buy it I have the money I just don't
[1:08:52] have it with me but if I give give you
[1:08:54] $500 down and possibly some paperwork
[1:08:58] and a receipt of what I've given you for
[1:09:00] the 500 there is a time that you're
[1:09:03] going to show up later with the
[1:09:07] rest I'm preaching to
[1:09:09] you if the down payment is theirs then
[1:09:12] it's yours but there's a claiming time
[1:09:15] that you have to show up with the
[1:09:18] rest I'm waiting for God to show up with
[1:09:21] the
[1:09:22] rest
[1:09:24] can you say Amen my title this morning
[1:09:27] is a down payment towards all the rest
[1:09:29] I'm waiting for God to give me all the
[1:09:31] rest cuz I've got the down
[1:09:34] payment you say that say that person
[1:09:36] listen here's fire down and maybe some
[1:09:38] paperwork sometimes a handshake and you
[1:09:40] get a maybe you get a receipt and so you
[1:09:42] have ownership in that because you have
[1:09:46] it's as good as yours because you put a
[1:09:48] down payment on it can you say Amen but
[1:09:51] not all until you go pay the rest
[1:09:54] there's a time you show up with the rest
[1:09:57] there's a time to come and claim it with
[1:09:59] the rest of the money claim it and take
[1:10:02] it home with you there's a time that our
[1:10:05] lamb Christ comes to claim what's
[1:10:09] his he comes with Redemption claims
[1:10:12] 2,000 years ago he come with the
[1:10:14] Redemption price but 2,000 years he
[1:10:17] comes with Redemption claims he's making
[1:10:21] claims they are mine they're inheritance
[1:10:24] is theirs and I'm coming stepping forth
[1:10:26] as the lamb now because it's a different
[1:10:29] time for the lamb it's not the time of
[1:10:31] purchasing it's the time of finishing
[1:10:33] the purchase it's a time of claiming
[1:10:36] what is
[1:10:39] mine at the end time our lamb comes if
[1:10:42] you know your Bible our lamb comes in
[1:10:45] the end time after 2,000 years and he
[1:10:48] gets into a claiming mode and I'm only
[1:10:50] quoting that because you'll find this in
[1:10:52] the breach between the church chases and
[1:10:54] the seals and this is the theme is that
[1:10:56] in this breach of Revelations 5 which
[1:10:58] which is a gap we we go from the first
[1:11:01] the the seven Church Ages which brother
[1:11:04] rap is dealing with on Wednesday night
[1:11:06] he'll be on it again this Wednesday
[1:11:07] night first three chapters first four
[1:11:09] chapters excuse me first three chapters
[1:11:11] of Revelations is dealing with the
[1:11:13] church history of 2,000 years the church
[1:11:15] ages seven local churches in Asia Minor
[1:11:19] became prophetic of Seven Ages all the
[1:11:21] way to our age the lat oan age if you
[1:11:24] look in your Bible after that then
[1:11:25] there's a voice that calls us higher
[1:11:28] into the revelation of further things if
[1:11:30] you look in chapter five all of a sudden
[1:11:33] our lamb shows up and we seen our lamb
[1:11:35] go to Calvary for us 2,000 years ago we
[1:11:37] see him as a high priest we see him
[1:11:39] walking in the midst of the seven golden
[1:11:41] candlesticks which means he was in the
[1:11:43] midst with the people throughout seven
[1:11:45] Church ages but then if you're noticing
[1:11:48] if you really got inquisitive to know
[1:11:51] where does our lamb go in Revelation 5
[1:11:54] he steps forth into this Vision that
[1:11:57] John's having our lamb Jesus Christ
[1:12:00] steps into a vision that John is having
[1:12:02] about a book of redemption that got lost
[1:12:05] a title deed that got lost that belonged
[1:12:08] to Adam but got lost and went back into
[1:12:11] the hands of the original owner because
[1:12:13] of sin Adam lost that title deed it was
[1:12:16] his he lost it through sin it went back
[1:12:18] in the hands of origin owner but there
[1:12:20] comes a time when God is going to hand
[1:12:23] it back back two
[1:12:27] sons so now you see our Lamb with by the
[1:12:30] way seven horns seven eyes and when you
[1:12:34] have the the the the number seven it
[1:12:37] means completion so it's not our lamb
[1:12:39] going to Calvary it's the same lamb that
[1:12:41] went to Calvary stepping forth now for
[1:12:44] what work claiming
[1:12:47] work time shall be no more no more delay
[1:12:52] it's kind of like when you go that day
[1:12:54] to pay the rest of the 2,000 for that
[1:12:56] car it's the claiming day it's the
[1:12:59] claiming time and so you get in your car
[1:13:01] with your dad and you're riding towards
[1:13:03] cuz you're what you're in a claiming
[1:13:05] mode you're in a paying off
[1:13:08] mode that's there's a transition and our
[1:13:11] lamb steps forth in this because why
[1:13:13] he's going to enter a season of The
[1:13:15] Seven seal he's going to enter a season
[1:13:17] that he's not in the high priest mode
[1:13:19] he's not in the dying and paying the
[1:13:22] price mode he's in the clim
[1:13:24] mode I'm stepping forth and the first
[1:13:27] thing he does is take this book of
[1:13:29] redemption that has seven mysteries on
[1:13:30] it and he tears those off and hands them
[1:13:33] to his Prophet on Earth to speak those
[1:13:35] seven Mysteries so now when he tears the
[1:13:37] seals off it this book of redemption
[1:13:39] that has our names in it is given to the
[1:13:42] people that you can start looking into
[1:13:44] there and start seeing it's claiming
[1:13:47] time it's position
[1:13:50] time it's to tell us what is this Holy
[1:13:53] Ghost it's not just a feeling at the
[1:13:55] Revival it's claiming time it's Rapture
[1:13:58] time it's position time it's knowing our
[1:14:01] position it's power
[1:14:04] time Hallelujah he enters the claiming
[1:14:07] mode which you know
[1:14:09] what uh and I'm just going to try to
[1:14:12] find a way to end this today but when
[1:14:15] our lamb he's going to enter the
[1:14:17] claiming mode and at the same time that
[1:14:19] our lamb enters the claiming mode Satan
[1:14:23] he gets in a uh frustrated
[1:14:28] mode or a fussing mode he's going to
[1:14:31] fuss with this he's going to be upset at
[1:14:34] this you still with me this
[1:14:35] morning he gets in a real vicious mode
[1:14:40] because this particular act it's one
[1:14:42] thing to die for the sins of the people
[1:14:44] but it's another thing for sons of God
[1:14:46] to begin to catch their position and
[1:14:48] what it's paid
[1:14:50] for Satan starts to become that's why in
[1:14:52] Christ mystery you say this is the
[1:14:54] reason Satan is howling right now he's
[1:14:57] howling he gets in this fussing mode
[1:15:00] because everything you grab a hold of in
[1:15:02] this book of redemption and hold on to
[1:15:03] say I'm starting to know my position I
[1:15:05] Know Who I Am the claiming is coming I'm
[1:15:07] going to finish this I'm going to a
[1:15:09] Rapture Satan gets mad and he's gonna
[1:15:11] fuss with it he's gonna fuss with you
[1:15:14] now now wait a minute you know hold on
[1:15:16] just a minute here what about what you
[1:15:18] did last
[1:15:19] week because he's angry he's upset at
[1:15:22] this particular time he gets howling he
[1:15:25] gets mad but guess what our lamb in this
[1:15:29] vision is called the
[1:15:32] lion because two glory be to God 2,000
[1:15:36] years ago he had to come as a lamb
[1:15:40] innocent maybe not even intimidating but
[1:15:43] yet the Bible says the lamb has
[1:15:45] prevailed the lion has prevailed he
[1:15:47] prevailed at Calvary he gave up
[1:15:50] everything to pay for our sins but now
[1:15:53] it's the lion he's named The Lion
[1:15:55] because if the devil's gonna fuss about
[1:15:57] this then he might be a lamb the devil
[1:16:01] might not be afraid of a lamb but he's
[1:16:04] afraid of the
[1:16:09] lion that's why in The Vision now it's
[1:16:11] mentioned the lion that prevailed the
[1:16:13] lion the lion our same Jesus Christ
[1:16:15] moves into a mode he's into a claiming
[1:16:18] mode and he's not going to stop he's
[1:16:20] going to hand this to Sons he's going to
[1:16:22] finish this work he's going to take them
[1:16:24] to a Rapture despite they living in
[1:16:25] Satan's
[1:16:28] Eden glory be to
[1:16:30] God maybe I'm not capable of bringing it
[1:16:33] friends but I just feel like sitting
[1:16:34] down in a corner and weeping and
[1:16:36] shouting right now we're so blessed to
[1:16:38] hear these things not because of me we
[1:16:41] are blessed to be standing right now at
[1:16:44] this time because our lamb Jesus Christ
[1:16:48] is not in the lamb mode he's in a lion
[1:16:51] mode and the devil's going to fuss and
[1:16:53] tear you down and mess with your mind
[1:16:54] all he wants to but our lamb is our line
[1:16:57] is going to step in because he's in a
[1:16:59] claiming mode and he's going to claim
[1:17:02] that which is for you and claim you
[1:17:05] because you are his
[1:17:07] claim and all the other things you lost
[1:17:09] in the garden he's going to give back to
[1:17:13] you no more delay time no more
[1:17:16] Revelations 10:6 time no more he steps
[1:17:19] into a claiming o I'm here to start
[1:17:21] claiming the rest the lamb advancing
[1:17:23] from glory for intercessions all right
[1:17:25] to make claims now for his Redemption
[1:17:27] you guys don't have this quote up there
[1:17:28] the lamb advancing from Glory into this
[1:17:30] vision for intercessions he came from
[1:17:33] intercessing for 2,000 years to make
[1:17:35] claims now for his Redemption remember
[1:17:37] he has been on his mediatorial work back
[1:17:40] there mediatorial work back there for
[1:17:41] 2,000 years for remember these seals are
[1:17:44] ready to be opened and the lamb come
[1:17:46] from the sanctuary of God and Advance
[1:17:48] forth now when you have these terms he
[1:17:50] Advan forth he's going towards it he's
[1:17:53] stepping up to make Redemption cleans
[1:17:54] don't put a one day on it that all of a
[1:17:57] sudden bang this has happened in one day
[1:18:00] in 1963 and there's no more
[1:18:05] Mercy you're interpreting that
[1:18:07] wrong because everything that I say is
[1:18:10] that he's advancing for us he's stepping
[1:18:12] into this mode of claiming and it's a
[1:18:14] process just like everything else God
[1:18:16] does how many knows the first coming of
[1:18:17] Christ was a process it wasn't just when
[1:18:20] Jesus was born in a major it was a
[1:18:22] process
[1:18:23] the the prophecy was there then he spoke
[1:18:25] to Simeon then he spoke to Mary then and
[1:18:28] there's a bunch of things that went on
[1:18:29] before the baby was there his second
[1:18:31] coming is the same way it's not a one-
[1:18:33] day event and this lamb steps forth now
[1:18:37] and he's stepping forth don't you dare
[1:18:39] stick a date in 1963 he by opening the
[1:18:41] seals he begins this process with his
[1:18:44] people the lamb is going to step forth
[1:18:47] with claims now we get into trouble
[1:18:50] doctrinally when we start saying it
[1:18:51] happened then he open the seals it's
[1:18:54] there's no more Mercy for anybody out
[1:18:55] there it's all sealed in my brother you
[1:18:57] have misinterpreted the word whoever you
[1:18:59] are because this lamb I'm thankful today
[1:19:03] I wouldn't be preaching unless there was
[1:19:05] still Blood On The Mercy Seat for
[1:19:07] somebody to be saved and I'm going to
[1:19:09] keep preaching it until I'm gone to a
[1:19:11] Rapture because it's not up to me to
[1:19:14] decide when the lamb has shut the door
[1:19:17] and by the way he does shut the door he
[1:19:18] did in Noah's day God shut the door and
[1:19:20] nobody else could get in but it's not up
[1:19:22] to me when he shuts the door as far as
[1:19:24] I'm concerned the door is still
[1:19:27] open he can't bless denominational
[1:19:29] systems and Creeds and dogmas he can't
[1:19:31] do that his his blood does not work for
[1:19:34] something that's not his word but souls
[1:19:37] and sincere hearts that will accept the
[1:19:39] blood of Jesus Christ I have no right to
[1:19:42] put that person
[1:19:45] out these are the imbalances that we've
[1:19:48] had Among Us sometimes and I just want
[1:19:52] to teach my own people don't do
[1:19:56] that because the lamb and the lion is
[1:19:59] doing what he wants to do in his
[1:20:01] time and I just tell the devil if it was
[1:20:05] over who's this brother Jason sitting
[1:20:07] here was baptized a couple years ago and
[1:20:09] his life being transformed by the word
[1:20:12] who's this brother Brent here who's if
[1:20:13] it's over who's some of you who just
[1:20:15] came in 10 years ago or came in 5 years
[1:20:17] ago let that be just such an insult to
[1:20:20] the devil this morning that tries to
[1:20:22] tell us there's no blood on The Mercy
[1:20:24] Seat there is blood on The Mercy
[1:20:28] Seat the seriousness that the prophet
[1:20:31] brought that there reach a time that it
[1:20:33] will end and everything's sealed in and
[1:20:36] no more souls can come in uh because the
[1:20:38] Rapture no it's is coming there is a
[1:20:42] time coming but none of us have a right
[1:20:44] to say the exact
[1:20:45] day shame on us for doing it I don't
[1:20:48] know why I said all that this morning
[1:20:49] but I want to go back to that our lamb
[1:20:51] is in the claiming to come and get and
[1:20:54] pay the rest of that car and you're
[1:20:56] driving with your dad to go get that car
[1:20:59] but the devil gets to fussing he don't
[1:21:01] like it he's trying to find a
[1:21:03] technicality in the paperwork
[1:21:07] somewhere how am I going to explain
[1:21:10] this it's it's like when I go to the BMV
[1:21:14] office in
[1:21:16] Michigan it's very frustrating for
[1:21:20] me because I work so hard at bringing
[1:21:24] all the documents they
[1:21:26] need and how many has ever had somebody
[1:21:29] in one of those offices that just keep
[1:21:33] making it
[1:21:35] difficult I was just there this week for
[1:21:37] my mom for something for her they do the
[1:21:40] same thing to I try to be nice to them I
[1:21:42] just try to be and I say I have it all
[1:21:44] this is the fifth time I've come back
[1:21:45] because you asked for something new
[1:21:47] every
[1:21:47] time you know I have a job I have things
[1:21:50] to do and they always find a way you're
[1:21:53] missing something here you're missing
[1:21:55] it's just
[1:21:57] like Mr La
[1:22:00] Fontaine I'm having trouble here with
[1:22:02] what you have and I'm I'm sitting there
[1:22:04] saying why here's the
[1:22:07] documents this
[1:22:09] title I've bought it I have purchased
[1:22:12] the vehicle I want the title and a
[1:22:14] Michigan title and I have my I have my
[1:22:17] birth certificate I have my passport I
[1:22:21] have my footprint when I was a baby I
[1:22:25] have everything but how can we prove
[1:22:27] here I have my license it has my picture
[1:22:30] on it my picture is in the Bedford press
[1:22:32] it's here it's everywhere I am who I
[1:22:35] am but the devil wants to keep putting
[1:22:39] doubts in your mind that you are who you
[1:22:42] are when you have the birthright you
[1:22:44] have the Holy Ghost you have the down
[1:22:47] payment somebody say praise the Lord
[1:22:49] prise the Lord he likes to fuss even
[1:22:51] though there's no fussing there's no
[1:22:56] problem Mr leontine there seems to be uh
[1:23:00] a confusion going on and I'm going there
[1:23:03] is no
[1:23:06] confusion Mr leontine and she's
[1:23:08] shuffling all these papers you know like
[1:23:10] they do and it's
[1:23:14] like Mr leontine I just feel like
[1:23:17] something is missing here you haven't
[1:23:19] done something to earn this title yet
[1:23:21] there's something missing and and Mr
[1:23:26] leontine I'm gonna have to go back and
[1:23:29] talk to my manager about
[1:23:33] this Mr
[1:23:37] devil excuse me just a moment so they go
[1:23:39] back into the office and they take all
[1:23:41] the paperwork they did it this week they
[1:23:43] take all the paperwork to get approval
[1:23:45] from the manager and they took a look
[1:23:47] and then 15 minutes later they come out
[1:23:50] and sometimes they come out and they
[1:23:52] look at
[1:23:53] Mr
[1:23:54] leontine I'm sorry to say this but
[1:23:58] there's we still feel like there's just
[1:24:00] something missing here let we're going
[1:24:01] to have to read through this and it's
[1:24:03] all
[1:24:05] technicalities and you know what I meet
[1:24:08] all the technicalities for them because
[1:24:11] of the law Michigan law but I didn't
[1:24:13] have to meet all the requirements for
[1:24:16] the title deed to
[1:24:19] [Applause]
[1:24:21] Redemption but I still have a devil
[1:24:23] that's making me question and Mr
[1:24:26] leontine you've got to be missing
[1:24:28] something don't you remember that
[1:24:30] mistake you did last year and where's
[1:24:32] the payment for that it's underneath the
[1:24:34] blood of Jesus
[1:24:37] Christ it's under the
[1:24:42] blood it's
[1:24:47] frustrating and then she talks to her
[1:24:49] boss and finally come out and I do have
[1:24:52] everything and she just takes it on just
[1:24:55] she gets frustrated that's the Devil
[1:24:56] he's frustrated with you this can't be
[1:24:58] true that you get all this inheritance
[1:25:01] of Heaven given to you it's not fair I
[1:25:03] want to hold it back from you and he
[1:25:05] said but no he purchased it at Calvary
[1:25:07] it's mine healing is mine Redemption is
[1:25:10] mine power is mine he gave it to
[1:25:16] me give me
[1:25:19] that f it up hold up put it on
[1:25:24] can good day Mr
[1:25:29] leontine the way it is I'm telling you
[1:25:31] and and you know what it's it's kind of
[1:25:34] like how can I make I hope your
[1:25:37] understanding I know this is simple but
[1:25:39] this is how God wants to make it he's
[1:25:42] given you eternal life he gives you
[1:25:44] eternal life and we got a devil who's
[1:25:46] fussing with it all the time and there
[1:25:48] must be some confusion there and I feel
[1:25:50] like saying no there's no confusion

[1:28:21] it
[1:28:22] okay hold

[1:28:34] buddy Betty Betty at the BMV
[1:28:37] office but you see now when you have if
[1:28:40] we're on our own okay when we on our own
[1:28:44] it's ours but we got a devil fighting us
[1:28:47] but in Revelations 5 the lamb our lion
[1:28:50] steps forth to make Redemption claims
[1:28:52] for us cuz we need a big brother how
[1:28:56] many know Jesus is our big
[1:28:59] brother we need a
[1:29:01] lion cuz a lion is the king of the
[1:29:04] jungle that's right can you say amen and
[1:29:07] from what I hear the lion hath roared
[1:29:09] who can but fear the lion roars in the
[1:29:11] jungle and you the lamb all those other
[1:29:14] things you know there's nothing but when
[1:29:15] the lion RAR they tell me the Jungle
[1:29:16] everything else shuts up so Lane if
[1:29:20] we've got a big brother here Jesus
[1:29:21] Christ who stands here with us is going
[1:29:23] to make claims with us there's not much
[1:29:27] that our lion has to do all he has to do
[1:29:30] is just look and tell him to get out of
[1:29:32] the
[1:29:35] way and you can go get your
[1:29:37] money thanks guys thank
[1:29:46] you don't try to steal his money no no
[1:29:49] no no that's yours that's it's yours
[1:29:52] buddy thank you for doing this thank you
[1:29:53] for acting I appreciate it did I
[1:29:56] embarrass you a little bit a little bit
[1:29:59] okay I'm sorry let me give you an extra
[1:30:01] 50 for
[1:30:03] embarrass let's all stand together and
[1:30:05] say praise the
[1:30:08] Lord I like the children sometimes to
[1:30:11] understand what I'm preaching and I'm
[1:30:13] telling you friends I believe that with
[1:30:17] all my heart that we're in the closing
[1:30:19] seconds of time I believe our lamb has
[1:30:22] become the lion and he's in a Redemption
[1:30:23] claim mode and every time you come to a
[1:30:26] service like that he's dropping things
[1:30:28] in your heart by Revelation from this
[1:30:30] open book to show Sons who they are
[1:30:33] where they're going and I believe I'm
[1:30:35] preaching to people who've got the down
[1:30:37] payment we just want the rest can you
[1:30:39] say Amen the Holy Ghost is just a down
[1:30:41] payment but it means we're going to get
[1:30:43] the rest and this last quote if you guys
[1:30:46] pull it up about healing I wanted to
[1:30:47] read this for my sister and all of the
[1:30:49] rest of you just to remind us of what
[1:30:51] God does and and I think that the power
[1:30:53] of God that would take a cancer-ridden
[1:30:54] woman here that the doctors has just
[1:30:57] given a few days and she's one of the
[1:30:59] thousands that's on record not just the
[1:31:01] man the person's testimony but the
[1:31:04] doctor's testimony one of the thousands
[1:31:07] and her eating up with a few hours to
[1:31:08] live by cancer and by the earnest of her
[1:31:10] redeemed body will put her in the
[1:31:13] condition it is now what will it be when
[1:31:15] she draws the full value of the
[1:31:18] resurrection of Jesus Christ that's just
[1:31:21] a d
[1:31:22] you know you know what the down the
[1:31:24] earnest is the earnest is the down
[1:31:26] payment on anything holds it assurity
[1:31:29] secures it now she's got the earnest of
[1:31:32] it being healed W with a hideous cancer
