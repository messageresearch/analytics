[0:00] War here today and we're going to read
[0:02] from John chapter 7 and just two verses
[0:05] John chapter 7 verse 37 and 38.
[0:09] it says in the Bible in the last day
[0:12] that great day of the feast Jesus stood
[0:15] and cried saying if any man thirst let
[0:19] him come unto me and drink
[0:22] he that believeth on me as the scripture
[0:25] hath said out of his belly shall flow
[0:28] rivers of Living Water so the first
[0:32] verse is God's call to the Thirsty in
[0:36] the last time in the last day of the
[0:38] feast and the second is the answer to
[0:40] that thirst and that is out of a
[0:43] believer's innermost being shall flow
[0:46] rivers of Living Water and the rivers
[0:48] coming from us will be the answer to The
[0:51] Thirst in people in the last days
[0:55] Heavenly Father blessed and anoint your
[0:58] servant today Lord we stand always
[1:01] expecting for you to do above and beyond
[1:03] what we could ask or think we just feel
[1:06] your special your a special anointing
[1:09] here today a special spirit
[1:11] and Lord not all the time is it jumping
[1:13] and shouting and screaming sometimes
[1:16] Lord we're so inspired we do that but
[1:19] there's sometimes it's just quiet and
[1:22] Lord but you're ever so near us your
[1:25] presence is ever so close and we love
[1:27] you today we thank you for Henry's song
[1:30] that is our heart today to tell you
[1:35] you can have all this world
[1:39] Just Give Me Jesus
[1:41] Just Give Me Jesus
[1:43] it's all we want Lord that's all that
[1:45] counts thank you Father for this lovely
[1:48] group of people
[1:50] and I pray you'll love them closer to
[1:51] you today
[1:53] through the word in Jesus name amen amen
[1:56] once you shake somebody's hand again and
[1:58] greet them in the name of the Lord God
[2:00] bless you each one
[2:03] foreign
[2:10] Jesus is standing here in John chapter
[2:12] 7.
[2:14] attending the last feast
[2:17] and there were seven feasts to Israel
[2:20] and he attended all of them
[2:22] and he was attending because that's what
[2:26] the law had said to do to attend these
[2:28] things and he's standing at the very
[2:30] last Feast attending
[2:32] which would be the last Feast which
[2:34] would be the Feast of Tabernacles and in
[2:37] the very last day of the last Feast he
[2:40] cries out with a loud voice I don't know
[2:42] who was standing there but he cries out
[2:43] in the last piece If any man thirsts
[2:46] that's his words if any man thirst let
[2:49] him come to me and drink and so if any
[2:53] man thirst let him come and so now it is
[2:55] we must acknowledge first that it is the
[2:58] last day of the feast it's the last day
[3:01] and he makes an appeal to the Thirsty
[3:03] and this is where we are at in Prophecy
[3:06] today because we are uh we have come
[3:10] through a spiritual uh manifestation of
[3:12] the seven feasts there was a literal
[3:14] seven feasts and we don't attend those
[3:16] today but there is a spiritual
[3:18] fulfillment of each Feast that Jesus did
[3:21] back there in the Old Testament it gave
[3:23] in the Old Testament there's a spiritual
[3:25] fulfillment to those feasts and we're
[3:27] living out those the Feast of Passover
[3:29] which is Christ going to Calvary uh the
[3:32] all the different feasts we've lived out
[3:34] and when we come to the last one which
[3:36] is the Feast of Tabernacles if you study
[3:38] it out in time that's where we're at
[3:40] right now we're coming into the Feast of
[3:42] Tabernacles and so this is so
[3:44] significant when he says these words in
[3:47] the last day of the last Feast he makes
[3:50] an appeal to the Thirsty and this is
[3:53] where we're at in Prophecy right now
[3:55] we're in the last we're in the end we're
[3:58] in the last call as it was and this is
[4:01] confirmed I didn't read the scripture to
[4:03] you but I would read it to you now if
[4:05] you still have your Bibles or they can
[4:07] pull it up if you just read in
[4:09] Revelations the very last scriptures in
[4:12] Revelations 22
[4:15] it's it says in verse 17 and we're we're
[4:18] talking the very last uh five verses but
[4:21] it says the last of the Bible here
[4:23] Revelations 22 and verse 17 and the
[4:26] spirit and the bride say come and let
[4:30] him that heareth say come and let him
[4:34] that is a thirst come and whosoever will
[4:37] let him take the Water of Life freely
[4:42] so now we have the last the very last
[4:44] call at the very last of the Bible
[4:47] saying the same thing that he said in
[4:49] the last feast and that is he that is
[4:52] thirsty it's a call for him that is
[4:55] thirsty
[4:57] and and in this case so it's confirmed a
[5:01] second time here that in the last few
[5:03] verses of the Bible there's a call to
[5:06] the Thirsty and it's strange that this
[5:08] word is used for the end and yet it is
[5:11] not strange if you look and see how
[5:15] people are acting today and when I say
[5:17] that you know we can look at how they're
[5:19] acting we can look at their attributes
[5:21] we can look at our attributes we can
[5:22] look at the world and the condition
[5:24] that's in we can see a lot of different
[5:26] crazy things going on and yet yet if you
[5:30] have discernment you have to realize
[5:32] when you have all of these
[5:34] characteristics of such trouble you have
[5:37] to go back to the source of why the
[5:39] trouble is there and that is people are
[5:43] thirsty for a living God
[5:46] it's about thirst
[5:48] and it's about not filling that thirst
[5:51] with God
[5:53] can you say Amen
[5:55] it goes back to thirst and so now it may
[5:58] be strange to say this is an important
[6:00] thing at the very end that talking about
[6:02] if any man thirsts and yet it is not
[6:05] strange if we see people how they're
[6:07] acting they're Restless they're UNS
[6:10] they're not satisfied people are
[6:11] restless people are not satisfied all
[6:14] the pleasures all the things we have all
[6:17] the modern conveniences we have
[6:19] everything at our fingertips fingers we
[6:21] have everything that we've ever wanted
[6:23] and and there's new stuff coming out all
[6:25] the time and yet man is constantly
[6:28] restless and constantly not satisfied if
[6:31] they were satisfied they would quit
[6:33] seeking something further but they're
[6:35] always thinking something else and so
[6:37] that means they're thirsty or they're
[6:38] restless and they're dissatisfied
[6:40] because they're not fulfilled they're
[6:42] not satisfied The Thirst is not being
[6:45] fulfilled
[6:47] The Thirst and the Soul can you say Amen
[6:49] man has now man has always been thirsty
[6:53] for God but never as Extreme as the last
[6:57] days man has always been thirsty but
[6:59] never as extreme now and thus all the
[7:02] evil and all the problems in the middle
[7:05] of Satan's Eden can be summed up in one
[7:08] word and that's thirst
[7:12] because you wouldn't have those things
[7:15] if they were drinking from the right
[7:17] fountain
[7:19] event
[7:20] the answer for all the trouble and all
[7:22] the things could never be as simple as
[7:25] drinking from the right Fountain but it
[7:28] is just that simple can you say Amen
[7:31] now Christ would never make a call to
[7:34] the Thirsty unless he knew that there
[7:37] had been a fountain opened up in the
[7:40] House of David
[7:41] and the the prophecy says and I believe
[7:44] it's Zechariah 13 and verse 1. it says
[7:47] in that day it's a prophecy in that day
[7:49] there shall be a fountain open in the
[7:52] House of David and to the inhabitants of
[7:54] Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness if
[7:58] you read the text I don't have time to
[8:00] talk about it in Zechariah 13 but you
[8:02] see when he prophesies and said there'll
[8:04] be a in that day there'll be a fountain
[8:06] open in the House of David for sin and
[8:08] for uncleanness it's coming right after
[8:11] a time of Israel when they're mourning
[8:13] they're seeing him and it says now it's
[8:16] actually a prophecy for Israel he said
[8:18] they will go into their houses and mourn
[8:20] for days because they begin to realize
[8:22] they killed their Messiah they'll see
[8:24] his pierced hands they'll see what they
[8:26] did and they were looking for the
[8:27] Messiah and they see they pierced them
[8:28] they rejected him they turned him away
[8:30] so this naturally will happen to Israel
[8:33] that they'll mourn for days constant
[8:35] mourning because we rejected our Messiah
[8:38] we rejected the Fountain of Life we had
[8:41] an opportunity opportunity for our sin
[8:42] and righteousness we chose legalism we
[8:45] chose the Pharisees instead of the
[8:47] fountain in the House of David he opened
[8:48] up and so we rejected him and now
[8:50] they're mourning for days and in the
[8:52] middle of that morning I'm paraphrasing
[8:54] because I don't have time to read the
[8:56] scripture right in the middle of it he's
[8:58] he says these words I will pour out
[9:01] Grace and supplication I will pour out
[9:04] Grace upon you people that are mourning
[9:06] he doesn't say yeah you rejected me
[9:08] you're finished he begins to pour out
[9:10] Grace upon them and pour out a Revival
[9:13] upon them and pour out and then his next
[9:16] words says in that day I'm going to open
[9:19] up a fountain in the House of David and
[9:22] if you'll come and drink
[9:25] if you'll just come and drink
[9:28] it it'll it'll bring Redemption to all
[9:31] of Israel it'll bring Revival how many
[9:33] want Revival in your life when he opens
[9:36] the House of David all you got to do is
[9:37] start drinking and you receive a Revival
[9:40] so that happens to Israel coming down
[9:42] the road as we leave as the bride in a
[9:45] Rapture it'll happen to Israel they'll
[9:47] have a Revival and it's because he'll
[9:49] open up a fountain in the House of David
[9:51] but I want to say that's just in the
[9:53] time of Israel mourning now but he'll
[9:55] open up a fountain and all they had to
[9:57] do was drink but what we do for the what
[10:00] he did for the Jews for Redemption he
[10:02] has I want to say this he has already
[10:04] done for us today he's already opened a
[10:08] fountain in the House of David
[10:10] for the bride
[10:14] he opened the healing Revival praise the
[10:16] Lord
[10:18] he opened the church ages to us
[10:21] this is the last days now he opened a
[10:23] healing Revival he opened the church
[10:25] ages to us he opened the seals to us in
[10:28] the last days anybody get a pattern here
[10:30] at the last days he's opening everything
[10:32] to us it was closed but he's opening
[10:35] things up for you he's opening up the
[10:37] seals he's opening up the church ages he
[10:40] said I'm not going to hold back anymore
[10:41] I'm opening everything to my people I'm
[10:44] opening up the healing that's how it
[10:45] started with a healing Revival I'm
[10:47] gushing forth a healing Revival to the
[10:50] people I'm opening the seals and when he
[10:53] opened the seals he actually by taking
[10:55] the seals off he opened the book of
[10:57] redemption as well in Revelations 5 it's
[11:00] closed in Revelations 10 it's opened
[11:06] for the last 70 years he has opened
[11:09] things for the bride but with it all I
[11:12] think the greatest thing he's opened is
[11:14] he's opened a pure fountain in the House
[11:17] of David for his people to drink
[11:21] I wouldn't stand preaching with all the
[11:24] issues going on in the world
[11:27] the spirits
[11:28] the issues that go on Among Us and in
[11:31] your lives
[11:32] I wouldn't even preach because I
[11:34] wouldn't believe there'd be hope in
[11:35] these kind of conditions except I know
[11:38] that there's a fountain that's been
[11:40] opened in the House of David
[11:43] and if you'll drink
[11:45] if you drink just simply drink it has
[11:48] all the answers in it
[11:50] somebody would say praise the Lord
[11:54] there's a fountain open in the House of
[11:56] David
[11:58] and so it's right on time because now is
[12:01] when the Thirsty can come when he opens
[12:03] the fountain now is when the Thirsty can
[12:06] come now the Call Comes he that is
[12:09] thirsty when the Fountain of David is
[12:11] open then the call goes out he that is
[12:14] thirsty come and drink we're not just
[12:16] another church here can you say Amen
[12:18] there's been a fountain open the last
[12:20] days of the House of David we're not
[12:21] another denominational Church we're not
[12:23] a just church that just teaches the
[12:25] Bible I thank God for all that but you
[12:27] see you can have the Bible but God has
[12:29] to open the fountain for sin and Uncle
[12:31] for cleansing can you say amount there
[12:34] has to be a fountain open to the people
[12:35] of God he breaks the seals he breaks all
[12:37] the spirit he said the spirit that was
[12:40] bound for almost 2 000 years by
[12:41] denominational Creeds has been loosed in
[12:44] the evening time by the evening time
[12:46] message loosed open to the people so we
[12:49] are not just another church here
[12:52] we preach because there's been a
[12:54] fountain open in the House of David
[12:58] something has been opened to us and
[13:00] that's why we can say and that's why the
[13:03] bride is at the end time it's the bride
[13:05] and the spirit who are saying come
[13:10] somebody say praise the Lord
[13:12] who is it at the end it's the bride and
[13:15] the spirit saying come now how does she
[13:18] say come unless she knows there's been a
[13:21] fountain open in the House of David you
[13:23] wouldn't want to draw people to come
[13:24] unless there's a fountain opened unless
[13:27] there's a place you don't want to bring
[13:28] people to church and say come because of
[13:30] Polo Fontaine I guarantee you that's not
[13:32] a good reason you don't want to bring
[13:33] people to come because I've got another
[13:35] church and we teach the Bible you want
[13:37] to get them to come because there's a
[13:38] fountain open at that church there's a
[13:40] fountain open in the last days
[13:42] and there isn't any problem there isn't
[13:45] any depression there isn't any sickness
[13:47] physical mental whatever it is there
[13:50] isn't anything too big for this Fountain
[13:52] to wash it all away
[13:55] you got to know that there's been a
[13:57] fountain open before you make the
[13:59] invitation to come
[14:01] oh God give us a people
[14:04] in this congregation if there's any
[14:06] precedence I want to set as a goal for
[14:08] this coming year I would love to have a
[14:10] people just catch that
[14:13] that they would begin to say more and
[14:15] more
[14:17] to people that they meet
[14:20] come
[14:23] we're not saying come enough
[14:26] divine we're too bogged down
[14:29] sometimes with our own problems
[14:31] but we forget the last call from the
[14:34] bride in the spirit is anybody who's
[14:36] thirsty come
[14:38] brother Bram says how do you know that
[14:40] you don't invite that little that little
[14:42] lady maybe she's a Prosper how do you
[14:44] know just a little invite to church
[14:45] wouldn't make her a daughter of God how
[14:47] do you know that
[14:49] if you don't catch anything else today
[14:51] catch a little instruction from the
[14:52] pastor this is my goal
[14:54] we need to say come more often
[14:58] oh but we're two hours away
[15:01] say come anyway
[15:04] somebody who's thirsty
[15:06] and they've got to go two hours to get a
[15:08] drink
[15:09] they're gonna come get a drink
[15:13] I drove three hours to a family the
[15:15] other day they drive one way one way
[15:18] three hours
[15:20] every Sunday
[15:21] One Way three hours one way three hours
[15:23] back I just said God bless you
[15:26] but I can tell you it's not about me
[15:27] it's about thirst
[15:31] nobody in their right mind does that
[15:32] when there's churches right on the
[15:34] corner
[15:35] but it's it's it's not about a church
[15:37] it's about are you thirsty and where are
[15:40] you getting a drink
[15:42] can you say amen I thank all the
[15:44] families that drive so far and all these
[15:46] different things and Hoops they have to
[15:48] drive jump through but listen praise the
[15:51] lord it's not about church it's about
[15:52] he's open a fountain in the House of
[15:54] David
[15:56] for those who are thirsty to come
[15:59] but let us say come let us say come
[16:02] see we can say it in our hearts but
[16:04] let's say come to people
[16:07] you're quiet but that's that's okay how
[16:10] often do you say come
[16:14] right it could be anybody
[16:16] we don't have a right to label anybody
[16:19] I go I go to an assembly
[16:22] and there's some really great things
[16:23] happening and God is really visiting us
[16:26] unless a lot of times oh I've got this
[16:28] and the doctor told me the other day
[16:30] I've got cancer would you come and be
[16:32] let our pastor let our elders would you
[16:34] come and let them anoint you and prayer
[16:37] would you come sometimes we'll say we'll
[16:38] pray for you and that's fine but would
[16:40] you come it's the word come come who's
[16:42] thirsty come man I got married I used I
[16:45] was raised in church and I'm a mess and
[16:47] God would never accept to me wait wait a
[16:49] minute no where'd you learn that no it
[16:51] is and I don't want to talk about all
[16:53] the details I just want you to come one
[16:55] time just come brother Jason Watkins
[16:57] told a guy about five years ago he found
[16:59] a guy struggling and he said I can't
[17:00] come there I can't do that and he was
[17:02] going on I don't live good enough I'm
[17:04] not dressed good enough I look like this
[17:06] and he's going on and on that's why I
[17:08] can't come that's why I come and brother
[17:10] Jason said can you just do one thing can
[17:12] you just come don't worry about the
[17:13] dress don't worry about all these other
[17:15] things don't worry about you're not
[17:16] perfect don't matter all the sin you're
[17:18] done can you do one thing can you just
[17:20] come Wednesday and Sunday can you just
[17:22] make an hour can you come he says I
[17:25] think I can do it he said that's all you
[17:26] need need to do right now you just need
[17:28] to come
[17:30] let God do the rest
[17:36] so I read both of these verses in 37 and
[17:38] 38 in John chapter 7 because it's not
[17:41] just that he makes the call to come but
[17:43] he then points to where the fountain
[17:45] will be and I want you to notice this
[17:47] now he didn't point to books and tapes
[17:50] he didn't point to a particular Church
[17:52] the next verse in the last day that
[17:55] great of the feast great deal that he's
[17:57] Jesus stood and cried saying if any man
[17:59] thirst let him come unto me and drink he
[18:01] that believeth on me as the scripture
[18:03] had said out of his belly shall flow
[18:06] rivers of Living Water where is this
[18:09] fountain at because it's it's not just
[18:12] making the call now but he points in the
[18:15] next verse and that's why I read it he
[18:16] points to where this Fountain will be
[18:19] and it won't be in a church it won't
[18:22] necessarily be in in these other things
[18:24] and we know God can speak to us through
[18:26] his word but the fountain the power the
[18:29] the refreshing the changing the washing
[18:31] of sin where is this great river flowing
[18:34] out of it's flowing out of the inner
[18:37] parts of a Believer who has believed
[18:39] this message where is it it's in you
[18:44] Jesus said it it's in you where is this
[18:48] river flowing it's flowing out of you if
[18:50] you have the Holy Ghost
[18:52] it's coming out of you
[18:54] and so whatever you need it's coming out
[18:57] of you whatever they need it's coming
[18:59] out of you
[19:01] let's not just Skip and say yes there's
[19:03] a fountain open the House of David it's
[19:05] at a church no no wait a minute wait a
[19:06] minute no no we want to get them to
[19:08] church why because there's a fountain
[19:10] flowing but listen it's really coming
[19:13] out of you
[19:15] and that goes directly with the last
[19:18] scriptures in the Bible who is it that's
[19:20] saying come the spirit and the bride say
[19:23] come in the last days why she knows a
[19:26] fountain has been opened and she knows
[19:29] it's flowing
[19:31] through her
[19:34] praise the Lord you might know there's
[19:36] the fountain
[19:38] opened but do you know that it's flowing
[19:41] through you
[19:45] I don't know if a lot of people know
[19:46] that
[19:48] flow through me Holy Spirit
[19:51] flow through me
[19:54] out of his innermost being
[19:57] rivers of Living Water will gush out
[20:00] from where
[20:01] from
[20:02] from tapes and books and an app on our
[20:05] phone
[20:08] it's out of us
[20:10] see I don't feel like that today brother
[20:12] Paul well I wish you'd get past your
[20:14] feelings about yourself
[20:16] I wish you'd quit looking at everybody
[20:17] else and quit looking at yourself and
[20:19] look at what's God deposited on the
[20:21] inside here
[20:22] and something flows out of us something
[20:25] flows out of this bride she knows a
[20:27] fountain has been opened and she knows
[20:29] it's flowing for her that's why she can
[20:31] be part of the spirit saying come if
[20:33] you're thirsty come now I just want to
[20:35] just switch here and take this a bit
[20:37] further a bit deeper this morning
[20:39] everybody agree with everything so far
[20:41] amen I want to take it a little bit
[20:43] further because I'm going to just call
[20:45] upon you to join me and listen to this
[20:49] uh this message thirst that brother
[20:52] Brandon preached if you would listen to
[20:54] that message I would appreciate it I'd
[20:56] like to give what I'm studying out of
[20:57] and where I get some things and I may
[20:59] quote out of it today just a bit but
[21:01] most of all for you to listen to it if
[21:02] you raise your hands I'll listen to
[21:04] thirst this week if you listen to that
[21:06] message because it's such a significant
[21:08] thing that needed that had to be spoken
[21:11] in this day for so many reasons God had
[21:15] to speak to us through his Messenger to
[21:18] speak on just one simple word thirst and
[21:21] it was the last days he had to talk
[21:23] about thirst and he had to talk about it
[21:26] for so many reasons that I can't name
[21:29] them all today but it was a critical
[21:31] time for these things to be said not
[21:35] just to show that we have natural
[21:37] god-given thirst that's what he used as
[21:39] a type we have a thirst for for food we
[21:42] hunger for food we have a thirst for
[21:43] water something to drink we we can't
[21:46] live unless we address those those
[21:48] natural needs we have natural thirst
[21:50] within us and so he said that but it was
[21:52] really to show that we not only have
[21:54] natural god-given thirsts we have
[21:57] spiritual thirst that God has given us
[22:00] they are within us they are thirsts that
[22:02] are within us and it was to show not
[22:05] just to show that but to show that when
[22:07] the fountain for our thirst is open
[22:10] Satan right away jumps in and perverts
[22:13] the waters to replace not God's Waters
[22:17] but he he perverts and presents us some
[22:19] other fountains to drink from to fill
[22:22] that Holy thirst that God gave us it's
[22:25] the last days where he says there's a
[22:28] perversion of these thirsts there's a
[22:30] perversion of these Waters to replace
[22:32] what we drink from and we begin drinking
[22:35] from those things and when we do we
[22:38] never reach the full satisfaction of
[22:41] life or the full potential even as a
[22:44] Believer we know the world their problem
[22:46] is they're not drinking from the right
[22:48] Fountain can you say Amen we know that's
[22:51] taken place and we know that they eat
[22:52] from perverted thirst but even Believers
[22:55] can hold back what they can get in God
[22:57] because they too sometimes buy into
[23:00] other replacement things to satisfy
[23:05] we all do it
[23:07] we all do it
[23:09] and never reaching the full satisfaction
[23:11] in Life or full potential as a believer
[23:15] just know it will always it always will
[23:18] come
[23:19] it always will come to let me just say
[23:21] it this way my sermons uh although this
[23:25] is the part you might not like but my
[23:28] sermons always come to a certain place
[23:30] in my sermon
[23:31] and it's a place of pointing out the
[23:33] evils and traps that are in front of you
[23:36] as a Believer robbing you of spiritual
[23:38] victory
[23:40] I get specific I bring it down that's
[23:43] why some of my services will be shouting
[23:45] at the beginning and we'll all be sober
[23:47] at the end because it's just my way I'm
[23:49] going to bring it down where the rubber
[23:50] meets the road
[23:52] this thing of the Bride speaking and
[23:55] she's saying come and it's such a
[23:56] blessing that's in us the rivers of
[23:58] water I believe all of that but we have
[24:00] to talk about what it is that holds up
[24:02] the fountain yourself and the perverted
[24:05] Waters that we drink from
[24:08] that keep us from Full satisfaction in
[24:10] Christ and satisfaction in Who We Are
[24:14] we're to be a people that's at total
[24:16] rest and confidence in who we are and
[24:19] how God made us and we're completely
[24:21] satisfied can you it's like after a meal
[24:24] and you haven't ate for a while and you
[24:25] have a real good meal and you you feel
[24:28] totally satisfied and peaceful can you
[24:31] say Amen your body has come to a rest
[24:34] because you satisfied a craving to eat
[24:36] and you just feel that spiritually
[24:38] speaking you have to feed yourself you
[24:41] have to drink from the Waters of life
[24:42] and it can't be every Sunday it can't be
[24:45] every camp meeting it can't be just
[24:47] every other day you have to stay
[24:49] drinking from this Fountain and you stay
[24:51] satisfied
[24:53] I'm not Restless I'm not up and down can
[24:56] you say Amen
[24:58] so I have to point out brother REM says
[25:00] the one of the reasons for the message
[25:01] is to point out the evils of the day
[25:04] so that's the message too it's not just
[25:06] the Seven Seals
[25:08] that actually points out the evils of
[25:10] today
[25:11] but the message is to point out the
[25:13] evils of today
[25:14] so I want to because of this I want to
[25:16] talk about thirst
[25:18] why
[25:20] because thirst is related
[25:23] to relationships in our life
[25:27] thirst and longing and neediness
[25:31] is related to relationships in our lives
[25:35] because when we enter into relationships
[25:38] or we have relationships
[25:39] if there's somebody on one side that has
[25:42] a thirst and they have a need and that
[25:44] need is not being met then there's going
[25:46] to be trouble in the relationship
[25:48] because it's it's not about the fights
[25:51] that you have or the tensions that you
[25:53] have many times it's there's a thirst
[25:57] deep within somebody that's not being
[26:00] met
[26:01] and so we're being critical of the
[26:04] outside and the arguments and this
[26:06] person's terrible to live with and
[26:08] they've done this and they've done that
[26:10] and you've got a whole history that you
[26:12] can see of all kinds of family trouble
[26:15] or this particular person we don't have
[26:17] a good relationship but at the end of
[26:19] the day most things is because somebody
[26:21] never got satisfied in their thirst for
[26:23] God there's a thirst something Beyond
[26:26] just the trouble they cause they're
[26:28] thirsty for something how many's ever
[26:30] heard that isn't isn't that a cry for
[26:32] help somebody's doing all this crazy
[26:33] stuff isn't that a cry for help there's
[26:35] some truth to that
[26:37] there's a cry but what's in our society
[26:39] nobody ever addresses the cry for help
[26:45] nobody addresses The Thirst
[26:48] so how can we have good relationships
[26:50] unless we're willing to look at the love
[26:53] of God and what it does not just to
[26:54] correct temporary corrective situation
[26:56] in a relationship but we how can we
[26:59] approach it right unless we look at The
[27:01] Thirst what's that person thirsty for
[27:03] are they being satisfied in God and I'm
[27:05] going to get to it today are we doing
[27:07] our part to let the flow of this Divine
[27:11] love the flow of it get to that person
[27:13] and not hold it back even when it's not
[27:16] being received back
[27:20] we don't have a right to shut off the
[27:23] faucet
[27:25] of divine love
[27:29] because God doesn't have a faucet God
[27:32] doesn't have a thing he shuts it off he
[27:34] never shuts it off it's there flowing
[27:37] for anybody who wants to drink of it and
[27:39] if that's flowing through us we don't
[27:41] have a right to shut it off to some
[27:44] people
[27:45] and then turn it on to other people
[27:48] I'll give you more of the love of Christ
[27:50] because of this because of that but this
[27:52] person I'm just going to wing back here
[27:55] a little bit we don't have a right to do
[27:56] that
[27:58] mom
[27:59] and when we shut it off we shut it off
[28:01] for the real need of the person how many
[28:02] you want to raise your hand and say I
[28:04] want to find the real need of the person
[28:06] I want to find my real need
[28:08] because the surface stuff going on the
[28:11] carnal stuff we've had churches for 2
[28:14] 000 years try to address the outside of
[28:16] a person
[28:18] we have pockets in the message that's
[28:20] taken this message to just address the
[28:22] outside of a person get them dressed
[28:24] right get them acting right get them
[28:26] acting like a Christian my question is
[28:28] did they ever come to the Fountain to
[28:30] meet the need that's on the inside
[28:32] because if you're not addressing the
[28:34] craving I need love I need I need the
[28:37] love of Christ I need a craving if we
[28:40] ignore that and jump to the outside
[28:42] stuff we're ignoring the most important
[28:44] part
[28:46] all of us have cravings all of us have
[28:49] needs can you say Amen in most
[28:51] situations sitting even in this room in
[28:54] your family life a lot of those needs
[28:57] were not met in your family
[29:03] a lot of those needs weren't met in your
[29:05] family and that's why today
[29:07] at a young age even the best thing to do
[29:09] is cling and find this Fountain because
[29:12] there's no guarantee that you're going
[29:14] to get all the love that you needed from
[29:16] your father
[29:17] there's no gear I can't guarantee you
[29:19] that there'd even be reconciliation made
[29:21] with family situations that hurt you so
[29:24] bad and you never got your needs met as
[29:26] a child I can't guarantee that but I can
[29:29] guarantee there's a fountain open in the
[29:31] House of David for every thirst that
[29:33] you're needy of
[29:36] so when we're young we should seek it
[29:38] with all our heart because you can't
[29:39] make a guarantee relationships will
[29:41] always be right with churches with one
[29:43] another with people your spouse may even
[29:45] hurt you someday and you've got to be
[29:47] confident and satisfied that your thirst
[29:50] and needs are first being met in the
[29:53] Lord first there's a satisfaction I love
[29:56] to marry people that are completely
[29:58] satisfied in their walk with the Lord
[30:00] and they're not marrying that person as
[30:03] a dependent to be dependent on their
[30:05] spirituality but they're complete if God
[30:07] asks them to be single the rest of their
[30:09] life they're perfectly satisfied to
[30:11] serve the Lord I told somebody one of my
[30:13] kids out the other day I said 27 years
[30:15] old I was saying Lord how come I'm not
[30:17] married yet my sister Sharon she gets to
[30:19] get me married at 18. I didn't get to
[30:21] you Mary Lord what's this is not this is
[30:23] not fair I'm a good guy and I got bitter
[30:26] for two years I get bitter towards the
[30:27] Lord because I had a I had a craving
[30:29] which is a natural craving to be married
[30:31] have a companion but my mistake was
[30:33] getting bitter towards God about it
[30:36] this is unprepared my mistake was being
[30:39] bitter towards God for two years I was
[30:41] just upset quietly I never said it over
[30:42] the pulpit and I said I don't understand
[30:44] she heard Henry get married at Young
[30:48] ages I'm the firstborn I should get to
[30:50] get married first
[30:52] Lord there's a secession here there's a
[30:55] there's an order isn't there
[30:58] bringing up all these things
[31:02] Lord so I got bitter I said Lord you
[31:06] know I'm getting old here I'm 26 years
[31:07] old
[31:10] I thought that was old back then
[31:13] what what a dummy
[31:17] and and I'm telling you and so then when
[31:19] I realized my bitterness I had to bring
[31:22] it to the altar of God and I had to be
[31:24] willing to say Lord
[31:27] if you should choose like Paul in the
[31:29] Bible if you should choose that I would
[31:32] serve the rest of my life without a mate
[31:34] I want to I'm going to say this and only
[31:37] God knows if you mean it from your heart
[31:39] I am ready and prepared to serve the
[31:42] Lord the rest of my life as a single
[31:47] good and when God knows you you mean it
[31:50] because I had to become completely
[31:52] satisfied there are marriages that get
[31:55] married because they're craving a bunch
[31:58] of stuff and some of that stuff should
[32:01] get fulfilled in God I don't know why
[32:04] I'm saying this this morning but you
[32:05] better take hold of it
[32:07] whatever I'm laying down you better pick
[32:09] up
[32:11] there are a lot of marriages that got
[32:12] married and their full satisfaction
[32:15] wasn't in the Lord yet they're looking
[32:17] to that girl they're looking to that guy
[32:19] for thirst that they have within them
[32:22] and they're going to learn after they
[32:24] get married some people they learn later
[32:25] on no no wait a minute she can't fulfill
[32:28] that he can't fulfill that that has to
[32:31] come from the Lord
[32:34] and I got married people saying amen
[32:37] I got married people saying amen right
[32:39] now that's been married for years it has
[32:42] to be about your thirst going to the
[32:44] Lord for your thirst first
[32:46] what if that mate dies what if they go
[32:48] what if things change then is it all
[32:51] over as you're walking see things can
[32:53] change it has to be your thirst it's
[32:56] fulfilled in God first
[32:58] and when you are going to that Fountain
[33:01] you're there's a satisfaction there's a
[33:04] peace there's a rest I would go on with
[33:06] God if I as job said though God slay me
[33:10] though God slay me yet I'll trust him
[33:12] take my kids take my family and that's
[33:16] what happened and he says the his wife
[33:18] said Curse God and die get it over with
[33:20] give up but he himself had a revelation
[33:23] though God slay me and take everything
[33:25] away I will not curse God I will serve
[33:29] him the rest of my life with all of my
[33:31] heart
[33:32] there's a man that's satisfied with his
[33:34] walk with the Lord
[33:36] take everything away from him and he's
[33:38] still intact
[33:39] somebody say Amen this world take
[33:41] everything away and he's still intact
[33:44] amen
[33:47] Hallelujah
[33:49] how many would pray for more marriages
[33:51] like that
[33:52] amen
[33:54] so
[33:56] in this message thirst
[34:00] it's related to relationships in our
[34:02] life broken relationships
[34:04] as you peel back the layers
[34:07] someone has a thirst for love and
[34:09] attention and they never got it marriage
[34:11] problems marriage divorces family split
[34:14] UPS
[34:15] peel back the layers that's why when I'm
[34:17] doing any kind of looking at this I'm
[34:19] saying I'm sitting back looking at where
[34:22] where was The Thirst and I'm saying
[34:24] early on in the marriage did some needs
[34:27] not get met
[34:30] from the Lord and from their mate
[34:32] because there is a certain level of
[34:34] meeting your other mate's needs instead
[34:36] of your own and jumping in and being
[34:38] Christ with them and giving love to them
[34:40] even when they're unlovable
[34:43] fulfilling their needs
[34:45] there's a certain truth to that can you
[34:47] say Amen I peel back the layers of
[34:49] broken relationships someone has a
[34:51] thirst for love even as a young boy or a
[34:54] young girl
[34:55] thirst for attention and they never got
[34:57] it they're crazy when I enter a marriage
[34:58] like that I'm talking about
[34:59] relationships now enter a marriage like
[35:02] that there's still a craving they never
[35:04] got it they're still craving for
[35:06] something I'm wanting something then
[35:07] they get disappointed because they're
[35:08] not getting it all through their mate
[35:10] either because they're those to get it
[35:12] from the Lord or because that other mate
[35:14] is not sensitive to their needs and so
[35:16] they're not trying to meet that at all
[35:17] so it becomes a very cold thing over the
[35:19] years you might be on fire the first few
[35:21] years of your marriage but then it
[35:22] becomes cold because why still some need
[35:25] is not being met some craving is down
[35:28] there God made us the way that we are
[35:31] and you can't deny that can you say Amen
[35:33] so he goes into thirst and he says we
[35:35] have natural thirst from God we got a
[35:38] thirst for uh he says we have a thirst
[35:41] in us for success and that's a god-given
[35:43] thirst did you know that there's a
[35:45] thirst in us to be successful
[35:49] now look at the world and all the
[35:51] counterfeits that they have to show you
[35:54] this is Success take a woman and so now
[35:57] she don't get success anymore out of
[35:58] raising her children
[36:00] right that's the greatest success
[36:02] she got all these gifts and talents like
[36:05] my wife and like a lot of all women have
[36:07] gifts and talents you see and so and so
[36:10] but it can be misdirected that I'm not
[36:13] getting satisfaction into this so this
[36:14] is more important than this no it'll
[36:16] never be more important you see you have
[36:18] to look at what God
[36:20] values as success in life success
[36:25] fulfill your gifts do do whatever God
[36:27] you and your husband decide to do unto
[36:30] the will of God but don't ever buy into
[36:31] the LIE of this society that I'm going
[36:33] to drink from that Fountain because
[36:35] that's what they say a successful woman
[36:37] is
[36:38] he also says that it's in a woman thirst
[36:42] to be pretty there's nothing wrong with
[36:44] a woman wanting to be pretty
[36:47] that's not in a man
[36:49] and it shouldn't be
[36:54] if it's in a man who want to be pretty
[36:56] something's desperately wrong
[36:59] but it's a god-given thirst in a woman
[37:03] to want to be pretty
[37:06] amen
[37:07] Brothers don't ever knock that you're
[37:10] not going to be that way she is
[37:12] so this you're doing this and she's
[37:14] changing things and she goes into the
[37:16] deposit and there's hundreds of dresses
[37:19] in there and she says I don't have
[37:21] anything to wear today
[37:23] we'll never understand that don't try to
[37:25] understand it
[37:29] it's about how she looks and she should
[37:31] once again I get back the way it should
[37:33] be you should be wanting to be pretty
[37:35] and brother Brian says this in the
[37:36] message if you listen it's for your
[37:38] husband
[37:39] not other men
[37:42] you've crossed the line if it's for
[37:44] other men
[37:45] and other women you say do women dress
[37:48] for other women oh yeah they do it's a
[37:50] competition
[37:51] they dress for other women too
[37:54] never supposed to be that way it's for
[37:55] your husband and you young girls that
[37:57] are single it's unto the Lord be modest
[38:00] and just these things be pretty all you
[38:02] want to but under the guidelines of the
[38:04] scripture that he gave be pretty it's in
[38:06] your natural I never want you to be
[38:07] something different and so then I'm
[38:09] going on that's why I'm asking to read
[38:10] the sermon or listen to the sermon
[38:12] because there's so much in there about
[38:14] your sisters in the dress and things
[38:15] because what he's saying is that you
[38:17] have The Thirst but Satan has got you
[38:20] all these fountains to drink from of
[38:22] what's modest and what's not and what's
[38:25] pretty
[38:26] and it's pervert it's a perversion to
[38:30] pervert your view of pretty
[38:34] it says thirst for beauty for women a
[38:38] thirst for Success there's a bunch of
[38:39] them in there
[38:41] um a thirst for Fellowship he says it's
[38:44] not strange for a guy and a girl to want
[38:48] fellowship and commandship and get
[38:49] married that's a thirst God gave you to
[38:52] be married
[38:53] and to have Fellowship there's a thirst
[38:55] sentence for Fellowship and it's a
[38:57] god-given thirst
[38:58] I love fellowship with the Saints I love
[39:00] Fellowship because God put it in me
[39:02] nothing wrong with that but it's when
[39:04] Satan has other fountains to drink from
[39:07] that pervert
[39:09] the pure place that we're supposed to go
[39:12] to fulfill these thirsts Amen brother
[39:15] Paul
[39:18] he said in thirst though one place he
[39:20] said a man get out what makes them and
[39:23] this is this is something deep I want to
[39:24] get into here it's only 20 after 12 so
[39:27] we're doing good
[39:30] notice this about thirst a man get out
[39:32] what makes a man get drunk
[39:35] brother Brian's going to give reasons
[39:36] for a man getting drunk that we don't
[39:38] think of
[39:40] it's going to be about The Thirst it's
[39:42] not going to be about he did something
[39:44] wrong oh he's drinking he gets drunk
[39:46] he's destroying his family he's doing
[39:47] this we look at what he's doing trying
[39:49] to correctly stop drinking
[39:52] he gives the inner reason is because
[39:54] he's worried and tore up
[39:57] there's something lacking in him
[40:02] so nobody ever talks about what the
[40:04] man's lacking or that he needs the
[40:06] Fountain of Christ to come to that to
[40:09] fulfill what's lacking we only talk
[40:10] about his drinking brother Brown even
[40:12] mentioned one of the temp preachers who
[40:14] became an alcoholic and he's he actually
[40:17] hinted that we should be careful of
[40:18] criticizing a man like that because he
[40:21] turned to something I did not hear
[40:23] Brother Brown said he doesn't have the
[40:24] Holy Ghost all this does that we say all
[40:26] the time we can say those things but he
[40:28] was trying to once again point out the
[40:30] man got under trash he got under certain
[40:32] things it drove him he became drinking
[40:35] he'd become alcoholic he's entering the
[40:37] pulpit and he's drunk
[40:39] terrible terrible thing should never
[40:41] happen but it did and he says but if we
[40:43] understood where he came from and where
[40:46] he got there
[40:47] you see that's what the mature people we
[40:49] need to be what's the need Jesus looks
[40:52] beyond our faults and sees our need we
[40:55] need to be that way looking beyond the
[40:57] fall and seeing the thirst what's The
[40:59] Thirst where is he lacking he's worried
[41:02] he's tore up and he's worried and tore
[41:03] up because he's lacking something I was
[41:05] at males here not ongoing I was up there
[41:07] on an interview and then it was told in
[41:09] this that talking about drinking and I
[41:10] told them that my father drank and said
[41:13] what made him drink I said I don't know
[41:15] he said is because that there was
[41:18] something that he wasn't satisfied that
[41:21] wasn't satisfying him and he thought he
[41:23] could drink to throw it off his mind I
[41:26] caught it right then see it was really
[41:28] God was the only thing can satisfy that
[41:30] thirst God himself is the only thing can
[41:32] satisfy that human for her thirst
[41:34] is to accept God
[41:38] he's looking at the thirst
[41:40] instead of the problem
[41:45] and so with that as a precedence we have
[41:47] to look
[41:48] he says something's lacking in that
[41:50] person
[41:51] it starts that way
[41:53] then he's worried and tore up
[41:55] he will seek what the world has to
[41:59] he will seek what the world has to offer
[42:04] to ignore or put off
[42:09] The Thirst that he's feeling he'll seek
[42:11] a counterfeit in the world
[42:13] and we had some alcoholics delivered
[42:15] here in this congregation we have
[42:16] alcoholics we have drug addicts
[42:18] we have people sitting here that's been
[42:20] delivered
[42:22] you can hear their testimonies I want to
[42:24] hear them
[42:25] I want to hear God's Deliverance
[42:27] but it's not complicated how they got
[42:29] Deliverance it's simple they found the
[42:32] Fountain of Living Water
[42:34] amen
[42:36] there's a need there's a craving and
[42:40] a lot of times when someone's ignoring
[42:42] the need it becomes obvious to everyone
[42:43] else but him but her that they're not
[42:46] addressing the real problem he started
[42:48] drinking he should he should not have
[42:51] done that but drinking but but you see
[42:54] the the he's drinking and he's drinking
[42:56] from the wrong thing
[42:59] you people within our assembly and
[43:01] others that are listening with
[43:03] long-standing issues since you were a
[43:05] kid
[43:08] some of you when are you going to start
[43:10] drinking
[43:11] what I'm preaching
[43:15] you're still coming but when are you
[43:17] going to start drinking what I'm
[43:18] preaching
[43:19] because it's drinking
[43:21] what I'm preaching
[43:22] that will be your answer
[43:25] no matter how impossible it looks
[43:29] people ignore and neglect the real
[43:30] problem
[43:32] can you say Amen I know it's not a
[43:34] shouting service but shout amen anyway
[43:37] amen we've got to find the need can you
[43:39] say many we can't ignore and neglect the
[43:42] real problem I'm thinking of a very
[43:44] hilarious moment a couple weeks ago when
[43:46] I realized for weeks on end my son
[43:48] Gideon is driving around town and to
[43:50] church and in my driveway and everything
[43:52] and he's got the loudest Muffler problem
[43:54] that I've ever heard and he continues to
[43:58] go for Weeks driving this ignoring
[44:00] paying for the problem
[44:03] yes and then at his birthday he wanted a
[44:07] certain set of headphones I went and got
[44:09] him for him because I'm a good dad and I
[44:11] got him the headphones and he still has
[44:13] the noise coming out of his Muffler and
[44:15] it Dawns on me while we're sitting in
[44:16] the truck and we got a good laugh out of
[44:18] it I know why you want these headphones
[44:20] noise cancellation headphones
[44:25] that he can continue to ignore the
[44:28] problem and not pay for it come on
[44:31] if he has noise cancellation he can be
[44:34] in that car listening to the music and
[44:37] he doesn't have to hit the muffler but
[44:39] all the rest of us still do
[44:41] because he's ignoring his problem
[44:44] now we're laughing but some people over
[44:47] and over again in their life they got
[44:49] some headphones and they're ignoring
[44:52] problems in their life
[44:56] they're ignoring it
[44:58] they've got noise cancellation
[45:00] headphones and they're everybody's
[45:03] looking around saying shouldn't you
[45:05] address that problem shouldn't you have
[45:08] maybe come to the Altar and ask
[45:09] repentance it got things right from God
[45:11] with God
[45:12] shouldn't you be everybody it's obvious
[45:14] to everybody else but the muffler's
[45:16] sounding loud to everybody
[45:18] to a wife to a husband the muffler is
[45:21] out of control it's terrible and it's
[45:24] destroying the whole family and
[45:27] everybody's sees it but he or her
[45:31] praise the Lord
[45:33] so we can see our downfall in this that
[45:35] even around the message
[45:37] is to think the person's problems
[45:39] started
[45:40] when they turn to drinking or they turn
[45:42] to pornography
[45:44] what a shame when we just only look at
[45:47] that as being the problem
[45:51] it is a problem it's tragic it's one of
[45:54] the most
[45:54] filthy detrimental things you could do
[45:57] to a wife Brothers I'm going to tell you
[46:00] straighteners and anything more adultery
[46:02] and going to another woman and seeking
[46:04] looking at the body of another woman
[46:06] that way it's detrimental to
[46:08] relationship into your life but I can
[46:10] tell you it's not just the only issue
[46:14] there is a thirst not being fulfilled
[46:20] there's a craving there's a hunger
[46:23] something's not being addressed
[46:28] people say our problems started with
[46:31] this when this happened in our marriage
[46:32] our our debt started when we bought this
[46:35] car it all started it didn't start there
[46:39] praise the Lord
[46:41] our debt everything started right then
[46:43] and not necessarily you know if the debt
[46:47] came it probably started with a heart
[46:49] that said I want it no matter what
[46:52] got a thirst for something
[46:55] and so this all accumulates all the debt
[46:57] now we've got to do this we got to do
[46:58] that we're a mess and so now but you're
[47:01] looking at the problem and we're
[47:03] preachers we're preaching at the
[47:04] problems and correct this and do that
[47:07] but we've got to look at The Thirst
[47:09] that's in man and say there's a fountain
[47:12] open in the House of David and I would
[47:14] rather have people come and fulfill and
[47:17] get satisfaction for the craving in
[47:20] their heart
[47:22] then just correct things on the outside
[47:28] most times it didn't start with the car
[47:30] that you bought or didn't start with
[47:33] this or that the other it started when
[47:34] someone was not loved enough somebody
[47:36] was craving something some need was not
[47:39] being satisfied that husband and wife
[47:41] was never loved for who they are when
[47:43] they were a child
[47:44] very possible this happens over and over
[47:46] again very possible we have to find our
[47:49] full satisfaction in the Fountain of
[47:51] Life from God and then when we have it
[47:54] then we are seeking to meet the needs of
[47:56] others letting that flow out of us to
[47:59] them can you say Amen we drink and God
[48:02] meets our deepest need for love and
[48:04] approval how many believe that we drink
[48:06] from his Fountain and he meets our
[48:08] deepest need for love and approval and
[48:10] then out of us this river flows to
[48:12] others and meets the need of others can
[48:15] you say Amen so the other day there was
[48:17] this girl that was posting online the
[48:19] other day a bunch of stuff critical of
[48:21] the preacher's critical of the message
[48:23] and taking a stand for those who left
[48:26] the message and things and and so I was
[48:29] listening to it all and some of it I
[48:31] could have got on and corrected it
[48:32] wasn't scriptural what she was some of
[48:34] the things she was saying and I just
[48:36] kept listening listening you know what I
[48:38] said this person is craving something
[48:40] that never got Met she's found an
[48:42] audience online she's found somebody to
[48:44] listen to into you know and she's got
[48:46] she's got a platform now to share all
[48:49] this stuff and that's fine that's that's
[48:50] the that's a problem sure that's that's
[48:52] probably out of balance but but I can
[48:55] look each side and say there's a there's
[48:56] a real bitter person here
[49:00] some need was not met way way back and
[49:04] she thinks it's fulfilling it correcting
[49:06] everybody and correcting the churches
[49:07] and everything no wait a minute wait a
[49:08] minute wait a minute there's a knee not
[49:10] being met
[49:12] because you wouldn't have to do that you
[49:13] would have to gather an audience online
[49:15] you wouldn't have to express and do all
[49:17] this stuff to you know you don't have to
[49:19] do that because you're confident in the
[49:20] Lord
[49:22] oh I'm trying to help people I'm trying
[49:24] no no no sometimes it's just you want
[49:26] attention
[49:28] craving for the attention you never got
[49:31] from somebody
[49:33] praise the Lord everybody
[49:37] I wrote this back in 2008 I typed this
[49:39] out
[49:40] 2008 I found it last night
[49:45] as we enter 2008 I see a world plagued
[49:48] by dissatisfaction Hollywood and other
[49:50] entertainment companies can't keep up
[49:52] with the demand to produce new pleasures
[49:55] and new things people live in constant
[49:57] dissatisfaction Satan is the God of this
[50:00] evil age he is given the nature of
[50:03] running to and fro how many knows Satan
[50:04] runs to and fro seeking who may devour
[50:07] but the other meaning to that he has
[50:09] given the nature of running to and fro
[50:10] never settled never at rest
[50:13] always running Satan's nature
[50:16] running to and fro
[50:20] that Spirit comes from Satan never
[50:22] settle down never restful
[50:24] this satisfaction is the cause of
[50:26] depression sometimes and sicknesses no
[50:29] one is content sometimes it's the cause
[50:30] of uh literal sicknesses physical
[50:32] sickness sometimes
[50:34] no one is content
[50:36] I said to my wife we live in times where
[50:38] it pressures us to neglect the simple
[50:40] things and the important things and
[50:42] pursue new things all the time
[50:44] oh
[50:46] this is convicting B2 we live in a time
[50:49] where we're pressured to neglect simple
[50:52] things and important things and pursue
[50:54] new things all the time
[50:56] we're in a tailspin laodicean age is an
[50:59] age of replacement an alternative for
[51:01] real things it replaces real joys in God
[51:04] and real pleasures in God I teach the
[51:06] young people something about lust lust
[51:08] is Never Satisfied there is the lust in
[51:10] the world first John 2 the lust of the
[51:13] eyes and the lust of the world but then
[51:15] there's your own individual lust and it
[51:18] says in James it is uh James and so your
[51:21] own individual lust I express it this
[51:23] way is a mistress who's constantly
[51:25] wooing you away from what you have to
[51:28] what's out there
[51:29] it draws you away your individual lust
[51:33] draws you away from what you can't have
[51:34] and what you shouldn't have and takes
[51:36] you away with from what you already have
[51:38] it tells you you're not happy you're not
[51:40] satisfied you need to get that out there
[51:42] that's like Satan but in God's kingdom
[51:45] is rest contentment peace satisfaction
[51:48] and Lasting joys
[51:51] this lust draws us away all the time
[51:53] there's the end time in the end time
[51:55] there's a falling away there's a drawing
[51:57] away there's a pulling down this makes
[51:59] us weak and cast doubts in our mind
[52:01] there's nothing that that there's
[52:02] nothing that's going to satisfy us but
[52:04] that's a lie of the enemy there is
[52:06] satisfaction in the Lord
[52:08] we must learn in this Satan's eating how
[52:10] to come back to God and to his god-given
[52:13] fountains and drink from them there is
[52:16] something that satisfies even today
[52:18] Satan wants us to draw us away from that
[52:22] amen
[52:24] I read the text in proverbs 4 5 there it
[52:26] says drink from your own Wells
[52:29] don't drink from a stranger's Wells
[52:31] don't drink from another Fountain and
[52:34] then he goes into the husband and says
[52:36] God's given you a well of that wife for
[52:39] your passions don't drink from another
[52:41] well
[52:42] don't drink from a strange woman enjoy
[52:45] the wife of thy youth
[52:48] so God has god-given Wells to fulfill
[52:52] your god-given thirst and he says don't
[52:55] drink from the other Wells drink from
[52:57] the ones God gave you
[53:01] for every thirst within us God provides
[53:03] a pure well for that thirst to drink
[53:05] from we have so many thirsts within us
[53:07] some we don't even understand The Thirst
[53:09] within us but they are there and God is
[53:11] sensitive to the hunger and the desire
[53:13] of man if there is a deep call there's a
[53:15] d if there's a deep call to the if
[53:18] there's a deep call to the Deep then
[53:20] there's a deep to respond
[53:22] after looking at link to the set of
[53:24] scriptures in proverbs 4 I find God
[53:26] expressing how critical it is for us to
[53:28] enjoy the well he provides be content to
[53:32] be satisfied and with a warning there's
[53:34] no need to drink from the other Wells if
[53:36] you do there's only depression and
[53:37] unhappiness and bondage and breaking up
[53:40] of families we're in a desert
[53:42] spiritually in these times how many
[53:43] knows we're in a desert there is a
[53:45] fountain open in the House of David the
[53:48] pure message set by the prophet is God's
[53:50] response to our hunger and need for
[53:52] these times it's funny how that that it
[53:54] is not good enough for people anymore
[53:56] funny how we don't need to listen to it
[53:58] anymore when we seek satisfaction in
[54:00] anything else it just don't satisfy like
[54:03] God can satisfy for every first there is
[54:06] also Wells from the world sometimes many
[54:08] different choices those Wells are made
[54:11] to be much more alluring from the
[54:13] outside when we focus off of god-given
[54:15] wells and drink a little from those
[54:18] other ones we will start to experience
[54:19] frustration dissatisfaction nervousness
[54:22] a lack of peace confusion and feeling
[54:25] overwhelmed
[54:27] life loses its Simplicity the world's
[54:30] Wells are kind of like a drug they give
[54:32] you a high or a buzz a feel good then
[54:35] they drop you again
[54:38] but in God's fear joy in God and thus in
[54:41] life is being happy and content with
[54:44] what God has provided for us happiness
[54:46] is not what we own or knowing a lot of
[54:49] people or having a lot of likes online
[54:54] there's not fullness in that or being
[54:57] good looking to everybody or being have
[54:59] a following on the internet happiness is
[55:02] not what we own or knowing a lot of
[55:03] people it's being content with what
[55:05] Lottie has given us in life this applies
[55:07] to money and everything every good and
[55:10] perfect gift comes from where comes from
[55:12] the father above those are good and
[55:14] perfect gifts that he gives us they're
[55:16] not they're not dissatisfying gifts that
[55:19] they're perfect gifts God gives us what
[55:21] we need not what we want can you say
[55:23] Amen his gifts are perfect for us but
[55:25] what a shame when we don't settle with
[55:27] them and enjoy them we tend to always
[55:28] look for a new Fountain to drink from
[55:30] God's provided quenching is not a
[55:33] temporal high it's not a flashy excuse
[55:35] me it's not as flashy but it's not
[55:37] fleshly but they are a consistent Joy a
[55:40] deeper Joy you don't crash or have a
[55:43] hangover or plunge your depression with
[55:45] God's satisfaction or a constant state
[55:48] of dissatisfaction there is a fountain
[55:51] opened in the House of David that's from
[55:53] 2008 here we are in 2000
[55:58] 22. thank you deacon
[56:02] that's in 2008. wow were there even more
[56:06] aren't we
[56:08] oh God
[56:10] forgive me
[56:11] when I jump to other things to get my
[56:14] satisfaction
[56:15] my peace is in you
[56:18] might you have given me how many can
[56:20] raise your hand this morning he's given
[56:22] me more than I deserve he's given me a
[56:25] family he's you say well I don't have a
[56:27] lot of family members he's given you a
[56:29] family here he provides what you're
[56:31] lacking and we need to look at what
[56:33] God's blessed us with and The Fountains
[56:36] that we can drink from our friendships
[56:38] and quit looking for them somewhere else
[56:41] we should be a people who is at peace
[56:44] who's satisfied who's not Restless I
[56:46] know where my soul is today
[56:49] I love that song he says Be Still My
[56:51] Soul Be Still My Soul that's what David
[56:54] said and my soul is at peace I've been
[56:56] washed in the blood of the Lamb I'm
[56:58] going to the other side in a Rapture I
[57:00] know where I stand can you say amen and
[57:02] then God gives me all these other Wells
[57:04] to drink from that are true Wells from
[57:07] my thirst a husband a wife a Godly
[57:09] husband a god wife and if not that some
[57:12] companions that are spiritual
[57:14] nourishment to me God provides what's
[57:16] lacking and I'm so thankful for it and
[57:19] I'm at peace with it
[57:22] totally satisfied
[57:24] I'm not like Satan running to and fro
[57:27] constantly Restless
[57:31] 2008 I said that
[57:34] when the Holy Ghost comes inside
[57:38] out of your belly shall flow rivers of
[57:40] living water and then the Thirsty can
[57:43] come and drink and you say Amen
[57:45] out of our belly shall flow rivers of
[57:47] Living Waters then the Thirsty can come
[57:49] and drink now
[57:51] I'm taking a last turn here
[57:55] taking it deeper you ready to go with me
[58:00] I wonder if this subject today fits into
[58:03] Romans 12 what we are studying Wednesday
[58:05] night
[58:06] and I'm going to go there because as I
[58:09] said that's the relationship that Paul
[58:11] began to describe in the church and how
[58:13] we should treat one another
[58:16] after the book of Acts then it comes
[58:18] into Romans I'm going to continue on
[58:21] when I preach this month
[58:23] uh for some of you new ones I try to
[58:26] take most of the month of October off to
[58:27] rest that's why we're having different
[58:29] ministers I I only speak a couple times
[58:32] this month
[58:34] brother Diggs is with us next Sunday
[58:36] morning and Sunday night
[58:38] but as I get to this series more we're
[58:40] going to go more and more into
[58:42] relationships after Redemption and be
[58:44] specific but um on Wednesday we really
[58:47] enjoyed out of Romans 12.
[58:51] uh said you know we present our bodies
[58:54] of Living Sacrifice and he comes down to
[58:55] verse 9 says Let Your Love be without
[58:57] hypocrisy dissimulation so we we got
[59:00] into love that's expressed with tainted
[59:04] with hypocrisy and I was kind of on a
[59:07] little bit on that that there's
[59:09] something is in us and we cannot hold
[59:12] back from anyone if it's in us and so
[59:16] it is selfish not to give what we have
[59:18] to others and to all others
[59:22] um
[59:23] so that's the first reason it is selfish
[59:26] to hold back love
[59:29] that we say we have
[59:31] it is selfish to hold it back from
[59:33] certain ones
[59:35] and give it to others
[59:38] and second of all the love of God does
[59:40] not have a shutoff valve
[59:43] or is it a well that runs dry it never
[59:45] runs dry
[59:47] or is it a river that stops running it
[59:49] doesn't ever stop running
[59:51] I'll get to in a minute brother Brian
[59:53] says this is an inexhaustible Fountain
[59:55] of Life
[59:57] it'll never run out
[59:59] and it says it's flowing through you
[1:00:02] so I was talking about this love and you
[1:00:05] know there's other things he says in
[1:00:06] chapter 12
[1:00:07] verse 10 be kindly affectionate one to
[1:00:09] another this is all relationships how we
[1:00:11] deal with one another so I was reading
[1:00:12] it again yesterday say Lord you want me
[1:00:14] to go into this and study a little bit
[1:00:16] more in teaching so I just kind of
[1:00:18] skipped over that part I'll get back to
[1:00:20] it Lord willing I skipped over to
[1:00:22] chapter 13 and verse 8.
[1:00:25] and I was pretty stumbled at how this
[1:00:28] was I've read it before hundreds of
[1:00:30] times no doubt but I really was
[1:00:33] wondering about this it says Romans 13
[1:00:36] and verse 8 you still so I got your
[1:00:37] attention a few minutes
[1:00:40] says oh no man anything
[1:00:43] but
[1:00:45] love to one another
[1:00:48] for he that loveth another hath
[1:00:49] fulfilled the law there's about three
[1:00:51] different subjects there the last one of
[1:00:53] course is is that if you're trying to
[1:00:55] satisfy the requirements of the law if
[1:00:57] you got Divine love and you're doing
[1:00:58] letting that flow from you you're going
[1:01:00] to satisfy the law automatically because
[1:01:02] that's the Fulfillment of the law
[1:01:06] Jesus said that love God with all your
[1:01:08] heart so mind and strength and love your
[1:01:10] neighbors yourself and he says on this
[1:01:12] hinges all the rest of the law
[1:01:15] if you did those from a Divine love you
[1:01:18] don't have to worry about the rest of
[1:01:19] the law that covers it
[1:01:21] simplifies it doesn't it but this oh no
[1:01:24] man anything and I've preached on this a
[1:01:26] little bit and taken that part about not
[1:01:27] being in debt and brother Branham
[1:01:29] comments he says it's the last days it's
[1:01:31] the end time he said you got any
[1:01:32] lingering debts he said I'm not talking
[1:01:34] about your house he says you need to pay
[1:01:36] your debts and get them out of the way
[1:01:37] and we've encouraged people through the
[1:01:39] years don't get in a lot of debt the end
[1:01:41] times here don't be re you know go get
[1:01:43] into but but you need to actually have a
[1:01:45] program to get out of debt and get
[1:01:47] released of debt
[1:01:49] and so that's what is that's that's what
[1:01:52] we take from it is that oh no man
[1:01:54] anything
[1:01:56] so the the command one writer says the
[1:01:59] command to oh no man anything should not
[1:02:02] necessarily be read as a command to
[1:02:04] Christians never to borrow money for any
[1:02:07] reason
[1:02:08] that's not what it means the sense of
[1:02:10] the Greek is that we should not let any
[1:02:11] debt remain outstanding that we should
[1:02:14] not keep on owing anyone for anything in
[1:02:16] other words ignoring the debt
[1:02:19] you've made a promise some people don't
[1:02:21] realize as Christians you sign a thing
[1:02:23] for a loan you sign that at Speedway you
[1:02:26] sign the credit card you sign a
[1:02:29] signature to promise to pay that
[1:02:31] you made a covenant and you should pay
[1:02:34] it
[1:02:35] now we have a day of bankruptcy
[1:02:36] bankruptcy actually originated in the
[1:02:38] Old Testament law that every seven years
[1:02:39] could refresh and everything could be
[1:02:41] written off but in the and they took
[1:02:44] those laws and replied them today but we
[1:02:46] got thousands of people declaring
[1:02:48] Millions declaring bankruptcy today it's
[1:02:50] because they don't have any control over
[1:02:52] the credit card debt so every every few
[1:02:53] years they ring it all up declare
[1:02:55] bankruptcy wipes it off chapter 11 wipes
[1:02:58] it off and they start getting the credit
[1:02:59] cards again they haven't solved the
[1:03:00] problem
[1:03:02] The Thirst
[1:03:04] right so I don't think it's right unless
[1:03:07] that law is set for people who lose
[1:03:10] their job and they have no way to pay
[1:03:12] that back for a long period of time even
[1:03:14] Christians still feel like Lord I don't
[1:03:16] want to I don't want to have to do this
[1:03:17] because I I need to pay that someday and
[1:03:20] that's what a lot of Christians do I'm
[1:03:21] not able to do it now and that's what
[1:03:23] that law is for to declare I'm not
[1:03:25] making anybody feel bad for declaring
[1:03:26] bankrupts but if you have to but it's
[1:03:28] abused in the world
[1:03:31] chapter 13 is better because chapter 13
[1:03:34] says I'm arranging with all my creditors
[1:03:36] to pay a certain amount and if they
[1:03:38] agreed to that amount I'm going to pay
[1:03:39] that amount so you make an arrange it so
[1:03:41] that's better than saying chapter 11. I
[1:03:43] want it all wiped out so I can go get
[1:03:45] some more stuff
[1:03:46] that's wrong Christians oh no man
[1:03:49] anything you made a promise you need to
[1:03:51] pay it back and if it takes you 10 years
[1:03:53] to pay it back you need to pay it back
[1:03:55] you people that owe rent on your house I
[1:03:58] mean it's a little pastoral correction
[1:03:59] that's what I hear come back sometimes
[1:04:01] you all ran on your house you haven't
[1:04:02] paid that somebody read you need to pay
[1:04:04] your rent you agreed to pay your rent
[1:04:06] and you need to pay it you bring it
[1:04:08] first of all you bring a bad testimony
[1:04:10] on Christianity when you don't pay it
[1:04:13] you go to a school or you owe this to
[1:04:15] school fees or whatever else you need to
[1:04:17] pay that and if you can't the rest is
[1:04:18] when I owed you go and talk to them and
[1:04:20] say I've got I pay my tithes I pay this
[1:04:22] here's my budget I'm being open with you
[1:04:24] I'm going to do my best to give you this
[1:04:26] amount until I pay this off you go talk
[1:04:27] to them
[1:04:31] good because that's what Christianity
[1:04:34] does
[1:04:35] and so that's usually how we preach this
[1:04:38] but remember now uh we have to look at
[1:04:42] the scripture deeper
[1:04:49] let me finish what he says here about
[1:04:50] money that may uh that may be understood
[1:04:53] as a requirement to always pay what we
[1:04:55] owe in a timely manner according to
[1:04:57] whatever agreement we have made with the
[1:04:58] lender or put another way it it's not
[1:05:01] to not live lives of constant dependency
[1:05:04] borrowing or unreliable in truth however
[1:05:08] Paul is not primarily concerned with
[1:05:11] money here listen Paul is not primarily
[1:05:13] concerned with money here as the
[1:05:15] following verses will show he wants to
[1:05:18] talk about our obligation as followers
[1:05:21] of Christ to love other people
[1:05:25] he wants to talk about our obligation as
[1:05:27] Christ follows to love other people
[1:05:29] including our neighbors he seems to say
[1:05:32] that loving others is a debt we will
[1:05:35] never pay off
[1:05:38] now when I read that and I read the
[1:05:40] scripture again I said is he really
[1:05:42] saying that
[1:05:45] can you put it up again hold it up there
[1:05:47] is he really saying oh no man anything
[1:05:50] but you will always owe love to one
[1:05:54] another
[1:05:56] you always be in debt you'll always have
[1:05:59] an obligation to share the love you say
[1:06:02] you have within you you will always and
[1:06:05] never hold that back and you say amen
[1:06:07] and that's how we need to look alive I I
[1:06:10] have a debt to this person or I have a I
[1:06:12] have a a satisfaction I have a a deposit
[1:06:16] that I can make I can give this person
[1:06:19] we give people money but it's not money
[1:06:21] this is the Eternal Divine love of God
[1:06:23] that we hold within us and we owe that
[1:06:26] to everyone that we meet
[1:06:31] so anybody who gets this attitude which
[1:06:34] is today is that I don't know anybody
[1:06:36] anything and they don't owe me nothing
[1:06:38] right so I'm My Own guy and my own man
[1:06:42] I don't owe anybody anything and they
[1:06:44] don't owe anything to me I don't really
[1:06:46] need them you got a carnal mind that you
[1:06:49] got that from the world I don't care if
[1:06:50] you attend this church that's a carnal
[1:06:52] mind
[1:06:53] because if you have the Holy Ghost and
[1:06:55] divine love within you you are indebted
[1:06:57] to the rest of the body of Christ in
[1:06:58] this world in other words you'd have a
[1:07:01] right to hold back what you have it's to
[1:07:03] be given to others
[1:07:05] and you will always that it never ends
[1:07:08] you will always be saying you will
[1:07:10] always have that there you need to it's
[1:07:14] funny thing it's a funny thing how late
[1:07:16] I'm preaching here
[1:07:17] it's a funny thing how he says don't owe
[1:07:20] in relationships if you owe somebody
[1:07:23] something sometimes it creates tension
[1:07:26] in the relationship
[1:07:29] you owe Uncle Bob money
[1:07:32] that you haven't paid him for 10 years
[1:07:34] and you're across the Thanksgiving table
[1:07:37] and you can't help wondering what he's
[1:07:39] thinking about you and what you're
[1:07:41] thinking about him and you haven't paid
[1:07:44] that money back to Uncle Bob yet so
[1:07:46] money not owed or things old things
[1:07:49] promises you made in relationships can
[1:07:51] create tension
[1:07:53] so now with money or anything else
[1:07:55] everything else we say when you come to
[1:07:58] relationships don't owe them anything
[1:08:01] you might owe them an apology and you
[1:08:03] haven't done it for 20 years
[1:08:07] get all that cleared out get all clear
[1:08:10] make it right and don't owe him any
[1:08:12] money don't owe him anything but don't
[1:08:13] you dare go to the place and say I don't
[1:08:15] know anybody I don't owe them they don't
[1:08:18] know me we have no connection with one
[1:08:21] another oh yes you do
[1:08:23] mom oh you Christians raise your hand
[1:08:28] I don't have to connect with anybody I
[1:08:30] don't want to oh yes you do
[1:08:33] you say you have Divine love here and
[1:08:35] you read your Bible and you're a
[1:08:37] Christian you have something that says
[1:08:39] it must be given to others
[1:08:46] I don't know I don't know them anything
[1:08:47] well that's good but you owe him love
[1:08:52] I don't know maybe it's not new to you
[1:08:54] but that's new to me and I stand
[1:08:56] corrected I'll tell you
[1:08:58] I stand corrected I never seen that in
[1:09:00] the Bible before I'll admit it publicly
[1:09:02] over the Internet I've never seen that
[1:09:04] scripture that way the only part I've
[1:09:06] seen was that I need to get out of debt
[1:09:09] but I didn't realize that I will always
[1:09:11] owe the love of Christ to everybody that
[1:09:14] I meet
[1:09:15] and when I meet them I'm I'm obligated
[1:09:18] to make a deposit for their need
[1:09:25] other than that it's selfishness I got
[1:09:28] what I got I don't need anybody else
[1:09:30] doesn't work
[1:09:41] we are in debt for others we owe we're
[1:09:43] obligated that stumbled me till I
[1:09:46] realize what we have within us so the
[1:09:49] answer God gave me is this John chapter
[1:09:51] 7 verse 37 and 38 where he cries and
[1:09:55] said if there's any thirsty in the last
[1:09:57] day let him come and drink and the next
[1:09:59] Christine says out of the Believers will
[1:10:01] flow rivers of Living Water can you say
[1:10:04] Amen and it cannot be stopped up it
[1:10:07] cannot you can't turn the the faucet off
[1:10:10] if there's a thirst and there's a need
[1:10:12] there is a fountain and it's not at
[1:10:15] church as such it's in us and it must
[1:10:17] flow to everyone at all times under any
[1:10:21] circumstances
[1:10:23] this River of Love must keep going
[1:10:26] there's no end to it
[1:10:30] there's no restrictions to it
[1:10:33] brother Brian says here's my
[1:10:35] interpretation of him about being the
[1:10:36] water he is the inexhaustible Fountain
[1:10:39] of Life you'll never ask him too much
[1:10:41] you can never believe him for too
[1:10:43] greater of things he Delights in you
[1:10:45] believing him for great things how many
[1:10:48] can say amen he Delights in you
[1:10:50] believing for great things
[1:10:53] well he's in the exhaustible fountain
[1:10:55] you can't ask too much of God
[1:10:57] and so now he Delights in you believing
[1:10:59] for him for great things you can never
[1:11:01] overdo it could you imagine a little
[1:11:03] fish about a half inch long way out
[1:11:05] there in the middle of the ocean say now
[1:11:06] wait a minute I better think this over a
[1:11:09] little fish saying wait a minute I
[1:11:11] better think this over where's
[1:11:14] Ellie she's sleeping
[1:11:17] a little fishy
[1:11:20] Kylie Ellie a little can you imagine a
[1:11:23] little fishy in the ocean
[1:11:25] saying now wait a minute I better think
[1:11:27] this through
[1:11:31] I better think that's true I better
[1:11:32] drink very sparingly of this water
[1:11:34] because I might run out this year
[1:11:38] well if you could figure that out then
[1:11:40] try to exhaust the Fountain of God's
[1:11:41] goodness to you
[1:11:45] could you just imagine a little mouse a
[1:11:47] half inch long under the big Garners of
[1:11:49] Egypt saying I'll just eat one grain a
[1:11:51] day I better allowance myself to one
[1:11:53] great a day because I might run out
[1:11:55] before the new crop comes in oh my
[1:11:57] what's he doing he's depriving himself
[1:11:59] that's exactly what's the matter with
[1:12:01] the church today in taking Church Creeds
[1:12:03] and dogmas and trying to suck off of
[1:12:05] them instead of taking the word of God
[1:12:06] and enjoying the fullness of the baptism
[1:12:10] of the Holy Ghost and the things of God
[1:12:16] you can't restrict the inexhaustible
[1:12:19] Fountain of God there is no faucets to
[1:12:22] it there is no stop to it it will keep
[1:12:25] flowing until the Rapture and none of us
[1:12:28] need to stop up that flow
[1:12:31] don't be like a little stupid fish
[1:12:33] that's saying I really need to think
[1:12:35] this through I mean I need to take this
[1:12:37] sparingly no not the things of God it's
[1:12:40] not sparingly a matter of fact he says
[1:12:41] when you ask ask for big things because
[1:12:44] we serve a big God
[1:12:47] blessed be his name not like the little
[1:12:50] mouse who says oh I better I just need
[1:12:52] one no no no no but think big think big
[1:12:55] I serve a big God and you can't restrict
[1:12:58] this and now if you apply it to yourself
[1:13:00] as I'm closing this bride the spirit and
[1:13:03] the bride say come to this Fountain can
[1:13:06] you say amen and if it's flowing through
[1:13:08] you then you're saying come to the needy
[1:13:11] come to the ones who need something come
[1:13:14] to those that are thirsty you can come
[1:13:16] if you're thirsty to me because I have a
[1:13:19] river within me we can't stop up that
[1:13:23] River and hold it back from certain
[1:13:25] people we can't do it friends
[1:13:28] does your life say come
[1:13:33] does your life say come to the needy
[1:13:37] to all others in our lives does it say
[1:13:40] come
[1:13:41] does your life stay calm or does it say
[1:13:43] stay back
[1:13:46] off
[1:13:48] don't mess with me
[1:13:50] I know I'm preaching some conviction to
[1:13:52] some of you this morning
[1:13:53] does your life always say come
[1:13:57] or to some people who doesn't say stay
[1:13:59] back
[1:14:02] stay back
[1:14:05] she knows that's her work I don't know
[1:14:07] where she learned it from but sometimes
[1:14:09] you come up to her she says stay back
[1:14:14] we're not supposed to say stay back
[1:14:16] our lives are supposed to say come
[1:14:21] right well they look at this earring in
[1:14:22] their ear and look at this they look
[1:14:24] like the drugs of society Our Lives
[1:14:27] should say come
[1:14:29] here the guy in church and they said
[1:14:31] this and the other churches are saying
[1:14:33] this about me
[1:14:34] and
[1:14:35] I don't want to fellowship with any them
[1:14:37] anymore I'm finished with that church
[1:14:41] Our Lives should say come
[1:14:44] right if they're not saying come that's
[1:14:46] up to them but our life should say come
[1:14:49] there's no faucet to this that we shut
[1:14:51] off
[1:14:52] come
[1:14:53] the spirit and the bride say if there's
[1:14:57] anybody thirsty whosoever will let me
[1:15:01] tell you as God simplifies this message
[1:15:03] that he sent to us over and over again
[1:15:05] he just simplifies it more and more and
[1:15:08] more and more for me I'm just saying
[1:15:10] it's just simple
[1:15:11] the fountain's been opened up the seals
[1:15:13] have been opened up the fountain's been
[1:15:15] opened up we are recipients of that
[1:15:17] Fountain it's within us
[1:15:19] and now at that last moment you can't be
[1:15:22] a more thirsty world with people with
[1:15:24] more needs and their answer is the
[1:15:27] Fountain of Living Waters there is no
