[13:33] world. I just get just the pressures. It

[13:37] and more. Sometimes you wonder. It's
[13:40] like you just question question things.
[13:42] But you know what's done in your soul,
[13:44] right? But you understand the pressures
[13:46] outside. It's just getting more and
[13:48] more. But then there's a day coming when
[13:50] that when we'll see our Lord's face

[14:10] change. Hallelujah.
[14:12] Praise God. It makes me excited this
[14:14] morning. I I was reading uh it was this
[14:17] morning and this week, but it's an older
[14:20] hymn, but I love the words to it. Once
[14:22] it was the blessing. Does anyone know
[14:23] that song? Once it was the blessing.
[14:26] pull that song up and I'll attempt to
[14:28] sing it. So, if you know it,
[14:35] I think it was key of Eflat.
[14:40] Once it was the blessing,
[14:45] now it is the Lord.
[14:50] Once it was the feeling,
[14:55] now it is his word.
[15:01] Once his gift I wanted,
[15:06] now the G.
[15:10] Once I sought for healing,
[15:15] now himself alone. Hallelujah. Oh, all
[15:21] in all forever.
[15:25] Only Christ I'll sing.
[15:30] Everything
[15:32] is in Christ.
[15:35] Christ is everything.
[15:38] Hallelujah. Oh, once was busy planning,
[15:44] now distrustful prayer.
[15:49] Once was anious care. Aren't you glad
[15:53] this morning? Now he has the care. Yes,
[15:58] Lord. Oh, once was what I wanted.
[16:04] Now what Jesus says. Thank you Lord.
[16:09] Once was constant asking
[16:14] now to ceaseless praise. All in all
[16:19] in it all forever.
[16:24] Only Christ I'll sing.
[16:28] Everything
[16:30] is in Christ. Christ is everything. Yes,
[16:36] Lord. Oh, once was ceaseless holding.
[16:42] Now he holds me fast.
[16:47] Once was constant drifting.
[16:52] Now my anchors cast. Hallelujah. Oh once
[16:57] for Christ I waited.
[17:02] Now his coming care.
[17:05] Oh, once I longed to see him. Oh, now
[17:11] he's been undead. All in all,
[17:16] all in it all forever.
[17:21] All Christ I'll sing. Oh, everything
[17:27] is crying
[17:30] Christ is. Can we sing that chorus
[17:32] again? All it all go
[17:35] all in it all forever.
[17:40] Only Christ I'll sing.
[17:44] Everything
[17:46] is in Christ and Christ is last one.
[17:51] Last verse. Oh
[17:54] it was a mystery.
[17:58] How a secret friend.
[18:02] Oh, once it was in heaven,
[18:07] now in falling man. Oh, once I hoped in
[18:14] Jesus.
[18:16] Hallelujah. Now I know he's mine.
[18:21] Once I thought he loved. Hallelujah. Now
[18:25] I am. Now I am his bride. All in all,
[18:31] all in it all forever.
[18:35] Oh only Christ.
[18:38] Oh yes, Lord. Oh everything
[18:42] is in Christ and Christ is everything.
[18:49] Wow. Praise the Lord. I didn't even know
[18:52] that last line in there. Pull up that
[18:53] last verse.
[18:55] Pull up that last verse again. Once I
[18:58] sought once I thought he loved me. Now
[19:00] there's no question about it. Now I am
[19:03] his bride. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.

[25:45] Quick one before I sing this song. I
[25:47] just want to give a a thank God for
[25:49] healing my voice. It's been three weeks,
[25:51] two weeks, but I'm I'm back again. So,
[25:54] thank God I'm still getting back up
[25:56] again. But the testimony I have before I
[25:58] sing this song was what happened
[25:59] yesterday.
[26:01] And um if you know, my wife has a little
[26:03] business she does where she does um uh
[26:06] baked goods at the farmers market. Every
[26:07] Saturday we go there. But yesterday was
[26:09] very different. I had a dream before we
[26:12] left in the morning and every time God
[26:15] gives me like a caution I'm kind of
[26:17] watchful. So I was kind of watchful like
[26:19] what's going to happen like brother said
[26:21] if when God shows you a dream ahead
[26:24] is already give me a victory and with
[26:26] that you just have to watch your
[26:29] environment. So, we got to the farmers
[26:30] market and um I had to get some things
[26:32] and my wife, she was there were all set
[26:33] up and then there was this LGBTQ
[26:37] man or woman, I can't tell, next to us
[26:40] who was also a vendor. And she um he or
[26:44] she um was trying to set up, but my
[26:46] wife, you know, the kind of person she
[26:48] is, she's trying to help the person cuz
[26:51] they have some items, they didn't
[26:52] arrive, right? So, she called me and
[26:54] said, "Why you out? Can you get this
[26:56] item for this person and buy?" So I went
[26:57] Dollar to Dollar Tree, bought some
[26:58] things, but before I came back,
[27:00] something happened. While they having
[27:02] conversation,
[27:03] um they got to the point to where my
[27:06] wife told the person, "Sir,
[27:08] and he or she got mad and then started
[27:11] cursing and that I'm a woman. I'm a B
[27:14] woman, but has pants on, look like a
[27:17] man, voice like a man, everything." and
[27:21] he got into a little conversation, but
[27:24] he was shouting and you know and you
[27:27] know calling her you guys wear skirts
[27:29] and you know just trying to get at a
[27:31] person and what she stand for you know
[27:34] and but I was not there at that point in
[27:36] time by the time I came back you know I
[27:38] brought the item and said you can give
[27:40] it to the person I was like okay I'll
[27:42] talk to him so she called my wife called
[27:44] the person and said hey um I apologize
[27:47] the be, you know, even though she was
[27:50] not at fault cuz, you know, she just
[27:53] wanted to have a good conversation like,
[27:55] you know, I said it's your choice if you
[27:56] want to be there, but I don't know
[27:57] whether you're s ma, but still for her
[28:02] to step back and go talk to the person
[28:04] even though they were wrong all the way.
[28:07] And then when she gave her the the cups
[28:09] she needed and she was like, "Do you
[28:11] really want to give me that cup?" And
[28:14] cuz I'm sure that that person's never
[28:16] seen anybody like that. who is wrong but
[28:19] we've still come to you and said I'm
[28:20] sorry I don't I don't mean I don't want
[28:22] to also have that kind of conversation
[28:24] you can have this too so that took them
[28:27] back a little bit I'm sure I told my
[28:29] wife that's going to make that person
[28:31] think all night
[28:33] &gt;&gt; and it talks about and I just and so
[28:34] last night I was talking to my wife and
[28:36] we just in the kitchen she was working
[28:37] and I was just thinking you know
[28:41] they don't know any better
[28:43] &gt;&gt; but if they know better they will do
[28:44] better but that's all they know and They
[28:47] just need someone that will show them
[28:48] the love of Christ. You know that will,
[28:50] you know, that love will change them and
[28:53] make them think. And you don't know
[28:54] whether they God's children.
[28:56] &gt;&gt; So I want to sing this song. We will be
[28:57] Jesus this morning. Amen.
[29:10] He came home for from work last night to
[29:14] find that she was gone.
[29:17] Now he's spending days for Sunday
[29:21] sitting in the pew alone.
[29:26] There are whispers all around him. His
[29:30] heart's breaks in two.
[29:34] He's wondering, "Would we reach out and
[29:38] help him make through? Who will be Jesus
[29:46] to him?
[29:49] Who show the love that restores
[29:54] him again?"
[29:58] He doesn't need a judge. He needs a
[30:03] friend.
[30:05] Who will be Jesus
[30:10] to him?
[30:26] She has a reputation
[30:30] like the woman at the well.
[30:35] The only love she ever kn is the kind
[30:39] she buys and sells.
[30:42] But a thirsty heart is searching
[30:46] for a love that will be true.
[30:51] The Savior cries for her to see himself
[30:56] in me and you will be Jesus
[31:02] to her.
[31:06] Who show the love that's commanded in
[31:11] his word?
[31:15] She's seen in us. The mighty God we
[31:19] serve.
[31:22] Who will be Jesus
[31:26] to
[31:42] reus
[31:46] to them?
[31:49] who show the love that restores them
[31:54] again.
[31:58] They do not need a judge. They need a
[32:03] friend
[32:05] who will be Jesus
[32:10] to the end.
[32:13] Who will be Jesus
[32:18] to the vain?
[32:35] Thank you. God bless you all this
[32:37] morning. Brother Michael, that was just
[32:38] uh just beautiful. Boy, I could think we
[32:41] could just close and go home. And
[32:44] enough's been said. Amen. Maybe we could
[32:47] just stand while we're uh getting
[32:50] started here.
[32:53] Here we go.
[32:56] Trust we're doing well on this fall
[32:59] morning.
[33:03] Let's see here. Could we open up our
[33:05] Bibles to the book of John, chapter
[33:09] 1? I had on my heart earlier in the week
[33:12] to to speak on the uh subject of the
[33:14] Godhead which um when you hear that you
[33:18] kind of have a tendency oh no what a
[33:22] deep theoretical
[33:24] abstract um topic and that's exactly um
[33:29] it should be anything but that and I
[33:32] just say brother Michael's sermon
[33:34] revealed what the what the doctrine of
[33:35] the godhead is. Are we willing to be God
[33:38] and flesh to somebody? That is the
[33:40] point. And the sermon in a nutshell is
[33:43] the devil has done everything to make it
[33:44] anything but that to make the doctrine
[33:48] of godhead any abstract to make it
[33:51] theoretical but not practical. Um John
[33:54] chapter 1 and verse 18 believe it is.
[34:01] Yes.
[34:03] No man hath seen God at any time.
[34:08] And that is the problem because how can
[34:12] you have a relationship with someone you
[34:14] can't see? You don't even know where
[34:17] they are. No man hath seen God at any
[34:20] time. That is the that that kind of
[34:23] encapsulates the problem that we as
[34:26] humanity have. Um we have a need we have
[34:29] a need for a God, but no man's ever seen
[34:32] God before. So we're kind of uh up a
[34:34] creek as it were.
[34:36] But the only begotten son which is in
[34:39] the bosom of the father, he hath
[34:42] declared him. So the point of Jesus's
[34:45] ministry was to make God tangible to us,
[34:49] to make God visible to us. God wanted to
[34:53] bridge the gap so that he became part of
[34:55] our world so that we could become part
[34:57] of his world. That is what we're also
[35:00] called to do today. Let's just pray.
[35:04] Heavenly Father, we just ask your
[35:05] blessing upon our service today. Lord, I
[35:07] just Lord, thank you for the for the
[35:10] Christ that was in Sister Jennifer.
[35:11] Lord, Lord, what a what a what a
[35:14] difficult situation, Lord. And that
[35:15] could have gone all kinds of different
[35:17] ways, but my what a ministry of Christ,
[35:20] Lord. She just showed that, Lord. And I
[35:22] just thank you for that testimony, Lord.
[35:24] I thank you, Lord, that how much we can
[35:25] learn from that. I pray oh God that you
[35:27] would help each one of us to look
[35:29] outside of ourselves to see the needs
[35:31] around us Lord and may we just be a
[35:34] channel that you would work through oh
[35:35] God we ask your blessing on this service
[35:38] in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. You
[35:41] may be seated.
[35:44] So, we know the uh I mean, nobody likes
[35:46] uh having uh we can probably remember
[35:49] when we were kids at night and and being
[35:51] scared and all that and how much it
[35:53] means when mom or dad can come inside
[35:56] and and pray with us and and just calm
[35:58] things down because when we're scared
[36:00] like that, a theoretical and abstract
[36:03] God isn't what we need. That doesn't
[36:05] help. We want we cry out for a God with
[36:09] skin on it. And the God of the Bible is
[36:12] the only God with skin on it.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; Remember the story about Baal and the
[36:17] and uh the prophets of Baal and Elijah.
[36:20] Elijah's God was a God with skin on it.
[36:22] He came he came from his world down to
[36:25] Elijah's world to show that he was
[36:27] there. But the prophets of Baal, they
[36:30] served a God Elijah was was mocking
[36:32] them. You've been praying. You've been
[36:34] crying out to your God. But where is he?
[36:36] Maybe he's on a journey. Maybe he's
[36:38] maybe he's busy. Maybe he's taking a
[36:40] nap. The prophets of Baal did not serve
[36:43] a god who could come down and take on
[36:45] flesh and be and to and and and be a god
[36:48] with skin on it. So, no man has seen God
[36:51] at any time. And uh the beauty of the
[36:54] truth about the godhead is um it brings
[36:58] God with skin on it. So I want to this
[37:01] um this year is uh the 1700th
[37:06] anniversary of a uh of a important
[37:10] historical event. Um it was uh 1700
[37:14] years ago I think back in May or June
[37:17] that the council of Nika came together
[37:20] and um they uh formalized the trinity
[37:25] doctrine. Just want to take a little bit
[37:27] a few minutes here just looking at um
[37:29] what the trinity doctrine um contributed
[37:33] um to understanding of the doctrine of
[37:35] God. I think it swed more confusion than
[37:37] anything. And it's been if you read any
[37:40] uh if you read any periodicals or
[37:42] anything like that from the Christian
[37:44] press, it's uh they've been advertising
[37:46] conferences all year. Back in June,
[37:49] there was a a conference about uh about
[37:52] Nika celebrating its anniversary this
[37:55] coming week. There will be one in
[37:56] Istanbul
[37:58] uh celebrating the unity of the faith
[38:00] that came about because of the doctrine
[38:02] of n the doctrine of the trinity at
[38:03] Nika. But um here this was a this was a
[38:08] a conference of bishops that was called
[38:10] called together by Emperor Constantine.
[38:13] And uh you probably know some of the
[38:15] history, but it's basically just trying
[38:16] to um patch together a political unity.
[38:20] And uh the emperor was there. He was uh
[38:22] he was the one that actually came
[38:23] together and uh and came up with the
[38:25] wording to patch over the differences
[38:27] between uh uh those who were who who
[38:30] didn't think that Jesus was quite God,
[38:32] the Aryans, and and the other ones who
[38:34] thought it was more more two gods or
[38:36] three separate gods. and and Constantine
[38:38] came up with the saying, let's just say
[38:40] that God is one substance but uh three
[38:44] persons and um and that was able to he
[38:49] was able to to force that through and
[38:50] and patch things together. But um when
[38:54] it when I when you think about
[38:58] the the the the pride it must take for
[39:01] for human beings to try to define God.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; It'd be like an insect trying to say
[39:07] what it's like to uh to build a a house,
[39:10] to run a family, to run a country. He
[39:13] the insect has no idea about what it is
[39:15] to be a human being, to be in our world.
[39:19] And that's the same kind of jump that it
[39:21] takes for human beings to try to define
[39:24] God. And I kind of think uh the trinity
[39:28] you can you can there there are some
[39:29] they'll there can be different
[39:31] scriptures that come up and you can get
[39:33] into the weeds sometimes when you when
[39:34] you talk with it with a trinitarian. But
[39:37] I want to take a look at like a the the
[39:39] wide version, the wide angle view of it
[39:42] because I think that the trinity
[39:43] doctrine is wrong on the widest level
[39:46] possible because it gets the story
[39:49] completely wrong. In fact, it takes the
[39:52] story out completely. It would be like
[39:55] um we know the story of uh the old uh
[39:57] fairy tale Snow White and the Seven
[39:59] Dwarves and we know uh Snow White's
[40:02] there and uh she's kind of take keeping
[40:04] house for the dwarves and everything and
[40:05] they're going off to the mine doing
[40:07] whatever they do there in the mine. And
[40:09] while she's uh while she's there at the
[40:11] house, um the stepmother or wicked
[40:14] witch, whatever it is, comes and offers
[40:16] her this beautiful apple and she takes a
[40:18] bite of this apple and like everything
[40:21] falls apart and she's dead. She seems
[40:24] like is dead. What would it be like if
[40:27] the dwarves come back and they perform
[40:29] an autopsy?
[40:32] That messes the story completely up. Or
[40:35] what would it be like if you have um
[40:38] another fairy tale um Sleeping Beauty.
[40:41] She pricks her finger there on the
[40:44] spindle and is in this swoon for years
[40:47] and years and years. And finally the
[40:49] prince comes and he's stunned that this
[40:52] this woman has been dead so long. How
[40:54] could she be preserved so long, hasn't
[40:56] gone into decay? We need to find out.
[40:59] Let's cut her up and see why this is
[41:03] that story is wrong on a on on a really
[41:05] high level because it's it it's taking
[41:07] the story out.
[41:10] And that's the way the trinity is wrong.
[41:12] It it takes it's like you get together
[41:15] and um I almost put a picture of this
[41:17] upper breath. We just had breakfast.
[41:20] We're having lunch in about an hour or
[41:22] so. But be like having a a frog
[41:23] dissection and you can cut the frog open
[41:26] and and pin the skin back and you can
[41:28] start pointing out organs and you can
[41:31] have a greater under better
[41:32] understanding of the frog but you kill
[41:35] the frog in the process and that's kind
[41:38] of like what happens at Na I think you
[41:41] cut the frog open you cut God open as it
[41:44] were that says a lot that little human
[41:47] beings can do that to God but they're
[41:50] trying to dissect God. In the process,
[41:53] you take the very life out of um out of
[41:57] the one you're trying to serve. And I
[41:59] kind of look at this this drawing that's
[42:01] so uh that's so famous. It's kind of
[42:03] tries to explain what the Trinity
[42:04] doctrine is. To me, this is the frog on
[42:08] the dissection table. It's been peeled
[42:10] back. And you can kind of see different
[42:13] body parts, but you've had to take it
[42:15] all apart and you've killed God's
[42:18] influence there in the process.
[42:22] Now um if you I just want to in share a
[42:25] few quotations from a few um modern uh
[42:29] um trinitarians
[42:31] as they reflect upon the trinity. Here's
[42:33] Alistister McGrathink. He's an Oxford uh
[42:36] um theologian. He says the doctrine of
[42:38] the trinity is unquestionably one of the
[42:41] most perplexing aspects of Christian
[42:44] theology.
[42:46] And he says the phrase three persons one
[42:49] substance is not exactly illuminating to
[42:52] say the least. It obfuscates it
[42:55] confuses. When you think the ministry of
[42:58] Jesus of Nazareth when God became flesh
[43:01] it was to illuminate to become clearer
[43:04] to become one with his creation. And now
[43:08] it's all been confused. And um another
[43:11] historian said the concept of the
[43:14] persons is indeed a highly problematical
[43:18] element in the doctrine of the trinity.
[43:21] And indeed it is what you had at the
[43:23] doct at the council of Nika. You've got
[43:27] um Greek or henistic uh bishops and
[43:30] philosophers coming together and talking
[43:33] about a god from the Hebrew and
[43:36] Christian uh Bible. and they're
[43:38] approaching it from a completely
[43:40] different standpoint.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; Completely. That's why that's why the I
[43:45] could say it's it's wrong but on a very
[43:46] high level. It' be like like um Snow
[43:50] White being dissected to see what the
[43:53] cause of death is. The story is wrong on
[43:55] a really high level. It's it's
[43:57] completely wrong. Um and here's another
[43:59] this is um a um a Swiss theologian says
[44:02] it's beyond dispute that the council of
[44:05] Nika remained utterly imprisoned and
[44:08] henistic or Greek concepts, notions and
[44:12] thought models which would have been
[44:13] completely alien to the Jew Jesus of
[44:17] Nazareth and the earliest community. And
[44:20] at that council of Nika, there were some
[44:23] bishops who tried to hold to let's just
[44:26] talk about God using language that God
[44:28] gave, using just Bible text, scriptures.
[44:31] We'll see what the scripture says about
[44:33] God. And other bishops from the other
[44:35] side, they just kind of laughed and
[44:37] because they were countering the
[44:39] scriptures with with Greek philosophical
[44:43] concepts, Greek ideas. And finally these
[44:46] bishops they put the Bible aside and
[44:48] they started moving to that ground
[44:51] talking about God as a philosophical
[44:52] concept and that's when they lost it
[44:55] because they moved to the enemy's ground
[44:57] and abandoned what the word said
[45:00] and Hanskung goes on to say here in
[45:02] particular the shift from the Jewish
[45:05] Christian apocalyptic paradigm as means
[45:09] God is coming back soon that's the idea
[45:11] of the apocalyptic paradigm to the early
[45:13] church henistic paradigm had a massive
[45:17] effect. They could have gone from a
[45:18] completely different foundation from
[45:20] them from that of the Bible to
[45:22] Aristotle, Plato and those things. And I
[45:25] just want to talk the way I kind some of
[45:27] this can kind of be tricky to to follow,
[45:30] but if I were to summarize it this way,
[45:32] it's like the Greeks approached God as
[45:35] though he were a noun to be thought
[45:37] about, to be understood, to be plucked
[45:41] apart and do all kinds of word studies
[45:43] on. But the Jews approached God as
[45:46] though he's a verb to be experienced.
[45:49] God's not a noun, but God that is not a
[45:51] noun, but God that is a verb coming into
[45:55] our life to change us.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; And here's a really nice uh nice little
[45:59] book we might have in our library. I
[46:01] don't know. But uh brother Mark Strokorb
[46:04] writes, "The ancient Judeaic paradigm or
[46:06] model was dynamic. You have a God who
[46:10] leaves heaven, reveals himself on earth,
[46:12] and we don't understand how that
[46:14] happens, but it doesn't matter. It was a
[46:17] dynamic model based upon that which is
[46:19] directly revealed whether it could be
[46:22] immediately conceptualized or not. We
[46:25] don't have to understand it. God just
[46:27] comes into our world and hallelujah,
[46:29] that's enough. But the Greeks, they
[46:32] wouldn't accept it unless they could
[46:34] explain it, which is really hard when
[46:36] you have a God who's bigger than you
[46:38] are.
[46:40] This is why for the Jew, God's prophets
[46:43] were so important. They were the link,
[46:45] as it were, between God and man. How God
[46:48] would communicate. The doctrine of the
[46:50] Godhead, it's not a noun, but is a verb.
[46:53] Brother says, "What is it?" It's God
[46:55] condescending God trying to work himself
[46:59] back into his creatures that he created.
[47:01] And um I think it's 1 Timothy 3:16.
[47:05] Great is the mystery of godliness. God
[47:08] was manifested in the flesh, seen of
[47:10] angels, received up into glory, etc.
[47:13] That is what God is. That's what the
[47:16] doctrine of the Godhead is all about.
[47:18] It's a verb. God coming down into our
[47:21] world.
[47:23] So,
[47:25] you've got somebody I've used this
[47:26] example before. You got a bird lover.
[47:28] Loves going out uh looking at the
[47:30] eagles, looking at the birds. Great
[47:32] thing. Um you've also got another You
[47:35] got a bird lover who uh um might like to
[47:38] go out and he might be uh not a not just
[47:41] a a bird watcher. He's a taxiderermist.
[47:45] He loves birds, too. Well, who loves the
[47:49] birds better?
[47:51] the taxiderermist
[47:53] or the bird watcher. One of them in
[47:56] order to perform their art requires a
[47:58] dead bird. And that's kind of how I
[48:01] think a trinitarian at the doctrine of
[48:03] nysa approaches it. He wants that bird.
[48:06] He wants to be master of that bird. He
[48:08] wants to be able to explain that bird.
[48:11] But that's not how God works. We learn
[48:14] the most about God when we just look to
[48:16] him and let him reveal himself to us on
[48:21] his own terms. That is the beauty of the
[48:25] doctrine of the Godhead.
[48:28] We want a God with skin on it. God comes
[48:31] when we need him and he
[48:35] reveals himself to us.
[48:37] And I just want to think about
[48:41] the the the song that brother Michael
[48:43] sang, the the story behind the special,
[48:48] how important it is to be aware
[48:52] of the needs around us every day
[48:56] &gt;&gt; because he can I I I remember when I
[48:58] went to college um I was thinking I want
[49:00] to be a witness. I live there on campus.
[49:02] How can I be a testimony? and my
[49:04] thought, my idea how to be a testament.
[49:05] I want to be able to explain to somebody
[49:07] the Godhead, water baptism, Malachi 4.
[49:11] But you know what? Most of those college
[49:13] kids didn't even accept that the Bible
[49:16] was God's word. And it's very easy
[49:20] sometimes to flippantly answer
[49:22] questions. You know, Jesus is the
[49:24] answer.
[49:25] Got a problem? Jesus is the answer. Got
[49:27] a problem? Jesus is the answer.
[49:30] But we don't go around just spouting off
[49:32] answers until we know what the question
[49:34] is. Until we take the time to walk with
[49:37] the person a little bit. What's the
[49:39] question? What's the question? And
[49:40] sometimes just listening, caring enough
[49:43] to go out there. There's a lot of pain
[49:45] out in the world today. There's a lot of
[49:48] desire for connection. And there's a lot
[49:50] of people who are disappointed and jaded
[49:53] because they've looked for help in all
[49:54] the wrong places. and it's been wrong
[49:57] again and again and again.
[50:00] And what people want is a God with skin
[50:03] on him.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; So when we see among our co-workers,
[50:07] among our fellow students,
[50:10] eyes with pain,
[50:13] hurt,
[50:14] that's the chance to take a bit of a
[50:17] risk and lean into that
[50:21] tough day today.
[50:23] Hey, I'd love to I'm so sorry. I'd love
[50:27] to pray for you. And then follow up. We
[50:30] don't even have to go throwing Bible
[50:32] verses at him. I remember um someone
[50:35] said, "Don't talk to somebody about the
[50:38] Lord until you've talked to the Lord
[50:40] about the somebody."
[50:42] &gt;&gt; Sometimes, Sister Randy, that was your
[50:44] dad. He was came down the chapel service
[50:46] and and I I've never forgotten it was
[50:47] probably over 25 years ago. But that's
[50:50] what it takes. getting in to that
[50:53] person's world because that's what God
[50:55] did. He left the portals of heaven to
[50:59] come down into our world.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; If you want to get to know a little kid,
[51:04] how do you do that?
[51:07] You go over there, he's playing with
[51:09] trains, Thomas a train, Legos. You
[51:11] become part of his world. You get on the
[51:13] ground and you start setting it up and
[51:15] you do all that stuff. You do that. you
[51:17] become part of his world because if you
[51:19] don't do that, he'll never become part
[51:21] of your world. And that's what God did.
[51:25] He put all of the things from all all
[51:27] the things that we would say were more
[51:29] important or more glory. He pushed those
[51:30] all aside and he became part of our
[51:33] world.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; He came down was doing whatever we were
[51:36] doing. Who knows what he did with little
[51:38] kids as he was walking through Judea. He
[51:40] might have helped them build forts. He
[51:41] might he got he became part of their
[51:43] world. And that's our challenge to
[51:45] become part of somebody else's world.
[51:48] It's so easy to get so busy to see only
[51:52] our priorities
[51:54] and never become part of somebody else's
[51:57] world because the doctrine of the God
[51:59] that is immensely practical because it
[52:02] shows how God became part of our world
[52:05] so that we could be touched by him and
[52:07] God wants to do that still today in us.
[52:11] That's kind of where we're headed.
[52:16] That's what all of us adults think the
[52:18] same thing. God with skin on it. God
[52:20] with skin on it. It might sound like a
[52:22] nut to the world, but it's drawing all
[52:24] men unto him. Because when God came into
[52:28] our world, when we draw go into someone
[52:31] else's, I guarantee you, Sister
[52:33] Jennifer, that person you spoke to
[52:35] hasn't forgotten you.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Hasn't forgotten you a bit. And what
[52:40] that is, it's going to draw somebody.
[52:43] You're a puzzle. You're an enigma. They
[52:45] can't figure that out. And it's not you,
[52:47] it's God in you. But that draws cuz that
[52:51] would have been the perfect element. You
[52:53] grab the MAGA hat and you just have a
[52:55] culture war there at the there at the
[52:57] farmers market. Yeah. We're going to
[52:59] prove that we're right. Yeah. That's
[53:02] completely wrong.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; That's completely the wrong kingdom.
[53:06] Wrong priorities. Can we forget about
[53:09] those things? God cares about a human
[53:11] soul right there. That's the most
[53:13] important thing.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; So, when we're talking about the
[53:17] Godhead, many of you have probably heard
[53:18] lots and lots of sermons about the
[53:20] Godhead.
[53:21] What's the big deal? Why another sermon
[53:23] on the Godhead? I wanted to look at
[53:25] three parts. I why I think this is an
[53:27] important thing to still talk about. The
[53:29] truth of the Godhead
[53:31] shows God's heart.
[53:34] A false teaching on the gods that like
[53:36] the trinity doctrine will make it just
[53:38] something that you can puzzle about,
[53:40] think about, try to understand.
[53:43] God's much bigger than that. The truth
[53:46] of the godhead shows God's heart. It
[53:49] shows the story. And there in every
[53:52] human being, there's a thirst for the
[53:54] story. And this gives us the story. And
[53:58] it also I want to talk about the truth
[54:01] of the doctrine of the godhead shows the
[54:04] importance of the believer's position
[54:07] not just who we are but also what our
[54:10] role is in the story. It's an important
[54:13] thing God wants to be understood
[54:19] and we watch God in action to see that.
[54:21] In this message from the revelation of
[54:23] Jesus Christ series, brother Brandham is
[54:26] talking about Joseph. He's talking about
[54:28] the types and shadows. Think of Benjamin
[54:29] and the 144,000.
[54:32] And he's just he's just kind of going on
[54:34] explain the types there. And then he
[54:38] just says here, hold up, hold up. I just
[54:39] can't seem to get away from that. Seem
[54:42] like somebody's not getting it
[54:44] somewhere.
[54:46] Look, in the beginning, he's showing
[54:49] about redemption. He God wants it to be
[54:51] gotten to be understood. Let me show you
[54:54] something again. The Holy Spirit warns
[54:56] me to do this. I'm leaving my subject
[54:58] for a minute because God wants to be
[55:00] understood. When the first news come to
[55:03] glory that the son had been lost, Adam,
[55:07] did God send an angel? No. Did he send a
[55:11] son? No. Did he send anyone else? He
[55:16] came himself to redeem his lost son.
[55:21] Hallelujah. God didn't trust with no one
[55:24] but himself. God was made flesh, dwelt
[55:29] among us, and redeemed man himself.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; This shows God's heart. There's a
[55:37] problem. I'm not just imagine there's a
[55:40] problem at work.
[55:42] Wife calls. Serious problem. And then
[55:44] you go call your secretary. Hey, could
[55:46] you take care of this for me? That's not
[55:48] what God does. There's a problem. You
[55:51] push everything to the side. You go
[55:53] yourself.
[55:55] That's that's what God did. And this
[55:58] show the doctrine that God had, the
[56:00] truth of it shows God's heart. He's not
[56:02] sending someone else to redeem man. He's
[56:04] coming himself.
[56:08] Now, it's important to realize that um
[56:11] God can't be explained by any human
[56:15] model. When we try to explain God, he's
[56:19] going to come and blow up our
[56:20] explanation in some way because he's
[56:22] going to be bigger than our model. We
[56:24] can only understand God as he reveals
[56:28] himself. Now the Old Testament gave us a
[56:31] warning that um thou shalt not make unto
[56:33] thee any graven image because a graven
[56:37] image could be understood to be a kind
[56:39] of a three-dimensional model. This is
[56:42] this is God. This is the form of God.
[56:44] We're going to worship this image. But I
[56:48] think the idea of a um an image can be
[56:50] also perhaps a a mental image.
[56:53] And we need to be careful setting up any
[56:56] mental images. I think the trinity
[56:58] doctrine could be um a transgression of
[57:00] Exodus 20:4 because it is a it is a
[57:03] mental image of how um of how God how
[57:07] how we're trying to explain God. But
[57:09] it's based again on Greek philosophy,
[57:11] not scripture. And um any scriptural
[57:14] explanation of the God, it has to start
[57:16] out with God's own explanation. Here, O
[57:19] Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord.
[57:23] But um
[57:25] if we look at this a little bit because
[57:27] the Trinity model is going to say the
[57:29] Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,
[57:31] they're all God. But the Father is not
[57:34] the son. The Son's not the Holy Spirit.
[57:36] The Holy Spirit's not the father. But if
[57:37] we start looking at different
[57:39] scriptures, this model breaks down fast.
[57:41] Cuz how could Mary be found with child
[57:44] of the Holy Ghost? If the Holy Ghost and
[57:47] the father are not the same one,
[57:51] &gt;&gt; that kind of breaks apart. And um one
[57:55] God and father of all who's above all
[57:58] and through all and in you all.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; This verse says that the father is in
[58:02] you.
[58:04] But I thought that the Holy Spirit came
[58:06] and indwelt us. The scripture doesn't
[58:08] support the model.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; It's just another scripture. Isaiah 9:6.
[58:13] Who does this talk about? For unto us a
[58:15] child is born. Unto us a son is given.
[58:18] Who's this talking about? Talking about
[58:20] Jesus. It's talking about the Messiah.
[58:22] Well, Isaiah goes on and says, "And his
[58:25] name shall be called Wonderful
[58:27] Counselor, the mighty God, the
[58:30] everlasting father." Amen.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; How does that work?
[58:36] &gt;&gt; It doesn't It doesn't It doesn't match.
[58:39] Jesus will say, "He that hath seen me
[58:40] hath seen the Father."
[58:44] &gt;&gt; The Father that dwelleth in me doeth the
[58:46] works.
[58:48] It looks like a really neat diagram. And
[58:51] wow, this is cool. But the the
[58:52] scriptures don't bear it out. John
[58:55] 10:30, I and my father are one.
[58:59] And then you got the other connection.
[59:00] and the son is not the holy spirit yet
[59:02] Jesus says I will not leave you
[59:04] comfortless
[59:05] I will come to you
[59:08] how is that going to work and then
[59:11] finally in the book of acts the human
[59:13] model is completely blown up because
[59:16] when when saul was on the road to
[59:18] Damascus and um this pillar of light
[59:23] comes and knocks him off of his horse
[59:25] and um and this this this v this
[59:29] pulsating Right. And Paul's Saul's a
[59:33] Jew. He would he would associate that
[59:35] with with Jehovah from the Old Testament
[59:38] with with the pillar of fire. That's
[59:40] &gt;&gt; right.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; And then how does that pillar of fire
[59:42] identify itself? I am Jesus whom thou
[59:47] persecutest.
[59:48] Well, Saul couldn't persecute Jesus
[59:51] because Jesus
[59:53] Saul would probably have said, "We
[59:55] haven't found his body yet." Saul
[59:57] couldn't be persecuting him. But he's
[59:59] grabbing these believers. He's grabbing
[1:00:02] these guys. You're Christians. Yeah. I'm
[1:00:03] going to grab you and throw you into
[1:00:04] prison. I'm going to beat you up. I'm
[1:00:05] going to grab Yeah. I'm going to beat
[1:00:06] you. Is your dad a preacher? Yeah. Is
[1:00:08] your dad a whatever? Bum. Boom. I'm
[1:00:11] persecuting him. Have I persecuted Jesus
[1:00:14] there?
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Have I?
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; The Bible says I did
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; because the spirit of Christ is in him.
[1:00:22] So, how can how could how can the spirit
[1:00:26] of God be in this young man? It's it's
[1:00:30] bigger.
[1:00:32] The truth of God is bigger than any
[1:00:34] human model could ever be. And the truth
[1:00:37] is that the Jehovah of the Old Testament
[1:00:40] is the Jesus of the New Testament.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; And we can take a look
[1:00:47] here. We have our nice little nice
[1:00:50] little model we've been talking about.
[1:00:52] And I I saw this example when I taught
[1:00:55] geometry a couple years ago. Um they try
[1:00:58] to put the doctrine of the trinity in
[1:01:01] every kind of part of the your Christian
[1:01:03] curriculum they can. In my geometry
[1:01:05] book, we're we're studying triangles and
[1:01:07] and they say, "Hey, look, the triangle.
[1:01:09] It's a perfect example of of the
[1:01:11] trinity. It's the it's the best uh it's
[1:01:13] the strongest shape and everything like
[1:01:15] that." And I just got to think how how
[1:01:17] can I address this? But when you look at
[1:01:20] yes there's a father there's a
[1:01:21] fatherhood of God sunship of God holy
[1:01:23] ghost of God those are all offices but
[1:01:27] there's an infinite number of attributes
[1:01:32] of God. So as soon as we start layering
[1:01:34] on more attributes of God,
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; as you get more sides to a polygon, a
[1:01:40] polygon with an infinite number of sides
[1:01:42] is simply a circle.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; And I think that's the best explanation
[1:01:48] for God. He has he has more attributes
[1:01:52] than we can fathom.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; I mean, you guys who've been married for
[1:01:56] many years, do you ever discover another
[1:01:58] side to your spouse?
[1:02:00] I do. I think I've gotten to know my
[1:02:02] wife and all of a sudden she comes out
[1:02:04] of left field with another idea like man
[1:02:06] how am I ever going to get to know this
[1:02:08] lady but um and God even more God is an
[1:02:12] infinite number of attributes so I think
[1:02:15] it's better to say the circle is a
[1:02:18] better symbol of God than our
[1:02:20] explanation of this uh of this triangle
[1:02:23] if we have to build a if we feel we have
[1:02:25] to build an image of God for ourselves
[1:02:28] which one of these better captures God's
[1:02:32] unity, God's eternality, the circle
[1:02:36] does. So, going back to our question,
[1:02:38] what's the big deal? Well, God's heart,
[1:02:41] God comes himself. He entrusts
[1:02:44] redemption to no other person. He comes
[1:02:46] himself. And then there's the drama of
[1:02:49] God's plan. God wants to make himself
[1:02:54] known to us. And the true understanding
[1:02:57] of the doctrine of the godhead captures
[1:02:59] this
[1:03:01] much better than the Trinity model.
[1:03:04] Because again, the Trinity model, it's
[1:03:05] just guys around the table coming up
[1:03:09] with metaphysical concepts that they're
[1:03:12] just what can best explain. But the
[1:03:15] truth of the Godhead comes when bam, God
[1:03:18] comes and lands on the table.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; And he's much bigger than anybody's
[1:03:22] explanation.
[1:03:25] 1 Timothy 6:16 describing God, Paul
[1:03:28] writes, "He dwells in the light which no
[1:03:32] man can approach unto whom no man hath
[1:03:36] seen nor can see." This kind of also is
[1:03:41] one a scripture that captures the
[1:03:42] problem of redemption. How can you get
[1:03:45] to know God when you can't even approach
[1:03:47] unto him?
[1:03:49] No man has seen God. No man can see God.
[1:03:55] And this isn't like the Wizard of Oz who
[1:03:58] is behind the curtain and is trying to
[1:04:00] keep you at a distance because the the
[1:04:02] more mystery there is about this, the
[1:04:03] more power he has behind the curtain.
[1:04:05] No, God wants to tear the curtain down
[1:04:07] and become known. But how?
[1:04:11] This is a problem. The only way
[1:04:15] for this indivisible God to become
[1:04:20] visible
[1:04:21] is if he were to take on skin.
[1:04:25] I mean, if you were just imagine you
[1:04:27] have somebody, let's just imagine that
[1:04:30] uh that Marcus were invisible. He
[1:04:32] couldn't be seen here. Let's just
[1:04:34] imagine that. The only I so I just
[1:04:36] think, man, there's nobody sitting next
[1:04:38] to Benjamin. I'm just going to throw my
[1:04:40] coat right THERE. I GO, "WHAT IS THAT?"
[1:04:42] All of a sudden, I see there's
[1:04:46] it landed on somebody and I see there's
[1:04:48] something. I'm sorry. You worked really
[1:04:50] hard on your hair this morning and I
[1:04:51] just messed it completely up. But when
[1:04:54] God takes on skin like this, all of a
[1:04:57] sudden, I see somebody's there.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; And that's what God did. He came into
[1:05:03] our world
[1:05:05] and took on skin. That's the only way
[1:05:08] that I can see. There's somebody behind
[1:05:10] the curtain, so to speak. There's
[1:05:12] somebody there. That's the only way that
[1:05:15] God could have done that. So when God
[1:05:19] says, "Verily, thou art to God that
[1:05:20] hideest thyself."
[1:05:23] Brother Paul must have really short
[1:05:24] coats.
[1:05:32] When Isaiah writes, "Thou art a God that
[1:05:34] hideest thyself, oh God of Israel, the
[1:05:37] Savior." It's not the kind of hide and
[1:05:39] seek,
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; that's talking about, "I'm going to try
[1:05:42] to make it as hard as I can make it for
[1:05:44] him to find me. It's going to be
[1:05:45] impossible." God isn't hiding himself on
[1:05:48] purpose so that we can't find him.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Again, the drama of the plan. What
[1:05:52] little kids don't like a game of
[1:05:54] hide-and-seek.
[1:05:56] I'm out here somewhere.
[1:05:58] Hello.
[1:06:00] Then little kids run around. They love
[1:06:02] it. They love it. And all said, "Hey,
[1:06:03] there's we found them. We found them."
[1:06:06] God hides himself so that we can
[1:06:08] experience the joy of finding him. And
[1:06:11] the only way that we can find him, you
[1:06:14] know, you play hide-and-seek with a
[1:06:15] three-year-old, you have to start
[1:06:18] tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet,
[1:06:20] tweet. You're giving hints and they
[1:06:22] they're getting closer and closer.
[1:06:23] You're there. He is. That's the only way
[1:06:26] we can find God is that he comes to us,
[1:06:29] gives us little hints along the way, and
[1:06:31] then YAY, WE FOUND ONE ANOTHER. YES,
[1:06:34] that's the drama of God's plan. So when
[1:06:36] God hides himself, it's not to frustrate
[1:06:38] us.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; That is God is that's not God's
[1:06:41] intention. That's the intention of the
[1:06:43] Trinity doctrine
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; to throw a veil over there. You can't
[1:06:46] ever you can't ever figure God out. So
[1:06:48] stop. I can remember at school, I was at
[1:06:51] a Baptist school. I I I I attended there
[1:06:54] for years and we had an evangelist come
[1:06:56] through one time and after his chapel
[1:06:58] message, he took questions and answers.
[1:07:00] One of the questions that was raised
[1:07:03] from one of my uh fellow students, real
[1:07:06] sincere young lady, but she asked, "Who
[1:07:09] are we supposed to pray to?
[1:07:11] Am I supposed to pray to Jesus or am I
[1:07:13] supposed to pray to the father?"
[1:07:15] and wow what I understand why she would
[1:07:18] ask the question if you've been taught
[1:07:20] this but that's miss it just shows
[1:07:23] what's wrong with the doctrine it
[1:07:25] creates more questions than it answers
[1:07:27] the point the whole thing is God
[1:07:31] becoming tangible he wants to be known
[1:07:35] and the only way that he can be known by
[1:07:37] us is to take on a form that we can see
[1:07:41] him in brother Bran will talk about this
[1:07:43] god in morphe
[1:07:45] God taking on a form so that we can have
[1:07:48] contact with them. And that's what these
[1:07:50] kids need at night, scared to death.
[1:07:53] They're not going to be happy if you're
[1:07:55] just lying in bed. It's okay, Job. DON'T
[1:07:58] WORRY. JUST GO BACK to sleep.
[1:08:01] No, they want you to come into the room.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Sit next to them. Pray with them. They
[1:08:07] want God with skin on it.
[1:08:11] And we talked about the book of Job
[1:08:13] earlier this year.
[1:08:14] When we don't know where God is, we get
[1:08:18] nervous. And Job was like that. He said,
[1:08:20] "Behold, I go forward, but I can't find
[1:08:23] God. He's not there. I look backward. I
[1:08:26] can't perceive him. On the left hand,
[1:08:28] where he's supposed to be working, I
[1:08:31] can't behold him. And then on the right
[1:08:33] hand, I cannot see him. Where's God?"
[1:08:36] It's driving Job nuts. He He He's
[1:08:40] suffering because he can't see God in
[1:08:42] this trial. And then at the end of the
[1:08:44] book of Job,
[1:08:47] God comes.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; God comes in a way that Job can perceive
[1:08:54] him.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; It's not just this wind coming. Because
[1:08:58] inside that wind is the invisible God.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; If God hadn't come the whirlwind, if he
[1:09:04] just come,
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; you can't see him.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; You can't perceive him. You can't sense
[1:09:12] him. God came and
[1:09:15] something's here. We feel something's
[1:09:17] different. And God spoke. God came in
[1:09:20] the whirlwind so that Job could perceive
[1:09:23] God. He spoke to him so Job could
[1:09:25] perceive him. The Lord answered Job out
[1:09:28] of the whirlwind. So the whirlwind was
[1:09:32] something perceptible to our senses that
[1:09:34] was hiding God.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; That was that God coming in a form.
[1:09:41] And um some of these slides, remember
[1:09:44] brother Steven years ago I I went
[1:09:46] through a studies of the godhead that he
[1:09:48] put together and this is a I uh I
[1:09:51] plagiarized his slides here. Brother
[1:09:52] Steven footnote time stamp we've got it.
[1:09:56] Thank you so much. In the Exodus, the
[1:09:58] Lord went before the children of Israel
[1:10:00] by day in a pillar of fire to lead them
[1:10:03] in the way and by night sorry in a
[1:10:06] pillar of cloud and by night in a pillar
[1:10:07] of fire. And then when they're between
[1:10:10] the rock and the hard place, between the
[1:10:11] Red Sea and Pharaoh's chariots, in the
[1:10:14] morning, the Lord looked under the host
[1:10:16] of the Egyptians through the pillar of
[1:10:18] fire and of the cloud. The children of
[1:10:20] Israel see the cloud. They see the
[1:10:23] pillar of fire.
[1:10:26] What they don't see
[1:10:29] is God, but God's looking through them
[1:10:32] to see them.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; These are forms that God takes. And this
[1:10:38] is their way. This is God's way of
[1:10:40] making himself known to the children of
[1:10:42] Israel. God was there in that cloud. God
[1:10:45] was there in that pillar of fire. He's
[1:10:47] looking out of the pillar of fire. And
[1:10:49] he sees the children of Israel there.
[1:10:51] God has again taken on a form. God has
[1:10:54] come into their world to lead them out
[1:10:56] of their problems, out of their
[1:10:58] situations into his world. Let's take a
[1:11:02] look another example of God coming into
[1:11:05] form. is the drama of God's plan. God
[1:11:08] comes in a form. God meets us where we
[1:11:11] are in a way that we can perceive it. In
[1:11:14] the book of Judges chapter 6, here you
[1:11:16] have Gideon and he's sitting there
[1:11:19] threshing wheat uh where no one can see
[1:11:21] him hopefully because he's afraid the
[1:11:22] Midionites if they see him they'll come
[1:11:24] and get him. And it says, "There came an
[1:11:26] angel of the Lord and sat under an oak
[1:11:29] which was an Ofra."
[1:11:31] And verse 14 says, "The Lord looked upon
[1:11:34] him and said,"And then it says verse 16,
[1:11:37] "And the Lord said unto Gideon, surely I
[1:11:40] will be with thee."
[1:11:43] Who was that? Gideon looks and he sees a
[1:11:47] man.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; He sees a guy that he hasn't seen them
[1:11:50] before. A little spooky. He hadn't met
[1:11:52] him there. He doesn't know what who he
[1:11:54] is. what he is, but to him he just looks
[1:11:56] like another guy. But the scripture
[1:11:58] identifies this as an angel of the Lord,
[1:12:00] the Lord himself. God came to Gideon
[1:12:05] in a form of flesh and blood,
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; And you see more and more of these flesh
[1:12:11] and blood forms throughout the Old
[1:12:13] Testament. It's like foreshadowing. This
[1:12:16] is the way God's going to come. This is
[1:12:17] the way God likes to reveal himself.
[1:12:18] Flesh and blood form, flesh. And then
[1:12:20] finally in Jesus of Nazareth all the
[1:12:22] godhead comes right into him. Another a
[1:12:25] flesh and blood form coming upon him and
[1:12:29] it just uh it blows Gideon's mind but
[1:12:33] it's God coming in a form. Now let's
[1:12:36] take a look at our Bibles. Judges
[1:12:38] chapter 13. I don't have this one on the
[1:12:42] slides, but this is one that um captures
[1:12:47] a bit of the um confusion that someone
[1:12:50] could have when an angel of the Lord
[1:12:53] comes to them and is trying to figure
[1:12:54] out who exactly is this
[1:12:57] person I'm dealing with here. And this
[1:13:00] is when the angel of the Lord appears to
[1:13:03] um Mrs. Monoah because Monoah and his
[1:13:07] wife um they've been married many years,
[1:13:10] hadn't had any children. And verse three
[1:13:12] says, "The angel of the Lord appears
[1:13:14] unto the woman and said unto her, behold
[1:13:16] now you're barren and don't bear
[1:13:18] children, but you shall conceive and
[1:13:21] bear a son." Who came to her? The
[1:13:23] scripture says, verse three, "An angel
[1:13:25] of the Lord came to her." Now, if you
[1:13:28] skip down to verse six, um when her
[1:13:31] husband comes home from work, how was
[1:13:33] your day, honey? All of a sudden, she
[1:13:35] starts explaining what this angel of the
[1:13:37] Lord spoke to her. And they have a
[1:13:38] conversation. And verse 6 says, 'The
[1:13:41] woman came and told her husband, saying,
[1:13:43] "A man of God came unto me." That sounds
[1:13:46] a little bit more understandable than
[1:13:48] saying, "An angel of the Lord came to
[1:13:50] me." But the Bible says it was an angel
[1:13:51] of the Lord. She identifies as though a
[1:13:54] man of God came to me. His countenance
[1:13:56] was like the angel of the was of an
[1:13:58] angel of God. Very terrible. He wouldn't
[1:14:01] tell me his name. Now verse 10, uh,
[1:14:05] Monoah has prayed and he says, "It's
[1:14:07] great, God, for you to reveal this to my
[1:14:09] wife, but I'd appreciate having a
[1:14:11] revelation of it myself." That's what he
[1:14:14] prays. And God hearkened to the voice of
[1:14:16] Monoah. And the angel of God came again
[1:14:20] and um to the woman as she sat in the
[1:14:22] field, but Manoah, her husband, wasn't
[1:14:24] with her. In verse 10, the woman makes
[1:14:27] haste and ran and showed her husband
[1:14:30] said, "Look, there's the man that
[1:14:33] appeared to me the other day. He ca he's
[1:14:35] the one who came to me. How does she
[1:14:36] identify him? There's the man."
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; And then um Monoah talks to him and uh
[1:14:43] the angel of the Lord speaks to him in
[1:14:45] verse 13, verse 21. It's only after
[1:14:49] Monoah has made an altar
[1:14:53] sacrifice and this man this visitor
[1:14:57] comes he steps upon the altar and goes
[1:14:59] up in the flame and then Monoah says wow
[1:15:03] then he knows it was an angel of the
[1:15:05] Lord and Monoah says we shall surely die
[1:15:09] because we have seen God.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; So who was this an angel of the Lord? a
[1:15:15] man of God, a man who came by the other
[1:15:18] day, and then he says, "We've seen God
[1:15:20] himself."
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; They're all right.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; Because God has taken on human flesh,
[1:15:29] the angel of the Lord, that's the way
[1:15:30] that God appears in the Old Testament
[1:15:32] when God Almighty takes on human flesh
[1:15:35] to reveal himself to somebody. But he
[1:15:38] enters their world. This is just the
[1:15:41] same as if you were going down and
[1:15:44] entering the world of
[1:15:47] your son or daughter.
[1:15:49] They're struggling with something. You
[1:15:51] can say from a far, "Ah, it'll be okay.
[1:15:53] Study for your test. Next time you'll
[1:15:55] get a little better grade." That's not
[1:15:56] going to touch them. You get down on
[1:15:59] their world, I know it was a tough day
[1:16:00] today. I know you're disappointed you
[1:16:02] didn't get the score you wanted on that.
[1:16:04] You're entering their world. Only after
[1:16:07] you've made connection and are in their
[1:16:09] world are you really going to do much
[1:16:11] good. Otherwise, you're just telling
[1:16:13] them what to do. And that probably isn't
[1:16:16] going to land quite the same way. When
[1:16:20] God comes, he doesn't just come like
[1:16:22] this drone from heaven and give these
[1:16:25] commands for us to No, he becomes flesh.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; He walks with us. He he so we can know
[1:16:33] him and only then he shows us the way
[1:16:36] that we should walk into it and we do.
[1:16:38] So in the the the drama of this is
[1:16:41] throughout the Old Testament God appears
[1:16:44] to the children of Israel in many
[1:16:46] different ways. All of these are forms
[1:16:50] that God took on
[1:16:53] to make contact with his children.
[1:16:57] God becoming tangible so that God became
[1:17:01] part of their world so that they then
[1:17:04] could become part of his world. Brother
[1:17:08] Brandon puts it this way really
[1:17:09] beautifully.
[1:17:11] God raised up bodies all down through
[1:17:14] Moses, Ezekiel, Jeremiah, Isaiah,
[1:17:18] Elijah's all down where his word
[1:17:22] temporarily came.
[1:17:25] God is speaking through these different
[1:17:27] bodies. So, it's not just an angel of
[1:17:29] the Lord body like was the the God used
[1:17:32] with Gideon or he used with um Monoah
[1:17:36] and his wife, but God is appearing in
[1:17:38] other sinborn bodies. Little bits of God
[1:17:42] are coming through and that and that are
[1:17:43] hiding and their bodies are hiding
[1:17:46] little bits of God and their ministry is
[1:17:48] showing that part of God to the children
[1:17:51] of Israel.
[1:17:59] When the word was in Moses, Moses was
[1:18:02] God in flesh.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; When it was in Jesus, it was God in
[1:18:07] flesh. The only thing he did was change
[1:18:09] his mask. He didn't change his word or
[1:18:11] his nature. He's the same yesterday,
[1:18:13] today, and forever. He only changed his
[1:18:16] form. He changed from Noah to Moses,
[1:18:18] from Moses to David, from David to
[1:18:20] Joseph, on down till he comes into the
[1:18:23] fullness of the Godhead bodily. It's
[1:18:25] still the same God. The same God just
[1:18:28] taking on another veil.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; He pours himself into another mask, into
[1:18:38] another form. It's not another person
[1:18:40] going out called the Holy Spirit. It's
[1:18:42] God himself. And then after Jesus dies
[1:18:48] on Calvary,
[1:18:50] his body is broken.
[1:18:53] And amazing things happen in the Bible
[1:18:56] when things are broken.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; That woman with the alabaster uh
[1:19:02] perfume, only after she broke it is the
[1:19:06] whole room filled with the fragrance.
[1:19:08] the young man with the loaves and the
[1:19:10] fishes. Only when that bread is broken
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; does something happen.
[1:19:16] Jacob, when he's wrestling, Jacob had
[1:19:19] served God in his strength for many
[1:19:21] years and accomplished nothing. He only
[1:19:23] got in the way of God's plan. But when
[1:19:26] God breaks something and Jacob's walk,
[1:19:29] he actually makes Jacob walk better than
[1:19:33] he'd ever walked before. When things are
[1:19:35] broken, amazing things happen. And when
[1:19:38] Christ is the spirit pierces his side
[1:19:41] that lets out the spirit of God that was
[1:19:44] in him and then it pours himself into
[1:19:47] the people Christ in you. How beautiful,
[1:19:51] how wonderful to think God pouring
[1:19:54] himself into the human being,
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; into the believer.
[1:19:59] Poured out. It was a part of his drama
[1:20:03] to do so.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; Now, we're getting close to that time of
[1:20:08] year, um,
[1:20:10] Halloween.
[1:20:12] And can you imagine Satan ever doing
[1:20:16] anything like this?
[1:20:18] Satan wants to have all of his power for
[1:20:21] himself. But can you imagine Satan
[1:20:23] pouring himself out and sharing
[1:20:27] let letting himself be broken become
[1:20:30] nothing wouldn't happen. It wouldn't
[1:20:33] happen. But Christ is pierced. He's
[1:20:35] broken so that then he can be poured
[1:20:38] out. It's not the third person, second
[1:20:41] person or first person, but it's the
[1:20:42] person God veiled in human flesh. That
[1:20:47] is the that's the essence of what the
[1:20:49] Godhead is about. God being veiled in
[1:20:53] human flesh. And this really isn't that
[1:20:56] foreign of a concept.
[1:20:59] I can remember uh um after I'd met my
[1:21:03] wife um at a youth camp, it would be my
[1:21:06] goodness 16 years ago. And um I didn't
[1:21:11] have her email address yet. She had mine
[1:21:16] because there's a particular picture
[1:21:17] taken that she took at that camp and I
[1:21:19] was hoping that she would email me that
[1:21:21] picture. Then once I got the email from
[1:21:23] her, I had hers and I could reply. Um,
[1:21:26] but it took her quite a while to
[1:21:28] actually get that first email out and I
[1:21:30] was in the in the I had the blues really
[1:21:32] bad. I was waiting a whole week hoping
[1:21:34] that she would write, hoping she would
[1:21:36] write and hoping she would write. I had
[1:21:37] already composed my reply to her before
[1:21:41] she ever sent me her reply. I already
[1:21:43] had like a whole page I was ready to
[1:21:45] send to her. And and she sends this like
[1:21:48] two-line email with with the picture and
[1:21:50] I I better wait an hour or two before I
[1:21:52] send mine cuz uh might uh stretch the
[1:21:55] limits of believability. But I was
[1:21:58] hoping in that time period I was I was
[1:21:59] waiting and waiting and waiting. I think
[1:22:01] man, well, maybe she's on Facebook.
[1:22:04] Maybe she's in on social media
[1:22:06] somewhere. I wanted I wanted a picture
[1:22:07] of her. I wanted I wanted a picture. So
[1:22:10] um the only way that I could find her on
[1:22:14] Facebook is if I also became a part of
[1:22:17] Facebook. So for one week I had a
[1:22:19] Facebook account. I had to go on
[1:22:22] Facebook in order I had to take on a
[1:22:24] Facebook identity in order to try to
[1:22:27] make contact with some image of my of my
[1:22:31] wife. Well that's how it works in social
[1:22:35] media. There's a virtual reality. And if
[1:22:38] you want to become tangible in that
[1:22:40] virtual world, you have to adopt
[1:22:44] identity. They call that um taking on a
[1:22:47] skin.
[1:22:49] What kind of skin do we use in the
[1:22:51] metaverse?
[1:22:53] If you don't take on a skin in the
[1:22:55] metaverse, you're not going to be seen.
[1:22:58] You're not going to be able to interact
[1:22:59] with anybody. And that's the same thing
[1:23:01] that God did with us because he's in a
[1:23:04] the metaverse is a different dimension
[1:23:06] than us. We could say in order for us to
[1:23:08] become part of
[1:23:10] Zuckerberg's dimension, if you'd really
[1:23:12] want to go there, then you want to
[1:23:13] become part of that dimension, you have
[1:23:15] to take on a skin.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; In order for God to become our part of
[1:23:18] our dimension, he takes on a skin.
[1:23:23] Otherwise, we'd be completely invisible
[1:23:25] and unapproachable.
[1:23:28] Now in the metaverse, you choose your
[1:23:31] ski your own skin.
[1:23:33] You choose how you want to appear.
[1:23:36] You choose how people how you want
[1:23:39] people to know you. So in the metaverse,
[1:23:42] I might not be there in a coat and a
[1:23:45] tie. I might be there in a set of tights
[1:23:49] with Superman on it because that's what
[1:23:51] I want people to see me as Superman. It
[1:23:53] depends what skin am I going to take on?
[1:23:55] What do I how do I want people to get to
[1:23:58] know me? And
[1:24:01] think about it in the world that we live
[1:24:03] in.
[1:24:05] Some things that we see in our
[1:24:06] co-workers and people we have in our
[1:24:09] fellow students, people we rub shoulders
[1:24:10] with, some things are only skin deep.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; So the the rough character who's got
[1:24:17] tattoos all over himself,
[1:24:19] that two tattoo just might be skin deep,
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; no deeper. And if you were to scratch
[1:24:25] that tattoo just a little bit, you were
[1:24:26] to see another human being with flesh
[1:24:28] and blood, with hurt, with pain, who's
[1:24:32] just crying out for connection.
[1:24:35] And you think, man, who can I witness to
[1:24:37] today? Who is that? We might thinking,
[1:24:38] who's who's wondering who William
[1:24:40] Brandon is? Who who's wondering what
[1:24:42] this particular question in the Bible
[1:24:43] is? Maybe we can put those questions to
[1:24:45] this. Those are good things to think
[1:24:47] about, but is there a hurting person in
[1:24:49] our life somewhere?
[1:24:53] God
[1:24:55] whispers to people in their pleasures,
[1:24:59] but he tries to shout to them in our
[1:25:01] pains. Pain is God's megaphone to reach
[1:25:04] a hurting world.
[1:25:07] And if people are going through pain,
[1:25:08] that might just be a way for you to
[1:25:12] establish a connection,
[1:25:14] just the love of God. You don't have to
[1:25:16] go and give them a doctrinal
[1:25:17] dissertation or anything. Just show
[1:25:20] God's love.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:23] be God to them.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; We don't have to be repelled by the
[1:25:29] outward appearance. That's what the
[1:25:31] devil does. The devil tries to put all
[1:25:33] kinds of stop all kinds of intimidating
[1:25:36] things on the outward appearance so that
[1:25:38] nobody will approach them. But inside
[1:25:41] behind that all those tattoos, whatever
[1:25:43] it is, and if you have a tattoo today,
[1:25:45] no offense. Um, but inside that might be
[1:25:48] a traumatized child, a teen just
[1:25:52] reaching out, crying out for
[1:25:54] understanding,
[1:25:55] for love.
[1:25:57] That's the doctrine of the Godhead. Are
[1:26:00] we willing to become part of that world
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; and reach a heart?
[1:26:07] God was manifest in the flesh.
[1:26:12] Think about that. God limiting himself.
[1:26:15] All the powers of God. Satan would never
[1:26:18] do that. All the power of God, God
[1:26:21] leaves heaven in a sense and
[1:26:23] encapsulates himself, embodies himself
[1:26:26] in Jesus of Nazareth. He was manifest in
[1:26:29] the flesh. God condescending trying to
[1:26:34] work himself back into his creature that
[1:26:36] he created.
[1:26:42] So the a true understanding of the
[1:26:44] Godhead shows God's heart. God doesn't
[1:26:47] entrust redemption to somebody else. He
[1:26:49] comes himself.
[1:26:52] It shows the drama of God's plan that
[1:26:54] God wants to take on skin to become
[1:26:58] tangible so that we can get to know one
[1:27:01] another so that he can draw us into his
[1:27:04] world. But I want to take a little bit
[1:27:06] and close here with the idea a true
[1:27:09] understanding of that God had chose the
[1:27:11] believer's position and our role in the
[1:27:14] drama.
[1:27:16] I really like this scripture Job 10:11.
[1:27:19] Thou hast clothed me with skin and
[1:27:22] flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and
[1:27:26] sinnus.
[1:27:27] Who's the me?
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; It's not the skin and flesh. That's just
[1:27:32] the outside.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; It's not the bones and the senus. That's
[1:27:36] just the outside. What it is inside
[1:27:41] is a little bit of the invisible God.
[1:27:45] Just like God's
[1:27:48] spirit, the spirit of God came down in
[1:27:50] Jesus of Nazareth and God encapsulated
[1:27:53] himself fully in that human body. God
[1:27:57] wants to put a part of himself into each
[1:28:00] one of us
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; so that we can continue that drama of
[1:28:05] God taking on skin, God walking into
[1:28:08] Kroger's,
[1:28:10] being there, caring for the people who
[1:28:12] come every week, buy the same meat, and
[1:28:14] all of a sudden they come along as you
[1:28:15] don't look as good today. Something
[1:28:18] wrong.
[1:28:20] Make trying to bridge that gap.
[1:28:27] Colossians 1:27 to whom God would make
[1:28:30] known it is the riches of the glory of
[1:28:32] this mystery among the Gentiles which is
[1:28:34] Christ in you Phil of glory not just God
[1:28:38] in Jesus of Nazareth.
[1:28:40] He w God was incarnate in Jesus of
[1:28:42] Nazareth but God wants to be embodied in
[1:28:46] us as well.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; This is what it was on the early church.
[1:28:51] I talked about this scripture a little
[1:28:52] bit ago where the the after the day of
[1:28:55] Pentecost,
[1:28:56] God fills the believers and when Saul is
[1:29:00] persecuting the believers, he's really
[1:29:02] persecuting Jesus because those
[1:29:04] believers have the spirit of Jesus
[1:29:06] within them. Paul talks about we are the
[1:29:09] temple of God.
[1:29:12] That's a huge thing to say if you're
[1:29:15] writing to any kind of a Jewish audience
[1:29:18] because only the high priest could go
[1:29:19] into the holiest of holies. And he's
[1:29:21] saying that you are the temple of God.
[1:29:25] This is this is mind-blowing.
[1:29:27] The spirit of God dwelleth in you.
[1:29:31] You're the temple of the living God. He
[1:29:33] says some pretty amazing things here.
[1:29:36] Then in the scripture we all read for
[1:29:37] communion.
[1:29:39] He that eateth and drinkketh unworthily
[1:29:41] eateth and drinkketh damnation to
[1:29:43] himself, not discerning the Lord's body.
[1:29:47] Because like brother Paul preached last
[1:29:48] week, are we letting wrong kinds of
[1:29:51] things come too close to our city, come
[1:29:53] too close to our heart, are we aware
[1:29:56] that this is the temple of God?
[1:30:00] When we go places we shouldn't go, see
[1:30:03] things we shouldn't see, watch things we
[1:30:04] shouldn't watch, where are we taking the
[1:30:07] temple of God? Where are we? We're not
[1:30:10] deserting the Lord's body. We're not
[1:30:12] seeing my I'm the temple of the Lord.
[1:30:16] I'm part of his body even today. So, we
[1:30:20] talk about how God became flesh in the
[1:30:24] little baby Jesus who then grew up and
[1:30:28] offered himself on the cross. We can
[1:30:31] limit the they call it the incarnation,
[1:30:33] God becoming flesh. That wasn't just a
[1:30:35] one-off event 2,000 years ago because
[1:30:39] the day of Pentecost shows that the
[1:30:41] incarnation
[1:30:42] was just the beginning.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; That God was just getting started
[1:30:48] revealing himself in human flesh.
[1:30:55] Brother Bram says, "In the beginning was
[1:30:56] the word and the word was with God and
[1:30:59] the word was God and the word was made
[1:31:02] flesh and dwelt among us. Then then that
[1:31:04] same word Christ the promise the Holy
[1:31:06] Ghost says you called him the third
[1:31:08] person of the trinity that's fine that's
[1:31:09] what it is it's Christ the Holy Ghost in
[1:31:11] you he was in the pillar of fire once
[1:31:14] then he come was made flesh now he's
[1:31:17] come in your flesh
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; and I want to this is the
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; this is this next part is something that
[1:31:27] came on my heart earlier in the week I
[1:31:29] think I was lying in bed just kind of
[1:31:31] think what do we have on church on a
[1:31:33] Sunday and I remembered something that
[1:31:36] happened in our house about a year ago.
[1:31:40] And uh I just pulled this picture off
[1:31:42] the internet, but what it really is is
[1:31:45] um I was sitting on a Saturday morning
[1:31:48] um in our in our little library and we
[1:31:51] have a wood burning stove um in the
[1:31:54] middle there. And then next is my nice
[1:31:55] uh my nice chair where I like to uh to
[1:31:58] read, where I like to uh well at that
[1:32:00] point I was uh I'd been Job had been
[1:32:02] getting into chess. So he I had been
[1:32:04] playing some chess and I kept getting
[1:32:05] beat again and again and again in chess.
[1:32:08] So, I became a member of chess.com in
[1:32:10] the hopes I would finally be able to
[1:32:12] beat my son somehow and it hasn't worked
[1:32:13] yet, but um so we're playing chess and I
[1:32:17] don't know if I can disconnect these two
[1:32:18] chairs on
[1:32:21] there. So, I'm sitting there next to the
[1:32:24] fireplace,
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; concentrated very heavily on my chess
[1:32:30] game.
[1:32:36] And what I'd forgotten about was I had
[1:32:39] some wet wood
[1:32:43] and my I I the the fire was going, but I
[1:32:46] wanted to get some wood to dry out. So,
[1:32:48] I just put this this kind of rotting but
[1:32:52] damp wood on top of the wood burning
[1:32:55] stove
[1:32:56] and it's literally within arms length
[1:32:58] from me and I'm just playing chess.
[1:33:04] I don't know how long I was playing
[1:33:05] chess,
[1:33:07] but at some point my daughter comes down
[1:33:10] and says, "Dad, what's all the smoke in
[1:33:13] the house?"
[1:33:16] And I it jerked me away. Oh my goodness.
[1:33:19] We've got a problem. We've got a
[1:33:21] problem. I go ahead and quickly grab
[1:33:22] because what had happened? It was
[1:33:24] literally it was getting smoky. It
[1:33:27] smelled terrible. It was up. We have a
[1:33:29] trile, but it was up on the next level.
[1:33:31] It was We were running around all over
[1:33:32] the place. Thank goodness my wife was in
[1:33:34] bed. But we're we're throwing open the
[1:33:36] French doors. I'm letting cold air in,
[1:33:39] which I just warmed the house. This is
[1:33:41] extraordinarily wasteful. It hurts me
[1:33:43] right where it counts. Um, I'm opening
[1:33:46] windows, everything to get this thing to
[1:33:48] air out so when my wife comes down, she
[1:33:50] won't sense this.
[1:33:53] But my house was literally filling with
[1:33:57] smoke and I was completely oblivious to
[1:34:00] it. I was there. I was there in the
[1:34:03] room,
[1:34:05] but I wasn't.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; But I wasn't.
[1:34:10] And what this just kind of kind of shook
[1:34:12] me as I was thinking about it this week.
[1:34:15] We're called to be embodiment
[1:34:20] of God.
[1:34:23] But every and Satan will will will fight
[1:34:26] this in different ways. He can fight it
[1:34:28] through the confusion of the Trinity
[1:34:29] doctrine. But he can also get us to put
[1:34:32] on our social media, put in our earbuds,
[1:34:34] whatever. Ever see people walk around
[1:34:37] with earbuds? It's really just a quiet
[1:34:39] statement. Don't talk to me right now. I
[1:34:40] really don't want to be talked to. I've
[1:34:42] got stuff to do. I might be doing
[1:34:43] nothing. But these say everything.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Don't talk to me right now. We're called
[1:34:50] to be able to be available.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; If anybody is needed, okay, I can hear
[1:34:55] myself. We're called to be available. If
[1:34:58] there's pain, if there's suffering, if
[1:35:00] my kid needs something,
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; I need to be able to
[1:35:05] understand where they're at instead of
[1:35:07] just being rats. Checkmate, man. Instead
[1:35:11] of being so wrapped up
[1:35:14] in another world,
[1:35:17] sometimes the technology that is that is
[1:35:20] purports to make connection so much
[1:35:22] easier.
[1:35:24] It dis it disembodies
[1:35:27] relationship.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Relationships are supposed to be an
[1:35:30] inbody experience. You ever go to a go
[1:35:32] to the uh guided out nowadays? You've
[1:35:35] got uh go to um Olive Garden,
[1:35:39] Applebee's, wherever. You got a a screen
[1:35:41] there. The kids are on their screens.
[1:35:44] Mom and dad are on their phones and are
[1:35:46] having a dinner together. It's a a
[1:35:48] disembodied
[1:35:50] fellowship.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; But what God is calling us to in this
[1:35:54] doctrine of the Godhead, he wants us to
[1:35:58] become flesh to other people.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; And so often these technologies
[1:36:05] break that. Break that. There could be a
[1:36:08] fire going on in my house. There almost
[1:36:10] was
[1:36:12] right next to me.
[1:36:15] I was there,
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; but not really. And how many ways can
[1:36:20] there be things like that in our lives
[1:36:24] that we should be aware of? We should be
[1:36:27] right there in our kids' world, in our
[1:36:29] spouse's world, helping them, but we're
[1:36:32] there, but we're not.
[1:36:35] that is completely against everything
[1:36:38] that God has shown us in the scripture.
[1:36:40] He He becomes a part of our world.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; He's there. Jesus of Nazareth wasn't
[1:36:48] walking around God in flesh on his phone
[1:36:51] insensitive to the needs around him. He
[1:36:54] was there. He could be touched with the
[1:36:57] feelings of our infirmities. He was
[1:36:58] there to be touched. He wasn't
[1:37:01] broadcasting, "Don't talk to me right
[1:37:03] now. I'm busy." No, he wasn't doing that
[1:37:04] at all. He was there to be touched so
[1:37:07] that we could have contact with that.
[1:37:13] 12 years ago, Wall Street Journal ran
[1:37:15] this headline, "Our smartphones turning
[1:37:16] us into bad Samaritans."
[1:37:20] And nowadays, you can have uh something
[1:37:23] really bad happening to a guy further up
[1:37:26] in the subway car and either won't be
[1:37:28] seen because everybody in the doctor's
[1:37:31] office. What's the first thing you do
[1:37:32] when you get in the doctor's office?
[1:37:33] bunch of people there. Get in the
[1:37:35] elevator. There's somebody I could talk
[1:37:36] to. No, this is a legitimate reason not
[1:37:39] to say hi. They won't say hi to me. But
[1:37:41] when we're in a place where we could
[1:37:43] connect with people, we grab our phone
[1:37:46] so we don't have to.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; That's not what God called us to do.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; God calls us to be made flesh,
[1:37:55] embodiment of him, to seek contact.
[1:38:00] And here you've got our smoke ferns
[1:38:01] turning us into bad Samaritans where um
[1:38:04] something bad's happening. You don't
[1:38:05] even realize because you're in your
[1:38:07] phone. Or if it is happening, people
[1:38:08] grab their phone and film it instead of
[1:38:12] actually jumping in and doing it. We're
[1:38:14] called to be made God made flesh so that
[1:38:18] we can become part of the world, help
[1:38:20] someone in need, and not just document
[1:38:23] that we were there. Document that
[1:38:25] someone was in need. document. We know
[1:38:26] we're called not to document the God. It
[1:38:29] isn't a noun, it's a verb. We're called
[1:38:31] to go there, reach a hand, and help.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; University of Virginia today writes, "If
[1:38:39] you're reading this on your smartphone,
[1:38:40] we have some bad news for you. That
[1:38:42] thing in your hand designed to bring
[1:38:43] humanity closer together is in many
[1:38:45] respects doing the exact opposite.
[1:38:48] Smartphones are driving fissures,
[1:38:51] cracks, separations into human
[1:38:54] relationships.
[1:38:56] And then this researcher Custodian
[1:38:58] Kushlov uh has been dissecting the
[1:39:00] effects of smart phones on society. They
[1:39:02] create ADHD like symptoms and users,
[1:39:05] diminish happiness in social settings,
[1:39:08] erode trust between strangers, harm
[1:39:11] connections between parents and their
[1:39:12] children. It's working against this very
[1:39:15] idea of God and morphe.
[1:39:19] We're supposed to be God and morph.
[1:39:20] We're supposed to be little messiaets,
[1:39:23] little there to touch other people's
[1:39:25] lives. And yet, we're putting in our
[1:39:27] earbuds so we can't hear the call of the
[1:39:31] needy.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; God put us on this earth for a reason
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; so that we can extend a hand and be a
[1:39:39] help.
[1:39:41] This is a uh a painting from one of my
[1:39:43] uh favorite artists, a he's still alive,
[1:39:45] a Dutch artist. These are folks waiting
[1:39:47] in line for the uh for the subway or for
[1:39:50] the train to come and get them. What are
[1:39:52] they all doing?
[1:39:54] All on their phone. All on their phone.
[1:39:56] All on their phone. Little kid there in
[1:39:58] the front need something, but um I don't
[1:40:01] think uh mom's hearing her there. The
[1:40:03] only people who uh who aren't there are
[1:40:05] the ones who don't have uh they might
[1:40:07] have flip phones. I don't know. They
[1:40:08] might think phones are still rotary.
[1:40:10] They're they're in the middle. But if
[1:40:13] this is the way our life is, think, who
[1:40:16] could I reach out to at my work? Seek
[1:40:18] the connection. Is there somebody here
[1:40:20] that I can reach out to? Start a
[1:40:23] conversation. I'm a terrible
[1:40:24] conversationalist, but is there the
[1:40:26] world is crying out for connection?
[1:40:29] Crying out for someone to show they
[1:40:32] care. Don't let technology
[1:40:36] hinder the miracle of the incarnation.
[1:40:41] God in flesh condescending to touch
[1:40:45] lives.
[1:40:49] Paul writes, "God was in Christ
[1:40:53] reconciling the world to himself, not
[1:40:56] imputing their trespasses unto them, and
[1:40:59] he's committed unto us the word of
[1:41:00] reconciliation." God was in Christ. He
[1:41:04] was, that is undeniable. He was in
[1:41:06] Christ.
[1:41:09] But the baton's been passed. If you've
[1:41:11] received the Holy Spirit, we're not just
[1:41:13] saying God was in Christ. The truth is
[1:41:15] God's in you. God's in me. We're the
[1:41:17] carriers of the baton. Now then,
[1:41:21] we are ambassadors for Christ. As though
[1:41:25] God did beseech you by us, we pray you
[1:41:28] in Christstead. Be ye reconciled to God.
[1:41:32] not putting everything the the cross of
[1:41:35] Christ is in it's the center of our
[1:41:38] faith
[1:41:39] but God wants to be working through us
[1:41:42] and in us today drawing people again to
[1:41:47] God.
[1:41:49] God was in Christ but now then now then
[1:41:53] we are ambassadors for Christ. We pray
[1:41:55] in Christstead be reconciled to God.
[1:41:59] I think there's there's a lot of
[1:42:01] significance into the truth of the
[1:42:04] godhead. It's immensely practical. It's
[1:42:08] not abstract.
[1:42:11] The false teaching of the godhead makes
[1:42:13] it abstract. True teaching of the
[1:42:16] godhead. True teaching of any doctrine
[1:42:19] comes in is flesh in our own lives. I
[1:42:22] would say if any teaching of doctrine
[1:42:24] becomes too abstract that we can't even
[1:42:26] talk to people every day about it, it's
[1:42:28] probably becoming too abstract. We're
[1:42:31] probably getting off off basis somewhere
[1:42:33] because God has come to be understood to
[1:42:36] so that he can become part of our world
[1:42:39] so that we can become part of his world.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; That's what we're all crying out for. a
[1:42:50] god with skin on it. There's plenty of
[1:42:53] scary stuff, fearful stuff, traumatic
[1:42:56] stuff, bad things in the world today.
[1:42:59] People out there are crying out for God
[1:43:01] with skin on it. And when we're willing
[1:43:05] to be God with skin on it, it draws all
[1:43:09] men unto him.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; Let's pray.
[1:43:17] Lord Jesus, I thank you for your
[1:43:19] goodness to us. I thank you for your
[1:43:20] grace.
[1:43:22] Lord, I thank you for for leaving
[1:43:25] heaven, coming down to earth
[1:43:29] into a body so that we could know you.
[1:43:35] Lord, I thank you for how you do that
[1:43:37] person in our own lives
[1:43:40] as we came heard about uh heard about uh
[1:43:45] the gospel from a person. Somebody
[1:43:48] expressed care and talked to us, but
[1:43:51] that was you in that person.
[1:43:53] Lord, I thank you for dying on the cross
[1:43:55] for our sins, for filling us with your
[1:43:57] Holy Spirit. Lord, thank you, Lord, that
[1:43:59] we're able to privilege to be the temple
[1:44:02] of God. Lord, I pray that we might be
[1:44:04] that temple.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; And Lord, I just pray, oh Father, that
[1:44:08] is what really struck me
[1:44:11] this week as I've meditated on this
[1:44:12] thought is the the believer's position
[1:44:15] that we're called to be God with skin on
[1:44:18] it. Yet so often our communication
[1:44:21] nowadays is disembodied.
[1:44:23] We might be in a room, but we're not
[1:44:25] really there. Lord, I pray that we might
[1:44:28] your scripture talks about you being the
[1:44:30] you are a present help in trouble. Lord,
[1:44:34] help us to be present
[1:44:38] in the office, in our workplace when
[1:44:40] we're making a delivery, to be present,
[1:44:43] not to be thinking about things that
[1:44:45] haven't happened yet, but what's going
[1:44:46] to happen at the end of the day, but to
[1:44:48] be present. Help us, Lord, to slow down.
[1:44:51] Be present,
[1:44:53] Lord. I pray father for father you would
[1:44:57] lay people on our hearts Lord who with
[1:44:58] whom we work Lord who there might be
[1:45:01] pain there might be questions
[1:45:05] Lord I pray for even people in our in
[1:45:08] our midst we all come to church we we're
[1:45:10] good at flashing plastic smiles Lord I
[1:45:13] pray that you'd help us to show a care
[1:45:15] for one another that we may never have
[1:45:17] shown before
[1:45:19] Lord that we are members of your body
[1:45:22] that we could be your hands hands and
[1:45:24] your feet, Lord, that we would,
[1:45:27] Lord, be willing to have our our
[1:45:29] schedule interrupted
[1:45:31] that you could move in a special way so
[1:45:33] that you could be God revealed in our
[1:45:36] flesh.
[1:45:38] Lord, I pray, oh God, that you would lay
[1:45:41] souls in our hearts, Lord, that we would
[1:45:44] intercede to you for them, oh God, and
[1:45:47] that we could turn hearts toward you, oh
[1:45:50] Lord. I pray, oh God, that we might have
[1:45:52] the great privilege of being part of
[1:45:54] that process, oh God. And Lord, I pray,
[1:45:57] Father, that you would help us to
[1:45:59] separate from that uh everpresent
[1:46:02] technology. Sometimes it just creates
[1:46:04] more separation than it creates
[1:46:06] connection. Lord, I pray Lord if there
[1:46:09] if we've thought about uh fires might be
[1:46:11] going on in our own home, maybe not
[1:46:13] literal ones, but figurative ones, and
[1:46:16] maybe we've been too disconnected from
[1:46:17] them. Lord, I pray that we'd make it a
[1:46:20] real priority to become a part of that
[1:46:22] little world, wherever that person might
[1:46:24] be. Lord, I pray that you'd move in
[1:46:27] Jesus name.
[1:46:29] Amen.
