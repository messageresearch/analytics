[3:50] you're
[3:52] [Music]
[3:53] king of
[4:01] be Jesus
[4:03] Jesus
[4:06] [Music]
[4:09] Though a host should encamp against me,
[4:11] my heart shall not fear. Though war
[4:14] should rise against me, in this will I
[4:16] be confident. One thing have I desired
[4:19] of the Lord, that will I seek after,
[4:21] that I may dwell in the house of the
[4:23] Lord all the days of my life, to behold
[4:25] the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire
[4:28] in his temple. Every day he wanted to
[4:30] dwell in the dwelling place of the Lord.
[4:32] And that was his one desire above money,
[4:35] above riches, above business, above
[4:38] anything. We need one main desire and
[4:41] that's to stay in the presence of the
[4:42] Lord. For in the time of trouble, now to
[4:46] me, this is a prophetic t uh scripture
[4:49] for our time. And we know that in the
[4:52] history of Israel, God's people, Israel,
[4:54] the Jews, we know they they come to
[4:57] times of extreme trouble, time of
[4:59] trouble. Daniel speaks of a time of
[5:01] trouble for the children of Israel. And
[5:04] uh so we we realize that'll uh begin to
[5:07] climax towards we get to getting to end
[5:10] time events. The trouble will be that
[5:13] the whole world will surround Israel and
[5:15] come against Israel and the whole and
[5:17] armies will surround. So now when when
[5:19] David says he's feeling that there's
[5:22] armies encamped about me, Israel will go
[5:25] through the same thing in prophecy that
[5:26] they'll be encamped. the enemy will be
[5:29] encamped around. We spiritually go
[5:31] through what Israel will go through
[5:32] literally. And so then he says one
[5:35] thing, I have a desire of the Lord. And
[5:36] then he says, in the time of trouble,
[5:38] verse 5, for in the time of trouble, he
[5:40] shall hide me in his pavilion. In the
[5:43] secret of his tabernacle shall he hide
[5:45] me. He shall set me up upon a rock.
[5:48] That's that has a lot of revelation in
[5:50] it to tell us where this is at. Number
[5:52] one, it's the secret of his tabernacle.
[5:55] It's not out there publicly openly.
[5:57] It'll be a secret as to where God's
[5:58] dwelling place is. But for the people of
[6:01] God, he will show them where he is so
[6:03] that they can live in his presence.
[6:06] This last part I want to go. He shall
[6:08] set me up upon a rock. How many know in
[6:11] the Bible that rock means revelation?
[6:14] So what do we what what is our secret
[6:16] place? It's really the revelation that
[6:18] God has given us. And you know you can't
[6:20] give yourself a revelation. It comes
[6:22] directly. He told Peter, he says, "Flesh
[6:25] and blood has not revealed this. You
[6:26] didn't learn it in seminary. My father
[6:29] has given you this revelation. Satan
[6:31] can't get it. Can't get his grubby mitts
[6:33] on it. But when he gives you a
[6:35] revelation, it becomes the hiding place
[6:38] and it becomes the stability."
[6:41] Can you say amen? And now shall mine
[6:43] head be lifted up above mine enemies
[6:46] round about me. Therefore will I offer
[6:48] in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy. I
[6:52] will sing. You know what a believer does
[6:54] when he's surrounded by demon power? He
[6:57] raises his hands, his head's lifted
[6:59] above all of it and he just starts to
[7:01] praise the Lord. And then the devil gets
[7:04] more mad. Can you say, "Amen? I'm so
[7:07] glad in my trials and troubles I can
[7:09] lift my hands and give a song to the
[7:11] Lord." I want to title this today, hide
[7:13] me in the safe place of revelation. Just
[7:16] before our deliverance, just before our
[7:19] ultimate deliverance, we realize that
[7:22] the increased pressure, the armies
[7:24] gathered around us, the the pressure
[7:26] will not decrease, but it will increase.
[7:29] So much so that sometimes mentally we
[7:31] don't know if we can handle it. The only
[7:34] cry that we can cry is what David said,
[7:36] "Hide me in your secret place during
[7:39] this time." And I believe that's the the
[7:41] the place that you're living in that
[7:43] develops this rapturing faith, builds
[7:45] this rapturing faith. But we know
[7:47] there's great pressure on the outside.
[7:49] How many can say amen? There's great
[7:50] pressure on the outside. The heat has
[7:53] been turned up on the bride. Can you say
[7:54] amen? It I it it is it's it's it's in
[7:58] such an increased state that it's hard
[8:00] to fathom how much more pressure can
[8:03] come. And and I just wanted to say this
[8:05] that if that pressure is too much for
[8:07] you and you want that pressure off of
[8:10] you, then just stop standing up for the
[8:13] right things.
[8:16] If you don't if you can't handle the
[8:18] pressure of this hour, then just stop
[8:20] standing for things because a lot of
[8:22] your pressure is because you're standing
[8:24] up for something. You're standing for
[8:26] the message of the hour.
[8:28] Um, I'm going to elaborate on that a
[8:30] little bit later, but but if you if you
[8:32] don't like the pressure, stop he stop
[8:35] living a holy life.
[8:38] I want to say that it's the ones
[8:40] standing on revelation that are being
[8:43] surrounded and encamped by demons.
[8:47] The ones that are experiencing
[8:48] criticism, heavy criticism is probably
[8:51] the ones that are making a stand. And if
[8:53] you want an easy life without a lot of
[8:55] demons against you, then just be a
[8:57] borderline believer today because
[8:59] there's a lot less pressure on a
[9:01] borderline believer. But when a believer
[9:04] makes a stand for the truth and wants to
[9:06] live in holiness and live in
[9:08] sanctification and stand I believe this
[9:10] message with all my heart, get ready for
[9:12] more pressure. It's the ones that are
[9:15] making a stand that get more criticism.
[9:18] And if you can't take the heat, stay out
[9:19] of the kitchen.
[9:23] Yeah, you can release a lot of pressure.
[9:24] Can you say amen? You can get out of a
[9:26] lot of this if you don't make a stand
[9:28] for anything. And uh you can, you know,
[9:31] you can be out of a lot of it. Matter of
[9:32] fact, you can there's choices you can
[9:34] make to just release a lot of pressure
[9:36] in your life and just kind of take the
[9:38] normal uh status of this world or maybe
[9:40] a borderline believer. It'd be a lot
[9:42] less pressure than this. But once you
[9:45] begin to stand, once you begin to
[9:47] articulate and speak this message and
[9:49] speak what you believe, whatever
[9:51] environment it is, if you do that, get
[9:53] ready for more pressure. And it's not
[9:55] people as much as it is demons don't
[9:58] like somebody to make a stand. Amen.
[10:01] Amen. So, you know, and and and you got
[10:04] to take a stand for things. You think
[10:05] that the trouble in this world is the
[10:07] economy, or you think the trouble is the
[10:09] scare of war. Uh, you think your trouble
[10:12] is you don't have enough money to meet
[10:13] your bills this week. You think that's
[10:15] my trouble. I don't have enough money.
[10:16] That's not really your trouble. When the
[10:18] Bible says it's a time of trouble, it's
[10:20] not it's not that you can't meet your
[10:23] bills this week. It's a much deeper
[10:25] trouble than that. And I'm not
[10:28] belittling that trouble in your life. We
[10:29] all have trouble. But the trouble the
[10:31] Bible is speaking of is not just that
[10:33] some friend forsake you or or or you
[10:35] don't have enough money or you lost your
[10:37] job. Your trouble I as standing for a
[10:40] believer your trouble is a lot deeper
[10:42] than that. David was talking about a
[10:44] much deeper trouble
[10:46] armies encamped around him. Everything
[10:48] against him. Can you say amen? And so
[10:51] the the the scare of war and money
[10:52] trouble your your trouble is not really
[10:55] that. It's much deeper than that. The
[10:56] devil likes company. So the devil wants
[10:59] to draw you into the same gossip. They
[11:01] feel better if someone else will join in
[11:03] the gossip with them. So they they it's
[11:05] not good enough to gossip, but it's they
[11:07] want to draw you in with the gossip.
[11:09] They want to draw you into their opinion
[11:11] because they need allies. They want to
[11:13] draw you down to their lies that they're
[11:15] telling. They want to draw you to their
[11:17] concrete conclusions that may not be
[11:19] based in truth. Can I get an amen this
[11:21] morning? It's it's it's it's an effort
[11:24] to bring you down and bring you into
[11:25] their dimension and their realm. And
[11:28] they want to war with you. Sometimes
[11:29] they want to battle. They want to they
[11:31] have have a good scrap. I've said it
[11:33] before. There are people in life that
[11:35] they just like a good scrap every day.
[11:38] They like drama. They like a good scrap.
[11:41] They like a good fight. They like
[11:42] competition between families. They they
[11:45] create it because you are a creator.
[11:48] Amen. The pressure to choose sides to
[11:51] pull you down. But then I go back to
[11:54] that scripture that David said, "God is
[11:57] lifting me above all these things." Can
[12:00] you say amen? And I can raise my hand.
[12:02] and he's going to set me upon the rock
[12:04] of revelation above mine enemies. Now,
[12:07] when you say above, it doesn't mean I'm
[12:08] better than my enemies, but I'm above
[12:10] it. In other words, I can live above it.
[12:13] I can live in that secret place. I can
[12:15] live upon a rock. And I got up on the
[12:17] chair last week. I'm living up here and
[12:19] all down here. They're saying, "Come on
[12:21] down. Fight with us. Come on down into
[12:23] my fear. I'm nervous about stuff. Can
[12:25] you be nervous with me?" No, I'm not.
[12:27] I'm just praising the Lord. I will pray
[12:28] for you, but I'm not coming down to that
[12:30] level. I'm I I that you know that's not
[12:34] where I want to live. And when God is
[12:37] raising you to a to higher levels, get
[12:41] ready for more devils.
[12:44] Amen.
[12:46] That was borrowed from borrowed from TD
[12:48] Jake.
[12:50] When you want to go to the next level,
[12:52] get ready for more devils.
[12:55] Because you can't go to the next level
[12:57] spiritually unless there's a fight to
[13:00] keep you away.
[13:02] It's just the way it works. Because
[13:03] you're making a stand. You're making a
[13:05] better stand. You're making a higher
[13:07] stand. And you don't want to be brought
[13:08] down. How many would raise your hand
[13:10] say, "I don't want to be brought down by
[13:12] people living in fear. I don't want to
[13:14] be living with a Jonah." Can you say
[13:15] amen? I want to be praising the Lord all
[13:18] the time, no matter what I'm going
[13:19] through. Can you say amen? You get up
[13:21] here say, "No, I'm not coming down
[13:22] there. Why don't you come up here with
[13:24] me and praise the Lord a while? Why
[13:25] don't you come out of that fear? I just
[13:27] want to go into this prophecy of Israel
[13:29] just a little bit. The theme of prophecy
[13:30] for Israel is to in prophecy to become
[13:33] surrounded by the enemy, literally the
[13:36] world against them. And many Jews see
[13:39] and believe prophecy of deliverance.
[13:42] They believe it today that their Messiah
[13:44] will deliver them. They believe the the
[13:46] the deliverance part, but they don't see
[13:48] what comes before their deliverance.
[13:51] They don't understand that. And there
[13:53] will be great armies gather around that
[13:56] uh that uh piece of land there. And it's
[13:59] not because of the piece of land
[14:01] necessarily, but it's who's there and
[14:03] God's people. And so we see then that
[14:06] that the armies I'm going to skip some
[14:08] of this because some of some of this is
[14:10] revisiting what I've already preached on
[14:12] before, but I just wanted to bring in
[14:14] this element of Israel literally now.
[14:16] And so if you turn with me to Daniel 12,
[14:19] we'll see something happen here. when
[14:20] all the armies gather around just after
[14:23] all the armies uh in prophecy all
[14:26] surround Israel in Daniel chapter 12 if
[14:31] you turn with me there to verse one
[14:34] there's a little bit of prophecy for
[14:35] Israel here I wanted to deal with we see
[14:37] then when it comes to this trouble and
[14:40] it's called this is Israel's time of
[14:42] trouble worse than any trouble they've
[14:44] had a lot of trouble but this is the
[14:45] worst time is when all nations will
[14:48] gather against them That's right. And
[14:50] it's it's a time of trouble like never
[14:53] seen before. Chapter 12 says, "Then at
[14:57] that time," and this is a time where the
[14:59] pressure will come, "shall Michael stand
[15:01] up, the great prince which standeth for
[15:04] the children of thy people, and there
[15:06] shall be a time of trouble such as never
[15:10] was since there was a nation even to
[15:13] that same time." Now, Israel had a lot
[15:15] of trouble through the years. They had
[15:16] 6,000 years of trouble. They had times
[15:18] of trouble. They had times when they
[15:20] went in rebellion against God and they
[15:22] went into Babylon into captivity. They
[15:23] had a lot of troubling times. But this
[15:26] scripture says at the end they've never
[15:29] had any trouble compared to this
[15:31] trouble. And I just look at that
[15:33] spiritually and say that for the bride
[15:35] spiritually, there's no trouble like
[15:38] we're having now in the spiritual realm.
[15:41] There's no other pressure like we're
[15:42] having now. Right? Now you say, "Brother
[15:44] Paul, I don't know what you're talking
[15:45] about. My life is good. I'm doing pretty
[15:47] good. I got a good salary and
[15:49] everything's pretty comfortable. Um, so
[15:51] I'd only say to that, what are you doing
[15:54] right? I'd say that first, but then I
[15:55] would say check your life because
[15:58] anybody who's making a stand and that's
[16:00] the elect of God, the guns are pointed
[16:02] on you.
[16:06] It says says now the the the the and it
[16:10] talks in the Bible here, let me just
[16:12] finish this. in the time of trouble,
[16:14] such as never was since there was a
[16:16] nation, even to the same time. And at
[16:18] that time thy people shall be delivered,
[16:20] everyone that should be found written in
[16:23] the book. Notice now there's the elect
[16:25] written in the book of life. So we got
[16:28] several reasons now why the armies are
[16:31] encamped around this particular people,
[16:35] right? They're in the book of life.
[16:39] Can't you remember that when you're
[16:40] being surrounded?
[16:42] Can't you remember that? There's a
[16:45] reason that I'm being fought with demons
[16:50] probably because my name is in the book
[16:52] of life
[16:55] and I'm the elected. Can you say amen?
[16:57] And I'm part of him. Now we go to book
[16:59] of Revelations. Revelations 12:17. Just
[17:03] another small element I want to bring in
[17:05] that you would understand
[17:08] why there's an increased demonic power.
[17:12] And Satan maybe is in the time where
[17:15] he's very nervous and he's, you know, he
[17:19] doesn't understand the word. He doesn't
[17:21] understand revelation
[17:23] and he can't have what the bride has. He
[17:28] can't have it. And this is why he's
[17:30] jealous. It's why he fights against it
[17:33] to stop it. You know, you've always had
[17:36] what the devil wanted. That's right.
[17:40] With Adam and Eve, he had the creative
[17:41] power and was the ruler of this earth.
[17:43] And that's what devil wanted. From so
[17:46] from the very start, you the believers
[17:49] have always possessed by revelation and
[17:51] had it in them what the devil wanted.
[17:53] And you wonder why he's against you and
[17:55] he can never have it. That's enough to
[17:57] have a really shouting time on Monday.
[18:00] Put it on your refrigerator if you have
[18:01] to. Devil, you will never have what I
[18:04] have.
[18:07] [Applause]
[18:08] And and from the beginning, I like to
[18:10] point this out. It's like he comes on
[18:13] the scene because he's jealous of what
[18:14] Adam and Eve have. And eventually he had
[18:17] to be kicked out. You know what?
[18:19] Actually, it happened before. He was
[18:20] kicked out of heaven.
[18:23] He he got this stir with all the the
[18:25] brothers, the angels and a third part of
[18:27] the angels with influence with him to
[18:29] come against. He wanted to raise his
[18:30] kingdom. So he was jealous. He couldn't
[18:32] have the position he wanted. And so now
[18:34] he creates a ser finally they he was
[18:37] kicked out of heaven with his angels. He
[18:38] was kicked out on earth. He's kicked out
[18:40] of the garden. Even the son and daughter
[18:42] were kicked out of the garden because
[18:43] they fell with him. He was kicked out.
[18:46] Then there's tension between uh Isaac
[18:49] and uh Ishma. There's tension between
[18:51] Cain and Abel. And then then that ended
[18:54] and then there's tension between Ishmael
[18:56] and Isaac and he had to be kicked out of
[18:59] the camp. We got to get rid of cast out
[19:02] the bond woman and her son.
[19:05] And then I could go scripture after
[19:06] scripture where the tension rises, he
[19:09] gets kicked out. The tension rises, he
[19:11] gets kicked out.
[19:13] Why do you let this guy bother you?
[19:18] When he's been kicked out of every
[19:20] believer's situation from the beginning,
[19:25] if he's been kicked out all the way
[19:27] through, then why don't you give him the
[19:29] boot every now and then, all the way to
[19:32] the end when we get the book of
[19:33] Revelation and Satan and his angels will
[19:36] be cast out. The accuser of who? The
[19:38] accuser of the brethren stood there with
[19:41] tension, with accusations, keeping
[19:43] things tense all the time, accusing,
[19:45] accusing, and but but one day, one day,
[19:48] it's the same history. He's going to be
[19:49] kicked out, and you'll never hear that
[19:51] voice again. I don't know how he can't
[19:53] look in the book of Revelations and see
[19:55] his end. He's going to be kicked out at
[19:56] the very end of it. Kicked out of the
[19:58] atmospheres. Kicked out of heaven.
[20:01] Kicked off the earth so the bride can
[20:03] come back and enjoy this without the
[20:05] devil here.
[20:08] Praise God. Hallelujah.
[20:11] Give him the boot every day because he's
[20:13] used to it. When he's trying to come in
[20:15] and make you a gossiper, give him the
[20:18] boot and stop your family and say, "We
[20:20] don't do that." Because that's the realm
[20:22] the devil works in.
[20:25] Give him a boot.
[20:27] That's not you. You're teaching your
[20:29] children to be gossipers. teaching your
[20:31] children to be accusers of the brethren.
[20:34] To be accusations against elders, that's
[20:36] a serious thing. No, no, that's not the
[20:38] kingdom of God. That's Satan's kingdom.
[20:41] In the time of trouble, the time of
[20:42] trouble is our is the time of
[20:44] deliverance. And this is what he says in
[20:47] Psalms 27. In in the time of trouble, he
[20:51] will hide me. So, in this time of
[20:53] trouble is the time for our deliverance
[20:54] and a rapture. If we're surrounded by
[20:57] the enemy, ganged up on by the enemy,
[21:00] guess what? And it's if it's showing no
[21:03] relief, I I and it shows nothing in the
[21:05] prophecy for it to stop. You know, and
[21:08] the thing is is that until God steps in,
[21:11] he lets the pressure continue. He lets
[21:13] the pressure go. The only hope we have
[21:15] is a hiding place until he delivers us
[21:17] in a rapture. But we have that hiding
[21:19] place. The only thing it's doing is
[21:22] setting us up for the total deliverance
[21:24] and that's a rapture. My friends, if you
[21:26] hear the simplicity of what I'm
[21:28] expressing for my spiritual life and
[21:29] your spiritual life, the only place we
[21:32] need, the one desire we need to be in
[21:34] every day is to live in that secure safe
[21:37] place in the word. Daniel 3:8, wherefore
[21:42] at that time certain Chaldans came near
[21:44] and accused the Jews. They spake and
[21:46] said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, "Oh
[21:47] king, live forever forever. Thou, oh
[21:49] king, hast made a decree that every man
[21:51] that shall hear the sound of their
[21:52] cornet,
[21:54] uh, flute, harp, sack, butt, sultry,
[21:58] doulamer, and all kinds of music shall
[22:00] fall down and worship the golden image.
[22:04] Um, I'd like to preach a little sermon
[22:06] in here that did you notice bowing to
[22:08] the image was associated with all kinds
[22:11] of music.
[22:13] Music was used to open their emotions to
[22:16] bow to the image
[22:18] because music is used to open up your
[22:21] emotions. We use it here in the service.
[22:23] But what is it opening up your heart to
[22:26] receive?
[22:29] Right? And whosoever falleth not down
[22:31] and worshipeth that he should be cast in
[22:32] the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
[22:34] There are certain Jews whom the whom
[22:37] thou hast set over the affairs of the
[22:39] province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach,
[22:41] and Abedneo. These men, oh king, have
[22:43] not regarded thee. They serve not thy
[22:45] gods, nor worship the golden image which
[22:47] thou hast set up. Then Nebuchadnezzar in
[22:49] his rage
[22:52] point.
[22:54] This man was mad, but now he's in a
[22:57] rage. And what is he in a rage about?
[23:01] What is his in his anger increased
[23:04] about? Believers who made a stand
[23:08] against him.
[23:16] That's what it was about.
[23:18] His anger increased. His rage increased.
[23:21] I'm going to do something more now
[23:22] because I'm angry. Why am I angry?
[23:24] Because they won't join in with the rest
[23:27] and bow to the same thing. They're not
[23:30] going to bow. His rage was increased.
[23:34] Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury
[23:37] commanded to bring Shad. Can you
[23:38] imagine? We get mad at a lot of things,
[23:40] but can you imagine what this guy is on
[23:42] rage and fury about? He's against three
[23:44] believers who make a stand
[23:48] and you make a stand.
[23:51] See, some of you today, I'm I'm I'm
[23:53] encouraging you. I pray you feel the
[23:55] pull of the Lord for your family, your
[23:56] wife, girlfriend, whatever it is. I I
[23:58] pray that you feel the pull through the
[24:00] preaching that Christ is pulling you
[24:02] because you haven't made a stand yet.
[24:05] You haven't made a real stand, but you
[24:08] need to make a stand.
[24:12] You're a daddy. You need to make a stand
[24:14] for the rest of the family.
[24:17] So, he's in a rage. He's in a fury. In
[24:19] verse 14, Nebuchadnezzar spake and said
[24:20] unto them, "Is it true, oh Shadrach,
[24:23] Meshach, and Abednego, do not ye serve
[24:25] my gods, nor worship the golden image
[24:27] which I've set up? Now if you be ready
[24:29] that at what time you hear the sound of
[24:31] the cornet, flute, harp, sagput, sultry,
[24:36] doulamer, I don't know why all the names
[24:39] of the instruments are mentioned again.
[24:43] And all kinds of music, ye shall fall
[24:46] down and worship the image which I have
[24:49] made well. But if ye worship not, ye
[24:52] shall be cast in the same hour into the
[24:54] midst of the burning fiery furnace. And
[24:56] who is that God that shall deliver you
[24:58] out of my hands,
[25:02] threats,
[25:06] pressure,
[25:08] anger coming against you. Wow. So he
[25:12] gave him another chance. My dad used to
[25:14] preach this. I always loved when he
[25:15] preached Shadak Meshach a minute ago
[25:17] because he said, "I'm going to give you
[25:18] guys another chance. Okay, we're going
[25:21] to do this privately. The whole world
[25:22] doesn't need to see. Just come over here
[25:24] in a minute. And here's the image right
[25:26] here. And just while nobody's watching,
[25:28] just get down and bow. That's all you
[25:30] have to do. Just do a quick little bow
[25:32] privately, secretly.
[25:36] I'm giving you another chance to bow.
[25:44] And
[25:47] here's their answer. Verse 16. Shadrach,
[25:50] Meshach, and Abednego answered instead
[25:52] of the king, "Oh Nebuchadnezzar, we are
[25:54] not careful to answer thee in this
[25:56] matter." In other words, in our
[25:58] language, let me make myself perfectly
[26:01] clear,
[26:04] perfectly transparent.
[26:06] We don't want any question in your mind.
[26:09] Amen. We're being very careful to answer
[26:12] very direct to you.
[26:16] Glory be to God. Take a stand. Don't be
[26:20] afraid of the enemy.
[26:24] Have we made ourselves perfectly
[26:26] transparent?
[26:29] If it be so, our God whom we serve is
[26:32] able to deliver us from the burning fire
[26:34] furnace, and he will deliver us out of
[26:37] thine hand, O king. So God's able to do
[26:39] it. But if not, be it known unto thee.
[26:44] May we make it crystal clear to you, oh
[26:47] king, that we will not serve thy gods,
[26:50] nor worship the golden image which thou
[26:53] hast set up.
[26:56] You want a little amen?
[27:00] There's a believer to me. God is able at
[27:04] this moment to deliver me from whatever
[27:06] it is, cancer, emotional instability.
[27:10] God can heal me. God can raise the dead.
[27:13] And I believe it with all my heart. I've
[27:16] watched it happen. I know it can happen.
[27:18] But I want to let the devil know that if
[27:21] something happened, God chooses to take
[27:23] somebody in cancer. I'm still not bowing
[27:26] to the world. I'm still not bowing to
[27:28] your image.
[27:30] That's the language of a believer. These
[27:34] three men fell bound into the midst.
[27:36] Then Nebuchadnezzar the king, verse 24,
[27:38] astonished, rose up in haste, and spake,
[27:40] and said unto the counselors, "Did not
[27:42] we cast three men bound in the midst of
[27:44] the fire?" They answered and said unto
[27:45] the king, "Oh tree, true king, we only
[27:47] sent three in there." He answered and
[27:49] said, "Lo, I see four men loose walking
[27:52] in the midst of the fire, unharmed by
[27:57] the flames,
[27:59] surrounded but unharmed." How many would
[28:02] raise your hand and say, "That's where I
[28:03] want to be living. I don't care the
[28:05] flames are I if I'm surrounded I want to
[28:07] be unharmed by the protection of God.
