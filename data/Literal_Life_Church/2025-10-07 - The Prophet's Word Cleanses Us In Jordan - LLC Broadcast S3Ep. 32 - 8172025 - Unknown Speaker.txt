[Music] &gt;&gt; Second Kings chapter 5 and verse 9. We can read together. So non came with his horses and with his chariot and stood at the door of the house of Elijah Elisha. And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, "Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean." But non was wroth, and went away, and said, "Behold, I thought," &gt;&gt; you know, my dad used to say, "That's where we get in trouble. Behold, I thought he would surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the Lord his God and strike his hand over the place and recover the leper. Are not Abna and far uh Farpa uh rivers of Damascus better than all the waters of Israel. May I may I uh not wash in them and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage. and his servants came near and spake unto him and said, "My father, if the prophet had bid thee to do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? How much rather than when he saith, wash and be clean?" &gt;&gt; I mean, remember the scripture in Isaiah, I think it is, he says, "Don't despise the day of small things." We're living in that day where God can get glory and bring deliverance through small things and small obedience to the Lord. Then went he down and dipped himself seven times in Jordan according to the saying of the man of God. And his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child and he was clean. May the Lord add his blessings to the word this morning. Once God sends a prophet and the prophet speaks that word, after that prophet is even gone, the word remains. &gt;&gt; And I would say it this way that once he speaks it to his prophet and his prophet goes on, it is out of the picture. What he said remains and it's there. If I can say it this way, it's in the land. God spoke spoke it and all of the purpose God gave with that word it holds its purpose still it holds purpose behind it. It holds power behind it. It will never return void to God. That's what the Bible says. God says my word will never return void. And we know he uses prophets to bring his word. But when he brings it and even after the prophet's gone, if that word has been spoken and it's in the land, it has the purpose in it. It has power in it, it'll go forth and reach into the whole earth. Can you say amen? And it will accomplish what God sends for it to do. There's nothing, and I say this, there's nothing Satan can do to stop that word &gt;&gt; once it's in motion. And when I say in motion, once it's been spoken and it's in the land and it goes out, there's nothing Satan can do to stop it, it's going to accomplish what God sent it to do. And so that should give us a great strength this morning. There's nothing Satan can ever do to stop it from reaching every seed and challenging the very worst of sin and habits in the people. Once that word has been spoken, it's going to go forth into every parts of the land. And it's going to reach his elected seed. It's going to call them. And then when that elected seed is bound by habits and sin and fear and whatever it is, that word is going to call the seed and it's going to deliver them from any habits of this age. Any leprosy, any sin, that word, the prophet doesn't have to be here, but the word is in the land. And the word will not return void. The word will still have the power in it. The word will still have a purpose in it. I'll tell you, you're not under a denominational word. You're living by a word that has power and has purpose in it. And it will accomplish in your life. Everything that you're missing, this word is going to provide. &gt;&gt; I'm glad you're not depending on Paula Fontaine. Can you say amen? And you're glad. You should be glad of that, too. Or any preacher for that matter. It's the word that the preacher preaches. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; When I walk out every Sunday morning and walk into this, I say, "Well, thank God there's people here today." &gt;&gt; It's It's a, you know, it's nice because you see people hungry for the word of God. Can you say amen? It would be bad if I walked out and nobody was here. It's hard to preach when nobody's there, but when people are there, then they know there's got to be something in this word for me. Can you say amen? And it's because when it's spoken by a prophet, it has the power within it to go forth and accomplish and in this case take us into a rapture. How many want to go in a rapture? This is a rapturing faith word that we're under. &gt;&gt; You'll never stop it. And when anybody who aligns themsself against a prophet's word, when anybody aligns himself against this, you're not aligning yourself against a prophet or the people who follow it. When you align yourself against the word of a prophet, that means trouble for you. &gt;&gt; Great trouble in your life. You've aligned yourself against the wrong thing. You can align yourself against the president, against country, against politics, your local government, but let me tell you something. When you align yourself against not a prophet, but against the prophet's word that's in the land, you've aligned yourself against the wrong thing. Elisha was only actually carrying on the ministry of Elijah. That's interesting to us because we've had that spirit of Elijah return to this land according to scripture. If you're listening in, uh you'll be able to know from scripture that Elijah is used five times in the Bible. God so trusted that spirit to send that to speak to his people. And we're in the I believe the fourth time that God used it in our generation. He said, "I'll I'll send you Elijah the prophet before the great and dreadful day of the Lord." And he'll send that. It's God sending his servant. And then uh then he said John the Baptist had the spirit of Elias El Elias on him Elijah. And so that he sends it again. He's going to send it one more time to the Jews according to the book of revelations. But you see now in this incident when the first time Elijah come we realize that Elijah was uh was gone already and Elisha was there now and he had only received he received a double portion of Elijah's spirit. So we realize Elijah is not even there. But the word of Elijah is still carrying on. The word of Elijah is still in the land. It was years later that he pronounced judgment over Jezebel. But it was after Elijah was gone that that judgment came to pass. &gt;&gt; Because everything that he said if it come from God, it's going to come to pass even when Elijah's gone. &gt;&gt; Is anybody with me this morning? &gt;&gt; So Elisha has a double portion of this. And Elisha is a type of the bride. He's not he's he's carrying on what Elijah had. And and Elisha, and you even have that sh in there, that she, it's the feminine part. He's the type of the bride. I love to read Elisha because that's the days we live in. And and and the incident with non is something that happened. That's a type of our our time. So the bride is a prophetic people just like Elisha was carrying on the prophecy of Elijah. The bride, listen now, is a prophetic people because she is speaking and holding to the same word under Elijah. &gt;&gt; We're not just Christians, but we're a people. We're a prophetic people. &gt;&gt; We're under a prophecy. Can you say amen? We're under a word that's God has put in the land. And not just in the land, then he puts it in our hearts. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; This is not just church. This is not just another gathering of Christians. No, we are a prophetic people carrying out God's word for this age. &gt;&gt; And uh it it it's an amazing word. It's a powerful word. And it's nothing in herself, but she she is a prophetic people because she's speaking and holding the same word of Elijah. Elijah's word is in the land. It's in his people. His servants are carriers of that word. They don't have the power, but they have the authority with that word to use the power of God like a policeman. He doesn't have any power within himself, but he has authority and he has all the city backing him up. Every believer here this morning has all of heaven backing you up. &gt;&gt; You don't have a power, but you have authority to use the power of God. You don't want a power within yourself. You can do nothing but you have access to the power of God which is in the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So then the the that word reaches all the way. Now now just catch this that word reaches all the way out to the even to the headquarters of the Syrian army to a man named Non who was a captain in the Syrian army. So watch how far that word goes. Now it reaches all the way to the headquarters of the enemy army, Syrian army, uh the ones that fighting against Israel. The word reaches in there by a little maid girl that's she's away. She's in captivity, but the word of the prophet reaches through a little maid girl and she sees an incident and there's no cure for it. There's no cure for leprosy, but she knows there's a prophetic word. There's a prophet. There is a source that's in the land for deliverance for something that's completely incurable. &gt;&gt; How many know how many incurable diseases we got today and we're trying to get sights. We're trying to tackle all of them. But listen now, when there's no cure for a habit or a sin or a demon, there is a cure within the land. And we are witnesses to that. We are carriers of that word. &gt;&gt; This little girl, she starts to hear this. And I'm getting ahead of myself, but she just says, "Listen, there's a word in the land." &gt;&gt; If you can get to that word, leprosy, not leprosy is not a problem. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. I feel like shouting this morning. &gt;&gt; You know that beyond what you think of yourself, the word that he's put in this land and put in your heart is more powerful than any demon that can come against your life. It's more powerful than any anxiety. It's more powerful than any trial in your life. It's not you. It's the word he's placed within you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That word reached all the way to the headquarters of a army that was fighting against Israel. And the little maid girl working in non's home in captivity, away from all the comfort of her own people and her own church, away from all the comforts. We got it pretty nice today. We got believers that we can fellowship with. We got to come. Our children have a pretty safe place to be. But this girl was taken away from her parents, away from her church just like Daniel was and his friends Shadrach, Meshach, and Abedneo. They were taken into Babylon, away from Jerusalem, away from the comfort of being able to go to church every week. And we don't know how much pressures we'll come against. But when that word, when you're carrying that word, you can be in the worst of Babylon. You can be of the worst of atmospheres. Can I get an amen this one? You can be in in your employment or your school in the worst of atmospheres and you're carrying something within you. That's the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me just say this. Don't ever underestimate that word and where it will reach and the witness of it. That's right. &gt;&gt; I tell you, if the last days message of Christ that we preach is man-made, it should have never reached as far as it has today. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I preach the message of Christ for the last days, and if it was man-made, it would have never reached as far as it's reached. &gt;&gt; True. because it's God's word &gt;&gt; where it's it's going gone into country countries that to me and I could elaborate on this but to me I it it went against all communism in countries. It's getting into places that it's never going to get in there. It's never going to be accepted there. But somehow it's getting in cuz God's looking for his elected seed. &gt;&gt; Don't ever estimate where the word will reach and the witness of it. If this last days message of Christ is man-made, it would have never reached as far as this. God had a little cleaning girl way away from her people. But she got a source that she can tell pe people about. And as she heard conversations in the home like, and I'm just elaborating, how in the world did our great captain non get leprosy? Our master, he's honorable. He's mighty. He's a mighty warrior. How in the world did he get lep leprosy? It's not fair. We learned something this morning. We learned that leprosy, which is a type of sin, can affect anyone. &gt;&gt; It's a captain in the Syrian army. And the Bible says in chapter 5 and verse one, a man with his master in honorable because by him the Lord had given deliverance into Syria. He was also a mighty man in valor, but he was a leper. And so this teaches us something. Sin, leprosy, can get to anybody. I don't care how much money you have. Can I get an amen? &gt;&gt; He He was It can Your position in the world doesn't matter. Your money doesn't matter. Your status does not make you I hope you're listening online this morning as well and all the broadcasts. Sin can reach if you've got all the money in the world. If you got all the position in the world, if you're the president, whatever position, your status does not make you immune from the disease of sin. And let me just say this, &gt;&gt; the disease of sin, except by the blood and the token, we're not immune from it either. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm in the message. I've been in the message for 40 years. Those things don't bother me. You live in the flesh, my brother. Twothirds of you is not born again. &gt;&gt; And if you give yourself to the wrong thing, you'll take on the disease of sin. It may not get to your soul, but it'll start to work in your life. You feed on the wrong things and you're going to start taking the disease of sin in your life. You're gonna It doesn't matter because sin will go to any it'll take you further than you want to go. It touched a a mighty warrior here that would have never expected. And that's why we need to realize we start saying, "Well, this is unfair. That person lives such a good life. Why were they struck with this disease?" &gt;&gt; Anybody ever said that? It just seems so unfair that they would get this particular let somebody else get it. That's a bad person. &gt;&gt; No, Satan don't work that way. &gt;&gt; Satan doesn't work that way. He goes for the juggler. He goes for anybody and especially believers. &gt;&gt; If he would want to strike somebody with cancer, he's going to strike a believer. But he doesn't know when he strikes a believer, he's in big trouble. &gt;&gt; When he strikes a believer, he's dealing with something different because he he didn't he's not going to know what hit him. Can you say amen? He's not going to know what hit him because he struck the wrong thing, &gt;&gt; the wrong person. Because if they're carrying that word, if God decides to take them, that's still up to God. That's still a victory in God. But listen now, he tries to get this to believers and all these diseases, especially the disease s, you know, the disease of sin is worse than cancer. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And and we get nervous about that and and and and sometimes we're human, we do that. But let me tell you what you feed on in worldly things. And the disease you can get from that is worse than the disease of cancer. Amen. &gt;&gt; The disease of the mind and the disease of uh things that come to your spirit, emotions and mind, it's worse. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we learn that leprosy, sin can affect anyone. Your position in the world, all these other things doesn't matter. But also, we learn that this word will reach anyone. So, the the the disease of sin, leprosy struck somebody that we wouldn't expect. But you see now we also the positive thing is the word that will deliver them will reach anyone as well. This little young person must have had the belief that the healing is in the word and it was for everyone. Otherwise, she wouldn't have been testifying in the house. She believed it was for everyone. She believed this word. If they'll respond to it and go to it, it's for everyone. Listen, we don't have a right to be exclusive with this message. Can you sign a man? &gt;&gt; It's for everyone who will believe. I know there's predestinated seed. I know there's categories, but we don't worry about this category. That little girl said she if she would have been selective, if she would have been said, "Well, these guys aren't even believers and they're the enemy." If she'd have had that attitude, he wouldn't have got his deliverance before she even said something. She had to have the attitude, "This word is for everybody." Yes. &gt;&gt; She'd have looked at that man and said, "This is a cusser. He's cussing all the time around. I can't even stand the atmosphere. He's drinking. He's got all kinds of this stuff around his body. He's, you know, if we judge people by how they look on the outside, they will start thinking, "This word must have been for me &gt;&gt; and not them." &gt;&gt; She didn't do that. She didn't have that attitude. Anybody listening this morning? I'm trying to correct a lot of message pride that says we're better than everybody else and we got an exclusion on this word. It's ours and we're going into rapture and the rest of us cannon fodder. That's that's terms that a prophet can use. But you be careful how you use those because you might rule somebody out. [Applause] &gt;&gt; She's here. She's hearing them talk and say, "Why does this have to come to him for days? This is not fair. He's got this leprosy all over his skin. He could die of it." And even though there was no cure, the word of a prophet, she she pipes up and says, "I know a man. If you can get to him, if you can get there, you can be delivered of this leprosy." &gt;&gt; Leprosy is an infectious disease. How many knew that leprosy is an infectious disease and it's on the skin by the way which we might point out that leprosy is a type of sin. Brother Bram says there are some diseases so subtle and creep in so slow that it takes a a specialist not just a regular doctor. The way sin creeps in our life today it takes the word a word that's got a word that's got the devil's number and knows what he's talking about. Just as God makes a way of escape from temptation. How many believe God will make a way of escape from temptation? Yes. The Bible says that. But you see now, he also makes a way and a remedy for every part of sin. The nature of sin and the influence of sin. It's not just having the nature of sin that you're born with. Calvary, the blood takes care of the very nature of sin. That's why you need a new birth because you were born with the nature of sin. That's why you like to sin. That's why you like to you're attracted to things in the world. That's the nature of sin. Calvary kills the nature and desire of sin. But also there's an influence of sin. &gt;&gt; And the blood also has power. The word has power against the influence &gt;&gt; of sin. Whatever it is this morning, the atonement says if you'll repent and mourn and say, "God, I bring my life under this feast of atonement." He says he'll answer back, "Forgive you completely." &gt;&gt; That's right. You no longer had to sit there this morning thinking, "This is for everybody else, but I'll never get in." That's a lie of the devil. This blood is for your mistakes. This blood is for your sin. Every one of you have a story, and none of you wanted the story that you got. &gt;&gt; But you have a story, and the story doesn't end with just your problems. The story ends in redemption. for watching our service today. If you would like more information, please contact us by visiting our website, literallife.urch.
