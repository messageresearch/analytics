[6:17] [Music]
[6:31] let's see
[6:33] [Music]
[6:39] this is
[6:42] [Music]
[6:58] if you would Luke chapter 5 verse 17 and
[7:02] it came to pass on a certain day as he
[7:05] was teaching that there were Pharisees
[7:07] and doctors of the law sitting by which
[7:10] were come out of every town of Galilee
[7:12] and Judea and Jerusalem and the power of
[7:16] the Lord was present to heal them how
[7:19] many want to believe this morning that
[7:20] the power of the Lord is present
[7:23] to heal them
[7:24] and behold men brought in a bed a man
[7:27] which was taken with palsy and they
[7:30] sought means to bring him in and to lay
[7:32] him before him and when they could not
[7:35] find by what way they might bring him in
[7:37] because of the multitude they went up
[7:40] upon the house top and led him down
[7:42] through the tiling with his couch into
[7:45] the Mist before Jesus and when he saw
[7:48] their faith he said unto them man thy
[7:52] sins are forgiven thee and the scribes
[7:54] and the Pharisees begin to reason of
[7:57] course and so I want to elaborate this
[8:00] morning on our thought life and thoughts
[8:03] and so now I want you to notice the
[8:05] scenario of something happening here
[8:07] that is very strange very out of the
[8:09] ordinary and actually would uh provoke
[8:13] many thoughts from everybody in that
[8:15] room everybody outside of course the
[8:18] Pharisees and Sadducees are going to be
[8:20] critical but I think it would provoke
[8:22] different thoughts from everybody in in
[8:25] that room as they watched the tiles
[8:27] being torn off the roof and somebody
[8:29] with so much Faith wanting to get near
[8:31] Jesus is willing to tear the roof apart
[8:34] and be and be lowered down in front of
[8:36] Jesus I like that kind of faith
[8:39] but that kind of faith provokes a lot of
[8:43] uh critical thoughts
[8:46] especially from Pharisees
[8:49] and so this this is what God gave me to
[8:53] bring in the channel of this thought
[8:55] about our thought life and what we think
[8:57] about the scribes and the Pharisees
[8:59] begin to reason saying who is this which
[9:02] speaketh blasphemies who can forgive
[9:05] sins but God alone but Jesus but when
[9:09] Jesus perceived their thoughts so this
[9:12] is things that was they were thinking it
[9:15] wasn't they weren't saying it they were
[9:17] thinking it but when Jesus was present
[9:20] he knew what they were thinking
[9:24] so I'm letting all of you know whether
[9:26] it's me or you or whoever it is Jesus
[9:30] this morning knows what you're thinking
[9:33] he answering said to them what why what
[9:36] reason ye in your hearts whether it is
[9:38] easier to say thy sins be forgiven thee
[9:41] or to say rise up and walk and that you
[9:44] may know that the son of man has power
[9:46] upon her to forgive sins he said unto
[9:49] the sick of the palsy I say unto thee
[9:52] arise take up thy couch and go into thy
[9:55] house and he immediately he rose up
[9:58] before them took up there and he lay and
[10:01] departed into his own house glorifying
[10:04] God
[10:04] and they were all amazed and they
[10:09] glorified God and were filled with fear
[10:13] saying we have seen strange things today
[10:21] Hallelujah
[10:23] Jesus likes to do
[10:26] strange things
[10:28] to the human mind
[10:31] and when he wants to do strange things
[10:33] we should let him do strange things
[10:38] if it brings Victory if it brings
[10:40] healing if it brings Deliverance
[10:43] then let God do what he wants to do
[10:47] now we want to deal with another
[10:49] Avenue of the subject of our thought
[10:53] life
[10:54] and I trust you all be listening good
[10:57] this morning and listening intently
[10:59] and uh
[11:01] I I believe we have a subject that we've
[11:05] been speaking of of our thought life and
[11:08] I believe with all my heart saints that
[11:10] we can't preach about our thought life
[11:12] enough I could probably take the next
[11:15] year and keep talking about it and
[11:17] preaching about it I believe it's very
[11:19] important the reason I believe it's
[11:20] important to talk about what you're
[11:22] thinking every day and what you're
[11:23] thinking even right now I believe it's
[11:26] important because I believe this is a
[11:29] key to Greater faith and greater Victory
[11:31] and I am convinced that Satan hates it
[11:35] when ministers expose things like how
[11:38] the mind works and things like how Satan
[11:42] comes into our thoughts I'm convinced
[11:45] that Satan is very much upset and Satan
[11:48] does not like ministers to talk about
[11:50] your thought life because this is the
[11:53] area Satan wreaks habits so much it's in
[11:56] your thought life it's the hidden world
[11:58] it's the private world it is the the
[12:01] world nobody sees but God but it is a
[12:04] world Satan can attack you in and so
[12:06] this is the part that's why Satan of
[12:09] course being the the creature or the
[12:11] being that likes to keep everything
[12:13] hidden he doesn't like to be exposed and
[12:16] because your thought life is is hidden
[12:19] and is is private and no one else can
[12:22] see it that's why Satan uses it because
[12:24] you can hold things and we know from the
[12:27] scripture your thoughts certain thoughts
[12:29] can bind you and Satan loves to bind
[12:32] so this is important and so I came to
[12:35] this text of Jesus perceiving their
[12:37] thoughts and uh when you talk about the
[12:41] uh the subject or this part of Jesus
[12:44] that can discern the thoughts and can
[12:46] know what you're thinking I I thought
[12:48] about it yesterday and I was thinking
[12:50] how it's it seems to me and I could be
[12:53] wrong but it seems to me that this part
[12:55] of Jesus that can discern your thinking
[12:58] and discern your thoughts is not
[13:00] preached about a lot in the Christian
[13:01] realm this part of Jesus is actually
[13:04] hardly ever spoke of in Christian Realms
[13:07] we hear so much about Jesus especially
[13:09] in Christianity we talk about all the
[13:12] facets of Jesus we talk about becoming
[13:15] more like Jesus we talk about Jesus and
[13:18] his miracles we teach our children
[13:20] Sunday school stories of what God did in
[13:22] Jesus and when he lived on this Earth
[13:24] for three and a half years and so much
[13:26] as Jesus of Jesus has talked about but
[13:28] when you think about there's not a lot
[13:30] of messages about Jesus knowing our
[13:32] thoughts back then he perceived their
[13:35] thoughts and if he can do that back then
[13:37] he can do it this morning
[13:39] because Jesus Christ is the same
[13:42] yesterday today and forever and no man
[13:45] no denomination has a right to say he
[13:49] did it back then but he can't do that
[13:51] now Jesus is the same in the service
[13:53] this morning as he ever was and if he
[13:56] knew their thoughts within a moment back
[13:58] then then he knows your thoughts now
[14:00] this is the part of Jesus that's very
[14:03] important to us and very important to
[14:05] the kingdom of God that Jesus knows your
[14:07] thoughts because we know if Jesus can
[14:10] know your thoughts Jesus can correct
[14:12] your thoughts and you can get the right
[14:14] thoughts in your mind the right mental
[14:16] attitude towards any promise of God will
[14:19] bring it to pass
[14:20] you can't say I got the Holy Ghost and
[14:23] ignore your thought life
[14:24] you can't say I got the Holy Ghost and
[14:26] ignore what you're thinking every day
[14:27] you can have the Holy Ghost and ignore
[14:30] what you're thinking right now
[14:32] so our thought life has to be in line
[14:35] with our soul that is Jesus Christ the
[14:38] same yesterday today and forever in all
[14:41] aspects it is wrong to say he is not the
[14:43] same in every aspect if any denomination
[14:46] has taught you that he's not the same in
[14:49] every aspect then that denomination has
[14:51] deceived you
[14:53] because Jesus Christ is the same
[14:55] yesterday today and forever he's the
[14:57] same in every aspect say well why don't
[15:00] I see things in my particular church
[15:01] because it takes Faith to believe that
[15:05] Jesus can do what he did in the past it
[15:07] takes Believers to say I just simply
[15:10] believe it I don't have to go through
[15:12] all kinds of teaching about it
[15:14] get it he
[15:16] and I just have simple faith I just
[15:18] believe you can do it
[15:21] and I believe it whether I see it or not
[15:26] I believe he can open up a Blind Man's
[15:28] eyes whether I ever see it or not but we
[15:32] have seen it and we do see it I believe
[15:34] he heals cancer whether I ever see it or
[15:36] not but friends we have told too many
[15:39] testimonies that say otherwise
[15:43] blessed be his name so it takes
[15:45] Believers to believe it and so now uh so
[15:50] so
[15:52] I'm just going to move on from that so
[15:54] now this part of Jesus being real and
[15:57] this part of Jesus of course being real
[16:00] to us and knowing the thoughts it's
[16:03] important and it always has been there
[16:05] in other words there's an element that
[16:08] came through Jesus that really has
[16:10] always been there even though you have a
[16:12] unique gift in a prophet that can see by
[16:15] Vision certain things we know that this
[16:18] element is always among us because and
[16:22] if you're listening and you want Bible
[16:23] for it Hebrews quotes and says the word
[16:27] of God the word of God not not just your
[16:30] Bible when you think of the word of God
[16:32] not just your written bible that's just
[16:34] a written bible to help us but the word
[16:36] of God the person of Christ because
[16:38] Jesus is the word the word of God is
[16:41] quick and powerful and sharper than any
[16:45] two-edged sword piercing to the dividing
[16:48] of Thunder of Soul and Spirit and is a
[16:52] discerner of the thoughts
[16:56] and the intense
[16:58] of the heart
[17:00] so really this is really never left the
[17:04] church
[17:05] if the word is present
[17:07] Jesus the word then he knows the
[17:10] thoughts and all of a sudden when that
[17:12] happens and we when our faith would feel
[17:15] you know what your your faith would be
[17:16] saying
[17:17] this is real
[17:20] Jesus Christ is Among Us
[17:24] it would sober us up
[17:28] it does a lot of things it sobers us up
[17:31] that God's real this isn't just church
[17:34] this isn't just not a beautiful place
[17:36] God has given us and I'm not just
[17:38] filling my time and putting and punching
[17:41] the clock to be here for church no no
[17:43] wait a minute wait a minute this is real
[17:46] he's here
[17:48] so everything changes when he's here so
[17:51] now our faith would build to be able to
[17:54] get out of our thought life and get out
[17:55] of our doubts and get out of our
[17:57] criticalness to say I don't care about
[17:59] all that he's here he knows my life he
[18:03] knows what my burdens are and if he is
[18:05] here he can bring Deliverance for it
[18:10] that's what that kind of Faith builds
[18:12] you say well I wish I could see it that
[18:14] real
[18:16] but didn't he say to Thomas
[18:19] I'll I'll let you touch my side
[18:23] but I want you to know
[18:24] blessed is he
[18:27] who has not seen
[18:30] and yet believes
[18:33] blessed is that brother and sister who
[18:36] just hears that he can do that
[18:39] blessed is them who who in simple Faith
[18:44] believe it they don't try to figure it
[18:46] out they don't let their mind go through
[18:48] a whole process
[18:51] your simple faith
[18:53] I believe he's here
[18:56] I believe he can do anything
[18:59] and that's actually what God's looking
[19:00] for
[19:03] so
[19:06] time after time and you can raise your
[19:10] hand
[19:11] where
[19:12] it's happened to you
[19:14] where they say
[19:16] brother Paul
[19:19] were you
[19:21] at our dinner table last night
[19:26] I know you weren't but
[19:28] were you in the Next Room
[19:30] did you hear what we discussed the whole
[19:32] evening
[19:33] because you preached a lot of that this
[19:35] morning word for word
[19:38] brother Paul were you in our car this
[19:40] morning on the way to church
[19:42] I hear it all the time
[19:45] you know some ministers Maybe
[19:47] that don't have the character would
[19:49] start saying man I must really have
[19:51] something here
[19:52] I don't have nothing
[19:56] brother Barry sent me a quote yesterday
[19:57] it says we preachers we really don't
[19:59] even preach
[20:01] ourselves preachers no no we don't
[20:03] preach God preaches to his people
[20:07] they're saying about me do you think
[20:08] I'll ask honestly know what you talked
[20:10] about in your car on the way to church
[20:12] some of you certainly don't want the
[20:14] preacher in the car on the way to church
[20:19] but God's there
[20:22] God's there
[20:24] here's every conversation and not just
[20:27] conversations the very thoughts the
[20:29] intents of the heart this is the kind of
[20:31] Jesus that we serve
[20:34] and it doesn't scare me it doesn't make
[20:37] me afraid
[20:38] I've come years ago to an open life
[20:41] before him like this and whenever I
[20:43] begin hiding something I know I can't
[20:45] hide it but when I try to hide something
[20:46] it never goes good
[20:49] when I try to hide this little thing
[20:51] let's do this years ago with my families
[20:53] just see if this will work every time I
[20:55] try to hide something God exposes it no
[20:57] that's you can't do that this is where
[20:59] this goes you let your kids watch that
[21:00] this is what they become
[21:03] so this wonderful work of the Lord
[21:05] convicting me and exposing things I'm
[21:08] used to it now and I'm I'm all open all
[21:10] arms to it you don't scare me when you
[21:13] come and you have criticisms and things
[21:15] to say to me if I'm off the word I want
[21:17] to know about it if you have something
[21:19] to say I'm not gonna it's not gonna be
[21:21] the end of the world if you come to me
[21:22] because why I'm hoping if it's the Lord
[21:24] correcting through you I want to hear it
[21:28] if it's just your carnal mind
[21:29] criticizing I'm okay with it as well at
[21:33] the end of the day other decisions might
[21:34] be made I don't know but listen you
[21:36] we've got to grow to maturity to quit
[21:38] being afraid when God exposes
[21:41] what we're thinking God was perceiving
[21:45] their thoughts when Jesus perceived
[21:49] their thoughts so now our story here uh
[21:55] let me just say this first why does this
[21:57] part of Jesus get ignored Satan likes it
[22:00] when things are hidden in our thought
[22:02] life that's keeping you for more faith
[22:06] because men can hold thoughts what kind
[22:08] of thoughts oh I pray the Lord can just
[22:10] help me elaborate through what he wants
[22:12] to say this morning because there's so
[22:14] much to say about what we're thinking
[22:15] about all the time
[22:17] it can be good it can be bad it can be
[22:20] critical it can be hesitance of
[22:22] preachers it can be I'm never going to
[22:24] fully give my heart to that and that
[22:26] strong will hold your thoughts so many
[22:28] things it's so important to talk about
[22:31] because we can hide things in our
[22:33] thought life men can hold thoughts of
[22:35] unbelief how many know you can hold
[22:37] thoughts of unbelief all these other
[22:39] thoughts it's those thoughts that quench
[22:41] the spirit of God from moving in your
[22:44] life thoughts can quench the spirit
[22:50] and so this in this incident where we
[22:53] find that it's a great provoking of
[22:55] critical thoughts let me just deal with
[22:56] this just a minute so we have a a house
[22:59] that's full of people it's packed full
[23:01] they're waiting on the outside nobody
[23:02] can get in and so now this incident
[23:05] where the man with such face gets on top
[23:08] of the house with all of his friends
[23:09] maybe and he couldn't do it very easy
[23:11] they had to help him and they start
[23:14] tearing the rough apart and they open up
[23:16] an opening and they lower this man right
[23:18] in front of Jesus I I just wonder the
[23:21] thoughts that were going on I know what
[23:22] the decide the Pharisees were thinking
[23:24] but everybody this provokes all kinds of
[23:27] thoughts
[23:29] like what in the world
[23:32] don't tell me you people wouldn't be
[23:34] thinking it very strange if if you
[23:37] started to hear noises
[23:39] we're not packed
[23:41] but you started hearing noises and they
[23:43] couldn't get in so they're tearing the
[23:45] roof apart
[23:46] and I keep preaching and they're
[23:49] lowering somebody to be prayed for right
[23:51] in front of the pulpit don't you tell me
[23:54] that all these thoughts would be come up
[23:57] to you they're coming down thoughts
[24:00] thoughts
[24:01] can't they just do it this way can't
[24:03] they do it and yet your thoughts your
[24:06] thought is completely ignoring what's
[24:08] really happening
[24:10] it's fixing to do something your
[24:12] thoughts have ignored the faith of this
[24:14] man
[24:15] your first thought as a Believer should
[24:18] say I'm I'm gonna something's happening
[24:20] here and I'm gonna lay aside my critical
[24:22] thoughts because something's going on
[24:24] I'm not gonna be critical I'm gonna
[24:26] start praying for a man who's willing to
[24:28] tear the roof off of this house
[24:32] and that's why I'm teaching you to
[24:33] correct your thoughts quit being
[24:35] critical quit jumping to the first
[24:37] thought of being critical of other
[24:38] people and every other thing why don't
[24:40] you step back and say now wait a minute
[24:41] I'm bringing my thoughts in line with
[24:43] the word god may be doing something here
[24:46] don't you dare let your thoughts
[24:49] quench the spirit of God
[24:53] for a hungry soul
[24:55] that's starting to search for him don't
[24:58] you dare criticize them don't you dare
[25:00] jump all over them don't you dare meet
[25:03] them in the back door and criticize them
[25:04] you pray that the holy spirit will draw
[25:07] that heart
[25:08] don't your thoughts and here here's this
[25:12] scenario and so that you can think all
[25:15] kinds of things and we know what the
[25:16] Pharisees said Jesus says and I'm not so
[25:19] sure friends that Jesus didn't he had
[25:22] this in his mind before the foundation
[25:23] of the world I'm not so sure that Jesus
[25:26] doesn't allow strange things to happen
[25:31] to provoke and to let you see where your
[25:34] thought life is
[25:37] right I'm not so sure that sometimes I
[25:39] Don't Preach out of the ordinary or some
[25:41] Minister gets out of the order or says
[25:43] something or something's done to provoke
[25:46] and to bring up to let you see how
[25:48] critical your thoughts can be sometimes
[25:50] and that you're not willing to say I'm
[25:52] going to pray I'm not going to be
[25:53] critical I'm not going to let my
[25:55] thoughts go on and on and on and on
[25:58] but I'm gonna pray something different
[25:59] has happened it's out of my it's out of
[26:01] my comfort zone it's out of the norm
[26:03] it's out of the box
[26:06] and I'm I'm gonna just watch and pray
[26:10] what's going on here could it be God
[26:12] wants us to get out of our box get past
[26:14] our thinking quit overthinking things
[26:16] quit trying to figure it out and just
[26:18] step out in simple faith I'm believing
[26:20] this I'm going with it
[26:24] could it be that God wants us to have
[26:26] this kind of Faith as this man that I'm
[26:29] wanting to get there I'm wanting to get
[26:31] in the presence of Jesus I'm I'm wanting
[26:33] to do this can you say Amen if you come
[26:35] finding fault you will find it
[26:39] you're gonna find fault we're not
[26:41] perfect we're broken people somebody's
[26:44] gonna say something that they shouldn't
[26:46] say sometimes somebody's going to say
[26:48] something in the flesh somebody's going
[26:50] to get a little too much anger and even
[26:52] a holy ghost filled person can Step In
[26:55] the Flesh and say something they
[26:57] shouldn't say you know why I know they
[26:59] can do it because you do it yourself
[27:04] it's okay get quiet all you want to but
[27:06] I'm gonna say this a lot of times we
[27:08] bring this to you and then we expect God
[27:10] oh Lord come down praise the Lord and
[27:13] your whole thought life is filled with
[27:14] resentment towards people in the church
[27:16] and I say you need to hit an altar and
[27:18] say God Purge me of this resentment of
[27:21] this brother's sister they are a brother
[27:23] they are a sister I I may not know them
[27:25] very well but it's not right for me to
[27:28] continue having these thoughts towards
[27:30] them
[27:31] we have some mental emotional
[27:35] maybe Financial
[27:37] some soul struggles
[27:40] internally in the thought life going on
[27:44] and I don't teach us just as a teaching
[27:46] I teach it so the Believers can bind

[27:52] congregation online we're going to bind
[27:54] together and pray
