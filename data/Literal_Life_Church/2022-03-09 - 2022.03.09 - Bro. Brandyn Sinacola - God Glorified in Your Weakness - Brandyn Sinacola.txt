TRANSCRIPT
========================================
blessed is the nation whose god is the lord and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance the lord looketh from heaven he beholdeth all the sons of men from the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth he fashioneth their hearts alike he considereth all their works there is no king saved by the multitude of and host a mighty man is not delivered by much strength and horse is a vain thing for safety neither shall he deliver any by his great strength his great strength being a man's strength behold the eye of the lord is upon them that fear him upon them that hope and his mercy to deliver their soul from death and to keep them alive and famine our soul waiteth for the lord he is our help and our shield for our heart shall rejoice in him because we have trusted in his holy name let thy mercy o lord be upon us according as we hope in thee so as i was reading this i just kind of put it in my words what spoke to me the other morning when i read this out of the devotional what i what i seen was god made man in his frailty same god made man and man has really no strength in his own david continues to write he says the the the greatest king a king is the strongest among us right a horse you can't find safety all the strong things that we could as humans find our strength in it's all frailty yet his eyes are always upon man and in the presence of the lord our very strongest means nothing to god it's in the things we'd call weakness that the lord really shows himself mighty in yes amen let's pray father we come before you lord just one more time asking you to help each one of us to get out of the way and hear from you pray lord just take me off my notes through my notes whatever the people need i ask you lord to speak that thing to him granted father let your heart be delivered in jesus name and lord we pray all the needs god that we read tonight for ukraine we ask in jesus name amen amen you can be seated and you don't you don't have to turn there tonight but i've been going through perfect strength by perfect weakness um just something that the lord laid on my heart um a week or more ago and when brother branham takes his text he reads from hebrews 11 and i never i never caught this before so i want to read it to you hebrews 11 32 and what shall i say more say for the time would fail me to tell of gideon and of barack and of samson and of jephthah of david also and samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtain promises stop the mouth of lions quench the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword this is a pretty strong report so far and if we take it from the beginning of hebrews 11 we find out that the men and women of faith and and what their testimony is over here in the new testament that paul's writing about is all of their strengths and all that they did and and the the mightiness of the hand i mean escaping the edge of the sword quenching violent violence of fire and wrought righteousness of obtained promise mouths of lions being stopped these are all great mighty things and conquering things but yet verse 34 it says out of weakness we're made strong that's right out of their weakness they were made strong waxed valiant and fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens so this is just it's kind of a unique thing to nestle here in the midst of all of this that out of weakness they were made strong and you know i uh oftentimes it's just maybe my makeup but i i'm continually looking inward and and when i do that most of the time i see all of my weaknesses and you know it gets me down a lot and things you know so we got to be careful doing that but there's there's also a a benefit to seeing your weaknesses too and i want to get into that a little bit but just before i do as as i was listening to the message this this afternoon i don't want to dwell too much time on this but there's there's another side of of what i want to go into tonight that i i'm calling pride and arrogance and that's thinking that god needs your strength to be strong because if we look at each of these scenarios in the hebrews of faith and the heroes of faith and hebrews we can look at them and we could say oh man you know gideon mighty man of valor but when you go back and you look at the story of gideon he was spineless and when you go and you look at barack i wanna i wanna talk a little bit more about these later but when you go and you look at barack he he had he had no backbone he had a woman telling him what to do and then you look at you look at david and he's a rejected king and and getting spit on and and you know can't can't seem to have strength to serve the lord falling to women and then samson i mean we all know samson he had he had strength but yet he was weak with women and so you can you can look at all these things and and you know we could look at these stories though in samson my what strength you know look at all the great things he did but yet it's it's nothing our righteousness the bible says is as filthy rags the very best foot that we can put forward means nothing to god in the presence of god brother branham said this when but when we are thinking that we are able to do it i didn't send you any slides tonight so don't don't worry about it up there but when we are thinking that we are able to do it then god can't use us because we're wanting to do it ourselves and this is a lot of times i guess what had me really thinking about weaknesses and and strengths and things is wondering if some of my weakness isn't trying to do things in my own strength and when you do that it never works so as long as we are trying in ourselves and depending on our own abilities and so forth well we'll do nothing but when we get to a place where we know we're nothing then god can use us the important thing one of the important things that we must master now listen to this this caught my attention now remember this and especially you young preachers and then he says and lay members alike there's one thing that we got to master if we uh expect to fulfill god's desire in our life that is we have to master the thought of human ability if we ever get to a spot where we think that we can do it with our own intelligence and our own abilities we've got to master that in such a way that we get rid of the thing and lay it aside so that god can use use us that's right human ability your very best that you have to offer god we got to get rid of it now in in in you know preaching this i think we i wanted to try my best to define a little bit that there's a difference in confidence and arrogance okay because we can take these things and we can oh you know well now you know it's my strengths i gotta you know me timid you know i'm i'm nothing i gotta be humble and you're really brother branham said if you think too far that way then you don't do nothing you're too afraid to move and oftentimes i'm just being transparent using myself as an example but oftentimes i have a great fear of failure and so if i have that if i if i allow that to control me then i won't do anything you know if you're if you're if you're not failing then you're not doing anything right you're going to have mistakes you're going to have times where you've got to use the back side of the pencil and erase what you what you did because you made an error amen but we can go forward in confidence without it being arrogance so this is what i believe the lord gave me for you tonight sometimes we're afraid to show it because confidence because we don't want it to appear arrogant there's a difference in thinking you have a right so this is this is on the spiritual side now there's a difference in thinking you have a right to come to the throne of grace and you take that attitude no i have a right to come before the throne of gates there was a king who thought he had the right to go into the inner veil and he didn't have that right he was out of place it was it was in his pride that he got lifted up it was he went in in his own strength and so you can you can think that you can go to the throne of grace and you're relying because well this week i i said so many good compliments to somebody and i went to church both sunday and wednesday and i was even early one of those days and you you rely because you're a good person you know i and i've always i thought about that one time years ago long and hard i think it was it was a family member that was passing and i was just thinking and i thought how do you answer somebody when they say well but he was a good person he's going to be in heaven well i don't know that in those times necessarily is the time to really bring out you know theology and and you know doctrine and things and say no he's going to hell you know that's what a great comfort you are but i got to thinking about that from my own self and i thought you know the the lord brought my to my memory the rich young ruler and he came to go to christ and he said how do i inherit eternal life and christ looked at him and he's and he saw that he was he was upright and he and he was a good person and he and he followed the law exactly and he said you know do the commandments and he said i've done them i've been taught from my youth and then when jesus gave him the word on the matter he rejected it look at all when listen now when jesus said give up your strength because the man was drawing strength from his money in the in his possessions when jesus said give that up the man turned it down because he didn't want to show weakness but there's a difference in that and then there's a difference in coming boldly to the throne because you have a revelation that you're a nobody that he made a somebody and opened the way for you by his blood amen that gives you the boldness because boldness is is actually humility and when you come humbly realizing that you can't come before the presence of god and yourself you have you have no right within your own strength to ask god for nothing you don't deserve nothing from god but yet he made a way through his blood for you to come to the throne of grace and not only that he said come boldly come boldly recognizing what i did for you so you have no you don't rely on your strength coming and asking god for anything you come because christ made the way and he bid you come now there's a confidence that comes with experience both naturally and spiritually you know you gain as you gain experience in your job you have a confidence that yeah i can i can accomplish this task there's nothing wrong with that absolutely nothing wrong with it um now i wouldn't suggest that if you're a diesel mechanic that you go work on jet planes okay all the mechanics are saying i could do that you try it see but there's a confidence right that i've worked on so many engines that well let's look at it but to say you know no no you leave i'll get it to fly good luck so there's nothing wrong with it and there's nothing wrong with it spiritually you know there's there's there's a confidence even i i often i think about brother branham dealing with demons in in services dealing with sicknesses and after a while of even the sign in the hand he could he could take somebody by the sign and and i don't know if the angel the lord really had to tell him what it was after a while because he started recognizing it he could say this you know this pattern is this way and that's that's what it is and then even even seeing the other dimension and seeing demons crying out to each other now if you remember if you take that story when he was when he was first starting off in his ministry and uh that that that sister came and she said oh brother branham i'm lost i'm lost and she stopped at the step and found herself in the dance hall you remember the story when that demon came out brother branham was even a little bit afraid well i don't know what this is he says i don't know anything about this but he he he reached back to what he did know on the basis of the word and he spoke to that demon after a while of doing that he he i believe now i could have this wrong but i know that there's one spot i'm thinking of where he wakes up and he sees the demon in the room and it's kind of chomping and he said it looks like that comic carry character and he didn't even pay it any mind hardly it's because he had seen it so much and he had seen god's god's power not brother branham's strength casting him out but he's seen god's strength casting demons out and it created a confidence in him that god has power and authority over this other dimension and i don't have to be afraid of it i can speak in jesus name and demons have to flee because that's what the bible says amen so there's this confidence that goes as we as we live and and we toil in in the everyday of our spiritual walk now if you watch the ones who are confident and successful and i'm talking mainly spiritually but we can type this naturally if you talk to them that it's because they're always giving god the glory and the credit for where they're at their confidence they have a confidence they have an air about them that you know yes i i am successful but when you talk to them about it they take it back to what the lord's done you ask ask sister loretta how in the world do you have all your kids serving the lord and i remember her saying it's just the grace of god it's just the grace of god and when they put that back it propels their success forward and it makes it somebody we look at sister loretta that we say that's a pillar in the church that's an example that's somebody we can go talk to now and we have conf we have confidence in in them because of what they've been through he gave them the ability he gave the success he gave the blessing and he gets all the glory now i've heard people put down christians and say they really think that they're somebody and i think that they have a misunderstanding myself personally but and just to correct that a little bit they don't realize that even if they were right they show that they have the same attitude and are just as wrong by saying that so you put yourself you lift yourself up and your strength trying to say that this person is arrogant this person is is you know belittling me by the way that they live and they don't realize that they take the same attitude and they're just as wrong by saying that they have to make you have to say that you have to make yourself a little bit better than the other person that's right and and show and it shows that you have the same spirit now the prophet um so i wanted to put this in here because i was thinking about you know the prophet gives in this in this message perfect strength by perfect weakness he gives the reason we come to church and this goes along with what what has just been said the scripture says that judgment begins at the house of god and some come to church to get a pat on the back and they leave disappointed and and you know they you know you hear all kinds of things people people come one service you know you have somebody a visitor come and then they leave and they and it's just i was expecting a feel-good sermon um one guy came and i said you know he's i'm just looking for the holy spirit i said well you'll find it but just know we don't have 15-minute sermons he said okay that's that's fine and he walked out and complained it was too long and i said well you had fair warning but they come you know people come and they can expect a pat on the back and things and leave disappointed but the prophet says we come to find out where our faults are the things that we might better ourselves by and to find our bad places and i thought that was interesting i i've i've had a service on my heart and i've and i've just been putting it off but to find our bad places balak takes balaam to curse israel and he takes balaam around after it didn't work the first time he takes balaam around and he shows them the the hinder parts of israel and brother branham said that's the nasty parts that's the bad parts of the people and we come to church because judgment begins at the house of god now the minister doesn't just leave us feeling bad about ourselves he gives us the answer and he lifts us up amen the fivefold ministry is for the edification of the body you know there's something i i just love this i i so there's a message that i i love going back and listening to from time to time and and it's it's a message that was um i overheard a brother telling uh actually brother paul about it in a minister's meeting and he said this was a really good message and so i thought man i'm going to go find this out and i did and it's i just there's so many nuggets in there it's from a family camp years ago brother harold beckett it's called able ministers and i go back and i just i love listening to it and i and and i haven't shared this much but that's actually where you know a lot of things leading up showing me what my calling was here in the local assembly and and this this message just kind of when when i heard it i thought man this is everything that i feel called to so it's just been real good for me but he says you know he's talking about how people take the notion that well we only need the profit we don't need to go to church we only need the profit and he says the prophet can't can't correct you you do that because the prophet can't correct you and then he says something he says malachi 4 anoints ephesians 4. malachi 4 we're all familiar with ephesians 4 the fivefold ministry and he says ephesians 4 anoints revelations 4 and revelations 4 says come up higher so you so that's we we come to church for those things we come to find out where where our where our our our bad places are because then the ministry is saying no no there's a better way this is where this is where you're wrong but there's a better way come up higher come up higher come to christ amen so we come to church and and and we we receive encouragement and correction and building up but sometimes sometimes in services we need we need some tearing down what we've built so that god can raise up a building of his own work amen my dad's on a job right now and pray for him because he's having all kinds of problems but this this it's a little cottage on a lake and this house has no foundation to it they put it they built it right on the ground it's got these little clay pillars that's holding the house up and so it's caused all all kinds of problems and the ground's unstable and and it's collapsed a couple times so you know i just it just thinking through this it made me it made me think of this job that this house was built on on no foundation the the men who built it no doubt were strong because they were especially because they you know they weren't using the nail guns and things they were you know hauling everything up two stories to put the roof on and hammer it by hand and stuff so these men were strong and they and they built this house and it's and it's an old house it stood all this time but at some point it started rotting underneath and it's just sitting on the ground you can't build just sitting on the ground it starts to rot so what these men thought was strong building in their own strength became weak years later and so you know so we need to come to church to make sure we get the right building and the prophet said any other objective for coming to church we won't get much out of coming and so i just thought about it and i was going to list a couple of things here but i left it alone and i just thought i'd ask you and let you think about it why do you come to church and i'll just leave that there now if anyone had bragging rights it was it was paul and moses paul and moses if anyone could brag throughout the bible it was paul and it was moses moses was was grew up in the in the greatest palace in the superpower of the world of that time the military background that he had and the training and the education and and the in the promotion that moses had if anyone could brag it was him when he got his call from the lord to go and deliver israel if anyone could go in their own strength it was moses but god says you know what that ain't gonna work so moses god takes moses on the backside of the desert for 40 years and strips him of everything that moses could say is my own strength and then he sends him to israel and it and when he sends them to israel he says okay now you're ready go deliver my people he sends them with a stick an old man with a stick coming into israel saying i'm here to take over and moses could not rely on his own strength at any moment in time because if moses would have stood up and said i call for flies in his own strength they're not there would not have been one fly in all of egypt but because moses stood up in god's strength relying completely on the lord could you imagine god saying go call for flies you are absolutely helpless within yourself he had to go in the power of the lord jesus christ and the power of god in the word of the hour now paul i want to i want to read through this a little bit because paul actually gets an opportunity to brag a little bit so if you want to turn to second corinthians 11. i pray this is a help to you this evening second corinthians 11 and verse 12 is just just the back story and and if you read this you know it's just it's just amazing um what i'm what i'm getting out of the beginning of the chapter is is the people men coming in and telling the corinthian church that paul's paul's you know leading wrong is what i got out of it but he says this in verse 12 but what i do that will that i will do that i may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion now this is why he's going to brag on himself that wherein they glory they may be found even as we so paul basically steps up to the plate and he says you want to brag all right i can see him kind of roll up his sleeves and say let's let's let's have a bragging session here for a moment trying to gain so these men are trying to gain advantage above the influence of paul and paul and paul even he's he's writing to the corinthian church in one spot he says he says you know what have your fun because when i when i get there we're going to see who has power but he says you know to the corinthian church he says if you're going to follow the man with the most bragging rights then here we go now verse 12 or i'm sorry let's see i think i wrote this down wrong ii corinthians 11 12. we read that verse 16. i say again let no man think me a fool so he's kind of prefacing this is like i really don't want to do this and i'm going to seem really foolish by everything else that i've said up to this point about bragging and such but nonetheless if otherwise yet as a fool receive me that i may boast myself a little a little wait until you hear this that which i speak i speak it not after the lord but it as it were foolishly in this confidence of boasting listen what i'm about to tell you is nothing to do with the lord this is strictly bragging rights i just thought this was excellent seeing that many glory after the flesh sorry i gotta laugh seeing that many glory after the flesh i'm gonna get some glory for ye suffer fools gladly seeing ye yourselves are wise for ye suffer if a man bring you into bondage if a man devour you if a man take of you if a man exalt himself if a man smite you on the face i speak as concerning reproach as though we had been weak how be it wherever any is bold i speak foolishly now i am bold also are they hebrews so am i are they israelites so am i are they the seed of abraham big deal so am i are they ministers of christ i speak as a fool now i am more of a minister and laborers more abundant in stripes above measure i don't know if these guys were saying you know look at i got some stripes on my back paul's saying you don't even know what stripes are buddy in prison more frequent in deaths oft of the jews five times received i forty stripes save one thrice was i beaten with rods once was i stoned thrice i suffered a shipwreck a night and a day i have been in the deep in journeyings often in perils of waters and perils of robbers and perils of mine own countrymen in perils by the heathen and perils in the city and perils in the wilderness in perils in the sea in perils among false brethren are you getting the picture and weariness and painfulness and watching often in hunger and thirst if they want to brag how much they fasted in fastings i've done it often in cold and nakedness besides those things that are without that which cometh upon me daily the care of all the churches despite everything that i have to go through on a daily basis i also bear the burden of the church who is weak and i am not weak who is offended and i burn not if i must needs glory i will glory of the things which concern my infirmities the god and father of our lord jesus christ which is blessed forever more knoweth that i lie not in damascus the governor under the under euradies the king kept the city of damascus with a gut with a garrison desirous to apprehend me this king was going to hang me if he could ever get his hands on me and through a window in a basket was i let down by the wall and escaped his hands now i know this is lengthy reading but i'm getting to another spot here it is not expedient for me doubtless to glory i will come to visions and revelations of the lord so he's saying look not only do i have all this going behind my belt i will come to visions and revelations of the lord that you'll never come to yourself and then he says and i believe he's talking about himself here because i believe brother branham refers back to him he says i knew a man in christ and i'm not certain but brother branham says paul was caught up in the third heaven if i believe i have that correct and that's what paul goes into here a vision being caught up into the third heaven being given revelation that he can't even speak at this time of such and one verse 13 i'm sorry 12 5 of such and one will i glory yet of myself i will not glory but in my infirmities for though i would desire to glory i shall not be a fool i mean paul's just ripped these guys to shreds and now he's you know he keeps saying it but now he's just going to call it outright you know they're glorying but i'm not going to glory in all these things i'm just throwing it out there if that's who you want to follow but it's foolish for i will say the truth but now i forbear lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be or that he heareth of me so he just lays all of this out and he says now because the corinthian church he calls them carnal in chapter 3. he says now because they're so carnal i don't want them lifting me up because that's not what i'm here to do i'm here to lift christ up so he says unless i should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of satan to buffet me lest i should be exalted above measure for this thing i besought the lord thrice that it might depart from me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will i rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me i don't know what you're going through tonight i don't know how bad your week's been but christ speaks to paul in response to his prayer and he says my unmerited favor nothing you can do in your own strength to gain it my unmerited favor is all you need amen amen and in your weakness in your trials in your temptations and in your failings i'm made strong therefore i take pleasure in infirmities and reproaches and necessities and persecutions and distresses for christ's sake for when i am weak then am i strong in chapter 2 of first corinthians paul says i came to you not in all of this boasting i never brought this up before but i came to you in weakness in fear and in much trembling but in here the greek diaglo words that says my favor is sufficient for thee for power is perfected in weakness and i just wondered thinking of this now brother branham said real power is is knowing how to overcome i i'm not quoting that just exactly right but most gladly then i will boast rather in weakness so that the power of the anointed may abide upon me so through paul coming without all this boasting and without the words of wisdom and without giving his own strengths then god glorified paul god was glorified through paul by giving him power and demonstration of the gospel so paul bringing his weaknesses before the lord paul had to go on the backside of the desert too and be retrained and then when he gets into into his ministry then he's given power and demonstration brother branham says and then the other side of this we get these feelings and we we think that when we're insufficient and we we don't want to do it but then if we just listen to the call of god that's the very thing that god wants to get into that kind of shape so he can use us when we are insufficient ourselves then we are subjects to yield to god's spirit i'm going to read that again when we are insufficient ourselves then we are subjects to yield to god's spirit as long as we think that we can do it then we can't do it but when we get to a place where we know we can't do it then we yield ourselves to god and he does it so then if it's us trying to do it we'll fail but if we'll just yield ourselves to god then god can't fail there's only one thing that god cannot do and that's fail he can do anything else but fail but he cannot fail so let me try to wrap up here in the next few minutes when we can recognize our weaknesses we can turn them over to the lord we recognize where we need his help it's not weakness to know your weaknesses and it's not weakness to tell god of your weaknesses that's right that's right when we recognize them we recognize we need his help and we surrender that area to him and then his power is perfected in that spot in our lives the weakness doesn't go away it's always there and it can poke through at any time but when his power is abiding there and we leave that under the power of god it covers that weakness over and it actually makes it a strength in your life and i was just thinking even our sins and our mistakes god wants to cause you to be to be strengthened through you say you know i got i got this area in my life i just i just can't overcome it i i keep i keep falling but i want so bad to overcome you know god looks at that desire and when he sees that desire and you repent he don't even see the mistake but if you'll if you'll keep that before the lord and keep bringing it before god i believe that he teaches us sometimes through i don't want to say a sin cycle and i'm not trying to give you a license to sin because i can prove you by the scripture that we're not supposed to do that but for lack of better words i'm going to say you're in the cycle of sin and i wonder you know it's brother branham said you have one punch coming to you the devil has one punch that he's allotted to you and if you keep getting punched in this one area you know it's sometimes i feel like lord you know fool me once you know shame on you fool me twice shame on me you know that's what it feels like but if you keep getting punched in this one area then eventually you're going to realize you know you know oh that that hurt you get back up and you go at it again and oh that hurt and you come back at it oh that hurts and you might get hit several times but eventually you realize oh wait a minute i just block like that and then it don't hurt but at any moment now remember i said that weakness doesn't go away at any moment you can get careless and you can come up and oh oh that hurt what just happened and you know for for christians oftentimes it gives it gives us a big setback because you know no christian likes to make a mistake nobody likes to make a mistake no especially one that you keep you keep seemingly giving over to but if you get careless and you lift up then you get hit it's going to hurt so then you just you what do you do a righteous man follows seven times but he gets back up again so you get back up again and you just you keep it covered if he's gonna keep hitting you there keep it covered i feel like i'm ready to fight and are you still with me a little bit longer i'm really having a good time i was reading over in the book of romans the fourth chapter when paul wrote the divine commentary of life of abraham now we know that abraham many times got kind of frustrated like we do but when his commentary was written there wasn't any of his flusterations mentioned you see never mention them at all said abraham staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong giving praise to god he says this see and that's the way i hope mine will be wrote up there is not my mistakes and everything but just what i try to do the intention of my heart to do for god's people the intention of the heart is what god looks at let me just skip some of this here something that the lord showed me when when brother paul was going through the greatest battle ever fought and i and i started listening to it again brother branham makes the comment and he says you can't even sin until you lay god's word down you see sometimes we lose strength when we lay it down often times of our own choosing right james says of your own lust okay but if we hold that weapon and we hold tight to the word of god and we stay in the word of god and no matter what we we prioritize the word of god and prayer then you hold on to the word of god it's it's your strength it's it's the very strength in your time of weakness so don't lay down your sword amen so just real quick in closing here our weaknesses and god uses those weaknesses for his strength and then in hebrews 11 it mentioned gideon and if you think about gideon when the lord when the angel of the lord came to gideon he was hiding so when when paul's writing in hebrews this this commentary and he says he says you know through weakness they were made strong you know they're doing all these great things and he's naming them subverting the enemy driving the enemy back and then when you look at their lives you realize that there was no nothing to them that's right they they had no backbone so gideon i was thinking you know he was he was hiding he had all these excuses and then he didn't even go out on the word of the lord him probably being jew needed a sign and asked not just for one sign but two signs and you so you see this weak and this gideon weakened faith and yet god uses them and he's written in the heap in hebrews barack i i refreshed myself before service on barack and and again you can say so much on the subject but barack i believe it was deborah comes to him and she says you know prophetess and she says go up and and you're going to win and you're going to fight and and you're going to you know you're going to you're going to take it and you're going to be used of god and then barack being the man that he was said i'll go if you come with me but if you don't come with me i ain't going and i just thought what a weak backbone this guy had you know let can i say it let the wife lead the home if you lead i'll follow if you lead then i'll follow and she says you know what because you took that approach you're not going to get any glory here and then and the king that he was after that he was prophesied to take was actually killed by a woman she invited him in and then put a spike through his head and it was all because you know i was just kind of a little funny thing i thought you know barack couldn't grow a beard so he became weak beard had nothing to do with it but but brother branham says you know if you get the wishbone out of you and get a backbone and stop letting your wife wear those things or do those things then he said you know get a backbone about you and lead your home barack should have been leading not only his home but the children of israel in the battle and and judged them and and been a leader used of god but he relied on a woman to lead what strength is in that none of his own but yet he's in the hebrews samson i said we know samson brother branham said he he gave he gave god his strength but he gave delilah his heart right no glory whatsoever you could you could look at samson and you know ruddy ruddy little thing you know curly locks and just a little boy but yeah when the when the glory of god came on him he could he could take out a whole army with a with a dried up mule jawbone and you'd look at him and you'd say what strength and what power but yet god couldn't use any of it because he didn't give it to he didn't give his heart to god i mean god god did use it you understand but it wasn't to the full extent so how does he end up we look at him and he loses his strength and he's he's blind in the end of his life he he dies with the with the enemy what glory is in that and yet he's in the hebrews we could talk about david all night but i i thought a lot about david and lately about you know being a rejected king and and walking and that man spitting on him and making fun of him and calling him names and and david you know in in his weak moments you know led of the spirit of god he said no god told him to do that let him go god being led of the spirit but david we look at him fallen with bathsheba committed murder and we say what kind of man is this look at all of his weaknesses and yet and yet god said he's a man after my own heart these are paradoxes i believe that god would take our weaknesses and make them strengths you can stand to your feet as i try to just close this now what i what i really the message that i really wanted to get to you tonight is really david sums it up in the psalms you can bring you know a horse in the scripture as is power it's it's it's it's an authority on the battlefield and you know he says don't even you know a horse is a vain thing for safety well you get on a horse and you you hightail it out on that horse to safety and you think you're safe but god said that's that's nothing and oftentimes what i'm what i'm trying to say at the end of this to conclude it is we look at ourselves and we feel so weak so many times and we feel we feel we we see the we see the anxieties that we have in our daily in our daily living and we we see maybe the the mistake that you keep making and and we look at our weaknesses and you know as as christians i think oftentimes you know you don't even you can't even get the strength to come to the lord because lord look at all my weaknesses but yet what god said through the word tonight was bring your weaknesses to me and i'll give you strength bring bring your ashes and i'll give you beauty so no matter what you feel about yourself tonight god's eyes in psalms 33 maybe i'll just read that again to close blessed is the nation whose god is the lord and the people who he hath chosen for his own inheritance the lord looketh from heaven he beholdeth all the sons of men nothing you cannot hide from god he sees everything you do from the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth he fashioneth their hearts alike he considereth all their works there is no king saved by the multitude of and host a mighty man is not delivered by much strength a horse is a vain thing for safety neither shall he deliver any by his great strength behold the eye of the lord is upon them that fear him and upon them that hope and his mercy to deliver their soul from death and to keep them alive and famine you might feel weak tonight but if you bring reverence before the lord you say lord i don't i don't want to do wrong and i don't mean to do wrong and and lord i just i have no strength of my own it's that's coming to the lord and fear and and then trembling and not lord i i'm no good in myself and yet he says the eye of the lord is upon that person he'll give mercy to that person he delivers the soul out of death one day soon i believe very soon we're going to wake up in glory and then you'll have strength like you've never had before the lord is our help and our shield for our heart shall rejoice in him because we have trusted in his holy name let thy mercy o lord be upon us according as we hope in thee if you just want to bow your hearts and prayer a moment and we'll we'll change the service and worship for a little bit and you just want to be remembered in prayer just lift your hand before the lord heavenly father we come before you tonight lord and lord maybe in a chopped up not elegant way father but i pray that your heart lord what what you really had lying in my heart behind this lord would get through to the people was first we have to strip ourselves of of human ability thinking just realize that we have no strength within ourselves that our very best is as filthy rags but yet for the people to realize that in all of that you offered a trade and it's lord to us it wouldn't be a fair trade but lord how how grateful we are father that you would trade all these things [Music] and be our strength father i pray that if anyone feels weak in themselves tonight god that you would help them to look up and to see father that you're looking down and you're offering a strong hand help us lord i pray if if there's pride or arrogance in any one of us i pray that you would deliver us god give us humility lord but give us that confidence father that we can come to you because of what you did for us [Music] we love you lord i pray this would help the people tonight and encourage them lord for the rest of the week lord if anyone has a need god if anyone there be any sick among us i pray god that they would rely on your strength look to your word and be healed bless it father we love you and we praise you and we give you god all the glory in jesus christ's name amen
