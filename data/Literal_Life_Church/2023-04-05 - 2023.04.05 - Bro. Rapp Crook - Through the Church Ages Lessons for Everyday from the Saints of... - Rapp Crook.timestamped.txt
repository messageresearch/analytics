[0:00] perhaps while we were standing we can
[0:02] just turn on our Bibles to the Book of
[0:04] John chapter 12.
[0:07] um and then we'll turn over to the Book
[0:09] of Revelation
[0:10] um
[0:12] starting with the thyatirin church age
[0:16] I'm glad we all were able to make it in
[0:19] the this evening there was a lots of uh
[0:22] lots of wind down where we were some
[0:24] horizontal rain blowing this afternoon
[0:26] but uh
[0:27] we we made it
[0:31] the fire Tyrant Church ages is the
[0:34] longest age and also known as the Dark
[0:37] Ages and I was I was coming up uh today
[0:41] I got to thinking about perhaps uh
[0:46] um starting with this scripture from The
[0:47] Book of John let me just get my display
[0:49] settings correct here
[0:57] we are
[1:03] and there we are
[1:08] so here we go yes and look at the title
[1:12] will be lessons for every day from the
[1:14] Saints of thyatira none of us are in uh
[1:17] Dark Ages that stretch 900 years long
[1:20] but sometimes it feels like we're going
[1:22] through some Dark Ages so we're going to
[1:24] take a look at their experience and then
[1:26] see what God spoke to them and see if he
[1:29] can speak it to our hearts this evening
[1:30] as well but John 12 24 says verily
[1:34] verily and Jesus is speaking I say unto
[1:36] you except a corn of wheat Fallen to the
[1:39] ground and die it abideth alone but if
[1:42] it die it bringeth forth much fruit and
[1:46] I believe Jesus is speaking of his own
[1:47] life there as he lays his life down
[1:50] that's the only way for him to bring
[1:52] forth much fruit and as it is with the
[1:54] uh the the the male the groom so it is
[1:57] with his bride in the in the church ages
[2:00] the church actually ends up dying it
[2:03] seems like here in the Dark Ages but
[2:04] that's POS that makes possible then a
[2:07] resurrection of a new life that's what
[2:09] we begin to see here through this
[2:11] dietary nature let's pray Heavenly
[2:13] Father we just ask your blessing upon
[2:16] our service this evening Lord I pray
[2:18] father as we look at this uh Messiah
[2:21] tiring age and look at the the
[2:23] conditions it was in and the messenger
[2:25] you sent to deal with the problems that
[2:27] were there Lord I just pray Lord you
[2:28] would also help us to
[2:31] um to take what what you spoke to them
[2:34] and take it to ourselves or we might
[2:36] also draw encouragement to God in Jesus
[2:38] name amen you may be seated
[2:43] let's see here
[2:47] so uh maybe we can turn over the Book of
[2:49] Revelation Chapter 2 since this is the
[2:51] first service on the uh thyatiron age
[2:54] we'll we'll read what Jesus spoke unto
[2:57] them
[2:58] Revelation chapter 2 verse 18.
[3:02] and under the church unto the angel of
[3:04] the church and thyativa right these
[3:07] things set the Son of God who hath his
[3:09] eyes likened to a flame of fire and his
[3:12] feet are like fine brass so he's
[3:14] speaking with characteristics of a judge
[3:17] verse 19 I Know Thy Works in charity and
[3:22] service and faith and by patience and
[3:26] thy works and the last to be more than
[3:29] the first and this is definitely a
[3:31] working laboring church I mean he's all
[3:35] these words Works charity service Faith
[3:37] patience Works they're synonyms for one
[3:40] another almost and this is there are six
[3:42] of them there and it just seems like
[3:44] this this church is is is is laboring
[3:47] verse 20
[3:49] notwithstanding I have a few things
[3:52] against you because thou sufferest that
[3:54] woman Jezebel which calleth herself a
[3:57] prophetess to teach and to seduce my
[3:59] servants to commit fornication and to
[4:01] eat things sacrificed unto idols and
[4:04] perhaps next time we'll take a look at
[4:06] the Old Testament type that's being
[4:07] referenced here at Jezebel and how the
[4:09] Catholic Church fulfills that
[4:11] verse 21 I gave her space to repent of
[4:14] her fornication and she repented not and
[4:17] the whole Caster into a bed and then
[4:20] that commit adultery with her into Great
[4:22] Tribulation except they repent of their
[4:25] deeds and I will kill her children with
[4:29] death and brother Branham speaks this is
[4:30] going to be with a spiritual death and
[4:33] all the churches shall know that I am he
[4:35] which searches the Reigns and hearts and
[4:38] I will give unto every one of you
[4:40] according to your works
[4:42] but unto you I say unto the rest and
[4:45] fire attire as many as if not as have
[4:48] not this Doctrine and which have not
[4:49] known the depths of Satan as they speak
[4:51] I will put upon you none other burden
[4:54] but that which ye have already hold fast
[4:57] to like come and Heath over cometh and
[5:00] keepeth my Works into the end to him
[5:02] will I give power over the Nations he
[5:05] shall rule them with a rod of iron as
[5:07] the vessels of Potter shall they be
[5:09] broken to Shivers even as I received of
[5:11] my father and I will give him the
[5:14] Morning Star he that half an ear let
[5:16] them hear what the spirit saith under
[5:19] the churches a long message to this
[5:22] dietary age I think it's the longest of
[5:24] all the church ages and it's the longest
[5:26] age
[5:27] if you open to the beginning of your
[5:29] church age book whether Brandon has this
[5:31] uh this diagram of the uh of the
[5:33] Candlestick Illustrated in the
[5:36] thyatyrian age is uh from 606 to 1520.
[5:39] that's a a really long time a really
[5:43] long time
[5:44] and um you can see the the the little
[5:48] the moons with with light and darkness
[5:50] that's showing how much the proportion
[5:52] of light and darkness is given in each
[5:54] age in Ephesus this is when Paul is the
[5:56] early first apostles were just
[5:58] ministering and there's lots of light
[6:00] and the Antichrist is just beginning to
[6:02] ride but that darkness is ever
[6:04] increasing it increases deadly
[6:06] throughout that Smyrna and then I'm
[6:08] progress in the thigh attire the
[6:10] darkness is just peaking it just seems
[6:12] like the Satan is is finally winning his
[6:15] battle against the truth
[6:17] and this is just a little bit of light
[6:19] there
[6:20] um and it goes on for a very long time
[6:22] then in Sardis
[6:24] um also very dark as Luther just Begins
[6:27] the Reformation
[6:28] and this and this um bringing back to
[6:31] life the the this resurrection of this
[6:34] seed that's gone to the ground to die
[6:35] and then there's the missionary agent
[6:37] Philadelphia under the Western revivals
[6:39] there's an increase of light and then
[6:41] finally in laodicea
[6:43] um not a whole lot of light especially
[6:45] as the age ends at just going into that
[6:48] total darkness
[6:50] now one of the things I'd like to speak
[6:51] about this evening and I'll uh um this
[6:55] might seem a little bit like a history
[6:56] lesson starting out but um I convert
[7:00] some years back as I was reading um and
[7:03] reading different things I came across
[7:05] this uh this this question that somebody
[7:07] was actually a criticism that they
[7:09] pointed out that
[7:11] um yeah if you look at the thyatarian
[7:14] age whether Brandon says it starts at
[7:16] the age at the year 606.
[7:19] but if you look at the messenger that he
[7:21] points out it's it's Columba and he dies
[7:24] in 597.
[7:26] and the question was
[7:29] brother Branham
[7:31] he's dead in 597. the church age starts
[7:34] in 606 I mean don't you can't you see
[7:38] this at this in the the impression you
[7:40] get hearing at the first one was like
[7:42] man what's the church age book worth
[7:43] just throw out the window because this
[7:45] is this is impossible
[7:47] and I I didn't have a a good answer for
[7:50] that so I just kind of laid it around
[7:51] him but as I was studying for for this
[7:54] service
[7:55] um the Lord brought some answers to me I
[7:58] want to and I want to share that so this
[7:59] is a part of this is a question that I
[8:02] had for a long time and notice when you
[8:04] have a question
[8:05] um uh it doesn't mean you have to throw
[8:07] everything away seek the Lord about it
[8:09] and he'll provide the answer in his time
[8:11] and I just pray that the Lord will this
[8:13] this answer
[8:14] um this evening because I I thought
[8:16] there was a it was it was a fair
[8:18] question uh how do you uh how do you
[8:20] answer that
[8:22] um
[8:23] first I'd like to just kind of emphasize
[8:25] this these dark ages
[8:29] 900 years long
[8:33] you'd have to be a pretty extraordinary
[8:36] person
[8:37] to have to be able to influence a time
[8:40] period that goes 900 years I mean we
[8:44] just kind of go back in time we think
[8:46] George Washington what a great influence
[8:49] he's had but that's 1700s and we're not
[8:53] even 300 years since George Washington
[8:56] and you can talk about the pilgrim
[8:57] fathers William Bradford what influence
[9:01] he said but that's just 400 years
[9:05] if you think back to Christopher
[9:07] Columbus and sailed the ocean blue in
[9:10] 1492 I mean that's
[9:13] 500 not even 600 years we had to go for
[9:17] 900 years we're going all the way back
[9:19] in time
[9:22] 1100
[9:24] like the very first Crusades who from
[9:28] the year 1100 could we say would be
[9:30] still be
[9:31] having a great impact on us today I mean
[9:34] it's this is a huge time period so with
[9:37] this huge time period I think we need to
[9:39] think carefully about yeah
[9:42] who could what's the who would best be
[9:44] able to have an impact that goes that
[9:46] that long
[9:48] that's the first thing one of the kind
[9:50] of emphasize about this and it's an
[9:52] extremely extra extraordinary person be
[9:54] able to influence an entire Millennium
[9:57] practically
[9:59] and the second thing and this is kind of
[10:01] almost simplistic but
[10:04] is it possible for a man's influence to
[10:07] extend past his lifetime
[10:11] it is it is so I mean that's that's the
[10:14] easiest way to answer this this question
[10:17] a man's influence can easily extend past
[10:20] his lifetime and in the case of colomba
[10:23] that's certainly the uh that that
[10:25] certainly so
[10:27] um I want to take us back in time for um
[10:30] a few minutes and um
[10:34] in it was a tumultuous time when uh the
[10:37] couple hundred years before Columbus
[10:39] even born
[10:40] in the uh 400s
[10:43] um four in the year 410 uh this this
[10:46] time of peace that that the Roman Empire
[10:48] had enjoyed and the world around the
[10:51] Mediterranean had enjoyed for a very
[10:53] long time thanks to Rome that was Rome
[10:58] was collapsing and this time of Peace
[11:00] was also collapsing
[11:03] um in the year 410 all these Germanic
[11:05] tribes the the the Goths the visit Goths
[11:08] all these the Romans called them The
[11:10] Barbarians they're masked along one I
[11:12] forget the name of the river with their
[11:13] master I think it was along the um I
[11:15] don't I can't remember the name of the
[11:16] river but they're masked along the Rhine
[11:18] and all these all these goth soldiers I
[11:20] mean they're they're stripped naked and
[11:22] they're just doing all their their their
[11:23] their their pre-battle routines yelling
[11:26] and everything and they're going and the
[11:27] Roman soldiers are on the other side of
[11:29] the river and they're in their beautiful
[11:31] uniform and and their arm everything and
[11:33] they're ready and this is this two
[11:35] worlds two very different worlds and
[11:39] there were
[11:47] this Primal scream and these all these
[11:50] Goths just rush across and there's wave
[11:54] upon wave upon the wave and finally they
[11:56] breached the Roman lines and the Goths
[11:59] just
[12:00] eventually make it all the way to Rome
[12:04] and um I think it was that Alaric was
[12:06] his uh his his name he uh he makes it to
[12:09] Rome
[12:10] and he uh
[12:12] um the leader of the Roman city comes
[12:14] out and they have a have a parlay and um
[12:17] what would you like to have in the lyric
[12:19] basically says you can have your lives
[12:22] but I'm taking everything else in the
[12:23] city
[12:24] and they do and these barbarians they
[12:27] have a um
[12:29] that's what the Romans called I mean
[12:30] they were completely illiterate all the
[12:33] learning that had been compiled in Rome
[12:36] all the Greek learning all from every
[12:39] kind of time period if it had been
[12:41] written it was in Roman libraries
[12:44] for barbarians all right libraries are
[12:47] good for one thing
[12:48] it's great firewood I mean all these
[12:51] books just going up though they'll go
[12:54] through the libraries if they've got
[12:55] this beautiful jeweled books they'll rip
[12:57] the cover off of the and they'll save
[12:58] the jewels and they'll just they just
[13:00] Burn It Off
[13:01] all of them nothing's online nothing
[13:04] scanned no there are no backup copies I
[13:07] mean so much is just lost
[13:10] and I mean this goes all across Western
[13:14] Europe all these these these Scrolls I
[13:17] mean everything that the this is the the
[13:19] wisdom the learning of of centuries
[13:23] is gone
[13:26] and
[13:26] um
[13:27] if it hadn't been for a group of uh I
[13:31] mean there's one place there's different
[13:33] places the Roman Empire hadn't gotten to
[13:35] yet and they'd made it across the
[13:37] English Channel they admit they settled
[13:39] they made some settlements into Britain
[13:41] uh they got Hadrian's Wall they're a
[13:43] different place where you can see Roman
[13:44] settlements but they hadn't made it to
[13:47] Ireland
[13:49] Ireland was a little island just off the
[13:52] coast of of Britain they hadn't made it
[13:54] there and what you have is all these um
[13:58] on different um monks different places
[14:01] who were able to escape from The
[14:02] Barbarians they're trying to get
[14:04] West as fast as they can and they make
[14:07] it to Ireland and they have whatever
[14:09] books they can so as the rest of the
[14:12] continent is just sliding into
[14:16] Dark Ages where basically the
[14:18] Continental Europe is going illiterate
[14:21] they're they're losing literacy as
[14:24] that's happening on the continent
[14:26] Ireland is just beginning to discover
[14:29] books
[14:31] and Patrick
[14:32] the Romans call them the Saint Patrick
[14:36] and his brother Brandon mentions him in
[14:37] the church age book
[14:39] um he was at the mother Brown talks
[14:41] about he was the
[14:42] nephew of Saint Martin's wife I believe
[14:45] it was
[14:46] but he is uh he and his uh friend are
[14:50] are playing along the river Clyde in in
[14:53] England and some Irish
[14:56] um Bandits come on their little little
[14:59] coracle boats they come along and they
[15:02] kidnap Patrick and they and they take
[15:04] him to Ireland Patrick doesn't know the
[15:06] language but he stays there for a
[15:09] certain number of years and he's able to
[15:11] figure out a way to make it back to his
[15:13] homeland he does and when he goes back
[15:17] the home that he finds
[15:20] completely different because in that
[15:22] time period barbarians had gone through
[15:24] burned everything it's just like this is
[15:26] a this is this is a a world that has
[15:29] been passed
[15:31] is able to he's able to find some place
[15:33] where he can do some some Priestly
[15:36] studies and then he goes back to Ireland
[15:38] as he comes back he's he he begins
[15:40] teaching literacy and starting some
[15:43] monasteries and they begin copying work
[15:46] lots and lots of copying
[15:49] and uh um I think Patrick dies 40 or 50
[15:52] years before uh um Columba is born
[15:56] but Columba he
[16:00] um he he is he he he's from a royal uh
[16:05] one one of the clans in Ireland he's
[16:07] he's born into a one of the royal
[16:09] families he could have had a uh
[16:12] um a very good political career but he
[16:15] also becomes a uh a monk a priest
[16:18] um
[16:19] and he starts studying and he begins uh
[16:22] um copying and learning the manuscripts
[16:24] and that's he decides then through a
[16:27] uh if you read different books you get
[16:29] different stories but he leaves Ireland
[16:32] and he goes to this uh Island uh just
[16:35] off the coast of Scotland
[16:37] um far enough from Ireland that you
[16:39] can't see Ireland he's here and he
[16:41] establishes an Abbey on Iona he takes 12
[16:44] men with them and they build
[16:46] um
[16:48] and Abby there and different structures
[16:50] and they just start studying and copying
[16:53] and learning and preaching and um and
[16:57] then from column from from Columbus work
[16:59] they just start settling
[17:01] they start making
[17:03] monasteries throughout Northern Scotland
[17:06] all the way through Scotland and then
[17:08] down into England and gradually these
[17:12] um this work that Columbus starts
[17:14] spreads all the way and back into Europe
[17:17] into the continent all the way into
[17:20] Eastern Europe as far south as Italy and
[17:22] you can see in the Scribe in in these in
[17:25] these um manuscripts that get copied in
[17:28] these Irish monasteries throughout
[17:30] Europe they use the same kind of
[17:32] calligraphy and this is this is work
[17:35] from the Irish scribes
[17:38] if the Irish scribes hadn't been doing
[17:39] this we wouldn't have
[17:42] a lot of the learning from Western
[17:44] Civilization would have been gone most
[17:46] of our translations of the Bible of the
[17:49] old New Testaments they might have
[17:50] existed still in Byzantium and East in
[17:54] the Eastern Orthodox church but they
[17:56] would have been lost to the West
[17:58] this is his influence
[18:01] is profound because he start he he he
[18:04] starts this Mission this Irish
[18:07] missionary effort going through Northern
[18:09] Scotland through the through the picked
[18:12] people and then down into England and
[18:14] then across the channel re I mean
[18:17] basically bringing the gospel back
[18:19] to where it had originally been and he's
[18:22] re-establishing it laying the groundwork
[18:26] for a Reformation that was going to
[18:29] begin several hundred years after his
[18:31] lifetime
[18:33] because in order for there to be a
[18:34] Reformation you have to have the
[18:36] manuscripts
[18:37] and he it was the Irish monks who were
[18:41] the ones who were copying those
[18:42] manuscripts Faithfully Faithfully
[18:44] faithfully and then spreading them and
[18:46] taking them further taking them further
[18:48] taking them further
[18:50] so colomba might have died nine years
[18:52] before his church age started but this
[18:55] missionary impulse that he is so much
[18:57] behind that just goes on and takes on a
[19:00] life of its own it's evangelizing all of
[19:03] England and where is the center of the
[19:05] Reformation
[19:06] go off I mean we talked about Luther but
[19:10] John Wycliffe in the year 1300 he's
[19:13] still that's still in the thigh attire
[19:15] and age he starts translating the Bible
[19:17] and would that have been possible if
[19:21] there weren't manuscripts formed a
[19:23] translate off of
[19:25] and then wycliffe's work
[19:27] um he Wycliffe is teaching at Oxford and
[19:29] while he's teaching Oxford
[19:31] and there are um there are students of
[19:33] John Huss who's from uh
[19:35] um Eastern Eastern Europe
[19:38] um
[19:39] students are there and they take
[19:41] wycliffe's ideas back to Huss and Huss
[19:44] is Huss dies about a hundred years
[19:47] before Luther's 95 Theses
[19:49] and this and this Huss is burning at the
[19:51] stake
[19:52] um he's uh present enough to be able to
[19:55] make a pod you might be able to burn
[19:58] this Goose because his last name means
[20:00] Goose but there is going to come a swan
[20:02] that you won't be able to burn and
[20:04] Luther's coat of arms was out of a swan
[20:07] and so this this is just beautifully
[20:10] orchestrated
[20:12] how how could the Reformation have
[20:14] started without manuscripts to work from
[20:16] and Columbus got this this this this
[20:19] this missionary effort Drive
[20:23] transcribing the word that that lays all
[20:26] the seeds out there
[20:28] for it to take place later
[20:30] so
[20:31] thyatyrus messenger
[20:33] um extends far past his lifetime
[20:38] and in order to have an impact over a
[20:40] thousand years
[20:42] you'd have to have something that would
[20:44] just continue to go and go and go
[20:47] um
[20:48] in order to um that would take it on its
[20:50] own life powered by the Holy Spirit
[20:53] I just want to share with you um a
[20:55] couple quotations from a book I read the
[20:57] last couple weeks How the Irish saved
[21:00] civilization and the author does mean
[21:03] this to be kind of ironic because the
[21:06] Irish over time if usually been the the
[21:08] butt of civilizations jokes I mean the
[21:11] Irish I mean they're they're a lot of
[21:13] Irish jokes out there but they saved
[21:16] civilization
[21:17] without the mission of the Irish monks
[21:20] who single-handedly refounded European
[21:24] civilization throughout the continent in
[21:27] the bays and valleys of their Exile the
[21:29] world that came after them would have
[21:31] been an entirely different one A World
[21:34] Without books
[21:36] and our own world would never have come
[21:39] to be
[21:40] and Columbus work
[21:42] he starts this mission of the Irish
[21:45] monks
[21:46] and it just you that God uses the Irish
[21:49] she just kind of thoughts me if I
[21:51] preached it two weeks within it right
[21:52] before St Patrick's Day which is why I
[21:54] colored things green but I I kept it
[21:56] that way
[21:57] um but God hath chosen the foolish
[21:59] things of the world to confound the wise
[22:02] it's like Satan has got he's used the
[22:04] the mighty sword of Rome uh to take out
[22:07] the truth all over the place but in one
[22:10] little corner of Ireland that Satan
[22:12] didn't even think it was worth his time
[22:13] going there because those those Celts
[22:16] are just a bunch of uh Heathen
[22:18] barbarians that are crazy
[22:20] that's where God used this work to
[22:23] restart his Reformation he's chosen the
[22:26] weak things of the world to confound the
[22:28] things which are mighty
[22:29] as Columba is uh is is paddling away
[22:33] from Ireland and his little uh coracle
[22:36] with this 12 men are going with him
[22:39] um this writer says Columbus journey to
[22:41] Iona would forever change the course of
[22:46] Western history
[22:48] because he's establishing something
[22:49] we're going to be copying these we're
[22:52] copying not it wasn't just the word of
[22:54] God it was it was there were other
[22:56] things besides the New Testament the Old
[22:58] Testament that that were being copied
[22:59] there were Greek literature Roman
[23:01] literature all these things are being
[23:02] copied
[23:03] but with if if if the word of God hadn't
[23:07] been copied at all then there would have
[23:09] been much less for Luther and other men
[23:11] of God to work with later
[23:14] and after um
[23:16] after uh um Columbus he he he found
[23:20] different monasteries he and his
[23:22] followers because basically he would
[23:23] have his 12 men that would be with them
[23:25] they'd establish this this little
[23:27] commune um and the the picture that we
[23:30] showed at the beginning is uh
[23:32] of him as he's going
[23:34] um you can see it being constructed some
[23:36] of the pictures you look up on the
[23:37] you'll find of him him praying and then
[23:40] sowing seeds and as his sowing seeds
[23:43] he's he's praying they're making a
[23:45] settlement but soon after he and his 12
[23:48] followers would do this people from
[23:50] around the local area would come they'd
[23:52] be teaching the word of God and they'd
[23:54] be evangelizing the area and once this
[23:56] and it keeps has said the limit once
[23:58] there were 130 people this particular
[24:00] spot then he said another 12 men out and
[24:02] they'd go and settle another spot and
[24:05] evangelize that area like they didn't
[24:07] have cars then so you have to have lots
[24:08] of different Circles of of influence to
[24:11] get the whole uh hold the whole the
[24:12] whole region then once that place was
[24:14] evangelized officially then they would
[24:15] go on further and further and further
[24:18] and it was just extraordinarily
[24:20] effective
[24:22] it says the Irish monks launched a
[24:24] spiritual invasion of England from their
[24:26] Island Monastery of lindisfire
[24:30] and all of England north of the Thames
[24:32] was indebted to the Celtic mission for
[24:35] its conversion and we'll just see if I
[24:38] can
[24:39] zoom in here a little bit here
[24:41] so you can see there uh let's see if I
[24:44] can get there
[24:47] uh this can happen no I can't do both so
[24:50] here you've got uh he goes up to Iona
[24:52] from Iona they evangelize all of the
[24:55] picks here and then there's the little
[24:57] colony of of lindisfauna and from
[24:59] Linda's Farm they they go all the way
[25:01] into England and they're evangelizing
[25:03] there and then all of these monasteries
[25:06] these are medieval Sinners of Irish
[25:09] Christian influence this was their it
[25:11] stretches so far all the way through uh
[25:15] all all the way through Europe it's just
[25:18] amazing all how far these men traveled
[25:22] and as they're going they're bringing
[25:24] the manuscripts with them all the way
[25:26] they're basically reseeding everything
[25:29] that The Barbarians had burnt up I mean
[25:33] this this man Colombo he does have an
[25:36] outsized influence because it's not just
[25:38] his life that's influenced but it's the
[25:41] work that he got started and he's got
[25:42] disciples who are doing the very same
[25:44] thing that he would he he was doing
[25:47] and if we look carefully at what the
[25:49] Book of Revelation says to thyatira it
[25:52] says I Know Thy works and charity and
[25:55] service and faith and my patience and
[25:58] thy works and the last to be more than
[26:02] the first
[26:03] and the Columbian his Irish monks do a
[26:07] lot of work but after a couple hundred
[26:09] years of doing this
[26:12] the church does kind of stamp it out
[26:15] but the word has been receded
[26:18] and then you've got John Wycliffe and
[26:20] John Huss and other men at the End of
[26:24] the Age who pick up the work
[26:26] I mean John Wycliffe he starts
[26:28] translating into English and the the
[26:30] Catholic church in England didn't like
[26:33] that at all and he eventually got kicked
[26:35] out of Oxford for it and he goes back
[26:38] um to his little Country Church
[26:40] and he just starts translating there but
[26:42] it's not him translating by himself he
[26:44] has a whole group of young men working
[26:47] with him they're all working on this
[26:49] translation together and he sends these
[26:51] young men out to preach and they're
[26:53] called LawLers which is actually a um I
[26:55] think a turn to make fun of them they
[26:57] were called Bible men and he sends them
[26:59] out all over all of England's preaching
[27:01] preaching preaching this is very much
[27:03] like what Columbus had done but and then
[27:06] John Huss is doing the same thing
[27:08] and Eastern Europe but you can see how
[27:10] the last works
[27:12] were more than the first it was even
[27:14] more abundant land the foundation
[27:16] because us is right he's just a hundred
[27:19] years before Luther and then man it's
[27:22] like the fuse just blows and uh and and
[27:25] the truth is going all over the place
[27:29] brother brother Branham talking about
[27:30] this he says the few believers
[27:33] labored and thyatira they labored more
[27:36] fervently as the darkness increased
[27:38] until toward the end of the age many
[27:41] arose attempting reforms
[27:44] where cliff and Huss for example and
[27:46] their labors were so fervent they paved
[27:49] the way for the oncoming Reformation as
[27:51] the word says your last or End of the
[27:54] Age works
[27:56] are more
[27:57] than the first
[27:59] so it's just uh it's just I think it's a
[28:02] the what what happens in history matches
[28:05] what is described there in the book of
[28:08] uh revelation
[28:11] but um
[28:13] um brother Branham talks about Columba
[28:15] he says the pure gospel that was
[28:16] preached by Columbo and his fellow
[28:18] workers spread over the whole of
[28:19] Scotland turning it to God and it also
[28:23] overflowed in into Ireland England over
[28:25] northern Europe This is what what he
[28:27] does and brother Brennan described his
[28:28] means of spreading the gospel with with
[28:30] 12 men going and building a gospel
[28:32] centered town and then he talks about
[28:34] how he had this uh this school and this
[28:37] island off the coast of Scotland and
[28:39] from here went forth many scholars
[28:40] empowered with the with wisdom and the
[28:42] word of God and it was it was a
[28:45] long-term it was a it was a long-term
[28:47] mission for Colombia
[28:50] had long-term impact one French monastic
[28:53] historian
[28:55] um has called him a warrior Monk and he
[28:59] created Colombo created by his singular
[29:02] determination illiterate Christian
[29:04] Society among the Scots and pics of
[29:07] Northern Britain and now after his death
[29:09] a fresh wave of his stout-hearted sons
[29:12] began to affect the same transformation
[29:14] among the Pagan angles of northumbria
[29:18] there in northern England
[29:20] from there to soon
[29:22] um to be fabulous Island Monastery of
[29:24] Linda's feiner and then as colomba had
[29:28] baptized Scotland so his follower would
[29:30] do for all of northern England and
[29:32] Columba now became the model for all who
[29:35] would earn the ultimate Victory monks
[29:37] began to set off in every direction bent
[29:39] on glorious and heroic exile for the
[29:42] sake of Christ many of the Exiles I mean
[29:45] he's got folks who are going somewhat
[29:47] North others went Northwest like Brenda
[29:49] the Navigator going to Iceland Greenland
[29:51] even North America
[29:53] many of the Exiles found their way to
[29:55] Continental Europe and um they
[29:58] fearlessly brought ancient civilization
[30:00] back to its ancient home and that was
[30:03] the the effect of Columbus Ministry
[30:07] there
[30:08] and it was a very outsized effect
[30:11] um
[30:12] this one mentioned a couple other things
[30:14] here
[30:15] um
[30:18] page 242.
[30:26] brother Brandon says when I read the
[30:28] history of this great servant of God the
[30:29] wonderful work he did it saddened my
[30:32] heart to find that the papal power
[30:33] lesson to bring all men into its grasp
[30:35] came and eventually defiled these
[30:38] Mission fields and destroyed the truth
[30:41] as it was taught by Colombo So
[30:43] eventually papal power seems to win the
[30:46] day like I said
[30:49] the field had been reseeded and it was
[30:52] able to be picked up later
[30:54] so I think that for as I read this book
[30:57] of Irish safe civilization
[30:59] um that kind of answered the question
[31:01] for me that I think brother Brandon
[31:02] picked the right guy
[31:04] um he just had an outsized uh influence
[31:07] and it's certainly possible to have an
[31:08] influence beyond your lifetime and
[31:10] Columbus certainly had that
[31:14] second part I'm really in I was really
[31:17] impacted by
[31:19] um
[31:20] by what Christ speaks to the Via tiring
[31:25] age in the second half of his his
[31:28] message
[31:29] I know your Works your charity your
[31:33] service your faith your patience your
[31:36] works this was a working age
[31:40] and as I got to thinking about it we can
[31:42] go through times like that in their life
[31:43] where it just seems like Lord I'm just
[31:45] I've been going on for a long time and I
[31:48] see so little fruit and I read that
[31:51] scripture again and I thought man that
[31:53] seems to describe
[31:56] A Mother's Day sometime
[31:59] that I'm just doing again I'm I just
[32:02] cleaned the house and I've got to clean
[32:04] it again I've just told the kid no no no
[32:06] and I'm doing something else I've got to
[32:08] do it again again again it seems like I
[32:11] don't know but it seems like parenting
[32:12] is like this period of Dark Ages that
[32:15] we're just trying to press through and
[32:17] we're almost there and we're going to
[32:18] make it we're going to make it that's
[32:20] how there are there are some light
[32:21] points that come up every now and then
[32:23] but
[32:25] this is how we feel maybe right now
[32:27] there's a mom but maybe there's a dad in
[32:28] the office wherever we are we feel
[32:30] sometimes
[32:32] does any does anybody appreciate what
[32:34] I'm doing around you I come home from
[32:35] work sometimes and I'm I'm all thinking
[32:38] about my day and then I asked my wife so
[32:42] what have you been up to today I said
[32:44] are you checking up on me do you think
[32:45] I'm just eating bon bons all day what do
[32:48] you think I've been doing I actually did
[32:49] vacuum I actually did mop you can't tell
[32:51] anymore because kids been running out
[32:53] the dogs are running it out but we have
[32:55] been doing something does anybody even
[32:57] see what I'm doing around here and then
[32:58] you start thinking my is that a new
[33:00] dress you have on you try to think what
[33:02] can I notice and I just get lucky that
[33:04] I've noticed something because I want to
[33:05] notice that I try to appreciate
[33:07] something because it does feel like that
[33:08] sometimes
[33:10] but the first thing that God speaks to
[33:13] thyat Tire this this church is so
[33:15] ferving in their charity their service
[33:17] their faith their Works their patience
[33:19] their works the first thing he speaks to
[33:22] them is
[33:24] I know
[33:27] so
[33:28] sisters your husbands might not always
[33:30] notice the things that you do
[33:34] but God sees
[33:37] there's not a single work that we can do
[33:40] as a single act of service no matter how
[33:43] small that God misses
[33:46] he knows and there's all this I mean
[33:50] Columba could look back and of course
[33:52] he's he's dead so he couldn't have
[33:54] looked back except from eternity and at
[33:56] that point he's not in the griping state
[33:58] of mind you can look back I've been
[33:59] doing all this in the Church of Rome
[34:01] comes and squashes it and think
[34:03] what did I do it for anyway
[34:06] you can have that sense sometimes why
[34:08] did I even try what's the use of trying
[34:09] because it's something like the devil's
[34:11] going to win anyhow no
[34:13] God sees he values
[34:16] I know
[34:18] he also knows how much we can take
[34:21] we don't know that we think we can only
[34:25] take this much
[34:26] but God knows the strength of his
[34:28] attributes in us and he knows that we're
[34:31] just we feel like we're gone here but we
[34:33] can take up to here and he's going to
[34:35] help us discover that strength along the
[34:38] way and but he will not put more upon us
[34:41] then we can bear I'll put no other
[34:44] burden on you and then he says lastly
[34:46] hold fast till I come because I am
[34:50] coming
[34:51] hold on don't give up because the devil
[34:54] wants to make you think it's worthless
[34:55] stop worrying about being a good mom or
[34:57] dad because this is such a dark world
[35:00] you're not gonna have any impact on your
[35:01] kids lives anyway but no
[35:03] holds fast keep on going
[35:06] so just kind of start talking about
[35:07] first
[35:09] I I know
[35:11] perhaps we can turn our Bibles to the
[35:12] book of Nehemiah chapter 3.
[35:15] there are lots of examples in scripture
[35:17] where we can see
[35:19] um
[35:20] how how God does see and he does know
[35:23] but I think in Nehemiah chapter 3 and
[35:25] this is um one of these uh
[35:28] um Bible chapters it's just a long list
[35:31] but this is a list that shows God sees
[35:36] and this is a list um
[35:39] chapter 3 verse verse one Elijah the
[35:42] high priest rose up with his Brethren
[35:44] the priests and they build up the Sheep
[35:46] gate they Sanctified it they set up the
[35:48] doors of it evens the Tower of Mia they
[35:51] Sanctified at the tower of hananil and
[35:54] next unto him build the demand of
[35:55] Jericho next to them the son of Emery
[35:59] and this is over the whole chapter it's
[36:02] basically saying which families are
[36:05] building what parts of the gates and if
[36:07] you read this like at 10 o'clock at
[36:08] night you might make it to verse 10 and
[36:10] you're done but if you realize these
[36:13] people
[36:14] they might have gone up that morning and
[36:16] think man I really don't feel like going
[36:17] out and working on the gates today but
[36:19] oh if I don't I'm going to feel guilty
[36:22] so I'm going to go ahead and do it
[36:22] anyway
[36:23] we're and they're doing it and they
[36:25] might think is anybody really even
[36:26] paying attention to any out but God saw
[36:29] it and it's recorded their faithness is
[36:32] recorded and you can go through here one
[36:35] of my favorites is um
[36:37] um
[36:38] is verse 12.
[36:40] next unto this other family repaired
[36:43] Shalom of hello Hesh the ruler of half
[36:47] the part of Jerusalem he and his
[36:49] daughters his daughters are mentioned
[36:51] God saw that half that the mayor of half
[36:55] of Jerusalem and his girls were out
[36:58] there repairing the city and the next
[37:00] verse says
[37:02] um the let's see here the valley gate
[37:05] repaired handling and the inhabitants of
[37:07] zenoa they built it set up the doors
[37:09] threw up the locks throughout the bars
[37:11] throughout they just keep right on going
[37:12] right on going and they talk about from
[37:14] every single of life
[37:16] um they also see in like in five next
[37:19] under this other family the ticoitra
[37:21] appeared but their nobles did not put
[37:24] their necks to the work of the Lord
[37:27] God sees what people are doing he sees
[37:29] what people aren't doing God sees he
[37:32] knows there's not a single thing that
[37:34] you will do for God that he will not
[37:36] recompense you for in some way
[37:38] he will bless you abundantly for whether
[37:41] in this life of the life to come
[37:43] he will bless it he sees it he knows
[37:47] and just knowing
[37:49] that somebody sees knows and appreciates
[37:53] oh that gives that positive energy that
[37:56] puts some wind in the sails to carry on
[37:58] because you know what we're put here
[38:03] to labor and to be of service
[38:06] we're saved by grace through faith not
[38:10] of ourselves it's the gift of God it's
[38:12] not of work sustaining a man should
[38:13] boast
[38:14] we are his workmanship we are created in
[38:19] Christ Jesus unto good works
[38:22] we are I mean if you're unemployed you
[38:25] have nothing to do that's a really
[38:27] really difficult trial not having not
[38:31] having work to do
[38:33] we're created in Christ Jesus unto good
[38:36] works God hath ordained works for us to
[38:39] do that we might be able to walk in them
[38:41] and there is incredible gladness and Joy
[38:45] by doing work for the Lord
[38:48] I love this Psalm 92 you Lord have made
[38:51] me glad through your work if we can get
[38:56] a vision of the work that God has given
[38:58] us to do is his work that we can
[39:01] experience gladness because of it I will
[39:04] Triumph in the works of thy hands
[39:07] because whose hands are God's hands
[39:11] these hands are we will try God you have
[39:14] when I when we can see that I can
[39:17] remember this was about 15 years ago I
[39:19] was I just taught two years at school
[39:21] and I was close to really being burned
[39:24] out and I was seeking inspiration One
[39:26] Summer Lord I needed some gasoline to
[39:28] help get through this next year and God
[39:31] gave me this verse Lord you've made me
[39:34] glad through your work this what you've
[39:36] given me to do is your work and I really
[39:38] am glad by it I will Triumph in the
[39:40] works of your hands I could see this
[39:42] this is what we're called to do and we
[39:44] when we sincere that whether it be
[39:46] whether you're you're a a a carpenter
[39:49] whether you're a nurse whether you're a
[39:51] welder whether you're a delivery man
[39:53] wherever you are wherever you are you're
[39:55] God's hands your God's mouth your God's
[39:59] eyes we can be an influence for wherever
[40:02] we are when we can see that yes I'm
[40:04] going to work today because
[40:06] whether I'm working in the office or
[40:08] here at church wherever I am all work is
[40:12] God's work there's not
[40:14] a Christian profession and a carnal
[40:17] profession you're a Christian whatever
[40:19] you do God is with you
[40:21] and you are serving him by it
[40:25] in the smyrnian church age
[40:27] um brother Branham says all too little
[40:29] time is spent on laboring for the
[40:31] Eternal rewards of God
[40:34] the recompense of God is too lightly
[40:37] esteemed if we believe in the reality of
[40:40] the resurrection of the body and the
[40:43] Eternal Kingdom of substance that we
[40:45] ought to lay up in heaven those good
[40:47] Treasures that are available to the
[40:48] faithful Saints because God keeps Good
[40:50] Records
[40:51] Nehemiah chapter 3 shows he keeps Good
[40:53] Records
[40:55] a church age on page 246 brother Brandon
[40:58] says I want to give a warning right here
[41:01] it says concerning the last days that
[41:04] because of abounding iniquity the love
[41:06] of many will wax cold
[41:09] in the laodicea and or the last stage
[41:11] self-love and love for material things
[41:14] will take the place of the true love of
[41:17] God
[41:18] we need to guard against the power of
[41:20] sin in these last days because so many
[41:22] are getting so hardened because they
[41:25] haven't realized the effect of this last
[41:27] day spirit because when we're just
[41:29] wanting to please ourselves and that is
[41:31] the default nowadays it's one to please
[41:35] ourselves then really it's it's it takes
[41:37] effort to get up off our couch where
[41:39] we've been having watching our screen
[41:40] putting that away and doing something
[41:42] for somebody else but when we do that
[41:45] we're actually getting in touch with
[41:46] other people serving God in this way oh
[41:49] wow it's a it brings strength and energy
[41:52] and you will leave being more encouraged
[41:54] than had you stayed there and defeated
[41:56] the enemies at the next level of your
[41:59] game
[42:00] I Know Thy Works they'll last be more
[42:02] than the first brother Branham is
[42:04] quoting he says as the darkness of the
[42:06] age increased as The Honorable of the
[42:08] martyrs grew a lengthier day by day the
[42:12] Saints worked all the harder they served
[42:14] all the more and their faith increased
[42:18] if you want to have increase in your
[42:19] faith do something for God because you
[42:22] will see you you'll realize how little
[42:24] you can do then you'll step out and say
[42:26] wow something really great happened
[42:29] there and it wasn't because of me you'll
[42:31] see that God does something so you want
[42:32] more faith do something
[42:36] how tragic it was that in the Ephesian
[42:39] age love waned and truly nothing instead
[42:41] of the increased Labor of Love on the
[42:43] other ages but in this age in the
[42:45] darkest of all ages they served him even
[42:48] more
[42:49] what a lesson that is there is no
[42:51] ceasing of this gracious service of Love
[42:53] unto the Lord but rather increasing of
[42:55] it that is the secret let the enemy
[42:59] attempt to thwart our service to the
[43:01] Lord our reply is increased service
[43:04] because that's what we're created to do
[43:06] or created to go out and serve him more
[43:11] then Revelation 2 24 this is where
[43:15] Christ says I will put upon you no other
[43:18] burden how can I take something else on
[43:20] the course there are times we need to
[43:21] know or no we need to know our own
[43:23] boundaries but um
[43:25] we can trust God that he knows what we
[43:27] can what we can't handle whatever burden
[43:31] we're bearing we can be rest assured
[43:33] that our trial has been customed
[43:36] designed for you
[43:39] we can look at somebody else's truck I
[43:41] wish I had that person's trial and I've
[43:44] heard the story told where somebody is
[43:46] in this dream and they they want
[43:47] somebody else's Trouse they take their
[43:49] trial off and put that guy's backpack on
[43:51] and it just doesn't fit right and it
[43:54] just it doesn't it sticks in the wrong
[43:56] place it just doesn't work by the end of
[43:58] the day they come back to the room to
[43:59] the ones picking up their trial and the
[44:01] one they leave with that fits the best
[44:02] was the one they started with the one
[44:05] that God fitted them for our trials have
[44:07] been custom made for us
[44:10] to be a we couldn't bear anybody else's
[44:13] burden God gives us Grace to Bear what
[44:17] he puts upon us and um
[44:21] to use an analogy
[44:22] um
[44:24] when we're bearing burdens I like to
[44:26] think about God being our
[44:28] our spotter
[44:31] in the weight room you can tell I don't
[44:33] go to the weight room very often but I
[44:36] remember I was in the in college and I
[44:38] was at my roommate was a guy named
[44:40] Dorian he threw the discus for the track
[44:42] team and his his arms like the size of
[44:46] my thighs he was he was a big guy so
[44:47] after a while man I'm missing an
[44:49] opportunity here I should ask Dorian if
[44:52] he could take me out of the gym and we
[44:54] could work out together they could show
[44:55] me he could kind of show me through the
[44:56] ropes and he did he didn't it was rough
[45:00] it was rough but you know when he got
[45:02] somebody who's spotting for you you're
[45:04] pushing up you he doesn't do much at all
[45:07] he might just put his finger underneath
[45:09] that bar and just knowing that his
[45:12] fingers right underneath that bar and
[45:14] thinking that his just him with a little
[45:16] finger pushing up that might be just
[45:19] enough for you to push it the rest of
[45:20] the way up complete the rep
[45:22] just knowing that God is with us
[45:26] we are able to we've got there's a lot
[45:27] more I can never get this I could never
[45:30] get
[45:30] to God take burden from me and all God
[45:33] does is put a finger underneath that
[45:34] weight
[45:36] and it might just be mental knowing it's
[45:38] there he might not even do anything or a
[45:40] spotter but knowing it's there we
[45:42] discover strength I can do it that in
[45:45] that power of encouragement that's what
[45:47] the sponsor does he encourages
[45:49] and then we saw man we we believe in the
[45:52] strength that God has put within us and
[45:54] we push out again
[45:56] because there is no temptation that's
[45:58] taken this but such as is common to man
[46:00] God is faithful and if you've got a
[46:03] spotter you don't want a spotter who's
[46:05] there on this phone the whole time
[46:08] because you might really need him a good
[46:11] spot there's not going to be on this
[46:12] phone the good spot is not going to be a
[46:14] lawly gag now talking to everybody else
[46:16] he's gonna be right there with you and
[46:18] we have a faithful spotter God is
[46:21] faithful he's right there he got this
[46:24] you got this you got this you gotta need
[46:26] a little help
[46:28] and he helps you lift it up he will not
[46:31] suffer you to be tempted above that you
[46:33] are able
[46:34] but will with them Temptation also make
[46:37] a way of Escape that you may be able to
[46:39] bear it
[46:41] always makes a way of Escape
[46:44] we don't always take the way of Escape
[46:47] but when we go back through and do a
[46:49] post-mortem on what just happened oh
[46:52] I could have stopped there that was that
[46:55] was the point where I could have there
[46:57] is a way of Escape he's there he's a
[46:59] faithful spotter
[47:03] the word for burden is weight or
[47:06] pressure
[47:07] um this back up again Galatians chapter
[47:10] 6 talks about bury one another's burdens
[47:12] and so fulfill the law of Christ
[47:14] and then a few verses later it says let
[47:16] every man bear his own burden
[47:19] I think when we try to bury each other's
[47:20] burdens we want to take this image of
[47:22] the spotter with us
[47:23] because if we're always
[47:25] being Superman for everybody's trials
[47:27] and taking their trials off of them a
[47:30] spotter doesn't do that
[47:32] a spotter this is still your trial we
[47:35] don't take the trial away from them and
[47:36] save the day every single time where
[47:39] they're encouraging them so they will
[47:41] push through it otherwise they will
[47:43] never learn that they actually have the
[47:46] muscle and the strength to do it so yes
[47:48] we bear each other's burdens
[47:50] teaching each other that we can all that
[47:52] God gives us a strength to Bear our own
[47:53] burden the right way
[47:57] the word for burden is weight or
[47:59] pressure
[48:01] the pressure of the Dark Ages would
[48:03] either Bend or be broken bow or die was
[48:05] the age of the Inquisition the power of
[48:07] the Empire backing up satanic worship be
[48:10] organized or pay with your life
[48:12] each age
[48:14] has had its pressures
[48:16] and I like to think I mean laodicea is
[48:18] not we can't really call it an age of an
[48:20] Inquisition
[48:22] but I think we can call it a kind of a
[48:24] Dark Age if you look at the diagram
[48:25] where the Branham had it's kind of
[48:27] Darkness what thyatira had and you know
[48:30] what in the Dark Ages Satan try to
[48:33] destroy all the manuscripts all the word
[48:35] of God he didn't succeed
[48:37] he doesn't do that now
[48:38] what he does is he gives you so many
[48:41] other things
[48:43] that truth becomes trivial
[48:46] that that that the truth is drowned in
[48:49] the sea of irrelevance you can look on
[48:51] your phone and before you can actually
[48:52] even find your Bible app or the message
[48:55] app you go through so many notifications
[48:57] about that most of the time you really
[49:00] don't you could have found out about
[49:01] them tomorrow the next church service
[49:03] you just go through all of you look at
[49:04] all the pictures oh that is so cute that
[49:06] is so cute that is so cute by the time
[49:08] we look through all the cute things we
[49:10] forgot we picked up the phone for first
[49:12] in the first place
[49:14] and it's just it's it's lost there and
[49:16] none of the things we did on the phone
[49:17] just now we're wrong none of them were
[49:20] but Satan has done this
[49:23] create an age with a different kind of
[49:24] pressure so he hasn't taken the truth
[49:27] away from us but he's taken our
[49:28] attention away from the truth and the
[49:30] accomplishes purpose that way
[49:33] it says each age has had its pressures
[49:36] for example a great burden of the last
[49:38] stage is the pressure of riches
[49:39] soft-living and nervous tensions we know
[49:42] about so many more things that we have
[49:44] business knowing about we know about
[49:46] every single natural disaster in the
[49:49] world if we want to we know about all
[49:51] the crime that happens across I mean we
[49:53] know all these things all that knowledge
[49:55] would make you nervous if you tried to
[49:58] process it it's impossible to and we're
[50:01] just gonna we try and keep up with
[50:03] everything trying to keep up with
[50:04] everything and um we we're we're not
[50:08] made for that
[50:09] and I just kind of like going back to
[50:11] this I mean this is the this is the this
[50:14] is what what the gerbil is running
[50:16] through
[50:17] we can say hey God has made me glad
[50:19] through thy Work I'm triumphing through
[50:20] the work of my hands what God has called
[50:22] me to do and then I until I go up on
[50:24] LinkedIn and see what my buddy from
[50:26] college is now doing and what he's up to
[50:29] is like man
[50:30] or my buddy from high school what's
[50:32] going on there wow all of a sudden what
[50:35] we think and we're so happy that God has
[50:36] called us you and then we think what
[50:38] other people are doing and what they're
[50:39] achieving and all these other things or
[50:41] we're very happy with our house until we
[50:43] open Instagram and see somebody else's
[50:44] house it's a perfect family vacation
[50:47] until we open somebody else's perfect
[50:49] time of the vacation and yeah then our
[50:51] we lose the happiness that God is
[50:54] already giving us because we're seeing a
[50:56] certain happiness that is projected that
[50:59] isn't always even the the the case
[51:02] but um I want to go back
[51:06] we fought our good fight we finished our
[51:10] course
[51:11] we want to have a single-minded goal I
[51:14] believe Columba and the Saints the Dark
[51:16] Ages they had a single-minded gold this
[51:19] is what God's called me to do I'm going
[51:20] to get this word spread for this age I'm
[51:22] gonna do it and that's what they were
[51:23] doing well we have today through all the
[51:27] media devices we have such diffuse
[51:31] possibilities it's hard to keep in our
[51:33] eye this is my goal this is what God has
[51:35] called me to I'm called to do this and
[51:38] I'm gonna when I when I do when I
[51:40] fulfill this particular calling in my
[51:42] life this is this is the sweet spot for
[51:44] me this is where I'm this is where I
[51:46] have my joy and God's blessing and we
[51:48] say I got this other goal I'm gonna have
[51:50] this kind of a car I want to have this
[51:51] other kind of thing I'd like to have
[51:52] this done in my house I like to have
[51:53] this like all of a sudden we've got our
[51:55] energy spread out but we don't have to
[51:58] finish somebody else's fight
[52:00] we have to finish somebody else's course
[52:02] we have our own fight we have our own
[52:05] course I want to finish my course I know
[52:07] if somebody else is doing something
[52:08] greater LinkedIn what God's called them
[52:10] to do the great go for it I will cheer
[52:11] for them on their course I'm fighting my
[52:14] course I don't need to see what they're
[52:16] fighting I fight my course and that's
[52:18] what we need to be focusing on what God
[52:19] has called us to do because when you get
[52:21] when we get our sidetracked man that can
[52:24] do a number on us but focus on what God
[52:26] has called us dude I don't care it can
[52:28] be being a mom
[52:30] and you can look and think man my
[52:32] friends in high school they're doing
[52:34] this and this and this and you get these
[52:35] ideas that man I should be in
[52:37] I I should be uh I should be able to
[52:39] have a have night nice I'd like to be
[52:42] able to have nicer things I'd like to be
[52:44] able to go and have a have a job or a
[52:47] career
[52:48] and a lot of women go out and do those
[52:50] things and that's and that and that and
[52:52] that's fine in that time of singleness
[52:54] but then a lot of times these women who
[52:56] put that first
[52:57] the hit age for the men I wish I'd had a
[53:01] family
[53:02] and then then then they miss that
[53:06] and value the thing the value of the
[53:08] blessings God places in our lives our
[53:11] children and then I can remember my
[53:13] mother teaching a child rearing class
[53:16] years ago it's Family Camp it was just
[53:18] the sisters and I got to be in there
[53:19] because I was her son I was doing video
[53:21] and she's actually said the following
[53:24] I have always loved my son but I did not
[53:28] always like him
[53:35] our kids are pressing all of our buttons
[53:37] and think man I wish I could just go get
[53:40] a job
[53:41] and put these guys away I get that I get
[53:44] that but you know what
[53:47] we've pressed through these dark ages
[53:50] because they grew up and they they're in
[53:53] incredible blessings
[53:54] and we just want to keep on pressing on
[53:59] um we fight our good fight we finish our
[54:01] course we keep the faith we hold fast
[54:05] because God will never abandon us he
[54:09] says hold fast till I come because I am
[54:11] coming we're going to keep on keeping on
[54:13] and I don't care what God has called us
[54:15] to there can be times where we go
[54:16] through disappointment where it seems
[54:18] like what we've prayed for and asked for
[54:19] and expected isn't being given to us and
[54:22] that's really hard
[54:25] but we just take a step forward and
[54:27] Trust that's all that we can do there's
[54:30] really no easy answer to that we just
[54:33] take a step forward and Trust knowing
[54:34] he's there and he sees that we're
[54:37] trusting him and we're going forward
[54:39] we're being faithful to him we're being
[54:41] faithful to him and he's our spotter
[54:44] those days we feel like we can hardly
[54:45] push that weight up he will be there
[54:49] and look at it and if you get a little a
[54:52] text message God bless you I've been
[54:53] praying for you today that's not your
[54:55] friend who sent that that is God who
[54:57] sent that look at it that way because he
[55:00] is there with you he is faithful and the
[55:02] promise is
[55:03] I will give you the Morning Star
[55:07] and I can remember when I was in college
[55:09] down at Wittenberg in Springfield I
[55:12] would get up on the mornings
[55:14] I had to walk across the street and
[55:15] there was this huge Cemetery cemetery is
[55:18] a great place to walk in the morning
[55:19] it's nice and quiet and I would be going
[55:21] walking through and uh
[55:24] as I was coming back I was taking an
[55:25] astronomy class that quarter and I'd
[55:28] just been spent some time with the
[55:29] professor at the telescope and they're
[55:31] coming back one more I realized hey that
[55:33] star up there that's brighter than all
[55:34] the rest of them
[55:36] star that's a planet that's Venus that's
[55:39] the morning star and I got thinking wow
[55:41] I'm praying out here to God there's that
[55:44] morning star which is a symbol a picture
[55:45] of God and he sees me and we're and I'm
[55:48] not that I'm praying to the star but to
[55:49] me it was it was a picture that said
[55:51] something
[55:52] but this morning star in the darkness of
[55:55] early morning that's when we see Venus
[55:57] most clearly
[56:00] Venus is so bright even after the sun
[56:03] crashed The Horizon we can still see
[56:06] Venus's light it's almost like Venus is
[56:09] carrying the light of the sun behind it
[56:10] I mean it says going on and the sun
[56:12] follows right after it because the
[56:15] mornings star brings the promise that
[56:18] morning's coming
[56:20] Venus is there as it's still so dark but
[56:24] is there you can look okay there's the
[56:26] Morning Star the sun's right behind it
[56:28] morning's coming that morning star is a
[56:31] is a Herald of Hope
[56:33] and that is what this age needed it was
[56:35] a dark age and they're as faithful as
[56:38] they can and God's promise I will give
[56:40] them the Morning Star God always comes
[56:44] on the scene at the precise moment when
[56:47] we need him most the trouble is we don't
[56:49] know when that time is we always think
[56:50] it's now it's like when my son say Mom I
[56:53] need lunch now because I'm dying we
[56:56] think we're dying now we're really not
[56:57] we're really not mom mom will give you
[57:00] lunch you're not dying yet and we can
[57:02] think Lord I Need You Now
[57:04] I know I need I know you need me I will
[57:06] be there you I'm I'm spotting you I will
[57:09] I I will be there we don't know the time
[57:12] is when God will come but he is going to
[57:13] be there he we don't know the limits of
[57:16] his strength within us
[57:18] he knows that we do go through dark and
[57:21] difficult times and we're sometimes
[57:23] tempted to give up
[57:24] because we know we can't go on much
[57:26] longer
[57:27] and it seems we have to go on a lot
[57:29] longer all by ourselves
[57:32] but it's never the case he is always
[57:34] with us he will never leave us we'll
[57:36] never forsake us remember we serve a God
[57:38] who is the Morning Star he Heralds the
[57:42] coming of a new day he shines throughout
[57:45] the night it's a reminder you're not
[57:47] alone
[57:49] brother Branham says if ever a people
[57:51] needed a promise embracing the land that
[57:54] where there is no night it was the
[57:55] people of the Dark Ages and that's why
[57:58] the spirit's promising them the Morning
[58:01] Star he's telling them that the Chiefs
[58:03] are even Jesus who dwells on light into
[58:05] which no man can approach unto
[58:08] will in the future Kingdom illuminate
[58:10] them by his own personal presence he
[58:13] won't be using the Stars The Messengers
[58:15] to give light and darkness any longer it
[58:17] will be Jesus himself speaking to them
[58:19] face to face
[58:21] it's the morning star that's visible
[58:23] when the light of the sun begins to
[58:24] shine
[58:25] and when our son Jesus comes there will
[58:27] be no further in need of Messengers he
[58:29] will bring us the message himself and
[58:31] the light of the world will become
[58:32] brighter and brighter and our perfect
[58:35] day
[58:36] and like this next next quote always
[58:38] before the daylight is when it's the
[58:40] darkest It's always darkest just before
[58:43] the break of day because the lights
[58:45] pressing and condensed in the darkness
[58:47] it seems and that's the time that the
[58:49] Morning Star comes out
[58:51] but it's only the early risers that ever
[58:55] see the Morning Star
[58:58] if you want to draw Grace from God
[59:01] go to God
[59:02] because he will give you Grace
[59:05] there is a way to escape but you have to
[59:07] reach out for it and if you want to see
[59:10] God go the place where God comes
[59:13] it's the early risers who will see the
[59:15] morning star and I think in this great
[59:16] hour of Darkness just before the break
[59:18] of day The Morning Star is Shone again
[59:21] spreading forth itself the early rise
[59:23] who are rising not setting back and
[59:24] saying I'll get saved next draw get
[59:26] saved next week but those who rise and
[59:28] come out and see the Morning Star rising
[59:31] up out of the stoop and slape of this
[59:33] modern world Theology and they move into
[59:35] the powers of the Holy ghosts The
[59:37] unchangeable Riches of God spread forth
[59:39] in our hearts showing signs and wonders
[59:40] why sure we rise and give him glory
[59:43] that's what he thinks of about the great
[59:46] morning star
[59:48] I'll give him the Morning Star so
[59:50] whatever Darkness we seem to be going
[59:51] through whatever trials we seem to be
[59:53] going through
[59:54] he promises to us as well he gives us
[59:57] the Morning Star
[59:59] and
[1:00:01] the first Thessalonians 4 18 wherefore
[1:00:04] Comfort one another with these words
[1:00:08] there's encouragement and comfort but
[1:00:10] what is this these words and that's the
[1:00:13] scripture and that right below it the
[1:00:15] comfort is that we which are alive and
[1:00:17] remain shall be caught up together with
[1:00:19] them in the clouds to meet the Lord in
[1:00:21] the air and so shall we ever be with the
[1:00:23] Lord that's when that morning star comes
[1:00:26] one day and calls out to us and we meet
[1:00:30] that we We rise up and we meet and that
[1:00:33] coming is coming that going is coming he
[1:00:39] will put upon us no other burden he will
[1:00:41] help us he will give us a strength to
[1:00:43] get to that moment he will give us the
[1:00:45] Morning Star he will catch us up and
[1:00:48] there's comfort in that
[1:00:49] Comfort one another with these words the
[1:00:52] Saints and thy attire hear this message
[1:00:54] they can encompert one another encourage
[1:00:56] one another and we've got this promise
[1:00:58] there will come a day the dead in Christ
[1:01:01] will rise first and the Trump of God
[1:01:03] shall sound and we who are alive and
[1:01:05] remain will meet him in the air and
[1:01:08] that's as Satan thinks he can stamp
[1:01:10] everything out down here but he hasn't
[1:01:12] gotten us and one day he's not going to
[1:01:14] because we're going to be leaving this
[1:01:16] place and that's the message to the dark
[1:01:18] times of today
[1:01:21] and that is a that is the the message I
[1:01:24] had from thyatara tonight that except
[1:01:25] the corn of wheat fell on the ground and
[1:01:27] die
[1:01:28] it abides alone you have to
[1:01:31] there we can't get away from trials we
[1:01:34] don't like them we don't like them but
[1:01:36] that it's what brings that that outer
[1:01:39] shell of us away and that brings life to
[1:01:42] something inside of us new life causing
[1:01:44] us his life in us also
[1:01:47] spring forth
[1:01:48] let's pray
[1:01:50] heavenly father I thank you very much
[1:01:52] for your goodness and Grace To Us Lord
[1:01:54] and this this little simple message Lord
[1:01:56] talking about the trials of the Dark
[1:01:59] Ages father and also we sometimes think
[1:02:01] that we're going through Dark Ages in
[1:02:03] our life and there are certainly dark
[1:02:05] times that we go through father
[1:02:07] Lord I pray that you would encourage
[1:02:09] each one this evening father that we
[1:02:10] might be assured that you see and that
[1:02:13] you know
[1:02:15] that you see us where we're at you know
[1:02:18] the pain the anguish you know the the
[1:02:20] thoughts that we might might have and
[1:02:23] you're not uh and you're not berating us
[1:02:25] or criticizing you're looking with eyes
[1:02:26] full of compassion a Heart full of
[1:02:28] compassion you're there to spot us we're
[1:02:31] going to say Lord help I need your
[1:02:33] teacher and yes he'll put his hand
[1:02:34] underneath that weight and it'll help
[1:02:36] you lift it up building that strength
[1:02:39] within you to carry on what I pray you
[1:02:40] would encourage each one Lord and I pray
[1:02:43] Lord that as we might arise or that we
[1:02:46] might see the Morning Star whether it be
[1:02:48] the physical one outside and help us to
[1:02:50] remember your promise or whether it
[1:02:52] might just be a little encouragement a
[1:02:54] note or a small word someone gives even
[1:02:57] something their kids might say to us is
[1:02:59] yes that was a small encouragement those
[1:03:02] little words are like that morning star
[1:03:04] that's bringing in the tell me there's a
[1:03:06] sun behind me that's coming it's dark
[1:03:08] now but there's a mighty Son of God
[1:03:10] coming behind he's gonna call us one day
[1:03:13] and and take us home into this glorious
[1:03:16] time and there in that City we won't be
[1:03:19] walking the light of the church age
[1:03:20] Messengers will be walking in the light
[1:03:22] of the Son of God the lamb will be the
[1:03:24] light thereof
[1:03:26] Lord I just pray that you help us to
[1:03:28] encourage one another with that promise
[1:03:30] oh God
[1:03:33] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:03:36] well I trust we've been blessed and
[1:03:38] encouraged with some everyday wisdom and
[1:03:42] principles from the Saints and thy
[1:03:43] attire they had trials we have trials
[1:03:45] and he gives us a strength to carry on
[1:03:48] his strength
