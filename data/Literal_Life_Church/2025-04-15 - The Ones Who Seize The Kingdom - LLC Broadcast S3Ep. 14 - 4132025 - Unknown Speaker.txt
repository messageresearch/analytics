May the music and message encourage you today. Come near to me. Closer to me, Jesus. Don't let me go. No other help. I know. Jesus. Jesus. [Music] [Music] Come fight for me. You make the darkness flee, Jesus. And I know I can do anything. Has your strength in me, Jesus. [Music] So when the enemy tries to comfort me, I will not fear because you've prayed for me. I find my [Music] peace in you, Jesus. [Applause] Jesus. All of my joy in you, Jesus. Jesus. [Music] Oh, life found in you. Love being known by you, Jesus.

And I look around and everything's crazy. You are still God and that's never changing. In the midst of my fears and my indeision, you are still [Applause] [Music] my Jesus. [Music] Jesus and all of my joy in you [Music] [Applause] Jesus. Jesus. Oh Jesus. [Music] Come near to me, closer to me, Jesus. Lord, Matthew 11 and verse two. Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples and said unto him, "Art thou he that should come or do we look for another?" This is a interesting comment from John the Baptist. Uh there wasn't anybody who was stronger to identify that this was the one Messiah. This is the lamb of God. Uh he pointed all the people one day when Jesus showed up. He pointed all the people to it. So he's very strong. Besides, he has a commission from the scripture to introduce the Messiah. So, this is kind of a strange comment, but uh I like when the scripture gives our humanness as well because he's sitting there probably maybe getting a lot of questions and the time and he gets a little bit overwhelmed by some thoughts of doubt. So, he sends word ask him if he's the one. Amen. So then Jesus answered and said unto them, "Go and show John again those again those things which you do hear and see. The blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them." And then he adds this, "And blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me." So, it's it's not just seeing all the the power of God and seeing the identification. John, look at this again. The kingdom of God is certainly coming here. Here's the evidence. Go back and tell him this. But also, there's this other strange uh forgotten parable that he places here. Says, "Blessed is he who is not offended. Blessed is he who is not uh in other words, afraid of or offended at what's happening here, but they actually are going to receive it. Amen. There's going to be ones that's going to receive this. This is the kingdom of God. And and so I think that's an important point. We'll get back to that in a minute. And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, "What went you out to in the wilderness to see a reed shaken with the wind? But what went ye out to see? A man clothed in soft raignment? Behold that they that wear soft clothing are in king's houses. But what went ye out to see? A prophet? Yay, I say unto you, and more than a prophet, for this is he of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, and which shall prepare thy way before thee. I'll tell you, when we forget who we are, or forget sometimes have doubt. Jesus never forgets who we are and he pointed them back as John has a scriptural identification. That's why he's here. When we forget, God knows our position and reminds you of your position in the scripture. Verily I say unto you, among them that are born of women, there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist. Notwithstanding, he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. And from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force. I'm going to get into this that he identifies this time as a special time. And when he says the kingdom of heaven is suffering violence, that means that the kingdom of heaven has come to earth and it's suffering violent and the violent take it by force. For all the prophets in the law prophesied until John and if ye will receive this, this is Elias which was was for to come. He that hath ears, let him hear. Excuse me for the lengthy reading, but I want to read all this because I may refer to a lot of these places. But where to shall I liken this generation? It's a very mysterious set of scriptures here. It is like unto children sitting into the markets and calling unto their fellows and saying,"We have piped unto you and ye have not danced. We have mourned unto you and ye have not lamented." So these musicians are these ones sitting in the market saying, "We're if they're if they're piping unto you and expecting a dance, that's what they would do at a wedding, a certain type of music in the Jewish weddings. But the music helps enhance to draw them into the event that's happening. And when they're drawn in, the event that's happening is a wedding. And if you participate, more than likely you'll be dancing. They weren't. They were just sitting. Then a funeral, he says, "We have mourned unto you, played that kind of music, and ye have not lamented." So in other words, you're not catching the event that's going on. This is what this is saying is that there will be pe be people that look at it from the outward and don't participate in what the event actually is happening when it's happening. For John came neither drinking or eating and they say he hath the devil. The son of man cometh eating and drinking and said behold a man is gluttonous and a wine bber a friend of publicans and sinners but wisdom is justified of her children. That's a predestination scripture there. And that is God's children, his own. They will catch what's going on. They will catch what's going on. And they will not only they will not only see it, they will embrace it. They'll take it by force. They'll participate in it. Why? Because they see the kingdom has come to them. I If you don't mind, one other scripture in Matthew 13:44. One small parable. Matthew 13:44. Again, the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a treasure hid in a field, the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and sellth all that he hath, and buyth that field. The kingdom of God has come to us, and it's a treasure. You have to look at it like a treasure. You have to look at it like it's pre a precious treasure. And when you see it as a treasure, you will seek it with all your heart. You will sell out everything else. There isn't any family or money or retirement or anything in this life that becomes more important than seeking this treasure. That you won't seek it that way unless you see it as God's kingdom and his treasure. When a man catches this is this is uh below the surface of this thing, it's the kingdom of God that's come to us. And when you see that, you see it as a great treasure. Can you say amen? And it becomes the most important thing. When a believer sees that beneath the surface, it's not just another field, but this field has the kingdom of God hidden in it. He aggressively pursues that field. He sells everything and buys that field. Why? It's the kingdom of God. And that's the greatest treasure of any. When people see the message for what it really is, and that's what I brought up last Sunday is that I wonder how many people don't see this message as the kingdom of God coming to us. How many people didn't see what Jesus really was when he was standing in front of them? They they were blinded by it. Could it be? Could it be their doubts of it? And remember, even John had some doubts himself. So, uh, Brother Bam said his eagle eyes got filmed over there for a few days. So doubts are hanging around everywhere. And if you stay in those doubts, they will convince you there's nothing to this. Can you say amen? Even John himself. But see, Jesus had more confidence in John in his position that he would come around because he wasn't called to let his doubts let him leave this message and put it as another pebble on another pebble on the beach. No, he knew that he was an elected seed of God and that he had already identified it and he will identify it again. That confidence is in the predestinated to see to say this is not just a surface movement. He even looked past the miracles and signs and wonders to see this is his kingdom coming to us. That's what I'm presenting is that how many people just still see it on a surface level, but when you see it as his kingdom, it becomes greater than everything in your life. I quoted Tony Evans last week and I just wanted to finish what he said. He said, "A treasure is worth fighting for. A priceless treasure like this one, it's worth fighting for. And men will settle for trinkets and gadgets and golf clubs and video games and careers and cars and vacation packages. And these things are okay. All okay unless they take you off course from pursuing the kingdom." Well said. Can you say amen? And he's directing it towards men. Men are chasing all these things. And men have that ambition. They chase after a goal. I want to make more money. I want to do this. I want to build my retirement. And there's nothing wrong with that ambition. But when it trumps when it trumps the kingdom and you've laid the kingdom aside, something's wrong with that. This has to become the most precious thing in life. And when it is, it'll have priority in your life. This message will have prov priority. Let me be basic. You'll be listening to it. You'll be reading it. You'll be in your Bible because why? Something's hidden in here that you've got to find. And you got to pursue it with all of your heart. I I would pursue it as strong as you pursue money and career and golf clubs and cars and trucks. I can't preach against trucks because I got a truck. I love my truck. But it's never as important as the kingdom. Amen. And if you brothers would uh pursue aggressively the kingdom of God, being in it, being reading it, mining out all the truths of it, don't tell me that you're mainly interested in the kingdom when you won't even go find God's answers when it comes to your finances. You've had enough preachers tell you that the answers to how to run your money is in the Bible. Money is spoken of probably more than any other subject. Money is spoken of. He's got his principles of how son of God handles money. Don't tell me you're interested in the kingdom and you won't even dig to find what he said about it. Don't tell me you want a good marriage and you're not interested in finding in the Bible the kingdom principles of marriage. Can I get an amen? Don't tell me you want things to better be better in your home. And you won't even get into the message or in into the word to find what God said about the home. But when we're interested that this is his kingdom, we're going to pursue it with all of our hearts. And so that's the things men choose. Tony Evans said it. Uh, should I list the women and what they pursue? Well, it's all quiet now. Oh, yeah. They've got their ambitions and their things and competing to be prettier than the next woman. Everything else is more important. Wow, that was quite I stay off of that subject. But listen, the kingdom of God that has come to us must be the goal. And we must sell out to everything to take a hold of it. Can you say amen? We But we won't react that way unless we see it there and we see it as the greatest treasure in life. We won't be serious about church or the message unless we see it as more than that, more than just something that surfaced. We see it. And when we see it, we seize it. That's why I'd like to title this this morning. The ones who seize the kingdom. Actually, he said, "And the violent take it by force." When they know the kingdom is there, they're taking it by force. In a minute, I'll tell you why you have to take it by force. It's not just nonchalantly, okay, it's here. The kingdom is here. Praise the Lord. I'll praise the Lord. The kingdom is here. But we have to take the kingdom by force. We have to be aggressive and take it into our lives. We don't passively just say, "Hope it comes to me." We have to aggressively take a hold of it. And when we know it's a treasure, we will do that. I believe that with all my heart. the saints shall possess the kingdom. And that's why I say there's a difference in receiving it and nodding at it and believing the message. I'm taking it for myself. I'm taking it as my own. I'm possessing it into my life. Can you say amen? Taking it and possessing it, they're actually different. Taking means receiving. Possessing means taking possession. It means to claim it as your own property. Like the man who bought that piece of land, sold everything in. I'm buying that piece of land. Why do you want it? Because you can't see it. There's a treasure. There's a hidden treasure. And so I'm selling out to the rest of it. And I'm buying that piece of land. I want ownership in that land. It's a possession of it. I want to own it. Can you say amen? Glory be to God. So now possessing means take it. To claim it as one's own property, to own it as equality, to obtain power over, to dominate. It's personalized. It's possessing is saying this is mine. This is me. It's a domain that I have co-ownership with and I am exercising. I am exercising that ownership and I'm taking it. The first part is receiving it and then taking it. But you see now the the next part is possessing this kingdom. Taking this kingdom. Can you say amen? This is a setting up of his kingdom on earth on earth. And I am identified with it. I believe it. I receive it. It's from God. He sent Elijah and I receive Elijah. It's the kingdom of his word being set up. and I receive it as just as that the work of God is to believe and receive the servants he sends. Jesus said it Pharisees said, "What do we do to do the works of God?" Jesus said, "This is the work of God that you believe on whom God sends." Receiving it. It's mine. We believe it. We not only believe it, but we take possession of it. We go to this step now that would hit home. Receiving as the kingdom does not mean you have receiving doesn't mean you've possessed it yet. I pray in my congregation it wouldn't be just people that receive this as a kingdom but they possess it. I'm taking it as my own. I'll go to the altar. I'll do what I have to do. I'm going to surrender my life because it's not just church. This is his kingdom. And I'm possessing. I'm going to take a home. If somebody left you a million dollars and you heard you got a left a million dollars, you can call and accept it over the phone. You can believe it's yours. Your name is on it, but you did not go get it yet. Can you say amen? Calling and saying, "I accept my prize. I accept my million dollars." No, but you haven't possessed it yet. I don't want to just call and accept this message and accept this is the kingdom of God. I know I have a part in it and I'm going to go down and collect what's mine. The rights that are mine. I'm going to take it and possess. I want to see that million dollars coming up in my account. Then I've really possessed it. Can you say amen this morning? I don't want to just stand and nod and sit and nod in church and say, "I believe what you're preaching, Brother Paul. I'm preaching it so you'll possess it and take a hold of it yourself. I want to see it in your account." Then you've really possessed it. the rights. You have a right to it. Can you say amen? Somebody gave you a house. You can even hold the deed of it with your name on it, but you don't live in it yet. You don't possess it yet. Possessing is deeper. Esther, there's a mystery under Esther when she becomes moved in your heart to move forward towards the king. That's the bride. Can you say amen? He draws us. But she felt the confidence to come into the courts of the king and to get his attention. The king loved her, but she had to come towards the king. She had to move into his courts. Can you say amen? And she did it by revelation that I'm his I believe I'm his queen and he is my king. And she moves in confidence towards him. Praise the Lord. If you got your Bibles still open to Matthew 11 or if you can pull it up there, I want to just uh comment just a few things here on Matthew 11. Again, these little eagle eyes got filmed over, but Jesus had no doubt about him. It was crystal clear. Jesus not did not waver with John even in his moments of doubt. Aren't you glad God doesn't waver with you even in your moments of doubt? Amen. John the Baptist, the one who was initiating the kingdom of God coming and before the first coming of Christ before before the first advent of Christ, he sends John the Baptist with the spirit of Elijah to introduce that. Pretty important position and he comes and does that. And even that strong word clarification, it was crystal clear. Behold the lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world. Jesus didn't waver with John even in John's moments of doubt. And he says, "Go tell John all you see evidence that something is happening beyond man. The kingdom of God is here." The the the lame leap, the the blind see. Just look. I don't need to explain myself. The evidences show, hey, the kingdom of God is here. But guess what? Not everybody, even through those miracles, is going to acknowledge and take a hold of this. There'll be a host even in Jesus day that they can see it all, but they're not going to take a hold of it. Jesus said, "Look all the look at what's happening." And for those miracles, the blind to see, the lame to walk, ears opened, for all of those things to be happening, the kingdom has come. And you know what's happening? Something has come shaking up demon power. That's right. Because when you have blinded eyes, when you have lame, it's demons. Yes. And they've so taken over. Satan loves to take God's people and just make them sick and make them then there's no hope. I'm going to be this way the rest of my life. Even blind the Barnameus from birth. I'm cursed with this the rest of my life. I don't know why it's happened. I'll be blind forever. Guess what? When the kingdom came, it wasn't forever. Amen. When the kingdom's around, you're not doomed to life. Oh, can I preach this morning and say if the kingdom of Christ is around even this morning, you're not doomed to any condition that the doctor said that you got, including depression, including oppression, it's just demon doubts and demon fears. I don't mean to call you a demon. I understand when somebody has depression, but don't ever accept it as being final. Cuz when the kingdom is present, when it came the first time, it it it it shook up those demons. It says your days are numbered. This depression's going to be over. This blindness is going to be over. If we go to verse 12, Matthew 11:12, and remember that little comment that he makes after those miracles, he says, he says, uh, "Blessed is he who's not offended in me." I want you to hold that because what he's saying is that there will be a group that will be offended and will stumble when his kingdom comes because Satan will put stumbling blocks. But then he says, "Blessed is the person who overcomes those stumbling blocks." They overcome those that offense. Somebody's going to get offended means they're going to stumble over something. But blessed is he who gets over. They see all the miracles and everything. But but you see now the devil's work is not only blindness and sicknesses and all that, but you know what a greater work of the enemy is today? People being stumbled, people being offended. And their offense and their stumbling causes them not to embrace the kingdom. Come on now, say amen. So what's Jesus saying? The the enemy has made these people sick. But also the en enemy is the author of stumbling people that they can't receive this as his kingdom and they can't embrace it. So he's talking about a group that will stumble over that. Blessed is he who's not offended in me. That they're going to overcome that stumbling stone and they're going to say, "No, I see this for what it is." So now if we come now to verse 12, I've got to get moving on here. And the and from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven suffered violent and the violent take it by force. So he's talking about a transition that's happened. He's he's saying the kingdom has come. There's a change here. And when John began to preach out in the wilderness and he what was he preaching? Repent for the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent for the kingdom of God. He's saying it in front of the people. We're right here. Guess what's coming? The kingdom is coming. How do I need to How do you need to get in there? Repent. But that's a big proclamation. And Jesus is saying it from the day. But look at Jesus now. Greater insight, greater revelation. Since the day that John first started preaching and that voice started to go out into the earth, it be that the the kingdom of heaven is suffering violence. There's going to be an allout attack from the enemy realm against that kingdom. It's going to shake up the other dimension. Everything was normal before everything people Satan had people bound and it had become so normal. They had just accepted it for life and Satan was ruling over all kinds of people's lives in all kinds of area. But when the kingdom came, Satan could tell it's be to shake his kingdom up. Jesus sent the 70 and said, "Go casting out devils." And Jesus after they come back, they were rejoicing. The devils were subject. And Jesus said, "I beheld as Satan falling like lightning from heaven." You know what he's saying? When you when the believers went and prayed and cast out devils, it's shaking up all the kingdom of the demons. And he said, "I beheld Satan falling like lightning." He looked into the other dimension. And when believers have faith and pray, demon powers are shaken up. for watching our service today.
