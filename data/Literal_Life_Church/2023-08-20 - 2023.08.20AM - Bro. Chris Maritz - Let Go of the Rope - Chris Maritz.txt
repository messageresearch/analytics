TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I always just want to greet you in the lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ it truly is a privilege to be here with you today and just been so enjoying the atmosphere of this congregation and been enjoying our brother Paul and sister Rebecca just been really blessed just as a young Pastor to be able to glean from our brother Paul and be encouraged by by his leadership and his example and so we've just been really blessed to be in your midst and trust this morning that the Lord will bless us in his presence here and just ask that he would look beyond the the frail Veil that is standing here today amen God can speak if we have faith in him and we approach him with that attitude amen coming with an expecting Heart To A man that God will speak and it's I think it's so profound the song that our brother Paul was singing this morning let go and let God have his way because the more this morning the sermon title is let go of the Rope we're going to just look at this a little bit today and I trust it'll encourage you the sermon today is is going to be a real challenge when I preached this at home it challenged me it shook me to my very core because we want we don't want just sermons we want something that that refines us that draws us closer to the Lord that we want the real thing we don't want just you know to be happy and joyful and surface level religion we want the real deal we want the the power of God to be manifest in our lives we want to know him in his in the realities of God Amen I don't want to just live a mediocre life I want to I want to live a life walking with the Lord knowing him and understanding him and and having the power to overcome the challenges that we Face amen so this morning will be a real challenge to us so it asks we just be really attentive I'm going to go through a lot of scriptures and a lot of quotes because I want to give you a real solid background for the angle that we're going to be bringing the sermon from today and then that way you'll have all the quotes and the scriptures you can go read later amen so we're just going to give the service to the Lord just now if you have a need today I'd ask you would just bow with me and we're just going to present our needs we're going to present our desires and his word to him now that he would come and he would break bread with us amen our precious Heavenly Father Lord we come to you in this awesome presence Lord that we know so well Lord and it bring such a calm and arrest to us Lord when we come into your presence knowing that you know us better than we know ourselves Lord that you know your word Lord you know the the intent wherewith you had it written with Lord you had you had a desired effect that you would like to see it have in our lives and today we want to just lay before you we open our hearts to you our minds to you Lord that your word would have its desired effect Lord that it would bring forth fruit that is pleasing to you we ask for for understanding we ask for for power we ask for your grace this morning Lord wash us and By the Waters of your word today and draw us closer to you and make us stronger Lord so that we can face the challenges that we face as we know God that the devil is out there and he's he knows his time is short he knows that he's just got a few days months if it even be that Lord and so he is roaring like a lion but Lord you raise the spirit up within us and so this morning we want to look to those things and be encouraged in your word that you would strengthen us and gird us up father in your word we love you we appreciate you Lord and we present our needs to you this morning and just asking you would have your Divine will and way with us this morning in Jesus Christ's name amen amen we're going to turn in our Bibles to the book of Deuteronomy 7. Deuteronomy 7 verse 7. I've been preaching this uh series at home called The Covenant of Grace how that God when he makes a covenant with his people he's the one that brings that Covenant to pass you know we it's not a whole lot we can do we see how many times Israel failed and and fell and made mistakes and things so God is the one that keeps the Covenant and I'm so thankful for that that we are also under a Covenant of Grace it's nothing we did but what God did for us and so God made a promise to you and I God made a covenant between you and I and he's the keeper of that Covenant and he and he and and so we understand that the Covenant that God makes is a Covenant of Grace between you and I and so we're going to lay a little bit of a foundation here this morning before we get into letting go of the Rope what does this mean this Covenant that we're under the promise God has made to you and I and then we're going to look at letting go of the road Deuteronomy 7 and 7 says that the Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any people for you were the fewest of all people so he's going to describe to us now why he has set his love upon you right did you want to know this morning why does he set his affections your way why does God love me why does God take care of me why is this Covenant a Covenant of Grace he says but because the Lord loved you so not because of your numbers not because of your great Cathedrals and churches and because of your efforts this is not why he he loves you he loves you because he chose to love you because the Lord loved you and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers which the Lord brought you out of with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bond men from the hand of pharaoh King Egypt he says no therefore that the Lord thy God he is God the faithful God which keepeth Covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his Commandments to a thousand Generations I think that covers us today God is the keeper of his Covenant and it's a covenant of Mercy Hallelujah amen you may have receipts this morning because the Lord loved you he would keep the oath he's The Keeper of the Covenant he's the one that guards it he's the one that ensures that he's the one that guarantees it amen and we we sit under a covenant we sit under a promise this morning of mercy and Grace because of his love towards you see it's not because of our efforts towards him it's because he first chose to love us Prophet says in in the message the message message of Grace amen that's a good message to go to go and listen to and anybody that's willing to repent the grace of God still goes for you the grace of God is searching for you so that goes for your backsliders this morning the grace of God is still looking for you if you'll just repent God's grace is sufficient no he's not looking at your Deeds he's not looking at your behavior he's not looking at what you can bring to the table he's looking at what he has done for you his grace is sufficient it doesn't matter how far you may have slipped it doesn't matter if you have backslid in my brown sister if you turned to him this morning his grace is sufficient because the Covenant that he made for you he shed with his own blood amen and it covers all your sins it washes you makes you white as snow and the prophet told us that all he sees is his blood covering you so you have a right to approach him this morning and say Lord I need that Covenant this morning I need to come under the banner of your grace and love this morning you have a right to do that because his Governor his Covenant is enforced by grace Hallelujah he says he took good old Abraham and he brought him back and remember Abraham was not saved by his Works he was saved by grace Abraham was saved by faith which it was Grace and God saved Abraham because of his grace not because of his behavior he saved him because of his grace oh how good he was saved by grace we know the the times that Abraham would even lie any any and and the little mistakes he would make and the little bit of unfaith maybe he would he would show you know and these little things but God wasn't looking at that go read the book of Hebrews 11 and you'll find that the only thing that was recorded is the faith that Abraham had and how he staggered not at the promises of God hallelujah that's God's Covenant of Grace this is God's attitude towards you this is what he sees when he looks at you this morning he said I will bring you to a good land I will take care of you I will feed you I will lead you it's all on him this morning and we can go and rest in God because of the Covenant he made God making a covenant that he will enforce by Grace because he knew we would make mistakes he knew we would make a big mess out of it all amen it's going to take Grace because we make mistakes and we mess things up just look at Israel for an example this morning yesterday we we covered this quote talking to the couples and uh just just looking at what it takes to keep a family together and it takes the same thing to keep a church together and to keep a relationship together and and our and our relationship with the Lord it takes Grace to keep the family just in the yellow there it says but then think what if that woman would turn wrong and lives lazy and won't work and won't do nothing then it takes Grace to keep that family together see we're so quick to judge you know and I feel like sometimes in the message we feel like because we know everything and because we we act like we know everything anyway you know then what happens is we tend to judge so quickly somebody doesn't have just the right length skirt on or or acts a certain way we're so quick to isolate and categorize not not remembering that you were saved by the same Grace that is saving that person and all God sees is his love for that individual don't overstep the love of God and the Covenant he has made with another person remember how brother Brandon was judging that little that couple there in the in their Cafe and and the policeman and that woman that was there and he judged them and then God said but have you not noticed the grace wherewith I loved you with right it's the same Grace that was given to that couple how dare you how dare you judge somebody else if you are a Christian my brother says that's why I say we're going to be challenged this morning we if we call ourselves Christians how dare we judge how dare we hold grudges how dare we do those things to one another we are message Believers what does that mean to be a message believer huh we can be so dogmatic we can be so you know full of our our intellectual uh you know quotes and and things but do we really understand what it means to be called a message believer this whole thing is a love relationship between a husband and and his bride this whole thing is because of love it's because of Grace this whole thing is God showing to you that I've chosen you because of my love towards you so us as message Believers that is our message to The World God loves you and he and he died for your sins and that you can also be part of this wonderful Grace Covenant that's our message to the world God fed them and took care of them why because he looks after his Covenant I'm so thankful for that this morning it says so regardless of what the church is sorry it takes Grace for Jehovah to keep his family together and then it says so regardless of what the church is how wrong you've been what difference does that make it's how right you can be now oh my this morning let's just let's just reset huh let's just reset everything all the mistakes we've made we can bring it to the altar this morning and he said you can cast your cares upon Him you can lay your burdens down at the altar this morning and he can just say it's over I'm done with those things I want to do right from now on God's Grace has showed it to you then walk in it it's God's grace see he does both things he is the one that loved you and he is the one that chooses you he loved you and he chose you not because you were more in number not because you are something you know extraordinary firm another church or because you know we we do things a certain way it's because he loved you and he chose you praise the Lord not because of anything we did we so quickly categorize you know and and fixate little schemes and plans and and we caused divisions amongst churches and families all because we have this little idea or this little Doctrine or this little we're going to be so careful with that my brother and sister that is not what this message has come to do that's not right it's not appropriate when we consider the Covenant of Grace wherewith he has come with to us with Ephesians 1 4 says according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love we wouldn't want to overstep that God chose us it was God's election it's God's choosing the Covenant would reveal something about God it reveals something about his heart and his attitude towards his people it's God's choice the next time you want to judge somebody just remember God chose them the same way he chose you and he loved them before they gave her made that mistake before they ever had that little thing God loved them well just look at Jacob if you don't believe me this morning remember he said that Jacob have I loved and he saw have I hated God chose before they were even born that he would love Jacob why because God had a plan God had a purpose for Jacob and he knew that Jacob would mess up he knew that he would be a little shyster but he made him a certain way why because he knew he would have a heart he would have a love for the birthright and he had a plan for Jacob's life that he would one day become Israel and he would become a prince with God he wasn't looking at all the mistakes he would make he was he he chose him because he loved him and he had a plan for his life we would so quickly want to judge Jacob and want to criticize him for all of his failures and mistakes and how he cheated his brother out of his Birthright my brother and sister God did not see it that way um that love was there before Jacob could do anything wrong before Jacob had a choice God chose him and it's not like God didn't know what Jacob would do but the key is that Jake God loved Jacob God chose to love Jacob Prophet says so God told him he said now he's in your hands but don't you take his life talking about job and Satan even stretched as far as he could on that he took every friend and everything he had almost his complete life but he couldn't take his life but job still held right on there was no turning back he says you see when a man or a person has once really come in contact with god with that genuine revealed faith that God is there's nothing there's no time nowhere can ever separate that man from his God I believe it was Paul said there's no Strife no anger no perils nor neither living creatures or death or anything that can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus is that true this morning is there anything that can separate us from the love of God that's anything by the way nothing can separate you from the love of God oh brother Chris I just don't know I don't feel right it doesn't feel good or I have this complex or this insecurity nothing can separate you from the love of God he chose to love you before you even had a choice and he has a reason he has a purpose in loving you because he has a covenant that he wants to keep between you and him oh my he was ordained to that life brother he says but Satan thought he could twist him around a little bit and cuff him up and make him do it but you see job with his perfect revelation of God and who God was and how God loved him he waited no matter what the circumstances was he waited for his faith to be confirmed because he had a grip on God a revelation that I spoke of last night so what is this love that we're talking about love is powerful you know where's the message you know this group we call ourselves the message Believers right we're under this Capstone Ministry we've reached the the very elite of all the church ages and all the the most powerful things and the strongest anointings and Eagle age and all these wonderful things and yet the whole thing is capped by his love see the power that we have is to love one another so what is this love we're talking about this morning he says hatred stirth up Strife but love covereth all sins This Love that covers old sins it doesn't just talk about your own sin see when we read that we immediately go Oh all my sins are covered that's wonderful praise the lord it's not just talking about you all right that's wonderful and we praise God for that that this Covenant of Grace is for you and he died for your sins and he covered you with his blood amen and he set you free and made you a new and a new living creature in Christ Jesus but that is not just for you this love covering all senses not for you only this is so that you can cover also the sins of others because you can choose to hate and you can choose to love you can choose to criticize you can choose to be different you can choose all those things but choose love because it covers a multitude of sins love will spread its mantle over the sins of his fellow Christians and it forgives them even all of them instead of exposing them it hides and conceals their errors and instead of loading and aggravating the infirmities of others it puts the best constructions in other words you build them up you you like a framer would build a house he he makes sure the right nails are used and the in the the structural strength is going to be there you build the best constructions around your fellow Christian why because you love them you have the love of God in your heart you put the best things forward in front of them you you you show them hope and you bear with them and you believe all things for their sake first Peter 4 7 says about the end of all things is at hand be therefore sober and watch unto prayer and above all things have fervent charity love among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sins I don't think he just wrote this just so that you know we can read over there's power here that we have today this very morning in 2023 there's power if you have the Holy Ghost my brother and sister you have power to forgive you have power to build up and to and to create an atmosphere of love and peace and rest why would we want to aggravate somebody why would we want to point out their weak spots or why would we want to you know belittle somebody or or judge or criticize someone why not rather build them up and lift them up and see if he cannot save that soul you were saved the same way God chose to love you when he knew the mistakes you and I would make he chose to love my goodness you see in the sight of men both those whose sins are against and who they have been committed against he says this is true love true love thinks no ill of one another this is the ministry we're under praise the Lord I said it was going to challenge us today but puts the best constructions upon the words and actions of your fellow Christians does not take them up and improve and exaggerate things but lets them lie buried in Oblivion it takes no notice of injuries so we as individuals we're so easily offended that brother didn't look at me right or he didn't sing just in the right note or or it was a little too loud or it was a little too quiet or or maybe they didn't invite me over to a party it says that love does not take offense well the Lord help me give me strength this morning it takes no notice of injuries or a fronts but overlooks them and bears with them gives them the benefit of the doubt because we choose to love it bears with them and it forgives them so that they never are raked up again or seen any more which prevents strife and trouble if there's trouble and if there's strives my brothers and sisters because we're not letting go of things we as Christians have no right to hold grudges or criticize we just don't have that right and you might say how that's not fair brother Chris I've been really hurt you know I went through a situation in my life and I'm not saying that that your hurts are irrelevant and that it didn't happen that's what I'm saying what I'm saying is you don't have to live with those things there's a power here called the love of God that can set us free from hurts from pains and all those things and we have to choose that this morning choose to forgive and say Lord I might not be stronger strong enough to forgive I might not be strong enough to let go but you are strong enough he says I love you don't forget the Commandments of God to you little children love one another love everybody right or wrong sinner or Saint love them anyhow if you don't then pray God to help you because God loved the sinner and the nature of God is in you oh if the man is wrong love him anyhow see we want to justify our actions we want to sometimes you're right sometimes you are right and then you feel Justified but why why would we do that choose to love the person and lift them up rescue them choose to love him anyhow don't partake of his sins don't partake of his sins but in sweetness not in sourness and rebuke right have you ever seen you you tell a child oh go say sorry to your sibling I'm sorry right no in sweetness right not in sourness and rebuke and sweetness tell him of the hope of life that rests with within you through Jesus Christ being revealed to you by the Holy Ghost Romans 5 5 says and hope maketh not a shame because of the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us in other words it is it never disappoints this hope that we have it's not ashamed you'll never be disappointed in in acting this way you'll never be disappointed in choosing to love and and allowing the Holy Ghost of God to shed this love of God in your heart you will not be disappointed and it will not dilute anything it will also not bring you to shame for God's love has been poured out into our hearts that's what the scripture is saying and in verse 6 then it says 4 when we were yet without Strength In Due Time Christ died for the ungodly when we were weak when we were Sinners unsaved when we were alienated from God God did what we could not do he bridged the Gap he stood in the gap for us because he chose to love us even while we were weak which is to be powerless to help ourselves so at the fitting time God stepped on the scene because of his Covenant what about us and one another for scarcely for a righteous man one will one die yet per adventure for a good man some would even dare to die but God commandeth commandeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us God is showing us clearly and proving the kind of love that he loves us with lay his life down before we even had a choice before we even had to say anything he laid his life down for you and I what should we be prepared to do for one another um father forgive them he said for they know not but they do just think he says if if gifts is so great what we call power and Paul said though I have faith that could move a mountain and have not charity I am nothing think of that and though we say well I understand I wish I know the Bible he says though I understand all the mysteries of God oh my see and still though I could do it and not and have not charity I am not a little I am nothing we can know all the quotes we can know all the scriptures I'm not belittling those things we should study the word of God and we should know those things so don't misunderstand me but my brother and sister if that's all you've got and you do not have the love of God in your heart it's worth absolutely zero and all we find it doing is causing divisions and strife and and it agitates and aggravates people that's not what we're after that's not what the message came to do in our lives just want to be very clear about that unless we have this charity I am nothing see I haven't got nowhere yet see the main thing is the main thing is love God and humble yourself with it he says now surely after all these years on the field and around the world and seeing different people I ought to know a little bit a little bit about the gate to enter in at and if you want to get somewhere with God never let an arrogant Spirit ever come around you don't let No Malice come in no matter what anybody does if they are wrong don't you never build up a complex against that person see you be sweet and kind remember God loved you when you were in sin and if the spirit of God is in you you love the other person when he is wrong see just pray for them and love one another my brother and sister I'm not I'm not just I don't want this to be cheap this morning I know what it means to be hurt I know what it means to be betrayed or or evil spoken of or falsely accused and all those things I get it I understand those things but it's so much better to just let it go and just say Lord give me strength to love give me strength to forgive oh God because I don't want to live like this I don't want to live in this misery with under the shadow of this cloud of misery and and and and self-loathing and and trying to find a little bit of happiness here a little bit of happiness just to let it go it's not worth it my brother and sister God will take care of all those things and you will come to understand all those things are working together for your good um above everything love God and love one another and be humble with God and around one another and God will bless us and it's hard telling what he will do usually when a church begins to get in numbers and get get to getting a little bigger or something like that they then they get away from the real thing the real thing do you know what brought these things to pass look at the message we've come how many years since the the message began the the the sounding of that eagle scream you know and and the and what God was going to do in this age how many years have we come come gone along now what has it become I want to say we have gotten to know the love of God we've become stronger in forgiveness we've become more willing to let go is what I'd like to say but look at what he says he's talking about the real thing and he's talking about the beginnings of the message when he was commissioned to bring a message to you and I do you know what brought these things to pass what started this whole thing when I first started and the Lord appeared to me down on the river and told me that that he was commissioned to bring a message to prepare the way of the Lord and brother Vale saw that and I believe in a paper in Canada many years ago where the angel of the Lord appeared on the river down there it was on Associated pessimistic light over a local Minister while baptizing you know what did that what brought that about what caused God to raise up a Ministry and have an angel come and meet him and declare before witnesses that this is the message this is this is my chosen vessel for a message to prepare the way of the Lord as John did right to bring the word for this generation I mean that's a pretty that's a that's an incredible event but what caused that event to come into fruition or to come into manifestation it says when we had the tent meeting just across the street a tent that seated about old 2500 people ministers come from everywhere and said brother come here a minute oh I was just a boy like just a kid and he said oh how deep do those P how do you keep those people in one Accord they love one another until I haven't seen people love one another whoa wait that's how this started that's the Lord that's what this church was established upon that Godly brotherly love one for another I've seen them even shake hands with one another leaving the place and cry like babies to leave one another they love one another that well and I could go to their house to visit them then times the Bible was laying open and stained with tears and he says come in at a night time where fathers and mothers was gathered together and their little children around on the floor kneeling around them fathers and mothers on their knees crying and praying and I'd stand at the door and wait and wait and wait and they didn't stop praying I'll just sit down on the steps and start praying myself waiting for them you see that that that was they loved one another they loved one another that's where this all started Galatians 5 14. here's a few scriptures just to jot down for yourself for all the law is fulfilled in one word even this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself but the fruit of the spirit is love make no mistake about that the fruit of the spirit the holy ghost that we have the manifestation of that Holy Spirit In Our Lives is love sometimes we look for great demonstrations and great healings and those things are all part of the promise that God has given to you and I but what is the fruits of the spirit it's love amen peace long-suffering gentleness goodness Faith Ephesians 2 4 but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together in Christ by Grace you are saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in Doctrine in love in love my brother says don't forget how you came to the message how God saved you it's because you found out that he loves you and he was willing to forgive you and you fell in love with God and he poured out his mercy and his grace upon you and he and he has kept you on this journey he has poured out Revelations upon Revelation he has given you a pastor he's given you families he's giving you blessings he's healed you he's done all these things why because of a Covenant of Grace don't forget what this is all about we have been rooted and grounded in love we are the bride of Christ are we not there's a relationship start based on love and raise us up together sit in Heavenly places grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of God forbearing one another in love Ephesians 4 2 would tell us I didn't have that slide up there but the next one here Will Tell Us in First John 3 11 for this is the message I love that that ye heard from the beginning that we should love one another what is the message my brother and sister that we should love one another amen if we truly love one another as God love one another as God loved us huh wouldn't we live a very different kind of a life when we treat one another very differently this is the message that we heard from the beginning that you love one another not as Cain who was of the wicked one and slew his brother and wherefore slew he him because his own Works were evil and his brothers righteous Marvel not my brethren if the world hates you so don't be surprised if you're hated it doesn't mean we get to hate back it doesn't mean we get to have complexes and indifferences and build up walls no we are stronger than these things we are much stronger greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world my brother and sister friends at school might disregard you or push you aside or bully you it doesn't mean we get to treat them that way you need to know that they need the love of God they need the power of God it will break every chain don't be afraid of those things don't be afraid to love someone there's more power in love than there is in hate he says Marvel not my brother if the world Haiti we know that we have passed from Death unto life because we love the Brethren he that loveth not his brother abideth in death that's a sobering scripture sobering oh I believe the message well let's just go look what the Bible says I know it shook me to my very core do I really understand what this message has come to do for me verse 15. whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer and ye know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him ouch hereby perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the Brethren Lord give me strength huh beloved let us love one another the Bible says for love is of God and everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love in this was manifested the love of God towards us because that God sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him here in his love not that we love God but that he loved us and sent his son to be the perpetuation of our sins beloved if God so loved us we ought also to love one another no man has seen God at any time if we love one another God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in US there's another one are you going to find a lot of scriptures when you start looking for the power of love and the ministry we're under the anointing that's in the bride the spirit of God love is going to be at every turn amen praise though I'm happy for that because if God said so my brother and sister then it's available to us today first John 4 and 17 hearing is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment in he that feareth is not made in perfect love this is why love is so important in a Christian walk because when you get into a place where you're critical or you cannot forgive somebody it starts to generate a fear you don't want to be around certain people it starts to generate a certain insecurity and you're afraid to visit other churches or you're afraid to to talk to other people from other churches or other family members because you're afraid it's as insecurity it's a complex that sets in but love knows no fear there's no fear in love love is liberating it sets you free so we love him because he first loved us and if a man say I love God and heideth his brother he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he has seen how can he love God whom he hath not seen and this commandment have we from him that he who loveth God loves his brother also thank you Lord Lord help me and give me strength oh God huh I'm nothing Lord I am nothing without you I cannot even take the next step I cannot I don't even want to take the next thought without your power without your Holy Spirit he says don't hold nothing against anybody or anybody's Church let's go together as one like brother and sister and then the sinner on the outside will know what that we really love Jesus right we think it's all about Doctrine and Mysteries those things are good because they they are the revealed word for our day I'm not downplaying those things but at the end of the day the center on the outside is looking in and they're going wow those people cannot even get along and this is the truth for our day now I'm just I just want to get real down to real business you know this might be the last time I ever preacher my brother and sister but the important thing is is that we take inventory of what we are presenting to the world because if we have the truth and it should give us power to walk one with one another and not have inferiority complexes on the outside we really love Jesus Jesus said this this will this will all men know that you are my disciples because you have Shake one another's hands because you belong to this church because you have love one for another is that right he says the love one for another then you will know all men will know that you are my disciples and if we do not have love one for another then we cannot be his disciples and that's what's holding the Sinners back that's scary I don't want to stand there on Judgment Day and there's a sinner on the outside saying well I just I didn't want to come into the church I didn't want to go and find out what it was all about because there was so much strife and fussing and hatred I don't want to stand there on that day my brother and sister an answer for having a critical spirit and it kept a soul from being saved and you will be that reason why that Soul wasn't safe because we have the option to show love instead you've been given the right the privilege the power to show love excuse me to show love questions and answers he says this he says but here's the fruits of the spirit love joy peace long-suffering goodness gentleness patience that's the fruit of the spirit and if those signs follow you then I kind of believe what Jesus told me to look for he said this will all men know that you're my disciples when you have congregations said love one for another that's right when you have loved one for another although the man might different with you yet you love him just the same see praise the Lord yes Lord thank you oh if you just love those who love you what reward have you Sinners do the same thing see oh see why it's a Capstone of love it's our challenge my brother and sister it's a challenge that we face is to love and it would be easy to love someone who loves you that's not the challenge of our day you will be hated persecuted spoken evil on falsely accused you will be isolated made fun of and yet we will love back it says if a man really hates you and he proved he hates you and still in your heart you love him you're getting pretty close to the kingdom he proved he came and said to your face I hate you you offend me I dislike you and you can love him that's a real challenge they falsely accuse you behind your back and through the gossip Circle you hear back that they said something about you it's not even true and so quickly we want to justify or clear that up and we get busy and then we want to rebuttal that and we want to meet with everybody if you know how much easier it is to just say Lord I forgive them they don't even know what they're doing they don't even know what they're saying Lord there must be something there in their heart I asked Lord you would just remove that from their heart but Lord I'm so thankful for your love and the and the grace wherewith you love me with help me to love this one the same way isn't that so much easier just let it go because what's going to happen is the devil wants you to try and justify yourself he wants to have a meeting with you right so now you got to justify your actions it's all a lie anyway but now you got to justify a lie or or disprove a lie and you're going to get into this conversation getting get into a heated debate just say I forgive you it's so much easier it's not worth it we don't have a reputation right as a Christian we are dead in Christ it's only his reputation that's at stake we don't have a reputation to upkeep we don't have a reputation to prove we have nothing to prove my brother sister don't forget we are dead in Christ we have no opinion we have no rights we don't need to justify ourselves it's all on God I'm hidden in Christ Jesus we so quickly want to justify ourselves we're so worried about our image it's only God's image that's at stake you'll take care of it amen he says now just don't love them and say and say well I'm supposed to do it but you love them anyhow if you don't love him from your heart you have to say if you have to say you love him when you don't he says you know what that makes you a hypocrite see don't walk up and tell them you do less you really do and if you don't feel that way just stay right here until you feel that way because I'll assure you there's sufficient Grace to make you feel that way oh thank you Lord that's right it really will well brother Chris I just can't seem to get over this thing well just stay there in the presence of God just keep staying there in my run sister there's that as we heard this morning there's that warm feeling that comes over you God pours in his grace and his love to you so that you can love that individual brother Branham talks about the the third pull demonstration this is the the great uh strong arm of the message my brother and sister is that we are in the third pool Ministry and we're seeing the the effects of it and we desire the third pull it's all got to do with Love by the way we're so concerned about the demonstration and the power to speak to hornets and a bull and and speak food on our table Without Love no way no way the third pull is because of love it was love that that spoke to the Hornets it was love that spoke to the bull it was loud that brought that little fish back to life he says and when I was mowing This Grass I run in forgot about it there was a hornet's nest back there and I hit that fence with this mowing machine and I was covered over with Hornets them great big fellows they'll knock you down when they get when they hit you he says at first I was scared truly no shirt on and something or another happened this is the keys right to loving the right way I was sorry I hit those fellows not because that I was afraid I was going to get stung so he wasn't out of fear love doesn't know fear there's no fear in love right just perfect love he says I was afraid I was not afraid I was going to get stung but really it sounds juvenile but if we could just be more juvenile he says if we could be more childlike he says it's the Simplicity of God that turns college students around be simple in those things just like a baby just rely and believe don't try to push yourself just relax and believe it that's all don't try to work yourself up oh God hallelujah and rebuke it no no that's no good no just believe it and walk on that's all so when that happened I thought them poor little fellows up there in their nest now and here I done hit the fence and knock them out of their fence that big old mowing machine I was pushing and I said you little you're little creatures of God I'm sorry that I hit this fence I'm sorry that I Disturbed you but I'm God's servant and I'm praying for his sick children I got to hurry and mow this this yard so now you rush right back into your nest I won't bother you no more in the name of the Lord Jesus and I started my mower off again and stopped and I'd pull the string and start it off like that and then B's just a humming all around my naked shoulders and they took a b line and went right back to their nest without stinging at all love and then he says I can't produce it I can't work it up God's got to give it there's where it is tonight God has to give it then love produces a fellowship now when God said back there the day that sin had separated the Divine love God told Adam and Eve not to eat those certain fruits and they did and sin brought separation and sin by separation brought hatred malice strife and envy is that right what happened they separated from Divine love and when you separate from Divine love then you can't overlook your brother's mistakes no more you've got to ball him out for it that's right you can't overlook your sister's mistakes no more because you've got to get because you've got away from that Divine part that love part but if you really love the Lord Jesus if sister or brother does something to you oh well that's all right they didn't mean to do it that's the kind of love that Christ had father forgive them they don't know what they're doing what if he'd held my sins against me what an awful person I was but he loved me so well that he forgave me for them when I was undone he forgave me he loved me with a pure love and when Adam separated himself from Pure Love from keeping God's word in his heart when he did that these other faculties come in Malice Envy Strife hatred so forth I think we've just gotten off the main thing is it possible it's okay because the prophet told us we can do the right thing from today on it's okay we're under a Grace Covenant we can fix this whole thing right now it's in our power to do so he says now when God's seen his children had separated he come down for fellowship and there was no one there to welcome him remember the other night when I preached on the woman washing Jesus feet he was unwelcome by the Pharisees he was on he's unwelcome tonight by many people he's unwelcomed in many churches in many cities look when Israel was divided in up their lands dividing up their lands there I believe it was God was one of them and perhaps the half tribe they didn't go over into the promised land they stayed on this side borderline Jesus visited that same people and look at the results of staying out of the full benefits of God's love when Jesus visited them he went over in gadara that's where they were where they were dwelling that's where they made that's where they were come from right there and their attitude was still the same see it cost them a bunch of hogs to have the meeting and they asked Jesus to leave their land they didn't want nothing to do with it they had their own ways they had their own churches they didn't want nothing to do with Jesus so they asked him to leave the land where is Jesus Christ today is in his people I wonder how many times he has he has felt unwelcome but he went anyhow because there was one Soul calling for him just think cross that stormy Lake over across there to find that one soul in need that was his love for one needy Soul he will come from Glory tonight to the school auditorium for one need his soul that will believe in him and so then when sin came in it separated man from his Fellowship notice what God did to bring man back to fellowship he introduced to the world a blood Redemption God killed animals and put it for their sin showing a blood Redemption and their God after being separated from his creatures God laid out the welcome mat home by shedding of the blood and that was then and has been and will always be God's provided preparation for fellowship with him is through this shed blood I just got three more quotes and then I want to get into this letting go of the rope we're doing really good for time here we're doing all right he says and he there's one of the greatest hindrance that there is in the church today the greatest hindrance and right here at Edmonton or not Edmonton I didn't mean to say that I mean Prince Albert and among other people everywhere is fear but love perfect love casts without fear see you're fearful is because the right Temperance of love has never entered yet when there's real love all fear passes away when you really love the Lord he says now I'm not condemning you I'm only trying to bring something to light that you could look at because after all these sick people sitting here and Sinners and so forth and the differences what makes it all I can't believe that God's pleased with it so there must be some remedy and if we can find that remedy we ought to use that so the thing it is it's a lack of love no matter how many prophecies we have how many great preachers how much theology we know how great a church we belong to if love doesn't temper that together it's of none oh brother of course we want to see more miracles we want to see healings taking place we know how to do it right we know how to do it sometimes we think oh I just don't have faith and and we need more faith and we need stronger Ministries and bring in an evangelist and do this and all those things are fine as long as you have love right but sometimes we put the card before the horse and we'd say oh well where is God and all these things he's saying where's the love even in First Corinthians 13 though I speak with tongues of men and angels and become as sounding brass and tingling simple though I have prophecy and knowledge and understand all the mysteries of God and have faith to move mountains and have not love I am become nothing so what should we really strive for what is the thing we really want in our lives what is the most important thing we should have based on the scripture Beyond Mysteries Beyond healings and and speaking in tongues beyond all those demonstrations my brother and sister were fine with all those things are all promises that we that belongs to the church but it should be built on this on the right foundation otherwise you'll think you're serving God and he's nowhere near because remember in the Bible they were casting out Devils they were doing all those things in Jesus name and when they came to Jesus he said depart from me I don't even know who you are okay you're going to take a sharp turn what inspired me in this sermon topic was the story of Corey ten Boom does anybody know the story of Corey ten Boom incredible incredible story now she would be a very good example of how to forgive right the Unforgivable right but I think her example and what God did for her is very good for us as message believers and I don't think any of us I'm pretty sure not any of us here today would have the same story that she did right you know we started to look at other people and we realized man we really have nothing to be sorry for we have nothing to be complaining about we have nothing to be criticizing over man this is really nothing because it is so here's just an extract from The Hiding Place by Corey ten Boom and I'm going to read it with you you can read it with me but as we go through you're going to you're going to pick up little nuggets there there's little steps that she took to be free completely from any Grudge or any hurt feelings okay and it's the same process that the prophet has been telling us about and the scriptures have been showing to us it's amazing that it worked for her huh will it not work for us also he says it was in a church in Munich that I saw him a balding heavyset man in a gray Overcoat a brown felt hat clutch between his hands people were filling filing out of the basement room where I had just spoken moving along the rows of wooden chairs to the door at the rear it was 1947 and I had come from Holland to defeated Germany with a message that God forgives you know in the message what we we tell people a message also you know that God is love and God forgives and and the mysteries of God have been made plain and been unveiled to us and we bring a message but sometimes it you know we bring a message and we can say it so easily but it hasn't really happened here right and that's just how this woman starts us off she says you know that that she went to defeated Germany what a noble cause what an incredible thing we would say that she's already found the the power to forgive if she is going to Germany and helping people forgive Germans for the things that they did to them to the Jews right and so we we see how that this already sounds like man she's already doing really well she's obviously overcome all the hurts and grudges and pains in her life and here she is going and preaching a message of forgiveness but something happens and God has a way of bringing something our way he has a way of bringing somebody face to face with us where you go to realize God I'm not strong enough for this Hallelujah but God's grace is strong enough there's a power my brother and sister where you can face that person face to face and you can truly love them not just talk about it but truly love the individual it was the truth they needed most to hear in that bitter bombed out land and I gave them my favorite mental picture because we maybe because the sea is never far from a hollander's mind I like to think that that's where forgiven sins were thrown when we confess our sins I said God cast them into the deepest ocean gone forever and the solemn faces stared back at me not quite daring to believe there there were never questions after a talk in Germany in 1947 people just stood up in silence in silence collected their raps in silence left the room what an awesome thing to consider that you can be forgiven see sometimes we can't forgive ourselves he says and that's when I saw him working his way forward against the others One Moment I Saw the Overcoat in the brown hat the next a blue uniform and advisored cap with its skull and crossbones and it came back with a rush the huge room with its harsh overhead lights and the pathetic pile of dresses and shoes in the center of the floor the shame of walking naked past this man I could see my sister's frail form ahead of me ribs sharp beneath the parchment's skin Betsy how thin you were and Betsy and I had been arrested for concealing Jews in our home through during the Nazi occupation of Holland and this man had been a guard at ravensbrook concentration camp where we were sent this man this man would would finally come face to face with her the one that that exposed him the one that caused them all that hurt now he was in front of me hand thrusts out a fine message for a line how good it is to know that as you say all our sins are at the bottom of sea see he knew that God did something for him but did she know that and I who had spoken so glibly of forgiveness fumbled in my pocketbook rather than take that hand she was preaching forgiveness and now she's face to face with a very Challenge and she can't bring her hand out of her pocket because it's so real these things are real my brother and sister these things heard Deep and and they change Us in ways we don't realize until you come face to face with that thing confronted he would not remember me of course how could he remember one prison among those thousands of women but I remembered him and the leather crop swinging from his belt I was face to face with one of my captors and my blood seemed to freeze you mentioned Raven's broken your talk he was saying I was a guard there no he did not remember me but since that time he went on I have become a Christian I know that God has forgiven me for the cruel things I did there is that amazing God can forgive a man like that could he erase sorry the cruel things I did there but I would like to hear it from your lips as well Fraulein again the hand came out will you forgive me what power is given into our hearts what ability has been given to you and I to forgive what a message of Hope to this crazy dying frustrated world that we have in our hearts will you forgive me and I stood there I whose sins that again and again to be forgiven had to be forgiven and could not forgive Betsy had died in that place her sister could he erase her slow terrible death simply for the asking could he fix all the hurts and the wrongdoings could he fix all the things he did to me to my sister can he erase that terrible event just by asking for forgiveness it could not have been many seconds that he stood there handheld out but to me it seemed hours as I wrestled with the most difficult thing I had ever faced and here she is preaching forgiveness for I had to do it I knew that the message that God forgives has a prior condition that he forgave forgive those who have injured us if you don't forgive men their trespasses Jesus says neither will your father in Heaven forgive your trespasses this is Dangerous Ground my brown sister if we do not forgive we will not be forgiven what a challenge I knew it not only as a commandment of God but as a daily experience since the end of the war I have had a home in Holland for victims of Nazi brutality those who were able to forgive their former enemies were able also to return to the outside world and rebuild their lives no matter what the physical scars look at the the freedom it brought to those people that were able to forgive those who nurse their bitterness remained invalids it was as simple and as horrible as that and let's take a look around the message World in our families those who nurse bitterness oh a pastor hurt me or a deacon hurt me those who nurse brother my parents were legalistic those who nurse bitterness will be an invalid forever and I'm here to bring you a message of Grace and love today that you can be free from that you don't have to live like that just forgive and let go it's horrible and as simple as that is he says and still I stood there with a coldness clutching my heart but forgiveness is not an emotion I knew that too forgiveness is an act of the will and the will can function regardless of the temperature of the heart help I prayed silently I can lift my hand I can do that much you supply the feeling isn't that the most powerful thing we need to act by faith that's why when we raise our hands in church we're saying Lord I believe I would defy gravity it's an action but God brings the Holy Spirit God brings the increase God brings the healing God brings the right feeling and so woodenly mechanically I thrust my hand into the one stretched out to me and as I did an incredible thing took place the current started in my shoulder and it raced on my arm and sprang into my into our joined hands and then this healing warmth seemed to flood my whole being bringing tears to my eyes how many wants to be free this morning you got to do the mechanical thing you got to start somewhere make an action God Will Supply the rest God Will Supply the rest I forgive you brother I cried with all my heart for a long moment we grasped each other's hands the former guard and the former prisoner what a picture I had never known God's love so intensely as I did then and having thus learned to forgive in this hardest of situations I never again had difficulty in forgiving I wish I could say it I wish I could say that merciful and charitable thoughts just naturally flowed from me from then on but they didn't if there's one thing I've learned in 80 years of age is that I can't store up good feelings and behavior but only draw them fresh from God each day that's so incredible that you would think that everything was settled from then on she had this amazing power in her life to overcome and to forgive but it it had to happen every day every day God would Supply maybe I'm glad it's that way for every time I go to him he teaches me something else I recall the time some 15 years ago when some Christian friends whom I loved and trusted did something which hurt me now this is after this this this episode with this guard so you would think that this would be easy now that she could just go on her way and she it would be easy to forgive but look at the situation that comes up Christian friends I Christian friends right they did it all in Christian love right and brotherly love right Christian friends did something that hurt me you would have thought that having forgiven the Nazi guard that would have been Child's Play it wasn't for weeks it seized inside but at last I asked God again to work his miracle in me and again it happened first the cold-blooded decision and then the flood of joy and peace first a cold-blooded decision don't wait for the feeling first first trust in God then they say I will fight your battles then they say we can cast our cares upon Him he would never leave us nor forsake us first belief First Trust first extend the hand and watch what God will do I had forgiven my friends I was restored to my father then why was I suddenly awake watch this here in the middle of the night hashing over the whole Affair again my friends I thought people I loved they're message believers if it had been strangers I wouldn't have minded so I sat up and I switched on the light father I thought it was all forgiven please help me do it but the next night I woke up again they talked so sweetly too huh never a hint of what they were planning father I cried an alarm help me his help came in the form of a kindly Lutheran Pastor to whom I confessed my failure after two Sleepless weeks so she had had enough she needed help so she goes through this pastor this Lutheran pastor and he can and she confines in him because it was you know she was losing sleep and it was just not working you would think she would have had this sorted out already but see these things can be so deep we don't notice them we wonder you know why am I miserable why can't I sleep there's something rooted on the very in the very depths of our heart somebody hurt you or or there's a feeling and we need to uproot it we need to get somebody with a strong enough shovel and a picture pickaxe to get in there and get and remove it so she goes to this pastor and asks him for help up in that church Tower he said nodding out the window he says Isabel which is rung by pulling a rope there's a bell there that's pulled that's rung by pulling on a rope but you know what after the sexton let's go of the Rope the Bell keeps swinging and first ding and dong slower and slower until there's a final dung and it stops I believe the same thing is true of forgiveness when we forgive someone we take our hands off the Rope but if we've been tugging at our grievances for a long time we mustn't be surprised if that old angry thoughts keep coming for a while they're just the ding dongs of an Old Bell slowing down that helped me so much you know I watched a video clip they had this Bell massive Bell you know about as big as a piano area here and it was raised off the ground a little bit and then there was this rope system tied to these pulleys and coming down on either side of this thing like this and and and if you look at this Bell sitting there it makes zero sound zero sound there's no sound coming off that Bell because it's not swinging right and it's such a nice quiet peaceful thing so restful but then you see this little guy he comes running up and he gets to the one side and he gets a hold of that rope why because his motive is to get that thing to make some noise so he gets a hold of that rope that's the only way he can make this Bell make a noise is you're going to put your hands to it it takes work right the Bell has no power in itself so what he does is he gets a hold of that rope and he starts talking on it like this but man this this is a big Bell this is a big rumor so he can't move it by himself so what does he do he calls friends over and so you know they start rallying together a little gossip group right so they get together maybe it's on Instagram or Facebook they get together and man now they've got some momentum right and man they get this thing moving and then they then they even coordinate right back and forth one two push pull right and they're going back and forth like this and before you know it Ding and you can see the cameraman is doing this it was so loud and it was so devastating and so prevalent that everything else became quiet and all you could hear was says dang dong ding and everybody's oh you know it's it's it's deafening the only way to make that thing stop dinging and donging is to let go of the Rope because it will not make any noise if you don't let it that's how forgiveness works it's a bell it's a bell that Rings Ding and dung and it shakes your whole life and it comes crashing down and it's predominant you can't hear anything else you cannot hear about the love of God you cannot hear about how you've been forgiven or how you've forgiven someone you can't hear any of those things this thing is so loud and it can be a false thing it can be false accusations it can be gossip rumors whatever it is it could be the devil probably mostly as the devil all you have to do is let go of the Rope let go of the Rope it might ding one more time might give another dong but it'll pass before you know that thing will just hang there lifeless because we have not given it any power we have not given it a voice he says I believe the same thing is it true of forgiveness when we forgive someone we take our hand off the Rope but if we've been talking at our grievances for a long time we mustn't be surprised if the old angry thoughts keep coming for a while they just they're just a ding dongs of the Old Bell slowing down and so it proved to be there were a few more midnight so it proved to be there were a few more midnight reverberations a couple of dings when the subject came up in my conversation but the force which was my willingness in the matter had gone out of them they came less and less often and at last stopped altogether so I discovered another secret of forgiveness that we can trust God not only above our emotions but also above our thoughts and still he had more to teach me man it goes deep right you sing with forgiveness even in the single episode many because many years later in 1970 an American with whom I had shared the ding dong principle came to visit me in Holland and met the people involved aren't those the friends who let you down he asked as they left my apartment thinking now watch this look how deep forgiveness goes thinking it's all settled let go of the Rope she's forgiven God has come in and has taken care of her emotions and her thoughts and all those things and here they are fellowshipping together she's they're in her home and here they're leaving the home and he asked us they left the apartment said yes aren't those the friends who let you down he asked if they left my apartment yes I said a little smugly you see it's all forgiven by you yes he said but what about them have they accepted your forgiveness they say there's nothing to forgive they deny it ever happened but I can prove it oh man that devil is Sly huh he's a slicker I know it's over again I can prove it I went eagerly to my desk I have it in black and white I saved all their letters and I can show you where right Corey my friend slipped his arm through mine and gently closed the drawer aren't you the one whose sins are at the bottom of the sea and are the sins of your friends etched in black and white and that's good you see how deep this goes we keep a record we can't help it we want to protect ourselves because what if this comes up in the future I need to defend myself I need to justify myself no you don't just let it go bury it bury it in the bottom of the sea where your sins have been buried you know it's it's amazing Jesus stood in front of his accusers and he answered not a word he could have said a lot of things he could have Justified himself he did not say a word when someone accuses you my brown sister is just a trap you don't have to answer you don't have to get involved you can let it go and when you let go don't keep a record of the event for an anguishing moment I could not find my voice Lord Jesus I whispered at last who takes all my sins away forgive me for preserving all these years the evidence against others give me Grace to burn all the blacks and whites as a sweet smelling sacrifice to your glory I think we just need to have a little bonfire here this morning and we can just come and lay all our thoughts here we can just lay all of our our little blacks and whites and put them in the fire today and just walk away and just say Lord I am not strong enough not strong enough to handle those things I'm just going to give it to you I did not go to sleep that night until I had gone through my desk and pulled out those letters curling now with age and fed them all into my little coal burning great as the Flames leaped and glowed so did my heart forgive us our trespasses Jesus taught us to pray as we forgive those who trespass against us in the ashes of those letters I was seeing yet another facet of his Mercy what more he would teach me about forgiveness in the days ahead I didn't know but tonight's a good tonight was good news enough when we bring our sins to Jesus he not only forgives them he makes them as if they had never been let's Stand Together second Timothy 1 and 7 says for God hath not given us a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind amen we know that little song the goodness of God all my life he has been faithful we have tasted of the goodness of God that song has become just very special to me because I have tasted I can Rejoice because of the goodness of God when you see what he has done for you it should be easy to do that for someone else but you see it can be so deeply rooted that that we don't notice it we don't notice that we have kept record we don't notice we think we're properly forgiven and let go of something but I would encourage each and every one of us tonight just take a moment and just say Lord is there something there is there a root is there a is there a root of bitterness is there a is there a letter is there an account is there a record that I'm keeping in my heart I don't want to keep it anymore I don't have room for this life is busy enough we've got children I've got grandchildren I've got families I've got a spouse I've got a job I don't have room for all this bitterness I don't have room for all this hatred and Malice and strife and frustration I just want to be basking in your love I just want to have peace I just want to have love and joy see the devil has tricked us into this engaging Us in justifying and categorizing and criticizing we don't have to engage on the battlefield anymore we just walk away Satan you can have it and good luck huh because it's all been put to the bottom of the ocean you're fighting you're beating at thin air because I have forgiven them isn't that incredible you hold the power to forgive someone and to set them free Capstone Ministry coming down on the bride I think we're getting down to those final moments where the bride recognizes who she is and the power that she has received we don't have to live with complexes you know it's a it's a day where there's so many pressures and complexes and insecurities and stripes and and people just seem to be going wild and crazy but not the bride it doesn't make an excuse for us to suddenly go crazy and wild and we're frustrated and we start saying those things I'm so frustrated I'm so I'm so pressured I am so you know this I'm so that well you're confessing the wrong thing greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world his grace is sufficient for me he chose to love me first I am dead in Christ Jesus amen if you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ on the house shall be saved these are the things that are in in the bride's lips and in our hearts but see the devil has tried to trick us into building up walls divisions and all we have to do all we have to do today we don't have to sort it out there doesn't have to be a court of appeal or justifications or anything you hold the power to forgive it and bury that thing and you know what you do is you take all the power away from the enemy and then when that Devil Comes you can say Satan you have no power here the judge has ruled on this case and I agree with him amen can we sing that little song together I hear your voice we know it do you know the song brother hear your voice sorry if we don't know it then that's fine we'll sing something else not a problem all my life you have been faithful [Music] all my life you have been so so good every breath that I am oh I will say of the goodness all my life you have been faithful [Music] and all my life you have been faithful [Music] thank you all my life you have been so so good every breath that I have made the goodness of God [Music] of your voice [Music] all my days I've been held in your hands from the moment that I wake up till I lay my head oh I will sing all the goodness of God [Music] all my life [Music] with every breath that I am
