it all it is well through it all through it all my eyes are on you and it is [Music] well with me I want to read from Romans chapter 12 and we'll start with verse two be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind how many know that we are not here to conform to the world to the mindset of the world but we're here to expose oursel to a presence and to the Lord's work that can bring real change and because it mentions being transformed and changed by the renewing of your mind then we must realize that's the place that God wants to work to change to cause us to grow it's in our thinking it's in our mind and so we can tie that back to the reason that we become conformed to the world it starts in the mind Satan starts in the mind and when we are conformed to that uh through the thinking then we conform to the ways of the world that's the way it works you turn that around our minds can be renewed and changed and transformed in our minds we can be renewed that we may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God I could safely say if you're interested in Walking in the will of God then you would be interested in God transforming and Renewing Your Mind If it's it's tied to the will of God and you want to be in the will of God then there's an exposure to the Lord to keep changing and renewing our thinking for I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think my it deals with the pride of thinking and that our thoughts are always lower than God's thoughts and our thoughts have to come under submission to his thoughts don't think of yourself more highly than you ought to think but to think soberly and I would say humbly a humble thinking mind according as God hath dealt to every man The Measure of Faith so verse two is what I want to emphasize be not conformed to this world in the Amplified it says to this age don't be conformed to the age that you live in but be transformed and that's by the renewing or the renovation of the Mind a complete renovation of our thinking now if you don't think I I know ministers speak on the Holy Ghost and that is the new birth and that is essential you can't have the Mind affected and our thinking affected until you have some power in here to work in your life but once that power has come to the soul our growth as a Christian is our minds being changed our thinking being changed because when we think different and think like God thinks then our lifestyle will change now going back to that word conforming so that we understand it and I trust I have your attention this morning for the word of God I believe it'll be helpful to all of us that are here those that are listening online but conforming to the world uh has a Greek word meaning the Greek word for conform is systematical and it means to be molded according to a pattern so when you're conforming to something you're actually being molded and that's a process you're molded according to a pattern so there's a certain pattern there's a certain mind ET there's a certain way to do things and over time you are formed or you are molded according to that pattern the world has a pattern the world has a pattern of thinking and God has a pattern of thinking the world has a thing called the wisdom of this world and many times it looks very good but often it's in conflict with the wisdom of God and so every human being has to make a choice what they want to be conformed by and how they want their mind our minds some are quickly when we're young sometimes our minds are quickly turned over to be open as an inlet to any thought to any image um I could quickly go to the subject of pornography because uh it's been proved over and over again when uh young people are exposed to that at a young age that that affects their whole system especially their mind we don't quickly get those images out of our mind because it's the way that God has made our minds is that if we see an image or we read need something then we find it gets into our mind it gets lodged into our spirit and that's something that we can remember and then it can affect our behavior and lifestyle down the road that's why many men uh turn to certain things that have been addicted to that because eventually there's going to be an expression of what's been planted in your mind and so now this is the way God made our minds this is the way he makes us uh us work and so to be conformed means to be molded another Christian writer says conform to this world means to follow the common behaviors and trends of the society even if they don't align with your personal convictions now can you imagine that the world's influence can be so strong through what thoughts it puts in our mind that it actually can take someone's personal convictions that they've always held that's what they believe maybe they were raised in it and they become personal convictions maybe they're God's convictions but they became personal if you let this happen this power can undermine personal convictions and all of a sudden you start conforming to the behaviors and trends of society and it all happens the same way for every one of us whether you've been in the message 30 years or whether you had not serving the lord it doesn't matter you're not above everybody you see your mind works the same way and what you put in that computer what you feed on in that computer the inlets to our spirit is what will determine our Behavior praise the Lord he goes on to say this writer he says this can involve this conforming can be Evol uh in uh involve adopting popular Styles beliefs and values being drawn to the world imitating the world studying how the world acts dressing like the world being influenced by people who are opposed to God maintaining friendships with Believers or antagonist neglecting God's means of Grace failing to engage in private and family worship and so now this is all part of conforming to the ways of the world because it starts with the mind but it's a conforming of our Behavior to those things and so according to the Bible Christians he says can escape the world's grip of Conformity is s suggestions he makes renewing their minds through the gift of the Holy Ghost I agree with that we can renew our minds this is how we counter that we allow our minds and thinking to be renewed by what by the power of the Holy Ghost he says looking to Jesus he says placing their everyday life before God is an offering fixing their attention on God these are all things I agree with is that when a person would turn their attention towards God sometimes I've watched people just turn more of their attention toward the things of God let go of some of the things they're feeding on and start their attention towards the things of God and just that in itself helps them to break break out of that Conformity to the world and Conformity to the mindset of the world he says recognizing what God wants for them and responding quickly so I agree with all those I think those are good so now my question is how do we finally conform to it where does it start when someone conforms to the lifestyles of the world where does it start starts in the mind it must start in the mind first and the devil knows that he must for form your thinking before he forms your lifestyle before he controls you to conform to something that maybe initially you didn't even want to conform to it but before he would go and say I want you to dress this way or act this way I want you to act out this and I no he has to slowly work in your thinking first the only thing that we have left that we can protect and guard over is our hearts and our minds we can't change anything else but the Bible says we can have our thinking transformed in other words if we'll be on guard and we'll put the scripture there for a guard he says he'll protect that and that's an area Satan can't get to if we'll protect it but that's the part Satan wants to get to he would love to get your soul but if you're predestinated of God and you've received the baptism of the Holy Ghost Satan can't get in the soul anymore he's been locked out you've been sealed in Christ has been sealed in until ET through eternity can you say Amen Satan can't get the soul it's almost like Satan couldn't get job to deny his God and stop his God so the only part he was left with is Job's life his family his Spirit his emotions his mind can you say amen and actually God said go at it because I've Got Confidence in job go at it have you considered job now job didn't know that but if he' have known that he' say God what what are you doing to me but we don't know these conversations that go on that have so much confidence in what God has deposited within us that God would say just let a little something go in their life let the have you considered my my can you have you considered my daughter Rachel have you considered my son John have you considered my son Joel see well that happened thousands of years ago well who told you it can't happen now who died made you interpreter of the word and he said have you considered and so now all this stuff sweeps through and if we don't get a solidness in our soul then we're not going to survive it but when we can survive it God loves to hear us sing in the midst of a trial he just breathes it in God loves to hear us sing in the valleys and so we see then that job was affected in his family I don't want to spend much time that because you know his story but my point is is that if the only part that we're left with is our minds and our spirits and the inlets of our memory imagination conscience affection reasoning if that's what we're left with that the only thing that we have the power through the Holy Ghost to put a guard up to put a protection over then that's what we should do if we're trying to guard all the rest of our life and guard our finances and do all that that's fine but listen my brother and sister and I don't know why I mentioned this a lot but listen do not do not put your trust in some retirement account do not put your trust in something that the devil couldn't touch in your money do not put your trust in that because we're going to hit times that may be taken away from us the only thing through the holy ghost that we want to protect now under this condition is our hearts and our minds we need to have the Holy Ghost protect our minds and protect our spirits and say Satan you can only go so far and if you don't put those Protections in place then you are vulnerable for you to take on a conforming state to things you maybe don't even want to be conformed to how Satan comes in is very subtle it's not out there saying hey dude I want to go to the bar are with you let's go he doesn't do it that way true he does it through a subtle way he gets in we had a problem the last few months with uh with mice getting in my garage and you know it's we we haven't had that 5 years in the house all of a sudden now things changing and now we got some mice popping up in the garage so we had to deal with it for about two or three weeks my son-in-law and and I we you know we're putting the traps out and we're doing all these things and we caught about six of them looks like we taken care of the problem but the question is how do they get in they weren't getting in before how did they get in I mean I didn't put a sign up and say hey guys it's getting cold why you come on the garage you know I didn't welcome that and a lot of times the enemy has things we wouldn't welcome it at all but then you look how did it get in where did it start what music did I listen to where did it start how did it get in my mind what did I read what did I feed on because there's always some other way that the mice can get in we had a house in B bcro solone lives there now for years I dealt with Critters in the ceiling in the attic and they were making noise all the time waking us up nervously I dealt with those things about 5 10 years I paid a lot of money for companies to come out and we could not find where these Critters were getting in and I was checking all along had companies and myself check along the top looking for holes to get in I found a few I sealed those holes we still had Critters every winter they weren't invited you know I it got so bad I wanted to start charging them rent and you can't do that it's like I can make I wish I could make some money off these guys CU they're taking my heat that I'm paying for and they're just making it home up there and usually have their parties when me and Becca were sleeping and so one day here uh the LA one of the last years I lived there one of the guys that had come out finally we're looking and we're looking at a place we would expect it's down below it's underneath the siding and and so there's a big hole there and all those 10 years they're getting in a place that we didn't expect it's always been a lesson to me to realize he'll come in unexpected places the mice the critters will get in in unexpected places there are inlets to our spirit of me memory imagination conscience affection reasoning these are the places that Satan can wreak havoc with in your own personal life because you're letting him invade your thinking and then conform you to something now you know I don't the word conform I just wish that we had more time about that but I just want you to know it's not just Satan's agenda to conform you to the behavior of the world Conformity can happen in many different environments including the church yeah and churches can preach Conformity and reform instead of transformation instead of Change by the Holy Ghost instead of true bringing something to True repentance that their life can be changed they're happy just to see people conformed to a certain Behavior that's even within our ranks if you just dress this way if you'll do it this way and so we must be careful we've got a lot of young people that's growing up and the the emphasis was if you would just conform to this you'll be okay I think that's just as wrong as conforming to the world the Bible says we are transformed we are not conformed even to Christianity we're not conformed to it we're changed into Christianity can I get an amen this morning it's a change it's not being forced to do something you say well parents do that because yeah yeah you you give them Direction you do all that but listen if you're giving your kids something to live by without praying for them to get a relationship with Christ you're doing them a disservice it has to be a balance I'm not wanting to conform to any other man's idea I want to preach this Bible in power and demonstration and make the Bible live to people because people need a God that's living can you say Amen they need a super natural God they don't need a religion can you say Amen we need a real God that we can talk to every day we need a real God it answers back to our prayer we dealt with cancer and other things we need a real God for that and people are transformed transformed by the preaching of the word maybe you're sitting here this morning you said I have felt that being conformed and I res Ed it and I've ran away from it I understand what that feels like I minister to thousands of people who've grown up underneath that and it's a rough road but I just want to encourage you you don't have to be conformed anything because I preaching a God to you if you'll open the door he wants to change what you can't change see you can you think you can change yourself you can't change yourself but this a God that can change you so I've been there I understand being conformed to something you want to run away from it a lot of people are very susceptible to all the criticisms to the message the the people that's most susceptible to it has grown up and it's become a bondage to them and they're looking for escape and that's the endorsement this thing is wrong well you've taken my goodness friend be careful because uh Jesus said Elijah will come and restore all things Jesus said said that so be careful what you're going against in the name of it's all a Conformity to me it's all I understand that but listen now there's a God that loves you there's a God who wants to give you true change Romans 1 verse 18 says for the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth and unrighteousness because that which may be known of God is Manifest in them for God hath showed it unto them them for the invisible things from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things which are made even his eternal power in Godhead so that they are without excuse because that when they knew God they glorified him not as God neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened Pro professing themselves to be wise they became fools and changed the glory of The Incorruptible God into an image make made like un corruptible man and to birds and to four-footed beasts and creeping things wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through lust of their own Hearts to dishonor their own bodies between themselves who changed the truth of God into a lie and worship and serve the creature more than the Creator who is blessed forever amen for this cause God gave them up unto vile affections for even their women did change the natural youth use into that which is against nature lesbianism and likewise Al also the men leaving the natural use of a woman burned in their lust one toward another men with men working that which is unly and receiving in themselves the recompence of their Heir which was meat skip verse 28 I'm coming back to it being filled 29 being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness Covetous maliciousness full of eny murder debate deceit malignity Whisperers backbiters haters of God dis despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil things disobedient to parents you just just see the whole atmosphere just get very very without understanding Covenant Breakers without natural affection implacable unmerciful who knowing the Judgment of God that these things commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them to do you're looking at all that and you're going how in the world that people conform to all of that and I think the answer is back to verse 28 and even as they did not like to retain God in in their knowledge God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do things which are not convenient the pattern and the Conformity came after they made a choice to not retain God in their knowledge be careful for nothing don't be anxious or worried about anything see one of the things when our minds are so bombarded and not guarded one of the attributes is anxiousness some sometimes panic attacks sometimes nervousness because our minds are actually our minds were not built to handle the environment of that we're in in other words the growing uh intellectual side the growing technical side our minds were never meant to handle all of that stuff and science shows that we we don't that's not our minds are supposed to be more simple than that so all this that Mar bars he says 'do not be anxious or worry about anything but he says but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your request be made known unto God who are we turning to we're going to turn to God every time and if we do he says don't be anxious don't be a worried about anything quickly take it to God the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall guard and keep your hearts and your minds through Christ Jesus thank you for watching our service today if you would like more information please contact us
