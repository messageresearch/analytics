[0:11] second samuel chapter 13 and verse 1 and
[0:14] it came to pass after this that absalom
[0:16] the son of david had a fair sister
[0:19] whose name was tamar and amnon the son
[0:21] of david loved her
[0:23] and amnon was so vexed that as we said a
[0:26] couple sundays ago this couldn't be true
[0:27] love because he was vexed there's no
[0:29] vexation and true love
[0:31] and amnon was so vexed that he fell sick
[0:33] for his sister tamar for she was a
[0:36] virgin and amnon thought now we're into
[0:39] amnon's thinking what's in his mind
[0:41] amnon thought it hard for him to do
[0:44] anything to her
[0:46] amnon thought
[0:48] it was hard for him to get to her it was
[0:51] hard for him to get to her why was it
[0:53] hard to get to her why was it he wanted
[0:55] to do this thing with her but he found
[0:57] it hard why did he find it hard because
[1:00] god had put protections in place
[1:04] and if he were going to do something he
[1:05] was going to override all of god's
[1:07] boundaries and protections to do what he
[1:10] wanted to do
[1:12] heavenly father
[1:14] i pray the people would be gracious
[1:16] enough just to give me a few more
[1:17] minutes today
[1:18] i realized i'd take so long in those
[1:20] things but lord may they see my heart i
[1:23] love them whatever they would decide to
[1:24] do i would lord i wouldn't have the love
[1:26] of christ if i didn't love them anyway
[1:29] i'll stand here i'll preach the word
[1:31] lord i'll i'll be a friend to them
[1:34] whoever they are and most of them that
[1:36] been with me a long time they they know
[1:38] that lord i believe they know that but
[1:40] god i want to be faithful to your house
[1:43] i want to be faithful to this house
[1:45] i want to be faithful to the very last
[1:47] day that we get out of here i want to
[1:50] stand faithful to the word of god
[1:52] lord i'm not afraid of all the voices
[1:54] and all the different directions people
[1:58] lean towards i'm not afraid of that lord
[2:00] because i know
[2:01] when we hold your word before the people
[2:04] and they'll embrace it there's nothing
[2:06] but blessing and glories there's
[2:07] persecution oh they'll get laughed at
[2:10] but lord there's nothing that but
[2:12] blessings that come from heaven when
[2:14] someone decides to follow the precepts
[2:16] and principles of god's word so i pray
[2:19] you'll bless them and may they have a
[2:21] heart to receive
[2:22] lord may they take these things and pray
[2:24] about them we commit the service to you
[2:26] now in jesus name amen
[2:28] amen god bless you may be seated
[2:31] so brother isaiah last sunday
[2:35] um had a couple thoughts there that i
[2:38] had wrote down a wonderful message and i
[2:40] it's a couple things i wrote down
[2:42] and that ran really really deep
[2:44] and i'm just going to bring up one of
[2:45] them that you know fit real well with
[2:47] the subject this morning and talking
[2:49] about amnon i want to talk about ammon
[2:51] in this text about amnon it's kind of a
[2:54] strange
[2:55] section of the scripture to read and
[2:56] take a little series on it but you'll
[2:58] see the reasons why after a while it's a
[3:00] strange text to pull subjects from amnon
[3:04] uh raped tamar he
[3:06] he was in the kingdom of god he was they
[3:08] were both from david they were they were
[3:10] part of the jewish belief system and the
[3:13] jewish belief system had a lot of laws
[3:16] and boundaries in place there
[3:18] and amnon would have had to override all
[3:20] of these boundaries and all these jewish
[3:22] laws he wasn't a heathen now he was in
[3:24] the church he heard all these laws he
[3:26] knew what to do and he gets in his mind
[3:28] he's going to override all these things
[3:30] and he ends up raping tamar
[3:32] so it might be a strange thing to take
[3:34] in the scripture a rape case but there's
[3:36] very much in here and i have many
[3:38] reasons to break it down to you maybe in
[3:40] the next few services i want to title
[3:42] this today amnon the mind of this
[3:43] generation amnon the mind of this
[3:46] generation
[3:48] so because i've entered an all-out
[3:50] attack here against the enemy we're
[3:52] meeting together 7 30 if you want to
[3:53] join us for prayer because i'm in an
[3:56] attack against the enemy and what he's
[3:57] doing in people's minds i'm going to
[3:59] stand with the lord because that's the
[4:02] first thing we do is we go to prayer can
[4:03] you say amen
[4:05] and and we stand against the when the
[4:07] enemy comes in like a flood the spirit
[4:09] of the lord raises up a standard against
[4:11] it so if you want to pray for with us
[4:13] every thursday morning at 7 30 whether
[4:15] here in the building or in your homes it
[4:17] will be great or if you're at work by
[4:18] that time you will hear a thread of the
[4:21] subject in these things related to
[4:23] sexual perversion you're going to hear
[4:24] that pop up and i will try to talk about
[4:26] it as tactfully as i can but it's
[4:29] something satan does not want us to talk
[4:31] about
[4:31] pornography is something satan does not
[4:33] want us to talk about to brothers and
[4:35] sisters
[4:36] sexual temptation is something satan
[4:38] does not want to talk about but it was
[4:40] it's one of the undercurrents that satan
[4:42] uses to defeat uh men and women and
[4:45] families and it's one of the
[4:47] undercurrents and where sometimes it
[4:49] happens where a family is exposed and it
[4:51] all comes out that's sometimes it
[4:53] happens but there's there's probably a
[4:55] bunch of other cases where it never
[4:56] comes out and just satan keeps everybody
[4:59] defeated because it hasn't come out yet
[5:01] i'm here to stand to stand against the
[5:03] enemy to talk about it according to the
[5:05] word of god so that some people will get
[5:07] victory over these things
[5:09] brother isaiah mentioned the change in
[5:11] the age to changing our thinking on
[5:13] things in other words there's been such
[5:15] an onslaught of social media and the
[5:17] wisdom of this world and people are
[5:19] changing their minds on the scripture
[5:21] and changing their minds on the way they
[5:23] used to believe and changing so so it's
[5:25] and he mentioned this it was so deep so
[5:27] so it's changing our thinking so much
[5:30] that that it actually changed normal
[5:33] biology and now biology normal biology
[5:36] of the of a man and woman normal biology
[5:39] of a man or woman has to bow to
[5:41] psychology that's the way he said it
[5:43] biology has to bow to psychology in
[5:45] other words
[5:46] something that's normal and natural now
[5:49] he so fills the minds that the mind
[5:52] overrides even normal biology and the
[5:54] mind says you're not a woman you're a
[5:56] man you're not a man you're you're a
[5:57] woman because of this spirit that goes
[5:59] with that
[6:01] so now you have to look at not only that
[6:04] where he begins to mess with the mind
[6:06] and then that psychology is the study of
[6:08] the mind and thinking and how it affects
[6:10] behavior and so he's messing with the
[6:12] minds to make it number one question and
[6:15] mock the word of god satan is messing
[6:18] with the world's minds and guess what
[6:20] he's trying to mess with our minds to
[6:22] change our perception of the word of god
[6:25] and question the word and mock the word
[6:28] and say the word is out of date i want
[6:30] to say after i've said all these things
[6:31] this morning the word is never out of
[6:33] date the message is not out of date
[6:38] what the prophet preaches more relevant
[6:41] today in 2022 than it has ever been you
[6:44] say no he was in the 60s it was no no
[6:46] it's more relevant today that's why i'm
[6:48] preaching it
[6:49] and so now first of satan does to mess
[6:52] with our minds is to get us to question
[6:54] and mock the word of god but even
[6:56] natural normal biology of a man and
[6:59] woman it mocks that and says no i'm not
[7:02] a man i'm a woman and the the psychology
[7:05] of it changes the mind if you pull up
[7:07] there in the back romans chapter one
[7:09] this is where we find the cycle of it
[7:11] happening and the scripture by the way
[7:13] is crystal clear here how the
[7:15] deterioration coming to homosexuality
[7:17] happens i'm not talking about
[7:18] homosexuality i'm telling you how you
[7:20] get there and i'm here to tell you the
[7:21] romans 1 here starting at verse 18 it
[7:24] tells how it happens for the wrath of
[7:26] god was revealed from heaven against all
[7:28] ungodliness and unrighteousness of men
[7:30] who hold the truth in unrighteousness
[7:32] because that which may be known of god
[7:34] is manifest in them for god has shown it
[7:36] unto them for the invisible things of
[7:38] him from the creation of the world are
[7:40] clearly seen being understood by the
[7:42] things that are made even his internal
[7:44] power and godhead so that they are
[7:46] without excuse because that when they
[7:48] knew god they glorified him not as god
[7:51] neither were thankful but became vain
[7:55] in their imaginations and their foolish
[7:57] heart was darkened so where does it
[7:59] start the imagination the mind
[8:02] became empty vain
[8:04] thoughts vain thoughts empty thoughts
[8:06] not solid thoughts not word thoughts
[8:09] vain thoughts professing themselves to
[8:11] be wise they became fools and changed
[8:13] the glory of the uncountable god into an
[8:15] image made like unto a corruptable man
[8:17] to birds four footed beasts and creeping
[8:19] things wherefore god also gave them up
[8:22] to uncleanness through the lusts of
[8:23] their own hearts to dishonor their own
[8:26] bodies between themselves now we have
[8:28] the sin coming the sin starts in the
[8:29] mind they change their mindset on stuff
[8:32] but now god gives them up to their
[8:34] lustful ways verse 25 who changed the
[8:36] truth of god into a lie worshipped and
[8:38] serve the creature more than the creator
[8:40] who is blessed forever amen for this
[8:42] cause
[8:43] god gave them up unto vile affections
[8:46] for even their women did change the
[8:47] natural use into with that which is
[8:51] catch this term
[8:52] into that which is against
[8:55] nature
[8:57] so as brother isaiah said
[8:59] biology has to bow now to psychology
[9:03] in other words
[9:04] when this gets in the mind it even goes
[9:06] against nature
[9:08] what's normal a normal marriage
[9:12] a normal family relations between a man
[9:14] and a woman
[9:15] a normal courtship in dating
[9:21] hello
[9:22] a normal way to dress
[9:25] on what's normal what's just normal
[9:28] because years ago 100 years ago friends
[9:30] it was 100 years ago it was it was
[9:32] normal for a woman to wear a dress
[9:34] probably 120 years ago now it was normal
[9:36] it wasn't it wasn't because they did it
[9:38] because of the word of god it was normal
[9:39] that a woman dressed like a woman a man
[9:41] dressed like a man she didn't wear the
[9:43] pants
[9:44] but this spirit when it comes in the
[9:46] mind of the people and they change their
[9:48] mind they evolve into a changed mindset
[9:51] they eventually get to everything now
[9:53] where it's against nature i don't want
[9:55] to do that i'm not going to do that
[9:56] that's you i've always believed that but
[9:58] that's not the truth now things have
[9:59] changed a little bit it's against nature
[10:01] it's against god but it's against nature
[10:05] too
[10:06] against that which is normal
[10:09] and likewise also men leaving the
[10:11] natural use of a woman burned in their
[10:13] lust toward one another men with men
[10:15] working that which is unseemly and
[10:17] receiving in themselves that recompense
[10:19] of their heir which was meat and even as
[10:22] they did not like to retain god in their
[10:25] where in their knowledge in their mind
[10:28] in their thinking
[10:30] god gave them over to a reprobate mind
[10:33] to do those things which are not
[10:34] convenient being filled with all the
[10:36] unrighteousness fornication wickedness
[10:38] covetous maliciousness full of envy
[10:40] murder debate deceit malignity whispers
[10:43] backbiters haters of god despiteful
[10:46] proud boasters oh my goodness
[10:51] verse 31 without understanding covenant
[10:53] breakers without natural affection
[10:55] impeccable
[10:57] unmerciful
[10:58] all this all this you say wow thank god
[11:00] i'm none of that
[11:02] if you yield your mind to the mindset of
[11:03] the world this is the direction it goes
[11:06] changes your mindset on stuff
[11:09] changes how you think about normal
[11:11] natural things
[11:12] that's not natural anymore brother
[11:14] brahman says how do we ever get kennedy
[11:16] into a presidency first catholic
[11:18] president how do we ever put a catholic
[11:20] president
[11:21] as president when we left the catholic
[11:24] system to come for
[11:25] freedom of
[11:26] worship and so many years later now we
[11:29] elect a catholic president why because
[11:32] the minds have become so deceived they
[11:35] don't know the deception behind that
[11:36] system anymore they forgot it let's put
[11:38] in a catholic president and the women
[11:40] put him in he said
[11:42] and so that's what changes over time is
[11:44] the mindset the change the thinking
[11:46] changes
[11:47] and so brother isaiah mentions the
[11:49] change in the age to our thinking on
[11:51] things so much so that's changed so let
[11:53] me just move down here that's why
[11:55] another thing has changed is that god
[11:58] rose with his ministry in the last days
[12:00] with healing his wings he did it 2000
[12:01] years ago he rose with healing in his
[12:04] wings when we think of healing we think
[12:06] of physical healing and when he arose in
[12:08] the ministry of brother branham
[12:10] and christ dealing that it was great
[12:12] healing campaigns it was great healing
[12:14] lines but it was mostly physical healing
[12:18] but now if you see that the if you see
[12:21] the change happening where satan has
[12:23] about 70 years here to affect the mind
[12:27] through
[12:27] 100 years because tv is back then 100
[12:31] years of t you take 100 years of tv
[12:33] of radio of now the internet of social
[12:36] media access to the wisdom of the world
[12:39] and then access to the filthiest
[12:41] dirtiest sexual images you a person
[12:44] should never see
[12:46] you take a hundred years of that
[12:48] now where's the healing needed
[12:51] in the mind
[12:53] oh we still have physical sickness
[12:55] we still it's amazing we got more
[12:57] medicine we ever had and still got sick
[12:58] people still got cancer so we we still
[13:01] need his atonement for healing can you
[13:03] say man but what is the main healing we
[13:06] need today i can tell you we need a
[13:08] healing of the mind
[13:11] everybody ever suggest a healing line
[13:13] for for mental illness
[13:17] we've got a lot of mental illness on
[13:19] different levels i'm not talking about a
[13:21] person who's who's got a mental problem
[13:23] in the sense of a special needs i'm
[13:26] talking if we feed on things all these
[13:28] years we're not thinking sound anymore
[13:30] we're not thinking straight anymore
[13:32] there's a lot of mental illness going
[13:34] and that's why we have medicines for
[13:35] that now
[13:36] but i want to remind the devil this
[13:38] morning that our atonement was not only
[13:40] for physical healing not only to heal
[13:43] cancer but in the atonement he went to
[13:45] calvary for is for mental illness as
[13:48] well
[13:49] because he said i've given you
[13:51] i'm not giving you the spirit of fear
[13:53] but of power and of love and of a sound
[13:55] mind
[13:58] how many raise your hand say i want the
[14:00] devil to know this morning our atonement
[14:02] covers mental illness as well
[14:04] people are not thinking straight anymore
[14:07] because they fed on too many things
[14:10] i encourage you put some of that stuff
[14:13] away and get into the word of god and
[14:15] let your mind be influenced by the word
[14:19] because if the balance of it is that
[14:21] you're feeding on social media and
[14:23] entertainments and a bunch of jokes and
[14:25] tick tock all these times and you're
[14:27] reading a little scripture with brother
[14:28] paul sunday mornings i can tell you your
[14:30] mind's going to be messed with
[14:33] your mind is going to be messed with
[14:35] even if it's decent stuff if that's all
[14:37] you feed on that's the mindset you keep
[14:39] and that's the way you start living
[14:42] it's time to lay some of that stuff down
[14:45] it's time to sanctify your life and say
[14:47] i'm gonna give more to the word of god
[14:49] this mind is not a garbage can this nine
[14:52] is not for mush can you say amen our
[14:54] bodies have become mush because of the
[14:57] foods we eat
[14:58] we're physically down because of the
[15:00] foods we eat how many know that
[15:02] but our minds have become mush too
[15:05] because what we're feeding on
[15:11] the great healing revival in the message
[15:14] those early days
[15:15] but the healing we need now it's mental
[15:18] not so much physical
[15:20] praise the lord when he gave us the
[15:22] atonement he gave us healing for all i
[15:24] believe that
[15:25] if your head is mostly in this stuff
[15:27] instead of the word
[15:28] then you're slowly changing and you're
[15:30] thinking you don't realize it standards
[15:31] are starting to slip
[15:33] for amnon
[15:34] can you give me about 20 more minutes
[15:36] here
[15:37] for amnon i want you to think deeply
[15:39] about ammon here for amnon to carry out
[15:41] what he did in a rape
[15:44] it was a long time
[15:46] of his mind going unchecked
[15:49] and unaccountable
[15:51] there was a private feeding on things
[15:54] even if it was on his own thoughts
[15:56] unchecked by the word of god it happened
[15:59] in his mind first
[16:01] now i don't think amnon in that day had
[16:04] they didn't have tvs they didn't have
[16:07] social media they didn't have
[16:08] pornography but something is something's
[16:12] going on there's no way that a boy could
[16:13] come to this point where his mind is
[16:16] going to is trying to think about ways
[16:18] to rape his half sister
[16:20] without the mind being affected by
[16:23] something
[16:24] now the writers tell me because just two
[16:26] or three chapters earlier is when david
[16:29] himself fell in sin
[16:31] and if you think i'm going to talk about
[16:32] amna not go back to david because to me
[16:35] when you have a family some of this
[16:37] might have been a family situation that
[16:39] had taken over sexually
[16:41] and david's got dealt with by nathan the
[16:43] prophet right
[16:44] but if that trickled down then it starts
[16:47] to go through the family
[16:49] and now you got a boy that's so messed
[16:51] up in his mind he's getting ready to
[16:53] find ways that he could be with his
[16:55] half-sister even if he has to rape her
[16:57] something happened and changed that
[16:59] boy's mind even living in a jewish
[17:01] community
[17:02] even being a son of david the king
[17:06] so listen now let's not be proud and say
[17:09] this stuff does not affect me i can i
[17:12] can click on this site i can do this i
[17:14] can listen to this mindset i can do this
[17:16] don't let's not be proud because they
[17:18] were in the kingdom of david all of us
[17:20] would love to be in the kingdom of david
[17:23] let's not get pride in the message and
[17:25] think this doesn't affect us i can
[17:27] dabble and it don't affect me it does
[17:29] affect us because our minds are just
[17:30] like everybody else's
[17:32] [Applause]
[17:34] i'm preaching to you i'm not preaching
[17:36] to somebody else i'm preaching to you
[17:39] your mind is just like their minds and
[17:41] if it's not submitted to god you're
[17:43] going to start living out what's been
[17:45] put in your mind in your thoughts
[17:48] amnon amnon here had to be unchecked and
[17:51] unaccomplished until it carried out what
[17:54] was there but here's the biggest deal
[17:56] that i want to preach today most never
[17:59] carry it out to that point of a rape
[18:04] i seen a statistic last week that said
[18:07] less than one percent of sexually
[18:10] addicted people
[18:13] actually carried out to do an act
[18:16] it's all done in the realm of secrecy
[18:19] with their computer or their phone
[18:22] they're addicted they're bound by it
[18:24] but it never goes as far as admin where
[18:26] he carries out a rape less than one
[18:28] percent carries it out
[18:30] you know when i read that you know what
[18:32] it told me that's the way the devil
[18:33] likes it
[18:36] because if it comes out
[18:38] then it's exposed you deal with it like
[18:40] davidson nathan dealt with it he lost
[18:42] the child over it there was a big
[18:44] message but a lot of things don't come
[18:46] out and satan likes that because it
[18:48] stays
[18:49] under
[18:50] under everything which means you stay
[18:53] bound for years
[18:58] satan does not like exposure
[19:02] sometimes it helps say oh my family
[19:04] we're going to be embarrassed this is
[19:05] going to come out sometimes it's better
[19:07] it comes out because sometimes there's a
[19:09] deliverance
[19:11] but a lot of times there's not
[19:13] deliverance when it's kept and nobody
[19:15] knows about it
[19:17] so he carried it out but less than one
[19:19] percent today carry out everything
[19:21] that's going on in their mind so they
[19:23] say completely bound in their minds by
[19:26] what they fed on and they continue to do
[19:28] it not an act not adultery and that's
[19:30] why jesus said whosoever looketh upon a
[19:33] woman to lust after has already
[19:35] committed adultery in his heart already
[19:38] he's bringing it to a heart level
[19:41] because you could technically say
[19:44] i've never committed adultery on my wife
[19:47] i'm staying right with the commandment
[19:50] let me bring it down some more
[19:52] i am i would never wear that
[19:55] out like that i would never wear that
[19:57] immodest outfit or i'd never be
[19:59] unfaithful to my husband and present
[20:02] myself that way but brother says when
[20:04] you present your body and show too much
[20:05] of your body
[20:06] and he he looks at you you're guilty of
[20:09] it too because you presented yourself
[20:10] that way
[20:13] that's what the prophet said
[20:17] so most never carried out so in a
[20:18] nutshell he was amnon was vexed with a
[20:21] lustful eye and a heart towards tamar
[20:25] but the pitiful thing
[20:27] is here's what i get to
[20:29] he seen it was hard
[20:32] to get to her
[20:35] and begin looking for ways to get around
[20:38] this huge
[20:40] protective
[20:42] boundary or boundaries
[20:46] godly things
[20:48] in place
[20:50] normal things
[20:52] that would protect
[20:54] this virgin
[20:58] god put some things in place
[21:00] to protect just the fact that she was a
[21:02] virgin
[21:03] that's a certain
[21:05] get-back
[21:09] she's not a married woman she hasn't
[21:11] been with somebody so there's certain
[21:13] things that should back off some back
[21:15] somebody off
[21:16] she's not someone's wife if i want if i
[21:18] want her and i have a lover right then i
[21:21] should go through the right process and
[21:23] marry her
[21:24] matter of fact paul even said it's
[21:26] better to marry than to burn
[21:28] and brother man says that's burning lust
[21:30] towards if you're going to go out and
[21:31] live a dirty life then you need to go
[21:33] ahead and get married if it's all sex is
[21:35] what you want then go ahead and get
[21:36] married that's what paul said
[21:40] better to marry than to burn in lust
[21:43] play around do sneaky things
[21:45] better to marry than a bird because i
[21:47] had one preacher say the way i do my
[21:49] church is that let them burn a while i'm
[21:51] not going to marry them
[21:56] paul said
[21:58] they're going to be that way
[22:00] take that path with it but you see to
[22:02] come the normal path they don't want to
[22:04] do that and one of the reasons he didn't
[22:05] want to come to north is hit all these
[22:07] boundaries around tamar it was hard
[22:11] i find this hard to get through this he
[22:14] actually had a mind
[22:16] that's like this generation
[22:19] that's looking for ways around god's
[22:24] boundaries i've been thinking about this
[22:26] a lot do you know how many boundaries we
[22:29] enjoy even when we come in a service
[22:31] like this
[22:32] that been put in place by the prophet
[22:35] you know we come in today and we weren't
[22:37] offered coffees and everything in a cup
[22:40] holder and a big gulp and we can wear
[22:43] our shorts in and we can come in and
[22:45] we're talking across the room and you
[22:47] know and i'm describing a lot of
[22:49] churches now
[22:52] so young people where did all this come
[22:54] from that we got an order to this and we
[22:55] respect the house of god and you know we
[22:57] we do these things and we we we we want
[22:59] to keep it quiet in here we want to
[23:01] prepare our hearts we want to pray ahead
[23:02] of time and all these where do we get
[23:04] off it came from the prophet setting the
[23:06] house an order we're enjoying boundaries
[23:09] and if we if if those things if the
[23:11] deacon said we're removing all those
[23:12] things and we're just going to be a
[23:13] free-fall next sunday some of you would
[23:15] get angry
[23:17] because you're enjoying boundaries some
[23:19] of you parents are enjoying some of your
[23:21] parents are enjoying the boundaries that
[23:23] i set as a pastor for dating in
[23:25] courtship
[23:26] you're enjoying that and dads that back
[23:28] it up it's even better you're enjoying
[23:30] that because you're enjoying a certain
[23:31] protection that i have a protection from
[23:33] my daughter the pastor and the
[23:35] leadership have protection same
[23:36] predictions and you're enjoying those
[23:38] but if we remove that and say do
[23:39] whatever you want young people and we
[23:41] don't talk to them about it you wouldn't
[23:43] like it
[23:46] and i'm telling you this generation has
[23:48] been changed in its mindset against the
[23:51] word and against the the boundaries and
[23:54] protections and the godly order that's
[23:56] been set in place for a woman for a man
[23:59] for a family for marriage everything
[24:01] there's been some boundaries set in
[24:03] order and we should never let satan mess
[24:06] with our minds to change those
[24:07] boundaries we actually should be
[24:09] embracing them more than we ever have we
[24:11] all should we we need to be getting hold
[24:14] of the word and saying
[24:15] at this hour at this closing seconds of
[24:18] time judgment's hanging two things days
[24:20] of noah days of lot we see it now we see
[24:23] the full manifestation of the days of
[24:24] lot homosexuals everywhere the spirit
[24:27] trying to take our children you know
[24:28] what we should be doing i'm clinging to
[24:30] this word and this message closer than
[24:32] i've ever been before i want to know it
[24:35] i want the preacher to preach it
[24:37] i want to i want to open up this message
[24:40] to my children and i'm not afraid of any
[24:42] quotes i'm going to read the quotes to
[24:44] my kids some of your parents are afraid
[24:46] to do that because somebody's planning
[24:48] in your mind to be leery of this that's
[24:50] the devil that's told you that this is
[24:52] the thing god sent to us to be delivered
[24:59] this is what god breathed on the
[25:01] generation to save our children from
[25:04] gender well my daughter my
[25:06] boy would never turn to that they know
[25:08] better than that just watch a few years
[25:10] more
[25:12] those spirits are relentless and your
[25:13] own daughter your own son now they lean
[25:16] towards that spirit beginning to
[25:17] question whether they're a girl or not
[25:21] you're living in la la land if you don't
[25:23] think these things are out to get your
[25:25] children and the message has come
[25:28] as a protection
[25:30] to teach our children
[25:32] the token the holy ghost has been given
[25:36] for a protection can you say amen
[25:39] people still questioning it still
[25:41] doubting us so oh i don't know about we
[25:44] need to be embracing it more than we
[25:45] ever have
[25:47] you need to be sending a clear message
[25:48] to everybody to the world to your church
[25:51] and to your pastor i'm all in brother
[25:54] paul i'm all in i believe that i may not
[25:57] be living all of it right now but i'm
[25:59] all in 100 with this message
[26:02] quit riding on the fence make a decision
[26:06] what you believe
[26:08] make a decision what you believe
[26:14] when we start to allow our minds to
[26:16] think
[26:17] in ways to bust down the fences
[26:21] that god has given us in his word we're
[26:22] on bad ground amna's mind represents the
[26:25] mind of this whole generation amnon
[26:27] thought the bible says amnon thought an
[26:29] amnon thought
[26:30] i want you to underline that
[26:33] amnon thought
[26:35] i'm finding it hard to get to her amnon
[26:38] thought
[26:39] i don't like the boundaries around her
[26:42] amna thought i don't like that i can't
[26:45] have her
[26:48] what's blocking me from just having her
[26:50] like everybody else in the world if you
[26:51] want her just go for it
[26:55] i don't like the boundaries it's so hard
[26:58] to do what i really want to do
[27:02] why brother paul is it's so hard for me
[27:03] to go really do what i want to do
[27:06] it's hard to live this way
[27:09] i feel restricted by the message and by
[27:12] the boundaries i can't get what i want i
[27:15] can't wear what i want
[27:18] because of what this message says
[27:20] that is probably the prophet's opinion
[27:22] but because of this message and what it
[27:24] says i can't really go where and do what
[27:26] i want to do
[27:29] a mind that has an agenda to remove
[27:32] every standard boundary fence wall
[27:34] conviction godly principle to have life
[27:36] the way
[27:37] that you want and he thought this is
[27:39] hard
[27:40] what a deception
[27:44] what's hard
[27:46] you listening
[27:48] he thought that was hard what's hard
[27:51] is a life of sin
[27:56] because maybe you haven't been out there
[27:57] but brothers and sisters who stand and
[27:59] testify where they're sitting here this
[28:01] morning they'd love to testify to you
[28:03] they'd love to say give an ear to what
[28:05] the man's saying because my life was a
[28:07] mess
[28:10] i didn't have those boundaries i didn't
[28:12] have a preacher telling it like it is
[28:14] like this and they'd be saying please
[28:17] listen to what he's saying
[28:19] because they come from a life and you're
[28:21] they're saying you're saying this
[28:23] message is hard
[28:25] you're saying the boundaries are hard
[28:27] no
[28:28] the world is hard
[28:30] sin is hard the results of sin on your
[28:34] family and children that's what's hard
[28:36] that's what hurts can you say amen how
[28:39] in the world could this boy that was
[28:40] grown up in a jewish home and in the
[28:42] kingdom of david could ever think of it
[28:45] it's so hard to get through the way that
[28:47] i want her how can i tear this down this
[28:50] is hard what's hard is a life of sin
[28:52] what's hard is living in the world with
[28:53] no corrective love what's hard is to
[28:55] live a life with no corrective love
[28:57] that's a hard life is anybody listening
[28:59] this morning
[29:00] what's hard is dealing with consequences
[29:02] of
[29:03] lustful sin and addiction and other
[29:05] addictions that's what's hard that's
[29:07] what's really hard but this is hard to
[29:08] get what i want because of the
[29:10] protections over this girl that's what
[29:11] amnon thought so i did a little research
[29:14] and i'm going to say it real quickly now
[29:15] because i only gave myself 20 minutes
[29:17] but i'm going to say it quickly i did a
[29:19] little research so just to break this
[29:20] down there was a word a law
[29:24] in
[29:24] from moses law because here they're in
[29:26] time the ammon and david or the time of
[29:28] amnon and david there was a law in the
[29:30] law of moses of course that was against
[29:32] fornication and adultery so of course
[29:35] he's he's overriding the laws right they
[29:37] say uh do not you know she you can't
[29:39] have her until you marry her so am in
[29:41] his mind even though he grew up hearing
[29:43] the ten commandments he's overriding all
[29:45] of it that law doesn't matter anymore
[29:47] anna knew that word and there were
[29:49] several other places
[29:51] and his mind was ready to ditch all of
[29:53] those quotes of the prophet
[29:58] his mind come to a place that he's ready
[30:00] to ditch all of those quotes of the
[30:02] prophet to get what he wants
[30:06] but the law of moses
[30:09] that said no fornication before marriage
[30:12] but there really doesn't wasn't anything
[30:14] specific about
[30:16] being alone with a person in other words
[30:18] here's the point i want to make the law
[30:20] said don't commit for creation don't
[30:21] commit adultery
[30:23] but there really is wasn't too many
[30:25] specifics in the law of moses
[30:28] to protect you
[30:31] from setting yourself up
[30:33] for a
[30:34] fornication
[30:36] there wasn't anything in there or
[30:38] setting yourself up for adultery
[30:41] so as time moved and i don't know when
[30:42] they did it but they say the high court
[30:44] of david as time moved on these scene
[30:46] conditions happened they realized we've
[30:48] got to have some more laws here we got
[30:49] to have something else
[30:51] it's not an adding to the commandments
[30:53] but it's advancing and and
[30:55] uh um amplifying
[30:57] what the ten commandments say because we
[31:00] have situations that could happen and
[31:02] the first one they dealt with is that
[31:03] they made a law uh the high quarter of
[31:06] david and all them made a law
[31:08] that was an expansion or a a
[31:12] amplification
[31:13] they made a law
[31:15] that was called
[31:16] that addressed yakud in the hebrew it's
[31:19] yokud and yakud means uh seclusion it's
[31:23] to be alone
[31:24] so this was a law against yokud for
[31:27] married women and for married men in
[31:29] other words they said we know we're not
[31:31] supposed to commit adultery but if a
[31:32] married man a married woman they're not
[31:34] married to one another if they're put in
[31:35] a room and they're locked in there you
[31:37] have the potential of something
[31:38] happening so we're going to make a law
[31:40] no married woman or no man should ever
[31:43] be alone in a room together with the
[31:46] door locked
[31:48] it was in the hebrew
[31:50] law
[31:52] praise the lord
[31:54] i'm going to tell you a few things in
[31:56] the next five minutes
[32:00] that make me feel so joyful
[32:03] because through the years as a father
[32:05] and working together with brother berry
[32:07] coffee and young people through the
[32:09] years you're looking for things because
[32:11] you realize the present modern
[32:13] conditions there's a lot of situations
[32:15] that happen that you could take a
[32:17] scripture but you want to articulate
[32:19] plainly what to do with that scripture
[32:22] in conditions of guys and girls being
[32:24] alone
[32:26] because there's one thing to say don't
[32:28] do that it's another thing to say if you
[32:30] do this you're setting yourself up to do
[32:33] the wrong thing so let's put some
[32:35] protections in place and we have been
[32:37] made fun of even by some preachers we've
[32:39] been mocked it's too strict young people
[32:41] say it's too strict it's crazy you're
[32:43] making up your own thing but here we
[32:45] have men of god working in the high
[32:48] court saying we know what the law says
[32:50] we're holding that but in the mind of
[32:51] god we're going to set some protections
[32:53] in
[32:54] place so that you'll be protected if
[32:57] you'll follow the protections you'll
[32:58] keep yourself being tempted
[33:06] so there's nothing specific about a
[33:08] single guy and a singer girl being alone
[33:11] just the married couple well here's
[33:13] here's how it goes and deuteronomy 13 7
[33:16] is where they go back to the mosaic law
[33:18] or the law they take something according
[33:20] to the rabbis that was said what was
[33:22] said in the torah in deuteronomy 13 7
[33:24] you can read it what was said in there
[33:26] was expanded upon a law called yakud
[33:29] which was a law that prohibited being
[33:30] alone together in jewish law the laws of
[33:32] yakud
[33:34] seclusion
[33:35] prohibits seclusion in a locked private
[33:38] area of a man and woman not permitted
[33:39] sexual intercourse with one another
[33:42] such seclusion is prohibited out of the
[33:44] fear that sexual intercourse or other
[33:46] lesser lesser acts may occur
[33:49] sexual intercourse or lesser acts may
[33:51] occur if you're in a room alone together
[33:55] we're talking
[33:56] to for we're talking like 4 000 years
[33:59] ago here friends
[34:01] a person who is present in order to
[34:03] prevent yakud is called a shomer a
[34:05] person who's present you gotta have a
[34:07] person present
[34:09] a person who's present in order to
[34:10] prevent yakud is called a shomer
[34:13] we call them a
[34:16] yes you could call it chaperone
[34:19] the laws of yukuda are typically
[34:21] followed in strict orthodox judaism
[34:24] the term yokud also refers to a ritual
[34:27] during a jewish wedding in which the
[34:28] newly married couple spends a period of
[34:30] secluded in a room by themselves after
[34:32] their wedding
[34:33] in early historical periods as early as
[34:35] the tomonic era the marriage would be
[34:38] consummated at this time but that
[34:39] practice is no longer current so in
[34:41] jewish weddings some of them even till
[34:43] today they leave the ceremony and the
[34:45] first thing they do is go to a private
[34:47] room together it's the first time
[34:48] they've been that private their entire
[34:50] courtship in a private room together and
[34:53] these days they'll talk they'll
[34:55] kiss i don't know what they do they
[34:57] they're allowed to do everything now
[34:59] so here they are and they're allowed so
[35:01] that's when that's that that's that word
[35:04] uh yakud applies to weddings as well but
[35:07] it came from something that you a law
[35:10] that you couldn't be alone together and
[35:11] then back in hebrew time the weddings
[35:13] that little moment after the wedding
[35:15] that's where it actually consummated the
[35:17] uh the marriage is in that that room
[35:20] just after the ceremony
[35:22] they don't do that today
[35:24] the laws of you
[35:25] the the term you could also remember
[35:27] okay i got that the talmud also claims
[35:28] that after the rape of tamar listen to
[35:30] this now
[35:31] the tomal claims that after the rape of
[35:34] tamar daughter of david when she was
[35:36] left alone with her half-brother amnon
[35:38] david and his high court extended this
[35:41] prohibition to unmarried girls as well
[35:45] so it wasn't there
[35:47] but they put it in as a protection for
[35:50] unmarried girls
[35:52] praise the lord
[35:56] later in the times of shamaya and hill
[35:58] and elder the pro the prohibition was
[36:00] extended to include non-jewish women
[36:04] these rules are discussed in the tumult
[36:06] so as time went on and you could you can
[36:08] go read it yourself this law kept
[36:10] expanding to now unbelieving woman being
[36:13] with jews any woman that wasn't your
[36:15] wife now protecting the young people
[36:18] then it expanded into
[36:20] public areas that you were alone then it
[36:22] expanded into your children
[36:24] and they had certain ages that your
[36:26] children children couldn't spend the
[36:27] night even even with another child their
[36:30] age that that rule extended into that to
[36:34] protect them from something happening
[36:36] molestation or something
[36:38] it kept expanding to deal with oh lord
[36:41] we didn't know this was going to happen
[36:42] so now the law was expanded
[36:45] for what for protection
[36:50] tell your friends we ought to be
[36:51] thankful
[36:52] for the message of the last days and not
[36:55] resist what my god has put in place for
[36:59] us
[37:03] oh boy i'm going to have to continue
[37:05] next sunday
[37:09] i might have to continue next sunday
[37:14] praise the lord
[37:16] god is good amen
[37:20] i'm just going to skip to the end here
[37:21] and we'll come back up with this
[37:25] again
[37:28] it's just a great joy to see that in the
[37:31] scripture
[37:32] because
[37:34] i've been known as very strict when it
[37:37] comes to young people being alone
[37:39] together
[37:41] even my own kids sometimes say it's it's
[37:42] overly strict dad you know
[37:45] we're not doing nothing
[37:46] i know
[37:48] don't you trust me dad and i say yeah i
[37:51] don't trust the devil i trust you i
[37:52] don't trust the devil
[37:54] and i don't trust the flesh
[37:57] dad used to tell us that i don't care
[37:59] how much holy ghost you got you put
[38:00] yourself in the wrong situation the
[38:02] flesh is going to kick in
[38:05] some preachers don't believe it that way
[38:06] but
[38:08] you put yourself in situations
[38:11] something is strict and all these things
[38:13] and then you have this pop-up where
[38:14] they're the david's court and by the way
[38:17] in david's court the prophet nathan was
[38:19] there in his court too
[38:21] praise the lord
[38:22] so it wasn't just men making their own
[38:24] decisions they had the influence of a
[38:26] god called prophet there to make the
[38:28] decisions to say listen here's some
[38:30] boundaries now we got to put in place to
[38:33] protect our children
[38:35] i'd be leery who your children spend the
[38:36] night with
[38:38] in the times we live in
[38:40] you better be watching over it
[38:44] so all these things come out and
[38:46] i remember years ago
[38:49] i always challenge the young men
[38:52] to
[38:53] don't be afraid of the daddy if you want
[38:55] to go
[38:56] ask date a girl whatever don't be afraid
[38:58] of them and don't be afraid of his
[38:59] questions i challenge daddy's give him a
[39:01] few test questions see how he relates
[39:03] you know test him a little bit some guys
[39:06] back off from that but you shouldn't be
[39:07] afraid
[39:08] if you like the girl
[39:11] as and i talk about just give them a few
[39:13] tests you know you
[39:14] tell me your experience with the lord
[39:16] tell me this you know what if they can
[39:18] talk about it confidently praise the
[39:19] lord you know but if they back off from
[39:21] that then then the daddy's got to make
[39:23] this how many believe the daddies make
[39:24] the decision with the daughter
[39:29] amen
[39:31] there's been something else floating
[39:32] around here that you know the parents
[39:34] are not involved and they do their own
[39:35] thing that's not what we teach here we
[39:37] respect the parents that are involved
[39:39] they don't make the final decision but
[39:41] they weigh in pretty heavy
[39:42] both sides
[39:45] amen
[39:47] well i was elaborating on a daddy
[39:48] challenge and the
[39:50] the
[39:51] potential son-in-law there that young
[39:53] guy you know and one day i was reading
[39:55] where caleb he's an old guy and he just
[39:57] raises up caleb in the bible
[40:00] and he come through all this and he says
[40:02] i just want to say something
[40:03] i get this mountain over here i get this
[40:06] mountain any of you young guys that can
[40:08] take that mountain and conquer it you
[40:10] can have my daughter
[40:12] i said praise the lord there's a daddy
[40:15] right there talk about a challenge to
[40:17] the young man
[40:19] that's the way it should be amen
[40:22] god's put some principles in place and
[40:25] when we start removing those
[40:27] it gets a little sketchy
[40:34] all right you know what
[40:37] i think i'm losing some of you
[40:48] so i'm going to end it by this
[40:54] this this is going to represent
[40:57] as i close today
[40:59] this is going to represent
[41:01] the boundaries that i've been talking
[41:03] about that have been sent by god
[41:05] the protections the
[41:08] the laws
[41:10] the principles
[41:12] in the old testament there's statues
[41:13] there's principles there's laws there
[41:15] are
[41:16] four or five things mentioned there
[41:18] so this represents this this morning and
[41:20] so if we look at this as god's
[41:22] principles it's got a pointy head on it
[41:26] and if you leave it in this condition
[41:27] you only see it this way and somebody's
[41:29] bringing this up to you
[41:31] okay
[41:32] this is the way you're going to look at
[41:33] it
[41:34] he keeps probing and pointing at me like
[41:36] that by that thing god's friend he keeps
[41:38] nabbing at me he keeps talking about
[41:40] he's a pastor that talks about what i
[41:42] can't wear what i can wear
[41:51] i could do it harder you know
[41:54] this is god's principles it's god's law
[41:57] so that's why a lot of people start to
[41:59] look at it you're just being poked all
[42:01] the time and he's always saying
[42:02] something about it and he's always and
[42:04] his ministry has always been that way
[42:07] poked and then but if if you just say
[42:10] lord let me change my attitude
[42:13] towards these principles
[42:15] let me change my attitude
[42:17] i want you to read psalms 119 besides
[42:20] listening to flashing red light it was
[42:21] coming i want you to read the whole
[42:22] chapter psalms 119. i don't have time to
[42:24] read it it's so wonderful because it's a
[42:26] man it's not amnon it's a it's david
[42:28] who's allowed his mind to be
[42:30] so changed
[42:32] that his attitude towards the statues
[42:34] towards the laws
[42:36] is completely positive lord
[42:38] how shall a young man cleanse his way
[42:41] by adhering to obeying your principles
[42:43] and your boundaries
[42:45] read the whole chapter he embraces all
[42:47] of them said lord i've made mistakes
[42:49] i've fallen but i'm back
[42:52] i'm paraphrasing
[42:53] and i am determined to obey and follow
[42:56] your principles
[42:58] why because
[43:00] he didn't send him to be mean to us or
[43:02] to poke us
[43:04] and if we change our attitude the same
[43:06] principles
[43:09] change
[43:15] that wasn't supposed to happen sister
[43:17] laura
[43:26] the same principles
[43:29] can be strange
[43:33] you have to edit that part out i'm going
[43:34] to look like an idiot
[43:36] absolute idiot
[43:39] the same
[43:42] quit laughing at me
[43:44] the same principles that were poking us
[43:47] maybe all your years in the message as a
[43:48] young child
[43:50] as soon as you change your attitude
[43:51] about it you'll see them all together
[43:53] different
[43:56] [Applause]
[43:58] yep
[44:01] the same quotes
[44:03] the same quotes
[44:05] that you buck up against be careful
[44:09] could it be god given an awesome
[44:12] protection from the rains from the winds
[44:15] supposed to rain today maybe that's why
[44:16] i got this listen you say i don't need
[44:18] that i'll run here well you know if you
[44:20] do go without it
[44:22] you're going to be in some storms
[44:24] you're going to get wet
[44:26] you might even get pneumonia
[44:29] because something has been given to you
[44:30] for the protection of god amen
[44:34] we need to honor and look at him the
[44:36] right way with the right attitude right
[44:38] down from the seven seals to high heels
[44:41] don't dump any of it out
[44:45] it's all said for a reason thank you
[44:53] [Applause]
[44:55] mom i stole that out of your car the
[44:56] other day i'm giving it back to you
[44:59] i'm sorry i'm sorry
[45:02] i'm sorry
[45:05] i don't have time to finish this so
[45:07] let's stand
[45:10] i i'd say i've probably said enough for
[45:13] you to chew on today
[45:15] probably said
[45:16] enough
[45:18] and i don't always say it like a
[45:20] polished preacher i know that i know i'm
[45:22] not the best polished preacher in the
[45:23] message i don't really want to be but i
[45:24] know i'm not that
[45:27] but i hope you see my heart we're all
[45:29] trying to serve the lord here
[45:32] and you're all at different stages
[45:34] okay
[45:35] the only thing i ask for is be careful
[45:38] what thoughts you put in your mind and
[45:39] where it comes from that's all i'm
[45:41] asking today
[45:43] if you're feeding too much of that
[45:44] you're going to change in your mind
[45:46] feed on the word of god and then you'll
[45:48] know for yourself
[45:51] where this
[45:52] comes from
[45:57] josh mcdowell is the one that referred
[45:59] to this umbrella and he said it's always
[46:01] an act of love on god's part
[46:03] it's always
[46:05] an act of love on god's part to protect
[46:07] us
[46:08] and provide for us
[46:10] but when through an act of disobedience
[46:12] by a decision of our own we ignore god's
[46:15] precepts we remove ourselves from the
[46:17] very protection and provision of those
[46:20] pre-precepts
[46:22] there's power that comes from god's word
[46:24] there's power protection that comes from
[46:26] his precepts it's not just laws but when
[46:29] we obey him power comes with it to watch
[46:32] over our lives let me just say this
[46:34] let's quit messing with the boundaries
[46:37] let's quit messing with the mind let's
[46:39] quit questioning them you want to spend
[46:40] your whole life just questioning them
[46:42] you want to know more why where they
[46:44] come from praise the lord research it
[46:45] but let's stop messing with them
[46:48] and letting satan mess with our minds
[46:51] god give us a sound mind a clear mind
[46:54] god give us more of a love for his
[46:55] precepts and his word
[46:58] i give my mind brother kenny can you
[47:00] close your eyes we'll pray
[47:01] just lift your hand
[47:04] brother paul
[47:07] i'll be praying about the things that
[47:09] you've said today i'll take them to my
[47:10] heart
[47:11] i pray you do that
[47:16] and i want to give my mind it doesn't
[47:17] belong to the enemy it doesn't belong to
[47:19] someone else a friend it belongs to the
[47:21] lord and i really want to give it more
[47:23] and more to the lord
[47:25] [Music]
[47:27] you know i'd rather have you as a pastor
[47:29] rather
[47:30] more than shouting and dancing and all
[47:33] that i'd rather have you just repenting
[47:35] and taking this word into your heart
[47:37] pondering it today
[47:40] just saying lord i need you
[47:43] i need an altar in my heart
[47:45] i need to change lord
[47:49] heavenly father we do close this service
[47:51] today lord but
[47:53] [Music]
[47:54] i pray that you will
[47:55] [Music]
[47:57] you do the work lord that we can't do
[48:00] let your word go forth and let it bring
[48:02] forth fruits that it brings forth power
[48:06] in the people's lives
[48:09] and you said of the pentecostals lord
[48:11] they
[48:12] they could shout they could dance they
[48:13] could blow it out the whistle
[48:16] but if they took all that power and put
[48:18] it into an everyday life it'd be a
[48:20] wonderful thing
[48:21] an everyday godly sanctified life
[48:25] is such a power against the enemy that's
[48:28] the thing he can't deal with
[48:30] so i pray he'll bless the people in that
[48:32] send us a revival in our hearts wash
[48:34] away all the trash and things
[48:36] may our minds be totally
[48:38] dedicated to you in our hearts
[48:42] people got to make some decisions lord i
[48:44] pray that your word has influenced their
[48:46] decisions today to make change in jesus
[48:49] name
[48:50] amen
[48:52] i give my mind
[48:56] completely to you
[49:04] [Music]
[49:13] you
