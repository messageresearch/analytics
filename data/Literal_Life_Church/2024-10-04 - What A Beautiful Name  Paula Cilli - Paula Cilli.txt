What A Beautiful Name

You were the Word at the beginning
One with God the Lord Most High
Your hidden glory in creation
Now, revealed in You our Christ

What a beautiful Name it is, what a beautiful Name it is
The Name of Jesus Christ, my King
What a beautiful Name it is, nothing compares to this
What a beautiful Name it is, the Name of Jesus

You didn't want Heaven without us
So Jesus, You brought Heaven down
My sin was great, Your love was greater
What could separate us now?

What a wonderful Name it is, what a wonderful Name it is
The Name of Jesus Christ, my King
What a wonderful Name it is, nothing compares to this
What a wonderful Name it is, the Name of Jesus
What a wonderful Name it is, the Name of Jesus

Death could not hold You, the veil tore before You
You silenced the boast of sin and grave
The Heavens are roaring, the praise of Your glory
For You are raised to life again

You have no rival, You have no equal
Now and forever, God, You reign
Yours is the Kingdom, Yours is the Glory
Yours is the Name above all names

Written by Ben Fielding and Brooke Ligertwood
