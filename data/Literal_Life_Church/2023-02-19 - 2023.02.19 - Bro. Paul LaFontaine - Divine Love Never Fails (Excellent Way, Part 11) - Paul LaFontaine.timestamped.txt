[0:00] Corinthians chapter 13
[0:02] and we'll continue with some scriptures
[0:05] here
[0:13] First Corinthians 13.
[0:17] and verse 8 through 10.
[0:20] First Corinthians 13 8 through 10.
[0:24] amen if we're under expectation when we
[0:27] come to church
[0:29] to let God do whatever he wants to do
[0:32] instead of the mindset it'll just be
[0:35] church as normal
[0:36] if we hinder greater expectations say
[0:38] God you come and do what you want to do
[0:40] then we'll give it time and we won't be
[0:42] thinking about what we have to do at
[0:45] home and our bills do tomorrow and our
[0:47] businesses and and what we have to plan
[0:50] for this week I noticed some even you
[0:53] know in church still on their phones and
[0:55] so if you can't give God enough time
[0:58] just to minister to you undistracted
[1:01] completely undistracted then you really
[1:03] need to pray about that because
[1:05] something's take a hold of you that's
[1:07] more important than the word of God
[1:10] amen so let's let the Lord do what he
[1:12] wants to do in our lives let's be free
[1:14] to just be open to that First
[1:16] Corinthians 13 and verse 8 charity
[1:19] Divine love never faileth but whether
[1:23] there be prophecies they shall fail
[1:25] whether there be tongues they shall
[1:28] cease whether they be knowledge it shall
[1:31] vanish away so Paul here and this is
[1:33] where my subject is from in First
[1:35] Corinthians 8 and the first three words
[1:37] there charity never faileth prophecies
[1:40] they'll fail tongues they shall cease
[1:42] whether there be knowledge it shall
[1:44] vanish Away Paul here is actually
[1:46] bringing an eternal the Eternal part of
[1:49] what divine love is that if it never
[1:51] fails then it's Eternal it's always been
[1:54] there it'll always be there there are
[1:57] some temporal things in the church like
[1:59] prophecies and like tongues that in the
[2:02] meaning of this means that they will
[2:04] fade away someday
[2:06] they will fade away prophecies will
[2:08] cease prophecies will fail knowledge
[2:11] shall vanish away so there are things
[2:13] even in the church that will vanish and
[2:15] fade away someday there are things that
[2:18] we won't need someday
[2:20] so there are things that will fade away
[2:22] but then there are things that are
[2:25] Eternal and things that will never fail
[2:27] and will never fade away and divine love
[2:29] is one of those things it will never
[2:31] ever fade away
[2:33] it'll never fail you it'll never fail
[2:36] because we know God can't fail
[2:39] God can't fail and so Paul's bringing in
[2:42] this eternal part that it can't fail
[2:44] other things will fail they'll vanish
[2:46] away but charity never faileth verse 9
[2:50] for we know in part and we prophesy in
[2:53] part but when that which is perfect is
[2:55] come then that which is in part shall be
[2:59] done away so it shows what we're seeking
[3:02] for what we're looking after is not just
[3:04] to emphasize something that's temporal
[3:06] but to have our eyes not just towards
[3:09] something that surface or temporal but
[3:11] to have our eyes on the Unseen and that
[3:14] which is eternal right there was another
[3:17] scripture here I wrote down I don't have
[3:18] it in my notes but I wrote it down on a
[3:21] piece of paper if you would go with me
[3:22] to Second Corinthians chapter four I
[3:24] want to add a scripture in in relation
[3:27] to the Eternal and how we're to live
[3:29] looking at the Eternal second
[3:31] Corinthians 4 I believe it is
[3:34] and it says here second Corinthians 4
[3:37] verse 16. yes for which cause we faint
[3:41] not
[3:42] but though our outward man perished yet
[3:47] the inward man is renewed day by day so
[3:50] this is a cycle that's happening that
[3:52] our outward man is perishing but our
[3:54] inward man is being renewed day by day
[3:57] for our light Affliction which is but
[4:00] for a moment I I think it's interesting
[4:02] how Paul takes our life in the trials of
[4:04] it and all the suffering and calls it a
[4:07] light affliction
[4:09] wow I want to look at my life like that
[4:13] our light Affliction in other words our
[4:15] life with all of its pain with all of
[4:17] its suffering with all the hurts and all
[4:19] the things people did wrong to us he's
[4:21] calling it when when you're looking at
[4:23] in light of Eternity it's just a light
[4:26] affliction
[4:28] but isn't it amazing how big we make our
[4:31] afflictions
[4:32] and we make it bigger than God sometimes
[4:35] Paul says but our light Affliction is
[4:39] but for a moment it's working for us a
[4:42] far more exceeding and eternal weight of
[4:46] Glory
[4:47] while we look not at the things which
[4:50] are seen But at the things which are not
[4:53] seen for the things which are seen
[4:55] they're temporal but the things which
[4:58] are not seen are eternal
[5:01] so he's encouraging a Christian that
[5:03] that we cannot live with our eyes always
[5:06] on the temporal things
[5:09] I remember brother Steve Johnson used to
[5:11] be assistant with me here and passed
[5:13] away a cancer but I remember him saying
[5:15] one time in a service he says is it
[5:17] going to matter 10 years from now you're
[5:19] making this thing such a huge thing and
[5:21] it's a temple thing but how much is it
[5:23] going to matter to you in 10 years from
[5:24] now
[5:25] and that's the way we look at not just
[5:27] here and years how those are things that
[5:30] we look at in life and all the things
[5:31] that were done wrong how does it look
[5:33] like in light of Eternity we're not
[5:35] supposed to have our eyes consumed and
[5:38] our lives consumed with the temporal
[5:40] things that's happening
[5:41] but we're having to look towards the
[5:43] Unseen for the things that are that are
[5:46] here that we see they're temporal but
[5:49] the things that are unseen that's
[5:52] eternal
[5:53] father bless your word today as I seek
[5:56] to yield to you and I asked you Lord you
[5:59] do whatever you want to do in this
[6:00] service today may I yield to you so that
[6:03] your Holy Spirit can come and baptize us
[6:06] again Lord and fill us again we commit
[6:09] the service to you in Jesus name amen
[6:11] God bless you may be seated
[6:14] and out of all the dimensions the many
[6:16] dimensions and vastness that we have
[6:18] covered about Divine love this one here
[6:21] today is not to be overlooked I want to
[6:24] take a look at it I want to title this
[6:26] Divine Love Never Fails
[6:28] this part of divine love should not be
[6:30] overlooked we have appreciated all the
[6:33] different dimensions of looking at
[6:35] Divine love and its characteristics but
[6:37] this one is not to be overlooked and I
[6:40] felt to Finish First Corinthians 13 and
[6:43] to finish the scriptures and what and
[6:45] ask what is the rest of First
[6:47] Corinthians 13 saying what does the rest
[6:49] of it say and this window that we've
[6:52] been calling it a window into the more
[6:55] excellent way he says there's a more
[6:57] excellent way than he gives the
[6:58] characteristics of that way it's divine
[7:00] love it's God's love it's it's it's
[7:03] agape love and then he explores in this
[7:06] little window in between this
[7:08] Corinthians which is a book of
[7:09] Correction the Corinthians is you could
[7:12] call it a book of Correction because
[7:13] Paul basically is setting things in
[7:15] order in the church that got out of
[7:17] order and so in the midst of all this
[7:19] correction and correcting the gifts and
[7:21] all these other things and saying you
[7:22] know he has this excellent way just
[7:24] sandwiched right in the middle and it's
[7:26] a window to the more excellent way to
[7:28] show us what it is this chapter stands
[7:32] separate to itself and it is looking at
[7:34] when a Christian breaks beyond the
[7:37] surface of feeling or temporal
[7:39] manifestations even of the spirit or
[7:42] temporal surges of Faith or Temple
[7:45] surges of Hope to bring the Christian
[7:48] beyond the surface to adapt to a depth
[7:52] of stability and Power
[7:56] how many this mornings do I want to
[7:57] raise my hand is that I want to grow to
[8:00] more stability and Power in my life and
[8:03] not stay a surface Christian
[8:05] this is what Paul's trying to do there's
[8:07] a more excellent way there's
[8:09] manifestations of the spirit there's
[8:10] prophecies there's giving to the poor
[8:12] there's a there's an understanding all
[8:15] the Mysteries he takes all of that but
[8:17] he says that's all these things are all
[8:19] temporal if you get knowledge of
[8:20] something it's all temporal but there's
[8:22] something Eternal in here and there's
[8:24] something beyond the surface of living
[8:26] every day by surface feeling let me just
[8:29] say that right away Christians cannot
[8:31] live by sight they must live by faith
[8:33] and Christians cannot live off of their
[8:36] feelings
[8:39] Christians cannot live by their feelings
[8:43] you cannot judge your day and judge your
[8:46] Christian walk and judge your fellowship
[8:47] with God based upon how you feel because
[8:50] from one day to the next you will feel
[8:52] very different one day you'll feel good
[8:55] one day you'll feel saved the next day
[8:57] you won't feel saved
[9:00] and those days when you don't feel saved
[9:03] Satan likes those days and he
[9:05] capitalizes it and he's in your ear on
[9:08] your shoulder saying that's right not
[9:10] only do you not feel saved I wonder if
[9:12] you're even saved at all
[9:15] boy he's a quite an enemy isn't he
[9:19] so hey we can't live off of our feelings
[9:22] we can't live with our feelings as the
[9:25] dominant king that's setting in our
[9:27] heart that's dictating our life every
[9:29] day that this is how I feel this is how
[9:32] and a lot of times people will conclude
[9:34] on matters conclude a lifelong confusion
[9:37] conclusion based upon their feelings of
[9:40] what happened
[9:43] based upon lack of facts and based upon
[9:46] will I feel this way so it must be true
[9:48] we can't do that we can't live on
[9:50] feelings we have to live deeper than
[9:52] that and this is a realm into which we
[9:54] are coming to live in a way that perfect
[9:58] Faith which worketh by perfect love
[10:00] Masters every circumstance it says
[10:03] Deeper Life of stability and Power in
[10:06] the Christian's Life by the Holy Ghost
[10:08] it's a realm of mastering every
[10:11] circumstance that comes our way
[10:14] so this characteristics of Love Never
[10:17] Love Never failing this characteristic
[10:19] should not be overlooked that love never
[10:22] fails Paul's saying we enjoy faith we
[10:26] enjoy prophecies and I want to just get
[10:28] this across it doesn't mean that we
[10:29] eliminate what he's saying here with
[10:31] that it'll it'll fail prophecies will
[10:33] fail these things will cease knowledge
[10:35] will fade away it doesn't mean we those
[10:37] things stop happening as a manifestation
[10:40] of the spirit but what it means is they
[10:42] will fade away they are tempro
[10:48] I didn't intend to say this but I I
[10:50] years ago the Lord showed me that there
[10:53] are things are you listening there are
[10:55] things that God gave us in the Bible as
[10:58] as as rules and guidelines and
[11:01] protections and boundaries that we will
[11:05] not need when we get on the other side
[11:10] can you say Amen
[11:12] and when you start breaking down
[11:14] teaching what T we teach about young
[11:16] people and the boundaries and not
[11:18] touching one another before marriage and
[11:20] all these other things these this is all
[11:22] in the scripture and it's what God gave
[11:24] us to live in this life of sexual
[11:26] temptation of our flesh taking over he
[11:30] gives us the Holy Ghost but he gives us
[11:31] guidelines from the Old Testament to the
[11:34] new and we can't dump those things out
[11:36] we need them for this life
[11:38] you can't mock or ignore the preachers
[11:42] that are preaching God's guidelines for
[11:44] sexual temptation
[11:46] I wouldn't make an enemy of the pastor
[11:49] who's correcting your young people and
[11:52] giving them guidelines from the
[11:53] scripture to live by that's not your
[11:55] enemy that's your friend
[12:00] I'd be careful of setting their minds
[12:02] against that that that's the problem the
[12:04] church is the problem the preacher is
[12:06] the problem not the preacher that's
[12:07] bringing out the boundaries of how we
[12:09] live in this age
[12:12] but we used to say with that there's
[12:15] some things in here he gave us for this
[12:17] life and we honor that but we won't need
[12:19] it for the other life
[12:20] we won't need the scriptures for sexual
[12:22] Temptation in the other because there
[12:24] won't be any demons there there won't be
[12:25] any lust there can you say Amen there
[12:28] won't be any of that there it'll be gone
[12:29] there won't be death no devil there
[12:31] there won't be any accuser of the
[12:33] Brethren there won't be no sickness can
[12:35] you say Amen
[12:38] Hallelujah we won't need the scriptures
[12:40] to apply Faith to Divine Healing to
[12:42] believe God can heal the sick we won't
[12:44] need those scriptures anymore because
[12:45] we'll never get sick
[12:49] but do we need them now yes do we need
[12:52] the gifts of the Spirit now yes the
[12:54] gifts in the church keep the church
[12:55] clean I'm one of those gifts
[13:00] hello
[13:02] I'm one of the gifts that God gave you
[13:04] to help keep your life clean
[13:10] you didn't know I was that but I'm
[13:12] introducing myself to you God bless you
[13:14] good to meet you I'm not just the fat
[13:16] preacher that's in there every Sunday up
[13:18] in the pulpit in front of you but God
[13:20] has given me a gift
[13:22] he gave some to the church for the
[13:25] perfecting of the church for the work of
[13:27] the ministry for the edifying and
[13:29] building up of the body I'm not here to
[13:31] hurt your family I'm here to help your
[13:33] family
[13:37] don't make me the enemy to your children
[13:41] don't make me the the problem in your
[13:44] life don't make the message the problem
[13:45] you know I've been so in my vacation I
[13:48] did rest but I've been so grieved in my
[13:50] spirit just so incredibly grieved and I
[13:53] don't have all the answers but I'm I'm
[13:55] astounded at how the devil not people
[13:58] but the devil can take the very precious
[14:02] thing that God sent us through a prophet
[14:05] the very message of the last days and
[14:08] turn people and say the message is my
[14:11] problem
[14:13] and the men that are preaching that's
[14:15] really my problem in life
[14:17] what a lie of the enemy how tactful can
[14:21] the enemy be to take something so
[14:24] precious to our lives and turn it around
[14:26] to a cult and that's my problem and
[14:29] that's what that's my family's problems
[14:31] let me tell your brother and sister
[14:32] that's not your problem the problem is
[14:35] rebellion in our hearts they're not
[14:36] recognized that God has blessed us with
[14:40] the greatest message that's ever hit
[14:42] planet Earth
[14:45] and this church believes it all of it
[14:49] the church that you attend believes
[14:52] that God sent this
[14:55] from heaven in the last days you say
[14:57] well I'm here and I don't understand
[14:58] what you're saying there are there are
[15:01] literally hundreds of scriptures that
[15:03] talk about the last days
[15:06] but there's some specific ones who talk
[15:07] about a restorative Ministry to bring us
[15:11] back to Bible Faith to bring us back to
[15:14] Restoration of the church to bring us
[15:16] back to biblical truth
[15:18] it's over and over again in the
[15:20] scripture you need to know those
[15:22] scriptures
[15:23] because we don't have a church that's
[15:24] preaching something from
[15:27] 100 years ago
[15:29] preaching the message of the last days
[15:32] my my my encouragement to you in love
[15:35] don't make the message
[15:38] the pro your problem
[15:46] praise the Lord
[15:48] so Paul says we enjoy faith we enjoy
[15:51] prophecies we enjoy knowledge especially
[15:53] when it's from the Lord but it will only
[15:55] have a season to it it will fade it will
[15:57] have a temporal help for you you know
[15:59] how many know that you can be prayed for
[16:01] and completely healed by the atonement
[16:03] but you're going to get sick again
[16:05] sometimes
[16:07] so your healing sometimes is temporal
[16:09] now sometimes somebody's healed that's
[16:11] it they're prayed for they don't have
[16:12] that problem again they don't have that
[16:14] eye problem again it's over can you say
[16:16] Amen
[16:17] but but if we live in these bodies we're
[16:19] going to get sick with something else
[16:21] again so our healing can be temporal
[16:24] and and so because of that we it's a
[16:27] season it will fade it has a temple help
[16:30] for us but you see we can't put all of
[16:32] our eggs in one basket we can't live
[16:34] solely upon knowledge why it'll fade
[16:36] someday we can't rest our Eternal
[16:39] destination on temporal things they will
[16:41] fade they will have certain limitations
[16:43] to it and to the Corinthians you can't
[16:46] Paul says you can't put an emphasis on
[16:49] these things too much because they are
[16:51] temporal in other words you can't have
[16:53] all your eggs in one basket you can't
[16:55] take a prophecy or you can't take
[16:57] knowledge and put all your eggs in one
[17:00] basket and say that's it that is my that
[17:02] I arrest my eternal destination upon the
[17:05] knowledge that I have you can't do that
[17:07] because it's temporal it will fade away
[17:10] amen but perfect love never fades never
[17:16] fails it's constant it never walks away
[17:20] God's perfect love for you will never
[17:23] ever walk away
[17:27] when you fail when you fail his love
[17:31] will not fail
[17:33] how many raise your hands that I failed
[17:35] before
[17:36] but his love don't fail you it's going
[17:39] to keep trying it's going to keep loving
[17:40] you it's going to keep drawing you and
[17:42] there'll always be something if you're a
[17:44] daughter of God or Son of God there's
[17:45] always something down there you got all
[17:47] this stuff on the outside all the guilt
[17:49] and the shame that goes with it all the
[17:51] things you've done wrong that's all the
[17:52] stuff but down here if something's
[17:54] churning that's because God's still
[17:55] dealing with you and that means his love
[17:58] never fails I don't care what you've
[17:59] done his lover never fails it never
[18:02] gives up
[18:05] turn around
[18:07] it's constant it never walks away why it
[18:10] was because his love is not wavering by
[18:14] emotions by Feelings by Life Changes by
[18:18] people his love doesn't change with
[18:20] people
[18:21] because people change
[18:24] his love doesn't is not wavered and
[18:26] moved and changed by emotions or
[18:28] feelings or the stock market
[18:33] or losing a job or gaining a job or his
[18:37] love does not fail during those times
[18:39] his love is constant it's always there
[18:42] your job will fail life will fail
[18:45] husbands and wives will fail and make
[18:47] mistakes but his love never fails can I
[18:51] get an amen this morning
[18:54] and that's a lot of the reason why
[18:56] you're still coming
[18:57] because I know your lives and many of
[18:59] you been through some pretty rough
[19:01] circumstances
[19:02] why are you still here
[19:05] well you could say it's I'm supposed to
[19:07] be here
[19:09] I'll get preached on if I'm not here
[19:13] but if it's a desire and hunger of God
[19:18] you're here because his love never fails
[19:22] you fail and people fail and preachers
[19:25] fail
[19:26] but his love never fails
[19:29] maybe that's why you're here this
[19:31] morning
[19:32] and maybe that's why it should work off
[19:34] a hunger if people are hungry for more
[19:36] of God look at the Asbury Revival
[19:40] in the last 11 days
[19:43] when kids begin to hunger after God
[19:47] I'm tired of church I'm tired of
[19:49] formality I'm tired of no Spirit I'm
[19:52] tired something's craving and hungering
[19:54] for it and they begin to just stay and
[19:56] then at the end of the chapel service
[19:58] they just say we're not going anywhere I
[20:00] just I'm hungry for God and so now for
[20:02] 11 days they're in the same Chapel just
[20:05] praying for one another now listen
[20:06] listen I always like to see where
[20:08] something goes because you see a lot of
[20:10] those things are temporal they only last
[20:13] so long
[20:14] but praise God that there's a hunger in
[20:17] young people for more of God praise God
[20:19] that they say I don't have to go back to
[20:21] the class I'm going to stay right here
[20:22] till I get something I'm going to stay
[20:24] at this altar until I get something and
[20:26] when people are that hungry God has to
[20:29] respond and pour out his spirit
[20:33] because he promised he that hungers and
[20:36] thirst after righteousness shall be
[20:37] filled God's going to keep his promise
[20:39] he's not going to fail people that say I
[20:41] want more I'm tired of religion I'm
[20:44] tired of starching this I'm tired with a
[20:46] with a church with no Spirit I'm hungry
[20:49] for something and I don't even know what
[20:51] it is but I'm hungry for more of God and
[20:53] when you begin to hunger and come to
[20:55] church that way God has to respond
[21:03] you go ahead and read up on it it's
[21:05] happened several places around around
[21:08] the world and that's interesting people
[21:10] will get a ticket from Australia and New
[21:12] Zealand they hear something's going on
[21:14] they're going to fly there they're not
[21:15] going to let them in the chapel they
[21:16] have to stay outside because they won't
[21:18] they don't want anything out
[21:19] interrupting videos being taken all this
[21:21] stuff inside it they don't want to be
[21:22] interrupted but they'll come from around
[21:24] there because why they're hungry I want
[21:26] to come but don't forget it's not a
[21:28] location
[21:31] and in the Welsh Revival in England when
[21:34] that broke out people flew all the way
[21:36] from the United States and one guy came
[21:39] up to a policeman who was swinging his
[21:40] baton thing there as swinging a stick
[21:43] and they said he was whistling A Hymn to
[21:45] God and he says sir can you we come here
[21:48] all the way from the states for the
[21:49] Welsh Revival will can you tell us where
[21:51] it's at he said what are you talking
[21:53] about I am the Welsh Revival I'm right
[21:56] here
[21:59] foreign
[22:00] be to God it's not a location it's not
[22:04] an Asbury right now when you begin to
[22:07] seek God when you begin to get hungry
[22:09] for God when you come to church a
[22:11] different way
[22:14] not fill in your time clock and checking
[22:16] in clicks okay and when I'm in about an
[22:19] hour hour and a half preaching see
[22:21] people start looking at their watches
[22:22] their phones I got stuff to do I got
[22:24] this plan this afternoon where do you
[22:26] have to go
[22:27] excuse me for being in your face where
[22:30] do you have to go that's so important
[22:32] today
[22:33] what you need is an altar in your heart
[22:35] to say God I don't have enough hunger
[22:38] for you
[22:40] I have too much hunger for that I need
[22:42] more of a hunger for you
[22:45] and I'm serious about this I'm willing
[22:47] to to stay I'm willing to
[22:56] too much carnality
[22:58] there's too much starch it is this
[23:00] message is just a intellectual do's and
[23:02] don'ts to people just too much of it in
[23:04] families and lives and people are
[23:06] fearful and scared of it what we need is
[23:08] a Revival in our hearts you need to
[23:10] release yourself
[23:12] [Applause]
[23:14] years never seen you at the altar never
[23:16] seen you repent of any never seen you
[23:18] move by the services something's wrong
[23:20] with your heart there Comes A Time here
[23:22] to say I lay aside what I've heard
[23:24] before there comes a try and say God
[23:25] that this is it I just need more of you
[23:28] I need it to make it in a Rapture I need
[23:30] the Holy Ghost
[23:37] but tongues and and prophecies they'll
[23:40] have certain limitations but perfect
[23:42] love never fades it never fails it's
[23:45] constant it's not moved by feelings or
[23:47] the stock market or insurance policies
[23:51] or sickness
[23:53] life
[23:54] is that seasons change good and bad
[24:01] in the last year I've seen Veterans of
[24:04] the faith men some of them I was close
[24:07] to
[24:08] my heroes
[24:09] they die they pass away
[24:12] and they go on to their reward brother
[24:13] Gideon retief died of a heart attack
[24:15] just 52 years old just a few days ago on
[24:20] his way to church bang heart attack he's
[24:22] gone the church has doesn't have a
[24:24] pastor right now George Martin in South
[24:27] Africa passed away the last few days
[24:29] Harold hildebrat last year the one that
[24:33] was birthed under his ministry
[24:36] things end
[24:37] lives fade away even good lives loved
[24:41] ones will die
[24:44] even good things in life will pass away
[24:46] but his love is still here
[24:51] aren't you glad
[24:53] God takes people from us but he doesn't
[24:55] take himself from us his love is still
[24:57] here
[24:58] it'll never fail you
[25:02] people leave us
[25:04] people hurt us but his love stays with
[25:07] us
[25:10] oh I pray you can let your heart be
[25:12] softened this morning
[25:17] Paul's teaching the Corinthians who need
[25:18] they need correction they were
[25:20] sensationally driven they were feeling
[25:22] driven putting all things on sensation
[25:24] or prophecies or emotion you know the
[25:27] Corinthians had great services
[25:30] they had great Services
[25:32] Spirit-filled pouring out of the spirit
[25:34] tongues interpretation of tongues praise
[25:37] be to God from Pentecost those things
[25:39] would happen and even happened to have
[25:42] them happen today but you see now the
[25:45] Corinthians put their emphasis all on
[25:47] that and Paul could recognize it they
[25:48] didn't see it but Paul could see you're
[25:50] putting way too much emphasis on this
[25:52] and if you put it on it feels good it
[25:55] visibly feels like more signs are here
[25:57] and more things are happening it feels
[25:59] better it's a confirmation that God is
[26:01] with us the problem with that is when
[26:04] that is over
[26:06] when that feeling is gone how many can
[26:09] raise your hand and say I have felt the
[26:11] presence of the Lord
[26:12] anybody says no you can't feel it no
[26:14] yeah you can
[26:16] you might be feeling it today that that
[26:18] you feel don't be afraid of that don't
[26:20] be afraid of that
[26:22] it's him coming near us you never you
[26:25] can be afraid of a lot of things but you
[26:26] need don't need to be afraid of what you
[26:28] feel in your heart in the presence of
[26:30] the Lord
[26:31] and so now it's a confirmation God Is
[26:34] With Us problem is is that when it's
[26:35] over we start to wonder
[26:37] and this happens many times in revivals
[26:40] God dealt with that brother Rapp a few
[26:42] weeks ago he said that they had a prayer
[26:44] meeting the spirit of the Lord came in
[26:45] that basement Maya was just tremendous
[26:48] just a unique moving of the spirit and
[26:51] then the next prayer meeting that got
[26:52] together have the same man pray do the
[26:54] same things because they won't want to
[26:56] wanting to repeat what happened the
[26:58] Friday night before
[26:59] you can't do that
[27:02] it was it was good praise the Lord but
[27:04] what what's God want to do now
[27:08] what's God want to do in this service
[27:12] the problem is when it's all over
[27:14] sometimes uh people start to wonder well
[27:16] we didn't have a service like that so is
[27:18] God With Us Now what a terrible thing to
[27:21] say
[27:24] all things from God are good but some
[27:28] things are temporary
[27:30] can you say man
[27:32] and that feeling that I felt and I feel
[27:35] it this morning I love it but I can tell
[27:37] you that feeling isn't always there
[27:41] but there is something that's always
[27:44] there that I can't get away from
[27:48] it's the unfailing love of God that has
[27:51] never failed me never left me
[27:54] so I didn't feel the presence of God
[27:55] with you may not feel the presence of
[27:57] God but you have no scripture to say he
[27:59] left you his love can't leave you it
[28:01] can't fail you it can't stop it can't
[28:03] end
[28:05] now friends shouldn't we be interested
[28:07] in something in a world that's failed Us
[28:10] in people who have failed us even
[28:12] preachers have failed us isn't it isn't
[28:15] it time for us to latch onto with all of
[28:17] our hearts something that will never
[28:19] will fail us never will his love will
[28:23] never fail
[28:24] [Applause]
[28:29] it'll still be there
[28:31] no matter what we go through no matter
[28:33] what people have done no matter what our
[28:35] trials his love is constant
[28:38] it's still there
[28:40] it's still drawing your heart
[28:43] never gives up never fails never will
[28:45] fade away always will be there
[28:49] Hallelujah
[28:50] I've got some wonderful memories of
[28:53] feeling the presence of God in my life
[28:56] being on spiritual highs like never
[29:01] dreamed of I've got some wonderful
[29:03] memories of camp meetings sometimes in
[29:06] our own Services I'll tell you there's
[29:09] been times even our own Services I felt
[29:11] like shouting running the house and
[29:13] sometimes I ran the aisles but you see
[29:15] now I don't judge how close I am to the
[29:18] Lord by how fast I ran the aisles
[29:22] okay because I may have felt good I felt
[29:26] blessings I felt Liberty but when I get
[29:28] in my car for some reason when I get in
[29:31] my car the devil's in my car
[29:37] and I thought my dancing and shouting in
[29:40] running the aisles it was the end of the
[29:42] devil it wasn't the end of the devil
[29:45] he's there he's on my shoulder he's
[29:48] whispering in my ear he's distracting me
[29:50] to all the you know I'm gonna I'm called
[29:53] the devil you come out of me with
[29:55] service you'll be thinking of things of
[29:56] God and rejoicing and all of a sudden
[29:58] he's got you thinking about your
[29:59] business what you got to do Monday what
[30:02] you got to do Tuesday you better do this
[30:04] and all of a sudden pressure starts to
[30:05] come in a matter of 10 minutes the all
[30:08] the glory that you felt is without the
[30:10] window of the car
[30:13] was it really that important
[30:16] [Music]
[30:18] but it's temporary I've learned it in
[30:21] these great mountains what I've learned
[30:23] in my Christians experience if it's a
[30:25] blessing to you today to know this is
[30:27] those I've learned this journey isn't
[30:29] always a mountain
[30:32] this journey has valleys
[30:38] this journey has valleys
[30:41] and now we're learning sister Hannah
[30:46] to say hallelujah from the valley
[30:52] God loves to hear Hallelujah from the
[30:56] valley
[30:57] when I was a young Christian I was not
[30:59] saying hallelujah from the valley
[31:03] I don't know what I was saying but it
[31:04] wasn't that
[31:06] that's what God wants to hear it's easy
[31:08] to shout hallelujah from the mountains
[31:11] it's easy to shout when you're at church
[31:12] it's easy to shout hallelujah at camp
[31:15] meeting
[31:16] Frozen but it's in the valley he wants
[31:18] to hear the Praises of God
[31:21] glory be to God praise our God in the
[31:25] middle of a valley
[31:28] amen
[31:32] I learned that there's not just
[31:33] mountains in this journey there's
[31:35] valleys
[31:36] but one of the greatest things I've
[31:38] learned is there's a constant in my life
[31:41] there's a constant I might have
[31:43] mountains I might have valleys
[31:45] but
[31:47] there's something always constant
[31:49] there's something always consistent
[31:52] the God on the mountain is still God in
[31:54] the valley
[31:55] and when I crash I just fall back on him
[32:01] one Minister said here when you fall if
[32:03] you're going to fall you may fall but
[32:05] when you fall fall back on him
[32:08] when I crashed I fall back on him and
[32:11] his love has never failed it's never
[32:13] changed something really strong keeps
[32:16] holding me something keeps holding me
[32:18] something stronger than myself something
[32:20] stronger than my good feelings at
[32:22] meetings or the bad feelings during The
[32:24] Valleys something stronger than what
[32:27] people feel about me something stronger
[32:28] is in my life there's a constant in my
[32:31] life and it's the love of God Divine
[32:33] Love Never Fails we've seen people with
[32:35] their ups and downs and watching other
[32:37] people ups and downs and ins and outs
[32:40] and sometimes they say Lord you know
[32:42] I've labored for their lives I've prayed
[32:44] for their lives and just still that roll
[32:46] their coaster up and down and up and
[32:48] down I say oh God if that's in my own
[32:50] life take it out but let let me cling to
[32:53] the constant that's in my life let me
[32:55] cling to the consistency that's in my
[32:57] life something stronger than myself
[33:03] yeah
[33:04] I can't live on the ups and downs of
[33:07] people's spiritual walk
[33:10] one week you're an angel
[33:14] Can't Get Enough compliments one week
[33:16] you're an angel the next week they turn
[33:18] against you you're almost the devil
[33:21] I can't live on that so when I come from
[33:23] all those mixture of emotions I have a
[33:26] constant
[33:27] it's the love of God when I come from my
[33:30] own inconsistencies and I have to
[33:33] apologize and God forgive me
[33:37] you know that's the thing is that
[33:40] the devil takes failures
[33:43] we're not we got to look at this from an
[33:45] eternal's perspective because of an
[33:46] eternal perspective
[33:48] your failures don't make you a failure
[33:54] what is it
[33:59] well wake up and smell the coffee
[34:03] because you failed does it make you a
[34:07] failure
[34:08] not in God's Kingdom not in an eternal
[34:12] perspective can you say Amen and I'm
[34:15] sure a few of us this morning have
[34:16] failed just raise your hand just a few
[34:18] of us are right
[34:20] but because you failed doesn't make you
[34:22] a failure not in God's eyes
[34:25] but that's where the devil likes to take
[34:27] it he likes to take it and your
[34:29] inconsistencies and other people's
[34:31] inconsistencies dominate your Christian
[34:34] walk and dominate your life for Untold
[34:36] years we've got to stop that today we've
[34:40] got to stop that and we've got to look
[34:43] at something that's constant in our life
[34:45] we may be inconsistent other people may
[34:47] be inconsistent but there's something
[34:49] that's never inconsistent it's always
[34:52] there it always will be there
[34:54] fathers fail us
[34:58] mothers fail us siblings fail us cousins
[35:01] fail us uncles fail us
[35:04] churches fail us
[35:08] but please get my message this morning
[35:10] there's one thing that will never fail
[35:12] you and that's the love of God in your
[35:15] life
[35:16] [Applause]
[35:22] because I have a constant in my life you
[35:25] know why people get addicted do you
[35:27] realize we're in the addiction
[35:29] generation right
[35:31] this is the addiction generation we've
[35:33] had some of that in other Generations
[35:35] but not like this one because we have so
[35:37] many medicines to address the addictions
[35:40] and
[35:41] they would there's why but why do people
[35:45] get addicted they they like the surge of
[35:48] the adrenaline or
[35:50] uh uh the dopamine surges what do they
[35:54] call it in the mind and that's what is
[35:57] it again
[35:58] dopamine they they get used to things
[36:01] that mechanically do that now it's not
[36:03] just medicines that can do that it is
[36:05] video games
[36:09] it it is porn pornography
[36:12] drugs can you say man
[36:15] too much television
[36:21] so now you know I'm watching on my plane
[36:24] and uh I can't you know everybody's got
[36:26] their own screen it's like I started
[36:28] going that's really what Americans need
[36:30] on a two hour three hour flight
[36:32] they just come from saturated TV their
[36:34] whole life and on their phones that's
[36:35] all they do and that's really what they
[36:38] need in front of them on their two-hour
[36:39] trip
[36:40] everybody gets their own it's their own
[36:42] headphones and I I usually can't find
[36:46] anything to watch hardly at all if I can
[36:48] find something decent then I might watch
[36:50] it but I was looking I was saying God
[36:52] you know look look at this generation
[36:54] look at us look at us
[36:57] this is an absolute Escape obsession
[37:01] this is an addiction
[37:04] no wonder you can't get through when
[37:06] you're preaching to people the hearts
[37:08] are just so saturated with Sensational
[37:11] television
[37:12] and Books and Music
[37:16] and that surges these levels of the
[37:19] brain this pleasure Center and too much
[37:21] they say too much of it is actually a
[37:24] damage to the brain that's what we'll
[37:26] deal with in the sexual temptation as
[37:28] well because this is science it's been
[37:30] proven for years too much of this
[37:31] happening is damaging to the brain
[37:35] video games
[37:37] now I know I've had some young men
[37:39] through the years that have dumped out
[37:40] what I've preached and even when they've
[37:42] been convicted of the Holy Spirit to go
[37:43] home and get rid of those games that are
[37:45] wrong they've been convicted and they
[37:47] walk away and rebel against that that
[37:48] but you see now their lives will show
[37:51] what it is it's it's an it becomes an
[37:54] addiction
[37:55] and you'll see their lives come you say
[37:57] Where's that come from it says because
[37:59] it's because it's from the video games
[38:01] and it's for come parents that allow
[38:03] wrong video games and that's there's
[38:05] fruits that come from that and science
[38:07] has proved it we're too scared to put
[38:09] our foot down and say we're not going to
[38:11] do this
[38:16] so they they're rushed with this and and
[38:19] you wonder if people live for great
[38:21] surges of emotion sometimes because the
[38:24] same thing happens when you're
[38:25] emotionally driven in a service and
[38:28] people get great surges of faith and but
[38:31] you see and they have they have to have
[38:33] it then and that's addiction is that
[38:35] they have to have it in other words how
[38:37] can I take the right medicine that I can
[38:39] have this Rush all the time how can I
[38:42] have enough uh Monster drinks is that
[38:46] what they are
[38:48] I need energy I need energy now I'm not
[38:51] preaching against Monster drinks just
[38:53] check your heart though before you take
[38:55] a lot of that stuff
[38:57] I didn't expect to say any of this today
[39:00] any but I'm going with it
[39:03] because I'm not going to stand by and
[39:05] ignore
[39:06] us being consumed by being like them out
[39:09] there in this addicted generation we're
[39:12] not here to be television veggies
[39:16] on the couch
[39:18] feeding on this stuff all the time on
[39:21] our phone we're not called to that
[39:25] well it doesn't affect me I'm different
[39:27] I'm different you are well what are you
[39:30] celestro are you a superhuman being are
[39:33] you different than us
[39:36] how are you different than me
[39:38] how are you different than when the word
[39:40] calls on it and calls these things how
[39:42] are you different than when television
[39:43] was preached and and the warnings of it
[39:46] preached through a prophet and you say
[39:49] yes that is applied to this whole
[39:50] television generation we need to take
[39:52] those warnings
[39:54] except me
[39:57] it don't apply to me
[40:01] when I called to sit and become addicted
[40:04] to all this stuff
[40:07] you say well I'm not addicted I'm not a
[40:09] dick that's what most
[40:11] addicted people say
[40:14] they don't even know they're addicted is
[40:16] that right yes that's right
[40:19] but the thing is is that I like that
[40:21] feeling so I've got to find whatever it
[40:23] is that I can keep that high all the
[40:26] time that's why we have just down the
[40:27] street we have marijuana places and
[40:29] places we can go for stuff because how
[40:31] can I live on this all the time so
[40:34] that's our generation is that how can I
[40:35] live on the highs all the time the
[40:38] mountains all the time
[40:40] but you see the brain prevents these
[40:42] damage because we're not meant to live
[40:44] in reality on that all the time we're
[40:46] supposed to know how to live when we
[40:47] come out of those highs
[40:49] and that's goes right to a service that
[40:51] camp meeting where you feel a surge of
[40:53] the Holy Ghost and you come and meet a
[40:55] devil on Tuesday young person you
[40:56] realize you're going to need something
[40:58] more solid than an emotion to deal with
[41:00] that devil of Temptation on Tuesday when
[41:02] you get home from Camp you're going to
[41:04] need something deeper than an emotion
[41:10] but so but we're going to sign up for
[41:11] all the camps because I'm going to live
[41:13] off of that you're not going to live off
[41:15] of that it's temporal
[41:17] it's temporal
[41:19] but his love is eternal
[41:24] his love is always there
[41:28] and so
[41:30] please brother Paul please find the end
[41:33] of your sermon please
[41:38] it's not consistent emotional you'll
[41:41] find very emotionally fragile
[41:43] families and people who live off of
[41:45] highs
[41:47] even spiritual highs they're really
[41:50] emotionally fragile most days
[41:53] they're living on an edge just just like
[41:55] a like a string
[41:57] they're not strong emotionally and I
[41:59] think we not only need to be strong in
[42:01] our souls but we need to be strong
[42:03] emotionally
[42:05] it doesn't mean every day you'll be but
[42:07] you need to find an anchor
[42:09] that you're not up and down and your
[42:10] emotions all the time
[42:12] emotionally fragile families will have a
[42:15] bunch of characteristics that eventually
[42:17] come out to show they're not addressing
[42:19] their emotional fragileness in their
[42:21] family
[42:22] the kids are on edge sometimes mom and
[42:24] dad are on edge because we're living in
[42:27] a generation of emotionally fragile
[42:29] people so they're turned into drugs
[42:30] they're turning to things they're turned
[42:32] to TV they're turning to their friends
[42:36] series who's recorded years ago but you
[42:40] know they just live on that friends
[42:41] thing because why it makes me laugh that
[42:43] friends series that uh that series just
[42:46] makes me laugh and I've got to go get me
[42:47] a laugh because I'm feeling the pressure
[42:49] I'm feeling emotionally fragile here
[42:52] can I get an amen from somebody yeah
[42:54] yeah you want me to name some more
[42:55] series that people are watching and you
[42:58] got it on your phone it's a consistent
[43:00] thing you're watching it
[43:02] I'm preaching to all of us
[43:05] what are you using it for
[43:08] is it a replacement
[43:12] for what you're really longing for
[43:19] now some of you are saying we should
[43:21] send this guy on vacation more often
[43:24] and some of you say no let's let him
[43:25] stay home
[43:29] I wonder if people live for these great
[43:30] surges of emotions and then they have it
[43:33] but because they're emotionally fragile
[43:35] people it's not consistent they have not
[43:37] settled into this love that never fails
[43:40] yet this revelation of his love that
[43:42] never fails yet
[43:44] and this love says you don't always need
[43:46] a rush to feel God's approval
[43:53] it's this addicted Nation who have
[43:55] rejected the love of God that makes them
[43:57] addicted to other things they have
[43:59] rejected this constant love of God and
[44:02] Holy Ghost that's what makes them
[44:04] addicts
[44:07] they become addicted to everything else
[44:09] because because they've rejected this
[44:13] constant Holy Ghost love that they can
[44:16] come to and find
[44:18] peace
[44:21] living in the times we live in however
[44:23] how are your list you should be to me
[44:27] and I addressed this to my wonderful
[44:29] audience that's listening in the
[44:31] broadcast I address it to all of us here
[44:33] and also those listening uh maybe it's
[44:36] time in the times we're living in that
[44:38] you should be listening to what I'm
[44:39] laying down this morning what I'm
[44:41] preaching you should be interested in
[44:42] something that would never fail you
[44:46] why because we are in the generation of
[44:50] failed hopes
[44:55] everything has failed us
[44:58] the corporate world has failed us unions
[45:02] have failed us governments have failed
[45:05] us
[45:06] family members have failed us marriages
[45:10] have failed us
[45:12] parents have failed us
[45:15] come on now friends
[45:17] why because they're human
[45:19] they're not God
[45:26] church people have failed us
[45:29] it's an atmosphere everywhere of
[45:31] everything failing us can you say Amen
[45:34] so that we have lost hope we've become
[45:37] cynical we've become sarcastic we've
[45:40] lost any trust we're under accursed of
[45:44] failed hopes promises broken over and
[45:49] over and over again
[45:54] it's a generation of failed hopes
[45:58] everything has failed us
[46:01] the world is falling apart
[46:04] we have no trust in governments we have
[46:06] no trust in presidents we have no trust
[46:09] in our political leaders
[46:11] we have no trust in commercials that are
[46:14] selling something to us
[46:18] didn't brother Bradham have that where
[46:20] he said I've seen on a commercial on the
[46:22] TV that this new detergent that you
[46:25] didn't have to wash the dishes
[46:27] you just sprayed it on this commercial
[46:30] said that you just sprayed it on and it
[46:32] cleaned it himself you didn't have to
[46:33] wash them here he says I'm going to buy
[46:35] it right now and I'm going to be a hero
[46:37] to my wife
[46:40] and he made a little statement there he
[46:42] says he said anything I can help I hate
[46:44] doing dishes and I said praise the Lord
[46:46] I hate him too because he said his mom
[46:48] he's a little boy and his mom would put
[46:51] him up on a footstool and make him wash
[46:52] dishes
[46:54] it sounds like my mom
[46:59] dishes Sharon can you say Amen dishes to
[47:02] galore
[47:03] we did so many I thank God the day the
[47:06] dishwasher came out
[47:08] and then I got four more kids that I had
[47:11] four more dishwashers
[47:15] combination of that I haven't had to do
[47:17] too many dishes
[47:19] Mom and Dad Mom all due respect
[47:24] mom and dad would have this family over
[47:27] the metered family and they had 10 kids
[47:34] and we would use having them for dinner
[47:36] no we didn't have money to go out in
[47:38] those days so Mom and Dad's having them
[47:40] for dinner because they needed help and
[47:41] things that there haven't we had it over
[47:43] again we had them all for dinner and
[47:44] used every dish in that house
[47:48] every dish and guess who had to stand
[47:51] there
[47:52] and wash every dish before they had
[47:56] time to go out and play
[48:02] I don't need counseling for this or
[48:04] anything
[48:06] my mom and I talked about it I'm over it
[48:09] don't sound like I'm over it but I'm
[48:11] over it
[48:14] she's shaking her head because she's
[48:15] when I get home when I take her out
[48:17] Tuesday we go out to dinner me and mom
[48:18] she's going to tell me that's not the
[48:20] full story son
[48:23] she's shaking her head right now but we
[48:25] did have 10 kids in the meter family
[48:26] came over and we had to do dishes I
[48:28] remember that I don't remember a lot of
[48:30] things but I remember doing a lot of
[48:31] dishes and and and these kids are all
[48:34] watching us do the dishes when can you
[48:36] go out and play with us well we can't
[48:39] until we get all your stinking dishes
[48:41] that you ate off of
[48:45] brother Brown says as a little boy he
[48:47] had to get up on that stool in front of
[48:48] this thing dude so he says I'm going to
[48:50] be the hero I'm going to buy this stuff
[48:52] got it brought it home honey you go sit
[48:54] in the living room I'm taking care of
[48:55] the dishes tonight poured that stuff on
[48:57] and there was egg all over it poured it
[48:59] on put it in there stuck it in that
[49:01] water brought it out there was just as
[49:02] much aegon it is before
[49:05] he says I don't believe the commercials
[49:07] anymore
[49:09] and then he gets into those statements
[49:11] he says people given promises they can't
[49:14] keep commercials products
[49:17] he said then you find one commercial
[49:18] here and another commercial here of a
[49:20] different company and find out later
[49:21] they're owned by the same company and
[49:23] they're criticizing the other product
[49:25] then they're owned by the same company
[49:27] all deception
[49:30] trying to get promises they can't keep
[49:31] and then he goes over into the church
[49:36] and he says that's just like the church
[49:38] world of denominational systems always
[49:40] making Promises to the people that they
[49:43] can't keep
[49:44] Always setting expectations but it never
[49:47] really going anywhere to a true Revival
[49:50] you know what happens it fails people
[49:53] and they get disappointed in the church
[49:56] you listen in they get disappointed in
[49:59] the system not the people but the
[50:01] systems has disappointed way too many
[50:04] people these young people in Asbury I
[50:07] think there's a disappointment there's
[50:08] got to be something more real than
[50:10] what's going on and their hearts begin
[50:12] to say God is there something more real
[50:14] God come and the Holy Spirit just comes
[50:16] and baptizes that place
[50:22] we are living in a generation of failure
[50:25] is this okay with everybody failed hopes
[50:28] so you really should be listening and
[50:30] saying whatever you can preach to me
[50:31] that's something that has never failed
[50:33] and never will fail me I need to latch
[50:36] on to that in my life and that's the
[50:38] love of God that's the Holy Ghost love
[50:40] of God I'm going to latch on to that
[50:42] Eternal thing because it didn't change
[50:43] from the beginning he loved you from the
[50:46] foundation of the world before you were
[50:48] born before you were born he went to
[50:49] Calgary but before you were born he
[50:51] thought of you in his mind before the
[50:53] foundation of the world and you know
[50:54] what his thoughts were love towards you
[50:56] I'm going to provide a sacrifice for
[50:59] their sin in my mind because the Bible
[51:01] says you think where are you getting
[51:02] that scripture the Bible says the lamb
[51:04] who was slain from the foundation of the
[51:07] world in God's mind before the
[51:10] foundation of the world he already had a
[51:12] sacrifice of love to go to Calvary to
[51:14] take care of your sin
[51:15] he loved you before you were even born
[51:18] and so if you got the cycle of Eternity
[51:20] now if it's back then you got that cycle
[51:23] it was always was there the love of God
[51:24] towards you then you come around and
[51:26] meet us right here at the end you know
[51:28] what happens with the cycle of Eternity
[51:30] you meet back again the same thing that
[51:32] was in the beginning you meet it again
[51:34] you know where we're coming back to I'm
[51:37] coming back to the Heart of Worship I'm
[51:40] coming back to this constant love I'm
[51:41] coming back to this excellent way I'm
[51:43] coming back to a victory in Divine love
[51:46] in my life that I'm not going to live by
[51:48] feelings anymore
[51:51] coming back to tapping into that
[51:53] eternity that God's always loved me
[51:57] God's always loved me
[51:59] God never did stop loving me
[52:02] there's nothing I can do to make him
[52:04] stop loving me
[52:07] there's nothing that I can do good to
[52:09] make me make him love me more
[52:12] and there's nothing I can do bad to make
[52:15] me any love him love me eat any less
[52:17] either way his love doesn't change oh
[52:21] can you catch it this morning God's love
[52:24] never changes
[52:29] such a curse of failed hopes we get
[52:33] married and we signed a prenuptial
[52:35] agreement you know why because really
[52:37] they expect it to fail right from the
[52:39] start
[52:40] we're so used to failure and people
[52:42] failing us and our mate failing yes that
[52:45] we're already set up to think failure
[52:47] right off the bat
[52:49] sign a prenuptial because this will
[52:51] probably end someday we're used to
[52:54] things fading away
[52:56] we're used to things falling apart
[52:58] we're so used to it we don't trust the
[53:01] church we don't trust anything we don't
[53:03] trust God anymore
[53:05] Church attendance is at an all-time low
[53:08] after covet now Church attendance is at
[53:10] an all-time low right now Church
[53:12] attendant because why people are losing
[53:14] trust they're they're turning to other
[53:16] things other things besides God and they
[53:19] don't need the church anymore it's at an
[53:21] all-time low their trust has been broken
[53:23] they can't bring the people to a reality
[53:25] of God only to a religion you can't
[53:28] preach a religion to people you have to
[53:30] pray and seek God for the moving of the
[53:33] true spirit of God to change hearts and
[53:36] lives
[53:39] so that's the failures of this
[53:41] generation what about your own failures
[53:42] do they affect us
[53:46] it's enough to deal with other people's
[53:48] failures what about your own well maybe
[53:49] you didn't think about your own maybe
[53:51] you only think about how other people
[53:52] have failed you but guess what you
[53:55] failed too
[53:57] and you've failed other people too
[54:00] so how's that we can't have more of a
[54:02] love for people when we know we fail
[54:04] just as much as the next person
[54:08] people live dominated by their own
[54:10] failures emotionally affecting them
[54:12] and then the next stage for being
[54:15] dominated by their own failures is the
[54:16] next stage is a thing called the fear of
[54:20] failure
[54:22] you know there's no end to the devil's
[54:24] paths and ways there's no into it all
[54:26] ends the same way all his paths go to
[54:28] the same end the devil's past go ahead
[54:31] and choose one if you want choose
[54:32] Hollywood choose the series of the world
[54:35] TV choose books choose whatever you want
[54:38] you it all ends the same place more fear
[54:41] more addiction more medicine more movies
[54:45] the next movie coming out more money
[54:47] more defeated more negative
[54:51] all the paths that you want to choose
[54:53] from the world all going to need the
[54:55] same end result
[55:00] lines up the same place you say what
[55:01] ends up in Hell well the devil has a
[55:03] hell but the devil has a living hell
[55:08] did you know it's not hell someday but
[55:10] he has a people living it's a living
[55:13] hell they're living in with all the love
[55:15] of Christ all of us would end up in a
[55:18] living hell that means tormented now not
[55:21] someday in a lake of fire they live
[55:25] burdened and tormented now you say well
[55:28] how did I get here well maybe it's
[55:29] because you've thrown yourself into all
[55:32] the paths of the enemy thinking that's
[55:34] going to give me relief and that's going
[55:35] to make me laugh and that's going to be
[55:37] the right thing
[55:39] leads to the same thing of Torment
[55:42] and fear
[55:44] what is Hell separation from the love of
[55:46] God
[55:48] it's not a place as such
[55:50] hell is living where you're separated
[55:52] from the presence of God
[55:55] that is already hell
[55:57] many have not reached hell yet but
[55:58] they're already in a living hell a world
[56:01] of fear most of it they had too many
[56:04] failed things in life of other people
[56:05] and themselves and even have a fear of
[56:08] failure which by the way has been
[56:09] diagnosed now as a sickness has a name
[56:12] and I can't even pronounce it it's
[56:13] called
[56:14] actifobia act act actually phobia
[56:19] means a fear of failure
[56:21] at phobia is an intense fear of failure
[56:24] it comes from the Greek word uh
[56:27] attaches meaning unfortunate people with
[56:30] actophobia May avoid any situation where
[56:32] they see a potential for failure such as
[56:34] an exam or a job interview it can also
[56:37] mean being afraid of a failed
[56:38] relationship a failed career or being a
[56:41] disappointment to others the fear often
[56:42] becomes a self-fulfilling for example if
[56:45] you're so scared of failing a test that
[56:47] you refuse to take the test you may end
[56:49] up failing an entire class fear failure
[56:52] can lead to a broad range of emotional
[56:54] and psychological problems including
[56:56] shame depression anxiety panic attacks
[57:00] or low self-esteem it may negatively
[57:03] affect how you perform at school or work
[57:05] or how you interact with friends and
[57:07] family members this is all the stuff
[57:08] that comes from the fear of failure you
[57:11] haven't failed yet but you have a fear
[57:13] of failure emotionally affects us fear
[57:16] does that but my Bible says perfect love
[57:19] cast out all fear
[57:26] I'm giving you the answer
[57:28] perfect love cast out fear
[57:31] and I'm not going to read any more of
[57:33] the psychology that is and they even
[57:35] have a medicine for this a specific
[57:36] medicine for this this phobia of the
[57:39] fear of failure it's an illness now
[57:42] we can have a lot of failure and we do
[57:44] but the worst thing is failure defining
[57:47] us to being a complete failure and the
[57:49] love of God this morning says the
[57:51] opposite you may have even failed him
[57:53] but he will never fail you
[58:04] let me deal with one more thing here and
[58:06] then we'll have a quote and we'll we'll
[58:08] end this
[58:12] you say well God has failed me too
[58:18] God failed me one time or God failed me
[58:21] many times really
[58:23] really I hope you're listening online
[58:25] and everywhere
[58:27] God failed me too really
[58:31] are you sure
[58:33] if he really loved me he would have give
[58:36] me what I wanted and what I prayed for
[58:39] really
[58:41] let me ask you who that sounds like in
[58:45] your life
[58:48] mommy and daddy
[58:51] if you really loved me
[58:55] you would have given me what I wanted
[58:57] and what I asked for
[59:00] who's that sound like
[59:04] sounds like our kids
[59:07] will be kids because they don't have
[59:10] wisdom yet
[59:13] be careful that you don't conclude on
[59:16] your kids conclusions
[59:24] sounds like a kid why
[59:26] because that's how a kid defines love
[59:29] it's how immaturity defines love did you
[59:31] give them everything that they ask for
[59:34] and that means that you that means that
[59:38] you to them that your love is hinged
[59:42] upon whether you give them everything
[59:44] that they ask for well you know as a
[59:46] parent now that you can't give them
[59:49] certain things because if you gave them
[59:51] certain things you wouldn't love them at
[59:53] all
[59:56] don't waver on that parents you got a
[59:59] duty a mandate from scripture to hold up
[1:00:01] the token and hold up the word of life
[1:00:03] until that kid has launched in their own
[1:00:05] life and if it's your home you've got a
[1:00:07] duty to hold up in love the
[1:00:09] responsibility of this word because you
[1:00:11] remove God's boundaries you remove God's
[1:00:14] uh landmarks
[1:00:18] you're in trouble
[1:00:20] everything will begin to unravel and you
[1:00:22] removed them because your kid's telling
[1:00:24] you you don't love them
[1:00:25] mom
[1:00:30] if you did
[1:00:33] if you gave everything to the kids you
[1:00:35] were not a good parent there are some
[1:00:38] things that I withheld from my babies my
[1:00:40] wife and I would help my babies because
[1:00:42] I love them I withheld them from because
[1:00:43] I because I did love them it was good
[1:00:47] for them
[1:00:48] if it was good for them I didn't
[1:00:49] withhold it that's what the scripture
[1:00:51] says how much will our heavenly father
[1:00:53] give to his children what they desire
[1:00:55] and then he talks about the Holy Ghost
[1:00:57] how much more he would give you the Holy
[1:00:59] Ghost to them so that ask him so the
[1:01:02] good things and we we're going to give
[1:01:04] because we love them but if it's not
[1:01:06] something that's good for them and it's
[1:01:07] going to have a trickle-down effect
[1:01:08] we're not going to give that to our
[1:01:10] child
[1:01:12] can you say mine
[1:01:15] if you say you need some classes on
[1:01:18] parenting
[1:01:20] I'm doing it right now
[1:01:25] so now if you was is here now so some
[1:01:28] things in my family life and I wasn't
[1:01:30] Perfect by any means but some things I
[1:01:32] used my veto power and said no because I
[1:01:36] love them and it would be best to teach
[1:01:38] them something for their future so I
[1:01:41] said no
[1:01:42] can't have that
[1:01:44] some things I gave because it would be
[1:01:47] good for their future and would have a
[1:01:48] trickle-down effect we all do this as
[1:01:51] parents but God sometimes we look at
[1:01:53] different but God's the great parent can
[1:01:56] you say Amen
[1:01:57] so I want to say about this thing that
[1:01:59] God failed me one thing if he if it did
[1:02:02] look like he failed two things I want to
[1:02:04] mention to you I would not conclude on
[1:02:07] that
[1:02:08] about God until you get the full story
[1:02:12] when you get to the other side
[1:02:15] I would be warned you to conclude that
[1:02:18] God has failed you until you get the
[1:02:21] full story on the other side because
[1:02:24] it's very difficult to take the human
[1:02:27] mindset of love and attach any Scripture
[1:02:30] to God ever failing his people
[1:02:34] so if you're going to quickly just write
[1:02:36] off God failed me he didn't answer my
[1:02:38] prayer God didn't answer my prayer God
[1:02:39] failed me be careful where you go with
[1:02:41] that until you get the full story
[1:02:43] because there is a song that says we'll
[1:02:45] talk it over in the by and by there will
[1:02:47] be some mysterious things that happen in
[1:02:49] life that will never get an explanation
[1:02:51] for but you will get an explanation God
[1:02:55] will graciously explain and I gotta know
[1:02:57] that my God had some good reasons
[1:03:02] that I didn't know about
[1:03:06] so I just warned you be careful of going
[1:03:08] with that until you get the full story
[1:03:10] on the other side because his ways are
[1:03:14] not our ways and his thoughts are higher
[1:03:17] than our thoughts how many know the
[1:03:19] scripture
[1:03:20] his ways are higher than our ways it's
[1:03:23] higher than our feelings his love is
[1:03:25] deeper and higher than our thoughts
[1:03:28] and he knows and the other thing if it
[1:03:31] looked like second thing if he did fail
[1:03:34] you okay if he did fail you his love
[1:03:37] never did fail you
[1:03:41] because I got scripture for that this
[1:03:43] morning
[1:03:44] If he if it looks like to you God fail
[1:03:46] you his love never did fail you and
[1:03:49] never has failed you the Bible says
[1:03:51] charity never fails
[1:03:56] Hallelujah
[1:03:59] so I think the reason Paul said this as
[1:04:01] I move into this last quote if you guys
[1:04:03] want to bring it up we need to move into
[1:04:05] this Divine love and move into this
[1:04:07] cycle of eternal life because his love
[1:04:10] for us is eternal can you say Amen this
[1:04:12] is what revealed in the mystery of
[1:04:13] Melchizedek as at the last days it had
[1:04:16] to be preached who's this Melchizedek if
[1:04:18] you want to catch before you look at the
[1:04:19] quote if you want to catch the mystery
[1:04:21] that God broke to his bride about us
[1:04:24] breaking into the Eternal who is this
[1:04:26] Melchizedek under his life as a material
[1:04:28] because it says the Melchizedek he had
[1:04:30] no beginning in days nor ending of life
[1:04:32] and yet he's there in flesh in front of
[1:04:34] Abraham having communion with him who is
[1:04:37] this Melchizedek who is it well the
[1:04:39] revelation of Melchizedek showed that we
[1:04:42] have a theophany and there's something
[1:04:44] Eternal besides these bodies and if we
[1:04:46] ever Son of God we always were a Son of
[1:04:49] God the logos can you say Amen we come
[1:04:51] from the logos we come from God say
[1:04:53] where are you getting that Jesus said I
[1:04:55] come from God I go back to God he had an
[1:04:58] eternal perspective this is only a
[1:05:01] temporary slot in time and I come from
[1:05:03] the thought of God I'm here for my time
[1:05:05] on Earth and I'm headed back into the
[1:05:07] thought of God
[1:05:09] he said he loved me from the beginning
[1:05:11] and he'll love me in the end
[1:05:15] Hallelujah
[1:05:19] so
[1:05:20] when you tap into this it produces rest
[1:05:23] and Faith like never before I would like
[1:05:25] to elaborate on the mystery of
[1:05:27] Melchizedek because that's the mystery
[1:05:28] that lays in there in Hebrews that Paul
[1:05:31] said I have many things to say about
[1:05:33] Melchizedek but you know it's not the
[1:05:35] time yet what the end time it was time
[1:05:37] to break the mystery that in his life is
[1:05:40] a mystery that if this Earthly
[1:05:43] Tabernacle be dissolved
[1:05:45] First Corinthians we have one waiting
[1:05:48] Eternal in the heavens we have a body
[1:05:50] that's Eternal in the heavens
[1:05:52] and that means if we're a Son of God we
[1:05:55] had an eternal body it means he loved us
[1:05:57] from the beginning to give us a body
[1:05:58] like that we came from him he had to
[1:06:00] love us to give us about it we had to be
[1:06:02] his sons and daughters and so we're just
[1:06:04] here for this what Paul call it this
[1:06:07] light Affliction for a moment
[1:06:10] my 57 years is just a light Affliction
[1:06:14] according to Paul and I don't know if
[1:06:16] it'll be 58 or 60 or 65 I hope I get to
[1:06:19] retire somewhere there but you know I
[1:06:22] don't know when it'll be but I just have
[1:06:23] this small slot that I dropped from
[1:06:26] eternity into time
[1:06:29] but in that Realm
[1:06:31] he's always loved me
[1:06:33] and always will
[1:06:35] I come into this Earth that's failed
[1:06:37] people have failed me I've failed people
[1:06:40] I've made mistakes felt like a failure
[1:06:43] all these other things but once my
[1:06:45] Revelation starts to tap in what his
[1:06:47] word's saying through the message of the
[1:06:48] last days
[1:06:50] I start to hear from my theophany
[1:06:54] glory be to God I start to hear from my
[1:06:57] theophany when you recognize the food of
[1:07:00] God in the last east as Eagle food then
[1:07:02] you say if I'm eating eagle food I'm an
[1:07:05] eagle can you say amen and if you're
[1:07:07] raising your hair saying praise God this
[1:07:08] is affecting my body and my life you
[1:07:11] have heard from your theophany
[1:07:16] where do you get that term it's in the
[1:07:18] Bible if this Earthly Tabernacle
[1:07:21] dissolved we have one Eternal in the
[1:07:23] heavens Paul teach taught on it
[1:07:28] Revelations 2 9 I'm going to end with
[1:07:30] this I promise I'm going to end with
[1:07:32] this and I won't be a failure in that
[1:07:33] I'm going to read this quote and I'm
[1:07:35] going to end the service
[1:07:37] I won't fail you
[1:07:42] it's a long quote though I'm just
[1:07:44] warning you Revelations 2 9 I Know Thy
[1:07:46] Works here's the here's the scripture
[1:07:48] and thy tribulation and poverty but Thou
[1:07:50] Art rich and I know the blasphemy of
[1:07:51] them which say they are Jews and are not
[1:07:54] but are the synagogue of Satan so hear
[1:07:57] the pressure in the second age was that
[1:07:58] they had to deal with Jews that are not
[1:08:01] but are of the synagogue of Satan so
[1:08:03] these are Jews these are people these
[1:08:05] Gentiles here coming to the Lord there's
[1:08:07] some Jews that become Christians there's
[1:08:09] some other Jews that didn't come fully
[1:08:10] in didn't get the Holy Ghost so you got
[1:08:12] different groups there and here's they
[1:08:13] say they're Jews and are not but are the
[1:08:15] synagogue of Satan the mere Association
[1:08:17] of kind-hearted people with the True
[1:08:20] Believer might well bring death in
[1:08:22] return for their kindness wow what a
[1:08:25] pressure the mere Association of
[1:08:29] kind-hearted people with the True
[1:08:32] Believer might well bring death in
[1:08:34] return for their kindness
[1:08:37] that's the reality that that church age
[1:08:39] dealt with now that's the one quote the
[1:08:41] one sentence that's ministered to me the
[1:08:43] last few days is to realize wow I'm
[1:08:46] going to get persecution sometimes even
[1:08:48] in our own camp
[1:08:51] back towards me
[1:08:56] and I have to pray now the Lord God
[1:08:58] Almighty says I know there he is walking
[1:09:01] in the midst of his people so aren't you
[1:09:03] glad he knows
[1:09:05] next one there he is the chief Shepherd
[1:09:08] of the flock but does he hold back the
[1:09:09] persecution does he Stern the
[1:09:11] tribulation no he does not he simply
[1:09:14] says I know your tribulation he didn't
[1:09:16] hold it back he didn't stop it God he
[1:09:19] didn't stop this tribulation and the
[1:09:21] suffering and this being killed because
[1:09:23] remember the red horse spider the white
[1:09:25] horse rider and deception begin to run
[1:09:26] Revelations the red horse rider begin to
[1:09:29] shed blood did anybody disagree with him
[1:09:30] that was the church
[1:09:32] the so-called Church red blood writing
[1:09:36] same writer Satan writing as a church
[1:09:38] killing anybody who disagreed with them
[1:09:41] and now God's not holding that he's
[1:09:43] letting it happen
[1:09:45] but he says I know your tribulation I'm
[1:09:47] not at all unmindful of your suffering
[1:09:49] what a stumbling bachness is to so many
[1:09:51] people like Israel they wonder if God
[1:09:54] really loves them how can God be just
[1:09:57] and loving if he stands by and watches
[1:10:00] his people suffer
[1:10:03] good question
[1:10:06] I'd say it's come to most of our minds
[1:10:10] how could God
[1:10:15] that is what the chief said how could
[1:10:17] God be just and loving if he stands by
[1:10:18] and watches his people suffer
[1:10:20] that is what they ask in Malachi 1 1 3
[1:10:23] the burden of the word of the Lord to
[1:10:25] Israel by Malachi I have loved you saith
[1:10:27] the Lord yet you say where in hast thou
[1:10:29] loved us was not Esau Jacob's brother
[1:10:31] saith the Lord yet I love Jacob and I
[1:10:34] hated Esau and I laid his mountains and
[1:10:36] his Heritage waits for the dragons of
[1:10:37] the Wilderness you see they could not
[1:10:39] figure out God's love they thought that
[1:10:41] love meant no suffering
[1:10:43] they thought that love meant a baby with
[1:10:45] parental care that's what kind of love
[1:10:47] they knew but God said that this love
[1:10:49] was elective love the proof of his love
[1:10:52] is election
[1:10:54] that no matter what happened his love
[1:10:57] was proven truly by the fact they were
[1:11:01] chosen unto salvation because God hath
[1:11:04] chosen you to Salvation through
[1:11:06] segregation of the spirit and belief of
[1:11:08] the truth he may commit you to death as
[1:11:11] he did Paul
[1:11:17] next one
[1:11:22] he may commit you to suffering as he did
[1:11:24] job that's his prerogative can you say
[1:11:28] amen he is Sovereign but it is all with
[1:11:31] a purpose if he did not have a purpose
[1:11:33] then he would be the author of
[1:11:34] frustration and not of Peace if God
[1:11:37] didn't hold from the foundation of
[1:11:38] purpose for your life then we would we
[1:11:41] then it would he would be the author of
[1:11:43] frustration in our life and he's not the
[1:11:45] author of frustration in your life God's
[1:11:47] not he's like you say I've been confused
[1:11:49] I'm just confused brother Paul the
[1:11:51] message confuses me the what's happened
[1:11:53] in my life confusing me I understand but
[1:11:55] God did not cause that confusion don't
[1:11:58] take god with that
[1:12:00] God has not ordered your life to confuse
[1:12:03] you and hurt you but he loves you to
[1:12:05] save you and to love you and to fill you
[1:12:07] and to transform you into be a friend to
[1:12:11] you can I get an amen
[1:12:14] it wasn't God that did those things to
[1:12:17] you
[1:12:18] he may have allowed a certain life but
[1:12:21] he has a purpose in his purpose he would
[1:12:23] he would be the author of frustration
[1:12:25] and not a peace his purpose is that
[1:12:27] after we have suffered a while we would
[1:12:29] be made perfect be established
[1:12:30] strengthened and settled the Cloudy oh I
[1:12:33] love that how many wants to be perfect
[1:12:34] to establish strengthened and settled
[1:12:37] that's his desire the Cloudy style look
[1:12:39] at this the cloudy skies and storms of
[1:12:42] life are no signs of God's disapproval
[1:12:50] neither are bright skies and Still
[1:12:53] Waters signs of his love and approval
[1:12:55] you got an easy going time and it still
[1:12:58] waters and you're just feeling so good
[1:13:00] praise the Lord God must be approving of
[1:13:04] me don't think that way because tomorrow
[1:13:07] you won't have Still Waters anymore
[1:13:10] and if you're going on that's your
[1:13:12] approval then tomorrow he doesn't
[1:13:14] approve of me anymore
[1:13:17] a big baby
[1:13:20] you can't look at it that way
[1:13:23] neither are bright skies and Stillwater
[1:13:25] signs of another world his approval of
[1:13:27] any of us is only in the Beloved his
[1:13:30] love is elective which he had of us
[1:13:32] before the foundation of the world does
[1:13:35] he love us ah yes but how shall we know
[1:13:38] we shall know because he said so
[1:13:42] and manifested that he did love for us
[1:13:45] where he brought us to himself and gave
[1:13:48] us of his Spirit placing us as Sons can
[1:13:53] somebody say Amen
[1:13:54] [Laughter]
[1:14:00] and how shall I prove my love to him
[1:14:05] how many wants to prove your love to him
[1:14:09] how shall I prove my love to him by
[1:14:11] believing what he said and by conducting
[1:14:15] myself with joy
[1:14:17] in the middle of my trials
[1:14:21] that he in his wisdom allows
[1:14:25] to come to pass
[1:14:30] if you ran from him
[1:14:32] he didn't want you to run
[1:14:34] something hits you some loss in your
[1:14:35] life something done wrong somebody
[1:14:38] failed you
[1:14:39] you see you feel God failed you
[1:14:43] he didn't want you to run
[1:14:48] he didn't want you to run
[1:14:50] you ran but he didn't want you to run
[1:14:55] and then this song says and then he ran
[1:14:57] to me
[1:15:00] prodigal son comes back and the Bible
[1:15:02] says
[1:15:03] he didn't even make it to the house yet
[1:15:05] the father ran towards him
[1:15:11] ran to me
[1:15:14] took me in his arms
[1:15:34] he didn't want you to run
[1:15:37] he didn't want you to quit
[1:15:41] some of you did some of you said I'm
[1:15:43] done I'm finished
[1:15:45] God didn't want you to do that
[1:15:48] always amazing me when somebody goes
[1:15:49] through something and I give him Grace
[1:15:51] and time and patience but the very thing
[1:15:55] that they need
[1:15:58] good Fellowship the presence of the Lord
[1:16:00] around the right kind of people
[1:16:03] that's the one thing they run from
[1:16:08] find all kinds of other friends and find
[1:16:10] other things but the one thing the
[1:16:12] presence of God and he rant me see
[1:16:17] [Music]
[1:16:19] so
[1:16:22] this altar is open this morning come and
[1:16:24] pray
