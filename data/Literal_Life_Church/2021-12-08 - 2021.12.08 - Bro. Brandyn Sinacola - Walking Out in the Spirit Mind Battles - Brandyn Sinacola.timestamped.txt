[0:47] um ben siebolt from lima ohio will be

[0:52] and then also at 10 30 a.m on sunday so
[0:56] he went on to wanted to support those
[0:58] that meeting if we could
[1:02] are you happy to be a christian
[1:04] amen
[1:05] romans 8 15
[1:08] to verse 17 for ye have not received the
[1:11] spirit of bondage again to fear
[1:13] but ye have received the spirit of
[1:15] adoption whereby we cry abba father
[1:18] the spirit itself beareth witness with
[1:20] our spirit that we are the children of
[1:22] god
[1:23] and if children than heirs heirs of god
[1:26] and joint heirs with christ
[1:28] if so be we suffer with him
[1:31] that we may all may also
[1:34] may be also glorified together
[1:37] and then if you would first timothy 1
[1:40] and verse 7.
[1:48] i'm sorry second timothy 1 and verse 7.
[1:57] for god hath not given us the spirit of
[1:59] fear but of power and of love and of a
[2:02] sound mind
[2:04] let's just pray one more time father
[2:06] bless your word
[2:07] bless your people
[2:09] i pray that all the cares of life god
[2:11] would be lifted now and that they would
[2:12] be fed something from you not from me
[2:14] lord but from you
[2:16] in jesus christ's name amen
[2:19] amen
[2:21] you can be seated
[2:23] i appreciate you coming out tonight
[2:27] i'm going to read
[2:29] a couple more places if
[2:31] you don't have to turn there first peter
[2:33] 5 and verse 6 and i'm just
[2:37] reading a lot to lay a foundation but
[2:39] maybe just refer to these real quick
[2:41] again in a minute and then
[2:43] get get to our
[2:45] thought tonight
[2:47] first peter 5. verse 6 humble yourselves
[2:51] therefore under the mighty hand of god
[2:53] that he may exalt you in due time
[2:56] casting all your care upon him for he
[2:58] careth for you
[3:00] be sober be vigilant
[3:02] because your adversary the devil as a
[3:04] roaring lion walketh about seeking whom
[3:07] he may devour
[3:08] whom resist steadfast in the faith
[3:11] knowing that the same afflictions are
[3:12] accomplished in your brethren that are
[3:14] in the world
[3:15] but the grace but the god of all grace
[3:18] who hath called us unto his eternal
[3:20] glory
[3:21] by christ jesus
[3:23] after that he ye have suffered a while
[3:26] so he just promised you that there's
[3:28] going to be suffering in this life
[3:31] after you have suffered for a while
[3:34] make you perfect
[3:35] establish you strengthen you
[3:38] and settle you
[3:41] those are those are some pretty powerful
[3:43] terms in this day that we live in that
[3:45] you could be settled
[3:48] to him be glory and dominion forever and
[3:51] ever amen
[3:52] i'm not going to turn there in my bible
[3:54] i got it here on my screen ephesians 6
[3:57] 10
[3:59] starting at verse 10
[4:00] finally my brethren be strong in the
[4:02] lord and in the power of his might put
[4:04] on the whole armor of god that ye may be
[4:06] able to stand against the wiles of the
[4:08] devil
[4:10] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[4:12] blood but against principalities against
[4:14] powers
[4:16] against the rulers of the darkness of
[4:17] this world against spiritual wickedness
[4:19] in high places
[4:21] jump into verse 16 above all taking the
[4:23] shield of faith wherewith ye shall be
[4:26] able to quench all the fiery darts of
[4:28] the wicked
[4:29] and take the helmet of salvation
[4:33] something to cover your mind
[4:35] and the sword of the spirit which is the
[4:37] word of god praying always with all
[4:40] prayer and supplication in the spirit
[4:43] and watching there unto with all
[4:44] perseverance and supplication for all
[4:47] saints
[4:48] and for me the utterance may be given
[4:50] unto me that i may open my mouth boldly
[4:52] to make known the mystery of the gospel
[4:55] so that the preaching of the word is
[4:57] going to be an important tool for you
[5:00] for which i'm an ambassador in bonds
[5:02] that therein i may speak boldly as i
[5:04] ought to speak
[5:06] and i want to talk tonight just continue
[5:08] a little bit down the path of of walking
[5:10] after the spirit and if i could maybe
[5:13] subtitle this that call it mind battles
[5:17] and i've just been listening to
[5:19] the different testimonies sunday night
[5:21] which i i just really enjoyed um hearing
[5:25] the the personal victories and and the
[5:27] people's lives and
[5:29] and you know i'm sure that there were
[5:30] many who didn't get up and speak them
[5:33] and i'm sure that there were many who
[5:34] were sitting there who thought
[5:36] well i don't have anything that i've got
[5:38] a personal victory on right now
[5:41] but you might not have something that
[5:42] you can get up and testify
[5:46] now
[5:47] but you will
[5:48] amen so i encourage you tonight to just
[5:50] hang on hold tight
[5:53] hear what i have to say
[5:56] keep coming keep pressing the battle and
[5:58] i pray god give you strength amen
[6:01] and be encouraged by his word
[6:04] so we we all deal with mind battles and
[6:07] and
[6:07] uh a lot of them from what i from what i
[6:10] was
[6:11] picking up on and sometimes it's just
[6:12] when the lord deals with the minister's
[6:14] heart
[6:15] he'll he'll start hearing everything
[6:17] kind of through that vein that channel
[6:19] so um you know as as the ones were given
[6:22] their testimony what i kept hearing was
[6:25] satan was attacking my mind
[6:28] and i kept hearing satan's attacking my
[6:30] mind and then brother paul gets up and
[6:31] he preaches on sunday
[6:33] and in condemnation well where is
[6:35] condemnation that's a battle in the mind
[6:38] that's satan attacking your mind trying
[6:40] to condemn you getting you to think that
[6:42] you're doing wrong or getting you to
[6:44] think that you're you're you're too far
[6:46] gone you're you're out of it's not truth
[6:50] amen if it was truth it would resonate
[6:52] from the inward man but it's not here
[6:55] it's up here and it might cloud the
[6:57] waters that that could touch your soul
[7:00] that your soul would speak back and say
[7:02] no that's not the truth
[7:04] and satan's voice can cloud that up and
[7:07] and stop that channel up because the
[7:09] mind gets so heavy and so thickened with
[7:12] the enemy's voice
[7:15] so
[7:16] we we all deal with mind battles so if
[7:18] we if we raised our hands and looked
[7:20] around everybody would have their hand
[7:22] raised so i i say that to say you know
[7:25] in in the mind battles and things satan
[7:28] will make you feel isolated and alone
[7:30] but you're not alone and you're not
[7:32] isolated everybody around you has either
[7:36] gone through a mind battle going through
[7:38] a mind battle or getting ready to go
[7:40] into a mind battle
[7:41] it's just it's it's the it's you know we
[7:43] think testing trials as something you
[7:46] know
[7:47] your car getting scratched or losing
[7:49] your wallet or you know something
[7:51] physical outward that you're going to
[7:53] experience a sickness or something but
[7:55] that's not always the case usually and
[7:57] actually probably in every instance that
[7:59] you go through in an outward trial
[8:01] there's something inward that goes with
[8:03] it
[8:04] and the inward is actually what would
[8:06] would cause you more harm than the
[8:07] outward
[8:09] amen
[8:10] are you awake tonight
[8:14] sometimes the mind battles are greater
[8:16] than others
[8:18] sometimes it's great in a in a certain
[8:21] season of life than other times
[8:24] so there might be a certain person who's
[8:26] who's maybe bet a specific way their
[8:30] their personality is a certain way and
[8:32] they just they lean more towards the
[8:34] mind battles
[8:35] the the battles are heavier on them they
[8:37] they can't uh maybe tolerate the mind
[8:40] battles as easy as somebody else
[8:42] but it might just be what that mind
[8:44] battle is because you might be
[8:47] maybe even critical of somebody
[8:49] but that's just because the mind battle
[8:52] hasn't touched the area in your life
[8:54] where you would act the same way
[8:58] so
[8:58] sometimes it's a season for a woman it's
[9:01] often um
[9:03] like a a change of life a menopause or
[9:07] or uh postpartum
[9:11] sisters say man i guess
[9:14] come on brothers you can say men too
[9:16] just don't don't say it to uh expressly
[9:22] but honest to goodness the prophet said
[9:25] that men can reach a certain life time
[9:27] in life and it's almost like a like a
[9:29] menopause for men and i've seen it
[9:32] i've seen it where the man gets almost
[9:34] into a we we would call it a midlife
[9:35] crisis
[9:37] and and maybe you know he can't afford
[9:39] to go by the sports car or something but
[9:43] we do some crazy things too
[9:48] get into a hobby that we have no clue
[9:50] what we're doing but by golly we're
[9:52] going to do it and
[9:53] put our mind to it
[9:55] but it's it's these certain seasons of
[9:57] life and and and the thing that i don't
[9:59] like
[10:00] okay and this is i i get i i have a lot
[10:03] of righteous anger right now at the
[10:05] devil because what i don't like is
[10:07] during those times in those seasons how
[10:10] how he can affect us in such a negative
[10:12] way to make us think that we're losing
[10:15] our mind
[10:18] that and that's a terrible feeling to
[10:19] feel
[10:20] and and if you've never felt it just
[10:23] pray for grace
[10:25] because it you just it's it's
[10:28] you can't grasp you can't hold a thought
[10:30] you can't grasp onto things you can't
[10:33] you just you feel like you're losing
[10:35] control of everything and you can't you
[10:37] you can't go through a normal day you
[10:39] can't i for some reason
[10:43] my wife was saying maybe the the effects
[10:45] of the stuff they gave me during surgery
[10:47] haven't worn off yet
[10:49] because
[10:50] twice
[10:51] not once but twice
[10:53] i ordered something online had it sent
[10:56] to kohl's
[10:58] went to pennies
[10:59] and
[11:00] signed in sitting in the curbside pickup
[11:03] and i'm sitting there watching people
[11:05] going in and out and bringing other
[11:07] people's stuff and i'm sitting there and
[11:08] i'm telling you what i had no clue
[11:11] that i was in the wrong spot i was
[11:14] wondering why in the world and so this
[11:16] lady comes out and she's asking you know
[11:19] did you guys sign in the app i said yeah
[11:21] i signed in in the app and
[11:23] i just happened to look down and
[11:24] something finally clicked and i said
[11:26] kohl's and i said you know what
[11:28] um
[11:29] i figured it out
[11:33] so then i go to the other store and
[11:35] because i took so long i had to go
[11:37] inside and get it i was just trying to
[11:39] save time i don't care about going in
[11:42] so that was the first time
[11:44] then i realized i ordered the wrong
[11:46] thing the wrong the wrong shirt so i
[11:48] took them back
[11:50] and
[11:52] i i ordered from again
[11:55] kohl's but i get out of my car and i
[11:57] walk in i walk into pennies this time
[12:00] and i'm standing in line
[12:03] and i walk up and i hold my phone out
[12:06] and she's she scans it and doesn't do
[12:08] nothing and she scans it and doesn't do
[12:10] nothing and she she takes my phone and
[12:12] she's looking at it and she goes oh
[12:14] um
[12:15] you got to go to kohl's
[12:19] and so i just said i like you guys
[12:22] better
[12:24] and then i had to walk out and go back
[12:27] to kohl's
[12:28] but i i'm telling you i i afterwards
[12:31] though and it wasn't a great mind battle
[12:33] i laughed it off but in those moments i
[12:36] thought
[12:37] there was absolutely no trigger that i
[12:39] was in the wrong place
[12:41] or anything and and i i just
[12:44] i had a thought i'm losing my mind
[12:48] and you're thinking that too
[12:53] but
[12:56] whatever that was worth
[12:59] but you know in letting off the pressure
[13:00] brother branham says that we're in a
[13:02] nervous neurotic age
[13:05] and he said that the doctors don't have
[13:08] the answer for it and and it's and this
[13:10] is something that i've experienced too
[13:12] just in in dealing with different ones
[13:14] or
[13:15] knowing some different stories as
[13:18] is he says that the doctors don't have
[13:20] the answers they just give you a
[13:21] tranquilizer and and it's just
[13:25] they're just as nervous as you are
[13:27] and they give you medication and he said
[13:29] he called it a tranquilizer what's a
[13:31] tranquilizer do it kind of
[13:34] numbs you puts you to sleep kind of it
[13:37] you
[13:39] you know you see they shoot them at
[13:40] animals and then the animals go down
[13:42] they're not bad they're still awake but
[13:44] they can't really move they they're the
[13:47] the fight uh nature that's in that
[13:50] animal goes away they kind of lay there
[13:52] there's nothing they can do
[13:54] and now
[13:56] i want to bring a good balance on this
[13:58] because i'm not saying quit taking the
[14:00] medicine if you're taking it if you're
[14:02] on medication if the doctor puts you on
[14:04] medication
[14:05] don't leave the service and say brother
[14:07] brandon said i can stop taking my
[14:08] medicine that's not what i'm saying
[14:12] but we have to we i i want to point you
[14:15] tonight to the source of a cure because
[14:18] these medications they they you know the
[14:21] prophet spoke real highly of medicine
[14:23] and medical science and he said you know
[14:26] he went to the doctors and he had
[14:27] friends who were doctors and i was
[14:29] listening to a message the other day and
[14:30] he said if you don't have a medical
[14:32] journal you should get one because
[14:34] there's there's all kinds of fascinating
[14:36] things in there and you might learn
[14:38] something about yourself and
[14:41] you know have a better quality of life
[14:43] but
[14:44] he's you know they they give you a
[14:46] medicine and it really does numb you and
[14:49] it it you lose you lose feeling it it
[14:52] might make you sleep more and and it
[14:54] actually takes certain
[14:57] elements of your personality which are a
[14:59] positive thing
[15:00] and it takes them out we um there's
[15:03] somebody i know
[15:04] and and i was kind of laughing with her
[15:06] a little bit the other day because
[15:08] um i walked in and you know her smile
[15:11] was what i remembered it to be
[15:14] and i said boy that was the most sincere
[15:16] smile that i've seen out of you in a
[15:18] long time nobody here okay so don't be
[15:19] wondering
[15:20] and i said that was the most
[15:22] pure smile that i've seen on your face
[15:25] in a long time and you know she's just
[15:27] like oh really you know i didn't know
[15:29] there was a difference and i and i said
[15:31] yeah so we got to talking about the
[15:32] medication she was on that that we knew
[15:34] she was taking
[15:36] and uh
[15:38] you know it just it takes certain
[15:40] elements of of
[15:42] you know her bubbly personality in it
[15:44] and it numbed them it took him out so
[15:47] you know she said what she said was
[15:49] helping her focus we were all seeing was
[15:52] like a blank
[15:54] like she's not there
[15:56] and it's sad you know that she needed
[15:58] the medicine to help her at the time
[16:01] but you feel bad because of all the
[16:04] effects of it
[16:05] are you with me so far
[16:08] but what i'm getting at is is it's a
[16:11] nervous age and and the nervous age and
[16:14] the tension in things it weighs on our
[16:16] minds and it affects our minds and and
[16:19] and then the devil just starts wreaking
[16:21] havoc on that and using it as a tool to
[16:23] give you mind battles and make you feel
[16:26] like you're going crazy
[16:34] i was reading today because i i you know
[16:37] i had those certain thoughts about the
[16:38] medication and and
[16:40] mental health and things and so i went
[16:42] and i and i just did a little just real
[16:44] brief research and
[16:46] they even say you know the the the
[16:48] medication they give you it can improve
[16:50] symptoms but it can't cure you
[16:53] so it's masking the problem
[16:55] so what i'm interested in is seeing the
[16:57] problem be dealt with
[17:06] so again like i said don't quit taking
[17:08] the medication if you're on medication
[17:12] it's helping you
[17:14] but what we need is for christ to come
[17:16] on the scene and you need christ to come
[17:19] in and like ephesians 6 said giving us
[17:21] our armor and our weapons for spiritual
[17:23] warfare
[17:25] so it's it's it's not a carnal warfare
[17:28] it's not somebody that you can lay your
[17:30] hands on and fight and argue with them
[17:32] it's it's spiritual warfare
[17:37] and it says and and paul was writing in
[17:40] ephesians and he and he wrote to pray
[17:42] always in the spirit
[17:44] and in the scriptures we read romans 8
[17:47] and in another spot we read last time
[17:49] says the spirit helps our infirmities
[17:51] and praise when we don't know what to
[17:53] pray for
[17:54] so when you feel like you're you're
[17:56] losing your mind when you feel that
[17:58] nervous tension when you feel like
[17:59] everything is crumbling around you
[18:02] there's there's a right channel to get
[18:04] into to get help
[18:06] to actually go and and get the cure for
[18:09] the problem to affect what is actually
[18:12] going on inside of you
[18:14] because it's it's not
[18:17] it's not uh uh
[18:19] what the medical science would call a
[18:22] you know you you have bipolar or you
[18:24] know
[18:25] schizophrenic or just whatever they
[18:29] might deem that you have that's not the
[18:31] actual thing that's that's a medical
[18:34] name for a spiritual demon
[18:36] so what we want to deal with is the
[18:38] spiritual demon
[18:40] and i want to give you some things
[18:41] tonight to
[18:43] help with that
[18:45] first of all first peter said the god of
[18:47] all grace
[18:48] the god of all grace will establish you
[18:52] and strengthen you and settle you
[18:55] so i'm just going to keep pointing you
[18:57] to christ tonight that he's the answer
[19:00] that it's god's grace god give you grace
[19:02] in those times god give you the spirit
[19:05] of joy
[19:06] god give you the spirit of contentment
[19:10] because there might be a lot of things
[19:12] going on in your mind that's just you're
[19:14] not content
[19:15] you're running to and fro and you're
[19:17] you're looking at everybody else and get
[19:20] off social media first of all
[19:28] stay off social media
[19:30] if you struggle it's just that simple
[19:33] you're not going to miss anything in
[19:35] anybody else's life it's it's it's not
[19:37] really that important
[19:40] you can talk to them if they live miles
[19:42] away give them a call
[19:45] share pictures
[19:47] that's fine
[19:49] text a picture
[19:51] call him though find out how crazy life
[19:54] really is
[19:55] because a picture can paint a thousand
[19:57] words but it can paint a thousand
[19:59] positive words when all the negative is
[20:01] actually
[20:02] outside the frame of the picture
[20:06] like
[20:08] one of my daughter's closets
[20:12] she was showing me how clean the room
[20:14] was
[20:15] and i just happened to open the curtain
[20:17] and i said
[20:20] is this how you cleaned your room
[20:23] and it was a deer in the headlights
[20:26] looks good on the outside but you got to
[20:28] dig a little bit
[20:29] everybody's got dirty laundry
[20:32] everybody's got a sink full of dirty
[20:34] dishes okay
[20:37] so go to the right source you know we
[20:39] get we get down and when the mind battle
[20:41] is on and the pressure is on we want to
[20:43] release and we want to just shut the
[20:45] mind down
[20:46] and that's why entertainment and things
[20:48] is so appealing because
[20:51] it you just you shut down for
[20:54] 30 minutes or
[20:56] however long it is
[20:58] your mind just it just kind of puts you
[21:00] into neutral and you can just
[21:03] not think and and
[21:05] laugh or whatever it is and there's
[21:06] nothing wrong with that
[21:08] but if you're turning to that all the
[21:10] time
[21:11] you're not dealing with the source of
[21:13] the problem
[21:15] again it's just like taking a pill
[21:17] called entertainment
[21:19] amen
[21:20] you're just going to keep turning to it
[21:21] but it's not going to actually fix the
[21:23] problem that that is causing you to feel
[21:26] that way there's no lasting comfort in
[21:29] it amen
[21:31] in the greatest battle ever fought
[21:34] the prophet said it's the greatest
[21:36] battle ever fought is in the mind
[21:38] because
[21:40] that's where decisions are made
[21:42] so why am i this way why are we built
[21:45] this way why why do you have mind metals
[21:48] why is it such a
[21:50] why is between the ears
[21:52] such a horrible place sometimes
[21:55] that's because that's where decisions
[21:57] are made
[21:59] christ we we know these things i'm just
[22:02] stirring up your memory okay
[22:05] you know these things you've been taught
[22:07] well
[22:08] but it's it's the pressure in things and
[22:11] god is after the soul the inward man and
[22:14] satan said okay but i want to fight in
[22:17] the mind
[22:18] because if i can get them to doubt
[22:21] then that keeps it from getting to the
[22:23] soul
[22:25] where god wants to be
[22:27] so that's why
[22:28] that's that's the reason that's the why
[22:30] i just i thought maybe if we knew why we
[22:33] had the mind battle that would be
[22:34] helpful
[22:37] mind battles i was thinking about
[22:38] today's youth
[22:40] what a target they are for the enemy
[22:44] because if he can
[22:46] start putting scars in them at a young
[22:48] age
[22:49] that could
[22:50] last with them
[22:51] throughout their lifetime
[22:54] that could that could maybe keep them
[22:56] from making a decision to serve christ
[23:00] not not forever because if you're god
[23:02] you will come
[23:04] but maybe he could delay it as much as
[23:07] possible and and heap up the baggage
[23:10] that you're going to bring when you do
[23:11] come to christ
[23:12] and then when you do come to christ
[23:14] you're going to feel unworthy and that's
[23:15] going to make it last longer that you
[23:17] see the vicious cycle of the enemy
[23:21] so today's youth and you know they're
[23:23] dealing with things that i never i
[23:25] didn't have to deal with in school i
[23:27] thought i had it pretty bad
[23:29] but i watched today and it i mean satan
[23:32] has just
[23:33] pulled he's he's pulled out all the
[23:35] stops he's not holding back punches
[23:37] anymore
[23:38] he's trying to attack their minds he's
[23:41] he's you know really after him
[23:45] used to i think i said it here i read
[23:47] something you know used to for
[23:48] pornography you had to you had to work
[23:50] to go find it
[23:52] now you have to work not to see it
[23:55] why because satan is trying to pollute
[23:57] that mind while it's pure
[24:00] before it has a hope of of knowing
[24:03] anything better the way that god
[24:05] intended it to be
[24:08] it leaves them damaged scarred and
[24:10] hinders their faith
[24:12] are you still with me
[24:15] isaiah 60 1-3
[24:25] and i just want especially the young
[24:27] people but everybody to know tonight
[24:29] that it's it's there's nothing wrong
[24:31] with you
[24:33] there's absolutely nothing wrong with
[24:35] you
[24:36] this is the battle that we face this is
[24:38] the enemy we fight every day
[24:40] he he's the accuser of the brethren day
[24:43] and night right
[24:45] verse
[24:46] verse 1 arise shine for thy light is
[24:50] come and the glory of the lord is risen
[24:52] upon thee
[24:53] for behold the darkness shall cover the
[24:55] earth in gross darkness the
[24:58] people gross darkness the people but the
[25:01] lord shall arise upon thee and his glory
[25:04] shall be seen upon thee and the gentiles
[25:07] shall come to thy light and kings to the
[25:10] brightness of thy rising
[25:12] so there's a gross darkness among us
[25:14] today and it's on the there's there's
[25:16] darkness around us but then there's
[25:18] gross darkness on the people
[25:20] and that includes you
[25:22] but i i want you to catch on to the hope
[25:25] tonight that's in christ
[25:27] that his light is going to shine upon
[25:29] you
[25:30] his light will pierce the darkness of
[25:32] your mind of your mental battles his
[25:35] light is going to pierce it
[25:37] amen
[25:38] and he's he's going to give you hope
[25:41] when you're distraught he's going to
[25:43] give you healing when your body's sick
[25:46] i think one of the worst things is is
[25:48] these these sicknesses that that last
[25:51] for a long time
[25:53] you know and then the devil will start
[25:55] working on someone saying well it's your
[25:57] faith
[25:59] but maybe god just needs you to get more
[26:01] out of that trial maybe it's not so much
[26:03] your faith maybe it's what god has in
[26:06] store for you to establish you and to
[26:09] make you feel secure
[26:11] on the other side of the trial
[26:13] amen
[26:16] so catch catch the things that that the
[26:19] scripture is saying
[26:21] the grace the god of all grace the light
[26:23] that he'll shine upon you
[26:26] in the midst of all these things of the
[26:28] gross darkness of the mind battles
[26:38] i don't think i sent these quotes to you
[26:40] uh
[26:41] isabelle but this first one i'll just
[26:43] read it but there is a pressure on the
[26:45] people today and that pressure has no
[26:47] limitation
[26:49] or any denominational lines
[26:52] well i'm in the message i don't have
[26:54] mind battles you're lying
[26:59] it has no limitations it has no age line
[27:04] it has no respect of person it's on
[27:07] young and old good and bad it's on
[27:09] everybody
[27:10] pressure
[27:12] he said that's right it's it's a time
[27:15] and in that rushing and speeding it gets
[27:18] you to a nervous tension the wife say
[27:20] something a little contrary you want to
[27:22] fly off temper husbands say something
[27:25] you'll pat your foot and tell them to
[27:27] get in the room
[27:28] see well now husband i don't want no
[27:30] words with you go out there
[27:33] wife oh i'm so nervous see why what's
[27:35] the matter see
[27:37] all this together this tension builds up
[27:40] then the results of it is
[27:42] uh
[27:43] he says saying something you didn't mean
[27:45] to say
[27:48] all this pressure all the mind battle
[27:50] all the the tension you know in in
[27:52] studying this i found myself you know
[27:55] you just you you carry the burden for
[27:58] the service and things and and that
[28:00] that's a it's a it's a privilege but
[28:03] it's a pressure too there's some
[28:04] pressure that goes with it and you feel
[28:06] that pressure and then you feel like all
[28:08] the other things you got to do they they
[28:09] decided to change the system we work in
[28:11] on monday and it's just been a mess and
[28:14] things and so all this pressure build up
[28:16] and i thank god because as i'm studying
[28:19] this i start recognizing
[28:21] something said
[28:23] and my initial inside reaction is is
[28:26] knee-jerk
[28:27] you know say something back or react
[28:30] this way
[28:31] and i thank the lord because because
[28:33] i've been studying this i could catch
[28:35] that and i could say no
[28:37] i'm not going to respond that way
[28:39] because i know what's happening
[28:41] i'm under pressure right now and it's
[28:43] built up and if i'm not careful it's
[28:45] going to spill out of my mouth and it's
[28:47] going to cause more harm than it is good
[28:54] see the devil i was thinking about this
[28:56] the devil wants to build up pressure to
[28:58] where you blow off the handle
[29:00] you know something you can take a steam
[29:02] engine and you could pack that thing so
[29:04] full of steam that it'll explode
[29:07] but you see it it does need just enough
[29:10] pressure from the steam to move forward
[29:13] so
[29:14] we have pressure in our lives
[29:17] i believe
[29:18] to move us forward
[29:20] really there's there's a pressure that
[29:22] god allows on us because it drives us to
[29:25] him
[29:26] or it should
[29:28] and if you don't drive to him you're
[29:29] going to drive to something else and
[29:30] blow up
[29:32] so god will just say okay we'll patch
[29:34] that we'll put a little more steam you
[29:36] get going forward he puts on the
[29:39] pressure and he's standing there just
[29:41] waiting for you to come to him
[29:43] to let off the pressure
[29:45] to to regulate that just right
[29:48] we need christ we need the the master
[29:50] conductor amen
[29:57] sunday mornings
[30:02] we just let that go because everybody
[30:04] knows what we're saying
[30:07] sunday mornings
[30:08] hurry and get to church
[30:10] frantic finding everything
[30:14] get everyone to the car
[30:16] without one going out the other door and
[30:19] going back inside
[30:21] no stay in the car
[30:24] i'm the only one i guess that deals with
[30:26] this amen brandon amen thanks brother
[30:32] by the time you get to church you're a
[30:33] nervous wreck and then poor gideon's up
[30:36] here trying to lead songs and he's
[30:38] wondering why everyone's so tight on him
[30:42] and then maybe this isn't gideon's mind
[30:44] battle but just as an example to show
[30:46] that how this just
[30:48] unravels and it spreads
[30:50] so gideon's up here trying to lead songs
[30:52] the minister's up here trying to preach
[30:55] and
[30:56] you're you're all locked up because
[30:58] you've been in a hurry and and the
[31:00] steam's all blown up and and you're just
[31:03] you're all just blown up and
[31:05] you know you just you don't got no more
[31:07] energy left you just you sit down in
[31:09] your seat and
[31:11] made it
[31:13] praise the lord
[31:15] i'm here
[31:18] that's what counts right is that we're
[31:20] in church
[31:24] and then poor gideon and poor ministers
[31:26] up here and we're trying to trudge and
[31:27] we're trying to we're trying to get
[31:29] through and
[31:30] and then satan starts working on our
[31:33] minds
[31:35] you thought you had a gift
[31:38] joke's on you
[31:42] you know i mean it's just and you say
[31:43] well
[31:44] brother well come on be real
[31:47] we're all human beings right
[31:49] but you know you see but i'm just saying
[31:51] and it spreads you know dad blows up at
[31:54] wife and the kids on the way to church
[31:56] and squelches the spirit there and then
[31:58] you know brother paul said it many times
[32:00] pulling the parking lot bless god we're
[32:02] going to have good service forgive me
[32:04] let's go into church
[32:06] spirit's already squelched
[32:11] it's life
[32:13] it's life right
[32:15] but
[32:16] it's just the things that that build up
[32:18] pressure in us
[32:21] people know that we're at the end
[32:24] why is there gross darkness on the
[32:26] people well one this nation rejected
[32:28] christ
[32:31] and they know that we're at the end even
[32:34] if they don't know that we're at the end
[32:36] they know we're at the end
[32:38] they might not be able to explain it
[32:40] like you and i can they don't they don't
[32:42] have the understanding that we do but
[32:44] we're at the coming of the lord
[32:48] something is fixing to happen and it
[32:49] causes people to be nervous
[32:52] prophet talked about a a deer you know
[32:55] eating or a lamb and it's and it's eaten
[32:57] and it's it's calm and it's serene and
[32:59] then all of a sudden it starts getting
[33:01] twitchy
[33:02] and it's and it's nervous and it keeps
[33:04] looking up and its ears keep going back
[33:06] and things and
[33:08] and it's because there's a predator
[33:09] coming up something's fixing to happen
[33:11] they don't know what it is
[33:13] they don't know where the lion's at
[33:15] but it's it's causing a nervous tension
[33:17] there's there's there's a sense in
[33:19] people that they know something's going
[33:21] wrong and the devil knows it too he
[33:23] knows his time is short
[33:26] so he turns up the heat on us
[33:30] now i want to give a couple examples
[33:35] satan brought jesus a battle in his mind
[33:37] of doubts or he tried to of who he was
[33:41] i think one of our greatest battles that
[33:43] we fight is is knowing who we are in
[33:46] christ
[33:48] but
[33:49] satan jesus
[33:51] went through that same mind battle
[33:54] because when satan came and tempted him
[33:55] in the wilderness in the desert he said
[33:58] if
[33:59] you really are the son of god
[34:02] do this
[34:04] if you are he didn't come and say you
[34:06] know what you're the son of god do this
[34:09] if if you really are
[34:12] if you really are a son and daughter of
[34:14] god
[34:15] if you really are a christian
[34:18] then you wouldn't be doing that
[34:20] if you really were then you'd be doing
[34:22] this
[34:24] you see the mind battle and jesus had to
[34:26] go through that same mind battle and
[34:28] overcome it by what the
[34:32] word did you know that satan gave jesus
[34:35] suicidal thoughts
[34:41] i should just leave that there
[34:47] satan gave jesus suicidal thoughts
[34:50] he took him up i think it was the third
[34:52] temptation on the highest point of the
[34:55] temple
[34:56] and told him to jump off
[35:00] can you imagine that
[35:02] how bold
[35:04] satan is
[35:07] and can you imagine if you've had those
[35:08] thoughts that jesus had them too
[35:12] that you're not the only person
[35:20] listen i'm i'm trying to bring you
[35:22] comfort tonight and i pray this is
[35:25] it's wednesday and we're all tired
[35:28] the maniac of gadira
[35:30] he needed jesus to come his way
[35:34] that was the source they tried medical
[35:36] science tried everything that they had
[35:38] knowledge to at the time
[35:41] even to binding him in chains that
[35:43] should hold a man who was being harmful
[35:45] to himself
[35:46] but the demons were so great on legion
[35:49] that he was breaking the chains medical
[35:51] science had no hold on this man
[35:54] but when jesus came
[35:57] the man received his deliverance
[36:02] the woman at the well had something in
[36:04] her spirit
[36:06] that locked her up and made her run
[36:07] after men
[36:11] she wasn't able to settle down and sit
[36:13] still
[36:15] her her her adulteries
[36:18] built up within her and and made her
[36:20] nervous
[36:22] drove her to do things she didn't want
[36:24] to be doing
[36:27] she wasn't able to settle down and sit
[36:29] still she wasn't able to be content
[36:32] seemingly she was afraid of something
[36:36] these are just my thoughts okay
[36:38] maybe afraid of commitment
[36:41] maybe afraid of giving her heart fully
[36:43] to someone
[36:46] so her answer her own answer was to run
[36:48] from it
[36:50] but she was running from the thing that
[36:52] she had a longing in her heart for
[36:55] was a desire for relationship in a safe
[36:58] relationship a consistent relationship
[37:00] somebody that would love her for for who
[37:02] she is and not for what they were
[37:05] getting out of the relationship
[37:08] but she and herself didn't know how to
[37:11] get it can you imagine just put yourself
[37:13] in her shoes for a minute
[37:15] the mind battles that this woman had had
[37:18] to go through
[37:21] not something deep down not really
[37:24] wanting to be what she was
[37:26] but not knowing how to get an escape out
[37:29] of it
[37:31] and and and that's just how we we get
[37:33] into situations sometimes
[37:36] often times
[37:38] i think it was james wrote off drawn
[37:40] away of your own lust
[37:43] but sometimes satan just ensnares you
[37:47] he he's a trickster he puts a little
[37:49] trap out there for you and you get
[37:51] ensnared by it but then when you get
[37:53] ensnared by it you don't know how to get
[37:55] out of it
[37:56] you feel stuck you feel
[37:59] nobody else is going through this nobody
[38:01] else is going to know what i'm going
[38:03] through nobody else has ever experienced
[38:05] this before
[38:07] when the bible says there's nothing new
[38:09] under the sun
[38:13] and i think it also says there's no
[38:15] temptation
[38:17] but what's common to man
[38:19] paraphrasing a little bit there
[38:22] so this woman didn't know she was locked
[38:24] in this in this
[38:28] unfortunate world to herself in her own
[38:31] mind
[38:32] but then jesus came
[38:35] that was the answer the people thought
[38:37] they had the answer well let's put shame
[38:40] on her
[38:41] maybe if we shame her she'll get out of
[38:43] this situation she'll realize what she's
[38:45] doing is wrong
[38:47] we'll put her going to the well at a
[38:48] different time than everyone else you
[38:50] know this was man's concoctions of how
[38:52] to deal with this woman's heart
[38:55] but then jesus came along
[38:58] and jesus dealt with the heart issue
[39:04] the prophet of our day was a neurotic
[39:09] what a pressure to be under
[39:11] to be a leader
[39:14] to be
[39:15] sensitive to god and his people at every
[39:18] moment
[39:19] god
[39:20] wanted to use you
[39:22] god wants to use us
[39:24] but imagine the pressure knowing maybe
[39:27] not fully knowing what was going on but
[39:29] knowing what was going on knowing what
[39:31] his position was in this age
[39:34] as god unfolded it that pressure the
[39:37] neurotic that it would it would just
[39:39] build up the pressure until he said
[39:41] that's why he had to go hunting
[39:43] get away from people
[39:45] so that they weren't pulling on the
[39:46] spirit on the gift
[39:49] get away get out enjoy nature enjoy god
[39:52] what did he say he'd go do more than
[39:54] hunting is just get alone with god
[39:57] what was the prophet's answer for the
[39:59] neurotic state that he felt get alone
[40:02] with god
[40:04] are you catching this tonight
[40:09] so this this kept burning on my heart
[40:11] i'm almost done
[40:15] do you have those quotes did you get
[40:17] them
[40:20] i see you
[40:22] a thumbs up hold up
[40:25] monitors go ahead and pull that first
[40:27] one up
[40:32] so i'm going to read through this and
[40:33] then i'm just going to maybe i'll
[40:34] comment on it after that
[40:37] she had two lovely daughters and she
[40:38] married a fine man a brother huff and he
[40:41] was a millwright
[40:43] he'd had it one of his fingers and
[40:44] thumbs cut off a very nice brother and
[40:46] they had two they had twins and another
[40:49] girl making three children
[40:50] and the twins were staunch christians
[40:53] they were ube people but they really
[40:55] believed god and so they won little
[41:01] one little girl going to school she got
[41:03] a complex
[41:04] watch this now watch this scenario
[41:08] the girls tell her
[41:10] well why don't you smoke like we do you
[41:12] think you're better than we are why
[41:14] don't you go to dances
[41:16] now they didn't go to dances nor neither
[41:18] did they smoke or drink and they made
[41:20] fun of the healthier girl she could just
[41:23] say hump let them jump in a river
[41:26] i'm the one serving christ
[41:28] they don't want to let them go ahead
[41:32] so that's one personality okay
[41:35] but the other one she began to think
[41:38] well maybe i could do something and she
[41:40] built a complex and got nervous
[41:44] she went insane
[41:48] she's 18 years old a genius
[41:51] only 18 years old
[41:53] and this is the situation that brother
[41:55] branham's dealing with
[41:58] she one of those perfectionists
[42:01] gotta watch it
[42:02] myself
[42:04] she even teaches opera and plays
[42:06] overtures and teaches music at 18 years
[42:08] old see just a real smart girl
[42:11] look at the the qualities that god put
[42:13] in her and satan's trying to take that
[42:17] and so she a real good christian and
[42:18] they couldn't understand it they was
[42:20] country people way back out in the
[42:22] country
[42:24] and the other girls would talk about her
[42:26] so this is another spot actually
[42:29] so what we just read was
[42:31] after the prophet had wet and dealt with
[42:33] the the situation
[42:35] and then this is before
[42:37] and the other girls would talk about her
[42:38] you know the two girls and tell them how
[42:41] they were
[42:42] what part of life they were missing and
[42:44] how they should live like the rest of
[42:45] the girls and one girl was able to just
[42:48] to override it
[42:49] this other one had a complex and she
[42:51] felt real bad about it and just kept
[42:54] going away
[42:56] and drifting further back and is
[42:58] worrying about it and finally she's
[43:01] she's got a
[43:02] mental breakdown
[43:04] and she's in an insane ward
[43:07] this is just skipping through the quotes
[43:09] here now the girl there's no physical
[43:11] break in the girl
[43:13] there's no physical she's perfectly
[43:15] healthy but it's so hard to explain
[43:18] and it really cannot be explained what
[43:21] it is her spirit has wandered
[43:25] now you got to catch her spirit
[43:28] and bring it back to the place see and
[43:31] she just a little they raised those
[43:33] children to serve the lord and put them
[43:35] in school and they were really grounded
[43:37] in christ not to do the things that's
[43:39] wrong
[43:40] but there it went now what i'm catching
[43:42] from this was i was reading it
[43:44] is the one girl could just blow it off
[43:47] i'm a christian i'm serving christ i'm
[43:49] going forward with god
[43:51] but this other girl had a different
[43:52] personality
[43:54] okay
[43:56] she had a different personality and the
[43:58] pressure was just too much for and so
[44:00] what i'm reading in between the lines
[44:02] catching here is that she gave in and
[44:05] started out and doing the things that
[44:07] they were telling her she should be
[44:09] doing to have a good time
[44:11] and then that brings the con that brings
[44:13] condemnation
[44:15] conviction
[44:16] right
[44:17] condemnation and then she gets stuck in
[44:20] that and it makes you nervous
[44:22] condemnation will make you nervous satan
[44:24] will make you nervous by condemning you
[44:27] and then she just she gets to worrying
[44:29] about it but maybe she's in that
[44:30] tailspin of not knowing how to get out
[44:32] of it
[44:33] and so she just gets worrying so much
[44:36] until she has a mental breakdown a
[44:38] nervous breakdown
[44:41] so uh where are we at so
[44:43] now this is another situation he tells
[44:45] of look just a few moments ago and gazed
[44:48] back to a little boy had the very same
[44:50] thing exactly
[44:56] and at
[44:58] we we went there one night a brother
[45:00] writes in oroville as the boy's name was
[45:02] just a com a complete break
[45:05] and he you know when he tried to run out
[45:08] run me out of the house as good of a
[45:09] friend as orville and i are just real
[45:12] like i'd be his father i married his
[45:14] father and mother together and he's just
[45:16] jump up and scream get out of here get
[45:18] out of here get out of here see so
[45:21] brother bradham said it wasn't no longer
[45:23] the boy
[45:24] he was he was dealing with the the boy
[45:26] had a nervous breakdown he had a he had
[45:28] a mental break this wasn't he was acting
[45:30] out of the ordinary
[45:33] now what we had to do there was go out
[45:35] into the line of spirit and catch that
[45:37] boy's spirit see
[45:39] a lot of grief watch these things
[45:42] go back
[45:44] a lot of grief had come to his little
[45:47] heart
[45:49] he's young and he had seen a lot
[45:52] and just brought him right back to the
[45:54] place where he should be
[45:56] you see in a few days
[46:00] he was all right now that's the same
[46:02] thing you got to do on this this other
[46:04] case i have seen it and i know that it's
[46:06] true but now i request you all to pray
[46:09] now that god will help me to find this
[46:11] little girl out into a place where she
[46:14] don't know where she's at then bring her
[46:16] back to her place that avenue comes
[46:18] through faith
[46:23] she can't have faith for herself
[46:26] she don't know where she's at or
[46:28] anything see it's got to take our faith
[46:32] here
[46:34] now you have these two situations
[46:37] and it's grief piled up on these young
[46:40] hearts
[46:42] and that grief became overwhelming for
[46:45] them
[46:46] and they didn't know what to do with it
[46:47] and it just it got them so worried and
[46:49] nervous that it broke them up it broke
[46:51] their mind
[46:53] had a nervous breakdown
[46:55] took on complexes and things
[46:57] but you watched the answer in each
[46:59] situation
[47:01] with the girl brother branham said he's
[47:03] the holy spirit revealed to him she was
[47:06] just blank staring at him said she
[47:08] looked beautiful big big eyes and things
[47:11] but she was just looking at him empty
[47:14] and he said when the holy spirit came on
[47:16] the scene
[47:17] it went back into her spirit and caught
[47:20] her and brought her back to herself
[47:23] and he the the gal's name was margaret
[47:25] and he said margaret
[47:27] you always wanted to marry a preacher
[47:29] since you were a little girl
[47:33] we don't i don't understand these things
[47:35] fully but brother branham had to take
[47:37] her the holy spirit
[47:40] not brother branham
[47:42] the holy spirit who's still alive today
[47:46] had to take that young girl back to a
[47:49] time
[47:50] when she was pure
[47:52] before she had gotten tainted by the
[47:55] things of the world before back when she
[47:57] had a pure desire that was really her
[48:01] she really wanted to grow up and marry a
[48:04] minister and the spirit took her back to
[48:07] that spot
[48:09] because it was truth
[48:11] inside of her heart
[48:13] so
[48:14] what am i i'm trying to get to you
[48:16] tonight is the answer for these mind
[48:19] battles and things
[48:21] you shall know the truth and the truth
[48:23] shall set you free
[48:27] to get into the spirit
[48:30] to walk after the spirit not after the
[48:34] flesh
[48:35] is how we keep from breaking up
[48:38] to to to run after god
[48:41] you say well you're making you know
[48:44] i'm not trying to make something
[48:45] spiritual out of natural things
[48:48] but
[48:49] if you have an ailment in your body you
[48:51] need healing
[48:53] what's the answer
[48:55] go to prayer
[48:58] be obedient to the word come forward let
[49:01] us lay hands on you anoint you with oil
[49:03] because the the bible says that the
[49:05] prayer of faith shall save the sick
[49:08] amen
[49:09] you you turn to the word
[49:17] i just want to make sure i say this
[49:22] all right so we're almost there almost
[49:23] done so i just want to comment a couple
[49:25] more things
[49:26] so you watch the two different
[49:28] personalities in these nature of those
[49:30] girls
[49:31] and maybe as babies
[49:33] you know because you can watch little
[49:35] kids and you can pick up on things and
[49:36] their personality as as they start
[49:39] getting older
[49:40] maybe as babies one was a leader and the
[49:42] other more of a follower
[49:45] one cares what others think
[49:48] they're more shy or timid maybe they
[49:50] want to fit in
[49:52] you know
[49:53] country people they he said they're
[49:54] country people they might not have had a
[49:56] lot
[49:57] so they want to fit in so they see all
[49:59] the other things that the other the
[50:00] other kids have
[50:02] to one it's no big deal who cares
[50:05] but to the other it meant something
[50:10] looking for acceptance doesn't want to
[50:12] hurt anyone's feelings
[50:14] maybe a peacemaker
[50:16] then he said she was a perfectionist
[50:19] she was nervous she
[50:21] she she worried you know a
[50:24] perfectionist can be good in one sense
[50:27] but then in the other you you it makes
[50:29] you worry
[50:30] you do get nervous just by having that
[50:33] quality trait in you
[50:37] but i just thought it was interesting
[50:38] the spirit wonders and you got to catch
[50:40] the spirit bring it back
[50:45] so
[50:48] in summary of how we overcome these
[50:50] things
[50:51] you with me just a couple more minutes
[50:56] we take our burdens to him
[50:58] and let off the pressure through prayer
[51:01] like brother tony was preaching
[51:04] take it to the lord and leave it
[51:06] there have yet when's the last time
[51:11] that that you really spent some time in
[51:14] prayer
[51:15] and the thing that's been bothering you
[51:17] and that you feel that pressure building
[51:19] up when's the last time that you just
[51:22] knelt before god and
[51:25] and let it out
[51:29] or
[51:30] does the neurotic age have us so busy we
[51:32] can't find time for that
[51:38] what's another way to overcome these
[51:40] mind battles to get into his presence
[51:45] i'm going to say it's important to come
[51:47] to church
[51:50] but you have a right as a christian
[51:53] to pull his presence down when you're
[51:55] not at church too
[51:59] now we balance those things out because
[52:01] now somebody's thinking well then what
[52:03] do i got to come to church for if i can
[52:04] bring his presence down at home
[52:06] will you stay out of church for a while
[52:08] and let me know how that goes
[52:12] get in his presence
[52:15] doubts when you're having doubts of who
[52:16] you are i love the scripture in romans
[52:20] because it says when you have doubts of
[52:22] who you are get into his presence and
[52:25] hear his word
[52:27] because the inward man
[52:29] the spirit that he's that christ has
[52:31] placed in you
[52:32] something answers back to the word
[52:35] that's being preached and says amen
[52:38] so you think you know man i don't i
[52:39] don't have i don't have the holy ghost
[52:42] i'm not a christian
[52:43] i i'm on the verge of leaving i i've
[52:46] sent away my day of grace but then when
[52:48] the when the words coming forward
[52:50] and you hear the preacher say but that
[52:53] you haven't sinned away your day of
[52:54] grace if there's something on the inside
[52:57] that that still desires god then you
[52:59] haven't send your day
[53:01] a way of grace and something on the
[53:03] inside of you says amen
[53:06] now listen to me i've had it
[53:09] mind battle
[53:10] and the preaching of the word goes
[53:12] forward
[53:13] and your spirit is saying amen to every
[53:16] word that's being preached you feel
[53:18] encouraged you feel you feel power of
[53:20] the spirit
[53:22] and minutes later
[53:24] those thoughts come right back
[53:27] and you start feeling you start losing
[53:29] those feelings that came over you
[53:31] when the inward man was saying amen
[53:34] you know what you do
[53:36] think back to two minutes ago
[53:39] when you know that you said amen on the
[53:42] inside
[53:43] amen
[53:45] amen
[53:49] we're a three-part being
[53:52] body and spirit are the inlets to the
[53:55] soul
[53:56] and the soul is the is the inner is
[53:58] where the inner man is
[54:00] the soul is either where faith or word
[54:03] outlie
[54:05] and i and this never really took hold
[54:07] when i'm listening to the greatest
[54:08] battle ever fought until i was listening
[54:10] to it this time
[54:12] and the prophet was explaining
[54:16] and these are just my own words to try
[54:17] to
[54:18] condense and simplify what we have to do
[54:21] is remove all of the senses you got to
[54:24] get all the senses out of the picture
[54:26] forget how you're feeling right now
[54:30] just let the word come down that channel
[54:32] of your thoughts and meet your soul
[54:35] where free will is
[54:38] because then when it meets the free will
[54:41] and that inward man says amen that's
[54:43] accepting the word
[54:45] get rid of all the senses and just let
[54:48] let
[54:49] let the word meet your soul for a little
[54:51] bit
[54:52] amen
[54:54] and choose the word it's j it's that
[54:56] simple
[54:57] choose the word
[54:59] if you have sickness the prophet said
[55:00] commit your case to god and go on as if
[55:03] it was all over
[55:04] don't dwell on it the best that you can
[55:07] we can turn it over and over and over in
[55:10] our minds and get nervous
[55:12] it's got to be cancer
[55:14] i am going to die
[55:16] i say that kind of jokingly but you know
[55:19] those are real thoughts
[55:22] for for me
[55:23] i i lean too far the other way
[55:26] where i
[55:27] not that i go where i'm looking for
[55:29] death how do you say that without it
[55:30] sounding so bad
[55:32] but paul said for me to live as christ
[55:36] but to die is gain
[55:39] when when you know
[55:41] that
[55:42] when that you have a body waiting
[55:44] already on the other side
[55:47] there becomes a longing
[55:50] there then then you can start singing
[55:52] beulah land
[55:54] i'm longing for you
[55:56] i'm i'm homesick
[56:00] because there's something on the inside
[56:02] that knows that this is not the real
[56:04] thing
[56:09] amen you can stand to your feet
[56:16] i pray something tonight was a help to
[56:18] you
[56:23] i can promise you i don't get up just to
[56:24] be heard
[56:33] and i wonder just um
[56:35] if the musicians want to play something
[56:37] soft
[56:44] and if you want to bow your head
[56:45] sometimes it's easier to lift your hands
[56:47] with knowing everybody's
[56:49] heads are bowed and eyes are closed
[56:52] and if you just want to lift up your
[56:53] hand and and say
[56:56] not to me but to god and say lord i i
[56:58] need to let off the pressure
[57:01] the pressure's getting too great
[57:04] amen god bless you
[57:06] my hands are raised too
[57:09] the pressure is just too great i feel
[57:11] like i'm i feel like i'm coming apart at
[57:13] the seams
[57:17] i wonder i wonder if you could just
[57:19] picture yourself coming before god just
[57:21] now
[57:24] and and get out of your mind don't don't
[57:26] let this be
[57:28] a picture of god on a a great big throne
[57:32] that you come and you're so tiny in
[57:34] front of
[57:35] [Music]
[57:36] think of this as is
[57:39] jesus
[57:40] [Music]
[57:42] and he kneels down because you're
[57:44] kneeling down in the altar of your heart
[57:46] [Music]
[57:48] and you're just saying
[57:50] lord i can't i don't know how much more
[57:52] i can take
[57:55] and jesus kneels down beside you and
[57:58] wraps his arms around you and pulls you
[58:00] up to his chest
[58:02] [Music]
[58:03] and for just a moment
[58:06] let it be just you and god
[58:10] forget the pressures of life
[58:12] if something keeps coming to your mind
[58:14] right now it keeps you just
[58:17] brother brandon i can't get my mind to
[58:18] settle why don't you tell god about it
[58:20] right now
[58:23] let christ have that
[58:26] give it to him tell him tell him about
[58:28] it
[58:31] jesus just wraps his arms around you and
[58:34] hugs you real tight
[58:37] you know maybe maybe you've never had a
[58:39] tight hug
[58:42] but just just picture a tight hug
[58:44] wrapping you in his arms
[58:48] and he just whispers sweetly i care
[58:53] i care
[58:54] give it to him
[58:56] heavenly father we come before you lord
[59:01] and lord sometimes god we know that
[59:03] you're simple
[59:07] god you hide yourself in simplicity and
[59:09] you reveal yourself in simplicity
[59:13] and so we know that the answers are
[59:14] simple but sometimes lord it seems so
[59:17] hard
[59:19] it's so hard to release our cares to you
[59:21] sometimes
[59:26] sometimes it's just the way that we're
[59:27] bent it's the it's the way
[59:30] that our personality is or the way that
[59:32] we're natured
[59:35] but father you made us that way and you
[59:37] made us that way for a purpose so
[59:40] help us lord
[59:42] we just ask for your help god when we
[59:44] can't give it to you fully
[59:47] we don't know how we don't know what
[59:49] that looks like
[59:50] [Music]
[59:52] father help us lord help us to let it go
[59:56] and i pray jesus love every heart god
[1:00:02] love every heart in here
[1:00:06] love them god until they just give it to
[1:00:08] you
[1:00:12] bless each one now
[1:00:14] in jesus christ's name
[1:00:18] amen
[1:00:21] amen
[1:00:23] if you need prayer i'm happy to pray
[1:00:24] with you but
[1:00:26] why don't you just you can be dismissed
[1:00:28] if you got to go but why don't you just
[1:00:30] just give it a few minutes
[1:00:33] and in the busyness of the day and the
[1:00:35] busyness of life why don't you just
[1:00:36] close your eyes and lift your hands
[1:00:40] and just
[1:00:41] just have a moment with the lord
[1:00:45] just take take the time
[1:00:48] your bed will be there when you get home
[1:00:52] just take a few minutes and just
[1:00:55] just let yourself just let god bathe you
[1:00:58] in his presence
[1:01:01] amen god bless you tonight
