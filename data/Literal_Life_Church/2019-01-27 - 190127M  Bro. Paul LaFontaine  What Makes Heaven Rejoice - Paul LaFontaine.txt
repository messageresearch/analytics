Description:
Continuing his series on the parables of Luke 15, Bro. Paul deals with the question of what makes heaven rejoice, and he challenges us to examine our own joys – are they aligned with heaven’s? Bro. Paul takes us through the scriptures as he surveys the various things that make heaven rejoice, and he speaks at length from the parables of Luke 15, which reveal the repentance of sinners to be one of heaven’s chiefest joys. Repentance is the only foundation from which God can work in someone’s life. He preaches against pride which suffocates all repentance, and he exhorts the church to never reach a place where you need no repentance. For if you’ve lost the ability to repent, heaven no longer rejoices over your life. May the Lord help us to keep tender hearts in a day when many hearts have gone cold!

========================================
live [Music] he was [Music] yeah can we stand can we sing this from my heart this morning to the Lord Lord I want to live the way you want me to live I want you the way just the way you want me to live Lord oh I want you until just [Music] there's just no for I could never [Music] amen amen amen praise the Lord let's turn in our Bibles this morning if you would to Luke chapter 15 and of course we want to welcome all of you here to gather with us today in this warm place and we had to cancel last Sunday has a lot of churches do when we have this weather in the winter and we probably in some ways should have canceled the road out here wasn't good out in the country but I think if we to cancel this morning we had a revolt as we all want to get to church so we're glad to be here and we're thankful for that God's given us this place to be able to come sister Inez asked for prayer this morning I don't know if they mention it in the prayer request but she called a little while ago and she fell this weekend so she's in some pain from that fall and she wasn't able to make it this morning so remember if he would sister Inez before the Lord and then we just want to pray for brother Brandon who's speaking away today brother ray excuse me brother Sam Browning's ministering away so let's keep him in prayer on the third Sunday of February weather permitting we're going to have brother ray Erickson here speaking for us and we're looking forward to that brother ray has become a real friend to me and also just a real stability I believe to the Lima area through the years his faithfulness is consistency and I appreciate him so much I learned a lot from him so this would be the first time I think in many years we've had them we're looking forward to have him speak for that Sunday let's pray the weather stays good for us and then we'll have a little couples fellowship sweetheart fellowship just after that we'll have a meal over here at the st. Michael's Lutheran and brother ray is gonna speak to the couples so we're looking forward to that as well we'll send out a flyer on that here in the next couple days so you have all the information and we're looking forward to that we just pray we can be able to do that I just ask for your grace and your tolerance to the back area here in the next week or so Ike's gonna be taking out this sound booth area so we can have some more seating in the back so just have tolerance there in our mess that we have and we're just gonna try to get that done as soon as we can for the young people they're having a banquet down brother Nathan Erickson is having a banquet down in Finley I believe it is coming up February 9th and I think you got a register for that right away so remember that date if you would and we encourage you to go to that banquet I think it'll be a good one it's a lot of youth coming out so I just pray for that and God be with young people that gathered together for that brother Daryl Townsend has your receipts today for your giving from last year and I want to say I appreciate him for doing all that for me because I cannot stand doing anything tax related this is a depressing time of year when you have to do all that I'm sure all you just love it know what you love doing that stuff but he takes care of some of those things that we appreciate him taking the time he's in a very busy schedule himself taking care of the just his business first of all and where he works and then to take on the extra church stuff we just appreciate so much and all the trustees and treasures and everything we had a little problem this week with the septic we've had to get worked on they're gonna be working on it more tomorrow and you can imagine the cold temperatures that they have to work in to be able to fix that but it is become a problem we have to deal with and last last Wednesday we had some leak or something down in the basement and I want to say I appreciate brother Henry taking his day out of his regular work schedule and fixing that problem with the same and brother Tom out here almost the whole day so you don't see some of these things but I want to show appreciation to some of the office and the church that do things in between their work schedules and sacrifice and so we appreciate it very much we have a brother art with us this morning and my wife and I have of course up homecare business and one of the facilities we service are we do a little Bible study there every what is it Tuesday mornings and so are several people come out when we studied the Bible you know the art has a real love for the word and he's with us this morning this service I want to welcome you art to our service this morning god bless you good to have you amen real hunger for the Word of God and we just pray that we could encourage him and those things praise the Lord we're reading from Luke chapter 15 and we'll start reading in verse 1 you love the Lord today amen then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him and the Pharisees inscribed murmured saying this man receiveth sinners and eateth with them and that was already wrong because he didn't really go out to them or he didn't ask them they came to Jesus and they felt comfortable enough to get around Jesus all that we would live lives that even the sinner is comfortable to be around us can you say man that's our Lord there and they came to him and wanted to be around him but the Pharisees criticized it and they went on to say this man receiveth sinners and eateth with him and he spake this parable unto them saying and in the next chapter he gives three parables related to this whole subject of the lost sheep or the lost coin or the prodigal son in other words putting emphasis that the church world and the religious people putting emphasis and the people that were already there and their place that they stood but not reaching out to someone who's a lost sheep so these the first parable reread a few weeks ago what man of you having a hundred sheep if he lose one of them does not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness and go after that which was lost until he find it and when he had found it he layeth it on his shoulders rejoicing and when he cometh home he call it together his friends and neighbors saying unto them rejoice with me for how I found my sheep which was lost I say unto you that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth more than over ninety and nine just persons which need no repentance so I don't even know if this is just believers as such but these is a catechist is a category of people we can think of the 99 is the people that are already saved in here but these are people that are just persons among to themselves and here's the big problem they don't need repentance that's a serious state to be in so you got to see the emphasis here is this this is not a kind of the Baptist has made this thing leave the ninety-nine and go out reaching to thee and I believe in doing that but you got to realize that with the subject use is not just the sinner comes but but that there's true repentance in that heart and heaven rejoices over true repentance can you say Amen and the other guys they're there but there's no repentance in their heart even though they themselves are just persons so either what and then he goes into this here verse eight either what having ten pieces of silver if she lose one piece if not light a candle and sweep the house and seek diligently till she find it and when she has found it she calleth her friends and neighbors together saying rejoice with me I want you to notice today the rejoicing that takes place when a lost sheep or lost coin is found there's joy there's rejoicing I have found the peace was I lost likewise I saying to you there is joy in the presence of angels of God over one sinner that repenteth father bless your word today and may you God bring the anointing upon us and we have prayed yesterday Lord this morning and just laying our lives before you and Father we are looking to you each of our lives are as we enter these times that we live in Lord where we know that there are things Lord that will take place more and more that God bring us to our knees and bring us to more of a dependence on you and one thing Lord we learned about living here in America that we have so many things that we can depend on it tends to remove our need for God Lord we don't want to live that way we're not called to be Laodiceans we don't want to depend on our income or depend on the social kiss that Social Security or depend on things of this life lord help us if the Americans Lord to learn to depend on you and to say to you Lord we need you more than we've ever needed you before god I pray that you'll inspire and anoint us today and we feel feeble in our own strength Lord we just don't feel capable of meeting the needs that are here and on the internet and the places that are listening but Lord there's a source this morning there's a fountain that we can drink from there's a fountain of life that Lord has a source of life and every need in every habit and everything Lord that we find in this life that we can't seem to overcome Lord you've given us a place to drink of your fountain and all we depend on that this morning we feel humbled to be here we pray you bless our time of fellowship in your word today in Jesus name we ask it amen does she maybe see did let me know Ike when I when you get this mic working you got it good okay so I want to speak a little bit today while we are here and I guess we're here because we don't want to be out there can you say man so I have kind of its kind of like a prison ministry I have a captive audience president ministry has a captive audience you know praise the Lord and we're thank the Lord for the heat we have heat this morning I want to we're looking at these parables here that's in Luke chapter 15 but I want to just stop for a moment and as we we want to move on to the other two parables in the chapter but over the last couple weeks as we've been out we have been thinking about these scriptures and thinking about what we brought the first of the year here concerning finding the lost sheep and and these different things but I can't seem to get over not speaking and taking a service or two about number one about repentance but also this rejoicing that takes place in this joy that takes place over when someone comes back to the Lord or when someone comes and has offers true repentance to God and it's been turning some thoughts within me as we see that the the rejoicing that took place was first of all in heaven and it's it's caused me to ask the question and i i've trust that you'll just ask it with me this morning and then we'll take the scriptures and answer this but I've been asking from this scripture what makes heaven rejoice what is it that makes heaven rejoice what brings joy in heaven and this scripture is an example of what brings joy in heaven but as I look this isn't the only thing that brings joy in heaven so I was asking what brings joy in heaven and then also asking what makes us rejoice what brings joy to your life what brings joy to a believer and I think that as we grow in the Lord I think the source of our joy and I think our rejoicing should match what they rejoice in in heaven because if we have a great separation in that that we're taking our joy in life out of a bunch of other things but it doesn't get heaven happy at all then I think there's a huge separation there and I think I would become interested what makes heaven rejoice what turns up the heart of God what what moves the heart of God and what makes the Angels rejoice and I begin to look at these places yesterday in the scripture to see what is it that makes heaven rejoice because I think that we should be growing they say Lord that's what I want to be as the source of my joy and what makes me happy in life I don't want a worldly view of what makes me happy I want to I don't want to draw my source from the same sources as the world but I want to rejoice in the same thing reject Heaven is rejoicing over can I get another Amen on that I want to have my life so it should be the same whatever makes heaven rejoice is what I want my life to rejoice in and to grow because we can take our joy from a lot of sources and I find in this as we've studied that that what gives a believer joy is completely different than what the world and I know you know this but I'm reminding us that what gives the believer joy is completely different than what gives the world joy in matter of fact some of the things that brings a believer joy and makes them happy and content and just really brings those feelings of on the inside of true joy and happiness they tend to be strange things to the world in other words strange things make a believer happy strange things bring joy to a believer where the world would laugh at you and mock at you and say why are you happy about that why is you happy where are you so happy since you left and you're it's Monday morning and you got a smile on your face and you're excited and you got to skip in your step and God has done something for you and got a spoke something to you that's really real and they can see it on your face they can see it in your life they can see it in your body language and they ask what what was that well God I would you know my favorite time this week you tell them in testimony my favorite time this week was when we were in the house of God yesterday and gods residence was so real they're gonna look at you pretty crazy because the world draws their source of joy from different sources can you say ma'am and it's strange to a believer where we get our source of joy but it's strange to the world what makes a believer happy I just want to make sure that we're drawing our joy from the right source because the the world does off for joys the world also offers peace jesus said i give you peace not as the world gives peace which lets us know the world has a peace it can give you how many know the world has a peace how many know the world has joys but you see I don't give you what they give you I give you an eternal peace I give you something that comes from another dimension I give you something that's not on the level at all with what the world can give can I just can you say Amen this morning so I don't want to spend too much time on the world's Joy's I will talk about them a little bit and I don't want to spend too much time because you are well you are well versed in what the world has to offer as far as its joy and things that bring you happiness we are well you know why we're so well-versed at it we know why we know it so well because we're the television generation we're the media generation where Satan has access to all those things to to manipulate the human being so much and manipulate even our responses now Satan has used them that's a social media and television and different things to manipulate the human being brother Matt Watkins at the retreat read an article that I'd like to send you a read from here I having a chance to send it to you yet but how that science has really come to that now that there are specific companies that are hired by Google and different ones and they admit clearly that the original gender this for advertising is to get to manipulate the human being to lean them a certain way to change their thoughts on something course to make them buy more things and so they know how you tick they know how you work in your mind or how you think they know much better than even you know it I guarantee you they have studied the human being now for hundreds of years and they know how you tick you know how that I don't know how you function and so now there's a clear agenda by Satan's tools in order to manipulate so my point this morning is that they have manipulated by TV and social media and have taught us the things that will give you real joy they have taught us the things to pursue that will bring you real happiness and so that's the type of world we live in that's that's that's I don't have to say much about that because you're so aware because we've been so taught and it's been so planted in our minds if you if you if watched television even when you're a kid most of the commercials if not all of them are meant of course to sell something but if you look at the majority of the commercials it's it's what the what they're putting out there and emphasizing most the time is what they're putting out this will make you happy this will make you joyful this vacation spot so you see a scene of a vacation spot you see a scene of cars new cars because that's that there's more commercials on cars than anything else they throw this out there throw that now they throw medicines out there because this is your answer to it this is your answer to being relieved of your sickness whatever it is so everything is to put out there is that you will be content you will be happy this is what you need to pursue to order to be happy so now we we're now years being filled with this stuff and even as believers you can't get around it it's around us all the time I just asked you to be careful as a believer that we don't buy into this whole cycle can you say man I don't think we need to have guards over our minds can you say man because the teaching gets into us and causes us to reach out for things to get joy out of and for a believer who has the Holy Ghost he gets burned every time because he finds emptiness in anything other than the presence of God in his word praise the Lord so we people will go through those cycles even though they've been hearing preachers talk about it and tell them about it for years they'll keep you know getting burnt by it until they have to realize you have to feed your soul the Word of God the Holy Ghost only feeds on the Word of God and you draw your true joy and I'm talking about true joy this morning there are of life there are natural joys of life I enjoy my family I enjoy being with them I enjoy my children someday hopefully I'll enjoy grandchildren hint hint you know you know I there are things that I enjoy doing you're saying I'm not gonna take time to meet others the things in life that I enjoy doing some of your brothers enjoy hunting but the brand enjoy hunting so I don't enjoy hunting but some of you enjoy it and and then I enjoy the benefit when you kill a deer and give it to me every way I can kill a deers run over it and I still don't know how to deal with it when I run over it I'm not what to do you know see what's blood but we have natural joys of life and there's not a thing wrong for us to enjoy those things can you say Matt then we have the world's offers for joys to run after things and so we've got to navigate through all this and say lord help us because the tendency is even for believers to start slowing you don't even recognize when you're getting off track where you're starting your joint you to take your the fullness of your joy or the your contentment you lean towards family and is there something wrong with that there's not anything wrong with it except for if it takes you away from the word and it takes you away from God's places where he gives us joy so you said you say well I haven't done that or maybe I'm doing that now don't make me feel bad about I'm not trying to make you feel bad I'm saying as if you're a believer you have to be on your toes because we don't we unconsciously we don't catch it sometimes when we're slowly turning towards something that we're drawing peace out of and contentment out of and all of a sudden at the end of it it brings emptiness if you draw your joy out of what people say about you and everybody has to like you or how many lights you get on social media you're going to be a depressed person eventually on depression medicine and there's hundreds of cases it says everybody's on depression now because they draw their source of joy of how many likes they get and I'm not only saying that we're not called to be a statistic we're not called to buy into this can you say man and possessions and and new clothes and new cars and women the pressure and women to to dress in a way just sexy enough for a man to notice you I don't want to commit adultery with them but I want men to notice me so you dress just sexy enough and you draw your comfort and joy from that you jaw draw your your joy out of that I'm just mentioning some things our joy often depends if enough people like us how many likes we get if we can get what we want in life then it makes us happy and a lot of the new generation to get what they want they they are happy if our team if our basketball team our football team makes the playoffs that brings a joy to people they're making the playoffs is to make a championship and beat it boy that really brings the joy and I'm amazed at how many Christians and how they act when they're supporting and joyful over their team that's winning because I'm gonna say that I cannot believe that that much emotion comes out of a person who sits like a bump on the log when the presence of the Lord is speaking revelation of the word there's something wrong with that picture praise the Lord amen Wow where's this coming from I didn't know they had joy they got joy over their team they're going crazy and I'm not necessarily condemning you for that I'm only saying there's an imbalance because they're your life is centered around looking to the expectation of what your team does and there's not much expectation for when the next service is coming up or when you're gonna read your Bible the next morning you're not might not even read your Bible but your expectations what can the Lord show me today and your hearts well with joy with what he showed you where is it at and I'm just saying when we get off track we've got to be the one to say now wait a minute I'm not a statistic I'm not like this world I want to draw my joy from the joy of the Lord because the joy of the Lord is my strength the rest brings weakness can you say Amen praise the Lord possessions all these other things a new album from your favorite group is coming out and new movies coming out missing the worldly things the new updated grand theft or for tonight obsession obsession the thing that churns they announced it Apple announced the new iPhone glory and and so it's for the world now and hopefully not us we become basically robots and they're putting the carrot out in front of the stick because we've already ended this story we've already played all this fortnight and so the only thing to keep us going is to put a carrot out there so that we can look forward to the next joy that's coming I want to say I don't think we should live that way and I've just died especially when it says the days of Noah when it promotes the worst violence that you can promote how can a believer sit there and play that and not be affected by it they're all being affected by it and you're not I say y'all late at the altar and lay it down because in the days of Noah they become violent and there's a reason to become violent today we have helped to make us more violent and that Satanist teaches that violence is normal and eventually people have a violent spirit the next fortnight to have a spa and to get a new color on my toenails or my fingernails talk about joys of life or a new color in my hair almost all of mankind has been put on this cycle of this stuff for the last some 80 years and I say that because we've always had temptations but we've all that in the last 80 some years there's been a change in manipulating the human being and Satan knows it and he's manipulated me in the sense that he's taught them where they get their next joy and that's what to look forward to to make you happy and we become just numb robots who keep following in this running on this treadmill or keeping this cyclists stuff that what's the next thing in what's the next thing it's taught us to live like they live can you say men and so in this part by saying I don't think that these are the source of our joy as believers and shame on us if it becomes our complete social source of joy we are not called to be like them the holy ghost changes a person you may be in your flesh but the Holy Ghost takes over your flesh can I get an amen the Holy Ghost is meant to lead your life out of these things and find you sources of joy that are in the Lord praise the Lord brother Branham says what makes a man to get drunk it's a quote what makes a man get drunk what makes people want to act the way they do the world what would a person stay home on Wednesday night from a prayer meeting to watch a certain television program are these good questions what would they do that for is because there's something in them that desires to be satisfied they want there's a little place in a man's heart or a woman's heart and God made the place for himself how dare you try to make this take the things of the world and put in there where God made for himself to get to sit there God is our joy God is our pleasure God is our satisfaction that's where it belongs in here let God in and then the other things are so dead you don't even care nothing about them no more he says in the token and in him is the fullness in him as all the sufficiency that we have need of he is my pleasure he is my life he is my joy can you say mine he is more not no I don't have to put I don't have to puff on a cigarette to get some kind of relief I take the lily of the valley he is the opium he is the thing that makes me walk in the clouds I say praise the Lord it's the opioid epidemic and it's all tied to people looking for a relief from life epidemic in our area Toledo is one of the worse than that were in the world people dying every day from addiction of it and all it goes the same as the cigarette brother brems already said somebody's looking for satisfaction and he has a lily of the valley he is the opium praise the Lord the true people of God are caught up in another thing and the earthly is taking on the heavenly and that's why I'm bringing this down now that whatever is whatever brings heaven joy is the thing that brings us joy should be that way so so the the people of God now are moving into a place that they're caught up in to another thing and that's the kingdom of God because the earthly is taken on the heavenly the kingdom of God has come to us in spirit form it's not like we're waiting for the kingdom of God it has come to us the kingdom of God is his word the kingdom of God is his presence it has come to us it has returned to us in the last days so we have another kingdom that we have access to as believers and it's coming in our hearts and but we live in another kingdom of the world and so now we have the earthly is taking on the heavenly jesus said it when he said in his prayer thy kingdom come Thy will be done in earth can you quote it with me thy kingdom come Thy will be done where in earth as it is in heaven so there's only one group of people that have this desire to pull the kingdom of God into our world to pull whatever's there in that dimension into our world the order of it the joy of it everything that's in there thy kingdom come that will be done in earth as it is in heaven to the place he said I hope I worship now right here as if I was already in that other dimension and so the kingdom now where we're blending with that for the Millennium and because that's when the kingdom of seta is set up on earth that's when we have a thousand years of honeymoon on the earth and that's where the people of God become a kingdom people now so that there's an earth created for them that is a millennium with Christ a thousand year honeymoon with Christ but I just want to talk about that because we're we're coming into that blending now where the kingdom has come to us to make for us a millennium and so that whatever is in the heavenly dimension is coming into this dimension and the bride grabs a hold of it and she grabs a hold of this book because we're taking the book that Adam lost in the Guardian do you realize today that the book the book of redemption the book of the title deed to ownership of this earth which was in their hands of the original owner after Adam lost it it was in the hands of the Sun can you say men Adam and then because the fall Adam lost the title deed - that went back into the hands of the Regent but you know you realize that at the end time that book is back into the hands of our kinsmen and being placed back into the hands of sons again and that's not happening someday that's happening as we're preaching that's happening now that the book that Adam loss is being handed back and we're taking back all that Adam lost and in the future home message brother Brown says he said God is going to purge this earth by fire to get it ready for the Millennium can you say man but the same fire is purging us to get us ready for a millennium that's paraphrasing that's my own words there but that's the theme that he brings in future home is the same fire that it has to purge the stars because I don't want to live in this earth if it's not purged of all the atmospheres and all the sin and all the lust can you say man you want to hear a good service last Sunday why we were cyber Saints and we couldn't come here we listen to brother Donnie want to hear good service under millennium the best I've ever heard talks all about what it's going to be like to live in the millennium think about it a thousand years with no devil he's bound for a thousand years think about that's the way we're called to live in a place with no devil that's why we have problems that's why we have people sometimes in the church acting sometimes as I said in the song acting some ways that I'm going to the Lord's even in their life at all because they shouldn't be acting that way but you know what is it's not the brother it's the devil influencing that brother we're dealing with the devil that's the accuser of the Brethren that's always trying to cause divisions that's always being getting nasty with one another can you say man it's the devil can you say man and we have the power to cast them out now but one day we won't have to cast him out we'll live on earth without that influence they're never here the accuser of the Brethren again but you see now that fire that purges to get an earth that way is working on us now to purge out can you say man from everything that's not of God to purge our souls to purge our lives growing in the going and the things of the Lord to become a kingdom people and what's happening that other dimension is spilling over into our dimension or it should be and it should be affecting us and that means that what brings joy to him brings joy to us what brings joy to heaven brings joy to us or it should you say what about the joys of life things that we desire family and nice houses is that wrong no that's not wrong brother and sister that's the right thing but but the promise is now is that if we delight in the ways of the Lord and delight in the Lord here's how this works okay we have desires some of them are pure desires I want a better home or you know I want a grandchild or whatever it is there's not a thing wrong with that intent seems like the only couple things I can mention but there's a lot of other joys of life stuck a lot of other joys of life you shouldn't feel bad for enjoying them but here's the Hazara God has taught us where do you get your delight delight your ways in the Lord just get lost in the joy of the Lord and then when life fails you or life doesn't give up what you wanted or doesn't turn out the way and I mean raise your hand does life always turn out what you want no there's the marriage always turn out the way you wanted it no it doesn't that's the thing about life do you always get what you want no we get we get what we need can you say man Billy Graham say this morning I so enjoyed a message for him in a few words from him while he was good he's anointed he said God said he'd supply all of our needs not our Greed's amen but the way it works is that delight your ways in the Lord delight and take your Joy's from heaven take your Joy's from the Lord that is your joy and he says it a lot your ways Lord and he shall give you the desires of your heart so we're taught that we don't pursue the desires of our heart and neglect the joys of the Lord and neglect the word Lord and neglect that this relationship with the Lord we don't do it we don't pursue those things in in expense of our our walk with the Lord we never do that because it won't turn out right I said it's not going to turn out right it never turns out right when someone makes that choice but when we're lost just lost in the love of the Lord and lost everyday in his presence and just Lord ah I just love you and and when we're at that level of relationship man we're drawing our Joy's from him we tend to be able to handle the things of life a lot better can you say men but we're all about that then our emotions are like a roller coaster and they go up and down when somebody likes me everything's up the next day somebody doesn't were in depression again life dictates your joy I said I got some people just not queuing in with me a little bit this morning but I'm a messenger of the Lord to tell you the truth and I'm talking to you not the person next to you you better listen to what I'm saying because you do you draw your joy and neglect the greatest joys of heaven and great you really neglect what you know is to find most of you know it and experience the joy of the Lord but with it but when life starts to dictate to you and to misdirect you to drawing it out a family or drawing out of this and it's all about that then something's going to happen and you're gonna feel whether it's a week down the road or two years down the road you're gonna pay for that some way because you're not called to let that be the emphasis now light your ways in the Lord and he'll give you the desires of your heart can you say man praise the Lord I was thinking of sister Rebecca read me that I was just thinking of giving us a little rebuke here this morning and I was thinking of John and Caressa given Caleb their rebuke and they put it on and said that help me out his response was so good what yeah but would they tell him to do I said to pick up his toys he says I choose taking a timeout these kids are smart these days negotiate oh boy I love it and so I'm trying to preach you this morning maybe you want to take a timeout in steady and give you a choice of what you want but I'm the one in the pulpit so you don't get a choice here so our delight is in the Lord what brings heaven joy first thing in our text now I'm gonna take a few scriptures very quickly now because we don't want to take too much time but I want you to learn what the scripture says brings us joy as Christians we learn enough of what the world says brings you joy but we want to know what brings the Christian joy where's our source of joy and and then we look at what happens heaven joy and rejoicing and when that brings joy and rejoicing on the other side it should affect us the same way so the first place is mentioned in our text in Luke chapter 15 where we realize that a sinner coming back to repentance brings a such a rejoicing on the other side one sinner that gives a true repentance before God all the angels of God and all of heaven is having a great time of rejoicing now that's the Bible can you say man that is the truth that's not just a story and although we can't see it I'm telling you when there's true repentance out of someone who comes from a heart says I've got to repent before God and you see sometimes the tears and you see the brokenness and say god I need you I'm a center I give it all to you I'm a sinner I'm coming to give it all to you I want to say there's a rejoicing that goes on in the other side praise be to God now notice now it's true repentance it's not a it's not a dry eyed and B Kanaka thing that we made it a formula sometimes in churches right now just confess Jesus and shake the preachers hand there's no repented heart there but we're talking about a real repented heart and says I'm finished I give up Lord I'm letting you take over my life I repent of what I've done how many can raise your hand and some here at a camp or sometime in your life you hit that point it was all over it was done I'm giving it all to God praise be to God that's when heaven rejoiced over your life if there's a point in your life that you said that's it I'm finished I'm not gonna fight for my own way I'm giving it all to God I repent before him and I'm telling you that's what he's looking for it's not that you have a whole head knowledge of the message he's looking for true repentance because if there's true repentance he'll show you all the message today even in the message we've become so mechanical that as long as you can understand the seals and as long as you can go to a message church and as long as that church is just preaching all the mysteries and you're dazzled by it everybody's okay if they're attending that message Church and I'm here to tell you if there's no repentance even in the believers you don't have anything to work off of for lives to be changed amen you don't have anything to orga so now that's the one you first came to the Lord you ought to rejoice in that because having to rejoice I want to tell you repentance doesn't end then because they said in the later cease labor scene H be zealous therefore and repent so the way where's Ella for the Lord is that there's repentance sincere repentance going on all the time now raise your hand and say I I still need repentance in my life this group they they remove repentance from their life going to church going to the synagogue and they had removed I don't need to repent to that brother I don't need to repent to God for that I've reached a place they have no need of repentance please don't ever reach that place in your life stay tender before the Lord if you do something wrong make it right right away whether it's God or a brother or sister make it right right away hold a grudge for years my brother and sister don't hold that grudge for years take it to the cross and repent to that brother if you've lost repentance you get numb can you say Amen and the heavens not rejoicing over your life heaven is not rejoicing if you've lost your ability to repent some weren't listening so I'm going to say it again heaven is not rejoicing over your life if you've lost the ability to sincerely repent let me say it this way based on the text we read there is no true joy in your life if you've lost the ability to sincerely repent you don't have true joy Dossett II to tell me that I was happy yesterday and I was happy about this night I was just I was laughing about this joke and I said I'm here to tell you you don't have true joy if you've lost repentance in your life because what I'm preaching is true joy not temporary not worldly joy not just from a family I'm talking about heavens joy in your heart and you don't have it if you don't know how to repent there's no way he's amazing how the kingdom of God works or something so sincere and sorrowful that it breaks somebody up and there's tears at the altar of God I'm broken I've done wrong forgive me Lord or to a brother brother I did did you wrong I said I did the wrong thing please forgive me I asked you to forgive me in a brokenness it isn't amazing that something so confrontational and something so hard to do brings the joy of heaven it's the way the kingdom works I want you to notice that the lost sheep they are the predestined predestinated sheep already they're already sheep it's a lost sheep so we've got to look at this parable right that they are the predestinated sheep already they're called a sheep already so they're the predestinated ones that haven't come to true repentance yet sometimes I wonder if we've got people sitting in message churches and their predestinated seed but they haven't repented yet heaven doesn't rejoice until you repent is anybody listening to me this morning heaven does not rejoice over your life until you've come to a true sincere repentance so it's not just a sinner coming Lord it's a sinner who needs and does truly repent in their heart this is the cause for joy and I'll tell you since I've read this and since I've looked at this a little closer I've come to the place in my life that when I was reading this last few weeks that I know what makes something swell within my heart and I was really happy to to acknowledge this because when I really realized I said that's what heaven rejoices over I was reading this about two or three months ago for the first time and I said notice the word repentance in there and the other ones the lack of repentance but notice it's not just the sinner comes back but the sinner sincerely repents I said Lord that's what makes you rejoice is true repentance you can have a church you can have a message Church I can preach a sermon I can preach the mysteries to dowser you you can come and pay your tithes god bless you for doing that but if we go and come and there's no repentance we don't really have a church I don't think there's enough repentance that goes on in the message in our message ranks because we've developed a pride I didn't expect to say these things this morning but I'm saying them for all of us message churches develop a pride that as long as we get together and speak about the seals and all the mysteries and we've had church and we clock in and clock out that we're going to make the rapture and I'm here to say there's enough scriptures to show unless there's an atmosphere of true repentance on our hearts the word is doing us no good because it's the only thing God has to work off of a tender broken heart he says that Isaiah 66 he says heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool - what man shall you look he says all these things that my handmaids to this man will I look not to him that brings sacrifices not to him that he that slew the Sioux an ox is if he slew a man and he goes into all the sacrifices Israel makes and he says there they don't mean anything this is the kind of man I'm looking for to him that is broken out of a contrite spirit and that tremble with that my word he pointed to the man that he needs don't make up you see us men we judge ourselves before our family and before God we and this is in our nature so I'm not knocking it we tend to judge ourselves and qualify ourselves and praise ourselves based upon the sacrifices that we the measure of a man is the sacrifices he's making for his family and that's Christ like Christ our kinsman went to Calvary he made a sacrifice I'm not doing away from the fact that a man should make sacrifices to feed his family to work every day in the cold or not in the cold but their feet offend you that's something of God in you - but he's showing in Isaiah 66 it's not just that we make sacrifices because us men will tend to say to someone who's criticizing us maybe even our wife sometimes will tend to remind the wife of all the sacrifices were making for the family she's trying to bring up something about your character something that you'd said wrong or something like that and and we said okay my wife is measuring me my children my family or somebodies measuring my my manhood and my status as a godly man so they're measured it by this corner over here and then we jump to we're gonna give a list of all the sacrifices were making what are you talking about I'm working my finger to the bone here I'm out in the cold she goes to your list all right to bring food on this table why are you even criticizing me look what I'm doing to bring food on this day but all these you know statements that men have made through generations because we're judging ourselves by our sacrifice but he says in Isaiah - this man will I look not just to make sacrifices a matter of fact the sacrifice doesn't mean anything if you don't have a gentle broken heart one of my prayers the last couple years more than anything else - lords to make me more gentle true gentleness can you say amen amen I was pretty transparent right there with you we're supposed to be gentlemen make me gentle maybe gentle amen some of you what I said that you're thinking you heart yes lord please me yes I'm so glad he's praying that because I've been praying for him for years for that issue well good it's finally getting through your prayers are reaching heaven Lord make me more gentle Lord give me a broken spirit if I can't cry anymore be moved by the president of God something is wrong if I can't cry and repent and say the words please forgive me I'm sorry sincerely I'm reaching a place I don't care how much message I learn I don't care if I can preach it like an angel if I lose my brokenness I've lost everything I don't care how much you know this Bible can quote it to me I'm preaching to you this morning I don't care you can quote quotes our brother branham and study everything quote this Bible if there's no brokenness in your spirit God cannot deal with you praise the Lord so I'm going to read some other scriptures quickly now here if you would read with me and we're going to find if you're interested the sources of joy now if you would turn quickly with me to Matthew chapter 5 and verse 12 we check and check in the time of 1228 so we're doing good Matthew chapter 5 and verse 12 so what some other sources of sources of joy for a believer Matthew chapter 5 and verse and pick it up here in verse 11 blessed are the ye when no verse 10 blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake now this is the reading of persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom heaven blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely if it says that in the scripture then that's going to happen to our lives people sometimes don't want this but if you're gonna live a godly life you're going to receive persecution you're going to receive people saying evil things about you you have to get used to it and we have to know how to bring it to the Lord or it affect us so we have to realize we be persecuted they'll say all manner of evil against you falsely for my name's sake this one it says the new verse 12 rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you if you're holding to the same word that the prophets preached they were persecuted now you're persecuted I always like to say it shows what team you're on it shows what side you're on and so you should rejoice I'm getting persecuted because of the word praise be to God does it seem like a reason to rejoice does it when you're talked about evil evilly against you the other reference in Luke - this says rejoice in that day and leap for joy now in my Christian experience I have never seen anybody leap for joy when they were persecuted when men reviled them and said all manner of evil against them falsely isn't it amazing I can say I've never seen a Christian leap I'd like to see it Jesus said to do it and I'd like to some said give somebody to give a big jump and a leap as soon as they're falsely accused of something isn't it funny we're laughing because Jesus said that's how we should respond to being persecuted go out there in the yard as soon as it's posted on the internet and jump over that fence and call me over because I want a picture of it to put on Facebook it'd be the first time ever somebody obeyed the scripture and how to deal with persecution see these people who said things about me and my family and my children and you're ready to go fight him any what Jesus said is that he says it's the time to rejoice and lift your hands say Lord they persecuted the prophets before us I know I've checked my heart and I believe that I've got everything under the blood and I don't believe in this incident that I contribute or did anything wrong if I did Lord help me but I don't believe I did and so now I'm being persecuted persecuted for something I didn't do glory be to God I give you praise and glory and honor and I'm gonna leap for joy all right next one Luke chapter 10 Luke chapter 10 and verse 19 behold I give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you Jesus commissioning the seventy here I give you power and tread on serpents and scorpions and over power of the enemy and nothing shall be any means hurt you not with sin notwithstanding in this rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven here's the reason you rejoice and this is a good correction for Pentecostals who rejoice in the power that's been given them by God even sometimes message people they're rejoicing the power that they begin in Jesus that were not to rejoice in that that shouldn't be the source of my joy we had power over the enemy and I cast out three Devils this week and I did this and glory I'm a powerful son of God we shouldn't be rejoicing that let everybody else rejoice in that we rejoice in that our names are written in the book of life before the foundation of the world that should be a source of joy to us can you say Amen third John chapter one third John chapter one we're learning something today are we not we're learning something about what real joy but it comes to a Christian the source of real joy 3rd John chapter 1 the verse verse 3 frag rejoiced greatly when the Brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee this is John's disciples here even as thou walkest in truth I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth now this is John and he's making a statement of all the joys of life and all the joys in the Lord I have no greater joy than to hear that my children in the gospel are walking in truth praise the Lord and if that gives them joy that should give us joy I'm so glad to hear that because it does even for your own children but but first of all it's for the children of God if I see a believer catching the word and latching onto it I don't care about their weaknesses and all these other things God will take care of that but I see him walking every week every day in truth brother part I didn't know that the Lord showed me that I'm walking in the word I get swelled up with joy with that and John said I have no greater joy than to see my children walking in truth and if you apply that to your own families as I've been preaching a little bit about it we should desire for our children when they come of age above all things that they receive the new birth the Holy Ghost I watch people work so hard to provide the very best for their children and there's not a thing in the world around but I'm I'm working I'm paying college bills are about to kill me it's good to do it it's good to try to help them but our greatest prayer is that they come to a new birth you can do everything else for your kids but I tell you you your you're gonna actually be somewhat disappointed in the end if they're just good people in life and didn't receive the Holy Ghost and I you know your kids are good my kids are good we're always gonna stand for our kids and they're good kids I believe they have a good heart I say that about my kids they do but a good heart and a good person is not all that they need can I get an amen so our prayer has to go deeper than there's just there good person don't you know just that they're doing good they're doing the best again yes praise the Lord but keep praying that they receive the new birth and so it says I have no greater joy to see my children walk in truth it doesn't mean I have no greater joy and see my children at church didn't say that I have no greater joy to see my kids show up at church I have no greater joy than to see my kid doing this that the other and giving to charity and and being participating good things no that can't be our greatest joy but to see them by the Holy Ghost walking in truth that gives joy so you keep praying until you see it in your kids don't you stop praying can you say Amen those that are art don't you stop praying don't stop praying we got to keep believing for our children we got to keep believing that they'll walking true someday that's a joy that I can participate in it's my possession can you say Matt oh quickly go with me over the book of James chapter one amen I'm looking at the sources of joy for a Christian maybe you would make this and say Lord I'm listing this in my heart just now God make these things my joy make that my prior Army primary joy in my life above all things make these things my joy this is what a Christian rejoiced at James chapter 1 and verse 2 James a servant of God verse 1 James a servant of God and the Lord Jesus Christ to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad of greeting my brother and count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations not a lot of us rejoice in that not on all of us get joy out of that that's why it's strange to the world when we enter temptations and testings and trials they act a certain way but then they say Christians I'm gonna count it all joy praise the Lord in tempted being tested and being tried I feel it coming on I feel it thank you Lord count it all joy anybody want to raise your hand say this is hard to do brother Paul it's hard to do by the Holy Ghost we can do it because it's in the word counted all joy when you fall into divers today knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have our perfect work that you may be perfect and entire and wanting nothing so it works to the good for us friends it's gonna make us perfect it's going to be perfect entire wanting nothing if any of you lack wisdom so it goes on to some other things let's move on to revelations chapter 12 I've got about three more here if you just give me patience revelations chapter 12 and says here back here in verse 9 and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the Kingdom of our God and the power of his Christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night so you notice what's happening here this is just before the rapture when heaven notices that the accuser Satan the accuser of the Brethren and all those who have gone in before has reached his day of being cast out and cast down and he's cast out of the heavenly atmosphere out of the atmosphere that he's in and so now that day comes and so there's there with a loud voice saying salvation is strengthened Kingdom of our God and the power of Christ it's come now because the accuser of our brothers cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they overcame by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto death so there we find there's a group that overcame him all these years of accusing day and night they battled the accuser of the Brethren and they won they overcame there's a group of people that overcome the accuser of the brother there's a group of people that caused him to be cast out and his day is over I want to be one of those therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them woe to the inhabiters of the earth of the sea for the devil has come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time and that short time is three and a half years so he's cast out and he's cast into tribulation and the Bible saying woe unto them that are in habit of the earth in the sea when the devil comes down during that Tribulation he's got great wrath he's as angry as a beast has ever been before because he knows he only has a short time now to do what he needs to do but he's been cast out as the bride goes up the devil comes down he's cast out of the atmospheres of being able to whisper on ear the accuser of the Brethren that day is over and when it is heavens rejoice believers rejoice how he's looking forward to that day revelations chapter 18 and verse 16 in saying alas alas that great city Rome that was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls I was just there a few months ago this describes that city there's too many places in the scripture that points to that city the Roman Church and the Romans spirit with pagan Rome and papal Rome has been the same spirit when it passed from pagan Rome the papal Rome it's the same spirit behind it can you say man the Beast system to always come against the true Christians and the true power of God and the prophets of God she's guilty of the blood can you say man she shed blood of all those things too one day her hour is coming for in one hour so great riches has come to naught and every shipmaster and all the company and ships and sailors and many as trade by sea stood afar off and cried when they saw the smoke of her burning saying what city is like under this great city Rome what city is like this straight city what systems like that great system that Mother Church and they cast they cast dust on their heads and cried weeping and wailing saying alas alas that great city wherein were were made rich all that all had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness for in one hour is she made desolate in one hour God will drop an atomic bomb on that thing or allow a topping bomb and destroy all of that history that's there and all that it's ever done and why are the since looking and weeping about it because somehow she has become the center of the financial thing we have all sold out as the world to the one who has the Vatican millions the millions are at the Vatican and when we need to be bailed out someday the Vatican is going to bail everybody out but there come a cost with it the Antichrist so that'll go on and on and on until God says revenge on this city that's milk the people of their money that's deceived souls that you light a candle and you're okay Oh God have mercy there's a judgement coming to you and God's got a bomb with a name on it I'm gonna drop right on this city and the merchants oh look from ships and say oh my they're dreading it because that's the hub of all their financial systems now it's gone but when it happens look at this verse 20 rejoice over her thou heaven and ye holy apostles and prophets for God has two Vinge you on her heaven is rejoicing over this avenging of God finally over this system and this city who has deceived so many souls I know that don't sound good to the world but it's what the Bible says all of heaven and all the prophets and all the apostles because that system is what's caused all the spiritual issues through the years and all of heaven begins to rejoice I'm gonna be right there with them rejoicing I'm gonna bring joy whether I said praise God this is the thing that devil behind the system that's deceived millions of souls it's done it's finished God ends it and there's a rejoicing I'm gonna read one more place if you don't mind in revelations chapter 5 and this is cannot be overlooked because this has happened and is happening in our generation revelations chapter 5 you know it's when the book was there sealed up no one was worthy to get it but then all of a sudden verse 4 I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and read the book neither look there in the book of redemption the title deed their names in the book predestinated seat of God and one of the elders said weep not behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne stop brother Branham comments that scripture and that happening of our kinsmen taking the book from the hands of the original owner and going to give it to his people taking back the possession that Adam lost that act was the mo he said the most sublime thing in the scripture the most sublime thing in the scripture because all creation was lost unless he come and took the book and if the only person to come and take the book it's because someone who was worthy all of us were unworthy all the prophets were unworthy no way was worthy only the Lamb was worthy if he didn't come and take that bill call and that's why he said John was weeping all the creation would be lost that's why John was weeping it's over I don't care all the gospel was preached for 2,000 years all that's been done all it's done done for the kingdom of God unless unless this act takes place of our kinsman redeemer who paid the price but not just paid the price he took the book of the title deed of redemption and he took it back into his hands and now is going to give it back to his people for Adam to be restored again the second Adam restoring all the all the bride back again when that act took place here's what took place when it that act took place and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of the odours which are the prayers of the saints so this obviously this is what Saints have been praying for all along this is the cry this is the burden when they died this is the prayers they set up before God unless our kinsman comes and takes us we are the possession of God unless he comes and takes that book and takes us his possession were lost they sung a new song saying thou it worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by our blood by the blood out of every kindred tongue and people and nation and now it's made us kings and priests and we shall reign on earth and beheld I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the number number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing this is the rejoicing that's taken place in the other dimension when our kinsman takes the book there's loud voices they're shouting can you say man there's prayers going up this is the answer to prayer hallelujah there's a rejoicing going on to heaven and I've taught you this morning whatever they're rejoicing about is what we should be rejoicing about and some people haven't even read the seal book you're gonna tell me that that that that this act has taken place and that he took the book and he threw it I'm gonna read it in a minute you threw it to his prophet on earth and he spoke those things to seal it to unseal it to the people and this is what's happened in our generation and now we're looking for the tool full taking of the book because you're the book you're the words in the book you're the bride so there's a taking that's a taking to release the book of redemption but there's a taking the rapture where he comes and takes you back in a rapture people get all that confused and the taking and they say read they say that there's no blood on the mercy seat and all these other things don't get this all confused there's a taking of this book but you're the actually the literal book and he comes and takes you we're still waiting for that to happen every predestinated seed coming in and going in a rapture can you say man that might be deep for you this morning but praise be to God heaven is rejoicing because he's already taking the book hallelujah but then what happens to John the same thing I preached it the same rejoicing in heaven is happening in John when he says verse 13 every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard me shouting and saying blessed and honor and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and the four beasts said amen and the four and twenty elders fell down and worshiped him that liveth forever ever and ever John is being affected by the joy of this happening just like heaven is they sang a new song I'm going to read the way brother Branham said it they sung a new song saying doubt worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by the blood out of every kindred tongue people a nation and now it's made under our God kings and priests and we shall ain't rain on the earth they wanted to come back and here they're going back to be kings and priests glory to God I feel good now listen friend someone tell you something you ought to listen and that's why I just mentioned to you ya people and I want to encourage you as a pastor if you just can I give you something to encourage you to do maybe you've already listened to it I want you to take in the next few weeks and I want you to listen to God the first two messages in the seals okay I want you to listen and I know I'm talking to people haven't even listened to the seals okay I don't know if it's too overwhelming or you'd have them take the time but I want all of you to take the time to do it I'm encouraging you not as a law or something but I want you to do it because this is an important thing that took place in our generation the Lamb not brother brand of the Lamb taking the book and revealing it so I want you to listen to God and simplicity because that's the only entrance he had to preach to entrance to come into the seals his preaching that throughout history when God did something major and came to the earth it's only ten ten to one so I'm really good on time I hold that opinion myself when when great events took place like when Jesus came in flesh and it's Christmas time we just had okay when the great events so now whenever he did it when it was a great event like that it was so simple the whole world missed it now we can't take that principle that has always been that with God in simplicity and say today it would be different when Christ comes when all this happens this great major deal if this Lamb taking the book it's going to be visible to all the Christians you gonna step out in a cloud it's gonna take the book no no no no no you know it's so this is why the entrance is to preach God in simplicity because God always revealed himself to the simple can you say man God always revealed himself to those who simply receive it revealed it to babes I thank thee father and I rejoice that you've hid these things from the wise and prudent what Jesus rejoice and say to the father I'm really happy that you've hid these things from the wise and prudent and revealed them to babes why is he happy about that because it's not based upon intellect it's not based upon IQ that the people have a higher IQ we'll catch this quicker than other ones you don't a lot of the book of Acts people couldn't even sign their own name they're not educated people it's Jesus is rejoicing I thank thee father because you've hid these things from the wise and prudent and revealed them to babes so God and simplicity was the only entrance is very significant he preaches that first I want you to listen to it because you as entering in those seals you can make things so complicated remember it's God in simplicity a humble heart looking at the word seeing what God is doing right now once you listen that I want you to listen to the next message which is the breech because this is where he comes to some of these comments I'm reading here in this whole transition of the breech where he comes the changes we've had seven church ages but now our lamb that went to Calvary 2,000 years ago our lamb how many knows our lamb Jesus Christ he died for our sins that was a great action 2,000 years ago we depend on that as him taking her sins but our lamb steps forward now after 2,000 years from the mediatorial work as being our high priest for 2,000 years he steps in another movement after 2,000 years our lamb steps in another movement and in and his movement is it's time at the end of the age to take back the title deed and the rights to this earth and the rights to redemption I've purchased them it's kind of like going into a pawn shop and paying the price for something to get them out of the pawn shop okay but you don't pick it up yet maybe you call and pay a credit card I'm paying the price I want to buy that back okay the price has been paid 2,000 years I'm coming to take my possession now can you say Matt that's a pretty huge thing and so now when that act takes place the first part of that is our lamb with that comes forward and he takes this book of redemption from the hands of the original order in symbolic form now okay you don't want to make two gods there the God the Father God the Son Holy Ghost no no it's in symbolic it's in a vision it's a symbol parable form and said our lamb steps forward because no one was found worthy to take back this book and give it back to the people again here this is happening in our generation and it's the most sublime thing in the scripture all heaven begins to rejoice John begins to rejoice and this is the way brother Brahim says I'm closing here in a minute I know I know where I'm at here in time when brother here's what I want you to listen to it because while he's preaching these things if you don't get excited about the atmosphere when he's talking about this is happening now you're just dead if you don't get excited because you could feel the anointing over that tape and things become explosive not because of a feeling worked up by the people or by some emotion it's the stimulation of Revelation of what's taking place right now heavens rejoicing and the Saints begin to really rejoice I'd like you to listen would you how many could do that and then maybe that'll encourage you to go on and listen to the rest of it I think you should to some to some leaders in the message they be very happy this morning that I'm telling you to go listen to the tapes and and write in the push play thing mode hear and obey I encourage you you know if there's a criticism that we don't push play over the pulpit very often just play the prophets voice here you know what I can't stand the criticism to eliminate us preachers we're not even hardly a preacher if we don't put a tape recorder up here and play push play that's what we needed to do to be a church and yet for 30 years this year I'll celebrate 30 years for the mark 30 years you guys were with us some for 30 years I've read these quotes that's about all I've read is these quotes of the message that's all I preached but no credibility because I didn't let him speak it every time through the prophets voice it's just it's not it's not okay let's leave it alone everything I preached is this message but the voice that has come through has come through my voice came through a seventh messenger but I'm the voice is coming through now and that but yet I encourage you to listen to the seventh Angelus was sure wonderful but you know the Lord rebuke me one day said but those people may not be listening as much as tapes as they should but are they receiving the truth are they receiving the message or preaching so the Lord rebuke me says if they're receiving the truth what what does it matter what vessel that comes through if they're a vessel of the Lord they're a living voice of the Lord and it is the truth and they receive it that's what God wants to bring to is that repentance does that okay with everybody I try not to say things about all that's going on but I tried to say it tactfully to say and I would only say the only the other thing I might do some time is that I'm gonna bring a tape recorder here and I'm going to push play and I'm going to play some specific things that the Prophet said and see if people will push play and obey that for example when he says when you make me Christ you make me Antichrist for example when he says are you the only one in the fivefold ministry are you the only one where's the bride's revival is it over now and oh no no no the bride's revival is going around right now it's a powerful prophets teachers evangelists the fivefold ministry the bride's gonna so I'm gonna push play and we're gonna obey that I'll do it I don't I don't mind but listen if you're gonna push it you better listen to what he says and let me just say this let me just say this if you were pushing and playing and really obeying what he said you would conclude that brother Branham says what you need is the Holy Ghost to make it in a rapture he never says if you just push play and obey that's all you have to do never says that that's a deception he preaches that the way to make a rapture is not just to push play no way he never uses those words you need the Holy Ghost to make a rapture so go ahead and push play but make sure you obey amen preachers just love to get in trouble don't they just love to find it you just had to say it didn't you had to go there look at this now glory to God I feel enough to speak in tongues brother brems says and the atmosphere just begins to grow look watch yes it seems like I hate I haven't got enough language I could praise him him with it I need one that I don't even know so now listen this and behold I heard the voice of many angels listen what a Jubilee going on when they seen the lamb come and take the Book of redemption the soul screamed out will get it at all everything the elders fell down they poured out their prayers of the Saints what there was represented two kinsmen for us they fell on their face as they sang a song and said thou art worthy for you were slain watch what and look at these angels and behold I heard the voice of many angels around about the throne the beasts and the elders and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand saying with a loud voice worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessings what a Jubilee going on in heaven when the lamb leads leaves that intercessory box to come here to possess his claims you know that got next to John he must have saw his name wrote there when them seals broke he must have got real happy listen friends I'm preaching to you the source of our joy he got real happy you must have seen his name there listen what he said in every creature which is in heaven and on earth and underneath the earth witnesses see and all the in them her be saying blessing and all honor glory power be to him I just say to you he must have been saying it pretty loud he must have been screaming it pretty loud because said everything in earth he said hurt him everything in heaven heard him every all the creatures heard him he must have been shouting pretty loud why cuz he was happy he was joyful he was rejoicing over this taking of the book and the four and twenty elders I don't mean to lose your spot there Nora and the four and twenty hours fell down worst him that lives forever and ever talk about a Jubilee talk about a time did I lose you yeah talk about a Jubilee talk about a time when the lamb walked forth see the book is even sealed in heaven the mysteries are isn't it my name there I don't know I hope it is but if it is it was put on the book before the foundation of the world and he took the book open the book and tore off the seals and sent it down to earth to his seventh angel to reveal it to his people congregation greatly rejoices there you are oh my what happened the screams the shouts the hallelujah the anointing the power the glory the manifestation congregation continues to greatly rejoice in all John who had been standing there our brother crying why he said everything in heaven everything in earth everything in the sea heard me holler amen and men blessings honor and might and power be to him that lives

and riches belong to him amen let us stand let us say Amen and amen can you say Amen Wow tremendous to see what the Lord has done for us and is doing for us what are you saying this for brother Paul because I think that we should draw our joy from the right sources rejoice because your name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life rejoice because that book of life is being handed back to us that we can see our name in the book of life rejoice because God has saved you rejoice because he's taking your sins away you asked me why I'm happy now I'll just tell you why because my sins are gone and if we start taking our joy under any other source friends I'll tell you we're losing it it asked himself the question has he taken away your sins if there's no joy that comes from that then maybe he hasn't done the full work in your life yet but what he does you're gonna be happy you're gonna be rejoicing you're gonna find life and family life and when you go about other things and this is the source of your joy the Word of God and what he's doing now we're gonna find those other things have a lot more joy to them as well just they're speaking from experience do you love the Lord keep see sure you let's see is that for sure see us you asked me why I'm happy I'll just tell you why because my sins are gone and when I meet the scoffers [Music] I say I say [Music]
