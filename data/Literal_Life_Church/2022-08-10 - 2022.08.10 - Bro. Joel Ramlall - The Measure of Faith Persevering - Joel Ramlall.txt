TRANSCRIPT
========================================
21 bring your greetings from our little church in Meriden Connecticut Overcomers Tabernacle and for my pastor brother Craig Gore it's lovely to be with you all again and I have quite a bit of family with me this time I see my parents my sisters here I saw my brother-in-law Lucas from Arizona somewhere here in the back of course it's always wonderful to visit with my in-laws I even have family from Mexico with me tonight the Romero family God bless you all it's nice to see you let's read from Matthew chapter 15 and verse 21. certainly thank brother Paul for the opportunity and the privilege of speaking to you all tonight Matthew 15 and verse 21 it says then Jesus went Vents and departed into the coasts of tire and sidon this entire passage is going to hinge on that statement Jesus went thence it was his choice he was following the father's will verse 22 it says and behold a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts and Cried unto him saying have mercy on me O Lord thou son of David my daughter is grievously vexed with the devil but he answered her not a word and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she quiet after us but he answered and said I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the House of Israel then came she and worshiped him saying Lord help me there's something special about worship isn't there it always catches the heart of the Lord but he answered and said it is not meat to take the children's bread and cast it to dogs and she said truth Lord everything that he says is truth to us amen yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's table verse 28 then Jesus answered and said unto her o woman great is thy faith be it unto thee even as thou Wilt he didn't just say you have faith he said great is thy faith there was something about her approach that caused the master to say great is thy faith and her daughter was made whole from that very hour and I love that this whole story takes place and it wasn't even about her she had a need on her heart that she approached the Lord with and God saw to it that that need was in that because she approached him the right way now keep your finger there in Matthew chapter 15 because I'm going to Pivot a little bit around that chapter so let's pray together and then we'll be seated Heavenly Father we thank you for this opportunity again to be in your presence Lord to swirl your to feel your sweet presence in the building Lord as soon as we stepped in Lord knowing the mighty things that you've done in here Lord for each life and each person oh God I pray that you would pour out your spirit once more we ask oh God again once more pour out your spirit on us O Lord help us this evening we pray o God have your perfect way in the service we ask in the lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen God bless you may be seated this evening now this evening I'm hoping that you'll you'll try to help me out and and grasp what I'm trying to say and don't Focus too much on just the the how of how I'm going about saying it uh we want to just look into this this little passage here and this interaction between the woman and Jesus now if you could uh flip one page back over to chapter 14 and verse 17. chapter 14 and verse 17 the page before uh and they say unto him we have here but Five Loaves and two fishes and Jesus said bring them hither to me and he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass and took the Five Loaves and two fishes and looking up to heaven he blessed and break and gave the loaves to his disciples and the disciples to the multitude and they did all eat and were filled and they took up the fragments that remained 12 baskets full so there's no question about whether he can provide bread or not right now we read in our opening scripture that he said I can't take the children's bread and cast it to dogs some implication there that okay limited supply of bread right but it was not a limited supply of bread of course he could Supply the bread it was a question of Faith now go over to Matthew chapter 15 and verse 36. Matthew 15 and verse 36 and it says and he took the seven loaves this time and fishes and gave thanks and break them and gave to his disciples and the disciples to the multitude and they did all eat and were filled so on either side of this interaction between Jesus and the woman there's a miracle of God's supplying bread and I want to say there's no supply chain issues with God God can supply the bread it's not a question of whether or not he can supply it it's a question of our faith in him and whether or not we will believe that he can supply the bread now let's look again here I want to look again uh Matthew 14 flip back Matthew 14 and verse 31. Matthew 14 and verse 31 says and immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand he's dealing with Peter now when he was walking out on the water and caught him and he said oh thou of little faith wherefore did this thou doubt while we read Jesus said to this woman great is thy faith so now in comparison before this Jesus is saying to Peter you've got little faith and here he says to this woman you've got great faith and then again over in chapter 16 Matthew chapter 16 verse verse 8 when Jesus perceived he said unto them O ye of little faith so look at the surroundings of this this story that's happening between Jesus and the woman on the one side he he multiplies bread then he tells the woman I can't give the children's bread to you then immediately after that he goes and multiplies bread again because God is the provider he can do it it's about our approach to him and if we'll believe him and have faith in him look on either side of this miracle of Jesus healing the woman's daughter he he says to the disciples you have little faith on one side and then on the other side of the this miracle he says ye have little faith again but to this woman he says you have great faith be it unto thee even as thou Wilt now let me read this quote to you from the prophet now all Christians must be persistent they must be perseverant and the only way that you're able to do this is to First have faith in what you're trying to do and if you have no faith you're just jumping at it then you can't you cannot be perseverant but when you really know it's the truth then there's nothing going to stop you you're really perseverant then tonight I want to preach on a little title called The Measure of Faith and my subtitle will be perseverance we know that the prophet preached the message persevering about 10 or 11 times using this text he also says when a man knows the word and the will of God you become persistent you become perseverant no matter what science says you're perseverant because you know the word and the will of God now this woman she was of a canaanitis background Now everywhere that I could find in the Scripture it wasn't looking so good for Canaan Kanan the grandson of Noah and his descendants there they were pushed northward as the the Israelites came in and took over the land in one place Mark calls this woman and he renders her a Greek she's also rendered a Cyril Phoenician so we see that her background is not entirely Jewish now she doesn't understand maybe all of the Customs all of the Jewish Customs she's got a different kind of background a Greek background but this will come into play later now where we want to start our our passage here this evening it says Matthew 15 21 then Jesus went thence and departed into the coast of tire and silent and I love that this whole situation starts with Jesus went next it was Jesus that took control it was Jesus that was walking according to Vision according to the father's will before we had a need Jesus knew that we had the need Jesus knew that the woman had the need and he had already started going there and before she ever could get to him he already placed himself Within Reach before we had a problem God was on his way God knew what you were thinking on your way to church this evening he knew when you were driving here you were praying God give me an answer and he knew that you would be here this evening and he's ready to give you the answer that you need it's always God that will place himself Within Reach of us it's always been that way it's always been him that took that first step to us when we were lost he reached out and saved us it's he that came down and shed his blood for us that we might be saved name we can think and we can imagine now as brother Branham described it that God the great God was up there in the beginning the Creator he was alone with his thoughts and if you'll just allow me a little bit of Liberty to dramatize now that God was up there and maybe this being had one thought every million years or so just on a time scale that we could not understand he was there alone with his thoughts and We Know by the message of the hour that we were there we were one of his thoughts back there and just think tonight that maybe God had spent a couple million years just thinking about you an attribute of God that would be made manifest in this age that God way back when this being who was so great maybe one thought every million years maybe just to bat his eyelid would be a couple thousand years to complete that Revolution this God sitting there thinking of you wanting to fellowship with you and there he would take a step down uh the prophet would describe it as a logos that went forth from like a light in some places he would call it the Sun s-o-n and and that that light went forth and played before him as a child would play but what was it it was God condescending it was God doing the same thing that he did here then Jesus went thence it was God taking that step down he had something in his mind that he was trying to achieve and God took that first step and he stepped out into this light called the logos and we read in the scripture where it says for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are on earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him He is before all things and by him all things consist God had a plan as he was stepping down it wasn't a different person it was just God changing his robe changing his mask stepping down now into this light beginning to brood over creation and God would come down now and begin to brood over the Earth and eventually make man in that same image now follow me now God condescending God's stepping down Jesus placing himself in the path of this woman think of that God coming down now trying to place himself in your path and here he begins the work of creation stepping down lower and lower until man now has a body form and after the fall God using the woman to bring forth God to bring forth Christ Jesus in a body form that we could see and know and Christ's going to the cross and it doesn't stop there and when Christ was on the Cross pulled out of him a bride and it doesn't stop there and now the bride is living on the earth and what is it that's coming out of her it's the very same life of God that issued forth out of him in the beginning the very same Life of Christ manifested inside you and me as we look into the mirror of the word and molded day by day we begin to show forth that life that was in the beginning it was God condescending but I have to ask the question what was the point of all of that Jesus placed himself in in front of this woman and God comes down God condescends now all the way down what was the point of his descent if I may ask you as God comes down through through we follow this this chain all the way through creation God coming down I say the point of his descent was your Ascent with him back up the point of God coming down was so that he could reach those thoughts that he had in the beginning he needed an Avenue he needed a way to see you in the way that you are this evening with all of your flaws and failures God is okay with that God likes that God likes to mold you God likes to mold You In His Image he made every one of you a certain way for a reason you can think all the way back to the beginning when he had you on his mind he knew the way that you were he knew your personality who he knew what you would like and dislike he knew what your struggles and failures would be but yet somehow you're sitting here this evening yet somehow this evening he wants to see you he wants to know you what was the purpose of this great condescension it was so that God could come down and take you by the hand and then he could Ascend with you that God could bring you to where he is brother Brandon and things that are to be he references a scripture I wonder if you could put that scripture up for me it was in John 17 verse 24 why did God condescend why did he come down let me read this quote first and then I'll read the scripture he says Jesus only asks for one thing in his prayer to the father you know what that was one thing after all of his sacrifices that he did here on Earth the life that he lived the path that he walked he asked for one thing God coming all the way down out of glory and he asks for one thing that where I am they may be also he asked for our fellowship that's the only thing he asked the father in The Prayer here in John 17 your companionship forever God placing himself in your path but why father I will that they also whom thou has given me be with me where I am that they may behold my glory which thou Hast given me for thou loves me before the foundation of the world and God loved you so much that in this entire prayer the only thing he would ask and seek of the father is that you would be with him the only reason that he wanted to place himself in your path was so that you could be with him when God reached down for you when he reached down his hand for me and you saw the blood you saw the sacrifice that he made that was the plan of God unfolding that's what he had in the back part of his mind that's what he wanted that was his purpose of descending so that you could go back up with him he said I've severed you from other people that ye should be mine God is jealous over you God wants you God desires your fellowship above all when you talk about prayer prayer is pouring your heart out before God in John chapter 17 is the prayer of Jesus Jesus is pouring his heart out and the Very desire of his heart is that he might have you God working all of this through creation so that you could be sitting here tonight and God wants your fellowship above all found the book of Isaiah chapter 45 verse 7. it says this I formed the light and create Darkness I make peace and create evil I the Lord do all these things out here the woman found herself in this situation and you might find yourself in a similar situation whether for yourself or maybe you're like this woman seeking for your daughter seeking for your son or a family member you might find yourself in that situation and wonder why why are all these things happening to me is God in control but he says I form the light and create Darkness I make peace and create evil I the Lord do all these things and that's a hard thing for us to grasp we look through our life we see all the trials the tribulations all the things that we've been through all the hurt that we've been through all the people we thought were angels that weren't Angels they heard us we thought they were Christians but they but they still hurt us and God allowed all of it let me read a few different versions of that same verse it says I make light and create Darkness I make blessings and create disasters I the Lord do all these things I form light and create Darkness I make well-being and create Calamity I call his blessings I send the troubles I create the calamity and yet still we're troubled and yet still we're our faith flutters and yet still we're worried about whether God can meet our needs or not and here he's I create darkness and I make peace and I create evil and now you can look back on your life now your worry can turn into peace now you can know that God is in control the darkness that I see God allowed the peace that I feel God gave it to me the evil that I see God has allowed it he claims all the credit for it he says I the Lord do all these things it was no man that could ever seek God it was God's election God does the choosing it's a hard concept for us to understand now how many of us are married in here and you remember when you were getting married to your sweetheart and how you felt and how you longed to be with her and your your heart's desire was to to just be in her presence to be with her well now you understand the way that God looks at you that he wanted you he wanted your presence now you understand the desire that you would have to your sweetheart to want to be with her to want to know everything about her that's the same desire that God had towards you and then how many how many have had a newborn baby and how many have held that newborn baby and all of a sudden you understood the mystery of election why because you looked at that baby and there was nothing the baby could ever do wrong that would cause you to not love it anymore there was nothing the baby could do to ever stop your unconditional love and suddenly you know what election is what election means when you hold your own God in Simplicity God's showing you his very heart that he wants you to be where he is it's always God seeking the man and not man seeking God now back to this woman she says behold the woman of Canaan now Canaan comes from a very uh a bad place here it says in the Bible uh one he was one of the sons of Noah and I read also he said curse be Canaan so right from the get-go her genealogy was cursed she had no approach to him and you know in the Old Testament genealogy was everything to them where you come from who was your father and your father's father and yet she had no approach in that way she had no approach through those means she couldn't go back in her lineage she couldn't describe her genealogy there was nothing good there it was just like you and me we were nothing good we had nothing to offer him and yet he came yet he presented himself to us yet he offered his hand in Fellowship yet he came down and shed his blood for us there was nothing in our genealogy nothing in our flesh that was good enough but God still came down the prophet said God is not known by knowing genealogy it's by neology you want to know God do what this woman do it get on your knees and worship him God is not known by genealogy it's by neology it's not by the ways of man it's not by The Works of the flesh it's what he's done for us and he placed himself within our reach now it's whosoever believeth in him should not perish now it's whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die he was made the curse that the curse might be removed from us now the curse is no more now we can receive the blessings of Abraham that he took on the curse he became the curse for us don't let the devil tell you that you're cursed don't let the devil tell you that all these that you deserve all these things that are happening to you that everything is going wrong for you don't let the devil tell you that Christ became the curse don't let the devil tell you uh that you've been cursed because you don't believe it this person's such and such way don't let anyone else tell you that because God's saying that I took the curse for you no one can call my bride curse I took on the curse I became cursed now the blessings of Abraham can come to them God is wanting so badly to reveal himself to you and I God is wanting so badly for our fellowship you can think of uh when those three men came to Abraham in the tent uh brother Brown said that they had dust on their clothes so here come these three men to the tent where Abraham was and he of course receives them and they had dust all over their clothes they looked like they had come from a Strange Land they they looked like they were passing through to go somewhere they looked like sojourners that's familiar Abraham was a Sojourner and God presented himself to him in such a way that Abraham the Sojourner could recognize a Sojourner and call him Lord he had dust all over his clothes he looked just like him it was a way that he could see and recognize and understand him and Abraham knew right away that's the Lord when Joshua the captain of Israel was standing there by Jericho he was he was looking he prophesied he was strategizing he was trying to figure out he how he was going to go and strike these rocks when somebody appeared to him he said no Joshua you're not going to strike the Rocks like Moses you're going to speak to these rocks that's how they're going to fall and he appeared to hear was the captain of the Lord's host a pre-figure of the Lord Jesus Christ and so to the general of Israel appears a general in a form that he could understand and that he could appreciate and know and so too the general comes the general to the captain comes the captain now we can think now when Jesus is on the earth uh he said who do Sons the sons of men say that I the son of man am and they say well you some say you are a prophet you know you are Elias yeah Jeremiah so just one of the prophets why they they could not receive him as anything more than that to the sons of men he appeared as a son of man and that's all they could ever receive him as was a son of man a prophet but when he asked Peter the question he said whom do men say that I have the son of man am he said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God why could Peter recognize and understand that how could he know that because he was a Son of God that's why the Revelation could come down to him because he already was a Son of God that's why he could see him as the Son of God and recognize and know that for Revelation comes by God from above it's not given by any man but God knew he was a Son of God so he could answer the question you are the Son of God so now I want to ask you the question you are the bride of Christ to the Sojourner he appeared as a Sojourner to the general he appeared as a general to a Son of God Peter he appeared as the Son of God Peter could recognize him so what will he appear to the Bride As none other than bridegroom saying come to me I desire your fellowship I am the bridegroom that's why God could reveal himself as bridegroom in this day it was a likeness it was something mirroring back it was I don't know a deep calleth to the deep it was something on the inside drawing us now we can recognize and know him as bridegroom why it speaks through what you are it speaks to speaks to what God has elected you to be he's elected lady God's blood is not a treatment for sin God's blood is the cure for sin too often we treat his blood as a treatment I've got a little sin in my life Lord forgive me okay then we run to church but no God's blood is there to eradicate the sin from our life what's the point of it look at how badly he wanted fellowship with us and yet we'll have things in our life that we're hiding in the corners in the closets you know how we do as humans we have things that we try to hide from God as if we could hide anything from God but what is it we're only hurting ourselves we're hurting our fellowship with God God is wanting fellowship with us and here we are creating a barrier creating a wall and God is saying my blood is not a treatment for those sin my blood is the cure the double cure I say tonight if you have anything on your heart that's between that Fellowship between you and God let it go tonight but what use is it what how does it compare to a fellowship with the almighty God God is calling you back he came down so that you can go up with him I think of when brother Branham described that eagle cry that went out over the Barnyard we all know the story very well and he called come out of her my people but she had to do something she flapped her wings God is calling you come out I remember in the Book of Revelations chapter four he called John come up now verse 22 Matthew 15 verse 22. not going to hold you along tonight see how far we get in about 45 minutes Matthew 15 22 it says let me read it from here and behold the woman of Canaan came out of the same coast and Cried unto him saying have mercy on me O Lord thou son of David my daughter is grievously vexed with the devil now notice that she came out of the same coast God places himself first within our reach but there's still a part for us to play I believe you're playing it tonight you've come here you've come to receive from him God while he's passing by Reach Out And Touch the Lord he's the one that gave you the opportunity he's the one that said where two or three are gathered I'd be right there in their in their midst and if you believe that then Christ is here so you can receive from him behold the woman of Canaan came out of the same Coast I'm asking you tonight step out of the place that you built for yourself in your mind step out of the mental battles that you had coming into service tonight step out of it and come out of the same Coast Christ came right up to the borders of Tire inside and there he stood he knew someone was coming and Christ is here in the building tonight he knows somebody's coming he knows that it's taken a while for them to break through the mental barriers he knows you've had a hard day he knows things have happened to you that shouldn't have happened to you but he's waiting for you to come out of the same Coast Christ is waiting for you to arise for you to stand up and take hold of the promise Christ is waiting for you to have great faith God comes down he does everything that he needs to he makes all the preparations he lays all the groundworks he places himself within our reach and he's just asking you reach out now and touch the Lord reach out the Lord takes pleasure in them that fear Him in those that hope in his Mercy I don't know what else I'd like to Hope in those that hope in his mercies here was the woman she was hoping in his Mercy she had nothing else to approach him with verse 23 it says he answered her not a word and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she cryeth after us will we trust when there's no response from God we always try to take Eternal things and eternal thoughts and somehow force it into our Earthly timeline it's a flaw of man we all do it we we try to get God to operate on our timeline God operates on his own timeline God does what he wants when he wants it's our job to pray for his will and to align ourselves with his will that's what prayer is we think prayer is going and accomplishing what we want through prayer prayer is realigning our own will to the will of God that's what prayer is now when God says no what will we do will we stand and be perseverant We Trust in his word will we know that he has a plan where we know that God knows what he's doing or we we lose Faith back off you know let time go by that's that's one of the biggest kills for us as time goes by and we think that God is not able to bring to pass his promise because time went by for us at that time that goes by for us is nothing to God it's a test of our faith the prophet says this you might not know it but just hang on when you are sure that you've met all the requirements when you know that you've done everything that you know to do and laid yourself before God there's only one thing to do hang on to his promise and stay there stay there tarry there stay there a while stay in the presence of God stay until you know his will for sure that you're absolutely certain that it's his will stay there don't be discouraged by by silence God is in the silence too God is in the loud noise remember Elijah there God come down in the thunderings and the Lightnings and then eventually he come down in a still small voice but what if Elijah had left at the earthquake part portion what if he hadn't waited God comes down after a while and that's still small voice verse 25 I love this then came she and worshiped him saying Lord help me son of David didn't work didn't it didn't didn't catch his attention she said Lord help me she couldn't figure out any words these words are so simple now she just came and she said Lord help me it was all she knew how to say and I'm telling you this evening that you don't need any complicated words you don't need to put together a sermon to reach God all you need to do is reach out and say Lord help me Lord help me what else can I say cry out to the Lord and say Lord help me God Honors that God listens to that he's the same yesterday today and forever and if he'll hear her saying Lord help me he'll hear you saying Lord helped me and I love that she was worshiping him when he when she said it there's something about worship worship catches the heart of God there is something about worship the woman when she brought her Alabaster Box and her oil and she began to Pour It On Jesus feet what was everyone doing while she was doing that they were pointing they were coming with accusations they wanted to make accusations against her for who she was and the life that she had lived but yet here she was at Jesus feet worshiping with her tears her here down messy don't be afraid to get messy before God don't be afraid to just put aside all of your reservations and Worship the Lord don't be afraid of what people are going to think of you if you Worship the Lord You're worshiping the great Creator you're worshiping the one who saved you there's something special about worshiping him why because when she was down on her knees and worshiping him what happened there was no accusation that could be brought against her Jesus turned the accusation on its head and it says Simon I have ought against thee he he was taught he redirected it to him while he was trying to talk about the woman on her knees at his feet I'll tell you if you've sinned if you've missed the Mark if if you've done anything wrong come to the feet of Jesus and worship him come to church and worship God don't let that stop you from coming in these doors get before God get in his presence start to cry wipe his feet with it with your tears and you're here worship God because when you worship him he takes control of the rest and he says no you're not going to make accusations against her now she's worshiping me and that's when you're in the service there and you begin to worship God you repent of your sins in the service and say Lord I've done wrong forgive me Lord I've walked the wrong way Lord forgive me I've been with the wrong people Lord forgive me and you begin to worship and lift your hands and there the Devil comes around and he tries to accuse but just today I heard you say just I saw you with him I saw you over there I saw you look at that on your phone and the Devil comes with the accusations but you've cleared it up with the Lord You're worshiping and as you lift your hands and begin to Worship the Lord will not entertain those accusations the Lord will say not right now hush devil hush she's worshiping me [Applause] hush devil My bride is worshiping me and having fellowship with her right now this was my reason for Jesus departing out of the coast and going Vents and placing himself within your reach tonight amen Psalms 34 18 it says this the Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit now that the the scripture also says the sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit a broken and a contrite heart o God thou will not despise that was Psalms 51 17. a broken and a contrite heart o God thou Wilt not despise you know what the word contrite means it means to break to bruise to rub or to wear literally warn or bruised Brokenhearted deeply affected with grief and sorrow for having offended God does that sound like any of us tonight have any of us ever had our heart rubbed bruised battered you put yourself out there we thought that you know thought everything would be taken care of and yet still you were hurt yet still hurt come to you yet still you've been rubbed the wrong way yet still you've been bruised the sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit a broken and a contrite heart a bruised heart God won't despise that God loves that if you have a bruised heart tonight you're in the right place this is the place where God can come and address that bruised heart but you've got to come you've got to worship Him you've got to put it all out before and lift your hands and surrender It All to Jesus the prophet was in a position one time where his his wife and his their baby had passed away and just one of the lowest points of his life and you know what he said he said I tied myself to his word and his word was holy he is my absolute I found out all these other things may fail but Christ can never fail everything else in your life can fail every word of man can fail everything you put together of your own thinking will fail but Christ will never fail if you'll tie yourself into that absolute if you'll tie yourself to him Christ will never fail now your Anchor Holds Somewhere Beyond the Veil it's not even of this world now nothing of this world can tug you I use this example a lot that uh if I have a tug of war with somebody and he's much bigger than me of course he's going to win that tug of war match but if I take my rope and I wrap it around something really big really sturdy behind me and then we have the tug of war contest there's no way that he can move me because I'm not relying on My Own Strength I'm tied to something behind me and when you're tied to an anchor behind the veil now you're tied to something that the devil can't move now you're tied to something different that's not of this world now you're tied to something that he knows nothing about that he can't touch that he can't move now you become like a tree planted by the rivers of water Brandon was asked he said well during that time uh when you were going through all that loss well that's that that searing loss that terrible loss uh did you keep your religion during that time he said no I didn't keep my religion My Religion kept me what I was tied to kept me and if you'll be tied to Christ tonight that's what will do the whole thing that's what will keep you in your time of trouble glory to God sometimes praise is a real sacrifice it costs you something but God loves When Praise costs you something you go through all the trouble in your life and you wonder man you come in battered and bruised on a Wednesday night God loves the sacrifice of praise when you lift your hand despite all that's going on you lift your hand as an overcomer and God Smiles down on that she said truth Lord Matthew 15 and 27 truth Lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's table now we're getting into it she said truth Lord and now we we talked a little bit about her background she was a Canaanite Tish woman she was they call her the siren Phoenician Mark calls are a Greek obviously her background was not the Jewish background so all the words she had is the word that Jesus is given to her right then and there that's all she had was the word of the master right then and there in her season in her time in her day whatever truth the Lord would give to her that's what she would have to go and say truth Lord she had to respect what he was saying and everything that God supplies to you in your time of need we say truth Lord everything that God has supplied to us in this day we say truth Lord and we latch on to that why because God's word won't return unto him void he sends out his word and he's expecting you to grab a hold to it and to tie yourself into that and then his word won't return to him void his word will come right back to him and when it comes back to him what's tied to it you because you believed in his word his word won't return to him void and I say all the truth that God provides to you is enough truth to get you where you need to be all the truth that God gave to her in that moment was enough truth for her to get her the healing for her daughter everything that he said to her was enough it was truth everything that he provided to her everything that he said to her in this situation it was all she had and she said truth Lord and everything that God has provided to us in this day by this message we say truth Lord we say thank you Lord God and it's enough it's enough to get us from where we need to be from here into a Rapture God doesn't provide things haphazardly when he provides a word to us it's enough to get us where we need to be it was enough to get her the healing that she needed for her daughter and the word that he's given us in this day is enough to get us in a Rapture more than enough I'd say that's the way you want to get God be on his hands every morning every night every day all the time constantly just keep seeking keep asking keep knocking don't just knock a little while and get tired and go away just keep standing there Lord I'm here I'm not going to leave I'm on your hands I'm going to stay right here you getting tired of listening I'm having a great time knocking because I know you're coming Lord are you are you getting tired of listening because I'm gonna keep knocking I'm gonna keep knocking by my prayer I'm Gonna Keep Believing I'm going to keep believing the woman kept believing for her daughter I'm going to believe until God gives me an answer he says you've got to be willing to take crumbs how many of us can put our pride aside enough to take Crumbs from God but I'll tell you what you do you take those crumbs you take one crumb today and then tomorrow you take the other crumb sister and then you take enough crumbs and you'll smush them all together and you'll have your loaf of bread you've got to be willing to take God take crumbs God will do what he said he will do if we'll hold on and believe I'll be willing to take crumbs Faith tracks to the word of God faith Finds Its Eternal resting place on the word of God when we place the word of God above our situation above our thoughts above our trials then God can come and take over now we're on the right track now we can get moving in the right direction now we can set the wheels of God In Motion because our faith is on the right track our faith is in the right thing it's in the word of God it's the word that will do the work only the word can do the work we can't do the work ourselves we've got to say truth Lord truth to his word truth to his Bible we say truth Lord we thank you for your word we worship you forward and we rely on it and the word will do the pushing the word is like those big ships that get up by the North Pole and they they break the ice so the other ships can pass by pass behind it the word is what goes out in front of us and does the Conquering we just believe in it we just hold it out in front of us and God does the work and we walk in the path that he has made how would we know any of the heroes of the faith in Hebrews chapter 11 unless they had Faith how would we know of their faith unless they had trials and how is God going to know of your faith how's your faith going to be tested unless you come to a situation where it needs to be tested where what's inside of you has to come out where what God had thought of you in the beginning and he wanted to manifest out through of you out through you and bring through you bring his life through how would we know that unless we had a trial how would he bring that out of US unless he sent something our way that just wouldn't go right to see our reaction to see what it would bring out of us sometimes you've just got to believe God's word you've got to have faith you've got to hold on God's going to throw you into situations where you don't know what's going on you don't know how you got here in the first place what is happening it's kind of like shamgar right he was there he was on his farm and then he heard the drums coming you know he heard them March and they were coming to steal his crops again he didn't have time to think he didn't have time to train all he had time to do was have faith and believe that God would honor his promises to him he ran over to the case that it was it was one of those emergency cases it said break glass in case of philistine Invasion he broke the glass he took the ox goat and he went running and he started smashing him he was smashing him he was smashing the Devils he had Faith he didn't have time but what was on the inside of him started coming out God knows there's something by election on the inside of you and he's wanting to draw that out of you it was his plan from the beginning he was wanting to draw those attributes out of you why God God will never be alone from this point on God will always have you his attributes with him in heaven how much time we got amen Matthew 15 and 28 it says Jesus answered and said unto her o woman great is thy faith be it unto thee even as thou wilt her daughter was made whole from that very hour something about this woman caused Jesus to say great is thy faith I I love this because it doesn't say that she had faith it said great is thy faith and think about this for a minute because God is the one he had so much faith that he spoke his own word in the beginning and he believed it and it caused creation to come into existence so if anyone knows the full Measure of Faith it's God right he knows what maximum Faith Can Do speak a universe into existence and he knows what little faith is because he he was rebuking the disciples ye of little faith and so God says to this woman great is thy faith in other words he's saying the approach that you've had the way that you believe when you had nothing else you still believe the word that I gave to you you were persistent you were persevered and God would say that is great faith the one who held the measuring stick of Faith knew what kind of Faith lay inside of her knew what kind of Faith he was seeing and he said to her great is thy faith she was reflecting something back to him that he understood that he knew that he could recognize she came from another place he came from another place she came not for herself she came for her daughter he came down for him from Heaven not for himself but to save his sons and daughters she became the lowest she became despised and rejected she made herself as low as she could go and God came down and he took on and he'd and he donned an Earthly robe and he was beaten he was bruised the crowns were put on his head and he was made the lowest that he could be made and with his stripes we were healed he God came down and took on the lowest form that he could take and die on a Roman crucifixion but something about this woman she couldn't walk away she wouldn't walk away why the fate of her daughter rested on it I told you about that unconditional love of your newborn baby every parent knows it that they would not walk away they'd rather die than to walk away knowing that they could obtain the salvation for their child and when Christ had that cross on his back and he was lucking it up calvary's hill he was thinking of you he was thinking of those attributes he had in his mind and he was saying I can't walk away so when this woman is in front of him and she is expressing this faith in front of him and she's saying Truth Good there is some desire some pull in her heart that he she could not he could not shoo her away no matter what he would do her faith was persevered she was holding on for someone else and that's what God came to do he came to climb calvary's Hill he was holding on for someone else as those hands were spread wide he was holding on for someone else he was holding on for you and for me that's why God came and when she came into displayed this faith in front of him he recognized it and said that's great faith that's what I came to do that's that's that's my plan that's why I'm here and he saw that inside of her something in this Gentile woman and she said and he said great is thy faith she wouldn't walk away because her child was at stake neither would he walk away because his children his attributes that he wanted to to commune to Fellowship was at stake that's what he wanted there was no way that he was going to come down off of that cross I think of Moses uh when when they when God told him uh raise your hands up before the battlefield and if you raise your hands up like this the children of Israel will prevail and they will win the battle and so Moses hands started getting tired they had to come and hold up his hands they didn't want his hands to slip I'm sure they stood right under they used all their mind make sure that his hands are up so that we can win this battle make sure that the hands are up but God put Christ on the cross one day and his hands were there on the cross and God said I can't afford to lose this battle I'm not going to lose this battle these hands cannot come down if these hands come down then we lose I lose my children I lose my attributes these hands cannot come down so he put those hands on the cross and he nailed them there because he said this battle I cannot afford to lose this battle I will not lose because my children are at stake and the woman was displaying the same kind of faith when God honored her she was displaying his faith right back in front of him and when you hold his very words right back in front of him God can only do can't do anything but recognize it it's his own word it's what he was thinking back in the beginning his word is what was planted in the beginning and now it's come all the way down through time spiraling down and it's coming out inside of a people and when God sees that when he sees his word lived inside of his people now he's going to come back down now he's gonna like we'll meet like deep we'll call to the Deep now he will come and you'll be able to recognize him because you'll be in that likeness of the word where the carcasses the Eagles will be gathered we call that the word right where the word is the Eagles will be gathered so when Christ returns the word presented to us we we can't do anything but be drawn to him be drawn right out of these bodies into a new body why because we're being presented with something that we have been magnetized to so when he appears in the skies what's on the inside will just draw us right out of these bodies and into our new body she showed him something that he recognized she made herself of no reputation the Bible says that he made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death see without even knowing it she was doing what he came to do and Jesus responded to that faith the word for it says it says great is thy faith and that word great I went back and tried to dig into the definition and some of the definitions here are are wide exceedingly great high and large and then when I came across this one I never shouted it said it said loud woman loud is thy faith do you have the kind of faith that can be loud in the ears of God do you have the kind of faith that when you go to prayer God's like oh he's knocking again I hear it it's knocking he's not going away he's having a good time knocking I guess I'll just have to go and see what he's on about I guess I'll just have to go down and answer that prayer that plea that honest plea where he said Lord help me where he ran out of words to say he couldn't remember the scripture he was in the situation it was a dire need he didn't know what to say and he said Lord help me when you do that God is the same yesterday today and forever whether it be for yourself or whether it be like this woman for her daughter if you'll cry out Lord help me God is faithful God is true he does the same thing it's the it's one of the the key stones of the Bible that God cannot change if you respond the way this woman responded if you have the same kind of Faith she had he has to respond the same way he's an unchangeable God amen I'm gonna have to close soon just a couple more quotes here the prophet says this it says great faith will bring you right now this has become one of my favorite quotes listen to this great faith will bring you right now a little faith will bring you out anyhow if you'll stay with it great faith will bring you right now in other words he's saying this my translation if you're filling up your pool with the garden hose it will take a long time but if you're filling it up with a fire hose then it's it'll it'll go a lot faster right so now if you've got a lot of faith you could do it right now you can walk on the water right now you could have your healing right now sometimes the the preaching of the word elevates our faith to that level where we're able to just stand up in our seat and say I receive it Lord I receive what you're giving to me in this service and you get your healing right away and then other times you just have to take that little faith that you have go right back home with it keep that little faith and keep churning with that little faith and it'll bring you out after a while he says great faith will bring you right now a little faith will bring you out anyhow if you'll stay with it I like that great faith will bring you out right now a little faith will bring you out anyhow if you'll stay with it why because that means that there's hope for people like me if I have a little bit of Faith There's Hope for people like me I can hope in his Mercy I can take the same little faith that I have and just keep checking with it just keep checking with it just keep going with it and God will bring it about God will bring it to pass in his own time if I'll keep that same faith and hold on to it I liken it onto uh how many has ever ridden a bicycle and you're riding the bicycle and then you start in the the low gears right so that it's easy to Pedal you're going fast you're going fast why because it's easy to pedal and then after a while you get going then you click it up a little bit you click it up a little bit and then suddenly your Crews move big strides big strikes you're in high gear at that point right so the thing is both gears will get you to where you need to go but one of them you just gotta and then one of them you know big strides so sometimes you have faith to take those big strides and it takes you all the way down the road if you have the strength to do it you have that faith and it'll take you all the way down the road but some of us were just coming up in the rear just pedaling along that's some of us that's the way that we are that's that's just some of us that's the faith that we have at this moment maybe God will raise it maybe God will do that for us but if you don't if he didn't if he doesn't you keep going with your little faith because the prophet said it'll bring you out anyhow some of us has great faith that'll just perform Miracles some has Faith just to hold on till it happens Amen Let me find a place to close here amen Faith takes its Eternal resting place upon the word of the Lord upon God's word which is the Bible Faith takes its Eternal resting place upon the word of the Lord I encourage you tonight to just say truth Lord I believe what you've spoken to me I believe that you can do it I believe that there's no supply chain issues with God I believe that God can supply the bread that I have need of in fact he said he was the bread that came down out of heaven God bless you friends let's Stand Together let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we thank you that you were that bread that came down out of Heaven Lord when we had no way to reach your level it came down two hours oh God Lord you spoke to us you gave us your word you gave us the blooper and you gave us everything that we would have need of Lord and Lord now help us to have the faith to hold on help us to have the same kind of Faith like this syrophoenician woman Lord to be perseverant with it oh God so know that our little faith will bring us out anyhow after a while Lord to hold on enough Lord Lord we know that you're faithful Lord that you'll always keep your word you'll always watch over your word Lord you're faithful and you will perform it oh God it won't return to you void oh God Lord I pray that you bless this congregation tonight thank you Lord for their po Lord Lord for all the hearts present Lord I pray that you would touch them in a special way Lord help them to keep Faith Lord God to hold on to that little faith that they have Lord I pray that you would help them Lord may you fulfill your word in their lives oh God Lord as we express your traits and your attributes Lord as your word lives in us oh God Lord that you might see yourself in US help
