TRANSCRIPT
========================================
outcome you know I I can't help but mention what's happened this week in the incident with sister Kelly and she's here this morning which surprises me actually but I just want to ask this do you would you like to get up and share your testimony this week of God's protection or do you want me to read your text I'll give you the choice or say no to both this is just too good this is too good to pass up and just when you just when the devil just when the devil starts to put Little voices in our mind that somehow God isn't watching over us as Angels aren't around you have an incident like this this week and it becomes crystal clear to Sister Kelly it should be crystal clear to us don't you ever believe that lie the Bible says angels are encamped around those that fear Him He knows what's going on he'll watch over us he'll protect us praise the Lord well I can certainly say it is a pleasure to be here I was thinking about this on the way I was like how do you condense that you know but um so take your time off I'll cut into my sermon a little bit um so long story short is as most of you know this some of you don't but I am an Outreach marketer so I drive a lot and we were having a car show at work I travel an hour to work and had been Marketing in Adrian and I was running five minutes late whether naturally or spiritually are God's hand so I made it and I was five minutes from work and I was listening to a sermon and I had I told Brother Paul that God was kind of digging into my life and I appreciate that because sometimes you need God to dig into your life you know and he was digging in and just kind of rooting everything out and I was having Church in my car and I was like I'm like I'm running late for this car show and I'm like I'm gonna pull over I'm gonna pull over and I'm gonna pray and I was just repenting of things and getting things cleaned out and I thank God for that um that was just God's mercy but I had been driving down the road and I heard sirens coming up behind me and I pulled over and I'm like I wasn't speeding you know was I speeding sometimes when I'm having church I speed you know you don't know that so I um I pulled over and the police officer zoomed past me and um again I wasn't paying attention I pulled back out but that slowed me down too slowed my speed down and I looked up ahead and I saw the cops Circle back and I'm looking at it because I see all these lights flashing in the distance and um before I knew it I saw a car coming straight at me in my Lane and I'm like you you know things happen so fast you're not you don't have time to process and I looked at him and I could see him in his windshield and he was not slowing down like at all and before I knew it he hit me head on and all I remember is the impact and the airbags going off and I could feel the car just sliding and sliding and it just kept sliding and all of a sudden I came to and I was like what just happened and the first thing you're thinking is you know what's going on what's wrong and um I managed to get out of the car and get on the ground and I was I looked over and all of a sudden all these cop cars were everywhere like usually you have one or two you know there's cops everywhere there was and I looked behind me and there was a guy the guy who hit me on the ground cops were over him his face was on the ground they were arresting him and I thought to myself I thought well this is he must have really done something to Merit this kind of you know reaction and all of a sudden there was SWAT teams there was all this stuff long story short I got they took me to the hospital but on the way to the hospital uh before the hospital he was yelling at me and he was saying um he's like they were taken with a cop car and he goes I'm sorry I'm sorry I was trying to kill myself and I just looked at him in the cop beside me just like don't even pay attention don't pay attention to him and I got to in the I got in the ambulance and the paramedic said to me he says do you know what happened and I'm like not really you know and he says well he just tried to kill three people shoot them and I thought okay oh my gosh okay so I went to the hospital they had to I'd have a full CT scan and a bunch of X-rays and everything and I'm getting this text message from work where they're like well um you know there's a lot of commotion going on and I'm thinking oh they must know about the shooter here to find out he had open fire at the car show at my work and the employees were parked at a parking lot on the other side and all the classic cars were going to be in the parking lot of the building and it was a domestic dispute and he was waiting on an employee and he opened fire and he did kill her she didn't survive the night he shot another family member's son damaged his arm and then he took off and just so happened to hit me head on but it allowed him to be apprehended which was the grace of God as well they said that I had just purchased this car two weeks ago my little bumblebee it was yellow and they said that the car being the size it was and this the uh the build it was saved my life and I really truly believe that that was the Lord because I had felt led to sell my car my other car and God opened a door for that and um and they said just the fact that you came out of it they estimated that he hit mid 85 miles per hour and the fact that I came through that was just a miracle of God's grace and his protection and his you know that's how quick your life can just be snuffed out and you want your heart right with the Lord you want everything right with the Lord like I've come to realize nothing else matters nothing matters but the Lord and his grace and I'm so thankful and I just wanted to say this last thing and then I'll shut up um I had a lot of phone calls and my employees are traumatized some of my staff they actually watched him shoot her so they're traumatized and a lot of people call me and they said we're watching the news and we do not see your car we don't see it where is it on the news and the state police called me and they said the funny thing about all of this is from the air from up above your car was hidden under a tree you hit a tree I didn't know I hit a tree you hit a tree and nobody could see you you were hidden from above and a friend of mine said to me that branches of trees often mean wings and I thought about being under his wings that from the above you know sometimes you just see the Collision you just see the crash you see your mistakes you see all the things and God looks down and says yeah but when you're under the blood you are under my wings and so I just really am thankful and I just I'm so thankful for all of you I've been you've all reached out to me and I am just touched by your kindness and your prayers and God is still using me for some reason thank you this one that was shot as your co-worker right yes she was a co-worker and um she had I don't know if she knew the Lord or not but she she had time and she um yeah she was an employee so if you were to write arrive right on time if I would have five minutes later you would have been part of the shooting no doubt yep I would have pulled into the parking lot right when he was shooting her had I been five minutes sooner your mom says you stopped at McDonald's for a drink needed a drink you know and ironically the person in front of me was taking a long time and I was getting annoyed and we get annoyed with our delays you know and I I was like oh I need to go I need to go and God's like you're not going nowhere I just thought of that you don't feel so bad to stop them by McDonald's and it makes me feel good because sometimes you can be in the will of God okay praise the Lord thank you sister Kelly praise the Lord amen I guess I'd like to preach a whole sermon on this but I just thank God that he shows us through these things our lives are in his hands and you know we're in a time where there's nervousness sometimes about our protection year and we've talked a little bit about it and the people that are going into churches and shooters for whatever reason going insane but but you know what and I I was a part of a two or three hour meeting with the deacons a few months ago and we've done everything to talk through scenarios and just talk through different things our brother here from Pennsylvania helps churches and talk about those things because we live in that reality but a greater reality I never want to forget and and for I'll just mention again we have things in place and we have different ones and different a plan but ultimately I am not afraid I'm not afraid because when you have an incident like this God knows what's going to happen and I'd rather be in his protection than any other protection man can offer and and and even so we're not doing enough here I've heard that come back from some we're not doing enough listen uh it's enough with the Lord's protection he knows what's going to happen he'll watch over us and this is an example of that can you say man and I'm glad to be around his angels as protection there's Angels around us and our children because the times we live in we could not get by without it so we rejoice in this testimony I'd like you guys to put that up on Facebook if Sister Kelly doesn't mind I want to tell the world and tell the devil that God is watching over his people I'd like to also say that it is something about when she pulls over and is moved by the message and makes it a priority for God going deeply into her life and she shared more details to me but when someone is being moved by the word and we're willing to repent and go let God go deeper into things even from her childhood she said God dealing with things and are getting it out and she's willing to stop and pray and weep in Brokenness let me tell you something somebody is going that direction the devil's mad if you're gonna do that the devil's going to get angry and and so her doing that to me you're in the light of Duty and brother Ram says when you're in the light of Duty God's going to watch over your life she was in the line of duty what she was doing amen she was right in the perfect will of God and a five-minute delay to pray and deal with something deeply God's hand of protection was around her God was with her can you say amen and sometimes you're in the will of God to stop at McDonald's as well I'll catch that from my wife for saying that praise the Lord God is good amen let's Stand Together read the word together oh let's give him another hand God you're so good praise you to God my my uh yeah I had Matthew 25 is where we want to read and I had a couple of announcements here just remember RSVP for Sister Miriam for the couples Fellowship coming up this month that's uh August uh at 19th brother Chris Moritz from Cloverdale will be here from Washington Canada and then it will have the Tri-State Sunday night so we're looking forward to that the deacons said that we'll have the Lord's Supper August 27th this month so lots of good things coming up want to thank those who give towards the parking lot recoding God bless you for your giving we got that done and we're about we're over half now raising the funds for the HVAC and so we appreciate you continually giving to that till we have the rest of those funds God bless you for it and supporting our missions as well God bless you richly Matthew 25 we want to read together in the scripture this morning and it's good to be here amen good to be here and that's a very encouraging words from our sister and for her to come out of that alive on so many levels is just God's grace to her and we're grateful Matthew 25 and verse 1 Matthew 25 and verse 1. then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were foolish foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept so you notice that the bridegroom coming there was a delay in his coming or there was a a temporary tearing that took place I believe we live during that time while the bridegroom Terry they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps so all the virgins arose by the Midnight Cry that were getting close and the bridegroom is coming all of them arose and were were stirred by that and the foolish that otherwise give us of your oil for our lamps have gone out but the wise answer is saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterward came also the other virgin saying Lord Lord open to us but he answered and said verily I say unto you I know you not watch therefore for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh and we can say Amen to the word of God Amen I want to speak on enough oil to finish the journey enough oil to finish the journey father bless and anoint us Lord as your servant this morning when we speak of oil we speak of your anointing oil that was poured over lord the kings and Lord the prophets and the King David Lord was anointed when he was young even and Lord this spoke of your holy spirit being the thing that separated those men as being their positions Lord when you pour that anointing oil upon them then you separated them for a particular distinct service Lord God I just pray that that would happen here this morning as you set aside this people Lord to be called by your name to be called by the message of the last days but Lord we realize we can't get by without your anointing oil Lord I pray that you'll come and speak through US those anointed words today through your servant I'm weak within myself but I'm strong with the word of God you've given me father and I pray you'll bless every heart and every soul under our care this morning may they be under your care I want to pause and say thank you for the protection over sister Kelly's life Lord and to see that she was in the line of duty following you and obeying you Lord and and just being mindful the spirit Lord and being in the spirit having Church in her car she said Lord these are the things that please you and Lord when we do something that pleases you then you come around and answer supernaturally with your protection and your love over her life God we're thankful that she wasn't no bones were broken father and she could have lost her life in so many ways but God she's here the first Sunday morning worshiping you glad to be alive Lord and so today is a congregation we say thank you thank you Lord for preserving her life and we pray you'll continue to be that over our lives as well we commit the service to you now in Jesus name amen unless you may be seated Matthew 24 and 25 in the Bible we have Jesus giving the prophecy of the 2000 years after he is gone and particularly their prophecies and specifics about the end time and this is why these scriptures should be very important to us and any Christian really should be interested in Matthew 24 and 25 as Jesus begins to break really the Seven Seals uh in his own way and the way he did it John has the Seven Seals and by Vision at the Book of Revelations but Jesus actually Expresses in Matthew 24 and 25 uh all Seven Seals and you can take what he says and and put it place it right on the seals in the Book of Revelations and so he's he's elaborating and speaking Prophecy of the specifics of what will happen in the end time and when you get to the very end though which is what we live in when you get to the very end because he had just said a few scriptures earlier he said no man knows the day or the hour no man knows the day of the hour this is a secret that God the final end the final hour the final time of his coming he keeps it secret only the father knows and so it's not something that he would reveal and make it plain here because that's something that's only going to be revealed in Rapture time it's only going to be revealed to the to the to the bride in other words this isn't something that everybody will know and because they know what they can be a part of this will be the secret part and so the seventh seal will be a secret which is the coming of the Lord don't get lost in the terminology here I want to explain it so even a 13 year old can understand this morning Jesus is speaking of all the end time events but when we get to the very end then he breaks in Matthew 25 he breaks into Parables for the seventh seal so and he had to do that because that's the one that's secret that's the one that's hidden and so all the others he's being specific about but when he breaks into the seventh that's when you find Matthew 25 and that's when you find the seventh seal hidden in Parables but how many knows that Jesus said about Parables when he was asked by the disciples why do you speak in Parables he said because it's given unto you to know the mysteries of God it's not given to everybody but it's given to you so if he breaks into Parables for the seventh seal I'll tell you our curiosity are we ought to be sitting at the edge of our seat saying what does this mean because this is where I live right now I'm at the end time God's not called me to Luther's day or Wesley's day he's called me to write at the closing seconds of time and I want to catch this mystery of what God's doing and so the you know the rest of the world may not care about Matthew 25 although there is a curiosity there's always a curiosity for man to know the day or to know the hour the devil would like to know the actual day and the actual hour of the coming of the Lord all men have wanted and and Scholars would love to know that but God says that's something I'm going to hold and I'm going to break it into three Parables and I'm going to Parables to the young people parables are like stories and they're things that are speaking of something else and these Parables speak of the coming of the Lord for the seventh seal to be hidden by a parable every Christian should pay close attention then to this scripture and these Parables when God breaks open the mystery of the seventh seal then that should perk our attention can you say Amen because that's you know why I'm interested in it because that's the part of the book that I'm a part of is the last minutes of time the last seconds of time just before the day and the hour I'm living in that time and so when he speaks of these things I'm interested because I know that's the part of the book if you get a chance listen to Wednesday night because that's this book of redemption that has our names in it has our place in it and that's your true identity we spoke of those things Wednesday night I know where my identity is I don't live in Luther's day I don't live in Jesus day my day is right now right before the Rapture that's my time and that's where my name is in the Book of Life and so I had to catch that Ministry while it's going on how many would like to catch the mystery of the rapture that's only for the bride can you say man that's one I want to definitely catch it's a revelation that's one Revelation I want to get is the Revelation for the rapture Hallelujah so now the first Parable in Matthew 25 is very revealing as it covers virgins starting a journey toward meeting the bridegroom well that's perfect because we know at the end of the book there's a marriage we know enough scriptures to know there's a marriage between Christ and his bride so now in the parable it's perfect because you have virgins starting a journey toward meeting the bridegroom they start not the rest of the world but these virgins these sanctified people these Christians they say my it's time for the bridegroom to come and so there's a call go ye out to meet him and I'm going to begin this journey and this of course so the children understand the bridegroom is the type of Christ that's Christ and then there's not one virgin but there's ten virgins and why why wouldn't you say well there's just one because usually a man marries just one woman in this Parable there's ten virgins because we are a many-membered bride it's not just one person but we're a mini member and bride so that's why it says 10 has many can you say Amen so showing it will be a mini-membered bride not one person it's perfect because at the end there's a marriage spoken of throughout the Bible and I'll just say these things Paul said I have espoused you to one husband he's starting to use the term he said I've come and brought the message Paul said and I've espoused you there's an engagement and I've espoused you not to many husbands but to one husband so there's a marriage going to take place there's a courtship there's an engagement and there's a marriage and the end time supposed to take place and so then we then we find that Paul uh said I have a spouse you to one husband he also said in Ephesians that God would have a glorious bride without spot without wrinkle he will prepare himself a spotless bride to marry and she'll be without blemish I mean he's familiar with that scripture so that he will provide the atonement to sanctify this bride and he sanctifies her so that he can marry her it's almost like creating your virginity because we know in our flesh we weren't born virgins we were born with a sin nature but by the power of the word he creates our virginity and shows us what we were from the foundation of the world that before sin came in the picture I was in the mind of God thus I'm a virgin unto the Lord because he Sanctified my life that's power friends when you're creating virginity but he says I'll wash her I'll make her a spotless Pride before I marry so then he he she will be a virgin and then when you go to the Book of Revelations it says the marriage of the Lamb has come and the pride hath made herself ready praise be to God lay in some foundational things that at the end it's about a marriage at the end time it's about a spiritual union with you and Christ that's what it's about that's what the parable speaks of and so now the marriage has come brida made herself ready the end time is not you know it's about a marriage it's not about a it's not about a a dating relationship with Christ when it gets to the end it's not this casual dating of Christ or a part-time on-again off-again relationship with Jesus Christ can I get an amen you may be God maybe have winked at your ignorance in past days about that but not today we're not called to a dating relationship we're not called to to to come in relationship at a camp meeting with them and get all stirred up and then we we deny him later while we're at school we're not called to a dating relationship we're not called to a a clicking uh on again off of him I'm in a relationship you click the button and you're in a relationship two weeks later you unclick say I'm out of a relationship that's not that's this generation how they go about relationships might as well take a minute and say this generation has cheapened relationship has cheapened marriage has cheapened commitment friends are not committed anymore within a drop of the house somebody drops a friendship there's no loyalty can you because it's an adulterous generation and nobody's loyal to one husband or one spouse or one person for life completely for life it's in and out if I Don't Feel Like Loving in you anymore I'll just drop out of the relationship I'll just divorce you it's a divorce generation and spiritually it's a divorce generation because people go to a cat meeting go to a meeting they they give themselves okay I'm all excited and then all of a sudden they're right back to the things of the world that's not a marriage relationship I'm gonna preach this morning that's not a marriage relationship in the end time it's not a dating relationship it's not an on-again off-again I kind of come and go as I and commun and people approach church that way as well if it's convenient for me if it fits around all all of my schedule then I'll be there but no uh this is a marriage can you say of mine this is not about church attendance this is a union between you and Christ Hallelujah this is an eternal Union of your soul this is not a dating game it's not clicking on and off this is a union that seals you into a marriage for life and there is no returning to other lovers that's it you make a vow to Christ and you're coming Union with him it's a marriage it's more than a feeling more than an infatuation can you say amount it's more than a Disney love this is the Disney generation and love has been interpreted and relationships have been interpreted by Disney and by Hollywood and then they spill that over into their relationship with Christ so I can just take you or leave you if I don't feel it amen my wife had sent me something here and and I I was going to read sister Kelly's thing off my phone forgive me for one service having my phone the deacons don't want us to have our phone in church so forgive me but my wife sent me this I don't know if you got it but I just thought this is amazing because it's such a generation living on feelings and then interpreting this this fellow John Piper says my feelings are not God God is God my feelings do not Define truth God's word defines truth my feelings are echoes and responses to what my mind perceives and sometimes many times my feelings are out of sync with truth when that happens and it happens every day in some measure I try not to bend the truth to justify my imperfect feelings but rather I plead with God purify my perceptions of your truth and transform my feelings so that they are in sync with the truth what you feel is not to be interpreted as truth your conclusion based upon your feelings and we do not approach our relationship with Christ with feelings because you may not have the right feelings tomorrow morning this is not a romance where I don't feel it anymore I'm not feeling I've had men come down I'm going to divorce my wife even in this church I've lost my love for I've lost my love while you didn't have the right love in the beginning you didn't have the commitment of the building beginning because someday the feelings will be gone that all that might be gone and your life's trials my challenge but the commitment still stands it's more than an infatuation it's more than a feeling it's more than Disney love praise the Lord so it's a many member bride but yet this Parable says they're split into two categories I didn't split them up God split them up and this this uh splitting into categories God split them into two wise virgins and foolish virgins he's the one that split it up and that's relevant to the end time because it and that that comes in direct conflict with the ecumenical Antichrist spirit that says we're all the same and if you believe in Christ we're all the same and Jesus teaches it different in the end time we'll all come together in a great Oneness with one another and we all believe Christ that we're all the same in my heart I want to believe that and in my heart I don't have a right to categorize people I don't have a right to judge people say you're a foolish virgin you're a wise virgin we don't personally have a right to do that even though we do it sometimes I don't like to be put in a category you don't like to be equipped in a category but we don't have a right as another person to put another person out or put them in your your serpent seat we don't have a right to do that but God God has a plan and God throughout his scriptures God has definitely had categories maybe this is why people don't like God is that they're put into categories sometimes I think God does it to show hey uh if you realize you're not where you need to be then God can give you and at the end of uh three kinds of Believers which if that's God's nature to split people into categories like that even though he offers to whosoever will three kinds of Believers in every Cog in every group of people make Believers unbelievers and True Believers but at the end of that sermon the grace of God says if you've recognize yourself as an unbeliever this morning then come to an altar in your heart come to an altar and say God I cry out to you make me a believer the grace of God is there if your life has all the fruits of serpent seed and worldliness then that's the time you say oh God have mercy on me fill me with your spirit and I just got to believe because we're not out of here yet God will respond to the Cry of every heart and I'm glad of that can you say Amen but he's the one that split it up and and the thing that says we are all one if we believe Jesus Christ we're all the same Jesus taught that the different seeds where they fell in the ground he taught that Jesus said to the religious people you're of your father the devil not your being you're you're acting like the devil you're the sons of the devil that's pretty straight it was the Bible that said that Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated it was Paul who taught the seed shall not be Heir with the shock it was that's all Bible can you say Amen the seed and these are all around the Realms of Christians the seed the Pentecostal shark the seeds shall not be here with a shark he made the distinctions and even at the end time through the prophet the three kinds of Believers so it's not surprising that in a parable about the last few minutes on God's clock there's two groups one wise and one foolish that's what the word of God says but notice all the virgins all started out on a journey to go meet the bridegroom all heard the Midnight Cry Now friends I'm telling you this Parable is not talking about out there it's pretty internal because they're all hearing the Midnight Cry now it's time go ye out to meet him possibly sitting in the same group hearing the same preaching all were stirred out of their sleeping all were stirred up by the word by the Midnight Cry all of them got up and were awoken by the cry all of them got up and all of them trimmed their lamps which is part of the process of spiritually trimming a lamps you can have a lamp a vessel and the vessel speaks of Your Vessel for the Lord this vessel and so you can have a vessel but you see you've got a a wick in there if you guys want to show that picture of uh just so we have a visual for the young people and everybody else uh this is kind of what it looked like back in Jerusalem the days of Jerusalem is kind of what it looked like and this is what he's speaking of in the parable is that you got a vessel you got the oil in the vessel and then you got something sticking out the wick sticking out the end and this is the type of thing if you didn't uh and maybe some of you know this most people know this if you don't keep that trimmed at the end it won't burn right like that and if it doesn't burn bright in the darkness you won't be able to see so there's some components there and for the parable all the components are there as far as trimming the laps they Rose it's dark out it's midnight it's become gross Darkness upon the people it's a dark time how many how many would say say I in the last two years we're living in darker times I'm feeling it in my spirit if you got any God about you you know this is different now we're in different territory this is dark dark times we're living in it's not like 30 years ago when we tend to Camp so went to meetings this is a darkness that is set into us people are questioning where they stand people are fighting mind battles can you say man we're in a different time which lets us know we need to trim our Labs we need the oil like we've never needed it before we need to be established and know that we have a reserve of oil back can you say mine or we won't make it through this Darkness oh Darkness Darkness Darkness so much out there you know a few weeks ago that all the writers in Hollywood went on strike in New York they were on strike and they were saying in the news this is bad because this shuts down all new movies being written and I raised my hand I said praise be to God let it happen forever that no more trash could come from that place in California and New York because that's been the major cause of Mines people feeding out even Christians feeding on it that's been the cause of this Darkness Minds can't think clearly anymore because you've been fed Hollywood praise the Lord amen and so it got quiet right there okay I'll get quiet too I'll take a drink if you don't know what's real getting more dark you better get on your feet and recognize this Darkness right I've been a Christian since I was 16 years old and I have never since in the last two years watched gross Darkness take even some Christians life and they start to it's it's unstable don't know where they stand and I don't have a hatred towards that I'm just saying oh God what's the answer I can tell you this sermon I preached this morning couldn't get away from it about a month ago I got this note in my Bible and it just says the last minute Discovery is that you don't have enough oil that's what this sermon comes this isn't just some concocted thing that's what God told me to preach on this morning every individual needs to be established and know that they have the reserve there's nothing more important than the oil your money your job your career your house anything your boyfriend nothing and sister Kelly said it nothing is more important than God sometimes it takes an incident like that to drive sister Kelly any of us it's a shame sometimes it drives us to that sobering feeling wow we're at the last days why am I making such a priority on other things when the priority should be the oil do I have the oil do I have a reserve of the oil because in this current Darkness I won't survive without the oil praise be to his name amen they're all stirred up they get up they trim their lamps all the same group doing all the same things now maybe wearing all the same things but something happens they started a journey towards the Lord all together towards the bridegroom but without this group was without the most important thing they began the journey without the most important thing and the discovery was I don't have enough to finish the journey I don't have enough to make it through to make the journey and to finish it and we learn from this Parable if you don't learn anything else the tragic end I I read to you the rest but the tragic end to starting a journey without the most important thing that's why I enjoy our young people to go to camps and to hear the preaching of the word because no matter what happens if that heart is looking for and seeking the Holy Ghost and that Minister can be used and God makes the connection it happened for me at 16 years old it was an eternal connection and if that happens we want to provide the environment because there's no greater way for them to start the journey not to bring in the message for years and be in a message church that they'll they'll give out eventually but to start their Journey with the oil can I get an amen start it's better to start and if there's discovery that I don't have what I need you can start today you can start right now God I want to start this journey all over because I realized I didn't start it the right way the most important thing is for me to seek the baptism of the Holy Ghost and his oil in my life and be honest about that because there's many coming to me and discovering discovering and I say praise God you're discovering this now it's time to lay the right foundations and say I'm praying for one thing in my life and that's the oil I said a few weeks ago you never have anybody come up for prayer hardly at all say I'm seeking the baptism the Holy Ghost it's usually for healing it's usually for something else and God can provide all that but I'm telling you as a minister I can count on one hand in the last 10 years how many people have come and asked would you pray with me that I receive the true genuine oil the Holy Spirit In My Life and if we're not asking for it God says you have to ask what father would not give what his children would like Jesus said and those that asked for the Holy Ghost will not the father give it to him they started the journey towards the Lord and realized they couldn't finish the journey because they didn't have enough oil if you were to try to think of an example in illustration and I guess it's any kind of Journey I guess you could plan a camping trip and you're going to go across the country and maybe meet someone special at the end of the trip maybe somebody special in California or Arizona I've got a lot of special friends in in Arizona but you're going to meet someone at the end but you got a month of and you're going to make it a camping trip you're going to need a lot of things for that camping trip especially if you don't have all the conveniences of life you're going to have to think it through you're going to have to and there's a lot of campers here Josiah and his wife and different ones in the church they're campers I'm not my idea of roughing it is Motel 6. and I've done a little camping I did a bike trip across Michigan with the boys across Michigan and we'd camped out every night of course we would stop by restaurants during the day so it wasn't really bad but I found out what it was like to camp out and you got to have what you need and you're going to be in the wilderness if you go across the country you're going to be in the wilderness you're going to need things you're going to need food with you because if you're going to Wilderness you don't have a place just to conveniently go buy food you're going to need food you're going to need snacks I bring a lot of snacks when I do things when I go overseas I can't eat the food very much so one of my suitcases is full of snacks you're going to need things you're going to need to think about this trip in this journey what do I need what's essential for this journey towards the Lord you better think it through so I need my food I need my I need lots of stuff I need snacks Twinkies whatever I need to you know and you're going to need some warm clothes because it's going to get cold on the journey money probably not very much he caught it because you're not going to be around Walmart you're not going to be you're going to be in the wilderness you're going to be around lots of stuff but you're going to give me so your money is really no good and I can tell you I can tell you that where we're going in this marriage with the bridegroom your money doesn't really mean anything you can't buy your way into this your retirement that you have set up God bless you but don't you ever let that be a security our security has to be in the Lord today and this kind of Journey Through the Wilderness your money is no really no good Your Nest Egg isn't really any good I've had Brothers come and say I had a nest egg for 20 years and now the economy now it's gone it's finished it can be gone just like that friends I've said it over and over again we cannot put our trust in worldly Goods or worldly things or houses or lands we can't put our trust in governments or any of these things we have one place especially right now to cling to and make sure we stay filled it's about the holy spirit it's about walking in his spirit it's about remaining filled with the spirit it's about getting of the Holy Spirit if we don't have it it's all about the oil in the last days it's about the oil you get your warm clothes you know you get lots of stuff and then you think you will you're supposed to think you will have 12 hours usually out of that day that it's going to be completely dark and so you won't have any light so you have to think about light you're going to need light you're going to need flashlights I'm being practical so you understand if you forgot the flashlights and you're going a month 12 hours out of your day it's going to be complete pitch Darkness is anybody catching your spiritual journey and anybody catching the Midnight Hour that you live in The Darkest Hour the Midnight Hour you're going to need light you're going to need flashlights and guess what what if you went and you had flashlights but you didn't bring the energy for the flashlight oh I forgot the batteries that would be me on a camping trip but when you think about being in the dark for 12 hours and the Animals because that's another thing to think about the vicious animals that come out of the woods and you're gonna in in snakes and all these other things you got to think you're going to have to have some weapon against the animals you're going to have to have some protection can you say Amen so you're thinking this through a head because on this journey and it's so true to the Christian Journey it's not going to be at Walmart it's going to be a Wilderness you're going to have dark times can you say Amen you're going to have vicious animals come at you you're going to have vicious people come after you it's going to be a journey that's not perfect so you need the essential things and one of the most essential things you'll need in the darkness is light is light I want you guys to keep that up because I want that image to be in their minds today and the congregation is mine this is what it is you can trim your laps it can be Burning Brightly but I can tell you if that vessel is depleted or that vessel never got oil to begin with none of this is going to work right and you're going to be traveling through the darkness with just you in your own energy and I'm telling you you can't make it in this hour without the oil Hallelujah can't make a marriage without the oil can't have a family without the oil can't be a young person strong in the Lord without the oil this came to me also when I was speaking a few weeks ago to the young people about a strong young man that can that can stand against a weak girl a strong girl that can stand against a weak Boy or the wrong kind of boy it's strength God is calling for strength in this hour in young people God's calling for strength in the congregation where does that strength come from the oil the Holy Spirit that's where it originates from it's that Your Vessel has got a reserve of the oil that's where we become strong in the Lord so on this journey let me finish this month-long trip to meet someone special you need batteries because batteries would be the essential thing tied to the light that's going to shine to keep you through the darkness its energy to fuel the light and the Holy Ghost the holy spirit is the only energy God has provided in order for you to have a light to make it through this Darkness there is no other psychology there is no other source to go to can you say Amen there is no other doctor God has provided it in the oil can you say it now in this Dark Hour nothing will make this journey or finish this journey without the oil of the Holy Spirit and they didn't have enough because they didn't why didn't they have enough when they started they didn't make it a priority when they started and to every Christian the Holy Spirit is what we should make more important than anything else in our lives I don't know this may be just so simple this morning somehow can it please can it please not just be go in one ear and out the other he that hath he that hath an ear to hear Let Him hear this morning what the spirit is saying to your life that you receive it this morning don't have some message Pride I'm doing it right I gave my heart to God I've seen God in my life although praise the Lord but where are you today we need the Holy Spirit we need to stay filled with the Holy Spirit we need to live in the spirit we need to walk in the spirit we have things coming up and I believe more things cancer we have serious things that we have to attack and we're going to need a David's with faith can you say man with their three stones I'm standing here knowing there's a great giant sometimes in the church his Spirit trying to take people's lives over cause them to have mistrust in the ministry and mistrusting the message I'm dealing with a giant but I stand here as a David with the faith in these three stones of revelation God has given me I'm going to swing that in faith because that's the answer to the Giant do you think I humanly have the psychology to work out problems in the church I don't but I know a God that's bigger than the giant I know a God that's bigger than your criticism I know a God that's bigger and bigger than your instability he can stabilize you the Holy Spirit can stabilize you there's some people still questioning even if they're established in this message they're still wondering about this message I want to see you established in strength can you say Amen like I said Wednesday night your identity in the book you know who you are you found your place in the book I know who I am so that when I ask you like I asked the young people at Virginia the other day I said who are you I do this young guy I said who are you you'll answer your name well I'm Susie my name is Susie no who are you I just said I'm Susie no who are you I'm Susie whatever and she gives her name because that's what we think you're asking who you are but when God asks it's kind of like when he asked Peter he said Peter do you love me yes Lord you know I love you a few minutes later Peter but do you love me well Lord why are you asking me that yes you know I love you he's probing deeper sister Kelly he's probing deeper third time Peter gets frustrated Lord he I love you well God does really know whether you love him feed my sheep whereas the sacrifice do you really but only God knows if you really love them because we can say it with our lips all day long probes deeper probes are what what is what is your name I'm Sherry LaFontaine and we answer back but in the Book of Life in the book of redemption it's not just our names there it's this book of redemption that was open the Seven Seals taken off it is our true identity and it's not our names in there like Joe's friend or Ormond Neville or William Branham that's not the names of it it's our position in the scripture in the day that is being revealed and you see that's why John get excited John got excited because he's seeing his name in the book well he didn't say John the Revelator blue Glory John I'm in there that's not what he's seen he's seen his day he's seen his hour and he's seen his position in that hour I know who I am I've seen my name in the book and all of creation heard me shouting and dancing screaming so who are you I would love for somebody to stand in this hour I know who I am I believe the message of the last days 100 I believe God sent a prophet William Branham no no no scare I believe he opened the word I believe he took the seals off the book I Fellowship around that I fellowship with the Saints who believe that I'm around those I know where I am where I stand and I may not be perfect but I know where I stand that's who I am and I want the whole world to know it there's no question there's no shakiness there's no wimpiness about it I stand with the people of God I stand with the pastors that are preaching this message I believe it with all of my heart from the top of my head to the soul of my feet that strength that's identity takes the Holy Spirit the oil to feel you that much that there's no identity crisis going on don't overlook what I preached Wednesday night I believe it was for a lot of you because you're in a identity crisis some of you identity crisis you're not going to find your identity on Pinterest you're not going to find it on Facebook you're not going to find it through other books but there's one book you'll find your true identity and that's this book of redemption and I said Wednesday I'm gonna say it again because if you didn't hear it I think the the audio didn't turn out right or something hopefully they can get it post it but you see now it's it is the what is the message then what is the message well it's a gathering of people it's some man with a seventh grade education that brought some of his thoughts on things on the Bible now we have all different interpretations of the message and when's United brought you what the message really is it's the revealing of This Book of redemption which is our book of identity God says finally I'm going to give it back to the people that sons of God can look and say I know who I am now and I'm not listening to my parents who told me I was this or this this is who I really am blessed be the name of the Lord I feel his holy spirit here this morning calling Hearts can you say Amen so I think it's a call when I made a call to the young people that we need strong women strong girls in this generation to be able to stand against weak boys we need strong boys to stand against the weak girls we need strength we need you to stand by the Holy Ghost on the word of God not wishy-washy not living in all kinds of In Between Worlds that's where amnon called Tamar to come and he was living an in-between world a world that was alone and a world out here professing something out here and wearing something out here we need people to be who they are what they confess to be in their heart in their private in their bedroom they need to be that identity wherever they're at that strength can you say man to live in Two Worlds is weakness to live in one world God's world that's strength in this hour and so it was a call for guys and girls it's a call for the congregation but you know what it's a call for it maybe even today it's a call for repentance it's a call for repentance starting from the preacher all the way down this is the call to repent because if we leave the service say I acknowledge he had a good sermon today but if we don't repent God doesn't have anything to work with to get us where we need to be God keep filling our lamps walk in the spirit live in the spirit if you're 80 years old keep seeking it if you're 80 90 years old keep saying God fill my lamp today give me some Reserve Lord you said it's available I know you did something for me at the altar when I was 16 years old but God and remember the people they come the foolish person come and said give us of your oil they were trying to Piggy Bank off of somebody else's oil and you know what they said they said my wife and I were talking about this no we we have just enough for ourselves we don't have a reserved to give to somebody else you're gonna have to go get it for yourself I don't have enough I don't feel like somebody but I do have enough to make it but it's by his grace but I don't have enough to share it with somebody else I've got it for myself and it is enough he is enough to make it to the end the Holy Ghost is enough to get you to the end of this journey the Holy Ghost is enough to get you in a Rapture can you say Amen Hallelujah they're trimming their lamps we have to do that to our laps notice when the light was out there was no when there was Daylight there was no need for a lamp so they didn't recognize they didn't have any oil but thick Darkness came midnight came and they needed light in the midnight time in fact both Rose and realized how dark it was I think everybody realizes how dark it is anybody anybody can see the darkness of this present Darkness this present situation but the foolish did not realize they were missing something until two things the foolish did not realize they were missing something until the delay in his coming came and they all fell asleep and then it got really really dark and they woke up and it was pitch dark in the room and here it was real hard it was real evil oh people are waking up to the fact that we're living in a brainwashed generation with no Revelation because when you have Darkness you have no Revelation no understanding not even Common Sense anymore people are waking up to this generation even political people are realizing they're going what is going on on with this country there's not even Common Sense anymore even worldly people are recognize something's changed in our country the discovery but for these groups this group in that Darkness they discovered I'm lacking oil in my vessel I hope even a child would understand this this morning the vessel when he says the vessel that means our vessel you are a vessel child young person your body is a vessel that's what vessel means we have to trim the wick of our lamp so it does not just have smoke but light if you didn't trim that it'd just be smoke coming out of that Wick it'd just be all flickering and then it eventually go out but if you keep it trimmed and in a spiritual life there is this trimming that goes on in our lives I might be trimming some this morning I don't know but I know God has to come and trim and when we grow up we realize we let God trim our Wick can you say Amen so I can burn brightly trim this off and trim this often trim those short skirts off well don't trim them off actually let them grow longer that didn't come out right go in the message there's a lot of stuff to trim off trim off trim trim so there's a lot of sanctification there's a lot of things that you feed on the word and if you want to eliminate that part you'll be weak as well but you do realize you could stay in the message for 30 years and do all that moving of the Holy Spirit to okay I better do that I better change that yeah we're trying to change that you can do all of the uh clipping of the wick all you want to you catching it but the oil has to be first or trimming the lamps gets old after a while oh boy here he goes again here's that preacher on our short skirts and here he is in our makeup and here and it's not just that it's brothers that treat each other wrong it's bitterness it's you know I try to preach on whatever God tells you it's all kinds it's not just short skirts here he goes again and trimming trimming oh I got trimmed again today why do you want to keep a life of just getting trimmed because it's a lot easier just say Lord I need the oil I need something to energize this trimming can you say man I need something to energize me that I'm excited and I actually can say Amen when he preaches the gospel when he preaches the word that my heart is all into it my heart is in the word is anybody understanding what I'm saying today my feeble way of breaking it down I wish I could articulate it better but listen we all need more of the oil of the Holy Spirit forget all the politics and the message forget all the great preachers and all this going forget all that just if I could get my congregation to focus on one thing Lord do I have the oil and if I have it Lord trim my lamb make me ready I want to finish this journey to this rapture forget about what people said about you the church that's what people do people say things 20 years ago they said something and they haven't got it over it yet it's time to get over it it's time to forgive it's time to leave it alone because in my Bible in the parable it doesn't speak about somebody holding back because somebody said something it speaks about one thing do you have the oil that's what the parable says it ends all about the oil that's where we're at I hope even a child will understand we're the vessel the wick in our lamp has to be trimmed or you'll just get smoke coming out we need to be a burning Shining Light for the message light we need to sanctify Our Lives how many believe that how many want to be a Bernie Shining Light in this Darkness but the greatest thing in all this is the essential thing that we need is the oil this is the essential oils there's only one real essential oil no I don't want to kill some of your sister's businesses you know make all the money you can and if you got something for calmness I'll I'll burn it in my room and whatever but I I really got an oil for calmness I really got an oil for making me feel better I really got an essential oil here it's the most important thing in my life I turned that tape on on my phone I turn that voice on I turn that Bible on my room I can go and even sleep by it I can listen to it I'm letting the oil flow out can you say man I'll let it burn in my room I'll let it burn in my heart because this is really the only essential oil I'm going to be in church I'm going to be where the doors where the words being preached I'm going to sing with all my heart can you say Amen I'm going to be around the Holy Spirit I need more of it I'm going to do whatever I can this is the essential oil that I need hope nobody's offended but listen this is what the parable says for our time it's about the oil so many preachers through the years it's all their Ministries only to trim the lamps man I got to trim those people I got to trim their laps some more and that's all their Ministry Ministers of the Old Testament instead of Ministers of the new testament which has Grace in it which says holy ghost in it Old Testament ministers just try to conform to people and they're always trimming their lamps and sometimes preachers have to do that but listen you're going to get tired of trimming your lamps unless you have the energy of the Holy Spirit this has been such a burden in my heart can you say amen I pray we trust you'll be with it this morning the last minute discovery that you don't have the oil and the strength that we need is in the Holy Ghost I find being honest to the congregation I find I hold back a little bit in talking about this area you know I've been a pastor who who likes to I first of all I don't like to bring a personal judgment on somebody if they don't have the Holy Ghost even though you can have the discernment sometimes to watch the fruit and alive and if it keeps over a pattern then you could probably say in your heart I think they might be missing the beginning part and that's the oil they've gone through sanctification they try to do the right things because Mommy and Daddy said to do it but then the overall fruits is but you see I've tried to be one to hold back making that declaration over the pulpit because I don't really have a right there's there's one place he says we have the discernment to tell within a few minutes whether the person has the Holy Spirit that's one quote then it's the person asked for the REM says how do we how can we pin down this person has the Holy Ghost and brothers says there's not a way in the world for you to do it so because of that quote I back off to getting into a personal Judgment of starting to say and some preachers do God bless them if the Lord showed him that that's fine I was in a camp meeting when I was young and uh you know a preacher was going at it and ministering and very fiery and he pointed to a boy says this is your night to receive the Holy Ghost and he came up he has prayed for and I trust that that boy was truly filled with the Holy Ghost but I as a minister have never done those things and thus you know for sure you better be careful of people's lives because if for somehow that boy didn't get that and he was told by a minister that you did then he goes home and he sees no fruit in his life he still desires worldly things he goes right back to worldly things no evidence no Vindication there that something's changed in his life that confuses that boy because the preacher said I got it and it doesn't look like a habit he might be confused the rest of his life I think we need to have a care and what we personally judge someone and maybe this is why I'm hesitant to preached messages that are so strong and bold like this morning to challenge you by the scripture because it's a scripture that's challenging you in the end time it's about the oil do you have it or don't you have it it's Jesus that preached this sermon for our time and so I hold back because I don't want to be that way I've been in meetings and even as a young boy watching that I thought God if you ever call me the mystery I want to be careful because I don't want to confuse that young person I you know whatever and I tend to be a pastor too and I'm saying these things I didn't expect to say it but I tend to be a pastor too who likes to encourage if God has done something in your life you know if you've gave your heart to the Lord I want to celebrate if you're baptized I want to celebrate that with you if if you have God do something in your life I want to sell it at God because the Holy Spirit can do things in your life way early in your journey but you don't have it in your soul yet but the Holy Spirit can deal with you the Bible says that you can't even come to repentance unless the Holy Spirit leads you to do it the Baptist ways in he'll come and you mechanically do it no that heart has to be being led towards repentance by God then the message is preached and there's a connection There's real repentance that goes on you can mechanically intellectually say I'm sorry I Repent but there's no heart in it it's God that leads you to repentance it's it's the holy spirit that leads you to be baptized it's the holy spirit that does it to sanctify your life and a lot of ministers attach sanctification to the Holy Ghost if you get the Holy Ghost you'll stop doing this and stop doing this and stop smoking stop drinking and I'm leery of that because I know it brings the power in your life to overcome things but the holy spirit is deeper than just sanctifying your life because there's people that sanctify from worldly things and they don't have the Holy Spirit they're completely Sanctified they're our Holiness groups that would go Way Beyond Us in sanctification and living a holy life how many can raise your hand so holiness is important sanctification is important we should sanctify our life but people come only so far and they're dressing right they're looking right they're acting right they're in a message church but the question is but but do you have the oil yet is your heart in this word for this hour so this is this is deeper and it's not complicated because I don't want the young people or anybody to feel today he's making it further no I'm trying to bring it closer to you not further away to say I may have lived a good life I've had long hair long dress I've done the right things I've obeyed my parents praise the Lord but the question is between you and God do I have the thing that's showing the fruits that my heart is in this word of obedience and my heart is here in the message of the hour and this is my heart if everybody goes away my heart is here committed to it I'm in a marriage with this word and only you can answer that question only you can go to God for it but I don't want to be a pastor who limits people and they only go so far as long as they come to Paul Fontaine no no no no I Church no no my church won't do it I don't want to limit I want to say to you boldly and plainly seek the Lord and if you're lacking the oil then be honest about it say Lord I know you did something for me back there and it's real I'll never let the devil take it away from me but my life may be showing signs of depleting here maybe at the beginning and I didn't have the essential thing so now Lord I'm willing to start all over and say I'm going to pray and fast whatever I need to do I want you to know I want to be filled with the true Holy Spirit praise God so I back off a little bit but not this morning I I wanted to make it clear to you that this will all be over someday and this church will be gone someday it might be gone even before the Rapture I don't know how are you going to survive how are you going to make it if you didn't have any friends or any support let some of you drive a long ways you don't have much support where you're at well that's the test of our times because it's not that you lean on other people I love Fellowship too but I don't always have Fellowship I don't always have all the friends but I've got the oil and I can overcome with the oil I can make it through any Darkness with the oil does anybody get anything out of this this morning Hallelujah [Applause] a little afraid to speak boldly you know in your if your heart is not in this word of the hour anchored strong in your personal vessels is not holding this anointing on your soul this anointing of the holy spirit that agrees and receives this message unrestricted I receive it then you may be missing the most essential thing and have all the rest together but missing the most essential thing the Bible mystery in this Parable proclaims it more bold than I could ever do this morning that there are people there are good people that are finding something coming up short of the oil it's concerning the parable is concerning they tried to piggyback off others give us of your oil we have not enough this Christian writer Terry Bain said when you are using oil in the lap you trim the wick so that when you light it the flame will be clear and bright and untrimmed Wick can you give me 10 more minutes he said all of them trimmed their wicks in Matthew 25 in other words they made the worst the most of whatever lamp they had they made the most of whatever lamp they had with oil without it by trimming the lamps they're making the most of it the problem was not the lamp or the wick but the oil five of them had enough oil and five of them did not without the Holy Spirit we may have a perfectly good lamp but no oil to keep it burning some people respond to the gospel and have a correct understanding of the Gospel but they only have an intellectual Ascent to it it has no effect on their lives because they haven't committed themselves to it this is not enough to save them even the demons know who Jesus is but they are not saved James 2 19 you believe there's one God good even the demons believe there's one God in shutter and tremble it's not enough just to believe it's not enough to just say I'm in the message it won't hold you in the dark times young person it's not enough just to wear the right clothes there has to be a personal relationship with Christ's a marriage with you in Christ there are some people who have this kind of faith in God they agree with what the Bible teaches and even accept the truth of the Gospel but they are trying to live the Christian Life in their own power they have never really put their trust in Christ and they have have never received the Holy Spirit to enable them to live out their faith they may know about Jesus but they do not have a personal relationship with Jesus Through the Holy Spirit as a result there's no evidence real evidence of Jesus Christ in their lives they live for this world and not for the Kingdom of Heaven by the way this isn't brother Branham this is a Christian writer I think he's saying it right they live for this world and not for the Kingdom of Heaven they will not have the strength or endurance to withstand the trials and Temptation that face those who belong to Christ because they do not have the Holy Spirit power to enable them you can't do this with your own power you must do it by the power of the oil you want my take on Matthew 25 as I'm drawing this to the close it is foolish to pursue Christ the bridegroom without the oil first hey I didn't call them foolish virgins God did it's foolish to pursue God without saying first Lord fill me with the Holy Spirit it's gambling with your life to think that trimming your lap every now and then at camp and that is enough or going to church or being in the message church or being stirred to wake up by the Midnight Cry it's not enough it's not enough to depend on others it's not enough to to this day to only open your Bible at church it's not enough to overcome this Midnight Hour Darkness with just being a good boy or just being a good Deacon son or no it's not enough in this or it won't get you through got to have the oil first it must be first on the journey and if you are discovering it wasn't then my friends start over and seek him it must be first I want to address something I know some of our young people are attending camp this week and many camps this summer and I just want to say as some teaching from a pastor all right I support wherever the atmosphere of the Holy Spirit can deal with you and be personal with you but I want to say in instruction to our young people because brother Brown made comments that the Pentecostals sometimes in that group they would get off track because a pastor didn't teach them properly young people listen don't ever let others praise and other a person another person's emotion take away or distract you from you really getting a hold of God yourself don't be intimidated by the emotion of another person God may lead them to emotion and he'll an emotionless religion if it's a dry-eyed repentance I don't know if you have broken this but you will be moved in some way if you're ready to give your heart to God you will be moved I don't believe it's a drive-eyed repentance but don't look there and say I must not have got anything because they're shouting and dancing all over the building they got it and I didn't you hold your heart before God because he promised you the Holy Ghost is that okay with everybody [Applause] don't let others praise an emotion take away from distracting you from really getting hold of God yourself and you let the emotion take care of itself in your own life you probably will get emotional but don't dictate it that I didn't get nothing because somebody else looks like they did always be knowing that some of those are getting something real and some of those are just in the flesh and they're not getting anything why how do I know that because I talk to some that come home at camps and things and they go home and they still Bound by pornography they still got the same habits and they shouted more than anybody at that camp it's not in the shouting it's are you getting something real to overcome pornography in order to become the devil gotta get something real so you shut yourself out from all that's going on and not compare yourself with others at these camps and say God I'm here to get something from you I'm not even here to meet my friends I know young teenagers go more for their friends and there's not anything wrong with that you need good friends but I would say to you before you go this week or this summer anywhere I would say Lord I want to let you know I'm not going just for friends with the fun or the volleyball volleyball the message sport I'm not going for the volleyball I'm not going for friends I'm not going there God I'm going to meet you I need something deeper with you Mommy and Daddy all won't always be there and I'm gonna need the oil in my vessel Lord I'm gonna need oil you said you give it to those who are asking for it if you're not even asking then he's not going to give it to you but I'm asking it's my inheritance it's mine can you say Amen taking it for myself Hallelujah then watch your life and watch the fruits that follow the oils first I was telling the young people can I just have a couple more minutes today you excuse me I was going to finish the rest of this Sunday but I'll finish it now with this quote that's coming up but I want to say to you I was at a camp and I received the Holy Spirit when I was 16 years old at byc and there was a evangelist there excuse me brother Harold Hildebrandt was there and all I can remember in my experience some of you have heard this before but for the new ones that haven't heard it I give my life to God when I was I think eight or nine years old mom would remember the age it was down there I think brother Delbert Barnhart was baptizing me these recently sister Paula and then found a picture of it so I have a picture of my baptism didn't know that was around eight or nine years old right Mom something like that give my heart to God repented was baptized back then and then doing all the right things and following and good parents and good strictness and you know confidence and boundaries all that I thank God for it but then something happened to me because I had been in all these message ranks and these meetings heard the quotes heard the quotes heard the quotes heard all these things and uh something happened though that night when brother Hildebrandt was preaching and by the way it was about 10 or 15 of us in my age group Brian and Lucille Erickson Mark Johnson some of my friends Daryl you might have been there but there's a whole host of us that night that received the Holy Ghost still going on with the Lord today we talk about that why don't we get together with them but you know what I didn't get it at the altar I didn't believe I got something was happened to me while I was sitting there hearing the word something was changing me and I was I was I was jolted by the fact that wait a minute I'm not hearing this just here now and going heard that before that before heard that oh yeah my dad talked about that yeah I know that quote something was different something was resonating down here something was rising in me while I was sitting there and I was I was rising in my soul and my soul was screaming Amen to the word of God I receive it amen now I might talk about this oil a little bit more next week and break it down a bit because the oil the Holy Ghost is probably the most debated confused subject not because of God but in this hour Even in our own ranks the Holy Ghost is loosely taught so much to the people that I think people get confused as to what it really is and what the evidence of it is someone I would like to go into that because there's no sense in saying you need the Holy Spirit unless you understand what it is you're seeking so I remember coming on glued my soul was rising and I was hearing it through different ears something was saying hey man to God and I did go to the altar that night but I knew something else had already changed within me I just I just felt it the word was being preached and I personally was personalizing this that he was becoming personal to me the new birth is a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you that's the new birth that's the Holy Ghost it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you not through daddy and mommy not through Camp not through friends he becomes personal this is different but you know what I always say I didn't really know my life had been changed until I get out in my regular routine every day and seeing something that's been changed that's why you can't just say because I was there in a meeting I believe something had changed but you have to watch your life because the Holy Ghost is the Life of Christ of overcoming how do you get to see it unless you're tempted hard to be tempted at a camp so I remember about six months before that I'd go to visit my grandpa up here in Chelsea Michigan and if I stayed there alone with them then man I got to watch TV and got to watch all that I wanted and I stayed up all night Grandpa went to bed early and I watched all kinds of things on that TV things I should have never watched and that was in 19 whatever and I I just fed on it oh boy not being around in TV just oh you're just drinking this stuff in you know worldly bad bad bad stuff nothing there to stop me nothing there not even my conscience what's a message conscience can be pretty strong sometimes I shouldn't do this mommy and daddy is going to see me that's a message conscience it's not about God or conviction of the Holy Ghost it's about mom and dad might judge me you got to have something deeper than that is this okay with everybody and so then I'd feel this terrible terrible thing but I just kept doing it and so then I went to camp and I come back and three or four months later then I was going to stay the night at Grandpa's again so I guess this was a test they stayed the first few nights and then I said I'm just going to go to bed you know I don't want that I believe something was changed in me one night in a moment of weakness and say I'll just try to filter through this a little bit and I'll sit here and I stayed up and I watched a couple things that I shouldn't see and then I got up the next day and the next probably three weeks I lived with such conviction in my heart I said God I didn't want to do that please forgive me Lord help me not to feed on those things I just I felt so bad and it then it dawned on me sister Dawn sometimes she Dawns on me she'll send me a text and send me an encouraging word and it Dawns on me and gives me Faith I'm a weird preacher ain't I Joel you know you know I am might as well admit it okay we're related we can relate by being weird okay I was so but it just dawned on me I said why why do I feel so convicted and so bad because when I would get up oh I felt a little scared my parents will find out but when I got up before I didn't feel this I didn't feel terrible like this convicted like this and that was one of the biggest evidences for me besides going on with this love of truth because remember the Holy Ghost he says when I sin the Holy Ghost he says it'll lead you and guide you into all truth it's associated with truth so your soul is saying Amen to truth even though the flesh sometimes they ouch but the soul saying amen that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost so I was I began to Rejoice because I realized Lord something's changed in me because I didn't act like that before I mean I was so broken about it I hope that's okay this morning and I if I share that with some places I think five people think I'm watering down the Holy Ghost I'm not what I'm not watering it down I try to preach to people hey you still two-thirds of you is still not born again but if the desires change down here and you'll live in that spirit it will overcome the flesh there's nothing more powerful to overcome the flesh psychology will never do it the Holy Ghost is powerful enough if you'll yield to it it'll overcome the temptation so I was rejoicing because I knew God had changed me and something had happened to me young people when you go to Camp here's one of the greatest things brother bam talked about and it's interesting in this quote he says I heard brother Neville say this morning I'm closing now some someone might have been asking why I didn't preach on the Holy Ghost why didn't you do this so there isn't some type of thing in his congregation and that's interesting in itself that you need to teach on the Holy Ghost you need to we need to know and in those some of the Pentecostal Realms it's like okay let's get down to the evidence of the Holy Ghost what is it because they were saying speaking in tongues was the initial evidence the Holy Ghost and you still had a lot of that hanging around and so we need to sell this you need to teach on it and so he didn't do it he just basically explained it in one paragraph they're pressuring him saying when is this going to happen here it is Peter God you know you don't have to have 12 sessions on this it's not complicated Satan's made it complicated here it is the Holy Ghost is the action in you it's a life not an emotion not some sort of fleshly evidence I believe in flesh the evidences I believe we're emotional people and I believe we get stimulated by the word of God like you have this morning you get excited you'll worship you'll Rejoice last weekend at the camp Friday night I was dancing the pastor was dancing the pastor's wife was dancing everybody was getting stimulated by the word of God I'm not against it but don't ever use it as an evidence that you have the oil it's a completely separate thing it's the life it's an it's not some sort of fleshy evidence but it is a person Jesus Christ the word of God established in your heart when I think of the word established it's not here today and going tomorrow something is settled and established in your heart to Quicken every word for of this age that's the evidence of Holy Ghost it's to Quicken every word of this age not Luther's age this age it's to say Amen because nobody else is going to say Amen to it it's to live it it's to say Amen to it right and it takes the Holy Spirit to make the word live for this age that's why he sends the Holy Ghost to make the word for that age to make it live so it's living in bodies not just books and tapes right watch the Holy Ghost In Action not so much in demonstrations but in action what it does according to the word and I say a man amen let's Stand Together be filled with the spirit your lamps trimmed and cleaned look up your Redemption is here the day of redemption is he men's hearts are failing for fear be filled with the spirit your last trimmed and clear look up your Redemption is me sing it one more time before we pray the day of [Music] all men's hearts are failing for fear be filled with the spirit

Revelations we'll walk where the apostles have dried the day of redemption is he men's hearts failing for fear be filled with a spirit your lamb stream and clear ly look up we pray together could you speak to the Lord as you close your eyes and speak to the Lord could you walk to an altar of repentance yourself and speak to him personally you're welcome to come it's about you and God it's about this oil it's about where you're at I know there's a lot of instability in counseling people I know there's a lot of shakiness that you feel I'm shaking I just I'm nervous about things brother Paul I don't know why I'm so nervous I'm I'm not going to belittle you for being nervous but I will remind you that our only stability and establishment in our hearts is that the oil and we know we have it we know we're established in the word I'd like to open this altar this morning if you're not in a hurry I'm not in a hurry that you could speak to the Lord at a level you never spoke to him before and just be honest and say if there is any smearing on of this on the outside and my lips are for it but my heart's not where it needs to be I'm just encouraging you to speak to the Lord say get me out of this this area and take me on to know you raise your hand and say I want to be filled with the oil of the holy spirit in these last days that I could be a wise virgin unto my bridegroom fill me now Lord raise your hands he can fill you right now he can his holy spirit's here sweep over fill your heart just now and I want to be filled I want reserve I need reserves Lord I need this I don't I

that I have the Reserves to make it in the Darkness did you raise your hand and say I've been feeling the darkness moving in a lot more yeah yeah I've been feeling lonely I've been feeling a bit detached from the Lord and I'd like to draw up close in my heart be very close to him I only raise your hands I want to be closer to the Lord than I have ever been before you know don't just just hold that before God and pray as we all pray remember some sisters could pray with these sisters and God bless you would you pray with me earnestly just take this time this morning Heavenly Father we approach unto your throne Lord at this moment we see what you said here in this Parable Lord and you couldn't give us a greater warning Lord to know that we don't want to begin this journey and we don't want to be depleted but we want to know that Above All Things this oil that we have access to is filling our lamps Lord you were even honest with us to say when the foolish virgin came and asked it was too late the door was shut we're even being honest that reality is there every day Lord that there will be a day that you shut the door God save our children God fill our children God fill our young people our wayward children that are away from you today Lord they don't think the holy spirit's important life is important but not the Holy Spirit only you can change that I'm asking you to go
