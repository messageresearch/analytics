========================================
hi everybody Pastor Paul Le Fontaine and literal Life Church in Petersburg Michigan would like to invite you to take the next half hour and enjoy some time in the word of God if you're hungry for more of Christ we believe you can be fed and we pray that you'll be blessed visit our website for more information at literall life. church may God bless you my friend and may the music and message encourage you today we're all on a church journey and we're called to walk by faith there will always be the mountains and valleys in our way but right here in this moment may our strength be renewed as we recall what God has done and how we've seen him move is there anybody here who's found him faithful anybody here who knows he's able say [Music] Amen if there's anybody here who seen his power anybody here brought through the fire [Music] say anybody here found joy in the midst of the sorrow peace in the storm hope for tomorrow and you've seen it time and time again just say Amen sometimes in the darkness it gets hard to see but be bold and courageous and follow where he leads greater is the one who's in us than he who's in the world child of God remember the battle is the Lord if there's anybody here who's found him faithful anybody here who knows he's a to say amen hallelujah oh if there's anybody here from s his power anybody here but through the fire oh just say [Music] Amen anybody here found joy in the midst of the sorrow peace in the storm hope for tomorrow and youve seen it time and time again just say Amen just stand and testify of the greatness of God in our Liv oh if there's anybody here who's found him faithful anybody here who knows he able oh come on and say am oh if there's anybody here who seen this power anybody here brought through the fire Hallelujah just say Amen anybody here found joy in the midst of the peace in the storm for tomorrow and you seen it time and time again just say Amen oh just say Amen oh just say [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah uh we're reading from Deuteronomy chapter 19 we'll read together certain of scriptures when the Lord thy God hath cut off the Nations whose land the Lord thy God giveth thee and thou succeed us them and dwellest in their cities and in their houses Thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land which the Lord thy God giveth thee to possess it Thou shalt prepare the away and divide the coast of thy land which the Lord thy God giveth thee to inherit into three parts and that every Slayer May flee thither and so now he's going to explain what he means by the Slayer and this is the case of the Slayer which shall flee thither that he may live whoo kth his neighbor ignorantly whom he hated not in time past as when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbor to heue Wood and his hand stretcheth forth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree and the head slippe from the h and lith upon his neighbor that he die he shall flee unto one of those cities and live so this is a category of someone who had an accident did it by accident and it was not intentionally done it was uh something was done and they were guilty but it was a bit a bit of different guilt because it wasn't an intentional thing it was an accident and God God thinks of everything can you say amen God has already in his mind he he thinks through everything even for today he knew this day and he's already has his plan right and your trial that you'll hit next week he's already got an answer for so that's our God Amen so so as when a man goeth in wood in verse six it says lest the Avenger of the blood pursue the Slayer while his heart is hot and overtake him i' say I say his heart is hot hot and the his temper is a bit hot too as well and bunch of other things and he overtake him because the way is long and slay him whereas he was not worthy of death in so much he hated him not in the past so here's a category that this person was not worthy of dying of this because his intent was not to do it it was an accident wherefore I command thee saying Thou shalt separate three cities for thee look at this now and if the Lord thy God enlarge thy Coast as he has sworn unto thy fathers and give thee all the land which he promised to give un the fathers if Thou shalt keep all of these Commandments to do them which I command the this day to love the Lord thy God and to walk ever in his ways then shalt thou add three cities more for thee besides these Grace Grace here's abounding Grace you're walking with the Lord and you're growing in him and you love him with all your heart make three more cities to run into when the devil's after you I love it that innocent blood be not shed in thy land which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an in inheritance and so blood the blood be upon thee but if any man hate his neighbor and lie and wait for him and rise up against him now here's a different category and smite him mortally that he die and fleeth into one of these cities then the Elders of his City shall send and fetch him then and deliver him into the hand of the Avenger of blood that he may die different category that's right whole different category thine eye shall not pity him but Thou shalt put away the guilt of innocent blood from Israel that it may go well with thee I want you to remember this statement here's the purpose I want you to put away the guilt of innocent blood the guilt of one who's truly guilty is one thing but I want you to put away the guilt of the innocent that's our God so Satan certainly does not like a minister dealing with these certain subjects as Satan is a professional in using guilt and using condemnation to mess up people's minds especially a True Believer Satan is a professional I hate to compliment him but he's a professional indwelling in the realm of guilt Satan is professional IND dwelling in the realm of confusing Believers Minds I said Satan is a professional in dabbling in the subjects of guilt and condemnation and mixing it with conviction and you remember that's why I spoke about it is just to give a a black eye to the enemy and and show the believer his position and to help in a healthy way separate these things so that we understand them the devil understands them but we must understand them we must understand in our battle every day the difference between condemnation and conviction we must understand that or the devil will wreak havoc with our minds and our and uh and our our condemnation and the different things we experience and the voices that speak to us so Satan sure likes to mess up people's minds in these subjects especially the True Believer and to where the mind and the Spirit you know remember the mind and the spirit is all Satan has left to work with in your body trth when you're born again and the soul is sealed in by God the mind and your spirit and your flesh is all he has left to deal with and so God's got the best part can you say Amen isn't it good to know God's got the the best part oh yes and God sealed himself in your soul yes you know if God was in in in the flesh in the sense he was only in my flesh then that wouldn't be a victory but the victory is is that he's sealed in my soul the best part and from there there can be such a power to take over my spirit to take over my mind to take over my flesh can you imagine how supernaturally it is to happen that a human being can live so yielded to God and filled with the spirit that it actually the Holy Ghost can bring a body that was net with that will never inherit the kingdom of God never go into a Rapture but it can so control the body and the mind it'll bring this body under subjection to him human beings can live in Victory with this body under subjection I tell you that's a supernatural Miracle that's a great thing but God's got the best part and Satan is left with the bodies Our Spirits our minds and so whatever he's left to work with he'll take that's if you let him take it can I get an amen amen it's what territory you let Satan have that he'll take you could give your mind wholly over to God and say I'm going to think on good things I'm going to think on positive things I just had a negative thought to me and so I'm going to change that right away by my own choice and I'm going to replace it with a good thought I just had something depress my spirit somebody said something or somebody didn't say anything but I feel depressed I know it's a depressing Spirit that's come around me but by choice I'm not going to let that do it I'm going to go over there and put some music on and in a matter of a few minutes of Holy Ghost fill music I'm going to draw myself out of that Spirit of depression and I'm going to be rejoicing the Lord because I have a choice of what I let Satan get involved in right and whatever you give him he'll take that's right you can be in depression all day long all week long all Christmas season long if you let Satan control it or you could have a good Christmas right and happy and thankful so I'm going to go back and read some things that I feel are worth repeating before I go into the subject of guilt a little bit I was going back in my notes and I read some things real quickly at the end because I didn't have much time left there's some good things here about conviction and I already talked about condemnation that's a final condemning there's no hope it's over and God doesn't dwell in that but he deals in conviction and you have to know the difference because somebody can be convicted by God and say I'm feeling condemned I'm feeling you're not being condemned by God but conviction of God is different and you want conviction of God you want you want that in your life you would never want a life without conviction amen so you got to know the difference so some people said some good things they said uh different writers and I collected some of the things what gives us conviction uh of sin is not the number of sins we have committed it is the sight of the Holiness of God Martin Jones said that and then goes on to say here's another writer Henry blackaby said when a holy God draws near in true in true Revival people come under terrible conviction of sin the outstanding feature of a spiritual awakening has been the profound consciousness of the presence and the Holiness of God you when you come into His presence of a holy God then all of a sudden your sin is exposed and that's a good thing that can bring a Revival cuz what happens is people don't just get convicted they repent another writer said conviction of sin is God's way I love these now conviction of sin is God's way of inviting you to restore fellowship with him because obviously you're away from him you're distant from him you feel convicted and you repent say God bring me back brings you back into restoration of relationship so conviction is a good thing that's not condemnation conviction is not repentance conviction leads to repentance but you can be convicted without repentance that's from Martin Jones another one from Martin Jones I think that's a good quote some other writers said conviction is more than the mere feeling and this is what I'll speak a little bit about tonight conviction is more than just the mere feeling of guilt for something we have done wrong it's normal to have to feel guilty after doing something that we know we shouldn't have done so so the tonight I'll talk a little bit about the feeling of guilt but we must distinguish the feeling of guilt over real guilt right if we did something wrong and we're convicted of God there there's going to be guilt that goes with that but then Satan dwells in the realm of a feeling of guilt and you not don't haven't necessarily did anything wrong but you got a feeling of guilt how many ever bet somebody in your life and they're professionals at making you feel guilty don't look at your husband or wife next to you please don't do that not in a service tell them when you get home but if it's not your husband or wife it's your children that make you that they make you feel guilty all the time or it's the parents to the children making their feel guilt their kids they never measure up you always making them feel guilty always talk about what they do wrong and never what they do right the feeling of guilt is not necessarily the conviction and the guilt that goes with conviction see why we got to talk about these things cuz what you might be feeling might be from the enemy and not from God right but you're just beating yourself all up and you're depressed and you're I wonder this and I wonder that and I wonder wonder wonder and you just become a wondering star because you're wondering all the time so we got to really talk about these things so conviction is more than a mere feeling of guilt for something we've done wrong it's normal to feel guilty after doing something that we know we shouldn't have done conviction go goes above and beyond having a feeling true conviction goes above and beyond having a feeling convict in the Greek is translated into eleno which means to convince someone of the truth to reprove to accuse in other words it's there's truth to it a feeling most of the time doesn't have truth to it but true conviction has a truth to it it's it's to convince someone of the truth truth so we see that conviction brings out the truth it accuses us of our wrongs and rebukes US of our sins as we have seen through the verses we have discussed conviction is good Brokenness is good it always draws us closer to God if you find yourself in deep conviction for something don't ignore it young people can learn this early in life if you find yourself in deep conviction about something and it's coming from God don't ever ignore that go to your prayer closet get right with God today today is the day of your reconciliation don't wait two weeks don't wait two years don't wait 20 years when you feel the conviction repent before God and reconcile with God our Lord wants to be with you he wants to manifest himself through you and he cannot do that if you're not right with him yes Brokenness is painful but it's necessary and it's beautiful thank God for conviction there is a clear difference between conviction and condemnation conviction comes from the Lord and it leads to life and joy condemnation however comes from Satan and it leads to despair that's right conviction is intended to lead us to the Lord but condemnation drives us away from the Lord so listen if you're feeling I'm I'm getting out out of here I'm going you know I'm I'm going to turn to things of the world I'm going to do this or whatever and and because I'm just feeling condemned that is not God driving you away that's Satan using it to drive you further away when conviction is involved God is doing it to draw you closer to him condemnation drives you away condemnation causes us to look at our Self Conviction causes us to look to Christ when someone is experiencing condemnation there's no solution to their problem you're just doomed you cross the line it's over you're done there's no hope for you some of Satan's voices with condemnation there's no solution to the problem but we know with Christ with everything there's a solution there's Grace can you say man there's an answer our Bible says that with every Temptation he will make a way of Escape for you every time true and so when someone is experiencing comination there's no solution when we're experiencing conviction it's meant to draw us to him to receive his love his grace his forgiveness in conviction there is hope because on the cross Jesus Christ died for all of our sins when we look to the Cross we find Freedom and hope in John 12:47 says for God did not send his son into the world to condemn the world but to save the world through him there's always salvation through God's conviction but there's always uh damnation and condemnation with Satan's condemnation if we just look at now we just want to go go into guilt a little bit tonight and just expose it guilt has the power to go beyond Beyond convicting the really truly guilty guilt can plague the innocent that's right so we have to recognize when Satan is using the thing of guilt and I don't even know necessarily what it is but we know it is something because we feel it and Satan knows that feeling and Satan with his voices gets in that feeling but the the the thing that can be way too powerful in Satan using it is the power of guilt can go beyond convicting the really guilty which it should but it also can plague the innocent so when you look closely at the Dynamics of today what's going on with the believer now you can see why there's not more visible Victory sometimes in Believers just ahead lies a greater place of Freedom just ahead lies a greater victory for them just ahead just through the sound barer just a just a cross just a little remember I was speaking a few weeks ago about your potentials sometimes somebody's full potentials are laying right there and they're just a step away from it and Satan's keeping them from greater potentials Satan's keeping you from a greater walk with the Lord because you're held back right there it's just it's just stunted right there and there's a greater place of freedom but sometimes there's a cloud of guilt that lays over a Believer that's right sometimes we bring it on ourselves sometimes other people bring it bring it on us and there are ways that we bring guilt on ourselves and other people can bring it we you know we sometimes and I'm just going to be real honest with you tonight sometimes we OV examine ourselves because we want to please God so much out of his desire that he put within us so now here's just a real dividing line here we're supposed to examine ourselves because the Bible says First Corinthians let a man examine himself it's before the Lord's Supper but every day let a man examine himself so I'm not knocking that but be careful how you're examining yourself and how you're measuring yourself do it with the word of God but don't do it by other people's measuring stick and don't do it by your own measuring stick because those of you who are real extreme legalistic and or or maybe OCD or whatever nature that you have that kind of especially you people you can set yourself in that expectations that you'll probably never measure up to and when you don't measure up that week or that day then what do you get that's right guilt amen but you know we got all this we got C we got this this you people that are OCD you better be listening is that the bad part of it great be organized get it all done but when you don't and a lot of times you don't true self-guilt guilt and you start measuring your character by it and then Satan comes in and says what a yeah I just feel like a loser this week and sat says yeah you feel like it but I really feel I I know you are a loser get all this stuff going on you're feeling guilt and he's he dwells in the realm of guilt so he jumps in and agrees with you yeah you you're really man who do you think you are you just can't ever measure up to stuff that you're supposed to get done guilt is a real thing that's in our lives that sometimes we bring on ourselves so I want to separate and say if God if you've done something wrong and God brings conviction about it make that right and bring it under the blood of Jesus Christ even God asking us to do that you know why it's to do it so that you don't live with days of guilt God does not want you living with any guilt you see so much guilt the devil uses that is not necessary there's a necessary guilt that comes with the conviction of sin but most of the other guilt is not necessary and even the true guilt and conviction is only temporary God wants you to be relieved of it when you truly sincerely bring it under the blood of Jesus Christ God forgive me I made a mistake I'm appealing to my great high priest who can be touched by the feeling of infirmities I'm leaving at your blood I mean it Lord and I mean it so much help me never to do that again that's a repentant heart and then he washes it away and the Bible says if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive our sins so that our guilt can be relieved here there's two sides to this guilt in the Webster's Dictionary there's two sides to this one side of guilt one meaning of guilt is a remorseful awareness that you have done something wrong a remorseful awareness that you've done something wrong so we have that and I'll let you know this guilt a remorseful awareness that you've done something wrong was so deeply ingrained in us when we were born condemnation by representation that's right before you did anything wrong you were born with condemnation so guilt came with our birth you start growing up and you just you already feel there's a there's a cloud you're born with condemnation you're born with guilt by by Nature you're born with the guilt of sin by Nature that serpent nature is tied to Satan and his condemned defeated state has been on us since we are cursed because we come under the curse and that's where it all started Satan felt like dirt and makes you feel like dirt because he was cast to the dirt maybe the reason you feel like dirt is because the one that was cursed to dirt right is talking to you every day we're born with that by representation it's called The Guilt of sin but I got to quote if you guys would bring it up the guilt of sin and we're guilty but Calvary came through with not only an atonement but a release from the guilt of sin how many can say Amen that Calvary came through not only with an atonement for our sin but a release from the guilt of sin can you say amen amen that's right Calvary not only paid for our sins but it released us from the guilt of sin thank you for
