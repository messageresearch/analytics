TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I'm having a bit of a technical difficulty here let's see [Music] I couldn't see that but I can't see that is [Music] some people can do this and talk at the same time and I'm not one of them I think we're good here very good God bless you maybe we can open our Bibles to the Book of Revelation chapter 3 as we're getting settled in here it's uh good to be back and we were gone for six weeks over the summer and it's been good be it was good to visit family away but it's always good to be back and uh and you're on the home church and then back with the uh back with the church ages appreciate everybody's uh making us feel welcome back here at home uh we'll just start off Revelation chapter through the message to the church in Sardis and um verse one unto the angel of the church in Sardis right these things Seth he that hath the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars I Know Thy Works he says that though has to name that though livest and are dead Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for I have not found thy works perfect before God remember therefore how thou Hast received and heard and hold fast and repent if therefore Thou shalt not watch I will come on be as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee thou asked a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in the white raiment and thy will not blot out his name out of The Book of Life thou will confess his name before my father before his angels let him hear what the spirit saith under the churches and this evening when they do a little bit of review from what we talked about in the beginning of June because that was a really long time ago and then one of the focus this evening perhaps on this phrase from verse 5 about he that overcometh I will not blot out his name out of The Book of Life we'll talk about uh The Book of Life and election Lord willing let's just pray though Heavenly Father we thank you for your goodness and your grace thank you for bringing us here this evening thank you for bringing us here this evening safely Lord we we want to acknowledge your hand in our lives father I just pray that you would bless the service this evening father both here and folks who might be streaming at home Lord just pray that you would help us to be better grounded in your word and a strong Foundation the Lord and Jesus Christ and we pray amen you may be seated so last time we talked about um how a lot of theologians and church historians look back at the Reformation of the 19th century and they call it the Glorious reformation and there were certainly uh some some glorious parts to it take it took a strong uh a strong anointing to be able to stand up against the Catholic system but um it's interesting is um when when the Holy Spirit is describing in Revelation chapter 3 that historical time period that is called The Glorious Reformation today there's a lot of criticism of it it's talking about they had to have just a few names among you um there's there's uh um you have a name that you live but are dead you're living your own name you're not living my name and there's there's a lot of criticism there and um the point that we kind of Drew from that is when we mistake the beginning of God's work for his completed work we might risk missing God's ultimate goal because we can look back and see the Reformation was certainly the time when the a standard was being raised against this uh this cycle of the Antichrist Spirit as it goes through the uh in the in the Ephesian age the Antichrist Spirit begins working in the church and gradually things get worse and Smyrna and pergamist and by attire and this evil is taking over the church as this Antichrist spirit is taking hold it took a lot to to counter that and God is really starting this restoration work he's just starting the work there and the sardisian church age but you can see it's just starting reversing the process of evil taking root in the church it's just starting this this work but when we go back and see oh this is what God has done here in in the sardisian age through Martin Luther and the Reformation this is what we're going to stay at that's the beginning point but we can't just hold over that we have to continue listening hearing what the spirits happen to the church is because it's in the process of that restoration you don't stop with just the L or the I you want to be made completely alive and that was kind of the uh that was the error with the Elders of Israel when they held strictly Only onto Moses that was where God started with the children of Israel but the purpose was to do a complete uh work and then where they would be filled with the fullness of God but they held just with the starting point and they weren't willing to continue on and that's the same thing that you can see happening with the reformation and the and the church ages following God's doing something and then they stop but God wants to continue and we don't want to just stop at the beginning the beginning is good but that's not everything those brother Brandon looks at this um the sardisian church age he sees there's such want and disregard for the Lord and his word that the that the con that the age in which Revelation 3 just rings with condemnation he says it wasn't the Glorious era that carnal-minded Protestant historians have tried to make it and even we listened to a voice from within the time period by Jana Amos khumanius and he said in short Christendom has become a labyrinth and he's writing at the end of the uh uh I think at the beginning of the seventh at the beginning of the 17th century 100 years after the 95 Theses are posted he's saying the faith has been split into a thousand little parts and you made a heretic if there's just one of them you don't accept what can help the only one thing needful is to return to Christ he's acknowledging that there are a lot of people who are living their own name but like Revelation says you have a name that you're living but you're dead he said we need to go back to Christ and make him the leader and and follow him exclusively so brother Branham says in the church age book the sardisian age was an unfulfilled age it was just the start of getting back and it starts a great thing you can't get anywhere if you don't start but you don't get to the destination if you don't keep on going so whether Brandon talks about how yes it started with the doctrine of justification which meant salvation is all of God Luther preached the sovereignty of God in the election but it was all wonderfully good but um it's still like God's telling Luther you're going to start things but your age will see it still unfulfilled I'm leaving that until later so the lesson that we have to take there is we have to continue hearing with the spirits Athens of the churches continue following God as he reveals himself like Jesus told his disciples if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed it's not just sitting there for the first lesson and getting your sticker that yes I made it to the first day of school first day of school is great but you have to continue in his word and then you'll know the truth and the truth shall make you free so that was a in a nutshell what we talked about in uh in June but this evening I want to look about look at this the The Book of Life and the role of election in it because it's coming up here in Revelation 3 5 a that he had overcometh I won't blot out his name out of the book of life and brother Brandon commented even the possibility of a name being removed from the records of God deserves more than a casual study and he says a lot of people have drawn wrong conclusions they think that God placed the names people born again in the Lamb's Book of Life at the time of their rebirth and he says this is a 100 opposite to what the word actually teaches and he says at the start of our study he says there's not one scripture that teaches that God is presently compiling a record of names and I can remember when I was in elementary I in junior high I I took piano lessons because I think I was fulfilling my mother's unfulfilled dreams I think she wanted to be a Pianist so um her son's got to fulfill some of that and I thank you mother because it did fulfill some self-discipline but I've been told I didn't get the music gift my brother did so we just get so discipline takes you so far I remember one evening I was just kind of playing in the piano this uh I only played these like one three five chords and there was this song There was a new name written down in glory it was just a fun song to play in this head nice nice beat I really enjoyed it and I was and then somebody made the comments you know rap there's not any new names written down in glory it's like oh man you took my song away from that I was really enjoying playing the song but um you think about it um when we talk about a new name being written down in glory and yes we're told Jesus says Rejoice at your names are written in heaven so we can Rejoice their names written in heaven but we don't Rejoice their name is just now written in heaven because if it's just now written in heaven it's because of something we did because as soon as I come up to the altar or this happened to me oh now my name's finally written in heaven because I did something right and yes we have to respond there's that but we can't respond unless God pulls first and without that first pull we get nowhere so we Rejoice our names written in heaven but when we say our name is there's a new name written down in glory it implies I just did something to get my name there and that's not accurate now when we think about um the idea of election here because that's going to be a part of our our subject this evening because um yeah um election as to the idea of choosing somebody's in somebody's out and we can get this idea of this phys Ed lineup how many remember going into gym class and everybody standing at the end line and two team leaders are there I think you're on this side you're on that side you're on this side you're on that side and you're dying a thousand deaths every time that your name's not called because it's a test when if you're lack of athletic ability your lack of popularity your lack of whatever and you think this the smacks of what they're like if this is what elections like that's terrible because that's not how God should be um but that's not what elections like that's not how how names get put on the book because oh you're better you're not so good we'll save you to later election isn't a matter of either God saying oh I pick you I don't pick you I don't pick you the devil can have you it's not that and it's not the matter of us the first day of school we don't know people we're going to sign up to be on this guy's team and we just happen to pick the right person it's not that brother Branham says that it doesn't have to do with um and simply involving ourselves with a certain group of people in order to receive eternal life it doesn't have to do that that's not what it implies we'll talk more about this at the end election isn't a matter of somebody making a choice here or there you're in you're out it has to do with identity and that's what we're going to come come down to we're going to talk for a few minutes about the idea of a new name being written down in glory and this isn't to take away any favorite song or anything like that but it just so that we can be uh founded on yeah why is a name written in heaven it's not because of something we did it might be because something we've recognized but it's not something we did light strikes oh that's who I am I didn't know that has its identity not performance John 15 16 says you haven't chosen me but I've chosen you and when did this Choice take place it's not after you showed how fast you could run 100 meter dash how well you could sing how well you could didn't have anything to do with that God committed his love toward us and that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us well we were absolutely unable to commend ourselves to God for anything God chose us then he chose us yeah at our worst we can say that's what's being implied here at Romans 5 8. when did this Choice take place according Ephesians chapter 1 according as he hath chosen Us in him when before the foundation of the world that we should be holy Without Blame before him and love predestinate us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace where he made it accepted in the Beloved when before we've done anything it took place already there and Romans chapter 9 explains this principle of election really really well Paul is speaking about Jacob and Esau they said the children weren't even born yet they hadn't done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand it wasn't because of anything either one of them either one of those boys had done it was just God's Choice it was God there was a seed of God and one of them there wasn't in the other one and that's just how it was it wasn't because of a work that any one of them had had done it wasn't because Jacob was better brother Branham goes out of his way to say Esau was actually the better guy he took care of his dad better it would have been a wiser better choice but that's just how that's where the seed was sown and Jacob and in Revelation 17 8 whose names were written in the Book of Life when from the foundation of the world and this just to me this can give me rest and it's not because I did a particular thing to get my name in the book this evening no it's just God did the work um established it before the foundation of the world and at some point the light strikes I realized oh that's who I am brother Branham tells the test of the the story about the eagle got caught in the chicken's nest and it wasn't because the eagle did anything in particular it's just what it was so the elect when when Mama Eagle calls out it's not that she's rejecting the chickens it's not because the because the chickens are bad Eagles it's just because they're they're they're they're they're the chickens they can't respond there's nothing in them to respond when that uh when when that little Eagle hears mother is called all that that is something he'd never heard before and there was something to answer back because that's what he was he didn't do anything to make himself that that's just what he was so when we look at the uh when we look at the Book of Life um it's uh you really can't get out of uh talking about categories and um we'll talk uh talk a little bit uh brother Brandon refers to a couple things and different ways of categorizing look at that in a minute when we consider the Book of Life we're confronted though with the true with the fact that truth is exclusive when the trial when when the court case comes up and the defendants there is being arraigned he's being tried and finally the the verdict comes down it's going to be guilty or innocent it's going to be one or the other it's not going to be somewhere in the middle there's only two possible um two possible categories for the defendant these either be innocent or guilty name in this case in the Book of Life or or out of The Book of Life so um we'll talk this evening more about the categories names in and names out we'll keep it at those those and those two basic categories later we'll look at names in The Book of Life and who and who receives um eternal life will go further in there but tonight we just look at names not in the book and names in the book brother Brandon says on page 296 of the church age book will show by scripture one that there are multitudes who are not even born again who will go into eternal life does that sound strange but it's true they will talk about that in another service we'll also show there's a group of people whose names have it in place on the record before the foundation of the world cannot under any circumstances have those names removed we'll talk about that some this evening and then they'll also show that another group whose names were on that record before the foundation of the world but they will have their names removed we'll talk about that another time so we'll talk about category two and then this fourth category of achievement ads on page 316 he says fourth and finally are those names who have never been or will ever be written on the books never there there is no record of them at all and we can we can see that there are some individuals there is absolutely no record of them at all on the Book of Life never has been never will be and Revelation 13 8 talks about that there are those who dwell upon the Earth the Lord worshiping the Beast whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the Lamb so we're going to talk up just for a few minutes looking at how the scripture does best it's not that we want somebody not to have the name on the book that's it that have anything to do with our desire we're just looking at that's what the Bible says it doesn't mean to do with what I want and now you're not on the book of life you're you're a serpency no we we're just looking what the Bible says and then we'll go we'll go from there it's not for us to uh to pick and choose what truth is it's just this is what the Bible says and to accept it first Peter 2 talks about unto you therefore which believe he's precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders rejected the stone which the builders disallowed the same is made the head of the corner so there are people who are disobedient they reject Christ but he's still going to be made the head of the corner but to them he'll be a stone of stumbling Iraq of offense even to them would stumble up the word being disobedient where and to also they were appointed the scripture is going to talk about some in first Thessalonians 5 9 God hath not appointed us to wrath but others are appointed to wrath their their names not in the book of life not appointed uh to Glory they're appointed to uh to wrath and to judgment and that that can be hard it's easy to uh that's a hard saying of the disciples uh people told Jesus that's a hard saying who can hear it but it's what the Bible says we'll talk more about that and uh Romans 9 Paul writes has the Potter power over the clay he does he can make one lump to honor another vessel to dishonor he has that he has that right and what if God willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endured with much long-suffering the vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction there are he said there are some who are fitted to destruction that's that's just what they're here for there's there's nothing that they're not called to anything higher than that and that is a hard saying but Paul answers this and there can be charges of Injustice to God why can you do that God how can you do that to point somebody to wrath and Paul says yeah the Potter has power over the clay God is he's he's Sovereign and um it can be hard for us to accept that but God can have a purpose for something that we can't understand and if that if that's true then it can also be declared to be good in some way that we might not be able to understand it but God is sovereign now thinking about it more um it can be difficult to accept that some are actually appointed to distraction in your record of life at all yet there is a fact in the Bible that there are two seed lines stretching out through time which can also explain why God keeps track of his children in the book of life but he doesn't keep track of somebody else's children in the book of life is like they've got a lot of families might have a genealogist I know one of our fellow teachers at school is a genealogist she knows where her family came from all the way back and I said but Mrs Bish do you know where my family came from am I in your family genealogy said no no I'm not going to say to her that's so hateful you're you're not you're not keeping me in your book of life I mean that's that that's not right but she keeps track of her her children she can check her for her family she's not going to keep track of my family I accept that and it's the same way there's a there is a life on Earth that came about in Rebellion against God that God's not keeping track of those kids the way he's keeping track of his kids and Matthew 13 38 says the field is the world the good seed are the children of the Kingdom there are children of the Kingdom that God's going to keep very good track of but there are also tears and they're the children of the wicked one and there's a book of life for God's children he keeps track of that he's going to make sure they're they uh they're they're they're appointed to life Everlasting but the others he's not going to keep track of him because they came about outside of his outside of his perfect will and that's that almost makes sense he keeps track of his own children First John 3 10. in this that there are children of God and that's the children of God are manifest and also the children of the devil whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God neither he that loveth not his brother so you again see these these two groups these these these two families and there's a book of life where God keeps a record of of of of of of his children but he doesn't keep a record doesn't keep the he doesn't keep track of who all the devil's kids are um there's not a book he doesn't have a book of life for that because that's not those aren't his kids you could say um Ephesians 5 speaks about a little differently he talked God Paul speaks about children of Disobedience let no man deceive You by vain words for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of Disobedience so God keeps track of his children exclusively and people who might be and anything has to do with God's children he keeps track of him and make sure there's a there's a reward for them but he doesn't keep track of things that don't have to do with people with with his children and again that might seem like man God is really I thought God was gracious God is still gracious even though there's not a book set aside where he keeps track of those who aren't his children because even the children of disobedience it can enjoy and do enjoy the grace of God in this life it's not like that all those uh that all the serpents running around God is making it rain every day and you're throwing he's throwing lightning putting thunderstorms that's what the Greek gods did that's what the pagan gods did but the the true God doesn't do that he's not he's not trying to execute Vengeance because of what what uh what happened in the garden I'm going to make sure every one of those Devil's kids are going to get have a terrible day every single day of the week he doesn't do that he actually he makes the son rides on the evil and the good he sends right on the just and the unjust so even even people who might not have their name in The Book of Life God still shows grace and mercy to them even to the extent that in Psalm 73 asaph gets jealous because he says I was envious at the foolish when I saw the prosperity of the wicked why didn't I win the lottery some unbeliever won the laundry how can that be and they've got the BMW I've got the night I've got this another car why is that people can actually have a good life depending on the decisions they make I mean they can make bad decisions but you know what unbelievers can also make wise decisions and they can enjoy the grace of God in this life so even though somebody's name might not be on the book of life doesn't mean that God's not being gracious to them there might not be anything in them to respond to God but they might still live a life according to many of God's principles and enjoy the grace of God in this life so there's a lot more grace out there I mean the grace of God is it's abundant Beyond but we can fathom so even in this life the children of Disobedience do enjoy the grace of God I mean think about our kids I mean they can be disobedient sometimes but they might still enjoy free Wi-Fi at home free food all these things and they can be disobedient kids but we're the grace and love of parents is abundant even for our kids who are disobedient and that's just the love of God and even in judgment we can say that God is a righteous judge he doesn't spend um the time time here on Earth executing vengeance upon the children of Disobedience he's not doing he's not sending Thunderbolts every single day and even at the end when they're when there's coming of judgments he's not sending them to Eternity where they're being tortured that's not the point of Hell the point of hell is just to destroy that which isn't uh according to God's perfect plan and hell wasn't uh hell was created for the devil and his demons it wasn't created for the humans here on Earth who might have followed that they they'll they they they will they will be destroyed in hell but it wasn't it wasn't for that purpose and hell is going to be a finite time the scriptures here on this here on the notes um the enemies of the Cross of Christ Philippians 3 19 says whose end is destruction not Everlasting torture with bamboo sticks being stuck at their fingernails and all kinds of this going on for Infinity um Matthew 10 28 says we should fear Him who's able to destroy both soul and body and Hell the point is Annihilation and not just Everlasting pain and Luke 12 talks about punishment will be proportionate um somebody who there's a servant who knew his Lord's will but didn't prepare himself to do it and didn't do a quarter into his Lord's will he will be beaten with many stripes because he knew better but there'll be another servant who didn't know his Lord's will but did commit things against those Lords but he didn't know it and he'll be beaten with few stripes so God is still a righteous and just even in judgment the one to go back to the idea how we're back to that lineup at uh and class and I was kind of going through this last night with my wife just kind of making sure things were clear and she had the audacity said man that tall kid in the middle of those goggles he looks like you thank you sweetheart thank you sweetheart but fortunately God's election isn't like this the election isn't a matter of either God or us picking and choosing because my wife probably wouldn't have picked me if I'd look no sure her love is uh her love is great but election isn't a matter of picking and choosing that we associate it with that it's a matter of identity and this is from the message of Jehovah Jireh brother Branham speaks about Abraham or Abraham in the Bible represents the election Isaac justification Jacob Grace Joseph perfection and he says but on this election God chose Abraham not because he was an educated man not because he was a smart man but because God saw something in Abraham before the foundation of the world and later on in his ministry brother Bramwell talks about will show why God saw that there God put it there his seed was sown there but here he's saying God saw something in them before the foundation of the world since that's the reason that you're a Christian tonight because God saw something in you before the foundation of the world and put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life before the world was ever formed and he says the biggest fault I can find with any of the churches and especially and especially the real church that's born again as they don't know who they are so here it's not based upon what we're doing or choosing or gotcha it's based upon who we are election is a matter of identity and identity is based upon seed who's your dad and he says they don't know who they are you don't realize what their privilege God's given you you're looking for something way off on some kind of a millennium but the devil's pulled one over on you now we are the sons of God election's a question of identity and I've heard about people who can take these uh DNA tests and you'll see where your family came from everything and depending on the test you you had I've never taken one but you can find all kinds of family you didn't realize you had and so people will start making phone calls and meet up with these long-lost brothers and you hear the stories of wow we enjoy the same kind of food like the same kinds of books it's like we're family and why is that the case is because of who they are it's not because they're all of a sudden copying each other and and and and and Performing like each other that they'd say oh we're so alike no it's because it's in their DNA that that that's who they are and it's kind of like how it is in this book of life that I mean God's God's God's DNA is all over the world and he's there to bring the help them help to his children to realize hey I'm your dad that's what it's all about to say Ah that's who I really am I thought I was in I thought I was part of a different family and I always try I never felt comfortable in that family before but now I know who my real dad is and now it solves everything I I understand things so much better because I know who my real dad is that's election is a matter of who you are identity and the the sermon communion brother Baptist now we want to go back and think Paul is referring to an Old Testament character in The Book of Genesis we take the life of Abraham from the 12th chapter of Genesis Genesis God giving Abraham the promise and through Abraham would come the righteous see and Abraham believed by many to be a Jew he wasn't Abram was a gentile a Chaldean from the city of Earth and he became God's servant not because he was different from anyone else but because of the election of God it wasn't because Abram was super educated super respectful is just because of the election of God there was there was something in him there wasn't any in any of his human characteristics there was a a seed of God that was in him that he didn't deserve it was just there and we don't deserve any of it it's it's it's it's not of him who Wills or runs it's God who shows Mercy and brother Brandon extends that principle to us Paul does this Paul Paul does it he said we are the children of Abram the same way that God dealt with Abraham or children of Abram God deals with us the same way we're not saved because we're a good person so we can't say I'll go ahead and come to the Lord once I once I've overcome certain things in my life or I'll get baptized once I've overcome this or that and yeah I can feel the pull of God but I'll respond to it once I'm good enough for it I don't want to disappoint God loves us when we're Sinners he's drawing on this sin we come as we are not as we want to be we come as we are and God make sure we leave different than we were he transformed us into his creatures and something and and some things will just change immediately other things might take time some things just be right away just like a meat cleaver one day I was struggling with this the next day it was gone but there can be other things that just kind of hang on there you just kind of have to battle and battle and battle and in the Old Testament when um the children of Israel go into the promised land God tells Moses I'm not going to drive everybody out from you right away because then you won't have the strength to keep the land yourself there's going to be something that will be a consistent there'll be a battle you're going to have to continue driving these Giants out driving the Giants out driving the Giants out that's how it was with the Israelites possessing their Promised Land what's our Promised Land it's this vessel it's a we want to make this our flesh be conformed to God's will the soul God's life and the Soul should be controlling our our carnal spirit and when that happens then the flesh can is is falling as objection as well but when the soul takes the day off goes on vacation that carnal spirit is going to take the lead he's going to lead our flesh all kinds of different ways but we gotta in the the inner man's gonna have hey we're going to do something different we're going to please God we're going to possess the land that's how it takes but it's some things will change right away some things won't that doesn't mean God didn't work with you it just means just like the children of Israel God's leaving some Giants for you to grow up gain more muscles and battle later on in your life and they'll give you the strength to to to defeat those just like he helped you defeat the other ones let's see here and then the message Abraham's Grace Covenant it says remember the promise is altogether Grace and no law mixed in it at all there's no ifs at all if you do this I'll do that that's how we often deal with one another honey if you wash the dishes I'll do this for you that's how we deal a lot of times but that's not how God deals it was an unconditional Covenant that God made with Abraham not any ifs or absolutely God's choosing of Abram it's not what you've done what your desires are it wasn't Abraham's desire he was a heathen God just came out of the blue and full on his heart it wasn't because he was searching after God first you know what we can't see God coming out of heaven and certain to pull on us but if we feel a desire for God it can only be because God pulled on our hearts first there's no other way around because that's not a natural desire God starts it and that we can respond to it wasn't Abraham's desire he was a heathen he come down from the Tower of Babel and the Valley of the Shiner and the lady of the Chaldeans the city of her he was just an ordinary man nothing Abraham did not even his desires but God by grace and election chose Abraham and that's the way he chose you it's nothing he did to get her name written down in glory this evening it's what he did before the foundation of the world before he'd ever done anything good or bad that's how God dealt with Abraham and also to Abraham's seed then the quote continues on the bottom of page five he says do you think you've become a minister or Christian because people talk good about you join the church or stay in society you're just fooling yourself that's all you're a miserable person when it comes to Christianity that's what the prophet Isaiah says all of our righteousnesses are as filthy rags the best effort that we can put forth to please God I did this in the Sunday School a long time ago like the week before Sunday school class I took a rag and I dug a hole in the backyard and I put that rag in the dirt and then next week I come back I on Sunday morning I dig the dig the rag out and I says this are our this is the best we are on a good day and I use this rag to clean this dish I'm just going to make it worse that's how our righteousness is to God we uh it's not because we're a miserable person when it comes to Christianity God chooses by election and we can rest in that it's not because of when we came to the altar at a certain time that we're finally God said yeah you finally did it I'm going to give it to you now we do have to respond when God's and God's calling there is a response my wife is sharing the example that she heard one time it's kind of like when someone is out testifying they might have a a board on the front that they're wearing and says whosoever will let them come and that's that's what's being projected out but on the other side of the board is whom I knew before the foundation of the world there's one side both sides are true but if we just sit back and say huh if I'm Pro destinated I don't do any Mission work because if they're predestinian they'll come anyway no we have to preach whosoever we'll let him come because that's true God's atonement is powerful effective for anybody who comes and then we rest I rest not in in how good I can preach how good I can spread seed because that sower who spread this he was a terrible sower but he's just resting that this seed if it gets to the right spot it's going to bring something forth not because of what I do almost in spite of what I do but I'm doing it and God's going to bring forth increase because there's there's principles that are going to be working and I can just rest in that so it goes back again to um identity so that sower Goes Forth to so he when he uh when he goes and Associates uh plants his garden plant in the garden doesn't start in the month of March it starts months before when uh when sister I was over at the semicolas two weeks ago and saw sister Tiffany's flower garden like it just stretches goes and goes and goes and she doesn't just go out one day I'm going to plant this year no she's me I want I want this in my garden I want this in my garden I want this in my garden and she's Gathering these seeds she's already got a vision she's seeing the result before the seeds ever even planted and that's how it is with God when brother Brahm speaks about how they uh they're in God's mind for the foundation of the world he's already thinking of his children and God's thoughts he says they're literal we can't fathom that he's already thinking of it and and there's already a life there it's kind of like the best I can think about it is when like when Elise was expecting job and or Lynn or Sophie and you're sitting there on the couch together the house is quiet and and you can feel the baby move around the tummy you can already in your mind you can already hear that pitter patter feet running through the hallways you're already the child's not born yet but for you you already loved each other but the child is in anything you're already and that's how that's how it is a sower Goes Forth to sew you're already God already knows these these seed he already knows his children sister Tiffany loves these flowers for they ever hit the ground and so she goes forth to sew and she's she's chosen these she's elected these to be in her garden however an enemy comes long afterward and so is something else no Mr Tiffany didn't make a list of all the weeds that would be coming up in the garden because that wasn't part of her her plan they those were in her thoughts that wasn't what she was sowing election is yeah it doesn't she's not going along and saying yeah I'm going to this corn I'm going to say it's a corn because all these attributes it's a beautiful beautiful kernels and uh everything is great I'm going to say this is a good corn and this dandelion here this is a bad corn because no it's it's not because of the performance of the plant because of what the plant is and that's where the election goes back to what that seed is it's a corn plant not because of how good it grew but because of the seed that it was that's the only way it can be so election isn't a matter of either God or us picking and choosing it's a matter of identity what that seed is it's not that that corn plant could be a bad corn plant but it's still a corn plant and you can be a because I'm a terrible Christian but if you're following God you're still a Christian and that's the most important thing you can say I I fell today but I a Christian Falls forward because Lord forgive me I'm sorry God then you could get right back up and you're still a Christian you don't all of a sudden become become a dandelion you're still that wheat plant because that's the seed that's there and that doesn't change and the brother Brandon says now then we're coming to a conclusion and I can say the same thing we're getting ready to come to a conclusion here as the Eternal logos God was manifest in the Sun so the thoughts of God and the beginning before Before Time began and the foundation of the world God's alone with his thoughts and then Proverbs chapter 8 which describes the spirit of wisdom and and and it talks you were I was there before the world was for anything was brought forth I said as being the logos there and they talked about and then we were God delighted me as as a father and a child God was there and that logos hasn't become flesh as the son but that God's still rejoicing it as in his thought as though we're already there just like the parents sitting on the couch dreaming of the pitter-patter of the feet going through the house and didn't realize that might be Peter pader at two o'clock at night like it was last night in our house which wasn't as enjoyable but it doesn't change the fact that I love my daughter even though she woke us up that's how it is with with God as well but that logos was manifest over time in the Sun and that's how it is with us as well we were in God's thoughts at the beginning and gradually in time that thought comes to a place where it starts taking on flesh and our great grandfather or grandfather then finally Our Father then finally we come to Earth and there's something in that little baby that's going to bring forth later because there's a thought of God there not because the baby was so good and slept well off of the night that God says that's going to be a good boy and put my thought in him and deposit it that's not at all it was there already before the beginning so even so we Eternal in his thoughts and our turn we became the many membered spoken word seed manifest in flesh and those Eternal thoughts now manifest In the Flesh are the sons of God even as we are so called we did not become by the rebirth we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn that corn seed that planted there in the garden it doesn't become corn supernaturally because it's done so well it can only become corn because it what it's always been and that's what was willed I I plant that there it's going to come forth and that is my will of my desire that is what election is that's what it is it's what it's going to become because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened and non-seed there's nothing to Quicken but again in the non God didn't sow those and they will still enjoy the Sun the rain good things in this life so they'll still enjoy the grace of God but again when it comes time for Harvest the dandelion is going to be pulled out they'll have a different uh a different uh future and then the seed's going to be harvested and put in taken home and eating it'll be it'll be it'll be a different future but it's not because the dandelion was a bad dance it was a good dandelion just wasn't a corn seed and they and and it's the identity that established the different destinations for them and brother Branham says again later he says be careful here and see this it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God it's the word or seed so it's not again it's not this this lineup in gym class whether Tom it's a great volleyball player I want him on my team that's true that's true but that's not how God chooses God chooses some terrible volleyball players if you've seen people at Camp they could be God's children be terrible volleyball players but God doesn't choose baseball performance he chooses based upon the seed that's in them so again this is the wrong picture it gives us an entirely wrong picture of the grace of God and what the election is election is this this is the thought that God has for his garden before the foundation of the world we it's the word it's the seed not the personal attributes the personality the characteristics that's more or less irritating or more or less Pleasant to be around that has nothing to do with God's election Believers can be very irritating and annoying they can be very pleasant has nothing to do with those personality traits it's what's within them brother Branham talks about um this uh and think in the message things are to be talks about God's a Ganda variety there can be he loves big mountains he loves Hills he loves this kind of flower he loves this and that variety and he created us in a variety he talks about Peter and Paul they're both predestinated seat of God and they could Clash that the the people rub you the wrong way has nothing to do with whether or not there's a seed of God in you there's just we're creating a variety and sometimes God puts that variety together like he often does in marriages to bring out um different things in us but um we can just relax it it's it's the seed in us it's not the personality traits anything that makes a seed so we Rejoice because our names are written in heaven not because of anything we did or didn't do it just this is the soil that happened to have God's word sown in it and it's made my heart be good ground and yeah the devil is going to try to get weeds as close as possible and Lord how we be sensitive when the when the weeder comes along on a Sunday or a Wednesday and starts pulling on these different weeds that has to be done too because the good soil has to be maintained it's a good soil is not uh that's a lot of work I remember when we moved to uh to to Ohio I mean and and and the Netherlands it's rich soil I mean you just it's just it was really easy when my wife started getting the gar trying to plant things around their house and Lima it was all clay and she broke a couple Spades just trying to to get the dirt dug up and just out this is it was different kind of dirt but it takes time to start putting fertilizer and they're putting the nutrients in there that's like with our hearts I'm going to put the nutrients of God's spirit in there the nutrients of this word in there more water in there and we can see hey there could be times when we let our hearts get hard and yeah there might be a good seed in there we want to make it as easy as possible for that seed to take root and bring forth so here in the um here in the sardisian church age Christ speaks about the Overcomer can Rejoice because their names are written in heaven he had overcometh his name will not be blotted out from the book of life and it's because of election that that is the case an election is anything that we've done it's what God established before the foundation of the world and Lord willing um next time we'll take a look more at names that are in the book of life that perhaps have gotten removed at some point and we'll see why that could be the case because the Bible talks about that and I uh um I think of the quote of that William Booth has he said as you looked forward in the 20th century the greatest challenge will be Christianity without Christ talk about forgiveness about repentance and all these things and you when you when you see that that he had he was spot on and not everybody that names the name of Christ might actually have his name they might be in their own name but but still calling that uh his name and then you can see yeah there does have to be uh um a weeding a categorizing and we're not the ones who do that God does that but Lord willing we'll take a look at that next time and we can pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your goodness and your grace to us Lord father I thank you that we can rest and uh and your calling Lord that uh and and your predestination Lord and that you who started the work will complete the work of God that we can rest in the work that you did Lord are just so encouraging seeing that it's nothing that Abraham did that's all of what you did in Him Father Lord I pray that you would help us to give ourselves over to you and and Lord just to just to acknowledge your your work and our lives and and surrender and respond father I pray that you'd help us to care for the soil and our hearts of God that no other seed try to take root in there Lord father I just pray that we would uh would bring forth good fruit o God and much fruit Lord then take some fruiting sometimes prunist that we might bring forth more and much food oh God Lord we love you I pray that you would establish us um and found us in your word father have your way in us oh God name of the Lord Jesus Christ hey
