[4:14] and joy
[4:19] of be patient therefore Brethren unto
[4:23] the coming of the Lord behold the
[4:26] husbandman waited for the precious fruit
[4:28] of the Earth the husbandman is the
[4:31] farmer the farmer waiteth for the
[4:34] precious fruit of the earth and hath
[4:36] long patience for it until he reive the
[4:40] early and latter Reign be ye also
[4:44] patient establish your hearts for the
[4:48] coming of the Lord draweth nigh amen
[4:53] Matthew 13 and: 37 and he answered and
[4:57] said unto them he he that Seth The Good
[5:01] Seed is the son of man I'm going to read
[5:04] that again verse 37 and he answered and
[5:07] said unto them he that sth the good seed
[5:11] is the son of man I think it's an
[5:14] appropriate scripture and appropriate
[5:16] thing to apply to mothers and that is
[5:20] that he that Seth to the spirit because
[5:22] basically that's really what moms do is
[5:25] they're in the sewing years and they
[5:27] have the ability uh to so many many good
[5:31] things into the child can you say Amen
[5:34] she truly is that she's a swer mom and
[5:38] God must have trusted her uh to set her
[5:42] in life because he God set this up God
[5:44] created human beings he created the
[5:46] family and created how many years and
[5:49] all those things and then he set up
[5:51] mothers and fathers and so in his plan
[5:54] for some reason God set it up that the
[5:56] mom would have the child in its first
[5:59] formative years in other words mom would
[6:02] have the baby and the child first before
[6:05] anybody else I think God's mind was for
[6:08] that God was thinking and he must have
[6:10] trusted that if it was uh the right kind
[6:12] of mom that the best person that could
[6:15] be with that child in its most formable
[6:17] years is the mom right there close to
[6:20] them to the to embrace them to teach
[6:22] them to live something in front of them
[6:25] but also to speak to them and most words
[6:28] that are spoken
[6:30] uh the in the early years of our life
[6:32] are spoken by the mom and how many know
[6:34] that words have a powerful effect on us
[6:37] how many know that words are so powerful
[6:39] that you can remember something that was
[6:41] said about you even from your childhood
[6:44] you can remember what was said about you
[6:46] and those words can have still today a
[6:49] powerful effect upon your life how many
[6:51] would raise your hand and say my mother
[6:52] had a powerful effect upon my life and
[6:55] God set it up that way and it was mostly
[6:57] not just her actions but the word words
[6:59] that were because you see words are
[7:02] seeds words are something that you plant
[7:04] can you say amen and and so you could
[7:07] live the life in front of them but it's
[7:09] getting across something to that child
[7:12] to that baby and then they as they come
[7:14] in as toddlers mom is the one that's
[7:16] with him the most and and those words
[7:18] are seeds being sown and when seeds are
[7:22] sown then later you look and see what
[7:25] results come from the seeds that are
[7:27] sown because the law of harvest and the
[7:29] law of planting it it applies to
[7:32] everything in our lives and that is
[7:34] whatever is sown there's going to be a
[7:36] harvest from what's being sown you just
[7:38] don't get to see it till many years
[7:40] later but I can tell you whatever is
[7:42] sown there will be a harvest from that
[7:46] in our lives the principle works and
[7:48] especially with words that are spoken
[7:51] over us and moms do this uh uh uh in the
[7:54] early years of Our Lives those words
[7:57] from her lips will such great power over
[8:00] our lives and that spoken word from mom
[8:04] is kind of the uh Original Seed the
[8:07] spoken word is the Original Seed and
[8:09] those spoken words from mom is kind of
[8:12] the original seed for our lives on Earth
[8:16] can you say Amen building who we are
[8:19] your hair is so shiny and pretty today
[8:22] you have such nice handwriting of course
[8:25] my mom never said that about my
[8:28] handwriting you're brave to go out there
[8:31] and and and and play basketball I think
[8:33] you are kind I'm proud of you for trying
[8:37] harder in school I'm glad you're my
[8:39] daughter I'm glad you're my son I'm
[8:42] proud of you I love your dimples they're
[8:45] just so
[8:46] cute these is practical things that are
[8:49] words that are spoken but guess what
[8:51] she's the first one that says those
[8:52] things and hopefully she's a mom that
[8:54] doesn't always point out to all the
[8:57] flaws in US you have to do correction or
[9:00] you're not a good mom
[9:03] either you have to get a hold of that
[9:05] will or that will will get a hold of
[9:08] you so you have to kind of uh just break
[9:11] it a little bit but if all that is there
[9:13] without some words about the good can
[9:16] you say Amen then then it's going to be
[9:19] detrimental so this is the kind of I'm
[9:21] just giving simple examples of things
[9:23] that are said that can have a lifelong
[9:25] effect upon us and uh and mothers say
[9:28] that mothers say these things things and
[9:30] uh they give us things in those early
[9:32] years and we may not remember everything
[9:34] although some things you can remember we
[9:36] may not remember everything but there's
[9:39] something in us that gets embedded in US
[9:41] embedded in our minds and we can go back
[9:43] to something that was said over us
[9:46] personally now Mom can compliment other
[9:48] things mom can compliment dad mom can
[9:51] speak of other things that she enjoys
[9:53] but when she brings a direct a direct
[9:56] compliment to you and your personality
[9:59] and God made you and that you're
[10:01] fearfully and one and I love you the way
[10:03] that you are that's a direct personal
[10:06] thing to us and let me say friends if
[10:08] that has a much that much effect upon us
[10:11] a mother's word spoken to us how much
[10:14] does the word of God have power over us
[10:17] and what he says about us how much the
[10:20] more what he says is true and will have
[10:22] an effect on our spiritual life can you
[10:25] say
[10:26] Amen so having moms with their
[10:29] uh with their babies of course is the
[10:31] best thing and today we praise that and
[10:33] we praise a man who's able to keep her
[10:36] home uh that's where she should be is at
[10:38] home with the kids if you can if you can
[10:40] accomplish that so we we are thankful
[10:42] for that because that's best for the kid
[10:44] and it's such a powerful impact uh can I
[10:47] say if a mom can I say it again if a mom
[10:50] can have that by her words and life how
[10:53] much more can God's word affect us for
[10:56] our lives Jesus said my word
[10:59] that I speak unto you they are spirit
[11:02] and they are alive my word will have an
[11:05] effect on you the most powerful thing is
[11:07] when uh he speaks something over our
[11:10] lives the most powerful thing is when
[11:12] God speaks and he's spoken many things
[11:15] but when he speaks personally over our
[11:18] lives can you say Amen it's such a
[11:20] powerful thing everything changed in
[11:23] Abraham's life when God spoke his word
[11:26] for Abraham and guess what when God
[11:29] called Abraham and spoke to him it was a
[11:31] personal word for
[11:33] Abraham and it changed his complete
[11:37] life he was an idolator he had a certain
[11:40] identity and probably would have been an
[11:42] idolator the rest of his life until God
[11:46] came and spoke to him and said no you're
[11:50] you're not you're not an idolator L
[11:53] notice God saying a different identity
[11:55] you're not Idol because God's going to
[11:57] be speaking from the Lamb's Book of Life
[11:59] can I get an amen here this morning God
[12:01] will be speaking not from the identity
[12:03] you know but God will be speaking from
[12:06] the Lamb's Book of Life and he said to
[12:07] Abraham you're not an idolator I'm going
[12:10] to make you he said who are you he said
[12:13] well I'm baren my wife can't have a
[12:15] child I can't have a child I'm Abraham
[12:18] that's my that's my name that's my
[12:20] identity I'm Barren and I'm also an
[12:22] idolator and God says no I'm going to
[12:25] change your name from Abraham Abram to
[12:28] Abraham and no longer a Barren uh
[12:31] idolator but you're going to be guess
[12:33] what look at this I'll make a Barren
[12:36] person the father of many
[12:39] nations when God speaks over your life
[12:44] it changes everything Isaiah 558 for my
[12:47] thoughts are not your thoughts neither
[12:49] are your ways my ways sayith the Lord
[12:51] for as the heavens are higher than the
[12:53] earth so are my ways higher than your
[12:55] ways and my thoughts than your thoughts
[12:58] for as the rain cometh and the snow from
[13:00] heaven and returneth not thither but WTH
[13:03] the Earth and maketh it to bring forth
[13:05] and to Bud that it may give seed to the
[13:08] S and bread to the eater so shall my
[13:12] word be that goeth forth out of my mouth
[13:16] so he's talking about the sewing he's
[13:18] talking about the former and latter rain
[13:20] which by the way is throughout
[13:22] prophecies in scripture of our day a
[13:24] former and a latter rain coming together
[13:27] but how's he going to bring it by the
[13:30] words spoken from his mouth and guess
[13:32] what they are it's my thoughts it's my
[13:35] words it's what I think about you
[13:37] somebody say praise the
[13:40] Lord you can believe whatever you want
[13:42] about yourself but one day God's going
[13:44] to come and say this is what I think
[13:46] about you this is my thoughts and guess
[13:48] what my thoughts are higher than your
[13:50] thoughts there's something that trumps
[13:52] everything that the devil tells about
[13:54] you and that's what God's word says
[13:56] about you you go ahead and believe your
[13:58] whole life if you want you what the
[13:59] devil has told you what your your family
[14:02] has told you you go ahead and believe it
[14:03] but I'm you want to start believing
[14:05] because those thoughts are not as high
[14:07] as God's thoughts and he says I'll bring
[14:10] the rain I'll bring the former latter
[14:11] rain and he says it will begin to Bud
[14:14] something else so shall my word goth
[14:15] forth out of my mouth and by the way if
[14:17] you know your Bible what is the mouth of
[14:19] God how does he speak it does everybody
[14:22] know what the mouth of it it's a
[14:25] prophet the scripture says it the the
[14:28] mouthpiece of God is a prophet that's
[14:30] what he brings his word to seow the seed
[14:32] is through a prophet I want you to hold
[14:34] on to that because that's what we'll get
[14:35] to today so shall my word be go forth as
[14:38] a my mouth it shall not return unto me
[14:41] void but it shall accomplish that which
[14:43] I please and it shall prosper in the
[14:46] thing where unto I sin it for ye shall
[14:48] go out you know what that's saying if
[14:49] it's my thought and I spoke it and it's
[14:52] planting the seed there is nothing there
[14:55] is no devil in hell there's nothing
[14:57] going to stop that from bu and coming
[15:00] forth for ye shall go out with joy and
[15:04] be led forth with peace the mountains
[15:06] and the hills shall Break Forth before
[15:08] you into singing and all the trees of
[15:11] the field shall clap their hands sounds
[15:13] like a Revival sounds like a pretty
[15:15] happy time sounds like a good thing what
[15:18] when God's thoughts are revealed to you
[15:21] about yourself and he plants that seed
[15:23] of his word and it shall not return void
[15:26] it will bring forth can you say Amen
[15:28] that that makes even the trees clap
[15:30] their hands that makes everything break
[15:32] into singing that's the thing that
[15:34] brings Joy that's the thing that brings
[15:38] peace nothing in this world will bring
[15:41] peace but what he said about you is a
[15:45] seed that's been
[15:47] sown now there's an element in when God
[15:50] speaks his word and I think it's with
[15:52] Mom too and I want to stress it just a
[15:54] little bit there comes a time when Mom
[15:56] has invested so many words
[15:59] and so many things and the father does
[16:01] as well but there is a comes a time when
[16:04] you have put all in and you invested so
[16:07] much teaching and training and you said
[16:08] this what they've done wrong what
[16:10] they've done right all these other
[16:11] things there actually comes a time when
[16:13] you you have to and it naturally happens
[16:16] you have to back off a little bit
[16:18] because they will eventually go I
[16:21] remember when Solomon just went here
[16:22] recently and I told him you know he
[16:24] needed to move out before at the first
[16:27] of the year I gave him a deadline he
[16:29] said you're kicking me
[16:30] out I said well you can word it that way
[16:34] that's not really what I said I think
[16:36] you need to go out and get used to
[16:37] things before you get married and the
[16:39] expenses and get you a place of your own
[16:41] I think you should do that before and
[16:42] not the day of the wedding that's just
[16:44] my advice to him and so uh I think he
[16:46] still views it as kicking him out but
[16:48] anyway the night before I went down and
[16:50] helped him pack and I started to get
[16:53] emotional so then I said okay I'm done
[16:55] with this and I went to bed and I stayed
[16:57] up till 3:00 in the morning and I'm late
[16:58] I'm over there in the bed just balling
[17:01] crying said to my I she said would you
[17:03] please go to sleep she said you wanted
[17:06] him to go and now you're
[17:08] crying I said I don't want him to go now
[17:11] I can't do this you know so she said get
[17:15] out of here and go down and tell him so
[17:17] I went downstairs I woke him up I just
[17:20] want you to know I love you and you
[17:21] don't have to go if you don't want to
[17:23] and and of course he's looking at me
[17:25] like I'm
[17:26] crazy you wanted this and I'm doing this
[17:29] but when it hits so it's mixed emotions
[17:31] but the day
[17:32] comes the day comes and so now and
[17:36] there's another natural thing that
[17:38] happens is that there's a certain
[17:39] backing off for several reasons of
[17:42] weighing in on all this glorious wisdom
[17:45] that you have for their life you think
[17:46] that you they're going to be welcome to
[17:48] hear that for the rest of their life uh
[17:52] but you know there's several reasons but
[17:54] there's a certain backing off to rest in
[17:57] what you've taught them what what you've
[17:59] invested in them and you've done enough
[18:01] and you've said enough and and you give
[18:04] that but there's a certain natural okay
[18:07] now let's see let's see how all this is
[18:10] done instead of because sometimes
[18:12] they're they say okay you know you
[18:13] you've said that already the last 20
[18:16] years of my life all right so I don't
[18:18] need to hear it again that's not really
[18:20] what they have but it's just more okay I
[18:22] got it Dad you know okay so there's a
[18:25] certain um after the seeds been planted
[18:28] and after you've invested there's a
[18:29] certain amount of Separation that has to
[18:32] happen and then you kind of get to see
[18:34] and watch What the Lord Has Done in
[18:36] their life but watch what you've
[18:38] dispensed and done everything you could
[18:40] and there's some things that you there's
[18:41] no perfect parent did you know that if
[18:43] you are please come and tell me I'd like
[18:45] to get your
[18:47] manual there's only one perfect parent
[18:50] and that's God our Father he's the
[18:53] perfect parent but if I can take my
[18:55] image from him and and borrow from him
[18:57] and use what he used and learn from him
[18:59] then I can be a better parent but there
[19:01] is no perfect parent and so you look you
[19:03] step back and mothers kind of have to do
[19:05] that uh it's a bit scary but if she's in
[19:09] invested the right things into her
[19:12] children then you step back and you you
[19:14] invested the right things especially the
[19:16] word of God you ought to rest in that
[19:18] and say okay now let's see the Harvest
[19:21] that comes from it and guess what
[19:23] parents have a promise even how they
[19:26] lead their children if you'll set them
[19:28] in the right direction Direction and
[19:29] invest those things you moms have a
[19:32] promise step back because if it's the
[19:34] right things you have a promise they'll
[19:36] it it'll never depart from them can you
[19:40] say
[19:41] Amen they might try to depart from it
[19:45] but what seed has been sown it'll never
[19:47] depart from
[19:48] them a lot of parents have to go through
[19:50] that when there's a season oh Lord what
[19:52] have I done
[19:54] wrong what is going on in that girl's
[19:57] life what is going on in that guy life
[19:59] my son my daughter there are some
[20:02] parents that have to go through it but
[20:03] you know what you need to rest in you
[20:05] need to rest in the Lord but this
[20:07] husband he waits and the thing about the
[20:10] waiting is it's you know people act
[20:12] different to when they have to wait for
[20:14] something Americans are not very good
[20:17] waiters we get everything quick you know
[20:19] we got uh we got drive-throughs which
[20:23] they're not as quick as they used to be
[20:24] but we got drive-throughs we've got
[20:26] instant potatoes and we've got poof this
[20:28] and put that and microwave and bang
[20:31] right bang bang bang bang and it it it
[20:35] conditions us we want stuff right now I
[20:37] want that loan right now I want that new
[20:40] truck or that car right now and it it
[20:42] we're conditioned by America and then we
[20:45] come over to God and we say God I want
[20:48] it right
[20:50] now you probably shouldn't say
[20:53] that just pray with faith let God bring
[20:56] it when he wants to bring it even if
[20:57] it's 20 years
[20:59] later because you spoke it he it's
[21:02] before our high priest he acknowledges
[21:05] what you've spoken let him do the work
[21:08] but we get impatient we and even though
[21:10] the scripture says to be still and know
[21:12] God you forget that when you want a
[21:14] prayer answered right
[21:17] now we forget the scripture says they
[21:19] that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[21:22] their strength there's a renewing of
[21:24] your strength by waiting and being
[21:26] patient on God like Abraham and Sarah
[21:30] when Sarah said it's not happening it's
[21:32] not happening take Hagar have relations
[21:35] with her maybe that's what God man is
[21:38] Hagar nothing but a
[21:40] mess every time we get ahead of God we
[21:46] produce ishmael's in our lives when
[21:49] Jesus said in Matthew here the about the
[21:52] parable of the sewing when he says the
[21:55] son of man is the one who plants and
[21:57] sews the good seed and then the same
[22:00] Jesus you listening the same Jesus said
[22:04] so shall it be in the coming of the son
[22:07] of
[22:08] man as in the days of Sodom as in the
[22:12] days of Noah so shall it be in the
[22:14] coming of the son of man he would come
[22:17] you say well yeah he's going to come and
[22:19] meet us in the sky no no first of all
[22:21] what's he do he comes with The Good
[22:24] Seed he places it in the generation
[22:29] and now the bride just says
[22:32] Lord you I'm I'm having long patience
[22:35] for this because it's not my own
[22:38] righteousness it's not me trying to put
[22:40] something on I'm not going to try to
[22:42] make something work I'm going to enjoy
[22:45] worship and enjoy what you give me in
[22:46] the word because I know you're
[22:47] continuing to mold me into an adopted
[22:50] son and daughter of God I'm going to
[22:52] continue that but the final result and
[22:54] the climax to all this I cannot make
[22:56] this happen you've pled to the seed
[22:59] you're sending the former latter rain I
[23:02] don't want to touch it and produce an in
[23:04] Ismail I don't want to do anything to it
[23:06] and I'm certainly not bailing
[23:08] out does anybody see in the scripture
[23:11] where the farmer is saying I've waited
[23:13] long enough I'm out of here you can't
[23:15] find it in the elect in the end time the
[23:17] elect are saying he's planted the seed
[23:20] the son of man has come and done it in
[23:22] the end time and I'm
[23:24] staying until I see this good seed bring
[23:27] forth what God said it would bring forth
[23:30] I'm here to stay can you say Amen can't
[23:33] find that farmer running off cuz he know
[23:35] it's the good seed and he knows who's
[23:37] planted it he didn't plant it himself
[23:39] but it's good seed and it's going to
[23:41] bring this
[23:42] Harvest oh hasten that day Lord but he
[23:45] said the son of man so the son of man's
[23:47] going to repeat himself again if anybody
[23:49] doesn't understand the repeat process of
[23:51] scriptures you're not going to
[23:53] understand the Bible because you're what
[23:54] you're going to do say I believe
[23:55] everything here but I don't believe God
[23:57] can do it again in our day you don't
[23:59] understand the repeat
[24:00] process cuz what he did in the past he
[24:03] can repeat it again if he raised the
[24:05] dead in the past he can raise the dead
[24:07] this
[24:07] morning if he opened up blind eyes back
[24:10] then he can do it this morning something
[24:12] should be said about this impatience and
[24:16] this nervousness further because even
[24:19] John the Baptist himself who was the for
[24:22] Runner of the first coming of Christ
[24:25] once he spoke it once he said behold
[24:28] Behold the Lamb of God who takes away
[24:31] the sin of the world and then he says
[24:33] when he proclaimed here he is then he
[24:36] said I must decrease he must increase
[24:40] the office of John with the spirit of
[24:43] Elijah was fulfilled at that day and he
[24:46] stepped back you could no longer just
[24:48] follow his office you had to follow
[24:51] Christ that's the
[24:55] transition and so he said Behold the
[24:57] Lamb of God but look what happened to
[24:58] John he gets in prison he gets depressed
[25:01] sends his disciples he's
[25:03] wondering is he the one got his eagle
[25:07] eyes filmed over what can happen during
[25:10] the delay Satan can bring you a bunch of
[25:15] doubts so we're not talking just see
[25:18] Jesus said there's not a man risen
[25:19] greater than John the Baptist and the
[25:21] greatest one of the greatest prophets to
[25:23] initiate this this Covenant with Christ
[25:25] to coming in one of the greatest
[25:26] prophets sat in the prison and doubted
[25:29] he had already said this is the
[25:31] Lamb so our human minds and the
[25:34] nervousness is it's not happening quick
[25:37] enough when's he going to set up his
[25:39] kingdom this is the Messiah this is the
[25:42] Lamb of God when's it all going to
[25:43] happen and it wasn't happening quick
[25:44] enough and he begin to wonder is this
[25:47] the
[25:49] one but he didn't have this principle
[25:51] I'm preaching to you this morning and
[25:53] that is that if you know who's planted
[25:55] the seed and you know you've spoken the
[25:57] word of God by saying behold this is the
[25:59] Lamb of God then you you you rest in the
[26:02] word of God why did God Rest the seventh
[26:05] day does anybody know because the other
[26:09] six days he had spoken the spoken word
[26:11] of God and spoke all things of existence
[26:14] even his own son creative power and on
[26:17] the seventh day after he created it all
[26:20] he stepped back and rested and what did
[26:22] he rest in he rested in his spoken
[26:26] word now that this is spoken there isn't
[26:28] any devil in hell that's going to stop
[26:31] it can I get an amen if God spoke it no
[26:34] devil in hell is going to stop it if
[26:36] God's got a hold of your wayward child
[26:38] there's nothing going to stop and
[26:39] there's no devil in hell that's going to
[26:41] keep them from coming back to
[26:43] God if God's got their number and
[26:45] they're predestinated seat of God
[26:47] they're going to come back no matter how
[26:50] long it takes if God's involved he
[26:52] doesn't say something in the oh I
[26:54] shouldn't have said that we do that
[26:55] sometimes we say I shouldn't have said
[26:57] that God God's never said I shouldn't
[26:59] have
[27:00] said God has never said I shouldn't have
[27:02] said that when he speaks it the first
[27:05] time it's done it'll go out it'll bring
[27:08] a crop and it will not return without a
[27:12] prospering can you say Amen a harvest
[27:15] everything he said it would happen it's
[27:17] going to come back just the same if the
[27:19] Lord comes tomorrow where is your heart
[27:21] right
[27:22] now are you
[27:24] saved have you received the Lord
[27:29] and for those who are going to rapture
[27:30] we know that it will be the ones that go
[27:33] in because the B Jesus said there'll be
[27:35] wise virgins and foolish virgins some
[27:38] who are left behind they're virgins
[27:40] they're very dedicated Christians but
[27:43] Jesus separated two crowds and said the
[27:45] one who have oil oil is the Holy Spirit
[27:48] the ones who go in the Rapture are the
[27:50] ones who have this holy spirit it's what
[27:54] Jesus said it's what Jesus said I didn't
[27:56] separate him he separated I tell you I
[27:59] ask you are you ready to
[28:02] go do you have the true Holy Spirit in
[28:04] your life and the identification of the
