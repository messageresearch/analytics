========================================

genesis chapter 3. lilly lewis is related to the sister sisler family so we've just been supporting her and her time of losing a family member there so we pray god will be with her and strengthen her and her family during this time of loss genesis chapter 3 and i'm sure this scripture has been read hundreds and hundreds of times over the years thousands no doubt and especially in the last days as the truth of what happened in the garden comes out and god shows us what took place there i don't hear a lot of ministers um as far as on the outer realms read this the outer churches outside of kind of our sister churches read these things a lot but it's such a poor important set of scriptures to show satan in his subtle way and what began the fall of mankind genesis chapter 3 the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god hath made and he said unto the woman yea hath god said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god hath said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest ye die and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for god doth know that in that day ether of then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of both of them were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sold fig leaves together and made themselves aprons and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden in the cool of the day and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god among the trees of the garden so as as they have fallen from the word and believing the word eve as i want you to notice now what begins to unravel because eve has fallen from the word she's taken satan's interpretation of the word how many know that everything this whole world come under a curse everything unraveled when she left the word and so this is the transition and so they're hiding and now the voice comes in the garden and they never had to hide before never felt guilt before never had any of this happen but everything has lost now their their glory their their holy veil their fellowship their oneness everything unravels and they're hiding from god hiding from the presence of the lord verse 9 said and the lord god called unto adam and said unto him where art thou and he said i heard thy voice in the garden and i was afraid he had never been afraid before never been afraid of god i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself and he said who told thee that thou was naked hast thou eaten of the tree where have i commanded that thou shouldest not eat and the man said now the normal answer would have been yes i vader that tree look at his answer and the man said the woman whom thou gave us to be with me she gave me of the tree and i did eat and the prophet makes this comment here this would have never happened before but he makes it come he says now he says they begin passing the buck they had never done that before and what should have been an honest answer and owning up to what he had done he passes the buck to his wife fallen condition when you're blaming everybody else i like what burley burley said last sunday he said when things happen and people do things he said the first thing that i do is look back at myself because if you can ask god to change yourself you can handle what a lot of people do to you but the blaming game never works if you keep blaming people you become a victim in life man said the woman thou gave us to me she gave me of the tree and i did eat and the lord god said unto the woman what is this thou hast done and her response was not normal either the woman said the serpent beguiled me and i did eat amen heavenly father bless your word strengthen me lord strengthen the congregation through the word that you have given and lord we have been blessed by the your presence among us here today and we commit the service and these precious souls into your hands in jesus name amen god bless you as your seated this morning i feel to go further in the message that the prophet preached oneness and you're welcome to listen or to read as we're going through this about relationships you're welcome to read it i encourage you to do it some have said they're doing that and so it's called oneness of god and i think it's 1962. so i'd encourage you to listen to it but i feel to go further with the subject and i would like to title this this morning relationships after the fall a few weeks ago we talked about relationships before the fall and now i'd like to begin to talk about relationships after the fall because relationships changed after the fall everything changed after the fall and in some ways we have lived out our lives dealing with relationships after the fall and after everything happened we've dealt with a lot of that in our lives until christ comes in our lives and redemption power begins to affect us and we realize when we get the holy spirit in our lives the holy ghost in our lives it begins to change everything and redeem us back to what we lost before the fall in the garden but all of us have lived with what it means to live with families and to live in situations and live in schools and go to schools and we've all lived with broken relationships we have all lived in families that have been broken it amazes me what family situations some of you have come from and as i hear it i just say that person is a miracle that they're even standing that's a miracle that the grace of god has them even have any desire for god it's a miracle that they know that their true fathers on the face of the earth because of what their fathers did to them and i stand amazed and that's the redemption power of god to show you it doesn't matter how broken the relationships are god through his holy spirit is out to restore relationships that have been broken the blood of calvary is the redemption to bring us back to what has been lost in the garden and i know you believe that this morning but i want to continue to talk about what happened after the fall that we understand what begins to unravel and then we understand how god begins to restore these things back and we don't know how far we'll get today but just listen close and i believe we'll have some things that will encourage you and be a blessing to you and as i said you're welcome to listen to the oneness message it's very rich as as the prophet just takes these segments of oneness the first thing he talks about is that what true oneness was in god before the fall that's the first thing he takes and the fellowship they had the sweetness they had and walking in the cool of the day fellowshipping in true oneness with god and then he then he goes into a transition and i'll read some of the quotes today how man adam and eve fell from that oneness what made them fall and then he goes into a section that talks about satan who's the one who broke the oneness then he begins a process satan of he's the one who broke the oneness that then he begins to present to mankind a false or an alternative oneness back to god so the same devil who broke the true oneness is now working on the people to give them an alternative approach to god an alternative oneness to try to bring the people together the tower of babel uh uh balaam under israel a false union a false oneness so now we can speed ahead to denominational systems who in their efforts to get mankind back to god do not bring them to the the power of the redemptive calvary but they actually bring him through a system of psychology or a system of man to try to correct man and correct his problems and bring him into oneness with god that is denominational systems are headed up by satan himself and it's an alternative to the true blood of jesus christ and salvation bringing a person by the holy ghost back into true oneness again like they had in the garden of eden and so now then then after he talks about satan good then he shows god and redemption through the prophets doing two things when god moves upon the people of god who are who are not in oneness with god he sends a prophet and he does two things the first thing he has to do is separate the people from the false oneness that they're in first thing he has to do is speak boldly through the prophets and say you're going to have to leave first thing he said to abraham he says leave your kindred leave the people that around you and he separated them and but why was he separating him from unbelief because he wanted to bring him to true oneness you cannot come to true oneness with god as an individual until you're willing to separate from the things that are a false union if you're not willing to separate from friends in the world if you're not willing to take that stuff and trust me the holy spirit while he's wooing you back will speak to you about separating from all the things that are keeping you from god there must be a separation from wrong things for you to be properly in union for with god it can never happen unless you're willing to separate from the things of the world separate from the wrong associates can you say amen separate from a wrong view of the bible unless you're ready to separate from denominations that's why it says in the revelations the call of the end was come out of her my people come out of those systems come out of religion because religion isn't working anymore you've got to come out of religion so you can find a true union with god and that's why prophets are so bold you'll not find a bible prophet including this one and all of them that don't come and just blasting out to bring the people out of their mess can you say amen he's going to blast out the jezebels he's going to blast and us preachers we're not necessarily called to be prophets we're pastors and evangelists and different things and don't try to be a pastor and be a prophet a prophet is a special calling if if a pastor is a prophet to his people every service he'll damage his people but a prophet is a prophet expect him in this day to be the spirit of elijah that's going to rebuke the jezebels don't ask him to be something else can you say man because god is breathing and speaking through that prophet it's bold can you say man jerking you out of separating you from the thing that's hindering your life don't be mad at the prophet he's doing what he's supposed to do you know when all this stuff come up about devaluing whether this prophet was the elijah or not and he was so bold and he said this and he said this against the jezebels and spoke against the women of this generation and how they were getting all track and immodesty and what they wore and becoming jezebels with their makeup and everything when he when he did that people were mocking it and saying and just like they did to elijah himself but they've been mocking it and i just preached the message let's let elijah be elijah and say but but wait a minute if he's elijah and today god said i'll send that spirit five times and it's gonna have the same nature to it it's not gonna be elijah elisha john the baptist had that spirit on him can you say amen sends a prophet to the gentiles and then he sends it one more time to the jews i hope you know that god so trusted the spirit of elijah to bring his word he sends it five times john the baptist had it on him and john the baptist if you'd been around my preachings light compared to john the baptist why because he had the spirit of elijah on him he wasn't going to back down he was going to rebuke that generation and he was going to speak the truth whether he had no one he owed to he wasn't paid by anybody and so he's going to speak it and so when elijah came why are we so surprised that his ministry is going to be jerking the people out of denominations out of worldliness can you say amen out of egypt like moses did bringing them out of egypt so they can come into the promised land let's let elijah be elijah and the way i approach the message is that i respect everything if i don't understand something i respect it because it's elijah if i don't understand it i just i say lord i'm going to respect what he said because i know it's important what he said you know we're living in a different generation now people are just nitpicking and and picking out what they want of it i've never done that and i'm aware that there's a human part and there's a profit product i'm aware of that but i'm care i'm careful i'm just speaking my own personal i'm careful to start nitpicking what's this and what's of god and what's not of god because of the man's office and god gave him that office and if elijah spirit was sent to us to jerk us out of false unions then let elijah be elijah i don't want to be elijah i'm not trying to be elijah but let elijah be elijah listen to it when i got the holy ghost at 16 i said if god was gracious enough if this is true if this is true that god just like john the baptist sent a man with the spirit of elijah on him then i ought to take to some time sometime and find out what he said i know some of you haven't done that but i'll tell you you ought to find out what he said god said elijah we all still believe that right this is a church that believes that those days are passed now as far as him but but god sent him and some of the some of the benefits of oneness with god that we enjoy today is because god sent elijah to call us out of false unions you come to church you enjoy you enjoy this present and some people piggyback off of a good presence i have a good feeling there i feel good when i leave you got to get beyond a good feeling and you've got to be birthed by the holy ghost you've got to have a relationship with jesus christ you can't come and say i get a good feeling and then it's gone by monday you can't do that you've got to get something deeper than that you've got to get something real can you say man people come and they don't even know this is a message church this is a message church we preach what elijah preached because god said elijah and some of the atmosphere and the benefits and the church order that you're enjoying today was because elijah spoke things to set the church in order some of these sisters that dress modest this didn't come from just some religion it came from elijah bringing us back to what modesty was it doesn't originate with me it doesn't originate with william branham god loved his sisters enough and his daughters enough to say this is what a woman is this is how a woman dresses this is what a man is and thank god we got it because now a man and a woman doesn't even know what they are anymore it's all messed up but god sent us elijah to tell us what a man was according to the scripture if you'll stay in that word young person if you get your mind off of the world and off of your phone and get in the word you'll know what a man is you'll know what a woman is and you'll marry a true woman because you know by god's order what a woman is and the right one to marry you marry the wrong person because you weren't in the word you made choices based upon worldly standards god through redemption used the prophets to separate the people from false unions i don't know why i elaborate on that but it must be a reason let elijah be elijah mockham all if you want to mock him and you don't believe it's elijah and that the scripture was fulfilled through this prophet i respectfully shake hands and courtesy shake hands with you god bless you go on with god please respect it go away respectfully because if you're going to stand and say first of all i would say to people and i've had him talk to me he wasn't elijah once you remove that absolute of scripture who elijah was for this generation then that's everything so now my first question is well who is he then who fulfilled it because we need them and they don't have an answer for that well it's just the spirit that comes on all the people i said well it wasn't a spirit that came on all the people in john the baptist day it was a man that had the spirit of elijah on him let's stick with the bible oh it's the spirit that's going to send revival i've talked to him at homeschool conventions and they preach on malachi 4 5. and it's to bring this and bring that and so elijah i asked a man after he'd preached on he says elijah has come to bring the fathers back to children i asked him big speaker in the homeschool movement i said hey i said you know isn't it interesting i said do you believe the spirit of elijah was on john the baptist do you believe it came on elisha he said yes i said why is it that you guys teach that it's going to just be on all the people today but every place in the bible it was on one man he said i never thought of that god bless you see you later that was it you can't break the scriptural pattern you can fuss with the man all you want to but you're fussing with the god's scriptural pattern now does it stay one man no after god's done his one-man ministry then it comes on a bride comes on a five-fold ministry so now i can safely say we're past the day of one man ministries everybody wanted to take over after brother brahm left you know the eighth angel the next prophet i'm the elisha coming to my church this is the only church to come no no no the scriptural pattern is once he sent the one man then god distributes his spirit by the holy ghost over all of his people and a many member bride that's why he could say the final voice to the final age it was not william branham the final voice to the final age is the bride somebody say praise the lord but let's not take away the value of one man i just just spent 20 minutes on the first paragraph of my notes so now even though true oneness was brought after calvary through the baptism of the holy ghost how many believe that's when true oneness came back whatever was lost in the garden was restored on the day of pentecost and that promise is unto you and your children as many of god should call throughout generations this is how we would come back to a union like in the garden of eden is that he would fill his people with his spirit and he would come and live in the heart that's where we come back to eden again that's the that's how redemption takes place he went to calvary poured out his spirit on the people and now we come back into what we lost in the garden everything that was lost we now receive the power of redemption to begin to rise above the fall and come out of the fall but the thing is after calvary and after the baptism of the holy ghost after 2 000 years then we needed malachi 4 and this is great that i'm talking about malachi 4 and elijah because it says in the bible just in case the young people don't know it says the last scriptures of the old testament if you have your bible you say well i've heard this time many many times before but somebody here some of our children may not have heard it malachi the prophet prophesies and says in malachi 4 he says verse 5 the last two scriptures of the old testament behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord that was not john the baptist it was at the just before judgment day and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse so now this is the prophecy of elijah coming but i want you to notice now what he does all right this prophet first part of it is to turn the hearts of the fathers the mosaic fathers that were in israel during jesus time to the children of pentecost who would receive the holy ghost so that's one part of it but then he says that he'll turn the hearts now as the second part he'll turn the hearts of the children back to the father so now after 2000 years they would they would have to be restored back to the pentecostal fathers and the original thing of what happened the original oneness that happened on the day of pentecost in that time so we would here's the subject i want to make it as simple as possible that scripture shows us if we needed someone to tie our hearts back to the pentecostal fathers in in the day of pentecost that means we have become disconnected from the fathers if we weren't disconnected with that holy ghost oneness and that original pentecost if we weren't disconnected he'd never have to send a prophet because we'd be fine after two thousand years we've got the same holy ghost we're filled with it everything's good but everything isn't good because even after calvary and even after the holy ghost fell on the benegas to bring us back into eden again after 2 000 years of creeds and dogmas and worldliness and laodicea and all this stuff we are not in union with god anymore we lost it and the children are disconnected from the faith of the pentecostal fathers so he said i'll send elijah and i'm going to reconnect you back to true oneness again i'm going to take the children the christians the children of the generation and i'm going to speak something to reconnect them to the pentecostal fathers and they're going to get the same holy ghost the same faith oh it ought to make us rejoice friends there's no hope with without what god sends us we're disconnected from the pentecostal fathers we're disconnected from a true baptism of the holy spirit we're disconnected and by the way i'll let you know without that you don't have any overcoming power to live in laodicea but god said i'll restore you back to the faith of the pentecostal fathers so did you ever notice the wording the hearts of the children to the fathers when you talk about children and fathers that's a that's a relationship thing that's a that's a word picture you know he could have used anything there he could have said he shall turn the theologians back to the correct doctrine elijah shall come and turn all the theologians back to true doctrine he didn't word it that way elijah shall come in the end time and restore christians of this generation back to the true christians of the original he could have worded that way but look where the way he worded it he shall turn this is about relationship this is about oneness this is about family when you talk about children fathers mothers dads sons daughters it's about relationship he said i'll restore the faith of the children back to the faith of the fathers in other words i'll bring them back to the word back to the true baptism of the holy ghost back to bible faith back to holy living back to relationship and back to living holy by relationship i'll get to that in a minute elijah will call us back to holy living but by relationship not rules but back to relationship we got enough religion we got enough dress code preached as a religion this elijah didn't come to bring us a dress code he comes to bring us back to relationship and the dress code will fall in line because you've got a relationship with the father the children will be turned back he could have said turn back theologians to correct doctrine and all these other things but it's worded children and fathers and that puts an image in our minds that this is about relationship a disconnection from the children of today to our fathers in the pentecost spiritually it's a spiritual connection first in other words the children were disconnected from the fathers everybody listening father's day is coming up next sunday in our generation the children spiritually were disconnected from the pentecostal fathers and elijah is going to come and restore us back to the father and the pentecostal fathers so a disconnection from the children of today to our fathers in pentecost spiritually and it says did you catch it he shall turn their hearts back to the fathers not their heads not their intellect he shall turn their hearts i can't see anything else but relationship in this it's relationship it's fathers it's children it's sons it's daughters and it's hearts it's not about the mind it's not about the father just just providing for you but it's about the father coming into relationship with you so with father's day coming up i might say this the worst problem we have today is there's broken fellowship between mankind and the heavenly father there's no connection to the original faith of oneness of god connection with god and the sons of men but the word brings us back to that relationship now because of that disconnect because of that disconnect spiritually people are not getting the true relationship of the holy ghost they're getting a religion and because of that because of that now you have another problem that to me is the second most problem in our world natural disconnections from fathers and children you can read the articles brother rap sent me one uh something last week and he also sent me something here uh of a film documentary that's just been recently done i haven't seen it yet but i do want to see and it comes from it comes from the kendrick brothers and i thank god for the kindred brothers some baptist men from brothers from flor from georgia who have put so many films together with strong biblical themes they don't care about what people think they just say it and i i love the films because guess what there's like a very small percentage of movies to watch today there's a very small percentage that christians can watch and it not affect the holy ghost that's in them very few but when one comes out like the ten commandments with brother branham praise the lord for it and these are so good i don't know how somebody could watch somebody like something like fireproof i'd like a lot of message couples to watch that film fire proof and if you're not moved by that to seek a better marriage you're just too cold i don't know what it is or you think you got too much pride to watch that but i'm telling you it moves you what that man did in repentance to restore the marriage back to god it moves you it is done so well a lot of message marriages need to watch it if they won't listen to the word maybe they can get something out of that praise the lord but the kindred brothers did this and i'm anxious to watch it but brother rap said it's it's titled uh show show me the father and it's this whole subject that his people are beginning to pin down what's the problems come from most problems come from in our generation disconnect fathers that don't know how to be fathers fathers who provide for their kids but they don't need there's no relationship with her children and that breakdown in relationship with fathers is actually the cause of so many problems i've said it before if you talk talk to most men on death row in the prisons you'll narrow it down most of them confess i hated my father i had no relationship with my father murders rapists and you tie it back now you never justify that as being the problem if someone's murdered somebody but but you got to look at the core of where it come from it's a breakdown in fathers and children and don't think that we don't have a little bit of that around our ranks where the f the children are actually scared to death to open up certain subjects to their father because there is no relationship with her father he's provided for him he's gave him food he's did this maybe even left them a business but there is no he doesn't know their hearts can i get any help here this morning he has no concern about their hearts he doesn't know where they're at and i'll just say this before i get to some of the quotes i i meant to say this a couple sundays ago when this when these shootings begin to take place it's interesting first of all they never bring up you never hardly ever hear it of all the video games that they have that have fed on since 18 years of it in their bedrooms doing it they never talk about that as being a factor but one thing that they never talk about is the parents and and the prophet said it's parent delinquency it's not just parent delinquency but it's parents that are that are disengaged from their kids the video game has raised these boys because like burley said last week you know parents get tired sometimes of raising children so if you get too tired of the pressure you just basically you know what go do something i can't take you anymore and that's basically what this generation has done they haven't taken the responsibility of relationship with their kids and so they've let video games and videos raise their children if you let a video game that's shooting people raise your kid for 18 years and he's been in his room he has to be in the house because he can't provide for himself but you have made no effort to get close to them to take them fishing to find their hearts and they put him in there i can't deal with you he's rebellious i don't want to be there's no so but 18 years old he goes and buys a gun and begins blasting children and he doesn't even know is it the problem with the gun oh that's what the democrats say is the problem with mental health that's what the republicans say or is it a problem that this kid in such loneliness does not know any relationship with the father and mother because these parents are saying they're coming back and say we cannot believe that our son did this this is not our son oh yes it is and friends i'm not fully blaming the prayers but i'm going back to brother what brother brahm said we got parents in this generation that's disengaged clocked out timed out of parenting and besides that besides that if they don't have the word to hold them and to instruct their sons and they're just functioning then they buy into everything's okay well yeah go do that go out and be with a girl at 14 years old go out with 17 years old go out with somebody and so and and we're taught that if you tell them they can't do that you're not allowed to tell them that you're too strict of a parent even in the message of saying you're too strict of a parent you're a legalist i am not a legalist if i tell my daughters you're not going out with that boy i don't know why i don't have more amens here i am not a legalist i'm in charge of my home and i have a right to tell them right and wrong [Applause] matter of fact when they get 30 years old my kids are still going to hear me telling them right or wrong whether they want to hear it or not because that's my position i love them as a father i'm going to speak up i'm going to say something and i'm going to remind them of what the message taught us if they leave the message i'm going to remind them of it listen god sent a prophet this is what we believe and it's a it's a timeless truth can you say it it's not william branham this is not my beliefs it's not william branham's beliefs this is a timeless truth and if we'll live by it god says i'll bless your home i'll bless your marriage i'll bless your family i'll have a relationship with you somebody say amen this morning satan has devalued all this stuff and made it a religion but the message is not religion it's relationship with god god was saying i want a relationship with you and when you get that you will have a relationship with your children you won't be afraid of your children you won't be afraid to speak up you'll love them gently gently love them you won't be a dictator to them i don't believe in that but love is corrective if you love them you'll correct them love is corrective now not all correction is love but because not all correction is love it doesn't dump out the fact that love is corrective what a watered-down generation that parents i don't want to say anything let me just bring up while i'm on the side let me bring up another thing there's a lot of parents that raise their children with a resentment towards the message themselves and the word and so they based their home on i will never tell my kid that thing now wait a minute wait a minute if it's the truth of god's word it's not your truth it's not you're not cramming it down the road you as a parent are supposed to bring the truth of god's word and if you say i go to a message church you're supposed to be training your kids and what the message said or else don't confuse them don't come here don't come to a message church find another place that's closer to your beliefs to raise your children but don't send him to a place where the preacher is going to be up here like he's doing it today and just preaching out against things and then at home you don't believe it we have different beliefs at home don't confuse your kid like that don't do that we believe that elijah came in this day we believe that he gave us structure for the church we believe he spoke the word he said well if god done that before yes when calvary came and the resurrection took place god sent paul a prophet to set the church in order and in corinthians you'll have things about sex sexual temptation marriage divorce you have it all why because god had to speak specific things of how to live to his prophet he's done the same thing today after the resurrection of the word of god out of history can you say man he sent a prophet to bring order to the church and we're enjoying many things of an atmosphere of purity because we preach those things even even when we come in here and we're quiet in the sanctuary most churches don't do that they use it for dinner and they use it for this and you and sometimes they have to but they say we set aside because and he said why are you so quiet visitors come why is everybody so quiet well it comes back to what a prophet said he said in order some of you would walk in and see if it's totally different go to a denomination sometime and see and and sally's yelling across the church five minutes before the service you know how you doing philip i shouldn't say sally's saying hi to philip but he's married and then you're gonna have phillips wife say what are you talking to my husband for him shut up salary sally you know i got to get myself out of this but you know what we're enjoying boundaries and structure and order from a prophet and some of you because you don't study the message you don't even know why we're enjoying that we're enjoying teachers and youth leaders here that are teaching the principles of the bible and the message to our young people at meetings and by the way that's what we're teaching don't kiss before marriage don't be physical before marriage don't go out alone a lot until the time proper time to do that keep it honorable keep it responsible if they come to our youth meetings this is what they're going to hear they're going to hear quotes of william brown they're going to hear bible can you say amen this is what we do we've been doing it for 33 years i don't mean to boast but we are not changing things here we're not loosening up the standards we're not changing the dress standards some people wear things around here and sometimes it's coming up sort of i just have to say we don't believe that around here we don't believe in wearing that that's not the principle because over time people begin to think that's what we do we believe and teach what the word of god says because it has set protections in place for our young people and guess what a lot of these young people i love them because a lot of them i love them all but you know what if the truth we're told they appreciate the protections appreciate the boundaries they appreciate when some scallywag walks in and starts to get around our youth and he doesn't know our boundaries and he starts doing this and doing that he's going to get corrected real fast you keep your hands off those girls or you're not allowed to come back our girls appreciate that that's not legalism that's called protections of the word of god so elijah we believe these things we believe we teach these things and the disconnect with fathers is a prevalent thing in our generation but more deeply is the separation from god the heavenly father to the sons of men and he said i'll send you elijah and he'll restore the hearts of the children back to a true experience of oneness with the heavenly father and that's why i can safely say if you didn't have a good father on this earth you'll have one in the heavenly father you come into that relationship and god will fulfill what you lost in your earthly father can you say amen god's not just making things up as he goes along he knew you would have a bad family knife he knew you come from a broken home so he provided for you the body of christ brothers and sisters can you say amen a father relationship he provides what was lost in this redemption if a daddy didn't tell you young girl what to do and wasn't vocal enough didn't have the relationship to do it if he didn't if he didn't god will provide men in your life and images in your life of true fathers that'll love you and tell you you should be thankful for it you'll provide it in the body of christ so these parents johnny is spending countless years when he comes home from school he barely gets through school barely gets through his grades gets parents get calls all the time of all the things going on in school and they just they just barely deal with it but there's no there's no absolute of the word but there's no relationship if there was some relationship with that child then he might be helped a little bit he might turn out a decent citizen in society and not mow down people with a gun but i would say if we uncovered it most of these situations the parents is a big part of it being disconnected i'm saying this because we as parents should be careful that we don't do the same thing and we have lonely young people that are coming home from school in college and basically finding their home and their relationship online instead of with mommy and daddy because they have to they're lonely satan's abused their loneliness and now instead of mom and daddy connecting with them and getting them around the right young people in the right fellowship instead of that they find other friends why why is my kid choosing this friend because young people need friends and eventually they're going to choose their friends that's fine but i'm just saying the parents should weigh in and say there's right right ones to choose and there's wrong ones to choose and and weigh in and parents should weigh in thank god for all the parents who did that here but sometimes children were raised on video games and they're going to a message church and it's because parents they don't know where their kids are at they don't know why the decisions are making is because in loneliness they spent most of their years in their bedroom alone and there's no connection i don't have a perfect home i'd never say that but i i i tried with my wife to make the word and the message the absolute for our home i've got to skip some of this now but i'm just trying to find a place to jump in how many know that eve left the word and because she left the word that's when the fellowship was broke with god okay i'll read these quotes next time so leaving the word is the thing that unraveled everything okay but i thought of it last night in the garden of eden it wasn't just the word it wasn't just that god spoke and said don't even don't eat of that tree they didn't have a bible they just god spoke to them that you can eat of all the trees but stay away from that one don't eat of that or that day you eat that die and that's the only word they had from god but guess what it wasn't just the word that god spoke to him to live by and if you stay by this you'll have life you live but it wasn't just the word his presence who was the tree of life a person so even though he spoke the word his presence was there as a person coming down every day in the cool of the evening and fellowshipping with them eden was not this thing of rules without relationship they had relationship and because they stayed with the word it kept that relationship intact when they left the word then the relationship was broken with god you see and so you know you have uh uh rules for a home i'm gonna get into that you have rules for a home we try to base it upon we tried to base upon the message and different things so you got these rules but the rules as it says rules without relationship breeds rebellion relationship without rules breeds rowdiness i've seen it parents want all relationship i want to be a buddy to my teenager my friend to him but i can't tell him what's right and wrong i just want to be a buddy to him we'll see how that goes rules without relationship breeds rebellion but relationship without rules brings rowdiness so eden was not a place of rules without relationship they were fellowshipping with a with the lord every day it was wonderful wasn't it there was a there was a person there it was the tree of life and they fellowship with the lord they were with them it wasn't this this thing and in my home how would it be if i had rules to my home the the nice thing about the rules of my home is that it's not just the rules i've set for my home and you're going to abide by these if you're going to live here but i'm a person they can come and talk to me about the rules you know i i love it these guys you know my youngest is 19 now and they still can't get the curfew right i have 11 o'clock curfew i got a 25 year old still at home i've got a 22 year old a 19 year old and the simplest things you know now there's more important rules than the curfew but that's important to me you know so but you see i'm a person so i have the rule being by 11 o'clock you know and i always get these texts you know at 11 02. and you know so but i thought about last night thankfully they have a dad that they can text because if i had set the rule and i wasn't a person i was involved this is the rules for the family and now i'm out of it there's no relationship with you if that's the rules and there's a punishment to the rule there's no appeal there's nothing that can be talked about so now you're done and i tell them this that you're you know you're grounded for life it's a big joke this is the third time you've done this and you're grounded for life well we both know that that's not true we're not going to ground them for life parents really shouldn't say that because you know it's not going to happen but i threaten anyway don't do this again or you're grounded for the rest of your life well what if i leave and get married no you're still grounded there's going to be limitations with your wife or your husband you just get that extreme statement because you're trying to get these kids abide by the rules but in my home there's all the rules and a lot of those have been based upon the word of god some are the word of god some some of the message of the hour all that's valued what the prophet said like when he said he might as well say it to parents this must this is my father's day message today i guess because i don't get one next time brother marcus is here so it's my father's day message but you know brother bram says what should we allow our teenagers to participate in as young teens he said get them around christian fellowship as much as you can i find parents that won't do that i find parents thankfully who do as long as you can as long as they do get them around because it's the influence it's the image it's the it's the whole thing he said get them around and he said if she starts to date a guy that's not a desirable guy discourage her from dating a guy that's not the right type of fella and encourage her to date the right kind of guy sometimes that's all you can do but you should really you know what he's saying you weigh in on it that boy's going to hurt you that's not the right thing stay away from that you should listen to that young people because the red flag that you don't see might be coming through your parent you know they are the holy ghost for you until you get the holy ghost parents don't want to be the holy ghost to their kids no you have a right to do that love them enough to tell them so you know it's it's and we had a thing that they didn't spend the night with uh just anybody they went to a baptist school there but they didn't spend the night with just anybody rarely let them spend the night when they were young with other kids i had to know the kid i had to know the parents i had to know what they believed what they stood for and that was a rule you're just not going to do it because i realize i've got generations in my in my own family going back where they just let them go with just anybody and spend the night with just anybody and then now you have molestation cases and you have these things because you trusted you just wanted to get rid of them for the evening and you put your kids and people you don't know some people rather have their kids go out there and spend time with them but they don't encourage them to come to youth meetings and come to this some bad people there at the church shame on you for doing that our our worst here would be better than some connection to the world and some friend in the world you know i you know i i you don't spend the night and they knew that you know that's it and you're gonna hang around the kids from the church you're gonna attend their youth things you're not gonna attend those things and i just had it it seemed strict and so then when it would come up dad i'm getting i really like this fella you know i like this girl as far as you know we're friends and i didn't i wasn't against them for their friendships but spending the night and going with them to the mall was a different a story different story i don't know those parents i don't know what they believe so but they see i'm a person so that's the rule so they would come sometimes and say dad you know i want you to meet this father and i want your knees and we get together with him and this is how they live and so so they would appeal to me to get to know the father and so once i felt comfortable with what they believed it's a good uh baptist foundational standards of the body they have holiness in their home different things then i felt comfortable i might let him spend the night but it was very rare very rare i don't know if i'm from another planet or what it's just the way we did it i love my children too much just to send them anywhere there's situations sometimes when you give a little room and then satan takes advantage it's a shame but god is great god redeems was telling me about a situation one of my sons and he said i want to go with this guy and so she gave the room to do it because he got to a certain age she said go but she said this is what the boy's going to do he's going to watch these type of music movies he's going to listen to this type of music he's going to do this he's going to do that if you spend the night there that's what you can do all night because it's a discernment in my wife i mean we weren't born yesterday you tell a character a boy but what's on his facebook what he listens to what he does you can tell come on i'm not going to check my discernment out the door so she let him go i don't think you told me about this son you let him go she said this is going to happen this is going to happen this is going to happen came back the next day said mom he did everything you said you were right never wanted to go over there again so you got that little room there that he has to learn a lesson which can be good but you better be protective you're allowed the scripture gives you it's a mandate from the scripture for you to be protective that's what's called scriptural divine love can you say man for your kids but the thing about the rules of my home is that i'm i'm the father and if the father wasn't there without rules with the rules and there was no father there that would be a different thing they can come and talk to me they can come and fellowship with me they can come and talk it out can you say amen and and adam and eve the word that they were given to obey yes they obeyed it but it was a relationship it was beyond just the word it was the word brought relationship and so as i have rules to my whole soul household i'm a person as well and so i'm i'm a person who sets the rule but the person who sets the rules is present he's available can you see what i'm preaching if i preach the word to you i'm not first preaching the word there's a person here jesus christ and the person who wrote the rules is present and wants a relationship with you and isn't it interesting i'm going to have to wrap this up i didn't get anywhere in my notes but i'm going to wrap it up isn't it interesting after the fall and i didn't get to any of the subject about what happens after the fall i want to get on the blaming game and all that but isn't it interesting when all begins to unravel and they broke the word they broke the word and when they broke the word they hindered the relationship isn't it interesting that the person the lord is still trying to find them so they broke the word they lost the word they lost the glory of god it's a mess can you say amen but i can tell you when they're hiding in the bushes he the lord come after them to try to find them this message this word is not just about the word and the commandments and doing them this is about a person can you say amen and i don't care how far you try to leave the word if the person loves you he's going to come and find you adam where are you who told you you was naked what's going on here i've said it many times but i think it was brother ron spencer who said it when when when when lucifer drew a third part of the stars god never went after him to try to bring him back but when one sun when one sun falls he comes down and he's looking for that sun trying to find relationship again this is not about just books and tapes and bibles there's a person of christ that i'm preaching to you and he's here in this service young people he's here in this service we teach the rules we teach the boundaries of courtship we teach this don't wear this that's unmodest but listen this goes beyond us just telling you that this is a person he wants relationship with you he loves you he's here this morning but i want a relationship but i don't want the rules oh there's lots of christians today that dump out all the things that brother branham said but i still want a relationship with jesus christ and in the garden the word was tied right with the person and you can never say well i'd like to have the person but i don't want the word never happened because he is the word he gave you his word it's never going to happen i just want my relationship with jesus christ in my my bible and that's all i need i don't need all this add-ons of william branham be careful what you say i really i mean that respectfully i just want a relationship you can't have a relationship and backslid against the word you can't leave the word and have a relationship with jesus christ but guess what we can have both you can have both and i would like to get into a scripture a couple of scriptures that mentioned dominion because not only did adam and eve have relationship they had the word and all that was holding everything together but they had dominion when they had all that they had dominion which means power when you go to the new testament paul mentions the word and power together all the time it's the word and power it's the word and power when the pharisees see jesus he says they said he teaches but it's not just the word there's power in his word there's power in his word it's not just the word there's power in it so when calvary redeemed us back and now we have redemption back through the word of god we come back to the word we have relationship again but we don't just have relationship we have dominion we have power over the enemy we have power over sin sin doesn't control us we control sin our our habits or our i should say our desires don't control us we by the power of the holy spirit control our desires this comes with power with it and when you know the person he says i'll give you power over unclean spirits i'll give you power over diseases can you say amen i'll give you power over lust i'll give you power over pornography i'll give you power with this holy ghost i'll give you dominion over things instead of things controlling you you're controlling things that's what adam and eve were instead of your finances controlling you you control your finances instead of your temper controlling you you control your temper by the holy ghost praise be his name i love him this morning don't you praise me those scriptures are they were astonished at his doctrine luke 4 32 for his word was with power so when jesus came his word wasn't just commandments anymore it had power with it first corinthians 4 20 for the kingdom of god is not in word but in power i'm not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ for it's the power of god unto salvation when i came to you i didn't come with enticing words of man's wisdom but i can to you in the power and the demonstration the life of the holy ghost this isn't just commandments this isn't just books and tapes but there's a person that brings power in your life to be able to live above sin first thessalonians 1 5 our gospel came unto you not in word only but also in power and in the holy ghost and much assurance as we know what matter of men we are among you for your sake we stand with all of his word you have the person relationship with the person and it brings dominion dominion over the enemy let's stand together if you would if i get into this the other parts here we'll be here much longer so the relationships after the fall it wasn't what it was before but god in his grace said i'm going to come and find my own and even though calvary wasn't there yet to restore the whole redemptive process he as the person was finding them in the garden of eden finding them hiding here's everything that came from the fall guilt shame blaming one another sin hiding shame knew they were naked so they're hiding in is i don't know if it was a matter of minutes or hours but everything changed because of the fault every and their relationship changed they're blaming brother francis they're passing the buck i want to get into next time i preach passing the book and this generation that blames everybody else that's what the fall brings that's what the fall brings if you're still blaming everybody else that's what the fall brings you're going to have to say lord give me the holy spirit change me because i know when i come out of come out of this worldly atmosphere and come to your kingdom i know i will no longer blame anybody else and if i did something i'll own up to it bring it to the cross and i can actually live in victory over how anybody treats me bad if they treat me bad i can be victorious over it if they handle something wrong with me i can live victorious over it if a preacher done me wrong i can live victorious over it if my father did me wrong in life i can overcome it i can live above it think of jesus now when he comes back into this earth i love the song welcome to our world because now he comes into our world that's a broken world have been living six five thousand years after the fall broken relationships it's a mess and jesus comes into our world that way and we're all an absolute mess broken homes broken families prostitutes everything and he comes into that but he's bringing a relationship with the father he has a relationship with the father he doesn't just have the word he has a relationship with he's one with the father how many believe that and that's what he needs because when he comes into a broken world he has the power to be able to be able to handle it to change situations not being in not be influenced but he would actually become an influence with with that in him he would become an influence and there we would come dealing with situations with a woman that's caught in adultery and the same thing that happened in the garden when god rushed after them and he's the person here the woman's taking adultery and the only thing in this broken world that they had was religion of pharisees and sadducees the only thing they had to give making proselytes if we can just get to the church and wash you up a little bit and get rid of your things that you're wearing wrong and get you out of your life of prostitution run you through through psychological seminars run you through the steps here the only thing they had with this broken world was religion and religion isn't working anymore it didn't work then it's not working now it's the only thing they had but jesus was different he had a relationship with the father somebody sent me a quote this morning i think kenny and tina sent it out he said when you love god you love others correctly too when you have a relationship with god and you're loving him right he's you know he's loving you and there's relationship you can love others right so jesus came with all that he wasn't afraid of this broken world he had the answer for him when he comes into situations like the woman and they had every right to say she needs to be stoned we've caught her we've got the stones in our hand and they want to know what jesus says and there's nothing to stop the law from being acted out there they needed to stone her except for one thing except for one thing he's present and when he's present jesus can look through the eyes of the father and he can see there's a bigger picture here you just see her sin and the law says to deal with her sin but if you deal with that law without the person without who they really are you're going to deal with that law the wrong way how many message things do we have where it's all the law but that's missing the person and missing relationship has everybody understood what i said today they had every right to stone that woman except for the fact he was there and he was looking through the eyes of the father and he looked at the big picture he says the way i'll deal with this is i'll write down possibly their sins that's probably what he was doing and each one dropped their stones and began to run off he said where's your accusers they're gone then i'm not going to accuse you go and sin no more he didn't say continue in your lifestyle i'm changing you change your goal and sin no more i don't condemn you either and the only way he could do that is he could see that she was in the loins of the father she was a daughter of god lord jesus could you help somebody see this today lord [Music] could you help open someone's eyes lord the only way that i could say these things is because i know you're present lord your person is here your presence is here could you open their eyes lord that they could see you love us lord beyond any father on earth or mother on earth could ever love us you brought back to us holy ghost relationship again that we could be restored back to you [Music] may that brother or sister or that woman that man or that young person may their eyes be opened today lord and may they find that place to say i want to talk with you i want to fellowship with you i want to receive you i want to be in you and you living in me i wanted father no man can put that desire there but you put it you put the desire i have felt this week lord and i'll just speak this to you in front of the people i have felt there are times when the pressure is so great and so many different fronts that satan is fighting i feel so overwhelmed there are times the only thing that i can go back to is the desire for you laying in my heart [Music] i can't figure out everything i can't figure out all situations i feel i have a lack of wisdom in some situations how to handle it but when i feel overwhelmed i know you put a desire within me to love you and to keep seeking after you and because you put it there no man can take it out i feel sometimes defeated i feel inadequate i feel i've disappointed you [Music] and i'm sorry for that lord but there's no man that can change the desire you put there when i was 16 years old something happened to me and i can never lose this desire [Music] and i know that most if not all the people that i'm preaching to here and online it's the same thing their lives get they get clouded with stuff but there's no question they keep coming to the fountain and drinking they keep desiring something who put that desire there lord who put that desire had to be more than themselves lord you take the worst case of somebody with their walls up your love is more stronger than any walls that can be up love them to yourself i pray may they find this relationship lord that i'm preaching about may our families find deeper relationship when our parents and children may fathers be connected to their sons and fathers be connected to their daughters restore replenish rebuild your holy spirit i pray and while you're healing the sick and healing cancer oh thank you father while you're healing brother josh and jonah while you're healing ones that we pray for lord we ask you to heal those that are wounded in their spirit and pour the healing balm in their wounds may they be restored i pray that in the name of almighty god the lord jesus christ thank you father may we love deeper than we've ever loved may we loved as if we've never been hurt before may we never look at your rules and your commandments and your word or the message may we never look at it as something that was to hurt us but may we look at it as something that comes with your relationship lord and we stay with the word we know that your presence is close to us lord and we have access to you to come even when we make a mistake we can bring our mistakes to you i'd rather be in a household lord that had a father not just the rules and that way i can come say father i i messed up i broke i broke the rules i'm sorry father will you forgive me and to have a father say i forgive you let's try again i'd rather have a father in the house i'd rather have a mother in the house i'd rather have the person who set the rules i'd like to have access to them so i can share my heart with them thank you that you set it up this way lord [Music] only you can do the work of the holy spirit and you will do it so take our words and anoint them may they bring forth fruit i pray in the name of jesus christ amen i have a father i have a maker i have a [Music] yes before [Music] hallelujah [Music] he knows [Music] he sees each tear that falls [Music] and i have a farm he calls me his own [Music] leave me no matter where i go and he knows my name [Music] and he knows [Music] and he sees
