[0:00] Hello everyone. Pastor Paula Fontaine

[0:21] May God bless you, my friend. May the
[0:23] music and message encourage you today.
[0:26] On the cross
[0:29] hung my pain
[0:32] and the guilt
[0:35] and the shame.
[0:39] Jesus bore
[0:42] my suffering
[0:45] to the grave
[0:48] to make me free.
[0:52] Oh, the blood
[0:55] that was shed.
[0:58] &gt;&gt; It outflows
[1:01] to cover sin.
[1:05] It washes clean
[1:08] and purifies
[1:11] in its healing
[1:15] crimson tide. Jesus, he took my place in
[1:22] divine exchange.
[1:25] Hallelujah.
[1:27] Grace is mine.
[1:31] Now I will live by faith. For the one
[1:36] who saves, he gave all to give me life.
[1:44] Spirit is
[1:47] my present help.
[1:51] I'd be lost
[1:54] all by myself.
[1:57] He resurrects.
[2:00] He satisfies.
[2:03] He takes his power
[2:07] and makes it mine. Jesus, he took my
[2:12] place in divine
[2:15] exchange. Hallelujah.
[2:18] Your race is mine.
[2:23] Now I will live by faith. For the one
[2:28] who saves, he gave all to give me life.
[2:35] I lay down all lesser things
[2:39] for greater gain. He is alive
[2:44] inside
[2:46] of me.
[2:48] I lay down all lesser things
[2:52] for greater gain. He is alive
[2:57] inside
[2:59] of me.
[3:01] I lay down no less things
[3:05] for greater gain. He is alive
[3:10] inside
[3:12] of me.
[3:14] I lay down all the things
[3:18] for greater things. He is alive.
[3:27] Jesus took my place in divine
[3:32] exchange. Hallelujah.
[3:38] [Music]
[3:46] [Music]
[3:48] to give me life.
[3:52] Jesus
[3:55] Christ
[3:58] [Music]
[4:02] is mine.
[4:05] Now I will live by faith for the one who
[4:10] saves. He gave all to give me life.
[4:16] I lay down all lesser things
[4:21] for greater gain. He is alive
[4:25] inside
[4:27] of me.
[4:29] I lay down all lesser things
[4:33] for greater gain. He is alive.
[4:42] &gt;&gt; Psalms 149. Praise ye the Lord. Sing
[4:46] unto the Lord a new song and his praise
[4:48] in the congregation of the saints. Let
[4:51] Israel rejoice in him that made him. Let
[4:54] the children of Zion be joyful in their
[4:57] king. Let them praise his name in the
[4:59] dance. Let them sing praises unto him
[5:03] with the timberal and harp. For the Lord
[5:06] taketh pleasure in his people.
[5:09] He will beautify the meek with
[5:11] salvation. Let the saints be joyful in
[5:14] glory. Let them sing aloud upon their
[5:18] beds. This type of praise is not just
[5:20] when you're in church. Amen.
[5:23] &gt;&gt; This type of praise is not just when
[5:25] you're around the saints and showing
[5:27] off. This is even on the beds. It's at
[5:30] home. It's at work.
[5:32] &gt;&gt; This is a continual praise.
[5:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:35] &gt;&gt; Let the high praises of God be in their
[5:39] mouth and a two-edged sword in their
[5:42] hand.
[5:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:44] &gt;&gt; To execute vengeance upon the heathen
[5:46] and punishments upon the people. to bind
[5:49] their kings with chains and their nobles
[5:51] with feathers of iron to execute upon
[5:54] them the judgment written. This honor
[5:58] have all his saints. Praise ye the Lord.
[6:02] I'd like you to pay attention this
[6:04] morning to David's writings. And there's
[6:06] so many songs and so many truths in
[6:08] David's uh words in the Psalms. And
[6:11] David is particularly special to me. I
[6:13] identify with him very much in the
[6:15] scripture and his life. But David here
[6:18] at the very end of his writings, we find
[6:21] he speaks of the people of God and he
[6:24] speaks of a people who God is drawing
[6:28] great pleasure from their worship. And
[6:30] so when we look at this scripture, I
[6:32] wanted to just minister on it a little
[6:34] bit because a couple things in there
[6:36] with that we see is God is taking
[6:39] pleasure in this type of worship. And
[6:42] it's not just that he's taking pleasure
[6:44] in us, but we're taking pleasure in him.
[6:48] And when we start talking about that, we
[6:50] start talking about a a wonderful
[6:52] worship, a worship that comes to a high
[6:55] pinnacle. And that is when God is
[6:57] pleased with the worship. And when the
[7:00] and he draws pleasure from the worship
[7:02] and that we draw pleasure in worshiping
[7:05] him.
[7:06] And so uh what what this is coming from
[7:09] is is I just want to present it this way
[7:12] is that this this praise has has reached
[7:16] actually a higher level. It's not just
[7:18] called praise upon their lips. It's
[7:21] called the high praises of God. I don't
[7:24] know if you ever noticed high praises.
[7:26] And this is the only place in the
[7:29] scripture where high high praises is
[7:32] mentioned. the only place in the
[7:34] scripture we always have praise and we
[7:36] have that word mentioned many places but
[7:38] this people at this time that David is
[7:41] pointing to that they they h they they
[7:43] have a distinction about them and I
[7:46] can't help but think that this is the
[7:47] bride of the last days because they are
[7:51] really the people that have the
[7:52] two-edged sword in their hand
[7:58] &gt;&gt; but I want to preach to you it's not
[7:59] just that that we have the two-edged
[8:01] sword in our hand but we have the high
[8:03] praises of God upon our lips.
[8:07] &gt;&gt; And this is a people that he's pointing
[8:08] to that it's the high praises and it's
[8:11] it's it's on their lips. And I I'm going
[8:13] to venture to say this is a prophecy of
[8:15] the people of the very end. After 6,000
[8:18] years, there will be a people arise that
[8:21] will reach the apex of all things that
[8:23] God would be so pleased with their
[8:26] worship. And you remember, worship isn't
[8:28] just singing or lifting your hands or
[8:30] clapping. Worship is our life before
[8:32] God. Worship is our offering to God.
[8:35] Worship is who you are, even when you're
[8:37] by yourself.
[8:39] And so, just look at it that way this
[8:41] morning. It's more than just what we're
[8:43] doing this weekend. And it it comes from
[8:44] a life that is poured out before God, a
[8:47] sanctified life. And after 6,000 years,
[8:51] I believe this is speaking of the bride
[8:52] because we'll reach the apex of all
[8:54] things. God will restore his word. God
[8:57] will give that book of redemption back
[8:59] to his people again. Everything climaxes
[9:02] at the end time. But all of that is to
[9:04] produce a people that have come to the
[9:07] apex of what real worship is all about.
[9:13] &gt;&gt; And uh the David brings it. It just
[9:16] seemed to strike the right thing in the
[9:18] heart of God and it moves the heart of
[9:20] God and it it it strikes the right thing
[9:23] with no elements missing. And I want you
[9:25] to hold on to that worship with no
[9:27] elements missing because in a moment
[9:29] I'll speak of uh times in the Bible when
[9:32] there was worship going on even to
[9:35] Jehovah God. But it had missing elements
[9:38] to it.
[9:40] And and God does not take pleasure when
[9:43] worship is missing elements to it.
[9:47] &gt;&gt; He's looking to a people and he's
[9:48] creating a people to come to true
[9:50] worship. How many remember what Jesus
[9:53] said to the woman at the well and and
[9:55] and she was confused about worship and
[9:57] he prophesied. He said to this woman at
[9:59] the well, this harlot, he said, "The the
[10:02] hour is coming and now is that the true
[10:05] worshippers will come and worship in
[10:08] both spirit and in truth." He's talking
[10:10] about our day. In other words, they
[10:12] won't just have they don't just have the
[10:14] spirit and lacking truth.
[10:17] &gt;&gt; Nothing will be lacking. And they won't
[10:20] just have truth without the spirit. But
[10:23] when they come with the full truth and
[10:26] spirit, then they become the true
[10:28] worshippers of God.
[10:31] &gt;&gt; God brings this thing to a head.
[10:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So this is a people
[10:37] that's reached the highest form of
[10:38] worship, the highest level that you come
[10:41] to. And this is a people with the
[10:42] two-edged sword in their hand and the
[10:45] high praises of God upon their lips.
[10:48] They have the king's sword in the end
[10:50] time. And I want to say that the king's
[10:52] sword is not just books and tapes and
[10:56] Bibles. It's so much more than that.
[11:00] &gt;&gt; The king's sword, the word is so much
[11:02] more than books and tapes.
[11:06] &gt;&gt; It's so much more than just our Bibles.
[11:09] Because why? The sword is to be put in
[11:12] the hand. The word is not meant to be
[11:14] just something on your phone, your Bible
[11:15] on your phone. It's meant to be so much
[11:18] more than that. Where does it belong? It
[11:20] belongs in the hand of the believer. And
[11:22] I believe this bride holding it, she
[11:25] knows by character. It's not meant to
[11:27] use on one another.
[11:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:33] At least she should know that
[11:36] it's meant to use on the devil. Can you
[11:38] say amen?
[11:39] &gt;&gt; And this bride is going to take it and
[11:41] she's going to go for the juggler.
[11:43] There's some young girl that's going to
[11:45] pierce through the spirit of immodesty
[11:48] of this generation and she's going to
[11:50] take that sword in her hand and she's
[11:52] going to cut through that spirit of
[11:53] immodesty.
[11:56] There's some young men that are probably
[11:57] sitting here that's going to take that
[11:59] word and it's not just books and tapes
[12:01] to them. They're going to put it in
[12:02] their hand and they're going to drive it
[12:04] and cut that demon of pornography. Cut
[12:07] that demon of lust.
[12:10] Amen.
[12:12] &gt;&gt; A people will have it in their hand and
[12:14] take it to the root of bitterness in
[12:16] their life.
[12:18] &gt;&gt; Can I get an amen?
[12:20] &gt;&gt; People are going to when they have it in
[12:22] their hand, he says they take it to the
[12:23] heart of their many enemy, they're going
[12:25] to take it to the core of something and
[12:27] take it to a root of bitterness in your
[12:28] life and cut that out
[12:31] &gt;&gt; using the word that he has sent to do
[12:32] that. Hey, maybe they're going to take
[12:34] it and drive it to the heart of pride in
[12:37] your life and cut that pride out of your
[12:39] life.
[12:40] &gt;&gt; I, as I go along, I may have less amens,
[12:43] and I'm prepared for that.
[12:47] &gt;&gt; This is not just books and tapes and
[12:49] Bibles. It was in the hands of the
[12:51] people. And I believe in the end time,
[12:53] it's going to be more than on our heads.
[12:55] It's going to be in our hand. And we're
[12:57] going to take it to the heart of the
[12:58] enemy. Maybe it'll cut the pride out.
[13:01] The pride that says I'm better than
[13:02] everybody else. The pride that says this
[13:05] church is better than all the other
[13:06] churches. May God take the word and cut
[13:09] that out of our life. There is no
[13:11] perfect church.
[13:15] This isn't a perfect church and your
[13:17] church is not a perfect church. And if
[13:19] you've got that pride to lift up some
[13:21] church or some minister, may that word
[13:23] is for this to take in your hand and cut
[13:26] that pride out of your life.
[13:30] Praise the Lord.
[13:32] &gt;&gt; Cut the pride out. Use that sword to cut
[13:34] Hollywood trash out of your life.
[13:38] &gt;&gt; To cut those clips out that you're
[13:40] flipping through that glorify sexual
[13:42] perversion.
[13:44] &gt;&gt; That's what this word was sent for.
[13:46] &gt;&gt; It's not just to play around with it and
[13:48] sing about in church. It's to take into
[13:50] your hand and cut those things out of
[13:52] your life.
[13:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[13:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:58] We need to know understand why the Lord
[14:00] has given us this word. So they have a
[14:02] sword in their hand but they have high
[14:04] praises upon their mouth. So I don't
[14:06] want to leave that part out. This is the
[14:08] people of the end time. They have the
[14:10] sword in their hand but they have the
[14:12] high praises in their mouth. They have
[14:14] been taught to bring their mouth under
[14:17] God
[14:20] &gt;&gt; causing them to say the right thing.
[14:24] Let's talk about worship that is missing
[14:26] elements to it throughout the Bible. And
[14:28] I have no have no time to go through
[14:30] every incident. I just want to say since
[14:32] the fall in the garden, we seen the
[14:35] effects of the fall.
[14:37] &gt;&gt; Man and the the and created in the image
[14:40] of God. He fell. When the woman fell,
[14:42] they fell together. And there were so
[14:45] many effects of that fall. He lost his
[14:47] oneness. He lost everything. He lost his
[14:49] title deed to the earth. He lost his
[14:51] power. But one thing that we've seen in
[14:55] the offspring
[14:56] is from the false union that union that
[14:58] took place with Eve and the serpent. One
[15:01] thing that we've seen that kind of
[15:02] surprises us from the offspring of the
[15:05] fall. And what we've seen come from the
[15:07] offspring is worship.
[15:12] &gt;&gt; Think about it. Now, and to me, I would
[15:14] never expect that from from sin and the
[15:19] fall and and and and and all of a sudden
[15:21] now everything's messed up and man's
[15:23] lost his place and and and now he's born
[15:26] with a serpent nature and he doesn't
[15:28] have a he doesn't have he has a soul,
[15:30] but he has a serpent nature to
[15:31] automatically gravitate to the things of
[15:33] the world. And so, he's all messed up in
[15:35] sin. And yet, and yet Cain himself, it's
[15:39] worship. Well, number one reason is he
[15:42] has a soul. And when man man has a soul,
[15:45] no matter how far they are from God,
[15:47] they'll have a craving for God to
[15:48] worship God.
[15:50] &gt;&gt; True.
[15:51] &gt;&gt; And Cain had that as well.
[15:54] &gt;&gt; But here's another reason why worship
[15:56] was there right away. It's because the
[15:58] one who caused all this fall, and I'm
[16:00] going to expose him this morning just a
[16:02] little bit. Lucifer anointed the serpent
[16:06] to cause this fall. And Lucifer knew
[16:10] very much about worship. And matter of
[16:12] fact, he was probably more knowledgeable
[16:14] about what worship was around the throne
[16:16] of God
[16:18] &gt;&gt; than anybody on earth, any angel,
[16:20] anyone. Lucifer, chief angel, chief
[16:23] musician,
[16:25] &gt;&gt; right there at the right hand of God
[16:27] around all of the perfect worship of
[16:29] God. He was knowledgeable about worship.
[16:33] And so I'm wondering that's why now
[16:35] Cain, he anoints him. And now Cain, he's
[16:37] going to bring worship. You think, "Oh,
[16:39] he's a dastasterly fella. Just loves the
[16:41] things of the world. What's he want to
[16:43] worship for? He's just to go out and
[16:44] just do all kinds of things in the
[16:45] world." No, no, it's worship. The third
[16:47] first thing he brings is worship.
[16:50] &gt;&gt; This is very hard for people to admit
[16:55] it was worship.
[16:58] It was worship
[17:00] be but it was missing
[17:04] elements to it.
[17:07] Now we say, "Well, he's worshiping God.
[17:09] I mean, come on. He's worshiping Jehovah
[17:12] God. He's bringing an offering. He's
[17:13] doing that." So, our tendency would be
[17:16] surely God is loving enough to accept
[17:18] that offering,
[17:20] &gt;&gt; to accept that worship. I'm here to be
[17:22] real clear now.
[17:23] &gt;&gt; We're reaching for the worship that God
[17:26] takes pleasure in.
[17:29] Not a lower form of worship, not a
[17:32] worship that's tainted, and not a
[17:34] worship that's missing elements. Well,
[17:36] what was Cain's worship missing? It was
[17:38] without revelation.
[17:43] &gt;&gt; It was worship without a cleansed soul,
[17:47] &gt;&gt; a redeemed soul.
[17:49] That's a pretty huge element missing in
[17:51] your worship. It was worship without the
[17:54] holiness of God. It was worship without
[17:57] relationship with God. It was worship
[17:59] without oneness with God. It was worship
[18:02] with no fellowship with God. And yet it
[18:04] was all worship. And Cain's worship was
[18:07] worship to Jehovah. But it brought what
[18:09] it wanted to bring to the Lord. It was
[18:12] worship without blood.
[18:14] &gt;&gt; Somebody ought to say, "Praise the Lord
[18:16] this morning." I'm speaking the truth to
[18:17] you. That worship that's missing
[18:20] essential elements.
[18:22] &gt;&gt; God is not pleasur. But there's a people
[18:24] coming with all the elements.
[18:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[18:29] Nothing missing.
[18:31] &gt;&gt; Blood, revelation.
[18:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:35] &gt;&gt; A redeemed soul.
[18:38] &gt;&gt; Standing there with the book of
[18:39] redemption
[18:40] &gt;&gt; and their identity revealed to them.
[18:43] &gt;&gt; That's why Revelations 5, I read it last
[18:45] night. That's why they, as David says
[18:48] here, they'll sing a new song. It says
[18:50] that in Revelations 5 when the he takes
[18:52] the book they'll sing a new song.
[18:56] &gt;&gt; He hath made us kings and priests. That
[18:58] book of redemption revealed their true
[19:00] identity and it made them something.
[19:04] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Praise the Lord."
[19:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[19:07] &gt;&gt; Cain worship was worship to Jehovah, but
[19:09] it brought what it wanted to bring. It
[19:11] was without blood. It was without
[19:12] sacrifice. It was without atonement to
[19:14] purge sins. It had great fruits to it,
[19:17] but it offered no sacrificed life with
[19:19] it.
[19:22] God is not interested in cane worship
[19:24] even today.
[19:26] &gt;&gt; The music can be perfectly right, but
[19:29] God is not interested in cane worship.
[19:34] &gt;&gt; And I can safely say we have a lot of at
[19:36] the climax, we have a lot of cane
[19:39] worship today.
[19:41] &gt;&gt; But that's not my desire. I'm not called
[19:44] to cane worship. I'm called to worship
[19:46] at its highest level with all the
[19:49] elements there.
[19:52] &gt;&gt; These elements were missing in Cain. And
[19:54] I'd say they're essential elements, but
[19:56] from time on, from that time on when it
[19:58] was worship, but missing something, God
[20:00] never took pleasure in it. I wouldn't go
[20:01] so far as to say he rejects a sincere
[20:03] heart. Please understand, God doesn't
[20:06] just reject sincere hearts. And if
[20:08] they're offering what they can offer,
[20:09] that's fine. But he withdraws himself
[20:11] from worship that's missing certain
[20:13] elements. In fact, in some cases, he
[20:15] rejects it if it's missing certain
[20:17] elements. There are places in the
[20:19] scripture that show this and I don't
[20:20] have the time to cover them, but there
[20:22] are lower forms of worship even to
[20:24] Jehovah. There were times when God's
[20:26] people mixed their worship with the ways
[20:28] of the heathen. But you see now there
[20:30] were times when they would mix their
[20:32] worship with the heathen. They borrowed
[20:33] too much from the heathen and it lost
[20:36] its purity. It lost its originality.
[20:39] It lost its puress to us and we should
[20:42] be very careful today to not try to get
[20:45] a direct copy of what other churches are
[20:49] doing.
[20:52] &gt;&gt; I encourage you that that our agenda and
[20:55] our goal is not to copy what the other
[20:58] churches are doing, to try to copy
[21:00] what's going on out there. Can you say
[21:02] amen?
[21:03] &gt;&gt; But to get it original from God. Can you
[21:05] say amen? I don't remember David having
[21:08] any influences when he was on the back
[21:10] side of the desert and he became a
[21:11] musician and a songwriter and got a hold
[21:13] of God. He did all that by himself on
[21:16] the back side of the desert. He received
[21:18] his inspiration directly from God.
[21:21] &gt;&gt; And when he come out of that, he was
[21:23] ready to face Goliath.
[21:25] &gt;&gt; He had an anointing to face Goliath.
[21:27] &gt;&gt; He had the right anointing. He had the
[21:29] right songs. He had the right faith.
[21:33] &gt;&gt; He learned how to be a worshshiper.
[21:36] Amen. That's right.
[21:37] &gt;&gt; You young people, you you you have a lot
[21:39] of alone time because you're not married
[21:41] yet. You ought to you ought to be on the
[21:43] back side of the desert. Say, "God, give
[21:45] me your inspiration. Build my faith.
[21:49] Make me a worshipper, a true
[21:50] worshipper."
[21:52] &gt;&gt; Because guess what, young people? You're
[21:53] going to face Goliath someday. And you
[21:55] need to have God preparing you to get
[21:57] ready for your Goliath. I'm 59 years
[22:00] old. I face some Goliaths. You're going
[22:02] to face Goliath. And you need the faith
[22:04] that David had to go with boldness.
[22:10] &gt;&gt; Lord, make me a true worshipper now.
[22:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God loves the beauty of
[22:15] holiness behind the person that's
[22:17] worshiping. He does not. It does not
[22:18] bring God pleasure when there's a secret
[22:21] life of sin behind it all. You may be
[22:24] the best musician, and I tell you
[22:25] because I love you. You may be very good
[22:27] at it and getting better at it, but God
[22:29] does not pl take pleasure in gifts or or
[22:33] uh talents when there's a life of sin
[22:36] secretly being hid behind it. Throughout
[22:39] the Bible, it wasn't worship God was
[22:42] looking for.
[22:44] There's a reference in Isaiah 66 at the
[22:46] beginning. He says, "Your sacrifices
[22:47] have become uh your elations is is like
[22:51] swine's blood." So now we have a place
[22:55] that's bringing sacrifices, the people
[22:57] of God, and it's the right sacrifices,
[23:00] but it wasn't giving God pleasure. And
[23:01] he goes on later on in the chapter, he
[23:03] says, "To this man while I look, to him
[23:05] that's poor, humble, and of a contrite
[23:07] spirit. To this man while I look." So
[23:09] they were bringing the right sacrifices,
[23:12] but without a humble, broken spirit. And
[23:14] God was not pleased.
[23:18] &gt;&gt; So it's it's sobering. And it's very
[23:20] sobering to realize this has been
[23:22] happening throughout the Bible. And then
[23:23] Paul brings up in the New Testament. He
[23:26] brings up you can give your body to be
[23:28] burned. You can understand all the
[23:31] mysteries.
[23:32] Anybody know where I'm going? First
[23:34] Corinthians 13. It's in the New
[23:35] Testament, too. You can bring all this.
[23:37] You can understand all the mysteries.
[23:39] Give your body to be burned. You can
[23:41] speak in tongues.
[23:46] But if it's missing the element of Holy
[23:48] Ghost love,
[23:50] &gt;&gt; he says it's as a sounding brass and a
[23:53] tinkling symbol.
[23:55] &gt;&gt; That means it's just noise to God. It
[23:58] doesn't give him pleasure. He doesn't
[24:01] take pleasure because you have all the
[24:03] speaking in tongues, all that. But if
[24:05] you're missing Holy Ghost love, you're
[24:07] missing the key element.
[24:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:09] &gt;&gt; There are a few times that in the Bible
[24:11] the worship just hit just right. It
[24:13] wouldn't be like the our days when he's
[24:15] it's going to hit perfectly right. But
[24:17] it hit just right. And when it did, the
[24:19] worship struck the right thing and the
[24:22] right thing was there and the right
[24:23] elements were there. And when it hit
[24:26] just right, things would happen.
[24:28] Solomon's temple is a great example of
[24:31] that.
[24:32] There must have been all the elements
[24:34] there of dedication, of rededication, of
[24:38] pure hearts
[24:40] &gt;&gt; because when they struck that, and
[24:42] incidentally friends, there was hundreds
[24:43] of worshippers, there was hundreds of
[24:45] musicians, there was 120 trumpets.
[24:49] &gt;&gt; I don't think they were quiet trumpets.
[24:50] I think they were loud.
[24:52] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen.
[24:54] &gt;&gt; And and and this was a hu I wish I'd
[24:56] have been there, but to be honest with
[24:58] you, I'd rather be here in the service
[25:00] this morning rather than in Solomon's
[25:02] day because God said he said the glory
[25:05] of that temple won't even compare with
[25:08] the glory that's in the temples of the
[25:10] end times.
[25:14] I'm glad to be here this morning cuz I
[25:16] believe I'm not a part of a movement,
[25:18] but I'm part of what God's doing
[25:20] &gt;&gt; to bring true worshippers.
[25:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. that he breathes it in
[25:26] &gt;&gt; and it's a sweet smelling savor to him.
[25:28] I take pleasure in my people.
[25:31] &gt;&gt; May God take pleasure in my worship.
[25:34] &gt;&gt; May he be pleased with my worship.
[25:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:37] &gt;&gt; May he be pleased with the way I play
[25:39] the guitar. May he be pleased with I way
[25:42] I play my piano.
[25:45] &gt;&gt; How I use my voice.
[25:47] &gt;&gt; May he be pleased with it. Amen.
[25:50] &gt;&gt; That place that place began to just
[25:53] there was such something struck it just
[25:55] right and God just come down into that
[25:58] temple and swept in there with his
[26:00] glory.
[26:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:03] &gt;&gt; Sometimes, you know, I I think it gets
[26:06] quiet sometimes when that type of glory
[26:08] comes cuz nobody can really say
[26:10] anything. But their worship and their
[26:12] instruments and everything congealed in
[26:14] oneness and harmony and it just pleased
[26:17] God and he swept through that whole
[26:19] place with his glory. But the
[26:21] interesting thing about David, most of
[26:24] what comes out in all of his trials, he
[26:26] always ends up with a victory and a
[26:28] positive confession. He always ends up
[26:30] with a praise upon his lips. Praise to
[26:33] his God. How can the guy who sinned
[26:36] again with Basheba went through so many
[26:38] trials the enemies against me? He was
[26:40] reproached. People were talking against
[26:43] him. How can a guy go through all of
[26:45] that and he ends up with the praises of
[26:48] God on his lips?
[26:50] &gt;&gt; He ends up being the great writer that
[26:52] wrote about the praise of God more than
[26:54] anybody. It's not just when he felt like
[26:56] it. You know, David, he didn't praise
[26:58] God just when he felt like it. He
[27:00] ordered his mouth to make praise a
[27:03] continual thing.
[27:06] Here's some scriptures. I will bless the
[27:09] Lord at all times. His praise shall
[27:12] continually be in my mouth.
[27:15] Re from the rising of the sun to the
[27:18] setting of the same. The name of the
[27:20] Lord shall be praised.
[27:23] &gt;&gt; Rejoice in the Lord always. And again, I
[27:26] say rejoice. Somebody ought to praise us
[27:28] with the Lord one this morning.
[27:30] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 13:15,
[27:32] I'll bring the sacrifice of praise
[27:35] continually.
[27:36] when you're in a trial. That's why it's
[27:38] called the sacrifice of praise. It's not
[27:41] so much here when you bring the
[27:42] sacrifices. It's easy when everybody's
[27:44] around to praise unless you come in with
[27:46] the doll drums and you've lost your job
[27:48] or something like that. But I want to
[27:49] tell you, David learned that's when God
[27:52] wants to hear you sing. He wants you to
[27:55] come to church.
[27:56] &gt;&gt; And you've lost a loved one and you've
[27:58] had the greatest trial of your life and
[28:00] then all of a sudden this worshiper rise
[28:02] and said, "I will worship my God."
