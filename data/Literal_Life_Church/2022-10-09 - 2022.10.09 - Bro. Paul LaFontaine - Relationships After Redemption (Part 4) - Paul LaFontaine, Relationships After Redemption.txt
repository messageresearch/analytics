========================================

War here today and we're going to read from John chapter 7 and just two verses John chapter 7 verse 37 and 38. it says in the Bible in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water so the first verse is God's call to the Thirsty in the last time in the last day of the feast and the second is the answer to that thirst and that is out of a believer's innermost being shall flow rivers of Living Water and the rivers coming from us will be the answer to The Thirst in people in the last days Heavenly Father blessed and anoint your servant today Lord we stand always expecting for you to do above and beyond what we could ask or think we just feel your special your a special anointing here today a special spirit and Lord not all the time is it jumping and shouting and screaming sometimes Lord we're so inspired we do that but there's sometimes it's just quiet and Lord but you're ever so near us your presence is ever so close and we love you today we thank you for Henry's song that is our heart today to tell you you can have all this world Just Give Me Jesus Just Give Me Jesus it's all we want Lord that's all that counts thank you Father for this lovely group of people and I pray you'll love them closer to you today through the word in Jesus name amen amen once you shake somebody's hand again and greet them in the name of the Lord God bless you each one foreign Jesus is standing here in John chapter 7. attending the last feast and there were seven feasts to Israel and he attended all of them and he was attending because that's what the law had said to do to attend these things and he's standing at the very last Feast attending which would be the last Feast which would be the Feast of Tabernacles and in the very last day of the last Feast he cries out with a loud voice I don't know who was standing there but he cries out in the last piece If any man thirsts that's his words if any man thirst let him come to me and drink and so if any man thirst let him come and so now it is we must acknowledge first that it is the last day of the feast it's the last day and he makes an appeal to the Thirsty and this is where we are at in Prophecy today because we are uh we have come through a spiritual uh manifestation of the seven feasts there was a literal seven feasts and we don't attend those today but there is a spiritual fulfillment of each Feast that Jesus did back there in the Old Testament it gave in the Old Testament there's a spiritual fulfillment to those feasts and we're living out those the Feast of Passover which is Christ going to Calvary uh the all the different feasts we've lived out and when we come to the last one which is the Feast of Tabernacles if you study it out in time that's where we're at right now we're coming into the Feast of Tabernacles and so this is so significant when he says these words in the last day of the last Feast he makes an appeal to the Thirsty and this is where we're at in Prophecy right now we're in the last we're in the end we're in the last call as it was and this is confirmed I didn't read the scripture to you but I would read it to you now if you still have your Bibles or they can pull it up if you just read in Revelations the very last scriptures in Revelations 22 it's it says in verse 17 and we're we're talking the very last uh five verses but it says the last of the Bible here Revelations 22 and verse 17 and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the Water of Life freely so now we have the last the very last call at the very last of the Bible saying the same thing that he said in the last feast and that is he that is thirsty it's a call for him that is thirsty and and in this case so it's confirmed a second time here that in the last few verses of the Bible there's a call to the Thirsty and it's strange that this word is used for the end and yet it is not strange if you look and see how people are acting today and when I say that you know we can look at how they're acting we can look at their attributes we can look at our attributes we can look at the world and the condition that's in we can see a lot of different crazy things going on and yet yet if you have discernment you have to realize when you have all of these characteristics of such trouble you have to go back to the source of why the trouble is there and that is people are thirsty for a living God it's about thirst and it's about not filling that thirst with God can you say Amen it goes back to thirst and so now it may be strange to say this is an important thing at the very end that talking about if any man thirsts and yet it is not strange if we see people how they're acting they're Restless they're UNS they're not satisfied people are restless people are not satisfied all the pleasures all the things we have all the modern conveniences we have everything at our fingertips fingers we have everything that we've ever wanted and and there's new stuff coming out all the time and yet man is constantly restless and constantly not satisfied if they were satisfied they would quit seeking something further but they're always thinking something else and so that means they're thirsty or they're restless and they're dissatisfied because they're not fulfilled they're not satisfied The Thirst is not being fulfilled The Thirst and the Soul can you say Amen man has now man has always been thirsty for God but never as Extreme as the last days man has always been thirsty but never as extreme now and thus all the evil and all the problems in the middle of Satan's Eden can be summed up in one word and that's thirst because you wouldn't have those things if they were drinking from the right fountain event the answer for all the trouble and all the things could never be as simple as drinking from the right Fountain but it is just that simple can you say Amen now Christ would never make a call to the Thirsty unless he knew that there had been a fountain opened up in the House of David and the the prophecy says and I believe it's Zechariah 13 and verse 1. it says in that day it's a prophecy in that day there shall be a fountain open in the House of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness if you read the text I don't have time to talk about it in Zechariah 13 but you see when he prophesies and said there'll be a in that day there'll be a fountain open in the House of David for sin and for uncleanness it's coming right after a time of Israel when they're mourning they're seeing him and it says now it's actually a prophecy for Israel he said they will go into their houses and mourn for days because they begin to realize they killed their Messiah they'll see his pierced hands they'll see what they did and they were looking for the Messiah and they see they pierced them they rejected him they turned him away so this naturally will happen to Israel that they'll mourn for days constant mourning because we rejected our Messiah we rejected the Fountain of Life we had an opportunity opportunity for our sin and righteousness we chose legalism we chose the Pharisees instead of the fountain in the House of David he opened up and so we rejected him and now they're mourning for days and in the middle of that morning I'm paraphrasing because I don't have time to read the scripture right in the middle of it he's he says these words I will pour out Grace and supplication I will pour out Grace upon you people that are mourning he doesn't say yeah you rejected me you're finished he begins to pour out Grace upon them and pour out a Revival upon them and pour out and then his next words says in that day I'm going to open up a fountain in the House of David and if you'll come and drink if you'll just come and drink it it'll it'll bring Redemption to all of Israel it'll bring Revival how many want Revival in your life when he opens the House of David all you got to do is start drinking and you receive a Revival so that happens to Israel coming down the road as we leave as the bride in a Rapture it'll happen to Israel they'll have a Revival and it's because he'll open up a fountain in the House of David but I want to say that's just in the time of Israel mourning now but he'll open up a fountain and all they had to do was drink but what we do for the what he did for the Jews for Redemption he has I want to say this he has already done for us today he's already opened a fountain in the House of David for the bride he opened the healing Revival praise the Lord he opened the church ages to us this is the last days now he opened a healing Revival he opened the church ages to us he opened the seals to us in the last days anybody get a pattern here at the last days he's opening everything to us it was closed but he's opening things up for you he's opening up the seals he's opening up the church ages he said I'm not going to hold back anymore I'm opening everything to my people I'm opening up the healing that's how it started with a healing Revival I'm gushing forth a healing Revival to the people I'm opening the seals and when he opened the seals he actually by taking the seals off he opened the book of redemption as well in Revelations 5 it's closed in Revelations 10 it's opened for the last 70 years he has opened things for the bride but with it all I think the greatest thing he's opened is he's opened a pure fountain in the House of David for his people to drink I wouldn't stand preaching with all the issues going on in the world the spirits the issues that go on Among Us and in your lives I wouldn't even preach because I wouldn't believe there'd be hope in these kind of conditions except I know that there's a fountain that's been opened in the House of David and if you'll drink if you drink just simply drink it has all the answers in it somebody would say praise the Lord there's a fountain open in the House of David and so it's right on time because now is when the Thirsty can come when he opens the fountain now is when the Thirsty can come now the Call Comes he that is thirsty when the Fountain of David is open then the call goes out he that is thirsty come and drink we're not just another church here can you say Amen there's been a fountain open the last days of the House of David we're not another denominational Church we're not a just church that just teaches the Bible I thank God for all that but you see you can have the Bible but God has to open the fountain for sin and Uncle for cleansing can you say amount there has to be a fountain open to the people of God he breaks the seals he breaks all the spirit he said the spirit that was bound for almost 2 000 years by denominational Creeds has been loosed in the evening time by the evening time message loosed open to the people so we are not just another church here we preach because there's been a fountain open in the House of David something has been opened to us and that's why we can say and that's why the bride is at the end time it's the bride and the spirit who are saying come somebody say praise the Lord who is it at the end it's the bride and the spirit saying come now how does she say come unless she knows there's been a fountain open in the House of David you wouldn't want to draw people to come unless there's a fountain opened unless there's a place you don't want to bring people to church and say come because of Polo Fontaine I guarantee you that's not a good reason you don't want to bring people to come because I've got another church and we teach the Bible you want to get them to come because there's a fountain open at that church there's a fountain open in the last days and there isn't any problem there isn't any depression there isn't any sickness physical mental whatever it is there isn't anything too big for this Fountain to wash it all away you got to know that there's been a fountain open before you make the invitation to come oh God give us a people in this congregation if there's any precedence I want to set as a goal for this coming year I would love to have a people just catch that that they would begin to say more and more to people that they meet come we're not saying come enough divine we're too bogged down sometimes with our own problems but we forget the last call from the bride in the spirit is anybody who's thirsty come brother Bram says how do you know that you don't invite that little that little lady maybe she's a Prosper how do you know just a little invite to church wouldn't make her a daughter of God how do you know that if you don't catch anything else today catch a little instruction from the pastor this is my goal we need to say come more often oh but we're two hours away say come anyway somebody who's thirsty and they've got to go two hours to get a drink they're gonna come get a drink I drove three hours to a family the other day they drive one way one way three hours every Sunday One Way three hours one way three hours back I just said God bless you but I can tell you it's not about me it's about thirst nobody in their right mind does that when there's churches right on the corner but it's it's it's not about a church it's about are you thirsty and where are you getting a drink can you say amen I thank all the families that drive so far and all these different things and Hoops they have to drive jump through but listen praise the lord it's not about church it's about he's open a fountain in the House of David for those who are thirsty to come but let us say come let us say come see we can say it in our hearts but let's say come to people you're quiet but that's that's okay how often do you say come right it could be anybody we don't have a right to label anybody I go I go to an assembly and there's some really great things happening and God is really visiting us unless a lot of times oh I've got this and the doctor told me the other day I've got cancer would you come and be let our pastor let our elders would you come and let them anoint you and prayer would you come sometimes we'll say we'll pray for you and that's fine but would you come it's the word come come who's thirsty come man I got married I used I was raised in church and I'm a mess and God would never accept to me wait wait a minute no where'd you learn that no it is and I don't want to talk about all the details I just want you to come one time just come brother Jason Watkins told a guy about five years ago he found a guy struggling and he said I can't come there I can't do that and he was going on I don't live good enough I'm not dressed good enough I look like this and he's going on and on that's why I can't come that's why I come and brother Jason said can you just do one thing can you just come don't worry about the dress don't worry about all these other things don't worry about you're not perfect don't matter all the sin you're done can you do one thing can you just come Wednesday and Sunday can you just make an hour can you come he says I think I can do it he said that's all you need need to do right now you just need to come let God do the rest so I read both of these verses in 37 and 38 in John chapter 7 because it's not just that he makes the call to come but he then points to where the fountain will be and I want you to notice this now he didn't point to books and tapes he didn't point to a particular Church the next verse in the last day that great of the feast great deal that he's Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture had said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water where is this fountain at because it's it's not just making the call now but he points in the next verse and that's why I read it he points to where this Fountain will be and it won't be in a church it won't necessarily be in in these other things and we know God can speak to us through his word but the fountain the power the the refreshing the changing the washing of sin where is this great river flowing out of it's flowing out of the inner parts of a Believer who has believed this message where is it it's in you Jesus said it it's in you where is this river flowing it's flowing out of you if you have the Holy Ghost it's coming out of you and so whatever you need it's coming out of you whatever they need it's coming out of you let's not just Skip and say yes there's a fountain open the House of David it's at a church no no wait a minute wait a minute no no we want to get them to church why because there's a fountain flowing but listen it's really coming out of you and that goes directly with the last scriptures in the Bible who is it that's saying come the spirit and the bride say come in the last days why she knows a fountain has been opened and she knows it's flowing through her praise the Lord you might know there's the fountain opened but do you know that it's flowing through you I don't know if a lot of people know that flow through me Holy Spirit flow through me out of his innermost being rivers of Living Water will gush out from where from from tapes and books and an app on our phone it's out of us see I don't feel like that today brother Paul well I wish you'd get past your feelings about yourself I wish you'd quit looking at everybody else and quit looking at yourself and look at what's God deposited on the inside here and something flows out of us something flows out of this bride she knows a fountain has been opened and she knows it's flowing for her that's why she can be part of the spirit saying come if you're thirsty come now I just want to just switch here and take this a bit further a bit deeper this morning everybody agree with everything so far amen I want to take it a little bit further because I'm going to just call upon you to join me and listen to this uh this message thirst that brother Brandon preached if you would listen to that message I would appreciate it I'd like to give what I'm studying out of and where I get some things and I may quote out of it today just a bit but most of all for you to listen to it if you raise your hands I'll listen to thirst this week if you listen to that message because it's such a significant thing that needed that had to be spoken in this day for so many reasons God had to speak to us through his Messenger to speak on just one simple word thirst and it was the last days he had to talk about thirst and he had to talk about it for so many reasons that I can't name them all today but it was a critical time for these things to be said not just to show that we have natural god-given thirst that's what he used as a type we have a thirst for for food we hunger for food we have a thirst for water something to drink we we can't live unless we address those those natural needs we have natural thirst within us and so he said that but it was really to show that we not only have natural god-given thirsts we have spiritual thirst that God has given us they are within us they are thirsts that are within us and it was to show not just to show that but to show that when the fountain for our thirst is open Satan right away jumps in and perverts the waters to replace not God's Waters but he he perverts and presents us some other fountains to drink from to fill that Holy thirst that God gave us it's the last days where he says there's a perversion of these thirsts there's a perversion of these Waters to replace what we drink from and we begin drinking from those things and when we do we never reach the full satisfaction of life or the full potential even as a Believer we know the world their problem is they're not drinking from the right Fountain can you say Amen we know that's taken place and we know that they eat from perverted thirst but even Believers can hold back what they can get in God because they too sometimes buy into other replacement things to satisfy we all do it we all do it and never reaching the full satisfaction in Life or full potential as a believer just know it will always it always will come it always will come to let me just say it this way my sermons uh although this is the part you might not like but my sermons always come to a certain place in my sermon and it's a place of pointing out the evils and traps that are in front of you as a Believer robbing you of spiritual victory I get specific I bring it down that's why some of my services will be shouting at the beginning and we'll all be sober at the end because it's just my way I'm going to bring it down where the rubber meets the road this thing of the Bride speaking and she's saying come and it's such a blessing that's in us the rivers of water I believe all of that but we have to talk about what it is that holds up the fountain yourself and the perverted Waters that we drink from that keep us from Full satisfaction in Christ and satisfaction in Who We Are we're to be a people that's at total rest and confidence in who we are and how God made us and we're completely satisfied can you it's like after a meal and you haven't ate for a while and you have a real good meal and you you feel totally satisfied and peaceful can you say Amen your body has come to a rest because you satisfied a craving to eat and you just feel that spiritually speaking you have to feed yourself you have to drink from the Waters of life and it can't be every Sunday it can't be every camp meeting it can't be just every other day you have to stay drinking from this Fountain and you stay satisfied I'm not Restless I'm not up and down can you say Amen so I have to point out brother REM says the one of the reasons for the message is to point out the evils of the day so that's the message too it's not just the Seven Seals that actually points out the evils of today but the message is to point out the evils of today so I want to because of this I want to talk about thirst why because thirst is related to relationships in our life thirst and longing and neediness is related to relationships in our lives because when we enter into relationships or we have relationships if there's somebody on one side that has a thirst and they have a need and that need is not being met then there's going to be trouble in the relationship because it's it's not about the fights that you have or the tensions that you have many times it's there's a thirst deep within somebody that's not being met and so we're being critical of the outside and the arguments and this person's terrible to live with and they've done this and they've done that and you've got a whole history that you can see of all kinds of family trouble or this particular person we don't have a good relationship but at the end of the day most things is because somebody never got satisfied in their thirst for God there's a thirst something Beyond just the trouble they cause they're thirsty for something how many's ever heard that isn't isn't that a cry for help somebody's doing all this crazy stuff isn't that a cry for help there's some truth to that there's a cry but what's in our society nobody ever addresses the cry for help nobody addresses The Thirst so how can we have good relationships unless we're willing to look at the love of God and what it does not just to correct temporary corrective situation in a relationship but we how can we approach it right unless we look at The Thirst what's that person thirsty for are they being satisfied in God and I'm going to get to it today are we doing our part to let the flow of this Divine love the flow of it get to that person and not hold it back even when it's not being received back we don't have a right to shut off the faucet of divine love because God doesn't have a faucet God doesn't have a thing he shuts it off he never shuts it off it's there flowing for anybody who wants to drink of it and if that's flowing through us we don't have a right to shut it off to some people and then turn it on to other people I'll give you more of the love of Christ because of this because of that but this person I'm just going to wing back here a little bit we don't have a right to do that mom and when we shut it off we shut it off for the real need of the person how many you want to raise your hand and say I want to find the real need of the person I want to find my real need because the surface stuff going on the carnal stuff we've had churches for 2 000 years try to address the outside of a person we have pockets in the message that's taken this message to just address the outside of a person get them dressed right get them acting right get them acting like a Christian my question is did they ever come to the Fountain to meet the need that's on the inside because if you're not addressing the craving I need love I need I need the love of Christ I need a craving if we ignore that and jump to the outside stuff we're ignoring the most important part all of us have cravings all of us have needs can you say Amen in most situations sitting even in this room in your family life a lot of those needs were not met in your family a lot of those needs weren't met in your family and that's why today at a young age even the best thing to do is cling and find this Fountain because there's no guarantee that you're going to get all the love that you needed from your father there's no gear I can't guarantee you that there'd even be reconciliation made with family situations that hurt you so bad and you never got your needs met as a child I can't guarantee that but I can guarantee there's a fountain open in the House of David for every thirst that you're needy of so when we're young we should seek it with all our heart because you can't make a guarantee relationships will always be right with churches with one another with people your spouse may even hurt you someday and you've got to be confident and satisfied that your thirst and needs are first being met in the Lord first there's a satisfaction I love to marry people that are completely satisfied in their walk with the Lord and they're not marrying that person as a dependent to be dependent on their spirituality but they're complete if God asks them to be single the rest of their life they're perfectly satisfied to serve the Lord I told somebody one of my kids out the other day I said 27 years old I was saying Lord how come I'm not married yet my sister Sharon she gets to get me married at 18. I didn't get to you Mary Lord what's this is not this is not fair I'm a good guy and I got bitter for two years I get bitter towards the Lord because I had a I had a craving which is a natural craving to be married have a companion but my mistake was getting bitter towards God about it this is unprepared my mistake was being bitter towards God for two years I was just upset quietly I never said it over the pulpit and I said I don't understand she heard Henry get married at Young ages I'm the firstborn I should get to get married first Lord there's a secession here there's a there's an order isn't there bringing up all these things Lord so I got bitter I said Lord you know I'm getting old here I'm 26 years old I thought that was old back then what what a dummy and and I'm telling you and so then when I realized my bitterness I had to bring it to the altar of God and I had to be willing to say Lord if you should choose like Paul in the Bible if you should choose that I would serve the rest of my life without a mate I want to I'm going to say this and only God knows if you mean it from your heart I am ready and prepared to serve the Lord the rest of my life as a single good and when God knows you you mean it because I had to become completely satisfied there are marriages that get married because they're craving a bunch of stuff and some of that stuff should get fulfilled in God I don't know why I'm saying this this morning but you better take hold of it whatever I'm laying down you better pick up there are a lot of marriages that got married and their full satisfaction wasn't in the Lord yet they're looking to that girl they're looking to that guy for thirst that they have within them and they're going to learn after they get married some people they learn later on no no wait a minute she can't fulfill that he can't fulfill that that has to come from the Lord and I got married people saying amen I got married people saying amen right now that's been married for years it has to be about your thirst going to the Lord for your thirst first what if that mate dies what if they go what if things change then is it all over as you're walking see things can change it has to be your thirst it's fulfilled in God first and when you are going to that Fountain you're there's a satisfaction there's a peace there's a rest I would go on with God if I as job said though God slay me though God slay me yet I'll trust him take my kids take my family and that's what happened and he says the his wife said Curse God and die get it over with give up but he himself had a revelation though God slay me and take everything away I will not curse God I will serve him the rest of my life with all of my heart there's a man that's satisfied with his walk with the Lord take everything away from him and he's still intact somebody say Amen this world take everything away and he's still intact amen Hallelujah how many would pray for more marriages like that amen so in this message thirst it's related to relationships in our life broken relationships as you peel back the layers someone has a thirst for love and attention and they never got it marriage problems marriage divorces family split UPS peel back the layers that's why when I'm doing any kind of looking at this I'm saying I'm sitting back looking at where where was The Thirst and I'm saying early on in the marriage did some needs not get met from the Lord and from their mate because there is a certain level of meeting your other mate's needs instead of your own and jumping in and being Christ with them and giving love to them even when they're unlovable fulfilling their needs there's a certain truth to that can you say Amen I peel back the layers of broken relationships someone has a thirst for love even as a young boy or a young girl thirst for attention and they never got it they're crazy when I enter a marriage like that I'm talking about relationships now enter a marriage like that there's still a craving they never got it they're still craving for something I'm wanting something then they get disappointed because they're not getting it all through their mate either because they're those to get it from the Lord or because that other mate is not sensitive to their needs and so they're not trying to meet that at all so it becomes a very cold thing over the years you might be on fire the first few years of your marriage but then it becomes cold because why still some need is not being met some craving is down there God made us the way that we are and you can't deny that can you say Amen so he goes into thirst and he says we have natural thirst from God we got a thirst for uh he says we have a thirst in us for success and that's a god-given thirst did you know that there's a thirst in us to be successful now look at the world and all the counterfeits that they have to show you this is Success take a woman and so now she don't get success anymore out of raising her children right that's the greatest success she got all these gifts and talents like my wife and like a lot of all women have gifts and talents you see and so and so but it can be misdirected that I'm not getting satisfaction into this so this is more important than this no it'll never be more important you see you have to look at what God values as success in life success fulfill your gifts do do whatever God you and your husband decide to do unto the will of God but don't ever buy into the LIE of this society that I'm going to drink from that Fountain because that's what they say a successful woman is he also says that it's in a woman thirst to be pretty there's nothing wrong with a woman wanting to be pretty that's not in a man and it shouldn't be if it's in a man who want to be pretty something's desperately wrong but it's a god-given thirst in a woman to want to be pretty amen Brothers don't ever knock that you're not going to be that way she is so this you're doing this and she's changing things and she goes into the deposit and there's hundreds of dresses in there and she says I don't have anything to wear today we'll never understand that don't try to understand it it's about how she looks and she should once again I get back the way it should be you should be wanting to be pretty and brother Brian says this in the message if you listen it's for your husband not other men you've crossed the line if it's for other men and other women you say do women dress for other women oh yeah they do it's a competition they dress for other women too never supposed to be that way it's for your husband and you young girls that are single it's unto the Lord be modest and just these things be pretty all you want to but under the guidelines of the scripture that he gave be pretty it's in your natural I never want you to be something different and so then I'm going on that's why I'm asking to read the sermon or listen to the sermon because there's so much in there about your sisters in the dress and things because what he's saying is that you have The Thirst but Satan has got you all these fountains to drink from of what's modest and what's not and what's pretty and it's pervert it's a perversion to pervert your view of pretty it says thirst for beauty for women a thirst for Success there's a bunch of them in there um a thirst for Fellowship he says it's not strange for a guy and a girl to want fellowship and commandship and get married that's a thirst God gave you to be married and to have Fellowship there's a thirst sentence for Fellowship and it's a god-given thirst I love fellowship with the Saints I love Fellowship because God put it in me nothing wrong with that but it's when Satan has other fountains to drink from that pervert the pure place that we're supposed to go to fulfill these thirsts Amen brother Paul he said in thirst though one place he said a man get out what makes them and this is this is something deep I want to get into here it's only 20 after 12 so we're doing good notice this about thirst a man get out what makes a man get drunk brother Brian's going to give reasons for a man getting drunk that we don't think of it's going to be about The Thirst it's not going to be about he did something wrong oh he's drinking he gets drunk he's destroying his family he's doing this we look at what he's doing trying to correctly stop drinking he gives the inner reason is because he's worried and tore up there's something lacking in him so nobody ever talks about what the man's lacking or that he needs the Fountain of Christ to come to that to fulfill what's lacking we only talk about his drinking brother Brown even mentioned one of the temp preachers who became an alcoholic and he's he actually hinted that we should be careful of criticizing a man like that because he turned to something I did not hear Brother Brown said he doesn't have the Holy Ghost all this does that we say all the time we can say those things but he was trying to once again point out the man got under trash he got under certain things it drove him he became drinking he'd become alcoholic he's entering the pulpit and he's drunk terrible terrible thing should never happen but it did and he says but if we understood where he came from and where he got there you see that's what the mature people we need to be what's the need Jesus looks beyond our faults and sees our need we need to be that way looking beyond the fall and seeing the thirst what's The Thirst where is he lacking he's worried he's tore up and he's worried and tore up because he's lacking something I was at males here not ongoing I was up there on an interview and then it was told in this that talking about drinking and I told them that my father drank and said what made him drink I said I don't know he said is because that there was something that he wasn't satisfied that wasn't satisfying him and he thought he could drink to throw it off his mind I caught it right then see it was really God was the only thing can satisfy that thirst God himself is the only thing can satisfy that human for her thirst is to accept God he's looking at the thirst instead of the problem and so with that as a precedence we have to look he says something's lacking in that person it starts that way then he's worried and tore up he will seek what the world has to he will seek what the world has to offer to ignore or put off The Thirst that he's feeling he'll seek a counterfeit in the world and we had some alcoholics delivered here in this congregation we have alcoholics we have drug addicts we have people sitting here that's been delivered you can hear their testimonies I want to hear them I want to hear God's Deliverance but it's not complicated how they got Deliverance it's simple they found the Fountain of Living Water amen there's a need there's a craving and a lot of times when someone's ignoring the need it becomes obvious to everyone else but him but her that they're not addressing the real problem he started drinking he should he should not have done that but drinking but but you see the the he's drinking and he's drinking from the wrong thing you people within our assembly and others that are listening with long-standing issues since you were a kid some of you when are you going to start drinking what I'm preaching you're still coming but when are you going to start drinking what I'm preaching because it's drinking what I'm preaching that will be your answer no matter how impossible it looks people ignore and neglect the real problem can you say Amen I know it's not a shouting service but shout amen anyway amen we've got to find the need can you say many we can't ignore and neglect the real problem I'm thinking of a very hilarious moment a couple weeks ago when I realized for weeks on end my son Gideon is driving around town and to church and in my driveway and everything and he's got the loudest Muffler problem that I've ever heard and he continues to go for Weeks driving this ignoring paying for the problem yes and then at his birthday he wanted a certain set of headphones I went and got him for him because I'm a good dad and I got him the headphones and he still has the noise coming out of his Muffler and it Dawns on me while we're sitting in the truck and we got a good laugh out of it I know why you want these headphones noise cancellation headphones that he can continue to ignore the problem and not pay for it come on if he has noise cancellation he can be in that car listening to the music and he doesn't have to hit the muffler but all the rest of us still do because he's ignoring his problem now we're laughing but some people over and over again in their life they got some headphones and they're ignoring problems in their life they're ignoring it they've got noise cancellation headphones and they're everybody's looking around saying shouldn't you address that problem shouldn't you have maybe come to the Altar and ask repentance it got things right from God with God shouldn't you be everybody it's obvious to everybody else but the muffler's sounding loud to everybody to a wife to a husband the muffler is out of control it's terrible and it's destroying the whole family and everybody's sees it but he or her praise the Lord so we can see our downfall in this that even around the message is to think the person's problems started when they turn to drinking or they turn to pornography what a shame when we just only look at that as being the problem it is a problem it's tragic it's one of the most filthy detrimental things you could do to a wife Brothers I'm going to tell you straighteners and anything more adultery and going to another woman and seeking looking at the body of another woman that way it's detrimental to relationship into your life but I can tell you it's not just the only issue there is a thirst not being fulfilled there's a craving there's a hunger something's not being addressed people say our problems started with this when this happened in our marriage our our debt started when we bought this car it all started it didn't start there praise the Lord our debt everything started right then and not necessarily you know if the debt came it probably started with a heart that said I want it no matter what got a thirst for something and so this all accumulates all the debt now we've got to do this we got to do that we're a mess and so now but you're looking at the problem and we're preachers we're preaching at the problems and correct this and do that but we've got to look at The Thirst that's in man and say there's a fountain open in the House of David and I would rather have people come and fulfill and get satisfaction for the craving in their heart then just correct things on the outside most times it didn't start with the car that you bought or didn't start with this or that the other it started when someone was not loved enough somebody was craving something some need was not being satisfied that husband and wife was never loved for who they are when they were a child very possible this happens over and over again very possible we have to find our full satisfaction in the Fountain of Life from God and then when we have it then we are seeking to meet the needs of others letting that flow out of us to them can you say Amen we drink and God meets our deepest need for love and approval how many believe that we drink from his Fountain and he meets our deepest need for love and approval and then out of us this river flows to others and meets the need of others can you say Amen so the other day there was this girl that was posting online the other day a bunch of stuff critical of the preacher's critical of the message and taking a stand for those who left the message and things and and so I was listening to it all and some of it I could have got on and corrected it wasn't scriptural what she was some of the things she was saying and I just kept listening listening you know what I said this person is craving something that never got Met she's found an audience online she's found somebody to listen to into you know and she's got she's got a platform now to share all this stuff and that's fine that's that's the that's a problem sure that's that's probably out of balance but but I can look each side and say there's a there's a real bitter person here some need was not met way way back and she thinks it's fulfilling it correcting everybody and correcting the churches and everything no wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute there's a knee not being met because you wouldn't have to do that you would have to gather an audience online you wouldn't have to express and do all this stuff to you know you don't have to do that because you're confident in the Lord oh I'm trying to help people I'm trying no no no sometimes it's just you want attention craving for the attention you never got from somebody praise the Lord everybody I wrote this back in 2008 I typed this out 2008 I found it last night as we enter 2008 I see a world plagued by dissatisfaction Hollywood and other entertainment companies can't keep up with the demand to produce new pleasures and new things people live in constant dissatisfaction Satan is the God of this evil age he is given the nature of running to and fro how many knows Satan runs to and fro seeking who may devour but the other meaning to that he has given the nature of running to and fro never settled never at rest always running Satan's nature running to and fro that Spirit comes from Satan never settle down never restful this satisfaction is the cause of depression sometimes and sicknesses no one is content sometimes it's the cause of uh literal sicknesses physical sickness sometimes no one is content I said to my wife we live in times where it pressures us to neglect the simple things and the important things and pursue new things all the time oh this is convicting B2 we live in a time where we're pressured to neglect simple things and important things and pursue new things all the time we're in a tailspin laodicean age is an age of replacement an alternative for real things it replaces real joys in God and real pleasures in God I teach the young people something about lust lust is Never Satisfied there is the lust in the world first John 2 the lust of the eyes and the lust of the world but then there's your own individual lust and it says in James it is uh James and so your own individual lust I express it this way is a mistress who's constantly wooing you away from what you have to what's out there it draws you away your individual lust draws you away from what you can't have and what you shouldn't have and takes you away with from what you already have it tells you you're not happy you're not satisfied you need to get that out there that's like Satan but in God's kingdom is rest contentment peace satisfaction and Lasting joys this lust draws us away all the time there's the end time in the end time there's a falling away there's a drawing away there's a pulling down this makes us weak and cast doubts in our mind there's nothing that that there's nothing that's going to satisfy us but that's a lie of the enemy there is satisfaction in the Lord we must learn in this Satan's eating how to come back to God and to his god-given fountains and drink from them there is something that satisfies even today Satan wants us to draw us away from that amen I read the text in proverbs 4 5 there it says drink from your own Wells don't drink from a stranger's Wells don't drink from another Fountain and then he goes into the husband and says God's given you a well of that wife for your passions don't drink from another well don't drink from a strange woman enjoy the wife of thy youth so God has god-given Wells to fulfill your god-given thirst and he says don't drink from the other Wells drink from the ones God gave you for every thirst within us God provides a pure well for that thirst to drink from we have so many thirsts within us some we don't even understand The Thirst within us but they are there and God is sensitive to the hunger and the desire of man if there is a deep call there's a d if there's a deep call to the if there's a deep call to the Deep then there's a deep to respond after looking at link to the set of scriptures in proverbs 4 I find God expressing how critical it is for us to enjoy the well he provides be content to be satisfied and with a warning there's no need to drink from the other Wells if you do there's only depression and unhappiness and bondage and breaking up of families we're in a desert spiritually in these times how many knows we're in a desert there is a fountain open in the House of David the pure message set by the prophet is God's response to our hunger and need for these times it's funny how that that it is not good enough for people anymore funny how we don't need to listen to it anymore when we seek satisfaction in anything else it just don't satisfy like God can satisfy for every first there is also Wells from the world sometimes many different choices those Wells are made to be much more alluring from the outside when we focus off of god-given wells and drink a little from those other ones we will start to experience frustration dissatisfaction nervousness a lack of peace confusion and feeling overwhelmed life loses its Simplicity the world's Wells are kind of like a drug they give you a high or a buzz a feel good then they drop you again but in God's fear joy in God and thus in life is being happy and content with what God has provided for us happiness is not what we own or knowing a lot of people or having a lot of likes online there's not fullness in that or being good looking to everybody or being have a following on the internet happiness is not what we own or knowing a lot of people it's being content with what Lottie has given us in life this applies to money and everything every good and perfect gift comes from where comes from the father above those are good and perfect gifts that he gives us they're not they're not dissatisfying gifts that they're perfect gifts God gives us what we need not what we want can you say Amen his gifts are perfect for us but what a shame when we don't settle with them and enjoy them we tend to always look for a new Fountain to drink from God's provided quenching is not a temporal high it's not a flashy excuse me it's not as flashy but it's not fleshly but they are a consistent Joy a deeper Joy you don't crash or have a hangover or plunge your depression with God's satisfaction or a constant state of dissatisfaction there is a fountain opened in the House of David that's from 2008 here we are in 2000 22. thank you deacon that's in 2008. wow were there even more aren't we oh God forgive me when I jump to other things to get my satisfaction my peace is in you might you have given me how many can raise your hand this morning he's given me more than I deserve he's given me a family he's you say well I don't have a lot of family members he's given you a family here he provides what you're lacking and we need to look at what God's blessed us with and The Fountains that we can drink from our friendships and quit looking for them somewhere else we should be a people who is at peace who's satisfied who's not Restless I know where my soul is today I love that song he says Be Still My Soul Be Still My Soul that's what David said and my soul is at peace I've been washed in the blood of the Lamb I'm going to the other side in a Rapture I know where I stand can you say amen and then God gives me all these other Wells to drink from that are true Wells from my thirst a husband a wife a Godly husband a god wife and if not that some companions that are spiritual nourishment to me God provides what's lacking and I'm so thankful for it and I'm at peace with it totally satisfied I'm not like Satan running to and fro constantly Restless 2008 I said that when the Holy Ghost comes inside out of your belly shall flow rivers of living water and then the Thirsty can come and drink and you say Amen out of our belly shall flow rivers of Living Waters then the Thirsty can come and drink now I'm taking a last turn here taking it deeper you ready to go with me I wonder if this subject today fits into Romans 12 what we are studying Wednesday night and I'm going to go there because as I said that's the relationship that Paul began to describe in the church and how we should treat one another after the book of Acts then it comes into Romans I'm going to continue on when I preach this month uh for some of you new ones I try to take most of the month of October off to rest that's why we're having different ministers I I only speak a couple times this month brother Diggs is with us next Sunday morning and Sunday night but as I get to this series more we're going to go more and more into relationships after Redemption and be specific but um on Wednesday we really enjoyed out of Romans 12. uh said you know we present our bodies of Living Sacrifice and he comes down to verse 9 says Let Your Love be without hypocrisy dissimulation so we we got into love that's expressed with tainted with hypocrisy and I was kind of on a little bit on that that there's something is in us and we cannot hold back from anyone if it's in us and so it is selfish not to give what we have to others and to all others um so that's the first reason it is selfish to hold back love that we say we have it is selfish to hold it back from certain ones and give it to others and second of all the love of God does not have a shutoff valve or is it a well that runs dry it never runs dry or is it a river that stops running it doesn't ever stop running I'll get to in a minute brother Brian says this is an inexhaustible Fountain of Life it'll never run out and it says it's flowing through you so I was talking about this love and you know there's other things he says in chapter 12 verse 10 be kindly affectionate one to another this is all relationships how we deal with one another so I was reading it again yesterday say Lord you want me to go into this and study a little bit more in teaching so I just kind of skipped over that part I'll get back to it Lord willing I skipped over to chapter 13 and verse 8. and I was pretty stumbled at how this was I've read it before hundreds of times no doubt but I really was wondering about this it says Romans 13 and verse 8 you still so I got your attention a few minutes says oh no man anything but love to one another for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law there's about three different subjects there the last one of course is is that if you're trying to satisfy the requirements of the law if you got Divine love and you're doing letting that flow from you you're going to satisfy the law automatically because that's the Fulfillment of the law Jesus said that love God with all your heart so mind and strength and love your neighbors yourself and he says on this hinges all the rest of the law if you did those from a Divine love you don't have to worry about the rest of the law that covers it simplifies it doesn't it but this oh no man anything and I've preached on this a little bit and taken that part about not being in debt and brother Branham comments he says it's the last days it's the end time he said you got any lingering debts he said I'm not talking about your house he says you need to pay your debts and get them out of the way and we've encouraged people through the years don't get in a lot of debt the end times here don't be re you know go get into but but you need to actually have a program to get out of debt and get released of debt and so that's what is that's that's what we take from it is that oh no man anything so the the command one writer says the command to oh no man anything should not necessarily be read as a command to Christians never to borrow money for any reason that's not what it means the sense of the Greek is that we should not let any debt remain outstanding that we should not keep on owing anyone for anything in other words ignoring the debt you've made a promise some people don't realize as Christians you sign a thing for a loan you sign that at Speedway you sign the credit card you sign a signature to promise to pay that you made a covenant and you should pay it now we have a day of bankruptcy bankruptcy actually originated in the Old Testament law that every seven years could refresh and everything could be written off but in the and they took those laws and replied them today but we got thousands of people declaring Millions declaring bankruptcy today it's because they don't have any control over the credit card debt so every every few years they ring it all up declare bankruptcy wipes it off chapter 11 wipes it off and they start getting the credit cards again they haven't solved the problem The Thirst right so I don't think it's right unless that law is set for people who lose their job and they have no way to pay that back for a long period of time even Christians still feel like Lord I don't want to I don't want to have to do this because I I need to pay that someday and that's what a lot of Christians do I'm not able to do it now and that's what that law is for to declare I'm not making anybody feel bad for declaring bankrupts but if you have to but it's abused in the world chapter 13 is better because chapter 13 says I'm arranging with all my creditors to pay a certain amount and if they agreed to that amount I'm going to pay that amount so you make an arrange it so that's better than saying chapter 11. I want it all wiped out so I can go get some more stuff that's wrong Christians oh no man anything you made a promise you need to pay it back and if it takes you 10 years to pay it back you need to pay it back you people that owe rent on your house I mean it's a little pastoral correction that's what I hear come back sometimes you all ran on your house you haven't paid that somebody read you need to pay your rent you agreed to pay your rent and you need to pay it you bring it first of all you bring a bad testimony on Christianity when you don't pay it you go to a school or you owe this to school fees or whatever else you need to pay that and if you can't the rest is when I owed you go and talk to them and say I've got I pay my tithes I pay this here's my budget I'm being open with you I'm going to do my best to give you this amount until I pay this off you go talk to them good because that's what Christianity does and so that's usually how we preach this but remember now uh we have to look at the scripture deeper let me finish what he says here about money that may uh that may be understood as a requirement to always pay what we owe in a timely manner according to whatever agreement we have made with the lender or put another way it it's not to not live lives of constant dependency borrowing or unreliable in truth however Paul is not primarily concerned with money here listen Paul is not primarily concerned with money here as the following verses will show he wants to talk about our obligation as followers of Christ to love other people he wants to talk about our obligation as Christ follows to love other people including our neighbors he seems to say that loving others is a debt we will never pay off now when I read that and I read the scripture again I said is he really saying that can you put it up again hold it up there is he really saying oh no man anything but you will always owe love to one another you always be in debt you'll always have an obligation to share the love you say you have within you you will always and never hold that back and you say amen and that's how we need to look alive I I have a debt to this person or I have a I have a a satisfaction I have a a deposit that I can make I can give this person we give people money but it's not money this is the Eternal Divine love of God that we hold within us and we owe that to everyone that we meet so anybody who gets this attitude which is today is that I don't know anybody anything and they don't owe me nothing right so I'm My Own guy and my own man I don't owe anybody anything and they don't owe anything to me I don't really need them you got a carnal mind that you got that from the world I don't care if you attend this church that's a carnal mind because if you have the Holy Ghost and divine love within you you are indebted to the rest of the body of Christ in this world in other words you'd have a right to hold back what you have it's to be given to others and you will always that it never ends you will always be saying you will always have that there you need to it's funny thing it's a funny thing how late I'm preaching here it's a funny thing how he says don't owe in relationships if you owe somebody something sometimes it creates tension in the relationship you owe Uncle Bob money that you haven't paid him for 10 years and you're across the Thanksgiving table and you can't help wondering what he's thinking about you and what you're thinking about him and you haven't paid that money back to Uncle Bob yet so money not owed or things old things promises you made in relationships can create tension so now with money or anything else everything else we say when you come to relationships don't owe them anything you might owe them an apology and you haven't done it for 20 years get all that cleared out get all clear make it right and don't owe him any money don't owe him anything but don't you dare go to the place and say I don't know anybody I don't owe them they don't know me we have no connection with one another oh yes you do mom oh you Christians raise your hand I don't have to connect with anybody I don't want to oh yes you do you say you have Divine love here and you read your Bible and you're a Christian you have something that says it must be given to others I don't know I don't know them anything well that's good but you owe him love I don't know maybe it's not new to you but that's new to me and I stand corrected I'll tell you I stand corrected I never seen that in the Bible before I'll admit it publicly over the Internet I've never seen that scripture that way the only part I've seen was that I need to get out of debt but I didn't realize that I will always owe the love of Christ to everybody that I meet and when I meet them I'm I'm obligated to make a deposit for their need other than that it's selfishness I got what I got I don't need anybody else doesn't work we are in debt for others we owe we're obligated that stumbled me till I realize what we have within us so the answer God gave me is this John chapter 7 verse 37 and 38 where he cries and said if there's any thirsty in the last day let him come and drink and the next Christine says out of the Believers will flow rivers of Living Water can you say Amen and it cannot be stopped up it cannot you can't turn the the faucet off if there's a thirst and there's a need there is a fountain and it's not at church as such it's in us and it must flow to everyone at all times under any circumstances this River of Love must keep going there's no end to it there's no restrictions to it brother Brian says here's my interpretation of him about being the water he is the inexhaustible Fountain of Life you'll never ask him too much you can never believe him for too greater of things he Delights in you believing him for great things how many can say amen he Delights in you believing for great things well he's in the exhaustible fountain you can't ask too much of God and so now he Delights in you believing for him for great things you can never overdo it could you imagine a little fish about a half inch long way out there in the middle of the ocean say now wait a minute I better think this over a little fish saying wait a minute I better think this over where's Ellie she's sleeping a little fishy Kylie Ellie a little can you imagine a little fishy in the ocean saying now wait a minute I better think this through I better think that's true I better drink very sparingly of this water because I might run out this year well if you could figure that out then try to exhaust the Fountain of God's goodness to you could you just imagine a little mouse a half inch long under the big Garners of Egypt saying I'll just eat one grain a day I better allowance myself to one great a day because I might run out before the new crop comes in oh my what's he doing he's depriving himself that's exactly what's the matter with the church today in taking Church Creeds and dogmas and trying to suck off of them instead of taking the word of God and enjoying the fullness of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the things of God you can't restrict the inexhaustible Fountain of God there is no faucets to it there is no stop to it it will keep flowing until the Rapture and none of us need to stop up that flow don't be like a little stupid fish that's saying I really need to think this through I mean I need to take this sparingly no not the things of God it's not sparingly a matter of fact he says when you ask ask for big things because we serve a big God blessed be his name not like the little mouse who says oh I better I just need one no no no no but think big think big I serve a big God and you can't restrict this and now if you apply it to yourself as I'm closing this bride the spirit and the bride say come to this Fountain can you say amen and if it's flowing through you then you're saying come to the needy come to the ones who need something come to those that are thirsty you can come if you're thirsty to me because I have a river within me we can't stop up that River and hold it back from certain people we can't do it friends does your life say come does your life say come to the needy to all others in our lives does it say come does your life stay calm or does it say stay back off don't mess with me I know I'm preaching some conviction to some of you this morning does your life always say come or to some people who doesn't say stay back stay back she knows that's her work I don't know where she learned it from but sometimes you come up to her she says stay back we're not supposed to say stay back our lives are supposed to say come right well they look at this earring in their ear and look at this they look like the drugs of society Our Lives should say come here the guy in church and they said this and the other churches are saying this about me and I don't want to fellowship with any them anymore I'm finished with that church Our Lives should say come right if they're not saying come that's up to them but our life should say come there's no faucet to this that we shut off come the spirit and the bride say if there's anybody thirsty whosoever will let me tell you as God simplifies this message that he sent to us over and over again he just simplifies it more and more and more and more for me I'm just saying it's just simple the fountain's been opened up the seals have been opened up the fountain's been opened up we are recipients of that Fountain it's within us and now at that last moment you can't be a more thirsty world with people with more needs and their answer is the Fountain of Living Waters there is no other answer than that one and our lives should say if you're thirsty the spirit and the bride say come you find that lyric sister Genie why don't you pull that up when I was a kid mom played for us the Bill Gaither Trio kids album there was a song says
