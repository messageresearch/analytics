A Love of My Own

Composed by Rusty Goodman and Aaron Wilburn
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] everybody dreams about falling in love visions of rainbows and sunshine above but when the rainbow have faded and the Sunshine was gone I was still searching for a Love of My [Music] Own then one day a savior came and he called out my name and ever since that Gentle Touch I have not been the same he replaced all my dreams and my chasing rainbows with his joy in my heart and the love of my own and since I met Jesus I know what love really is until I met Jesus there was no feeling like this on my face is his son shine and in my heart is his is love and now I can say I have a Love of My [Music] Own just like castles in the sand Your World falls upon heart you watch The Sands of timey race the dreams of your heart but just turn around Jesus is standing there and he beckons you to come he's waiting there to give to you a love of your [Music] own oh and when you meet Jesus you'll know what love really I until you meet Jesus there'll be no feeling like this on your face will be his sunshine and in your heart will be his song and then you you can say I A Love of My Own yes now I can say I A Love of My Own you
