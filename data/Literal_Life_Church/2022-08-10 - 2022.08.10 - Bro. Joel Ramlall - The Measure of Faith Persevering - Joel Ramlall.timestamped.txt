[0:00] 21 bring your greetings from our little
[0:02] church in Meriden Connecticut Overcomers
[0:04] Tabernacle and for my pastor brother
[0:06] Craig Gore it's lovely to be with you
[0:08] all again and I have quite a bit of
[0:11] family with me this time I see my
[0:12] parents my sisters here I saw my
[0:15] brother-in-law Lucas from Arizona
[0:17] somewhere here in the back of course
[0:19] it's always wonderful to visit with my
[0:21] in-laws I even have family from Mexico
[0:24] with me tonight the Romero family God
[0:27] bless you all it's nice to see you let's
[0:30] read from Matthew chapter 15 and verse
[0:33] 21.
[0:38] certainly thank brother Paul for the
[0:40] opportunity and the privilege of
[0:41] speaking to you all tonight Matthew 15
[0:44] and verse 21 it says then Jesus went
[0:48] Vents and departed into the coasts of
[0:50] tire and sidon this entire passage is
[0:54] going to hinge on that statement Jesus
[0:56] went thence it was his choice he was
[0:59] following the father's will verse 22 it
[1:01] says and behold a woman of Canaan came
[1:04] out of the same coasts and Cried unto
[1:06] him saying have mercy on me O Lord thou
[1:09] son of David my daughter is grievously
[1:12] vexed with the devil but he answered her
[1:14] not a word and his disciples came and
[1:16] besought him saying send her away for
[1:18] she quiet after us but he answered and
[1:21] said I am not sent but unto the lost
[1:23] sheep of the House of Israel then came
[1:26] she and worshiped him saying Lord help
[1:30] me there's something special about
[1:31] worship isn't there it always catches
[1:34] the heart of the Lord but he answered
[1:36] and said it is not meat to take the
[1:38] children's bread and cast it to dogs and
[1:41] she said truth Lord everything that he
[1:44] says is truth to us amen yet the dogs
[1:47] eat of the crumbs which fall from their
[1:49] master's table verse 28 then Jesus
[1:52] answered and said unto her o woman great
[1:55] is thy faith
[1:57] be it unto thee even as thou Wilt he
[2:01] didn't just say you have faith he said
[2:03] great is thy faith there was something
[2:05] about her approach that caused the
[2:07] master to say great is thy faith and her
[2:11] daughter was made whole from that very
[2:12] hour and I love that this whole story
[2:15] takes place and it wasn't even about her
[2:17] she had a need on her heart that she
[2:19] approached the Lord with and God saw to
[2:21] it that that need was in that because
[2:23] she approached him the right way
[2:25] now keep your finger there in Matthew
[2:27] chapter 15 because I'm going to Pivot a
[2:29] little bit around that chapter so let's
[2:31] pray together and then we'll be seated
[2:33] Heavenly Father we thank you for this
[2:35] opportunity again to be in your presence
[2:37] Lord to swirl your to feel your sweet
[2:39] presence in the building Lord as soon as
[2:41] we stepped in Lord knowing the mighty
[2:43] things that you've done in here Lord for
[2:44] each life and each person oh God I pray
[2:47] that you would pour out your spirit once
[2:48] more we ask oh God again once more pour
[2:51] out your spirit on us O Lord help us
[2:53] this evening we pray o God have your
[2:55] perfect way in the service we ask in the
[2:57] lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[2:59] pray amen and amen God bless you may be
[3:02] seated this evening
[3:04] now this evening I'm hoping that you'll
[3:07] you'll try to help me out and and grasp
[3:09] what I'm trying to say and don't Focus
[3:11] too much on just the the how of how I'm
[3:14] going about saying it uh we want to just
[3:16] look into this this little passage here
[3:19] and this interaction between the woman
[3:21] and Jesus now if you could uh flip one
[3:24] page back over to chapter 14
[3:28] and verse 17.
[3:31] chapter 14 and verse 17 the page before
[3:34] uh and they say unto him we have here
[3:37] but Five Loaves and two fishes
[3:40] and Jesus said bring them hither to me
[3:42] and he commanded the multitude to sit
[3:44] down on the grass and took the Five
[3:46] Loaves and two fishes and looking up to
[3:48] heaven he blessed and break and gave the
[3:50] loaves to his disciples and the
[3:52] disciples to the multitude and they did
[3:54] all eat and were filled and they took up
[3:57] the fragments that remained 12 baskets
[3:59] full
[4:00] so there's no question about whether he
[4:03] can provide bread or not right now we
[4:05] read in our opening scripture that he
[4:07] said I can't take the children's bread
[4:08] and cast it to dogs some implication
[4:11] there that okay limited supply of bread
[4:13] right but it was not a limited supply of
[4:15] bread of course he could Supply the
[4:16] bread it was a question of Faith now go
[4:19] over to Matthew chapter 15 and verse 36.
[4:24] Matthew 15 and verse 36 and it says and
[4:27] he took the seven loaves this time and
[4:29] fishes and gave thanks and break them
[4:31] and gave to his disciples and the
[4:33] disciples to the multitude and they did
[4:35] all eat and were filled so on either
[4:37] side of this interaction between Jesus
[4:40] and the woman there's a miracle of God's
[4:42] supplying bread and I want to say
[4:44] there's no supply chain issues with God
[4:46] God can supply the bread it's not a
[4:48] question of whether or not he can supply
[4:49] it it's a question of our faith in him
[4:51] and whether or not we will believe that
[4:53] he can supply the bread
[4:55] now let's look again here
[4:57] I want to look again uh Matthew 14 flip
[5:01] back Matthew 14 and verse 31.
[5:07] Matthew 14 and verse 31 says and
[5:09] immediately Jesus stretched forth his
[5:11] hand he's dealing with Peter now when he
[5:13] was walking out on the water and caught
[5:15] him and he said oh thou of little faith
[5:18] wherefore did this thou doubt while we
[5:20] read Jesus said to this woman great is
[5:22] thy faith so now in comparison before
[5:24] this Jesus is saying to Peter you've got
[5:26] little faith and here he says to this
[5:28] woman you've got great faith and then
[5:30] again over in chapter 16
[5:33] Matthew chapter 16 verse verse 8 when
[5:37] Jesus perceived he said unto them O ye
[5:39] of little faith so look at the
[5:42] surroundings of this this story that's
[5:43] happening between Jesus and the woman on
[5:46] the one side he he multiplies bread then
[5:48] he tells the woman I can't give the
[5:49] children's bread to you then immediately
[5:51] after that he goes and multiplies bread
[5:53] again because God is the provider he can
[5:56] do it it's about our approach to him and
[5:58] if we'll believe him and have faith in
[6:00] him look on either side of this miracle
[6:02] of Jesus healing the woman's daughter he
[6:04] he says to the disciples you have little
[6:06] faith on one side and then on the other
[6:08] side of the this miracle he says ye have
[6:10] little faith again but to this woman he
[6:12] says you have great faith be it unto
[6:15] thee even as thou Wilt now let me read
[6:17] this quote to you from the prophet now
[6:18] all Christians must be persistent they
[6:22] must be perseverant and the only way
[6:24] that you're able to do this is to First
[6:26] have faith in what you're trying to do
[6:29] and if you have no faith you're just
[6:31] jumping at it then you can't you cannot
[6:33] be perseverant but when you really know
[6:35] it's the truth then there's nothing
[6:37] going to stop you you're really
[6:39] perseverant then tonight I want to
[6:41] preach on a little title called The
[6:43] Measure of Faith and my subtitle will be
[6:45] perseverance we know that the prophet
[6:47] preached the message persevering about
[6:49] 10 or 11 times using this text
[6:52] he also says when a man knows the word
[6:55] and the will of God you become
[6:57] persistent you become perseverant no
[7:00] matter what science says you're
[7:02] perseverant because you know the word
[7:04] and the will of God
[7:07] now this woman she was of a canaanitis
[7:09] background Now everywhere that I could
[7:12] find in the Scripture it wasn't looking
[7:15] so good for Canaan Kanan the grandson of
[7:18] Noah and his descendants there they were
[7:20] pushed northward as the the Israelites
[7:22] came in and took over the land in one
[7:25] place Mark calls this woman and he
[7:27] renders her a Greek she's also rendered
[7:30] a Cyril Phoenician so we see that her
[7:32] background is not entirely Jewish now
[7:35] she doesn't understand maybe all of the
[7:37] Customs all of the Jewish Customs she's
[7:39] got a different kind of background a
[7:41] Greek background but this will come into
[7:43] play later now where we want to start
[7:46] our our passage here this evening it
[7:48] says Matthew 15 21 then Jesus went
[7:51] thence and departed into the coast of
[7:54] tire and silent and I love that this
[7:56] whole situation starts with Jesus went
[7:58] next it was Jesus that took control it
[8:01] was Jesus that was walking according to
[8:03] Vision according to the father's will
[8:05] before we had a need Jesus knew that we
[8:08] had the need Jesus knew that the woman
[8:09] had the need and he had already started
[8:12] going there and before she ever could
[8:14] get to him he already placed himself
[8:16] Within Reach before we had a problem God
[8:18] was on his way God knew what you were
[8:20] thinking on your way to church this
[8:22] evening he knew when you were driving
[8:23] here you were praying God give me an
[8:25] answer and he knew that you would be
[8:27] here this evening and he's ready to give
[8:29] you the answer that you need it's always
[8:31] God that will place himself Within Reach
[8:33] of us it's always been that way it's
[8:36] always been him that took that first
[8:37] step to us when we were lost he reached
[8:39] out and saved us it's he that came down
[8:41] and shed his blood for us that we might
[8:43] be saved name we can think and we can
[8:45] imagine now as brother Branham described
[8:47] it that God the great God was up there
[8:49] in the beginning the Creator he was
[8:51] alone with his thoughts and if you'll
[8:53] just allow me a little bit of Liberty to
[8:55] dramatize now that God was up there and
[8:57] maybe this being had one thought every
[9:00] million years or so just on a time scale
[9:03] that we could not understand
[9:06] he was there alone with his thoughts and
[9:08] We Know by the message of the hour that
[9:10] we were there we were one of his
[9:12] thoughts back there and just think
[9:13] tonight that maybe God had spent a
[9:17] couple million years just thinking about
[9:19] you an attribute of God that would be
[9:22] made manifest in this age that God way
[9:25] back when this being who was so great
[9:27] maybe one thought every million years
[9:29] maybe just to bat his eyelid would be a
[9:31] couple thousand years to complete that
[9:33] Revolution this God sitting there
[9:36] thinking of you wanting to fellowship
[9:40] with you and there he would take a step
[9:42] down uh the prophet would describe it as
[9:44] a logos that went forth from like a
[9:46] light in some places he would call it
[9:48] the Sun s-o-n and and that that light
[9:51] went forth and played before him as a
[9:53] child would play but what was it it was
[9:55] God condescending it was God doing the
[9:58] same thing that he did here then Jesus
[10:00] went thence it was God taking that step
[10:03] down he had something in his mind that
[10:05] he was trying to achieve and God took
[10:08] that first step and he stepped out into
[10:10] this light called the logos and we read
[10:12] in the scripture where it says for by
[10:14] him were all things created that are in
[10:16] heaven and that are on earth visible and
[10:18] invisible whether they be Thrones or
[10:20] dominions or principalities or Powers
[10:22] all things were created by Him He is
[10:25] before all things and by him all things
[10:27] consist God had a plan as he was
[10:30] stepping down it wasn't a different
[10:32] person it was just God changing his robe
[10:35] changing his mask stepping down now into
[10:37] this light beginning to brood over
[10:40] creation and God would come down now and
[10:42] begin to brood over the Earth and
[10:44] eventually make man in that same image
[10:47] now follow me now God condescending
[10:50] God's stepping down Jesus placing
[10:52] himself in the path of this woman think
[10:54] of that God coming down now trying to
[10:56] place himself in your path and here he
[10:59] begins the work of creation stepping
[11:01] down lower and lower until man now has a
[11:04] body form and after the fall God using
[11:07] the woman to bring forth God to bring
[11:10] forth Christ Jesus in a body form that
[11:12] we could see and know and Christ's going
[11:15] to the cross and it doesn't stop there
[11:17] and when Christ was on the Cross pulled
[11:20] out of him a bride
[11:22] and it doesn't stop there and now the
[11:25] bride is living on the earth and what is
[11:27] it that's coming out of her it's the
[11:29] very same life of God that issued forth
[11:33] out of him in the beginning the very
[11:34] same Life of Christ manifested inside
[11:37] you and me as we look into the mirror of
[11:39] the word and molded day by day we begin
[11:42] to show forth that life that was in the
[11:44] beginning it was God condescending but I
[11:47] have to ask the question what was the
[11:49] point of all of that Jesus placed
[11:52] himself in in front of this woman and
[11:54] God comes down God condescends now all
[11:56] the way down what was the point of his
[11:59] descent
[12:00] if I may ask you as God comes down
[12:03] through through we follow this this
[12:05] chain all the way through creation God
[12:07] coming down I say the point of his
[12:09] descent was your Ascent with him back up
[12:13] the point of God coming down was so that
[12:15] he could reach those thoughts that he
[12:17] had in the beginning he needed an Avenue
[12:19] he needed a way to see you in the way
[12:21] that you are this evening with all of
[12:23] your flaws and failures God is okay with
[12:26] that God likes that God likes to mold
[12:28] you God likes to mold You In His Image
[12:30] he made every one of you a certain way
[12:32] for a reason you can think all the way
[12:34] back to the beginning when he had you on
[12:36] his mind he knew the way that you were
[12:38] he knew your personality who he knew
[12:40] what you would like and dislike he knew
[12:42] what your struggles and failures would
[12:43] be but yet somehow you're sitting here
[12:45] this evening yet somehow this evening he
[12:48] wants to see you he wants to know you
[12:50] what was the purpose of this great
[12:51] condescension it was so that God could
[12:54] come down and take you by the hand and
[12:56] then he could Ascend with you that God
[12:58] could bring you to where he is
[13:02] brother Brandon and things that are to
[13:04] be he references a scripture I wonder if
[13:06] you could put that scripture up for me
[13:08] it was in John 17 verse 24
[13:12] why did God condescend why did he come
[13:14] down let me read this quote first and
[13:16] then I'll read the scripture he says
[13:18] Jesus only asks for one thing in his
[13:21] prayer to the father you know what that
[13:23] was one thing after all of his
[13:26] sacrifices that he did here on Earth the
[13:28] life that he lived the path that he
[13:30] walked he asked for one thing
[13:32] God coming all the way down out of glory
[13:35] and he asks for one thing that where I
[13:37] am they may be also he asked for our
[13:40] fellowship that's the only thing he
[13:42] asked the father in The Prayer here in
[13:43] John 17 your companionship forever
[13:47] God placing himself in your path but why
[13:50] father I will that they also whom thou
[13:54] has given me be with me where I am that
[13:56] they may behold my glory which thou Hast
[13:58] given me for thou loves me before the
[14:01] foundation of the world and God loved
[14:03] you so much that in this entire prayer
[14:05] the only thing he would ask and seek of
[14:08] the father is that you would be with him
[14:10] the only reason that he wanted to place
[14:12] himself in your path was so that you
[14:14] could be with him when God reached down
[14:16] for you when he reached down his hand
[14:18] for me and you saw the blood you saw the
[14:20] sacrifice that he made that was the plan
[14:22] of God unfolding that's what he had in
[14:24] the back part of his mind that's what he
[14:26] wanted that was his purpose of
[14:27] descending so that you could go back up
[14:29] with him
[14:31] he said I've severed you from other
[14:33] people that ye should be mine
[14:35] God is jealous over you God wants you
[14:37] God desires your fellowship above all
[14:41] when you talk about prayer prayer is
[14:43] pouring your heart out before God in
[14:45] John chapter 17 is the prayer of Jesus
[14:47] Jesus is pouring his heart out and the
[14:50] Very desire of his heart
[14:53] is that he might have you
[14:56] God working all of this through creation
[14:58] so that you could be sitting here
[15:01] tonight and God wants your fellowship
[15:03] above all
[15:05] found the book of Isaiah chapter 45
[15:08] verse 7. it says this I formed the light
[15:11] and create Darkness I make peace and
[15:14] create evil I the Lord do all these
[15:17] things
[15:18] out here the woman found herself in this
[15:20] situation and you might find yourself in
[15:22] a similar situation whether for yourself
[15:24] or maybe you're like this woman seeking
[15:26] for your daughter seeking for your son
[15:28] or a family member you might find
[15:30] yourself in that situation and wonder
[15:31] why why are all these things happening
[15:34] to me is God in control but he says I
[15:36] form the light and create Darkness I
[15:39] make peace and create evil I the Lord do
[15:42] all these things and that's a hard thing
[15:43] for us to grasp we look through our life
[15:45] we see all the trials the tribulations
[15:47] all the things that we've been through
[15:49] all the hurt that we've been through all
[15:51] the people we thought were angels that
[15:52] weren't Angels they heard us we thought
[15:54] they were Christians but they but they
[15:56] still hurt us and God allowed all of it
[15:58] let me read a few different versions of
[16:00] that same verse it says I make light and
[16:03] create Darkness I make blessings and
[16:05] create disasters I the Lord do all these
[16:08] things I form light and create Darkness
[16:11] I make well-being and create Calamity I
[16:14] call his blessings I send the troubles I
[16:17] create the calamity
[16:19] and yet still we're troubled and yet
[16:21] still we're our faith flutters and yet
[16:23] still we're worried about whether God
[16:25] can meet our needs or not and here he's
[16:27] I create darkness and I make peace and I
[16:30] create evil and now you can look back on
[16:32] your life now your worry can turn into
[16:34] peace now you can know that God is in
[16:37] control the darkness that I see God
[16:39] allowed the peace that I feel God gave
[16:42] it to me the evil that I see God has
[16:45] allowed it he claims all the credit for
[16:47] it he says I the Lord do all these
[16:50] things it was no man that could ever
[16:52] seek God it was God's election God does
[16:55] the choosing
[16:57] it's a hard concept for us to understand
[17:00] now how many of us are married in here
[17:02] and you remember when you were getting
[17:04] married to your sweetheart and how you
[17:07] felt and how you longed to be with her
[17:10] and your your heart's desire was to to
[17:12] just be in her presence to be with her
[17:15] well now you understand the way that God
[17:18] looks at you
[17:19] that he wanted you he wanted your
[17:21] presence now you understand the desire
[17:23] that you would have to your sweetheart
[17:25] to want to be with her to want to know
[17:27] everything about her that's the same
[17:28] desire that God had towards you
[17:31] and then how many how many have had a
[17:34] newborn baby and how many have held that
[17:36] newborn baby and all of a sudden you
[17:38] understood the mystery of election why
[17:41] because you looked at that baby and
[17:43] there was nothing the baby could ever do
[17:45] wrong that would cause you to not love
[17:46] it anymore there was nothing the baby
[17:49] could do to ever stop your unconditional
[17:52] love and suddenly you know
[17:54] what election is what election means
[17:57] when you hold your own God in Simplicity
[17:59] God's showing you his very heart that he
[18:02] wants you to be where he is
[18:05] it's always God seeking the man and not
[18:08] man seeking God
[18:10] now back to this woman she says behold
[18:12] the woman of Canaan now Canaan comes
[18:14] from a very uh a bad place here it says
[18:18] in the Bible uh one he was one of the
[18:20] sons of Noah and I read also he said
[18:23] curse be Canaan so right from the get-go
[18:25] her genealogy was cursed she had no
[18:28] approach to him and you know in the Old
[18:30] Testament genealogy was everything to
[18:33] them where you come from who was your
[18:35] father and your father's father and yet
[18:36] she had no approach in that way she had
[18:39] no approach through those means she
[18:41] couldn't go back in her lineage she
[18:43] couldn't describe her genealogy there
[18:44] was nothing good there it was just like
[18:46] you and me we were nothing good we had
[18:48] nothing to offer him and yet he came yet
[18:50] he presented himself to us yet he
[18:53] offered his hand in Fellowship yet he
[18:55] came down and shed his blood for us
[18:56] there was nothing in our genealogy
[18:58] nothing in our flesh that was good
[19:00] enough but God still came down the
[19:02] prophet said God is not known by knowing
[19:04] genealogy it's by neology you want to
[19:07] know God do what this woman do it get on
[19:09] your knees and worship him God is not
[19:11] known by genealogy it's by neology it's
[19:14] not by the ways of man it's not by The
[19:16] Works of the flesh it's what he's done
[19:18] for us and he placed himself within our
[19:21] reach
[19:22] now it's whosoever believeth in him
[19:25] should not perish now it's whosoever
[19:27] liveth and believeth in me shall never
[19:29] die he was made the curse that the curse
[19:31] might be removed from us now the curse
[19:34] is no more now we can receive the
[19:36] blessings of Abraham that he took on the
[19:38] curse he became the curse for us don't
[19:40] let the devil tell you that you're
[19:42] cursed don't let the devil tell you that
[19:43] all these that you deserve all these
[19:45] things that are happening to you that
[19:47] everything is going wrong for you don't
[19:48] let the devil tell you that Christ
[19:50] became the curse don't let the devil
[19:52] tell you uh that you've been cursed
[19:54] because you don't believe it this
[19:56] person's such and such way don't let
[19:58] anyone else tell you that because God's
[20:00] saying that I took the curse for you no
[20:02] one can call my bride curse I took on
[20:05] the curse I became cursed now the
[20:07] blessings of Abraham can come to them
[20:10] God is wanting so badly to reveal
[20:12] himself to you and I God is wanting so
[20:15] badly for our fellowship you can think
[20:17] of uh when those three men came to
[20:20] Abraham in the tent uh brother Brown
[20:23] said that they had dust on their clothes
[20:26] so here come these three men to the tent
[20:28] where Abraham was and he of course
[20:31] receives them and they had dust all over
[20:33] their clothes they looked like they had
[20:35] come from a Strange Land they they
[20:37] looked like they were passing through to
[20:39] go somewhere they looked like sojourners
[20:42] that's familiar Abraham was a Sojourner
[20:45] and God presented himself to him in such
[20:48] a way that Abraham the Sojourner could
[20:50] recognize a Sojourner and call him Lord
[20:52] he had dust all over his clothes he
[20:54] looked just like him it was a way that
[20:56] he could see and recognize and
[20:58] understand him and Abraham knew right
[20:59] away that's the Lord
[21:02] when Joshua the captain of Israel was
[21:04] standing there by Jericho he was he was
[21:07] looking he prophesied he was
[21:08] strategizing he was trying to figure out
[21:10] he how he was going to go and strike
[21:12] these rocks when somebody appeared to
[21:14] him he said no Joshua you're not going
[21:16] to strike the Rocks like Moses you're
[21:18] going to speak to these rocks that's how
[21:19] they're going to fall and he appeared to
[21:21] hear was the captain of the Lord's host
[21:23] a pre-figure of the Lord Jesus Christ
[21:25] and so to the general of Israel appears
[21:28] a general in a form that he could
[21:29] understand and that he could appreciate
[21:31] and know and so too the general comes
[21:33] the general to the captain comes the
[21:35] captain
[21:37] now we can think now when Jesus is on
[21:39] the earth uh he said who do Sons the
[21:41] sons of men say that I the son of man am
[21:44] and they say well you some say you are a
[21:47] prophet you know you are Elias yeah
[21:49] Jeremiah so just one of the prophets why
[21:51] they they could not receive him as
[21:53] anything more than that to the sons of
[21:57] men he appeared as a son of man and
[21:59] that's all they could ever receive him
[22:01] as was a son of man a prophet but when
[22:04] he asked Peter the question he said whom
[22:06] do men say that I have the son of man am
[22:08] he said Thou Art the Christ the son of
[22:10] the Living God why could Peter recognize
[22:12] and understand that how could he know
[22:14] that because he was a Son of God that's
[22:17] why the Revelation could come down to
[22:19] him because he already was a Son of God
[22:21] that's why he could see him as the Son
[22:24] of God and recognize and know that for
[22:26] Revelation comes by God from above it's
[22:28] not given by any man but God knew he was
[22:31] a Son of God so he could answer the
[22:33] question you are the Son of God so now I
[22:37] want to ask you the question you are the
[22:39] bride of Christ
[22:40] to the Sojourner he appeared as a
[22:42] Sojourner to the general he appeared as
[22:44] a general to a Son of God Peter he
[22:47] appeared as the Son of God Peter could
[22:49] recognize him so what will he appear to
[22:52] the Bride As
[22:54] none other than bridegroom saying come
[22:57] to me I desire your fellowship I am the
[22:59] bridegroom that's why God could reveal
[23:02] himself as bridegroom in this day it was
[23:04] a likeness it was something mirroring
[23:06] back it was I don't know a deep calleth
[23:08] to the deep it was something on the
[23:10] inside drawing us now we can recognize
[23:13] and know him as bridegroom why it speaks
[23:16] through what you are it speaks to speaks
[23:18] to what God has elected you to be he's
[23:20] elected lady
[23:24] God's blood is not a treatment for sin
[23:27] God's blood is the cure for sin
[23:31] too often we treat his blood as a
[23:33] treatment I've got a little sin in my
[23:35] life Lord forgive me okay then we run to
[23:37] church but no God's blood is there to
[23:39] eradicate the sin from our life what's
[23:41] the point of it look at how badly he
[23:43] wanted fellowship with us and yet we'll
[23:45] have things in our life that we're
[23:47] hiding in the corners in the closets you
[23:49] know how we do as humans we have things
[23:51] that we try to hide from God as if we
[23:53] could hide anything from God but what is
[23:55] it we're only hurting ourselves we're
[23:57] hurting our fellowship with God God is
[23:59] wanting fellowship with us and here we
[24:01] are creating a barrier creating a wall
[24:03] and God is saying my blood is not a
[24:05] treatment for those sin my blood is the
[24:08] cure the double cure I say tonight if
[24:10] you have anything on your heart that's
[24:12] between that Fellowship between you and
[24:14] God let it go tonight but what use is it
[24:17] what how does it compare to a fellowship
[24:19] with the almighty God God is calling you
[24:21] back he came down so that you can go up
[24:24] with him I think of when brother Branham
[24:27] described that eagle cry that went out
[24:28] over the Barnyard we all know the story
[24:30] very well and he called come out of her
[24:33] my people but she had to do something
[24:35] she flapped her wings
[24:38] God is calling you come out
[24:41] I remember in the Book of Revelations
[24:42] chapter four he called John come up
[24:46] now verse 22 Matthew 15 verse 22.
[24:57] not going to hold you along tonight
[24:59] see how far we get in about 45 minutes
[25:03] Matthew 15 22 it says
[25:06] let me read it from here
[25:08] and behold the woman of Canaan came out
[25:11] of the same coast and Cried unto him
[25:13] saying have mercy on me O Lord thou son
[25:15] of David my daughter is grievously vexed
[25:18] with the devil now notice that she came
[25:20] out of the same coast God places himself
[25:23] first within our reach but there's still
[25:26] a part for us to play I believe you're
[25:28] playing it tonight you've come here
[25:29] you've come to receive from him God
[25:31] while he's passing by Reach Out And
[25:33] Touch the Lord he's the one that gave
[25:34] you the opportunity he's the one that
[25:36] said where two or three are gathered I'd
[25:38] be right there in their in their midst
[25:40] and if you believe that then Christ is
[25:42] here so you can receive from him behold
[25:44] the woman of Canaan came out of the same
[25:46] Coast I'm asking you tonight step out of
[25:48] the place that you built for yourself in
[25:51] your mind step out of the mental battles
[25:53] that you had coming into service tonight
[25:54] step out of it and come out of the same
[25:57] Coast Christ came right up to the
[25:58] borders of Tire inside and there he
[26:01] stood he knew someone was coming and
[26:02] Christ is here in the building tonight
[26:04] he knows somebody's coming he knows that
[26:06] it's taken a while for them to break
[26:08] through the mental barriers he knows
[26:09] you've had a hard day he knows things
[26:11] have happened to you that shouldn't have
[26:12] happened to you but he's waiting for you
[26:14] to come out of the same Coast Christ is
[26:16] waiting for you to arise for you to
[26:18] stand up and take hold of the promise
[26:20] Christ is waiting for you to have great
[26:22] faith
[26:23] God comes down he does everything that
[26:25] he needs to he makes all the
[26:27] preparations he lays all the groundworks
[26:29] he places himself within our reach and
[26:31] he's just asking you reach out now and
[26:33] touch the Lord
[26:35] reach out the Lord takes pleasure in
[26:37] them that fear Him in those that hope in
[26:39] his Mercy
[26:41] I don't know what else I'd like to Hope
[26:43] in
[26:44] those that hope in his mercies here was
[26:46] the woman she was hoping in his Mercy
[26:48] she had nothing else to approach him
[26:50] with verse 23 it says he answered her
[26:53] not a word and his disciples came and
[26:55] besought him saying send her away for
[26:58] she cryeth after us
[27:00] will we trust when there's no response
[27:03] from God we always try to take Eternal
[27:05] things and eternal thoughts and somehow
[27:08] force it into our Earthly timeline it's
[27:11] a flaw of man we all do it we we try to
[27:14] get God to operate on our timeline God
[27:17] operates on his own timeline God does
[27:20] what he wants when he wants it's our job
[27:22] to pray for his will and to align
[27:24] ourselves with his will that's what
[27:26] prayer is we think prayer is going and
[27:28] accomplishing what we want through
[27:29] prayer prayer is realigning our own will
[27:32] to the will of God that's what prayer is
[27:35] now when God says no what will we do
[27:38] will we stand and be perseverant We
[27:41] Trust in his word will we know that he
[27:43] has a plan where we know that God knows
[27:45] what he's doing or we we lose Faith back
[27:48] off you know let time go by that's
[27:50] that's one of the biggest kills for us
[27:52] as time goes by and we think that God is
[27:55] not able to bring to pass his promise
[27:57] because time went by for us
[27:59] at that time that goes by for us is
[28:02] nothing to God
[28:04] it's a test of our faith
[28:07] the prophet says this
[28:09] you might not know it but just hang on
[28:12] when you are sure that you've met all
[28:15] the requirements when you know that
[28:17] you've done everything that you know to
[28:19] do and laid yourself before God there's
[28:21] only one thing to do hang on to his
[28:23] promise and stay there
[28:25] stay there tarry there stay there a
[28:28] while
[28:29] stay in the presence of God stay until
[28:32] you know his will for sure that you're
[28:35] absolutely certain that it's his will
[28:37] stay there don't be discouraged by by
[28:40] silence God is in the silence too God is
[28:43] in the loud noise remember Elijah there
[28:45] God come down in the thunderings and the
[28:47] Lightnings and then eventually he come
[28:49] down in a still small voice but what if
[28:51] Elijah had left at the earthquake part
[28:53] portion what if he hadn't waited God
[28:55] comes down after a while and that's
[28:57] still small voice
[29:01] verse 25 I love this
[29:03] then came she and worshiped him saying
[29:06] Lord help me
[29:08] son of David didn't work didn't it
[29:10] didn't didn't catch his attention she
[29:12] said Lord help me she couldn't figure
[29:14] out any words these words are so simple
[29:17] now she just came and she said Lord help
[29:20] me it was all she knew how to say and
[29:22] I'm telling you this evening that you
[29:23] don't need any complicated words you
[29:25] don't need to put together a sermon to
[29:27] reach God all you need to do is reach
[29:29] out and say Lord help me Lord help me
[29:32] what else can I say cry out to the Lord
[29:34] and say Lord help me God Honors that God
[29:37] listens to that he's the same yesterday
[29:39] today and forever and if he'll hear her
[29:41] saying Lord help me he'll hear you
[29:43] saying Lord helped me and I love that
[29:46] she was worshiping him when he when she
[29:48] said it there's something about worship
[29:50] worship catches the heart of God there
[29:53] is something about worship the woman
[29:55] when she brought her Alabaster Box and
[29:58] her oil and she began to Pour It On
[30:00] Jesus feet what was everyone doing while
[30:02] she was doing that they were pointing
[30:05] they were coming with accusations they
[30:07] wanted to make accusations against her
[30:09] for who she was and the life that she
[30:10] had lived but yet here she was at Jesus
[30:13] feet worshiping with her tears her here
[30:15] down messy don't be afraid to get messy
[30:17] before God don't be afraid to just put
[30:19] aside all of your reservations and
[30:21] Worship the Lord don't be afraid of what
[30:23] people are going to think of you if you
[30:25] Worship the Lord You're worshiping the
[30:26] great Creator you're worshiping the one
[30:28] who saved you there's something special
[30:30] about worshiping him why because when
[30:33] she was down on her knees and worshiping
[30:35] him what happened there was no
[30:37] accusation that could be brought against
[30:39] her Jesus turned the accusation on its
[30:42] head and it says Simon I have ought
[30:43] against thee he he was taught he
[30:45] redirected it to him while he was trying
[30:48] to talk about the woman on her knees at
[30:50] his feet I'll tell you if you've sinned
[30:52] if you've missed the Mark if if you've
[30:54] done anything wrong come to the feet of
[30:56] Jesus and worship him come to church and
[30:58] worship God don't let that stop you from
[31:00] coming in these doors get before God get
[31:03] in his presence start to cry wipe his
[31:05] feet with it with your tears and you're
[31:07] here worship God because when you
[31:09] worship him he takes control of the rest
[31:11] and he says no you're not going to make
[31:13] accusations against her now she's
[31:15] worshiping me and that's when you're in
[31:17] the service there and you begin to
[31:19] worship God you repent of your sins in
[31:21] the service and say Lord I've done wrong
[31:23] forgive me Lord I've walked the wrong
[31:25] way Lord forgive me I've been with the
[31:27] wrong people Lord forgive me and you
[31:29] begin to worship and lift your hands and
[31:31] there the Devil comes around and he
[31:33] tries to accuse but just today I heard
[31:35] you say just I saw you with him I saw
[31:38] you over there I saw you look at that on
[31:40] your phone and the Devil comes with the
[31:42] accusations but you've cleared it up
[31:43] with the Lord You're worshiping and as
[31:45] you lift your hands and begin to Worship
[31:47] the Lord will not entertain those
[31:49] accusations the Lord will say not right
[31:51] now hush devil hush she's worshiping me
[31:58] [Applause]
[32:00] hush devil My bride is worshiping me and
[32:04] having fellowship with her right now
[32:05] this was my reason for Jesus departing
[32:08] out of the coast and going Vents and
[32:10] placing himself within your reach
[32:12] tonight
[32:14] amen Psalms 34 18 it says this the Lord
[32:17] is nigh unto them that are of a broken
[32:20] heart and saveth such as be of a
[32:22] contrite spirit
[32:24] now that the the scripture also says the
[32:27] sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit a
[32:30] broken and a contrite heart o God thou
[32:33] will not despise that was Psalms 51 17.
[32:37] a broken and a contrite heart o God thou
[32:41] Wilt not despise you know what the word
[32:43] contrite means it means to break to
[32:45] bruise to rub or to wear literally warn
[32:50] or bruised Brokenhearted deeply affected
[32:54] with grief and sorrow
[32:56] for having offended God does that sound
[32:58] like any of us tonight have any of us
[33:00] ever had our heart rubbed bruised
[33:03] battered
[33:05] you put yourself out there we thought
[33:07] that you know thought everything would
[33:09] be taken care of and yet still you were
[33:11] hurt
[33:11] yet still hurt come to you yet still
[33:13] you've been rubbed the wrong way yet
[33:15] still you've been bruised the sacrifices
[33:18] of God are a broken Spirit a broken and
[33:22] a contrite heart a bruised heart God
[33:25] won't despise that God loves that if you
[33:28] have a bruised heart tonight you're in
[33:30] the right place this is the place where
[33:32] God can come and address that bruised
[33:34] heart but you've got to come you've got
[33:35] to worship Him
[33:37] you've got to put it all out before and
[33:39] lift your hands and surrender It All to
[33:41] Jesus
[33:42] the prophet was in a position one time
[33:45] where his his wife and his their baby
[33:48] had passed away and just one of the
[33:51] lowest points of his life and you know
[33:53] what he said he said I tied myself to
[33:56] his word
[33:57] and his word was holy
[34:00] he is my absolute I found out all these
[34:03] other things may fail but Christ can
[34:05] never fail everything else in your life
[34:07] can fail every word of man can fail
[34:09] everything you put together of your own
[34:11] thinking will fail but Christ will never
[34:14] fail if you'll tie yourself into that
[34:16] absolute if you'll tie yourself to him
[34:18] Christ will never fail now your Anchor
[34:21] Holds Somewhere Beyond the Veil it's not
[34:23] even of this world now nothing of this
[34:25] world can tug you I use this example a
[34:28] lot that uh if I have a tug of war with
[34:31] somebody and he's much bigger than me of
[34:34] course he's going to win that tug of war
[34:36] match but if I take my rope and I wrap
[34:39] it around something really big really
[34:41] sturdy behind me and then we have the
[34:43] tug of war contest there's no way that
[34:46] he can move me because I'm not relying
[34:48] on My Own Strength I'm tied to something
[34:50] behind me and when you're tied to an
[34:52] anchor behind the veil now you're tied
[34:55] to something that the devil can't move
[34:57] now you're tied to something different
[34:58] that's not of this world now you're tied
[35:01] to something that he knows nothing about
[35:02] that he can't touch that he can't move
[35:05] now you become like a tree planted by
[35:07] the rivers of water
[35:09] Brandon was asked he said well during
[35:12] that time uh when you were going through
[35:14] all that loss well that's that that
[35:16] searing loss that terrible loss uh did
[35:19] you keep your religion during that time
[35:22] he said no I didn't keep my religion My
[35:25] Religion kept me what I was tied to kept
[35:29] me and if you'll be tied to Christ
[35:30] tonight that's what will do the whole
[35:32] thing that's what will keep you in your
[35:34] time of trouble
[35:35] glory to God
[35:37] sometimes praise is a real sacrifice it
[35:41] costs you something
[35:42] but God loves When Praise costs you
[35:44] something
[35:45] you go through all the trouble in your
[35:47] life and you wonder man you come in
[35:49] battered and bruised on a Wednesday
[35:50] night God loves the sacrifice of praise
[35:54] when you lift your hand despite all
[35:56] that's going on you lift your hand as an
[35:59] overcomer and God Smiles down on that
[36:03] she said truth Lord Matthew 15 and 27
[36:07] truth Lord yet the dogs eat of the
[36:10] crumbs which fall from their master's
[36:12] table now we're getting into it she said
[36:15] truth Lord and now we we talked a little
[36:17] bit about her background she was a
[36:19] Canaanite Tish woman she was they call
[36:21] her the siren Phoenician Mark calls are
[36:23] a Greek obviously her background was not
[36:25] the Jewish background
[36:27] so all the words she had is the word
[36:30] that Jesus is given to her right then
[36:32] and there that's all she had was the
[36:34] word of the master right then and there
[36:37] in her season in her time in her day
[36:39] whatever truth the Lord would give to
[36:42] her that's what she would have to go and
[36:44] say truth Lord she had to respect what
[36:47] he was saying and everything that God
[36:49] supplies to you in your time of need we
[36:52] say truth Lord everything that God has
[36:54] supplied to us in this day we say truth
[36:57] Lord and we latch on to that why because
[36:59] God's word won't return unto him void he
[37:02] sends out his word and he's expecting
[37:04] you to grab a hold to it and to tie
[37:06] yourself into that and then his word
[37:08] won't return to him void his word will
[37:10] come right back to him and when it comes
[37:12] back to him what's tied to it you
[37:14] because you believed in his word his
[37:16] word won't return to him void and I say
[37:19] all the truth that God provides to you
[37:21] is enough truth to get you where you
[37:23] need to be all the truth that God gave
[37:25] to her in that moment was enough truth
[37:26] for her to get her the healing for her
[37:29] daughter everything that he said to her
[37:30] was enough it was truth everything that
[37:33] he provided to her everything that he
[37:35] said to her in this situation it was all
[37:37] she had and she said truth Lord and
[37:40] everything that God has provided to us
[37:41] in this day by this message we say truth
[37:44] Lord we say thank you Lord God and it's
[37:47] enough it's enough to get us from where
[37:49] we need to be from here into a Rapture
[37:52] God doesn't provide things haphazardly
[37:54] when he provides a word to us it's
[37:56] enough to get us where we need to be it
[37:58] was enough to get her the healing that
[38:00] she needed for her daughter and the word
[38:02] that he's given us in this day is enough
[38:04] to get us in a Rapture more than enough
[38:06] I'd say
[38:08] that's the way you want to get God be on
[38:10] his hands every morning every night
[38:12] every day all the time constantly just
[38:15] keep seeking keep asking keep knocking
[38:17] don't just knock a little while and get
[38:19] tired and go away just keep standing
[38:21] there Lord I'm here I'm not going to
[38:23] leave I'm on your hands I'm going to
[38:25] stay right here you getting tired of
[38:26] listening I'm having a great time
[38:28] knocking because I know you're coming
[38:30] Lord are you are you getting tired of
[38:32] listening because I'm gonna keep
[38:33] knocking I'm gonna keep knocking by my
[38:35] prayer I'm Gonna Keep Believing I'm
[38:37] going to keep believing the woman kept
[38:39] believing for her daughter I'm going to
[38:41] believe until God gives me an answer he
[38:43] says you've got to be willing to take
[38:45] crumbs how many of us can put our pride
[38:47] aside enough to take Crumbs from God but
[38:50] I'll tell you what you do you take those
[38:51] crumbs you take one crumb today and then
[38:54] tomorrow you take the other crumb sister
[38:55] and then you take enough crumbs and
[38:57] you'll smush them all together and
[38:58] you'll have your loaf of bread you've
[39:00] got to be willing to take God take
[39:01] crumbs God will do what he said he will
[39:04] do if we'll hold on and believe
[39:07] I'll be willing to take crumbs Faith
[39:10] tracks to the word of God faith Finds
[39:12] Its Eternal resting place on the word of
[39:14] God when we place the word of God above
[39:16] our situation above our thoughts above
[39:19] our trials then God can come and take
[39:21] over now we're on the right track now we
[39:23] can get moving in the right direction
[39:25] now we can set the wheels of God In
[39:27] Motion because our faith is on the right
[39:29] track our faith is in the right thing
[39:31] it's in the word of God it's the word
[39:33] that will do the work only the word can
[39:35] do the work we can't do the work
[39:37] ourselves we've got to say truth Lord
[39:38] truth to his word truth to his Bible we
[39:41] say truth Lord we thank you for your
[39:43] word we worship you forward and we rely
[39:45] on it and the word will do the pushing
[39:47] the word is like those big ships that
[39:49] get up by the North Pole and they they
[39:51] break the ice so the other ships can
[39:53] pass by pass behind it the word is what
[39:55] goes out in front of us and does the
[39:57] Conquering we just believe in it we just
[39:59] hold it out in front of us and God does
[40:01] the work and we walk in the path that he
[40:03] has made
[40:05] how would we know any of the heroes of
[40:07] the faith in Hebrews chapter 11 unless
[40:09] they had Faith how would we know of
[40:11] their faith unless they had trials and
[40:13] how is God going to know of your faith
[40:15] how's your faith going to be tested
[40:16] unless you come to a situation where it
[40:19] needs to be tested where what's inside
[40:21] of you has to come out where what God
[40:23] had thought of you in the beginning and
[40:25] he wanted to manifest out through of you
[40:27] out through you and bring through you
[40:29] bring his life through how would we know
[40:31] that unless we had a trial how would he
[40:33] bring that out of US unless he sent
[40:35] something our way that just wouldn't go
[40:36] right to see our reaction to see what it
[40:39] would bring out of us
[40:43] sometimes you've just got to believe
[40:45] God's word you've got to have faith
[40:47] you've got to hold on God's going to
[40:49] throw you into situations where you
[40:51] don't know what's going on you don't
[40:53] know how you got here in the first place
[40:54] what is happening it's kind of like
[40:57] shamgar right he was there he was on his
[41:00] farm and then
[41:01] he heard the drums coming you know he
[41:04] heard them March and they were coming to
[41:05] steal his crops again he didn't have
[41:07] time to think he didn't have time to
[41:08] train all he had time to do was have
[41:10] faith and believe that God would honor
[41:13] his promises to him he ran over to the
[41:15] case that it was it was one of those
[41:17] emergency cases it said break glass in
[41:19] case of philistine Invasion he broke the
[41:21] glass he took the ox goat and he went
[41:23] running and he started smashing him he
[41:25] was smashing him he was smashing the
[41:27] Devils he had Faith he didn't have time
[41:28] but what was on the inside of him
[41:30] started coming out
[41:34] God knows there's something by election
[41:36] on the inside of you and he's wanting to
[41:39] draw that out of you it was his plan
[41:41] from the beginning he was wanting to
[41:43] draw those attributes out of you
[41:45] why God God will never be alone from
[41:48] this point on God will always have you
[41:51] his attributes with him in heaven
[41:55] how much time we got amen
[41:58] Matthew 15 and 28 it says Jesus answered
[42:02] and said unto her o woman great is thy
[42:05] faith be it unto thee even as thou wilt
[42:11] her daughter was made whole from that
[42:13] very hour
[42:15] something about this woman
[42:17] caused Jesus to say great is thy faith
[42:20] I I love this because it doesn't say
[42:23] that she had faith it said great is thy
[42:27] faith and think about this for a minute
[42:29] because God is the one he had so much
[42:32] faith that he spoke his own word in the
[42:35] beginning and he believed it and it
[42:37] caused creation to come into existence
[42:40] so if anyone knows the full Measure of
[42:43] Faith it's God right
[42:46] he knows what maximum Faith Can Do speak
[42:48] a universe into existence and he knows
[42:51] what little faith is because he he was
[42:54] rebuking the disciples ye of little
[42:56] faith and so God says to this woman
[42:58] great is thy faith in other words he's
[43:01] saying the approach that you've had the
[43:03] way that you believe when you had
[43:04] nothing else you still believe the word
[43:06] that I gave to you you were persistent
[43:08] you were persevered and God would say
[43:11] that is great faith the one who held the
[43:14] measuring stick of Faith knew what kind
[43:17] of Faith lay inside of her knew what
[43:18] kind of Faith he was seeing and he said
[43:20] to her great is thy faith she was
[43:22] reflecting something back to him that he
[43:24] understood that he knew that he could
[43:26] recognize she came from another place he
[43:29] came from another place she came not for
[43:32] herself she came for her daughter he
[43:34] came down for him from Heaven not for
[43:36] himself but to save his sons and
[43:38] daughters she became the lowest she
[43:40] became despised and rejected she made
[43:43] herself as low as she could go and God
[43:46] came down and he took on and he'd and he
[43:48] donned an Earthly robe and he was beaten
[43:50] he was bruised the crowns were put on
[43:52] his head and he was made the lowest that
[43:54] he could be made and with his stripes we
[43:57] were healed he God came down and took on
[43:59] the lowest form that he could take and
[44:02] die on a Roman crucifixion
[44:05] but something about this woman she
[44:07] couldn't walk away she wouldn't walk
[44:08] away why the fate of her daughter rested
[44:11] on it I told you about that
[44:13] unconditional love of your newborn baby
[44:15] every parent knows it that they would
[44:17] not walk away they'd rather die than to
[44:19] walk away knowing that they could obtain
[44:21] the salvation for their child and when
[44:23] Christ had that cross on his back and he
[44:26] was lucking it up calvary's hill he was
[44:28] thinking of you he was thinking of those
[44:30] attributes he had in his mind and he was
[44:32] saying I can't walk away so when this
[44:34] woman is in front of him and she is
[44:36] expressing this faith in front of him
[44:38] and she's saying Truth Good there is
[44:41] some desire some pull in her heart that
[44:43] he she could not he could not shoo her
[44:45] away no matter what he would do her
[44:47] faith was persevered she was holding on
[44:49] for someone else and that's what God
[44:51] came to do he came to climb calvary's
[44:54] Hill he was holding on for someone else
[44:56] as those hands were spread wide he was
[44:58] holding on for someone else he was
[45:00] holding on for you and for me that's why
[45:03] God came and when she came into
[45:04] displayed this faith in front of him he
[45:07] recognized it and said that's great
[45:09] faith that's what I came to do that's
[45:11] that's that's my plan that's why I'm
[45:13] here and he saw that inside of her
[45:15] something in this Gentile woman and she
[45:18] said and he said great is thy faith
[45:22] she wouldn't walk away because her child
[45:24] was at stake neither would he walk away
[45:27] because his children his attributes that
[45:29] he wanted to to commune to Fellowship
[45:31] was at stake that's what he wanted there
[45:34] was no way that he was going to come
[45:35] down off of that cross I think of Moses
[45:38] uh when when they when God told him uh
[45:42] raise your hands up before the
[45:43] battlefield and if you raise your hands
[45:45] up like this the children of Israel will
[45:48] prevail and they will win the battle and
[45:50] so Moses hands started getting tired
[45:52] they had to come and hold up his hands
[45:54] they didn't want his hands to slip I'm
[45:57] sure they stood right under they used
[45:58] all their mind make sure that his hands
[46:00] are up so that we can win this battle
[46:02] make sure that the hands are up
[46:04] but God put Christ on the cross one day
[46:07] and his hands were there on the cross
[46:08] and God said I can't afford to lose this
[46:11] battle I'm not going to lose this battle
[46:13] these hands cannot come down if these
[46:16] hands come down then we lose I lose my
[46:18] children I lose my attributes these
[46:20] hands cannot come down so he put those
[46:22] hands on the cross and he nailed them
[46:24] there because he said this battle I
[46:26] cannot afford to lose this battle I will
[46:28] not lose because my children are at
[46:31] stake and the woman was displaying the
[46:33] same kind of faith when God honored her
[46:35] she was displaying his faith right back
[46:37] in front of him and when you hold his
[46:39] very words right back in front of him
[46:41] God can only do can't do anything but
[46:43] recognize it it's his own word it's what
[46:46] he was thinking back in the beginning
[46:48] his word is what was planted in the
[46:50] beginning and now it's come all the way
[46:51] down through time spiraling down and
[46:53] it's coming out inside of a people and
[46:56] when God sees that when he sees his word
[46:58] lived inside of his people now he's
[47:00] going to come back down now he's gonna
[47:02] like we'll meet like deep we'll call to
[47:04] the Deep now he will come and you'll be
[47:06] able to recognize him because you'll be
[47:08] in that likeness of the word
[47:11] where the carcasses the Eagles will be
[47:13] gathered
[47:15] we call that the word right where the
[47:18] word is the Eagles will be gathered
[47:20] so when Christ returns the word
[47:23] presented to us
[47:25] we we can't do anything but be drawn to
[47:29] him be drawn right out of these bodies
[47:31] into a new body why because we're being
[47:34] presented with something that we have
[47:36] been magnetized to so when he appears in
[47:38] the skies what's on the inside will just
[47:40] draw us right out of these bodies and
[47:42] into our new body
[47:45] she showed him something that he
[47:46] recognized
[47:48] she made herself of no reputation the
[47:51] Bible says
[47:52] that he made himself of no reputation
[47:55] and took upon him the form of a servant
[47:57] and was made in the likeness of men
[48:00] and being found in fashion as a man he
[48:02] humbled himself and became obedient unto
[48:05] death
[48:08] see without even knowing it
[48:11] she was doing what he came to do
[48:14] and Jesus responded to that faith
[48:17] the word for it says it says great is
[48:21] thy faith and that word great I went
[48:23] back and tried to dig into the
[48:25] definition and some of the definitions
[48:27] here are are wide exceedingly great high
[48:31] and large and then when I came across
[48:34] this one I never shouted it said it said
[48:36] loud
[48:37] woman loud is thy faith do you have the
[48:40] kind of faith that can be loud in the
[48:42] ears of God do you have the kind of
[48:44] faith that when you go to prayer God's
[48:46] like oh he's knocking again I hear it
[48:48] it's knocking he's not going away he's
[48:50] having a good time knocking I guess I'll
[48:52] just have to go and see what he's on
[48:53] about I guess I'll just have to go down
[48:55] and answer that prayer that plea that
[48:57] honest plea where he said Lord help me
[49:00] where he ran out of words to say he
[49:02] couldn't remember the scripture he was
[49:03] in the situation it was a dire need he
[49:06] didn't know what to say and he said Lord
[49:07] help me when you do that God is the same
[49:10] yesterday today and forever whether it
[49:12] be for yourself or whether it be like
[49:14] this woman for her daughter if you'll
[49:16] cry out Lord help me God is faithful God
[49:19] is true he does the same thing it's the
[49:21] it's one of the the key stones of the
[49:23] Bible that God cannot change if you
[49:25] respond the way this woman responded if
[49:28] you have the same kind of Faith she had
[49:29] he has to respond the same way he's an
[49:32] unchangeable God
[49:35] amen I'm gonna have to close soon
[49:39] just a couple more quotes here
[49:43] the prophet says this it says great
[49:45] faith will bring you right now this has
[49:48] become one of my favorite quotes listen
[49:50] to this great faith will bring you right
[49:53] now
[49:54] a little faith
[49:55] will bring you out anyhow if you'll stay
[49:58] with it
[50:00] great faith will bring you right now in
[50:03] other words he's saying this my
[50:05] translation if you're filling up your
[50:07] pool with the garden hose it will take a
[50:10] long time but if you're filling it up
[50:12] with a fire hose then it's it'll it'll
[50:14] go a lot faster right so now if you've
[50:17] got a lot of faith you could do it right
[50:19] now you can walk on the water right now
[50:21] you could have your healing right now
[50:22] sometimes the the preaching of the word
[50:24] elevates our faith to that level where
[50:26] we're able to just stand up in our seat
[50:27] and say I receive it Lord I receive what
[50:30] you're giving to me in this service and
[50:31] you get your healing right away
[50:33] and then other times you just have to
[50:35] take that little faith that you have go
[50:38] right back home with it keep that little
[50:39] faith and keep churning with that little
[50:41] faith and it'll bring you out after a
[50:43] while he says great faith will bring you
[50:45] right now a little faith will bring you
[50:48] out anyhow if you'll stay with it
[50:51] I like that great faith will bring you
[50:53] out right now a little faith will bring
[50:55] you out anyhow if you'll stay with it
[50:57] why because that means that there's hope
[50:59] for people like me
[51:01] if I have a little bit of Faith There's
[51:02] Hope for people like me I can hope in
[51:04] his Mercy I can take the same little
[51:06] faith that I have and just keep checking
[51:08] with it just keep checking with it just
[51:10] keep going with it and God will bring it
[51:12] about God will bring it to pass in his
[51:14] own time if I'll keep that same faith
[51:16] and hold on to it
[51:18] I liken it onto uh how many has ever
[51:21] ridden a bicycle and you're riding the
[51:23] bicycle and then you start in the the
[51:25] low gears right so that it's easy to
[51:28] Pedal
[51:29] you're going fast you're going fast why
[51:30] because it's easy to pedal and then
[51:32] after a while you get going then you
[51:34] click it up a little bit you click it up
[51:36] a little bit and then suddenly your
[51:38] Crews move big strides big strikes
[51:40] you're in high gear at that point right
[51:43] so the thing is both gears will get you
[51:46] to where you need to go but one of them
[51:48] you just gotta
[51:50] and then one of them
[51:52] you know big strides so sometimes you
[51:55] have faith to take those big strides and
[51:57] it takes you all the way down the road
[51:58] if you have the strength to do it you
[52:00] have that faith and it'll take you all
[52:01] the way down the road but some of us
[52:03] were just coming up in the rear
[52:06] just pedaling along that's some of us
[52:08] that's the way that we are that's that's
[52:09] just some of us that's the faith that we
[52:11] have at this moment maybe God will raise
[52:13] it maybe God will do that for us but if
[52:15] you don't if he didn't if he doesn't you
[52:17] keep going with your little faith
[52:19] because the prophet said it'll bring you
[52:20] out anyhow
[52:23] some of us has great faith that'll just
[52:25] perform Miracles some has Faith just to
[52:28] hold on till it happens
[52:30] Amen Let me find a place to close here
[52:36] amen
[52:37] Faith takes its Eternal resting place
[52:40] upon the word of the Lord upon God's
[52:43] word which is the Bible
[52:45] Faith takes its Eternal resting place
[52:47] upon
[52:49] the word of the Lord
[52:52] I encourage you tonight to just say
[52:54] truth Lord I believe what you've spoken
[52:57] to me I believe that you can do it I
[52:59] believe that there's no supply chain
[53:01] issues with God I believe that God can
[53:03] supply the bread that I have need of in
[53:05] fact he said he was the bread that came
[53:07] down out of heaven
