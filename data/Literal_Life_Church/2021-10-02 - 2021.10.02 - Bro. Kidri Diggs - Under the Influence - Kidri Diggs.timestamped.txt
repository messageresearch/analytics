[0:02] and um
[0:06] let's just start reading that um
[0:11] verse
[0:13] seven to make the reading
[0:14] short genesis three and seven you have
[0:18] to say man
[0:20] the bible says in their eyes of them
[0:22] both were open and they knew that they
[0:24] were naked and they sold fig leaves
[0:28] together and made themselves aprons
[0:32] and they heard the voice of the lord god
[0:35] walking in the garden in the cool of the
[0:38] day and adam and his wife hid themselves
[0:41] from the presence
[0:44] of the lord god amongst the trees of the
[0:46] garden
[0:47] and the lord god called unto adam
[0:50] and said unto him where art thou and he
[0:53] said i heard thy voice
[0:56] in the garden and i was afraid because i
[0:59] was naked
[1:01] and i hid myself
[1:03] and he said
[1:05] who told thee
[1:06] that thou was naked
[1:09] has thou eaten of the tree
[1:11] whereof i commanded thee that thou
[1:14] should is not eat
[1:16] amen let's go to ii timothy
[1:19] chapter one
[1:24] familiar
[1:26] verse of scripture
[1:38] and verse 7. the bible says for god have
[1:41] not given us the spirit of fear but of
[1:44] power and of love and a sound mind
[1:48] amen may the lord bless me of his word
[1:50] you can have your seats
[1:55] amen praise the lord tonight by the
[1:57] grace of god
[1:59] i want to use for a subject
[2:02] under the influence
[2:04] under
[2:05] the influence
[2:08] and church before i i get to go on
[2:11] really what i want to talk about i want
[2:13] to show
[2:14] what man was
[2:16] before sin came in
[2:18] how he thought
[2:20] you know what his relationship was with
[2:22] god
[2:23] you know if we look right here in
[2:24] genesis we're gonna back up before
[2:26] chapter three
[2:28] you know in in when god made man
[2:32] god had fellowship with man
[2:34] god spoke his word
[2:36] man responded to the word
[2:39] man had a daily fellowship with the lord
[2:42] and what i want you to understand
[2:44] there was no fear there
[2:46] hallelujah
[2:48] he didn't run from god
[2:50] he was excited about that fellowship
[2:53] and one thing i want you to understand
[2:55] church
[2:56] this was something normal for man
[2:58] this wasn't something that we call
[3:00] supernatural this was a natural theme
[3:04] that god would come down and have
[3:06] fellowship with his creation
[3:09] but then something took place
[3:11] where
[3:12] that fellowship was broken hallelujah
[3:15] not only was it broken but the way
[3:17] mankind looked at god they looked at him
[3:20] different
[3:21] but let's understand this nothing
[3:23] changed about the lord
[3:25] nothing at all
[3:27] but something came into the minds of
[3:30] mankind the actions of mankind that made
[3:34] them look at god in a different way what
[3:36] was it it was the influence of fear
[3:42] and i wonder how often we as church
[3:45] people
[3:46] we walk around influenced by fear
[3:50] we're under the influence of fear that's
[3:53] the first thing we see after the fall
[3:56] it wasn't smoking it wasn't drinking it
[3:59] wasn't lying it wasn't cheating it was
[4:01] fear
[4:06] listen
[4:08] god does not change
[4:11] god is faithful
[4:13] see what we have to realize even when
[4:15] you mess up god's going to keep his end
[4:17] of the bargain
[4:21] hallelujah
[4:23] church even though adam and eve they
[4:26] messed up you know they they
[4:28] they did exactly what god told them not
[4:31] to do god faithfully still came down in
[4:35] the cool of the day like he always did
[4:38] so i'm saying to you tonight if you got
[4:41] things in your life that you are not
[4:43] proud of you are not to fear god
[4:47] but you ought to say lord help me
[4:49] because i know you see my iniquities
[4:52] lord help me because i know you see my
[4:54] fears
[4:57] oh yeah
[4:58] the lord saw their fears and he still
[5:01] calls them by name
[5:03] adam adam where are thou
[5:07] so i challenge you tonight church if you
[5:10] got something in your life don't be
[5:12] afraid to bring it to god
[5:14] because he knows all about it
[5:18] y'all y'all forgive me but you know i i
[5:22] i'm like a machine gun
[5:25] and
[5:26] and i'm really on fire because y'all got
[5:29] me plenty of room up here
[5:32] hallelujah
[5:33] but church we we look at it
[5:36] they
[5:38] took of the forbidden fruit
[5:40] but before they did that i want you to
[5:43] i want to drill this
[5:45] look at the attitude of man
[5:48] look at who he was
[5:50] before fear came in
[5:53] the prophet of god said adam would talk
[5:55] to the trees and the trees would obey
[6:00] last time i checked trees don't have
[6:02] ears
[6:04] trees don't have mines trees don't even
[6:06] have legs but when adam said get up and
[6:09] go they plugged up and they moved
[6:14] whoa
[6:15] hurry up and when he said it he wasn't
[6:18] afraid that it wasn't going to happen
[6:21] why because he had the mind of a god
[6:23] there was no fear there he was under the
[6:26] influence of the image and likeness of
[6:29] god
[6:30] [Applause]
[6:32] oh that's who we are church
[6:34] that's who we are when we come back to
[6:37] what god originally made us to be we are
[6:40] under the influence of the image and
[6:43] likeness of god
[6:49] i got to pull away from that because i'm
[6:51] gonna kind of go into some of that in
[6:53] the morning
[6:54] but church
[6:56] look at it
[6:58] adam was so much
[7:00] under the influence of god
[7:03] god will create things
[7:05] and bring it to adam and say you name it
[7:09] he was under such an influence of god he
[7:12] had the mind of god
[7:16] he wasn't going to name a lion a tiger
[7:18] why because god don't make mistakes
[7:22] and god was in adam
[7:24] [Applause]
[7:29] oh and when you get converted you come
[7:31] back hallelujah to what adam was
[7:34] remember the prophet god said everything
[7:37] adam lost is restored in jesus christ
[7:40] hallelujah so when you come under the
[7:42] influence of calvary's cross accepting
[7:45] jesus christ as your savior you come
[7:48] back to where god first created man
[7:53] and the reason why we don't operate like
[7:56] that is because of fear
[8:03] but
[8:05] another influence came in
[8:07] and then god in his faithfulness
[8:10] god comes down and he says
[8:13] adam adam where are thou
[8:16] first thing adam says is
[8:18] we hit ourselves
[8:20] they never hear before
[8:22] where did this fear come from
[8:25] it comes from the act they committed
[8:27] that god told them not to do
[8:32] and you know what fear is
[8:34] fear is the perversion of your
[8:36] imagination
[8:40] because you take a child
[8:42] a child to do something
[8:44] and then all their parents say i'm gonna
[8:46] get you when i get home
[8:50] and their mind will go ranting and
[8:52] raging in their mind they'll be sleeping
[8:55] with one eye open
[8:59] because daddy said he gonna get me when
[9:00] he get home
[9:02] or mama gonna get me when she get home
[9:04] see just those words make the
[9:06] imagination run wild what is it fear
[9:11] now if they wasn't worried they'll be
[9:12] sitting in daddy's chair when he get
[9:14] home
[9:19] but because of the wrong
[9:21] fear starts to project something that i
[9:24] hear all too often in the church and
[9:27] it's becoming so common we're saying it
[9:29] we're making it a part of who we are and
[9:32] we don't even realize it there's a word
[9:34] i guarantee you most of us have used
[9:36] here and there and don't even realize
[9:39] you're influencing yourself on the fear
[9:42] there's a word called my anxiety
[9:48] i'm getting sick of hearing people say
[9:51] my anxiety what you're doing you're
[9:53] confessing you got fear in your life
[9:55] [Applause]
[9:58] you're confessing that right now in that
[10:00] moment you're a product of the fall
[10:04] and what we say is my anxiety this my
[10:07] anxiety that my anxiety why are you
[10:09] claiming fear
[10:11] [Applause]
[10:12] god has not given us the spirit of fear
[10:15] but of love
[10:17] power and a sound mind
[10:19] [Applause]
[10:21] even when you mess up in your mind you
[10:23] ought to be able to say god is a
[10:26] merciful god
[10:27] [Applause]
[10:31] but we hear too much
[10:33] my anxiety
[10:35] and some of you in here and when it got
[10:36] anxiety pills
[10:38] no it's just get the fear out your life
[10:42] the very i wanna i wanna deal with your
[10:45] fear tonight
[10:46] the influence of fear
[10:48] listen church
[10:50] the way you get rid of your fear is to
[10:52] deal with it
[10:56] listen a friend of mine i was i was
[10:58] thinking about this word this word just
[10:59] kept ringing out of my spirit anxiety
[11:01] anxiety anxiety
[11:03] so i started studying it through the
[11:04] scripture
[11:05] when i got home my daughter
[11:07] she had a a
[11:09] she would tell was talking about her
[11:10] homework
[11:11] and she said my homework was panicked
[11:13] what it's called
[11:15] panic strategies
[11:17] i say panic strategies or what anxiety
[11:20] and i was like oh boy we better get into
[11:22] something
[11:24] even in school
[11:26] they're teaching the kids about anxiety
[11:30] and they're trying to show them ways
[11:33] that it's okay to be fearful
[11:37] create strategies to deal with your
[11:40] anxiety the only way you deal with fear
[11:43] is giving it to god
[11:45] he says cast your cares upon me take
[11:48] your burdens to the lord and leave it
[11:51] there
[11:52] hallelujah because we're not in the
[11:54] business of pacifying demons
[11:59] fear is a demon
[12:02] you notice what the prophet of god would
[12:03] do holy he get people in the prayer line
[12:06] and he go all the way back to their
[12:08] fears
[12:11] he said the reason why this happened
[12:13] because you did so and so and so the
[12:15] reason why this happened because this
[12:17] happened and that happened and that
[12:18] happened what is he doing he's getting
[12:19] the fear out of the way so god can deal
[12:21] with the problem
[12:28] well they'll teach you they'll have
[12:29] certain strategies like you know take
[12:31] deep breaths and do all these things
[12:34] all this nonsense
[12:39] but the only way you can deal with fear
[12:40] according to the scriptures get
[12:42] converted
[12:43] hallelujah hallelujah
[12:46] but the confession of it
[12:48] the confession of fear
[12:50] started with adam and eve
[12:53] first thing they said is
[12:55] we
[12:56] realized we were naked
[12:58] something they never realized before
[13:01] in their innocence they were all
[13:03] powerful
[13:05] in their innocence they operated as gods
[13:09] but when sin came in hallelujah they
[13:12] became fearful
[13:14] and they began to notice things about
[13:15] themselves that god was never worried
[13:17] about
[13:21] hallelujah they started looking at areas
[13:24] that god had covered by the word
[13:27] and when they got into a natural stage
[13:29] hallelujah they started looking at
[13:31] things from a natural eye as long as
[13:34] they were in the spirit hallelujah their
[13:36] sins were covered
[13:40] what they could do they never did behind
[13:43] the word but once they stepped out in
[13:45] front of the word
[13:46] their imagination started to run wow
[13:51] and now their imagination
[13:54] hallelujah
[13:55] is making our great merciful god out to
[13:58] be a brute
[14:03] that god that placed him in a garden of
[14:06] eden
[14:07] listen church listen to me good
[14:11] they had
[14:12] no real reason
[14:15] to be afraid of god
[14:20] he never did anything
[14:22] in a way that would make them afraid
[14:26] so what made them afraid
[14:28] was them now and catched us what made
[14:31] them afraid
[14:32] was the consequences of their actions
[14:37] and most of the times when we do things
[14:40] we know the consequences behind it
[14:42] hell yeah that's why when most people
[14:45] cheat and steal and rob and do all these
[14:46] things they do it in the dark because
[14:48] they don't want nobody to find out
[14:51] because they know in the broad daylight
[14:53] you can see who they are
[14:55] so they try to hide themselves they try
[14:56] to camouflage themselves and operate
[14:59] under the influence of darkness
[15:02] but the influence of light uncovers
[15:04] everything in the dark
[15:08] and now you see these two hallelujah
[15:10] with no real reason to fear god except
[15:13] breaking his word
[15:15] here
[15:16] they say
[15:18] after hearing their name call
[15:20] they say oh god we we we realized we
[15:23] were naked and we wouldn't put on our
[15:25] own fig leaves
[15:28] hallelujah
[15:29] amen you can pacify your fears
[15:33] but it's still there
[15:37] you can go 15 16 years
[15:40] and that fear that's still there
[15:42] from your childhood
[15:44] maybe somebody did you wrong but that
[15:46] fear is still there
[15:48] hell yeah and what does it do every time
[15:50] you get in that moment you start to get
[15:53] fidgety you start to get agitated and
[15:55] then you start saying things like oh my
[15:57] anxiety
[16:00] fear
[16:04] and simple things like that of your of
[16:06] your past things that are fair that
[16:08] you're fearful of you know you can bring
[16:11] that into a marriage
[16:15] you can raise children under that same
[16:17] influence of fear
[16:20] because it's something you were never
[16:23] delivered off
[16:28] and you think popping some pills gonna
[16:29] make it better
[16:32] no that's just pacify
[16:35] but you got to deal with the root cause
[16:38] because the root cause of a friend of
[16:40] mine
[16:41] she's a a social worker
[16:44] and
[16:45] you know i'm one of those people i like
[16:46] to find out what's going on out there so
[16:50] she deals with kids and all these things
[16:52] and i said
[16:53] you know what's one of the main things
[16:55] you deal with when you're dealing with
[16:56] anxiety she says depression
[16:59] because those two run together
[17:02] because when you got fear
[17:04] you feel like there's something in your
[17:06] life you can't quite overcome so then it
[17:09] starts to take you to a downward spiral
[17:12] so fear is connected to depression
[17:15] and too much depression is connected to
[17:18] suicide
[17:19] suicide is deaf hallelujah
[17:22] you see the power of fear
[17:29] but i come tonight with a solution
[17:35] and his name is jesus
[17:39] hallelujah
[17:40] he's the conqueror of every fear
[17:44] he's the conqueror of every situation
[17:47] hallelujah
[17:48] you know that there are women who are
[17:50] afraid to get married into a
[17:52] relationship because of something that
[17:54] happened to them when they were younger
[17:57] and then there are some who get married
[17:59] and cannot fully hardly be submissive
[18:02] because of something that happened
[18:05] and there are men hallelujah who may
[18:07] have gotten destroyed in relationships
[18:09] so when they get in a relationship they
[18:11] keep their guard up
[18:14] i'm a man i'm macho
[18:18] believe it or not sisters believe it or
[18:20] not
[18:22] one of one of the best things you can do
[18:24] for your husband and say you're just my
[18:26] big old macho man
[18:32] you make him blush from here to
[18:33] kalamazoo
[18:37] hallelujah
[18:39] what i want you to understand hallelujah
[18:42] fear strips us from our sanity
[18:47] when we ought to be holy happy and
[18:50] joyous and having a good time we come to
[18:52] church with fears in our life
[18:55] secrets in our life
[18:57] things that we're trying to cover up and
[18:58] keep in the dark when we're supposed to
[19:00] be in the light
[19:03] what's going on this is a delivery
[19:06] service
[19:11] oh yeah
[19:12] we're not taking fears out of here
[19:15] anymore we're giving them to god and let
[19:18] god deal with it
[19:20] i'm saying again he said cast your cares
[19:23] unto the lord
[19:27] hallelujah
[19:29] but the same friend of mine who's a
[19:30] social worker
[19:32] holly
[19:36] she can relate you know why
[19:38] because she has fears
[19:41] she told me when she was younger she was
[19:43] bit by a dog
[19:45] i think going to the mailbox or
[19:47] something like that
[19:48] she was bit by a dog
[19:50] now she's a grown woman
[19:54] living her life
[19:56] but every time she go to the mailbox
[20:05] she runs and get that mail
[20:08] and she's looking out for a dog
[20:11] keep in mind
[20:12] none of her neighbors have dogs
[20:17] may not even be a dog in the
[20:19] neighborhood now i'm gonna take that
[20:20] back
[20:21] i'll tell you that
[20:23] somebody probably has a dog
[20:25] but there's something that triggers that
[20:27] fear
[20:28] so she may have went to the mailbox the
[20:30] dog
[20:34] and that fear starts to come back
[20:36] dawg will be four blocks over
[20:39] just the sound of it
[20:41] triggers something she never got over
[20:44] hallelujah and there are things in your
[20:47] life and in my life hallelujah that if
[20:49] god hasn't dealt with it
[20:51] something will trigger it
[20:54] and it'll cause you to tiptoe
[20:57] when you ought to be walking and strive
[20:59] because you're living by the glory of
[21:00] god
[21:05] listen church
[21:07] her imagination
[21:09] rumbles and goes and takes it all over
[21:12] the place
[21:13] every time she goes to the mailbox
[21:16] and the last time i checked since that
[21:19] first time she's gotten bit by a dog
[21:21] she's never gotten bitten again
[21:24] so what is there to fear
[21:28] she's creating a scenario in her mind
[21:37] how often do we create certain scenarios
[21:40] in our mind
[21:42] god tells you come and give your life
[21:45] and you say but lord i got this
[21:47] but lord i did that but lord but lord
[21:50] but lord if he's telling you that means
[21:53] he has enough grace to forgive you
[21:57] [Applause]
[22:02] hallelujah
[22:06] but under that influence
[22:08] they could still hear god call
[22:13] hallelujah they could hear the sovereign
[22:16] voice of god
[22:18] with
[22:19] fear in it life
[22:21] so you can't tell me tonight that god
[22:23] hasn't talked to you
[22:26] you can't tell me tonight hollywood that
[22:29] god hasn't told you to deal with your
[22:31] fears
[22:33] hallelujah
[22:35] but you know some of us are stubborn
[22:38] we will hear the word of god and we'll
[22:39] walk right out of here with the same old
[22:41] stuff in our lives
[22:43] and you know what it becomes then it
[22:44] becomes torment
[22:49] remember the woman that committed
[22:50] adultery husband while he was away in
[22:52] the military
[22:53] the prophet talked about her
[22:56] and everything was fine and then all of
[22:57] a sudden she started getting sick why
[22:59] does she start getting sick because the
[23:02] the atmosphere of fear she was
[23:04] suppressing in her body began to develop
[23:07] a uh unbalanced chemical uh chemical
[23:10] imbalance in her body
[23:14] that's what fear will do fear it will do
[23:17] stress to make your air come out
[23:19] fear will cause you to not eat and lose
[23:21] weight
[23:23] oh my somebody needs to get rid of their
[23:26] fear tonight
[23:31] but she went for years and years
[23:34] with that fear in her life the prophet
[23:36] of god say she had to go to the doctor
[23:38] and they wanted to take honor give her
[23:40] anesthesia she said oh no
[23:42] she couldn't do that because then she'd
[23:44] be under another influence
[23:47] and under that influence she might tell
[23:49] the story
[23:51] so there is an influence where the real
[23:54] you will come out
[23:57] hallelujah there's something that can
[24:00] bring out the real you hallelujah
[24:02] amen and although we may have fears
[24:05] there's something we call the word of
[24:07] god that can bring out the real you
[24:10] hallelujah
[24:11] it wasn't until hallelujah i heard this
[24:14] message of the hour that the real me
[24:16] came out earlier the real me wasn't a
[24:19] truck driver the real me hallelujah
[24:21] wasn't some young sinner but the real me
[24:24] is a child of god
[24:28] and as long as i had fears i would never
[24:30] be able to come to god
[24:38] but listen if i can i don't want to be
[24:40] too long
[24:42] but if we think about influence
[24:44] you look at the influence from where
[24:45] adam and eve was
[24:47] and then sin came in and look where they
[24:49] went
[24:51] they went from a place of being
[24:52] confident
[24:54] being able to feel all of god's thoughts
[24:58] my
[25:01] god would just ask them and they say yes
[25:03] lord and they just fulfill god's desire
[25:07] but then fear came in they started
[25:09] running from god they said we heard your
[25:11] voice the voice they always heard
[25:16] and they said we we realized we were
[25:18] naked and we wouldn't hit ourselves and
[25:20] i love god's response god says who told
[25:23] you you was naked
[25:27] oh my
[25:28] what is he saying who told you to be
[25:30] afraid
[25:33] who told you to be afraid tonight church
[25:37] god already knew he was naked
[25:40] god didn't ask him are you naked he said
[25:42] who told you you was naked see god is
[25:45] saying i already know he was naked
[25:48] i just wasn't looking at your nakedness
[25:50] the way you looking at it now
[25:53] cause when i looked at your nakedness i
[25:55] saw innocence
[25:56] [Applause]
[26:01] but because of sin you're looking at
[26:02] your negatives and you say oh my god i
[26:05] have to run from you
[26:11] god already knew that he said who told
[26:13] you he was naked
[26:16] you know adam
[26:18] adam was afraid
[26:20] you know what he said the woman
[26:28] it's default it's the reason why i'm
[26:30] like this
[26:33] it's my husband
[26:36] it's my wife
[26:38] it's my children it's the people in the
[26:40] church and oh god it has to be brother
[26:43] paul
[26:48] we blame our fears on everybody else
[26:50] holy
[26:52] accept our own imagination
[26:55] [Applause]
[27:00] they begin to pass the fears down
[27:04] he says the woman the woman says the
[27:07] serpent
[27:08] servant had nobody to accuse
[27:13] so god brought judgment hallelujah
[27:16] because they let fear
[27:18] come in something that was holy and
[27:20] sovereign
[27:22] sure
[27:23] now let's pick up from here
[27:25] everybody all right
[27:28] now we should be real hyped up
[27:31] because we had a bunch of sugar all day
[27:33] long
[27:34] we had pure apple cider we had who they
[27:38] had donuts we had pie galore
[27:43] we ought to be up here like
[27:45] brother price
[27:46] price we ought to be here like everybody
[27:49] to have red bull
[27:53] hallelujah
[27:56] but church from there
[27:59] what fear starts to do fear starts to
[28:02] create an atmosphere of evil
[28:07] because man is no longer hardly
[28:09] connected with god
[28:11] now they're going out doing everything
[28:13] in their imagination
[28:14] and now their thoughts hollya are evil
[28:17] their ways are evil because of fear
[28:19] everything is trickled down to something
[28:22] god doesn't like
[28:24] and that by the time we get over here in
[28:26] genesis uh
[28:29] genesis the sixth chapter the bible says
[28:32] that god hollywood saw the wickedness of
[28:34] man
[28:36] was was great in the earth and that
[28:38] every
[28:40] imagination of the thoughts of his heart
[28:43] was only evil continually
[28:48] the perversion of fear
[28:50] moving with the imagination of men
[28:52] hallelujah everything in that place was
[28:55] evil and god looked at it and the bible
[28:58] says that god repented that he even made
[29:01] man
[29:06] look at how god looks at you
[29:09] when you have fear in your life
[29:13] because he knows he's the answer to
[29:15] every solution
[29:16] but now man has gotten wicked and wicked
[29:18] and wicked
[29:20] the imagination and thoughts everything
[29:22] is getting evil and evil and evil
[29:24] and then god comes down in the midst of
[29:26] all this evil hallelujah in the midst of
[29:29] all this fear all the stuff going on and
[29:32] then he drops down in verse 6 and verse
[29:34] 8 he says but noah found grace
[29:39] in the eyes of the lord oh
[29:42] my
[29:43] see church the whole world was under the
[29:46] influence of fear and then god comes in
[29:49] and he gives noah another influence
[29:52] he said no i'm gonna put you and your
[29:54] whole family under the influence of
[29:57] grace
[30:06] think about it church we all got things
[30:09] that we're influenced by
[30:12] brothers in the i.t give me that um
[30:16] that uh image of the um
[30:19] the the samson

[31:05] not to get cable and all these other
[31:07] things and have the cable man coming out
[31:09] hooking up dish work dish network
[31:13] but satan was also smart enough i'm
[31:15] gonna give him the internet

[31:22] what you're watching in your house
[31:28] hallelujah
[31:29] hallelujah i say hallelujah

[31:42] netflix
[31:50] that to each his own
[31:53] whatever where's your whistle
[31:57] and for some of us it's hulu

[32:36] all of it fit in the same category look
[32:39] and to make it even more more simple

[32:45] that looks like this
[32:46] nothing there's nothing wrong with it
[32:48] with all these different lifetimes all
[32:50] the stuff fx now and amc whatever all

[33:20] things look bravo and whatever else hbo
[33:23] to go how are you going to get some hbo
[33:25] to go

[33:50] but listen church
[33:53] there's nothing wrong with all that you
[33:55] can buy and by god's grace you pay
[33:58] attention to what your pastor preached
[34:01] because he may come in and he may then
[34:03] have services where he's been hammering
[34:05] the tv
[34:07] you pay attention to what he's saying
[34:09] holy i'm just being inspired right now
[34:11] holy i'm just just the blood the just
[34:14] the bloodhound is off the chain right
[34:16] now
[34:19] and right now he's digging up some stuff
[34:20] that's in the yard
[34:23] but you pay attention what your pastor
[34:25] say
[34:26] there's nothing wrong hallelujah if you
[34:28] got a monitor or tv with all the stuff
[34:30] on it harley
[34:32] stars can't hurt you
[34:33] who cares your netflix did none of that
[34:36] can't hurt you
[34:38] what hurts you holly is the kind of
[34:40] spirit you got
[34:46] hallelujah see it's the spirit behind
[34:49] the person that has the tv
[34:52] see hulu can't do nothing to me except i
[34:55] activate it
[34:58] never black flags can't do nothing to me
[35:00] except i
[35:01] it
[35:02] see it's the person behind the thing
[35:05] with the remote harley
[35:07] it's the influence inside of you which
[35:10] makes that good or bad
[35:12] because remember the problem that god
[35:13] said the tv could be for you for good
[35:17] but
[35:19] but what happens you got too many
[35:21] unconverted people waiting in their
[35:24] house
[35:29] but these are a lot of influences
[35:32] and you know what can i be transparent
[35:36] i know your boy y'all ready for me to
[35:37] tell on myself
[35:43] i've even uh uh
[35:45] not one of these but
[35:47] you know you you you the devil's so
[35:48] crafty
[35:50] you say man i think i'm
[35:52] trying to get me some nfl
[35:55] trying to get me some something
[35:57] you know trying to watch you get a and
[35:59] the devil so crafty he'll give you a
[36:01] a
[36:02] a free
[36:03] must trial

[36:22] how many of us we got it and forgot we
[36:24] had it
[36:26] and you still paying for it
[36:30] cause you never got all the codes you
[36:32] never got everything that you signed up
[36:33] with and they getting your money every
[36:35] month oh yeah
[36:37] why what happens spiritually hallelujah
[36:40] we go into revenues we're going to
[36:42] places and we open up things in our
[36:45] lives and we give the devil a free pass
[36:47] and we forget how he gets there
[36:50] [Applause]
[36:52] because we gave we accepted a free
[36:54] prescription let me tell you something
[36:56] ain't nothing free in this world but the
[36:58] gospel
[37:04] holiday
[37:06] i ain't fussing i'm talking about being
[37:08] under the influence
[37:09] holly give me the next one brother
[37:12] if that one don't get you
[37:15] that one i get you
[37:21] if i was a dude what like they do at the
[37:23] concerts cut the lights out and there's
[37:24] everybody saying light it up
[37:29] everybody cut them lights on
[37:32] cell phones go look
[37:34] [Music]
[37:39] because a cell phone is like
[37:41] life and death
[37:46] but it's one of the greatest influences
[37:48] in our life
[37:52] sometimes i like talking to younger
[37:54] folks
[37:55] well i tell them we used to go around we
[37:57] had no cell phone really
[38:01] yo well how did y'all get where y'all
[38:03] was going we got there
[38:07] well how did you see your friends
[38:09] at school the next day
[38:12] or when we got home from school
[38:15] and only they have no comeback for that
[38:17] so all they can say is
[38:19] you owe
[38:24] but you think about it when there was
[38:26] less influences in our life life was
[38:28] more safe
[38:32] hallelujah mama lafontaine wasn't
[38:35] worried about y'all when y'all went out
[38:36] to the store
[38:40] hallelujah but now because we have so
[38:43] much different influences and this thing
[38:45] right here is causing so much anxiety
[38:49] if we just start with ig
[38:56] and then you come back how many likes
[38:58] did i get
[39:00] oh man i didn't get too many likes
[39:02] so i need to do something else
[39:15] what is it it's the influence
[39:18] hallelujah
[39:21] same thing with the guys
[39:23] they get on there and do something
[39:29] how many likes that get
[39:31] didn't get that many
[39:43] the influence of somebody else's
[39:45] thoughts shouldn't control your life
[39:49] but now they call this stuff social
[39:51] media
[39:54] and i got a cell phone too what i mean
[39:56] but there's nothing wrong with an apple
[39:59] there's nothing wrong with an android
[40:03] i refuse to get out because apple's
[40:05] cursed
[40:11] i like android because i like being out
[40:13] of this world
[40:18] but if you take hallelujah just the
[40:20] phone itself there's nothing wrong with
[40:24] it's the spirit of the person
[40:26] who has the phone
[40:29] if you're under the wrong influence
[40:32] these things are going to control your
[40:34] life
[40:36] and parents don't be so gullible
[40:40] don't be so gullible they talking right
[40:42] now but it's any and everything on
[40:44] tick-tock
[40:46] if your child has a tick-tock account
[40:48] you need to be asking them questions
[40:52] any and everything goes on these sites
[40:56] and tick tock is not even an american
[40:58] app it comes from the
[41:04] chinese and i heard hallelujah that this
[41:08] tick tock has surpassed facebook
[41:11] instagram everything it has over a
[41:14] billion subscribers
[41:18] monthly
[41:23] but it's the influence behind the thing
[41:27] and you see our children in this whole
[41:29] world fall under the influence of social
[41:32] media
[41:34] when god wants us to be under the
[41:36] influence like noah grace

[47:18] 26.
[47:21] y'all know kids always have an
[47:22] alternative motive
[47:25] they ain't just cleaning that room up
[47:26] for nothing
[47:30] but you know what
[47:31] noah
[47:33] had to keep had to keep going
[47:35] and you know that what people brother
[47:36] branham said there probably were other
[47:37] boats in that day because they're
[47:38] looking at noah and they say he ain't
[47:40] going to build a boat i can build a boat
[47:42] too but the thing about his boat his
[47:44] boat hollywood was being built by the
[47:46] mind of god
[47:49] he was under the influence of grace
[47:52] so think about the church hallelujah
[47:54] even when noah's boys came on they had
[47:57] no vindication of what was really
[47:59] happening all lord was getting it
[48:01] straight from god because it was
[48:03] hallelujah coming from god's grace there
[48:05] was nothing that could go wrong
[48:11] and everything that was happening was
[48:13] supposed to happen
[48:15] and you know what probably one day after
[48:17] you get the boys because you know he was
[48:18] a husband too you know his wife brother
[48:20] come in you know sister noah said hey
[48:22] noah you know what we ain't had date
[48:24] night this week he said okay honey where
[48:26] you want to go she said i want to go to
[48:27] uh crocodile
[48:30] and some of y'all sister man please
[48:31] ain't no date night ain't no crack about
[48:36] i want to go to ko yotos get me some
[48:38] japanese or something
[48:41] but you know what he go out have date
[48:44] night and then he go back
[48:46] go back to the boat when his wife come
[48:48] on say honey wasn't that just a nice
[48:49] time he said yeah you know i always
[48:51] enjoy spending time with you hey you're
[48:54] in my life you're my joy but right now i
[48:56] gotta stay with this grace
[48:58] and he keeps working and keep working
[48:59] keep working then the next week come and
[49:01] he said hey honey you know it's date
[49:03] night he said okay take a little break
[49:05] really he gonna have date night again
[49:07] have date night date night over with he
[49:09] go back to the boat again why he's under
[49:12] the
[49:14] influence he's under the influence he's
[49:17] working and working and working working
[49:19] and then one day by his surprise the
[49:21] influence is just moving all over the
[49:23] place his wife comes in and she has a
[49:25] basket
[49:27] she said honey you know the night is
[49:29] date night
[49:30] he said yeah honey where you want to go
[49:31] she said no we're gonna have date night
[49:33] on the boat
[49:37] we're gonna have date night right here
[49:38] all around the tools
[49:40] all around everything just sit on down
[49:42] we're gonna see right here and have date
[49:43] night they sit right they have date
[49:45] night in the midst of all the work all
[49:47] the boat all the stuff all the hyps up
[49:50] all that stuff laying around they say
[49:51] red dead and have date night because his
[49:53] wife she appreciates his faithfulness
[49:58] and now she's falling in line with the
[50:00] influence
[50:02] and i know it has his whole family under
[50:04] the same influence
[50:06] with no vindication
[50:09] [Applause]
[50:12] all he has is the word of god
[50:17] and he's under that influence
[50:19] now he has his whole family helping bill
[50:21] a boat
[50:22] he didn't compromise his children
[50:25] he didn't compromise his wife
[50:27] he just stayed under the influence
[50:30] let me tell you something
[50:31] you
[50:32] getting upset with the message is not
[50:34] gonna save your family
[50:37] you compromising service and staying
[50:39] home and that ain't gonna win nobody to
[50:40] christ you just stay faithful
[50:45] [Music]
[50:46] you stay faithful god will take care of
[50:48] everybody else
[50:52] hurry up all lord had to do was stay
[50:54] faithful and god took care of everybody
[50:56] else
[51:00] brothers give me that give me that quote
[51:01] i gave you y'all i'm about to close
[51:03] y'all know i'm coming down
[51:06] look look at this he says now notice
[51:09] last night we left abraham where god had
[51:12] confirmed the covenant with him
[51:14] that he would swallow by himself
[51:17] an oath by himself there's no other
[51:20] greater than he swear by that he would
[51:23] keep his promise to abraham and his seed
[51:26] and the promise was given
[51:28] unconditionally listen and what we were
[51:32] trying to do was to get the fear out of
[51:35] the people's hearts and minds
[51:42] that's one of the greatest curses
[51:44] that's in the church today is the people
[51:47] who are afraid to lay hold on god's word
[51:52] the promise
[51:57] if he promised it that means it's yours
[52:01] and you shouldn't be afraid to take god
[52:04] at his word
[52:07] in my closing
[52:10] there's a lot of other things i can say
[52:11] but i think y'all get it
[52:18] right now
[52:21] we've all been influenced
[52:25] by this world
[52:28] but what we have to realize is
[52:30] we're in this world but we're not of
[52:32] this world
[52:34] you say not me i'm a child of god ain't
[52:36] nothing in this world influencing me
[52:39] oh yeah
[52:41] but i guarantee you uh a couple months
[52:44] ago you was walking around every day
[52:45] with a mask on every time you went
[52:46] outside
[52:49] why because you was under the influence
[52:51] of the laws that they was passing
[52:54] and you either had to fall in line or
[52:56] suffer the consequences
[52:59] and all of us we try to dress it up we
[53:01] got ohio state mass
[53:04] we got wolverine mask
[53:07] we got jesus christ man we got all kind
[53:09] of gucci louis vuitton all kind of nike
[53:12] masks
[53:13] we try to make win a marriage
[53:14] pleasurable
[53:18] but i want to let you know church
[53:20] i never
[53:21] became one under that influence
[53:25] i never got used to wearing a mask
[53:31] why
[53:33] because the scripture says no matter
[53:35] what happens hallelujah by his stripes i
[53:38] am healed
[53:42] so how can i fully be influenced by mass
[53:46] saying that mass is my security when i'm
[53:49] influenced by isaiah
[53:54] 53. listen there are people in this
[53:57] world right now who've been so
[53:59] influenced by cover 19 they haven't been
[54:02] back to church yet
[54:05] they're under the wrong influence what
[54:07] is it fear
[54:12] there's too many people gathering in
[54:14] church
[54:16] we gathered in church before we knew
[54:18] there was a cover 19 disease
[54:22] i'm gonna show you something
[54:24] there's nothing new under the sun right
[54:28] how many ever had the flu
[54:32] probably all of us right
[54:34] and you still here
[54:38] let me ask you something
[54:39] how many times you had the flu you put
[54:41] on a mask
[54:47] nobody
[54:50] i'm gonna shock you for a second
[54:53] one of the symptoms of the flu is
[54:55] chills
[54:57] one of the symptoms of covet is
[54:59] chills
[55:03] one of the symptoms of the flu is high
[55:05] fevers
[55:07] one of the centers of covert is high
[55:09] fevers
[55:14] and you know if you let the flu carry on
[55:16] too long
[55:18] you
[55:18] develop water in your lungs and things
[55:20] like that fluid in your lungs
[55:23] what is one of the symptoms of cold
[55:27] fluid in your lungs
[55:30] can't sound like the same thing to me
[55:38] how long has the symptoms of the flu
[55:39] been around
[55:40] for eons
[55:43] it's been here forever
[55:46] people been getting chills people
[55:47] getting fevers and people been
[55:48] recovering
[55:52] and this is the kick over here people
[55:54] been coming to church with the flu
[56:03] hey
[56:05] so
[56:06] pretty much all of the same symptoms
[56:11] so what makes covet greater than the flu
[56:16] fear
[56:20] the attitudes of the people
[56:24] we make it stronger
[56:26] than what it is
[56:30] and as for your
[56:31] six feet
[56:36] come here bro
[56:40] stand up here all right
[56:43] don't you walk back to your seat all
[56:44] right now say stay right there right
[56:48] uh
[56:49] do about six feet right here right
[56:56] well that's far out here
[56:58] let's get a little bit closer
[56:59] about six feet
[57:02] what's your name bro
[57:04] nehemiah praise god
[57:07] didn't look to the left or to the right
[57:08] he stayed right with moses
[57:10] teaching okay nehemiah
[57:14] i want you to go back to your seat
[57:17] now they tell us to stay six feet apart
[57:19] right
[57:20] but if me and nehemiah are in church
[57:22] and i got to go the same way nehemiah go
[57:26] i'm gonna walk right into nehemiah's
[57:27] disease
[57:28] [Laughter]
[57:33] so what good is it six feet
[57:36] it's all in your mind
[57:44] six feet don't mean nothing
[57:46] cause if we in a grocery store for me to
[57:48] get up there and pay for my stuff i got
[57:50] to walk in your six
[57:53] and feet
[57:53] person behind me got to walk in my six
[57:55] feet so you know we are we're just a
[57:58] bunch of six feet walking people
[58:05] but what makes that good or bad
[58:08] is the spirit within you
[58:14] and before i close i was one of those
[58:15] people you know they got this
[58:16] vaccination thing going on now right
[58:19] you know i was one of those people i
[58:20] don't care what they come out with i
[58:22] ain't taking that i got the blood
[58:24] achieved
[58:28] but it's straight i'm healed
[58:34] vaccination i'm already vaccinated in
[58:36] jesus
[58:40] they hate to see me coming
[58:45] and you know what
[58:47] i still believe that
[58:49] but you know we got to be sane christian
[58:54] we can't be afraid
[58:57] and a brother came down to church and he
[58:58] was preaching he said you know
[59:01] now that they're making some of this
[59:03] stuff mandatory
[59:05] to keep your job they're making it
[59:06] mandatory
[59:08] now i can't say god i ain't saying that
[59:10] god can't move
[59:11] on your job or whatever
[59:13] but
[59:14] if you get to the place to where you
[59:15] have to take it or not take it and keep
[59:17] your job what you're going to do
[59:20] you're going to stand up and say i'm a
[59:21] believer
[59:23] they'll say okay mr believer go take
[59:25] that shot keep your job
[59:28] or you're going to pray about it however
[59:29] you handle it
[59:30] but what i'm saying for me was
[59:34] because you hear all the stuff about it
[59:36] you might not be able to have children
[59:37] and all this stuff and
[59:39] honestly church i ain't got time to go
[59:41] study what's going on in the world
[59:45] i got time to get consumed about all
[59:47] this stuff
[59:49] i stay with the word
[59:52] hallelujah and me personally hallelujah
[59:55] i believe we already got the answer
[59:59] but you know what a brother came and he
[1:00:00] was preaching and he said you know what
[1:00:01] this this stuff gonna get mandatory in a
[1:00:03] job to keep your job this blah blah blah
[1:00:05] he says but if you come to me and i
[1:00:07] gotta take it he said i'm gonna bind up
[1:00:09] the devil and go take the shot
[1:00:12] and i say you're gonna find the devil
[1:00:13] take the shot he said yeah the scripture
[1:00:15] says
[1:00:16] if you take off any deadly thing it
[1:00:17] shall not harm you
[1:00:20] i say i'm free
[1:00:26] because see what that scripture does is
[1:00:28] take away all the fear
[1:00:32] hallelujah it takes away all the fear
[1:00:35] whether you take it or not that's up to
[1:00:37] you but if i got to take it i ain't
[1:00:39] afraid to take it
[1:00:41] holy and if i don't take it i ain't
[1:00:43] afraid i hadn't taken it hardly so
[1:00:46] either way around i'm all right
[1:00:48] because our god is faithful amen
[1:00:51] and just to tell you that that scripture
[1:00:52] is true there's a missionary brother i
[1:00:54] know named brother andre and brother
[1:00:56] andre was in venezuela hallelujah uh do
[1:00:59] do a missionary work to the indians and
[1:01:01] these indian people are very
[1:01:03] cannibalistic
[1:01:05] you go into these areas they will cook
[1:01:07] you and fry you
[1:01:09] and he went back there under the
[1:01:10] leadership of god you know how you go
[1:01:12] places sometimes brother abraham paul
[1:01:14] says hey brother i sure would like for
[1:01:16] you to come with me he said god over
[1:01:18] there no
[1:01:20] you better be led by god
[1:01:23] he said he got over there he's back in
[1:01:24] the back before you get all the way back
[1:01:26] there there's a sign that says do not go
[1:01:29] back here
[1:01:31] because back here the chief has all
[1:01:33] authority the government can't help you
[1:01:35] so he said he was back there doing
[1:01:37] missionary work him and his him and his
[1:01:39] uh interpreter and different things and
[1:01:41] he's back there a couple days he says
[1:01:43] one guy maybe by his third day this guy
[1:01:46] had like a little uh a little glass with
[1:01:48] some stuff in it and he tucked the glass
[1:01:51] and slammed it down in front of brother
[1:01:52] andre
[1:01:54] and he was like what what is he doing
[1:01:56] he says
[1:01:58] this stuff right here
[1:01:59] i've been putting your food for the past
[1:02:01] three days trying to poison you and kill
[1:02:03] you
[1:02:05] he says but you've been eating it and
[1:02:06] you've been preaching
[1:02:11] you've been drinking it and you've been
[1:02:13] preaching
[1:02:14] and that man hallelujah fell on his
[1:02:16] knees and said leave me to your god
[1:02:22] that's the god we serve
[1:02:24] we are not to fear he is the protector
[1:02:27] when you are under the right influence
[1:02:31] hallelujah and brother andre was under
[1:02:32] the influence of the word of god and god
[1:02:35] was his protector if you take of any
[1:02:38] deadly things it shall not harm you
[1:02:42] and when you're under the right
[1:02:44] influence it'll leave other people to
[1:02:46] the cross
[1:02:52] in my closing i'm gonna close my bible
[1:02:54] i'm gonna just i'm gonna just quote it
[1:02:55] y'all know i'm about to close
[1:02:58] listen
[1:02:59] when we get to joshua
[1:03:02] god comes to joshua the first thing he
[1:03:03] says
[1:03:05] moses
[1:03:06] my servant is dead
[1:03:08] i don't want you to be influenced by
[1:03:09] that
[1:03:11] he said he dead he said now i'm going to
[1:03:13] use you
[1:03:15] i'm going to use you i'm going to bring
[1:03:17] you into the promised land that i told
[1:03:18] moses about
[1:03:20] but i'm not going to deal with moses
[1:03:21] anymore i'm going to deal with you
[1:03:23] now god is taking his influence off of
[1:03:25] moses and putting it on him
[1:03:28] and now he's telling joshua this is what
[1:03:29] i want you to be i want you to be strong
[1:03:32] and courageous
[1:03:34] oh yeah this is god talking to his
[1:03:36] servant i want you to be strong and
[1:03:39] courageous
[1:03:40] and then he comes to joshua he tells
[1:03:42] joshua there'll be no one able to stand
[1:03:45] before you
[1:03:49] what if god told you that
[1:03:51] there'll be nothing able to stand before
[1:03:53] you wherever the soul of your feet shall
[1:03:56] try i have given it to you for a
[1:03:58] possession
[1:03:59] church y'all realize every time joshua
[1:04:02] went out to fight he was under the
[1:04:04] influence of that word
[1:04:06] he was under the influence that there's
[1:04:08] nothing being able to stand before you
[1:04:10] hallelujah joshua wasn't waiting on
[1:04:12] everybody else to fight the promise was
[1:04:14] his joshua would just go fire
[1:04:21] why he was under the influence of what
[1:04:23] god said
[1:04:26] every time he go to battle he'd go out
[1:04:28] there ah
[1:04:32] they're looking at him what's wrong josh
[1:04:33] don't know he didn't even get us a
[1:04:34] chance to set up a game plan
[1:04:38] in his mind all he hears is there's
[1:04:41] nothing and no one be able to stand
[1:04:44] before you only be thou strong and
[1:04:47] courageous
[1:04:48] strong and courageous is not waiting on
[1:04:51] this brother holly stronger grace is not
[1:04:53] what stronger rages is god i remember ah
[1:04:57] [Applause]
[1:04:59] i remember what you said lord all i got
[1:05:02] to do is be strong and courageous
[1:05:04] hallelujah
[1:05:08] he was worried about what everybody else
[1:05:09] was doing
[1:05:10] god told him wherever your feet go
[1:05:16] i've given to you for possession
[1:05:22] be strong and courageous
[1:05:25] do you remember
[1:05:26] joshua went to battle
[1:05:28] he went to fight ai
[1:05:30] huddly and he lost the battle
[1:05:32] and you know what that just messed

[1:07:42] families are not supposed to be
[1:07:43] straggling hallelujah
[1:07:48] we have a word from god
[1:07:51] it's time for us to be strong and
[1:07:53] courageous
[1:07:56] be that christian that the devil is
[1:07:58] telling you you can't be
[1:08:03] joshua gathers up everybody
[1:08:05] and come to find out aiken he took the
[1:08:07] babylonians and all that stuff and what
[1:08:09] i love about it joshua didn't play with
[1:08:11] it
[1:08:12] joshua killed him
[1:08:14] his mama his daddy his cousins his
[1:08:17] cousin laws he killed everybody
[1:08:19] probably killed his dog his cat and
[1:08:21] everything else
[1:08:24] joshua killed everything that was
[1:08:25] connected to him
[1:08:27] why hallelujah because he was operating
[1:08:29] under fear
[1:08:32] wow
[1:08:33] if you can't obey the word of god it's
[1:08:35] because you got fears in your life
[1:08:40] church so god he dealt with him
[1:08:42] hallelujah dealt with everybody that was
[1:08:44] connected to him kill everything burn it
[1:08:47] all hallelujah and then he went back and
[1:08:49] fought the same people that he lost to
[1:08:54] he lied right back up and you know
[1:08:55] apollo was some of my dad they said why
[1:08:57] are we doing why are we doing this again
[1:08:59] we just lost why are we fighting these
[1:09:00] people again we just lost this man why
[1:09:03] we why what john
[1:09:09] [Applause]
[1:09:10] hallelujah
[1:09:12] joshua knew what god told him and he
[1:09:15] wasn't afraid to believe it
[1:09:20] while everybody else is reasoning and
[1:09:21] thinking about what we're going to do
[1:09:23] with our strategies and all this oh
[1:09:24] joshua and his mind is be strong and
[1:09:27] very courageous
[1:09:31] in my closing
[1:09:34] again
[1:09:37] joshua was so sure
[1:09:40] of what god told him
[1:09:42] the word he was so sure of the word
[1:09:45] one day joshua was praying
[1:09:50] and as he looked up
[1:09:51] there was someone standing before him
[1:09:55] glistening and shining
[1:09:59] but you know what
[1:10:01] joshua didn't know who he was
[1:10:04] and all joshua could hear is
[1:10:06] there'll be no one
[1:10:08] able to stand before you
[1:10:11] so in that moment josh will say who are
[1:10:14] you
[1:10:14] are you forced or against us
[1:10:19] what else was he gonna do
[1:10:21] he forced the angel of god to identify
[1:10:24] himself
[1:10:25] johnson was so ready to fight angels
[1:10:29] because he believed what god told him
[1:10:34] that's why hallelujah paul hurry and
[1:10:37] even our prophet could say if an angel
[1:10:39] would say anything different from what
[1:10:41] god gave me let them be a curse
[1:10:44] [Applause]
[1:10:46] whoa
[1:10:48] that's when you know what you're
[1:10:49] supposed to know
[1:10:53] the prophet of god was so confident like
[1:10:55] all these people talk about the message
[1:10:57] and this is off and that is off the
[1:10:58] property god was so confident hallelujah
[1:11:00] he went to a set up one day
[1:11:04] hallelujah they were setting them up and
[1:11:06] god showed them they gonna set you up he
[1:11:09] said but don't worry i'll be with you go
[1:11:12] ahead let them set you up hallelujah and
[1:11:14] he went right into the meeting 300 or
[1:11:16] 400 preachers sitting there huddling
[1:11:19] ready to set him up how he laid his
[1:11:21] bible out there he said what is it he
[1:11:23] said is it the way i preach marriage in
[1:11:25] the voice is it the way i preach water
[1:11:27] baptism is it serpent seed he say i
[1:11:30] challenge anyone of you bring your bible
[1:11:32] come stand next to me and prove it wrong
[1:11:38] and i say that to those who don't
[1:11:40] believe it this day get your bible and
[1:11:42] prove it wrong
[1:11:48] and after he made that statement
[1:11:50] he said
[1:11:51] that's what i
[1:11:52] thought
[1:11:54] because nobody came forward
[1:11:56] what was it they were afraid
[1:12:04] what happened they saw a man under a
[1:12:06] real influence
[1:12:13] and then after he said after he said
[1:12:14] that he said if you can't prove it wrong
[1:12:17] then stay off of my back
[1:12:22] hallelujah
[1:12:24] joshua made the angel identify himself
[1:12:26] he signed the captain of the lord's host
[1:12:28] then joshua
[1:12:30] put his sword away
[1:12:31] bowed down in worship but if he would
[1:12:34] identify himself there'll be another
[1:12:36] scripture that says joshua fought an
[1:12:37] angel
[1:12:40] because he believed the word of god
[1:12:43] there was no fear in joshua trusting
[1:12:46] the lord
[1:12:48] so church come on musicians i'm closing
