[27:08] on the internet. But anyway, uh it's
[27:10] really funny. Funny, I just told my
[27:11] wife, I said, "It's funny. I've been
[27:13] getting invited to some of these youth
[27:14] camps again. I thought my days were over
[27:16] with that, but I said, "Maybe God still
[27:18] has something for me to say to the young
[27:19] people other places." And so, we've done
[27:21] two and we have another one in January
[27:23] in Costa Rica, another youth camp. And
[27:25] but I walked in my uh into my bedroom
[27:28] bringing my luggage in Monday, and I
[27:31] appreciate your prayers. I I was
[27:32] surprised I got home with all the
[27:34] delays, but I got right through both
[27:35] flights. So, um, walked in and this
[27:38] pastor from Maitius called me and said,
[27:41] "Uh, we we would like you to come to a
[27:43] youth camp here." And I didn't know
[27:45] where Maitius was. You're all laughing
[27:47] because you knew where it is. I don't
[27:48] know where it's at, but it's a little
[27:50] place the size of New Jersey, an island
[27:52] in the middle of the Indian Ocean. My
[27:54] first response, "Oh, no. I ain't going
[27:56] there. No way. That ain't going to
[27:57] happen." Uh, but I just I thank the
[28:00] Lord. I don't know if I can do the big
[28:02] trips like that anymore, but I have to
[28:04] mind the Lord, you know, whatever he
[28:05] wants. But I just appreciate that we
[28:07] able to say something and encourage our
[28:09] young people here and young people
[28:11] around the world. There was so many um
[28:13] just responsive and we're glad. Then I
[28:15] got to preach in the Bronx on Sunday
[28:17] night at brother Ivon Kerion's house.
[28:19] That was his h um the house of God there
[28:21] in in uh inner uh Bronx. And so that was
[28:25] a very interesting time and we we had a
[28:27] lovely congregation. There's about 150
[28:30] there just uh getting right behind the
[28:32] word of God. So, we appreciate that that
[28:34] God's got little lighouses everywhere.
[28:36] I'm just glad brother Ivonne is there
[28:38] and I'm here today in Petersburg. Uh
[28:41] God's a special calling on that man.
[28:43] That's for sure. Praise the Lord. First
[28:45] John chapter 1, God bless y'all. I want
[28:47] to continue to remember brother Doug
[28:48] come through this uh procedure and we
[28:51] I'm sure he's listening tonight. God
[28:52] bless you, brother Doug. We're lifting
[28:53] you up in our prayers. And those other
[28:55] ones that are sick tonight that were
[28:57] mentioned, we want to remember them on
[28:58] our hearts as well. First John chapter 1
[29:01] and verse 5, continuing [clears throat]
[29:04] on with our uh study and he cares. Do
[29:07] you care? If you have a chance to uh
[29:10] listen to that, uh we ask you to do it
[29:13] and that way you could be coming along
[29:14] with us where we're at and we'll move
[29:16] along in the message. It should be this
[29:17] this Wednesday and maybe next Wednesday
[29:19] we'd be able to finish up. 1 John
[29:21] chapter 1 and verse 5. This then is the
[29:23] message that we have heard of him and
[29:26] declare unto you that God is light and
[29:28] in him is no darkness at all. If we say
[29:31] that we have fellowship with him and
[29:34] walk in darkness, we lie and do not the
[29:36] truth. Now, can you imagine somebody?
[29:38] Now, this is somebody that's kind of
[29:40] living in between because they're saying
[29:42] they're in fellowship with him, but
[29:44] they're living or walking in darkness.
[29:46] That doesn't go together. Um John is
[29:48] saying that doesn't work right. You
[29:49] can't live in a state of darkness or
[29:52] live uh outside of the light in your
[29:54] life and your walk with God and then be
[29:56] confessing or saying that you're in
[29:58] fellowship with him.
[30:00] &gt;&gt; If we walk in darkness, we lie and do
[30:02] not the truth. But if we walk in the
[30:04] light as he is in the light, we have
[30:05] fellowship one with another. And the
[30:07] blood of Jesus Christ, his son,
[30:10] cleanseth us from all sin. the power and
[30:13] the results of the blood of Jesus Christ
[30:15] come in effect into our life by walking
[30:18] in the light. Can you say amen? If we
[30:21] say that we have no sin, we deceive
[30:23] ourselves and the truth is not in us. So
[30:27] um that's uh the only way that the bride
[30:29] can say she's sinless is because through
[30:30] the blood of Jesus Christ. That's the
[30:32] only way he sees us. But on our level,
[30:34] we're are we should never be saying that
[30:36] we don't have any sin in the sense of in
[30:38] these bodies or we are deceiving
[30:40] ourselves. Amen. So the truth is not in
[30:44] us. If we confess our sins, no notice
[30:47] the power of confession. Now he is
[30:49] faithful and just to forgive us of our
[30:52] sins.
[30:53] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen to that?
[30:55] &gt;&gt; But it doesn't stop there. If we conf
[30:58] look at the power of confession now, if
[31:00] we confess our sins, he's faithful and
[31:02] just to forgive us of our sins and to
[31:05] cleanse us from all righteous
[31:09] unrighteousness. So everybody say all.
[31:12] &gt;&gt; All.
[31:13] &gt;&gt; How powerful is this?
[31:15] &gt;&gt; How powerful is this? Doesn't just stop
[31:18] at forgiving your sins, but it's able to
[31:20] provide the flow of the washing from the
[31:24] Lord. the washing
[31:26] &gt;&gt; that would cleanse us from all
[31:28] unrighteousness and all pretty much
[31:30] covers everything.
[31:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[31:33] &gt;&gt; You know, it doesn't have specific
[31:34] things. It's just the big stuff. It's
[31:36] the little stuff. It's the big stuff.
[31:38] All unrighteousness, that's the power of
[31:40] the blood in our lives. And how does it
[31:42] work? By our confession.
[31:45] &gt;&gt; If we say that we have not sinned, we
[31:48] make him a liar and his word is not in
[31:50] us. Praise the Lord. God, may you bless
[31:52] the reading of your word tonight. And
[31:54] God bless you all as you take your
[31:55] seats. Last time we
[31:58] uh were talking about this a couple
[31:59] Wednesdays ago in studying the next
[32:01] section of He Cares, Do You Care? Uh we
[32:04] seen that the prophet was drawing a real
[32:07] contrast between science and education
[32:10] and the things of the world and the
[32:12] world and he was drawing a contrast
[32:14] between science, education, the world
[32:16] and the provided way for the people of
[32:19] God in order to get help. So he's
[32:21] drawing that distinction really far. And
[32:24] the thing about education that we learn
[32:26] in science and these uh feeding off the
[32:28] tree of knowledge of good and evil and
[32:30] feeding on the things of the world, we
[32:31] realize that some of the things of
[32:33] education may sound good initially. It
[32:36] it may seem like it's going to help and
[32:37] and and let me say this, some things do
[32:40] help. The problem with following that
[32:42] path is that it ignores God. It ignores
[32:44] the provided way God's provided. And if
[32:47] we ignore that, then we find that
[32:49] education will lead us down a road in
[32:51] science that will make us want to deny
[32:53] God and say, "Hey, I really didn't need
[32:55] God to be I don't need his provider way.
[32:57] I don't need his blood. I don't need his
[32:59] healing." And that's the problem with
[33:00] following that tree and following that
[33:02] thing. But brother Brandham draws a big
[33:04] distinction in the two because he says
[33:07] God has a provided way for his people to
[33:10] get their help. He's a very present help
[33:13] in the time of trouble. He is able to
[33:16] meet needs that we wouldn't even think
[33:18] that he's able to meet. God is able to
[33:21] answer in every situation and help in
[33:23] time of need. Whatever it may be, never
[33:25] underestimate what God can help in and
[33:27] what God wants to care in and what he
[33:29] wants to do. Whether it's your financial
[33:32] situation or emotional, whatever it is,
[33:35] never put God out of it and say, "This
[33:36] isn't in his category. I'm going to have
[33:38] to go see somebody about this." Let's
[33:40] bring God in first. And let's never uh
[33:44] limit God to him being able. He just
[33:47] said in the scripture that he's able to
[33:49] cleanse us from all unrighteousness. So
[33:51] that's pretty far powerful. So education
[33:54] and science and all these things these
[33:56] elements are are forces in the world.
[33:59] Now then they've weaved their way into
[34:01] Christianity. So it's not just the world
[34:03] now that those and brother Brand brings
[34:05] this out. You'll see it in the message.
[34:07] Now they've kind of weaved their way
[34:08] into Christianity to once again try to
[34:11] replace the real Holy Ghost connection
[34:14] with God. So even the church world buys
[34:17] into education and buys into too much of
[34:20] this stuff until they don't catch it.
[34:22] But the intent is Satan getting into
[34:24] Christianity to try to replace a real
[34:28] salvation, a real true Holy Ghost
[34:31] experience that God can really bring
[34:33] satis satisfaction to that individual.
[34:35] And he refers to an intellectual
[34:38] conception of the word. It will never be
[34:40] enough an intellectual conception of the
[34:42] word. Whether it's today in the message
[34:44] or 20 years ago or 100 years ago, we
[34:48] don't want to follow the path of just
[34:50] having an intellectual conception of the
[34:52] word because it'll never be enough to
[34:55] bring total deliverance.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; And he's drawing that distinction. Uh
[35:00] growing up around the message is good.
[35:03] Growing up in a Christian home is good,
[35:05] but it's not going to be enough in the
[35:07] day we live in. It's not going to be
[35:09] enough. Can you say amen? Education
[35:11] won't be enough. Education in the word
[35:13] won't be enough. It's wonderful. We
[35:16] train here. We train the children. We
[35:17] should do that. But at the end of the
[35:19] day, all of that's good and God can use
[35:21] it, but it's not going to be enough to
[35:23] fight the demons that we have today.
[35:25] It's going to take the God's provided
[35:27] way that every person has to come. Amen.
[35:30] So now they the world will present that
[35:33] they have the answer. And so if you've
[35:35] got a problem, they have the answer.
[35:37] They have a path to go down. They have a
[35:38] way that's we read the scripture a
[35:41] couple weeks ago. There's a way that
[35:42] seemth right unto a man, but the end
[35:44] thereof is destruction. So they always
[35:47] have an answer. They always have a way.
[35:49] But many times it's without God in it.
[35:52] Uh it won't allow God in it. And most of
[35:54] the time it will draw us away from more
[35:57] and more further away than from God's
[36:00] true answer uh away from the way.
[36:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; It'll draw us away from the way, the one
[36:08] and only way, the provided way. And
[36:10] brother Brandham says it. He says, God
[36:12] has a provided way for everything. And
[36:15] God has a provided way in every
[36:17] generation for the people to come to.
[36:20] &gt;&gt; You just got to find that way. Yeah.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; And then science and education, they'll
[36:24] try to replace the way for that hour.
[36:26] But there's a path in Noah's day. There
[36:28] was a way. He provided a prophet. And
[36:30] then in under destructions, which I want
[36:33] to get into this next Wednesday night
[36:34] because he gets into it at the end of
[36:36] the sermon, is that that's the beautiful
[36:38] thing about God caring is that even
[36:40] people under judgments of God, how many
[36:44] knows I've been preaching about Josiah
[36:46] and Josiah rose in a revival, a personal
[36:49] revival. Even though the the prophet has
[36:52] said, "If I I'm still going to judge
[36:54] God's people, but because of your
[36:56] repentance and your tears and your
[36:58] brokenness, I'm going to give a revival
[37:00] during your time." So, the power of the
[37:03] power of repentance and the power of
[37:05] coming God's way is in Noah's day. He
[37:07] said Noah found grace in the eyes of the
[37:09] Lord. And the people who listened to
[37:11] him, they didn't come under the
[37:13] judgments. They were able to come into
[37:14] the ark because the ark was what God
[37:17] provided in that day. And in every
[37:20] generation, God has a provided way to
[37:22] come.
[37:23] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad of that?
[37:25] &gt;&gt; Boy, I'm glad he provided a way in this
[37:27] hour.
[37:28] &gt;&gt; This is when we really needed it.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; This is when we needed a God rich in
[37:32] mercy.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; When it gets AS BAD AS THIS, I'M SO GLAD
[37:35] HE provided a way for us.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now, uh, we have to realize we
[37:40] have to come, we the world takes us away
[37:42] from his way. But if we come God's way
[37:44] for any question or any need, we begin
[37:47] to open the window of him responding and
[37:51] stepping in with his power, with his
[37:54] grace, and God being stirred up, as it
[37:56] were. God being uh uh God being uh
[37:59] pleased, whatever what word you want to
[38:01] use, there's a certain way that we come
[38:03] to God that it pleases God. And when God
[38:05] is pleased, I keep referring back to the
[38:08] temple when Solomon and them build it
[38:09] and everything was in shape and
[38:11] everything was in order and the
[38:13] musicians everything in place and there
[38:15] was no idolatry around. It was a perfect
[38:17] situation and God just breathed it in.
[38:20] was so God was so pleased with the
[38:22] temple and the order and everything in
[38:25] place that just something spilled out of
[38:27] his whole being and he poured his glory
[38:30] into that temple that the place was just
[38:33] saturated with the glory of God until
[38:36] the minister couldn't preach.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; Now you apply that to your temple and
[38:40] say could God fill me with that much of
[38:42] his glory.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; But it's when the temple's in the right
[38:45] condition and we'll speak on that more
[38:47] this Sunday. we'll get into a little bit
[38:49] deeper. So now um God can as you uh come
[38:55] his way, it opens up a window of him to
[38:58] respond and step in and show that he
[39:01] cares in every situation. So now you
[39:04] might say, "Well, prayer is the answer."
[39:06] And when you don't have anything else to
[39:08] do, we pray. So prayer is the answer.
[39:10] And I agree with that. But I just wanted
[39:12] to put just just a little color around
[39:14] that is that we can't just say prayer is
[39:17] the answer. A lot of people pray, but
[39:20] it's not just that you pray. It's what
[39:22] you're saying in your prayer,
[39:24] &gt;&gt; right?
[39:25] &gt;&gt; It's the it's the faith behind your
[39:27] prayer. There's a lot of people that
[39:29] pray to God.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; And a lot of them in emergency
[39:32] situations.
[39:33] &gt;&gt; So, I'm beginning to see that it's it's
[39:35] it's not just that we pray. It's what
[39:38] you're saying in your prayer. It's what
[39:40] you're confessing in your prayer. It's
[39:42] what's behind your prayer. Is real faith
[39:45] behind your prayer? Is it a prayer?
[39:47] Because we can quickly just say, "Well,
[39:48] just pray what we need to pray. Let's
[39:50] just pray." And so, it just becomes
[39:52] words. But prayer is enhanced. There's a
[39:55] substance to our prayer. Number one,
[39:57] it's faith.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; And when you pray with your lips AND YOU
[40:00] HAVE NO FAITH, GOD KNOWS IT.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; God works OFF OF YOUR FAITH.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; GOD WORKS FROM WHERE YOUR HEART IS AND
[40:06] IN YOUR PRAYER. So he knows words that
[40:09] you're just mincing words and you're
[40:10] trying to impress God or whatever is
[40:12] with your prayer. That's not what the
[40:14] kind of prayer we bring. It's from the
[40:16] SUBSTANCE OF WHAT'S INSIDE OF US. Then
[40:18] we speak it. Can you say amen?
[40:20] &gt;&gt; And so our prayer is has to have faith
[40:22] behind it. It is a prayer uh it is a
[40:26] prayer that is wonderful. But if you had
[40:28] a beautiful prayer and you were holding
[40:31] hold on now hold on to your seat belts.
[40:33] We don't have any seat belts here but
[40:34] hold on to them. If it it could be a
[40:37] wonderful prayer, but holding a grudge
[40:39] against someone else, there's a problem
[40:42] with that prayer. And Jesus taught us
[40:44] that.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; So, it can be the most beautiful prayer
[40:47] to impress everybody, even if it's in
[40:49] front of everybody. And Jesus said, "But
[40:51] if you have ought against someone, if
[40:53] there's a grudge in your heart, Jesus
[40:55] spoke of that." He said, "Go make it to
[40:57] your brother right first."
[40:59] &gt;&gt; Why is he saying that? Because it's not
[41:01] just that you pray. There's a substance
[41:03] behind it. And when the substance is
[41:05] there, then you pray, then you confess.
[41:08] Now you're going to get results.
[41:12] &gt;&gt; Is it a prayer that's lacking
[41:13] forgiveness? Jesus also spoke of that in
[41:15] the most popular chapter when talks
[41:17] about faith. If you have faith, you you
[41:20] have you'll be able to move mountains.
[41:22] And right in the same scriptures, he's
[41:25] we believe for those things and and
[41:27] that's something we believe with all of
[41:28] our heart. But then he says when you
[41:30] stand praying, forgive. Right?
[41:32] &gt;&gt; So you cannot faith cannot be without
[41:35] forgiveness.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; Right?
[41:37] &gt;&gt; So what why am I saying those? Because
[41:40] prayer is the answer. But what's the
[41:42] substance of your prayer?
[41:44] &gt;&gt; You see everybody's offering up prayers.
[41:46] And matter of fact, there's if you don't
[41:48] know how to pray, they'll give you books
[41:49] to you learn how to pray in. You can
[41:51] repeat prayers. I never did care for
[41:54] that too much of just repeating prayers.
[41:56] But if you have to do that, but you see
[41:57] now that can get uh vain repetition that
[42:01] can get repetitive.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; And so God's interested in the substance
[42:05] that's going on behind the prayer. And
[42:07] and so now forgiveness is one thing. If
[42:10] it is uh it's asking for if you're
[42:13] asking for forgiveness in your prayer
[42:15] and not forgiving someone else,
[42:18] uh that's a prayer that's that's not
[42:20] going to it's not going to have power
[42:22] behind it.
[42:24] Is it a prayer with pride like the
[42:26] Pharisees who came? Can you imagine
[42:28] this? Come into the temple and there's a
[42:31] sinner there crying and praying just and
[42:34] he's, you know, he's looking at him like
[42:35] he's low life down there. And his
[42:38] prayers, I thank thee, oh my father.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; I thank THEE, OH LORD. I THANK THEE that
[42:45] I'm not like that.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; That's what he said.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; What kind of prayer is that? AND IT
[42:52] SOUNDED GOOD AND IT, you know, probably
[42:54] had an Italian accent. I don't know. IT
[42:57] WAS JUST SO WONDERFUL. I THANK THEE LORD
[43:00] that I am not like this sinner down
[43:03] here. And anytime we have that kind of
[43:05] thing behind a pride behind us, I don't
[43:08] care how much in years we've been in the
[43:10] message. If we have that kind of I I
[43:12] just I don't think God is impressed
[43:15] &gt;&gt; with how great that prayer is when we
[43:18] put a person in a category that we're
[43:20] better than them.
[43:21] And Jesus said he was sitting there. He
[43:23] was unworthy to even get up and hold up
[43:26] his head. I'm a sinner. I need your
[43:28] grace. And God was impressed with that
[43:30] prayer because it didn't have pride in
[43:32] it.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; You see? So why are you saying this,
[43:35] brother of all? Because we say we need
[43:36] to pray. We need to pray. But you see,
[43:38] there has to be a substance behind our
[43:40] prayer.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; There has to be certain elements to our
[43:43] prayer.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; And we want to pray deep within our
[43:46] hearts that we're the right vessel and
[43:47] things are right that there be
[43:49] substance. to do. We don't want a pious
[43:50] prayer to say I'm good and I thank you
[43:53] that I'm not at least you know we do
[43:55] levels at least at least I'm not as bad
[43:57] as that person
[43:59] &gt;&gt; you know and we give our our resume with
[44:01] our prayer
[44:03] &gt;&gt; you know Lord you know come on now give
[44:05] me some credit at least I'm not like
[44:06] that
[44:07] &gt;&gt; but in reality you are like that
[44:09] &gt;&gt; can I get an amen
[44:11] &gt;&gt; and that's THE GRACE OF GOD YOU ARE LIKE
[44:13] THAT WE'RE ALL LIKE THAT WE'RE ALL
[44:15] SINNERS SAVED BY GRACE WE'RE ALL CAPABLE
[44:17] OF SIN in our lives so whatever We reach
[44:19] the place that we're elect and they're
[44:21] not and all these other things that we
[44:23] come to even in the message. We are
[44:24] certainly off track and you cannot pray
[44:26] the prayer of faith the way God wants to
[44:29] be impressed by it when you have pride
[44:32] behind your prayer.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; Repeating prayers may not be enough. The
[44:36] Catholics beat on that all the time and
[44:38] and they people Catholics beat
[44:40] themselves up and how many Hail Marys
[44:43] they can say I've been in some some of
[44:44] their services like at a wedding and say
[44:46] you know here hail Mary love of go hail
[44:49] Mary mother of god you and whatever it
[44:52] is and they and they so many prayers
[44:54] that they repeat is more credit I guess
[44:57] I don't know how that works I should
[44:59] have looked it up but you know and I I'm
[45:01] not blasting the people of Catholic but
[45:03] I'm just saying that someone has
[45:04] deceived us into thinking that by more
[45:07] repetitive prayers and the Hail Marys
[45:09] that we get credits for that or we do
[45:11] penance for that and we can pay back for
[45:13] our sins. That's a lie.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; That's a deception.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, I'm saying this
[45:20] about prayer because substance has to be
[45:23] behind our prayer and it's got to be
[45:26] behind our worship. So, now what
[45:28] substance are we talking about? The
[45:31] substance isn't it's not that we're
[45:33] perfect. Uh it's actually it's another
[45:36] way is is that in our prayers we're
[45:39] admitting that we're not perfect
[45:41] &gt;&gt; that we're not strong.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; I think God is more impressed with
[45:46] somebody who's admitting that they're
[45:48] not strong but he's strong.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; I think God likes the confession that we
[45:54] are weak and he is strong.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. So, you know, I'm a brother
[45:59] pastor sent me a book called A Praying
[46:02] Life and I'm just halfway through it,
[46:03] but I'm really enjoying it. And one of I
[46:05] was going to bring it tonight and read
[46:06] from and I I left it at the house. But
[46:08] it speaks that it speaks about prayer.
[46:11] It says a lot of Christians don't know
[46:13] how to pray because they got this big
[46:14] thing in their mind and we hesitate to
[46:16] pray. Number one, we don't feel worthy
[46:18] to pray. But when we go to pray, we feel
[46:20] like we have to be perfect. We have to
[46:22] present oursel perfect and we have to
[46:24] say the perfect words and we have to
[46:26] make sure that God on the level he's on.
[46:30] God's at a different level. So we've GOT
[46:32] TO SOMEHOW SAY IT RIGHT TO IMPRESS him
[46:34] because he's on a different level than
[46:35] us. Well, he is on a different level
[46:37] than us. But he likes his children to
[46:40] actually to speak like children
[46:43] &gt;&gt; because didn't Jesus say bring up the
[46:46] little child as they were fighting over
[46:47] who the greatest was. You know who's
[46:50] who's being the children here? Who's
[46:52] being childish? The disciples were.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; We talked to our mom and we was having a
[46:57] conversation the other day and we were
[46:58] wondering who's who takes over after
[47:00] you're gone and who's going to be at
[47:01] your right hand and who's going to be at
[47:03] your left and and you know, he just
[47:04] brings up a child and says, you know,
[47:06] this is the greatest in the kingdom of
[47:08] God. If you'll receive the kingdom like
[47:10] this child and he's he's taking a real
[47:12] stab at their pride right there,
[47:15] &gt;&gt; if you'll receive it. So, it's receiving
[47:17] it. And this book is really neat because
[47:19] it shows a little bit how children are
[47:21] when they're real young especially and
[47:23] they start to talk. You never know
[47:25] WHAT'S GOING TO COME OUT OF THEIR MOUTH
[47:26] next
[47:28] &gt;&gt; and it's actually embarrassing and you
[47:31] know it's it's but the thing is is that
[47:35] you know we don't condemn them if you
[47:36] know some children they they learn to
[47:39] walk later than other ones. you know,
[47:42] uh, Indie was right away. You know, I
[47:44] think she just come out of my mom's
[47:46] belly and started walking, it seemed
[47:47] like, and she's going at it now. Titus
[47:50] is just catching it. You know, it's just
[47:51] he's one now. He's just now catching it.
[47:54] And but he's catching it good. The last
[47:56] few days he's going, you know, before
[47:58] last week, Titus was walking like a
[48:01] mummy across the floor like this, you
[48:03] know, and but this week he straightened
[48:06] it out and he's looking a little bit
[48:07] more normal. It takes a while. But you
[48:09] know, if you you wouldn't take a child
[48:12] that's late in learning how to walk and
[48:14] condemn them. Say, "That's really good,
[48:15] bud. You know, you're you're two you're
[48:17] three years old. That's really good, but
[48:19] you should have been doing that back
[48:21] when you were one."
[48:23] &gt;&gt; We don't say that to children.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; If a kid waits till he's two or three
[48:27] years old, we leave that out. We're
[48:29] happy they're walking.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Shouldn't we be that way with other
[48:33] people?
[48:34] &gt;&gt; Isn't God that way with us? You can't
[48:37] run until you learn how to walk. And God
[48:39] doesn't condemn you if you don't know
[48:41] how to walk early like the rest of the
[48:42] people. BUT WHEN YOU LEARN HOW TO WALK,
[48:44] THERE'S A CELEBRATION.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; TITUS, WE CLAP FOR HIM CONSTANTLY. WHEN
[48:49] THEY LEARN TO WALK, NO MATTER WHAT AGE,
[48:51] I MEAN, IF YOU DON'T WALK TILL you're 10
[48:53] years old, we're going to celebrate you.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; We're still GOING TO SAY, "OH, YOU
[48:58] [screaming] GOT IT. PRAISE THE LORD."
[48:59] ALL RIGHT. GOOD KID. You know, you hold
[49:02] that in your heart and say, "I don't
[49:03] know what took him till 10 YEARS OLD."
[49:05] BUT ANYWAY, WE'RE HAPPY [laughter] THAT
[49:06] YOU'RE WALKING. GOD,
[49:09] &gt;&gt; these kids say something and blurt it
[49:11] out. No matter how honest it is, no
[49:14] matter sometimes how wrong it is, if
[49:16] they're crying, whatever it is, they
[49:18] whatever is here, they it just express
[49:20] it. They just blurt it out.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; And we shouldn't be parents that just we
[49:24] have to correct the wrong things, I'm
[49:26] sure. But you think we the thing is
[49:27] we're careful about that because that
[49:29] childlike they don't know any better
[49:31] yet. But God God is saying, Christ was
[49:34] saying, "I actually God actually likes
[49:37] you to come like that
[49:39] &gt;&gt; and be honest and just say what you're
[49:42] feeling."
[49:44] &gt;&gt; Don't try to impress God.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; Don't try to be a God.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; We're children.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; So, he wants YOU TO JUST START UNLOADING
[49:52] ON HIM AND START SAYING, "GOD, and then
[49:54] when you get to a positive co, I believe
[49:56] you can do it. I believe you're able."
[49:58] And all this, BUT WE DON'T WANT TO TRY
[49:59] TO IMPRESS GOD WITH OUR WORDS. WE WANT
[50:01] TO BE LIKE LITTLE CHILDREN. AND WHATEVER
[50:03] IT IS, LET IT OUT.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Come as a child. In
[50:11] other words, be real.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; Blurt it out.
[50:16] Be humble that you don't know
[50:18] everything.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; That's a child. Sometimes they do act
[50:22] like they know everything, but we know
[50:23] that they don't. Sometimes the that that
[50:27] not knowing everything blurts out. It's
[50:29] because of their age. God wants us to
[50:31] be. Not that we know everything that we
[50:33] humble ourselves in our prayer and our
[50:35] confession. So I'm going to ask again,
[50:38] it's not just prayer. It's the substance
[50:42] behind our prayer. So what is the
[50:44] substance? What's the what's the major
[50:46] substance we're learning from he cares?
[50:47] Do you care? What is the provided way
[50:50] that opens more faith and triggers the
[50:53] heart of God to step in in a
[50:56] supernatural way? That's what this
[50:58] that's what this study is all about.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; What is what is it that we have on our
[51:04] lips and that we confess and that we
[51:06] pray that triggers what's the provided
[51:09] way to come that triggers the hearts of
[51:11] God heart of God. So we come to the the
[51:15] uh a bit of the sum of the services now
[51:18] and he cares do you care? We're coming
[51:19] to the end. He cares do you care? So
[51:22] what is the simple provided way of God?
[51:26] And in this quote, we read it a couple
[51:27] weeks ago, but this is to me, this is
[51:29] the summon the of the entire sermon.
[51:31] This is the provided way. And when we
[51:33] come God's provided way, then we open
[51:36] the door for God to show that he cares.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; Because when we come God's provided way,
[51:42] we show we care.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:45] When we come God's provided way, no
[51:47] matter how humbling, no matter how
[51:49] embarrassing, no matter how what it is,
[51:52] when we come his provided way, when we
[51:55] show we care by that, then he shows he
[51:58] cares.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; And he says it four or five times. He
[52:01] says, "When we show we care, then God
[52:03] shows that he cares.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; We have to show we care first."
[52:07] You see, so that quote, if you guys got
[52:10] it, um God's provided way is repentance,
[52:15] confession, and showing
[52:18] a results bringing forth fruit, meat for
[52:21] repentance, showing sincerity. That that
[52:23] sentence probably describes the whole he
[52:26] cares, do you care principle that I've
[52:28] been presenting? How do we show we care?
[52:30] What's the provided way? It is. And this
[52:33] is I I don't know if you were expecting
[52:35] something else, something super duper
[52:37] super spiritual, but it's right back to
[52:39] the things of repentance,
[52:42] confession, and showing results. So
[52:45] repentance, confession, results,
[52:47] bringing forth fruit for repentance.
[52:49] There's about three things there.
[52:51] Showing sincerity because in all in
[52:54] repentance and confession and showing
[52:56] results, it you have to have sincerity
[52:59] running through all of that. the depth
[53:01] of sincerity. Remember in the message he
[53:03] talks about, you know, he being
[53:06] insincere with his wife and repenting to
[53:08] her. You know, this woman when I was
[53:10] overseas talked to me and so, you know,
[53:13] you understand, oh, gal, you know, and
[53:14] he's just kind of insincere in his
[53:16] repentance. He's not sincere about it.
[53:17] So, he brings that out. So, sincerity is
[53:20] the thread that runs through the
[53:21] repentance, the confession, because we
[53:23] want real repentance. We want real
[53:25] confession. We want real results.
[53:27] Somebody wants real results. Amen.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; So, you know, like he said a few weeks
[53:31] ago about the medicine, if you said you
[53:33] took the medicine, you said you
[53:35] repented, then you're going to see the
[53:36] results of the medicine.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; And if you don't see the results of the
[53:39] medicine, you didn't take the medicine
[53:41] even though you said you took it.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; So now, when we take this medicine and
[53:45] we took it the right way, it's going to
[53:47] get results. It's going to show fruits
[53:49] because it's God's medicine. But we when
[53:51] we come a sincere way of repentance and
[53:53] confession, it's going to show results.
[53:55] It's going to show fruit to it. And if
[53:57] it's not, then something's lacking in
[53:59] our sincerity. We're looking for God to
[54:01] come in. If you people will just do that
[54:04] this morning, that's going to be prayed
[54:06] for. And you people that hear this tape
[54:08] all over the world and after this tape
[54:10] is played and the minister or the person
[54:13] that's playing it in a congregation
[54:15] groups out in the jungles or wherever
[54:17] you are that's playing it will first
[54:20] make your confession clear
[54:22] and then come with nothing in your heart
[54:25] at all but faith. You know this is
[54:27] cleaning of the heart out just cleaning
[54:30] out. You know you can't have things
[54:31] hanging on you.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; You take care of that first.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Cleanse it. That's what I said about
[54:36] Josiah. He didn't get all inspired and
[54:38] say, "Oh, God, send your glory down to
[54:40] the temple right now." He knew you
[54:42] couldn't ask for God's glory when the
[54:44] temple was in such a state.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Temple had to be clean first.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; The spirit, your your temple, your
[54:50] spirit, your mind, you can't come.
[54:52] That's why there's a little bit of a
[54:53] hint when we come to church that we
[54:55] don't just it's not when the saints come
[54:57] dragging in. You know, you prepare
[54:59] yourself. Pray a little bit Saturday
[55:01] night or, you know, before you come in
[55:02] the afternoon. I know it's hard. you're
[55:04] busy and you're tired on Wednesday
[55:05] nights, but just go into your heart.
[55:07] Say, "Lord, prepare my heart. Forgive me
[55:09] of my sins, Lord.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Prepare my heart for the service
[55:12] tonight. Don't just come cold turkey."
[55:15] &gt;&gt; You don't do that at Thanksgiving.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; Don't just come cold turkey, but prepare
[55:20] your the way our temple is that we clean
[55:22] our temple out. Clean our minds out.
[55:24] Settle our minds. God, forgive me what I
[55:27] said. And I've had to ask forgiveness
[55:28] this morning. I had a a little
[55:30] interaction there with one of my kids. I
[55:32] had to make it right. You can't come up
[55:34] here and preach unless you make things
[55:35] right. But it's hard when you have those
[55:37] incidents take place.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; It it it hinders your spirit
[55:41] &gt;&gt; tonight. You know, that still hinders me
[55:43] a little bit. Uh but I I want to I want
[55:45] to be faithful to my call of duty. But I
[55:47] want to be honest with you, too. Those
[55:49] little things that happen or big things,
[55:51] they they they wound our spirit.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; And we quickly got to deal with it and
[55:56] say, "God, heal my spirit of that and
[55:58] forgive me for saying that. Forgive me
[56:00] for yelling. Forgive me for doing that.
[56:02] I I shouldn't have done that. You can't
[56:04] let those things hang on you for days.
[56:06] We want to clear them out because then
[56:08] we if you're nothing in your heart but
[56:10] faith and be prayed for. Listen to this
[56:12] now. If if you confess and you your
[56:15] confession's clear, you come with
[56:16] nothing in your heart all but faith and
[56:18] be prayed for. There is the medicine
[56:20] will take place.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; That sounds like a guarantee.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; If you come the right provided way,
[56:27] &gt;&gt; the medicine will take effect
[56:30] &gt;&gt; because it's not your medicine. is God's
[56:31] medicine.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; And this medicine, what I called it a
[56:34] few weeks ago, the gospel.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; This is the gospel. This is the good
[56:39] news.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; This is God's medicine. This is in the
[56:42] doctors, is God's medicine. And he says
[56:44] it's a guaranteed cure for anything
[56:46] that's wrong. Can you say amen? AND YOU
[56:49] SET YOURSELF WHEN YOU COME, GOD'S
[56:51] provided way of repentance, full
[56:53] confession, full God, I and help me Lord
[56:56] never to do it again. You offer UP THAT
[56:58] HEART. YOU DON'T BRING THE power of God.
[57:00] He comes himself and the medicine takes
[57:02] effect.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; But the medicine can't take effect until
[57:06] you come God's provided way. And the
[57:08] provided way is saying is real
[57:12] repentance, real confession, and real
[57:16] fruits of repentance and confession.
[57:18] Three things. Real repentance, real
[57:21] confession,
[57:23] and real fruits of repentance and
[57:25] confession.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Real repentance, real confession, and
[57:29] real results. How many want that?
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Real repentance. Real confession. I'm
[57:34] not talking about put on or phony.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Real repentance.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Real confession.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; Real results.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; You know, God is a resultsoriented God.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; I like faith preachers uh that are
[57:53] they're real resultsoriented
[57:56] preachers. They want to see the results
[57:58] of this. Where is the Lord God of
[58:00] Elijah?
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[58:03] &gt;&gt; We had Elijah in this day, but where's
[58:04] the Lord God of Elijah?
[58:06] &gt;&gt; And they don't want to come to church.
[58:07] They want to see results. They want to
[58:09] see this supernatural God in action.
[58:11] They want to see a revival, a personal
[58:13] revival in their heart. They want to see
[58:15] some results. It's not just that we pray
[58:17] and we come to church and fill the duty.
[58:19] No, we're we should be a resultsoriented
[58:21] people. WE SHOULD HEAR TESTIMONIES of
[58:23] what God has done.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:26] God's working among us. Can you say
[58:28] amen?
[58:29] &gt;&gt; One of the assistant pastors for brother
[58:31] Yvonne was telling me the other night
[58:32] and he's just sharing his heart with me
[58:34] and he said I felt a little call to the
[58:37] ministry but he said I ran away from it
[58:39] and his wife had her was going to have
[58:42] her first baby and come to full term and
[58:44] then she had trouble at the end. that
[58:46] baby was she's laying in the hospital
[58:48] and that baby had died and uh in in the
[58:51] mom's womb and you know he went to
[58:53] repenting before God and sorry God I ran
[58:56] from your calling and you know just kind
[58:58] of just confessing and the child was
[59:01] already gone and so something rose in
[59:03] his heart. He went to his wife. They
[59:06] prayed the prayer of faith and you know
[59:08] that baby come back to life and that
[59:09] baby's still living today.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; Baby was dead. You talk about astounding
[59:13] the doctors. Amen.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; That baby come back to life. And a lot
[59:16] of times God wants to see our reaction,
[59:20] &gt;&gt; our confession. Can you say amen?
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Where do we say? So it has to be real
[59:24] and it has to show results to see the b
[59:27] power of God take over the fruits of God
[59:29] come from it. We want to see fruits. We
[59:31] want to be a resultoriented
[59:33] people. Can you say amen? And we're not
[59:36] say, "Well, God, you better do it today
[59:37] or I'm not going to believe." Whenever
[59:39] God wants to do it, but we're still
[59:40] under expectation. We're
[59:42] resultsoriented.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; You say, "I want God to restore my
[59:45] family." Well, you hold that faith. If
[59:48] you have to hold it for five years, you
[59:50] hold that faith there. I'm looking for
[59:52] God to restore my marriage and family
[59:54] &gt;&gt; because why? We're resultsoriented. I'm
[59:57] going to confess. I'm going to do
[59:58] everything I can, but I'm not going to
[59:59] give up because I'm not just a a
[1:00:02] repenting kind of Christian. I'm not
[1:00:04] just confessing. I'm a resultsoriented
[1:00:07] Christian.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; I'm looking for God to bring the
[1:00:09] results.
[1:00:11] Glory.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; So it's it's sincerity is the thread
[1:00:16] that runs through these things. It's
[1:00:18] deeper than the surface of but it's when
[1:00:21] it's deeper and sincerity is in these
[1:00:23] things. It will produce the fruit. So
[1:00:26] it's three things and I thought I'd
[1:00:28] break them down tonight. It won't be
[1:00:29] very long. still catching up from the
[1:00:32] trip myself, but I thought I would break
[1:00:34] these down a little bit just in case we
[1:00:36] don't understand what real repentance
[1:00:38] is, what real confession is. Uh the best
[1:00:42] place to read is what we in He Cares You
[1:00:43] Care when he really elaborates on
[1:00:45] confession. Really important subject
[1:00:47] because he elaborated on it quite a bit.
[1:00:49] remember he talked about this the
[1:00:50] meeting in New York and there wasn't
[1:00:52] wasn't too many results and God woke
[1:00:54] them up in the in the motel and said you
[1:00:56] go down there and call a confession and
[1:00:58] a repentance in those people because
[1:01:00] there was a lack of confession. There's
[1:01:01] a lot of stuff hanging in their lives
[1:01:03] and that's why God couldn't do more
[1:01:04] miracles.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; So he went down that night didn't have I
[1:01:07] don't think he had a prayer line. He
[1:01:08] says we're going to call for a
[1:01:10] repentance. They repented and then the
[1:01:11] whole meeting turned around because
[1:01:13] confession getting things out
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; being transparent to the Lord,
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; devils start to run.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; Devils start to run.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; So just in case in and the third thing
[1:01:25] of real results. Uh let's talk about
[1:01:27] this a little bit tonight. Um real
[1:01:30] repentance, biblical repentance means a
[1:01:34] fundamental change of mind and heart. In
[1:01:37] the Greek, it's metanonia. That involves
[1:01:40] recognizing sin as offensive to God. So,
[1:01:44] we know sin is offensive to God. But
[1:01:47] repentance is a is a recognition or a a
[1:01:50] change of mind. Brother Bram said that
[1:01:52] repentance isn't just saying sorry. It's
[1:01:54] a change.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; So, the first thing that changes is a
[1:01:59] change of mind. Your life may not be
[1:02:01] changed quite yet. that comes more as
[1:02:04] the confessing and devils run and things
[1:02:06] but the it's initial it's almost
[1:02:08] mechanical a little bit although we know
[1:02:10] it's God that leads you to repentance
[1:02:12] and if he leads you to repent you better
[1:02:14] repent you should repent but you see now
[1:02:16] repentance is a change of mind and what
[1:02:18] are you changing that you change your
[1:02:20] mind that sin is offensive to God and if
[1:02:24] my sin is offensive to God then I'm
[1:02:27] repenting because it's offensive to me
[1:02:29] if whatever is offensive to God is
[1:02:31] offensive to me
[1:02:33] That's rep. That's when somebody's
[1:02:34] really repenting. They've come to a
[1:02:36] change of mind that I see the damage my
[1:02:39] sin has done. I see it's been offensive
[1:02:41] to God. Remember when Joseph and
[1:02:44] Pontifer's wife putting pressure on him
[1:02:46] to have relations and stuff? And you
[1:02:48] remember what he said? How can I do this
[1:02:50] sin before my God?
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; It wasn't just your husband will catch
[1:02:55] us. We'll be caught. It was first, his
[1:02:57] first fear was a fear of God. How could
[1:03:01] I do this and ruin MY RELATIONSHIP WITH
[1:03:03] GOD?
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; NOW, YOU SHOULD HAVE A SOBERNESS. If
[1:03:06] it's your wife or your husband, you
[1:03:08] should have a soberness of that. How
[1:03:09] could you hurt your husband or wife like
[1:03:11] that?
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; How could you play around like that? But
[1:03:14] but it's not good enough just to have
[1:03:16] that fear for your wife or husband. You
[1:03:17] got to have it for God first. He said,
[1:03:19] "How can I do this sin against my God?"
[1:03:22] And that's when somebody, you know,
[1:03:23] Joseph didn't know do anything wrong
[1:03:24] with the type of Christ. But you see now
[1:03:27] when someone makes a mistake, when
[1:03:29] someone falls, then the first step is
[1:03:32] real repentance. It's not just saying
[1:03:34] I'm sorry. It's not just saying I'm
[1:03:36] sorry because you got caught.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Our kids do that, don't they? It's not
[1:03:42] just saying sorry because you got
[1:03:43] caught. But there's a soberness to it
[1:03:46] that this is a serious thing that I have
[1:03:48] done. And
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; that's why I'm making it right because
[1:03:52] it's been it involves recognizing sin as
[1:03:55] an offense to God. Josiah rent his
[1:03:57] clothes and cried. It's it's recognizing
[1:04:00] sin as an offense to God. Turning away
[1:04:03] from sinful behavior. That's repentance.
[1:04:06] And turning towards God. Here's
[1:04:07] repentance now. It's recognizing your
[1:04:09] sin as an offense to God. It's turning
[1:04:12] away from the sinful behavior. That's
[1:04:14] repentance. It's like somebody says
[1:04:16] sorry, they go back to the same thing
[1:04:18] the next day. something's wrong with
[1:04:20] your repentance. I'M TELLING IT LIKE IT
[1:04:22] is tonight. We want deeper repentance
[1:04:24] and that is not just saying I'm sorry,
[1:04:27] but we see some fruits from it.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; So the second part even of repentance is
[1:04:33] not just we are moved that the the sin
[1:04:36] is offensive to God, but we turn away
[1:04:38] from the sinful behavior. And you know
[1:04:40] what we turn to? We turn towards God.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; It's God- centered now.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; That's repentance. Now I'm going to have
[1:04:48] a Christc centered life. I'm going have
[1:04:50] a God- centered life because what got me
[1:04:52] into trouble is I wasn't centered on
[1:04:54] Christ enough.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; So in my repentance now I'm I'm uh the
[1:05:00] sin is offensive to God. I'm turning
[1:05:02] away from the sinful behavior. I'm
[1:05:04] getting away from the things that's
[1:05:06] causing this. I'm distancing myself big
[1:05:09] time. I'll talk about that on Sunday a
[1:05:12] little bit as well. But and I'm turning
[1:05:14] towards God. It is a two-part process of
[1:05:17] sorrow for sin and commitment to live a
[1:05:19] new life that honors God. This involves
[1:05:21] more than just feeling remorse. It is a
[1:05:24] transforming act of forsaking wrongdoing
[1:05:27] and returning to a relationship with
[1:05:29] God. That's repentance.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; Can I say it is a transforming act of
[1:05:35] forsaking wrongdoing.
[1:05:37] There's change. Brother says repentance
[1:05:39] is not just it's change. Something's
[1:05:43] changing. And you see those fruits are
[1:05:45] changed. So in the biblical repentance,
[1:05:48] it's a change of mind. The Greek word
[1:05:50] for repentance is to change one's mind a
[1:05:52] new way. Turning from sin and turning to
[1:05:56] God. A comprehensive change that is a
[1:05:58] deep and transforming change that
[1:06:00] affects one's entire way. Listen now.
[1:06:02] It's a change that affects one's entire
[1:06:04] way of thinking, feeling, and behaving.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; That's when God's dealing with somebody
[1:06:08] in repentance. It's affecting their
[1:06:10] whole being.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; It's affecting their behavior.
[1:06:14] I may not have the strength yet to get
[1:06:16] this right, but I'm focused on God
[1:06:18] changed my behavior.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; David said and and and every time I look
[1:06:22] up who had the greatest confession and
[1:06:24] and and fruits, I looked it up today.
[1:06:26] Who had the best the greatest fruits
[1:06:28] from their confession of their sin? And
[1:06:30] everybody points to David. Thorough
[1:06:33] repentance. Forgive me. Purge me with
[1:06:36] hissup. Psalms 51, build the walls of
[1:06:39] Jerusalem so I'll never do this again.
[1:06:42] That's a repentance.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Recognizing the offense of sin. It
[1:06:47] involves acknowledging the sin is not
[1:06:48] only wrong, but it also off it's
[1:06:50] offensive to God and an act of will.
[1:06:52] Repentance as a choice to forget forsake
[1:06:55] one's old ways and commit to a new path
[1:06:57] of correction and truth. So I agree with
[1:06:59] a lot of that uh from the writers
[1:07:02] because this is what it is. This is what
[1:07:04] brother Brandham said. It was what the
[1:07:05] scripture says it is. It's not. It's
[1:07:07] something deeper and more below the
[1:07:09] surface than just merely saying I'm
[1:07:12] sorry.
[1:07:14] Now, let's move to the next one. Real
[1:07:16] confession. We got still have some time
[1:07:17] here. Real confessions. We have real
[1:07:20] repentance.
[1:07:22] And now we have real confession.
[1:07:26] And confession goes much deeper than
[1:07:28] repentance.
[1:07:30] It really shows repentance is real.
[1:07:34] When you have a confession of truth, a
[1:07:37] confession of truth, if re if the
[1:07:39] repentance is just feeling bad for what
[1:07:42] you did or feeling bad that you got
[1:07:44] caught, um, and you never acknowledge it
[1:07:49] verbally or clarify what you did, you're
[1:07:52] you don't want to do that. You don't
[1:07:54] want to acknowledge what you did wrong.
[1:07:56] You don't want to confess what you did
[1:07:57] wrong. you don't want to clarify what
[1:07:59] you did and pinpoint exactly what you
[1:08:02] did wrong and who I hurt. If if if a
[1:08:04] person's not coming out with that and
[1:08:06] saying it, then they they probably
[1:08:09] stopped at the at the surface level of
[1:08:12] just repenting.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Okay. So when verbally things are coming
[1:08:18] out that begins to identify who I hurt,
[1:08:23] what I did wrong, how I sometimes it's
[1:08:26] how I got there.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it takes a while for a person
[1:08:29] to say, "How did I get here? How in the
[1:08:30] world did I do that?" But you should go
[1:08:32] to prayer and say, "God, reveal to me
[1:08:35] because in my confession, somebody asked
[1:08:37] for my testimony. I want to be a
[1:08:39] blessing to someone else to share, hey,
[1:08:41] this is how I got here." And every time
[1:08:44] you do that, you expose the de the
[1:08:45] devil's tricks.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; That's the thing about confession IS IT
[1:08:48] EXPOSES THE DEVIL. THERE'S A FREEDOM
[1:08:50] WITH IT. THE DEVIL'S RUN. They can't
[1:08:52] stand confession.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; This is how I got into this trouble.
[1:08:56] This is what I did. I'm owning up to it.
[1:08:58] And it's just these things come out of
[1:09:00] the mouth. That is something that's
[1:09:02] acknowledging acknowledging what took
[1:09:04] place. You will never acknowledge it
[1:09:06] verbally and clarify what you did if
[1:09:09] there's not true repentance there.
[1:09:10] Confession is verbally aligning itself
[1:09:14] with what the real truth is. You align
[1:09:17] your confession with truth. Now,
[1:09:20] sometimes that truth is the bad stuff
[1:09:21] first, but you got to own up to it.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; You got to confess it
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; and then we'll get to the end of this
[1:09:28] where he's the high priest of our
[1:09:30] confession.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; We begin to confess what God has done
[1:09:33] for us
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; and God also acts on that confession.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; So, it's not all negative. It's
[1:09:39] confessing the truth. I did this. I
[1:09:41] failed here. I'm sorry. I I God, please
[1:09:45] change me. Help me never to do that
[1:09:47] again. And it's talking. And sometimes
[1:09:48] you you don't have to share it with the
[1:09:50] whole world, but if you but you share
[1:09:51] your testimony. In other words, you're
[1:09:52] not trying to hide anything. You're not
[1:09:54] trying to be super spiritual to
[1:09:56] everybody.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; I mean, some people have been so honest
[1:10:02] with me. I'll tell you, it's But I
[1:10:04] always honor it as tough as and
[1:10:06] embarrassing as it is. There's a sister
[1:10:08] over there, a young sister. She started
[1:10:10] to share her testimony. She was asking
[1:10:12] me a question how to deal with certain
[1:10:13] things. And I'll tell you, my heart went
[1:10:15] out to her this things that happen
[1:10:18] sometimes around our ranks. It just
[1:10:20] broke my heart. And for her to be that
[1:10:23] honest and to trust me with that, to
[1:10:25] take it before the Lord and I'm going to
[1:10:26] be praying for her.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; But you're going to be a lot further
[1:10:31] along if you're confessing it.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; This is my story. This is my life. It's
[1:10:37] not a good one, but I'm putting it
[1:10:38] before the Lord. I'm want I want the
[1:10:41] devil to not use this in my life.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Confession is a beautiful thing. So,
[1:10:48] confession is verbally aligning yourself
[1:10:50] with what's the real truth.
[1:10:54] What really happened? Not a packaged
[1:10:56] version of what happened.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Not a repackaged presentation of what
[1:11:03] happened. What really happened?
[1:11:05] not watered down to protect yourself.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Someone who is good at talking can
[1:11:12] become very professional at talking
[1:11:14] their way out of things
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; because they're just good at it. Talking
[1:11:19] their way out of anything or hiding. And
[1:11:22] someone can do that if they're more
[1:11:24] quiet. You know, it's just they either
[1:11:26] hide it or they're professional at
[1:11:28] talking their way out of it. All of us
[1:11:30] can lean that direction because we want
[1:11:32] to put our best foot foot forward. put
[1:11:34] forward. We want to put our best foot
[1:11:36] forward to everybody. We don't want to
[1:11:39] be embarrassed in front of anybody.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; And I'm not here to say go embarrass
[1:11:43] yourself to the world. I'm saying true
[1:11:46] an confession is lining yourself with
[1:11:51] the truth.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Even if it hurts for a while.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Got to do it. Got to do it.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; You can't This is God's provided way.
[1:12:00] And you can't wiggle out any other way.
[1:12:03] You can't climb up. Didn't Jesus talk
[1:12:05] about those climbing up some other way.
[1:12:08] You can't climb up another way into the
[1:12:10] kingdom. You got to come his provided
[1:12:12] way.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; And aligning yourself with truth, not a
[1:12:15] package version. And someone who's so
[1:12:18] now in the Bible now, confession from
[1:12:20] the writers, the Greek word for that is
[1:12:23] homo uh homogo,
[1:12:26] which means to say the same thing.
[1:12:28] Confession means to say the same thing,
[1:12:30] to agree. And that what why what are you
[1:12:33] saying the same thing as as truth?
[1:12:36] You're agreeing with truth. And you're
[1:12:38] not only agreeing with what the truth
[1:12:39] is, you're confessing it.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Confessing is saying the same thing
[1:12:46] primarily. It has two key meanings.
[1:12:48] Acknowledging one's sins to God and
[1:12:50] publicly professing faith in Christ. So
[1:12:53] this goes deeper than just repenting to
[1:12:55] God. This is a a verbal public
[1:12:59] profession like when you come to the
[1:13:01] Lord uh if if there's a scripture that
[1:13:03] says how can they believe except there
[1:13:05] be a preacher and how and it goes
[1:13:07] through the steps and it says how can
[1:13:09] they unless they confess Jesus Christ
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; openly. I'm not ashamed of him. I'm
[1:13:15] confessing Jesus Christ. He's my Lord.
[1:13:17] I'll I'm repentant in his name. I I'll
[1:13:19] be baptized in front of anybody.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; So that I become a candidate to receive
[1:13:24] the Holy Ghost.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:13:26] Amen. So, confessions of sins, this form
[1:13:30] involves a genuine admission of personal
[1:13:33] wrongdoing, agreeing with God's
[1:13:35] assessment of the sin. It is necessary.
[1:13:37] It is a necessary condition to receiving
[1:13:40] forgiveness and cleansing. So, there's
[1:13:43] acknowledgement,
[1:13:45] recognizing and naming specific sins,
[1:13:48] thoughts, words, actions.
[1:13:51] Confession is number one recognizing and
[1:13:54] naming specific sins, thoughts, words,
[1:13:56] and actions without trying to justify or
[1:14:00] to excuse them. Another part of
[1:14:02] confession is linked to repentance.
[1:14:04] Confession is closely linked with
[1:14:06] repentance, which involves a sincere
[1:14:08] sorrow for sin, that it offends God and
[1:14:11] a commitment to turn away from that sin
[1:14:13] and realign one's life with God's will.
[1:14:16] Confession involves humility. It arises
[1:14:18] from a humble heart and a recognition of
[1:14:20] one's need for God's mercy and grace
[1:14:22] rather than as a way to earn
[1:14:24] forgiveness. I want you to catch that
[1:14:25] now. It does not confess because it's
[1:14:28] trying to earn forgiveness.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Do we want forgiveness? Yes. But the
[1:14:34] motive the motive has to be deeper than
[1:14:37] just I'm confessing because I want
[1:14:40] forgiveness from this person or I want
[1:14:42] forgiveness. The motive has to be a
[1:14:45] deeper recognizing your need for God's
[1:14:48] mercy and grace rather than a way to
[1:14:50] earn forgiveness.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; It's not putting a quick band-aid on
[1:14:55] your problem.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; It's not, okay, just let's just get this
[1:14:58] forgiveness done and get it over and and
[1:15:00] move on with life. I just want this all
[1:15:02] to go away.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; If you hear somebody say that,
[1:15:05] something's wrong.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Let God make it go away. Let God wash it
[1:15:10] away. But if you're quickly trying to
[1:15:12] get it to get a a forgiveness from
[1:15:14] somebody till they say they I forgive
[1:15:16] you. Okay, that's done. That's over. You
[1:15:18] shouldn't do it for that motive. So,
[1:15:20] it's part of forgiveness. But then the
[1:15:22] last thing, oh yeah, forgiveness is a
[1:15:24] part of confession. Scripture promises
[1:15:26] that when believers confess their sins,
[1:15:28] God is faithful and just to forgive our
[1:15:29] sins and to cleanse us from all
[1:15:31] unrighteousness. That's our text. To
[1:15:33] whom? It raises the question, who do we
[1:15:35] confess to? Number one, to the Lord.
[1:15:39] Yet in the scripture,
[1:15:41] you this is a pastor who reads this
[1:15:43] every now and then. While your
[1:15:46] confession is made primarily to God, the
[1:15:48] Bible also speaks of confessing sins to
[1:15:51] one another, your faults one to another.
[1:15:53] James 5:16, especially if the sin has
[1:15:57] harmed another person,
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; for the sake of reconciliation
[1:16:02] and mutual healing. I never understand
[1:16:05] people that go years and years and years
[1:16:07] and they don't think they have to talk
[1:16:09] about or reconcile what's been said,
[1:16:11] what's been done, the damage that's been
[1:16:13] done. We should be reaching out for
[1:16:15] reconciliation. And not a lot of times
[1:16:17] reconciliation is you're you're saying
[1:16:19] something to talk about it,
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; To make your part right, see if they'll
[1:16:25] say anything back. So, it's it's
[1:16:29] there is a place for confessing our
[1:16:31] faults to one another, especially if it
[1:16:33] has harmed another person. And as I've
[1:16:36] preached, it kind of opens up this
[1:16:39] spirit and atmosphere of freedom when we
[1:16:43] are willing to be open and as I said a
[1:16:46] few Sundays ago, broken with one
[1:16:49] another. I said in communion,
[1:16:52] God wants us to stay a broken people.
[1:16:55] Some people Jesus said Jesus said he
[1:16:58] that is whole needeth not a physician.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; They don't. They're okay. They're
[1:17:03] already together.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; But I'm not together.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; I'm broken.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; And I bring my brokenness to God. And I
[1:17:11] think the rest of us should be broken
[1:17:13] with one another.
[1:17:16] The Catholics have confessional booths
[1:17:20] and they, you know, I don't know where
[1:17:22] this come from, so I had to look it up,
[1:17:24] but it's the screen that they have in
[1:17:26] the two little rooms. The priest is in
[1:17:28] one room and they're in another. It
[1:17:29] allows the penet to confess her sins
[1:17:31] without being seen by the priest, which
[1:17:33] helps to ease embarrassment or shame and
[1:17:36] encourages a full and honest confession.
[1:17:40] So, the intent was to ease the pain of
[1:17:42] embarrassment or shame. I'm just a
[1:17:46] little leerary of
[1:17:48] presenting something that would ease the
[1:17:50] pain of our sin. God wants us to to to
[1:17:54] feel a bit of that.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; To bring us to a true repentance.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Uh the confession booster of privacy and
[1:18:03] confidentiality.
[1:18:04] The enclosed space ensures privacy and
[1:18:06] reinforces the strict seal of
[1:18:08] confession. It's a focus on God. It's a
[1:18:11] prevention of impropriy.
[1:18:14] The booths were created for a prevention
[1:18:15] of impropriy. Historically, the physical
[1:18:18] separation was introduced in the 16th
[1:18:20] century by Cardinal Charles Bome to
[1:18:23] prevent any potential for physical
[1:18:25] contact or inappropriate advances
[1:18:28] between the priest and the penitant.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:18:34] Ah, that's the whole thing of that is
[1:18:37] wrong. That's not encouraging true
[1:18:39] repentance at all
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; or true confession.
[1:18:43] They may confess in there, but there's
[1:18:45] not much results in their life.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Because it's formed to take out the
[1:18:52] conviction, take out the embarrassment,
[1:18:53] take out and cause a person to hide.
[1:18:56] There's no washing. It's just a
[1:18:58] confession without the sincerity and
[1:19:00] without there's no washing with God. If
[1:19:02] if we confess, God wants to wash us.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; If we confess our sins, he's faithful
[1:19:09] and just to forgive us our sins and and
[1:19:13] to cleanse us, wash us from all the
[1:19:17] unrighteousness, the power of the blood
[1:19:20] of Jesus Christ.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; The third thing was real results. The
[1:19:25] third part of God's provided way
[1:19:30] is a heart that says, "God,
[1:19:33] I'm repenting. I'm confessing. And I'm
[1:19:36] calling a God to come on the scene and
[1:19:38] change me
[1:19:40] that I would never do this again."
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; God changed me so that everyone can see
[1:19:50] the evidence of change. That's right.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; My family,
[1:19:56] my wife, my husband, let it not be just
[1:20:01] repentance and confession. That's only
[1:20:04] part of it. But Lord, come and show. Let
[1:20:07] me show the results.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Consistency that something has changed.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; Didn't John the Baptist say it to the
[1:20:14] Pharisees? Because they just wanted to
[1:20:16] be baptized [snorts]
[1:20:18] so they go tell they got baptized by the
[1:20:20] prophet. It was nothing more than that.
[1:20:22] They wanted to be popular. I can go say
[1:20:24] John the Baptist, the baptizer, baptized
[1:20:26] me. And they would have went down a dry
[1:20:28] sinner and come up a wet one.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; And and John the Baptist said, "Why? Go
[1:20:33] back and bring forth fruits of
[1:20:35] repentance.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Let me see your real heart in this word
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; to follow me as God's prophet."
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; So I want everyone to see the evidence
[1:20:45] of change. It's like it's like saying
[1:20:48] these signs shall follow them that
[1:20:51] believe. Every Christian believes that
[1:20:53] scripture. Can you say amen? It's not
[1:20:55] just a God of yesterday, but it's a God
[1:20:57] of today. And those that believe these
[1:20:59] signs shall follow them that believe.
[1:21:00] That's a results
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; God. Can you say amen? We don't make up
[1:21:04] the signs, but we believe. These signs
[1:21:06] shall follow them that believe.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; And what that's saying, there's this is
[1:21:10] a result God. In other words, if there's
[1:21:12] true repentance, if there's a true
[1:21:13] spirit, a true atmosphere and and the
[1:21:16] true preaching of the word, these signs
[1:21:18] shall follow them that believe.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Then the medicine takes effect and
[1:21:23] everybody can see the medicine.
[1:21:24] Everybody can see the the change. Can
[1:21:27] you say amen?
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; And it's a it's it's if this is God's
[1:21:31] provided way that the medicine of the
[1:21:34] power of the blood takes effect. The
[1:21:37] blood has power in it for all problems.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; It does.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; God proves it that the blood has power
[1:21:45] in it for all problems. And when we
[1:21:47] kick, when we have this sincere
[1:21:49] confession, the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:21:51] cleanses us. When we walk in the light
[1:21:53] as he's in the light and we're not
[1:21:55] living in darkness hiding things.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Our text said that
[1:22:01] if you say you walk in the light or
[1:22:03] you're walking with him and you live in
[1:22:05] darkness, you walk in darkness. That's
[1:22:07] true.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; You lie and do not the truth.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; You see, so we're not called to live in
[1:22:13] darkness privately and say that we're
[1:22:16] children of light.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; We live all the time in the light.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; We live as an open book. Amen.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; And if if the word comes and just
[1:22:24] exposes something and and how many's
[1:22:27] been Christians a while still God will
[1:22:28] take the spotlight of his word and just
[1:22:31] come and hone in and and just you know
[1:22:34] you can you raise your hand and all of a
[1:22:36] sudden it it puts light on something you
[1:22:39] go oh that's ugly.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; I didn't know that was still there.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; And it's the greatest thing that can
[1:22:45] happen to us.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. You stay around this word long
[1:22:49] enough. The Holy Spirit's here. He never
[1:22:52] lets us by with things. He loves us
[1:22:54] enough to come and tell us where we're
[1:22:55] wrong. He shines light on that area.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Some people have run from it. Some
[1:23:00] people have stayed around, but then they
[1:23:01] run because the word is too exposing
[1:23:04] sometimes and they don't see it as the
[1:23:05] love of God.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; But when he puts that spotlight on us,
[1:23:08] then it's important that God puts it
[1:23:11] there and you confess it and you bring
[1:23:12] it out because we can grow in the Lord
[1:23:14] and the blood of Jesus Christ comes in
[1:23:17] that light and cleanses us from all sin.
[1:23:20] I'm closing with that wonderful place in
[1:23:23] Hebrews where it refers to Christ as our
[1:23:27] high priest. Kenny, you can come and
[1:23:29] we're going to sing. The blood will
[1:23:31] never lose its power.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; You listening still?
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; He said so many places, he's the high
[1:23:37] priest of our profession.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; And he says that means he's the high
[1:23:42] priest of our confession.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; And so he said he can't act as our high
[1:23:47] priest. We have the blood, but we have a
[1:23:50] high priest to go to that can that can
[1:23:52] sympath can have sympathy with us
[1:23:54] because he's been he's been um tested in
[1:23:57] all manners. Our high priest, Christ.
[1:24:00] Aren't you glad tonight you have
[1:24:01] somebody higher than you to go to?
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; To confess to,
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; aren't you glad you have somebody higher
[1:24:07] than you?
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; We have a higher power to go to.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; And so if we and we have access to the
[1:24:13] blood through our high priest. And so,
[1:24:16] how do we get there? Confession. He's
[1:24:19] the high priest of our confession. And
[1:24:21] brother Brandham says he can't do
[1:24:23] nothing until that confession. When we
[1:24:25] begin to confess what he's done for us,
[1:24:28] that it's done. That's in a finished
[1:24:30] work at Calvary.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Our high priest begins to step into that
[1:24:35] confession. Can you imagine our high
[1:24:37] priest? I don't want to say up here
[1:24:38] because he's near us, but he's higher
[1:24:40] than us. And so, he is our high priest
[1:24:43] and he can be touched by the feeling of
[1:24:45] our infirmities. He wants to hear what
[1:24:47] you're feeling. He wants to hear what
[1:24:48] you're going through. He wants to hear
[1:24:50] your confession. Even if it's bad, our
[1:24:53] high priest is listening in to your
[1:24:55] confession. And the heart behind your
[1:24:56] confession is that he's impressed when
[1:24:59] there's a true confession.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; He can tell WHEN THERE'S A COVER UP.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; But our high priest, he's not there
[1:25:06] saying, "Oh, he's not judging us." No,
[1:25:08] he's there as a as a representative for
[1:25:11] us
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; to get to the blood. Amen.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; So what's he listening for to act?
[1:25:16] What's he listening for? Our confession.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; What are they saying? Are they hiding
[1:25:21] sin?
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Our priest says, "Ah,
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; there he did it. There she did it. She's
[1:25:27] completely He's completely opened up his
[1:25:30] whole life. He's confessed it.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; The high priest can act on that."
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; And then they move along. They start pre
[1:25:37] professing and saying, "You know what? I
[1:25:39] don't know how I'm going to get out of
[1:25:41] this, but God's going to get me out of
[1:25:43] it.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; God's going to get me out.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; The blood's going to get me out.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; High priest going, "Oh, I can act on
[1:25:51] that." That's right.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; That's a confession I want to hear. It's
[1:25:54] kind of like when the when uh uh uh
[1:25:58] Joshua and Caleb come back and said,
[1:26:01] "We're more than able to take the land."
[1:26:03] While the other guys are saying,
[1:26:04] "There's giants and we can't do it and
[1:26:07] God's failed us." Everything else,
[1:26:09] they're saying we're well able to take
[1:26:12] the land. And our high priest, he's
[1:26:14] saying, "That's the confession I want to
[1:26:16] hear
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; because don't worry about the demons.
[1:26:19] Don't worry about the the high cities.
[1:26:21] Don't worry about the giants. Amen.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Don't see yourself as a grasshopper.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; They seen themselves as grasshoppers.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; We're grasshoppers in their sight and
[1:26:30] we're grasshoppers in our own sight.
[1:26:32] Well, that's a problem.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; But Joshua and Caleb said, "No, no, no.
[1:26:35] We ain't we ain't grasshoppers."
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; There's more with us than with them.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Greater is he that is in me than he that
[1:26:42] is in the world.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; And they started say, remember they said
[1:26:46] they still the audience
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; because they're all complaining, we
[1:26:50] can't do it. We're going to go back to
[1:26:51] Egypt. were finished and they said they
[1:26:53] still and I just don't think they just
[1:26:55] said guys can I say something
[1:26:59] I think they said shut up I don't want
[1:27:01] to hear this anymore
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; sorry for saying shut up parents
[1:27:07] BE QUIET LET ME SAY SOMETHING I'VE BEEN
[1:27:09] OVER THERE I'VE GOT THE FRUIT WE ARE
[1:27:11] WELL ABLE TO TAKE THE LAND GOD'S GIVEN
[1:27:13] IT TO US LET'S GO do it
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; and God just saying that's what I need
[1:27:18] to hear right
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; that's the confession I can do something
[1:27:21] with
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; you can go on Monday morning and you're
[1:27:25] having a dull drum of a day and you
[1:27:28] don't know how it's going to go and
[1:27:29] maybe something went wrong in the
[1:27:31] morning kind of like mine day today. But
[1:27:34] when you can keep the confession, God's
[1:27:37] going [music] to work this out.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; God's going to help me.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; He's the high priest of our profession
[1:27:44] and he acts. He steps in as a caring
[1:27:46] [music] God. steps in and the blood of
[1:27:51] Jesus Christ comes and [music] washes
[1:27:53] everything away.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The blood. Let's stand. That
[1:27:58] Jesus [music and singing]
[1:28:01] shed
[1:28:03] for me.
[1:28:05] [music]
[1:28:09] Way back on Calary.
[1:28:16] Oh, the blood [music] that gives me
[1:28:20] strength [singing]
[1:28:22] from day
[1:28:25] to day.
[1:28:27] Oh, it [music and singing] will never
[1:28:31] lose
[1:28:33] its highest.
[1:28:36] [music]
[1:28:39] It reaches
[1:28:41] to the highest
[1:28:44] mountain. [music]
[1:28:47] How far does it go? It flows [music]
[1:28:52] to the [singing] lowest
[1:28:55] valley. [music]
[1:28:56] Hallelujah.
[1:28:59] Oh, the blood [music]
[1:29:01] that goes straight
[1:29:04] from me
