TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we'll read together and uh we just appreciate all of our visitors being with us this morning god bless you all some ones we haven't seen in a while and some others we don't know but we love you and appreciate you joining the fellowship with us this morning and though life may separate us sometimes we know that god is the same and we hold within us the word of the hour and the message and christ and when we come together we have that in common can you say amen second samuel samuel chapter 13. amen and it came to pass after this that absalom the son of david had a fair sister beautiful sister her name was tamar and amnon the son of david loved her and amnon was so vexed that he fell sick for his sister tamar for she was a virgin and amnon thought it hard for him to do anything to her but amnon had a friend whose name was jonadab the son of shemiya david's brother and jonah dabb was a very subtle man and he said unto him why art thou being the king's son lean from day to day will they not tell me and amnon said unto him i love tamar my brother absalom's sister and jonah dabb said unto him lay thee down on thy bed and make thyself sick and when thy father cometh to see thee say unto him i pray thee let my sister tamar come and give me meat and dress the meat in my sight that i may see it and eat it at her hand i'd like to add in a scripture here then in the new testament in the book of james chapter four and add this into our subject today and if we have it in our minds it would be good james over in the new testament james chapter 4. amen you love the lord this morning praise the lord i can tell that by the worship and expressing your heart to god that you're glad to be here james chapter 4 here from whence come wars and fightings among you come they not hints even of your lust that war in your members ye lust and have not ye kill and desire to have and cannot obtain you fight and war and yet ye have not because ye ask not ye ask and receive not because ye ask amiss that ye may consume it upon your lust ye adulterers and adulteresses know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with god i want to talk a little bit about this this morning is that when we have a friendship with the world and by the way the world is a friendship in itself it's not just having friends of the world but actually the world expresses here the world can be a friendship to you other things can be a friendship that aren't necessarily a human being he said know ye not that the friendship of the world is an enemy the problem with the friendship of the world is it it makes you an enemy to towards god and it makes you at variance with god whoever whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of god james always says some things very very straight do you think that the scripture saith in vain the spirit that dwelleth in us lust us to envy but he giveth more grace wherefore aren't you glad he giveth more grace he giveth more grace but he give him more grace wherefore he saith god resists that the proud but giveth grace unto the humble submit yourself therefore to god resist the devil and he will flee from you now just stop right there the theme being the friendship of the world and that friendship has a way of drawing you in but the the answer to it and by the way a friendship with the world will fail you every time that friendship will fail you every time how many has ever had a friendship fail you and so you know how you feel about that but this friendship will definitely fail so now we have failed friendship what's god's answer to a friendship that has failed something that has failed you even if it's the world or someone or whatever it is what's god's answer verse seven submit yourselves therefore to god resist the devil and he will flee from you and i like this one number eight it's verse eight draw nigh to god and he will draw nigh to you when we have broken friendships when we have broken things in life when things fail us it should lead us to draw nigh to god more than anything else it should draw us niar to the lord and when we draw nigh to him he draws nigh to us lord bless your word today anoint it we pray as we put our full confidence in you for every soul that's here and listening online we trust that you'll do it in jesus name amen god bless you may be seated you know i've been speaking about amnin a little bit and not so much the incident which is a very tragic incident that took place but the lessons that we learned from it and um to see the type of mind and the type of thought life and the type of uh today we want to speak on the influence of amnon because the friend he had i want to actually title this but amnon had a friend but amnon had a friend and i want to speak about him as we learn a lesson another lesson from him i wouldn't want to place any of you in the uh position of amnon or somehow make you feel that way but we have to be uh chris as christians we have to be mindful of the lessons within the scripture that we learn from a person like this especially when he grows up in the royal kingdom of david and when he grows up under that influence and that atmosphere then we realize that it's not a guarantee if you grow up in the right atmosphere that you wouldn't go off feeding on other things and your mind becomes tainted and that you have the potential to go into coming such an extreme thing as this someone within the royal family going this far as far as what amnon went it's all about the mind it's all about where satan can take you and it's not an unbeliever here it's some person that's grown up amongst the jehovah teachings and amongst the royal family and someone so great as david so we have to take the lesson from it to see how does his how did his mind get here how did all this take place how do we get to this happening within the kingdom of god it's all good lessons for us so that we can have the upper edge on the enemy in this hour so he cannot take our minds he cannot take our thoughts he cannot allow us to go too far and thus feeding on the wrong things until we rise to the occasion and say now wait a minute i am not ignorant of satan's devices i am not a statistic i am not like the rest of the world this mind is not like the rest of the world's mind i'm wanting to submit it and be renewed by the spirit of god can you say ma'am so i might say in laying a foundation for this this morning that the influence of other people as i'm titling this but amnon had a friend amna had a friend it was not a good friend but amnon had a friend he grew up in the things of god but he had a friend and the bible says he was a subtle friend he was not a good friendship he wasn't something good for amnin at all but he had this friend and everything could have went better except he had this friend and uh so now i want to break it down a little bit to say that the influence of other people on a human being is absolutely incredible the influence of a a another human being upon one human being to another it's incredible how influential another human being can be good or bad the influence of another human being on human beings is an amazing thing and today we don't really even need to know the person personally but they can strongly influence our life because of social media and because of being attached worldwide in the world wide web there can be a person that heavily influences us not only what we wear our mindset our political views our view of god we can be heavily influenced by another person and not even know them now that's quite a place that we've come to because usually in the old days you would have to be around a person you'd have to stay around requirement and then you realize they're starting to influence your mindset they're starting to influence the way you think about god it would take quite a bit more time but today it doesn't take a lot of time and actually you wouldn't actually call that person a friend but they become somewhat of a friend because they are influencing your life can you say amen and i'll just make this simple for the young people here today the young teenagers whoever you are one of the greatest things that you need to learn as a young person is that you're gonna have to make good choices for friends can you say man only you can make those choices but you're gonna have to early on learn there are good friends there are bad friends and you don't base upon their personality you don't base it upon that what they wear that they're rich you don't basically you you if you're trying to serve god then that person ought to respect you serving god and it would be best to choose friends that are serving god as well and why would i say that because friends and human other human beings can have such a strong influence on us not just as teenagers but as adults as well we don't realize how much we're influenced by other people good or bad can you say amen i have a lot of mentors in my life a lot of good influences in my life a lot of people that have been great influences and i'll not deny it i follow the christ that's in them the prophet of this hour is one of them i follow i don't follow a man i follow the christ that's in a man paul said follow me as i follow christ so there's not necessarily anything wrong with following a person but we must be choosy who we follow we are influenced by other human beings what they say what they do what they wear it's just we're built that way maybe that's why god said i'll come down and become flesh among men and i'll put myself in the people because god's mystery is to become flesh in human beings hallelujah so it can't be a bad thing to recognize the christ in one another not the humanness not the weakness but to recognize the christ in one another and i'm going to follow that christ you know every individual if you think this you can but none of us know everything about the lord none of us know it all i know there's some people that do feel like they know it all but none of us know it all as brother lonnie used to tell me no one preacher in this message has a full complete handle and revelation on this whole message also although some of them think they do but i don't they don't they don't have and that's why god set up not a one-fold ministry but a fifo ministry and then a many member body because christ is in every member of that body a portion of christ is in them and you can learn and grow by seeing that christ in another individual so you know but we can be influenced today by by other people and we don't even know that popular people stars uh beautiful people people that wear the right things and say the right things in our eyes and so we're influenced by them and men and women will mimic those people they'll repeat those people they'll take on the belief system of those people and never look at their character never look at the kind of person they are but that's how easily influenced we are is that we like what they say we like what they wear we want to dress that we want us to we want to be able to look like them and be beautiful like them and this is one of the downfalls of the of social media and these things is when someone has got a complex and are not found their position in the lord and their confidence the way god made them especially young girls they will keep looking to that and compare themselves constantly to something that's online compare themselves to that she's more beautiful than i am and so now next i want to be like that i want to dress like her i want to i want to wear makeup like because in my eyes that person's beautiful and i'm not in god's eyes god looks at beauty a different way god looks beauty on the inside god likes to see himself within you can you say man and that person from maryland monroe all the way down to uh jennifer aniston and all the new stars that we look at as being beautiful women that person may be empty on the inside as far as character and yet people thousands millions of people will follow them and and follow what they wear and just because why we're influenced by other human beings they don't even know who she is they haven't checked out her character amen so they take on their belief system because they're beautiful and so that's what happens first i want to address i want to act like them but then you take on their beliefs because now you trust them as being someone i can follow so now you take on what they believe oh they said this and they said this about god and they said that there's no such thing as god that god is whoever you make up you say so now now you're taking on their belief system because because influence and we judge we never even met them but we judge by the outward appearance or personality and we quickly accept people and copy them with no discernment brother william branham and if you're listening here on the broadcast they had a powerful ministry and it's gone just a few years before us he's passed on now but had a powerful ministry and we acknowledge that ministry here and you may hear me quoting from him a little bit but he had a wonderful message that he preached you might want to look it up and it's called the influence of another and i encourage our congregation to listen to that this week as well and incidentally he didn't just preach at one time he preached it six more times a matter of fact as near as i can see he preached influence message more than any other sermon that he preached the influence of another the most preached sermon that he had and i'm going to read from it a little bit later but it was to show us the power of influence of other people and and as opposed the to the influence of god because isaiah had formed a close friendship with the king uzziah they were buddies and uzziah was a great good influence a great good influence on isaiah the prophet this was but then but then afterwards and we'll speak of it a little bit later in the sermon but then afterwards that friendship failed in other words josiah got off track he got lifted up in pride and so this close bond between isaiah and uzziah failed because uzziah went away from god and he did the wrong thing so now that's a very difficult thing when you have someone you look up to some friendship that you look up to and you were so influenced by them but then it's all everything is taken out from underneath you the friendship's gone now you're having to make a choice who do i follow do i follow uzziah and his pride or do i and and the example the reason that the prophet preached out of that is to show us to show us that at that moment when friendships fail and you're having to make a choice you to follow isaiah said you know what i'm going to do i'm not going to escape and do another friendship i'm going to go to the temple and i'm going to pray and i'm going to look to god and when he went to the temple first when he got into the presence of the lord with this failed friendship god gave him a vision can you say amen and now he said i seen the lord now i see the lord he's high and lifted up and i will never put a friendship above how high the lord has lifted up in my life and when i have the lord i have everything [Applause] and if god blesses me with other friendships because brother brahm said he said friendships are a gift of god i only want the friendships that are a gift of god i don't want the friendships that i can myself but the friendships the true friendships are a gift of god so isaiah is saying lord it's kind of like abraham you know what said abraham in the book of james it said that he believed and it was not imputed it was imputed under righteousness this is real simple now abraham believed righteousness was attached and brought into his account he was righteous before god before he believed and the bible says and he was a friend of god see abraham making mistakes abraham did this abraham did that abraham did no all that gets washed away because why he believed he was counted righteous and he was a he he had a testimony he was a friend of god how many this morning would raise your hand and say when this is all over with the one thing i want is to be a friend of god you see we've complicated this message too much amen i'm going to say it again we've complicated and that's why paul when he comes this whole subject of subtility the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field so he came to eve right subtle and then paul picks it up there in the new testament he says i fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled the subtle serpent beguiled eve that he would take your minds away from the simplicity in christ and the simplicity of christ is the message of the hour see would you sure don't seem like it's because men's have messed it up men have tainted it men that have taken out of the bible can you say man men have made it some denomination i'm not attached to any of that although i get lumped in listen i know what this message is it's the message of christ for the last days to bring us back to bible truth and bible faith that we can live bible lives and have a friendship and oneness with god like no other people has ever had if this message has not brought you into a friendship and closeness with the lord personally yourself then you haven't got it yet simplicity our father abraham he believed righteousness was credited to his account because he believed how many want that and then he was a friend of god the message isn't any more complicated than that praise the lord that was that wasn't in my notes that was free i'd like to preach on that a while but the prophet showed in this message the power of influence of people and the influence as isaiah was influenced but it drove when the friendship failed and uzziah failed and this kid that was so praised and even brother branham praises him over and over again for his godliness as a king and taken the kingdom back to the things of god and just a young man but he was he had some holiness and some principle about him and he was praised and that's why izaiah was so attracted to him i've got a friendship with a fellow here and they fellowshipped around the word and and had a great influence on him but when someone like that fails you when that when a friendship like that fails and all of a sudden they deny everything that they and they just walk away from it and they get lifted up in pride and they step out of their position it has an effect on us and it should it and it should do what it did to isaiah to drive him to this real lesson that he went to the temple that we should never be more dependent on a human being than we are on god can i get an amen we should never be more dependent on another human being's influence than we are on god god's presence should be our strongest influence more than people if we can take on the the image and the words of another human being and not even know them not even know that person and just talk about the world a little bit here again the world we live in if we can take on the image and the words and dress like the person and take on their belief system and all of a sudden now they they get a credibility we're online and they start uh they start bashing the the message of god and start saying all this stuff and think they got it all figured out and they start doing it and all of a sudden when they do it also they have such a strong influence that your influence and those seeds have been planted in you and we take on that image and take on the words of another human being sometimes we don't even know them we don't know their lives they live we don't know their resentment we don't know where they come from we don't know the reasons why they've turned against christ the word if we live in that world then maybe we're losing our definition of what a real friend is and i believe we are i believe we literally live in a world we're losing a definition of what a real friend is and how to choose the right one i think the definition of friend has been watered down we make choices now to follow somebody that we don't even know to friend somebody that we need to know following and friending somebody is just a click of a button now you're going to tell me friendships have been watered down friendships have been watered down think about it now you by a click of a button you don't have to know them you don't have to know their lifestyle every day by a click of a button i'm going to friend that i'm going to follow that person really it's that easy for you to follow somebody i'm going to friend somebody i'm going to follow them and then the other thing is i'm going to unfriend somebody now so it's just like you know if friendships can within hours can change i've been unfriended and i'm not even on there you say well this came out when social media and facebook came out no for years preaching the true message and the balance of the message i have been unfriended some sundays and we didn't have social media i was just unfriended after that sermon i know what it feels like that's how quickly they're unafraid they're being oh their body is with you and everything's okay we support you we're yeah praise the lord we're and all of a sudden everybody go they go silent you know because because they've been taught that if i want to i'm friends with that person i friended them now i can unfriend them and we're being taught loose shallow friendships it doesn't have to be face to face anymore you don't have to ever see them and you're they're your friends praise the lord block someone to ditch someone and it's all based on whatever we feel at the time i think friendships should go deeper than that i think true friendships that are intimate friendship should go deeper than just our feelings what gets lost is the true meaning of what a friend's a friend is and how to choose the correct type of friend the the top people to follow on tick tock are called incidentally prophet was way ahead of his time it's a tick tock influencer that's the top people it's the most looked at it's the most popular it's a tick tock influencer the prophet was right in line wasn't he because they've named it what it is they they make millions of dollars because they then the tick tock tick-tock top influencer they call it what it is they have the strongest influence and most of the people on tick-tock don't know that person's lifestyle they well they do know their lifestyle but they don't know them as a person they don't know what they stand for and yet they're the top influencer in millions of lives how does that happen how does that work what kind of world does satan brought up to us here relationships become really shallow these days one uh study said social media social networks and you say brother paul seems like you're mentioning social media and networks every sunday now i'll get off of it eventually and i think they have their place just like a lot of other things have their place but if if science and articles are coming out of the huge damage that's being done then i'm not allowed to talk about it because it ain't their articles that i know the devil can be behind that just like tv and movies to drain a christian of his spiritual strength and so the same quotes that brother brahm talked about television is the same ones we should take in any media fourth dimension thing can be used of the devil to weaken you spiritually and channel channel channel spirits into your life channel why are they called channels on the tv because they channel spirits you'd never go to some kind of witch doctor and channel some that we don't believe in that kind of thing with channeling but people do it every day with their tv it's channeling spirits into their home which channel see it's all updated it's all highly tech now 50 years ago i could talk about going to a witch and channeling somebody and we said oh god a christian would never do that but it's all updated now and channeling spirits now has become easy to do on your phone there ought to be more amen than this because you know i'm telling the truth but one of the articles said social networks like facebook twitter and instagram make regular users more shallow and less moral according to a new study by psychologists it makes it makes users more shallow and less moral because social media sites often lead to fast and short responses it is killing the art of reflective thought it is killing it is numbing the brain it is quick it's a quick answer that's why don't text me something serious to my phone if it's a serious nature i'm not going to text you back i do it face to face because satan can so misinterpret text back and forth to each other in social media can you say amen devil doesn't like a face-to-face relationship devil doesn't like to and so now he can use these things and that's it kills reflective thought and we're not supposed to be numb brains that don't have reflective thought we're supposed to stand and try james said first john says try every spirit test every spirit can i get an amen i'm i'm quoting the bible we're not numb skulls we're not gullible people we don't let everything in that we don't reflect on what's coming in but we use discernment every thought every imagination has to be going through a test to check it whether it's of god or not social media kills reflective thought and it kills deep relationships and makes you a surface relationship person and then betrayal is everywhere friendship's betrayed we have more friends than we've ever had but more shallow less deep relationships we have thousands of friends my wife has three thousand see you got three thousand friends how does that work three thousand and i my next question i just i just asked i don't say it to cause uh you know we won't have arguments we have uh intense moments of fellowship it's a joke it's okay to laugh some of you just can't happen anyway i sent you i said no out of those three thousand how many of those people do you know they're your friends how many do you know and she told me the other night i know all of them so praise the lord i can't preach on you then that's pretty good and she said anybody i don't know i block them out they they can't be friend well that's the way to do it i believe that's the way to do it but we have a lot of friends more friends that's what the article says there's more we have more friends than we've ever had and yet and yet more shallow less deep relationships more friends than we ever have and more loneliness and suicide because maybe something's wrong with these type of friendships loneliness is gripping even believers sometimes just outright loneliness i don't have a friend in the world you don't well you got that many on your facebook is so something's wrong with the friendship something's wrong with friendship trust is broken satan exploits our pure desire and thirst for friends how many knows does pure desire to have a friendship god gave you a desire to have good friends it's a pure wholesome desire god gave you but satan exploits it and he points us to the wrong type of friends i want to say that because of betrayal because of loneliness people feel their desire for friendship in social media in video games in movies and other things they're not close to anyone so they escape into books into movies into phones because they don't have any close relationships they continue with their loneliness and continue and when they do that they really don't need people anymore they don't need to be in the word anymore there's hours spent playing video games and guess what that becomes your friend my friends friends you know i got to be your friend because i am crazy to get up and say this stuff you don't have that many friends but this device or this thing becomes your friend almost a marriage and i speak from experience of family members who's so caught up in video games their marriage is destroyed but because their marriage has become that video game animals are more important than people today and i wouldn't knock animals i wouldn't do that for nothing the prophet had close animals to him he said they're going to be on the other side i'm not against them at all if i find the right one someday i might have an animal friend one that doesn't pee on the floor in my house but i'm not against animals you know being close to them and i'm not against that people think i am dogs are questionable but other animals are okay no but but listen now something's wrong when the animals i had a lady tell me 15 years ago she said i don't like people she was in my church i don't like people i don't want to be around people i just like to be home with my i don't know what animals she had but i just i like being around them more than i like being around the church people i was 15 years ago so i just left that one alone but to me i always reflect and say something's wrong when our relationships have become so damaged and we don't trust anybody anymore that we pour everything that we're supposed to be pouring into family and the family of god into an animal is that okay and then one preacher said in his testimony that he was a latch key kid and he was lonely as ever his father died and his father died and his mom had to work and so as a young teenager he's a latchkey kid come home from school his mom was never home through the evenings he come in himself and so he was the loneliest child ever and you know how many knows that home means more than just the house home is your relationship you could have a house and have the nicest house and not have home you see so he said about it this was his testimony he said after years of being addicted to video games and pornography he said i realized that i didn't have a real home and so pornography and video games became my home because we all have to have a home god's built us to have a place to have a home to have acceptance to have love can you say man to to be praised and so now you've got nobody around to praise you well if you win enough levels in the video game you're going to be praised it'll splash under yeah you're awesome and that woman in the pornography that woman is is is trained to look at you in a way and she's looking at you in porn and this is why a lot of men turn towards it because men have that within them that god put within that that they want a woman to be able to give them affirmation and to build them up brother bram said nobody can affect a man like a woman can when he comes in tired from working from the day her words her sweetness her support and all that it affects a man like no other thing can affect him well if he don't get enough of that all of a sudden now in lust in lust it isn't right but he turns because that woman is looking at him saying i want you you want me i want you her eyes say i want you she she and i don't go into details but listen they say psychologically that's what's happening too there's a craving a woman wants me that's that's an absolute lie she doesn't want him she doesn't even know him he doesn't even know her that's the trap of the enemy can you say amen it's a it's a it's a devilish spirit that comes on you to take a a substitute like that to a god-given fountain to drink from of your own wife come on i should get greater amens than that brothers shame on us may god fill us with his spirit and not turn to those things but sometimes it's that that eye that says i i i want you and he's not getting enough of that is anybody listening this morning and so he's looking for home he's looking for something that's home he don't have a home he only gets criticized at home he only gets put down at home so now he's craving for home and that's an absolutely terrible place to turn to but the craving is for home for for normality for for to be to be uh acknowledged to be appreciated is anybody listening here and so he finds home and this brother said i didn't realize so many years and he was delivered of it that the video games and the porn became home to him because he didn't have a home what a terrible replacement for the real thing of what a home should be as i've been preaching if you pour yourself into that stuff it's so subtle i wonder if it becomes a subtle friend like amnon's subtle friend and that's why i read the scripture but amnon had a friend so we'll pick him up we're wondering what is what is the answer of why a boy in the royal family would carry out such an act and we've been speaking about that that the sexual standards were actually lowered within the kingdom starting with david last sunday if you want to listen to it it started with david david fully repented i thank god for his repentance and not only his repentance but he he changed and he changed in a lot of ways i could preach on to show that but i did if you want to listen to it last sunday because amnon was three chapters later amnon was a severe case but it started with this whole thing of sexual standards lowering by the father and by the king and it began to permeate throughout the kingdom and that's one of the reasons amnan turned to these things and then i spoke about amnon's mind given over to event to get around the standards and that's why we find this incident that he's sitting there vexed with a lustful spirit not love but a lustful spirit towards this beautiful of the half-sister of tamar in the other kingdom and a lustful spirit takes hold and his mind is full of things and but the last thing he's thinking is that how can i get around the standards i can't get to her because there's a few standards in place and she has principles and we have principles here and i can't get my way around the standards that's been taught to have her like i want to have her but here is another answer as to how it actually took place and the standards were overridden it's very revealing and it's just simply this he had a friend in his life but he was the wrong friend how did standards get compromised the wrong friendships the wrong influences amnon could could never get around the barriers to have this girl but he had another influence in his life he might have made it through this incident but the whole incident would have not happened but he could have got the got on the right track but and that's why i want you to remember this is the title but amnon had a friend because all this would have been different but but there was another influence in amnon's life that he allowed in his life that was the wrong influence and everything could have stayed in place but amnon had a friend sounds like people who have it all they have all the right upbringing sometimes but they were raised in the message raised in the faith but what happened a friend and i'm i'm asking them to put this in the title sister genie but amnon had and i want parentheses friend because this was not a friend a person has all the upright uh right upbringing but a friend he could have went on with the lord that young brother but he could have he could have made some changes and got things straightened out but she was doing so good and she was coming along and she was going on with the lord but there was another influence that she wouldn't cut off everything could have been changed but let's apply it to our lives we're headed in the right direction but it's like brother gideon preached the other the other night a couple wednesday nights ago is that is that god wants to lead us to remove the hindrances can you say amen to remove the hindrances so we can get to the next victory we can't get to the next victory unless we say lord remove the hindrances in my life and many people could have moved on even older people that's been in the message for years they're stunned they stopped right there in their growth they would have went on but but there's something there in their lives there's an influence and most of us don't even know what it is but they can't move on because there's another influence praise be to god they would have got the victory but she would have got the victory but she likes her old friends he likes his old friends his old friends from college my buddies i got to go be around him miss church go be around her that's my buddies that's my pals could have went on with the lord but the wrong friends amen and so amnon and uh this boy had become bud somehow he was in the royal family this boy wasn't in the royal family but he was he was distant cousins they say but he wasn't necessarily in the royal family so he had a friend that wasn't in the royal family but they become friends he they become friends together but the bible says he was subtle and no one picked up on this kid no one picked up on his subtility not even amnon and you know the story as i read it he gave him the idea of how to seduce tamar and bring her in it was the friend that gave him the idea because he couldn't come up with it himself a lot of stuff we would be shielded from but we got some voice we're listening to that's given us ideas how to get around god's boundaries somebody's quoting some denominational form of scripture get us around the dress standard some subtility as the serpent beguiled eve and the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field he wasn't quoting let's go to the world let's party let's put our pants on let's put our short skirts on let's just go do it the serpent was not saying that he was quoting the word that's what made him subtle and people every day are online misquoting the scripture misquoting things for the agenda to destroy the value of what our restorative prophet brought us back to in every way can you say amen and you'll call him a friend that's not your friend can you say a man it's out to destroy your life and your confidence in god hallelujah excuse me so it was presented to amnon and i'm not going to speak much longer on him and i want to change this to a to kind of a um a more positive theme but it was presented in how to get around the boundaries and just know it when it's that spirit that is getting you around your standards it's wrong to start with anything contrary to the word is your enemy you want to be a christian you want to be baptized repent be baptized be filled with the spirit listen now anything against the word because now you're identified with the word in any little voice that aligns itself against the word that's your enemy and he may be speaking it through a friend but anything against this word is your enemy one writer said now he didn't go along with all this but he said if you want to learn how to choose the right friends you have to choose the right enemies but i'll just say it this way because we're to love our enemies right we're not to compromise with them but we're going to we're going to love with the love of christ everybody but if you want to choose the right friends you've got to know who your enemy is first you'll never choose the right friends unless you know who your enemy is and that's the devil and how he can use to pull you down and to pull you into plant seeds of doubt in your mind you got to know your enemy is subtle can you say amen we must realize in order to have friends you must know how subtle your enemy is and james 4 as we read it at the beginning the world can be a friend too we don't realize that but from whence comes wars ye lust you kill you desire to have and the adulteresses and altars know ye not that the friendship of the world i'm in james 4 and verse 4 know you not that the friendship of the world is enmity with god whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is an enemy of god i tell you i don't want to be an enemy of god i don't want to be positioning myself that i would become an enemy to god that i'm working against god i want everything to work that he can work in my life but when i align myself with the friendship of the world which the world is a friendship too you put yourself as an enemy to god nothing's going to come together to work and you say man so the world is an enemy and it is it is to put you at enmity with god and then you watch the other relationships unravel and things that used to be close family members and all that it just makes such a tense thing because now you become a friend and by the way when friends as i said it's all you know friends are really it's really weird today what young people say we're just friends and they're doing things and i'm going i never did that as a friend to a girl you know friendship is changing its meaning all the time but but you know the thing is is that you cannot be a total friend with somebody but you can be flirting with them you haven't been with them but you're flirting with them and i just want to bring it to the world now you may not be out in the world but you can flirt with the world and a lot of times for years people can be flirting with the things of the world just flirting with it just like when in a in a a man who's flirting with a woman at the office and she's flirting with him nothing's really happened yet they're just flirting but you're on your background so some evangelist needs to preach a sermon about flirting with the world you're not in the world yet you haven't given yourself fully the world you're still coming to church but privately you're you're flirting with it that's why they post those pictures you know my wife sent me something that said all these girls you know they're in a ball game they're all doing selfie selfies and the thing says if you i should have put it up here today if you would take a selfie of your soul would people be attracted to it praise the lord so you must purpose young people everyone you must purposely you can never have a close intimate relationship with someone who rejects your christ if they reject him they really reject you i know that's straight but think about it friends are ones that lead you closer to god not further away but i want to take this a bit deeper because i could talk and the lesson today is not just that we should choose the right friends that's very important all of us need to learn that and most older ones have learned it because they've chosen bad friendships when they were teenagers on you learn and our i praise god for our teenagers let's not beat them up let's not be too critical of them they go through stages they have to learn things can you say amen they're going to stumble and fall sometimes can i get an agreement we we hold the standard in front of them we hold the things and people call us strict here we hold it in front of them but there's no lack of love for our young people then going through their different things they have to learn some things to avoid pitfalls we love them for to avoid some things but some things they're going to fall into they're going to learn i've formed this friendship online and now my life is a mess they have to learn that sometimes but the older ones we've learned listen choose your friends choose the ones can you say amen you be an outreach and christ to an unbeliever but but you you don't you choose your friends out of unbelievers you learn it after a while can you say amen but this is not a lesson about choosing the right friends although that's important the story of isaiah says that he had a buddy who was he was so close to and he was a good friend and it was a godly young fellow so it's a bit of different story that the prophet's bringing here in influence that this was such an influence on isaiah and it wasn't a bad influence to start with it was a godly connection it was a they fellowship around the word they had the word in common and then what happened to his friend through isaiah for a loop as it was and then is when the prophet goes into uh i'm talking about the prophet of the style goes into this message of influence and the power of being around the right ones because he talks he elaborates on this subject of influence and he goes into homes and families and he goes into this first quote talks about family and parents and the influence the opportunity to get your kids around the right influences and to create the right influence in your home they may not ever get that opportunity so you parents got to get them around the right influences and you've got to have your home the right influences because they may nev they'll make their choice someday but they may never get that opportunity again like they get it when they're young but influence is so powerful he says here in influence of another you know what i think everybody has their own opinion but one of the greatest and to my opinion the greatest president that we ever had in this nation was abraham lincoln not because he was a republican but because he was a godly man and he was raised to serve god and said if there's anything that i want to give praise to he said or my life was influenced by was a godly mother who taught me to pray and to know jesus as my savior oh your family is what you are you raise your child in a certain environment it's got 98 percent better chance to go right than it has if you bring it up the wrong way bring up a child in the way it should go and when it's old will not depart from it be brought up right teach your children to do right to be honest to be square and fair even when they're in school teach them train them can you say amen bring them up the way you should do it why because you have a powerful influence on their minds and hearts right now now society is teaching no no no no no we're not allowed as parents to influence them anyway they need to make their own choice at five years old if they decide they're not a boy even though everything says they're a boy they have a choice about what a wicked world i want my kids to just talk to have an open mind i don't want to force this message down their throat you know why you say that you know why you say that because you probably had it forced down your throat or you don't have the value that this message and this truth is not originating in an agenda of a man to bind us up but it is the truth for all generations of how to overcome in this world and somebody taught you that you don't no we don't we don't throw it down their throats we don't force it on them but we teach it because it's god's word we remind them of it we say this is god's word for the hour this has value to it will they make their own choice someday yes they will they have to make their own choice but as long as they're under my influence i'm going to be pointing them to calvary i'm going to be pointing them to the word i'm going to be pointing them to these quotes i'm going to be pointing them this word can you say about because it's not daddy's word it's not brother branham's word it is the word that comes from god they're going to need it someday [Applause] it's influence it's influence isaiah learned some things by watching a friend fall and one of the things he learned is stay in your place because uzziah got lifted up in pride he stepped out of his place tried to be a priest he was a king got lifted over pride he tried to take the office of a priest we know the story and the king got to a place and brother brown says the king got to a place that he thought within himself that he got lifted up pride god in his heart and what that's what happens to us if you pardon this expression that's what happened to our churches throughout the country they're fine people in there some of the best in the world goes to church i think the best in the world goes to church but the thing of it is the organization system gets lifted up that's what happened to the methodists that's what happened to the baptist that's what happened in the nazarene to the pilgrim holiness to the pentecostal lifted up self-will now you can now if you're spiritual you can catch what this this sermon this sermon of influence is not a doctrinal sermon as such but it is speaking the vision of what's happening in the bride right now back then and right now and that is if organizational denominational systems get lifted up in pride the type is uziah getting out of his place and getting lifted up in pride and the people looking to that i'm going to let that denomination interpret the word to me i'm going to let it influence my life i'm all into that domination no isaiah be careful be careful because it's going to fall methodist baptist that's what happened in the nazarene people holiness pentecost lifted up self-willed self-centered pride that you can't tell nothing to god can't find a way to get into their hearts now remember i'm not talking about individually i have a lot of friends and people there that love god and they i always like to call other things because i don't believe in a message private that thinks we're better i have a lot of good solid holiness people and and and friends from the school and all that i'm not talking about those uh people i'm talking about systems that get lifted up in pride that if you're only looking to that system to influence you that's not a good thing and it wasn't a good thing for isaiah you got to get your eyes off of that system and come into the vision for this hour and come into the temple of the lord and see the lord lift it up god can't find a way in there it's incidentally i'm mentioning baptist and methodist and pure holiness and i might as well just say there are facets of denominational spirits that come amongst our own group i like to talk about the positive but we have that how many would agree with it you have that thing coming in that the system of it just kind of becomes something that people are looking how should i explain it they think they're okay because they make all the message camps and they've grown up in the message and they've grown up in this and everything's okay and i'll be all right no you need a personal relationship with jesus christ the tent vision what's the tent vision that vision said he's seen in a vision it was this big auditorium lots of people lots of things going on almost like a camp meeting okay but when the vision changed the tent vision now it didn't stay that way but a lot of people could stay there in the crowd in the camps not against camps but listen something deeper has to happen in every life the vision says so and what happened was is he watched the holy spirit come into a little room over in the corner and people would come out of there and they were lame and they had issues and they would walk through that room and when when that pillar fire went in that room the lord said to the prophet he's he's moving in other words he's the holy spirit's moving he said i will meet you in there now friends that's a simple vision i want to be wherever he's meeting me now out here in the tent meeting without he can bless me he can heal me he can do mighty things you got to remember friends that god can form miracles outside of message ranks that cannot be the full vindication of who we are is the supernatural god to be among us amen is he to show himself in many facets amen if it's not there's a problem but we can't major on a minor and divine healing is a minor not a major it's not the complete vindication that that things are right because they can have that in other circles that they don't even believe the message they have all that god manifested himself that way it has to be something deeper than just a temporary revival and a blessing god can bless me out here but he says i will meet you in there and for me my prayer has been ever since i looked at the last few weeks i said god that little room is for me may i come into that little room for you with you alone and i don't care if everyone leaves everyone leaves my church i want to be in that little room with you how many want your little room this morning you better find that little room with the lord because you won't get in because you've been to all the cats you won't get in because mommy and daddy you won't be cut in because you were raised in the message it again because you have a personal relationship and a connection with him i want to be in that little room i want to go i want to stay in there every day can you say man i will meet you in there i want to be where he's meeting me hallelujah can you say praise the lord it's the tent vision it's going on right now it's not coming someday it's going on right now hallelujah so where am i reading he said that's what happened to that let's move on now it's because they become so known all that nobody can tell anything and by building themselves around reasoning with brethren they build themselves around their creed and when they do they leave god in the back that's what denomination does that's what happens to doctors when they go so self-centered that they don't need any help from god that's when i don't want one fooling with me right yes when you leave god out of anything i want you to leave me out of it too see because you must always remember god first uzziah got lifted up in pride he's going to do his own thing without god next one so many people today you take a family of people that will start going to church and god will heal the little family he will bless them and give them the holy spirit in their life the little children will pray around the table they'll pray before they go to bed mother and father will join hands and pray and as long as they continue in that they'll stay a family but you let them first thing you know they didn't have nothing old junk car maybe riding around here maybe walking and finally they'll get a good car a better home and the first thing you know then they want to get what they the world calls a better class to associate with they move into a different neighborhood and in there they find out they become influenced by the wrong influence you must always stay where the kingdom of god is and where the glory of god is pouring out lord jesus may this be a place i i'm i'm the husband i'm the overseer of this place you've given us and lord jesus i pray that this would always be untainted that this is a place your people can come and feel and know that the glory of the lord is present among us granite father may we never become tainted may we never have an agenda or political or anything may we keep it clean and wholesome so they know if they can't find another place in this world they can come here and feel the glory of god coming down stay where you can be fear spiritually fed well it's good instruction stay where the kingdom of god is don't let possessions draw you away from it an influence i want to be a part of certain crowd i want to look like that now i'm closer to my friends outside of the body of christ than i am inside be careful of that hello be careful of that you're closer to ones that don't believe like you than ones that believe like you be careful of that i'm allowed to do that well sure you are it's a free country but your prophet is telling you stay where the kingdom of god is you say well where is that well pray about it it may not be here for you it may not be here but one thing for sure stay where the kingdom of god is stay where the glory of god is pouring out stay where you can be spiritually fed we encourage our young people to go to these camps that are that are preaching the word of god can you say man and seeing the supernatural it's important because they need to know that the glory of god is real can you say amen they need it's not all the facet of god but they need to know god is real we encourage it stay where you can be spiritually fed day and night then the first thing you know separations come in the home and then worldliness and then they get lifted up that's what happens another lesson is i learned and i'm bringing this down in here a second he learned usaid that he learned from uzziah because when yes i was corrected he got angry at the correction amen isaiah learned that uzziah somehow lost his respect for being corrected and you're corrected just submit and respect it the brother bram comments he says but when he use i was corrected he got angry about it you correct people about something or tell them about their wrongdoing they'll leave the church they won't go to somebody tell women that they shouldn't wear short hair well i'll just go somewhere where they can wear short hair yes you can do that it's a free country you can go do that but be careful you're not doing it out of anger and rebellion to the word of god because you may leave here and go right to another place and meet up with it again because if you're a child of god you can run but you can't run too far you believe that you believe he loves you that much i tell believers here's the point go ahead and run but if you're god's you can only run so far he's gonna find you he's gonna find you you're gonna bring me that's why some of these people has left they're coming back i believe a lot of them are coming back that's not boasting or being proud i just believe if they're a child of god they're gonna come back they just got hindered they got hurt they got they got took on the spirit of rebellion hey all of us have done that at some stage in our journey can you say amen i believe many of them are coming back i believe that with all my heart but don't get angry when you are corrected i'm going to leave the church i'm going to leave this place and go somewhere where i can wear what i want to wear you can do it but just check your spirit he goes on to say the last quote here you see this king that he made an example before isaiah and isaiah seen that the king as soon as the god of his calling well god smote him with the upper seed then isaiah thought what must i do you see that's the good thing that comes from a friendship failing or someone failing you as you begin to ask the questions lord what must i do it individ it individualizes it lord what must i do now everybody needs to say lord what must what must i do because you may not have all those people you're looking up to they might not be around someday so you ask the honest question but lord now what do i do what must i do isaiah uzziah was dead he died of the leprosy he had leaned heavy on his arm and he thought he was gone what would he do life itself was gone for for isaiah life itself was gone for him nearly so what did the young prophet do he made his way down to the temple to pray he fell down at the altar and he cried out amen sometimes god lets the very props be knocked out from underneath us sometimes he lets sickness strike us he lets disappointments heartaches strike us well that's not god yeah it is that's our god notice he lets it god's not the author of sickness but he lets things because it's supposed to drive us to drawing nigh to him you're in a wrong friendship and he keeps speaking to you and then it falls apart and you see it's messed your life up he's doing that to make you be driven to him can you raise your hand he loves you may i may i take my disappointments in my loneliness and may i run towards the lord may i be like isaiah is that where did he go he didn't escape into a video game he didn't escape into some other thing i don't like oh i've lo now i don't have anybody and he gets all bitter about it and he's going to be on the couch for a month with ice cream the bible doesn't say that so he went to the temple he got on his knees he said god what must i do now and that was the best place to be in because when the world fails me when people fail me when friendships fail me he's calling you to a friendship with him like you've never had before can i get an amen this morning let me finish the quote he says he says he god lets the props being how many would raise your hand so other people can know how many has had in your life the props knocked out from underneath you and how many know that afterwards you know it was god doing it to drive you closer to him how many has had sickness strike your family how many has had disappointments in your life raise your hand so everybody can see how many have heartaches come to your life strike your life sometimes he does this to get you where you'd be influenced by the gospel why because you were influenced by other things by possessions by other things be wise enough to catch it oh my be wise enough to catch that this is god knocking the props out to drive you closer to him and run towards the temple and say god i need to see you i need to see the vision for this hour i've been under the wrong influence i want you to influence me lord i need to see a vision for this hour i'm giving you the answer from the word of god for our disappointments for our depression for our loneliness for all the things the devil bogs us down with run towards the temple of god and say god let me see you i lifted up in my life you become my friend you become the high one in my life that you be lifted up in my life and when i come out of this temple i'll go lord you send me i'll do i'll be a witness for you but if i walk out and i only have two or three friendships in life i may not have very many but god i am tied to you i can run back into your temple i can go in that little room at any time can you say man i pointed this because it was to the left of the tent i'm not i'm not saying going to this room here you don't want to go in there it's a mess back there it's uh absolute mess hasn't even been carpeted yet although i wouldn't mind having it as a prayer room someday but listen i'm not talking about this room here i'm talking about the little room god has given you in this tent vision i can escape not into a magazine not into a romance novel come on now i can escape when i'm feeling lonely and feeling those thoughts and i'm mentally feeling down i've got something else to escape into something besides social media i've got a little room he says he'll meet me in there he promised to meet us in there and they were going in that room and coming out the other they went in lame and they were coming out healed and i believe it's not just physical sickness but it's spiritual sickness it's spiritual mental illness can you say man it's whatever this because that tends to vision is for right now and we've got more mental illness than we've ever had it's not physical healing that we only need can you say man it's emotional healing it's mental healing it's a sound mind can you say man it's to be anchored it's a lot of things we need but i can tell you this tent vision said you go through there and you'll come out whole the other side it's our promise can you say amen this is our promise in the ten vision i'll meet you in there run to the place that he'll meet you in hallelujah and he says sometimes he does that to get you where you'll be influenced by the gospel be wise enough to catch it don't be stupid i didn't know the prophet said stupid but don't be stupid enough to walk away from it don't be stupid enough to walk away from it uh-huh notice isaiah know that he must find something different when we're disappointed and when the wrong friendships abuse us we know we need something different so what did he do he went to the temple he raised up his hands he cried out to god and he fell into a vision and as he fell into the vision he saw god not on the throne down here but lifted up way high and lifted up i want the same vision that sermon and that type of isaiah going into the temple is this when the prophet preached it friends it was an announcement because i don't believe there's sermons i believe there are announcements for the bride this is going on right now and when denominations fail you and when friendships fail you and even disappointments within the body of christ run to the temple run to your little room run in prayer can you say amen and then you come in there it's just you and god and he's seen a vision i saw the lord he was high and lifted up so mighty and his train filled the entire temple and he's seen the angels worshiping holy holy holy holy and they don't even know what redemption is because they never had to be redeemed but there's such a reverence for him that they're holy unto the lord constantly what would it take for us redeemed who've been redeemed by the blood to bring a worship in our hearts to say holy is the lord holy is the lord and isaiah was changed by the vision this is an announcement for the bride that the world will fail you denominations will fail you friendships will fail you and even get you into trouble sometimes people will fail all around you but what's the answer to all that not to turn to your phone not to turn to more entertainments not to find another friend that's questionable that's not the answer when everything fails come into the presence of the lord come into the vision for this hour the bride's only escape from all of this right now is to escape into the vision of the lord for right now where we see him high and lifted up it's where he becomes the real friend that we're crying for it's the bride's only escape it's the bride's only escape it's the vision even when he preached to the young people in 1965 come follow me his prayer he says may these young people catch the vision for this hour you see this word it's not just a word it's a vision what god brought us in the message is not just word books and tapes and an app it's a vision for this hour and young people everyone if you catch the vision for this hour through the preaching of the word you catch the vision for this hour and get a new birth it changes everything it changes how you look at this message it changes that's why people walk away from it because they haven't caught the vision of what this is you know how i can overcome people failing me you know i can overcome people not liking me there's some people right now in my church i know they don't like me you know i overcome it i go to my little and room this message is bigger than people this message is bigger than me i'm not a know-it-all i don't know everything but when people don't like me if i if i escaped into that ice cream on the couch for a month it would do me no good and i could because i like ice cream if i escaped into my fossils i can't i don't like that they don't like me i don't know i'm gonna escape into this bitter for three or four days well you've just missed out on three or four days of enjoying the lord the devil's cheated you out of worrying about people who don't like you that's right you're always going to have that we're in 2022 friends and we're always going to have disappointments we're going to have family members we keep praying for and we're wondering after 20 years why aren't they coming lord it seems like you're not answering prayer and some prayers as i said last sunday david begged and fast for that baby to live and god took that baby and the maturity of david said i'll take god's grace and now deal with the troubles because god's in control what do we do we keep praying for our loved ones we keep praying for our kids we keep bringing it before the lord but i'm not going to have a disappointment he didn't answer my prayer i'm not going anywhere i'm staying in my little room i'm staying in the and worshiping before him if though god slay me yet i'll trust him though i have every family member taken away from me though i'd love to see every one of my family members serving the lord and they don't come as quickly as i should i'm going to keep believing but i'm not going to live in depression all that time i'm not going to say god's not answering my prayers so i just feel like giving up and i just i don't want to do anything anymore it's not worth it i've tried i tried i tried let's grow up let's escape into that little room let's not escape into social media let's not escape into a movie or something friends that's the world that's how they they have no other relief you got to hand it to them because you know they have things they have no other place to go our prophet seen marilyn monroe the top movie star see her in a vision cedar when she was passing away knew exactly how it happened and then god showed her her entire life and then he read an article on her said that she was put out by her mom she was a a a a ill i think an illegitimate child or was just put out and so here is this beautiful uh body of a woman and then she they put her up there but she was empty on the inside and god showed his prophet when she the very second she was dying he seen it and they said they said it's going to be a suicide but it wasn't a suicide you knew an article came out 10 years ago and proved it wasn't suicide 30 40 years later proven what the prophet seen in the vision she died in an overdose she died a heart attack because she's trying to get on but she's trying to get on the phone i see her get on the phone trying to call someone for help he's seen it all but you know what his cry was right here in this message influence you know his cry was i know what she was searching for and none of those people promoting her and promoting her body none of those people could give her the cry of her heart he said i hate it because i have what she was looking for if i could have just got to her i have the thing she was craving for listen friends we have the escape we have the place to go to let's not turn to worldly things for our escape in our loneliness in our depression they may turn to that but let's not turn to that ourselves everybody catch my service today everybody catch it we have a place to go [Applause] amnon had a friend but that tells the whole story it was the wrong one and the story would have been different if he would have seen this is a bad friend he's subtle this is a bad thing in my life this is something that's wrong and so i'll let the lord deal with me in the lust and all that but i've got to cut this friendship off i've got to cup this channel off i've got to stop looking and feeding on this thing my friend is going to be god my friend is going to be the body of christ my friends will be formed out of what god gives me out of his fountains i'll form it and i may only have one i don't have a lot of friends berry coffee and that's questionable sometimes friends like that who needs enemies no i love him we're different as anything but i love him but god gives us some in life and we appreciate them but if they were all taken away may i have the strength in me that if everyone falls around me i have a friend that sticks closer than a brother if my family fails me if i don't even have friends amongst my own family because a lot of you draw comfort from your family everybody else's family my family family family yes i understand but be prepared because they're not always perfect oh yes they are no they're not your kids will fail you you'll fail your kids you're going to be at odds with an uncle and sometimes they're even in the message it's just why the devil's working all the time you don't think the devil's working right now just split the unity in our assembly he's always working all the time he's always on the job you see so don't put your trust in friendships of this world don't put your full trust in family they can fail you but there's one that will never fail and that's our god amen our god is an awesome god he reigns from heaven above with with some power and love god is in us let's stand together our god
