TRANSCRIPT
========================================
in the needs of your life and my life and that's what we gather for we are hungry and we want to be fed from the word of god amen praise the lord if we missed any of our visitors feel welcome today and fellowship may god bless you i talked to a lady yesterday i know she's here she just lives down the road a little bit i don't know if joanie's here not got to talk to her on the phone yesterday and a lovely sister and she's wanting the home church and she has ms is that right brandon she has ms and so she's had a lot of complications and so we just want to maybe sometimes she can come and we'll lay hands on her anoint her with oil believe for her we've got a chance to share the message with her a little bit and she's asking what we believe here and what we stand for so let's just be praying for joni this morning colossians chapter 1 and verse 18 we'll pick up the scripture at verse 18. and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence how many believe that christ is the head of the body and when we have a a word picture like that then we realize that we look right to our own bodies and realize how many know that i can't have an action i can't move my hands unless they're first comes something and it goes very quickly from my head it receives instructions if it didn't have the head it would not be able to act correctly or act right or even act but because the head is attached to the body the head sends the instructions for everything else christ is the head of the church it is not our minds that we're interested in it's the mind of christ that we're interested in and as the body of christ comes under his preeminence then she functions and her actions all by the mind of christ by being led of the spirit and so something must happen and that is spiritually we have to come under the full preeminence of our head jesus christ he is the word can you say amen so we bring our lives under an authority we bring our lives under something we certainly you know if you think of the head you you think of a puppet a puppet has strings on it on its arms and on its on its feet and it a puppet is controlled it's not the mind of the puppet the puppet doesn't even have its own mind but it's it's controlled by someone else just moving the strings there's a lot of people in the face of the earth and some even within the church they're just puppets they haven't come under the headship of jesus christ yet they act on their own they do their own thing or they're controlled and influenced by someone else but the body of christ he is the head and it says the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence we'll get into that today for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him notice now to reconcile all things unto himself by him i say whether they be things in earth or things in heaven because we know some believers have gone on to the grave now gone to the other side some are on earth some are in heaven but i can tell you all who are predestinated in jesus christ because of calvary this reconciliation and bringing them back to the head is going to take place all that are in heaven all that are in earth all things in him will be reconciled so you notice now as the head comes down and the head becomes revealed to us and the the peace through the blood of the cross this this reconciling begins to happen in other words he's bringing all things back to himself the body that got detached in the fall of the garden the body that god detached is going to be reconciled to the head again i say whether they be things in earth or things in heaven and you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works that was you maybe you today but you who were alienated and enemies where in your mind by wicked works yet now have he reconciled i mean he can say that i was that was that i was an enemy in my mind i was alienated a lot of was because i was in my own mind not the mind of christ i did my own thing i functioned by my own deal but now he's reconciled us in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unpreprovable in his sight amen let's pray heavenly father we ask for your anointing upon the word of god today we are humbly coming before it the most sobering thing lord that takes place is when your presence comes in and begins to break the word to us lord it just makes our hearts broken lord the possibility of what you could speak under your anointing we need you lord we are hungry today and want to be fed lord i just pray you bless these children that have come and sang for us today lord and minister to us and just refreshed our spirit as a pastor and the the pastor's wife just refreshed our spirit to see their hearts and lord to look at them we look at the future we see your future church we see lord the the potentials of you filling them with your holy ghost and lord the church would go on no matter how much the world goes awry the church moves on lord to see your future they're singing for you saying that the singing that they're blessed it refreshes our spirit today lord thank you for this lovely congregation and the gift that they've given us and their love and support and their texts and emails and their their their their eyes lightening up lord by the word of god preached and just their hunger for it it's a it's a challenge to us lord and it's a wonderful thing we just pray you'll bless today lord and be with us strengthen us may you get in this word now and be present among us in jesus name amen amen shake somebody's hand before your seed and greet them in the name of the lord praise the lord a couple sundays ago when we were here we spoke on the finding god's authority and coming under god's authority authority has been a subject that has been abused and misused by satan and authority itself has been misused and so when you take subject of authority then we realize that it's people back off from it people are afraid of it and i mentioned to you as well we live in a culture where lawlessness will take over they don't want authorities over them they don't want anybody telling them what to do and the spirit of law and lawlessness is taking our country over and so we're not a part of that we're not a part of the the children how many know the bible says this refers to the children of disobedience so we live in the world that are children of disobedience to the word of god but we're not the children of disobedience we are the children of obedience to the word of god to his headship and to his authority we're not afraid of god's authority when author the authority of god first came into my life by the holy spirit i wasn't afraid of it thankfully i had been taught in a home that wasn't something to be afraid of authority wasn't abused in my home you come from a lot of homes sometimes that authority was abused authority was not used in the right way now we have governments and and different things in the government they're abusing their authority taking the liberties away from people but you see now uh when i come up i wasn't afraid of it so the authority being the word of god when god said something even though my flesh didn't like it i submitted to it i put my life underneath it because i didn't have a lack of trust i have to preach to it to people today that have a lot of a lack of trust in obeying authority they have a lack of trust and authority and i'm sensitive to that that authority has been hurt or ruined in your life or misused in your life used in the wrong way but let's never dump the baby out with the bath water let's never dump out the fact that god's authority is latin it's not like man's authority god's authority is what you want to bring your life under can you say man and the body needs to come under the head jesus christ because you'll find no greater protection and love can you say amen you'll find no greater blessing because the thing about the head coming to the body and connecting with it is that everything that's in the head flows down into the body of christ that's a benefit that's not like the headship of this world authority of the world where the boss is the boss and you get pushed along the side just come under my head chef that's not like this at all everything that let me say it this way all that was in god he poured into christ and all that was in christ he pours into the church now i want to be under authority like that because he gives his church authority as she comes under his authority and she functions not by her own mind but truly by the mind of christ where do we find that where do we find the this where do we find what he wants done with the word what we find it in the word of god we find it in the word for the day we find it in present truth and so now i want to go deeper into the subject of finding this authority coming underneath it i might be on the subject for a few weeks because authority is such a big subject but in this scripture we read this morning colossians chapter one it's just another phase of looking at god's headship and us coming underneath it i just want to open this as a foundation and just say now how many know that redemption is not finished yet redemption is not finished yet and even though in christ eyes at the cross he could say because of calvary it is finished as far as he was concerned the price had been paid the bride had been bought back can you say man she was in the pawn shop he paid the price to buy her back but there's a process to redemption and and paying the price of redemption is only the first phase of redemption paying there if you look back in the book of ruth you find phases of redemption ruth came under uh the power of redemption and she come as a moabite girl she didn't know anything about the ways of god and yet she is a type of the bride would come into naomi's family and then she would come over into israel she'd move into bethlehem and hopefully i get the chance to talk about her because as ruth made decisions to get closer and closer as she come closer and closer to the the ways of jehovah and she embraced them and she made a decision naomi your god will become my god naomi remember this is a moabite woman they worshipped all kinds of gods but she made a decision she said i don't want those other gods i want your god your god will be my god your ways will be my ways your lifestyle will be my lifestyle even though it's contrary to the world it's contrary to the moabites i want this and she made a decision i want your god i want his ways i want jehovah i want what jehovah's prophets say what did what did the prophets of jehovah say and i want to listen nobody else was saying that but ruth said i want and guess what when she made a decision to come underneath that then she come under something i'll call the power of redemption i'll tell you that's the place you want to be you may not be all where you need to be today but i'm going to hopefully show you that you can bring your life under the word for this hour and become submissive to it and just little steps like ruth did little steps towards that brings you under the power of redemption and so i'll just say that we're not finished with redemption yet why truth is she every step she did i don't want to preach it now it's for the end i've got it at the end of my notes every step she made guess what brought her closer to boaz she made a little step and she and then but it crossed and one day boaz was in the same field that she was in she got to talk to boaz type of christ and then she got to be around boaz and then she humbled herself to come under and put the under his feet and just laid at his feet all night right next to boaz she's getting closer and closer to christ and guess what she became the wife of boaz to bring full redemption to naomi and her whole family but she wasn't fully redeemed until he paid the price so boaz paid the price but it wasn't just paying the price he had to be willing to pay the price he had to he had to have all he had to be a near kinsman he had to have all these qualifications we have a near kinsman jesus christ he's the closest kinsman that can redeem us can you say mine and he went to calvary and he paid the price for our redemption but redemption is not finished yet just because the price price was paid jesus said it is finished but as far as you and i we're still under the power of redemption this word this message what god has sent in the last days as we come underneath it it's got a power of redemption that's raising us up you see brother paul are you sure not we're not through with your redemption well one reason i know that i'm not in full redemption this morning is that i'm still living in this body that's 55 that's getting old and he promised in his redemption that he would give me a new body so redemption isn't finished yet this morning aren't aren't some of you old people gray-haired people bald people glad that we're not done with redemption yet all right not too i i know i'm glad i'm looking forward to about a 21 year old body a theophany body a word body see where is he going i'm writing the scripture i'm writing the bible and so now we are in a process of redemption if you know your bible then it he pays the price and then he in the last after 2000 years of church history we pick up revelations 5 and we have this book of redemption with this book that's closed and sealed with seven seals it's the book of redemption well in the end time it's closed it's not open even though the price was prey our lamb had to come and take that book of redemption because that's the title deed that adam lost in the garden he had the title deed to this earth he had the power he had the authority and he lost it all and so now it it went back into the hands of the title deed to this earth went back into the hands of the original owner and here in revelation 5 we pick up the end time where now that book has got to be unsealed and that book of redemption has to be given back to the people of god again we're not finished with redemption but i can tell you we're awful close to close to the final stages because i can tell you the lamb has broke the seals not six of them all seven of them how many believe that this morning and since we know that he's broke the seals the book of redemption redemption is finishing our names are in that book of redemption he'll reveal the names in the book of the judges see brother paul is this happening why we get together and preach and different ministers come through and they're preaching the end time message they're preaching the seals open they're preaching all the seals this is an open book we're not under a closed book of redemption anymore revelations 5 it was opened by our lamb can you say mine sent to his prophet on earth this he broke the seals threw him to a seventh angel messenger on earth blasted them before the people and now all this preaching that you're hearing at the end time is not just to give you another feeling or sensation it's to show your name in the book because when john seen his name in the book he must have seen his name in there because he said i started to shout i started to glorify god i started to praise the lord all of heaven all of earth everything in creation heard me saying worthy is the lamb that was slain it was shouting time in heaven we know there's a shouting time in heaven when someone gives their heart to the lord and repents but in revelations 5 everything began to shout and worship and glorify god not because of salvation not that that was one thing but now because redemption we could we could shout all morning over salvation you ought to be happy that you're saved this morning by calvary but now we come to the end time and the book of redemption is open and he says all of creation heard me shouting all of a sudden now we realize the book of redemption the seals are taken off the book we can look and see our name in the book see our place in the scripture say listen like the harlot said i'm not a harlot i'm a daughter of god [Applause] he said brother branham said the day i realized i wasn't the son of charles and alibranum naturally he was but he said i realize i've seen my name i've seen my place in the word and i was not the son of charles and elle branham i'm a son of god true identity comes out so listen if there was worship because he was the creator in revelations one and two they worshipped because thou art worthy excuse me you've created all things they were worshiped because of creation but now the worship increases and the worship is even deeper because the seals have been broken and we can see our names in the book so i wanted to say that's when we get together and hear the preaching of the last days it's not just church it's not just getting together fulfilling a duty it's not just coming here and punching a clock and saying i went to church today when we gather under the revealed word of god and the seals are open christ is revealing your name in the book christ is showing your true identity [Applause] this isn't just time to just fill a religious duty this is the time to see our place lift our hands and say thou art worthy o lord the worship goes deeper than a sensation all due respect a lot of worship in pentecost is just a sensation it's just an emotion and i'm not against that i love to be emotional but our worship needs to go deeper than just a carnal outside sensation and i felt tingles up my arm you need to find your life in christ to live an overcoming life you need authority against the enemy not in church you need authority when you're dealing with the devil out there come on you got to agree with me how many wants more authority of god to deal with your devil how many has a devil how many has the same enemy i'm fighting come on you got at the very basic you got to raise your hand said i got the same enemy the devil and i need the authority of jesus name to go against him so we have to examine that we're in the process it's not that we're going to church or we have a bible or that we have message books it's that he is the word and he is wanting to get the preeminence in all things that's where we're at it's not just that you have a bible this morning it's not just that you go to church what is god doing the head has come down the word the mind of christ has come to us and it is the word and he is working to get preeminence in your life in all things what does preeminence mean i'm glad you ask preeminence means superiority in rank it means precedence it means he gets the precedence above all things that he is before all things it even says that in the bible he is before all things and by him all things consist and in the amplified that says he is before all things and by him all things are held together this whole universe is held together by the word of his power his authority holds it all together and if you bring your life under his preeminence then that's the only way your life is held together better stay right here he should be before all things in your life the word should be before all things and by him all things are held together because if you trust in your insurance or if you trust in your doctor if you trust in your government if you trust in your new business adventure it's you know me and my wife we do some business adventures and i'm always saying well we'll pray about this we'll get some advice this week we're asking advice about something we're going to do and i said you know what i just said to the lord i said i'm we're doing this and we pray we're in your will lord guide us and lead us but all of that to me is just fragile there's nothing secure in it so your life your business ventures your new the entertainments that you follow the fashions of the world if that's what you're it's fragile it's falling apart can you say man i called the doctor i was sick on thursday i called i just had a cold don't worry i'm not going to spread anything i'm i'm six feet from brother tony here i said i got a cold i i hadn't called her in six or eight months and i called i said can i get in and see the doctor today and see if this is any kind of infection you know she said she said the doctor dr smith is not seeing any sick patients in her office right now so i just got quiet and i just thought about that then just think about it my doctor's not seeing any sick patients in her office at this time is she seeing healthy patients in her office has thing changed that much what kind of crazy world are we living in i'm sick i'd like to see my doctor well she's not seeing sick patients in there maybe over the phone and goes on and on and on so i just said you know what we'll get to it another time hopefully i survive by him all things are held together and i believe in doctors and i'm thankful for doctors i'm thankful for the medicines that's been given can you say amen i'm thankful for what science provides for us but at the end of the day we have a healer we have a god we're under his headship and if we depend too much on this world and not on the one that's actually holding this world together and holding everything together our lives he needs to be before all things and by him he needs to be the one holding your life together can i get an amen this morning that's where our life has got to come he is before all things he's before any decisions he's before anything that you do he is consulted he's our consultant he's our counselor he's our guide he's our shepherd he's our leader can you say amen he's our financial counselor he has to be everything to us now god can god use human flesh and god would skin on yet he can use men to give counsel we seek counsel on different things but we cannot put our trust in man it has to be in our head and a wife does that to the headship of her husband it's not about you know you're under my authority no if she's the right authority she says i bring my life how many times i've seen wife say and there's this when they say this i know there's a man that's a real leader because she says i'm happy to let my husband lead our lives and i'm praying for my head and i'm gonna be guided by the decisions god gives him if he asks my input i'm gonna give it because god can work speak through both of us we understand that but she said i'm happy to be under the protection of my husband that god's leading him and i will follow that lord don't hear that too much today but there's something about the true authority of god that we don't have to fight against we just say lord that's actually a safe place to be that's actually a place that i don't have to make all the decisions let him make them amen i've also i've also had wife say you know if he messes up he's in trouble with god not with me but you just it's just released trust and obey so if that's true in a right kind of marriage relationship it's true in our relationship with the lord there's a trust and obey and there's a coming underneath it and so now preeminence i didn't finish the meeting yet going very slow today but preeminence is support superiority and rank precedence he's before it's it's preeminence that's he's above and i like this that's the priority of place in other words he has first place christ is the principal theme of this bible how many say amen christ it's not just stories christ is revealed in every scripture in this bible christ is the mystery of god revealed from the old testament to the new testament christ is revealed in every scripture if you don't see christ in it go back and read it again christ is the center of this bible he's the principal theme of this bible so now he needs to become the principal theme of our lives so we can say we're under headship and under his leadership but then so this is the last meaning of preeminence superiority of power or influence that's the word i want to use superiority in other words he is before he is above me he is my headship and he has preeminence in all things he has supported a superiority of power or influence in my life he's the greatest influence in my life he has the greatest powerful influence on my decisions on what's in my mind what's in my thoughts what's in my life how i raise my children how i conduct my finances whatever i do he is the main influence from my decisions i wanted to get into my personal testimony today because when god filled me with the holy ghost at 16 then then i began to realize i needed to attach myself and feed on as much as i can the word of god for the hour first of all i devoured my bible the whole you know one of the evidence is that you have the holy ghost one of the i know there's a lot of different evidences including the evidence of speaking in tongues which the the pentecostal world has taught as being the initial evidence i i beg to dis differ a little bit because i think it has to be deeper than just speaking in tongues we believe in speaking in tongues i told the sister yesterday we believe in all nine spiritual gifts here but we never take one of the nine spiritual gifts and make it the evidence of the holy ghost if god is working in a church you'll see those nine spiritual gifts working in the church but the evidence of the holy ghost is that he that happened here to hear what the spirit is saying to the churches your heart connects and say i believe that by the holy ghost i believe what he's saying to the church in other words the evidence of the holy ghost never denies any of this bible because the holy ghost wrote this bible you can have a cursed person speaking in tongues and divine denying some of the word ain't going to happen the holy ghost always says amen to every word of god including the message of the last days so my testimony was is when i be i devoured my bible because with my holy ghost came this incredible craving and vacuum for the word i wanted to hear the word now i had been raised in church but you see when you receive the holy ghost it changes how you're hearing it i heard the message i heard the bible my whole life in sunday school that's what we should do praise the lord but it never clicked it never become personal to me until i received the holy ghost and i remember the night in the service i received the holy spirit while the word was being preached the book of acts says that by the way is that while peter yet spake these words the holy ghost fell on them you can receive the holy ghost this morning while i'm preaching to you if you believe he's here won't you raise your hand and said i receive it in the name of the lord jesus christ but i did not come to the word opening to me until i received the holy ghost because i didn't have the amen or on the inside i didn't have the craving the holy ghost only feeds on one thing the word the holy ghost doesn't feed on entertainment the holy ghost doesn't feed on a fellowship it's all important but my holy ghost only feeds on one thing and that's the word and i got this incredible craving i devoured the word of god and the message of the last days i said if god was gracious enough to send elijah in the last days to restore the word i ought to give some time to hear what he said and i said i wanted to know the authority of god i wanted to know his headship what does his word say about everything what does his word say i want to know what it says because i want to bring my life under the headship of the word i don't want to be this deformed creature that's over here and my head is over there and i'm just trying to function like a puppet i wanted to bring my life under the headship of the word of god that's a visual right there by the way that's what i can come up with this morning devoured the message of the last days sent by the seventh angel elijah malachi 4 5 and 6. matthew 17 11. he said well did jesus say anything about it jesus himself referred to elijah truly shall come and restore all things we're past that day now but it's the first key scriptures that jesus said in the prophecy for the last days elijah will come and restore lost truths that ministry is over now but the moving of the holy ghost is not over there's a revival by the word of god in the bride of jesus christ it's a word revival by his spirit making the word real making the word alive can you say amen making things that lay there may be dead in the scripture making it alive to you that's the bride's revival a word revival a spirit revival can you say amen because the spirit had been bound for almost 2 000 years at the door of creeds and dogmas of the church i'm going to lay a heavy one on you the holy spirit for the most part bound up through the dark ages by the time we get the end time the holy spirit was bound by creeds and dogmas of men in christianity when you mess with this word you bind the spirit up the holy spirit was bound for almost 2000 years by creeds and dogmas of banned but he said it's to be released in the evening time by the evening time message so when did it start little man luther in the catholic church threw the bread down said this isn't the literal body struggled if you watch some of the movies he's just almost insane i've got to have the assurance that i'm saved instead of looking to the catholic church he looked to his bible and the bible said the just shall live by faith if i have faith in what the son of god did at calvary then god says i can be saved and he had a conversion he had to change not by a candle can you say amen not by a confession to a priest can you say amen not by saying the communion bread was the literal body of jesus christ he threw it down he said that just shall live by faith and that was the beginnings of god restoring his message to the church the spirit was released slowly released people come under the freedom and said praise be to god and they actually got almost too excited because they begin to build a denomination around luther don't do that don't take a man and build a denomination around it don't take luther and build a denomination and they did the lutherans don't take wesley and build a denomination don't do that let the spirit take you to the next step pentecost so you got luther wesley restored sanctification to the church we should live a sanctified life the spirit released to the people then azusa street the outpouring of the gifts 1906 is who's the street god restoring the gifts back to the church god restored the blessings back to the church the shouting can you say man and the freedom god but it wasn't the final step god's taken us to more than just the gifts being restored to the church god is releasing his spirit fully released by the evening time message his spirit bound by creeds and dogmas and oh it's been released in the evening time don't don't take it and build a lutheran out of it all respect to you lutheran people i'm not teaching against you if you're listening this morning don't take wesley and build the nazarene church and this denomination pentecost two years after 1906. if you don't know your history that's that's up to you i've read the history two or three years after 1906 they started to split into denominations assembly of god church of god no don't do that don't do that let's pray and let's let the holy spirit take us to the next step let's not buying this up by denomination like the catholic church did that's right hey i love you i wouldn't be saying this unless i loved you you just chew on it you just think about it i'm saying the holy spirit is not to be bound up by our ideas or denominational ideas it's to be loose to the people in the end time and why is it to be loose so that the body can bring hit make him the full preeminent the head the word comes back to his church that sons and daughters can come under his preeminence and exercise the true authority of jesus christ carrying the name of jesus you're not carrying his name just because you say his name but you have his name by spirit praise the lord still love me hey just give me a listen give me a chance here all right so in my testimony you know and when we look at our lives this morning it really begs the question i'm only on the first paragraph of what i'm preaching this morning you can tell i'm having a real good time i won't be long but what i have to say i think you should take and chew on it this begs the question now when we talk about the superiority of superiority of influence in our life who's the most influence in our life so it really begs the question in your life who has the final say of things in your life you know brother brahm taught us the absolute is the word of god there has to be an absolute to anything when you come up to the corner and there's a red light if there was no red light there some corners would be chaos and all kinds of accidents so there's an absolute at the corner when we drive up there's a red light there's a green light you can't go to it turns green you shouldn't there's an absolute there's an absolute at a baseball game come on and people fuss and stew about the absolute of that umpire he makes a call you can disagree with all you want to but we're going to have a pretty crazy game if somebody don't have the final word whether you agree with him or not the umpire has the final word and that's where we need to come spiritually that our absolute is not some two-bit preacher on the internet our absolute is not some family member some uncle telling us what to do our absolute has to be rooted in the word of god he should have the final say who has the final say in all things in our life who decides what we do what influence will be given to the decisions for all things in our life there's some questions i'm asking you this morning who decides who decides what's this who decides what's modest who's it left up to what influence will be given to decisions in all your life and this is the hour that we're in now this is the work of the lord now it's not that we know that jesus was our god or that he paid the price of redemption it's the power of redemption working in us and our obedience to the word makes the authority of god flow into his body as we make him the full preeminent one we make him the full influence in our life the word has the full influence it influences my decisions it influences my life can you say amen praise the lord this bride of the last days i want to tell you what she's doing this bride that i'm preaching to and the ones around the world that are coming under the headship of the word finally out of denomination under only one head jesus christ the word even the book of revelation says it about that system come out of her my people come out of those systems come back to the word little bride and you're not gonna be under a pastor you're not going to be and i know we're under pastors but it's not going to be the headship of the nicolaitan spirit where the where is some dictatorship num some denominational head sending out a book to you to tell you what to preach no the bride is going to accept one handship and that's the headship of the revealed word of the hour come out of her my people come out of those denominations come out of those systems you say well our church is independent well just make sure that they're believing all the word of god and the word for this age if they're not come out of that mess that's what the bible says for you to do get under the headship of the word of god the bride the last day's bride i already said this a couple sundays ago but it was so good i'm going to say it again the last bride the last day's bright is reversing all the rebellion of lucifer in heaven it started there didn't it started with lucifer his influence on the other angels his rebellion to authority he was right next to the authority of god god's right hand man god it's right-hand angel so to speak great chief musician greatly talented closest to god that you could get exercise was under the authority of god and all of a sudden he comes out from underneath that throat says i'm going to lift my kingdom above his kingdom lucifer was the first one to establish the principle of rebellion to the word of god i don't want to live by that principle he comes out but this bride is reversing the rebellion of lucifer this bride is also reversing the fall in the garden the bride of the last days is reversing the fall in the garden soon as calvary the purchased price was prayed at calvary god birthed the bride on the day of pentecost and for 2000 years he's been bringing the names that's on the lamb's book of life bringing him to a conversion to a new birth and when we climax at the end time this bride is going to have the same test that eve had she's going to have the same serpent whispering in her ear are you listening the hiss of the serpent will be in the ears of the last days people god didn't really say that or god didn't mean it the way that he said it but now we're in a time that the prophet said this second eve this bride is here to prove to satan that this eve is not like the first eve i don't know what you think of yourself this morning but i'm trying to give you an identity that if you latch onto it's pretty powerful that i stand in a position not by arrogance or pride by authority that i'm actually acting out the word of god to reverse what happened in the garden and to prove to satan this second eve is not like the first eve she won't fall by a misinterpretation of the word she won't follow man's ideas she has one headship that's the word of god and she won't fall like eve how many believe christ was the second adam if you're a bible reader christ was the second adam if there was a second adam there has to be a second eve and i'm it you're it can you say amen this eve is to prove to the devil that this eve is not like the first eve no no no no satan we're not following by it we're not listening to the hits of the serpent we're not listening to any other ideas of man except the true word of god not listening to it i learned this that's how the fall happened and i'm being used to reverse this whole thing until the devil's really he's howling now satan is howling over this word coming to the bride this book of redemption this message of the last days this revival he's howling at it that's why he's fighting you every day that's why he's whispering in you that's why the accuser of the brethren is still saying you're not it you're not the bride you're not the one you're just no you made this mistake you did this the other day how can you be the bride listen quit listening to the accuser of the brethren [Applause] stop listening to him i'm this i'm that we know the devil's lying with his lips are moving and he's always moving in your ear the accuser knows accuser of who not the accuser of donald trump joe biden it's not it's that that's all that's a sideshow it's not what's happening we're what's happening the body of christ is what's happening it's just a sideshow so if he's the accuser of not donald trump not not hillary it's not bothering her he's bothering you he's speaking in your ear that's when the bride says okay i'm getting out of that channel i'm gonna quit listening to his voice shut up satan and just i don't know if the devil keeps badgering you so bad remind him and remind you of your past you remind him of the future is that right you say satan since you keep hanging around and i've told you to go let's have a bible study what do you say see where could we go i know you don't like genesis because that exposes when you started but we don't have much time satan so let's skip to the book of revelations let's have a bible study if he's not gone yet i'd be surprised because he don't want to hear his future in the book of revelations because there's there's many scriptures in there talked about his doom his end and the lake of fire you know what the lake of fire hell in the lake of fire was not created for me what kind of devil is telling the bride that you're going to go to hell tell him that hell was created for satan and his angels hell was not created for me i'm not even predestinated to be there no hell is not for me i'm not going to hell i'm going in a rapture someday because of the word of god that i believe oh somebody ought to shout this morning somebody ought to say praise the lord tell the devil say oh there's a lot of scriptures here that we can go do but because you've accused me the last few days let's go to the one that says and satan was cast down the accuser of the brethren to accuse them no more [Applause] and then poof he goes away and he'll leave you alone for maybe a few days a few hours and then you got to have another bible study whatever is needed for this guy whatever is needed for this dude take care of them through the word of god drop some a-bombs on them the word of god he hates it he's howling and then when this bride begins and it's not just that we say i'm bride i'm in the message of the last days i've come out of her my people i'm under the freedom of spirit of the lord jesus christ it's not that it's when she really begins to come under the headship in her life and he looks and say says i've got the preeminence in that brother and sister's life my son and daughter they're starting to exercise a life every day of living in the spirit anybody ever heard of it walking in the spirit living in the spirit is that i don't make any decisions too quickly and if uncle so-and-so calls and says you should do this say all right i appreciate the input but i don't make any decisions too quickly unless i consult the lord and his word and i go into the message of the last days and i research it and i research my bible and i look at what the prophet of god said and i look say god is there something that you can show me to give me direction because i don't make any decisions too hastily unfortunately there's some decisions in life you have to make quick the less of those we have the better you just depend on the lord and sometimes wing it but you don't want to do that too often you're going to give it time and you let an influence come in your life of your decisions and your flesh may want something so bad but god looks down at his son and sees all that battle going on and he says i've finally seen my son wait a little bit and he didn't act in decisions with his flesh or his own intellect or his background education or what he thinks is best he consulted me and he obeyed what i the direction i gave him god just breathe breathes it in this is what i've been trying to get through for 6 000 years my sons adam's race restored back to being under the full headship of leadership of the holy spirit they don't live by impressions we don't believe something just because something comes to our mind people think because something came to their mind it's god speaking to them not always you better check that out see if it lines up with the word people think because they thought it it's final they it's it's in a lot of it is their own opinions their own oppressions their own fleshly affection we've got to move past that is this okay amen hey man let's give the lord a handclap afraid so i'm taking a drink [Applause] i don't know why i feel so free this morning but when those kids sing to you like that give you a charge and when you're headed out to the smoky mountains for vacation tonight i don't know maybe that's what it is i'm just i'm just gonna blast this out and i'm skipping out nobody can find me but the mountains are calling and i must go john muir said that once you guys put up that quote brother bradham and christ the mystery of god revealed look at here christ the mystery of god revealed moses his intellectuals he had to lose them in order to find christ to be a prisoner and then went and he's referring to in the bible where paul a prisoner he preached a message paul a prisoner and that's a strange subject that he became bound by only the holy spirit he wouldn't act unless the holy spirit led him paul became a prisoner not only a physical prisoner but he was a prisoner to the will of man and his own will he's a prisoner to the will of god he had come to a place and this is why he referred this he said to be a prisoner moses he had lose them in order to find christ then when god got all the world beat out of moses and all of his mighty men that he was and stand in the presence of that pillar of fire that day uh i believe brother nathan last sunday spoke about the pillar of fire how many remember that when he come in the presence of the pillar of fire that day he was found just speechless god broke him down i tell you when we come into the real presence of god it's just all of our tr former training everything that we are it just breaks us down and it just makes us species that god how do you want to use me he was just found speechless he didn't even couldn't even talk he said god had a prisoner then you see you won't try after your own searching next next one then god had to endow him with power enough that he could go down there and he said lord i told pharaoh what you said and he wouldn't do it and he said then take this thyroid god speaking that's god's word go out there and point it towards the east and call for flies and flies came into creation because he had a prisoner that pharaoh couldn't pay off with nothing what is that saying what the word says is that he gives his authority to people when they become prisoners to his will moses finally come to the place i can't use my background i can use my education i can't do i can't even speak right lord and then god had him exactly where he wanted them and he said now i'm ready to use you and he said pharaoh listen to me take your rod stand up like you said at the red sea why cry speak and go forward i've called you you're my son you have the authority go forward in the name of jesus moses grabbed that rod with there in it and everything he spoke and creative power was on his lips a human being let there be let there be flies and there was flies everywhere let there be this blood in the water let the you know all the plagues that begin to come down the authority that was upon that land's lips but remember brother branham is saying he had a prisoner god had a prisoner that pharaoh couldn't pay off with nothing is there any left of that nothing else could turn him no way he was a complete prisoner in the chains of god's word bound up only to thus saith the lord oh if god can get him prisoners like that oh if you could raise your hand church this morning say god truly make me a prisoner to your will let me not act unless it's truly your word and your will which is his will it's his word oh if i could preach this morning and have at the end of this service we may not have shouting we may have dancing i don't know what we'll have but if i could have some people leave that's true say lord make me a prisoner to your will then i've accomplished my sermon this morning make me a prisoner to the word of god because i know that's when god can really use the authority in the church he's got to get that he said now oh if god can get in prisons like that that's when he can express his preeminences you see he's got the man or the person so that he knows nothing but christ [Applause] the threefold purpose of god is that god would fully reveal himself to man number one and number two that he would get the preeminence in his body and number three he would take them back to eden again it's the threefold purpose of god to reveal himself to man through jesus christ did he do that he fulfilled that purpose when he came in jesus christ god revealed himself to man fully in the body of jesus christ jesus was god he wasn't a second person of the trinity all that god was he poured into that human vessel see that's a mystery i know it is a mystery that is the mystery of god don't try to split them into three people no don't try to do that i'm i'm a father i'm a husband i'm i have a lot of offices too many but i'm all the same person don't split god into three and make an idolatrous out of you no don't do it and i say that respectfully to all of our trinitarian brothers and sisters i respect you as a brother in christ but don't try to sell you can't sell it to a jew you can never sell three distinct persons to a jew never happened a true jew hero israel the lord our god is one lord in three offices of father son holy spirit but he's one god and so god manifested himself in jesus christ can you say amen number two to get the preeminence in man and that's the work he's in right now but guess what happens when he gets the preeminences in the church he takes them back to eden again can you say amen praise the lord can i have 10 more minutes amen so let's go back where we fell let's go back to genesis 1. all right genesis 1 genesis 3 let's read that and then i'll bring this down to a close i mean i'm unlike the second or third paragraph so many things to talk about but i want those children to come and sing again in a few minutes and sing about how blessed we are here's where we fell genesis 3 we were gods adam and eve were gods on earth they had all authority over the earth they named the animals nothing controlled adam adam controlled things how many would like to be back there again nothing controlled adam adam controlled things through the power of god he ruled and reigned on this earth he was this earth was given for him this earth is given to his bride to his people this earth is fast falling back into the hands of sons and daughters of god very quickly let presidents and prime ministers fight over land all they want to let them war even over the land of israel but that that real estate is fast falling back into the hands of god's people gonna happen but the whole earth was given this real estate this whole planet was given for adam to rule and reign on that's what it was created for and it's fast falling back into the hands of sons and daughters of god and so i just chuckle when i'm on the news watching how they fight over land and war and i'm saying it's all going to be mine someday guys you're wasting all your money it's fast falling back into the hands of the bride there's going to be a millennium i don't want it the way that it is by the way i don't want it the way that it is there's too many demons on this earth there's too much perversion on this earth it's too much a mess so i want god to come with his holy fire and purge the whole thing and burn it all and then he's going to set up a millennium of a thousand years honeymoon with the bride because he's already marrying the bride right now and it's going to be a thousand years honeymoon in a millennium i'm not talking about a story i'm talking about the word of god this earth is fast falling back into the hands of the bride and we will rule and reign on this earth again thousand-year honeymoon that's a pretty long one i don't know how long philip's going to be gone brother doug you know he's not here today it's like is he taking a thousand years or what tell him to come home my goodness a thousand years that's pretty good i'm in how about you this earth is fast falling back in but he says now the serpent was more subtle i know where i'm at in my time i'll be right in about an hour the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yea hath god said so this creature that god part of god's creation of course satan anoints him because he can speak he uses this serpent because he can speak yeah hath god said and what he's speaking is not just cussing he's actually quoting the word of god for some reason that's because satan's behind him speaking and he's going to cause the fall yeah god said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god hath said now here eve she knew her words she knew what god had said i want you to notice though when god told adam and eve don't eat of that tree don't touch don't even don't eat of it don't feed on it and don't even touch it now friends sometimes god tells us don't feed on something and then he says to some things don't even touch it speed ahead to satan's eden today and you young people and you adults and everybody can apply this to everything in your life there are certain things that god warns us about even though it's not a spirit yet it can become a spirit when you look at the message keep that in mind that when you read certain things you say that's a strange thing to say matter of fact for some of you who've never read the message a lot of it's going to be counter culture but if you read it just sit on it a while because some of it is not it's some of it's not saying you're you're this or that it's saying that if you were to head down this direction this is where you where you end up because god's prophets do that they give warnings too it's not just you're this you're a dirt bag you're living in sin it's it's a warning to say if you go this path you will be living in sin i like people to say i'm interested in listening to not only god's uh god's diagnosis of me but i'm listening to his warnings i wish we had more children that listen to the warnings of parents you're going to get burned if you touch that sometimes god's just warning us and people feel so condemned and is he telling me that is he saying i'm a because i wear these shorts and listen grow up some things the prophet said is to warn us where it's going if you play and flirt with that thing you could take a feminine spear maybe you can look at the message a little different now it's to me it's all the love of god loving his people out of this generation who's going to be destroyed and he's loving us saying this is your way out don't do that you start listening to it and you come into the power of redemption which redemption only heads in one direction that's upwards eve i want you to know somebody eve when god told adam and eve and this is proof this morning that i have to continue this next next time i preach because there's too much here but if you just give me these just a few minutes here i just want to say when god told them don't eat of that tree don't touch it the tree of knowledge of good and evil he didn't even give him an explanation why everybody knows that right there was no reason why and and so now you look at it and you say he said don't eat you can eat of all the other trees but don't eat of that one with no explanation so what's it about it's just basically trust and obey if it was like a modern generation teenager today why i'm not doing it until i know why boy fellow you got a rough path ahead of you if you want to come in relation with god you'll never go with that attitude because there are some things god tells us to do and he doesn't fully explain it right off the bat didn't tell him and now he eve quotes it back to the serpent she knew it well we may eat of the fruit of the trees of garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god hath said eve quoting god ye shall not eat of it neither ye touch neither you touch it lest ye die and that's what he told us that's what god said that's our source and the serpent said unto the woman you should not surely die i mean think about that a minute well first of all god he just he's just out to kill you like that so quickly god's a loving god jesus is a loving jesus he is but if you read the four gospels your interpretation of love isn't going to come through very strong in some of the ways jesus is talking to the religious leaders his love was not rooted in feelings it was rooted in truth oh come on can you say man don't turn me off give me give me three more minutes here i know i'm in i'm in your face this morning but you know i love you and i'm just asking you to consider it the serpent said the woman you should not surely die for god doth know that here's the serpent talking god doth no all of a sudden he becomes an interpreter now he becomes an interpreter of what god said it hasn't been interpreted yet to eve but he becomes the interpreter of what god said for god he becomes this great theologian on god all of a sudden for could it be that a lot of the theologians were hearing the hiss of the serpent more than the bars more than the prostitute houses that the voice here was like it was in the serpent he's not out there trying to get you to be a prostitute he's here quoting and interpreting the word of god that's your enemy be careful the voice you listen to be careful the preachers you listen to because here satan's speaking through the serpent and he's going to interpret god doth know that in the day ye ether of then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil and eve had never heard any interpretation yet and so now he explores this interpretation god knows this and god knows if you eat that you need to know something if you eat that you'll become as a god well first of all adam and eve should have been saying why are you selling us on the fact of becoming gods when we're already gods over this earth god has already put us in authority what a misinterpretation what a lie first lie that was ever told as a big one and then he's this little thing i've got to get up here and finish and quit he says this thing ye shall know good and evil it's kind of a enticement that that to to discern good and evil i could come into the place that i'm the one discerning good and evil instead of god now think about that because that's what i'm preaching on this morning he's influencing her decision making process and saying you can even be as a god and the whole thing of discerning what's right and wrong will be in your hands that's pretty serious because sons of god when they get a new birth and they grow into the redemption that god is doing they eventually come to even this because they're looking at this fall in the garden they're saying is that where she fell they're saying sons of god are saying i don't even want to exercise my own will and my own discernment by myself of what's right and what's wrong i'm going to close on this watchman knee missionary to china he was chinese 1950s had some wonderful books and wonderful things he said here about authority and uh watchman knee the missionary to china was he had some pretty straight words for the church and he says he was the guy that said i can't believe all that the american church can accomplish without the leadership of the holy ghost he's pretty straight and he talked to ministers over there for many years and then he was in hong kong he was safe when rush when when uh china turned to communism in somewhere in the 1950s he knew if he went back he'd go to prison and he intentionally says i got to go back to my people i got a minister there as soon as he got back within three weeks he was put in prison sentenced to 20 years spent the last 20 years of his life in prison was not allowed to do anything except the chinese government what they said for him to do so you imagine this whole flow and stream of the holy spirit all these books and all this training and all that he's seen in the word is completely cut off and i don't know what he was doing for 20 years except praying 20 years and then when his sentence was over they didn't let him go they didn't release him so he ended up staying there and dying in prison he says about this fall he says as man's as man's obedience increases a christian now as a man's obedience increases his actions decrease when we begin to follow the lord we are full of activity but quite short of obedience this is true although we get the holy ghost near a new birth it's like jesus he learned obedience by the things he suffered we start a life of learning how to be obedient to the spirit and he says when we come to the lord we're full of activity i want to go go go but quite short on obedience but as we advance in spirituality our actions gradually diminish until we are filled with obedience many however do what they like and refuse to do what they dislike they never ponder whether or not they are acting out of their obedience hence many works are done out of self and not of obedience to god now he has makes a little comment here about this knowledge man's actions should not be governed by the knowledge of good and evil it should be motivated by a sense of obedience the principle of good and evil is to live according to what is right and what is wrong if you know you know there's people in the world without christ without christianity just secular people that they they live in this this sense of what's right and wrong i want to do what's right and i don't want to do what's wrong the principle of good and evil is to live according to what is right and wrong before adam and eve ate the forbidden fruit their right and wrong was in god's hands if they did not live before god they knew nothing at all for their right and wrong actually were in god that's deep friends i shouldn't bring something so deep as i'm closing for the right and wrong they're they're right and wrong adam and eve was actually in god by taking the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil they found a source of right and wrong other than god himself consequently after the fall men need not find in god the sense of right and wrong they have it in themselves this is a result of the fall the work of redemption is to bring us back to the place where we will now find our right and wrong only in god that's it friends i got to stop what a powerful statement redemption is bringing us back to the place sons and daughters of god that all of our right and wrong is only in god i'm looking for his influence i'm looking for his direction i'm looking for him to say we live in a world where all of our absolutes are out the door there's not an absolute anymore they're removing all the absolutes even about a man what's a man and what's a woman there is no absolute anymore but i'm preaching to you god has an absolute and his sons know right and wrong because he told us right and wrong [Applause] praise be to god i gotta stop it's like that little that little uh that sunday school class and they're you know there's just certain things adam and eve didn't know certain things god says hey that's it and it's i heard a story about that sunday school class and the teacher's taking the subject sister laura the teacher is saying something god has a purpose for everything he created you know he had the cats take care of the mice and the bees they help us get honey and they're going into all these things and one kid pipes up and says well why did god create poison ivy i've probably been asking the same thing i would have also asked what's the purpose in mosquitoes and and so the room was quiet and the teacher couldn't even answer what's the purpose of poison ivy and little johnny pipe something says the purpose of poison ivy is to show us that there's certain things god says and he just wants us to keep our cotton picking hands off of it [Applause] this powerful revelation in that little boy there's certain things god says don't eat of it don't feed on it don't touch it and you just trust and obey come here kylie for there's no other way maybe the person up there will pull this song up for us to be happy in jesus trust and obey for there's no longer to be happy in jesus [Music] his word [Music] [Music] trust [Music] jesus [Music] thank you honey thank you praise the lord that's it [Applause] could it be that the revelation of what we need with all god's given us in the message of the last days could it be it's just as simple as trust and obey trust is he's given us his word [Music] it's just just believe it trust and live by it i hope to get into ruth next time because it was so powerful to see her coming and all she had to do was make decisions keep trusting it trusting me kylie that's what ruth was doing she just trusted and she obeyed and naomi told her she kept doing finally she got to be married to boaz christ she come under the power of redemption and nothing was going to stop us if we trust and obey come on kids come and sing again get up there and sing run run run let's all stand trust and obey for there's no other way to be happy but to trust and oh second verse now shadow don't shake my hand [Music] quickly [Music] you make [Music] [Music] for there's no other way to be happy in jesus but to trust give us the third verse the singing now not a burden [Music] not a sorrow [Music] oh [Music] amen how do you want to trust his come under his head [Music] [Music] praise the lord how powerful that is friends before they sing can we bow our heads and i'll just ask you this morning have you been moved by the holy ghost this morning into some things that you want to take before the lord and after the kids sing you're welcome to come and pray because we're here to pray with you for your christian journey as a believer i don't know what your past has been but i'm trying to preach to you your future okay so if you yield and trust and obey he has a better future for you than he has in
