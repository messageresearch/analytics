========================================

[Music] heavenly father we thank you very much for the wonderful atmosphere that is here lord you're so worthy of praise [Music] [Music] service real real great spirit of worship appreciate that love and i guess i thank everybody for getting out of our comfort zone sitting in a different spot in church and that is a real sacrifice my goodness oh my goodness let's just see if i can get this going here very good oh good well uh just wanted to this last last year we took a series through the to the adult sunday school class on the church age book and i it was probably the greatest blessing to me going through the class myself and i hadn't read the read the book for for years you know i think the it's probably the first the first the feed the the first couple chapters of the books probably the most frequently read chapters because you you you start the year i'm going to get into the to the message more in january one you start reading then you make it through page 40 50 and things come again and next you can try the same so we get through the first chapter quite quite quite a bit but i really enjoyed um making going through the going through the entire book over the course of the year and no probably a lot of us have grown up in the message or been around the message for a long time i was raised in the message and i can remember as you get your teenage years you're kind of wondering yeah i want to start reading it but you all walk into the parents bedroom and it's just like books over shelf upon shelf upon shop like where do i start and i don't think that's the problem that other older generations might not have had that because there weren't so many books available then so you would just get books every every month from from jeffersonville and it wasn't really a big choice which book you read because that was the one you hadn't read yet so you read that and i just um i just wonder my my burden this evening is that if we haven't gotten into the message much ourselves that we just uh take some time and make that a priority because god did send it for a purpose and i can just testify for myself i i can be spending time reading the bible and and and in prayer but in times of drought in my life it's been sometimes that drought has been quenched when i went and gotten to the message more because that's something that god has opened for us to put pieces together and i just encourage you my my burden this evening is that folks my age folks young folks any age if we haven't made that a priority to spend some time doing that that's just that's really what's on my heart and uh my um it's kind of a little bit intimidating for me doing a session like this because yeah you're going to have the brother brother's going to come and teach on the church age book well i'm not the answer man so don't uh i don't think that of myself and don't don't think that of me either at the same time if we uh if as we're going along brother paul said we can structure this a little bit differently if i've been unclear in some way or if a question pops up i'm fine with a hand popping up you might get an i don't know from me but at least we've been honest with ourselves and and asked a question i think there's great value in asking questions because sometimes the devil likes to muzzle us and say you can't ask a question because oh if you ask a question i think oh boy she doesn't believe the message anymore because they've got a question that's not the case at all and there's one one scripture that actually this the setting comes up two times but in exodus chapter 12. i just want to suggest that sometimes god does things purposefully so that we will have questions and i don't think questions are a thing to be run from uh questions might be a god-ordained opportunity to get an answer and in exodus chapter 12 moses is setting out the pattern for how the passover is going to be celebrated he gives all kinds of details and this is not a the evening the passover is being instituted is not a quiet evening everybody is packing they're getting things ready that night they're going to be leaving egypt so they have to listen to moses once and catch it as he's going as fast as he can go but in exodus chapter 12 and verse 26 uh 25 uh 24. the minister always goes all the way back to catch the context right verse 24 ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons forever the passover and it shall come to pass when ye become to the land which the lord will give you according as he hath promised that ye shall keep this service and it shall come to pass when your children shall say unto you what mean ye by the service so it's not a it's not a question of if there will be questions it's a question there will be questions god is doing this in such a way so that there will be questions later on because questions are are an opportunity for parents to explain to their kids why are we doing what we're doing so if you've got a question in your life that might be something that god's put on his calendar and on your calendar for you to learn something more of him so don't run from questions don't think oh i'm not going to read the church book i'm not going to read a message because i'm not going to get it issue i don't understand much at all no go into it because if you don't have if you have a question ask the question that's just uh that's just my real uh real burden sometimes we can be intimidated i'll raise my hand there by some of the teaching series is that brother branham says because they have a reputation for being deep oh i won't have a chance of getting that anyway and that we can dissuade ourselves or even starting to read or to listen because we figured wouldn't understand anything anyhow but i just want to it's interesting in some of those messages that have this reputation for being deep if you look and take a take a read or listen through his introductory prayer there you can capture the simplicity of his desire what he wants to bring it with and on page one of our notes i have his introductory prayer for the revelation of jesus christ series and the church age book came out first as a series of sermons preached in 1960 and then that was in december of 1960 and later brother branham asked for the veil to help put that into uh book form but in the if you if you listen to the series this is this is opening his opening prayer and i love this first line he says may we all not just take this as a lecture because sometimes when you go until this is going to be a teaching service it's not just a lecture brother branham didn't intend it to be a lecture that's not what it was but may we solemnly solemnly take the warnings of the holy spirit and pray day and night don't let nothing stop you from praying so this this teaching it's not less spiritual by any means it's helping us to see the day that we're living in so that we can live in that day correctly now just in respects before we open the book i'd like for all of us who can just to stand for a moment for prayer with the sincerity of your heart breathe a word of prayer to god and he praised lord god the creator of the heavens and earth the author of everlasting life the giver of all good and perfect gifts we would ask you lord first forgive us of all our indifferences and our sins and our trespasses against thee and against one another and our fellow man may this little time of coming together not only be for the edifying of our own souls but may it be to enlighten us in such a way and inspire us till we'll go tell others i just like that he's not saying that we can get more and more he doesn't say it so we'll get more revelation so we'll get so we'll get more knowledge he doesn't say that but so that we can be edified for our own souls and be enlightened so that we'll be inspired to tell others what is it that often prevents us from telling others about what we believe i'd suggest a lot of times because we're not exactly sure what it is either and we're afraid of a question sometimes so as we're being taught what the bible says about these various topics that we can put roots down and then we will be inspired to share what we believe because our questions are answered and our uncertainties might be taken away and then he says may this also be a time of rededication uniting with the full body of christ and being ready for the rapture and i just really appreciated the simplicity of his heart but sometimes we can skip over everything oh we're going to go through a deep service to the book of revelation don't lose the simplicity of the heart i really appreciate that because god's in us god did not send us a theologian as a seventh church h messenger he didn't send us that he sent us a prophet and that helped us capture the heart of god and this evening sermon i don't intend for it to um where there's going to be a church age 101 kind of introduction to the very first chapter and my goal is to kind of hit the hit the highlights of the first chapter so that when you go through it you're when you go through it yourself you'll kind of know which way he's heading already and i hope to be able to answer uh maybe five questions and that's the five w's who what when where and why that's what we're going to try to shoot for this evening to do that let's open up in our bibles to revelation chapter one and we're just going to take a look at the first three verses this evening revelation chapter 1 verse 1. it says the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant john which john is it's this john who bear record of the word of god and of the testimony of jesus christ all the things that he saw this is john the beloved who wrote the gospel wrote the three epistles and in these first two verses we can answer our first question who who's involved right here in the book as we're getting started well the it's jesus christ is the author and it's interesting if you look at the very top of your chapter heading for for the book of revelation different bibles will say it different ways my bible says the revelation of saint john the divine and brother branham goes to great pains in the church age book said no this is not a revelation of john it's the revelation of jesus christ it's not it's doesn't have john's fingerprints on it at all and later well brother branham goes on and says if you were to all that john is is the scribe that's right if you were to contrast the writing style in the book of revelation with the writing style in the book of john or the book of first john 2nd john 3 john it's completely different this book of revelation is only written by the hand of john but it is the thoughts of jesus christ coming out there jesus is the author john's the scribe the interesting part here is in verse the in the end of verse 1 he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant john and there's a third person that we should take a look at here and this is this angel jesus christ is revealing something is revealing him something about himself to john and how is he doing this he's using an angel to do it well what is an angel we've all got some kind of conception in our minds what an angel might be we might see it on the hallmark gift cards with the cupid uh shooting his error with the wings on his back that's one perception of of an angel and of course you have heavenly angels gabriel came down and gave a message to give message to zacharias gave a message to to mary but we shouldn't limit our perception of angels just to those heavenly angels and we should definitely limit it to cupid but an angel all an angel is is a messenger if we take a look in um malachi chapter three let's i don't have this on the side malachi chapter three and we're going to take a look at how the old testament writes something and how the new testament translates it malachi 3 1 this is speaking of john the baptist behold i will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me my messenger here the forerunner is john the baptist now this is written in in hebrew in the original language well the new testament books the gospels might be written in aramaic our english translation is based on the greek manuscript well when we look at the book of mark when mark quotes malachi chapter 3 mark writes as it's written in the prophets in malachi behold i send my messenger well what's the greek word that he uses for messenger it's the word agulos that's the same word for angel the translator put the mess the word messenger there instead of angel but they're it's the same greek word so you could say behold i send my angel john the baptist and he'll prepare the way before me john was an angel in the old testament perception of it so we can't limit our perception of what an angel is just to a heavenly messenger that's sent from the realm of god right to us god uses much more than just that and in the book of james james reference the story of joshua's spies going to visit rahab the harlot and he says likewise wasn't that rahab also justified by works when she had received the aguilos when she had received the the angels and they sent them out another way these were angels sir these were messengers they were bringing deliverance a message of deliverance message of redemption to rahab and they're called angels it's that same word in the greek text and it's just interesting when we look through the book of revelation we're going to see the word angel used many times sometimes it will be referring to a heavenly messenger sent from right from the throne of god but we shouldn't limit ourself to that perception because there'll be many times in the book of revelation where it's an earthly man looks just like us he's just a regular human being and god says that guy right there he's my angel and he's setting up this very same pattern right in verse 1 revealing this whole thing to john the revelator he's using a human being how do we know that well we see this angel come up in revelation chapter 1 and verse 1 and also in revelation 22 at the end of this whole at this whole this whole drama this whole prophecy all these series of visions that john has been allowed to see john is just so overcome in revelation 22 verses 8 and 9 as i john saw these things and heard them and when i had heard and seen i fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which had showed me these things if this angel had been the angel of the lord or had been christ he would have accepted john's worship he doesn't accept the worship of john he says unto me see thou do it not for i am thy fellow servant i am one that i am of thy brethren the prophets of them which keep the sayings of this book so god starts this whole thing oh how the gentile dispensations opened up this whole this new testament age with church ages god starts the whole thing out with an earthly messenger and john's wanting to worship and exalt him to be above that no but i'm just your fellow brethren your your fellow servant of your brethren the prophets i think that's important because this sets a pattern for how god's going to be giving his revelation out throughout the throughout the couple thousand years up to the present the first messenger the first angel sent to john was an earthly messenger and then this can actually continue as an old testament pattern because whenever um the angel of the lord would come and speak to uh yeah to gideon or to manoa or to a different one so noah's wife rather they he came as looked like a regular human being that's how god works and he's continuing that we like to say old testament new testament there might be more continuity than we think sometimes how god works but this that god speaks to this angel to his servant john it signifies that god continues this pattern in the new testament period and specifically what we'll call in the coming months in the in the in the church ages that make sense yes very good um so that hopefully answers our who question who's who who's involved here at the very beginning anyway we have the author of jesus christ the scribe john and then this angel sent to john who's the messenger and what's also really important is that this is a book of prophecy some some theologians will say that the book of revelation all these letters are sent the first couple chapters especially are just sent to local churches in asia minor and for pastors at that particular time to deal with problems in that particular first century church but at the very beginning here john clarifies that or jesus clarifies that forest is verse 3 blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things that you're written therein for the time as a hand so the book of revelation much of it pertains to the future a lot of it does not pertain to events going around at john's time period it's a book of prophecy and that's why we have i believe we have every liberty to believe that brother branham says that the seven church ages that's prophetic of conditions that will be prevailing in the gentile period in the ages to come because it is a book of prophecy the book's also rich in symbols like all the old testament books of the prophets and this is appropriate because it the book is a book of revelation in order to get it we need we're very dependent upon god to unlock the meaning of these particular symbols now here have we a picture of asia minor this is the the seven churches they're approximate locations and brother branham says here that this book of revelation these uh what john's writing here it's directed to those seven churches in chapters two and three and he says there were more churches than those seven at that day but each one of those churches had a characteristic in it that would appear again in the ages to come and that's the purpose of what we're going through in the church age book to look at each of these time periods you'll have well you'll you'll see trends things that they struggle with things that they're doing well that are also cat that that are also found in that local church of ephesus the local church of smyrna the local church of pergamus those conditions can be found also in in future churches and that's why at the bottom of page two brother branham saying that this book of revelation is not the story of john's life but it's the story of christ in future ages it is a prophecy it's not the life of john it's not the life even of christ but it's prophesying of an age to come amen so why is the booklet why is revelation so important and it's not just the book of revelation although it does say in verse three just reading um through the book and hearing it as we are that carries a blessing with itself but why is revelation itself so important now when i was at at college i attended a small school down in springfield ohio i lived on campus there and i'd come back home over the weekends to uh to go to service and oftentimes uh midweek i'd go over to a brother sieverts there in in dayton and i can remember coming back on wednesday night one of my friends there on there in the dorm his uh his question off of me when i came back would be so what did you learn at church today i think what did i learn at church i don't know what i learned at church today because i don't really go to church to learn some new something new i just i haven't really thought about that being the reason why i go to church but it kind of made me think we go not so much to church for information but more for for revelations we see more in god's heart he can speak to us it's not to learn something new necessarily but so we can know someone better and that's what a lot of what revelation is is concerned with now um a lot of times we can think oh i have so little revelation because i understand so little when i hear a message going is a lot of it goes right over my head i have no hope to get much revelation because i didn't learn anything at church tonight i i misunderstood most of it probably i want to go back and think about i'd like this passage from matthew 13. this is where jesus is telling the the mysteries of the kingdom and at the beginning of this jesus speaks to his disciples and he says blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear wow these guys they can see they can hear they understand they get it but if you finish if you continue reading the chapter they probably when jesus says it says amen we're the ones we've got we've got the best understanding we can see this but after jesus's sermon he dismisses everybody else and then they ask the disciples they're just by they're just alone with jesus is it jesus please explain the parable to us because we didn't get it but i said but wait he just said blessed are your eyes for you see in your ears for they hear but they didn't see it they they they had they saw but they didn't see and they heard but they didn't hear what's up with that and i think sometimes we might not understand everything but it's a wonderful revelation to understand that there is something to be understood how many of you see one of those pictures you know there's something in there if you look long enough you'll see you'll see this the picture in the picture and it just kind of transfixes you and you just can't get your eyes away from because you see there's something to be seen and that's i think how it was with the mysteries of the kingdom and the disciples they were listening and listening and listening a lot of people would be listening i can't get anywhere they just walk away they didn't have eyes to see your ears to hear but the disciples they didn't get it either but they didn't walk away because they saw there was something to see and they wouldn't leave until they saw it until god anointed their eyes and they they wouldn't go away from that so revelation doesn't mean you understand everything revelation understands you know where to go to get the understanding that's the important thing and i just love what brother paul had to share last sunday the message here it's not some new doctrine it's not some new thing it's grace grace grace because we need what it has to offer and we might i don't understand a lot of things but i understand this is the source that's where i need to go for it so revelation is just knowing where to go similar to how jesus said in matthew 5 6 blessed are they which you hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled brother branham says you're just blessed for hungering having that hunger carries a blessing with it as well so if you don't understand everything that's fine you're still blessed because you want to understand you have that desire for it because there's a desire that's going to be met somehow absolutely now brother branham takes a lot of the a lot of the material that he covers at the first part of chapter one is um he's speaking from matthew chapter 16. and here again we've talked about questions jesus asks peter a question ask the disciples a question who do men say that i am and then so questions aren't a bad thing here but and then peter gives this answer that you are the christ and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon bar for flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you but my father which is in heaven and i say unto you that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and brother branham uses this text to show how foundational uh how revelation itself is of great foundational importance and here you have the statue of moses there there in rome as michelangelo is working on he catches it just becomes so real to him that he smites it that's revelation has to do with something becoming real to you that's why i like that there brother branham says the importance of revelation by the spirit to a true believer can never be overemphasized revelation means more you than perhaps you realize i'm not talking just about this book of revelation i'm talking about all revelation it's tremendously important to the church why it's because that's a that's a personal connection god's god's showing it to you personally i mean you can go back and i try to work you can try to explain a math problem with somebody math facts everything like that and they they can spit them out they might have haven't memorized when they have to go do a word problem you will tell do they have the revelation that four and four times five is twenty they might not get it once they change but once it's become personally known to you it doesn't matter how the problem changes you've got it because it's become a part of who you are now brother branham talks about this particular text upon this rock i'll build my church and he asks the question on what is the true church built and this is on the um well i'm quoting i'm showing page numbers here i'm using the the new pagination of the church age book which you can actually get in the library we've got a box of them back there um what is the true church built on now the roman catholics say that the church is built upon peter and he says that's really carnal how could you build the church upon a man so unstable that he denied the lord and cursed while doing it god can't build his church upon any man born in sin and it wasn't some rock lying there that that was as though god had hallowed the ground at that spot and this is a little bit odd counterintuitive perhaps and it isn't as the protestants say that the church is built upon jesus now why is that well james 2 19 says the devils also believe in tremble it's not just built upon jesus it's just a small difference it was the revelation jesus isn't saying that hey guys the church is built upon me right now that's right any time that peter got going in that direction saying let's build a special tabernacle for him or keeping the lord from going off and and offering himself in jerusalem don't do that lord get thee behind me said you've missed it you've missed it it's not just built upon me but it's built upon the revelation of of me that's important it was the revelation flesh and blood has not revealed it but my father hath revealed it upon this rock revelation i will build my church the church is built upon revelation on the set lord that doesn't discount at all what what jesus is jesus christ is absolutely foundational to the church but jesus is speaking to peter he's not saying he would build the church on himself it's much deeper here it's on revelation of personal knowledge a personal revelation of who jesus is and it's like the um the devils have that revelation it's oftentimes demon-possessed people recognize who jesus was who paul was before religious leaders ever did the church is built upon the revelation of who jesus is why is it though that revelation is so important brother branham starts this topic at the beginning of chapter one and he kind of and he goes and talks about water baptism he talks about the godhead and at the end of chapter 1 he kind of comes back to it he says he starts talking about how back in the second or third century it's like the whole world was divided by what one group of people thought a particular diphthong met another group of people thought this and they they didn't agree and it was all about the the definitions of of greek words no that's not it it's not based upon human learning it's based upon the revelation of it all that's interesting going back and kind of looking at this why is revelation so important it's by revelation that we see who god actually is who we are and also where we are where are we in god's plan now last year i was um uh two years ago actually i was with my family in the netherlands and we're going back there this spring we're going this is a picture from google maps of a particular area we'll be going and staying for about a week and one afternoon my son had just we visited the uh he's gotten a little army tank and things we're gonna go play soldiers in in the woods it's actually a pretty big woods so we go with uh we go hiking in there and just the two of us and we're having a great time he's playing with his tanks airplanes and all that stuff fun stuff and we go hiking hiking hiking the further we go we just keep following one path then another path another path and after a while i think man i've been gone for two hours i hope i can get back in time because it's going to be about time pretty soon and i want to keep this little guy going not so little anymore but let's go job we're going to see if we can find it i got to realize i've gotten turned around and i'm not really sure how i'm going to get back so yeah what am i going to do there in the middle of the wilderness well fortunately i had my my smartphone with me and unfortunately i already downloaded the google map of that particular i just turned it on and sure enough it showed me where i was but you know when you're lost you can have a map but if you don't know where you are the map means absolutely nothing to you you could be holding it the wrong way and going left and so it'll it'll it'll be a mess and that's the way the bible is to us if we're if we're lost and we don't know where we are we can be doing all kinds of searching but we're not going to get to the right place because we don't know where we're starting from we have to know where we're starting from first and revelation shows who i am who god is and where i am and i need to know that if i want to know if i want to get to where i need to go so this map's critical we did actually we were able to get back home and nobody asked me if we got lost which is even better another point brother branham talks about by it's by revelation that we can identify where satan's at work that's really really uh really important as well i like this quote from the revelation of jesus christ series satan hates revelation he doesn't like it at all because it upsets all his plans because he says if someone has a revelation of who they are of who jesus is the gates of hell cannot prevail against them if they know where they are where they're going yeah it upsets all of his plans because satan loves to keep us in a state of confusion but revelation brings clarity to confusion and satan hates that that's right now on page four of my notes um there's a there's a there's a quote uh just above the middle page uh at the top left it's four it has page 14 paragraph four in the old version he says have you ever noticed how satan hates two books of the bible more than all others through liberal theologians and pseudoscientists he's always attacking the book of genesis and the book of revelations in both of these books we find satan's origin his awful ways and his destruction that is why he attacks them he hates to be exposed and in those books he is exposed for exactly what he is jesus said about satan he has no part in me and i have no part in him the devil would like to prove that different but he can't so all he can do is try to destroy confidence in the word and i just want to point out that is the devil's primary strategy that's right he can't destroy the word he can't destroy god and he really can't destroy you either but if he can just destroy your confidence in the word if you have a question you won't go to the word for the answer to your question you go somewhere else he will take away your knowledge of who you are he can't take away who you are but he can take away your knowledge of who you are he'll take away knowledge of where you are where you should be going he just sows confusion by trying to destroy your confidence in the word and that is man the last decade that is just what the devil's been trying to do here in the ranks of the message well try and destroy the confidence and then the word and i'd like to point out nobody has disproven water baptism in jesus name the oneness of the godhead any of these core doctrines none of that's been disproven but if you're foundationed on the wrong thing oh he's trying to destroy your confidence very much so but he hasn't destroyed the word so don't let the devil destroy your confidence in the word because he can try to put all because you if you get into that you'll lose confidence the word before too long you'll just take a take on the spirit of cynicism a complex of cynicism where nothing is actually good enough you'll read something up that's that comes short here that comes short there that comes right there and you won't have anywhere to go and that might just thank the lord if you can just open our eyes take off that complex of cynicism so that we can have confidence again in the word because that is grace to us god's given it to us but you've got it's like like a little kid on a kid on christmas day there's this there's this wonderful christmas present for him to open but if the devil can get you to think don't open it your dad booby-trapped it's a bomb don't do it if he can get you destroyed confidence in that your greatest gift will be left unopened unused and you're depriving yourself of so much don't let him destroy confidence in the word but notice he keeps going when the church disbelieves satan and believes the spirit's revelation of the word then the gates of hell cannot prevail against her that's why revelation is so important because it knows you tell it tells you who you are who your father is where you're going what power is available to you and then the devil that upsets all the devil's plans he knows who he is he knows what his weapons are he can't take that but he tries to destroy confidence in the word and there's just a couple quotes about revelation at the end of the first chapter that blessed me if revelation's beyond you it's beyond me as well it's beyond all of us if it's beyond us we look up and seek god's for it if we're seeking for revelation we have the promise of the seeker seek and ye shall find ask shall be given knock and it shall be opened you know what it takes a persistent knocking you keep on knocking you keep on knocking you keep on knocking not because god doesn't want one to give but he wants to give his gifts to someone who really really wants it and that's because oh i want to see what's there and oh oh he's not going to give me the first time i really don't care about it that much anyway now sometimes god makes us wait because he wants us to have that value a value that's greater than anything else so don't be discouraged by the weight look up and ask god for that's the only way you're going to get it a revelation has to come from god it never comes by human natural endowments but by spiritual endumid you can even memorize the scripture and though that's wonderful that won't do it it has to be revelation from god and you can find many people who try to approach god in the sincerity of their heart and and through through human study that's not how god works that doesn't mean we just leave the books on the shelf we we we we we seek him but we're not going to be depending upon the wisdom of our own strength to put things together it has to be a revelation from god the next quote says no man knows the things of god save the spirit of god and he'd whom the spirit of god reveals him paul brother bran actually quoting paul there we need to call on god for revelation more than anything else in the world we've accepted the bible we've accepted the great truths of it but it is still not real to most people because the revelation by the spirit is not there it has not been quickened needs to be made alive to us and that's what we can as we we can desire lord make it alive to me make it alive and when that becomes a painful hunger in our hearts oh god will answer that he will make it alive to you amen and that bottom quote on page four it says we'll never get the true meaning of it by study and comparison of scripture as sincere as we may be it's a good thing to do to study but we can't get it in our own strength we have to be humble enough to say lord i'm studying it i can't make heads or tales of it think about the ethiopian eunuch this is a man who is serving a very wealthy queen there in africa and she and he's come to come to jerusalem trying to for some kind of maybe he was bringing some kind of offering i don't know what he was doing as he's coming back he's he's searching through the scriptures i can't get it i'm reading isaiah 53 but i can't get it i don't understand a bit of it and it just drives them nuts but he keeps on reading he keeps on reading i i can't get it then this guy comes he is there's nobody he's never met before comes walking by the chariots and he hears him talking and he's humble enough because he's hungry enough if you're hungry you don't care who the cook is you'll eat whatever they're serving he's hungry enough that this guy he's never seen before comes up he overhears him talking do you understand what you're reading no i don't understand he asked these little fourth graders or fifth graders or six years in class you guys getting it yeah we got it we got it let's we try to do that sometimes we all got it but we if we say we got it we don't we don't get the answers but he was hungry enough he was honest enough he got answers then it'll take a revelation from god to bring it out and at the end there the highlighted portion make no mistake about it we have the infallible word of god today no man there's take from it or add to it but we still need the same spirit that gave and teach it to us just like we have i had the map in front of me but if i didn't know where i was it wasn't going to help me i need the holy spirit to show me that how we need revelation by the spirit we don't need a new bible we don't need a new translation sometimes that's the hope that that a lot of evangelicals have got this new bible translation it makes it so much clearer and yes that can help some but that's not gonna that's not gonna put all the puzzle pieces together for it you have to have the revelation of the spirit you have to have that amen your brother we have to have a revelation of of what god's doing what what what what his plan is brother branham and the message christ is the mystery of god revealed he he's talking about how god has revealed this plan it can be seen in every type that's in the bible the entire bible he says is the revelation of god's mystery in christ the entire bible is an expression of one goal that god had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire bible and i like this kind of going back to what we said you can study and study and study and you can get knowledge of all the different greek parts of speech and all the all the different verb forms know all that kind of thing you'll get some benefit from it i'm sure but it's not going to put all the puzzle pieces together the same way that having a prophetic ministry comes through and shows the whole bible is talking about the one plan studying the original languages that's not going to that's not going to do it for you you have to have revelation once you see that that's why i think revelation is also important it can make the entire bible meaningful unto you in ways that personal study are insufficient to do and i just like and i think i this i think this illustration of the uh of the onion i think it comes from cs lewis how every layer then you just peel it back and it's layer upon layer upon layer of truth as you go on with god you just walk further every layer is just like infinite infinitely layered just keep going on and on honestly layers and layers of layers of of meaning as you get more intimate with with with christ and that's how it is with the bible when we have revelation that shows types and shadows you're going to be seeing it brings multiple levels of meaning throughout the scripture and the example that brother branham uses in chapter 1 of the church age book is the life of joseph in joseph's life man if this guy had a tough life but he had no idea as he was going through all his trials and tribulations very few of any of which he actually deserved he had no idea that god was actually doing something supernatural in his life he didn't know it he didn't i don't know that he saw god's hand there but um in joseph's youth you know he had those those those dreams that uh and and he saw where his family would be bowing down before that was shown multiple times and two two or three witnesses shall something be established this dream just repeated different ways what it all meant he didn't know right he didn't know but he still held on to the belief that it meant something so like again bless your eyes for they see your ears for they hear he couldn't explain what it all meant but he knew they meant something so he hid it in his heart and he can and he held fast to it and you can imagine as joseph went through all of his tribulations he's being betrayed by his brothers he's being betrayed by his by his trusted employer and then he's being forgotten by this by this prisoner he had done so much for to get out of jail he's been forgotten again and again and again what do you think the devil was trying to destroy his confidence in saying ah those james but nothing those dreams nothing god has no plan for your life joseph he's forgotten all about you he was trying to destroy his confidence in the very word that was for joseph that god had spoken to him that's what the devil was trying to destroy but all that time when it seemed that absolutely nothing was happening in joseph's life god's hand was there god's fingerprints were all over joseph's life and look at ourselves in the mirror sometimes think god you're doing nothing in my life right now we can feel that way sometimes i don't see anything going on well god's fingerprints are still all over us he's working with us his hand is busy in our life all the time it seemed that nothing was happening in his life the word of the lord was trying smelting refining him and also revealing himself in ways that joseph could never imagine there are lots of types and shadows joseph's brothers hated him betrayed him just like the jewish religious leaders hated jesus and handed him over to the romans joseph didn't realize but he had the the great privilege of shadowing all of christ's tribulations and blessings later both joseph and christ were accused falsely and unjustly convicted there with with with potiphar's wife for example uh jesus christ is is hung between two thieves and one is granted life the other is not and just like joseph is the same thing he has two fellow prisoners there and the butler and here's an example of how how revelation gonna bring it to life to us the the butler is someone who who brings wine to the pharaoh and wine is something that brother the scripture talks about wine it's never gonna it's it's alive it's not it's going to get better with age this wine is not going to perish and die it's going to get better with age the butler goes back to his position and and the wines like the blood of christ that's that's how we get life but the but the baker he's working with bread and the and the and jesus christ body was was broken there on the cross and just like the communion breads broken for us that had the the the baker he's he was going to get broken that's what his his whole occupation was was typing it was one just like the thieves on the cross one prisoner went back got his jaw back the other one the other one died both joseph and christ were exalted with from the unjust condemnation to the right hand of the throne all this is this is very similar than both joseph and christ take a gentile bride these are similarities and even um you see it in the genesis chapter 48 when joseph brings his two sons to um to to jacob to be to be blessed joseph's bringing the the eldest son on his right side and his youngest son they're on the left side as he's doing that he's wanting his dad to anoint with the right hand on the elder son that left on the youngest son but his dad in the middle of this ceremony that joseph has been looking forward to the dad crosses his hands and puts his right hand upon the younger son has left him on the older side and joe says dad dad you're messing everything up because he's the oldest he should get the right hand blessed he's no son god crossed my hands and brother brandon points out that that's important because when you cross your hands what do you get you get a cross and that just shows how the blessings of the cross the cross makes the blessings of of god available to the to the to the gentile and not just to the jew and all this it becomes meaningful not by study but by revelation god puts those pieces together and you can read about them in the church age book pages 35 and 36 it's really beautifully described there and even the restoration of 144 000 jews is woven to the fabric of joseph's life because joseph's younger brother benjamin he types hundred forty four thousand jews this is his special brother he reveals himself to the special brother while the gentiles are away there in the palace this is such a special time so joseph's life of some so many odd decades has a meaning in so many odd decades of joseph's life an explanation that spans millennia is packed into there and you only can see that by revelation study is not going to bring it out but revelation does i just love this that joseph's life there were prophecies about his life that were that were spoken over him there at the beginning through these dreams but all these prophecies were locked up until the time that his word came and i'm quoting here from psalm 105 and i really love i love this psalm um this is talking about how god psalm 105 talks about how god was dealing with the jews in the old testament and verse 16 says he called for a famine upon the land he break the whole staff of bread there in canaan but verse 17 he sent a man before them even joseph who was sold for a servant whose feet they hurt with fetters he was laid in iron until the time that his word came so the devil could have him there in iron and fetters but only for so long the devil could not do that intermittably only for so long because once it was time for that word to be fulfilled nothing could keep joseph in that prison absolutely nothing and this doesn't this revelation on the personal level doesn't just apply to joseph because there are scriptures that are spoken about us as well if you seek you shall find that's spoken about you and if you seek you seek you seek there's a promise you will find the devil might have you locked up on irons locked up in chains he can only hold you there for so long because there's a promise when you seek you will find and you will be released you will be delivered you'll have that revelation granted to you until the time that his word came he wasn't rotting in jail until the time that his word came the word of the lord tried him god is dealing with him the entire time he's not god never wastes suffering god never wastes your time he's always dealing with us in some special way until the time this word came to the time that that god's time is for to reveal himself to you he's dealing with you until that time satan can have you for so long but he is not the boss of our lives by any means just above that in the notes on page five there's a quote this is where brother branham's talking about how the um the truth of water baptism the godhead that was um was was uh was was lost but it says right up until the truth was lost about water baptism in jesus name and that truth did not return to this last stage that's from nicaea to the turn of this century until that time that it was lost they baptized the name of the lord jesus christ but it has come back why because satan can't keep the revelation down when the spirit wants to give it he can't keep it down and the spirit wants to give us so that's when i if we see the spirit of god moving whether it hear it here in the service or if you see if god's moving in your car as you're driving somewhere wherever god's moving make that a priority because god speaking to you is the greatest blessing that we have absolutely absolutely this is revelation on a personal level just just in closing here um here we have a block of granite taken out of some granite quarry in italy and we see absolutely nothing there to me i'd almost mistake it for a big block of styrofoam but it's it's a block of beautiful white granite i wouldn't know what i could do about it do do do with it and that's how we look at ourselves sometimes i just see a big piece of dirt that even look good anymore god but god sees something bigger there special there i like this quote of michelangelo he says i saw the angel in the marble and i carved until i set him free. he see something in there that nobody else saw god sees something in you that you might not see and you can be trapped in that marble only for so long you can stay trapped in there only for so long because when it's time for that word to come god's going to be chiseling he's going to be hammering he's going to be buffing he'll be polishing to bring you out of there and here's a here's a picture of a statue that's still in progress this is one of michelangelo's there's a series of statues that he didn't finish it's called the prisoners you can see him in florence can you see i can't wait to be free i want to be free i just can't wait keep working on me oh god and just keep chiseling chiseling hammering away and then when at that time he's done and you are free everything that's not that angel has been shut off from the marble and you can look at yourself in this manner who am i i'm not the marble that's broken all around me that's not me i'm this finished product who do i look like i look like the one who is chiseling me who is sculpting me because i made in his image that's what revelation does on a personal level showing us who we are who god is that god is working in ourselves the entire time he will never leave you nor forsake you he never will he's working in you the entire entire time amen musicians can come i'm i'm pretty much finished here we can just finish with one with one scripture verse first timothy chapter four and this is just uh that's my word of encouragement timothy was a uh was a young man and paul's writing uh these letters to timothy from from from prison so you can imagine as paul's writing them uh timothy is treasuring them because he doesn't know will this be the last word that i received from paul and i just verse 12 and to the end of the chapter mean a lot to me especially as we consider what was kind of my um what's been my burden going through this that we could get ourselves rooted and grounded and what our foundation really should be the word of god and verse 12 says let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of the believers in word and conversation and charity and spirit and faith and purity and say let no man despise your youth no you despise it either sometimes we think oh i'm a i'm a young person i'll never understand it anyway we have that thought we're despising our own youth don't do that let no man despise your youth what is paul's advice here he says verse 13 till i come give attendance to reading to exhortation to doctrine neglect not the gift that's in thee which is given thee by profit with the laying on of hands of the presbytery what should we be doing meditate upon these things give yourself holy to them that thy profiting may appear to all take heed to yourself under the doctrine continue in them for in doing this you'll both save yourself and them that hear thee and that just be my my encouragement to you if you if you've said uh i've been wanting to get into the message at some point but i've never really made time for i think why not start make time for it because it is the grace of god to you and whatever level god's ready to reveal it to you he'll he will reveal it to you ask him for revelation he'll put the pieces there so there's a lot of times with what we're doing as we're as we're reading or listening we're just putting puzzle pieces into our heart and they're just kind of rumbling around in there and we can try to put them together but if we if we never put the pieces into our heart god doesn't have those in our heart to put together in the first place so put them there then he will put them there in the right spot in time so i just just encourage you don't be afraid of questions don't be afraid of the message because it's god's grace for us amen let's pray heavenly father we thank you very much for your goodness and your grace to us lord i thank you for what you've given us here and the inspiration that is there lord it just quenches quenches our earth thirst father lord i pray for each person here today that as we might even tonight or tomorrow open our bible open the message book father lord i pray that it started becoming a new book to us we might start seeing where we at where we're at in the drama of your story we might better see who you are and who we are i just kind of think lord is that opening message opening prayer brother branham that lord may this time that we spend in your word not just be for the edifying of our own souls that may enlighten us in such a way and inspire us to will go tell others lord may this time in your word just be a time of rededication uniting all of the full body of christ together we'll be ready for the rapture i pray you bless each one lord in jesus name amen [Applause] wonderful teaching tonight thank god for it i appreciate it so much you can never over emphasize brother graham said the importance of revelation to the believer and he said this after that revelation the most important thing because it's personal between you and god it's completely out of the other realms of information and learning so totally everything quiet because it's personal between you so i don't have anything to add tonight i just wanted to say i wasn't supposed to get up but sister lindsey you've got that box of church ages books back there right you have some extras so if you want to get one tonight can you open the office the library and so um we'll open the office and you can get one i don't know how much they are but if you get it pay for it if you can't just get it and pay them later or whatever or take it now pay for it because i want you to have your own copy if you don't have one take the next month and start studying this together with brother wrap and his his notes some of you have them tonight we send them to your phones or we send them an email how do we send them brandon hopefully you get to the phones by text and then the powerpoint is available as well so we'll have those available you can follow all right along in the teaching but one of the things brother rap said in the office tonight says my emphasis tonight was really me is to to get get the church church facebook and read it and get into it yourself if you haven't yet and even though the subject was revelation he wanted to emphasize why because satan destroys the confidence of this of what god's given us and so to go to counter that we'll just get into it and find out for yourself and find out what the word says wonderful praise the lord come on brother joe lead us in a couple of courses before we go tonight and uh so if you can open that lindsey and anybody wants to get a church aide book tonight and pay for it if you can't pay for it tonight then get it another time because i want you to take one home and then another thing too is if they wanted to order their own you've got a few weeks to do it get the address out of that new church book and it'd be believers international and give that address and you can order one yourself online i think it's believers international doc dot com or dot org george smith put this one out can i see that brother and there's the ones we have in the back this is of course more expensive leather copy um i don't know if i have one of these wrap has one but anyway uh but they have those you can order and then um they have the other ones but it's the same thing george smith redid re-paragraphed re-paragraph it into some different things it's really easy to read wonderful wonderful books so get one tonight if you don't have one and remember the powerpoint the teachings you can print them out bring them with you and
