[0:00] [music]
[0:04] or mountains and [singing] valleyies.
[0:07] 11 at night,
[0:10] a star of most radant light.
[0:16] The wise [music] men rejoiced [singing]
[0:18] as they journeyed a far to behold
[0:23] [music] such a beautiful smile.
[0:28] [music]
[0:32] Yes, others saw the star, but they
[0:35] [music and singing] followed it not.
[0:38] To them it would come and would pass.
[0:43] [music and singing]
[0:44] But wise men kept trusting
[0:47] with all [singing] of their heart that
[0:50] the star would find the baby at
[0:53] [music and singing] last.
[0:56] And when they saw the star, they rejoice
[1:01] with great joy.
[1:03] When they saw the star, they
[1:06] [music and singing] rejoice.
[1:09] When they saw the star, they [music]
[1:12] rejoice with great joy. They rejoice
[1:15] [singing]
[1:16] with exceeding great joy. [music]
[1:19] [singing]
[1:26] Oh,
[1:30] so long [music] I had traveled [singing]
[1:33] in darkness of night
[1:36] with [music] no one to show me [singing]
[1:39] the way.
[1:42] But one day the Lord let his [music]
[1:46] light shine on me. And now I'm walking
[1:50] in his [singing] love every day.
