Sharon we're so excited for your news so when we have um at little Co-op at home when we have um Bible class the children have prayed for you every single day and I can't wait to go back and tell them the wonderful news of your healing and so this song is um it's not a Christmas song but sister Sharon has done this she's cast her bread upon the Water for all her life and it's coming back to [Music] you I cast my bread on the Water by helping my brother struggling on my stormy seas and I'll be so in a good SE by doing a good deed that'll come back come back to me well I picked up the good book and took me a long look I believed in each and every part but I sure rejoiced and KN about the reing and the sewing I really took that lesson to my heart my bread upon the Water by helping my brother struggling on life stormy SE I'll be so a good SE I do a good deed that'll come back come back to me well I can't find my way to heaven but there's a heaven waiting purchased by our good and Ling Lord and I'll go on a striving trusting and surviving holding on expecting my reward press my bread upon the Water by helping my brother struggling on like stormy SE I'll be so in a good seed by doing a good deed that'll come back come back to me I gas my bread upon the Water by helping my brother struggling on life stormy SE I'll be so a good see but do it a good deed that'll come back come back to me and I'll be so in a good SE do a good de that'll come back come back to [Music] me praise the Lord amen well you may be see the come on bring Harper up here Harper and [Music] Hatfield oh my beautiful beautiful I wanted to read this just one scripture here and I think it fits um it says in Ephesians chapter 3 and verse 20 unto unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we can ask or think according to the power that worketh in us and the reason I'm re reading that is I was thinking last night how that and I don't want to answer for You Phillip and I I don't want to answer for you either but it would seemed to me that in some ways maybe brother Phillip never thought that this would happen it happened this glorious in this way a wife great wife Godly wife and then and then this as a bonus and I just think probably there were times I didn't counsel with you talk to you too much but there were times probably you didn't really you might lost hope that it could be this good but you're serving a God that can do exceedingly and abundantly whatever we could pray or ask or think and we're thinking at a certain level God can blow that away and I just really believe for you and for Tabitha I think he's done that with your marriage and those who are a tad older don't give up God is able to do exceedingly abundantly can you say amen and so this is precious time this morning to be able to dedicate this Harper so only names meanings you guys might know something different but Harper is one who plays the harp right and that's beautiful that's wonderful because Kenny and I want to see an orchestra started and we realize nobody's coming around around to play some extra except our dear sister Grace playing the violin now she does a wonderful job do you enjoy her violin CL but we want a whole Orchestra we want to fill in the whole front and we realize nobody's stepping for where we can't find anybody so we're just going to start birthing them for the orchestra instruments start breeding no I don't want to say breeding them but so I don't know I'm not putting that on her that pressure but her name is Harper so start the lessons right away Harper and Hatfield our Precious Jesus how wonderful this is Lord to see how you blessed brother philli and Lord the ups and downs through the years and serving you there's been been a faithfulness in our brother to hold on to the truths of the message of this last day and to hold on to you and then you prospered his business and you prospered many things in his life but just missing that counterpart that that helpmate and then Lord you send this gift to both of them this precious child so Lord they bring her today back to you we Place Harper back in your hands for your love love for your protection for your guidance for when you're not when when they're not around you would be around with her guardian angel to watch over her and when she comes of age I pray that you would put such a heart in her Lord to want to serve you and love you and may there not be a lot of hurdles and things Lord that she has to get over thankfully Lord she'll be raised in a home that has some respect and a lots of respect for the word of God and for for the token if what what and so if Harper would grow if you should T and she should grow into her young years and grow as an adult she'll have a good start Lord to be in the presence of God and to bring in a home that has your presence so bless her be with her Lord protect her and we give her back to you and ask that you bless her and put your anointing upon her and also upon philli and Tabitha that you would help them to be good parents Lord to watch over her and give her guidance that Lord when we don't know what to do in child wearing which many times we don't Lord and the only manual we have is the Bible which is really all we need but there are times Lord we just don't feel like we know what to do give them wisdom give them leadership give them instruction and anoint them by the Holy Ghost Lord to care for this child in a special way we commit their home to you today and their lives to you continue to bless and prosper them in always and we ask it in Jesus name for your glory [Music] amen beautiful guys beautiful wonderful good job we love you guys praise the Lord amen praise the lord we appreciate you giving us patience to work through some of these things yeah I was just looking for my Bible praise the Lord amen don't forget the concert this afternoon if you wanted to bring visitors you're welcome to bring and then next Sunday brother Nathan Bryant will be with us to speak from uh Jeffersonville Indiana can we stand together thank you thank you for your patience to get through some of these things and I'd like to turn this morning to 2 Corinthians chapter 5 my sister Sharon's week that had this week has been a week of rejoicing for our family and for the bride of Christ and to see all those who prayed around the world we want to thank you all publicly and also the children the Sharons that influenced so many of them through the years even our sister Rachel talking about her U Gathering there children and praying for her every day and so God has answered in a great way and we appreciate him bringing this healing and she wanted to get up this morning and share but we're going to let her do that tonight in the concert she's going to share from her heart What the Lord Has Done amen 2 Corinthians chapter 5 and verse one for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were disolved we have a building of God a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens for in this we Gran earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from Heaven if so be being clothed we shall not be found naked for we that are in this Tabernacle do groan that's the second time that word has been mentioned here groaning for we who are in this Tabernacle this body do groan being burdened not for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God who also hath given unto us the earnest of his spirit amen may God bless his word this morning and we just ask you as we pray together would you remember uh prayer request here uh pray for brother Ron Peterson from Phoenix the pastor that is in the hospital with pneumonia influen uh influ the flu and also rib fractures so let's remember brother Ron now Heavenly Father we just take this pre prayer request before you our dear brother Lord as a pastor there in Phoenix we pray that you'll lift him up father we pray you'll bring healing speedily to his body touch him Lord I pray and bring him back lord in the ministry so he can be faithful there feeding the flock we just pray that you touch his body Lord and be with him we pray you'll bless the word this morning as we enter in in Fellowship around it may you touch Every Soul that's under the sound of our voice and may there be another Voice besides mine that the people hear and that are called to the voice of Jesus Christ we commit the service to you today and all these things the baby dedication and this evening Lord as we welcome the visitors coming in and the different ones the children singing May there be such an anointing on the music Lord that Hearts will be drawn closer to you we commit it to you father and we ask it in Jesus name amen and amen God bless you you may be seated I want to welcome Bill and Maddie here this morning visiting God bless you good to have you in our uh service this morning God bless you today I want to finish uh a series that we've been on on the Holy Ghost and uh I'm just trusting that some of the things we've broke down to the people through this series uh has been a blessing to you and uh it's been instructional it's been helpful for you to be able to understand just a little bit more of what this great truth is it's been a wonderful Journey for me to be able to take many of the Bible truths that's related to the subject of the Holy Ghost and to take those truths it's just been a great journey to take them piece by piece and to be able to understand a little better and there's something that I said in the first service in this series and that was that I I had a a a desire in my heart to be able to break this down so that we could take something that has become confusing to the people and we realize that if something like the Holy Ghost has become confusing then we know that's Satan's work say God is not the author of confusion but it's Satan that's the author of confusion and what greater subject that to take something so precious as an intimate connection with God that someone is filled changed transformed converted however you want to call it by the holy ghost in a new birth what greater subject what greater thing would Satan like to interrupt in your life and then after you have it what greater subject would Satan like to confuse you about make you you doubt that you have it can you say Amen it would be this subject but I want to say it again my desire was to bring it so that it's not confusing but it's expressed just the way it is in the scripture can you say amen and and and and to be able to preach it in a way uh that that your heart would so want it if you don't have it that that you would want it with all your heart and it would be a fool it would be a fool that would turn down the filling of the Holy Ghost that's the way that I wanted to preach it because uh it I it's something that we all uh not only just need but something we should crave for and ask God for it can you say Amen it's not something to be grieved but it's something to be received it's not something to be put off but it's something that must be a priority right now it's something so powerful to change you and to change your desires to bring the love of God and incidentally God gives you the Holy Ghost by a love for it and a passion for it by the love of God he doesn't give you something out of fear can you say Amen it's it's not about fear I better get this or I'm going to go to hell it's it's not that it's because you fall in love with God and he he he gave you his gift of the Holy Ghost and you say he's given me this I want it with all my heart that's the way we should look at it and Satan should never change that there's something so powerful in it and it's the love of God not out of fear but out of relationship that we would want it and so if you are uncertain that you will be in heaven today if you are uncertain that you will be in the Rapture and and you want the assurance that you will be in heaven and be in a Rapture then why are you not seeking the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is the guarantee that you will be in a Rapture the Holy Ghost is the only guarantee that you will be in a rapture see I want the evidence of it I want the EV I want to know that I have it but what's the purpose you say if you want an Evidence and you want a guarantee having it in your soul is the guarantee that you will be a part of a Rapture praise the Lord last Sunday we uh we referred to 2 Corinthians chapter 5 because we were referring to the mystery of our Eternal bodies and that is our theophanies that would be the more technical word but uh the uh the Bible calls it here our Earthly House of this body and then the Heavenly Eternal house the body and maybe we didn't know that when we first come to Christianity but the Bible plainly states here we're in our Earthly house now but we have another body in the other dimension just real close to us if we are Christians and we are in his mind before the foundation of the world we already have an eternal body in the other dimension how many believe that and that's not some new weird idea Paul just said if this Earthly Tabernacle is dissolved for Christians we have a body already waiting for us that will take up it's an eternal body it's a word body it loves the word it never gets sick it never gets a migraine headache it never has any trouble it agrees with the word of God because it's a perfect word body the body that you're in now is not that way but the Christians get a new body praise be to God and so we were under the mystery of MDC in the book of hrew Hebrews under the mystery of mzc we find this truth of the theophany bodies that Jesus had a theophany body or else who was MDC who had no beginning of days nor ending of life it had to be Jesus Christ and he's still alive today can you say man he was in a theophany body and came into a flesh body there to talk and commune with our Father Abraham this mystery explains the mystery of our life The Secret Of Our Lives because we're dropping down here in a moment of time but we came from from somewhere and we're headed somewhere we're only here temporarily to live in these bodies but we we can say the same thing that Jesus day did I come from God I'm here in this Human Experience but I'm going right back to God again this Christian life isn't just for here there's a destination to this thing there's a place the Holy Ghost is in us someday and so I thought the last part of the Holy Ghost we should talk about where it's taking us and incidentally not just in this life in maturity but where it's taken us into the other dimension and there's only one p there's only one ticket that you have to hold in your heart to make it into that other dimension and that's the Holy Ghost pretty important young people it's pretty important it's more important than your career it's more important than who you marry it's more important than your job more important than your your what's on your phone more important than in some crazy latest movie or crazy latest song this is the priority of your life that I know that I know that I know that I have the Holy Ghost I have this in my heart and I'm ready to go and only you can pray that prayer to God only you can receive it I can't give you that I can preach it to you I can I can love you but you have to ask God and anyone who asks I believe that they will receive one of the points I don't want to miss out of this text first before I jump on to the rest of it and that is that this thing if this if this life is in US of the Holy Ghost we groan he uses the word twice we groan within ourselves now that's that's not a great sales pitch to The Holy Ghost to tell you when you're going to get this there's going to be some groaning and he uses the word we are oppressed or we are burdened with carrying this life that's not a great sale uh to try to sell it on but I can tell you there's a groaning that goes with it because he said here we if you have this life in these bodies you're groaning about something you're it brings a groaning now we know that it brings Deliverance it brings a change of nature we've preached on it brings an amen or to the word of God that if you have the Holy Ghost you'll never deny this word not not one book of this Bible not one scripture of this Bible and the message that restored this Bible you say well how do I know that I have it it's not a feeling it's not a sensation it's not an emotion because you felt good at Camp it's that you've got the amener on the inside that when God brings his word something down here says amen every time you can't even live this Christian Life without the Holy Ghost to say Amen to the word of God we've talked about the evidence we've talked about the blessings of the Holy Ghost that go with it and and we we talked about the change of nature but I I if you think this Christian life is all peaches and blessing and good and shouting all the time and dancing then you need to listen to Wednesday night service and some of you didn't because I can tell by your response and I'm not pushing but God brought something very unique to us on a little Wednesday night here that this experience will have times that God is dealing you with you with his left hand and not his right and when he deals with it his with his right hand you know that he's dealing with you and it's great and he shows his power but when he's dealing with you with his left hand which he was job there was no answers God had gone silent and you don't have a clue what's going on but that's when you need to trust God's still working a brother told me in the bathroom this morning that's actually where we get the real growth in Christianity it's when God's dealing with this with a left hand he told me that in the bathroom this morning should listen to Wednesday night because this Christian life is not all peaches and blessing there's a groaning and but you see now the groaning isn't a negative thing it's not just worldly oppression and depression that we feel because of the de demonic spirits that we fight in our mind every day we are we are this the atmospheres are saturated with depressing uh Devils all the time especially for Christians depressing oppression and so we're we're I'm not talking about that type of groaning or oppression or burden I'm talking about these bodies that are that are sin born they become Born Again In the soul but when you put another life in these bodies you are going to experience a groaning and the groaning is is that this really isn't the final body to put that life in so there are certain elements to it that just don't fit this body it doesn't match it doesn't go together we're talking about the very life eternal life placed in a human body and that's not going to always go together so well the only thing that it will do is be powerful enough as you yield to the spirit to bring this body under subjection to God but it'll never be born again it'll never make the Rapture it'll never go anywhere else it's sinb born can you say Amen but you put the very life of God that created the world in this body you're going to be groaning a little bit and sometimes you're wondering what in the world's going on with me I just feel a pull I feel a pull that's why I can sing Brother Paul's song I Feel the pull because I don't know what's going on but I I I feel drawn to something else I feel pulled towards God I feel this is not the end there's more to this it's because God put his own life inside of you and this body is never going to fully agree it's not going to fit well because this is not the body was intended to be in well it was in God's plan but it's not the final end it's not the final end so these groanings reminds me of a a woman that's pregnant and I'm not an expert at this but I I live with my wife during these times and I watch women who become pregnant and there's there's such Joy with it there's such great expectation to it uh what could this be am I going to have a boy or a girl and then sometimes you can go find out that kind of kills feels it because you already know what you're getting but there's still expecting now I'm going to get a boy or I'm going to get a girl wow now I can know how to uh decorate the room and so there's this there's these feelings of expectation that come inside a woman that's pregnant and the whole family and even dad but especially for the woman who's carrying this other life within her that's Joy it's great expectation of what's going to come in nine months or eight months or sometimes 10 months so you know it just it never you never know but but then you're going to have feelings come with that that's inside you it's going to kick that baby's going to kick sometimes and Fe for a woman to feel that kick that's a joy that's that's wonderful it's there it's alive there's some other uh something another life growing inside me and I feel it kicking against my tummy I mean my wife she had a lot of kicking I mean we we have some basketball players my boys are basketball players and I think they were already playing basketball and so you know we have all this goes go that goes with it but also for a woman there's a groaning there's pain and as she gets closer could be more pain how many sisters say Amen that happens more groans you're you're becoming more uncomfortable so now that doesn't sell well either for you know I'm staying away from this I'm not doing it because I've heard women talk about what it gets to at the end and the final birth pains and the final in the hospital it's going to happen and uh so you can talk to the sisters I mean this gets it gets to be more birth pains as it gets closer to this life cutting the umbilical cord and this life that's not supposed to stay in that woman's body but to take on a life it's of its own there's a lot of groaning there's a lot of pain just before that happens I wonder this morning if that's what Christians feel especially in these La I wonder how close we are to the Rapture I wonder with all the pain that we're feeling all the struggles all the trials in the last year for our family it's been a very very rough time we're not going anywhere we're we're we're dead more dedicated to the Lord than we ever have but we've had a little bit of the left hand of God where you don't understand what God is doing but I can tell you there's groaning there's pain there's things that we don't understand I wonder if we're how many would raise your hand and say I'm feeling that more than I ever I wonder if we're close to the Rapture I wonder if this life is growing inside of us and we're really close for the change cuz that's what a woman comes to when she comes to that and you've heard me mention it before all the Cravings that go with it some babies they crave this some there's Cravings that go that aren't your normal Cravings you crave this you crave that but when you got a it's because you have another life inside of you and they maybe don't crave the same things you crave but you're feeling those Cravings you got the Holy Ghost inside of you you're going to Crave the things of God where before the Holy Ghost you didn't crave them you're going to be craved to be fed by the word of God you're want to you're going to want to be where the the the word is being preached can you say Amen it's not a duty it's not some ritual it's not a Catholic idea there's the Holy Ghost Inside saying I've got to be fed there's something in me I've heard my from my theophany something's craving to be in church today to hear the word of God she had cravings for green beans she had craving one of my my wife's Childs for seafood it was Seafood constantly every week we were at Red Lobster we were at home it was Seafood but as I've mentioned to you one of my kid I don't know which one of my kids but it was she craved hot fudge cake from Big Boy and that was great brother Chris that was great cuz soon as she would Express that craving I'd start the car we were headed a big boy and she couldn't finish all of it so I had to do my duty to finish the rest of the hot fres cake could it be that we're hitting more pain more family issues yeah because we're closer to something taking place than what we realize there's a groaning that goes with this spirit and maybe that's why we increase in pain getting closer you know the world is getting ready for its third birth pain it had one world war had the second war war those were birth pains as far as this world it's getting ready to have its third one it can't survive another one this Earth has to break into another Millennium another life another God purging this Earth we can't survive another third world war it's coming even Trump says it's coming we're very close to it but I don't know we can't survive it why because we're closer to a new world breaking forth and so maybe that's why the pain is increased to bring us into that new world but also for us who are groaning in the spirit what is what is groaning mentioned for because the same reason that a woman groans another life is in you that life was never meant to stay in these bodies it will keep growing to break into another body so we grow it means that the Holy Ghost will never perfectly fit this imperfect body so that's why we have groanings why you feel the pull of something it's pulling you it's drawing you thus we Gran within ourselves it's actually a good thing so then uh Paul mentions here that this life is in within us is called the earnest it's mentioned that way about three places in scripture also in the book of Ephesians it's the earnest which which we see described it's pretty simple to describe what the earnest is when you receive the Holy Ghost you receive the earnest which is not all of it you receive the down payment and when you have a down payment of something then it's already yours you just don't have the rest of it yet but it's been paid for can you say Amen the Bible calls the Holy Ghost the earnest the down payment so God puts a down payment of his spirit in these bodies it is the down payment it's as good as done the it's already purchase so a down payment of course is the evidence and the security that we will get the rest this is just a portion that we have and oh this morning we've come and worshiped the the the we've worshiped the Lord with all of our heart and the spirit of the Lord comes down and how many's enjoyed the worship this morning expressing oursel to God and the musicians and everybody expressing themselves if it's this good with just the down payment how much is it going to be when we get to the other side I'm enjoying this but I can't wait till we get to the other side but it's a down payment brother Ram says we are pre predestinated with the lamb Revelations chapter 5 we are predestinated with the lamb the holy spirit is our seal the earnest means more is yet to come I love that the earnest the down pay payment means more is yet to come there's more to come you're not done when he fills you with the Holy Spirit there's more to come he says the earnest is just the down payment oh how beautiful just the down payment that holds it and secures it and anchors it so that no one else can touch it Satan cannot get a hold of a man or a woman that's been birthed by the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is sealed in his soul and the devil has been sealed out and we are sealed not till the next Revival we're sealed until the day of redemption with this down payment it's a ceiling it anchors it it holds holds it this down payment even holds it it anchors it can you say Amen it it is there's nothing else can touch it it's the earnest of our adoption the holy spirit is now the earnest of God in our heart sealed the adoption of sons awaiting us at the end of the road Sons and Daughters of God so now in redeeming something we know that when there's something to be redeemed it was yours and then it got lost some something took it away from you then it has to be redeemed and when you go to redeem it back there has to be a price with that Redemption you have to pay something our lamb Jesus Christ paid the full price to redeem what he had lost he lost us and we lost our inheritance and our lamb Jesus Christ went to Calvary and at Calvary he paid the price in full so it's already yours every every bit of redemption to redeem you to redeem Sons and Daughters of God to redeem this Earth everything was paid for at Calvary he paid the full price with his sacrifice at Calvary how many believe that this morning so he redeemed it back but you see now there's a difference in redeeming and paying something and claiming what's yours because you may have paid the price but you haven't come to claim it yet there's a there's a claiming time and so our inheritance is getting back what we lost in the Garden of Eden we are are his and the position as the son is ours and he buys it back but because is everybody listening now because there will be a season as we said last Sunday we bypassed our theophany and came right to the flesh to be tempted Jesus didn't bypasses theophany he came from word from thought of God to to from thought of God to word theophany and then to a flesh body to redeem us we come another way we came from the thought of God straight to these bodies to be tested and then we go back to a theophany body that's all scriptural can you say Amen so now that that he he buys it back but because that we are in a season where will be in this Human Experience this flesh because there's a season for that God says I will give a portion of my blood I will give a down payment the price he paid was blood how many knows the price he paid was blood how many knows I'm bringing you along now the price that he paid was blood for our Redemption how many knows that blood has life in it has his life in it so God says because they're going to have to walk in a season and actually it'll be another 2,000 years of human beings coming on the face of the Earth and living Sons living in a human experience God says I'm going to take a portion of my blood I'm going to take a portion of my spirit a down payment and I'm going to put it in those Earthly bodies another scripture says we have this treasure in Earth and vessels he said because they're still in the flesh and there's going to be a season for this Human Experience I'll go ahead and put a portion or a down payment of my blood my spirit I'll put it in that Earthly experience I'll make a down payment but the truth is when he makes the down payment he has every intention of finishing the work Hallelujah he put a portion of his blood inness not all of it yet not the full payment yet he's paid it all but to redeem us back to it all he puts a down payment within us so uh the man of God goes on to say here and who is this mzc which we were reading from last Sunday and then when you become subject to that Spirit it throws your whole being subject to that spirit I love that this is not a watered down Holy Ghost where you have no power in your life it's so powerful that when it comes in a human body it throws the whole body subject to the spirit now it doesn't make your body perfect I don't believe in preaching the Holy Ghost makes us perfect we can't be perfect in these bodies did anybody forget that no we can't be perfect in these bodies we're not going to think perfect thoughts every day but something comes in us that has the power over sin we cannot preach the Holy Ghost one night at an altar and you've reached Perfection you're never going to misbehave again we can't preach it that way you can't preach the holy ghost that way for human bodies but you can preach that it's so powerful that if you'll yield yourself the whole body becomes subject to the spirit and that spirit is nothing in the world but this seed word made manifest are quickened Hallelujah Made Alive and when the Bible said don't do this that body quickly turns to it there's no question and what is it it's the earnest of the Resurrection this body will be raised up again because it's already started the power of the re Resurrection is the Holy Ghost the same holy ghost that raised Christ out of the Tomb and he says I'll take a portion of that resurrection power somebody ought to be shouting this morning I'll take a portion of that resurrection power and I'll place a portion of it in human beings you don't think you're going to start to overcome things you don't think you're going to resurrect in this body a little bit you don't think you're going to come out of your smoking and your habits and your your sexual addictions and you don't think that poers no it's going to bring this body under subjection because it's not you and in reformation and you shook the preacher's hand it's the power of eternal life working in you a sborn body it's amazing it's a mystery it's it's more can I say this respectfully because we're at Christmas time and they're celebrating the birth of Christ well that was a sin born B that was a a body not born in sin pure Mary didn't have anything to do with it except incubator Joseph didn't have any this was a this is a gene seed of God this is a direct so but look at the power in Jesus life look what it did in his 33 years here but he was not he was he wasn't born in sin what's more glorious to take the power of God and put it in your sinb porn body that it actually would come under subjection to the word who gets what gets more Glory what gives Satan frustrations more like he felt today brother Chris when he thought when he put Jesus in the the tomb I've taken care of this man it's over and in the upper room 120 little jesuses pop up and he goes now I've got to deal with 120 within days there were thousands that received the Holy Ghost now I got to deal with thousands of The Same Spirit living in them glory be to God it's his spirit it's not a Reformation it's the very Spirit of Jesus Christ you don't think it has the power in your life to overcome habits and addictions and drugs and everything else it has the power for you to [Applause] overcome oh I want it more than I ever wanted in my life he said when the Bible says he said it was once subject to sin and mire and Corruption but now it's got the earnest the down payment it's turned Heavenly can you imagine a human body sin born turns which direction turns Heavenly even though it may it won't make Heaven it turns s Heavenly I love that now that's the earnest that you're going in the Rapture that's the Assurance you're going in a Rapture when you see it's working in you in power that's the evidence now I pray that this will bring stability to the Sons and Daughters of God because there's so much instability today the devil wants to get you up and wondering from one Camp to the next whether you're saved whether you have the Holy Ghost and you got to go back the camp every year and get the Holy Ghost again I pray that I can be a pastor that preaches stability to the people get this spirit of God in your life and let it stabilize to Anchor to that if you see that power in your life that's the earnest that you are going in a Rapture what devil would tell a Believer I might miss the Rapture not if you have the down payment and a sick person Sharon a sick person laying dying nothing left but death that's all can happen I've seen Shadows of people done eat up with cancer and tuberculosis and see them persons a little while after that perfectly normal and strong if there is no Divine Healing then there is no Resurrection don't you dare believe in a resurrection someday in a Heaven someday unless you believe right here God heal [Applause] cancer cuz it's the down payment it's the down payment for it to help you overcome but it's the down payment and healing is one of the evidences when God heals in this way it's the evidence the resurrection is true because it's a portion of the resurrection power come on come on friends that that power that raised Jesus out of a grave that was a dead body for three days dead body if it can raise a dead body Sharon it can heal cancer it can heal any disease it can open up the blinded eyes it can raise the dead where has he done that come and talk to me I've got testimonies in the body of Christ around the world he still raises the dead you know what the earnest money is don't you it's the down payment can everybody say Amen it's the down payment two things here in this quote the evidence this por in us that we have this down payment it brings this sin body under subjection it's not perfect but it's subject to the word it experiences a mini Resurrection you experience a mini Resurrection in these bodies it never can be all of it it's sinb born but it's a resurrection power living within you and it turns Heavenly and that's the evidence you're going to be in the resurrection or be in a Rapture the second evidence is that the healing is the evidence the Rapture is going into a new body with no sickness but but the down payment in these bodies can heal these bodies and make them whole again why because this resurrection power has the power to take you to a new body if it has the power to take you to a new body it can heal these bodies the devil says no NOP it can't no no I've heard some I've heard some other reports where it didn't and yes we do but what about the thousands of others where it did and at the end of the day it's up to God based upon faith based on God God pulls our card right we don't really have power over that or we would be God so some some go some but you see now you can never do away with the power of Resurrection there's too many testimonies for thousands of years in the body in the Bible and also till today this very Sunday morning that we give God glory for that there's a evidence of the down payment in Believers and the down payment can heal these bodies and make them whole again no matter what the disease now the down payment think about it it's the security I'm not going to be very long today you still with me the down payment think about it it's it's it's the security that I will get the rest so if you young people or anyone for that matter you're going you see a car that you like you go see it and you like it and you have the money for it so you want to make sure that no one else gets it that it's yours so if you don't have all the cash on you then you say can I give you a down payment for the car can I give you maybe it's $2,500 and I'm going to give you $500 to hold it for me we do this a lot we're buying some somebody personally because we don't want somebody else to come and take it we'd like to have it we'd like to buy it I have the money I just don't have it with me but if I give give you $500 down and possibly some paperwork and a receipt of what I've given you for the 500 there is a time that you're going to show up later with the rest I'm preaching to you if the down payment is theirs then it's yours but there's a claiming time that you have to show up with the rest I'm waiting for God to show up with the rest can you say Amen my title this morning is a down payment towards all the rest I'm waiting for God to give me all the rest cuz I've got the down payment you say that say that person listen here's fire down and maybe some paperwork sometimes a handshake and you get a maybe you get a receipt and so you have ownership in that because you have it's as good as yours because you put a down payment on it can you say Amen but not all until you go pay the rest there's a time you show up with the rest there's a time to come and claim it with the rest of the money claim it and take it home with you there's a time that our lamb Christ comes to claim what's his he comes with Redemption claims 2,000 years ago he come with the Redemption price but 2,000 years he comes with Redemption claims he's making claims they are mine they're inheritance is theirs and I'm coming stepping forth as the lamb now because it's a different time for the lamb it's not the time of purchasing it's the time of finishing the purchase it's a time of claiming what is mine at the end time our lamb comes if you know your Bible our lamb comes in the end time after 2,000 years and he gets into a claiming mode and I'm only quoting that because you'll find this in the breach between the church chases and the seals and this is the theme is that in this breach of Revelations 5 which which is a gap we we go from the first the the seven Church Ages which brother rap is dealing with on Wednesday night he'll be on it again this Wednesday night first three chapters first four chapters excuse me first three chapters of Revelations is dealing with the church history of 2,000 years the church ages seven local churches in Asia Minor became prophetic of Seven Ages all the way to our age the lat oan age if you look in your Bible after that then there's a voice that calls us higher into the revelation of further things if you look in chapter five all of a sudden our lamb shows up and we seen our lamb go to Calvary for us 2,000 years ago we see him as a high priest we see him walking in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks which means he was in the midst with the people throughout seven Church ages but then if you're noticing if you really got inquisitive to know where does our lamb go in Revelation 5 he steps forth into this Vision that John's having our lamb Jesus Christ steps into a vision that John is having about a book of redemption that got lost a title deed that got lost that belonged to Adam but got lost and went back into the hands of the original owner because of sin Adam lost that title deed it was his he lost it through sin it went back in the hands of origin owner but there comes a time when God is going to hand it back back two sons so now you see our Lamb with by the way seven horns seven eyes and when you have the the the the number seven it means completion so it's not our lamb going to Calvary it's the same lamb that went to Calvary stepping forth now for what work claiming work time shall be no more no more delay it's kind of like when you go that day to pay the rest of the 2,000 for that car it's the claiming day it's the claiming time and so you get in your car with your dad and you're riding towards cuz you're what you're in a claiming mode you're in a paying off mode that's there's a transition and our lamb steps forth in this because why he's going to enter a season of The Seven seal he's going to enter a season that he's not in the high priest mode he's not in the dying and paying the price mode he's in the clim mode I'm stepping forth and the first thing he does is take this book of redemption that has seven mysteries on it and he tears those off and hands them to his Prophet on Earth to speak those seven Mysteries so now when he tears the seals off it this book of redemption that has our names in it is given to the people that you can start looking into there and start seeing it's claiming time it's position time it's to tell us what is this Holy Ghost it's not just a feeling at the Revival it's claiming time it's Rapture time it's position time it's knowing our position it's power time Hallelujah he enters the claiming mode which you know what uh and I'm just going to try to find a way to end this today but when our lamb he's going to enter the claiming mode and at the same time that our lamb enters the claiming mode Satan he gets in a uh frustrated mode or a fussing mode he's going to fuss with this he's going to be upset at this you still with me this morning he gets in a real vicious mode because this particular act it's one thing to die for the sins of the people but it's another thing for sons of God to begin to catch their position and what it's paid for Satan starts to become that's why in Christ mystery you say this is the reason Satan is howling right now he's howling he gets in this fussing mode because everything you grab a hold of in this book of redemption and hold on to say I'm starting to know my position I Know Who I Am the claiming is coming I'm going to finish this I'm going to a Rapture Satan gets mad and he's gonna fuss with it he's gonna fuss with you now now wait a minute you know hold on just a minute here what about what you did last week because he's angry he's upset at this particular time he gets howling he gets mad but guess what our lamb in this vision is called the lion because two glory be to God 2,000 years ago he had to come as a lamb innocent maybe not even intimidating but yet the Bible says the lamb has prevailed the lion has prevailed he prevailed at Calvary he gave up everything to pay for our sins but now it's the lion he's named The Lion because if the devil's gonna fuss about this then he might be a lamb the devil might not be afraid of a lamb but he's afraid of the lion that's why in The Vision now it's mentioned the lion that prevailed the lion the lion our same Jesus Christ moves into a mode he's into a claiming mode and he's not going to stop he's going to hand this to Sons he's going to finish this work he's going to take them to a Rapture despite they living in Satan's Eden glory be to God maybe I'm not capable of bringing it friends but I just feel like sitting down in a corner and weeping and shouting right now we're so blessed to hear these things not because of me we are blessed to be standing right now at this time because our lamb Jesus Christ is not in the lamb mode he's in a lion mode and the devil's going to fuss and tear you down and mess with your mind all he wants to but our lamb is our line is going to step in because he's in a claiming mode and he's going to claim that which is for you and claim you because you are his claim and all the other things you lost in the garden he's going to give back to you no more delay time no more Revelations 10:6 time no more he steps into a claiming o I'm here to start claiming the rest the lamb advancing from glory for intercessions all right to make claims now for his Redemption you guys don't have this quote up there the lamb advancing from Glory into this vision for intercessions he came from intercessing for 2,000 years to make claims now for his Redemption remember he has been on his mediatorial work back there mediatorial work back there for 2,000 years for remember these seals are ready to be opened and the lamb come from the sanctuary of God and Advance forth now when you have these terms he Advan forth he's going towards it he's stepping up to make Redemption cleans don't put a one day on it that all of a sudden bang this has happened in one day in 1963 and there's no more Mercy you're interpreting that wrong because everything that I say is that he's advancing for us he's stepping into this mode of claiming and it's a process just like everything else God does how many knows the first coming of Christ was a process it wasn't just when Jesus was born in a major it was a process the the prophecy was there then he spoke to Simeon then he spoke to Mary then and there's a bunch of things that went on before the baby was there his second coming is the same way it's not a one- day event and this lamb steps forth now and he's stepping forth don't you dare stick a date in 1963 he by opening the seals he begins this process with his people the lamb is going to step forth with claims now we get into trouble doctrinally when we start saying it happened then he open the seals it's there's no more Mercy for anybody out there it's all sealed in my brother you have misinterpreted the word whoever you are because this lamb I'm thankful today I wouldn't be preaching unless there was still Blood On The Mercy Seat for somebody to be saved and I'm going to keep preaching it until I'm gone to a Rapture because it's not up to me to decide when the lamb has shut the door and by the way he does shut the door he did in Noah's day God shut the door and nobody else could get in but it's not up to me when he shuts the door as far as I'm concerned the door is still open he can't bless denominational systems and Creeds and dogmas he can't do that his his blood does not work for something that's not his word but souls and sincere hearts that will accept the blood of Jesus Christ I have no right to put that person out these are the imbalances that we've had Among Us sometimes and I just want to teach my own people don't do that because the lamb and the lion is doing what he wants to do in his time and I just tell the devil if it was over who's this brother Jason sitting here was baptized a couple years ago and his life being transformed by the word who's this brother Brent here who's if it's over who's some of you who just came in 10 years ago or came in 5 years ago let that be just such an insult to the devil this morning that tries to tell us there's no blood on The Mercy Seat there is blood on The Mercy Seat the seriousness that the prophet brought that there reach a time that it will end and everything's sealed in and no more souls can come in uh because the Rapture no it's is coming there is a time coming but none of us have a right to say the exact day shame on us for doing it I don't know why I said all that this morning but I want to go back to that our lamb is in the claiming to come and get and pay the rest of that car and you're driving with your dad to go get that car but the devil gets to fussing he don't like it he's trying to find a technicality in the paperwork somewhere how am I going to explain this it's it's like when I go to the BMV office in Michigan it's very frustrating for me because I work so hard at bringing all the documents they need and how many has ever had somebody in one of those offices that just keep making it difficult I was just there this week for my mom for something for her they do the same thing to I try to be nice to them I just try to be and I say I have it all this is the fifth time I've come back because you asked for something new every time you know I have a job I have things to do and they always find a way you're missing something here you're missing it's just like Mr La Fontaine I'm having trouble here with what you have and I'm I'm sitting there saying why here's the documents this title I've bought it I have purchased the vehicle I want the title and a Michigan title and I have my I have my birth certificate I have my passport I have my footprint when I was a baby I have everything but how can we prove here I have my license it has my picture on it my picture is in the Bedford press it's here it's everywhere I am who I am but the devil wants to keep putting doubts in your mind that you are who you are when you have the birthright you have the Holy Ghost you have the down payment somebody say praise the Lord prise the Lord he likes to fuss even though there's no fussing there's no problem Mr leontine there seems to be uh a confusion going on and I'm going there is no confusion Mr leontine and she's shuffling all these papers you know like they do and it's like Mr leontine I just feel like something is missing here you haven't done something to earn this title yet there's something missing and and Mr leontine I'm gonna have to go back and talk to my manager about this Mr devil excuse me just a moment so they go back into the office and they take all the paperwork they did it this week they take all the paperwork to get approval from the manager and they took a look and then 15 minutes later they come out and sometimes they come out and they look at Mr leontine I'm sorry to say this but there's we still feel like there's just something missing here let we're going to have to read through this and it's all technicalities and you know what I meet all the technicalities for them because of the law Michigan law but I didn't have to meet all the requirements for the title deed to [Applause] Redemption but I still have a devil that's making me question and Mr leontine you've got to be missing something don't you remember that mistake you did last year and where's the payment for that it's underneath the blood of Jesus Christ it's under the blood it's frustrating and then she talks to her boss and finally come out and I do have everything and she just takes it on just she gets frustrated that's the Devil he's frustrated with you this can't be true that you get all this inheritance of Heaven given to you it's not fair I want to hold it back from you and he said but no he purchased it at Calvary it's mine healing is mine Redemption is mine power is mine he gave it to me give me that f it up hold up put it on can good day Mr leontine the way it is I'm telling you and and you know what it's it's kind of like how can I make I hope your understanding I know this is simple but this is how God wants to make it he's given you eternal life he gives you eternal life and we got a devil who's fussing with it all the time and there must be some confusion there and I feel like saying no there's no confusion confusion it's as clear as day I hold the title deed he's handing it back to Sons come here hey what what do you drawing come here I need your help for a minute come here all right I'm gonna have my son Solomon come here come here Lane John uh hullinger come up here you stand here Solomon okay I want you to play the devil I used to choose Ike but I'm choosing you now now John I want you to hand lane this is this is I'm going to give you this this is $40 okay I'm going to give you this and you can buy your dad a really nice Christmas present or whatever you want to do with it I would I would buy yourself a Christmas present really or distribute it okay I mean this now this is not a joke I'm I'm going to give you this but I'm just going to give you it's $50 4050 I'm going to give you I'm going to just give you a portion of it okay and then you got a little season here where it's it's sitting over here but I want you to know want you to know that even though you only have just a down payment you just have a portion and it's sitting over there that is still yours no matter if it's sitting over there it's yours because I gave it to you it's a gift to you okay now we got here A A fussing devil that he's going to come in front in between that and you and he's going to fuss with you and he's going to get angry at you and he's gonna uh do all the things that probably you can do Solomon to make him afraid to go get that and pick it up himself go try to get it okay hold on yeah that's what the devil does sometimes and that's what the devil does at the BMV office come back here buddy Betty Betty at the BMV office but you see now when you have if we're on our own okay when we on our own it's ours but we got a devil fighting us but in Revelations 5 the lamb our lion steps forth to make Redemption claims for us cuz we need a big brother how many know Jesus is our big brother we need a lion cuz a lion is the king of the jungle that's right can you say amen and from what I hear the lion hath roared who can but fear the lion roars in the jungle and you the lamb all those other things you know there's nothing but when the lion RAR they tell me the Jungle everything else shuts up so Lane if we've got a big brother here Jesus Christ who stands here with us is going to make claims with us there's not much that our lion has to do all he has to do is just look and tell him to get out of the way and you can go get your money thanks guys thank you don't try to steal his money no no no no that's yours that's it's yours buddy thank you for doing this thank you for acting I appreciate it did I embarrass you a little bit a little bit okay I'm sorry let me give you an extra 50 for embarrass let's all stand together and say praise the Lord I like the children sometimes to understand what I'm preaching and I'm telling you friends I believe that with all my heart that we're in the closing seconds of time I believe our lamb has become the lion and he's in a Redemption claim mode and every time you come to a service like that he's dropping things in your heart by Revelation from this open book to show Sons who they are where they're going and I believe I'm preaching to people who've got the down payment we just want the rest can you say Amen the Holy Ghost is just a down payment but it means we're going to get the rest and this last quote if you guys pull it up about healing I wanted to read this for my sister and all of the rest of you just to remind us of what God does and and I think that the power of God that would take a cancer-ridden woman here that the doctors has just given a few days and she's one of the thousands that's on record not just the man the person's testimony but the doctor's testimony one of the thousands and her eating up with a few hours to live by cancer and by the earnest of her redeemed body will put her in the condition it is now what will it be when she draws the full value of the resurrection of Jesus Christ that's just a d you know you know what the down the earnest is the earnest is the down payment on anything holds it assurity secures it now she's got the earnest of it being healed W with a hideous cancer that would have taken her life and here she is setting well and normal this [Applause]
