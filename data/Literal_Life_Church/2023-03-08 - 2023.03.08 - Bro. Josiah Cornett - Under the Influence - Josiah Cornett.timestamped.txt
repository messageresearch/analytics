[0:00] go straight to the word this evening so
[0:01] we don't take too much of your time but
[0:04] we want to make the most the time that
[0:05] we have with you
[0:07] if we could
[0:10] well let's go ahead and open with the
[0:11] word of Prayer
[0:15] dear Lord Jesus
[0:18] Lord as we just turn the order of this
[0:20] service now Lord
[0:22] the musicians have been faithful Lord
[0:26] not just faithful in their playing but
[0:28] they've been faithful and they're
[0:30] consecrating their gift and practicing
[0:33] Lord and
[0:35] laying before you to choose the right
[0:39] songs for the service Lord
[0:43] and Lord I've been faithful as I know
[0:45] how to lay before you and bring your
[0:48] word to your people Lord
[0:50] and now It All Leads up to this moment
[0:52] Lord we just turn it over to you father
[0:54] and ask that you would
[0:56] Lord bring your word your seed your
[0:58] bride Lord and plan it in a way that
[1:01] would bring life and fruitfulness to
[1:03] each Heart Lord as we turn the pages of
[1:07] this precious Bible I pray that you
[1:09] would lift the words and the Heart
[1:12] behind those words off from the pages
[1:15] Lord and into our hearts we pray and
[1:18] Jesus Christ's name will give you
[1:19] sovereignty in the service amen
[1:22] amen if you would turn with me to First
[1:24] Corinthians chapter 6 and 12.
[1:28] pulled just from from there and also
[1:32] Ephesians 5 and 18 will be pulling from
[1:34] both uh both texts this morning when you
[1:38] get the first text go ahead and give me
[1:40] a resounding round of Amen so I know
[1:43] that you're with me this evening and
[1:45] all right well we've got some fast
[1:47] Turners here beat me to it
[1:50] that's First Corinthians and then
[1:53] over here in Ephesians
[1:55] all right 6 and 12
[1:58] and the Apostle Paul writing to the
[2:00] Ephesians
[2:02] making an argument to them
[2:05] in in light of fornication in in
[2:07] different things that they're dealing
[2:08] with he says well all things are lawful
[2:10] unto me but all things are not expedient
[2:13] and all things are lawful to me but I
[2:16] will not be brought under the power of
[2:19] any
[2:20] and Ephesians 5 and verse 18.
[2:34] and it says hear and be not drunk with
[2:36] wine whereas in
[2:39] wherein is excess but be filled with a
[2:43] spirit
[2:43] may the Lord bless the reading of his
[2:45] word you can be seated this evening
[2:49] by God's grace I'd uh as you're seated
[2:51] this evening I'd like to title this
[2:54] sermon under the influence
[2:57] under the influence
[2:59] and uh we read the scripture here to be
[3:02] not drunk with wine whereas in his
[3:05] success which doesn't mean don't drink
[3:07] too much wine what it really means in is
[3:09] don't drink wine where wherein is excess
[3:12] wherein is if you open up that word it
[3:15] and extrapolate it means whereas
[3:16] riotousness and and lasciviousness and
[3:20] unclean living all that lies inside of
[3:22] there so don't be drunk with wine but be
[3:25] filled with the spirit
[3:27] so there's something about this wine
[3:30] that that it has the power to bring us
[3:33] under its influence that when you when
[3:35] you drink from this wine it it it it it
[3:37] it it it causes you to do something that
[3:39] you otherwise wouldn't do
[3:41] and we're just going to get this
[3:44] we're just going to get this out of the
[3:45] way this right away this evening
[3:47] so there's just some there's an
[3:49] influence behind this wine where when we
[3:52] drink from it it begins to alter our
[3:55] course of actions and alter our course
[3:57] of decision making
[3:59] so that we make other decisions that we
[4:01] otherwise would not have done
[4:05] so with with that I I think about how we
[4:08] how we got to that point how we how we
[4:10] got to that point with wine and all wine
[4:12] is is it starts out on the Shelf as some
[4:15] innocent bottle of grape juice
[4:18] and you just set it on the shelf and all
[4:21] by itself there's there's no problem
[4:22] without grape juice matter of fact you
[4:24] can drink as much of that grape juice as
[4:27] you want to and all the all it'll make
[4:30] you do is go to the bathroom a little
[4:31] bit more often
[4:33] it has no power to influence your
[4:36] behavior it might influence your gut if
[4:39] you drink a lot of it with all that
[4:41] sugar and all the unnecessary calories
[4:43] but that's all it's going to do it's not
[4:45] going to alter the course of your life
[4:48] but there's something about that grape
[4:50] juice innocent though it may seem that
[4:53] if you lay it on the shelf and under the
[4:56] right atmosphere under the right
[4:58] conditions under a covid-19 condition
[5:01] where you have too much time on your
[5:03] hand under under a condition where
[5:06] there's no accountability in your life
[5:08] under some kind of set of conditions
[5:11] that grape juice can lay lay there and
[5:14] through the process of time
[5:17] there begins to develop an influence
[5:20] behind it because it's not the grape
[5:22] juice but it's that alcohol that that
[5:24] influence that develops behind it
[5:28] so I think that like wine there are many
[5:31] things in our lives which seek to gain
[5:34] influence and power over of us
[5:36] things that start out seemingly innocent
[5:41] but with the right condition and through
[5:43] the process of time
[5:45] those things
[5:47] have their way in our lives
[5:49] and I I looked uh you look begin to look
[5:52] at some modern examples you can just
[5:53] look no further than our current culture
[5:55] and how do we get here and the
[5:57] advertisement that we have and what they
[5:59] want us to look at as being normal
[6:03] and and you look at you think about what
[6:05] normal is and what your sense of normal
[6:07] comes from your sense of normal comes
[6:10] from nothing else than what you bring
[6:13] yourself under as an influence
[6:17] they call it when you go from uh when
[6:20] you pick up a plane from here in America
[6:22] and you fly to to Africa where brother
[6:25] Tony is you're going to experience
[6:27] something they call culture shock
[6:31] especially if you've never been outside
[6:32] of Toledo poor you
[6:35] and and you think the whole world acts
[6:37] the same way that Toledo is and this is
[6:39] your normal and you have no basis of any
[6:42] other kind of normal if you get on a
[6:44] plane and ride home with brother Tony
[6:45] tonight and fly down into his his home
[6:48] country you will have a culture shock
[6:52] you'll be like what do you mean they do
[6:54] things this way and what do you mean
[6:55] they do things this way and what do you
[6:57] mean they think that's normal and you
[7:00] might even get a little bit judgmental
[7:03] because the way they do things is
[7:05] different than the way you do things
[7:08] but this world has a way of normalizing
[7:11] what God calls abnormal
[7:14] and if we're not if we're if we lay our
[7:18] lives underneath of its influence then
[7:20] it's going to become normal to us to see
[7:23] a woman and a man kissing on a screen
[7:25] somewhere it's going to become normal to
[7:28] us to see a man holding a woman in an
[7:31] Embrace where if we brought them into
[7:34] our home we'd kick them out but we'll
[7:36] let them do that on a screen in front of
[7:38] us because that's normal
[7:41] and and be careful because the whole
[7:44] culture what what how culture starts out
[7:47] as they start out by rationalizing it
[7:49] and they'll they'll start out by
[7:51] rationalizing it saying well that's not
[7:53] so bad and and and and that's the same
[7:56] way they've done with this homosexual
[7:57] agenda they start out by saying well you
[8:00] know animals kind of have some of that
[8:03] characteristic too well first of all I'm
[8:05] not an animal I'm not confused I'm I'm
[8:09] not I'm not confused about the I don't I
[8:12] don't have hormones that I can't keep in
[8:14] check I I'm not a confused being I've
[8:16] I've been given sovereignty over my
[8:18] vessel by the Holy Ghost I I I can have
[8:21] discernment I'm not an animal
[8:23] oh I'm so glad I I don't fall for that
[8:26] that conception that I evolved some from
[8:29] some ape somewhere I don't evolve from
[8:30] an ape I I evolve from from the son of
[8:33] Adam who is the Son of God and that's my
[8:36] Heritage that's my Evolution that's my
[8:38] that's my train that's where I come from
[8:43] but they'll rationalize it and they'll
[8:44] say well it's this and that and then
[8:46] they're saying you've got to accept that
[8:48] because some people are just that way
[8:49] and that's just the way it is all this
[8:52] rationalization and and then and then
[8:54] once you build it up to being accepted
[8:56] well now we've gotta we've come to the
[8:59] point where it's become normalized it's
[9:01] not just there's a small contingent of
[9:03] people way out here on the friends
[9:06] take any ideology you want to not just
[9:08] homosexuality not just transgenderism
[9:11] but take any ideology away from God and
[9:14] you see that follows the same pathway
[9:17] rationalize and then and then accept and
[9:21] then it becomes normal and then it's not
[9:23] enough to leave it being normalized if
[9:25] you're not careful you're going to find
[9:27] yourself wrapped up in a culture that
[9:29] wants to celebrate these things
[9:33] and then for go it goes from being
[9:35] celebrated to being pervasive
[9:39] and you don't want to be living in a
[9:40] culture where you're tied into that
[9:42] you're being just swept away and your
[9:44] idea of what normal is is being defined
[9:47] by the influences that surround you
[9:48] that's why we have to make sure that
[9:50] we're we're not forsaking from ourselves
[9:53] the the assembling together of the
[9:55] Saints
[9:56] as the time draws near like the
[9:59] scripture says it's not just coming to
[10:01] church twice a week like we were
[10:02] fellowshipping there with brother Jared
[10:04] in the back it's not just it's not just
[10:06] it's not just checking a box and getting
[10:08] enough time into to hear a sermon here
[10:10] and there who are you fellowshipping
[10:12] with who who do you hold discourse with
[10:15] who who is defining your normal who who
[10:18] surrounds your family
[10:21] do you live in an echo chamber
[10:24] or are you filling your family with the
[10:26] word of God
[10:28] I
[10:29] I think about this this culture and how
[10:31] it it tries it seeks to influence us and
[10:35] you know it's it's no longer a wolf in
[10:37] sheep's clothing anymore they they come
[10:39] out and they say it straight up and
[10:42] they'll say my job is to influence you
[10:45] how many have heard about online
[10:46] influencers amen all the young people
[10:48] know what I'm talking who am I talking
[10:51] everybody knows what an online
[10:52] influencer can you imagine just being so
[10:55] bold is to say I'm an influencer
[10:59] like
[11:00] who are you
[11:03] who may who made you so important that
[11:06] you get to influence my life and yet
[11:07] we'll still click on that and we'll
[11:09] watch their their their video about how
[11:12] we ought to live our life and they may
[11:15] not you just say the 10 points of how
[11:17] you ought to live your life because
[11:18] first of all that would be boring
[11:19] content
[11:22] but they've got a message it's grape
[11:25] juice but it's been sitting on the shelf
[11:27] long enough that there's an influence
[11:30] developing behind it
[11:32] now you look at the they'll they'll
[11:35] they're they're the you you go on
[11:37] YouTube and you find all kinds of
[11:39] influencers you find parent influencers
[11:41] and family influencers and oh you've got
[11:43] you you've got the you've got the the
[11:46] you've got the the family that'll get on
[11:48] there with their RV and they'll jump in
[11:50] their RV and they'll go on the road and
[11:52] they hit the road for a whole year and
[11:54] and every video that you see is just a
[11:56] bunch of smiles and and you know that
[11:59] it's not you know it's not legit there's
[12:01] some there's something inside of us
[12:03] rational logical thinking person that
[12:06] says this is a farce
[12:09] but yeah we get entertainment from it
[12:11] and yet if you entertain yourself off
[12:13] that you know what you're going to find
[12:15] yourself doing after a while
[12:16] you pull out your phone be like I wonder
[12:18] how much an RV costs
[12:21] kind of fun
[12:22] you'd know they're they're just pulling
[12:24] the wool over your eyes but yet there's
[12:26] something that's subversive enough
[12:27] you're drinking that wine it tastes good
[12:30] but there's an influence behind it
[12:32] there's an alcohol that's coming down
[12:34] that's changing your course of decision
[12:37] making
[12:38] and before you know it your thumbs are
[12:41] starting to reflect what's in your heart
[12:42] because something's gotten there and you
[12:45] haven't stopped to ask yourself what is
[12:47] it about this family that would just
[12:49] jump in an RV and and leave behind their
[12:52] family leave behind their grandparents
[12:54] and and their kids grandparents and
[12:56] leave behind a church community and just
[12:59] hit the road for a year
[13:02] we've just entertained ourselves with
[13:04] their lifestyle
[13:05] not thinking that maybe this person
[13:07] hasn't
[13:09] it's not the kind of person I I want to
[13:11] pattern my life after
[13:13] there's a family out there called the
[13:15] I'm just going to call a couple a name
[13:17] or two here uh The Bucket List family
[13:20] you know it's so fun to watch The Bucket
[13:23] List family because their whole their
[13:25] whole mantra's life is let's do
[13:27] everything fun before we kick the bucket
[13:32] now we'll uh we'll we'll pick that apart
[13:35] in just a minute here but just imagine
[13:37] you're you're you're watching them and
[13:39] they're they're going out to Timbuktu
[13:41] and they're going out to Costa Rica and
[13:43] they're they're diving in the ocean
[13:44] they're seeing these beautiful fish and
[13:46] they've got all I don't know where they
[13:48] get the money but apparently being an
[13:50] influencer
[13:52] pays well
[13:53] and they're going from from hopscotching
[13:57] from one place over the world to another
[13:58] and you're like wow I'd I'd like to
[14:00] travel the world like that with my
[14:02] family I wonder how much a ticket costs
[14:04] and wow that ticket cost a whole lot of
[14:06] money now what could we do to to just
[14:09] get a little piece of their life I don't
[14:12] want to live their whole life I just
[14:13] want a little piece of it I just I just
[14:16] want to go to
[14:17] Africa with brother Tony and that would
[14:19] that would really be the bomb
[14:22] going to Africa with brother Tony would
[14:23] be the bomb
[14:25] but if you're going there just because
[14:27] you're patterning your life after some
[14:29] influence you've seen that life is all
[14:32] about trying to fill up your bucket
[14:35] before you kick it
[14:38] you know I've I've got one thing on my
[14:40] bucket list
[14:42] and I guarantee you this family doesn't
[14:44] have it
[14:46] they're the one thing that's on my
[14:48] bucket list is I want to walk into those
[14:50] Gates of Glory
[14:52] holding the hands of my family with no
[14:55] man left behind
[14:56] and saying family we made it
[15:00] we made it we had to shun the world we
[15:03] had to shun the evil we had to turn off
[15:05] the television we had to find we had to
[15:08] look like oddballs to the world
[15:10] but we're here
[15:12] we're passing through the through the
[15:14] we're leaving time behind us and we're
[15:16] entering into eternity
[15:19] that's what's on my bucket list
[15:21] but you look at these families and and
[15:23] they look happy and their smiles all
[15:24] around but what it projects is it
[15:26] projects a lie because it projects a
[15:29] life happy but devoid of God
[15:33] and I've got news for you they're not
[15:36] showing it and I don't know where it is
[15:38] but if they're not if there's not a
[15:40] problem now there's a there will be a
[15:42] problem because you cannot have
[15:44] happiness you cannot have Pope you
[15:46] cannot have the fruit of the spirit you
[15:48] cannot have peace Joy love
[15:51] you cannot have contentment
[15:53] without the Holy Ghost without Jesus
[15:56] Christ
[15:58] do you know how I know that young person
[16:00] do you know how I can say that so
[16:02] confidently that no matter what you look
[16:04] for
[16:07] if you don't get Jesus first
[16:09] you will not be happy
[16:12] I don't say that as some some Mantra
[16:15] from the Bible I say it because I know
[16:17] that God created you
[16:20] and if God created you
[16:22] he created you in a specific way
[16:25] for a specific purpose
[16:27] and that purpose was to be in
[16:29] relationship with him
[16:31] and so if you're not fulfilling the
[16:33] relationship of your creator
[16:35] then you're looking you're like a door
[16:37] looking for a key
[16:38] and only he holds it
[16:42] and anything that's being projected
[16:44] online
[16:45] outside of that
[16:47] is nothing but a lie
[16:49] you wonder why this world is so bogged
[16:52] down with anxiety and so bogged down
[16:55] with with with an appetite for more
[16:59] it's because they've been lied to and
[17:01] they've bought it hook line sinker
[17:04] they've been lied to not just by the
[17:06] parent influencers but they've maybe you
[17:09] you get there on Tick Tock and Tick Tock
[17:11] has all these all these new dance moves
[17:14] or they've got the new they've got the
[17:16] new uh fashion that you want to get in
[17:18] your life and they got the new sneakers
[17:19] and that would be just a thing if I
[17:21] could just if I could just have that or
[17:24] if I could just you get on YouTube and
[17:26] it says that all the health
[17:27] professionals and they're going to tell
[17:28] you how to how to build muscle mass or
[17:31] reduce body fat amount and
[17:34] that's fine
[17:36] Paul said that not this Paul the Paul in
[17:39] the Bible Paul said that bodily exercise
[17:42] profiteth a little
[17:44] that's all right
[17:46] but it's just a little and those people
[17:48] are
[17:49] conveying a completely different
[17:51] influence they're conveying that it's a
[17:53] lot
[17:55] you say well brother Josiah that's
[17:57] that's all right I but I I just I just
[17:59] like to hear what other people have to
[18:01] say because I I just like to know how
[18:03] other people are living their life and
[18:05] maybe I can pick up a little bit of
[18:07] something out of their life and and and
[18:09] redeem it for the good you know
[18:12] if that's your approach to online
[18:14] influencers if that's your approach to
[18:17] the council that that is out there in
[18:20] the world I'm going to let you know
[18:21] right now your thinking man's filter is
[18:23] going to get clogged awful fast
[18:26] because the thinking man's filter is not
[18:29] a wide pore filter it's not a it's it's
[18:31] not a big mesh on that filter it's a
[18:34] fine mesh it says narrow it straight is
[18:38] the way and narrow is the gate that
[18:40] leadeth to repentance into the eternal
[18:42] life
[18:43] it's going to be a narrow fine filter go
[18:46] find a good source of counsel Saul of a
[18:49] sudden in the first in the first chapter
[18:51] of Psalms it says that blessed is the
[18:54] man that walketh not in the counsel of
[18:56] the ungodly
[18:58] no you you read further down that
[19:00] scripture it has a lot to say about the
[19:02] mockers and the scorners and and all
[19:04] those but the ungodly that's just the
[19:06] first stage that's that's not he's not
[19:07] saying the ma the scorner he's not
[19:09] saying all these these deleterious
[19:11] people he's just saying the ungodly
[19:13] what's that that's just the people
[19:15] without God
[19:20] in the presence of many counselors
[19:22] there's safety yes but the Bible says
[19:24] also that the count of the king who
[19:26] surrounds himself by evil counsel that
[19:28] King will fall
[19:30] so it's not just in the Council of many
[19:32] in the presence of many counselors their
[19:34] safety but who are you surrounding
[19:36] yourself by what counsel are you
[19:38] inundating your life with
[19:43] and if you don't think that
[19:45] listening to YouTube after YouTube and
[19:47] watching Tick Tock after tick tock
[19:49] counts as being in the counsel of the
[19:51] ungodly I have news for you Council just
[19:54] simply means to give advice
[19:57] and whether you like it or not they
[19:59] they're calling themselves influencers
[20:01] for a reason they're trying to influence
[20:03] you
[20:04] and they're not just trying to influence
[20:06] you for their product there's a power
[20:08] behind that a demonic power that's
[20:11] trying to influence you away from your
[20:13] God
[20:15] but the Bible says that wine is a mocker
[20:20] you know what else is a mocker
[20:22] social media is a mocker
[20:26] you know what I I I I get on Facebook
[20:29] and I load up Facebook and it seems like
[20:32] it it just wants to mock the Simplicity
[20:34] of a Godly life
[20:37] it's just I I can't just enjoy my
[20:40] blessings I have to look at what
[20:41] everybody else is bragging about their
[20:43] blessings on
[20:44] and and look at their their highlight
[20:47] reels of their life
[20:49] and yeah I just came back from a
[20:50] month-long vacation and I I think the
[20:52] good Lord for it and that was a special
[20:55] privilege to be able to take that but
[20:57] before I know it someone else is
[20:58] traveling to Florida
[21:00] and I I it seems like wow and they're
[21:03] going to Disneyland and my family ought
[21:05] to be going to Disneyland and I've never
[21:06] been able to take my kids to Disneyland
[21:08] and
[21:09] and all these things
[21:11] come as fruit of social media because it
[21:15] wants to to mock your life
[21:17] wants to mock the simplicity
[21:20] that is in Christ
[21:22] you know the Bible says that godliness
[21:24] with contentment is great gain
[21:27] and there's something about social media
[21:30] that just steals away your contentment
[21:34] they tapped us into some kind of
[21:36] psychology when they got with that
[21:39] endless scroll
[21:40] and there's something about the human
[21:42] psychology that it wants to have a
[21:45] finish to something
[21:46] but when the when the social the social
[21:50] scientists there at Facebook or wherever
[21:52] it was found that endless girl they they
[21:54] found a human trigger that now
[21:58] you scrolling and before you know it you
[22:00] look at your clock and say my goodness
[22:01] it's time for bedtime already where has
[22:03] the time gone
[22:05] and that whole time what have you been
[22:08] it is it's not just what could I have
[22:10] been doing with all that time
[22:13] and and we we will feel badly about that
[22:15] by itself that we've been wasteful of
[22:17] our resource of time
[22:19] but
[22:20] ask yourself what have I done with that
[22:23] time
[22:25] Christ says it this way he says the
[22:27] light of the body is the eye therefore
[22:30] when thy eye is single thy whole body is
[22:32] also full of light but when thy eye is
[22:35] evil
[22:36] thy body is full of Darkness
[22:38] what is it that you're bringing Through
[22:40] Your Eyes
[22:42] what is it that as you go through that
[22:43] endless scroll on whatever social media
[22:46] platform that you enjoy or
[22:49] what is coming through your eyes what is
[22:51] becoming normalized you turn your head
[22:53] and say oh I wish I hadn't seen that but
[22:56] then you go right back and you keep on
[22:58] scrolling
[22:59] friends I'm not here to condemn I'm
[23:01] saying I'm I can speak with knowledge
[23:04] about this because your struggles and
[23:07] the struggles of this laodicean age in
[23:09] America are my struggles
[23:11] but we've got to find a way to beat it
[23:14] and it's not becoming Amish because
[23:17] that's not our calling
[23:19] we are called to be a bride that lives
[23:22] above the laodicean that is called up
[23:25] into a bride age with the Lord Jesus
[23:27] Christ by a potent powerful message of
[23:30] the hour
[23:31] it's not the Amish as much as I as much
[23:34] as I'd love to be like the Amish and
[23:36] just turn my back on it all I'm not
[23:38] called to turn my back at all I'm called
[23:40] to overcome it all
[23:42] I'm called to be in the world but that
[23:45] not of the world
[23:46] I'm called to be able to show to to this
[23:49] to Satan that that this Eve is not like
[23:52] the first Eve that that she can listen
[23:55] to The Whispers of a serpent and still
[23:58] stay true to her Adam
[24:04] this is our
[24:05] our calling but yet Satan wants to twist
[24:09] your frame and your character into a
[24:12] black hole
[24:13] I say that not to be dramatic but
[24:15] because that's exactly what it is a
[24:18] black hole of envy and covetousness
[24:22] that can never be filled
[24:25] Envy is what is that is it's lusting
[24:28] after that what your friend has what is
[24:29] covetousness it's an ungodly greedy
[24:33] appetite for something more
[24:35] and you didn't start out that way but
[24:36] you got on your phone and you found out
[24:38] that the more you saw the more you want
[24:40] and the world has this this offering to
[24:43] your life and it says well just get this
[24:45] and you look at Pinterest in that fact
[24:47] just do this little DIY project like
[24:49] everybody else is doing and make my home
[24:51] just like this that'll be it and I can
[24:53] rest sit down and I can say
[24:57] I have Pinterest worthy home
[25:01] never mind that in that whole process
[25:03] you never invited a saint over to your
[25:05] home you never broke bread with us
[25:07] saying she never had fellowship with
[25:08] those things but you have a Pinterest
[25:10] worthy home that's modeled after some
[25:13] woman some man that you don't even know
[25:16] and they're they're calling themselves
[25:18] an influencer but what are they
[25:19] influencing you on too
[25:23] don't let this world twist the character
[25:25] of your frame into a black hole but
[25:27] we're called to be filled with a spirit
[25:30] not to be made of black holes of envying
[25:33] with screen time reports that turn our
[25:36] hedge and shame at the end of the week
[25:37] knowing that we've proselyted our time
[25:40] out to the world
[25:41] and not redeemed it for the Lord
[25:47] the Bible says this God gave them over
[25:49] to reprobate mind being filled this is
[25:52] what Satan wants to fill you with with
[25:54] all unrighteousness and fornication
[25:57] oh I don't do that but what do you what
[26:00] what is the movies that we're watching
[26:01] what are we what's coming into our eyes
[26:04] what's what's the if the light of the
[26:08] eyes is your if the light of the body is
[26:11] the eyes then then what are you filling
[26:13] yourself with
[26:14] filled with fornication and wickedness
[26:16] and covetousness
[26:18] malishness maliciousness full of Envy
[26:21] murder I I don't I don't I don't have
[26:24] anything like that in my life well how
[26:26] about all those docu-series that you
[26:28] watch and the true crime and
[26:31] is that something that would be
[26:33] beneficial to a Christian
[26:35] you know the Bible says that there's
[26:37] there's certain things that are not even
[26:39] convenient that are shameful that are
[26:42] done in secret that aren't are would be
[26:44] shameful for even to talk about and this
[26:47] world wants to make a whole docu-series
[26:49] about it and say hey why don't you
[26:51] educate yourself about all the things
[26:53] you're missing out on
[26:55] and at the end you know what Christian
[26:57] you can glorify God that you're not a
[26:59] part of all that
[27:01] no
[27:02] turn yourself away put that thing away
[27:05] from you
[27:07] backbiters and haters of God despiteful
[27:09] proud boasters and vendors of evil
[27:12] things and disobedient to parents
[27:15] but their end was to be turned over to
[27:17] unnatural affections and that's the way
[27:19] this world has gone but I hope better
[27:22] things for us I believe there's been a
[27:24] more sure word of Prophecy over this
[27:26] group of people that that it will not be
[27:28] our end that we will not succumb to this
[27:30] world that our character will not be
[27:33] eroded over the over the years week by
[27:35] week hour by hour giving our time up to
[27:38] something that's not of God
[27:40] but that will not be our end but God
[27:43] wants to change this from Glory unto
[27:45] Glory
[27:46] oh my there there we could preach a
[27:48] sermon it's not it's it's not it's not
[27:51] screen time but it's face time not face
[27:54] time with our phones but face time with
[27:56] Jesus Christ getting into his face and
[27:59] looking into this this word and being
[28:02] changed the Bible says to look unto
[28:04] Jesus the author and the finisher of our
[28:06] faith and looking unto him were were
[28:08] changed from Glory unto Glory
[28:11] not from not from covetousness unto
[28:13] covetousness not from oh here's the next
[28:16] thing and once you get there you've got
[28:18] the next thing and once you get there
[28:20] you've got the next thing and you look
[28:21] behind and you're like what have I been
[28:24] doing with my life
[28:25] I've been filling it with all these
[28:27] things
[28:28] the things that are no longer
[28:30] fashionable no longer desirable no
[28:32] longer no longer admirable by even the
[28:35] world and my life is filled with it
[28:38] I can tell you about all these video
[28:40] episodes and I can tell you about all
[28:41] the things that Hollywood came out of
[28:43] but can you tell me about the word of
[28:45] God and what God's doing in your life
[28:46] and what God's doing in your family life
[28:48] not not 10 years ago but what he's done
[28:50] last week and what he's done this
[28:52] morning and what he's doing right now
[28:53] and what he what do you feel he might be
[28:55] doing in your life is as far as the next
[28:57] step in the next Direction because
[28:58] there's something about a relationship
[29:00] with Jesus Christ when he calls you to a
[29:03] Next Step it's not a carrot in front of
[29:05] a donkey it's a it's a promise and it's
[29:07] part of the daughter and son of God he
[29:09] says here's your promise I've set before
[29:12] you this day choose whom ye will serve
[29:14] and when you choose me I offered you not
[29:17] a carrot but I offer you eternal life
[29:20] so much so that the God of all Heaven
[29:23] swore by himself
[29:24] and said I will not repent of my
[29:27] promises
[29:29] my promises are sure and they're true
[29:31] not the carrots of the world but you
[29:34] find out that as you go down this
[29:36] journey with God long enough you start
[29:38] looking back and you can say like that
[29:40] old little
[29:41] Southern black woman I think it was she
[29:43] said
[29:44] I sure is not what I want to be
[29:48] it is not what I ought to be but I can
[29:51] look back over the course of time and I
[29:53] can tell you I sure am not what I used
[29:56] to be God had brought her to enough next
[30:00] things that she could look back and say
[30:02] I'm so glad I came from all of that
[30:05] I've made progress my life is built up
[30:09] not upon sinking sand but it's built up
[30:12] upon the rock of Jesus Christ
[30:15] and brothers sisters parents we have a
[30:19] responsibility not just that we could
[30:20] say that of ourselves but if we lead our
[30:23] family correctly in this laodicean hour
[30:24] we can say that of our family
[30:27] we aren't where we want to be we aren't
[30:29] where we ought to be I can say that
[30:31] tonight I'm not where I want to be with
[30:33] my screen time with my family I'm not
[30:36] where I ought to be
[30:37] thank God I'm not where I used to be and
[30:40] I'm not talking about screen time I'm
[30:42] talking about now I'm talking about
[30:44] we're not where we used to be where we
[30:48] were just little parents that were
[30:49] holding a little baby in our arms and
[30:51] didn't know what to do with it
[30:53] I'm glad I'm not there anymore
[30:56] but I can I can say I I've prayed the
[30:59] sinner's prayer with my little
[31:00] three-year-old son when it was three
[31:03] I I saw his heart begin to open up as I
[31:06] talked to him about the Lord just the
[31:08] other day we were we we chose to we're
[31:11] trying to make the right decisions with
[31:12] our entertainment and
[31:14] when showing a movie to my little boy we
[31:16] chose a little a little bible cartoon
[31:19] and they introduced the story of of
[31:21] Zacchaeus and I'm like he's not catching
[31:24] any of this I asked him a couple
[31:25] questions afterwards and
[31:28] didn't have a clue
[31:30] but he came to my wife just today she
[31:32] said and she said he recited the whole
[31:34] story of Zacchaeus come in its entirety
[31:38] to me
[31:39] they're catching more than what we're
[31:40] realizing
[31:42] and I'm so glad that I can say my
[31:44] family's my family's not where it used
[31:46] to be but but we're making progress
[31:51] and I so appreciate what our Pastor said
[31:53] on Sunday that if we keep our minds
[31:56] towards the Eternal and not the temporal
[31:59] that will guide our decisions for our
[32:02] family that'll guide the cartoons that
[32:04] our children watch and not just making a
[32:06] pure entertainment but what what can I
[32:09] endow to my children what heritage can I
[32:12] give my children today how can I get
[32:14] across this huge gift that God's given
[32:17] me I can't give it one big block but
[32:20] it's like I've got to give it to them in
[32:22] little pieces of bread I've got to find
[32:25] ways to break it down on a daily basis
[32:33] but wine is a mocker
[32:38] it'll mock your Ambitions in life
[32:41] it'll mock your holy ambition
[32:43] you know what else is a mocker
[32:46] HDTV
[32:49] HGTV is a mocker
[32:53] I'm gonna there's this confession time
[32:55] right now
[32:58] a little while back I
[33:00] got the discovery Discovery
[33:03] um channel for my son and we wanted to
[33:05] watch some documentaries with each other
[33:07] they've got some good documentaries on
[33:09] there and sat down and
[33:12] on the one side is you know
[33:14] documentaries about God's creation and
[33:15] things and you can watch that and that's
[33:17] it's fun on the other side there's all
[33:20] these reality TV shows and and then
[33:22] there's HGTV I've always had kind of a
[33:26] hankering for real estate and I thought
[33:28] I'd watch a couple episodes and I didn't
[33:30] much care for the Joanna Gaines you know
[33:32] all the flippers but I I really like
[33:36] that that format where they come in and
[33:38] they buy a house brother Henry and first
[33:41] of all they sit down with a realtor and
[33:42] they said well this is how much we this
[33:44] how much we have to spend and if they
[33:46] say you know fifty thousand dollars or
[33:48] 150 000 you just turn the next Channel I
[33:51] don't
[33:52] I don't want to watch somebody that has
[33:53] my budget right I want to watch somebody
[33:55] that makes like 10 or 20 times more than
[33:57] I do
[33:58] so they they sit down they're like we
[34:00] have this budget a few million dollars
[34:01] I'm like all right now this is this is
[34:03] what it looks like to be riding High
[34:06] and then they'll go out and they'll go
[34:08] and they'll go through three different
[34:10] they'll go three through three different
[34:11] houses and they'll pick the house
[34:13] whether you like it or not they'll pick
[34:14] that one and
[34:17] they have all different iterations of
[34:18] this they have Montana they have
[34:20] Mountain life and they have log cabins
[34:22] and whatever you like
[34:23] oh I happened I happened to like log
[34:25] cabin so I started watching all these
[34:26] log cabins and you know some people get
[34:29] involved in football I was getting
[34:31] involved in this I just about they
[34:33] picked the wrong cab and I just wanted
[34:34] about wanted to take my shoe and throw
[34:36] it at the screen like are you kidding me
[34:38] why would you pick that cabin oh you
[34:40] pick a a 5 000 square foot cabin on one
[34:43] acre of land what are you thinking go
[34:46] for the place with 20 acres with 1500
[34:48] square foot who cares
[34:53] so I thought this was all good
[34:54] entertainment right a few days later
[34:57] I'm watching my thumb you know sometimes
[34:59] your thumb tells you where your heart's
[35:00] at especially when it's connected to
[35:01] your phone
[35:04] I see myself click on the Zillow app and
[35:07] load up and
[35:08] kind of wonder what kind of cabins are
[35:11] in my area
[35:16] happens in Toledo
[35:18] there's no mountains either
[35:21] why do I live here
[35:28] and all that godliness with contentment
[35:31] that God's been giving me as his great
[35:33] gain is turned to seep right out of the
[35:36] windows of my heart
[35:40] and I had to stop myself and say what am
[35:43] I doing because I'm sitting in a house
[35:45] that's I'm literally sitting within
[35:47] God's testimony for me I I just bought
[35:50] this house a year and a half ago what am
[35:52] I doing
[35:54] not only that but it's not just a Time
[35:56] duration but I've got to testimony that
[35:58] comes from this house and I've gotta
[35:59] I've got I've got a Heritage in this
[36:01] area and I've got a People of God that I
[36:03] that I fellowship with and I've got
[36:05] family that serves the Lord in this area
[36:07] and I've got so many roots I'm not
[36:09] talking about Roots like the world gives
[36:11] you roots and what they talk about but
[36:13] I've got spiritual roots that go down
[36:15] into into the terror firm of God's
[36:17] experience for my life and draws from
[36:20] the water table of God's word and his
[36:22] spirit and I can say I I have something
[36:25] way more than anybody on HGTV has
[36:29] and I had to I had to give myself a
[36:31] heart check because what was it doing
[36:33] HGTV was coming into my life brother
[36:35] Henry and it was mocking God's testimony
[36:38] it was mocking God's goodness to me
[36:41] sister Esther it was saying you don't
[36:43] have a good house and you don't live in
[36:45] a good area and you don't have nothing
[36:47] but when I started to think about it I
[36:49] do have it I have more than they have
[36:51] and one day I'm going to a place that's
[36:54] that's that I'm going to Mount Zion one
[36:57] day I have all the mountains I want
[37:00] I don't have to spend my whole life
[37:02] aspiring to find some Mountain out in
[37:05] the
[37:06] Colorado Rockies with my log cabin
[37:10] I've already got that box checked from
[37:12] the foundational world
[37:14] God's Got a Mansion prepared for me in
[37:17] glory
[37:19] and I've got a whole lot more worth
[37:21] living for right here on Earth
[37:26] but this is just an Evidence of what
[37:28] Christ said when he says but they that
[37:29] be rich will fall in Temptation and the
[37:32] snare
[37:33] and many hurtful and fullest losts which
[37:36] drowned man in destruction and perdition
[37:39] say well brother Josiah that scripture
[37:42] is not talking about me I'm I'm not rich
[37:44] you didn't see my tax return this year
[37:47] you know if your tax return
[37:52] kind of blow your mind a little bit for
[37:54] a second
[37:56] do you know what the median
[37:59] global
[38:00] household income is after adjusting for
[38:03] local
[38:04] cost of living
[38:07] would you believe it's about ten
[38:09] thousand dollars per year
[38:11] that means the average person that reads
[38:14] their Bible
[38:15] lives on about ten thousand dollars per
[38:17] year
[38:19] and somehow they figure out how to get
[38:21] by
[38:22] and if you had to you would too
[38:26] because there's people in America that
[38:27] live that look on that on that pay scale
[38:32] you might live in a hut
[38:34] you might live in a grass shelter down
[38:37] in Florida but you would you would find
[38:38] a way just like the average person in
[38:42] the world that reads the Bible
[38:44] so if you make any substantial amount
[38:46] more than ten thousand dollars on your
[38:48] tax return this year
[38:50] if you forgot how much you made you can
[38:52] go back and check out your tax return I
[38:54] just did mine today it's not ten
[38:56] thousand I thank God
[38:59] but it does put me in this bucket
[39:01] it also puts me in the bucket where
[39:03] Christ said that it's harder for a camel
[39:07] to pass through the eye of the needle
[39:09] which was a tricky gate going to
[39:11] Jerusalem
[39:12] then
[39:14] it's I'm sorry it's harder for a rich
[39:16] man to go into the Kingdom of Heaven
[39:17] than for that Camel to go through the
[39:18] eye of the needle that's you friends
[39:20] that's laodicea that's our challenge
[39:26] so we have to be careful that we're not
[39:28] falling at those foolish and hurtful
[39:30] losts
[39:31] you know what one of the the most
[39:35] obvious indicators of wealth is
[39:38] it's not so much as how much is in your
[39:40] bank account or what your discretionary
[39:42] income is but really wealth is what your
[39:45] discretionary time is
[39:48] if you have enough time that you don't
[39:50] have to keep on working to get food in
[39:52] your mouth
[39:53] you're wealthy
[39:55] now the question is what are you doing
[39:57] with all that discretionary time
[40:02] I'll just leave that one there
[40:05] but wine is a mocker
[40:08] you know what else is a mocker
[40:11] there's going to be some stepping on
[40:13] toes tonight is that all right
[40:15] do we still have time to step on a few
[40:16] more toes
[40:18] it happens to you be your toes do we
[40:20] still have time
[40:25] Hollywood
[40:27] is a mocker
[40:30] Hollywood makes a mockery of holiness
[40:35] Hollywood makes a mockery of your home's
[40:38] values
[40:39] when you bring that accursed thing into
[40:42] your home
[40:45] it's making a mockery in front of your
[40:47] children
[40:48] in front of your wife
[40:50] of the values that you profess to
[40:51] believe
[40:53] and you say well brother Josiah I don't
[40:55] bring the accursed thing you don't you
[40:57] don't understand we only bring Pidgey
[40:58] into our home or we only
[41:00] whatever your criteria right
[41:04] I'm asking you to look at it again
[41:05] tonight
[41:06] I'm not asking you to throw it out
[41:08] that's between you and the Lord
[41:10] and I don't know where my family is
[41:12] going with this but I know that where
[41:14] we're at right now
[41:15] is not where we're going to stay
[41:19] Hollywood celebrates adultery
[41:22] you can't get away from it
[41:24] and you may not have a a a movie that's
[41:27] rated that way and you say well we don't
[41:29] we don't watch that kind of stuff but
[41:30] Hollywood celebrates adultery
[41:33] brother said when when when when you
[41:36] kiss a a a woman that's not your wife
[41:39] and you're even if you're not married
[41:41] yet you're kissing another man's wife
[41:44] and Hollywood has that plastered over
[41:46] their screens
[41:47] Hollywood celebrates fornication
[41:50] you say well I don't have anything like
[41:52] that in my home but
[41:54] Christ said that for for a man to look
[41:56] upon a woman
[41:58] and lust after her and his heart he's
[42:00] committed adultery with her they're
[42:02] right there in his heart you say well
[42:04] brother Josiah the sons of God turn
[42:06] their heads what are you talking about I
[42:08] I know that that stuff sometimes slips
[42:10] across brother but I just turn my head
[42:14] no sons of God turn their heads when it
[42:16] happens on the street but when you've
[42:18] chosen to bring it into your home that
[42:20] puts things in a different category and
[42:22] brother you can choose to Pivot your
[42:24] head but what about your 12 year old son
[42:26] that's sitting right beside you what
[42:28] about your little daughter that's there
[42:29] what about your what about your family
[42:31] that's going to one day rise up and say
[42:33] but the preacher preached this and we
[42:36] saw you do something contrary wise
[42:39] see Hollywood doesn't just want to make
[42:41] a mockery of your values but they want
[42:44] to make your children rise up and mock
[42:46] you
[42:47] proverbs 31 says that if Proverbs 31
[42:49] Woman shall rise up they'll grow up
[42:52] they'll become mature and they'll look
[42:54] back and they'll call their mother
[42:55] blessed
[42:57] but Hollywood wants to take your
[42:58] children and when they get to D12 14 18
[43:01] and 36 years old they want you to turn
[43:04] back and say
[43:05] and mock your parents
[43:08] because
[43:09] there was something in the home that
[43:11] engendered a disrespect
[43:13] some duplicity that was happening
[43:16] something that didn't line up between
[43:18] the things that you said were your
[43:20] values and the things that you chose to
[43:22] entertain your family with
[43:25] Hollywood celebrates corrupt
[43:26] communication
[43:28] what is corrupt communication
[43:31] the Bible says it this way in Ephesians
[43:33] 4 29 let therefore no corrupt
[43:35] communication proceed out of your mouth
[43:36] but that which is good to the use of
[43:40] edifying that it may be Minister Graves
[43:42] unto the hearers
[43:45] oh I would that we would choose things
[43:47] that ministered Grace to us when we hear
[43:49] it
[43:50] says grieve not the holy spirit of God
[43:52] whereby ye are sealed into the day of
[43:53] redemption
[43:54] and let all bitterness and wrath and
[43:57] clamor and evil speaking be put away
[44:00] from you
[44:04] that that pertains to swear words sure
[44:06] that's that's that's the Baseline
[44:08] condition right
[44:09] but what what what are those people
[44:11] projecting
[44:12] is there Strife involved is there is
[44:16] there clamor is there bitterness is
[44:18] there is there frustration
[44:20] let me put it this way for people that
[44:22] occupy the main characters
[44:25] and the movies that your family watch
[44:27] are they people that you would want your
[44:29] children to be around
[44:32] oh there's a high standard
[44:35] but those are the people that's
[44:36] influencing you
[44:37] and in our digital age they're
[44:39] influencing you more than your friends
[44:42] are influencing you because you know
[44:43] what you see them more often you spend
[44:45] more time with the movie stars on the
[44:47] screen and and the influencers on
[44:49] YouTube than you even spend with your
[44:50] friends and church family if you're not
[44:52] careful
[44:57] but I think we need to reset if we find
[44:59] ourselves in this condition
[45:05] Hollywood celebrates
[45:07] celebrates murder celebrates True Crime
[45:11] like there's docusaries they're coming
[45:13] out with and
[45:15] I don't even want to say the name of it
[45:16] almost but
[45:18] Donner or Dahmer or whatever it is and
[45:20] and people will flock to those things
[45:24] because they they're intrigued by it
[45:26] it's so different it's it's tantalizing
[45:30] don't make that your
[45:33] your kind of environment friends
[45:38] be careful about what you watch the
[45:40] Galatians 5 19 says it this way now the
[45:43] works of the flesh are manifest which
[45:44] are these adultery and fornication and
[45:46] uncleanness and lasciviousness and
[45:48] idolatry Witchcraft and wizards oh I put
[45:51] that in there but witchcraft
[45:53] these are the works of the flesh
[45:56] variants and emulations
[45:59] Strife which happens to mean
[46:01] electioneering and partisanship
[46:04] try listening to only Fox News for a
[46:07] week and you'll find out that the
[46:08] Republican spirit is not a spirit of
[46:10] Christ
[46:16] news flash if you didn't know
[46:22] seditions and heresies and things
[46:24] murderers drunkenness and revelings and
[46:26] they do such things shall not inherit
[46:28] the kingdom of God
[46:30] I believe better things of us but at the
[46:32] same time I don't want to be surrounding
[46:34] myself
[46:35] with people that are not going to be
[46:37] inheriting the kingdom of God
[46:39] I want to be surrounding myself with you
[46:41] people
[46:42] I want to be surrounding myself with
[46:43] people that one day I'm going to enter
[46:45] into eternity with
[46:48] and and
[46:49] enjoying your presence and not the
[46:52] presence of of some ungodly counsel
[46:54] coming into my room
[46:58] Hollywood presents ideologies that are
[47:00] completely devoid of God
[47:02] you might think it's just an
[47:03] entertaining children's show
[47:05] but it's
[47:06] if if I can say it this way when that
[47:09] producer comes to mind with his script
[47:11] and his his production he's creating his
[47:15] world
[47:16] and he's welcoming you into it
[47:19] so be careful who's behind that
[47:21] Hollywood production because you're
[47:23] spending a little bit of time inside of
[47:25] his mind
[47:27] inside of her mind or inside of their
[47:30] mind or its mind or
[47:32] whatever kind of mind mixed up mind it
[47:34] is
[47:38] and when we get uh where we're watching
[47:40] these things that are it's just from the
[47:42] thrill it's just for the entertainment
[47:44] it's just because it's it's exciting the
[47:46] senses be careful what it is that's
[47:48] exciting your senses because remember
[47:50] where your senses come from
[47:52] your senses come from a serpent
[47:55] this this body this the sensations of
[47:59] this body
[48:00] are sin born
[48:02] and maybe
[48:04] if The Thrillers and and the the demonic
[48:07] things that are going on and and and you
[48:10] you might say well it's not demonic but
[48:13] just give it the word test a little bit
[48:16] is it appealing to these senses or is it
[48:19] appealing to to the spirit that's within
[48:21] you do you do you leave that do you
[48:23] leave that Hollywood session that Cinema
[48:25] session say I feel so edified I feel so
[48:28] lifted up I feel so encouraged or to say
[48:30] wow that was really thrilling that was
[48:32] really something wasn't it didn't you
[48:34] like the effects didn't you like this
[48:36] wasn't that little Hub wasn't that
[48:37] monster something else wow that was
[48:39] something
[48:41] what's that
[48:42] did you know there's going to be a whole
[48:44] group of people that are turned so
[48:46] insane until they see locusts with hair
[48:49] like woman is what Revelations tells us
[48:51] and brother Branham says that those
[48:53] things are preparing their mind for the
[48:55] blast
[48:56] don't let yourself be wrapped into all
[48:59] that you're not meant for the blast
[49:01] friends you're not meant for all that
[49:03] you're called to a resurrection power
[49:06] you're called to come into the holy city
[49:09] where's Treacher of gold
[49:11] and it's Purity and light all the time
[49:15] but yet we come out of these Hollywood
[49:16] experiences and it's been dark and now
[49:19] our eyes are dark because we've been
[49:21] feeding this sin-borne vessel
[49:24] and say wow it was just entertainment
[49:28] I'm here to challenge you in the name of
[49:30] the Lord
[49:32] if you fall into this camp
[49:35] you're being rebuked tonight
[49:37] In The Name Of The Lord
[49:39] but it's not a rebuke of a man because I
[49:42] wouldn't do that to you but when God
[49:44] comes to you and God convicts your heart
[49:47] he says those who are those who I love I
[49:51] rebuke and I cherish
[49:56] it's not an indictment tonight
[49:58] but it's God's loving hand saying no
[50:01] this is the way over here walking in it
[50:04] turn away from all of that turn away
[50:06] from from a Hollywood that wants to mock
[50:09] the Holiness and mock everything that's
[50:11] about God
[50:15] but wine is a mocker
[50:17] a strong drink is Raging and the Bible
[50:20] says that whoever is deceived thereby is
[50:22] not wise
[50:25] and so there's a deception that lies
[50:28] behind any
[50:30] form of influence
[50:31] it's first recognizing what those form
[50:33] of influences are in our lives and in
[50:35] this digital culture a lot of it comes
[50:37] from these screens
[50:40] and I'll tell you this
[50:42] these screens right here
[50:44] these are the new door to Sodom
[50:47] you know you look a lot he was he was
[50:49] barring the door of his household down
[50:51] there in Sodom so those sodomites
[50:52] couldn't get through the door
[50:54] no one's knocking on your door today
[50:57] they're too busy quarantining
[51:01] they don't want to see you anyhow
[51:03] your heart even you hardly ever get a
[51:05] door-to-door Salesman anymore even
[51:07] no one's knocking on your door but
[51:09] they're knocking on these doors
[51:13] and we have to be the man and the woman
[51:14] of God who stands at these doors
[51:17] and meets that knock
[51:19] meets that call this hour and say no
[51:22] Sodom will knock and I will answer
[51:26] I'll be the man of God that takes up
[51:28] that simple hiss of faith and says I
[51:30] don't know how to close this Pandora's
[51:32] box but by God I'm going to take this
[51:35] hiss up I'm going to dip it in the blood
[51:37] of the lamb and I'm going to say family
[51:39] we're going to apply the token to the
[51:41] doors of our home
[51:43] we're going to apply the token to your
[51:44] cell phones we're going to apply the
[51:46] token to the video monitor we're going
[51:48] to apply the token to the iPads
[51:50] and we're not going to let Sodom through
[51:52] these doors
[51:54] because behind there is an influence
[51:58] and it's not just those things I I
[52:00] recognize that some of us
[52:02] perhaps you
[52:04] you your thing is books
[52:08] but I want to encourage you
[52:10] that remember the grape juice on the
[52:13] Shelf
[52:14] just let it sit there long enough if
[52:17] you're not watching it if you get your
[52:18] eyes off the ball
[52:20] it can develop an influence behind it a
[52:22] little habit a little
[52:24] good book reading practice in life
[52:28] can still
[52:30] go sour
[52:32] so be careful who's writing the books
[52:34] that you read
[52:35] well cute example of this is I I was
[52:38] picking up some books some from the
[52:40] local library here and they had some
[52:42] book giveaways or a dollar book or
[52:44] something and I pulled a bunch down
[52:46] because I always tell myself I'm going
[52:48] to read all these books and I bring them
[52:50] all home like this and my sister Rebecca
[52:53] I'm holding them all like this and my
[52:55] wife's like
[52:56] you're not going to read all those
[52:59] I'm like but someday
[53:01] someday I'm going to read them and
[53:03] they're going to make me a better man
[53:04] because every one of them is a
[53:05] self-improvement book
[53:07] and I've got a lot of improvement from
[53:09] self-help books and I've needed a lot of
[53:11] help so I it's been good for me through
[53:13] the years but I opened up this one
[53:15] self-help book and it was about family
[53:18] and family life and I thought wow yeah I
[53:21] want to be a better Family Guy I want to
[53:23] be a better dad this will this will be
[53:24] good and I started to read the
[53:26] introduction because I wanted to know
[53:27] who the author was I wanted to know who
[53:28] this person was going to tell me how to
[53:30] be super dad
[53:31] and he writes all these thank yous the
[53:34] tributes to people and he says to to to
[53:37] Susie my my
[53:39] previous my my former wife
[53:44] um
[53:47] I kind of read it I'm like
[53:49] giving them benefit of doubt I thought
[53:50] maybe she's maybe she's buried
[53:54] maybe she's former that she's passed on
[53:56] and raised brother who never stops
[53:59] reaching out the hand of friendship
[54:01] towards me I'm like well that she's not
[54:03] buried
[54:04] This Woman This Woman they separated
[54:07] he's writing a whole book to tell me how
[54:10] to be a family man and he's a divorcee
[54:14] not not saying that there's not divorcee
[54:17] not not Grace for divorce his life not
[54:20] saying that that that the words of
[54:22] wisdom can come out of someone that has
[54:24] that in their past but here he is he's
[54:26] glorifying it he's saying she's still
[54:29] reaching out her hand and we're we're
[54:30] proud of this marital relationship or
[54:33] this former marital relationship well
[54:35] that book that book went right in the
[54:38] trash
[54:41] and um
[54:44] you know I
[54:46] you read certain marriage or a certain
[54:48] parenting advice and some of it goes
[54:50] more towards the side of psychology and
[54:51] I so appreciate it when I can find a
[54:54] parenting book that
[54:55] focuses on the word focuses on the
[54:58] nature that God's Building in the
[55:00] children
[55:01] be careful where you get advice is
[55:02] because it's not all created equal
[55:07] you know how about
[55:09] I'll just touch on this how about where
[55:11] you're getting your marriage
[55:12] relationship advice with
[55:16] brother Branham had something to say
[55:17] about that he says don't pay attention
[55:20] to the nonsense and these sexy books and
[55:22] the things that you read about
[55:24] and all this stuff and everything like
[55:28] that that was in 1965. don't pay
[55:31] attention to the nonsense and these sexy
[55:33] books and the things that you read about
[55:35] and all this stuff
[55:37] well all this stuff has become a whole
[55:40] lot more stuff since 1965. we're talking
[55:43] about there in the Thursday night
[55:44] meetings with the men all this stuff is
[55:47] becoming a problem for our generation
[55:49] and the accessibility of it it's no
[55:51] longer something you just pick up in the
[55:53] in the checkout line at the grocery
[55:55] store it's something that you have 24 7
[55:57] access to and all this stuff wants to
[56:01] completely warp your image of what a
[56:04] marriage relationship could be like
[56:07] and I want to tell you this if you've
[56:09] ever come into contact with the
[56:11] influence of the world whether it's in
[56:13] this category or any category that wants
[56:16] to like like like like my experience
[56:18] with with
[56:20] watching HGTV
[56:23] they wanted to warp my mind and for a
[56:25] few days I believe that the ultimate the
[56:28] ultimate goal was that log cabin in the
[56:30] mountains
[56:31] but then God's grace came to me
[56:35] and he changed my perception the whole
[56:37] thing
[56:38] and now what I saw it for was no longer
[56:41] the beautiful great wonderful Log Cabin
[56:44] surrounded by the mountains and having
[56:46] that experience
[56:49] but it was God's token Fellowship that
[56:52] he's given me with my wife
[56:54] and my family inside of our home
[57:01] so if you've come across to influence
[57:03] the world in these things
[57:05] God's grace still extends it's like
[57:08] Isaiah he when he saw the Lord high and
[57:10] lifted up in his train filled the temple
[57:12] he said
[57:14] oh I'm a man of unclean lips born from
[57:17] among unclean people but what did God do
[57:20] he took the coal fire and set it to the
[57:22] prophet's list and said now you're
[57:24] anointed for service
[57:28] so what's the solution then
[57:30] the Bible says be not drunk with wine
[57:33] we're in a success
[57:35] but be filled with the spirit
[57:39] amen there's there's what we fill
[57:41] ourselves with
[57:42] not the not the endless screens the
[57:45] world not the not the shoes on macarian
[57:47] or Marketplace not the not the clothes
[57:50] at JCPenney not the not the new DIY
[57:53] projects or I could go on and on
[57:56] because it literally doesn't end
[57:59] but to be filled with the spirit that
[58:01] word filled means to abound to furnace
[58:03] to fill up to satisfy
[58:06] like we talked about you were created by
[58:09] God
[58:10] only he knows how to satisfy your heart
[58:12] he is the only key your your heart will
[58:15] ever find
[58:16] he is the only one who will unlock the
[58:18] doors of of goodness to you
[58:21] and give that fruit of the spirit which
[58:23] is love joy peace long-suffering
[58:25] patience
[58:27] goodness meekness and temperance
[58:30] so how do you get there
[58:32] well it's real simple
[58:35] just love God more
[58:37] how do you get more of the spirit
[58:39] you just love God more
[58:42] Christ said if you abide in me and I in
[58:43] you
[58:44] he says abide to me and you'll have the
[58:46] Fruit of the Spirit
[58:48] but how do you how do you really abide
[58:50] in God
[58:52] well I'm not going to turn this into
[58:54] another hour sermon
[58:56] because it's a lot more simple than that
[58:58] it's just loving Jesus Christ
[59:03] they say well how do I do that brother
[59:05] Josiah
[59:06] well God's blessed every one of us here
[59:09] with relationships that we can use for
[59:12] insight you've got your relationship
[59:14] with your best friend maybe as a young
[59:16] person or you've got your relationship
[59:17] with your spouse you know how to build
[59:19] relationships
[59:21] you know that if you call your friend
[59:23] more often on the telephone
[59:26] and communicate with them that
[59:28] relationship grows
[59:31] if you share your heart with your wife
[59:33] and don't hold back and and talk to her
[59:36] that relationship grows in fact the the
[59:40] writer here in
[59:42] in the scripture in Ephesians the very
[59:44] next verse he says
[59:47] be filled with the spirit in the very
[59:49] next verse he says speaking to
[59:51] yourselves in Psalms and hymns and
[59:54] spiritual singing and making melody in
[59:56] your heart towards the Lord giving
[59:57] thanks
[59:59] for all things
[1:00:00] you know
[1:00:02] isn't that isn't that how it works with
[1:00:04] our relationships if I start thinking
[1:00:06] about my wife and
[1:00:08] thinking about her a little bit I
[1:00:10] I won't let you guys hear any of those
[1:00:12] songs but
[1:00:13] you know start thinking about her start
[1:00:15] kind of humming her Praises a little bit
[1:00:17] and you know telling you how wonderful
[1:00:19] she is and giving thanks a little bit it
[1:00:22] just doesn't build her up it builds her
[1:00:24] up inside of me it builds up that
[1:00:27] relationship
[1:00:29] and that's all he's saying here
[1:00:31] is
[1:00:33] hey
[1:00:34] don't be drunk with all these influences
[1:00:37] but be filled with the spirit
[1:00:40] and gender that relationship with Jesus
[1:00:42] Christ spend time with them
[1:00:46] and I I don't know how we we start doing
[1:00:49] it because it you know that if if you
[1:00:52] open the Pandora's box of electronic
[1:00:54] devices and if you open the if you've
[1:00:56] formed habits even even with book
[1:00:58] reading like we talked about there's a
[1:01:00] certain pathway that you just fall into
[1:01:02] maybe what you need is just a little bit
[1:01:06] of a fast a brain fast as it were and
[1:01:09] just set aside everything and say you
[1:01:11] know what I'm going to clean house but
[1:01:13] I'm not going to just stop there because
[1:01:14] I know the story of that man that swept
[1:01:16] his house and it went vacant and and
[1:01:19] seven demons worse than the first came
[1:01:21] back and I'm not going to just sweep my
[1:01:22] house but I'm Gonna Fill my house
[1:01:24] I'm not gonna just sweep my house of
[1:01:26] Hollywood and sweep my house of of
[1:01:28] social media but I'm Gonna Fill my house
[1:01:30] I'm Gonna Fill my house with singing and
[1:01:33] praises and I'm not going to just tell
[1:01:35] Alexa to do it for me I'm going to start
[1:01:36] doing it myself I'm going to start
[1:01:38] singing to the Lord myself I'm going to
[1:01:40] start singing his Praises myself
[1:01:42] oh Hallelujah there you bring the
[1:01:45] presence of God and he says oh now now I
[1:01:49] feel welcome in this place now this is a
[1:01:51] home I can step into and have fellowship
[1:01:53] with
[1:01:55] it's not just swept clean for me but
[1:01:57] it's furnished that's what that word
[1:02:00] filled with the spirit means to be
[1:02:01] furnished
[1:02:03] he says ma they've they've haven't just
[1:02:05] swept it clean but they've they've
[1:02:07] they've put out the chair for me and
[1:02:09] they've got the favorite blanket out and
[1:02:11] they've got a fire going and they they
[1:02:13] want to make my spirit comfortable
[1:02:15] that's a you ever you ever host somebody
[1:02:18] you ever just have somebody over you you
[1:02:20] don't you don't just have them over and
[1:02:22] when we turned off a TV for you
[1:02:25] that'd be a real good host
[1:02:27] you're laughing because you maybe you've
[1:02:30] had a horse like that I don't know
[1:02:32] but you just don't turn off a TV for
[1:02:34] them and consider that being a good host
[1:02:35] right
[1:02:36] you say well I know that they enjoy
[1:02:39] eating this and last time we had them
[1:02:42] over there they really commented on it
[1:02:44] so we're gonna we're gonna make them
[1:02:45] their special food or and we we know
[1:02:48] we're we're gonna turn the heat up a
[1:02:49] little bit because we know
[1:02:51] we know we kind of keep it cold around
[1:02:53] here but we can spend the extra 2.59
[1:02:56] today
[1:02:58] to turn the heat up a little bit and you
[1:03:01] do whatever you can to make your guests
[1:03:03] feel comfortable don't you
[1:03:06] friends
[1:03:08] if you feel rebuked tonight
[1:03:10] Christ isn't saying
[1:03:12] you're worthless
[1:03:16] little woman
[1:03:18] a little dishwasher woman your heart not
[1:03:21] even worth
[1:03:22] my time anymore
[1:03:24] he's not saying
[1:03:25] you've squandered what I've given you
[1:03:28] you've
[1:03:29] spent so much time looking at the world
[1:03:31] and
[1:03:33] he's not saying any of that
[1:03:35] through the sermon tonight he's saying I
[1:03:38] care about you enough to send you a
[1:03:39] preacher
[1:03:41] that's dealing with the same thing
[1:03:45] and to tell you
[1:03:46] that I want more time with you
[1:03:49] to tell you that I don't want
[1:03:53] another man having his way with my wife
[1:03:57] I don't want to see a man flirting with
[1:04:00] my wife
[1:04:02] and I'm sending that that this man
[1:04:05] tonight not just to rebuke you in love
[1:04:08] but rebuke that man that's been flirting
[1:04:11] with you that influence and to rebuke
[1:04:14] him hard
[1:04:15] because that's not when I speak straight
[1:04:17] about Hollywood and when I straight
[1:04:19] speak straight about the social media
[1:04:21] and things I'm not rebuking you I'm
[1:04:24] rebuking of that thing I'm rebuking that
[1:04:25] you that that man that's been flirting
[1:04:27] with the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:04:29] and I'm saying that man needs to go
[1:04:32] because it's hurting the relationship
[1:04:35] with God's bride you can't tell me when
[1:04:39] I can when I can watch a two-minute
[1:04:40] trailer video of of movies that I hear
[1:04:43] Believers say they watched and I have to
[1:04:46] shut it off halfway through the trailer
[1:04:48] you can't tell me that it's not hurting
[1:04:51] the relationship of the Bride of Jesus
[1:04:52] Christ when she begins to call that
[1:04:54] normal
[1:04:56] and you might justify it but Brother
[1:04:58] Bear him said in the in the sermon total
[1:05:00] different Deliverance he says there's
[1:05:01] something way down in the heart of a man
[1:05:04] that knows when he's wrong
[1:05:07] and if God's touching that part of your
[1:05:09] heart tonight can I just encourage you
[1:05:11] as musicians would come
[1:05:13] to respond to that
[1:05:18] to respond to it is not just a man with
[1:05:20] his opinions although I have mine
[1:05:23] and my journey is incomplete I'm still
[1:05:25] trying to
[1:05:27] plow the road for my family
[1:05:29] but I'm holding a key in my hand I'm I'm
[1:05:31] not I'm not shouting from from some
[1:05:34] place some Podium on high I'm down here
[1:05:36] in the prison house with you and I've
[1:05:39] got the the key in my hand and the cell
[1:05:41] door has been opened and I'm holding it
[1:05:42] I'm I'm running out the cell doors and
[1:05:45] I'm saying hey
[1:05:47] come with me
[1:05:50] don't stay locked up in this digital
[1:05:52] world
[1:05:53] don't stay locked up in screen time
[1:05:55] don't let that be your lot in life
[1:06:00] respond to Jesus Christ
[1:06:02] let more let him let more of him come
[1:06:05] into your life
[1:06:09] I wonder if we could stand this evening
[1:06:11] as they would play something Softly
[1:06:15] [Music]
[1:06:26] [Music]
[1:06:31] let's go before the Lord just a minute
[1:06:38] dear Lord
[1:06:43] I delivered my heart
[1:06:45] the words that you've given me Lord
[1:06:49] but now comes that special time in the
[1:06:51] service
[1:06:53] are we reserve just a small portion
[1:06:57] for your people to respond to you
[1:07:02] it's always such a special time to me
[1:07:04] Lord
[1:07:07] see how your bride
[1:07:09] responds to you after the word
[1:07:12] and I hope the people tonight can
[1:07:15] down to even the youngest one
[1:07:17] down to the most immature one
[1:07:20] I hope they can see tonight Lord
[1:07:22] that it's not
[1:07:25] them responding to my words Lord
[1:07:28] there would be a real feeling they've
[1:07:31] heard from you
[1:07:32] asking for more Fellowship Lord
[1:07:34] more relationship
[1:07:37] to get rid of the accursion thing
[1:07:40] cut off the influences to make sure that
[1:07:43] the token is applied to their phone
[1:07:46] applied to the
[1:07:48] entrances into their heart
[1:07:53] [Music]
[1:07:56] friends I wonder if you would just leave
[1:07:58] a little space this evening for the Lord
[1:07:59] did
[1:08:00] speak to your heart
[1:08:06] [Music]
[1:08:12] you're a fool
[1:08:15] if you think this sermon doesn't touch
[1:08:19] some aspect of your life
[1:08:22] if not your life and
[1:08:24] someone in your family that you may have
[1:08:27] responsibility for or have influence
[1:08:29] with
[1:08:31] [Music]
[1:08:32] I don't know that I would
[1:08:34] know anyone in this generation
[1:08:39] that wouldn't
[1:08:40] hear this call of the Lord say
[1:08:43] I want more of you
[1:08:45] and less it influence the world
[1:08:48] now how much you've let the world come
[1:08:50] and influence you that's between you and
[1:08:51] God
[1:08:52] how much you've got to scrape out of
[1:08:55] your heart that's between you and God
[1:08:56] but God is able
[1:08:58] God is able to thoroughly Purge your
[1:09:01] heart friends of every influence
[1:09:03] and to fill you up with his spirit
[1:09:07] but I wonder if you desire that tonight
[1:09:10] I wonder if there would be any honest
[1:09:13] hearts that would just lift their hands
[1:09:15] tonight
[1:09:16] [Music]
[1:09:17] and say Lord that's
[1:09:19] that's my desire
[1:09:21] to change to change the way things have
[1:09:25] been going to change the direction of
[1:09:27] things
[1:09:29] to change how much importance I put upon
[1:09:32] friends and Facebook social media
[1:09:35] to change how much importance I put upon
[1:09:39] the Council of the world
[1:09:41] [Music]
[1:09:43] and to really start bearing my face in
[1:09:46] the word
[1:09:47] and letting myself be changed in a
[1:09:49] greater way from Glory into Glory
[1:09:54] [Music]
[1:09:57] God bless those Honest Hearts
[1:10:00] I believe the Lord sees those tonight
[1:10:01] [Music]
[1:10:07] I would be anyone that would like to
[1:10:08] come forward for prayer with your pastor
[1:10:10] brother Paul tonight as I am just close
[1:10:13] out the sermon
[1:10:15] foreign
