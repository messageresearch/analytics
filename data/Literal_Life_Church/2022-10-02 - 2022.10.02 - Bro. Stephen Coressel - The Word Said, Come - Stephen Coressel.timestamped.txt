[1:13] uh
[1:15] Matthew 14 and verse 28.
[1:19] the scripture reads and Peter answered
[1:21] him and said Lord if it be thou bid me
[1:24] come unto thee on the water
[1:26] and he said come and when Peter was come
[1:28] down out of the ship he walked on the
[1:31] water to go to Jesus I'm going to preach
[1:34] a message this morning called the word
[1:35] said come
[1:37] the word said come
[1:40] power hits word prayer
[1:42] most gracious kind Heavenly Father we
[1:44] thank you Lord for your grace and your
[1:45] mercy this morning Lord as we gather
[1:48] together as the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:50] Lord we do look within ourselves and we
[1:53] find insufficiency with our own flesh
[1:56] but Lord when we look into your word and
[1:59] we look at what the promises you've
[2:01] given to us Lord you have made us more
[2:04] than able Lord
[2:06] for this time that you put us in Lord
[2:08] for such as time is this Lord you have
[2:11] given an extra dose of grace to the
[2:13] bride to help us Lord to handle this
[2:17] this moment of time that we're in Lord
[2:19] we all come from different walks of life
[2:22] different struggles different battles
[2:24] but Lord you have ordained this time oh
[2:27] God
[2:28] you said the preaching to the Cross is
[2:30] to them that perish foolishness but to
[2:33] us Lord that believe it is the power of
[2:36] God
[2:37] Lord the power of God to meet each need
[2:39] this morning Lord God
[2:41] I believe Lord that you can meet each
[2:44] need Lord there's not a need too hard
[2:46] for you Lord this morning and I pray in
[2:49] the name of Jesus you will anoint us all
[2:52] Lord to fulfill thy will God
[2:55] Lord I'm praying right now may not a
[2:58] sick person leave this building this
[2:59] morning Lord may not a doubt Lord remain
[3:03] after this service Lord God I pray if a
[3:06] soul doesn't have the Holy Ghost I pray
[3:09] you reach out this morning Lord and you
[3:11] will meet them Lord and show them
[3:14] desperation of how much they need you
[3:17] Lord
[3:18] I believe Lord you'll meet each need
[3:21] this morning God may we all step aside
[3:23] Lord and allow the Holy Ghost to use us
[3:26] this morning God we're asking you now
[3:29] for it and dear and in the name of our
[3:31] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ the bride
[3:33] say together
[3:34] amen God bless you may be seated
[3:39] and like I said I'm going to preach a
[3:41] little message called the word
[3:42] said come
[3:44] the word
[3:46] said come
[3:47] and it's really neat how the Bible is
[3:50] written and how the Bible though is
[3:53] written hundred years ago and and
[3:55] there's a lot of stories that sometimes
[3:57] can be hard to maybe understand in one
[4:00] sense and it uses those vows and and all
[4:03] those different Old English words and so
[4:04] forth it's amazing that the Bible is
[4:07] written in such a way that it not just
[4:09] speak to the time it was written but it
[4:11] speaks to all generations and all
[4:14] peoples and I think God set it up like
[4:16] that because he knew we were going to
[4:18] need something amen these stories that
[4:20] you read in the Bible and so forth and
[4:22] happen to individuals they were not
[4:24] there just for you to look at and go oh
[4:27] that's neat what happened to them but
[4:29] it's to encourage you to understand that
[4:31] God can do the same thing for you
[4:34] when you read about what Moses went
[4:36] through what David went through well all
[4:39] these Bible characters went through amen
[4:41] they're not just supposed to stay on the
[4:43] pages amen you don't read the Bible like
[4:46] a newspaper amen the prophet of God
[4:49] taught us that but when we read the
[4:51] Bible we're going Lord if you did it for
[4:53] them you'd do it for me
[4:56] amen
[4:57] oh my and so I want to go over this
[5:01] particular story
[5:02] and I want to and I want what I want to
[5:05] do this morning is parallel it to our
[5:07] day amen oh it's just neat how God set
[5:10] up the Bible like that amen if you kept
[5:13] I told you keep your fingers there right
[5:14] Matthew 14 amen we're going to read
[5:16] about Jesus walking on the water amen
[5:19] and just before this he does a mighty
[5:21] Miracle he feeds 5 000 people with two
[5:24] fishes and and some loaves amen and we
[5:27] get to this point of the scripture here
[5:29] where it says in verse 22 we're going to
[5:31] start in verse 22.
[5:33] and keep you there because I'm going to
[5:35] be going back and forth amen Matthew 14
[5:38] verse 22 I want to read this because I
[5:40] want to start I want you to start seeing
[5:42] yourself in the scripture
[5:45] amen
[5:46] and I hope I can encourage you this
[5:48] morning
[5:49] and straightway Jesus constrained his
[5:52] disciples to get into a Gospel Ship if
[5:54] you will amen that's what we've been
[5:56] sailing on too amen a Gospel Ship amen
[6:00] remember a ship's got a destination
[6:02] you're not here just to sit in the Pew
[6:04] and then go home later we got a
[6:06] destination
[6:08] amen that's why we're all participants
[6:11] two million people sitting on the
[6:13] sideline you got a job to do not just a
[6:16] preacher amen we all got a job to do
[6:20] because we're on this Gospel Ship we got
[6:22] a destination we're going somewhere
[6:24] there's an end to all of this be
[6:27] encouraged the world's not going to keep
[6:28] going on like this I mean how could it
[6:31] at this point
[6:34] amen how could it keep going on you got
[6:37] a destination
[6:39] and straight away Jesus constrained his
[6:40] disciples to get into a ship and to go
[6:43] before him unto the other side while he
[6:45] sent the multitude his way and when he
[6:47] has sent the multitudes away he went up
[6:49] to a mountain of Park to pray amen maybe
[6:52] to intercede for some people amen when
[6:54] Jesus Christ died on a cross where did
[6:56] he go he went above where they were
[6:59] just like in this store he goes up to a
[7:01] mountain to intercede for them amen
[7:04] that's what Christ did for us amen
[7:08] amen and when the evening was come he
[7:12] was there alone kind of like the evening
[7:13] time if you will
[7:15] verse 24 but the ship was now in the
[7:18] midst of the sea tossed through waves
[7:20] for the wind was contrary Winds of
[7:22] Doctrine started blowing in
[7:24] opinions started blowing in
[7:27] thoughts and and emotions and people
[7:30] trying to figure things out
[7:35] there's nothing wrong with trying to
[7:37] understand things but when it starts
[7:39] taking the place of Faith you've missed
[7:42] something
[7:44] amen remember this amen we need God more
[7:48] in this day than any other age brother
[7:50] made up said that we have to have more
[7:52] faith today than we've ever had why our
[7:56] bodies have got to change
[8:00] what do we deal in our age well here we
[8:03] go okay what do we deal in our age in
[8:05] the four I know raps going over the
[8:07] church ages each Church age had their
[8:09] own battle
[8:10] during the especially during the four
[8:12] Church age brother Ben taught us as the
[8:13] Dark Ages and during that time you had
[8:16] to seal your testimony with your own
[8:17] blood
[8:19] I tell you what if somebody puts a sword
[8:21] in your neck and says you're going to
[8:22] believe God or not or I've got your head
[8:24] off you don't announce Christ guess what
[8:25] you have far few Hypocrites during that
[8:27] time
[8:30] far few hypocrites
[8:32] but that's not our day
[8:35] that's not the battle we deal with
[8:37] what's the laodicea church age what do
[8:39] we deal with lukewarmness
[8:43] lukewarmness brother bam said thinking
[8:46] you're a Christian when you're not
[8:48] it's your brother Steve you're making me
[8:50] a little scared you shouldn't be Peter
[8:51] said Baker Colony election sure
[8:54] you ought to know whether you're going
[8:55] to make it or not
[8:57] many Christians are wondering where
[8:58] they'll be in the Rapture you ought to
[9:00] know you'll be in the rapture
[9:04] I asked a guy one time at what when I
[9:06] when I was a young kid I asked him I
[9:08] said are you going to heaven or hell
[9:09] he said well I got a 50 50 shot don't I
[9:13] I said boy I'm so glad I don't serve
[9:16] your God
[9:17] only give me a 50 chance no God gave you
[9:20] a promise
[9:22] and you can know today whether you'd be
[9:25] in the Rapture or not
[9:27] and I'm gonna say like this you ought to
[9:31] you you're better
[9:32] it's not just said it's not just good
[9:35] enough to believe you got the token you
[9:37] got to know that you know that you know
[9:40] that you got the token brother Stephen
[9:42] I'm at the Holy Ghost for 29 years then
[9:44] you better make sure 29 and a day
[9:47] then you better make sure 29 in two days
[9:50] you better make sure this ain't worth
[9:53] the message amen
[9:54] [Applause]
[9:58] you're not hurting God's feelings
[9:59] checking
[10:02] hey man this is worth more than life
[10:07] this is worth more than your job
[10:11] uh oh oh I might get in trouble Paul
[10:13] this morning but
[10:15] it's just more important than all the
[10:16] money you got
[10:22] oh my
[10:25] sometimes we do get too comfortable
[10:27] don't we listen I am preaching to you
[10:29] know a bunch of well I'm preaching one
[10:31] African I guess there but I see your
[10:33] brother Mike
[10:35] but yo we are in America
[10:38] brother Stephen why do we always get
[10:39] preached on like this because this is
[10:41] what we deal with
[10:42] getting lazy lukewarm that's why we keep
[10:45] powering the pulpit
[10:48] you and Billy bear said why these people
[10:50] get weak it's because of weak pulpits
[10:53] you ought to thank God you got a pastor
[10:55] you got to thank God you got a five-fold
[10:57] who's willing to tell you
[10:59] [Applause]
[11:06] brother ramstead of pastors ordained of
[11:08] God to lead you into a rapture
[11:11] yeah well that scriptural Ephesians 4
[11:13] tells us that the five-fold is going to
[11:16] bring us unto the statue of a perfect
[11:18] man
[11:20] oh I don't like those preachers too bad
[11:23] I I mean I don't know what to tell you
[11:25] you better figure something out it's
[11:26] God's ordained way
[11:31] amen you love the Lord
[11:35] oh my it's getting to the evening time
[11:38] ain't it
[11:39] the Bible talks about Zechariah about
[11:41] the evening time
[11:42] that's going to be a time that's either
[11:44] light nor dark
[11:46] but it's a gray time
[11:49] just good enough to be a Christian
[11:50] lukewarmness
[11:52] just hot enough
[11:54] to sit and appeal
[11:56] just and listen all that stuff's great
[11:59] you should pay your ties you should show
[12:02] up here this morning
[12:03] you should be worshiping God that's all
[12:05] great you ought to be doing that
[12:08] but don't let Satan trick you in
[12:10] thinking that's it
[12:13] being on fire means you can light
[12:16] somebody else oh that was so good right
[12:19] there if you're just a little lukewarm
[12:21] match you can't light nothing else if
[12:23] but if you're on fire some other Soul
[12:26] can find out about God
[12:29] [Applause]
[12:30] be on fire so much that even if you're
[12:34] the only lick there you can light the
[12:37] whole place Ablaze
[12:42] you know what the Bible says the Bible
[12:44] says quench not the spirit
[12:47] you know what that word quench means to
[12:49] extinguish a flame
[12:51] I've said this brother Paul I said we
[12:53] got too many firemen in the church
[12:54] sometimes
[12:57] too many firemen be on fire so much that
[13:00] if you're the only one in your church on
[13:02] Sunday morning you can light the whole
[13:03] place Ablaze
[13:09] don't be so scared
[13:11] don't be so scared
[13:13] don't you we'll know if there's a wrong
[13:15] spear in the church we got the Holy
[13:16] Ghost with us
[13:18] don't worry so much well I might be
[13:20] controlled by a contrary Spirit Well no
[13:22] don't worry about that
[13:24] you're a child of God
[13:26] don't act like a serpentine you ain't
[13:28] Serpentine you're a child of God
[13:31] the Bible says in Luke 11
[13:33] if a son asks for his father for bread
[13:35] would he give him a stone
[13:38] if he asked for an egg would he give him
[13:40] a scorpion
[13:41] if you then being evil know how to give
[13:44] good gifts how much more shall my
[13:46] heavenly father give them the holy ghost
[13:48] that ask of me
[13:51] so don't act is he your dad
[13:54] is he your father then when you ask him
[13:57] for something he's going to give it to
[13:59] you
[14:01] while you're hungry
[14:02] can I can I say something the prophet of
[14:05] God in 65 said he was hungry for more
[14:08] God
[14:11] he was hungry for more God he said I
[14:14] want to see God more in my life and you
[14:16] think what this is William Branham he
[14:20] saw it all and yet he wants more how
[14:23] much more should the bride be crying out
[14:29] and we're gonna find out when you cry
[14:31] out he said come
[14:35] you can have it
[14:37] we always ask God with this thing in the
[14:40] back of their mind thinking what if it
[14:42] don't happen
[14:45] I'm gonna use that in your mind you'll
[14:47] go well what if well you know maybe it's
[14:49] not my time maybe it's this maybe it's
[14:51] that we do so much reasoning
[14:54] worrying so much
[14:56] well brother Paul we're here I'm sorry
[14:58] brother Paul it's supposed to go a
[15:00] little differently but worry so much
[15:03] it's ready
[15:07] Simon his word
[15:12] perfect love cast out all fear
[15:17] you need to when you start feeling that
[15:19] fear creep into your heart you know what
[15:22] it is you know what it is
[15:24] think about it if I've always said it
[15:27] like this we always sometimes pray Lord
[15:29] if I could just have more faith I if I
[15:31] could just muster off more faith I could
[15:34] finally believe God
[15:36] and you sit there and I want to ask you
[15:38] a question
[15:39] if you're a believer of God why wouldn't
[15:41] you believe
[15:44] why wouldn't you I mean did God make
[15:47] everything
[15:49] you made your body didn't you
[15:52] yeah he he made other chairs you're
[15:53] sitting in today
[15:55] he made the light shining on me he made
[15:56] the air can he made it all
[15:58] so if he made all that and he promised
[16:01] you something why would you worry why
[16:04] wouldn't you believe
[16:05] you see what I'm saying
[16:07] we always try to muster up stuff why
[16:10] don't you get in the word and be
[16:11] convinced of God
[16:13] Abraham said he believed God because he
[16:16] was convinced that he was able to do
[16:18] what he said
[16:22] and we're going to find out in this
[16:24] story amen he gave you a promise
[16:27] you you're not alone
[16:30] he's coming to you
[16:33] he's coming to you here let me try to
[16:35] get back to this
[16:36] verse 24 but the ship was now in the
[16:38] midst of the sea tossed her away for the
[16:40] wind was contrary those false doctrines
[16:42] I know we hear all this stuff all the
[16:44] time we're message people I've been
[16:46] around you message people for a couple
[16:47] years all right
[16:49] yeah you'll hear one little thing and
[16:52] it'll just disrupt somebody hear one
[16:54] little thing always tossed about
[16:57] always tossed about I'm not necessarily
[16:59] blaming you what I'm telling you is
[17:01] there's a source you can go to where you
[17:03] don't have to be so tossed about
[17:06] you hear this one opinion and you think
[17:08] oh maybe that's right maybe maybe I'm
[17:10] the maybe God's leading me this
[17:12] direction maybe God's leading me that
[17:13] direction
[17:15] I've always said like this you want to
[17:16] know God's will for your life
[17:18] you want to know what God's will for
[17:19] your life it's easy
[17:21] you know what you should do
[17:23] go ask him
[17:27] go ask him oh brother rap I'm stealing
[17:29] God of your thunder from the church
[17:30] agent so you forgive me for this already
[17:31] amen but but you know what you know what
[17:34] brother Ram said he said God can talk
[17:38] and you think what does he have to say
[17:40] something like that he actually says it
[17:41] a couple times in a couple sermons you
[17:43] go home and you look in your search
[17:45] engine because I can't remember the
[17:46] exact circuit off top my head right now
[17:47] but he literally says God can talk
[17:50] amen and you know what brother bear said
[17:52] in the church age book he said when when
[17:54] when when Satan was trying to get
[17:56] worship directed to him he did it in
[17:58] stages he didn't do it immediately he
[18:01] did it in stages the first stage was to
[18:03] bring Trinity Doctrine father-son Holy
[18:05] Ghost he said but that wasn't good
[18:06] enough so that he transformed into
[18:08] father mother son and he started
[18:11] transferring into more of that worship
[18:12] of that but then he said Satan was still
[18:15] not content so what he had to do next
[18:17] was to convince the people that God was
[18:20] silent
[18:22] and that he was the silent God matter of
[18:24] fact he said in India they have temples
[18:25] today to the silent God remember in the
[18:27] book of Acts 16 Mars to the unknown God
[18:30] this was a thing so Satan was convincing
[18:33] him that the father oh he's just a
[18:35] silent God he's not really concerned
[18:36] with you and so that's what moved
[18:38] worship to the mother and son now
[18:41] into modern-day Catholicism but the
[18:44] first step he had to convince the people
[18:45] God was
[18:47] and I'm here to bust that up this
[18:50] morning amen God ain't silent God can
[18:53] talk Cayman
[18:56] God still speaks
[19:00] he can talk he can talk behind the
[19:02] pulpit
[19:03] amen he can talk in a song
[19:06] he can talk in a still Small Voice in
[19:08] your heart you remember the story
[19:09] brother bam about Joseph he's never said
[19:11] it was a voice he never said it was a
[19:13] vision it was something spoke to his
[19:15] heart he was going to have a son and his
[19:17] name was Joseph it took two kids after
[19:20] that but it finally came didn't it it
[19:22] can happen like that it can also happen
[19:25] get ready for this you ready for this
[19:26] now it can happen lip to ear
[19:30] I believe God can talk do you God can
[19:33] speak directly to you
[19:38] know what the Bible says the Bible says
[19:40] that you don't even need a man to teach
[19:42] you now I know people have took him that
[19:44] far but we're not taking it too far
[19:46] see you see what happens a lot of times
[19:47] people will quote a scripture and you go
[19:49] oh yeah but what about this over here
[19:51] it's still scripture
[19:52] we still gotta face it
[19:54] of course he's not getting rid of
[19:56] teachers his point is this is that when
[19:59] the word comes forth you have something
[20:01] in you
[20:03] that tells you that's the word
[20:05] so it's not really the man teaching you
[20:08] it's word meaning word
[20:13] brother Stephen I'd so like to read that
[20:16] I'm glad you asked that
[20:17] because it's in first John 2. let's read
[20:19] it together
[20:21] first John 2.
[20:26] let's see if I can find it let's test my
[20:28] brain I feel so at home here brother
[20:30] Paul sometimes I can do stuff like this
[20:31] you know
[20:32] sometimes you get nervous you know did I
[20:34] get the right scripture
[20:36] yeah I did
[20:40] I love you all so much
[20:45] watches here
[20:49] let's just start first John 2 verse 18.
[20:51] watch this here first John 2. and verse
[20:53] 18. the scripture reads little children
[20:55] it is the last time amen as you have
[20:59] heard that the Antichrist shall come
[21:00] even now are there many antichrists
[21:02] whereby we know that it is the last time
[21:04] amen they went out from us but they were
[21:07] not of us for if they had been of us
[21:09] they would no doubt have continued with
[21:11] us
[21:12] but they went out that they might be
[21:14] made manifested they were not all of us
[21:16] watch this here but ye see you're
[21:18] different than that group we just read
[21:20] we just read about a group that went out
[21:23] and they would have continued us but ye
[21:26] have an ump
[21:28] from the Holy One and you know
[21:31] some of the things
[21:34] you know half the things you know it all
[21:37] you're a bunch of no-walls know what
[21:38] else
[21:39] with the Holy Ghost you are yeah but see
[21:42] here's his point he gets to you have an
[21:44] unction what does that mean it's more
[21:46] than just something from the outside
[21:48] pouring in an unction means something
[21:50] from within you
[21:51] that's screaming out do you know what
[21:53] that word unction is it's the same
[21:55] hearty words jump down to verse 27.
[21:59] but the unction
[22:01] go look it up for yourself that word
[22:03] unction is the same word for anointing
[22:06] but the anointing which you have
[22:08] received from abideth in you and you
[22:11] need not that any man teach you but as
[22:14] the same anointing teaches you all
[22:16] things you see the anointing is teaching
[22:19] you so when I speak the word there's an
[22:22] anointing in you that comes back and
[22:24] says yup that's the word and that is
[22:28] what's going to save your soul
[22:32] that right there what I just did we
[22:35] think it's so small sometimes in this
[22:37] church but do you understand that's
[22:39] what's going to Rapture you
[22:42] when the same word cries and says it's
[22:45] time to come up higher that anointing
[22:49] Union's gonna say it's time to go up
[22:51] higher
[22:53] [Applause]
[22:55] that's why we come to church
[22:57] that's why we get under the anointing
[22:58] we're getting ready
[23:00] come up and get ready Jesus is coming
[23:04] soon
[23:05] you see why that's so important to
[23:08] understand about yourself
[23:10] when you got saved it wasn't it wasn't
[23:13] just that night you went to the altar
[23:16] you were in the mind of God before the
[23:18] foundations of the world
[23:20] and because God knew you were going to
[23:23] receive it he placed that something in
[23:26] you
[23:27] so that when the word would come it
[23:29] bring it to life
[23:31] when it rains on the crops only the
[23:33] light comes brother Brandy even taught
[23:36] us that the reason why the rain comes is
[23:38] because it's to bring life out but if it
[23:40] rains on a bunch of just dirt it doesn't
[23:42] do anything
[23:43] no life comes out of that but if there's
[23:45] a seed there
[23:46] now it comes to Quicken everything
[23:49] but God's only coming back for a certain
[23:51] time to life
[23:52] you say brother Stephen how do I know if
[23:54] I'm that light how do I know if I'm that
[23:56] predestinated amen it's all based on
[23:59] faith listen we don't have the book I
[24:02] don't have the black book to tell me yep
[24:04] you're a bride foolish nothing bride
[24:07] foolish version nothing I don't have the
[24:09] book guess what neither do you
[24:11] so quite acting like you got the book
[24:13] sometimes okay that was just free right
[24:15] there we won't go too far into that but
[24:17] okay but if I haven't just don't act
[24:19] like you got the book either
[24:21] but how do you say but brother Stephen
[24:23] how do I know I'm the bride look at what
[24:26] you're doing right now
[24:28] you're sitting here in a message church
[24:29] hearing the word of God you want the
[24:32] word of God in your life nobody told you
[24:35] to do that you could easily go down to
[24:37] church I drove ads a bunch of churches
[24:39] on the way here you could easily go
[24:40] there but yes something tells you
[24:42] they come here
[24:45] what is that that's that's something
[24:47] that's going to change your life it will
[24:49] change your body amen
[24:52] [Applause]
[24:55] let's never let's never never devalue
[24:59] the Holy Ghost
[25:03] don't ever forget that
[25:05] I'm gonna try to get to that here in a
[25:06] second I got some more points I did want
[25:08] to make but let's see what happens but
[25:11] with a ship in verse 24 there
[25:13] but the ship was now in the midst of the
[25:15] sea tossed with waves
[25:17] for the wind was contrary
[25:20] and in the fourth seal I mean Fourth
[25:22] Watch sorry
[25:24] uh did I interject that a little bit
[25:27] but on the fourth watch of the night
[25:29] Jesus went unto them
[25:31] now remember this is Jesus went down to
[25:33] them walking on the water
[25:36] now you don't see this every day do you
[25:38] brother Gideon
[25:40] somebody walking on the water that's
[25:42] pretty Supernatural
[25:44] you know what brother bam said actually
[25:46] brother I know I can send you those
[25:48] quotes is that first quote
[25:49] I mean you know I'm just got brother bam
[25:51] say for you it's in Jehovah Jireh number
[25:54] two if you can bring that up for
[25:55] everybody
[25:55] I think I sent it to you brother being
[25:57] said in Jehovah Jireh number two I
[26:01] wanted you to see brother bam say it
[26:03] yeah God always
[26:07] how much
[26:09] always is Supernatural
[26:12] Works in Supernatural as long as there
[26:15] is a God there there is Supernatural if
[26:19] it's Jehovah God
[26:21] now I want you to understand this sermon
[26:23] tends to turn into a more of a unders
[26:25] more understanding of the supernatural
[26:27] I've preached this a couple times but
[26:29] we're bringing it here this morning amen
[26:31] is that the supernatural we we always
[26:34] try to figure it Supernatural out you
[26:37] can't figure out Supernatural with
[26:40] natural things I can't take Supernatural
[26:43] and stick it between two glasses and put
[26:45] it under a microscope and Jesus
[26:47] there's the supernatural
[26:49] there's no there's no grabbing it
[26:51] there's no molding it there but it's
[26:54] still real
[26:56] it's still evident you think about this
[26:59] all healing is Supernatural
[27:02] brother bam taught us that a doctor can
[27:05] send a bone but he can't actually heal
[27:06] it
[27:07] you say but brother Stephen I took a
[27:09] pill that pill had been made from
[27:11] something
[27:12] it's made from some sort of chemical
[27:14] well who decided that chemical is what
[27:16] actually makes your head feel better I
[27:17] don't know if you hate headaches but I
[27:19] hate headaches too
[27:20] and I look and it's when I get a really
[27:22] bad headache I take some ibuprofen well
[27:25] who decided ibuprofen was what was going
[27:27] to make my head feel better
[27:29] well the doctor set it up yeah but the
[27:31] doctor didn't decide that that certain
[27:33] chemical would make me feel better God
[27:34] decided that so see God is still the
[27:37] Healer now
[27:39] you want to let's get all this science
[27:41] stuff out of our brain for a second let
[27:42] me give you a there's a really neat
[27:44] parable about this one time a scientist
[27:45] went up to God
[27:47] and the scientists said God we can do
[27:50] anything you can do
[27:52] oh really God said
[27:54] yeah we can even make a person
[27:57] and God said okay go ahead
[27:59] so the scientists went down he went and
[28:02] grabbed some dirt
[28:03] and God said uh get your own dirt
[28:07] [Laughter]
[28:15] when they come up with all these
[28:16] scientific theories who decided it would
[28:19] work like that anyways
[28:21] the dirt still came from God the Stars
[28:23] still come from God all this stuff still
[28:26] comes from God the whole world's made of
[28:29] Supernatural
[28:31] it's not a strange thing the
[28:33] supernatural in one sense okay you know
[28:36] they even proven that healing's
[28:37] Supernatural I know there's some doctors
[28:38] and nurses in here and stuff there's a
[28:40] medical term called a placebo you know
[28:42] what that is
[28:43] it's a placebo is a thing where they'll
[28:45] hand you something and the doctor says
[28:47] yup this if you take this you will feel
[28:49] better
[28:50] it can be nothing but a sweet tart
[28:55] you know they take the sweet tart but
[28:57] because they believe that sweet tart was
[28:59] medicine they'll start to feel better
[29:01] it's called a placebo there was nothing
[29:03] in it so what actually is the healing
[29:05] now
[29:06] was it the pill
[29:08] see it's supernatural it's Faith it's
[29:11] the supernatural
[29:13] you see and I think as Christians
[29:15] sometimes and I'm just getting it right
[29:17] to America now remember I'm not
[29:19] preaching to Germans I'm not preaching
[29:20] to Africa I'm preaching to us here in
[29:22] America it's easiest for for us for to
[29:25] forget the necessity of Supernatural in
[29:30] your life
[29:32] and I'm not necessarily throwing you the
[29:33] bus I'm the first to throw myself under
[29:34] the bus
[29:36] amen we always do those things right we
[29:38] always try to figure things out we got a
[29:40] bunch of science we got a bunch of
[29:41] websites they could tell us all these
[29:42] things and yet we sometimes forget the
[29:45] necessity of Supernatural
[29:47] of when God comes on the scene he can
[29:50] and I'm not even talking about
[29:51] supernatural people always can play
[29:53] Supernatural jumping up and down jumping
[29:55] up and down anybody can jump up and down
[29:57] I'm talking about when God comes and
[29:58] changes you
[30:00] now when God comes and does his
[30:02] Supernatural there might be some jumping
[30:04] up and down
[30:05] I get excited when he's on the scene
[30:07] doing something right Boaz I get excited
[30:10] when he does something some people sit
[30:11] there and cry something who cares about
[30:13] all that stuff let's just see God
[30:15] working Our Lives
[30:20] everybody fussing about everything and
[30:23] yet we got dead people who can be raised
[30:25] again we got people with cancer that can
[30:28] be healed
[30:28] [Applause]
[30:30] tired this social
[30:32] trying to figure out every little thing
[30:34] and things like that let's have God come
[30:36] on the scene and allow the supernatural
[30:38] to do something
[30:43] don't be so scared of Supernatural
[30:46] people always get what do you mean
[30:48] Brothers you my Supernatural it
[30:49] shouldn't be like that
[30:51] we're Christians we're the bride
[30:54] amen the Holy Ghost is Supernatural
[30:58] brother if you got that quote it's here
[31:00] ye him it's that third quote 62.
[31:03] and I believe that God
[31:06] and every age sending forth a messenger
[31:08] always first meet the people on sacred
[31:11] ground because it's got to be sold
[31:13] there's too much of evil to try to
[31:15] explain all the supernatural away
[31:18] and where there's a supernatural God
[31:21] there's going to be Supernatural seeds
[31:27] can I say something here I'm gonna I'm
[31:28] gonna break this quote down for you a
[31:29] little bit okay things you know what a
[31:31] thing is it's something you can hold
[31:34] this is a thing
[31:37] you want to mean emotion isn't
[31:39] necessarily a thing he's talking about
[31:40] when God's on the seed Supernatural
[31:43] things happen
[31:45] I'm tired of people just thinking if you
[31:48] scream Supernatural happen I'm not
[31:50] saying you ain't going to stream but I
[31:52] want to see things happen
[31:56] they even after the screaming they're
[31:59] living a different life
[32:03] there's something happen to them they're
[32:05] praying all of a sudden now they're
[32:07] seeking God more something changed in
[32:10] them I want to see Supernatural things
[32:14] have been amen
[32:16] somebody who walked in you with cancer
[32:18] and leaves healed things happen amen
[32:25] oh I feel so good I can speak in tongues
[32:27] Hallelujah
[32:30] that's what I want to see happen
[32:35] sometimes we just stop and don't go on
[32:38] that's what can hinder you too
[32:40] amen
[32:44] let's go on
[32:46] let's actually have those things in our
[32:49] hands
[32:50] she said brother Stephen am I allowed to
[32:52] huh boy I'm so glad you asked
[32:55] let's keep reading this story in Matthew
[32:57] 14.
[32:59] in verse 25.
[33:02] you love the Lord
[33:04] God surely is good to us ain't he
[33:06] who
[33:08] man I don't know that was all about I
[33:09] gotta Catch My Breath a little bit
[33:11] praise the Lord
[33:13] we need more of this in our life
[33:15] do you do you understand where blood
[33:17] Stephen's heart's coming from
[33:19] sometimes it feels like Supernatural is
[33:22] the last thing we think about
[33:25] something you know medical happen you
[33:27] try to figure out medical reason not
[33:29] saying any of that stuff's bad I love
[33:31] doctors just much the next person
[33:33] there's nothing wrong with that but
[33:35] Supernatural Faith ought to be the first
[33:37] thing
[33:39] do you see what I'm saying
[33:40] we should start leaning on God
[33:43] do you know what it means when you're
[33:45] leaning on something
[33:47] when you're truly leaning on something
[33:49] you know what that means that means if
[33:51] that thing would fail you would fall
[33:54] down
[33:55] some people are too busy standing
[33:57] straight up what if
[33:59] what if
[34:01] what if you know brother Bam's talked
[34:03] about that one story I think he was over
[34:05] in Africa you forgive me if I get the
[34:07] details wrong but he met a person who
[34:09] was supposedly converted to Christianity
[34:11] but they still had that Idol I think it
[34:13] was Macaulay or something I can't
[34:14] remember the exact terms to use like I
[34:17] said why are you still carrying that
[34:18] idle around if you're a believer of
[34:19] Jesus he said well just in case Jesus
[34:21] fails I got this
[34:23] now see we we condemned that we go look
[34:26] at that that'd be terrible but some of
[34:28] us do that with our phones
[34:30] someone's do that with internet websites
[34:34] see when you're truly leaning on
[34:36] something
[34:37] if it would fail you would fall that's
[34:40] how much you need to lean on the
[34:41] supernatural
[34:42] leaning on faith leaning on God
[34:46] if you're not sold get sold
[34:48] listen we got testimonies Galore to tell
[34:52] us that God is faithful that God never
[34:54] fails we are surrounded by so great
[34:57] cloud of witnesses let us put aside
[35:00] every sin and wait not just sin but
[35:04] every weight that would take us away
[35:06] from the gospel of Christ
[35:08] it's not just sins that get in the way
[35:10] it could just be a a burden a way that
[35:13] you've been trying to carry yourself
[35:14] what did he say he said come unto me
[35:17] oh ye that are heavy laden and I will
[35:21] give you rest
[35:24] rest you know important rest is in your
[35:26] life
[35:28] rest is so important you know how
[35:29] important rest is
[35:31] God even told us to have the ground rest
[35:34] remember the law you had to plant the
[35:37] ground for six days but on the seventh
[35:38] day you'll let the Earth rest
[35:41] ain't that something
[35:42] God even tells you give the earth a rest
[35:44] it needs it
[35:46] do you know how important rest is rest
[35:48] is so important even God did it
[35:53] God has Infinite Strength don't he what
[35:56] do you mean he gets tired he needed a
[35:57] rest the Bible says he rested on the
[35:59] seventh day from all of his works
[36:03] and yeah we sit there just try to figure
[36:05] every little thing out you need to start
[36:07] resting in the promises of God
[36:10] when you're right when you're leaning on
[36:12] something which you fall if it fail
[36:16] you sold out
[36:18] and now we're taking a step further now
[36:19] because I feel that pull a little bit
[36:21] I'm not just talking about Divine
[36:22] Healing anymore I'm talking about
[36:24] Christianity
[36:26] there was a story brother man talked
[36:27] about
[36:28] um
[36:28] there was an Army I forget I don't know
[36:31] if it was the Vikings I can't remember
[36:32] who the exact Army were but they were
[36:34] known to be so ruthless that they would
[36:37] take their boats when they would go try
[36:38] to take out a village or something they
[36:40] would take their boats hit the shores to
[36:42] get off the boats and burn the boats
[36:43] behind them
[36:45] why they're not getting off of there
[36:46] until they win every battle
[36:48] there was no Escape for them
[36:51] I think some Christians have that Escape
[36:54] Route in their mind
[36:56] if this don't work I have something to
[36:59] fall back on
[37:01] amen
[37:02] and see and this goes to a lot of things
[37:05] in Christianity and then you wonder why
[37:07] don't I see God the way I should see God
[37:09] the way I read about God have you really
[37:12] sold out
[37:14] and listen I can't answer that question
[37:16] Paul can't even answer that question
[37:19] but I know somebody who can
[37:22] Paul or I'm sorry God can answer that
[37:25] question
[37:26] and listen I know people always
[37:30] sometimes people wear you out with their
[37:31] issues and times and you have to sit
[37:33] there and wonder are you really sold
[37:37] are you really sold out to this gospel
[37:40] maybe I'm getting like this a little bit
[37:42] because listen Church you say brother
[37:44] Stephen do you think the raps are going
[37:45] to happen tomorrow it could
[37:47] of course it could happen 10 minutes
[37:49] from now
[37:50] but guess what you're not even
[37:52] guaranteed to make it there
[37:55] the Bible says it's appointed unto men
[37:56] wants to die then judgment
[37:59] yeah I had somebody asked me one time
[38:01] said how do you think the end of times
[38:03] is going to happen I said who cares once
[38:05] your end times going to happen
[38:08] doesn't matter how the end times is
[38:09] going to work it doesn't matter about
[38:10] you know a mark of the beast and all
[38:12] this stuff you're in the times might
[38:13] happen tomorrow
[38:15] and guess what you just met the end of
[38:16] times
[38:17] and guess what we're going to see
[38:19] whether you have it or not
[38:21] hey man Quit Playing Games With God
[38:24] he said brother Stephen how do I Quit
[38:25] Playing Games With God get in the
[38:26] Supernatural find out get sold out to
[38:29] Jesus Christ
[38:32] give your all to it it's worth your all
[38:35] God doesn't ask you to have a bunch of
[38:37] money guys I ask you a bunch of skill
[38:39] he's just asking for you give yourself
[38:42] to it
[38:44] and then you'll see God start moving in
[38:46] your life
[38:47] you'll start seeing Bible days happen
[38:49] before your eyes
[38:51] amen it won't just be a story anymore to
[38:54] you would be reality to you
[38:57] we need more Supernatural in our life
[39:01] even to you old Christians some of
[39:03] you've been serving God 30 40 50 years
[39:05] we still need Supernatural
[39:07] you're not going to make it without
[39:09] Supernatural you're not even saved
[39:11] without Supernatural do you know that
[39:13] you can't even be saved without it
[39:16] amen you're not saved by thoughts
[39:19] you didn't sit there one day and just
[39:20] think yourself into salvation
[39:22] no it was the power of God that saved
[39:25] your soul when he died on the cross for
[39:27] you
[39:28] amen
[39:30] see you see what I'm saying so if that's
[39:31] how much we need is Supernatural to get
[39:33] saved you're going to need it every day
[39:36] of your life
[39:38] here I'm going to read this to you here
[39:39] because I'm going to show you the
[39:40] disciples going through this a little
[39:41] bit our own personal struggles with
[39:43] salvation or with uh Supernatural
[39:46] verse 25
[39:48] and in the Fourth Watch of the night
[39:49] Jesus went unto them walking on the sea
[39:52] Jesus is always going to come
[39:54] you cry out to him he's going to be
[39:56] there even when sometimes you don't cry
[39:58] out he's gonna be there
[40:00] did he say Amen
[40:02] I know there's times I've done some
[40:04] pretty bone-headed things
[40:06] and he still shows up even when I wasn't
[40:08] even worthy of it
[40:10] he still shows up
[40:13] God doesn't fail God don't fail his word
[40:18] I can testify I'll give you my own
[40:20] testimony I've done some pretty stupid
[40:22] things now you can't tell from this good
[40:24] looking guy up here but
[40:25] just don't talk to my wife later okay
[40:29] but I've done some pretty dumb things
[40:32] I've done some things that I'm ashamed
[40:33] of
[40:35] be both before I was a Christian even
[40:37] after I was a Christian
[40:39] I've done some things that I am ashamed
[40:41] of
[40:42] every time I've ever asked God to show
[40:45] up
[40:46] no matter what condition I was in he'd
[40:49] show up every time
[40:51] he's never we failed God sure
[40:54] he never fails
[40:56] brother Bram said that one time he said
[40:58] God can't do one thing he can't fail
[41:02] he promised it to you
[41:04] he's going to take care of you
[41:07] he promised it to you
[41:10] he's always there with you don't ever
[41:11] doubt that
[41:12] don't ever listen to this world
[41:15] you know what I mean don't ever listen
[41:16] to psychology you know sometimes you got
[41:19] to stop thinking so much about it
[41:21] brother bam wrapped up the seals in a
[41:23] sermon title called God hidden in
[41:25] simplicity
[41:27] don't complicate it so much the
[41:30] supernatural ain't that hard it really
[41:32] ain't people always think it's
[41:33] complicated and how did Moses split the
[41:36] Red Sea you know all these powerful
[41:38] things that we see happen in the Bible
[41:40] you know what the Bible says about
[41:42] Elijah Elijah shut the heavens for three
[41:45] and a half years no rain
[41:48] not three and a half months three and a
[41:51] half years
[41:53] that's a long time
[41:55] and yet the Bible says Elijah is a man
[41:57] of such like Passions
[42:01] he dealt with the same things you deal
[42:02] with he was a man I no doubt he probably
[42:05] dealt with lust just like any other man
[42:07] would
[42:09] dealt with Envy Strife get angry
[42:13] they all deal with issues
[42:15] Elijah spirit in one sense was a loner
[42:18] you know he was a moody kind of guy you
[42:20] researched the Bible you find out that
[42:22] Elijah's Spirit they're very moody up
[42:25] and down up and down Elijah shut the
[42:27] heavens he had a letter from Jezebel
[42:28] scare him he's run into a cave saying
[42:31] I'm the only one left Lord
[42:33] John the Baptist one time says behold
[42:36] the Messiah
[42:37] behold the Christ he ends up in a jail
[42:39] he goes back says hey are you really the
[42:41] guy
[42:43] are you really there see Moody
[42:46] see you see but so they were subject to
[42:49] those kind of passions just like you are
[42:51] and yet they shut the heavens for three
[42:53] and a half years
[42:55] do you think I'm gonna do that brother
[42:56] Stephen I really don't know to be honest
[42:58] with you but it doesn't have to be that
[43:00] what I'm trying to tell you is that same
[43:01] stupid I'm not talking about the
[43:03] supernatural acts I'm talking about
[43:05] there's a supernatural God that's with
[43:08] you
[43:09] that whatever God is Supernatural things
[43:12] happen
[43:15] amen
[43:17] you see what I'm saying
[43:20] I think sometimes we bring too much
[43:22] denominational thinking in our mind
[43:24] acting too much like a Baptist a
[43:27] Methodist we're the Bride of Jesus
[43:29] Christ amen
[43:30] God's your brother may have said and I
[43:32] don't got the exactly I can get a lady
[43:33] for you if you want but brother bam said
[43:36] this he said if it was flesh if the
[43:38] supernatural was flesh during Jesus's
[43:40] day in his flesh it will be Supernatural
[43:43] In the Flesh of the Bride
[43:49] you know what Jesus said
[43:51] I'm sorry brother man said brother man
[43:53] said the bride will have the same
[43:55] ministry as Jesus Christ
[43:59] the same God in you it's not a different
[44:02] God
[44:04] you say well I have a less of a god well
[44:07] maybe you do but brother man Thomas you
[44:08] just take a little spoon in the ocean
[44:11] take it up it's the same stuff
[44:14] I tell what just a little guy can do a
[44:16] lot
[44:17] let's just get that little God working
[44:18] then maybe we can start seeing the big
[44:20] guy working I don't know you see what
[44:22] I'm saying we get so frustrated in our
[44:24] mind about bills and work and things
[44:27] like that you know we got people who are
[44:29] sick people got cancer and things like
[44:33] that
[44:34] you see what I'm saying sometimes we
[44:35] take our problems and Elevate us so much
[44:37] we if we had the supernatural Mar in our
[44:40] life you would just see how small those
[44:43] problems you have are
[44:46] if you just enter into his presence more
[44:48] I don't know if you know her sister
[44:50] Wendy Chan
[44:52] great sister and Lord she gave me a
[44:54] magnet one time it has a little cat on
[44:55] it everything a little cute fridge
[44:57] maggot and it says you're telling uh God
[45:00] how big your problems are
[45:01] why don't you tell your problems how big
[45:03] God is
[45:05] you see why you need more Supernatural
[45:07] in your life your problems look too big
[45:09] this morning
[45:11] you've allowed problems in these issues
[45:13] to grow and to this thing that they're
[45:16] actually not compared to God
[45:18] but you will start comparing them to
[45:20] yourself and you're going I don't know
[45:22] how I'm going to do this of course you
[45:24] ain't gonna do it
[45:26] if man could save his own soul why would
[45:29] he need God
[45:31] if you could solve every single problem
[45:33] of course you wouldn't need God of
[45:35] course you need these problems this
[45:36] so of course when you look at it through
[45:38] yourself of course you fail
[45:41] it actually shouldn't really surprise
[45:43] you
[45:44] but you need to start comparing them to
[45:47] God's promises
[45:49] you need to start looking out on the
[45:51] water and though you're on this Gospel
[45:53] Ship waving tossing to and fro Jesus is
[45:56] still walking on the water
[45:58] the Supernatural is still there to
[46:00] handle any problem
[46:03] amen I'm gonna keep reading this
[46:07] and in the Fourth Watch of the night
[46:09] Jesus went unto them walking on the sea
[46:11] and when the disciples saw him walking
[46:13] on the sea they received him with joy
[46:20] is that what it says with the audition
[46:22] it was Jesus I thought
[46:24] wait Jesus is walking to them
[46:26] they were tossed on the sea and it was
[46:28] God coming to them they were troubled
[46:31] they were scared I wonder what happened
[46:33] sometimes in church then
[46:36] when you feel that unction in your heart
[46:39] and you don't have me or Paul to have to
[46:40] teach you what that is you know what
[46:42] that is
[46:43] that is when you feel that emotion in
[46:45] your heart you feel that Supernatural
[46:46] coming
[46:48] when you feel that Faith rise up in your
[46:50] heart I think I preached this here a
[46:51] long time ago pulsation of faith when
[46:54] you start feeling that pounding
[46:58] and it's time to believe
[47:00] what is that that's Jesus Christ walking
[47:03] on the water
[47:04] Jesus is coming to you
[47:07] what happens to a lot of us
[47:09] when Jesus was walking to him they get
[47:12] troubled
[47:13] saying it's a spirit
[47:15] and they cry out in fear
[47:17] oh devil speak in tongues too
[47:20] I know the fears we get well let's talk
[47:22] about our day a little bit
[47:24] oh I might look better than the other oh
[47:26] somebody might think I'm too spiritual
[47:27] in the church I know that one happens
[47:29] I've heard it
[47:31] oh I don't want to look too spiritual
[47:33] compared to other people oh I don't want
[47:35] to be too prideful what do you mean too
[47:37] prideful see you see what happens if
[47:40] Satan can't get you actual proud he make
[47:42] you think you are
[47:45] always this that and other and nothing
[47:47] gets done
[47:50] he printed this bunch of that you know
[47:52] what sometimes maybe you did get a
[47:54] little proud but at least somebody got
[47:55] healed of cancer Maybe
[47:57] you might get a little uppity up but
[47:58] somebody got saved still we worry too
[48:01] much about things
[48:04] you know what I mean
[48:06] worrying too much they cried out in fear
[48:09] scared of the Supernatural coming to him
[48:12] it's Jesus coming
[48:14] you made serpents he quit acting like it
[48:17] I might mess it up of course you're
[48:19] gonna mess it up you're human
[48:20] there's that saying right to air is
[48:22] human
[48:23] we all do it so quit acting like you
[48:25] ain't gonna do of course you're going to
[48:27] do it God that's why God gave you Grace
[48:30] that's why God gave you Grace you know I
[48:32] had this quote right here I read it in a
[48:34] broken cisterns and I was listening back
[48:36] there before the service and I thought I
[48:38] think I'm going to say this quote this
[48:39] morning brother bam said now speaking of
[48:41] Grace just for a moment what the grace
[48:43] of God is we got laws and bylaws and if
[48:47] you don't measure up to this standard I
[48:49] got a religious measuring stick if you
[48:51] don't measure just up to that you've got
[48:53] you can't come in
[48:55] he said and so forth but God Saves Us by
[48:59] grace not by a measuring stick
[49:03] you know what you ought to do this
[49:04] morning take your religious measuring
[49:06] stick bam time to break it and enter
[49:09] into the supernatural of God
[49:12] [Applause]
[49:16] quit trying to work it up you know what
[49:17] I mean you're saved by grace
[49:19] amen you don't got a bear in your body
[49:21] the marks of Jesus you don't got to beat
[49:23] yourself up to finally believe God I
[49:25] don't care what you've done Grace can
[49:27] overshadow it
[49:30] Grace not only overshadowed it I should
[49:32] even say grace obliterates it
[49:37] the blood of Jesus Christ think about
[49:39] this
[49:40] the blood of Jesus Christ
[49:42] if it wasn't so perfect if it wasn't
[49:45] perfect that means you could say I said
[49:48] it wrong if you could sin so much of the
[49:50] blood of Jesus Christ couldn't take care
[49:52] of it then that means the blood wasn't
[49:54] perfect
[49:55] it would have been a perfect sacrifice
[49:57] because a perfect sacrifice had to pay
[49:59] the price for All sin the Bible even
[50:01] tells us it did not just forgive your
[50:03] sins it forgave the sins of the whole
[50:05] world
[50:06] so if you could somehow sin so much that
[50:10] the grace couldn't reach you he wasn't
[50:12] perfect then
[50:13] and we know that ain't true
[50:16] you haven't sinned away your day of
[50:18] Grace
[50:19] amen you still love Jesus
[50:22] you know brother Brown said that that's
[50:23] actually a quote
[50:25] you haven't sinned away your day of
[50:27] Grace do you still love Jesus
[50:29] if you if you still love Jesus you
[50:31] couldn't love that unless Grace was
[50:33] there for you
[50:35] amen
[50:36] you're not saved by a measuring stick
[50:39] you you don't have to
[50:41] um you don't have to earn this kind of
[50:43] Supernatural I'm talking about if you
[50:46] would just reach out in faith
[50:48] I wouldn't even wait till I was done I
[50:50] tried to do it right now if I was you to
[50:52] be honest with you especially if you got
[50:54] the Holy Ghost don't wait on me
[50:57] if you ain't got the Holy Ghost I'd
[50:58] figure something out right now
[51:00] if you really want the supernatural
[51:02] working in your life you need to lift
[51:04] your hands and say God I receive it
[51:06] God I'll take it God I'm calling to you
[51:10] I want it so bad Lord I Want My Life
[51:13] changed more
[51:16] I know I can live better for God I don't
[51:18] know about you maybe you're all angels
[51:20] in here but I know I could use more God
[51:22] in my life
[51:25] I did jump a little ahead but let's
[51:27] repeat her saying this I did jump ahead
[51:31] watch this
[51:33] verse 26 again and when the disciples
[51:34] saw him walking on the sea they were
[51:36] trouble saying it is a spirit and they
[51:39] cried out for fear
[51:40] but straightway Hallelujah aren't you
[51:43] glad
[51:44] God doesn't leave you in that situation
[51:46] for so long
[51:47] they were scared for a little bit maybe
[51:49] just a little bit but straightway
[51:52] Jesus Hallelujah speak unto them saying
[51:55] be of a good cheer it is I
[51:58] I Be not Afraid oh can you say Amen
[52:01] you don't got to be afraid
[52:07] he's gonna take care of it
[52:11] remember what I said if you're leaning
[52:13] on something if it would fail if you'd
[52:16] fall right
[52:17] but Jesus Never Gonna fail you
[52:20] Jesus is never you're never going to
[52:22] fall you may feel like your fault but
[52:24] he's always going to be there
[52:26] ready to catch you
[52:29] oh aren't you glad for that friends
[52:32] I hope you can I hope you can feel the
[52:34] sermon's heart this morning I hope you
[52:35] can feel God's heart in this sometimes
[52:37] we condemn ourselves so much we can't
[52:39] experience God we think we can't
[52:41] experience God as much because we failed
[52:43] him so much
[52:45] these people were scared of Jesus Jesus
[52:48] is trying to come help and they were
[52:50] going ah in straight away Jesus cried
[52:52] out to them still
[52:55] he never gives up on us
[52:57] Hallelujah remember when Adam sinned
[53:00] Adam never looked for God but God was
[53:03] looking for Adam
[53:05] he's still walking in that Garden
[53:07] looking for you
[53:09] and I'm not just talking those who need
[53:11] saving though he's doing that too
[53:14] maybe you need a refilling of the Holy
[53:16] Ghost
[53:17] maybe you've had those experiences with
[53:19] God but you've been too busy getting
[53:21] worn by a painted fire
[53:23] oh I had a great testimony two months
[53:26] ago get one today then
[53:29] amen quit being warned up by your past
[53:31] experiences get a fresh anointing of the
[53:33] Holy Ghost today that

[53:36] don't care what it looks like just get
[53:39] it amen spending's too much time well

[53:44] cares what you're gonna do

[54:21] care of you just start leaning on him
[54:24] this morning and your life will be so
[54:27] much better for it

[57:34] when Christ is here this morning you
[57:36] don't have to be afraid of it
[57:38] now watch what Peter says I love this
[57:42] and Peter answered him and said Lord if
[57:45] it be thou
[57:46] bid me come unto the water
[57:49] what a great what a great way to find
[57:52] out
[57:53] what does he say Lord if that is you
[57:56] I just heard you say it Jesus but Lord
[57:58] if that's you let me do the same thing
[58:00] you're doing
[58:03] if it is you Lord let me come on Lord if
[58:06] you said you can be healed by your
[58:08] stripes you're here Lord if that is you
[58:10] bend me to come
[58:13] cry out to me Lord tell me to come in
[58:17] and what do you say in the next verse
[58:19] going to go to the next 29. and he said
[58:23] come
[58:27] you don't have to wonder what it means
[58:30] to have a supernatural God in your life
[58:33] if this Supernatural is written I
[58:35] challenge you all this morning
[58:38] so maybe some are teetering I don't know
[58:40] where you're at God does
[58:42] but if you feel that teetering spirit is
[58:44] this really God
[58:46] oh let's take it a step further we're in
[58:48] the message Church aren't we is the
[58:49] message really right
[58:51] you know I've been hearing this stuff
[58:53] about the prophet and you know this that
[58:55] or another and there's so many of these
[58:56] opinions and stuff like that I've been
[58:58] accused of being a brand of my
[59:00] I wear like I wear like a badge though
[59:01] to be honest with you but that's all
[59:03] right because I know where I stand
[59:07] I know where I stand amen I don't think
[59:10] brother Brandon was God just as much as
[59:11] I don't think you or as the single
[59:13] person God Amen but I do believe brother
[59:16] Ram is the prophet to this age
[59:19] hey man we needed something like this to
[59:21] happen all right somebody asked me that
[59:23] one time why do you say brother Bradham
[59:25] said I said because I'm not Malachi 4.
[59:29] he's Malachi 4. God prophesied of his
[59:32] God anointed another Prophet to prophesy
[59:35] about this prophet
[59:36] he must be pretty important then
[59:39] amen it ain't remember when we're
[59:41] following this message we're not just
[59:43] following it because he did more fancy
[59:44] stuff than the guy down the road
[59:47] it's not just the supernatural this
[59:49] message is scripture being fulfilled in
[59:51] our day
[59:53] Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 Revelation 10. it's
[59:57] scripture happening before our eyes
[1:00:01] that's why I follow it
[1:00:03] that's why I lead and sell my soul out
[1:00:05] to it if this message failed I failed
[1:00:09] sold out Lock Stock and Barrel that's
[1:00:11] why I've been called a brand of mine
[1:00:12] that's all right it doesn't affect me
[1:00:14] too much but you need to know where you
[1:00:16] stand
[1:00:17] are you sold out to this or not
[1:00:19] see we always get these opinions going
[1:00:21] back and forth is this really right or
[1:00:23] not you you know how I found out this
[1:00:25] mess is right you're gonna be shocked by
[1:00:27] this I know you are
[1:00:28] all right when I first came and I was
[1:00:31] praying about this message you know what
[1:00:32] I did
[1:00:33] I talked to God about it
[1:00:36] uh oh
[1:00:38] I asked God is this it
[1:00:41] is this it and all of a sudden God
[1:00:43] started showing me things in my life I
[1:00:46] didn't even see before but I found out I
[1:00:49] was surrounded by the message the whole
[1:00:50] time I hope you don't mind this I'm
[1:00:52] gonna give a little testimony I know we
[1:00:54] got to be a little careful about time
[1:00:55] you warned me already and I just tease
[1:00:57] it I'm just teasing let me just give you
[1:01:00] a little testimony I'm gonna try to
[1:01:01] bring this down a little bit
[1:01:03] well when I when I like I said when I
[1:01:05] first found out about this message and
[1:01:06] so forth I was praying Lord is this
[1:01:08] right
[1:01:09] Lord is this right I'm trying to catch
[1:01:12] it then all of a sudden one day I'm
[1:01:14] walking up into my grandpa's house
[1:01:16] and I looked and I stepped on the step
[1:01:19] I've been in my grandpa's house since I
[1:01:21] was a little boy stepping over that same
[1:01:23] step he painted his four green I don't
[1:01:24] know why he painted a green but the
[1:01:26] garage floor was green and but it was a
[1:01:29] little concrete step go up and I went up
[1:01:31] and I looked on the corner this is the
[1:01:32] first time I've ever seen this I've
[1:01:34] never even seen it like I said I think I
[1:01:36] was 23 years old
[1:01:38] now look and I saw a little V on the
[1:01:40] corner of a of a of the mat
[1:01:42] and I went what's that little V somebody
[1:01:44] carved something into the concrete I
[1:01:46] took it off
[1:01:47] and I found out later my uncle when he
[1:01:49] was a boy painted the Pyramid of the
[1:01:52] Seven Virtues into that concrete step
[1:01:54] with the Capstone and everything there
[1:01:57] and I went I never noticed that until
[1:01:59] now when I asked God is this message
[1:02:03] right
[1:02:04] and I stepped right onto it walked in
[1:02:07] the house I looked to my left I noticed
[1:02:09] my grandpa had the picture of the pillar
[1:02:11] fire right there
[1:02:12] and I went seen that picture of my whole
[1:02:15] life never knew what that meant until
[1:02:18] right this moment look to my right he
[1:02:20] had a picture of the seven angel cloud
[1:02:22] I was surrounded by the message the
[1:02:25] whole time didn't even know it
[1:02:27] and I got a whole long story about that
[1:02:29] but I'm talking about me for the second
[1:02:31] is as soon as I started asking God for
[1:02:34] it as a matter of fact there was a
[1:02:36] picture that my grandpa had that I was
[1:02:37] always intrigued by I remember as a kid
[1:02:39] I would look at it go that's just
[1:02:42] something it's a picture of brother
[1:02:43] Brian I'm preaching with the Flames
[1:02:44] coming on him
[1:02:45] and I remember when I was a little boy
[1:02:47] I'd look at that picture and I go that's
[1:02:50] just something what's going on there
[1:02:51] nobody told me
[1:02:53] until I was 23 years old and I asked God
[1:02:55] is this message right and I looked at
[1:02:58] that picture and I said yup
[1:03:01] there's something about that man and
[1:03:04] that anointing and that war that came
[1:03:06] forth that is sent to us to prepare us
[1:03:09] for our rapture
[1:03:12] don't be scared this message
[1:03:14] don't be scared of that brain of Might
[1:03:16] and what they like to say about it
[1:03:18] people will come around you accuse you
[1:03:20] to be a man father don't even listen to
[1:03:22] it you know where you stand
[1:03:24] I'm not following a man I'm following
[1:03:27] the word made flesh in my day
[1:03:30] I'm following scripture that happened
[1:03:33] let the world go by God he was mindful
[1:03:36] of you to send you that word
[1:03:39] don't want to be ashamed of this message
[1:03:42] don't ever be scared of it it's Jesus
[1:03:44] walking on the water still hey amen when
[1:03:47] God sent us a message he said it's the
[1:03:50] most Supernatural brother Brandon even
[1:03:52] told us he did more miracles in his
[1:03:54] ministry than he did in his own Ministry
[1:03:59] remember that the supernatural followed
[1:04:01] us
[1:04:02] it's a part of us
[1:04:03] it's a part of Who We Are
[1:04:06] if it is him Lord bend me to come
[1:04:10] Lord if this message is real bin me to
[1:04:14] come and I'm here to declare to you the
[1:04:17] word said come
[1:04:20] you don't have to guess anymore whether
[1:04:21] this message right you don't have to
[1:04:23] guess anymore whether you're going to
[1:04:24] make it into a Rapture can I just stress
[1:04:26] on that just for a little bit here amen
[1:04:28] you need to find out whether you're
[1:04:31] going to be in the Rapture or not you
[1:04:33] need to know that you know that you know
[1:04:36] me and brother Alex I think you've had
[1:04:37] him here before Alex a good buddy of
[1:04:39] mine we always joke around sometimes if
[1:04:41] he can't I'll call him and if he can't
[1:04:43] oh no he's called me one time he
[1:04:45] couldn't reach me and so he told my wife
[1:04:47] he said well I know he didn't go no
[1:04:48] rapture
[1:04:51] he said because if he was going to a
[1:04:53] Rapture I'd be gone too
[1:04:55] that's the kind of attitude we need amen
[1:05:00] you know the Bible says the Bible says
[1:05:02] in um
[1:05:04] oh I believe it's in Matthew
[1:05:06] talks about when Jesus was accused of
[1:05:08] eating the show bread in the temple
[1:05:11] and
[1:05:12] the the the the Pharisees said your
[1:05:15] disciples do that which is unlawful he
[1:05:17] said have you not read when David also
[1:05:20] ate of the show bread
[1:05:21] and so forth he said for the Lord or for
[1:05:24] for the son of man is Lord even on the
[1:05:27] Sabbath day
[1:05:29] and the point he's making is this is
[1:05:31] that sometimes we get too religious in
[1:05:33] our mind about things and he was saying
[1:05:35] it wasn't like when God was there before
[1:05:37] the foundation of the world there was
[1:05:38] this great thing called the Sabbath day
[1:05:40] and he looked at the Sabbath day and he
[1:05:42] went oh there's a Sabbath day you know
[1:05:44] what I'll do I'll make man to worship
[1:05:46] this sabbath day
[1:05:48] that's not what happened no God first
[1:05:50] made man
[1:05:52] he made man and his own image and then
[1:05:55] he noticed he needed them to have a rest
[1:05:59] so then he said you know what I'm going
[1:06:00] to make a rest for them called the
[1:06:02] Sabbath
[1:06:03] that's the point of the Sabbath the
[1:06:04] Sabbath it wasn't that man was made for
[1:06:07] the Sabbath it was that the Sabbath was
[1:06:09] made for man
[1:06:12] now let's look at the rapture
[1:06:14] it's not that you are the you are made
[1:06:18] for the Rapture it's that the Rapture
[1:06:21] was made for you
[1:06:24] God knew you were going to be here in
[1:06:26] this end time
[1:06:27] and do you know God can even judge this
[1:06:29] world while you're here
[1:06:31] he can't do it why because the blood of
[1:06:34] Jesus Christ by the spirit of God is in
[1:06:36] you but the BAM taught us that the
[1:06:38] Church of God is the blood of God by the
[1:06:41] spirit
[1:06:42] so while you're here there's still Blood
[1:06:45] On The Mercy Seat
[1:06:46] oh Hallelujah do you see why we can
[1:06:49] still reach out to souls out there I
[1:06:52] think I told Paul this this weekend I've
[1:06:54] been lately I've been getting such a
[1:06:56] heart for missionary work lately
[1:06:58] I think I think oh man brother Paul I
[1:07:01] get really at home here don't I
[1:07:06] think we're getting a little too
[1:07:07] close-minded in the message I'm gonna be
[1:07:09] real with you this is my heart okay
[1:07:13] I think we're forgetting about other
[1:07:14] people
[1:07:16] we're remembering each other and that's
[1:07:18] good don't get me wrong we should be
[1:07:19] worried about each other of course you
[1:07:22] should you should be praying for your
[1:07:23] brothers and sisters praying for
[1:07:25] sickness and so forth do you know how
[1:07:27] many people are out there and have you
[1:07:28] even had a chance to hear what you heard
[1:07:31] you know how many people that were his
[1:07:33] who haven't even heard the even a hint
[1:07:35] of the things you've heard
[1:07:38] what if they did
[1:07:40] what if they did hear something that
[1:07:42] you've heard what would it do to them
[1:07:45] oh Stephen I've been rejected so many
[1:07:47] times so so have I
[1:07:49] but sometimes it just takes one I'm
[1:07:51] going to give you one more test you know
[1:07:52] what I'm gonna give you one more
[1:07:53] testimony I'm gonna shut her down I'm
[1:07:55] gonna because I want to tell you my
[1:07:56] testimony oh I see I see you back there
[1:07:59] Kyle but Laura stayed home huh yeah a
[1:08:01] little baby oh is she back there good
[1:08:04] okay good I just don't see her
[1:08:06] good one of those Delaney's better show
[1:08:08] up Ashley bailed on me so
[1:08:10] Josiah went on his month trip to Vain
[1:08:12] you make sure you get him a little hard
[1:08:14] time for me okay
[1:08:15] missing my service give him a not a huge
[1:08:18] amount but a little bit okay
[1:08:21] anyways you know sometimes you don't
[1:08:23] know what it's going to take to save
[1:08:24] somebody
[1:08:26] you don't even know here let me just
[1:08:27] give you my testimony about the delaneys
[1:08:29] one time I started working I started
[1:08:31] word working on third shift
[1:08:33] and uh that first night I worked there I
[1:08:36] was on fire for God
[1:08:38] and I lit that whole place on fire now
[1:08:41] that I'm thinking about it I sure did
[1:08:42] because I worked with the lady named
[1:08:44] Jessica she trained me on the job for
[1:08:46] eight hours and I gave her eight hours
[1:08:48] worth of God
[1:08:51] just drowned her in it you may see you
[1:08:54] think that was why Stephen I actually in
[1:08:55] one sense no I don't think it was wise
[1:08:57] but I believe God was in it still see
[1:09:00] sometimes we get so much thinking was
[1:09:02] that really the best way could I have
[1:09:03] done better maybe you could but God
[1:09:05] knows how to work things anyways
[1:09:08] amen because what happened was I talked
[1:09:11] to her so much about God
[1:09:13] that also I'm walking out the door the
[1:09:16] end of this is the very first night I'm
[1:09:18] there
[1:09:18] and the guy later I found out his name's
[1:09:21] Eddie he approaches me say hey uh I'm
[1:09:23] Eddie nice to meet you I said hi I'm
[1:09:25] Stephen he's like are you a Christian I
[1:09:28] said well now that you ask me yes I am a
[1:09:30] Christian he said well I already knew
[1:09:32] that
[1:09:33] how do you already know that apparently
[1:09:36] there was a forklift driver driving by
[1:09:38] and he overheard me talking about God to
[1:09:40] Jessica
[1:09:41] and he said and that forklift driver and
[1:09:43] me get together every night he works
[1:09:46] third shift and I work first so we get
[1:09:47] together and pray with each other as we
[1:09:49] go our separate ways would you like to
[1:09:50] pray with us
[1:09:51] amen I love to pray with you that'd be
[1:09:54] great we also do a man's bible study on
[1:09:57] Tuesday nights would you like to come
[1:10:00] amen I'll come
[1:10:02] so sure enough and that other forklift
[1:10:04] driver overheard me ended up being Steve
[1:10:06] Delaney
[1:10:07] so we started doing Bible studies on
[1:10:10] every Tuesday nights every Tuesday
[1:10:11] nights we started doing Bible studies
[1:10:13] and one night and it was
[1:10:17] there was a guy there's old Mennonite
[1:10:19] there named Pete and uh Pete Pete didn't
[1:10:22] really like me too well
[1:10:24] and that's because we start talking
[1:10:26] about something
[1:10:27] that I would just take it and just go a
[1:10:30] million miles away from what they were
[1:10:32] talking about right and I ended up
[1:10:34] actually kind of inadvertently taking
[1:10:36] over the Bible study a little bit
[1:10:38] one night we started talking about End
[1:10:40] Time stuff
[1:10:41] you know what God's going to do in the
[1:10:43] Book of Revelations and so forth and I
[1:10:45] and we're getting towards the end and I
[1:10:46] said
[1:10:47] you know before God can do any of this
[1:10:50] that we're talking about tonight
[1:10:51] he said he promised there was a last
[1:10:53] sign to the Gentiles
[1:10:56] and it was getting closer and I said you
[1:10:57] know if you guys don't mind maybe next
[1:10:59] Tuesday I can come and I can share with
[1:11:01] you what this last sign is they said
[1:11:04] yeah brother Stephen come in you know
[1:11:06] that that takes wisdom God gave me a
[1:11:08] rapport with them
[1:11:09] God gave me a testimony with them so
[1:11:11] they're like yeah bring it Stephen we'd
[1:11:12] love to hear what you have to say so
[1:11:14] sure enough that next Tuesday I bring
[1:11:16] and I taught brother Brandon right out
[1:11:17] of this
[1:11:19] remember something what we're following
[1:11:21] is a hundred percent scriptural
[1:11:23] we're not we're not man follower I know
[1:11:25] people like to call you a man father you
[1:11:27] ain't actually a man follower well
[1:11:29] you're a man Christ Jesus follower I'll
[1:11:31] say that
[1:11:32] amen but this I took brother Branham and
[1:11:35] I preached him right out of here I
[1:11:37] didn't need a single quote to do it and
[1:11:39] I did that on purpose just for them but
[1:11:42] I'm just letting you know
[1:11:44] that this message is a hundred percent
[1:11:46] scripture
[1:11:49] so I showed him in the scripture what I
[1:11:51] did was I made a gap
[1:11:53] in the scripture of the Gentile Church
[1:11:55] ages and then the end times with when
[1:11:57] God starts dealing with Israel I said
[1:11:58] but there's something here
[1:12:00] and I took brother Manor's Ministry and
[1:12:02] went bump
[1:12:04] there it is that night I gave them all
[1:12:06] Church age books and I gave them all the
[1:12:09] uh um pictures of the prophet and so
[1:12:11] forth like that and I told him I said
[1:12:13] and I believe by God's grace this man
[1:12:15] fits the bill
[1:12:16] that it's not just the man either but
[1:12:18] his ministry is what fits right in here
[1:12:22] for the last sign of the Gentiles
[1:12:24] so I did that that night
[1:12:26] at night I go to the feeder line of the
[1:12:28] hymen line
[1:12:29] Myers Road and Sauders Archbold Ohio I'm
[1:12:32] sorry I'm working all of a sudden
[1:12:36] ly drives to this forklift gets off of
[1:12:38] it and he starts pounding me with
[1:12:41] questions
[1:12:42] he just starts talking to me all night
[1:12:45] so Stephen what are you talking about
[1:12:47] this guy's a prophet how to come nobody
[1:12:49] knows about him
[1:12:51] kept talking me over and over and over
[1:12:53] again
[1:12:55] I went to his house one time and we
[1:12:57] started talking about godhead the Lord
[1:12:59] can tell you the story a little bit
[1:13:00] better because what happened was
[1:13:02] apparently they tried to do a little
[1:13:04] joke on me while I was talking about the
[1:13:05] godhead trying to do a Bible study with
[1:13:07] him apparently he gave me a bunch of
[1:13:08] nuts or Wasabi nuts and they're supposed
[1:13:11] to be like super hot they said I took
[1:13:12] those nuts just pounded them and just
[1:13:14] kept on preaching
[1:13:15] did a phase me elect
[1:13:20] they're like what's going on
[1:13:25] so
[1:13:27] about about two months later Steve
[1:13:29] Delaney ends up getting baptized
[1:13:31] in the name of the Lord him and his wife
[1:13:34] and then sure enough through that now
[1:13:36] remember this this all started because I
[1:13:39] was talking to somebody else
[1:13:42] didn't even meet Steve Delaney Steve the
[1:13:44] lady met me first oh that was good
[1:13:48] I never actually I've said this
[1:13:49] testimony a hundred times never said it
[1:13:51] like that before
[1:13:53] I was talking to somebody else and God
[1:13:56] made sure Delaine Steve Delaney was
[1:13:58] right there
[1:14:00] sure enough what happens is one daughter
[1:14:03] amen Ashley turns into the skirt girl at
[1:14:06] school
[1:14:08] she starts understanding this message
[1:14:09] she got the Holy Ghost and I believe it
[1:14:11] was 2012 she told me a Tim mechanic
[1:14:13] Church gets the Holy Ghost amen Allure
[1:14:16] gets the Holy Ghost Aubry gets the Holy
[1:14:17] Ghost banned still working on him a
[1:14:19] little bit but he's coming in none the
[1:14:20] same
[1:14:22] their whole family gets saved
[1:14:25] and I'm saying this you're saying oh
[1:14:27] that's beautiful Stephen I'm so glad to
[1:14:29] hear God doing that I'm not telling you
[1:14:32] this testimony to tell you how pretty it
[1:14:34] is what I'm trying to tell you is that
[1:14:37] God could use you just the same
[1:14:40] God can use you just the same just speak
[1:14:43] to a soul
[1:14:45] who knows maybe somebody's overhearing
[1:14:47] you
[1:14:49] I think we've like I said I think in the
[1:14:52] message we're starting to get too much
[1:14:54] of a bubble
[1:14:56] where we are starting to forget about
[1:14:58] the people outside of us
[1:15:01] and we need to start being concerned
[1:15:03] about that
[1:15:05] and I'm not even missionary work is
[1:15:07] great I'm glad we're doing it actually
[1:15:09] I'm glad we're starting to send pretty
[1:15:11] well what I'm saying is what about that
[1:15:13] co-worker next to you
[1:15:15] what about that neighbor
[1:15:18] oh well brother Stephen I don't want to
[1:15:21] scare them we can scare them to Hell
[1:15:22] number two
[1:15:26] you see what I'm saying is it really
[1:15:28] gonna be that bad
[1:15:30] you're already the skirt girl sister
[1:15:32] you know what I mean you're already the
[1:15:35] skirt girl brother Paul I hope this is
[1:15:37] okay this morning I'm getting a little
[1:15:39] friendly this morning but I I hope you
[1:15:43] can feel my heart
[1:15:44] is that I've noticed this about myself
[1:15:46] lately
[1:15:47] too worried about
[1:15:50] so much message issues and I'm I'm being
[1:15:53] real candid this morning I am being and
[1:15:57] not and and I'm not saying these
[1:15:59] problems aren't worth looking at
[1:16:00] sometimes but I think they're getting
[1:16:02] too big and we're forgetting the bigger
[1:16:04] picture which is what Souls being saved
[1:16:07] for God
[1:16:10] Hallelujah
[1:16:17] we sometimes forget those Souls out
[1:16:19] there and who knows if they would hear
[1:16:21] the same word you heard what would they
[1:16:23] do
[1:16:24] you don't know what they're going to do
[1:16:26] they might reject you yeah they might
[1:16:28] reject you they may say there's nothing
[1:16:31] to this
[1:16:33] yeah maybe they would
[1:16:35] but what if they do come
[1:16:38] what's that Worth to us
[1:16:40] oh
[1:16:42] Hallelujah that just struck my soul a
[1:16:45] little bit I might have to do some
[1:16:46] repentance this morning myself to be
[1:16:47] honest with you
[1:16:49] what is that word I I you know what you
[1:16:53] forget I'm doing a little reflection of
[1:16:55] myself
[1:16:57] you know when I first got saved I did a
[1:16:59] lot of Street witnessing I'm not saying
[1:17:00] everybody has to do it but I did
[1:17:02] and I went door to door
[1:17:05] I did a lot I docked on almost every
[1:17:07] single door in northwest Ohio Defiance
[1:17:09] Napoleon Liberty Center Delta Wauseon I
[1:17:12] went through all those towns
[1:17:15] you know how my soul's got saved from
[1:17:17] that
[1:17:18] zero
[1:17:21] but it grew me to a point where I could
[1:17:24] talk to somebody else and God could
[1:17:25] bring a Delaney around to me
[1:17:28] and I think about that for a second and
[1:17:30] I go
[1:17:31] was it worth it
[1:17:34] was it worth all that time I walked I
[1:17:36] mean I walked I one time I I used to do
[1:17:39] with a buddy Simon Smith that he goes to
[1:17:41] camp Smith's church in Napoleon
[1:17:43] me and Simon we we hit the streets all
[1:17:45] the time one time we got so tired I was
[1:17:48] late to work I worked third shift right
[1:17:49] and I fell asleep on his couch my wife
[1:17:51] woke me up too late and we were late to
[1:17:54] work
[1:17:55] I said glory to God I was late to work
[1:17:57] serving God
[1:17:59] I'm not suggesting duh we like to work
[1:18:03] all of a sudden
[1:18:04] but now that I'm looking about it I'm
[1:18:07] actually confessing my heart before you
[1:18:08] right now
[1:18:09] was it worth it
[1:18:11] was it worth all that effort I did you
[1:18:13] know what I say
[1:18:14] absolutely and 100 I do it again
[1:18:18] and if I got rejected another thousand
[1:18:20] times would it still be worth it
[1:18:23] do you understand what brother Stephen's
[1:18:25] saying this morning
[1:18:26] let's not be worried so much about our
[1:18:28] inner working sometimes
[1:18:31] you know I heard a preacher say this one
[1:18:32] time I'm close with this statement right
[1:18:33] here
[1:18:34] said are you getting sick
[1:18:37] you're getting sick in Christianity get
[1:18:39] on a missionary diet
[1:18:42] start sharing your faith
[1:18:44] you know what I mean when you go to I'll
[1:18:47] give you a little tidbits here when you
[1:18:48] go to the cash register
[1:18:50] and she's ringing you up why don't you
[1:18:52] say that God bless you want to
[1:18:55] thank you so much for your help God
[1:18:56] bless you
[1:18:58] bring it up
[1:19:00] bring who knows who's listening
[1:19:03] and who knows they might end up in this
[1:19:05] church and get saved because of what you
[1:19:07] were willing to sacrifice
[1:19:09] how many missed opportunities do you
[1:19:11] have I know I have plenty
[1:19:14] you understand what both Steven's saying
[1:19:16] that's why I appreciate Paul so much as
[1:19:17] well we had this conversation similar to
[1:19:19] this I think I think we need to
[1:19:22] we need to start being more worried
[1:19:24] about those Souls that need it
[1:19:28] you know what I mean
[1:19:30] let's bow our heads for a prayer most
[1:19:32] gracious kind Heavenly Father Lord
[1:19:35] as I pray right now with this
[1:19:36] congregation Lord
[1:19:38] I do feel like there was a shift in the
[1:19:40] spirit God
[1:19:42] and I feel that shift right now even
[1:19:43] with me Lord
[1:19:46] God I pray Lord
[1:19:48] that we start looking within ourselves
[1:19:52] and start crying out as it says in the
[1:19:54] Book of Ezekiel start crying out for the
[1:19:56] Abominations done in the city
[1:19:59] Lord a church is not just called to to
[1:20:03] their four walls they're called to a
[1:20:05] location
[1:20:07] lower these families wherever they may
[1:20:09] live they're not just put there randomly
[1:20:11] but you have placed them there for a
[1:20:13] reason
[1:20:15] Lord maybe there's a soul next to them
[1:20:18] that needs to hear this glory is Gospel
[1:20:22] I pray these these men who may feel like
[1:20:24] they're not the greatest gift in man
[1:20:26] that they would just throw those
[1:20:27] thoughts out of their mind and just and
[1:20:30] just talk about the goodness of God as
[1:20:32] brother bran would say if all you could
[1:20:34] tell them that it was lit then tell them
[1:20:36] that
[1:20:38] the Bible says he'll give you the words
[1:20:40] to speak in that very hour so take no
[1:20:42] thought of it
[1:20:47] these sisters out here
[1:20:49] may they not be discouraged what can I
[1:20:51] do for God may they understand with
[1:20:54] their Holiness they they shot upon
[1:20:56] themselves that they're preaching the
[1:20:58] gospel more than even I could ever
[1:21:00] preach it
[1:21:01] and that they're declaring the goodness
[1:21:03] of Jesus Christ when they're going
[1:21:05] through Walmart and things like that
[1:21:07] they're going through the stores may
[1:21:09] they understand they're preaching more
[1:21:10] than I ever could
[1:21:13] and they're showing the gospel on
[1:21:15] display
[1:21:18] I pray for myself as well I pray you
[1:21:21] forgive me for those times that I have
[1:21:22] failed you personally Lord
[1:21:24] when I should have said something
[1:21:27] and I pray Lord as a minister of this
[1:21:30] gospel
[1:21:32] looking upon the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:21:34] help us Lord God I pray
[1:21:37] I just feel the unction in my heart
[1:21:38] right now
[1:21:40] for these Souls that we talk to Lord
[1:21:43] may we just take a moment to think about
[1:21:45] somebody maybe it's a co-worker maybe
[1:21:47] it's a loved one a family member maybe
[1:21:50] they've lost their way and they're out
[1:21:51] in the world
[1:21:53] maybe it's a neighbor that you talk to
[1:21:55] every morning when you go to work
[1:21:57] maybe it's a co-worker that you've
[1:21:59] worked beside for the last 20 years
[1:22:02] maybe it's time for them to know
[1:22:04] what God has done for them
[1:22:07] help us lord of the Bride of Jesus
[1:22:09] Christ
[1:22:10] that as we enter in more Lord to the
[1:22:13] Supernatural and as we enter in more to
[1:22:16] get our fires lick
[1:22:19] that we get so on fire with God
[1:22:22] that will start igniting those people
[1:22:24] beside us
[1:22:26] and start spreading that fire to other
[1:22:28] people Lord
[1:22:29] help us God is the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:22:32] Lord maybe it's a gleaning time
[1:22:35] as Ruth would go before it was time for
[1:22:38] her to lay before Boaz
[1:22:40] she walked behind the the sheepfolds and
[1:22:42] the people harvesting the Grain and she
[1:22:44] would just glean the other little corn
[1:22:46] one here and one there
[1:22:49] Lord maybe that's what's happening right
[1:22:51] now Lord
[1:22:52] that there's one here
[1:22:54] maybe there's one by by the place you
[1:22:56] work
[1:22:57] maybe there's a co-worker
[1:23:00] maybe that's the last seed
[1:23:02] and once that last he comes in we can
[1:23:04] all go home then
[1:23:07] help us Lord to be more yielding to your
[1:23:09] spirit
[1:23:10] maybe that's why I had to preach this
[1:23:11] morning Lord I don't know
[1:23:13] but that same Supernatural God that we
[1:23:16] need to enter in more we need to also
[1:23:19] start handing out to other people
[1:23:21] as Peter said Silver and Gold Have I
[1:23:24] None but such as I have I give and what
[1:23:29] did Peter give a supernatural promise in
[1:23:33] the name of Jesus Christ rise up and
[1:23:35] walk
[1:23:37] help me Lord help us all Lord to be more
[1:23:40] of that witness of you God
[1:23:43] we just thank you Lord for this time I
[1:23:45] pray for this special group of people
[1:23:46] Lord who just Lord I just believe
[1:23:49] there's such a blessing willing to
[1:23:50] suffer with me Lord and be able to hear
[1:23:52] your word Lord and however you bring it
[1:23:55] Lord
[1:23:56] and whatever capacity you need to do
[1:23:58] Lord I thank you Lord at the Liberty I
[1:24:02] feel this on Lord
[1:24:04] Lord you know I don't act like this all
[1:24:06] the time God
[1:24:07] but here it feels like I can just let my
[1:24:09] hair down and just just let my heart
[1:24:11] just break before these people Lord and
[1:24:14] I thank you Lord for that is not an
[1:24:16] accident
[1:24:17] but that means there is a holy ghost
[1:24:19] moving in these people Lord
[1:24:22] and that Holy Ghost is is with that
[1:24:24] Liberty is able to reach to each soul
[1:24:27] and meat whatever need that they had
[1:24:29] Lord you can meet each need Lord when we
[1:24:32] open up the floodgates Lord we can allow
[1:24:36] the Holy Spirit to move in Lord
[1:24:39] and as brother Braden said we don't use
[1:24:41] the Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost uses
[1:24:44] us
[1:24:45] so Lord may we start becoming yielded
[1:24:48] vessels unto you Lord
[1:24:50] and start being used more of you God
[1:24:54] and whatever capacity you call us to God
[1:24:58] thank you Lord for this time
[1:25:00] and I thank you Lord
[1:25:02] for your grace and your mercy
[1:25:05] and Jesus precious name the bride said
[1:25:08] together
[1:25:09] amen you love the Lord God surely is
[1:25:12] good
