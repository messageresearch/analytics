[5:50] of Christ in Jesus name amen amen it's
[5:54] so good to be with you tonight amen
[5:57] let's just turn to our Bibles tonight
[6:00] Romans 7
[6:02] 7 17-25
[6:05] before we do that though
[6:08] I had it's kind of some funny thing that
[6:11] happened but pull up the
[6:13] pull up the advertisement for the like
[6:16] tonight pull up that if you would
[6:18] because there were some that were saying
[6:20] that I looked like I looked exactly like
[6:23] the advertisement I have to say I don't
[6:26] I am the same person but I have a
[6:28] different code on I'm not trying to like
[6:30] make the connection tonight so you don't
[6:31] forget but pull up that just so you guys
[6:33] know
[6:35] pull up that you guys got that
[6:38] maybe not if not
[6:42] oh it's tonight we don't need to
[6:43] advertising for it anymore
[6:45] but I guess it looked exactly like what
[6:48] I'm wearing tonight so I guess they
[6:49] could see the comparison it was kind of
[6:50] funny
[6:52] for me at least so let's just turn in
[6:56] our Bibles this tonight
[6:58] Romans 7.
[6:59] like the title of the sermon tonight
[7:01] what are you eating
[7:04] amen
[7:06] Romans 7.
[7:09] 17 through 25 we'll read I'll read this
[7:11] with you and then you can have the have
[7:14] your seats tonight I want to read it
[7:15] from the Amplified to
[7:17] Romans 17
[7:19] Romans 7 17. now then it is no more I
[7:23] that do it but sin that dwelleth in me
[7:25] for I know that in me that is in my
[7:28] flesh dwelleth no good thing
[7:31] for too will is for to will is present
[7:35] with me but how to perform that which is
[7:38] good I find not
[7:40] for the good that I would I do not for
[7:42] the evil which I would
[7:44] not that I do
[7:46] now if I do that I would sin it is no
[7:49] more I that do it but sin that dwelleth
[7:51] in me I find then a law that that that
[7:55] when I would do good evil is present
[7:58] with me for I dwelleth in the law of God
[8:01] after the inward man amen
[8:04] for I see another law in my members
[8:07] warring against the law of my mind and
[8:09] bringing me into the Captivity of the
[8:11] law of sin which is in my members oh
[8:14] Wretched Man that I am
[8:16] who shall deliver me from the body of
[8:18] this death I thank God
[8:21] through Jesus Christ Our Lord
[8:24] so then with the mind I myself serve the
[8:27] law of God
[8:29] but with the Flesh of the law
[8:31] but with the Flesh of the law of sin so
[8:34] you see the difference there right are
[8:36] you catching the difference there
[8:38] you may be seated tonight
[8:40] and then from the Amplified I'm just
[8:42] going to go from 21 to 25 so I find it
[8:45] to be the law
[8:47] of my inner self that evil is present in
[8:50] me the one who wants to do good
[8:53] for I joyfully Delight in the law of God
[8:56] in my inner self with my new creature
[8:58] amen but I see a different law and Rural
[9:02] action in my members of my body
[9:05] in its appetites
[9:07] in its desires see what are you eating
[9:10] and it's appetites and its desires
[9:12] Waging War against the law of my mind
[9:15] and some and subduing me and making me a
[9:18] prisoner of the law of sin
[9:20] which is within my members wretched and
[9:22] miserable man that I am
[9:24] oh will rescue me and set me free from
[9:27] his body of death this corrupt real
[9:29] Mortal existence thanks be to God for my
[9:32] Deliverance
[9:34] are you glad for his Deliverance amen
[9:36] through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then on
[9:40] the one hand I myself with my lime with
[9:44] my mind serve a law of God but on the
[9:46] other with my flesh my human nature my
[9:50] worldliness my sinful capacity I serve
[9:52] the law of sin so you see the difference
[9:55] here you see this battle that's going on
[9:57] right
[9:58] first of all I want to I want to make
[10:00] sure we understand that there's an
[10:02] appetite and every human there's an
[10:04] appetite for something right even in our
[10:06] natural bodies I was even thinking of
[10:08] you know a run runner in the appetite
[10:10] and what you need as a runner to you
[10:13] know to take to take on a race or take
[10:15] on a challenge right you need the right
[10:17] appetite you need the right diet right
[10:18] you need the right diet
[10:20] so I ask you tonight how is your app or
[10:23] how is your appetite has your appetite
[10:25] changed as far as spiritually thinking
[10:27] spiritually minded here check your
[10:29] appetite who gives the change in this
[10:32] appetite because we were all born in sin
[10:34] shaped in iniquity right we had an
[10:36] appetite for something but it wasn't for
[10:39] the things of God right it was for
[10:41] something else
[10:42] and then who gives the ultimate appetite
[10:45] change Christ gives the ultimate
[10:47] appetite change amen you believe that
[10:50] on a soul level when your soul has been
[10:52] quickened when it's come to life there
[10:55] is a change in appetite you believe that
[10:57] whatever a man thinketh so is he amen
[11:01] when someone is lost in unbelief he's
[11:03] hungry for he's hunger he's hungering
[11:06] he's got an appetite for something he he
[11:08] fleshly desires right it's his flesh
[11:10] taking control right when the soul has
[11:13] been quickened so when someone is an
[11:16] unbelief or that Soul hasn't been
[11:18] changed his hunger for self he has a
[11:21] hunger for self he hungers with that
[11:22] without an experience without the person
[11:24] of Jesus Christ man hungers for self
[11:28] selfish desires and it's a my will right
[11:30] to my will amen so you catching the
[11:33] thought tonight are you catching a
[11:34] little bit what I'm trying to say about
[11:36] appetite right the appetite hasn't
[11:38] changed amen
[11:39] so we go to Mark 7 18-22
[11:43] and he said unto them are ye so without
[11:46] understanding so he's talking to the at
[11:48] first he's talking to the Pharisees but
[11:50] this he's talking to the disciples
[11:51] because the Pharisees are asking your
[11:55] disciples they're they're eating unclean
[11:57] unclean things they're not washing their
[11:59] hands before they eat right they're not
[12:01] eating they're they're eating this so
[12:03] he's he's answering the disciples right
[12:05] see those Pharisees they left they left
[12:08] they don't want they don't want for
[12:09] their understanding but the disciples
[12:11] the chosen ones they want something more
[12:13] amen amen how many want something more
[12:15] amen they don't settle for just like oh
[12:18] I don't know God will reveal it to you
[12:19] amen amen he's faithful to do it every
[12:22] time praise the Lord
[12:25] are you so without understanding also
[12:28] do you not perceive that whatsoever
[12:30] thing from without from without interest
[12:34] into a man it cannot defile him but it
[12:37] enters not into his heart but into a
[12:40] belly and goeth out into the drought
[12:42] purging all Meats so I'm reading from
[12:44] the Amplified here excuse me and he said
[12:47] that which cometh out of a man that
[12:50] defileth a man
[12:51] for from within out of the heart of men
[12:54] perceive evil thoughts right evil
[12:57] thoughts adulteries fornications murders
[12:58] thefts covetousness wickedness deceit
[13:02] lasciviousness in the evil eye
[13:05] blasphemy Pride foolishness all these
[13:08] evil things Cometh From Within
[13:10] and defile a man
[13:12] so he's he's catching the distinction
[13:14] that's what defiles a man
[13:16] so we have this
[13:18] but when a man
[13:20] so you have this distinction here right
[13:22] that's what defiles a man is what what's
[13:24] coming from within from without right
[13:26] he's born with it right but when a man
[13:29] is Born Again a new creation in Christ
[13:33] his appetite changes
[13:35] I'm no longer hungry for the things of
[13:37] the world and what they're what they're
[13:39] offering right just like our songs was
[13:42] what song was saying by by our choir
[13:43] here amen it's from it's from it's from
[13:46] those those those thoughts into the
[13:49] righteous thoughts amen amen so
[13:52] but no longer hunger for the worldly
[13:56] living that's how what's happened your
[13:58] soul has been converted right it has a
[14:01] change from my appetite and what I
[14:03] desire to what God wants in his desire
[14:07] on a soul level that is all you want now
[14:10] as Mary said be it unto me according to
[14:13] Thy Word
[14:14] no selfishness now impregnated with that
[14:18] word amen praise the Lord hallelujah
[14:23] so you know your appetite changes and I
[14:26] encourage this is just an example I
[14:28] heard a long time ago but you kind of
[14:30] challenge yourself as a as a young
[14:32] person right you kind of challenge
[14:33] yourself like Lord have I had the new
[14:35] birth and it was a minister one time
[14:38] that that talked or he was preaching and
[14:40] he said he said Just Close Your Eyes for
[14:43] a second why don't we all do that close
[14:45] your eyes close your eyes
[14:47] and give you a week God gives us a week
[14:49] with no repercussions of our sin right
[14:52] where does your desires lie
[14:55] where where what do you actually want if
[14:58] there's no repercussions during that
[14:59] week and
[15:01] so you can open your eyes now but
[15:04] there's no repercussions during that
[15:05] week what would you do where does your
[15:08] desires like and it's such a challenging
[15:09] thought where would we be right
[15:12] amen because there was because there if
[15:14] there's not an appetite there amen then
[15:17] if there's not been that appetite change
[15:19] then there you know you you're still
[15:22] you're still at Phase One amen
[15:25] so we need that appetite change we need
[15:27] more than anything in this world we need
[15:30] abort we need a new birth amen you must
[15:32] be born again amen
[15:36] so I encourage every young person here
[15:39] tonight who has not experienced God for
[15:41] themselves it's not about anyone next to
[15:43] you but you you as an individual come
[15:48] into contact with that person Jesus
[15:50] Christ
[15:51] there's still that opportunity today do
[15:54] you believe that there's still an
[15:55] opportunity amen don't miss your
[15:58] opportunity tonight it's not too late
[16:00] the hour is late but it's not too late
[16:04] amen praise the Lord I'd like to
[16:07] encourage you with this scripture
[16:09] tonight Ephesians 2 1.
[16:12] one through ten turn with me I love the
[16:14] scripture one of my favorite scriptures
[16:16] here
[16:19] and you have to be Quicken
[16:21] we just had the we just had brother
[16:24] amen he just he just gave it to us so
[16:26] simple tonight amen repent amen be
[16:30] baptized amen trust Jesus we complicate
[16:34] it so much in what the new birth means
[16:35] amen repent and be baptized everyone in
[16:38] you in the name of the name of Jesus
[16:40] Christ amen and you shout and you have
[16:43] he quickened who are dead in trespasses
[16:46] and sin wherein in time past you walked
[16:49] according to the course of this world
[16:51] according to the prince of the power of
[16:53] the air the spirit that now worketh in
[16:55] Children of Disobedience among whom also
[16:59] we had all had our conversation in times
[17:01] past and the lust of the flesh filling
[17:04] the desires of the flesh you see this
[17:06] going on the distinction
[17:07] filling the desires of the Flesh and of
[17:09] the mind and where by Nature the
[17:13] children of Wrath even as others
[17:15] but God
[17:17] but God Hallelujah the God who is rich
[17:20] in Mercy for his great love wherewith he
[17:23] loved us
[17:24] even when we were dead in sins
[17:27] before we even thought he quickened us
[17:30] together with Christ by Grace ye are
[17:33] saved Allelujah and hath raised us up
[17:36] together and made us sit together in
[17:38] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus aren't
[17:41] you glad tonight
[17:42] that in the ages to come
[17:45] you might show the exceeding Riches of
[17:47] his great his grace his kindness towards
[17:50] us through Christ Jesus
[17:52] for by Grace you are safe through faith
[17:55] and that not of ourselves it is the gift
[17:58] of God
[18:00] praise the Lord not of works
[18:02] lest any man should boast
[18:05] for we are his workmanship created in
[18:08] Christ Jesus unto good works which God
[18:11] hath before ordained that we should walk
[18:13] in them
[18:15] without where wherefore remember that ye
[18:19] being in times past Gentiles in the
[18:21] flesh
[18:22] who are called uncircumcised by that
[18:25] which is called the circumcision in the
[18:27] flesh made by hand
[18:29] that added that at that time ye were
[18:33] without Christ being aliens from the
[18:36] Commonwealth of Israel and strangers
[18:38] from the covenants of Promise having no
[18:40] hope and without God in the world
[18:43] but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes
[18:47] were afar off are made nigh Alleluia by
[18:50] the blood of Christ
[18:52] praise the Lord for he is our peace who
[18:55] hath made both one and hath broken down
[18:57] the middle wall
[18:59] partitioned between us
[19:01] definitely
[19:02] man we we passed it so that's where I
[19:05] wanted to get at not it works less any
[19:07] man should boast we are as workmanship
[19:09] created in Christ Jesus unto good works
[19:11] now
[19:12] we must remember this is God's grace and
[19:15] all his doing this process of of the new
[19:18] birth it's all his doing he's the one
[19:20] that draws amen he does the changing he
[19:23] does the filling amen
[19:25] amen my life was messed up but he came
[19:28] in amen
[19:29] praise the Lord
[19:31] so now we have this new birth amen how
[19:34] many how many I I know you know it's a
[19:37] it's a rhetorical question but you know
[19:39] I want to have the confidence that you
[19:41] know even when ministers say it's like
[19:43] who's been born again I want a
[19:44] confidence to say yes Lord I know that I
[19:47] know that I know that's what I want amen
[19:48] so now the battle starts right we have
[19:51] this new birth experience right this is
[19:54] when the battle starts right this is the
[19:56] true mind battle where the battle starts
[19:59] amen before your seed was quickened you
[20:02] had you had nothing you had nothing in
[20:05] you to fight the battle but a Believer
[20:07] now has what they need to overcome every
[20:10] Temptation amen they've got something
[20:11] within them that's going to hold them
[20:13] amen I'm not saying that we become
[20:16] perfect in ourselves but what God has
[20:18] placed within us is perfect because it
[20:20] is the word amen we have something to
[20:23] fight with now amen the battle has
[20:25] started so now we can really sing that
[20:28] song This Means War
[20:31] oh yes
[20:33] This Means War do you believe that we
[20:37] have now have the battle amen that's
[20:39] where the battle is now we've got
[20:41] something to fight with aren't you glad
[20:42] we have something to fight with amen
[20:45] before we had nothing to fight with her
[20:47] with the Enemy amen his hand was
[20:49] protecting us all along until he until
[20:51] that until that seed was quickened right
[20:53] but now we have something to fight with
[20:55] amen and overcome with amen praise the
[20:59] Lord
[21:01] amen now we can sing Victory with
[21:03] confidence amen and not only that but we
[21:06] are guaranteed a w amen we are
[21:09] guaranteed a w
[21:11] amen
[21:13] praise the Lord we're on The Winning
[21:15] Side questions and answers if we could
[21:18] pull that quote up tonight
[21:20] sometimes I
[21:21] I want to take my time on this quote but
[21:23] he actually answers the question here
[21:25] answers the question of the scripture
[21:27] here we have these two forces fighting
[21:29] all the time right two forces good and
[21:31] evil right
[21:33] well they wrote out the scriptures
[21:35] so he he's got the question here about
[21:37] the scripture Romans 7 there that that
[21:39] Paul speaking to Romans
[21:49] I said let me just kind of Polish it up
[21:52] so you can see
[21:54] he said in me is two persons
[21:58] right
[21:59] one wants me to do wrong the other one
[22:02] wants me to do and every time I start to
[22:05] do right then the wrong hinders me
[22:09] how many of you people on the interviews
[22:11] this afternoon has run into the same
[22:13] thing
[22:15] has anyone run into the same thing
[22:18] and this morning the same thing I spoke
[22:20] on it this morning temporarily
[22:23] and our and out you are an outward man
[22:25] which is controlled by the six senses
[22:27] right you got taste feel smell sound
[22:30] look right you have all those senses
[22:32] right you even have a spirit right
[22:35] conscious imagination all those things
[22:37] you guys know that you guys know that
[22:39] you are an inward man controlled by one
[22:41] sense which is Faith right
[22:44] you have that inward conscious you have
[22:46] that inward man that has is Faith right
[22:50] success the sick in all the six senses
[22:53] if the six senses don't agree with faith
[22:56] look how simple he puts this but one is
[22:59] contrary to the other now as long as the
[23:01] six senses agree with faith wonderful
[23:05] but when the six senses disagree with
[23:07] the faith then leave the six senses
[23:09] alone right now for instance here Jesus
[23:13] made a statement a promise
[23:15] the inside man says that's true right
[23:19] face calling out that's true the outside
[23:21] man reasons that it can't be true to you
[23:24] then ignore the outside man and accept
[23:27] the Inside Man right
[23:30] what a battle
[23:31] amen now that's the same thing that
[23:34] Paul's speaking of he was sold into the
[23:36] law of carnal sin every one of us is the
[23:39] same
[23:40] that's the reason we are having the
[23:42] troubles we do of marriage four or five
[23:44] times than this and that and all the
[23:46] kinds of sin and adulteries and
[23:48] everything else along in our lives it's
[23:49] because those things we are carnal right
[23:52] and that part must perish amen but then
[23:56] inside we are Spirit Man soul inside
[24:00] and that's faith in God's word amen
[24:03] that's what's calling out that's the
[24:05] real you amen then then we bring our
[24:08] outside body under subjection to the
[24:11] Word of Faith by accepting what God Said
[24:13] Amen you hear a word he's an athanir let
[24:16] him hear amen Faith cometh by hearing
[24:19] amen
[24:21] praise the Lord amen what a simple what
[24:24] a simple ex what a simple explanation of
[24:26] that of that word here so I I I was last
[24:30] couple days I've been reading the
[24:31] greatest battle I ever fought and where
[24:32] is that does anyone know
[24:34] it's the mind right right so where's the
[24:37] where's the Battleground amen it is in
[24:40] the mind who wins the one you feed the
[24:44] most
[24:45] what are you feeding what are you
[24:47] feeding on Amen so questions I'm giving
[24:50] you challenging you tonight and man it's
[24:52] okay to be challenging the presence of
[24:54] the Lord amen there's not a one-night
[24:56] experience when when you hit an altar
[24:59] one night yes you've been changed but
[25:01] it's a it's a process you're getting
[25:03] somewhere a man with adoption you're
[25:04] getting to that amen praise the Lord
[25:06] until our glorified bodies we're still
[25:08] in that process every single day amen
[25:10] and I want to live for him all to you
[25:12] Lord I Surrender amen praise the Lord
[25:16] so I show this picture tonight
[25:18] so who wins God's Duty bound to fill the
[25:21] hungry soul
[25:23] say at Thy word Lord
[25:25] blessed are they that hunger and thirst
[25:28] for righteousness for they shall be
[25:29] filled amen
[25:31] so this is uh I actually found the
[25:34] direct
[25:35] um the the direct poem or the direct um
[25:39] phrase of what brother braham's talking
[25:41] about in this this war of the Mind Right
[25:43] the greatest battle ever fought right
[25:46] you have these two good and evil and I'd
[25:48] like to share this with you because it's
[25:50] it's uh it's a it helped me it helped me
[25:53] so much in my Christian walk because you
[25:55] think as soon as you become born again
[25:57] as far as the Flesh and the spirit you
[25:59] you have this High expectation that
[26:01] these you're going to be perfect right
[26:03] and you will be perfect on the other
[26:05] side amen you will be perfect right that
[26:08] soul that Soul's been changed amen that
[26:11] Soul's that soul is restored that Soul's
[26:13] redeemed amen but that but the flesh and
[26:16] the spirit right the Flesh and the
[26:18] spirit they can come under these things
[26:19] they can be they can be fed and they can
[26:21] get they can get um they can get into
[26:23] flesh they can get in the spirit right
[26:25] those things waiver those things waiver
[26:27] but that soul that soul is our anchor
[26:29] amen amen the holy spirit in our soul
[26:32] that is our anchor amen praise the Lord
[26:35] I hope you're seeing it clear tonight
[26:37] amen the tale of two wolves this is the
[26:40] story of the converted Chief I'm sure
[26:42] you've heard it before but if you
[26:43] haven't here you go
[26:45] the tale of two wolves one evening a
[26:48] Cherokee Elder was teaching
[26:50] his grandson about life
[26:52] a fight is going on inside me he said to
[26:55] the boy it's a terrible fight
[26:57] and it's between two wolves
[27:00] this battle that goes on between the two
[27:02] wolves is inside us all
[27:05] the wolf
[27:07] one wolf is evil
[27:09] he is anger Envy jealousy sorrow regret
[27:13] greed arrogance self-pity guilt
[27:17] resentment inferiority
[27:20] lies
[27:22] false Pride superiority ego
[27:25] he continued the other is good
[27:30] he is joy
[27:32] peace love hope
[27:35] Serenity humility kindness
[27:38] Hallelujah benefolence
[27:43] empathy generosity truth compassion and
[27:46] faith wow
[27:48] the grandson thought about it for a
[27:50] minute and then asks his grandfather
[27:52] which wolf will win
[27:55] wisely the grandfather simply smiled and
[27:57] replied
[27:58] the one you feed the most
[28:01] amen
[28:03] are you catching what I'm getting to I'm
[28:04] getting at tonight
[28:05] so we have this constant battle going on
[28:07] between this evil dog and this this uh
[28:10] this uh this good dog this white and
[28:13] black right which one wins it's the one
[28:15] you feed the most it's the one who's on
[28:18] the bulking diet right sometimes as a as
[28:21] a bodybuilder you start to bulk right
[28:23] it's the one on the bulking diet amen
[28:26] so it's the one on the bulking guy if
[28:29] that white dog is starving this is
[28:31] pretty direct here but I want to
[28:32] encourage you amen I want to encourage
[28:34] you if that white dog if that good dog
[28:36] right is starving throughout the week
[28:39] and only gets fed on Sundays and
[28:41] Wednesdays
[28:43] or every other Youth Camp
[28:46] how do you expect to have the confidence
[28:48] to shun the enemy when it attacks
[28:54] because as a Believer you are now the
[28:56] devil's Target right he doesn't worry
[28:58] about the ones in the world he's worried
[29:00] about you now he's he's got his guns
[29:02] towards you amen how are you gonna have
[29:04] the confidence if you're not feeding
[29:06] that white dog are you catching what I'm
[29:07] I'm getting at tonight amen in the enemy
[29:10] when he attacks because as a believer
[29:13] you think I'm getting a little ahead of
[29:15] it myself he wants to destroy what God
[29:18] started on the inside right that's his
[29:20] goal but we have a promise when God
[29:23] starts something he is faithful to
[29:25] complete it you believe that Allelujah
[29:28] it's faithful and just to complete it
[29:30] how did Jesus overcome the enemy what
[29:33] did he say as it is written what does he
[29:36] combat it with the word of God Amen he
[29:38] meets him on his battleground of the
[29:40] mind and he takes God at his word with
[29:42] faith amen he's feeding that white dog
[29:44] amen every day Hallelujah
[29:47] what is he doing I love this even I even
[29:50] looked up the scripture this is in
[29:51] Deuteronomy what the Lord says he says
[29:54] this is when when our lord Jesus he's
[29:56] hungry in the desert right this is when
[29:58] Satan's battling him in his mind right
[30:00] he says this is Deuteronomy 8 3 he says
[30:04] it says man does not live by bread alone
[30:07] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[30:09] the mouth of God the Lord doth men live
[30:12] see the scripture this scripture is dead
[30:14] when it's not being used to combat the
[30:17] enemy and it's just letter form amen but
[30:19] when it's used in a believer's heart and
[30:21] that Faith Rises up and says at Thy word
[30:24] Lord amen as it is written amen there's
[30:27] no devil in hell that can come in
[30:30] between you now amen there's no
[30:32] temptation amen you've got his word amen
[30:36] but you got to feed that amen you got to
[30:38] feed that experience yes there yes there
[30:41] is an experience you have with the Lord
[30:43] and there's there's a change sometimes
[30:44] you don't even know when that change
[30:45] happened right sometimes you don't let
[30:47] that change but Lord wherever I'm at I
[30:50] gotta feed the white dog I gotta feed
[30:53] that experience amen Lord wherever I'm
[30:56] at I've got to feed that white dog amen
[30:58] praise the Lord because that's the one
[31:00] that's going to win so now
[31:03] so now when the doctors gives you a
[31:05] diagnosis what Rises up in a Believer by
[31:09] his stripes I am healed amen when you
[31:12] have thoughts that I'm not pretty
[31:14] that word comes up and says I am
[31:17] fearfully and wonderfully made amen when
[31:20] the enemy comes in like a flood the
[31:23] spirit of God in you raises up a
[31:25] standard against her the spirit when the
[31:27] spirit of God is in you the spirit of
[31:29] God the standards don't get lower the
[31:31] standards always go up at the Spirit of
[31:33] God's in you amen praise the Lord
[31:36] do the distinction the battle the
[31:38] Battleground
[31:39] the Battleground is the mind because
[31:41] it's where decisions happen and then
[31:43] that's the crossroads amen so you have
[31:46] this black dog and I'm going to get real
[31:47] down to earth with you if you don't mind
[31:49] for a minute amen you mind if I get down
[31:51] to earth here rubber meets the road amen
