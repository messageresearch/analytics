[6:03] blessed is the man that walketh not in
[6:06] the Council of the ungodly
[6:08] nor standeth in the way of sinners
[6:11] nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful
[6:14] but his Delight is in the law of the
[6:17] Lord and his in his law doth he meditate
[6:21] day and night
[6:23] and he shall be like a tree planted by
[6:26] the rivers of water that bringeth forth
[6:28] his fruit in his season his Leaf also
[6:32] shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth
[6:35] shall prosper I say Amen to that second
[6:39] Corinthians chapter 10 will be a verse
[6:42] related to the subject this morning
[6:45] second Corinthians chapter 10
[6:47] and we'll just add this in to bring us
[6:49] into the channel of the thought second
[6:51] Corinthians chapter 10 and verse 5.
[6:56] casting down imaginations
[6:59] in every High thing that exalteth itself
[7:04] against the knowledge of God and
[7:07] bringing into captivity every thought
[7:12] every thought
[7:15] what a Christian Life
[7:17] bringing into captivity every thought
[7:20] how many have has a lot of thoughts come
[7:22] to you how many no some of them aren't
[7:24] of God
[7:26] bringing in the Captivity every thought
[7:30] to The Obedience of Christ I can't do
[7:35] that for you
[7:36] I don't even think the Lord does that
[7:38] for you
[7:39] you in submission you do this
[7:42] you bring into captivity every thought
[7:45] so there might be a lot of things we
[7:47] don't have control over in this world
[7:49] but I believe a Christian has control
[7:51] over his thoughts to direct His Thoughts
[7:53] by the Holy Ghost within him now Psalms
[7:56] chapter 1 is turned into a bit of a
[7:57] series here and I didn't expect that but
[8:00] it did and it's about where the believer
[8:03] positions himself it's really about that
[8:06] in three verses it really speaks of
[8:09] where a Believer possesses himself
[8:11] himself so that he can have perfect
[8:13] faith and that he can live a prosperous
[8:16] life spiritually he can live a life
[8:19] that's um before God and we found on
[8:22] Wednesday night that the first thing
[8:23] that he does is he he positions himself
[8:26] away from the influences of ungodly
[8:29] counsel away from the influence of the
[8:32] way of Sinners and away from sitting in
[8:35] the seat of the scornful so it's
[8:37] specific things that we talked about
[8:38] Wednesday night if you want to hear it
[8:40] I'm sure that they have it there where
[8:42] it's specific so that that's the first
[8:44] thing as a Believer has to position
[8:47] himself away from certain influences if
[8:50] he doesn't he can't live in Victory if
[8:52] she doesn't she can't live in Victory if
[8:55] you're not willing to separate yourself
[8:56] from wrong things and the seed of the
[8:59] scornful and all these things we
[9:01] mentioned that you're then you're really
[9:02] not willing to live in full victory
[9:04] so now when we separate ourselves that's
[9:06] the only the first step but that's not
[9:09] all we find more here that if you
[9:12] sanctify and separate yourself it's it's
[9:15] there's something about it that when you
[9:17] separate and sanctify yourself for the
[9:20] Lord you have to fill your life with
[9:22] something else
[9:25] I mean he knows the scripture Jesus said
[9:27] uh uh the spirits in a man and in a
[9:30] vessel and a house and then they're
[9:32] cleaned out and if that man doesn't get
[9:34] filled then seven other demons come and
[9:37] fill him because there's another process
[9:39] there's another step to be filled with
[9:41] the Holy Ghost can you say Amen you may
[9:43] sanctify your life and separate this but
[9:45] if you don't replace it with something
[9:47] else then you're going to be weak again
[9:49] and Jesus even says other demons will
[9:51] come back so we learned that's something
[9:54] that's throughout the Bible that a
[9:55] Believer can't just separate himself
[9:57] from things of the world but he has to
[10:00] be filling himself with the right things
[10:03] be filled that's why you have terms in
[10:05] the Bible like be filled with the spirit
[10:07] walk in the spirit
[10:10] receive ye the Holy Ghost he gave the
[10:12] Holy Ghost to them that obey him that's
[10:15] the truth brothers and sisters and
[10:16] anybody is under those rules any of
[10:18] human beings are under those rules you
[10:20] can sanctify your life to the max but
[10:23] unless you're exposing yourself to the
[10:25] word of God and feeding on the word of
[10:27] God and saying Lord fill me with your
[10:29] spirit and keep me filled with your
[10:31] spirit so this man in Psalms 1 if we
[10:34] look at it he's a blessed man of God
[10:36] blessed is the man he's blessed and it
[10:39] says first of all that his Delight is in
[10:42] the law of the Lord so we find something
[10:45] that that this is a passion this is
[10:47] something that he gives his life to his
[10:50] passion and his Delight is in the word
[10:55] he's not only separated himself from
[10:57] other influences but his passion his
[11:00] thrust his attention his desire is to be
[11:04] filled with the word
[11:07] and to stay in the word can you say Amen
[11:11] and so above anything else the word is
[11:14] his passion it's his Delight
[11:16] I'm going to linger on this a bit
[11:18] because we know we have sometimes where
[11:21] people it's it's a duty
[11:25] but it's not a delight
[11:29] in this man it's not a duty to be in the
[11:31] word it's his Delight and if it's not
[11:34] that to you to you all you have to say
[11:36] is the Lord deal with my heart because I
[11:38] want it to be a delight
[11:41] I want it to be a passion
[11:43] and to this fella here he's blessed
[11:45] because his passion and Delight is in
[11:47] the word it's above anything else the
[11:50] word is exciting to him is the word
[11:52] exciting to you it's exciting to him he
[11:55] can't wait to hear the word he can't
[11:57] wait to get to church
[11:59] David was this kind of person about the
[12:02] word because he said I was glad when
[12:04] they came and told me let's go to the
[12:06] house of the Lord the The Chariot is
[12:08] outside waiting it's time to go to
[12:10] church it's the set time at 11 o'clock
[12:13] what 10 30 whatever it is and David said
[12:15] something Rose in me when they came and
[12:18] told me the chariot's ready it's warmed
[12:20] up ready to go and when they said it's
[12:21] time to go something rose up and says I
[12:24] was glad when they said unto me let's go
[12:26] to the house of the Lord
[12:31] it wasn't a duty it was a delight
[12:35] it's exciting to them can't wait to get
[12:37] to church can't wait to open his Bible
[12:40] and read it can't wait to have time to
[12:42] get into his word this and I want you to
[12:45] catch this point because we'll go into
[12:46] this a little bit more this is at a
[12:48] desire level on the inside of this man
[12:51] and it's a desire level is at the soul
[12:54] level
[12:56] and Paul says the Commandments of God
[12:58] are not Grievous to us
[13:00] this is not Grievous this is enjoyable
[13:02] this is not I have to
[13:05] this is I get to
[13:07] come on now say Amen this is not I have
[13:10] to do this this is I get to do this
[13:14] big difference can you say Amen this is
[13:17] not a pressure this is a passion
[13:20] this is not a drudgery this is a desire
[13:23] this is not someone telling you to do it
[13:26] or you need it this is your soul telling
[13:29] you that you want it it's at a desire
[13:31] level it's at a soul level
[13:33] but you see now it's not just reading it
[13:35] it's not just his passion is for it but
[13:39] as he takes it to the next thing he says
[13:42] his Delight is in the law of the Lord
[13:43] but he so loves it that in this law in
[13:47] the word he does meditate day and night
[13:50] so it's not just that he has the desire
[13:52] it's not just he has a passion for the
[13:54] word of God it's not just that it's this
[13:58] this Uh something's consuming him on the
[14:00] inside but he takes it further because
[14:03] he he takes this word and he lets it be
[14:07] lodged in his mind and in his thoughts
[14:11] if somebody says I'm meditating on this
[14:13] day and night as much as I can I'm going
[14:16] to meditate on his word that's somebody
[14:19] that's saying I want his word to not
[14:22] just invade my soul
[14:24] but I want his word to invade my thought
[14:27] life
[14:30] and I want to tell you that's deeper
[14:33] than just a desire in the soul
[14:37] that's why I titled this this morning
[14:39] victory
[14:41] in our thought life
[14:45] how many want a victory in your thought
[14:47] life
[14:48] that's this that's the secret place
[14:52] you can put on a lot of things at church
[14:53] but nobody knows what your thought life
[14:55] is
[14:57] only you and God
[14:59] and the devil can plant thoughts there
[15:02] he doesn't know the secrets of the
[15:04] thought secrets of her God does so it's
[15:06] you and God so so I can preach about
[15:08] this today but I don't know what your
[15:09] thought life is now I can watch your
[15:11] life and there's enough evidence to show
[15:13] what you think about most is going to
[15:15] come out it's gonna you know it's like
[15:17] it's here and and then it comes and it
[15:19] spills out of your mouth eventually so
[15:22] you can tell what people are thinking
[15:23] because the Bible says whatsoever a man
[15:25] thinketh in his heart so is he
[15:28] and so you'll see eventually but really
[15:30] nobody knows what you're thinking even
[15:32] right now maybe you're thinking of lunch
[15:34] already but I want to tell you put that
[15:36] out of your mind because this is your
[15:38] true lunch first this has to be your
[15:40] lunch
[15:43] I mean he's glad to be at lunch today
[15:46] amen we're glad you made the trip but we
[15:48] got to get into it a little bit we say
[15:50] Lord feed me feed me feed me
[15:53] feed me in my soul so now this fella
[15:57] he's he's getting it lodged in his mind
[16:00] he he lives a life that he has to switch
[16:02] out his thoughts always back to the word
[16:05] he meditates day and night so he he if
[16:08] he's a human being he has other thoughts
[16:10] he has wrong thoughts he has a lot of
[16:13] things hitting him but he has learned
[16:14] that he must meditate in the word
[16:16] because he has to live a life of
[16:17] switching out wrong thoughts and
[16:20] replacing it with the word and that's
[16:22] why I read to you bringing every thought
[16:24] captive into captivity bring every
[16:28] thought into captivity every thought not
[16:30] just letting other ones go through can
[16:32] you say Amen
[16:33] not just letting all the other things
[16:36] just and some of them just slept through
[16:38] because they're not going to be scanned
[16:40] you know let me just say this
[16:43] um
[16:44] so the children maybe will understand
[16:45] all of us understand better after 9-1-1
[16:49] our country changed
[16:53] and all the rules changed it changed
[16:56] everything can you say man
[16:58] and to elaborate on it it's because
[17:02] that all of a sudden now we thought we
[17:04] were safe and we thought we were okay
[17:07] but an enemy snuck in without us knowing
[17:11] it through our borders
[17:13] and we didn't know that it snuck in it
[17:15] snuck in with guns and actually stayed
[17:17] here for many years within the state
[17:19] Among Us and getting trained in in a in
[17:22] Pilot School without our own country all
[17:25] this happened and we did not know that
[17:27] it slipped in
[17:29] with a plan to not just be in our
[17:32] country there's a plan to do what it
[17:35] planned to do and all you know what it
[17:36] is if your children don't know they come
[17:38] they train to be pilots and then on
[17:41] 9-1-1 they they took over the pilot in
[17:44] three airplanes and one of them was the
[17:47] plan was and listen friends Satan has a
[17:50] plan Satan has a plan when he gives you
[17:54] the wrong thoughts it's not just the
[17:56] thought he has a plan
[17:58] he's a planner can you say mine that's
[18:01] why you have to be a planner so when
[18:03] these things come and he slips in they
[18:05] had a plan and that was to learn to be a
[18:07] pilot so they would take over the plane
[18:08] and redirect one plane into the Twin
[18:11] Towers in New York redirect another
[18:13] plane into the Pentagon and then plans
[18:15] to redirect the third plane they think
[18:17] into the White House and destroy the
[18:19] White House that one didn't make it but
[18:21] look at the enemy's plan and look why it
[18:23] happened and after that day with however
[18:26] many people that died the country was
[18:28] torn apart how did this ending begin in
[18:31] but after that point everything had to
[18:34] change
[18:36] and our security level had to go up
[18:40] and in our airports and everywhere had
[18:44] to have scanners to scan everybody
[18:47] including me including you good people
[18:49] bad people
[18:51] has never done anything hard anything
[18:53] wrong their whole life every Everything
[18:55] has to be scanned
[18:59] we didn't have that before I could just
[19:01] walk into the airport and go to my plane
[19:03] not anymore
[19:04] now I got to take my belt off and my
[19:06] shoes off and I gotta lay everything up
[19:08] there take everything out of my pockets
[19:09] all this and every person has to do it
[19:12] can you say man why why did it happen
[19:13] because something slipped in
[19:16] I'm going to tell you about your
[19:17] Christian Life okay
[19:20] let me talk about your life okay
[19:23] I believe that every Christian every
[19:26] Christian
[19:27] will no doubt have a 911 that happens in
[19:32] their life
[19:35] you might have more than one
[19:37] if you don't learn your lesson
[19:41] in fact just so that our teenagers and
[19:43] our children can know how many would
[19:45] older ones that's been serving the lord
[19:47] how many has learned you've had a 911 in
[19:50] your life and what I mean by that is
[19:52] that the devil slipped in and gotcha and
[19:55] brought destruction because he slipped
[19:57] into something you wouldn't normally
[19:58] think he would have slipped in and how
[19:59] many raise your hands say it started in
[20:01] the thought life
[20:03] come on raise your hand appreciate you
[20:05] being honest so everybody's here has had
[20:06] a 911 and what it do it jolts you even
[20:09] as a Christian at Joe should say wait a
[20:11] minute I've got to put a higher Security
[20:12] in place
[20:14] okay so we go through these airports and
[20:17] we have uh things that we have to do and
[20:20] we have to run uh people everybody no
[20:23] matter how good looking they are no
[20:25] matter how nice a suit they have on no
[20:28] matter how great a song leader he is how
[20:30] many thinks he's a good song leader
[20:33] [Applause]
[20:38] no matter how good-looking he is
[20:41] taken from his dad
[20:44] trying to put a good word for you bud
[20:48] no matter the high standard that he
[20:50] lives in the Christian Life he lives no
[20:52] matter what when he comes to that
[20:53] airport
[20:54] he gets scanned like everybody else
[20:58] you understand and so now so Gideon
[21:01] let's let's pretend now that this is
[21:04] from here you're gonna walk up here and
[21:06] you're going to walk through a scanner
[21:07] we're going to check you out and I want
[21:09] everybody to associate this stuff if
[21:10] there's something notice now we don't
[21:12] know what he has on him so we have even
[21:15] though he says he's a good guy we have
[21:17] to check and see if he has anything on
[21:19] him because usually the devil's hiding
[21:21] something to slip through the security
[21:23] everybody listen typing what what I'm
[21:26] saying here this morning so now we need
[21:28] a security guard Solomon you come and I
[21:30] want you to help me scan this fellow
[21:32] because he's trying to come in he looks
[21:34] like a good guy
[21:39] and everything has to go out okay take
[21:43] your phone okay so everything looks good
[21:46] take your jacket off
[21:48] all right everything is confiscated so
[21:51] now as you walk up here okay A lot of
[21:54] times what happens as you walk up here
[21:55] you come through this scanner and it
[21:58] could be beep beep beep beep beep beep
[22:02] would you step back down there please
[22:04] all right check them out because there's
[22:06] something wrong there's something he's
[22:07] trying to get through quote something
[22:09] what do you have anything in your pocket
[22:12] yeah
[22:14] that's what it is issues all right keys
[22:22] what's that
[22:24] let me see that
[22:26] okay and if we're talking about a
[22:28] thought sneaking through I'm going to
[22:29] call this the devil says the days of
[22:31] Miracles are past
[22:36] that thought doesn't come from God
[22:39] what are you doing with this and what
[22:40] are you trying to get over that thought
[22:41] doesn't belong in God and so we'll
[22:44] confiscate that and I can't believe
[22:46] you're trying to get through the kingdom
[22:48] of God with that thought in your mind
[22:52] come and try it again
[22:57] what is it what is it now
[23:00] check it now what is that what does he
[23:02] have anything else there
[23:06] what what is this mechanism
[23:09] this is a thought that says you're
[23:11] Unworthy of the kingdom of God you've
[23:14] done things to feel unworthy
[23:18] that's a thought that didn't come from
[23:20] God and it can't make it through this
[23:22] scanner
[23:28] one more time one more time okay
[23:30] beep beep
[23:39] what's this thought here huh
[23:42] you have anything else in here pockets
[23:45] never mind
[23:46] don't do that
[23:51] what's this thought here
[23:53] this thought is
[23:58] bad movies don't affect me as a
[24:00] Christian it only affects other people
[24:02] I can watch this I can listen to it and
[24:04] it doesn't affect me
[24:07] now Solomon and Gideon and I could go on
[24:10] with this all day long
[24:13] but I want an illustration to show you
[24:15] the Bible says bringing every thought
[24:18] into captivity you have to have a
[24:20] scanner on your thought life if it's not
[24:23] of God it stops right there and it gets
[24:26] dumped out
[24:27] so now
[24:29] this brother his thinking is directed
[24:31] his thought life is checked it's it's
[24:34] and then the Bible says he has to
[24:36] meditate it on it on the word day and
[24:38] night so not only does he kick out wrong
[24:41] thought thoughts but he replaces them
[24:43] with the thoughts of God are you doing
[24:45] that
[24:47] day and night I want to put something in
[24:49] my mind I want to be filling my mind
[24:50] this is how you work as a human being
[24:52] this is how God created you can you say
[24:55] amen and the devil's more aware of how
[24:57] your thought life influences you he's
[24:59] more aware than human beings we got
[25:01] millions if not billions of human beings
[25:03] on the face of the Earth that feed on
[25:05] things and they don't realize the power
[25:07] of the mind and the power of their
[25:08] thought life we have murderers in in
[25:11] jail can you say amen and it's because
[25:13] they didn't understand the principle of
[25:16] the power of a thought life
[25:18] and where it started is in the thought
[25:21] life
[25:22] nothing got checked can you say amen and
[25:25] so he focuses his mind on the word of
[25:27] God or on positive things and he dumps
[25:30] out and he scans the wrong thoughts that
[25:34] come through there are many things that
[25:35] this man may not be able to control in
[25:38] life things that happen to him things
[25:40] that other people did but he has control
[25:43] of what he thinks about and meditates on
[25:46] can you say amen and there can be a good
[25:49] fruit that comes from someone who
[25:51] replaces their thoughts with the word of
[25:54] God and with positive things this is
[25:57] significant in your life you have to
[26:00] know that your thought life every day is
[26:03] your domain to take under the control of
[26:06] the Holy Spirit and Satan does never
[26:09] ever belong there at all if you give him
[26:12] that territory he will take it but he
[26:14] needs to be scanned and checked at
[26:16] security every thought needs to be
[26:18] checked
[26:20] and I'm not talking about the person
[26:22] next to you I'm talking about you
[26:28] some of you are defeated in your life
[26:30] because you haven't learned the one
[26:32] principle that what you think about
[26:33] every day is really going to influence
[26:36] who you are and your actions
[26:41] and that can be worldly thoughts that
[26:43] can be dirty thoughts or that can be
[26:45] depressing thoughts or that can be lies
[26:47] of the enemy or that can be things that
[26:48] are contrary to the word of God it can
[26:50] be anything but if it's not of God
[26:53] then we don't have to think about it
[26:57] let this mind be in you which is also in
[26:59] Christ Jesus Paul said forgetting those
[27:02] things which are behind
[27:04] it's not any more complicated than that
[27:06] the word gives you permission to forget
[27:09] those things are behind if it's under
[27:11] the blood which I believe with Believers
[27:13] it's under the blood I have confessed it
[27:16] it's done and Paul says forget all of it
[27:19] behind I give you permission a Believer
[27:21] can forget because God's forgiven and
[27:24] for God he can't remember it no more so
[27:27] you don't have to remember
[27:29] God has a sea of forgiveness you should
[27:32] have a sea of forgetfulness that you
[27:34] don't have to revisit a thought that's
[27:36] underneath the blood of Jesus Christ
[27:38] because we're not called to defeat
[27:41] my brother and sister we are not called
[27:43] to live in everyday life from defeat we
[27:46] are called to live in Victory

[27:53] victory over the enemy every day
