[Music] say [Music] for [Music] Hallelujah [Music] hallu hallu H H glor hallelu Hallelujah I [Applause] know [Music] Hallelujah so Psalms chap 1 and verse one blessed is the man blessed means that he's favored of God he's happy he's uh he's a blessed man of God blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sth in the seat of the scornful now we could say that he's not a blessed man if he chooses to walk in the counsil of the ungodly if he chooses to stand in the way of Sinners nor s if he chooses to sit in the seat of the scornful then we could say he's not really a blessed man he may be blessed financially or other ways but in God's eyes he's not blessed because he chooses to position himself to these influences so but the man who chooses and the woman that chooses to be away from these influences and under the influence of God then he's a blessed man goes on to say but his Delight is in the law of the Lord his Delight his passion is in the word of God and in his law doth he meditate day and night day and night and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper now friends that's a pretty powerful set of scriptures here I believe it's a a blessing to see whatever he doeth shall prosper Happy New Year to everybody we're uh just thankful for the grace of God this last year to be able to enjoy his presence to see the things that he's done and the many hurdles that we've come through many of you we're just grateful to serve the Lord in this capacity to be a blessing to you and may God bless you and your families may it be the best year ever amen now I I just believe that these three scriptures three verses here this morning in it we find a greater Revelation than what we realize Li and in these scriptures that we read I believe that there's a great revelation of the place that a Christian uh can live every day to be an overcomer how many want to be an overcomer that's what we're called to be in leoa we're called to be over every age had Overcomers and we're called to be an overcomer not just a Survivor but an overcomer in this leoan age and so I believe we have some keys in Revelations here that gives us the keys to Christian lives living every day being an overcomer to be uh insulated from the world uh to be isolated from the influences uh that come in our minds and I want to elaborate on that in our thought life and there some different things here this morning because we can be insulated by the Holy Ghost we can be isolated from the influences of the mind and letting them Lodge within our thinking and our thought life and uh so we are we in the scripture here are typed as a tree and if you know your Bible you know that that trees are a type of a man and trees are a type of Christ because in the beginning in the Genesis we find that God talks about the trees that's in the garden but we know that not not all those trees were literal trees some of them were literal trees and some of them represented trees which trees represent man but also trees represented Christ and in the garden we have the Tree of Life in the garden we have the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and actually incidentally those trees end up being symbolic that the Tree of Life In The Garden was a person the tree of knowledge and good and evil was a person so you can't look at it just through a carnal eyes when you look at the Book of Genesis but we find in the beginning God is speaking about trees in the garden and they were not all literal trees and then if you move to the middle of the Bible we see that the tree of life was a person that we eat of in the middle of the Bible Jesus was saying I am the bread of the life I am the way of life I am the Tree of Life in John 15 he refers to himself as the vine and you are the branches so so Jesus is saying you are connected to this tree of life you are the branches to this tree of life I'm the vine you are the branches and and he and we're engra not engrafted but we're part of this tree so my theme is that the reason that he speaks about in Psalms 1 is the tree a a man is like a tree planted by the rivers of Living Water because men type trees and and we can even bear the fruit of something of the world or we can be connected to the tree of life and your life becomes a tree of life your life bears fruit of Christ can you say Amen so now to summarize just this Foundation that I lay laying here this is a Believer who's been planted in the right place beside the flowing river and Waters of God this is a believer I'm summarizing now what I'm going to preach the rest of the time uh and then so but don't just hear the summary and then uh turn off the computer don't do that uh you should hear the rest of it but I'm summarizing that these three scriptures say that this is a Believer who's been planted in the right place beside the flowing Waters of God his life is planted in the right place his roots are going in the right place in the right position he has shut off all wrong influences he has one main passion in his life and that's the word of God and he is prospering both naturally and spiritually because it says whatsoever this man does is going to prosper praise God I don't want the world's Prosperity I I don't want the success of the world remember he said to Joshua if you'll follow these things Joshua 1 he said said Thou shalt have good success not just success but you'll have good success I want to ask you do you want the success of the world do you want the money of the world do you want the what they call success or do you want good success and good success is when you and your family are following the word of God obedient to the word of God serving him with God in in the passion for the word and then you'll have not just success but good success not just Prosperity but good prosperity God's prosper erity God's blessing in your life hallelujah praise be to God so this is a Believer that's been planted in the right place has shut off all wrong influences has one made passion the word and is Pros prospering both naturally and spiritually and we're talking about your spiritual life your tree I asked you today where is your tree planted what influence are you under right now what influence is your mind under what influence is your thought like life under uh where are you planted and what influence are you under you know uh planting and caring for plants and trees is actually an art and some people are actually gifted with it but then some people can learn I just bought my daughter uh some plant books my daughter amariah for Christmas I bought her cuz she's interested in learning more about planting and things she's really good at it good at it already she's really good at flowers and such but she wants to learn more because it's an actual art uh this guy I have no green thumb my thumbs are not green at all I do not do good at planning and matter of fact my wife gets on me because I'm usually with the Roundup around trying to get the weeds around things and a few times I've sprayed some really good plants and that doesn't go over well with the wife so you know I just attack the weeds but if I get into the planting thing that thing is not going to thrive under me I'm just not gifted at it but we know the simple fact that a tree and a and a plant we know I know this is simple today but I pray that you'll apply it to your lives a tree or a plant cannot Thrive if it's planted in the wrong atmosphere your life is a tree and where you're planted every day spiritually will determine your thriving as a as a tree of the Lord it has everything to do with it you can't say no that has nothing to do with it and what I feed on has nothing to do with it then you're denying what nature says unless a tree is planted in the right place it will not Thrive you're Divine denying all of Nature and you're saying that my life doesn't apply to that no he he typed your life in Psalms 1 as a tree and a man or a woman's life has to be planted close to the rivers of water for moisture can you say that for the right atmosphere can you say amen and if it's not there it's not going to be a thriving tree the wrong atmosphere and if it's there if it's planted in the wrong place it will not reach its full potential you have been you have to be planted in the right place to thrive even the church that you attend can make you grow and thrive in this word or shrivel up and die even the local church that you attend can either make you grow in the word in faith in the word in your position in the word or you can sit there and dry up and shrivel and die you better pray about what you need in your life I think when you're planted by the rivers of Living Water when your life is planted in the right place and you stay there and you're a away from the influences you set yourself as a candidate to receive all that God has for you and if you're lacking the Holy Ghost there's things you can do to obey him and stay close to him he's going to give you it's God's not standing back saying oh I just hold it back from him I'll hold the Holy Ghost back I keep God's not playing games like that God's not God's looking for a hunger in your heart and and Jesus refers to it he says a father when he sees his child needs something would he not give that to his child when they have a need and he said so much more is the father wanting to give the Holy Ghost to his children God's not trying to hold it back from you you set yourself in the right atmosphere and you show your hunger to God say God I need more of you he'll finish to work in you amen he'll seal you by the Holy Ghost you got to have a revelation to know go how much God loves you and then that love reaches back to him and that love governs every situation in life I'll read it later perfect Faith Masters every circumstance that's why we need to live in perfect Faith but where does it come where does it start a perfect love a genuine love knowing that God loves us knowing that he's called us knowing that he has whatever we need and and this governs and and that God loves you you love God you love one another and that brings Faith a revelation of the love of God loving him back is the creator of this perfect faith in our lives it's rooted in the love of God not in works not in just wearing the right thing not in doing perfect things no we need a perfect faith and that doesn't NE necessarily mean doing uh perfect things it's a life that loves him and others more than anything then in Psalms 92:12 he said the righteous shall flourish like the palm tree he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God I don't know if they have that scripture but Psalms 92:12 the righteous shall flourish like a palm tree he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God they shall shall still bring forth fruit in old age they shall be fat and flourishing this goes right with Psalms 1 it's those that are planted you have to be planted in the right place you have to know your position Heavenly places in Christ so many scriptures point to this position being in the right place being planted in the right place that's what perfect Faith that's the perfect faith that we're called to you can have your faith built up temporary by testimonies a preacher can get testimonies and build Faith you can have your faith built up temporary by testimony or by hearing the word faith coming by hearing the word all those things are wonderful but I'm talking about staying in your position and not having a temporary Faith but a perfect faith that is stable that is planted when you use the word planted that means it's planted the roots are down it's there it's not rooting it up and moving constantly you can't spiritually do that and Thrive well I'm kind of tired of this so I'm just going to do this for a few years and you root yourself up and no the the the the plant has to be in one place and stay in that place this is the faith that I'm talking about knowing your position being planted in your position staying there not up and down but planted perfect faith and it's related to your position I hope this is a blessing to you I hope it's an encouragement I hope it builds your faith I hope you set you in a path to come to a life of perfect Faith why do you want to live another year in fear why do you want to live another year just not knowing who you are why do you want to continue to live on the fence about things why don't you be all in Lock Stock and Barrel want say God plant my life my tree plant my spiritual life right besides the rivers of water and Lord let me shut out the things of the world and let me live there this year every day amen what a what a goal what a New Year's revelation I'm just going to quickly make this simple as possible why is this man in Psalms 1 blessed prospering thriving why is he thriving why is he prospering it's where he's positioned himself first thing in his mind he is not open to just any influence number one when you take the counsel of the ungodly you think this doesn't fit with social media and all the access we have to all the wisen of the world and all the thoughts that come across your mind every day and across your phone and this applies the council the example of the ungodly is set before us all the time advice everybody wants to give their advice and everybody's an expert everybody has the final word fouchy Biden Trump the CD see act as if they have the final word and people get on with their opinions and they act as if they have the final word on it your opinion is not the final word my opinion is not the final word on it and so this whole thing of the counsel of the ungodly a Believer says now wait a minute did you give a deaf ear to the other voices and this believer in Psalms 1 gives a deaf ear to the advice and counsel of any one that's ungodly I'm getting practical now why are you given a place at the table to weigh in in your life from the counsil of the ungodly they have no example in their life they're not growing in the lord they're going backwards and you're giving a place at your table and in your thought life to the counsil of the ungodly he is not following their advice he's not following their example he's not get living on Google uh to Google information for the decision he makes I don't make my decisions just based upon a Google search if this is some of your influence you will never grow to more faith this blessed believer is not influenced by those things he doesn't walk in the path of Sinners to be in the path is just to be around them doesn't stand in the path of sin says he's standing he's around them he's watching what they're doing he's standing in the path he's not necessarily following them but he's just standing in the path watching what they're doing the path of Sinners is that where your life is but you're really just standing the path of Sinners on the internet and every else you're just standing there watching what do they do what fun are they having you're standing in the path of Sinners you may not be going down the path but you're standing there watching what they're doing not necessarily following but just standing watching what they do all day it's feeding on what they're doing I wonder what they're doing I wonder what's why but it's so much fun watching them do it just standing them watching them on their path which incidentally leads to a path to hell you don't want to watch people that are on path to Hell nor in the seat of the scornful you know what I cannot take two minutes and talk about the seat of the scornful the mockers the scoffers the complainers the critical moping all the time finding what's wrong finding what's negative you associate yourself with people like that all the time you're not going to be positive about your walk with the Lord we need to talk about people that stand in the way of Sinners we need to talk about people that dwell in the Council of the ungodly and now you're sitting in the seat and this is you were standing in the way of Sinners but now you're sitting in the seat of the scornful I want to elaborate on that of being around negative people and being around backsliders and being around people that are constantly negative that's not going to help you my brother that's not going to help your life they might even be in this church but it's not going to help you to stay around them if you can say an encouraging word and try to pull them out of it but most of the time you can't pull them out of it because they're just negative but you're not going to be in good shape if you hang around just those people all the time amen you're not going to be positive you're not going to have faith you're not going to be confident in what God is doing you're not going to be Kingdom living in the kingdom when you're around the seat of the scornful and they just sit and criticize and they're they're constantly uh looking at things all the time from that perspective those people are not going to do you any good you're not going to prosper being around people like that may that be part of your New Year's resolution Revelation may that be part of your desire Lord let me distance myself from influences that's plaguing my mind making me negative let me sit myself plant myself in the right place let me jump ahead and say this blessed and happy and favored man or woman of God have intentionally position themselves away from people like that away from influences like that they have have to in order to live in the kingdom and his passion his Delight is in the word of God above anything else it's exciting to him they can't wait to get to church they can't wait to hear the word from the church they can't wait to open their Bible they can't wait to read it it's not just reading it it's a passion for it this is this man in Psalms 1 can you say amen and he doesn't let things get lodged in his mind it says he's not only not only does he have a passion for the law of God and the word of God but in that law he meditates day and night this is what he allows himself to think about all the time this is what he meditates about so I don't have a choice in some things I don't have control over some things but I want to tell everybody here I and you have control over our thought life yes see the devil's convince you you don't oh the devil's just bringing all these thoughts no you have control over it you can replace good thoughts with wrong thoughts and you have to distinguish between what's imagination what's Satan's thoughts coming to you and quickly dismiss them not giving them a place at the table and say I'm going to replace it with perfect Thoughts with good thoughts with wholesome thoughts think on these things and so I'm meditating on the word meditating what I heard Sunday I'm meditating on what I heard Wednesday night I read this yesterday in the Bible just meditating on that this is the guy this is the brother this the believer who's prospering this a Believer who's spiritually in a Revival cuz he's not influenced by everything around him he switches out his thoughts back to the word he's thinking his thinking is directed his thought life is directed There are many things we don't have control over but he has control over what this man has control over what he thinks about you believe God has something for you this year you believe God has something deeper for you this this message is not just for a select few it's if you'll take a hold of it it's it's for you it's for you to live in Revival it's for you to live in perfect faith we have a kingdom we're called to live in that Kingdom we're called to keep our thoughts on that Kingdom Psalm blessed is the man that Seth not in the seat of the scornful standeth in the way of Sinners but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in the law doth he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree that's planted by the river of water and his leaves shall not wither whatsoever he doeth it shall prosper I say blessed be the name of the Lord that's my promise today if that's where I can live under this message that God has sent then I I want to live there I want to live in that world to myself and not be as affected by the voices and the the negative the things that's around me I want to live in that inner world with the Lord I want to live that perfect faith I don't want to keep losing sleep over things that really shouldn't have that much value to me I want to pray about things instead of worry about things I want to take it to the throne of God
