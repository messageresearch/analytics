[0:15] There's torn up pages in this book.
[0:19] Words that I'm good
[0:26] for so long.
[0:30] But the hands of grace and endless love
[0:34] dusted off and picked me up. Told my
[0:38] heart that hope is never gone.
[0:43] God is in this story.
[0:46] God is in the details.
[0:50] Even in the broken parts, he holds my
[0:54] heart. He never fills. When I'm at my
[0:59] weakest,
[1:01] I will trust in Jesus.
[1:05] Always in the highs and lows. The one
[1:08] who goes before me.
[1:12] God is in this story.
[1:20] So if the storm you're walking through
[1:24] feels like it's too much and you wonder
[1:28] if he even cares at all.
[1:34] Well hold on tight to what you know.
[1:38] He's promised he won't let you go. A
[1:42] song of feelings written in his scars.
[1:47] God is in this story.
[1:51] God is in the details.
[1:55] Even in the broken parts, he holds my
[1:59] heart. He never fails. When I'm at my
[2:03] weakest,
[2:06] I will trust in Jesus.
[2:09] Always in the highest low, the one who
[2:13] rose before me. God is in this story.
[2:21] And if it
[2:23] like addiction, if it like disease, he's
[2:29] the one who frees the prisoner. He's the
[2:32] healer of all things. And if it like
[2:38] depression, if it is broken home, he's
[2:43] the one who holds your sorrow. He won't
[2:47] leave you here alone.
[2:53] &gt;&gt; God is in this story.
[2:56] God is in the details.
[3:00] Even in the broken parts, he holds my
[3:04] heart. He never fails. When I'm
[3:09] kissed, I will trust in Jesus.
[3:14] Always in the high and lows. The one who
[3:19] goes before me.
[3:22] God is in this story.
[3:26] Oh,
[3:29] God is in my story.
[3:32] &gt;&gt; He's in this story.
[3:36] &gt;&gt; God is in this story. God is in this
[3:42] story.
[3:44] God is in your story. It's my dream
[3:49] story.
[3:51] [Music]
[3:53] Hallelujah.
[3:56] Glory.
[3:59] Praise God.
