TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Hello everyone. Pastor Paula Fontaine and Literal Life Church in Petersburg, Michigan would like to invite you to take the next half hour and enjoy some time in the word of God. If you're hungry for more God, we believe you can be fed. And we pray that you'll be blessed. Visit our website for more information at literalife.urch. May God bless you, my friend. May the music and message encourage you today. [Music] coming clean. All the secrets he had kept from her so long are finally known. Her big mistake. It's that one regret that haunts her to this day. It just won't fade. So many different stories we thought could not be redeemed. But it's against our darkest failures. We start to see the beauty of the blood, the goodness of his grace, the mercy undeserved that could never be explained. Heaven's best takes all our scars for the worst in all of us. That's the glory of the cross, the wonder of his love. That's the beauty of the blood. [Music] What a thought. Just a single drop forever wipes away our every stain. And with its power, every chain that has us found lies at our feet and we stand free. That's the beauty of the blood, the goodness of his grace, the mercy undeserved that could never be explained. Heaven's rest takes all our scars for the worst in all of us. That's the glory of the cross. The wonder of his love. That's the beauty of the blood. [Music] When you get news from the doctor that you hoped you'd never hear. and fear sets in. But then the word like a standard it cries out, "Do not fear for you are healed." That's the beauty of the blood. The goodness of this grace, the mercy undeserved that could never be explained. Heaven's best has paid the price for our healing by his stripes. That's the glory of the cross. The wonder of his love. That's the glory of the cross. The wonder of his love. [Music] That's the beauty of the blood. [Music] The beauty of the blood. [Music] I'm reading from Psalms 27 this morning from the word of God together. If you have your Bibles, the Lord is my light and my salvation. Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life. Is he the strength of your life? If he's the strength of your life, whom shall I be afraid? When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell. Though a host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear. Though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident. One thing I have desired of the Lord that I will seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life. He said, "This is the one thing I desire in my life, and that is I'd seek after this, and that's to dwell in the presence of the Lord every day of my life." Can you say amen? And so, and to behold the beauty of the Lord, to inquire in his temple. For in the time of trouble, he shall hide me in his pavilion. In the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me. He shall set me up upon a rock. And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies. Round about me. Therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy. I will sing. Yay, I will sing praises unto the Lord. I want to speak a little bit out of Psalms 27, and I want to title this, hide me in this time of trouble. Hide me in this time of trouble. David is the only one that used this term four or five times in his writings uh besides Job. And uh he just says those words, hide me. And uh he asked God, God, hide me. Hide me. And I'm only one of the reasons I'm preaching this is because that's why that's the way I have felt lately and that is Lord just hide me. Just hide me. There's a certain protection. Can you say amen? And so he asked the Lord but I I was looking at it uh the last couple days and it seems a bit mysterious if you don't understand why David is saying hide me. It seems a bit mysterious because we know that David is a warrior. David was a fighter. David from his very young years as a teen was had faith in God and he wasn't afraid of anything. He proved himself to be unafraid of the enemy since he was a little boy. So if we were to use the context of him saying, "Lord, hide me. My enemies are encamped about me. Hide me." It doesn't seem like it's the right thing for David to say because he doesn't look like somebody that would hide from the enemy. He actually ran towards Goliath. Amen. He didn't have a problem of being afraid of the enemy. And he it just seems mysterious that he would say, "Lord, hide me from the enemy. They're encamped about me." And and and there's and there's there's I feel it moving in and approaching him to me. Kind of like we feel in the time we live in. And so he but you see, we we we don't have the impression from David's life that he was one that would be one that would run from the enemy or to hide. and and yet he's asking the Lord, "Hide me, Lord. Hide me." Yet, it is not running away or it's not being scared. In other words, he's not saying, "Hide me." Because he's afraid because he said at the beginning, "To whom shall I fear? I don't fear anything." He says, "The Lord is my strength. Of whom shall I be afraid?" He's not saying hide me because he's afraid. He's not saying it because he's wanting to run from the enemy. That's not David. And yet it is not a running away or a scared. He he says he is not afraid. Uh to whom shall I fear? I'm not afraid. He said in this will I be confident. There's full confidence here. There's no fear here. But yet we must realize that fear is around him. Fear is surrounding him. Can you say amen? Uh uh uh the the there's there's the enemy surrounding him. My foes that were coming to eat my flesh. He's being completely surrounded by the enemy. And so he's saying, "Hide me." Not because he's afraid, but because if he don't live in that secret place, then he's vulnerable to become influenced by this fear. That's right. Praise the Lord. So, uh, he says, "I'm confident." But he says this, "Hide me." That he says, "Let me live in a place that's protected and a place that's higher." another place that opens up to me that would be higher than the enemy. Now, in Psalm 64:2, the way he says it in hide me, he says it this way. He says, "Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked." from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity. So, now we get a little bit more window into what he's saying, hide me from, and that is the the secret counsel of the wicked, from the insurrection of workers of iniquity. the secret counsel of the wicked. In other words, hide me. Don't let me be affected by what's being said about me in private. Things are being said about from my enemy and that's the secret counsel and things are but so now this is something he said hide me from that. And I'm just just pondering this morning with you. Why would he say hide me from that? I'm going to bring this out if I can. Why is David saying, "Hide me from the secret council of the wicked." I wonder if this hide me is not so much is is is not so much protection from a regular war or arrows that are coming at him. Uh he wouldn't be afraid of that. But maybe what he will hear that is being said about him and what he would hear being said about him might affect him a little bit and that would influence him and may influence him out of this place of protection. Job is the only other man who said, "Hide me." And he says it this way, which is to me a mystery behind it. Job 14:13 says, "Oh, that thou wouldest hide me in the grave." Oh, that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret until thy wrath be passed, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time and remember me. Now, I want to elaborate on this because uh all that Job went through, this is what he says. In all that he's gone through on earth, he said, "Hide me in the grave." In other words, there's a lot of pressure he went through, a lot of losses he had in this life, but he had a revelation of resurrection. How many know that Job had a revelation of resurrection? How many know that Job was not afraid of the grave? He's not afraid of the grave. He's not afraid of dying because he knows the grave is not the end for him. He's got a revelation that if I go there, it's not the end. It's actually just the beginning. And I will end this life someday. I will end the pressure here someday. And if I'm put in that grave to hide there, that's a good place for a Christian to hide because God's going to come and pull me out of that grave someday. Job thought it was a it was a it's it's a hideout. It's a place. Job never seen it as the end, but a hideout, a waiting room, a green room. Anybody know what? Everyone know what's a green room is? It's the green room. Green room before the big stage event. The green room is where all the artists go and they wait it out before they are invited to the big stage event and to perform. Praise the Lord. So until you're caught out on stage, you're, you know, and that's Job is in the green room waiting to be called for the big resurrection event. Praise the Lord, everybody. He wanted to be hiding until Jesus cried out. And there he was. All the Old Testament saints who died in the Lord, there they are hiding out in the grave. They're hiding in the grave. And everybody thought, "They're dead and they're gone." No, they're just in the green room waiting to be called on stage. And sure enough, when Jesus cried out with a loud voice, there was a power behind his voice of resurrection. And the Bible says they come out of the green room and they showed themselves in the city streets of Jerusalem. Their life wasn't over. The grave was the grave wasn't the end. They were just hiding out there in the time of trouble. There is a great intensity of the enemy be being encamped around the people of God in the time of trouble. There'll be a lot of trouble. We we we ask the Lord to hide us because we don't want to be caught in the trouble. It it's it's pride to say that I won't be caught in all this trouble. You have the vulnerability to be caught in the trouble around you. You have the the humanness, the human side, the fleshly side of you. If you feed on things enough, you will be caught in the web just like everybody else is caught in the web of pornography, of adultery, of family division. You'll be caught in that world because you're vulnerable to it. You'll be caught in it yourself. But God gives us an escape. God gives us a place out. And so in the time of trouble is when he's saying, "Would you please, Lord, hide me?" There's no need for us to hide unless there's danger all around. Can you say amen? Amen. Why is David saying, "Hide me, Lord. Hide me." Because there's danger all around it. If you don't realize there's danger all around you and that it could affect you, then you're not asking, "Lord, hide me. Hide me. Hide me in that rock. Put me on that rock." He's saying, "Lift me above my enemies. In the time of trouble, please hide me." He wouldn't be asking that unless there's danger all around the time of trouble. If you don't see there's danger around, then you don't see the value of that secret place. We need to be hidden away with Christ. The Bible says also that we live in perilous times, testing times. Can you say amen? Besides all the spirits and hell being unlooed around, unleashed around us, be besides the lustful spirits, the perverted spirits, all these things surrounding us. It's a time of trouble. But then the Bible says in the last days there'll be perilous times. That means testing time. We're vulnerable outside of his daily protection. There is a hedge from the spirit of this world. There's a protection from the spirit of this world is safety in Jesus Christ the word. Can you say amen? Do I need to be more specific? Demon power. Do I need to be more specific? If you don't think that you walk out of here and you're living in a dangerous time, then let me be more specific. Demon, demonic power from hell can be in music. Demonic power can be in movies. It can be in Tik Tok. It can be in books. It can be in social media. It can be on YouTube. If you're growing up as a Christian, right, that you you realize that that we're living in a spiritual battle of things that we can't see. And so something that you feed on too much, you could take a spirit so quickly and not even see that you took it. That's the danger that we live in. And and I can't I can't come with you every day and watch over you. And some of you kids growing up, your parents can't watch over you every waking minute. They they can't see all the time what's on your phone. And so danger, danger, danger. When you get older, danger, danger. Not because your parents is warning you or your preacher is getting red in the face warning you. It's danger not because I said it. It's danger because the demonic power that's against your life. It's a dangerous time. So, you're not going to take a loose attitude towards a dangerous time. I wish I'd have never given my kids a phone at whatever it was, 14, 15 years old. I wish I'd have set the age at like 30. Yeah, good luck with that. It could have been a great instrument for the kingdom of God. And in some ways today, it's it is being used that way. could have been a great the devil got a hold of it becomes the worst place for trash and demonic power to come across. You ever heard about a movie years ago and in in the 80s called Poltergeist? It's about demons. This all the way back in the 80s and the inspiration comes to some director and he pegs demons come into somebody's household. This is the story of the movie. demons come into the household and it comes because a little girl is sitting and the TV after midnight goes into this fuzzy static whatever and she's watching this during the night late when the kids have gone to bed and that all of a sudden through that brings demons into that home and they suffer in that home with demonic power for months and months and months and they don't know what's going on but they started it came through the TV. Yeah, that's right. There's a movie saying this out there completely blatant about it. So here it is. And so now they go through months and find they can't get them out. They can't do they're haunting them every night. This is and I'm I'm not encouraging you at all to watch it for sure because it'll bring demonic power in your home. But you see now it's it's real. It's real. But it started with that. And so now it gets to the end of it and you know they had to almost destroy that entire house. They had to move. They could not get them out. Had no power of God to do it. So they couldn't they had to move. I think they even, if I remember right, they destroyed the entire house and everything, went to a motel with their family. And the last, I didn't expect to say this today, but this is this is good. The last scene of the movie is dad takes the TV in the motel and rolls it out to the sidewalk and shuts the door of the motel. And that's the last scene cuz daddy realized that's how it all got started. Now, it's hard to preach these things today because it's not popular cuz I know there's a lot of integrated stuff. My family and I every once in a while we if we have a a a nice evening, which is very rare, we have time to do it, but we'll watch a decent thing. This new chosen series, all these, we like something decent. I let the kids watch Vegetels when they're young. It's not that we didn't have a video and a monitor and a a a TV in our home because of that, but it was very restricted what came through that screen. And a lot of was because I read things like that years ago. This is real. Don't be vulnerable. This is a dangerous time to live in. And that's why David said this is dangerous. The enemy is not out there. He's encamped right up to my door. And so what am I saying? Hide me. Hide me, Lord. Amen. Amen. Let me become so hidden in Christ that the devil doesn't know where to find me. Is this okay with everybody today? Hide me, Lord. Hide me because of the danger that's around me. So, he's honest and saying, "If you don't hide me, I'll be affected by what's around me." I'll be affected by what people say about me. Amen. Praise the Lord. Demonic power can be in those things. The last days men shall here we go. In the last days, testing time because men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, truth breakers, false accusers. This is all the last days stuff. truth breakers, promise breakers, false accusers, despisers of those that are good, incontinent, unholy, and with all that, hello, having a form of godliness. Christians, Christians that don't have the Holy Ghost and all these manifestations of the last days are all there. That's a dangerous time. That's the last days as well. in the last days, they'll mock the promise of God. They'll mock it on the internet. They'll mock it. They'll mock this message. It's it's a mocking time. It's things being said against it to to to try to produce fa lack of faith in your life. So, h having said all that, uh you know, plus it's a form of godness. And I don't want to forget always what he says at the end of all that. From such, turn away. Well, that sentence has more power in it than all the rest. from such all that turn away. No, I think I'll hang around that guy at work because I want to witness to him and I want to hang around him a bit, try to save him. I'll go with him to the bar because I I just need to hang around him and do some missionary work. Bible said from such turn away. And if they're hungry for if you're living the life of Christ filled with the spirit. If they're hungry, they're going to thirst for that. They're going to start asking you questions. I I'm going to I'm going to witness to them. I'm going to do and time after time, I'm going to go help this person because they're they're having they're going through this time. And they go help them and that spirit turns them around because they're not strong. They don't have the solid Christ in their life yet. So, they think they can handle it, but they're vulnerable. They're in a dangerous spot. Dangerous ground. Run into a safe place. That's what David said. I want to run. The name of the Lord is a strong tower. Wherein the righteous run into it and are safe. So, this is what I'm preaching to you today. The devil, it's not good enough for him just to accuse and just to come against you and just No, he actually wants to pull you from your atmosphere in your secret place into the same atmosphere as him. The devil complicates this message so much. He complicates everything. This message is not meant to be complicated. And don't forget he said in the scripture he says God is not the author of confusion. So it's easy to say if there's confusion and doubt and fear and complicated Satan is trying to anoint you with the spirit. No, it's the simplicity God in simplicity. And if someone's trying to shake you out of that simple life, then you just just stand and say, "Lord, hide me. Hide me. Let them say what they want to say. Hide me in your pavilion. How many you want to be hidden today? Hide me, Lord, so I'm not affected by this. And if you get in in the boat and Jonah gets in your boat, if you got a Jonah in your boat, you know what they did with them? Get off of my boat. I mean, I know it's a simple little lesson, but and you probably learned it in Sunday school, but like if you have a Jonah that's running from the presence of the Lord and rebellious and running from the things that's being preached and doing the opposite, then get off of my boat. Amen. God's going to deal with you, but don't stay in my boat because if you stay on my boat, my boat might start sinking and I don't want my boat to sink. Get off of my boat, Jonah. So in Psalms 27 I would say this that it's not so much hiding even though he uses that word but when the other words are there when it says he li he shall lift my head above he shall set me up upon a rock and he shall lift my head above my enemies it's not so much about hiding in this but it's but it's lifting us above it all that we can live above it all set me on a rock above my enemies praising the Lord because it says here he sets me up my head above the enemies. How many would say I want to live above my enemies. It's another atmosphere. It's something else. I want to live above it. And therefore will I offer in this tabernacle sac sacrifices of joy and I will sing. Yay. I will sing praises unto the Lord. So David is so confident here. He says, "When you lift me up above my enemies, you put me in a place, set me on a rock and you lift me up above my enemies that I can at least be above them and and then what I'm doing up there is I'm praising. I will offer the sacrifices of joy. I'm not going to be shy to praise the Lord." You know, isn't it wouldn't it be annoying as you know, David sat on the rock and he's just praising the Lord and all his enemies are down there and he's not even looking at them. Glory be to God. Praise be to God. And you start singing like, I will not come down to the devil's level. He set me up on a rock. Can you say amen? I'll pray for you, my brother, but guess what? I'm not coming down to where you're at. I don't want your fear. I don't want your doubts. I don't want your nervousness. I want to live in this secret place above my enemies. And you can imagine if this spirit is true that it's always trying to drag you down. They're not happy that you're up there, but they're saying, "Hey, get down here. I got something to talk about with you. Get down. What do you get down here? Why can't they come up with you?" They might not be called to it, but if they are, they don't want to come up there. You need to hear my case. You need to hear my disgruntliness. You need to hear this. Get down here. Get step off of that chair and get out of that place. and we're saying, "No, I want to live there. One thing have I desired." Can you imagine a believer saying, "Out of all the things that we could ask for, there's really today only one thing I want above money, possessions, retirements. I know I can say this in my heart. above a better job, above more money, above retirements, above all the things. One thing is what I really want and I'm going to seek after it. I want to dwell in the house of the Lord every day of my life. I want to stay there. I'm going to stay up on that chair. Can you say amen? I will not get down here. Get down here. No. No. I will not come down to the devil's level. I will not come down to Satan's ground. Satan's ground. Oh, when the devil comes around, I'm going to move right up to higher ground.
