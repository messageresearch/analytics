And I was going to play the piano and I got a call this morning on my way here and got some really sad news from back home. And there's a little family with broken hearts this morning. And as I was listening, I I wasn't even singing this morning. I was just listening to all your beautiful voices in this atmosphere. And I was just praying for them in my heart that God would just go and just pour out his love, his grace, and his mercy upon this little family. We're part of that family. And I just uh this song just came to my heart. I've been singing it for the last few months. Really, just never sung it before. You might say that's crazy to do in in front of all these people that you've half of them you don't know. But you know what? We're a family, right? We're the family of God. And so when God lays something on your heart, sometimes you might say, "Man, that's crazy." Listen, folks, the spirit is unscripted. And he moves when he wants to move. And so I just pray that you just worship with me. And when we're singing this together, if you know it, just pray for this family this morning, will you? Amen. When I walk through deep waters, I know you will be with me. And when I'm standing, oh, in the fire, yeah, I will not be overcome. through the valley of the shadow. Oh, I will not fear. I am not alone. Hallelujah. Oh, I am not alone. You will go before me. You will never leave me. I am not alone. I am not alone. You will go before me. You will never leave me in the midst of deep sorrow. Oh, I see your light is breaking through. Oh, the dark of night. Oh, it will not overtake me. Oh, I am pressing into you.

And if you just stand with me, I while you turn into Psalms chapter 149, just make a few announcements. What a blessed I could talk quite a bit about. And brother Wes in the specials this morning, you ministered to us, Sister Gloria, I think it was, Brother Wes. Thank you so much. Uh, Brother Wes is brother Ed Biscll's grandson. So, you can see that anointing coming right down. Praise the Lord. We appreciate him being here from Georgia and all all of the visitors. God bless you each one. You've really uh refreshed all of us by coming in and I hope we can refresh you in the Lord. What a time last night. &gt;&gt; What a time last night. I'll tell you uh it was just above and beyond. And we pray we appreciate brother Lee Paul Luca the director from the MB choir. Many of the choir members here and other family members joining in. Thank you, brother Lee Paul, for your direction and also brother Kenny Slacka, our choir director and music director. And I trust me, there's so many logistics that go into planning something like this for the weekend. It's been planning since probably January with brother Lee Paul and all the logistics in the church. And I don't have time to mention all the helpers, but we give a big thank you to all of the AV people and all the people who put this on. God bless you each one. God rewards you. God rewards you for that. And I know he will. We had about 5 to 600 there last night, but we had over 5,000 streaming the concert last night around the world. I got texts from the UK, from Nigeria, uh, all over the place saying how much they were blessed last night. So, we're not only worshiping with 500, we were worshiping around the world with saints. And it's such a tremendous blessing. We thank you. Uh my uh I wouldn't mention this with so many visitors here. I hate to mention my daughter and son-in-law, but they're visiting from Washington. Uh Gabby and Tyler are visiting. I don't even know if they have a seat in the building. They might be in the back section, but we welcome them this morning. And before you clap, before you clap, I have an announcement to make. There's a baby coming in February. [Applause] Amen. Y'all pray for me. I'm announcing new grandbabies almost every Sunday here. I'm I announced one last Sunday. So, y'all pray for me. My goodness. I love him to death, but I didn't expect to get this many so quick. Pray for me. The Lord blesses my uh bank account, too. I'm going to need it for sure. Praise the Lord. This week, we lost a dear friend and brother, Evangelist, Bruce Jacowski. Surprise. He was 70 years old. He he um his heart just quit. He died. And so we were talking to Sister Donna. She's very broken about it. Brother Bruce helped us in the initial days of this church um starting this church and him and his wife. And he has been a blessing. I just want to take a minute and honor him and we'll be sending you the the funeral arrangements and such. But brother Bruce, he was in our congregation in the beginning, but he's went from uh two or three churches and been such a huge assistant to pastors doing anything he needed to do. Uh whether it's play the trumpet or preach or lead songs, he's been such his life is a great testament to a life of service and we hate to lose him. And we remember sister Donna, she just weeping on the phone and and uh you know that you know all of you know who've lost someone some recent me uh members of the family, brother Bird family. It's you can pray for them deeper when you know you've lost somebody like that. So let's lift Donna Jacowski up and we just will give you those uh funeral arrangements. Uh also brother John Garrett, his wife would like to be announced on September 20th. Uh and we just rejoice with him. Brother uh John Garrett has come into retirement and graduation from 28 years of military service and a master's in applied behavior analysis. He's here this morning, Brother John right here. We thank you for your service and thank you for all that you've done. God bless you. and what a great accomplishment, but also a a minister of the gospel and ministering now with his time open overseas a little bit. So, may God bless you and your ministry and your family and and uh they're going to have we'll send this out to you as well. They're going to have an open house on September 20th. I wanted to show you um and just real quickly, there'll be an after gather for those who are staying in town. 5:00 here in the back, there'll be a meal. If you didn't register for it, um then you can't come. Uh, so because we just have the food for those who've registered, but we're gathering back here at 5 for those who registered, for those who want to fellowship and spend some time together, those who are in town, and there's I don't know how many's in the back now watching. God bless you all in the back uh the overflow there um for watching the service back there. We wish we could get you in the sanctuary. I want to show you a video if you guys have it up there. Just before I read our scripture, and we have to do this. I think it was on April 7th, we begin to pray for Sister Lorie Snow. And they gave her no hope to live. She would ne and if when did she begin to continue to live, they gave her no hope to walk again. I'm going to show you this uh video from just the other day of give Glory to God. They April 7th, they said she they had no hope to live. 0% chance to live. And if you live, she would never walk again. Go ahead and play this video to give Glory to God. Sister Lorie Snowise. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And she's not done yet. &gt;&gt; Couple weeks ago, I showed a video of she went seven sticks. I said, "You did seven steps for to perfection." She's not done. She's going by herself there and back and she's a woman of faith and she's she's confessing, I'm going to completely walk again and be back to normal. We give glory to almighty God. Hallelujah. God is good. You know, this isn't just something we sing about or worship about. This is a real almighty God that shows up when he's when there's a need. I believe that. But I want to read this morning from Psalms chapter 149. And we'll just be mindful of the time today knowing that many of us are tired and worn out from the uh rehearsals and all the things this week. But we do sense the Lord's presence with us this morning. And he's the one that makes it all worthwhile. How many can identify those who know the Lord know that he's present among us and he's greater and bigger than any man, any preacher, any singer. He's the main attraction here this morning. And when he is this close to us, boy, we ought to just give him all of our hearts and all of our worship. &gt;&gt; Psalms 149, praise ye the Lord. Sing unto the Lord a new song and his praise in the congregation of the saints. Let Israel rejoice in him that made him. Let the children of Zion be joyful in their king. Let them praise his name in the dance. Let them sing praises unto him with the timal and harp. For the Lord taketh pleasure in his people. &gt;&gt; He will beautify the meek with salvation. Let the saints be joyful in glory. Let them sing aloud upon their beds. This type of praise is not just when you're in church. &gt;&gt; This type of praise is not just when you're around the saints and showing off. This is even on the beds. It's at home. It's at work. &gt;&gt; This is a continual praise. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let the high praises of God be in their mouth and a two-edged sword in their hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To execute vengeance upon the heathen and punishments upon the people. To bind their kings with chains and their nobles with feathers of iron. To execute upon them the judgment written, "This honor have all his saints. Praise ye the Lord." Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise ye the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, bless your word today. I know last week, Lord, you impressed upon me this thought for this morning. I pray you'd anoint it and bless it to every heart in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; I'd like you to pay attention this morning to David's writings. And there's so many songs and so many truths in David's uh words in the Psalms. And David is particularly special to me. I identify with him very much in the scripture and his life. But David here at the very end of his writings, we find he speaks of the people of God. And he speaks of a people who God is drawing great pleasure from their worship. And I this this scripture drew my attention many years ago, but the Lord brought it back up again here today knowing this weekend we were giving so many efforts to offer our gifts and an offering to God. All the musicians and all the singers and so many gifts coming together. And we had a good devotion Friday night together and prayer of rededication all of us before we went into the concert because we wanted to realize that it's not about us. It's not about glorifying oursel. It's about glorifying him. It's offering a a a worship to God that's acceptable to him and then to bless the people of God. And so that's the purpose. There is no other purpose than that. And so when we look at this scripture, I wanted to just minister on it a little bit because a couple things in there with that we see is God is taking pleasure in this type of worship. And it's not just that he's taking pleasure in us, but we're taking pleasure in him. And when we start talking about that, we start talking about a a wonderful worship, a worship that comes to a high pinnacle. And that is when God is pleased with the worship and when the and he draws pleasure from the worship and that we draw pleasure in worshiping him. And so uh what what this is coming from is is I just want to present it this way is that this this praise has has reached actually a higher level. It's not just called praise upon their lips. It's called the high praises of God. I don't know if you ever noticed high praises. And this is the only place in the scripture where high high praises is mentioned. the only place in the scripture we always have praise and we have that word mentioned many places but this people at this time that David is pointing to that they they h they they have a distinction about them and I can't help but think that this is the bride of the last days because they are really the people that have the two-edged sword in their hand &gt;&gt; but I want to preach to you it's not just that that we have the two-edged sword in our hand but we have the high praises of God upon our lips. &gt;&gt; And this is a people that he's pointing to that it's the high praises and it's it's it's on their lips. And I I'm going to venture to say this is a prophecy of the people of the very end. After 6,000 years, there will be a people arise that will reach the apex of all things that God would be so pleased with their worship. And you remember, worship isn't just singing or lifting your hands or clapping. Worship is our life before God. Worship is our offering to God. Worship is who you are even when you're by yourself. &gt;&gt; And so just look at it that way this morning. It's more than just what we're doing this weekend. And it it comes from a life that is poured out before God, a sanctified life. And after 6,000 years, I believe this is speaking of the bride because we'll reach the apex of all things. God will restore his word. God will give that book of redemption back to his people again. Everything climaxes at the end time. But all of that is to produce a people that have come to the apex of what real worship is all about. &gt;&gt; And uh David brings it. It just seemed to strike the right thing in the heart of God and it moves the heart of God and it it it strikes the right thing with no elements missing. And I want you to hold on to that worship with no elements missing because in a moment I'll speak of uh times in the Bible when there was worship going on even to Jehovah God. But it had missing elements to it. And and God does not take pleasure when worship is missing elements to it. &gt;&gt; He's looking to a people and he's creating a people to come to true worship. How many remember what Jesus said to the woman at the well? And and and she was confused about worship and he prophesied. He said to this woman at the well, this harlot, he said, "The the hour is coming and now is that the true worshippers will come and worship in both spirit and in truth." He's talking about our day. In other words, they won't just have they don't won't just have the spirit and lacking truth. &gt;&gt; Nothing will be lacking. And they won't just have truth without the spirit. But when they come with the full truth and spirit, then they become the true worshippers of God. &gt;&gt; God brings this thing to a head. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So this is a people that's reached the highest form of worship, the highest level that you come to. And this is a people with the two-edged sword in their hand and the high praises of God upon their lips. They have the king's sword in the end time. And I want to say that the king's sword is not just books and tapes and Bibles. It's so much more than that. &gt;&gt; The king's sword, the word is so much more than books and tapes. &gt;&gt; It's so much more than just our Bibles. Because why? The sword is to be put in the hand. And when the sword struck, how many know that the sword struck the prophet's hand in Sabino Canyon? And he he said it was real and it struck him and it and and he was holding this sword and they the the angel corrected him and said, "This is not a king's sword." He said, "A king sword." No, this is the king's sword. There's only one king and he's the word of God. But I want you to notice now when we come to this, it strikes, it didn't strike the prophet's head. It struck his hand. It had to come into the hand of the prophet. And not just the prophet, but he's going to put that sword in the hand of his people. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It strikes his hand. It strike It doesn't strike his his head. This isn't an intellectual thing. &gt;&gt; It's something you're able to use. &gt;&gt; A sword on a mantle or on a wall does no good. books and tapes and Bibles on the shelf do no good. &gt;&gt; The word is not just me meant to be on the wall or or or the word is not meant to be just something on your phone, your Bible on your phone. It's meant to be so much more than that. Where does it belong? It belongs in the hand of the believer. &gt;&gt; And why is that? It's because the prophet said, "Even though the sword be the word, it takes the strong hand of faith to hold it there and bring it to the heart of the enemy." &gt;&gt; So, it's not meant to be in our heads. It's got to be in our hands. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many believe the word has come back to us &gt;&gt; and it's not just placed in the hand of the prophet? That's very symbolic. And as he said it was real, but it's very symbolic to see that it struck his hand because that's who it that's who David is saying. He said they have the two-edged sword in their hand. &gt;&gt; Not in their intellect, but they have it in their hand because they're going to take it to the heart of the enemy. Why did they tell me that it's good enough just to push play? just push play. And and I believe in push and play, but it's this word that we have is more I'm not going to get in a rapture just because I push play. &gt;&gt; And hope that don't offend anybody, but this word is not just something mechanical. This word is not just to get in our heads. This word is not something that we can just push play and we'll be in the bride and we'll make a rapture. I want to remind everybody that sword was placed in the hand of the prophet. &gt;&gt; It's meant to be in the hand. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I might have just lost a few of you there. &gt;&gt; This sword is placed into the hand of the people. And I believe this bride holding it, she knows by character it's not meant to use on one another. Amen. &gt;&gt; At least she should know that &gt;&gt; it's meant to use on the devil. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And this bride is going to take it and she's going to go for the juggler. There's some young girl that's going to pierce through the spirit of immodesty of this generation and she's going to take that sword in her hand and she's going to cut through that spirit of immodesty. There's some young men that are probably sitting here that's going to take that word and it's not just books and tapes to them. They're going to put it in their hand and they're going to drive it and cut that demon of pornography. Cut that demon of lust. &gt;&gt; A people will have it in their hand and take it to the root of bitterness in their life. &gt;&gt; Can I get an amen? &gt;&gt; People are going to when they have it in their hand, he says they take it to the heart of their many enemy. They're going to take it to the core of something and take it to a root of bitterness in your life and cut that out &gt;&gt; using the word that he has sent to do that. Hey, maybe they're going to take it and drive it to the heart of pride in your life and cut that pride out of your life. I as I go along I may have less amens and I'm prepared for that. &gt;&gt; This is not just books and tapes and Bibles. It was in the hands of the people. And I believe in the end time it's going to be more than our heads. It's going to be in our hand and we're going to take it to the heart of the enemy. Maybe it'll cut the pride out. The pride that says I'm better than everybody else. The pride that says this church is better than all the other churches. May God take the word and cut that out of our life. There is no perfect church. This isn't a perfect church and your church is not a perfect church. And if you've got that pride to lift up some church or some minister, may that word is for this to take in your hand and cut that pride out of your life. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Cut the pride out. Use that sword to cut Hollywood trash out of your life. &gt;&gt; To cut those clips out that you're flipping through that glorify sexual perversion. &gt;&gt; That's what this word was sent for. It's not just to play around with it and sing about in church. It's to take into your hand and cut those things out of your life. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need to know understand why the Lord has given us this word. So they have a sword in their hand, but they have high praises upon their mouth. So I don't want to leave that part out. This is the people of the end time. They have the sword in their hand, but they have the high praises in their mouth. They have been taught to bring their mouth under God. &gt;&gt; Causing them to say the right thing. &gt;&gt; The right thing is coming out of their mouths. &gt;&gt; Now, put your seatelt on cuz I'm going to be straight with you. &gt;&gt; And you're saying, "You haven't been straight already." This people will not only have the word in their hands and the word restored, but they will have the right thing upon their mouth. It's interesting that the third pole was related to that sword coming in his hand. And the third pole is also related to this spoken word coming forth from the bride's mouth saying the right thing because he said little had right when the third poll you remember it of all everything that woman said the right thing. You've got to say the right word, the right thing to God. So what's coming out of these mouths on a daily basis is tied to the power that comes in this bride. It's not just that we have the message. It's not just that you have the word, but what's coming out of our mouth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'd just like to add that when that happened and that sword struck brother Bram's hand, he had his hands before that sword struck him, he said he had his hands up to the Lord by himself, praying and worshiping God. And while he was praising and worshiping God, the sword struck his hand. And then he said when it was all over and that sword disappeared, he said, "I come down excited, shouting, screaming, praising God, coming down. I couldn't get wait to get to my wife. I was praising." He says, "I was jumping over rocks. Couldn't get back wait to get back to my wife to say, "Honey, this isn't the end of my life. I thought it was the end of my life. This great blast." No, this isn't the end of my life. This is my new ministry. This is the third pull. And I asked you because the third pole isn't just for brother Brandham. It's for the bride to come into. &gt;&gt; And how was it brought to the prophet? A sword in the hand and the right thing upon the mouth. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; So at the end time, there's an apex of the people. There's a there's a a a high level of worship. A sword in the hand and the right thing in the mouth. the third pole tied to the sword in the hand and the spoken word upon our lips. And when his people come to this, if you notice my text after let the verse six, let the high praises of God be in their mouth and a two-edged sword in their hand to execute vengeance upon the heathen. Verse eight, to bind the kings with their chains and nobles with their feathers. I just want to summarize that and say to you, when his people come into this type of worship and this type of praise, it starts to bind up kings and nobles, spiritual wickedness in high places is bound up. Now, that's the opposite of what spiritual wickedness in high places is meant to do from the beginning of all of it. It's meant to take the saints and bind them up. Bind up their worship, bind up their lives, bring them under chains. Can you say amen? But when the people of God come to this type of life and this type of worship, he's not binding us, but we're binding him up. We're binding up principalities and powers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I tell you, there's nothing God gets pleasure out of this type of worship. And there's nothing Satan can do to stop it. &gt;&gt; He can bind up the whole realm of Satan worship that starts not only irritating Satan but binding him up. &gt;&gt; I just stop for a minute and say if we have agreement here, how many want to be a worshipper at the last days that doesn't just irritate Satan but actually binds him up? &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." Can I be a worshipper at the end time? That my life and my praise and my lips. I don't have to do anything special. I just got to get the word and the right thing on this mouth. I got to take this sword to the enemy. And God just breathes it in with great pleasure. And he steps into your situation and binds the devil completely. We are not called in the last days to be bound by depression and bound by fears. You may be that way, but remember, you're not called to be that way. When you're in the right place as a worshipper, there is power there to bind up those devils. &gt;&gt; And none of it has to do with what you created. God created it. God restored the word. God gave the book back to his people. God be to speak to the prophet of this last days and says, "There's a people coming. There's a bride coming. My true worshippers, they're coming. We've reached the apex. We've reached the end." And what is God looking for? Just for us to be intellectuals and part of a movement? No. He's saying, "One day, the hour has come when true worshippers will worship me in spirit and truth." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And you don't think the devil's going to be on the run. &gt;&gt; On the run. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; When she finds that place. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's talk about worship that is missing elements to it throughout the Bible. And I have no have no time to go through every incident. I just want to say since the fall in the garden, we seen the effects of the fall, &gt;&gt; man. the the and created in the image of God. He fell. When the woman fell, they fell together. And there were so many effects of that fall. He lost his oneness. He lost everything. He lost his title deed to the earth. He lost his power. But one thing that we seen in the offspring is from the false union that union that took place with Eve and the serpent. One thing that we've seen that kind of surprises us from the offspring of the fall. And what we've seen come from the offspring is worship. &gt;&gt; Think about it now. And to me, I would never expect that from from sin and the fall and and and and and all of a sudden now everything's messed up and man's lost his place and and and now he's born with a serpent nature and he doesn't have a he doesn't have he has a soul but he has a serpent nature to automatically gravitate to the things of the world. And so he's all messed up in sin. And yet and yet Cain himself, &gt;&gt; it's worship. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, number one reason is he has a soul. And when man man has a soul, no matter how far they are from God, they'll have a craving for God to worship God. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; And Cain had that as well. &gt;&gt; But here's another reason why worship was there right away. It's because the one who caused all this fall, and I'm going to expose him this morning just a little bit. Lucifer anointed the serpent to cause this fall. And Lucifer knew very much about worship &gt;&gt; and matter of fact, he was probably more knowledgeable about what worship was around the throne of God &gt;&gt; than anybody on earth, any angel, anyone. Lucifer, chief angel, chief musician, &gt;&gt; right there at the right hand of God around all of the perfect worship of God. He was knowledgeable about worship. And so I'm wondering that's why now Cain, he anoints him. And now Cain, he's going to bring worship. &gt;&gt; You think, oh, he's a dastasterly fella just loves the things of the world. What's he want to worship for? He's to go out and just do all kinds of things in the world. No, no, it's worship. The third first thing he brings is worship. &gt;&gt; This is very hard for people to admit. It was worship. It was worship be but it was missing elements to it. &gt;&gt; Now we say, "Well, he's worshiping God." I mean, come on. He's worshiping Jehovah God. He's bringing an offering. He's doing it. So, our tendency would be, surely God is loving enough to accept that offering, &gt;&gt; to accept that worship. I'm here to be real clear now. We're reaching for the worship that God takes pleasure in. &gt;&gt; Not a lower form of worship, not a worship that's tainted, and not a worship that's missing elements. Well, what was Cain's worship missing? It was without revelation. &gt;&gt; It was worship without a cleansed soul, &gt;&gt; a redeemed soul. That's a pretty huge element missing in your worship. It was worship without the holiness of God. It was worship without relationship with God. It was worship without oneness with God. It was worship with no fellowship with God. And yet it was all worship. And Cain's worship was worship to Jehovah, but it brought what it wanted to bring to the Lord. It was worship without blood. &gt;&gt; Somebody ought to say, "Praise the Lord this morning." I'm speaking the truth to you. That worship that's missing essential elements. God is not pleasured in that. But there's a people coming with all the elements. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Nothing missing. &gt;&gt; Blood, revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A redeemed soul. &gt;&gt; Standing there with the book of redemption &gt;&gt; and their identity revealed to them. &gt;&gt; That's why Revelations 5, I read it last night. That's why they, as David says here, they'll sing a new song. It says that in Revelations 5 when the he takes the book they'll sing a new song. &gt;&gt; He hath made us kings and priests. That book of redemption revealed their true identity and it made them something. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Cain worship was worship to Jehovah, but it brought what it wanted to bring. It was without blood. It was without sacrifice. It was without atonement to purge sins. It had great fruits to it, but it offered no sacrificed life with it. God is not interested in cane worship even today. &gt;&gt; The music can be perfectly right, but God is not interested in cane worship. &gt;&gt; And I can safely say we have a lot of at the climax, we have a lot of cane worship today. &gt;&gt; But that's not my desire. I'm not called to cane worship. I'm called to worship at its highest level with all the elements there. &gt;&gt; These elements were missing in Cain. And I'd say they're essential elements, but from time on, from that time on when it was worship, but missing something, God never took pleasure in it. I wouldn't go so far as to say he rejects a sincere heart. Please understand, God doesn't just reject sincere hearts. And if they're offering what they can offer, that's fine. But he withdraws himself from worship that's missing certain elements. In fact, in some cases, he rejects it if it's missing certain elements. There are places in the scripture that show this and I don't have the time to cover them, but there are lower forms of worship even to Jehovah. There were times when God's people mixed their worship with the ways of the heathen. &gt;&gt; They borrowed from the heathen, whether it was Baal worship or whatever it is, and they mixed it together. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I I trust some of you would pray for me. God told me to speak these things. &gt;&gt; It's hard, but I'm going to obey the Lord. &gt;&gt; Normal circumstances would have there's several ministers here and different ones to have someone else speak, but I know God told me to say this this morning, and I say it with the greatest humility. I trust you pray for me. But you see, now there were times when they would mix their worship with the heathen. They borrowed too much from the heathen, and it lost its purity. It lost its originality. It lost its puress to us. And we should be very careful today to not try to get a direct copy of what other churches are doing. &gt;&gt; I encourage you that that our agenda and our goal is not to copy what the other churches are doing, to try to copy what's going on out there. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; But to get it original from God. Can you say amen? I don't remember David having any influences when he was on the back side of the desert and he became a musician and a songwriter and got a hold of God. He did all that by himself on the back side of the desert. He received his inspiration directly from God. &gt;&gt; And when he come out of that, he was ready to face Goliath. &gt;&gt; He had an anointing to face Goliath. &gt;&gt; He had the right anointing. He had the right songs. He had the right faith. &gt;&gt; He learned how to be a worshipper. Amen. &gt;&gt; You young people, you you you have a lot of alone time because you're not married yet. You ought to you ought to be on the back side of the desert. Say, "God, give me your inspiration. Build my faith. Make me a worshipper, a true worshshiper." &gt;&gt; Because guess what, young people? You're going to face Goliath someday. And you need to have God preparing you to get ready for your Goliath. I'm 59 years old. I face some Goliaths. You're going to face Goliath. And you need the faith that David had to go with boldness. &gt;&gt; Lord, make me a true worshipper. Now, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We must be careful. A song that's written even in denominations can come by inspiration from God. But then it's sung by someone missing a sanctified life. &gt;&gt; It's missing an element. That's true. &gt;&gt; Don't think I don't think we should follow who sings it or how they sing it. &gt;&gt; God loves the beauty of holiness behind the person worshiping. &gt;&gt; In fact, the Bible's clear on it. Worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness. &gt;&gt; If holiness is missing, it's missing an element to it. &gt;&gt; God doesn't take pleasure in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right, sir. Come on. God loves the beauty of holiness behind the person that's worshiping. He does not. It does not bring God pleasure when there's a secret life of sin behind it all. You may be the best musician and I tell you because I love you. You may be very good at it and getting better at it, but God does not play take pleasure in gifts or or uh talents when there's a life of sin secretly being hid behind it. [Applause] Shadrach, Meshach, and Abedneo was hearing some great music put on. Bible says they heard all kinds of music, big orchestra. It was beautiful music. But don't be deceived because as beautiful it was and the variety that was there, it was beautiful, but it was missing something. Matter of fact, they had something injected is that he was that music was drawing people to wash worship an image of the prophet of that day. &gt;&gt; Well, it's okay because it's worshiping the message. But if it's worshiping the prophet of the day, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego say, "No, we're not doing that. That's not what we worship. That's not the reason we worship. We're not going to worship our brother, our friend, the prophet of this hour. Our worship belongs to one person, and that's the Lord Jesus Christ. They say, "We will not bow. If you put us in and we burn, we're not going to bow. We're not going to bend. We're not going to change our principle. We're not buying into this because it's related to the message. We're not doing it. Our worship belongs to him and him alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They were stern on making sure the worship was pure. &gt;&gt; Not missing any elements to it. &gt;&gt; Throughout the Bible, it wasn't worship God was looking for. There's a reference in Isaiah 66 at the beginning. He says, "Your sacrifices have become uh your elations." is is like swine's blood. So now we have a place that's bringing sacrifices the people of God and it's the right sacrifices but it wasn't giving God pleasure. And he goes on later on in the chapter he says to this man while I look to him that's poor humble and of a contrite spirit. To this man will I look. So they were bringing the right sacrifices but without a humble broken spirit. And God was not pleased. &gt;&gt; So it's it's sobering. And it's very sobering to realize this has been happening throughout the Bible. And then Paul brings up in the New Testament. He brings up you can give your body to be burned. You can understand all the mysteries. Anybody know where I'm going? 1 Corinthians 13. It's in the New Testament, too. You can bring all this. You can understand all the mysteries. Give your body to be burned. You can speak in tongues. But if it's missing the element of Holy Ghost love, &gt;&gt; he says it's as a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol. &gt;&gt; That means it's just noise to God. It doesn't give him pleasure. He doesn't take pleasure because you have all the speaking in tongues, all that. But if you're missing Holy Ghost love, you're missing the key element. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I just Why you preaching this, brother Ball? Because really, if I get to it and have time, I don't want to just bring all the bad. I want to bring the good. Cuz we're headed God is forming a people in the last days. &gt;&gt; And he will finally, after 6,000 years. Because what he's given to the bride in the last days through the prophet, he'll finally get to his true worshippers. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. I believe I'm preaching to some of them here this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Many acts of service, but it's a sounding. And let me say something to you. If there's elements missing in your worship, it's just noise to God. &gt;&gt; Music can become just noise. &gt;&gt; And we call it the anointing. Be careful. &gt;&gt; Be careful. &gt;&gt; It can be just noise. And really the the person that we're interested in is just noise to is God. If it's just if it's just a sounding brass and tinkling singing it to him, we're failing. &gt;&gt; I I was looking up last night. I was curious. I I love the song that we sing in the heart of worship. I'm coming back to heart of worship. And Matt Redmond wrote it. And he tells the story of a church's journey. This is back in the 90s. He tells a story how he wrote the song. I don't know if you ever read it, but his church's journey is his church took the journey with the pastor back to the core of worship after experiencing a season where worship had become overly focused on style and performance. &gt;&gt; The song reflects a time when the church intentionally stripped away instruments, sound systems, and other external elements to rediscover worship's true essence, a heartfelt devotion to Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, they went through a season. They're recognizing, first of all, we're putting too much emphasis on other things. &gt;&gt; And we're missing the heart of true worship. We're kind of pushing him out. And isn't that what the Leoian church did? He was on the outside, but all the worship was going good. And all the music was going good. But I'm telling you, if he's been put out, pushed out the door. You've missed what worship is all about. &gt;&gt; Trust me, I'm not speaking to anybody personally here. my church. I think all of us musicians and singers, which I'm included in you, I think all of us can take this finetuning this morning that we have a goal to reach towards. We don't want to settle for lower worship. We want to reach for the highest of high in our worship to the Lord. Every one of you. &gt;&gt; I'm not here to rebuke somebody. I'm here to give you guidelines. I'm here to say, let's take this to the next level in our worship to the Lord. Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Goes on to say, "The story behind the song begins with a period of reflection and reorientation within Redmond's church community. The church decided to put away their instruments and sound system for a few weeks, encouraging people to bring their Bibles and focus on what they could offer to God from their hearts. This led to a deeper understanding that worship is more than just a song and that God searches the heart, not just outward appearances." &gt;&gt; Amazing. &gt;&gt; Amazing. Someone not doesn't have the truth of the last hour, but they're catching inspiration. Hold on. Wait a minute. Wait a minute here. Let's let's slow down just a minute. &gt;&gt; Let's make sure we understand. And out of it comes this inspiration. I'm coming back to the heart of worship. And it's all about you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Goes on to say, one of the most common lurs is an overfocus on style. that tempt that temptation has a certain ability to grab the attention of everyone who sees or hear. So we start we start acting in a place to just draw the attention of what's going to be flashy enough to draw the attention. And I believe music can brother Bram says music and healing campaigns was the bait on the hook. It has a drawing card to it to bring them to truth. But we need to use it for that &gt;&gt; purely. Can you say amen? And so it has this lure to grab the attention of everyone else who sees it. Matt Redmond was one of the first to admit the danger of getting caught up in the quality of sound, the desire to be pleasing to more than simply the ear of God. A few years back, his church was on the forefront of modern worship. But the pastor sensed that in all the excellence of craft, there was a heart of praise missing from the gathering worship. The pastor of our church, Mike, did a brave thing. We stopped using the PA and the projectors, packed away our instruments for a while, and gathered it in an adjoining room with nothing but our voices and the Bibles. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. &gt;&gt; This led us into a whole new season. We stripped away anything associated with style, preference, or performance. And there was a real sense of discovering the heart of worship again. Thus, the song, I'm coming back to the heart of worship. As a church family, we'd always given a lot of time to responding to God through song. However, we'd lost something of the sense of bringing an offering. Instead, a sense of uh uh consumerism had seeped in. Songs and style and personal volume preferences and so crept and so on have crept far too high up the ladder. We lost the dynamic of worship being the allconsuming response to the alldeserving revelation of God. &gt;&gt; I can be corrected by that this morning. &gt;&gt; In his book later, he says, "After a while, the worship band and the sound system reappeared, but now it was different. The songs of our hearts had caught up with the songs of our lips." Amen. &gt;&gt; You had something in the churches out there sometimes they a lot many times they had a revival here recently what they called a revival in Kentucky at that college. This happened too. This revival happened. It was 2,000 young people getting together and formed a church. I really believe that people begin to hunger for the reality of God. &gt;&gt; And the only thing the church can point them to is maybe a show or good music. What a tragedy &gt;&gt; because even this movement fizzled out because why? They had no substance to bring those young people to. I'm glad to say this morning, it's not me. It's But I believe that we have a substance. &gt;&gt; When somebody is hungry for God, I believe we have a place that we can take them to. And that hunger can be filled &gt;&gt; not only by music and good music, but can be filled. but the reality of a supernatural God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; There were a few times in the Bible where the worship just hit just right. 12:30. I'm aware of the time. They give me a clock back there, so don't worry. Can I go on a little while longer? &gt;&gt; There are a few times that in the Bible the worship just hit just right. It wouldn't be like the our days when he's it's going to hit perfectly right. But it hit just right. And when it did, the worship struck the right thing and the right thing was there and the right elements were there. And when it hit just right, things would happen. Solomon's temple is a great example of that. There must have been all the elements there of dedication of rededication of pure hearts &gt;&gt; because when they struck that and incidentally friends there was hundreds of worshippers there was hundreds of musicians there was 120 trumpets &gt;&gt; I don't think they were quiet trumpets I think they were loud &gt;&gt; can you say amen &gt;&gt; and and and this was a hu I wish I'd have been there but to be honest with you I'd rather be here in the service this morning rather that in Solomon's day because God said he said the glory of that temple won't even compare with the glory that's in the temples of the end times. I'm glad to be here this morning cuz I believe I'm not a part of a movement but I'm part of what God's doing &gt;&gt; to bring true worshippers &gt;&gt; that he breathes it in &gt;&gt; and it's a sweet smelling savor to him. I take pleasure in my people. May God take pleasure in my worship. &gt;&gt; May he be pleased with my worship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; May he be pleased with the way I play the guitar. May he be pleased with I way I play my piano. &gt;&gt; How I use my voice. &gt;&gt; May he be pleased with it. That's right. &gt;&gt; That place that place began to just there was such something struck it just right and God just come down into that temple and swept in there with his glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sometimes, you know, I I think it gets quiet sometimes when that type of glory comes &gt;&gt; cuz nobody can really say anything. But their worship and their instruments and everything congealed in oneness and harmony and it just pleased God and he swept through that whole place with his glory. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Jesus, the glory filled the temple that the minister wasn't even able to speak. In prophecy, he says there will be a restoration of the temple and the glory of the latter will be greater than the first prophecy. All the elements will be there in the end time. It will be just right in the eyes of God. I just want to say this. You know what's going to happen at the climax of these worshippers at the end time? His glory is going to come in their temples so much. this glory is going to be so much we'll take a rapture. &gt;&gt; They didn't do that in Solomon's day. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon says in 1953 and the beautiful Rebecca came out and said, "Now ever who waters this camel," do you guys have that quote? He said, "Lord, let that be the one you've chosen." And Rebecca went and watered the camel and give him a drink and then watered the animal. Look, the very animal that she was watering, the animal represents a beast, of course, a beast of burden, which means power in the Bible. And the very animal that she was watering was the very animal that packed her to see her bride, see her groom. Is that right? And what is watering? The very power that we're watering now with praises and thanksgiving and glory and power and might is the very Holy Spirit that'll pack us up to see Jesus someday. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I want to be a part of that glory. &gt;&gt; And I believe I am. I believe I will be. Praise the Lord. When you get to the end time, it shows up in the message with the prophet preaching words like, and this is shows the heart of God. He's coming to that time with the true worshippers because he's addressing worship when he preached God's only provided place of worship. &gt;&gt; That's not just a sermon. It's God saying &gt;&gt; it's time. &gt;&gt; It's time that the all the elements are right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So, he's speaking. And God's speaking these things cuz he's coming at that time of the true worshippers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's why you find in the message he goes to churches and he sees this tight skirts. They're in the choir. They're up singing and &gt;&gt; the big high heeled shoes. Come on. &gt;&gt; Well, let's just close the service and sing only. &gt;&gt; Take the name of Jesus with you. Child of sorrow and of woe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't eliminate that stuff from the message. But if you look at it as just some dress code, you're missing it. Amen. &gt;&gt; What's happening? The heart of God &gt;&gt; is screaming at at those Pentecostals saying, "I'm looking for true worship and that's missing some elements. &gt;&gt; No, no, that tight that slit up that dress, that tight form fitting dress. &gt;&gt; That bobbed hair, those earrings, and you're up worshiping me, and God's saying, "Listen, uh, you know, I might respect it, but listen now. That's not what I'm looking for. &gt;&gt; That's not what I'm looking for yet. And it's not all about what we wear. You can have the perfect dress and the perfect modesty and still not have the heart of worship. &gt;&gt; But all the elements have to come together. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Don't Don't underestimate and don't dump out anything the heart of God is breathing on this generation. The reason he's saying it to you young girls and you sisters and you men, don't look like a woman. Don't dress. Don't men don't dress like women. Women don't dress like men. Why is he saying it? To make our lives miserable. No. He's coming to the true worshippers. &gt;&gt; This is it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they're going to strike it just right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And his glory is going to sweep through. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, let my worship be right to you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Let it be right to you, Lord. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's time to quit playing around. It's time that we don't have lower forms of worship. It's been 6,000 years of it. It's time that the highest praises come from the mouth of the people &gt;&gt; as high as praise. Hallelujah. David expressed more than anyone about the power of praise. I have to take a moment on him because he he talks about it as a boy. He learned it on the back side of the desert desert. And so, you know, he expressed more about praise than anyone David did. And God used him to create music and create songs. Every revival, every inspired person of God, if they have a gift, that gift just brings forth that revival in their life. And that's what happened to David. I just want to remind the devil this morning. &gt;&gt; God created music. Amen. &gt;&gt; And devil, you perverted it. &gt;&gt; God created true worship and devil, you perverted it. &gt;&gt; Years ago, I used to read the lyrics of a song. I looked them up again last night. Excuse me for reading Barry Manalow's song. He didn't write it, I don't think, but look at what the devil's boasting of way back in this song from Barry Manalo. Only those over 50 probably will remember this song. I write the songs. Well, who's speaking here? The first verse says, I've been alive forever and I wrote the very first song. I put the words and the melodies together. I am music and I write the songs. I write the songs that make the whole world sing. I write the songs of love and special things. I write the songs that make the young girls cry. I write the songs. I write the songs. It's so warm and fuzzy and it's just oh oh something here is writing the songs and the devil is boasting &gt;&gt; through that lyric from 1960 or whatever it was. &gt;&gt; Second verse says my home lies deep within you &gt;&gt; and I've got my own place in your soul. Now when I look through your eyes, I'm young again, even though I'm very old. &gt;&gt; Devil, I'm exposing you this morning. &gt;&gt; You wrote this song, but it's a lie. &gt;&gt; I'm Oh, the the bridge says, "My music makes you dance. It gives your spirit to take a chance. I wrote some rock and roll so you can move." Well, he did come up with that. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Music fills your heart. Well, that's a real fine place to start. It's from me. It's for you. It's from you. It's from me. It's a worldwide symphony. And for 6,000 years, it has been a worldwide symphony because it is the world and the devil's grubby mitts are all over it. I want to remind the devil this morning that you did not create music. &gt;&gt; My God created music. [Applause] And you may have written some songs with the wrong inspiration, but God has written some songs and given it to people. And God writes the songs that make the young girls repent. God writes the songs that make takes a sinner and redeems them by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; God writes the songs who gives deliverance and gives a shout of joy to somebody who's been delivered. God writes the sweet, quiet, anointed songs that will calm your nerves in the midst of a storm. &gt;&gt; True. He writes the songs that make the bride sing worldwide. The redeemed of the Lord say so. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; David, it wasn't that praise was the only thing he talked of. You know, in Psalms, David's real and honest about many things. His struggles, his sin, his enemies, his pressures. He actually writes songs about all that. His struggles, his sin, his enemies, his pressures, his fears. It's all in the book of Psalms. Then he came out, these came out of songs, out of his trials for us to enjoy today. But most of what comes the song I feel the pull came out of I don't mean to lift myself here, but I was here in this city 36 years ago. I moved to an apartment. I started to have services in the in in the business building below. And I just I didn't have a clue what the Lord wanted next in my life. I took a job, but I was so much in the dark about what God wanted next for me. And I went up in that office one night and God be to drop in my heart something that said, "I may not have all the answers right now, but there's one thing I can't deny. I feel the pull of God." &gt;&gt; At night, I lay in bed and I begin to cry. And my heart don't understand, doesn't know exactly why. I can't explain with tongue or pin. The spirit's groanings deep within. &gt;&gt; But it must be God &gt;&gt; here in my soul cuz I feel the pull. &gt;&gt; And that's all I needed to know at that time in my life. &gt;&gt; God has brought me through trials. God has brought me things that I write songs about. That's what songwriters do. He brings you through things like he did David. But the interesting thing about David, most of what comes out in all of his trials, he always ends up with a victory and a positive confession. He always ends up with a praise upon his lips. Praise to his God. How can the guy who sinned again with Bashibba went through so many trials, the enemies against me, he was reproached, people were talking against him. How can a guy go through all of that and he ends up with the praises of God on his lips? He ends up being the great writer that wrote about the praise of God more than anybody. &gt;&gt; It's not just when he felt like it. You know, David, he didn't praise God just when he felt like it. He ordered his mouth &gt;&gt; to make praise a continual thing. Here's some scriptures. I will bless the Lord at all times. His praise shall continually be in my mouth. Re from the rising of the sun to the setting of the same, the name of the Lord shall be praised. &gt;&gt; Rejoice in the Lord always. And again, I say rejoice. Somebody ought to praise us with the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 13:15, I'll bring the sacrifice of praise continually. When you're in a trial, that's why it's called the sacrifice of praise. It's not so much here when you bring the sacrifices. It's easy when everybody's around to praise unless you come in with the dull drums and you've lost your job or something like that. But I want to tell you, David learned that's when God wants to hear you sing. He wants you to come to church. &gt;&gt; And you've lost a loved one and you've had the greatest trial of your life. And then all of a sudden, this worshipper rise and said, "I will worship my God. &gt;&gt; Though he slay me, I'm going to trust him." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. God loves to hear his people sing in the midst of their trials. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His praise shall continually. It's a sacrifice sometimes here, but most of all, it's a sacrifice of praise when you're in your trial. &gt;&gt; David did it continually. I believe David really had a revelation of this. It was a revelation to David. Real joy of life comes when we find what he takes pleasure in. Can I say that again? The real joys in this life comes when we find what he takes pleasure in. &gt;&gt; Not what we take pleasure in. &gt;&gt; What he takes pleasure in, &gt;&gt; he takes pleasure in us. And specifically when our mouth is mostly bragging about and glorifying him. Brother Bram says, "If I'm accused, some lady said, you brag about Jesus too much. Guilty as charged. &gt;&gt; If that's what my testimony is on my tombstone, &gt;&gt; he bragged too much on Jesus, then so be it. &gt;&gt; You ever seen somebody who's bragging all the time on themselves? It's all the time. They always end up telling their stories and always bragging on themselves and it's it's all about them, them them. Let's switch that over and it's always coming out about the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's brag on him. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Here we go. God's army coming in the last days with a sword on their hand, a praise on their lips. I believe we're coming to it. Friends, how many believe that &gt;&gt; the high praises refers to, just so you know, the high praises first of all refers to an intense, fervent, and outward often an outwardly expressive form of worship and adoration to God. That's the first meaning to high praises. It's not just praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. It is an intense fervent outward expression form of worship and adoration. It goes beyond casual and perunct and and casual praise involving deep motion but it involves deep emotion loud declarations &gt;&gt; high praises joyful even exuberant expression of gratitude for God's greatness and goodness. That's the first meaning. The word ha is the root of hallelujah. In the Hebrew, ha, their understanding was to celebrate with exuberance. Hallelujah. Somebody say hallelujah. Is to celebrate with exuberance. Clamorous loud to boast it. How can people get mad at people being loud when they're worshiping? &gt;&gt; How can be people be critical of something getting loud? Those 120 trumpets you probably would have been offended at. Oh, no. That was that was Hebrew music. I wouldn't mind it that loud. Now, I got I got a notion that you'd have been going to David saying, "Can we cut it down to 50 trumpets? It's hurting my ears." Trust me, friends, I I don't think we should go to the place that we're hurting people's ears. But don't forget, highest praise is an exuberant loud the loud sounding symbols. It was intended to be intense. &gt;&gt; Another Hebrew word for praise is yada. Boy, how the devil has changed the meaning of that word. &gt;&gt; Cuz now it just means yada yada yada yada yada yada yada. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; That ain't what it means. Yada means it literally means to use the hand, especially to revere and worship. So when the Hebrews would hear praise and worship, they would physically worship by using their hands, raising their hands, clapping their hands. &gt;&gt; It was a physical action as well as was with the mouth. &gt;&gt; It was intense emotion. It was not lukewarm or passive. It involved strong feelings of awe, of love, of thankfulness towards God. It means loud and exuberant expression. And it often involves loud singing, shouting and joyful declarations of God. This is what it meant in the Old Testament. It also means high praises means spiritual warfare. High praise is seen as a powerful spiritual weapon capable of pushing back the forces of darkness &gt;&gt; and aligning believers with God's will. It means an outpouring of the spirit. It can be in the manifestation of the Holy Spirit's presence and power working in and through believers. But this is the last thing about high praises that I want you to catch. While music is often part of high praise, it's not limited to music. High praise can be expressed through various forms of worship and even in daily life through actions of obedience &gt;&gt; and love. &gt;&gt; It's not just in the music. Sometimes when you worship God, you don't need music to do it. &gt;&gt; And if you become too dependent on music to bring you into worship, you're missing an element to worship &gt;&gt; cuz he is more than the music. He is more than just what's playing and it's appealing to our ears. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; My point is if you think it's just singing in church worship or this high praises speaking or shouting or speaking in tongues, that's all a part of the church. It's all a part of the church. But it's not just that. The high praises of our mouth means we're letting our mouth be used of God for the right things. &gt;&gt; The third pole, sword strikes his hand. The third pole had a right saying the right thing. &gt;&gt; I take pleasure in this people worshiping because they have a sword in their hand and they have the high praises of God on their lips. &gt;&gt; Not just in church, not just in front of your brothers and sisters. I said something a few weeks ago. I said, "You know what? You're complaining, your complaining mouth, &gt;&gt; will never bring you &gt;&gt; to more of the glory of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, I I'm concerned. I'm not concerned about the bride, but I'm concerned about her growth because she quickly grows in maybe the music and the worship and the services and maybe grows in the gifts, but God hasn't grown in their tongues enough. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; We have long hair and long dresses and long tongues. And I'm wondering, we haven't reached the pinnacle yet in this message. Sometimes we try to work it up through the music or through a service. No, no, no, no. You don't have to work anything up. &gt;&gt; Can I get an amen? You don't. You don't. This revelation you don't work. This is not choosing the stimulation first. No. Brother Bram says the stimulation comes from revelation. Revelation's first. Preach the word to the people. You don't have to worry about the stimulation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we would try to work up the stimulation first. You might be missing the substance of revelation. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord. &gt;&gt; And so you you you you have to come to this place that you begin to you realize what the high praises of God. And I think there's too much talk that goes on and spills out of our mouths &gt;&gt; and we give our I'm ending now, but I just want to hit this final point and strike the devil &gt;&gt; right where it hurts. right in the heart of what he does in the people that are holding the message and got the word and the sword, but what about your mouth? &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; You may have the sword, but what's coming out of your mouth every day? &gt;&gt; What's coming out of my mouth? And I'm here to say the high praises of God wasn't just last night when we're exuberating our worship or this morning. It's what's coming out of your mouth on a daily basis. And if it's complaining, you'll never come to this glory. &gt;&gt; If it's gossiping against another church, you'll never come to this worship. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; It's tearing down preachers. It's preaching against other preachers. It's tearing down this. And if I you feel like this morning, I I I apologize. I don't want you I don't have any right to speak against anybody else. I'm just trying to correct and say uh God is bringing us to true worshippers. &gt;&gt; And we have to give our hearts, our lives, but this word has to grow up into our mouth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul speaks of corrupt communication &gt;&gt; coming out of our mouth. And that's in our that's in our Ephesians. That's in our that's in our adoption chapter, Ephesians. And he talks about our mouths and corrupt communication, gossip, putting down the other person, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Putting down the other message, church, &gt;&gt; putting down somebody. Can we Can we just leave each other alone? &gt;&gt; Oh, God. &gt;&gt; Can we leave each other alone and let everybody do what God calls them to do? &gt;&gt; And respect it. Can we quit backbiting one another? Can we quit criticizing one another? Can we get the Holy Ghost in our tongue and say, "Lord, I only want edifying things to come from this mouth." &gt;&gt; I can't answer for the person sitting next to me, but this mouth, I wanted to bring the high praises of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Tear down your wife. You tear down your husband. You think you know everything. You tear down every other message. church. God, come and purge our lips and purge what we say. Clean us, Lord, of this to be the true worshippers of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the hour Jesus said true worshippers were come will come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I just got to believe it's not just the sword in the hand, &gt;&gt; but it's when these high praises &gt;&gt; reach their highest point. &gt;&gt; Amen. And there's a people that he's drawing pleasure from. &gt;&gt; He's saying, "I'm so pleased with what's coming out of their hearts, their mouths, their lives. &gt;&gt; I'm breathing it in. This is the people that I'm going to finish the work with." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. It's been intense. But I just I as I said, I know the Lord. There's not too many times the Lord knocks me on the head this much and says, "You preach that." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But don't say that to both. I want to obey the Lord. And I trust all of us to say, "It's more than just music. It's more than just choirs. &gt;&gt; Keep doing it. Keep doing your best at it. &gt;&gt; Play skillfully." I'm here to encourage this morning. Encourage you. Keep going forward. &gt;&gt; But God wants all the elements in worship. &gt;&gt; It's time for it. It's the hour for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's the hour for it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we we'll use a song from somebody in the denominations that was inspired because we knew it come from God. Even that church has kind of gone arry now. And God bless them. But the inspiration of God come to that pastor and them says, "Let's take a step back." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the song comes forth when the music fades. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And all is slipped away. And I simply come, longing just to bring something that's of worth that'll bless your heart. heart. I'll bring you more than a song. For a song it itself is not what you have required. [Music] &gt;&gt; You search much deeper within through the way things appear. You're looking into my heart. [Music] I'm coming back to the heart of worship. And it's all about you. It's all about you, Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the things I made when it's all about you. It's all about you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; King of this world. No one good. How much deserve [Music] the we [Music] &gt;&gt; think about it this morning. Every single sing [Music] I'll bring you more than a song for all is not what you have. [Music] You search my deeper way through the way things appear. Can we stand? Lift these holy hands to him this morning. [Music] Jesus &gt;&gt; Jesus. Jesus. about you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. [Music] It's all about you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's all about you, Jesus. When the music fades and all is straight away and I sent I'm longing, Lord, longing just to &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Something that's worth that bless. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Could I bring you that offering, Lord, to bring you more than a song? &gt;&gt; Let the offering of my life bring you more, Lord. For a song itself is Jesus. [Music] You search my way into my heart. [Music] It's all about you. [Music] and it's all about you. It's all about you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; I wonder in this moment this morning before we close, we could offer not a song, but a an offering of rededication to the Lord. Every musician, every singer, every believer. I wonder if we could lay our hands on one another and pray for one another and lift our voices this morning in a a prayer of rededication to God to give all of ourselves to him. Not just not just our hearts. How many would say, "Lord, let me give my mouth to you. May you correct what's coming out of my mouth and let it be the high praises of God, the thanksgiving of God." Can we pray for one another this morning? Heavenly Father, we're offering a rededication of our lives to you, Lord. And there are many gifts here and many people, many churches represented. Even online, they're listening. Lord, all of us, we take this moment to tell you, God, we rededicate our hearts, our gifts, everything to you that they could be effectively be used for your kingdom. But Lord, at the end, what it said about us is that they are the true worshippers of God, worshiping in spirit and in truth. You spoke of that. You said they were coming and here we are. Lord, we pray we would be those that you have prophesied to come in the last days. Grant it, dear heavenly father, moving us deeper than what we were before. Even before we come in this morning, let us be changed in our attitude, in our spirit. Lord, forgive us when we've said the wrong things and spilled out venom as a volcano erupting and it spills out all kinds of hatred and pride. Oh God, forgive us. Get control of what is spoken from these lips. I pray, Father, let it only be thanksgiving. Let it only be edification building up. Let it only be the right thing. Lord, this is the power against the enemy. Satan, you don't know. You won't know what to do with the people that this is just yielded to God this way. Grant it, Father, we pray as we give our hearts completely to you this morning in Jesus name. Jesus name. Can you give me a key for that? We worship you in spirit and truth. We worship you in spirit and in truth. [Music] We worship you in spirit, in truth. We have heard your word, felt your presence too. Yes, we have Lord. Yes, we have. We worship you [Music] in spirit. We're the true worshippers. Raise your hands and sing it to him. We worship you. Here I am, Lord. and in truth. Yes, we worship you in spirit and in truth. Oh, we have heard and fell your presence too. Oh, we worship you [Music] in spirit. and praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. And let all God's people praise the Lord. [Music] Shake off those heavy bands. Lift up those holy hands. Let all God's people praise the Lord. Let all God's people praise the Lord. Let him take pleasure. Praise the Lord. [Music] Praise the Lord. Let all God's people praise the Lord. Shake off those heavy hands. Lift up those holy hands. Let all God's people praise the Lord. Sing it now. Praise the Lord.

Let me give you lessons. Go ahead. There you go. There you go. Now you got it. Oh, shake off. Oh, shake off those heavy bands and lift up the holy hands. Let all God's people praise the Lord.

Let all God people praise the Lord. Amen. Thank you, Lord. Receive the Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. I don't know about you, but it's it's been good to be in the house of the Lord today. Hallelujah. I know I met my Lord. Hallelujah. I'm feeling pretty free right now because I delivered a burden on my heart. Now it's on you. Praise the Lord. I'd like to sing a song. He's promised to what you give key of G for that. &gt;&gt; Go ahead and give it to me. He's promised to hold my hand. He promised to help me stand when the valley's too low and the river is too wide.
