[0:17] i want to speak on the storms of life
[0:19] this morning the storms of life
[0:22] it was up probably about three o'clock
[0:24] last night just really searching god's
[0:26] will and praying and praying and
[0:29] i feel like we go through a lot of
[0:30] storms in this day i believe what we do
[0:33] but we got a god that's right there
[0:34] beside us
[0:35] we might not see
[0:37] things in our lives and we go through
[0:39] things in life but this for a reason
[0:42] is the shape used to shape me
[0:44] just to build us shape us into the right
[0:47] person we're supposed to be
[0:49] matthew 8
[0:51] verse 23 matthew 8 23
[0:55] it says and when
[0:59] he was entered into a ship his disciples
[1:02] followed him
[1:04] you know that's a good place to be in
[1:07] his disciples if you're a disciple of
[1:10] jesus christ you're going to follow
[1:11] jesus christ you're going to follow the
[1:13] word of god you're going to follow what
[1:14] the prophet says and it releases to the
[1:16] word of god in this day
[1:19] verse 24 and behold there arose a great
[1:21] tempest in the sea
[1:23] and so much that this ship was covered
[1:25] with waves
[1:27] but he was asleep
[1:30] you're going to see as i go through
[1:31] these storms of life we could spend all
[1:34] morning but for what i'm speaking on
[1:36] this morning the storms of life
[1:38] you know there's one key pattern jesus
[1:40] was asleep
[1:43] and then it says verse 25 and his
[1:44] disciples came to him and awoke him
[1:47] saying lord save us we perish
[1:50] and he said unto them why are you
[1:52] fearful oh you've little faith then he
[1:54] arose or rebuked the winds in the sea
[1:56] and there was a great calm
[1:58] may god has blessed his may be seated
[2:01] father we just love you lord
[2:03] father we come into your house with
[2:05] thanksgiving and praise
[2:07] father how we just love you lord we just
[2:09] love to opening the word lord
[2:12] god your service is not complete without
[2:14] the hearing of your word father how it
[2:16] strengthens us father more than just the
[2:18] daily bread we eat but god it's our life
[2:22] god it's abundance that you fill us up
[2:24] father that that vessel just keeps
[2:26] getting full from an endless fountain of
[2:29] grace
[2:30] father may you bless this service may
[2:32] you bless this church may they continue
[2:34] to be a lighthouse here father father
[2:36] there's light in goshen this morning
[2:38] lord god may you just spread your wings
[2:41] of eagles and father may we bind our
[2:43] face together may we pull on the word
[2:45] this morning father we come in the name
[2:48] of jesus christ
[2:50] let us be an oracle for you in jesus
[2:53] name amen god bless you i just really
[2:56] like that
[2:57] it might be a little simple this morning
[2:59] but i tell you i believe god sent us a
[3:00] prophet with a seventh grade education
[3:03] where we could understand it i'm glad he
[3:05] stopped by mile this morning and say hey
[3:07] brother chris i'ma let you you can
[3:09] understand the word you can understand
[3:11] this message that we have
[3:13] but it says in his disciples verse 25
[3:15] his disciples came to him and woke him
[3:17] saying lord save us we perish and he
[3:19] said to them why are you fearful
[3:21] oh ye of little faith you would think
[3:24] the disciples already saw the fish fry
[3:26] they think they saw everything you think
[3:28] the disciples would have the best faith
[3:31] you would think that a little storm or a
[3:33] raging storm in that day would not waver
[3:36] their faith
[3:37] you would think if you walked up to the
[3:39] disciples in that day it's so easy for
[3:41] us to say oh we believe this message or
[3:43] we we know all the quotes and we we know
[3:45] what the bible says but how are you
[3:47] acting through the storm
[3:49] how are you what are you preparing when
[3:51] you're when there's a storm and you you
[3:53] hear it on tv and you hear the or the
[3:55] radio or you see that we were at the
[3:57] thing we saw on the tv storm where the
[3:59] the at the hotel and the tv pops up and
[4:01] it shows the it shows the meteorologist
[4:05] he's sitting there telling you when the
[4:07] storm's going to take place and how to
[4:09] prepare for it and things like that but
[4:12] i think a lot of times we're not
[4:14] anchored in the word enough
[4:15] we're not reading what the prophet's
[4:17] saying or we're not anchored in the word
[4:19] enough to show to give your forecast to
[4:21] know what's going to happen in this day
[4:24] when covert arises we don't just sit
[4:26] around and just say well the devil's
[4:28] going to get victory but we still come
[4:29] to church
[4:30] when sicknesses arises and he said
[4:32] things wouldn't be a drop in the bucket
[4:34] to cancer and we hear things he's
[4:36] already prepared you and he's made
[4:38] preparation for the storm that we're in
[4:41] but i tell you the bride just has to
[4:43] rise a little farther above the storms
[4:46] and when you're in the airplane you've
[4:47] been we've been in many planes lately
[4:49] flying and i tell you you ever been in
[4:51] there and i tell you the first thing we
[4:53] do we walk through the plane and my wife
[4:55] and them will just keep on walking
[4:58] but i tell you i always want to look
[4:59] through the door to see who the captain
[5:01] is
[5:04] because i want to see who's flying that
[5:06] plane
[5:07] my wife and kids would just keep on
[5:09] walking they're worried about their seat
[5:10] i'm not worried about the seat i'm
[5:12] worried about who the captain of the
[5:14] plane is
[5:15] but i'm telling you we have an old ship
[5:17] of zion that's being controlled by jesus
[5:20] christ this morning there's god in your
[5:22] life as god in every aspect of your life
[5:25] this morning that every storm you battle
[5:27] whoever see you raging i tell you you've
[5:29] got jesus christ controlling that storm
[5:32] and i tell you how thankful we should be
[5:35] the one that put the stars in the space
[5:37] that conquer death hell in the grave
[5:39] that's who your conqueror is this
[5:41] morning i tell you i don't care what
[5:43] what you've come in here this morning
[5:44] anxiety depression it can leave you this
[5:47] morning i don't care what it is god can
[5:50] free you this morning he touched his
[5:52] sister's voice he can touch you this
[5:54] morning you've got a family that he's
[5:56] saved just claim him this morning
[5:58] he's wanting to do something for you
[6:00] this morning i don't care about all your
[6:02] storms just make sure jesus is in the
[6:04] boat
[6:07] i want to go to uh that was matthew or
[6:09] matthew what he said about it
[6:12] so let's go to uh mark
[6:14] let's see what mark mark 4
[6:16] mark 4 35
[6:19] and the same day when he when even has
[6:21] come
[6:23] he said unto them let us pass over to
[6:25] the other side
[6:27] jesus said let us pass them to the other
[6:28] side
[6:29] aren't you thankful that we have a
[6:31] command this morning that jesus said hey

[6:35] through no matter what family problems
[6:37] i'm going to we're going to the other
[6:39] side
[6:41] and then it says 36 and when they sent
[6:44] away the multitude they took him even as
[6:46] he was in the ship even as he was in
[6:49] this ship i'm glad that he was already
[6:52] there before they got there
[6:54] and it says and there was also there are
[6:56] little ships and there arose a great
[6:59] storm of wind and the waves beat into
[7:01] the ship so it was now full
[7:04] and he was in the hinder part of the
[7:06] ship asleep on a pillow
[7:10] i don't know if you caught that this
[7:11] morning but maybe i'm simple but i was
[7:12] like wow
[7:14] jesus christ he has they have nothing on
[7:16] mr pillow these days
[7:19] what are you thinking a great thing they
[7:21] create everything they just get an idea
[7:23] from the bible he was asleep on the
[7:24] pillow before mr pillow created the
[7:26] pillow
[7:28] he was rested
[7:30] and they were in the storm
[7:32] and they awoke him and they said unto
[7:34] him master cares thou not that we perish
[7:37] and he arose and rebuked the wind and
[7:39] set unto the sea peace be still
[7:42] and the wind ceased and there was a
[7:44] great calm and then awesome verse 37
[7:47] there's a great storm but in the midst
[7:49] of your great storm verse 39 there's a
[7:51] great calm for your storm
[7:54] no matter what storm you're going
[7:55] through whatever you came through this
[7:57] morning they're a great storm but
[7:58] there's a great calm to your storm
[8:01] there's a great the i all i am i am
[8:04] there's a great absolute we can trust
[8:06] this morning
[8:09] and then we're going to go read what
[8:10] luke said luke 8
[8:12] turn to luke 8 verse 22
[8:15] luke 8 22
[8:17] it says now it came to pass a certain
[8:19] day that he went into the ship and his
[8:21] disciples said let us go to the other
[8:22] side of the lake and they launched forth
[8:25] but as they sail he fell asleep
[8:27] and there came down a storm of the wind
[8:29] of the lake and they filled with water
[8:30] and they were in jeopardy
[8:32] and he came to him and walked up saying
[8:34] master master we perished then he arose
[8:36] and rebuked the wind and the raging of
[8:38] the water and there's ceased and there
[8:40] was a calm
[8:42] and then he goes back into their faith
[8:44] it's impossible to please god without
[8:46] faith
[8:47] without faith that's the key this
[8:48] morning is having faith no matter what
[8:51] you're going through no matter what
[8:53] you've been through
[8:54] he's took you where he took you from you
[8:56] can look when you were a child to the
[8:58] age you are now he's took you and he
[9:00] took you through all different types of
[9:02] storms or trials or tribulations but he
[9:04] says they're more precious than gold
[9:07] that's what the bible says they're more
[9:08] precious than gold i'll just take the
[9:10] gold this morning tomorrow the rest of
[9:12] the week might be a rough day but i tell
[9:14] you i still serve my god
[9:17] i'll serve my god brother baby said in
[9:19] the oncoming storm 1960 i love this in
[9:22] paragraph 20.
[9:23] he said the church
[9:25] doesn't make you a christian
[9:28] the church only helps you to be a
[9:30] christian
[9:31] it helps you remain
[9:33] what you've been born into it helps you
[9:36] contain your experience
[9:40] read that again the church doesn't make
[9:42] you a christian the church only helps
[9:43] you to be a christian helps you aren't
[9:45] you thankful that we have a lighthouse
[9:47] here aren't you think we've got brother
[9:49] paul these ministers here that's being a
[9:52] lighthouse here in here in michigan i
[9:55] it's not to be a it's like i want to say
[9:57] it helps you to remain what you've been
[9:59] born into helps you to contain your
[10:01] experience
[10:02] where you're fellowshipping together
[10:05] with brethren of precious faith
[10:08] we're fellowshipping together this
[10:10] morning
[10:11] so when people tell you we don't need
[10:13] church and we don't need this you need
[10:15] church
[10:16] the prophet
[10:17] there's nothing in the in the message
[10:19] that says we don't need to go to church
[10:21] there's nothing in the bible that
[10:23] doesn't say it says more so as the days
[10:25] of approaching
[10:27] i tell you just call me a fanatic about
[10:29] the word but i am fanatic about jesus
[10:31] christ because that is that is all i got
[10:34] that's what's kept me through this fire
[10:36] this has got me and when you get
[10:38] anchored in jesus christ through every
[10:40] storm through every trial he carries us
[10:43] through
[10:45] broad ramp says in the mighty conqueror
[10:47] and this goes to relating to what i'm uh
[10:49] reading today he said old satan he said
[10:52] satan tried
[10:54] he said he tried again to do everything
[10:57] one night laying on the back of the ship
[10:59] he's seen him asleep
[11:01] and he said listen to this
[11:04] and he said i'll destroy him right now
[11:07] this is satan
[11:08] he says are you thankful for a prophet
[11:10] that can look through here and just pull
[11:12] it right out and bring it to our level
[11:15] he says he said he's seen him asleep
[11:18] he said i'll destroy him right now
[11:20] but he couldn't he tried to tempt him
[11:23] into doing the wrong thing but he
[11:25] couldn't do it
[11:26] he said why i want you to pay attention
[11:28] to this right here
[11:30] he said because he'd been sprayed
[11:32] with the repellent of predestination
[11:36] he was sprayed with the repellent
[11:39] predestination
[11:41] so i'm here to tell you this morning i
[11:43] don't care what trials you go through i
[11:45] don't care whatever your boat's shaking
[11:47] this morning but i'm here to tell you
[11:49] this morning you've been sprayed with
[11:52] the repellent of predestination
[11:54] and that's something that should put
[11:56] something in you this morning i'm not
[11:58] talking about the fertilizer on this
[12:00] corn this morning i'm talking about the
[12:02] fertilizer when you get sunk in the holy
[12:04] ghost and the holy ghost spills you from
[12:06] the head to you of every fiber of your
[12:08] bones and i'll tell you you'll dance
[12:10] like david dance you'll start running
[12:13] these aisles like david dance when you
[12:15] trust god with all your life every storm
[12:18] you go through in life i'll tell you
[12:19] when you've been sprayed with the
[12:21] repellent of predestination no devils in
[12:24] hell can come against your family no
[12:26] devils can take your life until god is
[12:29] ready
[12:33] that's our god
[12:35] he said no no the word said he'd be here
[12:38] amen there ain't no devil going to
[12:40] bother him he said no other son of god
[12:43] that's predestinated to take his place
[12:46] he is sprayed with a repellent of satan
[12:49] repellent satan's poison denominational
[12:52] daughters don't even touch him at all
[12:54] he moves right along nothing going to
[12:56] bother him see he's the man when he was
[12:58] laying out there on that ship that night
[13:00] he said he floated around ten thousand
[13:02] devils ten thousand devils coming after
[13:05] jesus
[13:06] you don't think he's coming after you
[13:08] today your family whoever he's got but i
[13:11] tell you greater is he that is in me the
[13:14] he that's in the world
[13:17] he said ten thousand devils on the sea
[13:19] swore
[13:20] they would drown him he said that little
[13:22] old ship bombing up and down like a
[13:24] bottle stopper he said devil says i got
[13:27] him now he's asleep laying there
[13:30] he said he's so tired from healing the
[13:32] sick too he can't move he said he was a
[13:35] man when he was laying there asleep
[13:36] that's true
[13:38] probably said but when he put his foot
[13:39] on the brow of the boat he looked up and
[13:41] said peace be still
[13:43] that was more than a man
[13:46] he said that was more than a man that
[13:48] was god speaking out of the sun
[13:50] hallelujah it's true he was a man that
[13:53] night laying in the back of the little
[13:55] boat out on the stormy sea that little
[13:57] boat was tossed about like a bile
[13:59] stopper
[14:00] but he said but once he arose he walked
[14:03] forward to his foot on the brow of the
[14:05] boat and looked towards heaven said
[14:06] peace be still
[14:09] and he and the winds and the waves
[14:10] obeyed them that was more than a man
[14:12] speaking there that was the great mighty
[14:15] conqueror
[14:16] that was the great mind that's who we
[14:18] serve this morning we don't just know
[14:21] the father by some creed or denomination
[14:23] today we know the father and we have a
[14:26] personal relationship with him and i
[14:28] tell you when it gets on the inside it's
[14:30] like from the inside out like the dove
[14:33] it cleans from the inside and it changes
[14:35] every aspect there's things in my life
[14:38] it's still shaving off because i'm not
[14:40] into a true adoption to to the uh
[14:43] theophany this morning but he still
[14:45] every time you come through these doors
[14:47] every trial you face is for your reason
[14:50] it's for your good brother said it's
[14:52] because he's got confidence in you
[14:56] and confidence in you
[14:59] he said he spoke to the wind and when he
[15:01] went to the cave like a puppy dog in the
[15:03] side of the lion
[15:05] he spoke to the waves and they folded
[15:07] their hands in perfect rest upon the sea
[15:09] bosom
[15:10] he was more than a man he was a mighty
[15:12] conqueror
[15:13] he could conquer nature he could conquer
[15:15] death he could conquer the waves he
[15:17] could conquer the air
[15:19] there he is he said there's never been
[15:21] one like him
[15:23] oh i know that you think i'm excited i
[15:25] love what he says because i feel the
[15:27] same way this morning
[15:28] he said maybe i am but let me alone
[15:32] he said you may think i'm crazy but i'm
[15:35] a lot happier this way than i was the
[15:37] other way
[15:39] i was a lot happier this way when you
[15:41] see your kids in church and you see them
[15:43] dancing in the spirit would you rather
[15:45] have them dancing and singing in here
[15:47] than out some dogs are in the world and
[15:49] not dancing over in that spirit hey just
[15:52] don't even sit there and criticize on
[15:54] them just say lord oh just pour the
[15:56] blessing on them oh a poor blessing they
[15:59] can't contain i always want to have my
[16:01] kids in the in the presence of jehovah
[16:04] because this world will try to change
[16:06] you for the worse but when you get one
[16:08] touch of the holy ghost he'll take all
[16:10] your situations you might still go
[16:12] through them but i'll tell you at least
[16:14] he's in the boat
[16:16] at least he's in the boat
[16:20] so i'm here to tell you this morning
[16:22] even if jesus is in your boat you're
[16:23] still going to go through storms
[16:27] even if jesus is in your boat this
[16:29] morning you're going through a storm
[16:32] okay he's asleep i just want him in the
[16:35] boat if he's in the back of the boat the
[16:37] front of the boat asleep in the boat
[16:39] driving the boat i just want him in my
[16:42] boat
[16:43] i just want him like controlling the
[16:45] boat
[16:48] i like what matthew said he was a great
[16:50] tempest mark said it was a great storm
[16:52] luke said the waters were raging
[16:54] this ain't just a little story they they
[16:56] told all night
[16:58] he says in the bible if you look through
[17:00] there for time it says he come in the
[17:02] fourth watch
[17:04] there's four watches that that first
[17:06] watch between like six and nine the
[17:08] second watch nine to eleven nine to
[17:10] twelve and then twelve to three and
[17:12] three the six he they told for three
[17:14] miles and the second storm i'm gonna go
[17:17] to this morning they told for three
[17:19] miles
[17:20] he says they they throw for three miles
[17:22] and then jesus shows up right there at
[17:24] the end
[17:25] i believe that's what we're going
[17:27] through right now
[17:28] i believe all the hells of waves because
[17:31] satan know his time is short i believe
[17:34] we're going through the raging of hell
[17:36] we're all in a boat together this
[17:38] morning but we just need to get in the
[17:40] boat and grab an order this morning i'm
[17:42] not talking about talking about one
[17:43] another i'm talking about getting the
[17:45] boat and start rowing one way to another
[17:48] and not go against one brother or one
[17:50] sister but get in the boat because we're
[17:52] going to a destination that's headed for
[17:55] victory and for cavalry it's already a
[17:57] paid price he's already paid it all
[18:00] death hell and grave has already
[18:01] conquered if he takes you for this right
[18:03] now it takes me on the road as i leave
[18:05] praise god i'm already in this dimension
[18:08] oh praise god it's just that
[18:11] rachel sings that song they'll speed up
[18:13] they'll slow down
[18:15] i'm looking for that day
[18:17] every time i get up and all that every
[18:19] time the sun turns and i wake up a
[18:21] little older i say lord i just want to
[18:23] be more like you
[18:25] i just on that day i just no matter what
[18:28] i've been through in life it still don't
[18:30] come close to what you paid for your
[18:32] your vessel vestige was more marred than
[18:35] any other human on earth your ribs were
[18:37] hanging out you paid the ultimate price
[18:39] you went through he said he was tempted
[18:41] in all manners
[18:43] i'm so glad that he sent jesus christ
[18:46] who came in the body himself came in the
[18:48] body because he wanted to see how we
[18:50] could be tempted because you know what
[18:52] he was tempted in all manners so if
[18:54] you're going through a trial this
[18:55] morning trust god this morning
[18:57] trust god because he said he was tempted
[19:00] for any manner that you've been through
[19:01] this morning
[19:02] and when you can talk to the father he's
[19:05] like i've been through that i've been
[19:07] through that sister i was tempted that
[19:09] way and that way he can make
[19:10] intercession upon our confession this
[19:12] morning
[19:14] i'm thankful we have that
[19:18] just make sure he's in the boat
[19:20] brother says why were people so tossed
[19:22] about 1956. he said let the storms rage
[19:26] my anchor holds with the veil
[19:28] can't tell you why we have a lot of
[19:30] storms on the seas this day but i'm
[19:32] thankful for an anchor that holds
[19:35] steadfast within the bell
[19:37] he said when she's a rocket it looks
[19:39] like every move she'll she send her into
[19:42] the bottom yet my anchor is in the veil
[19:45] i've anchored in the bell he said i've
[19:47] anchored in jesus the storms of life i
[19:49] brave i've anchored in jesus i fear no
[19:51] wind or wave i've anchored in jesus for
[19:54] he had power to save i've anchored in
[19:56] the rock of ages
[19:58] just like that sister was singing
[19:59] earlier i tell you what i'm not ashamed
[20:02] of the gospel
[20:03] i'm not ashamed of this message i'm not
[20:06] ashamed i'll tell you what wherever i go
[20:08] i want to proclaim it i don't care what
[20:10] i've gone through in life i want to tell
[20:12] you about jesus christ what he's done
[20:14] for me what storm he's brought me
[20:16] through if i'm going through a storm i'm
[20:18] going to still praise them if i'm in the
[20:20] middle of a storm i'm going to still
[20:22] give to the church i don't care that's
[20:24] when it shows you're a christian when
[20:26] you're going through a storm and you
[20:27] still can say here brother here's some
[20:29] money i don't have it and then the next
[20:31] day we've had many times where you give
[20:33] money and all of a sudden you'll be home
[20:35] and a check come in the mail for four
[20:36] times that much more
[20:39] oh it's like the in fact the lady when
[20:41] elijah came up towards which all she had
[20:43] was the more sore bread uh just one meal
[20:45] left and he said hey that it don't
[20:47] matter hey here here it here it's all
[20:50] but it didn't become dry he just kept
[20:52] filling it up because he saw our
[20:53] faithfulness
[20:55] he saw our faithfulness
[20:58] joseph meeting his brother in 1956
[21:01] he said when he's when the sea is
[21:03] blowing and storms did you ever i guess
[21:05] maybe some of you have ever seen
[21:06] privilege of a sea anchored
[21:08] oh my i rode them when they throw out to
[21:11] the sea anchor like that until the
[21:12] little craft could couldn't even go over
[21:14] the top of the wave
[21:16] he said i would go through the wave he
[21:18] said it would go through the wave but as
[21:20] long as the anchor held that's all that
[21:22] makes the difference
[21:23] as long as you're anchored you asked
[21:25] some of the old-timers in here this
[21:27] morning you asked the sister over here
[21:28] you asked sister lafontaine and things
[21:30] like that this morning what's kept you
[21:33] and she'll probably most likely she's
[21:34] going to say jesus christ she's going to
[21:37] tell you jesus has brought me through
[21:38] everything i thought it was the biggest
[21:40] storm the greatest tempest but it was a
[21:43] great calm that's come through every
[21:44] storm in life every trial every
[21:46] tribulation my family's not saved i'll
[21:49] tell you don't quit don't give up on
[21:51] them the devil wants you to give up on
[21:53] them this morning but i tell you you
[21:55] keep claiming them you keep praying for
[21:57] you trust the word of god it says you
[21:59] can have your inheritance so go you can
[22:02] have it this morning
[22:04] oh there's going to be some people there
[22:06] just because your faithfulness
[22:09] think about it
[22:10] your faithfulness people will be there
[22:14] he said for the people that loved you
[22:16] brother abraham people that loved they
[22:18] will be there
[22:20] oh i take what grace
[22:23] what grace we have i'm not telling you
[22:25] to live a picnic live and just come to
[22:27] church and say well don't get it off of
[22:29] me no you keep getting in the boat and
[22:31] every day you might not feel like rowing
[22:33] the boat this morning you might have
[22:35] woke up not going to come to church you
[22:37] might have stayed up all night like me
[22:39] but i tell you i just tell you to get in
[22:41] the boat
[22:42] and i tell you to be consistent with
[22:44] your life be consistent with your prayer
[22:46] life be consistent with your giving be
[22:48] resistant with your outreach and i tell
[22:50] you just get in the boat and help one
[22:52] another this morning
[22:54] help one another
[22:56] he said oh my i rode them out
[22:58] he said the crap couldn't go over the
[23:00] top he would go through the way but as
[23:02] long as the anchor held that's all that
[23:04] makes the difference whether we go over
[23:06] it under it around it or through it
[23:08] doesn't matter
[23:10] the anchor holds
[23:12] that's the way when storms of light
[23:14] begin to shake us
[23:15] we may have to go through or we may have
[23:17] to go over around it he under it but
[23:20] just let the anchor hole within the veil
[23:22] to the unseen
[23:24] and brother ramp goes into talking about
[23:26] now i'm going to paraphrase this with
[23:27] time but he goes on talking about the
[23:29] little boy with the kite
[23:31] and he said he couldn't even see the
[23:32] kite he said but you know what he would
[23:34] do he would tug on it every once in a
[23:36] while have you tugged on jesus every
[23:38] once in a while and said i don't see you
[23:41] up there but hey are you still there
[23:43] just tug on them this morning
[23:45] say i'm going through the deepest trial
[23:47] i'm going through a family situation i'm
[23:49] going through a marriage situation i
[23:51] tell you to try jesus this morning
[23:58] he said he just tug on it
[24:00] he said tug on it he said i could feel
[24:02] it tugging he said if you could feel it
[24:05] still tugging god's dealing with your
[24:07] hearts
[24:08] he said then we know our anchor still
[24:10] holds
[24:12] first like peter said first peter 4
[24:14] 12-13 beloved think it and not strange
[24:17] concerning the fiery trial which is to
[24:20] try you
[24:21] as though some strange thing happened to
[24:24] you but rejoice
[24:26] how hard is that when you're going
[24:28] through
[24:29] temptations and trial he says to do the
[24:31] opposite brother branham even says do
[24:34] the opposite
[24:36] he says but rejoices so much as ye
[24:38] partakers of christ's sufferings that
[24:41] when his glory shall be revealed you may
[24:44] be glad also with exceedingly joy
[24:47] have you ever went to the airplane and
[24:49] you get through there and i never
[24:50] finished that but you ever get up in the
[24:52] storm clouds and they tell you to buckle
[24:54] up right when you go to go to the
[24:55] bathroom i'll tell you that's happens to
[24:57] me all the time you got to go to the
[24:59] bathroom and they say sorry we have a
[25:01] weather forecast seat on the monitor
[25:03] about 20 minutes it's going to the
[25:05] storm's going to hit we want everybody
[25:07] to be seated nobody moving but i tell
[25:09] you aren't you thankful that god is the
[25:11] ultimate forecast don't you think that
[25:13] you work for the weatherman today don't
[25:15] you think that you have a weatherman
[25:17] upstairs that controls every every wave
[25:20] every storm you could you work for the
[25:22] weather man i tell you i told the boys
[25:23] the other day i said we work for the
[25:25] weather man boys
[25:26] we work for them i said because we have
[25:29] the great all the great weather man that
[25:31] they they can be so wrong on the weather
[25:34] that's right they tell you a story man
[25:36] we live in jeffersonville in the whole
[25:38] of the whole cloudiness
[25:40] and dreariness sometimes i think it's
[25:42] washington state
[25:46] and then when the sun comes out like i
[25:47] think the sun came out the other day and
[25:49] i said what is that
[25:50] wow
[25:52] wow
[25:53] that thing's beautiful what thing's
[25:55] shining down

[31:55] in your house and just mopping the floor
[31:57] and it let be background noise i'm

[32:04] this day that's talking to us that's
[32:06] feeding you and when you go to the gas
[32:08] station or you go somewhere where cova

[33:56] and when god makes a promise and
[33:58] opposition arise that's the only test
[34:00] whether you've got the word or not
[34:02] he said the man's that's not got good
[34:05] gold don't mind going to the testing
[34:07] stone to see

[34:19] testing you
[34:20] but i tell you just keep trusting the
[34:22] lord
[34:23] keep trusting god
[34:26] because i tell you even if he takes you
[34:28] right now or takes you right i tell you
[34:30] broadband says death he says the devil
[34:32] can only take you to the end of the
[34:33] river and win after the river that's
[34:35] where life starts
[34:36] you know what we're just passing through
[34:38] this place
[34:39] you passed all these churches we passed
[34:41] this golf course over here this morning
[34:43] hey i'll tell you if i wouldn't say if i
[34:45] didn't know what i knew today i would
[34:46] probably be out there with them but it's
[34:48] the grace of god when i pass through i
[34:50] said thank you lord for stopping by my
[34:52] house one day and calling me from that
[34:54] golf course or some baller room or some
[34:57] other denomination this morning because
[34:59] i was coming to a church where there's
[35:01] light ons this morning and there's gosh
[35:03] there's light on in goshen this morning
[35:08] victory day when it looks like
[35:10] everything's wrong going wrong he said
[35:12] god's given you a trial
[35:15] and listen brother says this
[35:17] he's got confidence
[35:20] in you
[35:22] think about that this morning
[35:24] he said he's got confidence i tell you
[35:26] some of you are like wow he's got a lot
[35:28] of confidence in me because i'm going
[35:30] through so much i'm going through this i
[35:32] don't know which way's up i don't know
[35:34] which way is down but i tell you you got
[35:36] a god that knows every direction and
[35:38] knows every storm he knows it before you
[35:40] go through the trial before you go
[35:42] through the marriage problem whatever it
[35:44] is this morning he knows you're going
[35:45] through it i'll tell you to be steady in
[35:47] the boat and just say jesus guide me
[35:50] through this
[35:52] he said he's got confidence in you he
[35:54] don't have to have your baby around
[35:55] brave baby year round he there there's
[35:58] he said you're not a hotbed plant a
[35:59] hybrid you're a real christian
[36:02] god's given you the test to see what
[36:04] you'll do about it
[36:06] brother abraham says he's giving you a
[36:08] test to see what you'll do about it
[36:11] no wonder why peter said these fiery
[36:13] trials while counting the joy more
[36:15] precious than gold
[36:17] he said he's put his trust
[36:20] in you
[36:22] one harder
[36:23] i'll tell you when i sign up to the
[36:24] military and we're going i didn't want
[36:26] to go through any storm i didn't want to
[36:28] go through i'm telling you i'm just
[36:29] going to tell you now i i signed up for
[36:31] the gi bill
[36:33] i thought hey this is this will pay for
[36:35] school because daddy ain't going to pay
[36:36] for it so hey i'm going to sign up dad's
[36:38] handing this waiver i'm ready to go i
[36:40] need to get to a more established some
[36:42] kind of balance in my house and that
[36:44] didn't really have that or nothing i
[36:45] said well maybe the military helped me
[36:47] but you know what it still took jesus
[36:49] christ when i met him on the back side
[36:51] one day and i said lord come in my heart
[36:53] and i saw the message of the hour and i
[36:55] saw what the word said and i told the
[36:57] boys the other day i said boys you're
[36:59] going to learn the inside and the front
[37:00] and the back the middle you're going to
[37:02] learn every bit of this book i said
[37:04] because this is what keeps daddy going i
[37:06] said through every trial through every
[37:08] covenant through every sickness through
[37:10] every delta virus to an american airline
[37:12] virus i don't care what it is this
[37:14] morning this will get you through
[37:17] i said this will this will guide your
[37:19] life this will give you every every
[37:21] answer you've got there's a bible bible
[37:23] question there's a bible answer
[37:27] problem said now the fountain
[37:29] exhaustible fountain of life he should
[37:31] flow through us today lord and cleanse
[37:33] us from all unbelief and sin
[37:35] that we might stand in thy presence
[37:37] knowing that there is a need among us
[37:39] i love what he says here he said then
[37:41] his blood he said but then when we think
[37:44] of him who came and took our sins i love
[37:46] this
[37:47] then with his blood there it was not us
[37:49] in in the presence of god it's him
[37:52] just our voice through his blood
[37:57] his blood speaking
[38:01] aren't you thankful when he came in abel
[38:03] he said he came looking for cain he's
[38:06] able he came looking for abel he said i
[38:08] don't see him where is he he said but
[38:10] his blood speaks
[38:12] think about how much more jesus christ
[38:15] blood speaks this morning
[38:17] the innocent one when you start to speak
[38:20] you speak through the blood you claim
[38:22] jesus in every storm every trial every
[38:24] tribulation of what you're going through
[38:27] and he'll tell you he said his blood
[38:29] speaks
[38:31] i want his blood to speak in every
[38:33] aspect of my life
[38:35] every aspect
[38:38] but i tell you you know what the problem
[38:39] was with them they didn't rely on the
[38:42] master
[38:44] they didn't realize they've seen
[38:45] everything they saw the miracles just
[38:48] like in brother branham's meetings they
[38:49] saw miracles after miracles and you see
[38:52] it on the platform a deep call to the
[38:53] deep but you know what he would even
[38:55] look at brother billy paul one time and
[38:57] he says did you understand that service
[38:59] he said yes daddy he said did you
[39:00] understand that service he said yes
[39:02] daddy finally he said no daddy i did
[39:05] he said i could count on one hand how
[39:06] many people got that service
[39:09] but i tell you
[39:11] it's all in revelation brother braham
[39:13] said pray for revelation more than
[39:15] anything
[39:16] i say lord give me more revelation lord
[39:19] and this progression it's the
[39:21] progression walk if this sister or this
[39:23] young one or this brother is not there
[39:25] yet you keep encouraging them
[39:27] you know whatever they're going through
[39:29] the day don't get out kick them in the
[39:30] kick them in the leg or kick them
[39:32] whatever i tell you i want to tell you
[39:34] to encourage them so you keep pressing
[39:36] on brother i was but you know what's so
[39:38] great we have one another going through
[39:40] the storm because the other sister could
[39:42] have went through the same storm five
[39:43] years ago or this brother or whatever
[39:46] say brother i went through that i had a
[39:47] brother call me 11 o'clock i had a root
[39:49] canal the other day and my pastor called
[39:51] me up you asked rachel i got in the car
[39:53] and i'm just going to i'm going to give
[39:54] the devil a kick in his teeth right now
[39:58] and he calls me about 11 30. i'm hurting
[40:00] i'll just be honest i was hurting i was
[40:02] i was taking some medicine he called me
[40:05] up i was about to get in the shower i
[40:06] was fixing to get in he said hey brother
[40:08] would you go pray with this sister with
[40:10] me
[40:11] honestly i'll be honest i'm just going
[40:12] to be vulnerable today i was like oh
[40:17] i mean honestly think about we all big
[40:19] and bad when we're not going through
[40:20] things or going through storms but let
[40:22] them call you on the phone one time when
[40:24] you're hurting
[40:25] and you're doing this and you're walking
[40:27] to the bed he said hey brother would you
[40:28] go i said
[40:30] yes i will go
[40:31] i will go because i tell you what i
[40:34] serve a god that could take this tooth
[40:36] paint away as soon as i get in this car
[40:38] and i don't care how they drilled on
[40:39] this tooth for four hours but i don't
[40:41] care i serve a god if i die if i fall
[40:44] over going down to pray for i don't care
[40:46] god i'll just be in your presence so i
[40:49] got in the car and i said well sister i
[40:51] said brother what she need i said what's
[40:53] going on he said brother she's been
[40:55] facing with anxiety for like six years
[40:57] and she can't let it go
[40:59] this just happened the other day
[41:02] facing anxiety i started crying
[41:04] i started weeping because guess what
[41:07] i went through that
[41:09] i couldn't even get out of my bed
[41:10] because that will have me bound to
[41:12] anxiety
[41:13] he had me hooked up in anxiety and i
[41:15] started believing all his lies i had to
[41:18] carry the medicine in my body why i'm
[41:19] saying this this morning but i carry the
[41:21] medicine as a as uh you asked rachel i
[41:24] carry the medicine in my pocket because
[41:26] it was a crutch
[41:28] and i started relying more on the
[41:30] medicine than jesus christ i'm just
[41:32] being real and vulnerable today but i'm
[41:34] telling you i started to trust i started
[41:36] thinking i was somebody and the devil
[41:37] would just come right
[41:38] right around me i'd go down the street
[41:40] and i'd have to turn right back around
[41:42] because i couldn't even make it into my
[41:44] work job my job place
[41:47] and i would turn around and i would be
[41:48] shaking so much my heart be going 100
[41:50] miles an hour i thought i was dying and
[41:52] i said lord and one day i just got in
[41:54] love with god and i said god i will die
[41:57] here until you take it from me i will
[41:59] die i will literally just keep praying
[42:01] lord i asked you and he finally took it
[42:03] from me so when i was hurting and i was
[42:05] going through that storm i got in that
[42:07] vehicle and i started going the street
[42:09] and i'm telling you i was in pain they
[42:11] drilled on that one tooth for four
[42:12] constant hours off and on
[42:15] and i got in that car and i started
[42:17] weeping
[42:18] and i started realizing that the storm
[42:21] that i went through years ago
[42:23] was the storm he was calling me for to
[42:25] go to pray for this sister
[42:28] i started realizing the storm that i
[42:30] went through this sister needed to hear
[42:32] about
[42:34] and i got in there and when i started
[42:36] telling her i said brother nathan you
[42:37] don't know the story i said let me tell
[42:39] you what happened to me
[42:41] about that time we got there and i told
[42:43] that sister about the story and about
[42:45] that time she got like she's been
[42:46] battling for years so she came to go
[42:49] outside she'll get outside she'll get
[42:50] started she has to go right back in
[42:53] and so we were in there talking to him
[42:55] and this just was just not long ago like
[42:57] the other week and i went in there we
[42:59] started praying and i started crying so
[43:00] let me tell you about a storm that i've
[43:02] been through
[43:04] and i said let me tell you who's the one
[43:05] that he'll heal me of that storm
[43:08] and i started telling her and she
[43:10] started weeping and she started
[43:11] realizing she needed to hear about my
[43:13] store
[43:14] and she started to realize whom i who i
[43:17] relied on that was in the boat that i
[43:20] didn't realize he was already in the
[43:22] boat i was outside the boat
[43:24] and then i started telling the storm we
[43:26] laid hands on her and she texted the
[43:28] other day she said god completely healed
[43:30] me she took away all my anxiety she took
[43:33] away all my she's held me completely i
[43:36] saw her in church the other day praising
[43:38] god i said that's the god we serve i'll
[43:41] tell you if you come with some baggage
[43:43] this morning i tell you to drop it off
[43:45] if it's a marriage problem drop it off
[43:48] if it's a storm you're going through
[43:49] drop it off because he's paid it all he
[43:52] set you free some of you just need to be
[43:55] free again some other you need your joy
[43:57] back david didn't lose his salvation he
[44:00] just lost the joy of his salvation some
[44:02] of it you just need your joy back some
[44:04] need your candle relent i'll tell you
[44:06] someone and some of you might need a
[44:08] refilling of the holy ghost this morning
[44:10] i'll tell you what i say lord drop a
[44:13] double portion on me this morning drop a
[44:15] double portion on me oh lord holy spirit
[44:18] give me some more of your love
[44:20] [Applause]
[44:23] can't even give me a double portion it's
[44:25] just like brother branham think about
[44:26] him
[44:27] think about the devil's kid came with
[44:28] the jesus in the boat they said you just
[44:30] read it
[44:31] he said he was trying to drown him
[44:33] thinking about his little his little
[44:34] child laying in the bed
[44:37] the devil got up on the shoulder and
[44:39] started saying won't you give up now
[44:42] once you give up now i know the devil's
[44:44] probably telling you that this morning
[44:47] he's probably saying hey give up
[44:49] let me tell you something where you
[44:50] gonna go
[44:52] where are you gonna go
[44:54] you got all you need
[44:56] it's just you need to rely on jesus
[44:58] christ
[45:00] you got all you need i've already been
[45:02] there if you haven't been in the
[45:03] denomination they ain't got nothing
[45:05] they ain't got they have got jesus
[45:07] christ like we got it
[45:09] and you know what you want to give them
[45:11] the key so much when i see a brother
[45:13] back at home
[45:14] or a college student a college student i
[45:16] went with and i say if i could just give
[45:18] this to you
[45:20] more than any dollar bill i'd rather
[45:22] just give you what i have
[45:24] i want to give you this i sav more than
[45:26] anything
[45:29] because there's a void in your life
[45:32] there's a void but brother abraham went
[45:34] through the same thing he had the devil
[45:36] climb up on the shoulder and say hey
[45:37] won't you give up he said he said
[45:38] blessed be the lord giveth and take it
[45:40] away
[45:41] and he said all of a sudden the
[45:42] atmosphere started to change
[45:44] he said it started to change in that
[45:46] room because he realized who he relied
[45:48] on but that came on the inside
[45:52] so what you rely on the storm matters
[45:55] what you rely on the storm matters you
[45:57] think about it they came peter james
[45:59] john they left matthew left tax
[46:02] collecting peter they all left fishing
[46:04] you would think they they would still
[46:05] have the faith of the world
[46:07] seeing all this but when they did when
[46:09] they went through the storm he said
[46:10] where's your faith
[46:12] where's your faith
[46:14] well i think a lot of times i want to
[46:16] read something i got to find it i think
[46:18] it's john
[46:20] first uh yeah uh john 6.
[46:23] this is about a second storm
[46:26] it talks about verse 15 to john 6 15
[46:28] when jesus therefore perceived that they
[46:31] would come and take him by force they
[46:33] they make him a king and departed again
[46:35] into a mountain alone
[46:36] and even even was now come his disciples
[46:39] went down to the sea and he entered into
[46:41] a ship and went over the sea i'm talking
[46:43] about another storm
[46:45] toward capernaum
[46:46] and now it now and now
[46:48] it was now dark and jesus was not come
[46:51] to them
[46:52] and the sea arose by reason of great
[46:54] wind that blew and so that i was just
[46:57] telling you that about them rowing
[46:59] they rode about five to twenty or thirty
[47:01] four loans that's about three miles
[47:04] and jesus walking on the sea and drove
[47:06] them nigh
[47:07] in the ship and they were afraid but he
[47:11] said to them it is i be not afraid and
[47:13] then willingly receive them into the
[47:14] ship and immediately i love that
[47:17] and immediately the ship was at land
[47:22] isn't it unbelievable no matter what
[47:24] storm you're going through no matter
[47:25] what trial you're going through when
[47:27] jesus shows up you're immediately over
[47:29] to the other side
[47:30] [Applause]
[47:32] isn't it wonderful
[47:34] that no matter what you're going through
[47:35] whatever trial you're going through that
[47:37] jesus can immediately just take you and
[47:39] put you for what you've been strolling
[47:41] through or your whole life and just
[47:43] immediately put you where you need to be
[47:45] and put you in the place you need to be
[47:46] i tell you oh we got a god that can can
[47:49] do it all and just put you right where
[47:51] he needs you to be immediately
[47:53] he can do that this morning if you have
[47:55] a sickness or a trial or
[47:57] what anxiety i don't care what it is he
[47:59] immediately can heal you
[48:01] it could be tomorrow it could be the
[48:02] next day it can be two years from now it
[48:04] could be when you get your theophany but
[48:06] he's still going to heal you
[48:08] he's still going to heal you
[48:11] but like all three of these passages
[48:12] jesus was asleep i read earlier
[48:15] but
[48:16] i know we're we're coming down on time
[48:18] but one thing i really like luke 8 8 2.
[48:22] i want to bring some of these out if you
[48:23] don't mind
[48:24] luke 8
[48:26] luke 8
[48:27] 22
[48:31] i'm sorry mark four go to mark 4 mark 4
[48:33] 35
[48:36] it says and he said in the same day when
[48:38] they even was come he said unto them let
[48:40] us pass over to the other side
[48:42] you know what you can do
[48:43] go write something down i can rest on
[48:45] jesus's commands
[48:48] i can rest on all his commands
[48:51] whatever he tells you in this word you
[48:53] can rest on whatever someone tells you
[48:56] on facebook don't rest on
[48:59] or on twitter or all these other nine
[49:00] nonsense i tell you to rest on all these
[49:03] commands he tells you you're a uh
[49:06] you're saved by grace you take your you
[49:08] take it over what the devil tells you
[49:10] this morning if you're going through a
[49:11] trial say get behind me satan i tell you
[49:14] we need to start telling the satan more
[49:15] and start stop talking to them like it's
[49:17] like amazon i'll tell you we i don't
[49:20] know why i'm going here this morning but
[49:21] we order a lot of amazon boxes every
[49:24] time i come home i always go to the
[49:25] front door because i'm always looking
[49:27] for an amazon box and i'll give it five
[49:29] o'clock six o'clock eight o'clock
[49:31] there's always the amazon box and i walk
[49:33] out you know the funny thing is you know
[49:35] ups makes you sign for most of your
[49:37] packages amazon don't
[49:41] think about it
[49:42] i thought about studying the other day i
[49:44] said that's the devil i want to do that
[49:46] to you and me
[49:47] he puts your package right where you
[49:49] need to see it and he reminds you of it
[49:51] every day and you know what you don't
[49:53] even try to sign for it he just
[49:54] redelivers it to you it sits it right
[49:56] there but ups makes you sign for it but
[49:59] i know a god that signed on day of
[50:01] calvary has took every sin every garbage
[50:04] you got this morning every anxiety every
[50:06] storm you're going through and he signed
[50:08] and sealed and delivered it this morning
[50:10] for you to leave free this morning
[50:14] that's the god we serve
[50:17] but we can rest on his commands hebrews
[50:19] 13 5 and 6 let your conversation be
[50:21] without covenants and be content with
[50:24] the such things you have i say lord help
[50:27] me
[50:28] let me be content with what i got
[50:31] for he has said i will never leave thee
[50:33] nor forsake me that's the command that's
[50:36] a promise this morning
[50:37] so that we may boldly say the lord is my
[50:40] helper i will not fear what man shall do
[50:45] unto me why are we worried about what
[50:47] people can do to us
[50:49] we got the word of god
[50:50] we got the truth we got the word we got
[50:53] the message of the hour the problem is
[50:54] we're not it's not living in us
[50:56] sometimes
[50:57] we're not in it enough
[50:59] we have the instruction manual
[51:02] we have the instruction manual i tell
[51:04] you to just bury your head in this
[51:07] bury your life in it
[51:11] that's all i can lead you to this
[51:12] morning but it's nothing but the truth
[51:15] romans 8 28
[51:17] and we know that all things work
[51:20] together for good that love god
[51:22] and that are called according to his
[51:24] purpose
[51:26] if you're called and you love god
[51:28] who it says and we know that all things
[51:31] work together for good no matter what
[51:32] you're going that's hard to say when
[51:34] you're going through a trial that's hard
[51:36] to say when you're in the boat and the
[51:37] boat ship and it's shifting rachel will
[51:39] remind me all the time she said well
[51:41] here comes monday and tuesday stuff will
[51:43] start hitting and i just
[51:45] she'll send me a text and have to remind
[51:46] me
[51:47] and i'll say thank you honey i needed
[51:49] that or she'll open the word that
[51:51] morning and i'll open it and show up
[51:53] into another scripture we might read the
[51:54] same scripture that morning or she'll
[51:56] send a quote or a text that i've read
[51:58] and it'd be the same one that i read
[52:03] broadband said that's the way
[52:05] he does resurrection of jairus daughter
[52:07] he said just about the time he gets to
[52:09] the very darkest of hour then jesus
[52:11] comes
[52:12] we fret we worry we christians and the
[52:15] baby gets sick or something happens
[52:17] something doesn't show up well we just
[52:18] get nervous and upset
[52:20] brother said we just sit quiet
[52:22] he said we should just sit quiet
[52:25] he's the one who commanded it
[52:29] that's hard
[52:31] but it's the truth
[52:33] he said we're living under his
[52:34] disposition living under his grace just
[52:36] sit still and he'll be along after a
[52:39] while
[52:41] he said don't worry he'll open up a
[52:43] healing service somewhere or guide you
[52:46] somebody to pray for the sick or god say
[52:48] talk about somebody he said he'll guide
[52:50] you
[52:51] who guys you could pray for somebody to
[52:52] lift them up send them a card in the
[52:54] mail when's the last time you called a
[52:55] sister or brother that went away from
[52:56] this church or send them a note i don't
[52:59] know why i'm saying this today
[53:01] when's the last time you picked up a
[53:02] card and said hey we miss you
[53:04] instead just talk about it
[53:08] was the last time you just picked up the
[53:09] note and maybe put a little gift card
[53:11] and said hey i love you
[53:13] go get you something to eat
[53:15] he says you know boys were riding on the
[53:17] road the other day we're talking about
[53:18] storms and i have to live it every day
[53:21] more more so and i look at the boys and
[53:23] every time about somebody this and that
[53:24] disrespected them i see you know the
[53:26] bible says boys we were driving on the
[53:27] road i said you tells you to love them
[53:29] more that despitefully use you
[53:32] i said boys the more that come against
[53:34] you the more the people that
[53:35] despitefully use you you love them more
[53:38] and that's hard to do because he's
[53:39] teaching me
[53:41] to love them even more
[53:44] john 16 33 these things that have spoken
[53:47] to you
[53:48] that you
[53:49] might he said that that in me
[53:52] sorry these things that i spoke with you
[53:54] that in me you have might have peace he
[53:57] said i love this in the world you should
[53:59] have tribulation
[54:01] but be a good cheer i have overcome the
[54:04] world
[54:05] jesus christ overcome the world

[54:20] nursing home where my father-in-law was
[54:22] and you just walk through and it's
[54:23] depression on every corner but i tell
[54:25] you if you've got breath in your body we
[54:27] should be praising the lord this morning
[54:29] saying lord thank you for everything you
[54:31] brought me through thank you i might be
[54:33] going through a story but i'm going to
[54:35] praise you through this storm

[55:47] no matter what wave they went through
[55:49] they kept roaring the boats and i'm here
[55:51] to tell you to keep rolling the boats i

[56:14] hell he rose up on the third day he said
[56:16] i have overcome and because i live you
[56:19] live also
[56:21] oh what a promise brother brown said
[56:23] that's the seed of abraham he conquered
[56:25] the grave he rose up on the third day
[56:27] for justification and he said when he
[56:29] rose up he was our justification what
[56:32] does that make us he said he conquered
[56:34] sickness he conquered death he conquered
[56:36] hell he conquered the grave he conquered
[56:38] temptation
[56:40] oh now we have more than conquerors
[56:42] through him that loved us and gave his
[56:44] life for us being a royal seed of
[56:47] abraham
[56:48] you're a royal seed this morning
[56:51] we are more than conquerors i love that
[56:53] song
[56:59] john 14 27 peace i leave unto you my
[57:02] peace i give unto you

[57:26] troubled never let it be afraid
[57:30] i tell you i love these scriptures
[57:33] so inspiring for time i want to skip
[57:35] over a few things
[57:39] the key to the door
[57:40] he said there's only one door to healing
[57:42] and as jesus is at that door
[57:45] there's only one door to peace and he
[57:47] said my peace i give unto you
[57:49] he's only one door to genuine peace
[57:52] you might think you got peace you might
[57:54] accumulate enough money to buy your home
[57:57] you might accumulate enough money to get
[57:58] your children closed have food to eat
[58:01] you might accumulate enough money
[58:03] popularity to popular amongst people he
[58:05] said but when you slip off your shoes at
[58:08] night and get ready to lay down there's
[58:10] only one thing that can give you peace
[58:14] and he said that is if you know
[58:17] if you were dying that night there's
[58:18] only one peace that's jesus is the peace
[58:22] he is our peace
[58:24] he's our healing i'm the lord thy god
[58:26] that heals i the diseases he's the door
[58:29] to heaven and there's only one door he
[58:31] said there's only there's no i'm sorry
[58:32] there's only there's no other door no
[58:35] other way but through jesus christ he's
[58:38] the door to heaven
[58:40] and now jesus is at that door and all
[58:42] those things and faith is the key that
[58:45] unlocks the door
[58:48] faith is the key that unlocks the door
[58:50] you want the key this morning it's not
[58:52] by being afraid in jesus christ when
[58:54] you're going through storms but just
[58:55] have faith he's going to bring you
[58:56] through it
[58:58] he said now jesus is at the door to all
[59:00] these promises of god faith is he he
[59:03] said in his finished work unlocks every
[59:06] door to every treasure
[59:08] there is inside the kingdom of god see
[59:10] key he said he is faith is the key that
[59:13] unlocks every promise
[59:16] secondly we can rest within one another
[59:19] i want to show you this
[59:21] mark 4 36
[59:23] mark 4 36
[59:26] it says and when they when they sent
[59:27] away the multitude i love this they took
[59:30] him even as he was in the ship so they
[59:32] already believed he was already there in
[59:33] the ship
[59:34] and there was also with him other little
[59:37] ships
[59:39] isn't that good
[59:40] there was also loyal ship so don't think

[59:46] trial that there's not us and one
[59:47] another going through that trial before
[59:49] or we haven't went through because
[59:51] there's other little ships maybe beside
[59:53] you that are starting to sink that you
[59:55] can go over there and rescue come by
[59:57] then put put your arm around them and
[59:58] say i've been praying for you you're
[1:00:00] going to make it i went through that

[1:00:36] could go get some bread
[1:00:38] it could be all our vacation maybe call
[1:00:40] me crazy or call me old-time pentecostal
[1:00:43] but i just love being together with love
[1:00:45] with with and you know what you know
[1:00:47] what the devil will tell you this

[1:01:17] love one another better i tell you the
[1:01:19] devil wants to tell you not to come here
[1:01:21] because there's perfect people but i
[1:01:22] tell you we're all gonna be different
[1:01:24] shapes in our lives different storms in
[1:01:26] our life but god is the the main control

[1:02:12] you stop why don't you why you believe
[1:02:14] it you know what you keep believing it
[1:02:16] because one day he said the pastor you
[1:02:18] would line up with your pastor and then
[1:02:20] they're right behind the prophet and the
[1:02:21] prophet will present us to jesus christ
[1:02:24] he said you would get in line with your

[1:04:18] morning i'm just feeling you i'm putting
[1:04:20] so much in you this morning i'm just
[1:04:22] loading you down when you go through
[1:04:24] trials you got something to go to this

[1:04:47] something i'm not drunk like you suppose
[1:04:48] anymore i'm drunk in the holy ghost and
[1:04:51] when this gets hit on the inside and my
[1:04:53] brother said he went to that teaching
[1:04:54] well we went to jeffersonville not long
[1:04:56] ago we were in the area almost by hour
[1:04:59] away and we went to that same artesian
[1:05:01] well and that thing's still bubbling
[1:05:03] today
[1:05:05] that thank you ask rachel we will go
[1:05:07] over there we'll go on the tour in
[1:05:08] jeffersonville we'll bring people to the
[1:05:09] teaching well he talks about we'll play
[1:05:11] the tape and that thing's just still
[1:05:13] bubbles
[1:05:15] hundreds a year i mean it still bubbles
[1:05:17] and he says why are you bubbling what's
[1:05:19] going on
[1:05:20] he said because there's something on the
[1:05:22] inside
[1:05:23] there's some on the inside that's
[1:05:25] bubbling through every storm through
[1:05:26] every trial there's some on the inside
[1:05:29] that overcomes all stars because he said
[1:05:32] are you coming tribulation but i have
[1:05:34] overcome the world i've overcome i tell
[1:05:37] you what trust jesus this morning
[1:05:41] i want to leave you with this
[1:05:43] as they play something softly
[1:05:45] i want to leave you with this because it
[1:05:46] really blessed my heart
[1:05:50] you ever thought about this and this hit
[1:05:52] me the other night
[1:05:54] when they were breaking bread the last
[1:05:55] supper
[1:05:56] think about this they were breaking
[1:05:58] bread the last supper
[1:06:00] oh this was this just hit home the other
[1:06:02] day rachel probably like what in the
[1:06:03] world's going down in that basement
[1:06:06] i know she does she'll hear me just clap
[1:06:08] and praising god
[1:06:10] i'd be four in the morning and i say she
[1:06:12] said you come in the bed you ask me at
[1:06:13] least six times
[1:06:14] i say honey you go to bed and rest in
[1:06:16] christ
[1:06:17] i said because i'm having the best time
[1:06:19] of my life
[1:06:20] i said i wish i could have met him a
[1:06:22] long time ago amen
[1:06:24] all right brother brandon i wish i could
[1:06:25] have seen him a lot earlier on in life
[1:06:27] young kids let me tell you something you
[1:06:29] know why i was thinking i don't know why
[1:06:31] i'm saying this this morning
[1:06:32] if you're dating someone
[1:06:34] or you're talking to someone
[1:06:37] and they're not they're not they're not
[1:06:38] a godly christian and they don't love
[1:06:40] god more than you
[1:06:42] [Music]
[1:06:44] you don't know business talking to him
[1:06:47] you really don't
[1:06:49] because i grew up in a broke up home
[1:06:52] a miserable home
[1:06:54] but god mended it back with a loving
[1:06:55] wife
[1:06:57] that kept herself all her life for a
[1:07:00] poor richard like me
