father we had to come through those same roads and Lord you show them that you are the same God of Grace tonight and their situation is no different Lord that you're willing and wanting to save them from all their troubles and problems cuz you are a savior Lord we thank you tonight continue to bless the power P Lord of this church and Lord the visiting pastors and the people who are here Lord we pray father God that you just have your way in the name of Jesus Christ the church say amen amen praise the Lord if you have your Bibles let's turn to First Samuel chapter 16 1 Samuel chapter 16 amen I won't keep quiet my God is alive how can I keep it inside praise the Lord hallelujah first Samuel chapter 16 and let's start reading that um start at verse seven let's let's back up to six verse 6 1st Samuel 16 and 6 if you have a say man the Bible says and it came to pass when they were come that he looked on elab and said surely the Lord's anointed is before him but the Lord said unto Samuel look not on his cence or on height of his stature because I have refused him for the Lord seeth not as man seeth for man lookth on the outward appearance but the Lord lookth on the heart then Jesse called ainad and made him pass before Samuel and he said neither have the Lord chosen this and Jesse made shama to pass by and he said neither have the Lord chosen this again Jesse made Seven Sons seven of his sons to pass before Samuel and Samuel said unto Jesse the Lord hath not chosen these and Samuel said unto Jesse are here all thy children and he said There remaineth Yet the youngest and behold he keepeth the sheep and Samuel said unto Jesse send and fetch him for we will not sit down till he come hither amen let's go to um Matthew chapter 19 Matthew 19 let's um start at verse 16 Matthew 19 and 16 and behold one came and said unto him good Master what good things shall I do that I may have eternal life and he said unto him why callest thou me good there is none good but there there is none good but one that is God but if thou will enter into life keep the Commandments he said unto him which Jesus said thou shallal do no murder thou shallal not commit adultery thou shall not steal thou shall not bear false witness honor thy father and thy mother and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself the young man saith unto young man saith unto him all these things have I kept from my youth up what lack I yet Jesus said unto him if thou will be perfect go and sell that thou H has and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me but when the young man heard that saying he went away sorrowful for he had great possession may the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you can have your seats amen you know tonight by the grace of God I want to deal with something I believe that we all as young people and even some of us as adults we we we we have to make sure that it's you know uh God is uh uh has the preeminence and tonight my subject is um going beneath the surface going beneath the surface you know if we take um if we take the the the calling of David and you know um God just making a transition from Saul to David Saul was chosen by the people and you know and they wanted a king and they wanted somebody upright and somebody they could see somebody they could confide in and all these natural things that they felt like they were missing but God had all these things already in place before they desired a king you know the King was already there Hallelujah represented through a prophet and you know the the people said we want we want a king we want somebody we can see and all these things but they didn't know hallelujah what was going to happen beneath the surface in Saul's life you know he looked Head and Shoulders he looked like a good King he probably looked like he was anointed but on the inside he had a lot going on on the inside Saul was a man that could hear the word of God and not obey it Hallelujah Saul was a man that could even surrender his gift to God hallelujah and still not obey the word of God so Saul he had issues beneath the surface Hallelujah on the top he looked Mighty on the top he looked like a king but beneath Hallelujah he was very disobedient Hallelujah and you know God got tired of Saul's disobedient and God say hey I'mma get me a new king and the choosing of the new king Hallelujah was the inside man it was who he was in his heart but when it comes down to choosing this King you had to look beneath the surface because when when when Samuel came to Jesse's house no doubt he was caught up in how Saul was chose and he came with the anointing he came with the Horn of all now I want you to realize something Samuel was the prophet for that day and the false anointed and the true anointed were anointed by the same message Hallelujah and you know he came and he said hey God told me that there is a a a king in your house so Samuel so so Jesse gathers all his boys did he gather all his voice no so what I want to start out the same church Samuel Hallelujah he was there under God's Direction but look at Jesse Jesse didn't even believe that David could be king Jesse Hallelujah looking on the surface looking on the top of Who David is looking at his stature and maybe his mannerisms and how he look and maybe dealing with the Sheep he couldn't didn't see that David was a king so he let everything that was above the service surface Hallelujah dictate whether he would call David or not Hallelujah and sometimes we look at what's on the surface and can't really see that you're chosen of God Amen we can't see the gifts of God we can't see amen that you may be the one that's a prayer Warrior Hallelujah you may be the one that get us here through worship that changes the whole anointing the church because we're looking at what's going on on the surface and you know David had to overcome listen to me good David had to overcome how his own parents felt about him oh my isn't that something I've been in prayer services and prayer lines where young people have come up and and they in service and they appreciate what God is doing and when they get in the prayer line their struggle is the relationship that their mother and father has how Mama's treating daddy how Daddy's treating Mama they're carrying the burden Hallelujah something that they shouldn't be carrying they're carrying it everywhere they go so you may look at your children and you may think they're good on the service but on the inside they're feeling your hurt they're feeling your pain they're feeling the things that you are going through so church we have to be mindful amen that there's always a deeper level in God and he calls elab and and and abinadab and all the different ones who maybe will look like kings and then he told him he said I refused them and then he said don't look on the countenance don't even look on the stature of that man but what I'm looking for is somebody after my very own heart now who are you beneath all the singing we just had who are you when we leave this this Tri State meeting who are you when you get back home and you're in your own house Hallelujah and all the things that you're fighting beneath the service are right there in your face again Hallelujah your social status and and who you are on IG and who you are on Facebook and Twitter who you are Hallelujah on that one that disappears see parents don't know what I'm talking about but the young people do it's called Snapchat take a picture and the filth disappears it just like that but is it still really there Hallelujah I've heard young people stream shot things and save it and you thought nobody else would see it but they got it hidden in their archives and the dirt you've done hallelujah is beneath the surface in somebody else's life Hallelujah and you know church when we look at David Hallelujah David was a young man Hallelujah that who was anointed to be king but he still went back to raise sheep let's understand something he knew that anointing was all about he knew what he was standing there Hallelujah and what was the next stage of his life but he was willing to wait on God he was willing to let God put him into Hallelujah the kingdom he although he was already anointed he didn't try to force it he let God lead his life now I'm wondering how many of you young people are in a place right now that you can let God lead your life see one thing I don't believe I don't believe every young person in here is struggling there are some young people filled with the spirit yes sir but God wants you to go on H amen some of us are waiting on person and waiting on that person God wants you to go on Hallelujah because beneath the surface you may be a David hallelujah hallelujah before that time David had no identity hallelujah amen he was just a sheep raiser Hallelujah but that Hallelujah was the contrast of who he really was he was become a leader of men yes sir which his brothers couldn't do now we going to come back to David but I just want the later scene beneath the surface you know if we go out here y'all have some very rough rough Winters amen sometimes and you know what do they do when there's a forecast of snow they start to put down salt and all these other things where do they put it on the surface so then when the snow starts to fall there's something beneath the surface that beneath the snow Hallelujah that's going to eat away at it as it begins to fall are you with me it's already there it's prepared to be there before the storm and I want to say some of you may have some things that are already placed in your life that when the anointing of God Falls Hallelujah you can't even enjoy what's happening because that thing that's under the surface is eating away at what God is doing and sometimes it's unconfessed sins Hallelujah sometimes it's hurts and pains that we carry from service to service Hallelujah from church to church and from experience to experience Hallelujah and those things begin to eat at your experience Hallelujah and that salt is there to do a job to eat up on the ice to eat up on the snow now what they're not considering is that the salt is also going to eat up what is laid on see that's what these Wise Wise Engineers they should have thought about that they they they make up this concoction they put it down on the road for the ice and the snow but not realizing everything that travels on that conc they made is going to be damaged Hallelujah and if you have things hidden things in your life no matter where you go or what path you travel if it's dead is going to eat up on what's falling and it's going to eat up on what's already there and sometimes it takes years and years of that same thing traveling and it eats and it eats to what you got a hole ins the side and the parts of the car has to be greased every year and some people neglect the greasing if you neglect the greasing Hallelujah boats and different things begin to drop off Hallelujah and some of us forget amen how important it is to spend time with God spend time with God young people hallelujah there's a purpose in your life amen yeah we could get up here and we could talk about a lot of things but I love preaching reality Hallelujah I love to put it in your lap and you ask the question where am I in Christ who am I beneath the surface now we go through the scripture Hallelujah there was a young man in the Bible they called him the rich ruler Hallelujah one thing about the rich ruler the scripture says he came running to Jesus saying good Master what what can I do to inherit eternal life Hallelujah now on the surface he was a good church member on the surface he knew his message backward and forward h on the surface he knew brother Brand's dog name he knew the name of the horse he knew about sunset Mountain and subo cane and all the things that we've been told from our youth he had all these things locked down but in reality he's running after Jesus because he knows that something he's missing on the surface everything is good I believe in the message I'm in church I dress right I love going to Tri State but beneath the surface he said what can I do to have eternal life in plain terms what the young ruler was saying say to Jesus is I know I'm lost if you don't have eternal life where are you going so even though this young man was in church Hallelujah let's let's let's let's let's let's go back to it Hallelujah Matthew 19 don't get nervous I'm about to close Matthew 19 and uh let's start at Verse 18 now Verse 18 he says he said unto him which now this is the question he asked Jesus said keep the Commandments now he's confident in where he is as a young believer so his response unto Christ is which I've been around this a long time Hallelujah I can even quote you what the prophet said my pastor says let's understand something when we get there Hallelujah when we get to the other side whichever way you go your pastor ain't going to be able to help you your mother your father ain't going to be able to help you it's your individual Journey that's going to have to stand there before God hallelujah and like I like to say Amen oh my like I like to say when we stand before God hallelujah we're not going to stand there as a family what's your name Buddy dson Dawson is your mother and father here Dad your dad come on stand up here Dawson where's your dad Dawson raise your hand Dad okay there's Dad what's your name Dad Andrew when you in dsing get to heaven Hallelujah God's not going to look at your father and say hey what have you done with my son and you can't look at your father and say father what have you done with me when you guys are standing side by side God's going to look at you Dawson as a Son of God he's going to look at your father Andrew not as your dad as a Son of God so what am I saying to you Dawson you have every right to have the same Revelation he got Hallelujah you got every right to experience God just like Andrew you got every right to be filled with the power and Holy Ghost just like your father Hallelujah because God's going to judge you Dawson by your old experience [Applause] and that goes for every daughter every son when we stand before God you ain't going to be able to blame it on Mom and Daddy you're going to have to stand with your own conviction and whatever you are Hallelujah beneath the surface is what God's going to deal with because on the Dawson may look like he he's so innocent come on back up here one more time Dawson forgive me Andrew Dawson may look like he's just so innocent just don't he look like a nice handsome young boy but one thing y'all got to realize H how old are you Dawson 12 Dawson is 12 and at the age of 12 he got paror Andrew in him go ahead and sit down brother he got habits of Andrew in him he got desires of Andrew in him Hallelujah he got Cravings of Andrew in him Hallelujah and if those things are not channeled by the Holy Ghost Hallelujah it'll lead him into another life but the Holy Ghost will cut off unwanted and unmar desires that happens beneath the surface we hear it all the time amen you look at how Spirits pass through the generations and you say what this young man drinks alcohol because his father did or this young girl is per promiscuous cuz her mother was see generational spirits that follow beneath the surface and sometimes a child doesn't even know why they're doing what they're doing they're doing it because of you mama and daddy and sometimes it's unmar and sometimes it just happens look Abraham I give a prime example Abraham looked at Sarah and he said W girl W man you looking good my girl you don't look 90 years old girl you look like you're 26 36 2 W he looked at her and something had happened but while he was looking Hallelujah he wasn't realizing he wasn't paying attention at what took place beneath the surface Hallelujah he was looking at on the outside and saying man you look good but down deep down beneath the surface God had produced a restoration and the promise of God was right there if he was able to catch it but because he wasn't where he was supposed to be spiritually he looked at her and fear came in his life he said hey you my sister just start lying for no reason hadn't God always been with him so why does he feel like he have to lie now so he just starts to lie and say you my sister and when they come they might going to come now he's prophesying over his own life and the very thing he's speaking over his own life it starts to happen young people I don't care what you into I'm going give you a little insight into my life when I was in the world and I was doing things I wasn't supposed to be I doing I was still coming to church Hallelujah but you know what I used to do to my friends I used to tell them I used to tell them we'd be out doing something I say y'all know what one day I'm going be saved one day I'mma get right with God I'm doing all the stuff I a't supposed to be doing but in my heart something was going on beneath the surface Hallelujah and don't you let hallelujah what we all could see going on on top of the surface stop you from believing that God could fulfill that desire on the inside Hallelujah you know so I will confess one day I'm going be serving God one day I'm going give God all my heart and I would always confess that and then one day it happened how did it happen I don't know all I know is I started to lose my desire for the things of the world and it became easy hallelujah what was happening God was dealing with the inner man we got two many surface Christians we got too many surface young people hallelujah they didn't come to the Tri State some of you come just to get away from home school is tomorrow and you don't want to go to bed early well Mom you know we were traveling so I need to stay up at least one more hour we got too many good surfac Christian young people we need some of you to go deeper how do you go deeper by having a honest confession Hallelujah coming before God and say Lord I got this in my life and I don't want it to be there Lord I'm I'm struggling in this area and Lord I'm tired of it I know you're a God of deliver Hallelujah Lord and I want Deliverance right now Hallelujah we've gathered we're here amen the presence of God is here and I know Lord you can touch my life but see the Rich Young Ruler Hallelujah when he responded to God he said which Lord which Commandments and Jesus said unto him Thou shalt do no murder most of us are not guilty talk to me young people we got some killers in here you need to we need to call tpd on you hide in here murderers but Jesus came to magnify that Hallelujah beneath the surface some of you are killing people with your mouth some of you are killing your friends with your mouth some of you are killing their influence because you're jealous [Music] these things happen in our Rings beneath the surface I don't like the way she wear her hair I don't like the way she wear her clothes let's not talk to her that's an evil spirit that's a murdering Spirit let's keep going there should not commit adultery Hallelujah the Bible says hallelujah if a man look at upon a woman and lust after her he has committed adultery I wonder how many young people are guilty of that vice versa Brothers sometimes we think we get a pass cuz that scripture is just for the women uhuh if I can be if I can talk natural for a second how many times sisters are out and they see a young man coming from the gym and they say Oho he got some nice legs oh his Cal's out that same scripture applies young man if a woman lookth after you and lust she also commits adulty that's why we're not fans of short pants can I keep going he says thou shall not steal thou shall not bear false witness I'm going move forward honor thy father and thy mother oh boy that's a big one right there honor th father and that mother how many of us can just hallelujah look at our lives and say I've always obeyed my mom and my my father or is that a challenge mama don't understand me Daddy don't understand me and beneath the surface Hall you're waiting on a certain age so you can get Loose H especially girls they wait till 18 or whatever the case is and I'm grown I don't have to stay here I'm ready to go do my own thing that's what's going on beneath the surface beneath the surface hallah I'm sick of being a Christian I want to be bad cuz ain't nobody fishing in my pond cuz I'm too good if ain't nobody fishing that mean they ain't got the right bait Hallelujah and that might mean your pond is too deep Hallelujah keep it deep amen hallelujah Let It Be Hallelujah something that they have to be consistent with something that they have to go deep for to get your heart Hallelujah to get everything don't make it easy cuz if I could be honest nobody wants the girl that's easy don't blame me he invited me oh for those of us who hunt some of you young Brothers may be hunters and for those of us that hunt I I you know know I've never been but I got friends who hunt and none of them have ever told me while they were hunting the deer jumped out and say hey here I am meat for the winter never but he has to plant traps he has to put corn down he has to spend time to get that deer to come near Hallelujah and then he can't just shoot it he has to wait and be patient Hallelujah and if a young man is not able hallelujah or willing to wait and be patient on you you tell him go ahead on uh oh brother Paul we in it we in it there's a lot of relationships going on in here we in it Hallelujah I hope you're paying attention to God's will because a man can look right on the surface Hallelujah but only end only way down beneath the surface he may have unconverted Tendencies Hallelujah and as soon as you get married it's all going to come out the real himym is going to come out Hallelujah we all know we hear who we were when we were in our courting stage come on mothers and fathers can let me get a amen you know brother your wife didn't know how nasty you was when y'all recording walk in the house and just take [Music] everything that stuff is in a living room when it's supposed to be in the laundry room and she saying I didn't sign up for this he kept it a mystery into you you say it I do advice Versa Hallelujah there are things Hallelujah that some of you girls Hallelujah are confessing but it ain't the truth oh I just love cooking I just love being a good wife will you come over for dinner come over for dinner we're going to cook you something when are you coming you'll be here at 7 hello Uber Eats you need the surface the real you can't even boil water but that's all right what kind of Desire do you have Hallelujah a man can love you for your efforts Hallelujah he can love you for being real but one thing we can't fall in love with is somebody that's fake and nowadays Hallelujah if you look at it above the surface Hallelujah she might look good everything is fine and you you you get her you marry her and take her home she pull the veil off not only the veil she pull her hair off not only her hair she pull her eyes off not only her eyes she pull her nails off and she's pulling and pulling and pulling and you have a whole rack of things that's not her all of that was beneath the surface I know y'all didn't seen these videos of what makeup can do it drives me crazy I say these people been they be lying to people and then they be wondering why they get beat up after the date cuz they projected something that wasn't true Hallelujah beneath the surface who are you now I know I'm saying a lot of of natural stuff but I want you to catch the spiritual application amen this young man beneath beneath the surface he was a good Christian he was so confident in who he was Hallelujah he come to Jesus and he said which Commandments and Jesus repeats the Commandments that that he laid out and this young man says I've done this from my youth I'm good I've been in church all my life can I get an amen amen amen my father's even a pastor I'm on the choir I sing Hallelujah we anointed that don't mean a hill of beans that's a southern expression but I think you know what I'm talking about and just to show you let me tell you a testimony I know a young girl who's from North Carolina they she would travel with the church and they would get up and sing as a group as a church group at the meetings and one year down at uh Tim Hughes they called The Church up and she was walking up with the church and when they got almost there she dropped dead right there in church 18 years old I ain't going to ask how many 18 year olds we got in here hallelujah but death is not a respect a person that's why you got to make sure you ready and this young girl she drops dead right there in surface in in in in service now I wonder if that was to happen in here tonight what would take place beneath the surface if it was your daughter your son that dropped dead right here in the congregation how would you respond how would your friends respond Hallelujah to that happening right here in church and everybody was like oh my God and then some people started whispering what's happening to oh my oh my God she she di oh my god when we have an example for things like that remember when brother wayy died Hallelujah and everybody was going crazy and just brother BR say sit down you've been taught better than that we don't know what God will do Hallelujah and sometimes things happen in young people's life that shock us but what we need to do is sit down and gather ourselves and say God is still God God is still able God is still able to bring them out of us H let's be confident in our God a brother mov everybody out of the way got down on his knee so y'all be quiet everybody bow your head got down and started praying for her and she Rose came back from the dead but what I love about it she didn't go sit down she got right on up there with the Choir Hallelujah and some s her song even after death she was still able to give God praise Hallelujah I wonder if there are things in your life hallelujah amen was God help you to overcome it can you still give God praise but that's not the end of the story they went back to their home church and what we normally what they normally do is after youth meetings they have a testimony service and this is Tuesday from Saturday to Tuesday Tuesday all the young people going around talking about what God did for them don't we have services like that we talk about what God did for us in the meeting when it got to this young girl everybody else was testifying when it got to her it say she stood on her feet she smiled and she said I thank God for being here and she dropped dead in church this time not to get up what happened it was the grace of God she was supposed to go that Saturday but she wasn't ready so God gave her four days to get her heart right Hallelujah and she took full advantage of it because she knew who she was beneath the surface everybody else saw on the choir singing but she knew she wasn't converted she knew she didn't have the Holy Ghost so after death she made haste Hallelujah after death she got right with God after death she got in her prayer closet and she said I thank the Lord for being here that meant I'm ready and God came and took his daughter home but nobody really knew who she was beneath the surface until that time happened and it's just like the Rich Young Ruler Hallelujah he seemed like he had everything wrapped up everything good but then Jes Jesus says to him if you will be perfect what if God was to say that to you tonight now one thing I want you to keep in mind God's not going to say that to you just randomly he's going to deal with the thing that's holding you back Hallelujah he said to the rich ruler if you be perfect go sell everything you have see that was his challenge that was his God that was who he is beneath everything else he was a man that loved his riches he was a man who loved his status so when Jesus deal with you he's going to deal with what's in your heart Hallelujah and in his heart he loved his riches he loved everything that made his image to be a rich ruler and our God's going to deal with his image do you love your image more than eternal life he said but why are you preaching on these terms cuz I want you to be honest with yourself tonight they stop trying to fake one another out I give you a secret if you chasing somebody you know how you can tag them if you playing tag or whatever you know how you can tag them they can make all the head f it but this part of their body ain't going nowhere so you focus on the center and you will always be able to put your hands on it Hallelujah if you focus on the center you will always be able to touch Jesus no matter how the enemy tries to fake you out no matter how many head moves he got no matter how much he goes to the left or to the right keep your eyes on the center and you'll be able to touch Christ Hallelujah and you know church this young man the Bible says he walked way sad he should have rejoiced because God was dealing with his heart God was dealing with the whole issue of why he was running after him he was running after him to receive eternal life Hallelujah but the only thing that was stopping him from receiving eternal life was his secret I love money he says go sell everything and come follow me there's so much in the story Hallelujah in the story he says go sell everything you got come follow me there's only a certain group of people Jesus spoke those words to come follow me the last time he said that it was to who his disciples this young man was supposed to be a disciple but he had so much going on beneath the surface he couldn't even fulfill the calling that God put in his life the gift of God was suppressed in his own desires go back and read it the Bible says hallelujah he was supposed to be a fisherman of men Jesus said come follow me go sell everything you got come follow me he told to Peter James and John and the rest of them leave your nets leave that come follow me so he's saying the same thing to this Rich Young Ruler go sell everything and come follow me Jesus had a purpose but he couldn't overcome who he was on the inside but let me tell you something you're going to recognize what you rejected one day and now the Bible says that this young man he got more and more riches he got more and more popularity he got bigger and bigger and bigger in Fame His Image was so big Hallelujah but then the Bible says one day it says thy soul is required of thee and the Bible says he lifted up his eyes in hell I want you to look at it everybody all right he lifted up in his eyes in Hell keeping the Commandments he kept the Commandments for his day he didn't steal he didn't commit adultery he didn't bear false witness he honored his mother and father his response to Jesus was I've done these things from my youth Hallelujah but keeping the Commandments still couldn't stop him from being in hell and I'll take it a step further Hallelujah the Bible says when Jesus looked at him and he walked away the Bible says Jesus loved him even the love of God couldn't stop him from going to hell it could but he made his decision not to let it that's what the grace of God was all about Hallelujah the prophet of God say God put barricades in our way and we climb over the barricades God put road blocks in our way we bust through the roadblocks he says nobody God don't want nobody to go to hell he said but we choose it because of our own desires because of the things that's in our life beneath the surface and now in Hell everybody all right now in hell what was beneath the surface Hallelujah the real mystery of who he was starts to come come alive now he's in hell and he says hey let me go back and warn my brothers now he's an [Music] evangelist the gift has come alive in Hell let me go warn my brothers that they don't go the path I go don't that sound like a disciple so one way another you going to recognize what you rejected or what you left behind that's right but the key is we don't want it to come alive in Hell amen I'd rather Hallelujah let God use me on this side and the young man start to cry out he's in torment and all these things and he says hey let me go warn my brothers so they don't go down the same path and then the angel H Abraham or or the one that was talking to me say no they got Moses and the prophets just like you got I'm not going to allow you to go warn them they have to make a choice just like you and then he says I know I know how they are they're not going to listen to nobody else but they'll listen to me it was too late so let me say this I hope you're not following your unsaved siblings I hope you're not following that older brother that older sister that you love and respect back if their life is not right don't you let that love for them Hallelujah allow you to follow them to Hell stand your ground and say I want to be a Christian before I close beneath the surface I know a brother Hallelujah who was an only child he was like a miracle baby and his mom and dad couldn't have children and one day they had a child and they were just ecstatic and they spoiled us they they spoiled Us boy riding give him whatever he want you know a child that spoil they know they spoil they ain't putting on they just they looking at you they say you know I'mma get what I want and if I got to act the fool I'mma get it cuz I'm spoil and you made me that way that's why when you see kids in the store were like no Billy you can't have that today is a new day because in my day if you wanted to show people how small you was the parents in my day wanted to show how fast you can get a whipping in the mall in the grocery store in church wherever you went Hallelujah the government did dictate hallelujah how we raise our kids and you know we have all the stuff now where they say a child can choose for himself Hallelujah back in my day my mama say it's whatever I say and you fight against this and see what happened my mama my mama's first name is Lora so our first initial is a z y'all remember that old show zaro that's what she was like with that belt you can hear it in your head when it's coming it'll make you [Music] say you knew not to play with her because she had a certain Authority Hallelujah and if I could if I could take you into the rim of how I was raised Hallelujah she was we talking about beneath the surface now above the surface she was just as sweet and kind as could be but when you get out of line you get out of line mama was rough they say boy you we just love your mama boy we love Miss Z I'll be like you ever got one of them beating and then you be in the room I hope she get hit by a bu this is a youth meeting I'm being honest Hallelujah y'all y'all might as well be honest Hallelujah you've had those kind of thoughts I know y'all had those kind of thoughts about brother Randy I know you did Hallelujah you with me Nathaniel Hallelujah but Hallelujah it was those kind of parents that help us turn out the way we supposed to be because they realized there was something going on beneath the surface Hallelujah and my mom used to go to work she she worked at a nuclear plant and she used to come home with a gun a night stick a can of Mace and handcuffs and what she would do she would take her thief from target practice that she put all them holes in the head and holes in the heart and take it and put it on the laundry door so we all have to see [Music] it so you could be thinking whatever you want to think up here but underneath the surface All you thought about was bullets mace night stick now I say this I'll be honest now I never thought my mom would beat me with a night stick or spray me with ma although she said one time if you try me I'll spray you with this mace and I go to work on you boy now I know there some of y'all that's abuse hallelujah amen and no get me wrong I've reminded her of that you can ask my daughter I tell her to this day boy you better be glad we a grew up in this day you'll be in jail but it took those kinds of things Hallelujah because we were going against so many other things beneath the surface so we had to have a line a level of respect now I didn't believe that she would hit me with the gun or hit me with the night stick spray me with maze put handcuffs on me but I wasn't willing to try either H cuz there was a reverence for the life Hallelujah and then can you imagine seeing all that and then seeing that woman get saved hallelujah oh my when she would once come in with the force now she comes in with great he says okay son don't don't do that again I be like huh we ain't get no what this what Mercy look like I think I like this kind of God but then God start to deal God start to do things beneath the surface and she start to change on top Hallelujah to where it all begin to draw all of us in because we knew who she was without the Holy Spirit Hallelujah and when the Holy Spirit came in her life from the inside out started to change and when God deals with you beneath the surface your life from the inside out will change Hallelujah there too often we put on a good show for the outside and on the inside you're still dirty don't get nervous I'm about to close but this young man Hallelujah even though he knew he wasn't where he was supposed to be and God showed him his error he still wasn't willing to give it up I hope we young people we don't fall in that category tonight some of us got struggles some of us got things in our life some of us have even had an experience with God but we're stagnated we're not going any further than just a good church service Hallelujah God wants a complete and total surrender and that's what he got with David Hallelujah with David all his false all his failures all his mistakes he still had a complete surrender Hallelujah where he can look at wrongs and he wouldn't make Hallelujah he wouldn't make it somebody else's problem he would go to God and say Lord I have sinned that was the difference between David and Saul David would hold himself accountable H David could self-reflect Saul would not self-reflect David would say God I did does God I did that I'm so sorry s would say it was the people you gave me it's my mama I look like this because of my mama I don't have a job and I'm lazy because I didn't have no father in my life always blaming it on somebody else no hold yourself [Applause] accountable because beneath the surface I'm going to get into the just of my message tonight always beneath the surface there's always more if we go out to a virgin area that hasn't been cultivated there's a lot of things going on in that area beneath the surface although the grass might be green and pretty there's all kind of animals out there in that grass there's worms out there there's bugs out there beetles out there moldes out there all kind of stuff stuff that are out there in that uncultivated land beneath the surface on the top you you can imagine say man I could build a nice house out here but the only way to build that house you got to deal with the land Hallelujah and first of all you got to do you got to dig it up Hallelujah you got to dig it up and make it fit to build on hallelujah amen cuz nobody wants to build a house on top of a snake pit Hallelujah nobody wants to build a house surrounded by hornest nests amen so what do you do you cultivate the land and some areas you have to tear down things and pull out Hallelujah and what God does sometimes he allows storms to come to shake loose things that are already loose in your life Hallelujah to break off branches that are not producing Hallelujah so that tree Hallelujah could be cultivated so that tree could be pruned amen so it could push out some new life so what God would allow trials and tribulation as young people just to get the best you to come out but if you look beneath the surface you know the prophet preach the message broken system Hallelujah he says the water falls off the roof and in that system Hallelujah he said in that man-made system there are bugs in that system but there's something eating the bugs frogs may be eating the bugs but then there's something eating the frogs snakes may be eating the frogs and then there's a cycle of Filth in that system Hallelujah a life that continues to live but not only live it's getting bigger and bigger more bugs more frogs more snakes all of that is in that system Hallelujah and if you don't deal with the things that are beneath the surface in your life it's just going to invite more spirits and before you know it your land is contaminated but at the same time Hallelujah if you go to a gold mind the atmosphere in that mind is sometimes muggy it's dark it has a certain feeling about it gloomy but as they begin to work in that mind and they begin to dig and dig because somebody know there's gold in there so they have to push through all the darkness they to push through all that muggy atmosphere that's to push through nobody else wanting to go in there and they push through and push through just to come out with gold Hallelujah and I want to say tonight that some of you are gold and you got to push through see I got myself on a timer Hallelujah I was in South I was in South Africa preaching I had my larm set and the service was so powerful we were so caught up in God and I was preaching and running around and and then I wondered after service why my alarm didn't go off and I was talking to brother Bry brother Bryan I had my alarm said I didn't tend to go on at lawence I don't know what happened he said I saw it ringing and I cut it off sneaky preacher I'm down here preaching he on the pull pit looking at my phone and stops IT and keeps like Amen brother [Applause] preach as I prepare the close ask yourself what's going on with you beneath the surface come come come musicians brother Kenny y'all come come musicians come beneath the surface God can either be dealing with you or the enemy can be suppressing how God wants to deal with you how by the things you have in secret by the things you haven't confessed Hallelujah by the things you are afraid of like I said this morning the greatest problem we have in the church is people living by fear young people living by fear they're afraid you know I can't get saved CU I won't have no more friends that's a lie it's not until you get saved the real friends come in your [Music] life cuz the people in the world They Don't Love You they want what they can get out of you they want to use you up but a real friend will go to church with you and pray with you and talk about the things of God and encourage you encourage you to lay before God and say hey get that right don't worry I'll be praying with you that's what real friends do and if you don't have those kind of people in your life you don't have friends Hallelujah real friends will encourage you to spend time with God real friends Hallelujah would say to you let's go to church and experience more of God real friends will say let's read your Bible let's study what is God dealing with you on that's what real friends will do real friends will support you when you're down but when you don't know who somebody is beneath the surface they can flip on you at any moment now you ask yourself tonight what's going on beneath that nice beautiful posterior your nice long hair your pretty dress your nice shoes all the nice dresses you've ordered from sheen come on Brothers y'all lost how you going to get a wife you don't even know where shop at all the nice stuff you've ordered and you put it on and you just good and you're going to church but then you got depression beneath the surface you got on your right shoes and you got your little necklace on and all these things your hair is curled and and you got clear gloth on your nails but on the inside you're not happy all of that is just a mirage who are you right now while God is calling because we all know right now in this moment if we have eternal life or not you know if your eyes closed right now whether you're going to heaven or you're going to be stuck in the tribul ation if God will have mercy on you to make it to Heaven why take that chance I've been there I've been there going to church and not where I supposed to be in Christ and Mama spent too long at church and I'm thinking oh my God I'm in Tribulation I'm lost she ain't got home yet she's normally here by 9:30 it's 10:00 and she still ain't here it's 10:30 she still ain't here now I'm afraid you know why I'm afraid cuz I really believe what she's been teaching and I'm not making any of you unbelievers but what I'm saying is why play with God because we don't know what's going to happen when we leave out of here why play with God why try to hide these things
