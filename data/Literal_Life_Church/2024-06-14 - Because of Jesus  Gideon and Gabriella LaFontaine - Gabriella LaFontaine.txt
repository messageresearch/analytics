Because of Jesus

Lyrics:
Verse 1
You made a covenant with me
Signed by the blood that still speaks
Now I'm forgiven, I'm called righteous, I'm made clean
There on the cross at Calvary
You gave it all to purchase me
You are the Savior and the God who set me free

Chorus
Now my heart cries, "This is my Redeemer"
With my whole life I will give You praise
All the glory to the One who's worthy
Because of Jesus, I have been changed

Verse 2
You made a way for me to enter
Into Your holy placе forever
And now I'm hidden, I am covеred, I found peace, yes
Into your likeness You transform me
Making me holy, like You're holy
No longer I who live, but Christ Who lives in me

Bridge
You bring freedom to the captives
Good news to the poor
Healing to the broken
And joy to those who mourn
You turn ashes into beauty
The ruins You restore
I am a testimony
Of the goodness of the Lord
You bring freedom to the captives
Good news to the poor
Healing to the broken
And joy to those who mourn
You turn ashes into beauty
The ruins You restore
I am a testimony
Of the goodness of the Lord


Written by Charity Gayle, Ryan Kennedy, Hannah Musso, 
Steven Musso, and Magen Thurman
