somebody and uh we'll have them get bless us with a song this morning and uh we're looking forward to that just want to remind you that Wednesday night service is canceled for the holiday with your families so we'll cancel this Wednesday night and we resume our service next Sunday 10:30 for Sunday school if you just remember that after the service today if you would all exit out this door instead of this one it'll make it easier to come around into the gym door for the potluck today and the meal um you know when you have those smells coming from the kitchen you know during service you know you have to be brief brother be brief I guess is what what it is but uh we got to get this food in here first right praise the Lord sure good to see you all after our trip that we took and we're just going to be um showing you some slides in a little while about that as well but we want to have some times for testimonies and Thanksgiving before this week come comes upon us it's not just a day to me but uh we want to just celebrate the whole week and begin the service today being thankful in our hearts praise the Lord all right God bless you today okay that's fine okay it's no problem [Music] 1 for each blessed day two every breath I take three for my family four all they mean to me five just to be alive six for the Earth and Sky anden for heaven and every good the gift that I have comes from God every day every hour there are blessings he says without or if I counted or a thousand I'm sure there would still be more to be thankful for amen it's good eight for the chance to grow nine heart and hands and soul 10 for the eyes to see all God has given me yes amen I could go on and on counting the whole day long I know he is with me for every good is that I have come from God yes every day every hour there are blessings he said without or if I counted 100 or a thousand I'm sure there would still be more to be thankful for there will still be more to be thankful for all right [Applause] amen praise the Lord if we count all those things there'd still be more to be thankful for thank you kids we appreciate it wonderful if you wouldn't mind standing we'll turn to James chapter 3 this morning and uh we'll have our testimonies and a couple more specials after I finished ministering a little bit going to share a little bit in the word of God uh first first and then we'll move on with the rest of the things today James chapter 3 if you turn with me have one scripture there and then over in Hebrews 13 as well James 3 and verse 1 my brethren be not many Masters knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation in other words um maybe you shouldn't want to be a teacher because teachers who have to stand in front of the people uh are under greater scrutiny sometimes so they have to watch what they say a little closer then he goes into a subject on the tongue for in many things we offend all If any man offend not in word the same as a perfect man and able also to Bridle the whole body behold we put bits in the horses mouths that we may that they may obey us and we turn about their whole body behold also the ships which though they be so great are driven of fierce winds yet are they turned about with a very small helm withs soever the governor listeth even so the tongue is a little member and boasteth great things behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth and the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity so is the tongue among our members that it defileth the whole body and Seth on fire the course of Nature and is set on fire of hell for every king of beast excuse me every kind of Beast and of birds and of serpents and of things in the sea is tamed and hath been tamed of mankind but the tongue can no man tame it is an unruly evil full of deadly poison and you guys think I'm a hard preacher James is pretty straight on your tongue therefore bless we God even the father and therewith curse we men with the same tongue bless God and curse men which are made after the similitude of God out of the same mouth proceed of blessing and cursing my brethren these things ought not so to be do a fountain send forth at the same place Sweet Water and bitter can a fig tree my brethren bear Olive bees berries either of Vine figs so can no Fountain both yield saltwater and fresh who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom Hebrews chap 13 and verse1 15 one verse there uh to catch and bring into the subject this morning for a little bit Hebrews chapter 13 and verse 15 Hebrews 13 and verse 15 says by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name it's a good Thanksgiving scripture the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name but to do good and to communicate forget not for with such sacrifices God is well pleased Heavenly Father we pray that you'll bless and anoint the word of God today we pray Lord that we when we come and make the sacrifice to come Lord we know that you never disappoint us when we sit and listen and have a listening ear to your word not only in our physical ears but in our hearts you never disappoint us father and I pray that you'll help us in our spiritual growth this morning and to be better Christians after we leave this place we commit it to you now in Jesus name amen God bless you may be seated a couple weeks ago we were introducing the subject of adoption and I won't be on that today but adoption of course is related to placing of sons and it's also Al related to the maturity of sons um where the Holy Ghost takes us in growth and Perfection and ultimately a Rapture is where the Holy Ghost takes us the Redemption of our body so adoption has to do with us being birthed by the Holy Ghost but it's not just being birthed by the Holy Ghost it's where the Holy Ghost will take you and some of the things I'm going to be preaching on not today but in the coming weeks is that where that growth that Holy Ghost is a growth so that that Holy Ghost will take you somewhere it'll take you to more growth it'll take you to more Perfection perfection in the Bible does not mean sinless Perfection Perfection means growth to maturity you are growing to adulthood as a Christian that's what adoption does that's what the Holy Ghost does it doesn't leave you a baby with immaturities it grows you to be a full mature son and daughter of God now if that's not happening and you have the Holy Ghost then you're stunting that growth you're holding up that growth you're stubborn or something because there's only one direction the Holy Ghost will take you and that's more growth in the word if you're saying no I ain't taking that part of the word then first of all I'd question your Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost always says Amen to the word but if it's being stunted then there's something wrong with you it's not God because the Holy Ghost is an adoption to take you to grow in the Lord more power more strength more overcoming and guess what more mature if we're staying babies spiritually there's something wrong and so it it it this became a theme to me in Holland when we were there in the conference in Holland uh maturity maturity became a theme and uh we believe that God is looking for more and more from Sons and Daughters of God that we are saved and it's a gift of Salvation God gives us the gift of Salvation he gives us the gift of the Holy Ghost they are free gifts can you say Amen you don't have to do any Works to attain that God gives it to you when you ask him but then after he gives you that then we want to grow to please the Lord more if we're doing anything to grieve him then we want to stop doing the things that grieve him and do more and more things that please the Lord is that okay with everybody and so now when we when when we become God's looking for more and more sunship or maturity and I believe that the word that we're under in the last days that God has blessed us with he has blessed us with an open book The Bible has become open to us the book of redemption has become open to us in Revelations 5 the lamb took the book and he took the seals off the book that means he has given us something that's not closed but it's open to us and now that we have been given that it says when he come with the open book it says when he was holding the book he hath made us Kings and Priests it's taking us somewhere the Holy Ghost is taking somewhere the the book being open the seals taken off of our Bibles it's taking the people somewhere thou Hast made us Kings and Priests he's making you something guess what both of those positions of Kings and Priests require maturity how terrible would it be to put a King in that's immature we're in trouble reminds me of some presidents that are getting in these days we're in trouble character is needed to serve in these positions as God moves Us in then positions us with the open book then character maturity is needed in these positions how do we get character how do we get maturity through our trials through what God takes us through that through our trials we stopped acting like babies and saying God I don't want any more trials I don't want to go through anything else I just want life to be cushiony put a cushion around me and when I bump and like that I got a cushion all around me and God says no I'm trying to grow you as a son I'm trying to child train you here I'm trying to discipline you so that you grow up and you can stand on your own can you say Amen said I'm going to be a defeat to the devil today I'm going to overcome I'm going to hold the power and authority within my hands but I'm going to hold it with maturity so now I'm into this because there's still way too many maturities that I see in the church and I don't mean just this church I mean within our ranks it's disappointing to see that the people with the open book the people with the book of the Redemption that can hear the glories of the word of God like no other people have ever heard it before and still see so many immaturities Among Us just so you think I'm uh you don't think that I'm preaching everybody else I'm disappointed with the immaturities I see in myself still there's still too much of me that's being manifested I don't I wouldn't ask you to raise your hand but I can say there's still way too much of me and not enough of him there's still way too many immaturities that I hit a certain thing and I should know how to act and I'm not acting and doing and I take Satan's bake to jump in on a or something like that or an argument and I say why did you do that again shut your mouth and be quiet so I'm still growing as a pastor and I want the High Calling of Christ in my life calvary's purchased the High Calling of Christ you can stay where you're at but I don't want to stay where I'm at I want to grow into a full mature Son of God God we got to move to a higher place we got to move to a higher calling and we want to a deeper walk with God how many would raise your hand and say I want a deeper walk with God I want a deeper walk and deeper doesn't mean deeper necessarily in the word it's a closer relationship with him it's a son that's in constant communion with him and it's a son when he hits a trial he acts like a grownup Son of God that I'm going to take this because I know this will be good for me Israel had a history of immaturities for 40 years in the wilderness uh the Bible says in Hebrews that God was not well pleased and God was grieved with an entire generation and so in 1 Corinthians 10 it gives some of these Grievances and it gives some of this stuff here's the people that were under the message in that day under Moses message here's how they were 1 Corinthians 10 and: 10 you guys can put it up if you want moreover Brethren I would not that you should be ignorant how that our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and the Sea and did all eat the same spiritual meat and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that was followed them and that rock was Christ but with many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness now these things were our examples to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted neither be idolators as were some of them as it is written the people sat down and to eat and drink and Rose up to play neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three and three we're we're reading the history of message Believers and the Bible doesn't hide anything amen lot of you have lot of you have trouble saying amen this is the history of 40 years of God's people under a prophet and you got idolatry you got fornication uh let's read a little further neither let us tempt Christ as some of them tempted and were destroyed as serpents how did they tempt the Lord they were saying is the Lord among us or not they were questioning whether the Lord was even among them even though he opened up the Red Sea even though he gave them Mana when they were hungry even though they gave them a spiritual Rock when they were thirsty he did Miracle after miracle and they still come up to tempt the Lord saying but really is the Lord really among us or not tempting the Lord immaturity do you say that when you hit a trial that you don't think was fair to you is God really in my life or not why is God doing this why is God allowing this it's immaturity because whatever God allows in my life is going to be for my good what a history verse 10 neither murmur ye as some also murmured I know nobody ever does that here or in the message neither murmur ye as some of them murmured and were destroyed of the Destroyer now all these things happen for our examples and they're written for our admonition that's a slight rebuke upon whom the ends of the world are come wherefore let him that thinketh he stand take heed lest he fall that's a message to message Believers that are under profit when you think you stand take heed lest you fall by these things because you're not strong within yourself you're only strong when you let the Holy Ghost take over your life can I get a further amen You're Not Strong you will fall to the same things and the same immaturities unless you let the Holy Ghost take over your life so all of this history of Israel under the prophet's message it's not good they're gossiping in their tents they're murmuring they're complaining against Moses they're backbiting they're they're uh disrespectful to God's Prophet they're allowed to say anything against God's prophet and get by with it and so they're babies in the wilderness under God's Prophet babies in the wilderness under God's prophet and so I'll just give you two examples I could go into many of them and we went into this a little bit in Holland so this is a little bit of a repeat but there's two examples one in the Old Testament one in the New Testament and both of these people were under the ministry of the son of man one in the Old Testament one in the New Testament they had seen Mighty things that God had done they had watch the son of man in action discern Hearts do all of that do Miracles that that that are amazing amazing and they watched it all under the son of man prophetic Ministry and yet we see a lot of immaturities in their life one example is that when and that's mentioned here in the scripture that I read here in 1 Corinthians 10 it talks about them uh they come across the sea they come across the Red Sea so now I was reading a few weeks ago would you get with me Psalms 106 I was reading this in my devotion and Psalms 106 it's a couple weeks ago I was reading this in my a morning devotion or evening whichever one if I don't make it in the morning I do the evening devotion if I don't wake up early enough or I got to get going I try to be faithful with that but if I don't catch it in the morning I do it in the evening so it was either the morning or the evening that I read psalms 106 would you read it with me and here in 106 gives the entire history of Israel a lot of the things I just read and David is being very repentant saying look what our fathers did look what the you know look at the some of the things that they did but right in the middle of this God gives what he did verse n he rebuked the Red Sea I mean Psalms 106 ver9 he rebuked the Red Sea also and it was dried up so he led them through the depths as through the Wilderness and he saved them from the hand of him that hated them and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy they stood there and watched all of Pharaoh's Army be drowned in the Red Sea they walked across on dry land on the Red Sea quite a miracle and the waters covered their enemies that there was not one of them left not one enemy left how many believe that God's powerful enough to put all your enemies in the Red Sea all your abits all your addictions pornography what it whatever it is he's able to drown all of it in the Red Sea verse 12 then then believe they his words and they sang his praise so I thought well praise the Lord and I've heard so many sermons The Last Five Years on this part of the children of Israel where Mariam sees the Red Sea and all the enemy there and Mariam picks up the tambourine do I have a a tambourine here or they always hide them from me cuz they don't think I can play it you have are you sister Mariam Viola Viola that's that's good enough that's close enough I hear so many sermons and I love to hear it because listen when God drowns your troubles in the Red Sea and your enemy you're going to be happy about it you're going to shout about it you're going to Rejoice about it and that's what they did they said they believe because they weren't believing for the all the years before all the Miracles they weren't really believing but now this happens and they're believing and they're praising God Mariam gets her tambourine and all the El daughters grab their tambourines and she had the whole church all revived as they watched all the bones and all the the uh the the Pharaoh's Army bobbing up and down in the Red Sea Mary says let's worship together come on everybody I will will sing unto the Lord for he has triumphed gloriously the horse and the rider get thrown into the sea I will sing unto the Lord for he has triumphed gloriously the horse of the rider get thrown into the sea woo glory be to God see I can play it they don't think I can play it around here but I can they hide all the tambourines and you can play thank you appreciate it it was a time and I hear so many sermons on it but guess what I hear hardly any sermons of this people how they acted the other side of the Red Sea and how they were acting just three days later after they shouted and it says it in Psalms it says this believ they his words they sang his praise they soon forgot his Works they waited not for his counsil immaturity I tell you friends you can even enjoy the word today and celebrate and feel better when you leave but I don't care how you act in here you can shout you can dance and I I would love for some of you to do it sometimes but it's not what you act like in here it's what you act like in obedience to the when you leave these doors and they go back and they said but then they lusted exceedingly in the wilderness and tempted God in the wilderness he gave them the request but sent leanness to their soul they envied Moses it goes on and on so one little verse says they shouted but before the Red Sea they were complaining they were saying we're stuck you brought us out here's our Pharaoh's Army coming what are we going to do and even Moses the prophet is complaining in crying unto the Lord what are we going to do and that's why that adoption message came I call this an adoption message Wesley wrote a song about it Sayang it Wednesday night an adoption message is why Christ speak unto me an adoption message of the other brand was why Christ speak and also uh Paradox those are adoption messages where where Joshua said he didn't even have a word on it he didn't have the scripture on it son stands still for a day so we can finish this off that's adoption message that's a son in his position with power can you say amen and Moses is complaining and God says why are you crying I've given you commission I've said you're going to make it you're going over I don't care if a red sea is there I don't care if the Mediterranean see is after that I don't care if the Atlantic ghost is after that I have commissioned you you're going to make it you're going to overcome why are you crying because of immaturity grow up as a Son of God stop crying and speak and go forward and Moses said all right he stood up into his position and he says raised his hands and most you watch the movie and everything else God opens up by his command opens up the Red Sea but that's how they were acting before this side of the Red Sea then they get done and read just three one excuse me six verses later after they shouted with their tambourine they ran out of water and they begin to complain that they didn't have any water wow three days three days I believe it was three days now you can put this off in the Old Testament all you want to but this reflects the IM immaturities that come out of our Lives Many Times what do we talk about on Monday what do we talk about when we're depressed what do we talk about when we don't feel God around I don't feel God like I felt him on Sunday so now you start to say anything which is going to be my theme today for a very short time there's two main immaturities that I think were in Israel and that are in the church sometimes and that is there's a lot of immaturities and we could preach on all of them but I'm only going to emphasize two the one immaturity the two immaturities let your giving yourself permission to think any thought that you want to think at any time and second of all giving yourself permission to say anything you want at any time and news flash there's a lot of scriptures that does not give sons of God a permission to spill out anything out of these tongues that they want to say well I'm an American I have a right to say what I want to say it's free speech you're not an American you're a Christian you're a son of godl and sons of God in are a different Kingdom than Americans thank God we are and we do not give ourselves permission but this is Israel they gave their themselves permission especially in their tents in their homes to say anything they wanted to say to think anything they wanted to think and you've heard me preach about the Mind our thinking process growing in our thinking bringing every thought captive to the Lord every thought has to be scanned by the word of God and if it's not a thought of God you can't give yourself permission to think it whether it's depressing whether it's criticism to someone else whether it's a doubtful thought towards the word of God it should not be allowed in your thinking to go any further than one thought and it is got captive it the handcuffs are put on that thought and said you are not coming into my thought life you know why we give ourselves permission to do it because nobody sees our thought life and should I take an hour and preach on what you let and what you feed on influence your thought life social media movies you think the way you do because of what you feed on don't forget James is a harder preacher than me he's the one that says tongue is a poison it's an unruly evil your tongue is an unruly evil but I'm a mild preacher and I just say we should bring our tongues under subjection of the Lord 40 years was he grieved Hebrews says it they were babies until the time came under Joshua to grow up CU they couldn't go into the land themselves without the prophet until they come under the Holy Ghost Joshua to grow up and become men become women to take the land past all their immaturity past their unbelief growing out of it how many want to grow out of it and coming into a faith to take your land brother BR even referred to fighters in the wilderness that had to die off before the new generation could come in there was Fighters they were F it's interesting brother BR said called them fighters fighters they like to argue they like to fight they they're preachers that like to argue over the pulpit they like to slam other preachers over the pulpit they're old Fighters that have to die off because their Spirit they're manifesting is a fighting Spirit Against The Wrong Enemy we're not supposed to be fighting against one another we have an enemy to fight against why are you preaching against me telling me I'm not even preaching the message why are we fighting I pray that God would cause us to lose all of our fighting spirit and point our sword at the enemy an example in the New Testament is Luke 9 where Jesus has his adoption ceremony and and he's Peter James and John are invited and they're up there and Moses and Elijah appear here and so here they all are and uh they fall asleep first of all you know this is a pretty big event and uh Peter and James they fall asleep it's pretty big event it's Jesus adoption something's going to happen in the mountain and they were exclusively invited to this and the Bible says they were asleep so they had to be woke up and when they wake up they see Jesus face transfigured in front of them which means he's receiving the approval of God the father and the approval that this is my son I'm pleased to dwell in him there was a Radiance referring back to brother bradam and the vision that was in the church this wasn't related to the seals this was brother Roberson said I seen you in a dream and you came back I was calling you back cuz you you was at a table with us feasting you went out to the West then I call said brother brand please come back he was screaming it come back when he came back he was sitting at the table again with him and he says I looked at you brother brandom and you were changed your countenance was changed if you study it that's not a change as far as doing more miracles in his life that was a change in his heart with a bad attitude towards the Ricky and the ricettas so the change was an internal change that God was dealing with all through while he's preaching the climax of a Ministry the pro the the the the seals it's going on the whole time he's going to leave the ministry he was going to leave and go go be a Trapper cuz he got fed up with people that he was preaching to still he says I preach against this I preach against the immodest clothing I come back it's it's worse the next year the rebellion of the people got to him and he got upset about it he said listen you know I'm through with this I'm just going to go to a mountain somewhere I'll sneak my wife up there and this will be it I'm done with the ministry in his heart this was going on all these months but God knew about it and God said said I'm going to deal with my son and brother REM said he said I need a little change in my life not that I'm a sinner but I need a little change that I need to love people more adopted son come to adoption you know so many sermons are the Big Chain the Rapture that's the big change and I'm looking forward to it but there's little changes needed in your spirit before the big change comes I can't wait for the big change I I want to go now I'm ready to hop right into the other dimension and go on a Rapture but until that happens God whatever little changes are needed me just a little more love maybe a lot more love to stop being a fighter and stop being has such a bad attitude and stop being a legalist stop with the critical spirit stop with the gossip stop with the backbiting stop with the immaturities let it all stop in my life so that I can grow and become the son that God says I'm pleased to dwell with and he said about Jesus he said this is my son who I'm pleased to dwell and he says they said you know what what Peter let's build through let's build Tabernacles here we need a memory of this let's be no no no no this is my son hear ye him but Moses is here Elijah is here we we need to build a denomination over this this is this is special yeah Peter it's special not to build a denomination on but it brings Sons to adoption that's what's special about this message it brings Sons to adoption some of you have made the message a dress code oh lord it's so much more than a dress code this that he sent us is bringing Sons to glory and there is no denominational system not the people there is no system with man's hands on the Bible that's going to bring Sons to adoption it will be because his word is revealed to his people in its fullness and now they grow into Sons with power and Sons with authority and Sons with character they're sleeping they want to build three Tabernacles then they come down out of the mountain and it's about just two days I think such an experience up there seeing Jesus transfigured and they had a little discussion amongst the disciples who's the greatest Among Us they just come from an adoption ceremony where they're supposed to come and they're they're arguing amongst one another who's the greatest among all the disciples have you guys ever thought about we haven't really decided who takes go over after he's gone you know why I say this because we have way too much of that in the body of Christ who's the greatest preacher who's the next upand cominging Church who's the big Lord Jesus may we please not participate in all of this immaturity that's right I would preach the same this morning if there were 10 people here Church goes up and down people come and go I don't have my mind on numbers I don't have my mind on being acceptable to the rest of the message I'm here to preach to my local congregation and to get me and us into a Rapture I'm serious I'm not saying that have a false humility I don't care where my name goes around the world I don't even want it I want to make myself a no reputation I just want to be a part of the body of Christ I want to enjoy your fellowship and I want to grow to become Sons and Daughters of God and make this Rapture that's what it is that's what I'm here for it's just that simple and to compete amongst the ministers who's the next convention speaker and who's the guy that I have to have my hands laid on and prayed for I'm telling your friends you know you don't have to go to a convention to have a certain brother lay hands on you just ask the sister next to you to lay hands on you cuz she has just as much Holy Ghost as that preacher amen have the brother next to you lay hands on you praise the Lord that's right brother Joe it's a body Ministry it's not a oneman Ministry it's a body Ministry so the last thing that happened boy okay I have to be mindful here we're smelling the food it's drifting from the kitchen we should have put that kitchen way out there Brandon out the other side of the building then they get done arguing and so you know what happens is is that Jesus answered their he come up to their discussion about who's the greatest among them and he he said let me tell you who's the greatest Among Us you come here a minute are you too shy okay thank you you're too shy ah boy these kids watch me scream up here and they're scared to death of me would you come up here a minute even my own granddaughter is scared of me anyway if you can Envision he takes a little child sets him in front of the disciples and he says big preachers this is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven if you get your heart like this child in this s because we're to be children in our hearts as far as our response to God adults as far as our power With the Enemy but this is how you receive and this is the greatest in the kingdom and then then just a few hours later Jesus said go into that Village and prepare for the Passover go into that and it was in the Samaritans they go in and they say we won't receive you you can't do it here okay you're Jews we're Samaritans you can't set it up here and you know what they did Jesus come in and said John said these guys must not know that we're in the message these guys don't know that we have the son of man here we have the son of man these guys don't know who we are and they have disrespected you Lord and they have not received us they have shut the doors to us John said would to God that we call fire down from heaven like Elijah did and just consume the whole Community that's right some immaturities there that's an understatement the a guy's following the son of man right next to him every day and somehow gets in this thing is that let's call on the same power of Elijah we must have it let's call fire down and blow the whole thing up just because they wouldn't receive us I tell you friends there's a lot more to be said about this but we better ask the Holy Spirit to burn out our bad attitudes in the message you may have truth but you better have character with your truth you may have truth but you better not use that sword on other people you may have truth but I can tell you unbelievers pick up on if it's Pride with your truth and it's not attractive for them to see religious Pride with the truth that you have we don't have a monopoly on truth you don't personally can you say Amen in the mess we God is a god of Truth and I want to remind you that brother Bram says God is interested in every human being not just those that go to message churches God is interested in every human being on the face of the Earth if he had that attitude why don't we have that attitude why are we exclusive why do we get it say if they won't receive me they weren't they went out from us because they weren't of us they're serpent seed you don't have a right to call somebody serpent seed you don't know who they are only God has his categories of people he has his bride brother rat brought the four different parts of the book of redemption the four the The Book of Life and there is other ones in there there's ones that receive salvation at Judgment Day based on their works there's different categories but God set up those categories I don't know who they are and as far as I'm concerned we should talk to every person as if they're a potential elect of [Applause] God Jesus responded and said John and James you don't even know what Spirit you're of right now and that wasn't the end of the rebuke you don't even know what Spirit you got on you let me tell you this you need to know something this son of man Ministry did not come to destroy men's lives it came to save men's lives are we under the son of man today yeah if you know your Bible and you know what this message we're under the ministry of the son of man and it's not about William Bram it's the son of man a son of man revealed the son of man there's only one the son of man it's Jesus Christ not William brandham but he was a son of man a prophet to point us to the son of man and that son of man is here among us today and if we're under the son of man Ministry let me say the same words as Jesus he did not give it to us to destroy men's lives he gave it to you to save men's lives praise the Lord we'll get to some of this again next Sunday so the rest of this when Sons begin to bring their lives every part so you see the immaturities in the Old Testament New Testament people under the son of man so we see then in the same thing it could happen with us but God's calling us to adoption positioning Sons mature it can you say Amen mainly our tongues and our thought life it is immaturity to continue to give ourselves permission to say anything we want to say or think anything we want to think you know the first battle that they had in the promised land Jericho it's interesting because this is another thing you have sermons on all the time is they shouted and the walls of Jericho came down that's exactly right but they shouted on the seventh day right and it was the shout that brought the walls of Jericho down no it wasn't just the shout heard a preacher say it the other day it was the shout that brings the walls of Jericho down no no did you forget that for the six days before the seventh they said everyone open not your mouth shut up Modern leontine Standard revised version for six days everybody shut up don't say nothing that was to me just as much a miracle I'm just saying six days you shutting up not saying anything that was just as much of a miracle as the big walls of Jericho coming down if I could have people and myself for six days do that I would be shouting it would be a miracle but he's saying shout up there's something in the training of sons in the promised land to get the perfect battle and Jericho was the perfect battle and that is shut your mouth and stop letting your tongue spill things that's not right let it be the fruit of Thanksgiving upon your lips let it be positive let it be the right thing let it say let it say God you're going to bring us through brother Bram that ain't nothing but the truth Let It Be Words of Life let it not be cursing one another and cursing other people and cursing denominational people get rid of the cursing let it be blessing nobody's going to get their tongues out control in this world nobody presidents politics they're lying through their lips all the time but somebody's got to get their tongue under the Holy Ghost and shut up and quit saying things that's demeaning to about other people quit being critical against the ministry quit being critical against your brother and sister say a blessing I said I spoke a few weeks ago say bless those that curse you they cursed you God I'm going to pray prayer I'm going to ask you to bless their lives bless them Lord the one who cursed me bless bless them Prosper them that's not a denominational teaching from a system that's sons of God teaching it's a miracle it was a miracle that happened and it wasn't just to shout because after six days of being quiet I guess they were ready to shout so all of you this week from Monday through Saturday shut your mouths don't say nothing unless it's edifying I just come up with that just now it's just a brand new idea six days don't say nothing out of these lips unless it's edifying and it's the fruits of Thanksgiving and gratefulness for what God has done and I'm just asking you what kind of service would we have next Sunday when you got a chance finally to open your mouth the Thanksgiving challenge that's even for uncle so- and so to shut his mouth at Thanksgiving dinner he ain't going to do it he says too much but we eat turkey with him anyway because we love him anyway James does not hold back letting us know the damage that the tongue can do can you say Amen the effects of it the perfect perfect man is not sinless Perfection but he is on his way and he's he's well on his way to Growing Up when his tongue is bridled by the Holy Ghost the same as a perfect man he may have SI weaknesses in other areas but he brings that ton under control the rest of the body will come come under control bridled by the Holy Ghost the tongue the Bible says how shall we be living how shall we be living and I'm wrapping this up now how shall we be living every day bringing the sacrifice of praise and the fruit of Thanksgiving upon our lips how shall Sons and Daughters be living every day this is what our tongue should be used for all the time you know Thanksgiving is not just a SE a season it's not just a day Thanksgiving to a Christian is a lifestyle when he says bring the sacrifice and praise it doesn't mean just when you come to church when he says bring the Thanksgiving to God upon your lips and that's the fruit of your lips it doesn't mean in church it doesn't mean just it means it's a lifestyle it's not a season it's a lifestyle Thanksgiving is not a day to Christians whoever is listening online the broadcast Thanksgiving is not just a day that for sports and for your turkey and all that to a Christian Thanksgiving is a lifestyle that it comes out of his lips I am so grateful to God and whatever I'm going through that same God will bring me through it you might say that a sign of mature Sons is a grateful heart and a grateful confession that's the contrast to immature Israel who were not grateful for all the works that God has done who showed their lack of thankfulness for what he had done by their murmuring and complaining constantly they were ungrateful children in the Old Testament for 40 years when you're wanting to grow into this then you might need to hang around people also who don't have negative complaining sarcastic ways about them there are people that you hang around that are sarcastic that they put down they belittle with their words and it's very comfortable for them to do that as I was talking to my son Solon saying they're just are people that are they're so used to drama and they're so used to negative talk and they're so used to gossip they feel uncomfortable when they're around an atmosphere that doesn't allow for gossip and we should make them feel that way may our church be always a place that people who want to have a norm of Gossip would feel uncomfortable will you join with me had a brother had a sister say I'm so glad to be out of that certain area and of course I wouldn't mention the area but there's just such gossip going on between the churches she said I'm just glad to be out of that atmosphere and away from that may we always be an assembly that holds to that that what comes out of our lips is for edification even a correction which I do it over the pulpit I've corrected some today I'm sure that I have but let it be done in love and let it be to edify your life correction can edify if it's done in the right Spirit but don't hang around people who are negative all the time complaining sarcastic beling words may we grow that Beyond Petty things let's be a church where gossipers are uncomfortable that it just don't work here there's too many good things to talk about and thank God for than to talk about the negative can we get an agreement that there's too many good things to talk about there's too much to do for the kingdom of God a lot of times the gospel ain't doing very much to the kingdom of God that's their job that's their position is to be a gossiper and to tear down what's taking place but there's too many good things to do for the kingdom get busy doing something for the kingdom of God instead of spending our times the fruit of our lips and Thanksgiving when it says a sacrifice of praise it's true in the Old Testament they had some they had a peace offering okay I don't have time for this but they had five offerings one was a peace offering and under the peace offering was actually a sacrifice of Thanksgiving you look it up look it up in your Bible so it's specific and then Paul brings it up in the New Testament bring the sacrifice of praise can you say Amen oh I loved it Wednesday night when brother Gideon said all of those blood of bulls and goats and all those sacrifices it didn't finish it they had to keep coming back to it all the time it didn't finish it but we have a sacrifice where he said it is finished glory be to God the work has been done that's why we can have the sacrifice of Thanksgiving the work has been done that's why we can be a happy people can I get your amen this morning that's why we can be happy it's a finished work at Calvary you can't add anything to it but we bring this sacrifice of praise because it is hard it's it's hard to bring the sacrifice of praise and lips of Thanksgiving when things are going hard that's why it's a sacrifice because it's hard to do it doing it when it don't come natural doing it during the bad times it seems to become more natural for us to complain and be negative and curse it comes more natural but when we let our words be bridled to only speak right things that is a sacrifice and that's why I said bring the sacrifice of praise you can relate it to church when you come and you don't feel like coming to church you're tired you're worn out um the kids have been screaming the whole way in the car you don't feel very spiritual to come in and give the praise but that's when it's the sacrifice of praise I don't care what I feel right now I'm bringing it to the Lord and and Paul said Peter said here with such sacrifices good communication good words with such sacrifices God is well pleased that's that's adoption that God is pleased with his sons that's adoption Thanksgiving is not a you know there's only two things in the Old Testament that we bring we have the ultimate sacrifice but there's only places two places where it's says what we bring we present our bodies a Living Sacrifice we don't die he died for us but we present our bodies a Living Sacrifice and we bring the sacrifice of praise continually it's not a season it's a lifestyle it's not a day it's not a turkey it's a lifestyle of a Believer maturing the tongue is used to brag on Jesus Christ can I get an amen the tongue is used for one thing that's to brag on Jesus Christ and bring Glory unto his name so so I'd like to read the Thanksgiving story this will be a short one for the children I hope you're listening I hope everybody's listening you know why they came over right to receive religious freedom to worship the Lord according to the dictates over their heart they come all the way over from Europe because they wanted to be able to worship God freely but it was a hard time in September 1620 a small ship called the mayflower left Plymouth England carrying 1002 passengers that's it that's actually about probably what we got here today and an assortment of religious separatists seeking a new home where they could freely practice their faith and other individuals lured by the promise of prosperity and land ownership in the new world after a treacherous and uncomfortable Crossing that lasted 66 days they dropped anchor near the tip of Cape C far north of their intended destination at the mouth of the Hudson R River one month later the Mayflower crossed Massachusetts bay where the pilgrims as they are now commonly known begin to the work of establishing of Village at Plymouth throughout that Brut first brutal winter most of the colonists remained on board the ship where they suffered from exposure scurvy and outbreaks of contagious disease also they had hardly any food only half of the mayflower's original passengers and crew lived to see their first New England spring so you got 102 half of them are gone it's pretty discouraging not much to be thankful for it seemed but God was watching over his people God had it in his mind to start a new nation you don't think God was in that it was in his plan and so after these hardships then losing half the people starving I just want to say to the kids today and all of us we're going to eat pretty good in a little bit here in about half hour we're not going to have a lack you didn't starve this week you didn't have a lack of food in your home if you did let me know I can help you out we're not lacking in this country still not at all right we're abundantly blessed but the Trap is is that when you're abundantly bless you do like Israel you forget to be grateful for the food that we have you forget to be thankful for the body of Christ I think we should be grateful that we have a place to come and if you're grateful for it you'll come I think we should be thankful that we still have preachers that'll tell us like it is amen I think we should be and when we lose our grateful forness gratefulness for that then we lose a lot because then we realize when we go out we realize that the food isn't quite there to feed our souls and so we have to be grateful in our hearts for the things and only half of the Mayflower original passengers and crew lived to see their first spring in March the remaining settlers moved to sh where they received an astonishing visit from a member of the H I'm not going to pronounce these Indian tribes correctly uh but the abanaki tribe who greeted them in English several days later he returned with another Native American Squanto a member of the how do you say it rap Paul tux it what really I get an A for that PA tux tribe who had been kidnapped by the English sea captain and sold into slavery before escaping London and returned to his homeland as an exploratory Expedition Squanto taught the pilgrims weaken by malnutrition and illness how to cultivate corn extract sap from the maple tree apple maple trees catch fish in the rivers and avoid poisonous plants he also helped the settlers Forge an alliance with the another a a local tribe which endured more than 50 years and remains one of the sole examples of Harmony between European colonists and Native Americans in November 1621 in the fall then after the Pilgrim's first Corn Harvest proved successful Governor William Bradford organized A celebratory feast and invited a group of fledging colonies Native American Allies in all the different including the and chief massoit now remember as America's first Thanksgiving although the pilgrims theel may not have used this term at the time the festival lasted for 3 days I would love for this Festival this week to last every day for a whole week can anybody stay my kids will tell you I will not let them put up any lights or nothing for Christmas until after Thanksgiving because I think the greatest American holiday the true Christian holiday gets smothered over over by the Heathen one that being said next Friday after Thanksgiving we will be putting up a few lights just let it out there let the whole message know no Santas but we're going to have some lights and some things and more food hopefully it wasn't called Thanksgiving then kids it was just called a day to thank the Lord because guess what when you've gone through times where you didn't have food you didn't have a lot of money and half of your people died in front of you that makes you thankful that I had a better year this year I've got a little change I'm I'm not hungry I've got food it made them so grateful that they had food they said let's have a celebration and let's have the fruit of Thanksgiving to the Lord upon our lips and tell him how much we thank him for there are times friends we need to do it right now we need to tell the Lord how much he's done for us we need to tell the Lord and I'm going to have them I have a few thanks to things I have some slides coming up here just few of them of the trip but I think we should close our eyes and speak to the Lord right now and thank him for the things that we never thank him for Why Don't We Stand and I'll have you sit again after but let's stand thanks thanks I give you thanks for all youve done I am so blessed my soul is found rest oh Lord I give you thanks one more time AC capella thanks thanks I give you thanks for all you done I am so blessed my soul has found rest oh Lord I give you thanks Lord we thank you we
