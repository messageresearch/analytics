[0:00] just a quick reminder that this Sunday
[0:02] is the Lord's Supper
[0:05] I think it's at four o'clock if I'm not
[0:07] mistaken
[0:09] four okay four o'clock on this Sunday so
[0:13] we'd love to partake with you if you're
[0:16] able to make it
[0:18] I was going to try to sing a song a
[0:20] couple songs have been on my heart all
[0:22] week and then I thought I'll just stick
[0:24] to my calling and maybe the Lord will
[0:26] put it on somebody else's heart
[0:30] uh brother Paul gave us a good report
[0:32] from camp today that the session he did
[0:35] went very well and a lot of the young
[0:37] people were very blessed by it so we
[0:39] were happy to hear that and
[0:41] and I was just thinking in the back they
[0:43] showed up not to make you nervous
[0:45] brother Josh they showed you on the
[0:47] camera just real brief but I was happy
[0:49] they did it was good to see you and
[0:52] um do you want to if I bring you a mic
[0:53] do you want to say anything or you're
[0:55] good to go no okay I won't put you on
[0:57] the spot then but it's it's good to see
[0:59] you we could just sit and look at you
[1:01] tonight if we
[1:02] if you'd let us
[1:05] healthy better than looking at me
[1:08] Hebrews 4 verse 14.
[1:12] seeing then that we have a great high
[1:13] priest that has passed into the heavens
[1:15] Jesus the son of God let us hold fast
[1:19] our profession
[1:21] for we have not an high priest which
[1:23] cannot be touched with the feeling of
[1:25] our infirmities
[1:27] but was on All Points tempted like as we
[1:30] are yet without sin
[1:32] let us therefore come boldly unto the
[1:35] throne of grace that we may obtain mercy
[1:37] and find Grace to help in time of need
[1:41] God bless you you can have your seats
[1:44] may the Lord bless his word tonight
[1:48] I had this on my heart one day some time
[1:51] ago and just this this part about a we
[1:55] have a high priest and
[1:58] um
[1:59] I can't remember what it was not long
[2:01] ago just taking something looking at it
[2:03] deeper there was there was more meaning
[2:05] to to it there than what I had ever
[2:08] realized I think it was Isaiah 53 when
[2:10] when you delve into it you know we
[2:12] always say Isaiah 53 he was wounded for
[2:15] our transgressions bruised running we
[2:16] either take one thing or the other he's
[2:19] either died for our sins or he died for
[2:21] our healing and we don't always run the
[2:23] two together
[2:25] in this particular set of scriptures I
[2:27] just got to thinking about one day and I
[2:29] thought for we have we have a high
[2:31] priest we know we have a high priest but
[2:34] it says that he can be touched with the
[2:37] feeling of our infirmities
[2:39] and then it says in all points he was
[2:42] tempted just like we're tempted
[2:44] so everything that we experience in
[2:47] Temptation on this life Jesus has to
[2:49] have felt that in some way when he was
[2:52] here on Earth he had to feel it in order
[2:55] to be a faithful high priest that can be
[2:58] touched when we have Temptation when we
[3:01] have sickness if he didn't experience
[3:03] that then we wouldn't have a high priest
[3:05] that could be touched that way he can he
[3:07] can enter in with us into what we're
[3:10] feeling into what we're going through in
[3:12] that time and
[3:13] so I looked up that word infirmity and
[3:15] and you know this particular set of
[3:18] scriptures I always apply and have
[3:21] always heard it apply to when we're sick
[3:23] well we have high priests that can be
[3:25] touched by the feeling of our
[3:26] infirmities let's pray for you and we
[3:27] pray for physical healing
[3:29] but and it does mean physical healing
[3:32] it's want of strength it's weakness it's
[3:34] an infirmity of the body it's it's a
[3:37] native weakness and Frailty it's
[3:39] feebleness of health or sickness but it
[3:42] also goes deeper into what Jesus
[3:44] experienced that we experienced in its
[3:47] feebleness and weakness of the Soul
[3:49] and it's one of strength and capacity to
[3:53] understand something it's one of
[3:55] strength and capacity to do great and
[3:57] glorious things it's want and strength
[4:01] of capacity to to restrain corrupt
[4:04] desires now look at that in in Jesus
[4:08] Christ the son of God had to have a
[4:11] strength he had to experience a strength
[4:13] that would restrain him from corrupt
[4:16] desires and if it restrained him from
[4:18] corrupt desires it means that Jesus had
[4:20] to feel corrupt desires can you say Amen
[4:24] it means to Bear trials and troubles
[4:28] now we know Jesus bore trials and
[4:30] troubles because it says he learned
[4:32] obedience by the things that he suffered
[4:34] but I just think that this takes our
[4:37] high priest to took it to a different
[4:39] level for me that it's not just I can't
[4:42] just turn to this scripture now and look
[4:44] at it as when I need healing but when
[4:46] I'm feeling tempted I can look to the
[4:48] scripture and I can reach out to the
[4:51] Lord Jesus Christ and say father I'm
[4:53] feeling tempted right now I need your
[4:55] help and Jesus knows exactly what that
[4:58] is and he knows just exactly how to
[5:00] minister to you in that time if you'll
[5:03] let him
[5:05] I printed my notes off tonight because
[5:07] the battery on my iPad was dying really
[5:09] really fast and I don't know why
[5:11] and I thought I'm not ignorant of
[5:13] Satan's devices so I printed my notes
[5:18] that word means it's it's a feebleness
[5:21] of body or of mind
[5:23] it's implica it's implication a disease
[5:26] or a disorder but it also implies moral
[5:29] Frailty
[5:31] and and these things I just want to want
[5:33] us to take them to heart tonight that
[5:35] it's it's something greater it's it's
[5:37] when when we look in Hebrews just before
[5:40] Paul writes these things down that we
[5:42] just read tonight he's talking about
[5:45] arrest and arrest in the Holy Ghost and
[5:47] what that is and Jesus gave us God gave
[5:50] us a Sabbath and then he says but Jesus
[5:52] was Lord of the Sabbath it's something
[5:55] greater than what the Jews at the time
[5:57] were trying to hold a tradition of of
[5:59] arrest and Paul's saying you missed
[6:02] you're missing it
[6:03] it's no longer a day but it's it's it's
[6:07] the Holy Ghost rest that we get
[6:10] it's it's the overcoming prevailing
[6:12] power over the infirmities of the flesh
[6:16] amen it speaks of the Simplicity of
[6:19] Salvation in Jesus Christ by his grace
[6:22] now I want to turn to chapter 10 real
[6:25] quick and
[6:27] I'm going to try not to read a lot
[6:29] tonight but I have a lot to read so bear
[6:32] with me
[6:33] um stand up if you have to
[6:36] I I won't call you out unless you start
[6:38] coming towards the front
[6:41] Hebrews 10 10
[6:43] . and I just want to read a couple
[6:44] verses because this this was just so
[6:46] beautiful it says by the witch
[6:48] uh will we are Sanctified through the
[6:51] offering of the body of Jesus Christ
[6:53] once and for all
[6:55] Jesus knew the infirmity that would be
[6:58] in our flesh so he went to the cross and
[7:00] died that there would be a sacrifice
[7:01] once and for all
[7:06] and every priest standeth daily
[7:07] ministering and offering oftentimes the
[7:10] same sacrifices which can never take
[7:12] away sin the traditions of their time
[7:14] but this man after he had offered one
[7:16] sacrifice for sins forever sat down on
[7:19] the right hand of God his work was
[7:21] finished so he went and he sat down
[7:24] it was time for him to rest his work was
[7:27] completed
[7:28] amen
[7:34] from henceforth expecting till his
[7:36] enemies be made as footstool for by one
[7:38] offering he hath perfected forever them
[7:42] that are Sanctified notice this is just
[7:44] an absolute complete work that Jesus
[7:47] Christ did whereof the Holy Ghost also
[7:49] was witnessed to us for after that he
[7:51] had said before this is the Covenant
[7:54] that I will make with them after those
[7:56] days saith the Lord I will put my laws
[7:59] into their heart so it's not something
[8:02] that you're going to have to strive for
[8:04] for this Perfection God's just going to
[8:06] put it inside of you I mean it doesn't
[8:08] get any better than that to say to
[8:10] require something of somebody and then
[8:13] say okay but I'm going to give you what
[8:15] you need in order to meet this
[8:17] requirement
[8:18] and in their minds will I write them
[8:21] this isn't just have to do with the with
[8:23] the with the heart this is of the mind
[8:26] this is the infirmity and the Affliction
[8:28] that comes on our minds because we know
[8:30] the greatest battle ever fought is in
[8:32] the mind the enemy attacked brother Josh
[8:35] in his mind but God through Jesus Christ
[8:38] provided a sacrifice brother Josh that
[8:42] your infirmity is completely taken care
[8:44] of Amen
[8:47] and their sins and iniquities will I
[8:50] remember no more
[8:52] no more it's the powerful work of Jesus
[8:55] now where remission of these is there is
[8:58] no more offering for sin there's no need
[9:00] for offering anymore
[9:03] having therefore Brethren boldness to
[9:05] enter into the holiest by the blood of
[9:07] Jesus where there was separation between
[9:09] God and man Jesus made a way that
[9:12] there's no more separation
[9:14] by a New and Living Way which he hath
[9:16] consecrated for us through the veil that
[9:18] is to say his flesh and having a high
[9:21] priest over the house of God notice this
[9:25] high priest that Paul referenced back in
[9:27] Hebrews 4 he's now in chapter 10 calling
[9:31] him the absolute high priest of the
[9:34] entire house of God
[9:38] let us draw near with a true heart and
[9:41] full Assurance of Faith having our
[9:43] hearts sprinkled from an evil conscious
[9:45] and our bodies washed with pure water
[9:47] let us hold fast the profession of our
[9:50] faith without wavering for he is
[9:52] faithful that promised and let us
[9:54] consider one another
[9:56] to provoke one unto love and to Good
[9:59] Works not forsaking the assembling of
[10:02] ourselves together as the manner of some
[10:05] is but exhorting one another and so much
[10:07] more as we see the day approaching
[10:10] good
[10:13] now in Hebrews chapter 2
[10:17] Verse 18
[10:20] . let me just turn there and I'll read
[10:21] it to you real quick
[10:27] for in that he himself have suffered
[10:29] being tempted
[10:31] he is able to secure them that are
[10:34] tempted
[10:35] and that word secure is is a help it's
[10:38] to bring Aid to relieve it's a helper
[10:42] not only does he just is he a Helper but
[10:45] he runs it's to cry or call with a high
[10:49] strong voice out of Joy or pain in a
[10:52] violent and overwhelming turbulence or
[10:56] upheaval way
[10:58] so
[11:02] he suffered being tempted
[11:05] and when you feel Temptation in your
[11:07] flesh Jesus runs after you and he'll
[11:11] holler out in a violent manner telling
[11:14] you avoid that Don't Go Near that don't
[11:17] do that because he's trying to secure
[11:20] you in God he's trying to secret secure
[11:22] you to not fall it says he that's able
[11:26] to keep you from falling all you have to
[11:28] do is surrender all you all we have to
[11:30] do is yield our vessel and and and
[11:32] listen
[11:34] listen and act upon it
[11:37] it ties back into four in in chapter 4
[11:40] verse 15 and 16 that he's tempted in all
[11:43] points like we are and that we can come
[11:45] boldly to the throne of grace
[11:49] now I'm going to shift just a little bit
[11:51] and I know I've already read quite a bit
[11:53] but
[11:54] I've been I've been
[11:56] my wife laughed at me because I picked
[11:59] up a book I got into it it was really
[12:01] ministering to me someone gave me
[12:03] another book I started reading that a
[12:05] little bit and I'm not normally this way
[12:07] but I I can't put them down so I'm I'm
[12:10] reading a little bit one reading another
[12:11] I'm a terrible reader if you ask how
[12:13] many books I've read in the last five
[12:16] years
[12:17] all the way through
[12:19] I'm hoping to get these two done
[12:23] that's just how I'm just bad at it
[12:26] but
[12:27] I I had to take notice though because
[12:30] it's two separate books given to me by
[12:32] two separate people at two separate
[12:34] times I started reading them at separate
[12:37] times and it just so happens that both
[12:40] of them
[12:41] where I'm at in the book started
[12:43] speaking about shame
[12:45] and and
[12:47] coincidence I don't know I don't think
[12:49] so but it's just the Lord's been dealing
[12:52] with me on it and so I thought well
[12:54] maybe somebody here just seemed to fit
[12:57] in with these scriptures and everything
[12:58] so I thought well let's let's tackle it
[13:01] tonight so it's a lot of information so
[13:04] just listen and and I pray something
[13:07] speaks to you
[13:11] guilt though it's important to
[13:13] understand and this really it ties back
[13:15] to the sermon brother Paul preached on
[13:17] on uh condemnation verse conviction
[13:21] and uh both authors were saying similar
[13:25] things I was actually kind of wondering
[13:26] if they collaborated at all because some
[13:29] of it was so close but they started
[13:31] discussing we need to know the
[13:33] difference between guilt and shame
[13:34] because guilt would be like conviction
[13:37] that's what God does when you go before
[13:39] a judge the judge doesn't say uh you
[13:42] know we're talking about shame versus
[13:43] guilt he doesn't say
[13:45] um how do you plea brother Zach are you
[13:48] shameful are you Shameless or or do you
[13:51] plead no contest that's not what they
[13:54] asked they say are you guilty not guilty
[13:56] or no contest
[13:58] I've been to court before nothing
[14:00] terrible
[14:07] just be it's tickets okay
[14:10] everyone says it's an Italian guy a
[14:13] preaching what's going on we're all
[14:15] confused right now
[14:18] um but guilt is what you feel when you
[14:21] do something wrong
[14:23] guilt is a legitimate feeling for
[14:26] something that you did or that you
[14:28] thought
[14:29] uh shame and and Gil is is relates to
[14:34] morals
[14:35] so if you have a moral failure you're
[14:37] going to feel guilt for that moral
[14:39] failure but alongside and a close second
[14:42] with guilt is shame
[14:44] and there is an appropriate shame
[14:46] sometimes but most of the time it's a
[14:49] tool that Satan uses against us to bind
[14:52] up our spirit
[14:54] shame is felt in relation to models or
[14:57] in other words in in who I am and a
[15:01] relation to who I think I ought to be
[15:06] it's it's one about one is about actions
[15:09] and thoughts which is guilt the other is
[15:12] about the very nature of the being and
[15:14] my character
[15:16] so one is really separate from who you
[15:19] are it's just related to what you've
[15:22] done but shame comes in and the devil
[15:25] uses it and it and it starts affecting
[15:27] he's telling you this is who you are
[15:30] this is your identity and and this is
[15:34] the shame that you have to bear from
[15:36] that reproach
[15:38] so you see the difference between the
[15:40] two and how dangerous it can be in
[15:43] simple terms guilt says I have done
[15:45] something wrong shame says I'm a bad
[15:48] person
[15:50] shame is felt as being a dishonorable
[15:53] inferior or worthless person has anybody
[15:56] felt that way before
[15:58] okay just a couple of us all right
[16:01] pray for us
[16:04] Sheamus felt as being dishonorable
[16:07] inferior or worthless or a worthless
[16:09] person failing to live up to
[16:11] expectations whether it be your own
[16:14] expectations of yourself whether it's
[16:17] the expectations somebody else has put
[16:19] on you or really even the expectations
[16:21] that are set of you in God's word
[16:27] it's usually triggered when we
[16:30] anticipate a disapproval or a rejection
[16:32] by somebody you'll feel that shame if
[16:35] you think if I think man
[16:37] you know Kenny is just he's going to
[16:40] reject me if he finds this out he's
[16:42] gonna he's gonna uh he's gonna
[16:44] disapprove of me and that Kenny hasn't
[16:47] done anything yet Kenny doesn't even
[16:49] know anything about my life yet but I'm
[16:52] already walking up to Kenny thinking
[16:55] sorry Kenny Kenny is Kenny is thinking
[16:58] and feeling this way about me and it
[17:00] brings a shame on me and a heaviness on
[17:02] my spirit
[17:04] and then I can't I can't Fellowship
[17:06] freely with brother Kenny and brother
[17:08] Kenny's innocent he's done nothing wrong
[17:11] but yet I've already
[17:13] put
[17:15] his expectations that aren't even his on
[17:18] me
[17:19] so you see what the cycle is
[17:24] shame is feeling uh that you're inferior
[17:28] or a worthless person let's see I
[17:30] already read that
[17:33] so it's anticipating disapproval or
[17:35] rejection and and
[17:37] it's it's anticipating and disapproval
[17:40] rejection and when our foolishness or
[17:43] our weaknesses or our sin is exposed
[17:46] we we feel shame
[17:49] for Guilt we need forgiveness but for
[17:53] shame we need acceptance
[17:56] we're going to go deeper than this in
[17:58] just a minute so bear with me our
[18:00] culture moves the standard by which
[18:02] guilt is felt
[18:04] numbing us when we should feel guilt
[18:06] telling us we shouldn't feel guilt about
[18:09] something that we should when the moral
[18:11] standards of the culture around us
[18:13] starts to Decay then when you should
[18:16] feel guilty for doing something when
[18:18] when a woman walks outside and strips
[18:21] her clothes off she ought to feel guilt
[18:23] for that because it's wrong but but you
[18:26] see how twisted the world has got and
[18:28] that they say well let listen nobody's
[18:31] putting you undue shame on you for for
[18:34] walking out with no clothes on nobody
[18:37] you know they call it body shaming
[18:39] nobody's no
[18:40] no shaming your body they're just
[18:42] telling you that that's wrong
[18:44] go put some clothes on you're naked and
[18:46] that's wrong
[18:48] but the the but Satan's Eden has moved
[18:51] the goal post so much that there's
[18:53] there's no moral standard anymore we
[18:56] know sitting here that it's the word of
[18:57] God but anybody out there has no has no
[19:01] uh measuring tape to measure it by
[19:03] there's no scale to measure it anymore
[19:07] so but we ourselves can can enter into
[19:10] that and and and the more you in uh
[19:15] the more you respond to an enticing
[19:18] Spirit the more that you're drawn away
[19:19] and you give in to your lust as James
[19:21] says the the more you become numb and
[19:25] that guilt starts going away
[19:30] others can make you feel shame
[19:33] this is kind of hard to explain
[19:35] unless you've experienced it but
[19:38] you can you can talk to somebody or
[19:42] somebody can send you a text or
[19:45] um
[19:46] they can give you a look and it makes
[19:49] you feel I always said you know it makes
[19:52] you feel guilty they just that person
[19:53] just has a way of making you feel guilty
[19:55] but if you haven't done anything wrong
[19:57] then it's no longer guilt it's shame
[19:59] that that person is making not that
[20:02] person but the spirit on that person is
[20:04] making you feel shame
[20:07] they have a spirit that will make you
[20:09] feel shamed by things they say the looks
[20:11] they give the way they treat you or talk
[20:13] to you the way their body language is or
[20:16] the things that they do you go away
[20:18] feeling shame but really you have to
[20:20] stop when you feel that way and ask
[20:23] yourself
[20:24] is this true
[20:26] do I really have anything to feel
[20:30] bad about right now
[20:33] and if you can really answer no
[20:36] and and let me let me throw this in why
[20:39] don't you take that to prayer because
[20:41] every man is right in his own eyes God
[20:44] might be able to show you something that
[20:46] you are wrong in this area
[20:48] but if God doesn't show you anything
[20:50] you've taken it to prayer you've
[20:52] examined your heart I didn't mean
[20:53] anything by that I've I've apologized
[20:56] already then that's it
[20:58] that it's between them and God at that
[21:01] point you don't have to bear that shame
[21:05] shame can start from events in our lives
[21:07] when human dignity has been attacked by
[21:11] verbal physical or sexual abuse
[21:15] that's that's how shame can come
[21:19] when our human dignity is attacked by
[21:22] verbal physical or sexual abuse and and
[21:25] these books are both full of scenarios
[21:28] of of things that have been done awful
[21:31] to to most of it is to children
[21:35] and they bear that throughout their life
[21:37] to where when they become an adult
[21:39] you're going to say he's studying
[21:41] psychology
[21:42] um
[21:43] fair enough
[21:45] but
[21:47] those things that happen when we are a
[21:50] kid follow us into adulthood and then
[21:53] when something gets close to that pain
[21:55] that we felt back then it triggers a
[21:57] response today when we're adults and
[21:59] when we're 50 and 70 years old it
[22:03] triggers that
[22:04] and and we have to be careful we have to
[22:07] ask the Lord to show us Lord where is
[22:09] this coming from and then we have to go
[22:11] deal with it back there so that Satan
[22:13] can't hold that shame over us anymore
[22:15] and and we can live in Victory in Jesus
[22:18] Christ
[22:21] another author described the shame he
[22:23] felt for making it home alive from
[22:25] Vietnam
[22:27] and we know that that's a
[22:29] you know the the controversies around
[22:31] that whatever but he describes the shame
[22:35] he says he got off the plane and he was
[22:37] in his uniform and he was expecting you
[22:40] know thank you for your service and and
[22:42] welcome home but he said he got spit on
[22:45] and cussed at just getting off the plane
[22:49] and he said it immediately brought a
[22:51] shame as though there was something
[22:52] wrong with him for not dying in the war
[22:55] like so many of his comrades
[22:58] there's no reason you can't call that
[23:00] guilt it's not something that he did he
[23:03] he just made it out alive there's
[23:06] nothing wrong with that so it's not
[23:08] guilt he shouldn't feel guilt but it was
[23:11] shame he was he was being shamed for
[23:13] making it alive
[23:16] shame can make us feel responsible and
[23:18] deserving of abuse and bad things that
[23:20] happen to us these are the traps of
[23:22] Shame this is what Satan does to bind us
[23:24] is when we feel shame we feel
[23:26] responsible we feel deserving we feel
[23:29] like when something bad happens it's you
[23:33] know
[23:34] when I was young
[23:36] you know it was always you know
[23:38] Lightning's gonna strike you if you
[23:39] don't make that right you know and and
[23:41] and storms of life and just storms in
[23:45] general and I remember one summer God
[23:47] was dealing with me and and I don't know
[23:49] if it was because you know God love and
[23:52] my my grandfather and his Pentecostal
[23:54] background or what but we had a lot of
[23:56] storms that summer and I remember
[23:58] feeling so convicted and and petrified
[24:02] because of these storms because I
[24:04] because God was showing me my sin and I
[24:07] felt like these storms were caused by me
[24:13] it brought me to repentance so I'm happy
[24:15] for that
[24:17] but
[24:19] it it it makes you feel deserving of
[24:22] something it makes you feel like you
[24:24] can't have happiness because you deserve
[24:26] to be sad you deserve to be heavy you
[24:29] deserve to be disliked by others
[24:32] like there's something wrong with us
[24:34] that God has never and and could never
[24:37] and will never love us
[24:39] is what shame will make us feel
[24:42] when we feel shame and try to address it
[24:45] in our own strength though we can tend
[24:48] to overcompensate
[24:50] so
[24:52] many examples from these books that a a
[24:55] mother or father can pressure their
[24:57] family into being perfect so the family
[25:00] doesn't have the same shame that that
[25:03] father and mother has
[25:05] so they'll take their shame and they'll
[25:07] project it onto their kids or onto their
[25:09] wife onto others because they don't want
[25:13] them to carry the same shame that they
[25:16] have
[25:17] some people might have enough Pride with
[25:19] their shame that they feel like if I'm
[25:21] not happy then nobody can be happy so
[25:23] everyone should be it should feel shame
[25:28] are you with me still
[25:35] so even though the shame is not true
[25:39] a man
[25:42] can develop an unrelenting drive to be
[25:44] perfect or be the best at everything to
[25:48] compensate for his parents telling him
[25:50] he was never good at anything
[25:53] that projects a shame on that boy and
[25:56] now he's going to compensate for it and
[25:58] he's going to give his all to everything
[26:00] which isn't a bad thing but what's
[26:02] driving that that's where it becomes
[26:05] wrong is what's the driving force behind
[26:07] it
[26:08] it made him feel shame as a child so he
[26:10] strove for perfection
[26:12] he could struggle with trust
[26:15] he could struggle with showing emotion
[26:17] to those even that he loves
[26:20] and and shame can make a person feel
[26:23] like they have to be in control at all
[26:25] times
[26:26] they have to control other people in
[26:29] situations so that they themselves don't
[26:32] feel that shame again I'm not going to
[26:34] let that person put shame on me so I'm
[26:37] going to control that person I'm going
[26:39] to control this situation so I don't
[26:41] feel shame anymore
[26:43] shame will make us feel like we're un
[26:46] unenjoyable
[26:47] undesirable empty alone and like no one
[26:52] would want to pursue us or accept us it
[26:55] makes us feel diminished insufficient
[26:57] and defective as a person
[26:59] in response we will live in denial
[27:02] will live in perfectionism we'll live in
[27:05] anger or depression
[27:07] I'm going to turn this around in just a
[27:08] minute but this is I'm if you're dealing
[27:11] with shame I pray that something that's
[27:13] being said tonight would would help you
[27:15] understand the source of it's coming
[27:17] from
[27:18] we can become addicted to the sense of
[27:20] Shame though it almost becomes a comfort
[27:23] blanket something we have to fill or we
[27:25] don't feel normal because it's become so
[27:27] normal to us it's no longer a feeling
[27:30] but it's become our identity
[27:36] foreign
[27:38] often people fail to fully understand
[27:40] the incident that caused their shame or
[27:43] they hold it in and hide it within
[27:45] themselves never to share it with
[27:46] anybody
[27:49] and you say well are you telling us to
[27:51] go see a shrink no I'm not
[27:53] but there is a freedom when we confess
[27:57] our faults one to another there's a
[27:59] freedom and a healing James said that
[28:01] comes with that
[28:02] so you might find somebody who you have
[28:05] trust in
[28:06] and be careful because oftentimes we can
[28:10] tend to gravitate towards somebody who's
[28:12] struggling with the same thing
[28:14] and while that can be a good thing it's
[28:16] also a bad thing because you need
[28:17] somebody who can you need to be able to
[28:20] strengthen one another in the Lord you
[28:21] need to be able to strengthen one
[28:23] another in the things that are right
[28:33] shame within causes us to look outside
[28:35] for reassurance that we are worthwhile
[28:38] and if we're not careful we'll give
[28:40] ourselves we'll give up on ourselves and
[28:43] give ourselves away
[28:45] so we'll look in the wrong places for
[28:47] reassurance and we'll do things that are
[28:49] really self-destructive
[28:51] we can turn to things and become
[28:53] addiction uh that become addictions like
[28:55] alcohol and drugs and pornography
[28:59] excessive shopping
[29:01] excessive eating
[29:04] dependency on relationships even when
[29:07] they're the wrong ones
[29:09] the shame will only grow deeper and will
[29:11] still have not properly dealt with the
[29:14] shame that we feel
[29:16] this will eventually catch up with us
[29:18] and cause us to break down
[29:20] eventually
[29:22] we'll have a breakdown
[29:24] as Christians we know there's freedom in
[29:27] Christ there is Victory and we see it in
[29:28] other people's lives and when we feel
[29:30] shame and it's and it's just inside of
[29:33] us and we're holding it in even though
[29:35] it's a good thing and those are good
[29:36] examples we'll feel that shame and
[29:40] because we're not living there it can
[29:43] make us feel more shame
[29:45] so you see that you see how Sly The
[29:47] Devil is to make this cycle and to make
[29:49] it go deeper and deeper he he one
[29:52] example the guy uses is he calls it a
[29:54] noose and and Satan will just tighten
[29:56] that noose up every time to hold you
[30:00] down so you don't have freedom in Christ
[30:06] we must address
[30:08] this is one of the authors says we must
[30:10] address our sense of worthlessness at
[30:13] the point of our shame
[30:15] we have to find a safe place where we
[30:17] can finally let all the secrets out with
[30:19] nothing held back
[30:20] and I'll tell you the first place that
[30:22] you can go is to Jesus Christ
[30:25] the first place that you ought to go is
[30:27] in prayer to Jesus Christ and bring your
[30:30] shame to him because in the end he's the
[30:32] only one who can take it
[30:34] but we can if we can confide in somebody
[30:38] and share it with somebody who will lead
[30:40] us to Christ then they can help us go in
[30:43] prayer amen
[30:46] we need a safe place to confess our sins
[30:48] in order to be healed James 5 16.
[30:51] shame is incredibly painful people just
[30:54] want to be loved and accepted
[30:56] in that desire we can turn to the wrong
[30:58] things and the wrong people
[31:00] um
[31:01] our only chance of healing is to bring
[31:03] the things that make us feel guilt and
[31:06] shame to the Redemptive blood of Jesus
[31:08] Christ and let our minds be renewed
[31:12] by the overcoming transforming
[31:14] prevailing power of revelation of who we
[31:18] are in Jesus Christ
[31:22] the healing from shame is a process and
[31:25] if we introduce destructive Behavior
[31:27] relationships the process could take
[31:29] longer
[31:30] most often irregardless it's never a
[31:34] quick fix
[31:35] you can take that shame to the cross and
[31:39] it's in its and God can do it
[31:41] miraculously
[31:43] but oftentimes what happens is a slow
[31:46] process where God is dealing with that
[31:49] shame but he doesn't want to just deal
[31:51] with the shame that you're feeling he
[31:53] wants to go to the very core and cut the
[31:55] root out of what's causing the shame
[31:58] because otherwise it's just going to
[31:59] keep growing back
[32:04] now this is one thing I'm going to read
[32:06] two paragraphs right out of this one of
[32:08] the books this is shocking news to many
[32:10] Christians that it's not a quick fix
[32:12] because they expect Christ to deal with
[32:14] a problem miraculously he does but it
[32:17] involves renewing the mind and that
[32:20] never happens overnight we have to
[32:22] cooperate
[32:23] every step of the way
[32:27] the sense of being unlovable that lies
[32:30] within an addictive mindset can only be
[32:32] dealt with through healthy relationships
[32:34] at close range and that takes time the
[32:37] sense of aloneness that in this case
[32:40] sexual bondage brings to the human soul
[32:42] doesn't disappear quickly or easily
[32:44] those in the healing process have to
[32:47] give up their old friend
[32:49] the sexual High the the drug High
[32:52] whatever it is
[32:54] when they are feeling alone or worthless
[32:56] and they have to learn to trust in who
[32:58] Christ says they are
[33:00] notice I I love it because
[33:04] yes these are psychology it's it's
[33:07] psychologists they look at Psychology
[33:09] but I love the source that they're
[33:11] bringing us to because it's the only
[33:13] thing psychology can't fix your problem
[33:15] psychology can't wipe away your shame
[33:18] but they're taking us to Jesus Christ to
[33:21] the only source that can
[33:23] says address the issue of the person's
[33:25] position and identity in Christ as many
[33:27] ways as possible
[33:29] this is one subject we can't speak about
[33:31] too often from every possible
[33:34] perspective we need to make a bold
[33:36] declaration concerning the believer's
[33:38] position in Christ we must underline
[33:41] repeatedly that the individual is
[33:43] accepted in Christ secure in Christ and
[33:47] significant in Christ shame is like a
[33:50] charge from hell that violently attacks
[33:52] those truths so these facts must be
[33:54] rebuilt constantly in the believer's
[33:56] life especially if he has been entangled
[33:59] in sexual bondage
[34:02] so don't beat them down continually tell
[34:05] them who they are in Christ go to Christ
[34:08] Christ can help you you are a son of God
[34:11] you are a daughter of God you can
[34:13] overcome this thing because of who you
[34:15] are in Christ because of what Christ did
[34:18] for you
[34:20] Jesus Christ shed blood has removed the
[34:22] accuser's ability to bring accusations
[34:25] one of the authors brings the the
[34:28] scripture that in Revelations where he
[34:30] says the devil Satan's before God day
[34:33] and night bringing accusations against
[34:35] the believer but he says Jesus Christ
[34:37] shed blood has removed the accuser's
[34:40] ability to bring accusations against us
[34:42] before God we've talked about that many
[34:45] times we're well aware of that here but
[34:47] he has never stopped making accusations
[34:49] about God before us
[34:53] in other words he can go to God and we
[34:56] know that he has no say in the presence
[34:58] of God when you bring that under the
[35:00] blood God says I don't I don't know what
[35:03] you're talking about
[35:05] that's probably all these notes are
[35:07] worth tonight
[35:09] but Satan can come to us
[35:13] and and tell us that God God that
[35:16] doesn't apply to you maybe he's telling
[35:18] you that tonight
[35:19] maybe Satan's talking in your ear
[35:21] tonight and he's saying what that
[35:23] minister is saying doesn't apply to me
[35:26] Satan says that doesn't apply to you
[35:30] 'll never be free from shame you'll
[35:32] never be free from guilt you can't go
[35:34] ask forgiveness for God you've crossed
[35:36] the line brother Branham said if you
[35:38] have a desire in your heart to take it
[35:41] before God go take it before God because
[35:43] you haven't crossed the line
[35:50] I don't know these notes are pretty good
[35:51] if I say something
[35:54] when we have something traumatic happen
[35:56] to us or feel like God is not changing
[35:58] our situation we can feel deserted by
[36:01] God with what we know this in uh with
[36:05] what we know here this increases our
[36:07] shame level which Satan reminds us of
[36:09] continually which increases our shame
[36:12] again
[36:13] and it just and it increases his control
[36:16] over us
[36:19] Satan is good these are statements from
[36:22] this book and I just love them Satan is
[36:24] good at interpreting events for us if we
[36:26] let him
[36:28] something happens and who's right there
[36:30] to tell you what the deeper meaning to
[36:32] life is
[36:34] it's the devil
[36:37] Jesus Christ bled four times for us so
[36:41] now we're going to deal with shame
[36:44] Jesus Christ bled four times for us and
[36:46] I I just thought this was remarkable
[36:49] he bled in the garden
[36:51] and we brought these things out during
[36:53] Easter time
[36:55] blood was shed to free us from our own
[36:58] will
[37:00] so you're stuck in an addiction you're
[37:02] stuck in bondage to something you're
[37:04] stuck in a sin cycle in your life
[37:07] Jesus Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane
[37:11] gave up he bled
[37:13] and gave up his will
[37:16] so Jesus Christ that means Jesus Christ
[37:18] bled for you to be able to give up your
[37:22] will
[37:24] the crown of thorns blood was shed
[37:28] for the abusive games people play
[37:31] for the abuse caused by others
[37:34] remember they put the crown of thorns on
[37:36] him and then they started mocking him
[37:38] and they made a game out of them and
[37:40] they they were they were it was just
[37:42] complete mockery hitting him and saying
[37:44] tell us who hit you
[37:46] they're playing games against something
[37:49] that of against who who Jesus Christ was
[37:52] but it says
[37:54] he took that crown of thorns and he took
[37:56] he took that beating he took that
[37:58] mockery so that when somebody brings an
[38:01] accusation against you when somebody
[38:03] plays a game with you with your emotions
[38:07] young people when some guy or girl plays
[38:10] with your emotions when when somebody
[38:12] abuses you verbally or physically or or
[38:15] sexually that Crown of Thorns took that
[38:18] and bled for you
[38:21] at the whipping post blood was shed he
[38:24] took Stripes so we could be healed
[38:26] physically but also for our deepest
[38:29] hurts our deepest traumas and the
[38:32] bondage in our life his healing goes
[38:34] much deeper than our physical bodies it
[38:37] penetrates to the spirit
[38:39] where our most painful memories and
[38:42] shame is stored
[38:46] on the Cross blood was shed as the total
[38:49] expression of God's grace to us in
[38:51] Christ
[38:52] Paul wrote what Christ did for us
[38:54] blotted out the handwriting of
[38:56] ordinances that was against us
[39:00] and and
[39:02] the the author gave this example of what
[39:04] Paul was writing there and it reminded
[39:06] me of what the prophet said about
[39:08] dropping a drop of ink into into bleach
[39:10] the ink disappears
[39:13] and when it says that Christ blotted out
[39:16] the handwriting of ordinance that was
[39:18] against us it's referring to at the time
[39:21] I guess they had you could take a piece
[39:22] of parchment and it could be cleansed
[39:24] for reuse
[39:26] so that piece of parchment could have
[39:28] the law written on it it could have it
[39:31] could have the things that make you
[39:32] guilt that that are are punishing you
[39:36] making you guilty of a crime that
[39:39] parchment could have that on that but
[39:40] they could take that parchment and clean
[39:43] it to such a place that something new
[39:46] could be written on it and there would
[39:48] be absolutely no trace of what was
[39:51] written on it before and that's what the
[39:53] blood of Jesus Christ did for us it
[39:55] blotted out the things that were written
[39:57] against us to where it's a clean sheet
[39:59] of paper it no longer has the things
[40:02] that are bringing you shame on it it's
[40:04] pure white and Jesus is writing a new
[40:06] story on it amen
[40:12] the blood shed on the cross totally
[40:15] washes away everything that is written
[40:17] against you every sin and record of
[40:20] wrongdoing guilt and shame
[40:22] is the power of the blood
[40:27] so
[40:28] I know it seems cliche sometimes to say
[40:33] to say these things it's the power of
[40:35] the blood you need to just bring it to
[40:36] the cross and and oftentimes Granite
[40:39] that that's it is more difficult
[40:43] then then it's that simple
[40:47] but it's difficult too
[40:49] because Satan's always right there to
[40:51] tell us and to to keep beating us down
[40:53] with those things and and and the the
[40:56] way we feel like I can't approach God
[40:58] God's not going to hear my prayer it's
[41:00] it's the voice of Satan but if we can
[41:02] just press through and and let our faith
[41:06] rest on the word of God
[41:08] and renew our mind instead of letting
[41:10] those thoughts of Shame dominate us we
[41:13] start taking the word of God that
[41:15] combats that shame it renews our mind
[41:18] and it starts healing us it starts
[41:20] healing your spirit it starts healing
[41:22] your soul amen
[41:24] are you with me
[41:26] we're already accepted you can find
[41:29] scriptures for everything I'm going to
[41:30] say right now we're already accepted
[41:33] you are the joy that was set before
[41:36] Christ to endure the cross you are each
[41:39] one of you are were set before Christ it
[41:43] was a joy for him to endure and to bleed
[41:47] like he did because you were set before
[41:49] him you gave Jesus Christ the spirit
[41:53] left him when he was in the garden he
[41:55] was walking to the Cross as a man but
[41:58] you gave him the spirit's gone you gave
[42:01] him the strength you gave him the power
[42:03] to move forward with every step bearing
[42:07] the weight of that cross every every
[42:09] lash that was in in flesh that was
[42:12] ripped from his body you gave him the
[42:14] power to endure that you gave him the
[42:17] strength to go on
[42:20] every drop of blood was for you
[42:25] he made you and knew you you say well
[42:28] I'm not I'm worthless that shame it just
[42:30] make I feel so worthless I'm I'm not
[42:33] worth nothing nobody would care about me
[42:35] nobody could love me I'm unlovable but
[42:38] he made you and he knew you when you
[42:40] were in your mother's womb you are
[42:43] fearfully and wonderfully made you say
[42:46] well so and so they they told me I was
[42:48] ugly I just I feel ugly you're fearfully
[42:51] and wonderfully made
[42:54] you are accepted in him he's traded you
[43:00] brother Zach he said give me your ashes
[43:03] and he's given you beauty
[43:06] he said
[43:09] he said I'll give you brother can a
[43:11] Garment of Praise but you give me your
[43:14] heaviness
[43:15] what are the things that make you heavy
[43:17] tonight
[43:18] what has Satan put on you that you're
[43:21] bearing tonight that makes you heavy
[43:23] Jesus says
[43:25] I'll take it
[43:28] give it to me and here here is my
[43:31] righteousness for you
[43:33] here's a garment here's a Garment of
[43:35] Praise let me give you something you
[43:37] give me your ashes and I'll give you
[43:39] something to Rejoice about amen
[43:43] he desires you
[43:46] he loves you
[43:48] he accepts you
[43:50] and you were worth dying for
[43:54] now there's been another part to this
[43:57] that it's I probably have three sermons
[44:00] and one
[44:02] but there's another part to this that
[44:05] got me really excited this week and one
[44:08] of the songs I wanted to sing was
[44:10] we called out to dry bones come alive
[44:15] because
[44:17] I got to thinking about the scripture in
[44:19] Ezekiel and if you want to read
[44:21] something beautiful just
[44:23] sums up everything I read Ezekiel 37 go
[44:26] read that tonight
[44:28] because God comes to Ezekiel
[44:31] and it says he picks Ezekiel up in the
[44:34] spirit and sets him down in a valley
[44:37] and it's not a small Valley it's a huge
[44:40] Valley
[44:41] and he said it's dry
[44:43] and there's bones everywhere it's a it's
[44:46] a giant graveyard and it's so it's so
[44:49] dry we know when when Samson took that
[44:53] that uh that bone of a donkey and
[44:56] started beating in philistine's heads it
[44:59] was a dry bone it was a dry Jawbone he
[45:02] should have walked over picked it up and
[45:04] it should have crumbled in his hand but
[45:06] the supernatural kept that bone intact
[45:09] this Valley is full of Bones like that
[45:13] and then God says son of man which
[45:16] brother rap taught us it just means
[45:19] prophet my Prophet can these bones live
[45:24] in ezekiel's like
[45:28] you know Lord
[45:31] I why are you asking me
[45:34] and then God says I want you to prophesy
[45:37] to these bones
[45:39] this fits in with what we're talking
[45:40] about so just bear with me
[45:43] he says prophesy and he starts speaking
[45:48] life back into these bones back into we
[45:51] would say the valley of Shame
[45:54] he starts speaking life back into him
[45:57] and he says Speak Life speak the sinew
[46:00] speak the skin
[46:02] speak it and when he was done speaking
[46:04] it was a whole Army
[46:07] it wasn't just a bunch of dead people
[46:10] it was an Army
[46:13] and when when he speaks life into him he
[46:16] says join the Army you're part of the
[46:18] army of the Lord he says rise up and the
[46:22] bodies are standing there but he says
[46:24] there's no breath in him and he said
[46:26] Speak Life
[46:28] speak breath into him take the shame
[46:31] from them and let them live Speak life
[46:34] so what was broken and dried out before
[46:36] now has life
[46:39] [Music]
[46:42] he says
[46:44] son of man this is Israel
[46:47] they're the dry bones they were cut off
[46:51] for what they've done
[46:53] but God said he'll open their graves
[46:58] he says I'll bring them out of the
[47:00] graves I'll put my spirit in them and
[47:02] I'm going to place them in the land
[47:05] this is a beautiful work of redemption
[47:07] because he doesn't say Okay rise up Army
[47:10] now go take your land he says I'm gonna
[47:13] give him life and then I'm gonna put him
[47:15] in their land
[47:18] he'll do away with the divisions Among
[47:20] Us
[47:22] if you feel shame because of some
[47:24] division he'll do away with that
[47:25] division
[47:27] he'll take us out of the Heathen that
[47:30] we've gotten ourselves mixed up in
[47:35] if you're if you're if you're stuck in
[47:37] pornography or you're you're stuck in
[47:40] some addiction
[47:42] fashion magazines or whatever it doesn't
[47:44] matter he'll he'll he'll take you from
[47:47] out amongst that and bring you into
[47:49] himself he'll Clean us
[47:53] so that we don't defile ourselves with
[47:55] the Heathen anymore
[47:57] will be his people he says they'll be my
[48:01] people I'll be in their midst
[48:04] he'll be our King and his word
[48:07] uh and by his word we will walk
[48:10] we are his children and he's made a
[48:13] covenant of peace with us if you feel
[48:16] shame tonight if you feel conviction
[48:19] tonight take it to the cross and get rid
[48:21] of it Let Jesus Christ take it because
[48:25] he says I want to give you peace
[48:27] he is our God and we are his people and
[48:30] it says he sanctifies us forevermore
[48:37] you can stand to your feet
[48:51] I pray that something tonight spoke to
[48:53] you
[48:54] I wasn't wasn't very long I don't know
[48:57] really how long I've been not very but
[49:03] but I pray that this spoke to you in
[49:05] some way
[49:07] because God dealt with my heart on it
[49:10] for me personally but I believe if he's
[49:12] been dealing with my heart on it then
[49:15] it just correlated with timing of being
[49:18] asked to preach and everything so I
[49:20] trust that something that was said would
[49:23] bless you and help you in your journey
[49:25] that's that's my heart's desire that's
[49:28] God's desire is to lift that shame from
[49:30] you to take it to take to take the guilt
[49:33] if you've done something wrong bring it
[49:36] before the Lord take it to the cross and
[49:38] give it to him let him take it let him
[49:41] cleanse you let him renew your mind
[49:44] don't feel shame for it
[49:47] get it under the blood and then you have
[49:49] no you have no reason to hold on to that
[49:51] any longer
[49:53] Satan has no jurisdiction over you when
[49:56] it's under the blood and Christ died for
[49:59] it he bled four times four different
[50:01] ways he bled all along the way but there
[50:04] was there was four different things
[50:05] there that caused him to bleed for you
[50:10] and then I think sometimes about maybe
[50:13] somebody on their deathbed given their
[50:15] heart to the Lord and I think that thief
[50:17] on the cross
[50:19] and and brother Paul said it a long time
[50:21] ago Jesus that was the first time Jesus
[50:25] looked at somebody through the blood and
[50:27] gave him forgiveness
[50:30] it's that same blood Jesus yeah his work
[50:34] is done and he's sitting on the right
[50:35] hand of God we read but he's on a mercy
[50:38] seat and he's still the bloody lamb he's
[50:40] still looking through that blood at you
[50:43] and I he's he's able to take your
[50:45] parchment tonight and and wash it clean
[50:48] so that he can write something new for
[50:50] you
[50:51] he wants to write you a new story don't
[50:54] don't hold on to the Past
[50:56] it's a scary Journey it can be a very
[50:59] scary Journey but take the Journey of
[51:01] the heart ask God to show you why do I
[51:04] respond this way why do I react this way
[51:06] why why do I have to have why do I have
[51:10] to control people and situations why do
[51:12] I get so angry what what is it in My
[51:15] Heart Lord that has caused that and I
[51:17] guarantee you God will show you
[51:20] he might not show you tonight he can
[51:24] but it may take time
[51:26] because something at some point God will
[51:28] bring something in your path to where
[51:31] when you when you you recognize it and
[51:34] it it clicks
[51:36] it sticks because you're you're thinking
[51:38] different you're praying different Lord
[51:40] show me this and he says now now I can
[51:43] work with you now let me take that let
[51:46] me take your beaut let me take your
[51:47] ashes and take my beauty
[51:51] let's let's bow our hearts and
[51:55] and I don't know what to pray
[51:57] specifically here just
[51:59] if you have something that you want God
[52:02] to take
[52:03] maybe you need to just take a moment and
[52:05] repent
[52:07] just repent ask God Lord help me not to
[52:10] do that again I'm sorry Lord
[52:13] I got caught up in the Trap you know
[52:15] Satan can make us think you know well
[52:18] you did that willfully you went and did
[52:20] that you you had some desire listen
[52:22] temptation is is a form of Desire I
[52:25] would believe
[52:26] make you feel like I wanted to do that
[52:29] well your flesh wanted to do that but
[52:32] ask yourself if you're feeling if you're
[52:34] feeling guilt if you're feeling shame
[52:36] then there's something inside of you
[52:38] that didn't really want to do that you
[52:40] don't want to be that you don't want to
[52:42] be that way
[52:44] just lift it before the Lord now take it
[52:46] before the cross and Let Jesus Take It
[52:50] father I pray Jesus that if we've done
[52:52] anything Lord here tonight or anyone
[52:55] that would listen we pray for our loved
[52:57] ones
[52:58] lord they're part of the dry bones
[53:00] father that was in that Valley as our
[53:03] unsaved loved ones
[53:04] and Lord we're asking you to speak life
[53:07] to breathe the breath of life into him
[53:09] tonight father go catch them wherever
[53:12] they're at God maybe they're in the
[53:15] performing some Act of sin right now God
[53:19] Lord I I have a hard time getting away
[53:21] from The Prostitute that was thrown at
[53:24] your feet
[53:25] caught in the very Act of adultery
[53:29] and you didn't condemn her
[53:31] you forgave her
[53:34] [Music]
[53:36] the enemy
[53:37] the religious of that day were trying to
[53:40] Heap up shame and guilt on her get Jesus
[53:43] to to claim that she's guilty
[53:47] make her feel ashamed in front of that
[53:50] group of men
[53:52] but you said I love you
[53:56] I forgive you
[53:58] I'll accept you
[54:01] Lord I pray father whatever anybody is
[54:04] going through tonight God look deeper
[54:07] into our hearts Lord
[54:09] father there's things God that we can't
[54:11] even put into words
[54:13] we don't know why we're the way we are
[54:15] we don't know why we respond that way
[54:17] but we've done it for years
[54:19] and I just pray father that you would
[54:21] let the healing process start tonight
[54:24] father that you would let your people be
[54:27] free God
[54:29] and I don't say that Satan to make them
[54:32] feel guilty to make them feel shame for
[54:34] not being free that you put them in that
[54:37] situation
[54:38] but Lord God you said I'll take you and
[54:41] I'll wash you and I'll make you be my
[54:43] people you you'll I'll be your God and
[54:46] you'll be my children
[54:47] all dwell in your midst I'll give you my
[54:49] spirit father I pray God if anyone here
[54:52] tonight is the lacking of the spirit
[54:54] Satan's made me question whether I had
[54:57] the spirit many many times
[55:00] but father where I found peace is that
[55:02] you want to give it to me more than I
[55:04] want it
[55:05] so if I don't have it then I can rest
[55:08] that you'll that I'll get it because you
[55:11] said he that started a good work in me
[55:13] as faithful to finish us
[55:15] and Lord You Love Me
[55:17] and I'm resting in that Lord help your
[55:20] people to rest in that
[55:22] take our sin and shame
[55:24] in Jesus Christ's name
[55:28] amen
