[23:36] You are my
[23:39] everything and I will adore
[23:43] [Music]
[23:44] you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Luke 18 and
[23:49] verse 1. And he spake a parable unto
[23:52] them to this end that men ought always
[23:55] to pray and not to faint, saying, There
[23:59] was in a city a judge, which feared not
[24:02] God, neither regarded man. And there was
[24:04] a widow in that city, and she came unto
[24:07] him, saying, "Avenge me of mine
[24:09] adversary." And he would not for a
[24:11] while. But afterward he said within
[24:14] himself, "Though I fear not God, nor
[24:17] regard man, yet because this widow
[24:21] trouble troubleth me, I will avenge her,
[24:25] lest by her continual coming, she weary
[24:29] me." This is a parable of a judge here
[24:32] that this widow kept coming and kept
[24:36] coming and did not give up and kept kept
[24:39] bringing her uh need. And we'll talk
[24:41] about this a little further tonight, but
[24:43] because of her continual coming and
[24:46] finally a judge that actually did not
[24:48] regard man or fear God, it actually
[24:51] worked on him to finally come through
[24:53] and stand for the woman. So he says in
[24:56] verse 5, I'm emphasize again, because
[24:58] this widow troubleth me, I will avenge
[25:00] her, lest by her continual coming she
[25:04] weary me. And the Lord said, hear what
[25:07] the unjust judge saith. And shall not
[25:11] God avenge his own elect, which cry day
[25:15] and night unto him, though he bear long
[25:18] with them? And I tell you that he will
[25:21] avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when
[25:25] the Son of Man cometh, shall he find
[25:27] faith on the earth. This is actually
[25:30] goes into a prophecy for the end time,
[25:32] this parable, because he's actually
[25:34] asking when the son of man comes at the
[25:36] coming of the Lord, will he find this
[25:38] kind of faith when he comes, this faith
[25:42] that won't quit, this faith that keeps
[25:46] coming to the judge, this faith that
[25:48] will not be turned down. That's the kind
[25:51] of faith we need towards God. Lord,
[25:53] bless your word tonight and anoint our
[25:55] lips as we humbly take your word tonight
[25:57] before the people in Jesus name. Amen.
[26:00] God bless you. You may be
[26:04] seated. So tonight I want to continue on
[26:07] speaking about the message he cares. Do
[26:09] you care? And I I'm amazed at the if
[26:11] you've been reading it, I'm amazed at
[26:13] the very beginning of the service that
[26:16] uh the prophet takes a couple of real
[26:18] life examples and they're given and he
[26:21] actually uses them besides the
[26:23] scriptures. He uses them as a foundation
[26:26] for the subject and the and what I'm
[26:28] calling it a key for believers to break
[26:32] into a God who cares and and get the
[26:34] attention of a God who cares. Um using
[26:36] that as a key that we're learning from.
[26:38] and uh he uses real life examples at the
[26:42] very beginning as a foundation uh to be
[26:44] able to explain where he's getting his
[26:46] thought from. And I'm going to read
[26:48] those tonight. And that that actually at
[26:50] the end will be most of my service
[26:51] because I I want you to just look at the
[26:54] examples and they go directly with Luke
[26:56] chapter 18 here and the the fervent
[26:59] continual coming that we need to bring
[27:01] to God. And so tonight, I want to read
[27:03] those things. And he uses it as a base
[27:05] for this key to a supernatural God
[27:08] stepping in to show he cares. Last
[27:11] couple services we showed that God
[27:13] doesn't care by just saying he cares and
[27:15] putting his hand on your shoulder and
[27:17] say, "I care." God is a supernatural God
[27:19] that wants to care by doing something
[27:21] different to change the situation. I'm
[27:23] just laying that foundation again so you
[27:25] understand why we're on this series and
[27:27] talking about it. God stepping into the
[27:30] situation is how he shows he cares.
[27:33] Changing, creating, uh doing the
[27:36] impossible, doing the supernatural. And
[27:40] then we find there's another side to it.
[27:42] But he he's stepping in to show that he
[27:44] cares. But he does it because the right
[27:48] thing on your side, on the believer's
[27:50] side, the right attitude, the right
[27:52] atmosphere, uh the right openness, the
[27:55] right honesty, the right sincere
[27:57] confession. You'll find all of these
[27:59] things in the message. There are things
[28:01] that we bring as a as an attitude that
[28:04] show we care about a caring God. We care
[28:07] about getting help. We're not running
[28:09] from it, but we're running towards it.
[28:11] And so I just I want to make it clear at
[28:14] the uh at the I'll make these things
[28:16] clear at the middle or towards the end
[28:18] uh that brother Brand leaves no doubt to
[28:20] this key when he says at the end he said
[28:23] God cares and this is what I've been
[28:25] preaching on. God cares when you care
[28:28] but you have to care first.
[28:32] So that sums it up at the end. He says
[28:34] that at the end I found it again today.
[28:35] What I'm preaching on God cares when you
[28:38] care but you have to care first.
[28:41] So, um I know there are no doubt times
[28:44] when we are so away from God and and and
[28:48] God just comes down and grabs us out of
[28:50] the miry clay. I know God can do that.
[28:53] But when we're believers and we're
[28:55] coming to him for a certain need, God is
[28:57] looking for our attitude that's an
[28:59] that's a kind of a relentless uh faith
[29:03] that says, "Listen, I'm not just
[29:05] halfhazardly asking. I'm asking and I'm
[29:08] continually asking and I'm waiting God
[29:10] for God to step in in a supernatural
[29:12] way. Can you say amen? So God cares when
[29:14] you care, but you have to care first. So
[29:16] if this is true, then we should work our
[29:19] way through this message that has been
[29:21] preached to learn the ways that we show
[29:24] we care. I don't want to miss any of the
[29:25] ways. I don't want to have an area in my
[29:28] life that I'm an attitude that I'm
[29:30] presenting to God that makes God
[29:32] hesitate towards me. I don't want
[29:34] anything hindering my faith. I don't
[29:37] want anything in the way. And most
[29:38] believers are very sensitive to this. Uh
[29:41] I've had phone calls this week is that
[29:43] is am I doing something wrong, brother
[29:44] Paul? Is do I have a lack of faith and
[29:47] say, "Well, I'm I'm not I say I I'm a
[29:49] pro I'm not a prophet. I don't know."
[29:51] But believers have a should have a
[29:53] sincerity. They want to examine every
[29:55] part of their life. Is there anything
[29:57] that's blocking this? Is there any sin?
[29:59] Is there something that I don't know?
[30:00] And just that attitude itself, I think
[30:03] God appreciates because there are some
[30:05] things that are mysterious. So, we just
[30:07] don't know why they're going on. But our
[30:10] job is to stand there before God and
[30:12] say, "God, if there's a hindrance to my
[30:14] faith, help me. Show me that you remove
[30:17] all hindrances so the flow of faith can
[30:20] flow freely through me and all the
[30:22] hindrances will be removed." Can you say
[30:24] amen? So now um and and let's I want to
[30:27] refer to Sunday's message from brother
[30:29] Daniel uh Ephory Darko is his full name.
[30:32] Brother Daniel Ephory Darko. We took him
[30:35] back this morning to brother Bill
[30:36] Bailey. He's there tonight speaking. But
[30:38] I want to refer us back to Sunday
[30:40] because his message was in such harmony
[30:42] with this series with what the Holy
[30:44] Spirit is saying to our church and to
[30:47] the local assembly. And he that hath
[30:49] here ear to hear, let him hear what the
[30:51] spirit is saying to us. uh let us uh be
[30:55] feeding as sheep in the uh in the area
[30:58] that he's wanting us to feed in right
[30:59] now. And uh the Holy Spirit was just
[31:02] echoing that again as he entitled it the
[31:05] approach to a supernatural God. First of
[31:07] all, I want to let everyone know and we
[31:09] should let everyone know we don't
[31:11] believe in religion. We believe in a
[31:13] supernatural God. We believe in 2025
[31:16] that he's just as supernatural, just as
[31:19] real, can do the same things he's ever
[31:21] did before. There isn't one lack of God
[31:24] in this generation. In this hour, he can
[31:27] do what he did before. He can do it
[31:29] again. Can you say amen? So now, knowing
[31:31] we serve a supernatural God, his message
[31:33] was the approach to a supernatural God.
[31:36] Wonderful. and and and and there there
[31:39] seems to be with the Lord sometimes that
[31:41] there's something that's real hard that
[31:45] is put out there by the Lord that that
[31:48] makes it a bit of a a challenge for us
[31:50] to break through so that we show that
[31:53] we're serious about it. And he gave the
[31:55] example it seemed like the Lord is g he
[31:57] gives a bit of a test to show if we
[31:59] really mean it and want help. And the
[32:01] great great example he gave gave was
[32:03] this non who was asked to go wash
[32:06] himself seven times in the worst muddy
[32:10] river in the whole region. Can you say
[32:13] amen? So that shows us that his his
[32:16] blessing of his healing of his leprosy
[32:19] was just just waiting right there. But
[32:22] he had to go through some muddy waters
[32:24] and be washed before he come to a
[32:27] supernatural God. And that says
[32:29] something about God's character. And
[32:32] some people are not willing to go
[32:34] through the muddy waters to get to the
[32:37] real
[32:37] deliverance. You know, for non it was a
[32:40] new thing to him. So he reasoned with
[32:42] that. And why can't I go to the the
[32:44] waters that are cleaner? And you know,
[32:46] he's a he's a ruler there in Syria. So
[32:49] he's probably not used to ever being in
[32:51] muddy waters like that and thinks it's a
[32:53] dirty thing. So he's reasoning in his
[32:55] mind. He thought it was going to happen
[32:57] a certain way with the prophet and we
[32:58] get in our minds and the one thing we
[33:00] need to learn about God. Don't tell God
[33:02] how he's going to bring the deliverance
[33:04] or the or the healing. Can you say,
[33:06] "Man, don't tell don't have your mind
[33:08] already set in concrete, but say, God,
[33:11] whatever you use to do it, whatever
[33:13] muddy waters I have to go through, I'm
[33:15] willing to do it. And I'm willing to do
[33:17] it not five or six times. I'm willing to
[33:19] wash seven times. Whatever he says to
[33:22] do, that's the obedience that we should
[33:23] offer." But you see, he had to go wash
[33:26] seven times in the worst muddy river.
[33:28] What uh what do we what do you have? Uh
[33:31] sometimes, you know, uh referring to
[33:34] Elisha, he's speaking of there's a
[33:36] there's a real transition from Elijah to
[33:40] Elisha in ministries. Now, that being
[33:43] said, Elisha asked Elijah that a double
[33:46] portion of his spirit would come on him.
[33:49] So all these uh stories in the Bible are
[33:52] not just stories because we have lived
[33:54] in the days of Elijah. We have seen
[33:56] Elijah come again in our generation, the
[33:59] spirit of Elijah on a man. So now when
[34:01] you look in the the the Bible, you see
[34:02] Elijah uh and there are some miracles
[34:06] and things that he did that Elisha did
[34:08] that are similar. But if you really read
[34:10] your Bible, and I can't read it tonight,
[34:12] but if you read it and you pull out the
[34:14] differences, there's because brother
[34:17] says you got Elijah and he was bold and
[34:20] he's speaking to Jezebel and he's
[34:22] speaking the whole political system.
[34:24] He's speaking against the king. It's
[34:26] more of a dispensational, more of a a a
[34:29] political rebuke over the whole nation,
[34:32] over the whole thing of Israel. But when
[34:34] it come to Elisha, it was more of a
[34:36] personal ministry to the widow. It was
[34:38] more it wasn't an international thing.
[34:41] It was taking the same double the spirit
[34:43] double portion of it but it was
[34:45] ministering personally. And I find in
[34:48] the incidences with it is that in
[34:50] Elisha's incident in dealing with the
[34:53] people there was something that he asked
[34:55] for from them first where Elijah he
[34:58] would just he would go do it. He would
[35:00] speak it. He'd say there would be no
[35:01] more rain. But you see now Elisha says
[35:03] in these in the in the muddy raider he
[35:05] said go dip seven times then you'll get
[35:07] your healing. He told the woman uh what
[35:10] do you have in your home? What can you
[35:12] offer me? She said I got a little cruise
[35:14] of oil. Go get that cruise of well
[35:16] that's all we got. Well look at now what
[35:18] he's asking for. Take everything you
[35:20] got. Give it to me. I'll take it. And
[35:22] then he's God's testing us. Are you
[35:24] willing to do the hard thing in order to
[35:27] get to your miracle? Amen. And Elisha
[35:29] just dealt a a bit different with the
[35:32] people. He told the rich young ruler, he
[35:34] got him where his where it counts in his
[35:38] uh his billful, his bank accounts. God
[35:42] always knows where to get us, doesn't
[35:44] he? Most of us, he does. He wouldn't
[35:46] test us with our bank accounts because
[35:47] we don't have very much. But with the
[35:49] rich young ruler, it was everything.
[35:52] So it was the rich young ruler kept
[35:54] probing saying, "Uh, I've done all the
[35:56] commandments, but I really want eternal
[35:58] life. I want He's the one that kept
[36:00] asking." So then Jesus said, "All right,
[36:02] go sell everything that you have and
[36:03] give it to the
[36:06] poor." He's feeling the pain of that.
[36:08] And God God got him right where his pain
[36:11] was, right? The hard thing to give up.
[36:14] You don't think some of these things
[36:15] that's in the word about a woman's dress
[36:18] and these different things, you think
[36:21] sometimes it's just all we write it off.
[36:23] But you see, sometimes it can be a test.
[36:25] Are you willing to do the little thing?
[36:29] How important is you to hang on to this
[36:31] thing? I'm going to dress this way. I'm
[36:32] going to hold on to this. And God just
[36:34] test somebody. And he tests every one of
[36:36] us a little different because he knows
[36:38] if we're serious and we care, then he's
[36:41] going to test us if we care. And just
[36:44] some more things about the the
[36:47] supernatural here or about uh uh non. Um
[36:50] in the story of non God through the
[36:52] prophet dealt with leprosy different
[36:54] than he had before. People had leprosy
[36:57] and until that point the only answer was
[36:59] for them to just deal with it. Just
[37:01] you's ever heard that just deal with it.
[37:03] You know you got leprosy just deal with
[37:05] it. And to separate you had to go out in
[37:06] a camp. So there wasn't too much that's
[37:08] dealt with. Now in this incident when
[37:10] Elisha type of the bride Elijah's come
[37:14] Elisha Sha is she type of the bride. How
[37:17] is he dealing with leprosy? Well, he's
[37:19] dealing with it a different way. He said
[37:21] go, he says go dip seven times in Jordan
[37:24] and your leprosy will be healed. We
[37:27] never seen it quite that way, but I want
[37:29] to bring the point. Don't ever question
[37:32] what God is asking you to do because he
[37:35] might ask you to do something that is
[37:38] strange to the mind, but God knows what
[37:41] he's doing. Can I get an amen? Trust
[37:43] God. He knows what he's doing. And and
[37:46] so uh it was a crazy thing to do. Non
[37:48] had to uh lay down all of his ideas and
[37:51] all of his uh everything and trust what
[37:53] the prophet said to do uh and do
[37:55] something. Sometimes he has to do
[37:57] something that we don't agree with or we
[37:59] don't want to do but it got the results.
[38:01] Isn't that the thing that counts? Does
[38:04] it get results? We are result we are are
[38:07] resultoriented people. We want to see a
[38:09] supernatural God. We want to see
[38:13] results in in God's own time but we're
[38:16] looking for results. The word in that
[38:18] day was dealing and I believe it deals
[38:21] this in this day with modern problems
[38:23] and personal problems. The answers are
[38:26] here and we overlook the answer because
[38:29] the answer is not in the way doesn't
[38:32] come the way we expected sometimes. So
[38:35] under Elisha and Elijah it's a it's a
[38:37] change in the ministry. Same spirit
[38:39] double portion of the spirit but through
[38:41] the bride's ministry now it's more of a
[38:44] personal work. It's not an international
[38:46] work. Even the third pole says it's not
[38:48] a public show. So it's more of a
[38:50] personal. Elijah dealt personally and
[38:52] and so you would need to study that real
[38:55] close in your Bible in First Kings and
[38:57] Second Kings to see those types and
[38:58] shadows there and see the differences
[39:01] between Elijah and Elisha. This is not
[39:04] the days of Elijah anymore in our day,
[39:06] but we're in the days of Elisha. So
[39:08] those types and shadows should be a
[39:10] blessing to you to see in the word
[39:11] because we're living in that time. Can
[39:13] you say amen? So when we go to read
[39:15] these two examples of Brother Brand, he
[39:17] cares you care. uh uh I want to read
[39:19] those but I want to give this scriptural
[39:21] base first in Luke 18 that we read as a
[39:23] text. I want to lay this and so now the
[39:26] text speaks of a parable of an unjust
[39:30] judge. It what what this does in this
[39:33] parable is basically takes an extreme
[39:36] example of a judge that's very distant,
[39:40] very detached. Uh it says he doesn't he
[39:43] doesn't revere God. He doesn't rever
[39:46] man. He's insensitive. He He's He He
[39:50] doesn't want to have a hands-on with the
[39:52] people's problems at all. And so, the
[39:55] scripture goes to an extreme to show
[39:57] this unjust judge is completely detached
[40:00] to wanting to meet a need of this
[40:02] nobody, this little widow woman. He's
[40:04] completely detached from it. And and uh
[40:06] it it takes it to an extreme of a judge
[40:10] that's very distant, unreachable, and no
[40:14] fear of God, and didn't regard man. Of
[40:16] course, that's not our God. Uh he's not
[40:18] that way. He's a just God. How many
[40:21] believe he's a just God? He's a just
[40:23] judge and he is a judge. But we're
[40:25] learning in this series, thank God, he's
[40:27] a God who cares.
[40:30] So, he's a just God, but he's a God who
[40:32] cares. And and so you say, well, why
[40:36] does this parable speak of this this
[40:38] woman, a type of the bride, coming to
[40:40] this unjust judge? because I believe
[40:42] it's using an extreme of a completely
[40:45] detached uh uh God or judge who doesn't
[40:49] care. And I'm wondering if it's put in
[40:51] the Bible that way because that's the
[40:53] way people will begin to view
[40:57] God. So, it goes to this way that's
[40:59] extreme in this parable to say he's
[41:02] unjust. He doesn't fear God. He doesn't
[41:05] care. He's he he doesn't he's not going
[41:08] to listen to anybody who knocks on the
[41:10] door at all. He don't have any time for
[41:12] it. And that's the way people start to
[41:14] feel with God. And so that's why they
[41:17] give up so quickly because they think
[41:21] God can't supernaturally come in or
[41:23] they're unworthy for God to do something
[41:26] or somehow uh he's not going to listen
[41:29] to me or I knocked one time and he
[41:31] didn't respond so I'm giving up. But God
[41:35] does not want you to give up.
[41:37] I said God doesn't want you to give up.
[41:41] And so the people got this the it's the
[41:43] way people look at God today. They feel
[41:45] so far away. They feel so unworthy to
[41:48] get his attention. Now when you got a
[41:50] widow, you have a widow, it's someone
[41:52] who doesn't have a husband. She she has
[41:54] no advocate. She has no protector. She
[41:58] has no head. She actually has nothing.
[42:00] She can't help herself. That's a widow
[42:02] in the Bible. she has no she has nothing
[42:04] left. A lot of times in most cases
[42:06] they're poor because they don't have
[42:07] anybody to support them. So a widow
[42:10] represents someone who's helpless. In
[42:12] other words, they don't have money. They
[42:14] don't have position. They they've lost
[42:17] uh their position, their identity with
[42:19] their husband because their husband's
[42:20] gone. And so they've lost everything
[42:22] that would be an earthly way for her to
[42:24] have any credibility to come before this
[42:27] judge. She doesn't have anything to get
[42:30] her in the front door. nothing. And God
[42:33] uses that as a type of the bride in the
[42:36] last days. Let me tell you friends,
[42:38] we're helpless without him.
[42:41] Come on, why don't you agree with me?
[42:43] We're helpless without him. The problems
[42:45] that are facing us today, we're helpless
[42:47] without this great God to come on the
[42:49] scene. And that's why we'll learn to be
[42:51] more dependent on him, more dependent on
[42:53] a supernatural God, more dependent on
[42:55] finances. Can you say amen? It's a good
[42:58] thing that we're pressured because we
[42:59] learn how to pray more. We learn how to
[43:01] depend on him more instead of depending
[43:03] on our own plans.
[43:06] He wants us to be dependent on him. So
[43:09] this widow is someone who has no
[43:10] husband, has no advocate, no protector.
[43:12] She has nothing. She can't help herself.
[43:15] She And then she can't stand up to her
[43:18] enemy uh by herself. She has no power
[43:21] against her adversary. She's helpless to
[43:25] this adversary. I don't know who was
[43:27] bothering her and badgering her,
[43:28] probably trying to steal from her, take
[43:31] advantage of her and but she had an
[43:33] adversary and she had she was powerless
[43:36] for somebody to deal with that adversary
[43:38] and she said, "I'm going to have to try
[43:40] to go to a higher power because I can't
[43:42] deal with my adversary myself." Is
[43:45] anybody listening to me here tonight?
[43:47] You're in a good spot when you're
[43:49] helpless. Amen. You're in a good spot
[43:51] when you say, "I'm going to have to go
[43:53] to I can't go to any other place but to
[43:55] God about this." Somebody say, "Praise
[43:57] the Lord." You're in a good when nothing
[43:59] but a miracle will do. My sister Sherry
[44:01] say, "You get in spots when there'll be
[44:03] when nothing but a miracle will do."
[44:07] Hallelujah. So, she appeals to the
[44:09] higher court to bring vengeance on her
[44:12] enemy or it's called in scripture, her
[44:14] adversary. Hey, we have an adversary.
[44:18] That's right. the devil going about
[44:21] seeking whom he may devour.
[44:25] We have the same adversary. Can you say
[44:27] amen? We had this is the bribe. This is
[44:29] the type of bride. We have an adversary.
[44:31] And many times we're helpless against
[44:34] this adversary. And she appeals to the
[44:36] highest court, this judge. And she
[44:39] didn't know, I don't know how I'm going
[44:40] to to get through to him, but it's the
[44:43] only power that I can go to to deal with
[44:46] this adversary. It's the only one that I
[44:49] can appeal to, but I'm going to go do
[44:51] it. I have no money. I have no prestige.
[44:54] I have no husband. I have no but I'm
[44:57] going to go to him and I'm going to ask
[44:59] anyway.
[45:01] Many times, friends, we're helpless. But
[45:04] she did not come just one time. The
[45:07] parable is something deeper than just
[45:09] her coming one time. She didn't come one
[45:12] time, but
[45:14] she she came over and over and over and
[45:19] over again. She didn't give up.
[45:23] The first few times she came, he didn't
[45:25] even listen. He didn't she He didn't
[45:27] even hear her. He didn't even bring her
[45:29] in. He didn't let her in. But she kept
[45:31] knocking. She kept presenting her case
[45:34] to the servant, whoever, however she did
[45:36] it. And she kept and she didn't give up.
[45:39] There's a key here that we must see. And
[45:41] I know it might be simple to you
[45:42] tonight, but we need to not just nod and
[45:44] say, "Amen." We need to live this out
[45:46] every day. That she wearied this judge
[45:50] by what? One thing? Her continual coming
[45:53] to him. I'm not giving up. I'm not
[45:56] taking no for an answer.
[45:59] Now, I know that God says no sometimes
[46:01] to certain things. We should be happy
[46:03] with, brother, we should happy with his
[46:05] yeses or nos. But when we're talking
[46:06] about deliverance and we know God could
[46:08] do it, our duty is to stand there with
[46:10] all faith and keep saying, "Listen,
[46:12] Lord, I'm going to keep coming to you
[46:14] and believe that you can do this."
[46:18] Hallelujah. So, she came not one time,
[46:21] but she and and just gave up after one
[46:24] time. There's a key must we must see
[46:26] here. If we really want help, we're
[46:30] going to be desperate. We're going to be
[46:32] perseverant. And that's how we show that
[46:35] we really care.
[46:40] We're not to faint. And that's what he
[46:41] says at the beginning of the parable. He
[46:43] says, "Men ought always to pray." In
[46:46] other words, you didn't just pray,
[46:48] "Lord, please help me with this." And
[46:50] you don't visit it again. Men are always
[46:52] to pray and not faint. What does the
[46:57] word faint mean? I'm glad you asked.
[47:03] Men are to pray always and not faint. It
[47:06] can refer in the physical to physical
[47:10] exhaustion. Physical
[47:12] exhaustion. And we we can't sometimes we
[47:15] don't have a choice in that. We just are
[47:17] physically exhausted. And so that's and
[47:20] then somebody faints. But then in the
[47:22] spiritual it means a spirit that comes
[47:26] into discouragement. It's a
[47:28] discouragement of your spirit to give
[47:31] up.
[47:33] That's
[47:34] fainting. Oh, do we have a lot of that
[47:36] today? Giving up on God. Giving up on
[47:40] the message. Seen too much. Their
[47:43] spirit. And it actually happens
[47:44] sometimes internally for months and
[47:47] years before you see an outward
[47:49] expression. I'm through with this. I'm
[47:51] throwing up my hands. For years, they
[47:53] give up in their spirit and they're let
[47:55] down. And so, they faint in their
[47:57] spirit. Exhaustion. They they faint out.
[47:59] They uh that's why the Bible says be not
[48:02] weary and welloing for in due season you
[48:04] shall reap if you faint not.
[48:08] Uh they that wait upon the Lord shall
[48:11] renew their strength. They shall mount
[48:14] up with wings as eagles and they shall
[48:16] not faint. Can you say amen? So there's
[48:18] a strength by this continual coming,
[48:21] this continual laying before God. And so
[48:23] but this discouragement of spirit is
[48:25] what faint means. And uh when people get
[48:28] a discouragement in their spirit, that's
[48:30] the worst thing because they they
[48:32] quickly couldn't quit trying. They quit
[48:34] trying. They quit praying. They quit
[48:37] trying. They they there there's there's
[48:39] they're just I've tried this. And she
[48:42] meant businesses was not going to give
[48:44] up. This widow was not going to give up.
[48:46] She meant business and she showed she
[48:48] cared. And she actually wearied the
[48:50] judge by her continual coming. She just
[48:54] kept, you know, she showed up at the
[48:58] court. She showed up at his
[49:00] house. She showed up when he was working
[49:03] out at the
[49:04] gym. She showed up every, you know, they
[49:07] say there's a saying in the world says
[49:09] 90% of success is just showing up. I
[49:12] said that at Johnny's wedding. Remember
[49:14] that? Remember that? See, because
[49:16] wherever, what's her name? Samantha.
[49:19] where when he was dating, wherever she
[49:21] would move, Tucson, whatever, he moved
[49:23] there,
[49:24] too. And so I said that in their wedding
[49:26] and 90% of success is just showing up.
[49:28] And Johnny just kept showing up. He was
[49:31] there, buddy. And he got the girl. Got a
[49:34] gym, too. But 90% of success is just
[49:37] showing up. And this widow kept showing
[49:40] up. I'm still here. He's going, "Is she
[49:43] is that the same woman? She's been
[49:46] coming for months now. She's at my door
[49:48] again. I'm She's actually frustrating
[49:52] and she's making the judge weary. She
[49:55] wasn't weary. She's making the judge
[49:58] weary by her continual coming until
[50:01] finally she brings out an unjust judge
[50:06] who doesn't care for man, doesn't fear
[50:08] God, so distant from the from this need,
[50:12] it doesn't matter. She by her faith
[50:16] draws the power of this judge out to the
[50:19] front door and says, "Bring her in. I'll
[50:21] talk to her. I'll avenge her enemy."
[50:24] It shows what faith can do. It shows but
[50:28] faith that is uh relentless. Continue
[50:31] coming, continue bringing it. I'm not
[50:34] going to give up. That's the kind of
[50:35] faith that God wants to see. Can you say
[50:38] amen? Wherever he was, she came after
[50:40] him, showing him and showing up in front
[50:43] of him and saying, "You are my only hope
[50:46] and I mean business. I'm not going away
[50:49] until I get through to see him." And
[50:52] finally, she pulled a distant judge on
[50:55] the scene. She kept showing up until he
[50:59] showed up. Oh, put that on the
[51:01] refrigerator. She kept showing up until
[51:03] he showed up.
[51:07] Amen. Praise the Lord, preacher. I don't
[51:09] get any amens. I'm amen myself. She kept
[51:12] showing up. I'm going to write a song
[51:14] tonight. She kept showing up until he
[51:16] showed up.
[51:18] Amen. Praise the Lord. See, I don't like
[51:21] to say those song ideas because some of
[51:23] my family members steal it before I get
[51:25] to it. Takes me a while to write the
[51:27] song. She kept showing up until he
[51:30] showed up. And when he showed up, he
[51:34] dealt with her adversary.
[51:37] He dealt with her enemy.
[51:40] He dealt with whatever it is that we're
[51:43] asking God for deliverance from. Can you
[51:45] say amen? This is a parable also of the
[51:48] coming of the Lord. It fits the coming
[51:50] of the Lord because he said, "Will he
[51:52] find this kind of faith when he comes?"
[51:55] He needs this kind of faith, rapturing
[51:59] faith, relentless faith, consistent. I'm
[52:03] staying with it. A lot of people giving
[52:04] up today, but there's a bride who's not
[52:06] given up. You know what Jesus says? If
[52:08] you continue until the end, if you
[52:11] continue in my word, not the ones who
[52:13] begin in the message, the ones who
[52:15] continue in the word and end it.
[52:18] These are my disciples.
[52:21] I'm not I'm not going anywhere, friends.
[52:23] By the grace of God, I have no to whom
[52:27] shall we go? I am feeding on the words
[52:29] of eternal life.
[52:32] If I have failure, if I have successes,
[52:34] it doesn't matter. It doesn't jeopardize
[52:37] me standing before this Lord and me
[52:39] serving him and remaining faithful. And
[52:42] I think I said a few months ago, even if
[52:44] even if something doesn't happen quick
[52:46] enough, even if we don't see something,
[52:49] we go for months and don't see something
[52:51] supernatural, it doesn't matter. We're
[52:53] not going to work it up, but we're going
[52:54] to stand flatfooted against the enemy,
[52:56] believe this word, and wait for the
[52:59] supernatural God to show up in his own
[53:01] way.
[53:03] God needs to see us
[53:05] unmovable. Satan needs to see us
[53:07] unmovable.
[53:09] Satan hates to see us unmovable.
[53:12] God needs to see it. The judge needs to
[53:14] see it. And she pulled this distant
[53:16] judge on the scene and she kept showing
[53:17] up until he showed up. And so the coming
[53:19] of the Lord, will he find this kind of
[53:22] woman? Will he find this bride at the
[53:26] end? Will he find this kind of faith?
[53:28] What kind of faith? Not just the faith
[53:30] for just just a temporary faith and then
[53:33] you're out serving the world. No, this
[53:35] continual coming before him. I'm still
[53:37] here after 25, 30, 40 years. I'm still
[53:41] here serving the Lord and I'm still
[53:43] praying about things that I don't have
[53:44] yet, but I'm not going anywhere. I'm
[53:46] still holding it before the Lord. Amen.
[53:48] Let him see that kind of faith.
[53:51] Unmovable, not giving up, not taking no
[53:54] for an answer. Can you say amen? This
[53:57] casual half-hazard
[54:00] leotan way of Christians
[54:03] today, whatever will be kra surah,
[54:07] whatever will be type of religion will
[54:10] never call a supernatural God on the
[54:12] scene. Can I say it again? this casual
[54:15] laidback leodian Christian saying
[54:19] whatever will be will
[54:21] be will never call the supernatural God
[54:24] on the scene. Well, I've tried that and
[54:26] it didn't work. I tried to come to the
[54:28] altar and didn't work. I tried to ask
[54:30] God for this and it didn't work. So,
[54:32] that was it. It was over. And I find
[54:35] people try to mechanically put things
[54:37] together in their own mind and when they
[54:39] try it because it didn't come together
[54:40] like them. I tried that and you know
[54:42] what they do next? I'm going to go try
[54:44] something else.
[54:46] That's where we're trapped. You'll find
[54:47] it in the message. He cares to you care.
[54:49] As he goes into it, he says, "Now, not
[54:51] everybody, not everybody accepts this
[54:54] comforter. Not everybody accepts this
[54:56] God who cares. And when they don't,
[54:58] they'll get another comforter.
[55:00] We'll break all those things down. They
[55:03] get another comforter to fill the place
[55:05] of a God who cares. They'll accept
[55:08] something else to cover their heart, to
[55:10] hold But you see now we don't we we need
[55:13] uh we need more than just say well I
[55:15] tried that it didn't work. I tried to
[55:17] ask God for this for the Holy Ghost and
[55:19] it didn't work so I quit after
[55:21] that. You you you mean it didn't it
[55:25] didn't happen quick enough is what you
[55:26] mean. It didn't happen quick enough for
[55:28] you and when you went on to something
[55:30] else you went on to another comforter.
[55:33] You went on to money. You went on to
[55:35] position. You went on to some guilty
[55:37] pleasure that you do privately. You're
[55:39] drawing comfort from that instead of
[55:42] staying with God and continuing to grow
[55:43] in God. You never really let God deal
[55:47] with your heart issues.
[55:50] Why? We're just not desperate enough
[55:52] sometimes to step into those scary muddy
[55:56] waters and wash. Can you say
[56:00] amen? People aren't desperate enough to
[56:02] step into those those muddy waters. And
[56:05] it's muddy sometimes. It's painful
[56:07] sometimes. And it's it's a painful
[56:09] journey sometimes, but I just encourage
[56:11] you, you know, I'm here as your pastor.
[56:13] Let's go through it together. Let's do
[56:15] it. Let's tackle this enemy.
[56:18] Let's uh if you don't have trust in me
[56:20] or something, trust someone. Get a
[56:22] brother. Get a hold of God. Go. Don't
[56:25] let the devil continue to hinder. Why
[56:27] would you want to go on wasting more
[56:29] years of your life with your heart all
[56:31] locked up? Can I say it again? Why do
[56:34] you want to waste more years? How about
[56:36] let's tackle the enemy? How about let's
[56:38] go before the judge and say, "Lord,
[56:40] would you deal with my adversary so I
[56:42] can live the rest of my life free in my
[56:44] heart? Let's do it. I'm here as your
[56:47] pastor. Let's do it together. Whatever
[56:48] we have to do, let's tackle it. Can you
[56:51] say amen?" So, here's the examples and
[56:52] the quotes brother gives from He Cares,
[56:55] Do You Care? And it's the first two
[56:56] examples that I'm bringing in this theme
[56:58] tonight. And then I'm going to draw a
[57:00] close here now. I'm bringing this theme
[57:02] of desperation. So, he says here at the
[57:04] beginning, he cares, do you care? Now I
[57:06] was thinking of him caring last
[57:08] evening. Somehow strangely, and this is
[57:10] the first thing he starts to bring up is
[57:12] these incidents. I was led by the Holy
[57:14] Spirit. I went and started up the
[57:15] highway which my wife and my family
[57:17] sitting back there knows it's to be
[57:19] true. And somehow strangely, I turned
[57:21] around and went back to a place, a
[57:22] motel. And then strangely, I went to a
[57:25] place where I had made an odd turn.
[57:27] Instead of turning around there, I went
[57:28] up to make a turn. The lights flashed on
[57:31] a lovely uh couples on the outside. two
[57:34] fine young ladies that I had just
[57:37] married uh to two fine young ministers.
[57:40] Stop right there. So, this happened in
[57:42] Jeffersonville. He married two fine
[57:44] young ministers and their wives. They
[57:46] were just newly married. And so, he
[57:48] married them. And so then uh what
[57:50] happened was as they headed I believe to
[57:52] New York, Satan after he seen the
[57:55] minister, one of them his ministry being
[57:57] set and he took a life's companion right
[58:01] here at this
[58:02] altar. They went away happily on their
[58:05] honeymoon and the enemy jumped onto this
[58:08] young man. And I'm saying this to
[58:11] express what I'm saying. Does he care?
[58:14] Somehow with faith that would not take
[58:17] no, they turned and re returned back
[58:20] here knowing after they was all the way
[58:23] over way in the east here somewhere on
[58:25] their honeymoon. Stop right there.
[58:27] They're on their You know what the devil
[58:29] I mean? He doesn't care you're on your
[58:31] honeymoon. He doesn't care about
[58:34] happiness in marriage. He doesn't care
[58:36] that you just had a a joyous thing
[58:39] happen. That's really the time he's
[58:41] going to bring a complex over your life.
[58:43] something you did wrong from the past.
[58:45] And that's what happened here is Satan
[58:48] jumped on that guy with some
[58:50] condemnation from a complex that
[58:53] happened. Something he did. We don't
[58:55] know all the details, but we know the
[58:56] devil jumped on him. And now they on
[58:59] their honeymoon are not happy anymore.
[59:01] They're struggling with something that
[59:03] Satan was condemning them about. Isn't
[59:05] that just like the devil?
[59:09] Guess what? This is the point I'm
[59:11] getting to, and brother Bram's bringing
[59:13] it out. They turned the car around on
[59:15] their honeymoon and headed back to
[59:17] Jeffersonville with no guarantee they
[59:19] could see or get an interview, but it
[59:21] didn't matter. We're going back there
[59:23] with a faith somehow that would not take
[59:27] no. That's right. What's he laying out?
[59:30] He's laying out the kind of attitude
[59:34] that we need to have when we want help.
[59:38] When the devil's using a complex to
[59:42] condemn us, they turn that car around
[59:45] and left their honeymoon. I tell you, I
[59:48] don't know if how many people would do
[59:49] that. That's pretty important that you
[59:51] get deliverance in your heart when
[59:53] you're willing to say, "We're cutting
[59:55] the honeymoon short because it's more
[59:57] important I get deliverance over this
[1:00:00] and I get uh get victory over the enemy
[1:00:03] than finishing my honeymoon."
[1:00:07] How many of us would do that? But it's
[1:00:10] showing the kind of faith. This is more
[1:00:13] important because you're not going to
[1:00:15] have a very good marriage if the devil
[1:00:17] keeps condemning you of this complex.
[1:00:19] So, what's more important? Let's get to
[1:00:21] the bottom of this. Let's get back to
[1:00:23] God's prophet. Let's find out what this
[1:00:25] is. Is anybody listening here? That's
[1:00:27] right. When you put a high priority of
[1:00:30] what the devil's beating you up over
[1:00:32] your whole life and you're really ready
[1:00:34] to say, "I care about getting
[1:00:35] deliverance over this." God can tell
[1:00:37] that and he's going to bring a
[1:00:39] deliverance.
[1:00:41] Way in their ease here somewhere on
[1:00:42] their honeymoon. Next one. Returned back
[1:00:45] and was sitting waiting. And I walked in
[1:00:48] fine handsome young man. I imagine he
[1:00:50] walked into their motel room. his wife
[1:00:52] sitting on the outside crying her and
[1:00:55] their and their little companion. So the
[1:00:57] other man and their brother coming
[1:00:59] running which is a friend of this young
[1:01:01] man. So both couples came back saying oh
[1:01:03] brother Brandham such and such has
[1:01:05] happened. Went there and seen this
[1:01:08] handsome young man sitting there just in
[1:01:11] the peak of his life a leader of young
[1:01:14] men sitting there and Satan bound him.
[1:01:18] He's a minister. He's just newly
[1:01:20] married. was free. At least he felt free
[1:01:23] as anything. The devil brings something
[1:01:25] up and now he's not free
[1:01:27] anymore. There's no mention in here
[1:01:29] whether he has the Holy Ghost or not.
[1:01:31] He's got the Holy Ghost. But the devil
[1:01:34] is using something to defeat him.
[1:01:38] Just in the peak of his life, leader
[1:01:40] were young man sitting there and Satan
[1:01:41] bound to him. He never noticed. But I
[1:01:43] took my hand to shake hands with his
[1:01:44] hand and to see if some disease had
[1:01:46] plagued him. But there was no sign of
[1:01:48] vibration. So it's not a physical
[1:01:50] disease. come right out of the room from
[1:01:52] praying and fasting and waiting on the
[1:01:53] Lord. The anointing of the Holy Spirit
[1:01:55] was there and that's why it led us. You
[1:01:57] see, and then seeing the shadow of
[1:02:00] darkness over him, I never said what I
[1:02:02] was doing, but in less than a couple of
[1:02:05] moments time, it was all gone.
[1:02:09] The coldness of his hands had left.
[1:02:13] He was shouting and praising God a few
[1:02:16] minutes to find himself. Took a few
[1:02:19] minutes to find himself. He's really
[1:02:20] shouting. He lost track of himself. He's
[1:02:23] feeling so free. But I want you to look
[1:02:25] at this now. I want you to a shadow of
[1:02:27] darkness over him because of that
[1:02:30] complex and that devil defeating him.
[1:02:32] But in less than a couple moments time,
[1:02:33] it was all gone. The coldness of his
[1:02:35] hands. Now when he would grab their
[1:02:36] hand, second pole, he could tell, excuse
[1:02:39] me, the first pole, he could tell but
[1:02:41] what disease by the color that came in
[1:02:43] brother Brandham's hand. How many
[1:02:44] remember that? We're believers here. So
[1:02:45] I can be open about this here. He he but
[1:02:48] this was not a color a disease but there
[1:02:51] was a coldness in his hands. There was a
[1:02:53] nervousness and when he was delivered
[1:02:55] and it was
[1:02:57] exposed within a couple minutes the
[1:02:59] coldness of his hands left he was
[1:03:00] shouting and praising God a few minutes
[1:03:02] to find himself. And here they sit right
[1:03:05] here this morning sitting in the
[1:03:07] audience. See how Satan was trying to
[1:03:10] upset that man by referring him to of
[1:03:13] some complex to be built back, which the
[1:03:17] Holy Spirit knew. And I seen it by the
[1:03:20] vision of the Lord. But God cared for
[1:03:24] that man. God cared for that young boy.
[1:03:30] He cares about cancer. He cares about
[1:03:32] physical disease. He cares to
[1:03:34] supernaturally change and kill the
[1:03:37] curses that come on the physical body.
[1:03:39] But he also cares about complexes.
[1:03:43] He cares about anything the devil is
[1:03:44] using to defeat you and makes you feel
[1:03:47] like you're less and take your joy away.
[1:03:51] God cares to set you free from that.
[1:03:54] Somebody all shout, "Praise the Lord."
[1:03:57] Hallelujah. Now he goes to another
[1:04:00] incident. All right. Next one. Just
[1:04:03] coming in a few minutes ago, a lady, I
[1:04:05] see her sitting here in the aisle. It's
[1:04:07] the same service now, just got her a
[1:04:09] seat somewhere and way down. She said,
[1:04:11] "Nine years, brother Brandon, I've tried
[1:04:13] to get a hold of you." And she said,
[1:04:14] "I'm so desperate. I I here late and
[1:04:18] couldn't even get a prayer card to be in
[1:04:19] the line." So, so nine years trying to
[1:04:22] get an interview to talk to Brother
[1:04:24] Brandham about this. A lady moved back
[1:04:27] and she said, "Brother Brandham, just a
[1:04:28] word with you." standing there, a vision
[1:04:30] broke over this finel looking young
[1:04:32] woman and see that her heart was
[1:04:34] burdened and she was trying to work to
[1:04:37] make a living and a great thing happened
[1:04:40] back way back in the time of her
[1:04:42] parents. Stop right there. No, go back.
[1:04:46] A great thing happened back way back in
[1:04:49] the time of her parents. Now can you
[1:04:51] imagine friends we don't know the
[1:04:52] details of this but I just want to bring
[1:04:54] out something
[1:04:56] happened way back during the time of her
[1:04:59] parents it went back a few years and it
[1:05:02] was still affecting her we don't know
[1:05:04] physically we don't I know one place
[1:05:05] brother said about a woman she had heart
[1:05:09] trouble but it wasn't physical heart
[1:05:10] trouble it was spiritual heart trouble
[1:05:13] God cares about all of it but he says he
[1:05:17] says it was back in the time of her
[1:05:19] parents showing knowing God cares. And
[1:05:22] this might be in relation to what I
[1:05:24] might get into just a little bit in
[1:05:27] teaching about what I've been mentioning
[1:05:29] and get into it more specifically
[1:05:32] because in the middle of this
[1:05:34] message, Brother Brandham gets
[1:05:36] into science and how science can
[1:05:40] actually be a hindrance. Science can be
[1:05:42] a hindrance to the supernatural God.
[1:05:44] Science can try to prove this. But then
[1:05:46] many times he refers to studying books
[1:05:48] and learning and talking to doctors
[1:05:51] sometimes about how physical sicknesses
[1:05:55] goes back to something with a problem
[1:05:58] with the heart.
[1:06:02] I'm reading a few reading a few books
[1:06:04] and you talk about discovering it now.
[1:06:06] They're really discovering it. But if
[1:06:08] you have, as I mentioned, some some type
[1:06:10] of abnormal, I'll call it abnormal thing
[1:06:14] that happened in your childhood or as
[1:06:16] brother Steve was speaking a few weeks
[1:06:18] ago, somewhat of a trauma that happened
[1:06:20] that was not supposed to happen against
[1:06:22] your spirit, then it gets lodged in your
[1:06:25] system. It gets lodged not only in your
[1:06:27] memory, it can get lodged, especially if
[1:06:29] you're a kid, gets lodged in your
[1:06:32] memory, cellular system. Then it becomes
[1:06:36] a belief system because there's a lie
[1:06:38] that goes with it that says I must not
[1:06:41] be worthy enough. This must have
[1:06:43] happened to me because I'm not worthy
[1:06:46] and God doesn't care. All these thoughts
[1:06:48] go back. So then the worst part is you
[1:06:50] can have lies of the enemy. But when you
[1:06:53] believe those lies then you bring stress
[1:06:56] in your body and then stress turns into
[1:07:01] physical ailments. Right? Most of
[1:07:04] physical ailments comes from a stress
[1:07:06] that you're not supposed to have there
[1:07:07] in your spirit and your heart and your
[1:07:09] body. And they proved it by science.
[1:07:11] It's it's it's it's something that's
[1:07:13] making your body tense in the prayer
[1:07:15] lines. He says this happened to you and
[1:07:18] that's why you have your nervous problem
[1:07:20] because the body's all tensed up trying
[1:07:22] to deal with that and trying to and then
[1:07:25] God delivers them and they're free. So
[1:07:28] there's one part of it brother Steve
[1:07:30] brought up a few weeks ago. When we when
[1:07:34] we start to believe that lie about
[1:07:36] ourselves and we start it it gets
[1:07:39] ingrained in our minds and our belief
[1:07:41] system, we have a lack of belief that
[1:07:44] God can do something and we have a wall
[1:07:46] up towards God. God has to break down
[1:07:50] that wall. We have a wall in our heart.
[1:07:53] And not only this, brother Steve says,
[1:07:54] you develop an
[1:07:56] oath. You take an oath to yourself. I
[1:08:00] will never do this again. I will never
[1:08:02] be around a person like that again. We
[1:08:05] take
[1:08:06] oaths. This preacher hurt me, so I will
[1:08:09] never trust another preacher again. We
[1:08:12] take an oath. And that's worse than just
[1:08:14] a lie because you've taken and I'm
[1:08:16] standing by. What you do is you lock up
[1:08:17] your heart because the next minister
[1:08:19] might be God using that minister to help
[1:08:21] you, but you've taken an oath. I will
[1:08:24] never I'll never get close to my kids
[1:08:26] again. I I'll never uh trust a a father
[1:08:30] figure again because of what my father
[1:08:31] did. All these oaths that we take and
[1:08:34] their lies and God has to come and just
[1:08:36] dispel all of that and say, "Wait a
[1:08:38] minute. Wait a minute. I need you to not
[1:08:40] trust men right now. I need you to trust
[1:08:41] me. Trust God."
[1:08:44] And when they begin to trust God and
[1:08:45] release it, then their trust develops
[1:08:48] that there are some good fathers. There
[1:08:51] are some good men. Remember brother
[1:08:53] Steve saying, "I don't trust any men.
[1:08:55] I've never seen a good man. I'm never
[1:08:57] getting
[1:08:58] married. They take an oath. But when God
[1:09:01] comes on the scene, he develops a trust.
[1:09:04] There's some good men out there. There's
[1:09:06] some Holy Ghost fil men." And so you get
[1:09:08] free in your heart to uh all right I'll
[1:09:12] go out and have coffee with a guy okay
[1:09:14] with a good brother trying to make a
[1:09:17] living and a great thing happened way
[1:09:18] back in that time. Let's go to the next
[1:09:19] one that had caused this great thing to
[1:09:22] happen to her and the Lord Jesus
[1:09:23] revealed it and showed what it was and
[1:09:25] there in a moment's time took it from
[1:09:29] the woman. You know it's it's like nine
[1:09:32] years but one moment in the presence of
[1:09:35] the Lord. That's it. She didn't have to
[1:09:38] go through a theological seminar.
[1:09:42] The right setting with a heart that's
[1:09:44] saying, "I'm desperate. I've been doing
[1:09:46] this nine years. I'm still coming to
[1:09:48] desperate and I got this moment." And
[1:09:50] she said, "Brother Brandham, could you
[1:09:51] speak to me? A vision broke. In a
[1:09:53] moment, it's over." How many believe God
[1:09:55] can still do that? How many believe God
[1:09:56] is still a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:09:58] intents of our Yeah. through the level
[1:10:00] of the word today, he can discern our
[1:10:02] hearts. Yeah. He can expose the devil
[1:10:05] the and the defeat that this devil's
[1:10:07] putting you under. So in one it happened
[1:10:09] and the Lord Jesus revealed it and
[1:10:10] showed what is and there in a moment's
[1:10:11] time took it from the woman. She went
[1:10:14] around rejoicing and now sitting here in
[1:10:16] the audience with us now rejoicing with
[1:10:19] tears as she's wiping her eyes now
[1:10:23] knowing that the truth of the thing was
[1:10:25] made known. I say praise the Lord.
[1:10:32] So, what was it? Desperation.
[1:10:36] It was perseverance.
[1:10:39] It was I've been coming eight years. I'm
[1:10:41] going to go keep coming. I'm going to
[1:10:43] try to find God. It's said, I'm on our
[1:10:45] honeymoon, but I've got to go back and
[1:10:47] find find that source because this is
[1:10:50] important to me. It's desperation. It's
[1:10:53] the continual coming that got to the
[1:10:55] judge's heart to say, "She's wearing me
[1:10:58] by her coming. I'm going to step out and
[1:11:01] I'm going to deal with her adversary."
[1:11:03] Praise be to God. Don't you love him
[1:11:05] tonight? Don't you want to be free? I
[1:11:08] want to be completely free. Lord, if
[1:11:10] there's anything there that the devil
[1:11:11] shield using, show it to me. Release me
[1:11:14] of it. Let me be a free. Free in my
[1:11:16] heart, free in my soul, free in my
[1:11:18] spirit, free in my mind. I want that.
[1:11:21] And if they're not there tonight, then
[1:11:22] listen, I'm giving you hope. I'm giving
[1:11:24] you hope in the Lord that you keep
[1:11:26] coming to him. You keep being honest
[1:11:28] before him. You keep a sincere
[1:11:30] confession and honesty before him. God
[1:11:33] has a blessing in mind for you. Praise
[1:11:36] be to God. Let's stand
[1:11:38] together. Our precious Lord, we
[1:11:41] are so grateful, Lord, for the message
[1:11:45] this past Sunday by our brother. It was
[1:11:48] a blessing, Lord, to see you confirm
[1:11:50] what you're speaking to the people. And
[1:11:53] Lord, we we feel, Lord, unworthy of such
[1:11:55] things. And yet, this is the word that
[1:11:57] you have blessed us with that you send
[1:11:59] us a clear message that with the right
[1:12:02] desperation in the heart. Lord, you care
[1:12:05] about every issue, every detail of our
[1:12:08] lives. Lord, I pray that it would build
[1:12:10] up the faith of the people. Faith cometh
[1:12:13] by hearing and hearing by the word of
[1:12:15] God. And Lord, we first of all say if
[1:12:17] there is any hindrances in our life, if
[1:12:19] there's anything between us and you, if
[1:12:22] there's any hold that we have holding
[1:12:24] back, we don't want to hold back. We
[1:12:26] don't we want to trust you, Lord. We
[1:12:28] want to we don't want to put any walls
[1:12:30] up towards you or towards the body of
[1:12:32] Christ. We want to trust in you, Lord.
[1:12:34] And so, Father, would you just help the
[1:12:36] our congregation and those that are
[1:12:38] listening there at home tonight,
[1:12:40] wherever they may be, maybe on the video
[1:12:42] labor, uh the video later, I pray,
[1:12:45] Father, that you go to that person
[1:12:46] you're speaking to just now, Lord. May
[1:12:49] they offer up, Lord, a heart like Lord
[1:12:52] uh that that non that says, "I'm going
[1:12:55] to go dip seven times. I'm going to wash
[1:12:57] seven times. I'm going to go through the
[1:12:59] muddy waters he wants me to go through,
[1:13:01] no matter how painful it is. I'm I'm
[1:13:04] gonna be like this little woman and I'm
[1:13:06] going to keep knocking. I'm going to
[1:13:07] keep asking. I'm going to keep coming
[1:13:09] before him. And though he would look
[1:13:11] like he's turning me away, I'm going to
[1:13:13] keep coming to him. Lord, may we offer
[1:13:15] up that kind of faith? And you even said
[1:13:18] when you come back, will you find that
[1:13:20] kind of faith on the earth? It'll be
[1:13:23] rare, Lord. Obviously, by the parable,
[1:13:25] it'll be rare to find that kind of faith
[1:13:28] in that widow woman, but let me be one
[1:13:30] of them, Lord. Let me bring that kind of
[1:13:33] faith, that trust, that consistency that
[1:13:36] that that won't take no for an answer.
[1:13:39] Oh God, create in me a strength, Lord,
[1:13:42] that I would believe when there all the
[1:13:45] signs say there's nothing going to
[1:13:47] happen. There's nothing going to step
[1:13:49] in. May I believe it anyway. Like our
[1:13:51] father Abraham, he who against hope
[1:13:54] believed in hope. He who against the
[1:13:56] doctors believed something greater than
[1:13:58] the doctors. He Lord who's standing
[1:14:01] there for many 75 years believing the
[1:14:04] promise and he have a child Lord. He
[1:14:06] stood there firm. That's the kind of
[1:14:08] faith we want like our father Abraham.
[1:14:11] Bless the saints of God with the
[1:14:13] maturity from the teaching of the word.
[1:14:16] May we grow in faith. May we grow in
[1:14:18] strength. May we grow in consistency.
[1:14:21] This is your faithful bride. And if
[1:14:22] we're to be called faithful, then we
[1:14:25] want to be consistent and faithful,
[1:14:27] holding on to the word of God through
[1:14:30] thick and thin. Grant strength, Lord,
[1:14:32] through your word, and we commit it to
[1:14:34] you in Jesus name. Amen. Praise the
[1:14:37] Lord. I just love him so much tonight. I
[1:14:40] love the word. I'm thankful for what
[1:14:43] he's done in my life. Are you thankful
[1:14:44] what he's done in your life? You're here
[1:14:46] tonight by his grace. You're here
[1:14:48] tonight by his grace. And you got a God
[1:14:51] who really, really cares. He cares. Do
[1:14:54] you care? Praise the Lord. I don't know
[1:14:56] what to sing. I like God has given us
[1:14:57] the victory because it's already done.
[1:15:00] Can you say amen?
[1:15:02] God has given us the victory. Let's sing
[1:15:05] it with a faith in our hearts
[1:15:08] tonight. Oh, God has given us
[1:15:14] [Music]

[1:15:26] might, God has given

[1:15:36] victory. God has given us the victory.

[1:16:11] us. Yeah. Peace of
[1:16:14] mind. Oh, peace of
[1:16:17] mind. You know, God has already given us
[1:16:21] his peace of mind. Oh, peace of
[1:16:25] mind. Peace of
[1:16:28] mind. God has given us his peace of
[1:16:32] mind. One more. God has given us
[1:16:37] overwhelming
[1:16:39] joy. God, thank you Lord for your joy,
[1:16:42] Lord. Thank you for your joy. By the
[1:16:45] word I saw the light, by the power of
[1:16:48] his might. God has given us joy, joy,
