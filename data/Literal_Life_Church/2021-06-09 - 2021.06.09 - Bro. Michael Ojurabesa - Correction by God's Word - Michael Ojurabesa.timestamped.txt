[0:02] i remember when i was taking the
[0:03] oath of allegiance i had to stand on my
[0:04] feet so if we're going to take our house
[0:06] of allegiance to you know
[0:08] no disrespect to anybody i want to sit
[0:09] down but i just feel like it's just
[0:11] respect to our lord to stand
[0:14] amen second timothy chapter 3
[0:20] verse 16. if you please with me
[0:24] it says all scriptures all scripture is
[0:26] given by inspiration of god
[0:29] profitable for doctrine for approve
[0:34] for correction for instruction
[0:38] and unrighteousness that the man of god
[0:41] may be perfect thoroughly furnished
[0:44] into all good works amen i read one more
[0:48] scripture before we see
[0:52] first peter chapter four
[1:03] 17 and 18.
[1:17] and it says for the time has come that
[1:19] judgment must begin at the house of god
[1:22] and if it first begin at us
[1:26] what shall be the end be of them
[1:29] that obey not the gospel of god
[1:32] and if the righteous scarcely be saved
[1:36] where shall the ungodly and a sinner
[1:40] up here may the lord bless the reading
[1:42] of zola what tonight
[1:44] you may be seated amen
[1:48] like i said you know you guys you know
[1:50] operate a gift you know
[1:52] saying amen to the world and pulling the
[1:53] gift is going to help me tonight so help
[1:55] me preach tonight amen
[1:56] i know we're not that much like we used
[1:58] to be on sundays but it's not about the
[1:59] people
[2:00] amen it's the fire and the people amen
[2:03] so the last time i was here i'm on
[2:05] right now the term we uh we spoke about
[2:08] um the power of correction and god's
[2:12] principle
[2:13] and if you all remember we're you know
[2:14] going i will read the same scripture the
[2:16] first scripture will happen timothy 3
[2:18] 16 to 17 about the scriptures been given
[2:21] by inspiration of god
[2:22] and it's profitable for doctrine for
[2:24] approval for correction for instruction
[2:26] and righteousness
[2:28] that the man of god who is the man of
[2:30] god us that we may be perfect
[2:32] and truly funny into good works and
[2:34] remember we talked about correction
[2:37] as to the modern day interpretation what
[2:40] the words is correction as
[2:42] and how the present word you know you
[2:44] know a line of correction
[2:46] and i remember we also talked about i'm
[2:48] just trying to give a little
[2:50] recap of what happened last time i mean
[2:52] the sermon last time so that those who
[2:54] are not here
[2:54] or those listening online can you know
[2:56] catch up amen
[2:59] and then we talk about the defensive
[3:00] response of the ward how
[3:02] nobody wants to be corrected out there
[3:04] but it's just like
[3:05] up right there they don't want you to
[3:06] tell them anything they believe they
[3:07] know everything
[3:09] and then when you try to talk to them
[3:11] they'll tell you oh even your bible
[3:13] tells us that she's not judged no man
[3:16] and they use that as uh um as an excuse
[3:18] not to listen to us being
[3:20] the correction it's supposed to take and
[3:22] now they were referring to matthew 7
[3:24] verse 1
[3:24] but that was not what the lord was
[3:26] saying there so they misinterpreted just
[3:28] to make sure they don't you don't deal
[3:29] with them
[3:31] and you know but what i always tell them
[3:33] like i said the last time i was
[3:34] discussing john garrett
[3:36] i said the same scripture first
[3:38] corinthians 2 14
[3:39] and 15 especially verse 15 says that a
[3:41] spiritual man judged
[3:43] all things so it's not him judging
[3:45] anything right now it's the spirit of
[3:46] god and him
[3:47] that's judging the word amen so we know
[3:50] better than that
[3:51] even though they say oh judge no man you
[3:52] know don't condemn no man i understand
[3:54] that but
[3:55] if the scripture cannot be against
[3:56] himself see if he says the spiritual man
[3:59] judging all things that means that
[4:00] he gets it gets the spirit of god in him
[4:02] first and when he has it
[4:04] then god and him is going to judge
[4:05] whatever is around him amen and we
[4:07] talked about that i also talked about
[4:09] the
[4:09] principle of god as opposed to what he
[4:12] believes on correction we also talk
[4:13] about
[4:14] uh correction interpersonally corruption
[4:17] and home
[4:18] we talk about correction you know um in
[4:20] the church we talk about correction
[4:22] within ourselves
[4:23] and even the church family and then you
[4:25] know we talk about ingredients of
[4:26] correction we talked about the testimony
[4:28] as you all remember we said the
[4:30] testimony is important and testimony is
[4:31] our authority
[4:33] amen and we also talked about the motive
[4:35] what's your motive incorrect and why are
[4:37] you correct and are you correcting to
[4:38] just put the
[4:39] person down or you're correcting to make
[4:42] their life better
[4:43] i corrected to uplift them i encourage
[4:46] them to raise them up from their
[4:48] their the situation and also talked
[4:50] about the approach
[4:52] how do you correct you can say certain
[4:55] word
[4:56] in a certain way and someone will listen
[4:57] to you you can say the same word another
[4:59] way and they will flare up
[5:01] so how do we correct you know we talked
[5:03] about that so well
[5:04] you know i went back to listen to the
[5:06] sermon myself you know just to you know
[5:08] because i believe i have to be fed too
[5:10] so i went there and i was listening
[5:11] while i was listening to that
[5:13] part where paul was kind of giving
[5:16] comments at the end of the sermon and i
[5:17] was talking about that
[5:18] the testimony of the authority and i was
[5:21] just
[5:21] listening to it and then something took
[5:23] my heart and said
[5:25] our testimony is our authority against
[5:28] the devil
[5:29] and the the world of darkness
[5:33] so i was like wow so i just sat down i
[5:35] meant it on it on a little bit
[5:37] i was like this is deeper than you know
[5:38] what i was thinking and said and
[5:40] just keep talking my heart the testimony
[5:42] you know the devil is not scared of
[5:45] how beautiful you are the gift you heard
[5:48] you can sing your play instrument those
[5:49] are good things
[5:51] they was not scared
[5:54] they was not scared of
[5:57] how good the vocabulary is
[6:05] the devil is not scared of how you how
[6:07] much you call the scriptures
[6:10] he's not scared of how many messy quotes
[6:12] you know
[6:14] there's one thing that they was scared
[6:15] of your testimony
[6:18] amen he's scared of testimony because he
[6:22] knows that the word of god is mixed with
[6:24] faith in your heart
[6:25] and you're not just a tinkling symbol
[6:27] anymore
[6:28] you are god on two feet so every time
[6:31] you go on your knees even before you say
[6:33] in jesus name demons are trembling
[6:37] because you have testimony devils are
[6:39] shaking
[6:40] because they have testimony every time
[6:42] you try to go into worship the moment
[6:44] you say the first word and you're about
[6:45] to just
[6:46] praise god he knows that you're not just
[6:48] praising god because you feel like you
[6:49] know you have a good voice or whatever
[6:51] he knows that you're seeing him because
[6:52] you have a testimony and because you
[6:54] have the
[6:55] god in you he will take his life
[6:58] amen so the devil left at house whenever
[7:01] we speak or pray he might he
[7:03] is not afraid you know how eloquent to
[7:05] speak he was afraid of testing of christ
[7:08] in us and that that kind of you know i
[7:10] was just you know thinking about and i
[7:11] went back to the scriptures acts 19 11
[7:14] to 11 to 17. if you want already i won't
[7:17] take our time because i have someone so
[7:18] much to share
[7:19] but about the songs seven sons of skiva
[7:22] and you know if you go back from verse
[7:25] 11 you talked about
[7:26] paul you know was preaching to the
[7:27] people and it was really you know the
[7:29] the anointing of god was being
[7:30] manifested in this after his breathe and
[7:32] people were being healed
[7:33] and in the plan you know what was saying
[7:35] the lame or walking
[7:37] and they saw this power and they were so
[7:40] envious they wanted to do the same thing
[7:42] but they didn't know that the man
[7:44] had an experience at the back of desert
[7:46] they thought he just came and just
[7:47] performed some miracles they didn't know
[7:48] that god had made
[7:49] him so they tried to do the same
[7:52] the same or you know you know to go to
[7:55] demon they might also add a demon and
[7:57] said you i
[7:58] join you come out of come out of him in
[8:01] the name of
[8:02] paul in the name of jesus if i read that
[8:05] scripture
[8:05] i think i should read that so we can you
[8:06] know get it together amen
[8:09] acts chapter 19. i want to get the whole
[8:11] picture together
[8:13] act 19
[8:21] from verse 11
[8:25] and god wrote special miracles by the
[8:26] hands of paul
[8:28] so that from his body were brought unto
[8:30] the sick
[8:31] handkerchiefs or aprons and diseases
[8:35] departed from them and the evil spirit
[8:37] went out of them
[8:39] then certain of the vagabond jews
[8:40] exhausted took upon them to call over
[8:43] them
[8:43] which had evil spirits the name of the
[8:45] lord jesus saying we are joined you by
[8:47] jesus
[8:48] whom paul pritchett and there are seven
[8:51] sons of skiva
[8:53] a jew and chief of the priests
[8:56] who did so the heaven jews
[9:01] and the evil spirit answered and said
[9:02] jesus i know
[9:06] paul i know but who are you
[9:10] so devil knows you if you're a child of
[9:11] god if you're standing if you're
[9:13] understanding the devil knows you're
[9:14] standing
[9:15] amen you never know who this all these
[9:17] people are
[9:19] and the men and women the evil spirits
[9:21] who sleep on them
[9:22] overcame them
[9:26] don't call the name of jesus if you
[9:27] don't have jesus
[9:29] because the devil should beat you blue
[9:31] blood they will give you a tough time
[9:36] and overcame them and prevailed against
[9:37] them so that they fled out of the house
[9:39] naked and wounded and it was known to
[9:42] all the jews and greeks
[9:44] also dwelling on the ephesus and fear
[9:46] fell on them all
[9:48] and the name of the lord jesus was
[9:50] magnified
[9:52] why was the name of jesus magnified
[9:53] because there was a man that had a
[9:54] testimony
[9:56] there's a man that was saved already
[9:57] there was a man i was a murderer
[9:59] who was chasing the church but god turns
[10:01] out around
[10:02] and when god gives you god gives you the
[10:04] holy spirit it gives you a testament to
[10:06] go with it
[10:07] when god gives the holy spirit he gives
[10:08] you some manifestation the first that
[10:09] come after it
[10:10] that's how you know that you've been
[10:12] saved amen and these people were not
[10:14] safe
[10:15] they didn't know they didn't have a
[10:16] testimony to it they have no authority
[10:19] amen
[10:23] i love the scripture i said if any
[10:25] prayer of a righteous man
[10:27] i have let much james 5 16.
[10:30] i a village means to have strength force
[10:33] and power
[10:35] so when you pray because you have a
[10:37] testimony
[10:38] you have christ in you god listens
[10:43] amen i just felt like she said that no
[10:45] go put down my heart
[10:48] so i just want to i want to skip i don't
[10:49] know it's our time it's almost uh
[10:51] it's been about 15 minutes now let's
[10:52] just go through
[10:54] it's perfect everybody
[10:57] so um we stopped at that last the last
[11:00] time everybody approached
[11:01] you know and how we just you know have
[11:04] the right approach to talk to people and
[11:06] correction by god's leading and have
[11:08] grace with them
[11:09] but tonight i'm going to speak on
[11:11] correction by god's word
[11:13] i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna try to dig
[11:15] a little bit deeper correction by god's
[11:17] word
[11:19] and we all know that the word of god is
[11:21] ever true
[11:22] ever faithful it doesn't change times
[11:25] and
[11:26] seasons will change the political error
[11:27] will change
[11:29] but god's word remains the same hebrews
[11:31] 13 8 jesus christ is the same yesterday
[11:33] today and forever
[11:34] and he said but you say jesus you're not
[11:35] saying the word but he's the word
[11:38] john chapter one verse one in the
[11:39] beginning was the word
[11:41] and the word was with god and the word
[11:43] was god
[11:45] and that's some word if you go to verse
[11:47] 14 of john chapter one
[11:49] sayanda and that word became flesh in
[11:52] jesus and dwell among us
[11:54] so when i say jesus is the same
[11:56] yesterday
[11:57] today and forever i'm saying the word is
[11:59] the same
[12:00] yesterday today and forever
[12:04] amen i can tell you something you know
[12:06] last year
[12:07] and they say i'm like oh i didn't say
[12:08] that way oh i forget the way i said
[12:10] i'm human but god doesn't do that
[12:14] he doesn't lie he doesn't repent of his
[12:16] word damn if he says it
[12:17] it stays like that forever amen
[12:21] matthew 24 35 evan anderson passed away
[12:25] but god's word would never pass away
[12:29] i'm glad this one they have ghosts of my
[12:31] heart that's what's keeping me
[12:34] my 244 remember where where uh
[12:37] after jesus has fasted and uh
[12:41] the devil went to tempt him and he was
[12:43] trying to you know tempt him and said uh
[12:45] that if you have power without some god
[12:48] command that these stones be made bread
[12:52] and jesus said it is written man shall
[12:54] not live by bread alone
[12:58] but by some word
[13:02] are you listening to me but by some word
[13:08] but by every word
[13:11] that proceedeth out of the mouth of god
[13:14] so not don't
[13:15] not never nine percent 100 of god's word
[13:18] so he's saying that that word is so
[13:19] strong
[13:20] that if you don't live in that word
[13:24] you plan for that
[13:28] i love the way the amplified version but
[13:29] they say it is written and forever
[13:31] remains written that means nothing can
[13:34] change it
[13:36] amen therefore for men to have to
[13:40] live in the past and present future he
[13:42] has to leave by the word
[13:44] i mean every word that proceeds from
[13:46] god's mouth that implies that anywhere
[13:49] else a mind finds himself
[13:50] is death if he really wants to leave
[13:55] he has to abide by the word of god amen
[13:58] the word becomes your road map when the
[14:01] word says stop
[14:02] you stop when war said go
[14:05] you go when worse i lift your hand you
[14:08] lift your hand
[14:09] when once when war says sit down you sit
[14:11] down why
[14:12] you're a prisoner of the world at that
[14:14] point it's not you anymore it's christ
[14:16] living in you
[14:18] hallelujah said the word is so powerful
[14:22] that david said in psalm 138 verse 26 he
[14:25] said
[14:26] thou has magnified thy word above
[14:30] thy name now the word of god
[14:34] god's name i mean expresses is mighty
[14:37] deed
[14:38] but the word of god tells us exactly who
[14:40] god is
[14:42] i'll say that again god's name expressed
[14:44] his mighty deeds you know god has done
[14:46] this you know
[14:47] they did that you know he's
[14:48] manifestation but god's word tells us
[14:51] who god really is
[14:56] and someone might say here i want to
[14:58] know god
[15:00] the only way you can know god is abiding
[15:02] that word
[15:03] daily continually
[15:07] and gradually you start to see god and
[15:09] who is
[15:11] then i put a note right here you can't
[15:14] worship god
[15:15] you cannot have a relationship with god
[15:17] if you don't know who god is
[15:21] you might make up some you know worship
[15:23] like candy
[15:24] you can you know can can have a very
[15:26] beautiful beautiful
[15:27] um altar with fruits and you know
[15:30] permanganates and
[15:31] you know grapes and yeah beautiful
[15:33] flowers it's a beautiful alter head
[15:36] but one thing he didn't have he didn't
[15:37] have a relationship with god
[15:39] he didn't know who god is hallelujah
[15:42] if he knew who god is he would know that
[15:44] god has not god he didn't want that
[15:46] god wanted to represent and buy a land a
[15:49] dripping lamb that had blood in it
[15:50] but abel was different heaven knew god
[15:54] it was just trying to make up and show
[15:55] up for whatever we want to do he knew
[15:57] that what god was
[15:58] going to come in later was as a bleeding
[16:00] lamb
[16:02] so because he had a revelation of who
[16:03] god is it didn't cost him anything to
[16:05] know what to give god
[16:06] so when we know who god is then we're
[16:08] gonna know what god expects from us
[16:12] i'm gonna say this if you know who god
[16:14] is then you finally realize who you are
[16:18] amen because when you know who god is
[16:22] if you are made in the image of god now
[16:23] let me break it down but the brown talk
[16:25] about
[16:26] ma'am god man we made the image of god
[16:28] it's not this flesh
[16:30] this blessing was made in the image of
[16:31] animal and that's why if he mended
[16:34] him the holy ghost in his life is a
[16:35] beast
[16:37] because god is dying in in him so this
[16:39] when i say the image i'm asking about
[16:41] this
[16:42] i'm talking about the soul that soul
[16:44] reflects who god is amen
[16:46] so when god said you know let me let us
[16:48] man his
[16:49] own image in genesis after one and
[16:50] chapter two he wasn't talking about his
[16:52] talking about the soul
[16:53] so when you realize who god is that this
[16:55] is who god is this is what god wants
[16:57] this is his way this is this is the path
[16:59] that you want
[17:00] god will go through then you realize
[17:03] exactly who you are because you are god
[17:05] hallelujah i feel like jumping right now
[17:09] amen so if you know who god is if i know
[17:11] who god is
[17:13] i know who i am then i'm walking in
[17:17] power and authority i love that song
[17:20] amen and paul said in 1st timothy
[17:23] chapter 1
[17:25] if you want to open for the second
[17:27] timothy amen
[17:29] second timothy chapter 1
[17:34] 11 and 12.
[17:39] he was talking to timothy here and said
[17:41] where until i am appointed a preacher
[17:43] and an apostle and a teacher of the
[17:45] gentiles
[17:46] but the which cause i also suffered
[17:48] these things
[17:50] nevertheless i am not ashamed for i know
[17:54] i have the lead
[17:57] it's not a doubt it's not a worse
[18:00] and i'm persuaded
[18:07] persuaded me was convicted that
[18:10] he is able to keep that
[18:14] which i have committed unto him against
[18:17] that day
[18:18] so we are persuaded that's how we are
[18:20] tonight i swear that god is able
[18:23] and we know we believe it's not some
[18:25] guesswork
[18:27] amen i love the scripture also
[18:30] then in 11 32 said those that do know
[18:34] their god shall be strong and do
[18:36] exploits so when i said when you know
[18:39] who your god is you know where you are i
[18:42] think i'm i'm i'm
[18:44] correct by the scriptures because if you
[18:46] know your god say you will be strong
[18:49] diamonds is our strength and you do
[18:50] exploit greater works
[18:52] jesus said you know in the book of
[18:53] matthew greater what shall you do but
[18:55] you got to know him first
[18:56] now today everybody wants to they want
[18:58] to perform miracles and do great things
[19:00] and everybody want to be
[19:01] a prophet i was somewhere with that but
[19:03] paul was there and uh brother
[19:04] uh uh brent was there someone was still
[19:06] calling himself a prophet
[19:08] no no offense i mean but we know what
[19:10] the prophet is
[19:17] let me let me leave it right there so i
[19:18] don't go too far
[19:21] so back to what would uh no our uh
[19:25] the sermon we're talking about and we
[19:27] talked about the word of god i have
[19:29] three
[19:30] items that you know i would love to
[19:31] share
[19:34] the going forth of the word number one
[19:37] number two resentment word
[19:40] number three accepting the word so i'm
[19:43] gonna you know in the next
[19:44] maybe 30 minutes i'll try to see if i
[19:46] can just you know
[19:49] catch up with time
[19:53] the word of god retains its efficacy and
[19:56] the word efficacy in latin means
[19:57] efficacy
[19:59] which means power to produce effects
[20:04] that's in the web's dictionary in 1928.
[20:08] i love you know well i was talking
[20:10] brother uh dana the other day how i love
[20:12] the webster dictionary
[20:13] it brings it back to the christian walk
[20:16] most of the world the ones back in 1800s
[20:22] were the guys they were christians
[20:24] that's why everything they say they
[20:25] bring it back to
[20:26] you know the word that's no the
[20:28] christian them
[20:29] it said as the efficacy of the gospel
[20:31] and converting man
[20:33] from sin
[20:37] so the words to retain the power to
[20:39] change lives
[20:40] amen the efficacy of
[20:44] prayer that's how we define it powers to
[20:47] produce effects
[20:49] production to effect to the effect
[20:51] intended so there's a purpose for the
[20:53] world going forward
[20:54] the water isn't good doesn't go forward
[20:56] and i reach also what
[20:58] isaiah 5 said we're together the world
[21:01] doesn't go forth and just have no
[21:03] no no no purpose there's a projection
[21:06] and when there's this projection
[21:09] anything that's projection as direction
[21:10] and aim
[21:12] so the word of god has direction he has
[21:15] what's going to
[21:16] he has the heart that is that's been
[21:17] prepared that he wants that wants to
[21:19] receive it
[21:20] amen isaiah 55 8 11
[21:24] says so shall my word be that goes forth
[21:26] out of my mouth
[21:28] if you go back a little bit it talks
[21:30] about you see my ways are not your ways
[21:31] you know as the rain coming from the
[21:32] earth
[21:33] uh on the earth and it's no one you know
[21:35] you went so far then it came to verse
[21:36] 11.
[21:37] he said so shall my word be that goes
[21:39] forth out of my mouth
[21:40] it shall not return unto me void
[21:44] that means when it's sin when god sends
[21:45] his word coming out of his mouth
[21:47] it has to perform the purpose that god
[21:48] sent it forth amen
[21:50] it shall accomplish that
[21:53] which i please and isha
[21:57] prosper so it's it will just go and just
[22:01] you know
[22:01] you know just you know you know do
[22:04] anything it's going to prosper
[22:05] whatever god's saying is that means to
[22:07] be successful
[22:09] so god's word don't come back to him boy
[22:11] he has to read that that seed of jesus
[22:13] somewhere
[22:14] maybe it's in somewhere somewhere in the
[22:16] world wherever he is god will bring that
[22:17] seed back
[22:18] to convince that heart amen
[22:22] it shall prosper in the thing we're
[22:25] until i sent it
[22:26] amen so the purpose of the word of god
[22:29] is to be planted as a seed in the heart
[22:31] of those who accept
[22:32] god's word that's the purpose of it
[22:36] and that word has to mix with faith
[22:40] what does it have to produce to produce
[22:42] effects and i remember
[22:44] brandon was talking about it the other
[22:45] day to be a fruits
[22:48] john john 15 to bear morford
[22:52] he didn't stop there he said to be a
[22:54] much fruit
[22:55] that means to the maximum
[22:59] amen so there's no limit to what fruits
[23:03] of christ that can be exhibited in our
[23:06] life there's no limit to it
[23:07] there's no stop to it something can tell
[23:09] you i'm talking saying you don't know
[23:10] your life your word
[23:11] your life cannot be effort don't listen
[23:13] to him because the word of god says
[23:15] you can be a much fruit
[23:19] he said you're trying to be like god but
[23:22] the bible says you're god
[23:25] so my life can produce as much fruit the
[23:27] bread of christ and praise that much
[23:29] fruit
[23:29] ask god himself you say oh the prophet
[23:32] had it oh
[23:33] i saw this no no now it's our it's our
[23:35] turn
[23:36] god just brought the prophet as the
[23:38] first sheep remember you know
[23:40] in the old testament the first shift has
[23:42] been weighed first
[23:44] but that the barbarously supposed sheep
[23:47] to see how god's going to work
[23:49] among the bride but even greater words
[23:52] than what we see in the prophet's life
[23:53] is what god is going to do now among the
[23:55] bride
[23:56] i don't care i don't care how much the
[23:58] devil tried to hold us back i don't try
[24:00] my devil try to divide us into different
[24:02] ranks and
[24:02] you know we all have our personal issues
[24:04] i don't know how much mind games we have
[24:07] i'm telling you that god has a promise
[24:09] for the bride and it's going to do
[24:10] greater works among
[24:11] us as long as we allow that word to take
[24:14] charge of our life
[24:16] as long as that word to you know to
[24:18] dissect our life he said
[24:19] he said in hebrews a two edges word as
[24:21] scotland used cutting me right here too
[24:23] i sang i was just open and said lord
[24:24] this word let's just take his full
[24:26] charge
[24:26] it should be a much fruits
[24:31] amen when the word is planted as a city
[24:34] in your heart it doesn't just remain in
[24:35] his status
[24:36] it wants to blossom just like our
[24:39] sisters when they have enough flowers
[24:41] on the planet all over and my wife has a
[24:42] little garden in front of our apartment
[24:44] and you know she's always on on the case
[24:46] of those plans i feel bad for this plan
[24:47] so she's always watching them
[24:49] but what what is that name she wants
[24:50] those the the little seed to grow
[24:54] to blossom full-blown
[24:57] amen so how does god's word get to get
[25:00] to a man
[25:02] number one directly by god himself god
[25:04] speak to his people
[25:06] god didn't want god god doesn't want a
[25:08] uh what he called
[25:09] an intermediary he doesn't want a
[25:12] middleman
[25:13] he wants to connect to the heart himself
[25:14] when you go to the uh uh catholic church
[25:17] you know they the priest would go behind
[25:18] you know the door and you go every side
[25:20] of the eagle confess your sin
[25:22] and you say oh chris you know last week
[25:24] i did this and that and you know
[25:25] and i say you're forgiven by the way who
[25:29] is that man as a part of forgive
[25:30] me that's a blasphemy no man has power
[25:34] for you i said my lord
[25:35] and whatever he forgives no man can even
[25:37] look back into it
[25:39] and even when you look at it you can't
[25:40] even see no more and god said and sit
[25:43] and say oh lord by all sister
[25:44] did this you did that she did that but
[25:46] god said i cannot see it
[25:48] so he is the only one who has a power to
[25:50] forgive
[25:52] no man on earth he needs god himself
[25:56] so god doesn't have no intermediary or
[25:58] someone to stand in between or you know
[25:59] i know we know we have ministers but the
[26:01] purpose of the ministers is for god to
[26:03] use them
[26:04] for you to connect back to him so
[26:07] god how does god speak to us directly by
[26:09] himself number two three servants
[26:12] amen and god spoke from from uh
[26:16] uh at adam to this age god has spoken to
[26:20] servant and we are witnesses of it
[26:22] and those words have never failed amen
[26:25] psalm 68 verse 11 says the lord gave the
[26:28] word
[26:29] great was the company of those that
[26:32] published it
[26:36] who are those ministers who are those
[26:39] god servants
[26:41] and every time they come here behind
[26:42] this pulpit wherever they are found and
[26:44] known in the jungles of africa
[26:46] in america and asia and the and the
[26:48] combo and the all they're doing is
[26:50] publishing the word that god has given
[26:51] them
[26:53] i was reading through this uh this uh
[26:55] this word um
[26:56] this scripture and i'll see i i don't
[26:59] know just to look at different
[27:00] translations and different bibles
[27:02] and the translation was different and
[27:04] what they said was the lord gave the
[27:06] word great was the company
[27:07] of the woman that published it
[27:11] i said what an error i've never seen
[27:13] that all my life i just saw it today
[27:16] and 99 of all the translations
[27:20] had that even amplified
[27:23] version the only one i didn't have
[27:27] that same translation was the king james
[27:28] version
[27:30] i was like wow that's why we need to
[27:32] know
[27:33] who we are and what we believe what we
[27:35] stand for we need to read it by
[27:36] ourselves don't let nobody tell you
[27:38] tell you anything except you're
[27:39] confirming yourself amen confirm that
[27:41] word yourself read up the scripture
[27:43] yourself because there's so many errors
[27:44] in the world right now
[27:46] that the devil has used people to
[27:47] populate what were they trying to push
[27:49] this they're trying to push human
[27:51] preachers
[27:52] that's what i can discern from it if 99
[27:55] of all transitions have that
[27:58] that means trying to save women
[27:59] purchases okay but the bible didn't tell
[28:01] me that first corinthians 14 24
[28:03] let your women keep selling these
[28:04] churches it didn't it didn't take the
[28:06] power of women down
[28:07] it just said it according to decoration
[28:09] when a woman the woman fell
[28:11] he said now your willer should be
[28:12] accounted to your husband
[28:14] does it take that position away no i'm
[28:17] telling you sisters
[28:18] have more greater position more without
[28:19] work to do in their homes
[28:21] and life at families than women even
[28:23] have
[28:24] i told my wife i said i can never try to
[28:26] compete with you
[28:28] in a row i can i don't want to switch
[28:32] it's hard they cook they claim that you
[28:34] have the
[28:35] the children they give you food they
[28:37] make sure you're okay
[28:38] sometimes women act like babies because
[28:40] you just wanna take care of us
[28:42] and they do all that and it's just
[28:44] served all together that's a lot of work
[28:46] the other day brother paul was talking
[28:48] about you know talking about the the the
[28:50] um
[28:50] salary that come how they estimate the
[28:52] amount of you know what
[28:54] mothers and house wives should have i
[28:56] was like i kind of afford half of it
[28:59] so i look at my i said just take me as i
[29:01] am right now i can pay for all that
[29:03] but people think that because god said
[29:06] that in book of corinthians that is
[29:07] taking away the role of women no you
[29:09] know
[29:09] it's just putting them in their position
[29:12] greater is their
[29:12] word if they stay by their position
[29:14] hallelujah
[29:16] so i don't believe what they said about
[29:18] in psalm 68 11
[29:19] what this other interpretation said i
[29:22] believe what king james said the lord
[29:23] gave the word
[29:24] great was company of those that
[29:26] published it
[29:27] if another scripture for that 1st
[29:29] timothy 2 11. he also spoke about that
[29:32] amen so this scripture of psalm 18 11
[29:35] talked about the servants of god
[29:37] who proclaimed the word day and night
[29:39] without adding to it
[29:41] they don't identify ideology i'm here
[29:43] i'm not having nothing to do to god's
[29:45] word because i know better
[29:47] out there if you go see different
[29:49] different preachers and out in the world
[29:51] and nominations
[29:52] they bring up cultural backgrounds and
[29:55] ideologies and you know
[29:56] just to make it look good and nice but i
[29:59] don't care how harsh the word of god is
[30:01] i'm gonna bring it the way it is
[30:03] and that's those are the two men of god
[30:06] and those are the ones that the
[30:07] scripture is talking about
[30:08] they don't have the ideological theology
[30:09] they deliver as
[30:11] sent theirs
[30:14] and those are the ones that the
[30:16] manifestations
[30:17] follow because if eternal god's word is
[30:20] so very very strong that if you had just
[30:23] won a little
[30:24] percentage that's it it's out so you
[30:27] have to keep it the way it is
[30:29] amen now when the world goes for the
[30:31] power and strength who are the
[30:33] recipients you and me
[30:38] but what determines um
[30:41] the product or the result is our
[30:45] our attitude to that word
[30:49] we can resent it or we can
[30:52] receive it but for senate
[30:56] referred to show
[31:02] if we receive it the first will follow
[31:06] so you might not you might find the
[31:08] brother said you can't you can't tell
[31:09] you can't tell a man if he has a legal
[31:10] son now you can
[31:11] but he can't see in his life by the
[31:14] first commandment of
[31:14] life if he has that ghost or not if he's
[31:18] receiving god's word so then i'll go to
[31:20] the second part
[31:21] presenting the word representing the
[31:22] word of god i look at the word
[31:25] resembling as harden of heart
[31:27] hardening of heart and if you want to
[31:29] know have a little example of that
[31:31] if you go back to the book of genesis
[31:35] i'm in exodus when moses spoke to
[31:37] pharaoh
[31:38] and said let my people go and the bible
[31:41] said
[31:42] he hardened his heart so god's word came
[31:45] and said this is what i promised my
[31:47] children
[31:47] let him go what he did he resented that
[31:50] word
[31:51] so if you want one thing you have a
[31:52] picture in your mind or an illustration
[31:54] that's what i'm i'm trying to look at
[31:56] after the word has been projected to to
[31:59] correct our lives in various forms
[32:00] sometimes we do not agree with it
[32:03] because of our emotion emotional
[32:05] convictions our associations
[32:06] our fleshly affiliations
[32:12] we just you know don't agree with it
[32:16] so instead of allow the word of god to
[32:18] to you know to right the wrong
[32:20] we just resent you know harshly
[32:23] we might not say it by the words of our
[32:24] mouth but sometimes we do it in our
[32:26] heart and the bible said our hearts
[32:28] speak louder before god jesus said
[32:30] instead of matthew your heart speak
[32:31] louder before god
[32:32] for the throne of god that even worse of
[32:34] my mouth
[32:35] so when the preacher is preaching even
[32:37] if people don't understand it
[32:39] even if i've not heard it before go back
[32:42] to my study
[32:43] and say lord help me because if resent
[32:46] is very it's very
[32:47] it's very dangerous if you represent the
[32:49] word of god
[32:50] because you get to a point of no return
[32:53] and that's because the outcome that's a
[32:55] very difficult situation
[32:58] excuse me
[33:03] resentment gets us nowhere
[33:07] resentment hardens our hearts
[33:11] resentment to god's word brings a man to
[33:13] a deadly position
[33:15] a very delicate position i've seen a few
[33:18] cases i asked my wife of
[33:20] a few people who are you know believers
[33:22] no in the word and
[33:24] they've been to church and they resent
[33:25] god's word they kick again against the
[33:27] pastor
[33:28] and they become very sick we just had a
[33:30] case recently
[33:32] and then people go to him brother please
[33:33] you know come back you know
[33:35] because i would work because i would the
[33:36] pastor said i'm not doing i'm not doing
[33:38] it
[33:38] and they died in that that's a very
[33:41] delicate position but you know what it
[33:43] is thought right there
[33:44] it started from the first time somebody
[33:46] said something that touched his heart
[33:48] about something was doing wrong
[33:49] and instead of him saying lord help me
[33:51] help my help me and get me out of the
[33:53] situation
[33:54] he fought against it and it didn't stop
[33:57] right there it keeps going
[33:59] um but i'm saying you keep falling into
[34:01] one error if you don't correct it you
[34:03] force another one
[34:04] and keep going you keep going once he
[34:07] gets at that point of no return
[34:10] now he has to on the day of judgment he
[34:12] has to stand before god
[34:14] and present his case because they
[34:17] implode and
[34:18] talk to him that buys them but he
[34:20] doesn't care about what he did
[34:22] that's what his power for my brothers
[34:23] and sisters it's not something we play
[34:26] with
[34:27] as much as he helps he saves life he
[34:29] also destroys life
[34:31] you might say oh that's harsh but that's
[34:33] what the word is
[34:34] right if i've accepted it it's life if
[34:37] rejected
[34:38] death and that's why jesus told the
[34:40] apostles in matthew i think matthew
[34:42] 10 when they even sent him out if i'm
[34:44] right if i'm wrong please correct me
[34:46] when i sent him out he said when when
[34:48] you when you go on pretty work those in
[34:50] the cities and
[34:50] they don't take you he said dust your
[34:52] shoes
[34:55] and walk away you know what that means
[34:58] the glory of god has departed from that
[35:00] place
[35:03] i don't mess it with people like that
[35:05] who i rejected god's word
[35:06] i want the best to say with people who
[35:08] accept god's word
[35:10] amen when you cross that line
[35:14] it's hard to come back remember the case
[35:17] of that woman
[35:18] that said not even my dog would believe
[35:20] the discernment of
[35:21] the perfect bridge guess who killed her
[35:26] our son-in-law struck that's i mean that
[35:29] i don't think there's anything that
[35:30] anything that will be so
[35:32] harsh on your heart or heart at the
[35:34] heart of family
[35:36] that your family member killed you
[35:39] what did she do sure xena goes for she
[35:41] she
[35:42] rejected it please my brothers don't
[35:44] reject us word
[35:46] even if it beats you hard just take it
[35:48] like that
[35:49] one day you get better hey man
[35:54] i'm getting faster so i'll get it i get
[35:55] in a minute number three accepting
[35:58] the correction by the word accepting
[36:01] correction by the word and i'm gonna
[36:03] split it into two and talk about the
[36:04] unsaved and the saved
[36:08] mark mark 16 15 says go into the water
[36:10] and preach the gospel to every creature
[36:13] one two he that believes
[36:16] that means he that accepts that word
[36:19] and is baptized shall be
[36:22] saved but either believe it or not
[36:28] shall be damned
[36:33] so when you accept the invasion of the
[36:34] word it convinced
[36:37] the sinful ways that's what it does
[36:40] i'm talking about it on save now i'm
[36:42] sick of going to wherever we're saved
[36:43] after you have though because
[36:44] i'm getting there and you know
[36:48] paul was i don't know uh peter was
[36:49] saying in the book of acts 238 and after
[36:52] he had the holy ghost you know in the
[36:53] opera
[36:54] when i know you know they say oh this
[36:56] men are drunk
[36:57] you know when you have the words of god
[36:58] in your heart and your life so much
[37:00] you act like you're drunk now you're not
[37:03] drunk or fiscal wine but you don't
[37:05] it looks like you don't you don't
[37:06] believe in this world no more because
[37:08] god's word in you but was you know it
[37:10] was talking about he was given an
[37:11] illustration of holy ghost
[37:13] as a iraq that was thrown around and
[37:15] dropped now a barrel of wine
[37:17] and it comes and he's just staggering
[37:19] and staggering
[37:20] he doesn't know it doesn't know what
[37:21] it's doing no more because it's not here
[37:22] no more it's not the right number it's
[37:24] the wine working
[37:25] and that's why sometimes you see
[37:27] somebody just run around the building
[37:29] don't make fun of them see somebody just
[37:31] you know
[37:32] tearing them and crying and just you
[37:33] know falling in front of the author it's
[37:35] not them no more
[37:36] that one is doing something in their
[37:38] lives it's changing it from glory to
[37:40] glory
[37:41] hallelujah
[37:45] so when that happened to peter the
[37:48] people wanted now they got a testimony
[37:50] before they didn't have a testimony
[37:51] maybe i sometimes speak i'll speak on
[37:53] the life of peter
[37:54] when it was you know when he was with
[37:55] the lord but he was not like he didn't
[37:57] have the holy ghost and after i had the
[37:58] lucas maybe sometimes i speak on that
[38:00] but peter after the holy ghost he was he
[38:03] was a shy person he was scared of the
[38:04] parishes and the statuses and all the
[38:06] you know
[38:06] chief person everything this time he
[38:08] didn't care anymore he stepped out
[38:10] it was not hiding no more and started
[38:12] speaking to the people
[38:13] and then the people were convicted
[38:16] remember we said the water has a power
[38:17] they asked the
[38:18] efficacy the power and that power
[38:21] convicted the heart of people
[38:23] who were not saved were not believers
[38:24] before and they said i'll say well
[38:26] so it's about to say they were pretty
[38:28] hard
[38:30] and they ask spirit what do we do
[38:34] and peter said repent
[38:37] the word of means change direction i'm
[38:39] going this way right now
[38:41] allah just turned around totally that's
[38:44] what word of pain is
[38:45] the pain doesn't mean i'm in direction
[38:46] i'm i'm peeping like
[38:48] can i still you know can i still you
[38:50] know you're not doing that no more you
[38:52] change direction finally
[38:53] you're going to a different different
[38:54] place amen that's the word
[38:56] that's the word of pain the water pain
[38:57] means so repent change your direction
[39:00] change your ways and be baptized in the
[39:03] name of jesus christ
[39:04] for the remission and the word of
[39:06] mission means freedom pardon
[39:08] deliverance forgiveness liberty
[39:13] that's where the true freedom is they
[39:16] can say we have freedom of you know
[39:17] freedom of religion you know the first
[39:19] amendment i had to go through all that
[39:21] classes and everything freedom of
[39:22] amendment uh freedom of uh the first
[39:24] time in the freedom of
[39:26] religion freedom of speech oblique to be
[39:28] arms and all that stuff
[39:29] they might say that but i'm telling it's
[39:31] not now in canada they don't do that
[39:34] i'm sure they promised them that before
[39:36] so the true freedom is the word of god
[39:37] when you say
[39:40] amen he said be baptized in the name of
[39:43] jesus christ for the remission of your
[39:44] sins and you shall receive the gift
[39:46] of the holy ghost
[39:50] now that makes that person will say who
[39:53] is unsafe before
[39:54] who has repented who have cleansed their
[39:56] ways now a candidate of the old
[39:58] holy ghost but
[40:02] what what really astounded me what
[40:03] really surprised me a lot was i was
[40:05] reading now
[40:06] robert brown was talking about something
[40:07] i'll share that that could be in a
[40:08] minute
[40:09] bubba graham said don't you don't have
[40:11] to baptize to receive the holy ghost i
[40:13] was like wow
[40:15] i was shocked because you know i know
[40:17] that you have to baptize and
[40:19] that was uh peter's uh approach which is
[40:22] a good great one
[40:23] baptism you know justification
[40:24] authentication and baptism of oligarchs
[40:26] it wasn't that was
[40:26] one of the by right what the prophet
[40:29] said and i was really really surprised
[40:30] i'll share that with you in a minute
[40:44] and the prophet said now in question and
[40:46] answers number one
[40:47] 1954 generic the third
[40:52] paragraph 42 the prophet said now you
[40:54] don't have to be baptized to receive the
[40:55] holy ghost
[40:57] because you can receive the holy ghost
[40:59] when your heart is
[41:00] right so the holy ghost
[41:04] looks at the condition of the heart
[41:05] first that's the most important thing
[41:08] you can be baptized you can you know
[41:11] get to this set of certification but if
[41:13] that heart is not right yet if it's not
[41:15] cleaned up yet the illegals cannot enter
[41:16] in there
[41:17] it's very timid he said
[41:20] see because an act to peter gave a
[41:23] formula to repent
[41:24] and bypass the name of jesus christ and
[41:26] you shall receive the gift of the holy
[41:27] spirit
[41:28] i believe that too but then in acts 10
[41:31] 49
[41:32] god turned around and gave the gentiles
[41:36] the baptism of the holy ghost before
[41:38] they was ever baptized at all
[41:42] you see it's the condition of your heart
[41:46] so if your heart is out right now even
[41:48] if you're not saying
[41:49] even if you're not baptized yet good
[41:52] holy spirit comment
[41:57] and peter said can we forbid water
[41:58] seeing that these have
[42:00] received the holy ghost like we had it
[42:02] at the beginning
[42:04] so then so then they constrained them
[42:06] that they must be
[42:07] baptized in the name of jesus christ but
[42:10] if you're here tonight and we are not
[42:11] saved yet if you're here tonight
[42:13] and your heart's not convicted yet
[42:15] please listen to this word i'm telling
[42:17] you because this is where true freedom
[42:18] is
[42:20] there's no freedom out there not now
[42:21] they don't need what can offer
[42:23] it's just pain and walls
[42:27] and then but if you look at paul's uh
[42:29] peter's uh
[42:30] uh formula justification i will justify
[42:33] by faith
[42:35] romans 3 28 galatians 2 16. write that
[42:38] down romans 5
[42:39] 1 galatians 3 26 again like i said
[42:42] justification is by faith you profess it
[42:45] now what does
[42:46] what does it mean to be justified you're
[42:47] innocent you know they did in the first
[42:49] place
[42:50] amen and then you go to that those are
[42:53] the stages of salvation the next one is
[42:54] sanctification centered by the word
[42:56] every day every chance of um two twenty
[42:58] six or three twenty six seven i was
[43:00] satisfied by the word daily
[43:02] and then the baptism of the holy holy
[43:04] ghost now i'm gonna take it down to
[43:06] where we're talking about the safe the
[43:08] safe people now
[43:09] how do we accept correction by the word
[43:11] for those who are saved
[43:13] after the bible it goes we used to make
[43:15] mistakes
[43:17] i wrote a question down here when you're
[43:18] baptized oh i got all the ghosts man you
[43:20] know what i'm done everything's fine i
[43:21] don't
[43:22] know nothing no more i will never make
[43:24] mistakes no more i'll just be the
[43:25] perfect man walking on earth
[43:30] will you make mistakes after the elder
[43:32] ghost is in your heart after i receive
[43:34] it
[43:36] yes you will you will make mistakes
[43:40] do you know why because you're still in
[43:42] this body
[43:45] your soul is saved but this body is not
[43:48] saved
[43:49] and that's why i can connect to taste
[43:52] you know the five sense of spirit
[43:54] you know touch taste you know smell and
[43:57] all that
[43:58] you can still connect to that and then
[43:59] to affect you sometimes
[44:02] your spirit is not safe because
[44:03] consciousness reasoning remember
[44:04] affection all that
[44:05] you see sometimes you just risen as a
[44:07] man like my brother paul said the other
[44:09] day
[44:09] he said give me a break sometime i just
[44:11] i sometimes just recently i think man
[44:12] why because he's still in the flesh
[44:15] that's why we make mistakes every day
[44:19] your spirit is not saved by your soul's
[44:21] sake
[44:22] but i like what the brother said here
[44:25] i've heard that quote i was i was trying
[44:26] to
[44:26] read it last time when i where i i spoke
[44:29] but i have
[44:30] the quotes right now i'd like to share
[44:31] with you say believers backslide
[44:33] every day
[44:37] so now this one is a question and answer
[44:40] chapter one
[44:41] so now just saying that you're baptizing
[44:44] christian baptism at age of 13 and you
[44:46] leave the christian life all the way
[44:47] along
[44:48] and you bastard a few times on bass
[44:51] lightning i wish somebody who
[44:53] asked me that bottom backslider remember
[44:55] you backslide
[44:56] every day
[45:00] there's no way at all for you to keep
[45:01] out of it all right but you bust like
[45:03] to the people in the church but not
[45:05] before god
[45:08] i love that you might make mistakes you
[45:11] might see my mistakes i might see your
[45:12] faults and not because you're human
[45:14] but god doesn't see all that it sees a
[45:16] satisfied life
[45:18] amen he said your sins are gone
[45:22] but you're constantly falling and paul
[45:23] said i die every day is that right
[45:25] you have to die every day repent every
[45:28] day
[45:29] so when they made the mistakes it didn't
[45:30] stay right there you have to make sure
[45:32] you're paying it every day and that's
[45:33] why we're heading out
[45:35] just constantly repenting all day as
[45:38] paul said he's in the first
[45:39] corinthians i'm 15 31 and say i die
[45:42] daily
[45:42] this will work put the notes down
[45:46] they say if paul had to do that then i'm
[45:49] gonna have to do
[45:50] two and if perfect i do that we're gonna
[45:53] have to do that too
[45:54] make the mistakes every day correct the
[45:56] mistakes the someone said don't
[45:58] let the bible say don't let the sun go
[46:01] down
[46:02] that's right on you whatever you've done
[46:05] that's what the scripture said
[46:08] but also said you know the question i'm
[46:10] going to ask a question i said but the
[46:11] bible said that everything works
[46:13] works for the good to them to love the
[46:14] lord then if you love god and turn back
[46:17] to the world will god let you die in sin
[46:18] and we
[46:19] will he let you reconcile back to him
[46:21] before he takes you away
[46:22] and brahma answered that question but i
[46:24] love this part where he said
[46:30] so now you make a mistake and do i do
[46:31] wrong not willfully
[46:33] because now you might say oh well
[46:34] because but mike said oh no no you make
[46:37] mistakes
[46:37] but bram said you make mistakes then i
[46:39] can do whatever i i want to do no
[46:42] that's willfully sin that means you're
[46:44] not converted in first place
[46:46] so i want to balance that out with
[46:48] listening and making mistakes
[46:50] so you make a mistake when you're trying
[46:51] to do right if you have a pencil for
[46:53] example you have you know expense to
[46:55] have a little eraser at the bottom of it
[46:56] and you try and draw the make to draw an
[46:58] image and you make a mistake
[47:00] use the eraser to wipe it up that's the
[47:01] purpose of it but when you will
[47:03] listening
[47:04] that person needs calvary
[47:07] amen said don't do it willfully here
[47:09] christian you're born again
[47:10] you don't mean to do wrong your
[47:12] intentions and everything is right
[47:14] but but if you do as she said here
[47:17] making me saying do
[47:18] do wrong will god let you go go on and
[47:21] on die like that and be lost or will he
[47:22] bring you back to recon
[47:23] consolation he will bring you back
[47:26] and if you're anything wrong you don't
[47:28] condemn you i'm going like that remember
[47:30] you wasn't safe at the beginning
[47:33] they said you were you had just had to
[47:35] make believe you were unsafe
[47:37] you have a different spirit you're a
[47:38] different nature you're a new creature
[47:41] in god
[47:41] and all things have passed away they are
[47:44] buried
[47:45] and are dead and buried in the sea of
[47:47] forgetfulness
[47:50] it said be no being living here in this
[47:52] war there's traps
[47:53] set for you everywhere i want you to
[47:55] understand that part
[47:57] i go to work every day and i see what i
[47:59] see sometimes it's nothing to build over
[48:01] high do it for the rest and everything
[48:04] and devil knows that so he set those
[48:06] traps for you just for you and me to
[48:07] fail
[48:08] that's the purpose of it see that strap
[48:11] set for you every day and you're walking
[48:13] with your eyes on christ i remember what
[48:15] the prophet said he said he had a
[48:16] cross and you know on this red mirror
[48:19] they're hanging down so that when they
[48:20] see anything that's not right it looks
[48:21] like that it looks like that cross
[48:24] i think i should have another cross in
[48:25] my car now so when anything happens
[48:28] around me i look at that cross
[48:30] but it's not a physical cross it's not
[48:31] it's it's this is the one that you
[48:33] the eyes cannot see you're looking at
[48:35] jesus the author finishes
[48:36] our faith that's what that that implies
[48:39] amen
[48:40] walking with your eyes on christ and
[48:43] remember when you make a mistake
[48:45] a real christian will always come back
[48:47] to reconciliation
[48:50] amen and that's why we need the word
[48:54] to wash us daily never stop it
[48:58] that's how we need to accept correction
[48:59] by god's word to purge us
[49:01] daily paul said i died daily
[49:04] he died not just not just that he made
[49:06] mistake he made a mistake by corrected
[49:08] his mistakes
[49:09] every day that's what the holy ghost is
[49:12] there to purge us
[49:13] but the prophet said when if you're holy
[49:15] spirit in your heart and you do
[49:17] something wrong
[49:18] it will step away i'm not just saying
[49:20] somewhere i'm waiting for you to repent
[49:23] but if you don't repent it keeps going
[49:26] further
[49:28] if you do if you still go that way this
[49:31] is white because it's very timid
[49:33] amen but if you repent it comes right
[49:36] back in
[49:37] so if you want to keep the holy spirit
[49:38] in your heart if you want to make sure
[49:39] that the spirit is still you know we
[49:41] just want to live that life for god
[49:42] make sure that every mistake that comes
[49:43] around you let the world clean it
[49:46] and that's how i would come that's
[49:47] that's why i'm here amen that's why i'm
[49:49] here daily as i you know
[49:51] you know i just want the word of god to
[49:52] just you know watch me
[49:54] daily you know cut me i know it's gonna
[49:56] be hard you know sometimes you know
[49:58] and if you look at that as a perfect man
[50:00] it gets it gets thin as it goes up
[50:03] faith virgin knowledge temperance
[50:04] patience godliness and brotherly
[50:05] kindness
[50:06] and cancer with love all the excess
[50:09] weight that you have you know that
[50:11] you're carrying along
[50:12] your christian journey the word of god
[50:13] does what it cuts it down
[50:17] anger because of doubt malice gossip
[50:19] because of them
[50:22] so many things that we came up came with
[50:23] the adamic nature that still announced
[50:25] that this flesh is still projecting
[50:26] because it's not saying
[50:27] the word of god just know so much that
[50:30] the
[50:31] the flesh has to now subject itself to
[50:33] the soul
[50:34] because the soul is filled with god
[50:37] amen the world becomes so
[50:42] connected with us that it's not now a
[50:44] force or
[50:45] you have been coerced or being impulsed
[50:48] to do it
[50:48] it's not love i fear like lord just
[50:52] you know you know you have you seen a
[50:53] young man and a woman you know we just
[50:54] you know fell in love with seattle
[50:56] you know they're not forced to do
[50:58] anything and that's how
[51:00] when the whatever comes to you you we
[51:02] should receive it with you know with
[51:03] that
[51:04] with the that grace of lord whatever you
[51:06] want to do just do what you have to do
[51:08] in life
[51:08] i'll submit to whatever your will lord
[51:11] amen acceptance accept into a line for
[51:14] direction
[51:15] god projects his word for correction we
[51:18] are set correction and a line for
[51:19] direction
[51:20] so there's a purpose washed by the water
[51:23] of the world
[51:24] correction starts from the soul and it
[51:27] works its way out
[51:28] from the inside out
[51:32] sometimes you know we see what we call
[51:34] religion which is
[51:35] the cloak the outsider attire and
[51:38] see you know the pharisees were there in
[51:40] the scriptures where the bible said when
[51:42] they fast they will go to the you know
[51:43] open
[51:44] open um streets with long places so
[51:46] everybody would know that they faster
[51:48] but that's religion but corruption
[51:50] doesn't do that
[51:51] it it goes to soul first it cuts the
[51:54] soul down
[51:55] i love what he said when the word of god
[51:57] touches your heart it sells the soul of
[51:59] flame
[52:01] burns anything that's ungodly and sheds
[52:03] its light
[52:04] so bright that every form of darkness
[52:07] will take flag
[52:10] so you don't have to force that person
[52:11] to change the way to talk no more
[52:13] because they've allowed one of us to
[52:14] correct them daily you don't have to
[52:16] stop them
[52:17] tell them to to cost i i see some some
[52:20] so-called christians in my job and they
[52:21] say oh i'm a christian every time the
[52:22] church and everything and they still
[52:24] still no use cost word i'm like the
[52:26] world has not
[52:27] touched this man yet if i touch his mind
[52:29] yeah the tongue will change
[52:31] you'd be like isaiah when he said when
[52:33] the call of fire taught the prophet
[52:35] it wasn't the same no more
[52:38] amen you don't have to you don't have to
[52:41] force them to oh please
[52:42] can you dress in them make your skirts
[52:44] know long enough so you don't expose
[52:46] yourself you don't have to tell them no
[52:47] more because the water is correction
[52:48] themselves
[52:50] if you have a child a daughter or
[52:51] someone i know sometimes and i'm not
[52:53] there yet
[52:53] but maybe low tires i'll be there
[52:55] parents who have children who you know
[52:57] you try to advise them and talk to them
[52:58] about you know how to dress and
[53:00] everything
[53:00] or the boys that keep longer and
[53:02] everything if you talk to them and talk
[53:03] you know try talk to them
[53:04] fine but if their heart is not converted
[53:07] you can just force it
[53:09] but when when when when the call of fire
[53:11] when the call of the holy spirit touched
[53:12] that heart
[53:15] you won't you just say change by
[53:17] yourself
[53:22] and what are we looking at i'm looking
[53:23] at something i'm looking at life of
[53:24] enoch
[53:25] genesis 5 22. he said enoch
[53:28] walked with god and it was found not
[53:32] right and that's that's the problem
[53:34] that's the only proper song i'm
[53:35] accepting the word of god the prophets
[53:37] why you and i accept the god's word
[53:38] is that walk with god unto a found not
[53:41] so we have an a
[53:42] we're looking to a city normally by hand
[53:45] but
[53:45] nothing entered that city about perfect
[53:47] love that means that life has to be
[53:49] corrected
[53:50] you know daily walking daily with the
[53:53] lord
[53:54] if we don't get to that point we cannot
[53:56] and you know you say oh
[53:57] you know i'm waiting for the generator
[53:59] you might be raptured personally
[54:02] uh there but john has been raptured then
[54:05] he's taken to glory but guess what
[54:08] happened to that man
[54:09] i'll i'll break it down what happened to
[54:11] him he walked with god
[54:13] so much that this world was not fit for
[54:14] him
[54:17] and that's what we're looking at i want
[54:18] to walk with god and let the world just
[54:20] turn me and turn me on up and down shape
[54:23] me to what they want
[54:24] until i get to a point where the world
[54:26] is just i'm like no i'm tired of this
[54:27] one i'm like come on my son
[54:30] that's what happens to individuals so
[54:32] you might make generations fine but you
[54:33] don't know what all that's
[54:34] important and plan for you the lord
[54:36] might say tonight it's time to go
[54:39] that's why we're trying to just whatever
[54:41] word comes to you don't don't reject it
[54:43] just take it because enoch walked with
[54:46] god
[54:48] and has found no more
[54:57] just make me pause and just think for a
[55:00] little bit
[55:06] and then i'm going to close in a minute
[55:08] and this brings me to the story of that
[55:11] made that the
[55:14] the ranch remember that story the
[55:16] prophet told about that made
[55:18] that was like cousins and the ranch son
[55:20] of the ranch owner
[55:21] came and they found them you know she
[55:23] was a cousin our cousins were all
[55:24] dressed beautiful
[55:25] beautifully and everyone's just you know
[55:27] lived good skimpy skirts
[55:29] he was saying oh when the man could
[55:30] demand they knew the man wasn't very
[55:31] bright when the man comes so you know we
[55:33] just dress and show them all our buddies
[55:35] and everything and
[55:35] that's what they were looking thinking
[55:37] what thing was looking for
[55:38] but he wasn't looking for that
[55:41] he was looking for a troop right and she
[55:44] wasn't made you know bashful she
[55:46] couldn't even look at his face and you
[55:47] know she was there just
[55:48] no they would push her dishes right go
[55:50] go ahead and wash those dishes i mean
[55:51] a cousin but she didn't complain because
[55:53] her nature right now was to clean
[55:55] and she's never so you know just do the
[55:57] right things and she kept doing those
[55:58] things
[55:59] not even knowing why sometimes you know
[56:02] the holy spirit puts his heart he
[56:03] doesn't know why
[56:04] it's for your purpose
[56:07] and that that lady you know we will keep
[56:09] doing that day day and night and
[56:11] they'll go to parties and everything and
[56:13] when it was time they heard always
[56:14] comment they all went to dress up and
[56:16] you know
[56:16] put some boogie boogie movies and just
[56:18] dance and everything the man was not
[56:20] even interested in that
[56:22] then they walk around and look look at
[56:23] the property because his father hold it
[56:24] properly
[56:25] he walked around and then saw the lady
[56:27] washing the dishes somewhere
[56:29] and she couldn't look at his face
[56:31] actually yeah he told her
[56:33] i'm just gonna paraphrase he told us
[56:35] that the purpose while i was here was
[56:37] looking for it
[56:41] and she was she i know i'm showing her
[56:42] mind she's like i'm not i'm not enough
[56:44] this is the kind of person you want but
[56:45] he knew what he's looking for
[56:47] let me tell you the lord knows the kind
[56:48] of bread he's looking for
[56:51] he's not looking for some wishy-washy
[56:53] you know
[56:55] naked bride somebody's looking for a
[56:56] bride that's clothed by the world
[56:59] and that's you and me he's looking for a
[57:03] bride that will
[57:04] stand correction don't care how far it
[57:06] goes
[57:08] and say lord i'll submit to whatever you
[57:10] will say that's what
[57:11] that's that's the bride the lord is
[57:12] looking for the man who was looking for
[57:15] and guess what
[57:17] he said i want you to be my bride
[57:20] but then somebody said i'll come back in
[57:21] a year stein
[57:23] what did they give a promise maybe
[57:26] sometimes i'll speak on the word the
[57:28] promise and power
[57:29] sometimes maybe we have time even in the
[57:31] future god permits
[57:33] and he gave a promise to the woman and
[57:36] said i'll come back in a year of time
[57:38] just you get dressed and then you know
[57:41] he just said what he said and he left so
[57:44] she held on
[57:45] she held on to that promise she wasn't
[57:47] playing with it so she told you know
[57:49] this got to know cause and said you
[57:53] that man can come for you look at how
[57:55] you dress your gown not flowing around
[57:56] he doesn't use two he's too dressed in
[57:58] an old fashion
[58:00] but he didn't announce it for a
[58:01] character
[58:04] he was looking for award bride was
[58:05] looking for some you know
[58:07] some some you know you know painted
[58:09] painted gold penified
[58:12] and then she she waited i'm showing her
[58:14] heart she was not preparing more what
[58:16] does it take to be a bride you know what
[58:17] are things that have to be no
[58:19] she was not working towards that promise
[58:20] that the man gave and she held on that
[58:22] promise
[58:23] and then one day
[58:28] one day that man showed up
[58:32] there's dots all over the place i mean
[58:35] and
[58:35] you know with all the entourage and
[58:37] everything and you know the now we're
[58:38] out in the horses
[58:39] gold and the galloping and just dust
[58:41] everywhere and
[58:42] the man showed up they didn't believe it
[58:47] they didn't even they didn't think you
[58:48] would come for that kind of woman
[58:50] and the man showed up he said i i came
[58:52] the promise i gave you
[58:55] and my father saw that there are many
[58:56] mansions if it were not so i wouldn't
[58:59] have told you
[59:00] but i'll give it a comforter he shall
[59:03] teach you all things
[59:06] and that man took his bride
[59:11] guess where he went to his father's
[59:13] mansion
[59:15] they were lost she was saved
[59:19] and that's what i want to also keep in
[59:21] my mind tonight after that story the
[59:23] prophet said something quickly i'll read
[59:24] that and then i'll close
[59:36] i read the scripture said some of these
[59:38] days
[59:40] we'll take a flight and go away just be
[59:43] ready
[59:45] keep the wedding garment on the wedding
[59:48] has to be pure how's the pure by the
[59:50] washing of water of the world
[59:53] keep all cruelty out of your heart
[59:55] everything
[59:56] and they read the scripture so let us be
[59:57] glad and rejoice and give honor to him
[59:59] for the marriage of the lamb has come
[1:00:01] and his wife has made herself ready to
[1:00:03] her was granted that she would be
[1:00:05] arrayed in fine linen
[1:00:06] clean and white for the final and in his
[1:00:08] righteousness of saints
[1:00:11] said praise be to god he said to me
[1:00:13] right blessed that day which are called
[1:00:16] to the marriage of the lamb
[1:00:17] and said unto me these are the true sins
[1:00:20] of god there's going to be a meeting in
[1:00:24] the air
[1:00:25] one of these days in that sweet
[1:00:28] buy-and-buy
[1:00:30] just here ready keep yourself ready
[1:00:33] purge your heart from all even thinking
[1:00:37] have faith in god no matter how dark it
[1:00:39] looks
[1:00:40] or how many lives people will make fun
[1:00:42] of you you believe even your family
[1:00:43] members will do that
[1:00:45] friends they make fun of you
[1:00:48] and say you've made a mistake keep right
[1:00:50] on living holy and leaving for god
[1:00:52] just keep moving on the hour will arrive
[1:01:01] this is all i have my brothers and
[1:01:02] sisters i don't have any special
[1:01:05] message this is as simple as it is
[1:01:08] though my up god's word find time
[1:01:12] every day and meditate on this word
[1:01:18] sermons that we're here every day you
[1:01:20] know they're on
[1:01:21] the archive you have the bible you have
[1:01:24] the messages you have the tapes
[1:01:26] and just like that word just do its work
[1:01:31] and you know it's slowly that word would
[1:01:33] change you
[1:01:34] it will touch every part of your life
[1:01:36] sometimes all you need to just just you
[1:01:38] know
[1:01:39] stay right then god's presence and just
[1:01:42] ask him to clean you
[1:01:43] and you see i'll go bring out things
[1:01:45] that you don't even kind of remember
[1:01:47] things that you've done that you
[1:01:48] overlook and go bring that this one
[1:01:50] hasn't worked out
[1:01:51] that one has worked out you might say oh
[1:01:53] i don't i don't gospel i don't do
[1:01:54] anything i mean i'm a sister i don't
[1:01:56] it might just be god touching your heart
[1:01:58] and saying to you
[1:02:01] when you're rolling your eyes and you
[1:02:03] are signing when your husband talks
[1:02:04] you're disrespecting it it might just be
[1:02:06] as simple as that
[1:02:09] and that could be an endurance to god
[1:02:11] doing the perfect work in your life
[1:02:14] that's just an example but there are
[1:02:16] many things that god has
[1:02:17] now in our lives that i mean that god
[1:02:20] has plans to take out of in our lives
[1:02:22] if we just run up to him god bless you
[1:02:32] bro
[1:02:39] three
