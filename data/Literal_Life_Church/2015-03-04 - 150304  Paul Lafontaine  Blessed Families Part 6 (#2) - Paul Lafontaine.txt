TRANSCRIPT
========================================
how shall I prove my love to him by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he in his wisdom allows to come to pass amen Lord help us how do we show our love to him by believing what he said and by conducting ourselves with joy in the midst of our trials that he ordained for us that he allows for us so help us Lord amen help us help us Lord to live that way in our trials amen I'm still trying to live Sunday's message of having the law of kindness in my tongue so now I'm got to move on to this by the grace of God praise the Lord so now so we we and I just want to make sure that I emphasize this enough after Calvary after Calvary he approved our sacrifice for our sin so he accepted you when he accepted the sacrifice so we can't apply this across the board that somehow his disapproval has come to us and his favor is gone now and he's going to kick us out and we've crossed the line no no no that that doesn't work that way when God accepted your sacrifice he accepted you so he approved You by approving the sacrifice and when you accept his sacrifice you have God's favor and approval and the curse of sin in its core nature is lifted from your life Hallelujah you have passed from death and life you have passed judgment but but you can grieve the spirit of God as we read read in Ephesians on Sunday that's how we grieve them a lot of times with our words our corrupt communication that comes out of our mouth but so now he put a you put the family in a position of trouble many times by Disobedience it's not God's disapproval or his lack of favor but it's just like we position ourselves and put our families in trouble by our disobedience uh an example of that would be our finance our finances you can be a child of God and put yourself under the bondage of debt that's right all right you can be you can have the Holy Ghost and have all that but because you disobey in certain areas it doesn't mean God's favor is not not with you that displeases him but it doesn't mean his favor is gone you've crossed the line it's over he just completely disapproves of you absolutely not we can't hang God's love on that we'd be finished if we did but you can cause God to just be displeased and Grievous spirit and you can bring your life under a curse of bondage of your finances you can bring your life under a curse because money if it's not handled right will bring a curse in your life bring bondage in your life and where does it come from from our disob our Disobedience not being obedient in certain areas can you say Amen so when we look at all the different things that the Bible says about curses it has different meanings in different places that it's mentioned but one of the first ones I want to mention to you I want I mention this because it's in relation to the families a father's blessing or a father's curse on a child uh was not just for the present because that's one of the blessings and cursing is a father this goes all the way back to the Patriarchs now that they believed back then that a father pronounced a blessing he could pronounce a blessing over a son or a curse over a son and it not just it wasn't just for the present but it had power in it and it actually extended to the rest of the Li sometimes their Destiny by what he said Noah actually he blessed two of his sons and he cursed the third one Jacob blessed all of his 12 sons and we see there we even see today what Jacob pronounced over his sons coming to pass and still being fulfilled in the children of Israel still see it happening it is and so now it is believ that the blessing and the cursed released a power and I'm reading this from a a Bible dictionary it says it is is believed that the blessing and curse released a power that effectively determined the character and Destiny of the recipient is that true is it still true today praise the Lord first of all our God pronounced the blessing over us amen Our God has a covenant over our lives the great parent the great father pronounced the blessing over our lives and so that blessing has a power within it to bring us to our Destiny can you say amen and bring a certain character at the end of all things praise God because because there's a power within that blessing so is it still true today yes it's true true today it's still true of our heavenly father he predestinated us before the foundation of the world and it it it's and it's also true because the Bible says death and life are in the power of the tongue death and life are in the power of the tongue so there's more power there than what we realize is even with us that you can pronounce something you can say something and there's power that goes with what you say sometimes whether it be a blessing or a curse and so in relation to parents we have to be careful what we say and what we pronounce over our kids because that sometimes have can have more power to it than what we realize parents speak things and not realize it has long-term effects of what they say over their children right right uh we may not do it or say something by this Vision like Jacob did Jacob was a prophet so he spoke by the vision pronouncing over his children but still there's power there in a parent that what we say over our children will have long-term effects maybe not as by Vision but your words can put a cloud over their life your negative words can put a cloud over them that they start to walk into the identity of what you call them what you label them what you say to them what what you if you're constantly focusing on their weaknesses and all that they are oh you'll never make it you'll never amount to anything and you have this weakness in your life and and that's most of your conversation uh they're going to walk into that identity because why you words still have power some of you may still be struggling even with your dad what your dad and mom pronounced over you just what they said enough comments was made in the house that you're still living underneath that cloud but if you say positive things to your children about how God made them and their special gifts and how God could use those gifts and how God is going to use those gifts and even if God's dropped it in your heart to articulate how God maybe would use those gifts in the future that's the positive things that we need to say over our kids negative words can cause them to live out what you said to them just as positive words caus them to live out what you said to them can you say amen amen praise the Lord and we've had this happen in this age a blessing was pronounced on the bride a blessing was pronounced that you're the pure virtuous bride of Jesus Christ never sinned in the first place I believe that was a pronouncement from God's Prophet for this age to his children and if we believe that it was already in the word of God but to have it echoed Again by a prophet that that truth if that really sinks down in your heart there's a security can you say man there's a truth of the blood of Jesus Christ that so washes away that you stand Justified before God just as if you never did in the first place a virgin before him the Lord hallelujah and he pronounced that blessing in this age praise the Lord he also pronounced an indictment on the entire church in the entire systems of denomination a curse on the entire thing there is no blessing that comes from that denominational system from the mother all the way down to the daughters the harlots as well it's been cursed with a curse and it can never be blessed of God never be blessed can can the people be blessed of course I always have to qualify these things now of course they can of course they can be uh moved by the Holy Spirit but the system are under a curse that's why we could never work with those systems we can love people within them they can love us we have friends in them we share the word together but we as the church could never work with a system like that not because of the people there or the pastor but the system is cursed within itself and if I brought that in here and begin to work with it then we bring ourselves under the curse of what they've been cursed by Praise the Lord amen so it's the systems in so you see these things work even with the prophet of this age and all all that's been proclaimed but the prophet proclaimed we the pure virtuous uh bride of Jesus Christ Justified and when we see it and believe it then we walk in that blessing all right so now let's just unveil unveil this a bit deeper that's a that's a truth of a blessing and cursing so we have incidences though in the scripture this is this is great this will make you shout Maybe not maybe not on a Wednesday night we have incidences in the scripture where where God turned a curse into a blessing so that's where we Rejoice tonight is that you may have something that somebody put on you your whole life because but God for a Believer can turn what they're saying and turn it into a blessing amen that's why when shimi was spitting at David and they wanted to cut his head off David said no down the road that be a may be a blessing he caught something he caught a truth can you say am man that if he's in the line of duty and he's a Son of God and he's in his position they can say whatever they want to say he's blessed anyway and God can take their cursing and turn it into a blessing that's what happened with balum that's the first example balum is that he was hired by Balo to curse the true people of God and every time he went to prophesy and do it God turned it around and he blessed them B said man I'm paying you bucks to do this and every time you spill out a prophecy it comes out of blessing why because that's God's blessed people and he was turning that prophecy around every time he tried to curse them turn around into a blessing we're under the same God my friends amen we're under the same God we're serving the same God praise the Lord amen uh Goliath even cursed David and balum he tried to curse Israel and shimi to David and so you see these things these these words prove powerless if God stepped in he is able to turn a curse into a blessing if he wants to do that amen praise the Lord that's right amen amen now then we move on to Deuteronomy 27 and we find that Moses lays out specific Cur curses and let's just read through them quickly it's another place in scripture is that it's expressing that if we Deuter Deuteronomy 27 curses come when we're disobedient to the the word and it says here in 20 chapter 27:14 and the levite shall speak and say unto all the men of Israel with a loud voice cursed be the man that maketh any Graven image or molten image and Abomination unto the Lord the work of the hands of the Craftsman and putteth in a secret place and all the people shall answer and say Amen cursed is be he that sth light by his father or his mother and all the people say amen cursed be the he that removeth uh his neighbor's landmark and all the people shall say Amen so in other words if these people if you do this in Disobedience because this tied to the law if you do this these things back then if you did these things in Disobedience there'd be a curse come on your life you're not going to be under God's blessings H cursed be he that maketh blind to wander out of the way and all the people said said amen cursed he be he that perverteth the Judgment of the stranger follow us in Widow verse 20 cursed be he that lith with his father's wife because he uncover his father's skirt and the people said amen cursed be he that lith with any manner of Beast and all the people said amen cursed cursed be he that lith with his sister the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother and all the people said amen cursed be he that lieth with his mother-in-law and all the people said amen cursed be he that smiteth his neighbor secretly and all the people said amen cursed be he that taketh reward to slay an innocent person cured be he that confires not all the words of this law to do them and all the people shall say Amen so there's the there's curses that come with disobedience that's the simple principle to it that that you're not going to be if you're uh uh willingly disobedient to clear things of the word of God you're not going to be under the blessings of God that's that's the principle we can get into technically all these things but you know a lot of these things are are still to be reverenced all these things are still to be reverenced and uh and and followed after but we have to realize that that that there's a curse that comes in Disobedience chapter 28 verse1 it shall come to pass if Thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God to observe and to do all his Commandments which I command thee this day that the Lord thy God will set thee on high above all the nations of the earth and all these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee if Thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God blessed shalt thou be in their city and blessed Thou shalt be in the field blessed you shall be the shall be the fruit of the body and the fruit of thy ground the fruit of thy cattle the increase of thy kind and the flocks of the sheep blessed shall the be thy basket and thy store blessed shalt thou Thou shalt be when thou comest in when thou goest out the Lord shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face they shall come out against thee one way and flee before the seven ways the Lord shall command the blessing upon thee in thy storehouses and all that thou set us thy hand unto do and he shall bless thee in the land which the Lord thy giveth Thee the Lord shall establish uh holy people un himself as he hath sworn unto thee if Thou shalt keep the Commandments of the Lord thy God and walk in his way so now now we see from the obedient heart from the heart obedience brings the blessings of God and he he and guess what looks look how he touches almost every area of your life when God touches it it's blessed blessed this and bless that bless your cattle and I don't know what all that back in that day I guess people wanted them to bless their cattle we don't have cattle here anybody have cattle but catch the principle bless my basket I mean something about basket there he shall bless your basket I don't know what that is but I want him to bless it you know Sunday I was reading that Proverbs 31 Woman I might as well say this and I brought out she was from Toledo because she could deal with the snow and I was text by uh someone in the church and says did you also read that she dresses her children in Scarlet not Ma and blue I said no I did not bring that out cuz I don't think that you can interpret it that way you're right you gotta be careful how you interpret the word now for sure but but look at look at how it is it's it's real simple it's that it's it's it comes down to an obedient heart to the things of God and if that if you lose that obedient heart and you start to say well that's not important anymore and you start to you and ultimately you find in your heart you just don't want to do those things then you're moving yourself away from God's world and God's blessing and all the package that goes with it right you're doing that God's not doing that you're doing that and then look at all the areas he can touch with blessing of your life just simply by obedience doesn't mean that you understand everything I don't find any scriptures here that say yeah you understand it that's right but you're being obedient to it so all the blessings of God pour and touches every area of your life just simply because of obedience to the word of God Amen has that principle changed no no because we can look at Romans 66 and16 it says know ye not that to whom you yield yourself servants to obey his servants ye are to whom you obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience un righteousness but God be thank that ye were the Servants of sin but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of Doctrine which was delivered unto you the principle goes in the New Testament uh Even book of Acts says he gave the Holy Ghost to them that obey him praise God obedience being the core thing there amen uh and he says but to me in the New Testament it goes deeper it's a deeper obedience because remember what I've been preaching that in the Old Testament on a soul level there's no way they could follow those precepts at a soul level because they had a serpent nature and Calvary hadn't come to deal with that serpent nature exactly right all right so here they had to follow him but it was mechanical they did it with all their heart their their emotions and their spirit and passion I believe they did but you see now from the heart of in the New Testament our obedience goes even deeper in the New Testament because it's required now that we do it from the heart that you have obeyed from the heart that form of Doctrine which was delivered unto you praise the Lord it says in 2 Corinthians 6:5 it says casting down imaginations and every High thing that exist exed itself above the knowledge of God against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought see how much deeper our obedience there's nothing said so much about this in the Old Testament but now we're bringing into obedience every thought captive to Christ praise God our obedience goes deeper in the New Testament exactly right because now we're obeying from the heart and now we're bringing any every thought captive to The Obedience of Christ the Lord just our outside and you know we don't do this we don't smoke and we don't drink and all these other things but every thought is under obedience we don't allow ourselves to just let our thoughts go off and as we said Sunday we don't give oursel permission for our words to say anything we want to say no they're under a law they're held by a law and so now our obedience grows deeper because we're we're now bringing every thought captive praise the Lord so now then then we find at the beginning of the Bible not me not going to comment too much on this but there's the things about the curses and blessings and and in the beginning Genesis chapter 3 we find that God begins Cur putting curses on certain things after the fall and those things even still continue till today and that's what they have to realize if there's a pronouncement of a curse some of those things are continuing even until today uh uh in in in and God cursing the Earth for for Adam he cursed the Earth and now we're still dealing with that curse it's going to be over some someday he's going to lift that curse because he went to Calvary and when he purchased an atonement for us he also purchased an atonement to redeem this Earth as well so we'll go back to Eden again can you say Amen so he's going to lift that curse but he he pronounced it back there and it's still on the Earth right amen he pronounced it on the serpent as well he pronounced the curse on the serpent it's still that way today praise the Lord so we could say that only God Only God Can lift a curse but when he lifts it he lifts it praise the Lord but now when we come to our text we realize here's a different type of thing with the family of Ain the Ain family here's a different type of curse it's different because it's there's a command that when you destroy Jericho the city is cursed and the stuff with it uh let's go go to that scripture because I want to make sure you know that where that says that that we were in Joshua chapter 7 oh some judges and so he says it here in Joshua chapter 6 and verse 17 and the city shall be accursed even it and all that are therein to the Lord only Rahab the Harlot shall live she and all that are with her in the house because she hid The Messengers that we sent she also had the token that they had asked for but everything else besides Rahab is under a curse everything that was in there right under a curse so that God proclaimed it there now when they went into fight the the the battle went great but somebody took the initial stage of the the the aen family uh somehow now brought something and put it into their tent hid it in their tent and so now there's trouble coming from the thing that they felt like that they could take into their tent trouble starts happening when you have a curse come in trouble starts happening there are things that we learn from this Saints I'm trying to keep this just as simple as I can but we learn something about this and that is that there are certain things that carry trouble with it and if we're going to act like the world or or some shallow Christian we're going to just say we're going to just pretend and be blind that it's not causing trouble but if it's causing trouble you got to fess up to it music many types of music bring the reaction and behavior of rebellion sometimes you can't tell it until maybe weeks down the road but certain types of music bring that manifestation of rebellion right bring a certain culture to it bring a thing that I want to dress like the world I want to act like I want to be sensual I want to be sexy uh some sometimes you don't have to see an image of a woman it comes with the spirit of the music and all a sudden the girl she wants to dress that way and it's coming through the music right so there's trouble that comes with that because that of course is not in Oneness with the direction that the the dad wants to leave the leave the home and so Trouble Comes and conflict comes and a lack of Oneness comes and it's not the kid and it's not you and it's not it's just something has come in that's causing trouble something's breaking the Oneness right so we really learned for that that there's there's trouble and the trouble the trouble was not seen until they went into the next battle right did you notice that the trouble was not detected until they had the next battle and they failed in the next battle that's right so that's really uh we should hold that in our hearts that sometimes we can't detect something but when we go about battling with the Enemy and go in our Christian walk and we realize wait a minute it it wasn't like it was before something's missing Something's Happened and you realize in this incident it was something that was cursed that was brought in and brought trouble with it and so if it hinders your spiritual battle then we've got to fess up and say hey something's happening here can you say Amen let me say this a Christian Life Is A Life That's fighting for your spiritual inheritance a Christian Life is in constant battle can you say amen and we have an enemy and we Pro we approach that battle with the confidence expecting a victory in every battle now it's you can't the Bible says in James a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways and so when he even goes to pray you can't have a a a a doubtful uh spirit when you go to pray that you don't really believe it's going to happen but I'm supposed to pray this and say this no he do that's double-mindedness when we go to pray we go with complete expectation and complete 100% confidence that God is is able to answer our prayer that's how God wants to us to approach it it's up to him what he does how he does it how long it takes but when we approach him he doesn't want double-mindedness and so now even when we go to battle the enemy he doesn't want us hesitating and he doesn't want us thinking I may not win this one he wants us expecting to win every battle amen that's how we approach battle as a Christian I'm going about this I'm I'm getting up this morning morning I'm going about this day to win and to overcome today not oh man I don't I don't even want to get up today come on now does that sound familiar to you I don't even want to get out of bed and that's when the Devil he's already intimidating you he don't even want to get out of bed I got him already but I like how brother Donnie says he gets up and says here I am devil I'm ready for you there's a confidence there can you say m and and and then all of Hell goes oh Lord she's up she got out of bed I'm going to have to deal with this daughter of God today I want to live such a Christian Life friends that it shakes hell every day they're scared to death of what I might sing what I might say what I might testify of how I might praise the lord they're nervous they're shaking in their boots because how I'm going to live that day and that's the way it should be every day amen that's good not intimidated by the enemy but going forward and being aggressive in our battle and expecting victories can you say Amen not double-minded but expecting victories we fight to win yes Winning is Everything To Us amen don't apply that to volleyball but apply it to your battle in with the Enemy can you say Amen so now this to We Fight to win this is our priority as a Christian I said it at the beginning of the service I'm going to say it again this this is our priority as a Christian anything that stands in the way of you becoming a Spirit-filled full of Faith mature growing and conquering more than uh more than a conquering type believer anything that stands in that way is your enemy yes amen because that's the goal there is no other goal can you say that's why we're here that's why we are Christians it's not to be a nominal Christian or a a status quo Christian but an overcoming Christian a testifier Christian a Praying Christian a Spirit-filled Christian am can I get an amen amen that's the goal that's what we need to be that's if you don't feel like you're there tonight then make that your goal say God I want to be that type of Christian amen because that's what it's all about is being overcoming a a more than conqueror uh believer standing there it's not to make money or be good in the community community or to do these different things or you know it's not just that but it's to be an overcoming Christian it even goes above Outreach it goes above our witness to the world you know why I say that because really if you're not a Spirit-filled Christian you don't really have that Faith testimony to to be salty to somebody you're going to outreach amen they don't want to see a dead cold formal person that feels like they're under bondage so what's first our w no our first is staying spirit filled so that we're ready to be a proper witness blessed be his name praise the Lord talk to God about the people before you talk to the people about God Amen that's what brother Ram said talk to God about the people before you talk to the people about God good you're not in close harmony with him all the that's why we want to stay anointed if if I know my commission and know my position like to doing walking in that and know my place and I'm anointed for the job then I don't have to worry about what I'll have to be what I'll have to say he'll give it to me to say in that hour Jesus said don't pre-think what you're going to say it'll be given to you in that hour when you're brought up before the councils and you're brought up here and you're you're challenged and put on trial but like Jesus said by the world put on trial when you're put up there he said we're not leaning on our intellect we're leaning on the anointing that's within usen and he'll give you what to say in that hour if you stay spirit filled stay prayed up stay fasting and praying and stay before him that's right this is a Christian walk this is our goal it's becoming a person that goes from Victory to Victory to Victory inheriting God's promise and even the promise of the Rapture can you say Amen have I described is this your desire tonight this is the Christian that we want to be going from from Victory to Victory inheriting God's promises taking a hold of God's promises we expect this life because he said he would fight for us and that's what he said in Joshua 1 Joshua 1 I'll fight my battle I'll fight the battles for you they didn't have to do anything but stand there in obedience and shout and blow the horns at Jericho and God brought all the walls down God fought God did the work am that's a perfect battle Jericho was a perfect battle right it's the way it's supposed to happen and when you have the perfect one to start out with Joshua was going into Ai and Joshua was going what happened what's going wrong right because he said he'd fight our battles for us right and he would destroy the enemy and all these other promises he makes and all of a sudden now they lose 36 men and Joshua was crying out to God in chapter 7 verse 7 and Joshua said alas oh Lord God wherefore hast thou at all brought this people into Jordan to deliver us into the hand of the amorites to destroy us would to God we had been content and one on the other side of Jordan oh Lord what shall I say when Israel turth their backs before the enemies verse 6 says Joshua Ren his clothes and fell to the Earth upon his face before the Ark of the Lord until the evening tide he ritten his clothes he fell down before God what over over a battle that wasn't didn't go like it should go that's how we should live that's how we should live amen Lord what's going wrong what happened Lord why did I fail in this battle what happened here what's what's going on I was I'm an overcomer in this hour something's wrong that I can't overcome this or I didn't follow through with this or something happened and I lost this battle do we have that cry in our heart Lord what happened show me in my life what's wrong this Sunday when I go to church have the minister be anointed to put his finger on that thing in my life something's wrong that's how I go to church let him let him rip my hide if he has to let him expose everything that's secret let him take every let him talk about every Babylonian garment that I'm hiding because it's about winning victories not about justifying what I want to hold on to in my life and hide it's about winning victories as a Christian can you say amen that's what we're here for not to blend in and be become so that we blend in better no we're here to win victories and live the manifested of Jesus Christ in this hour am Hallelujah so Joshua cried out at AI he says something went wrong why he's expecting Victory that's the way it should be expecting the victory that it should be if not we've got to find the trouble and what killed it was a family that chose to use something that carried trouble with it chose to bring it into their tent and they couldn't see the trouble until later are we getting the point tonight isn't the Bible just Rich isn't the word Rich isn't it relevant for our lives right now they brought something in that they didn't notice was going to bring trouble but it started to bring trouble it had it brought a curse on the whole thing and they couldn't see it and there were there are many things that carry a curse with it and we must look for it if you know it is before and someone's warned you of it then really we should stay away from it anyway all right but a lot of times we don't do that I don't care that brother Paul said it I don't care some of the older ones in the church that have grown in the Lord they learned been there done that got the T-shirt no I'm gonna do this I'm gonna I'm gonna have this if someone else has said that brings death in your life that kills your Christian walk we got to listen to them amen you got a host of Christians that are inheriting the promises you got like like I I I'd follow brother Lonnie and Brother Rich Cobb and all these different ones these older ones that I could see in their lives they inherit their Pro they weren't perfect but they were inheriting the promises of God they were moving on to the maturity of God they were moving on of what a Christian should be and uh and a lot of times I thought brother Lonnie I would think you know I appreciate being around him but I realize that some of stuff I'm struggling with and trying to overcome and this like you know I'll bet he he overcome that years ago if I was to talk to him about that it's kind of like he he'd go yeah yeah been there done that and he's he's overcome it he won that battle a long time ago it's nice to be around people like that but it's also nice to be around them when they say listen I I tried that and that brought trouble in my life I tried to do that and I tried to do this and tonight I'm not giving specifics but you know I can I'm not going to make anybody angry here tonight tonight I want you to take a principle that's laying right here in the Bible and realize you better check what you bring in your homes what you listen to in music what you let your eyes see everything you do on it may carry a curse with it right on clothing styles carry a spirit with them amen so in movies and music and all these other things and guess what another thing ideas come on now good the wisdom of this world some of it can carry curse with it exactly right brother and trouble start to come and you look for what's happening and the main thing is there's a loss in spiritual life and a dad has to say there's a loss here in my family there's a loss here and I appreciate any man that's taking a look at that and saying what's what's the cause of the loss what's the reason and that man as a man addresses that and finds out what it is and makes changes whatever changes have to be made amen amen if if you if if you are not growing and feeding then you have a responsibility to pray and find the church the pastor the place where your family and wife is growing and feeding on the word of God don't let that go on cuz because that's not good right right find that because that's crucial that's everything that you're growing and becoming an overcoming Christian Every Man Has a responsibility to do that but I want to say the wisdom of this world it can carry a curse with it it can carry trouble with it can you say Amen to where we we some we quit growing we we we're feeding on things that's wrong we start losing battles we're feeding on worldly things that we didn't do before we're falling away from the Lord and somebody has to say it's not supposed to be this way where am I at now what's going on with my life I mean something's changed and I'm actually hungering for those things and I'm and and I I'm wanting those things that I didn't want before and you have to take into account that something is cursed or something's bringing that trouble hindering your walk with the Lord man's ideas thoughts Som times that are presented on the internet ideas the wisdom of this world can carry a curse with it the interpretations concluded on at Nia still carry a curse with them today right it's been cursed ever since then till today when they concocted the three persons in the Trinity that had a curse on it from that point and it still has a curse on it today so that's man's ideas getting WEA getting together and discussing the word and coming up with man's conclusion on a truth that lays there that God is in three offices but they interpreted their way and soon as they did a curse came on it and then if someone who believes it comes into that they come under the same curse exactly right so thoughts can carry curse movies all these other things I'm not going to be specific I want you to take it as a Christian to realize you you have to examine your own life you have to see if there's trouble that comes in your spiritual walk you ask the Lord to expose it and you say do I have something that I'm hiding in my life praise the Lord adoption brother Ram says as we just bring it to a close tonight the land was provided and divvied up by inspiration and I could take the scriptures and show you to it exactly that he put them in the place where they were supposed to be positionally in the promised land how that two and a half tribes was to stay across the river how that their mothers cried that in that birth and how that that place that each place was supposed to be and now after you are in that don't mean that you're out free from war you still have to fight for every inch inch of ground that you stand on Canaan did not represent Heaven because its war and its troubles and its killings and its fightings and so forth but it did represent this that a man must be a perfect walk and there's where the church is failing today on that walk do you know that even your uh your own behavior can knock somebody else out of getting healed your misbehavior of unconfessed Sins Of You Believers can cause this church to bitterly fail that's right and at the day of judgment you'll be responsible for every bit of it oh you say now wait a minute brother Brown well that's the truth of it think of it your misbehavior and uncon confess sin unconfessed sin has great effects uh terrible effects upon the body of Christ and families that's right terrible effect on a family had a daddy that's held something and not confessed it before the Lord or to his wife for many years it's going to have profound effects on that family and those children and nobody knows what's what's trouble what's going on what what's taking place well somebody hasn't confessed a sin it's just laying there and brother BR says the devil has a right to sit right there on unconfessed sin that demon has a right to stay there until it's confessed and then demons are cast out through confession Joshua after he crossed over the land God gave them a promise just think to fight an entire campaign without losing a man without even getting a scratch without having to have a nurse or first aid or Band-Aid God said the land's yours go fight think of a fighting campaign and there's no Red Cross around at all that was Jericho there's no Red Cross there's no nobody going to get hurt and they slayed the amorites and Hittites but there wasn't one hurt among them any of them until sin come in the camp and when achen took that Babylon garment in the cold wedge and hid it under his Camp then the next day they lost 16 men Jos Joshua said stop stop wait a minute wait a minute there's something wrong something is wrong here we're we're going to call seven days of fast God made a promise there will be nothing hurt us our enemies will fall at our feet and there's something wrong here something went wrong somewhere because we've got 16 dead laying here they're Israelite brothers it wasn't 16 it was 36 brother Bram said 16 and it was um according to chapter 7 verse 5 it was 36 we got 16 maybe more I believe 16 men that was dead Joshua called and said there's something wrong God made the promise and and something's wrong and when we bring the sick up before us and they fail to be healed we need to call a solemn fast and call an assembly something's wrong somewhere God made the promise God's got to stick to that promise and he will do it amen amen and amen praise the Lord that we could actually have a part in affecting somebody I know none of you would want to do that would you if someone come up for prayer and they really need healing healing none of you in your hearts would want to say that I want to be the hindrance to them getting the H all of us say no I want them to get healed because I know how I feel when I'm sick right and if I got a disease or something like that I want the people of God to cry out and I want my healing to I want wouldn't want anybody hindering my healing and so because I know that about you that sincerely you wouldn't want to but you might have blinders on to realize that sometimes if there's a curse on something and you're justifying it that could be the thing that could limit the power of God and the Spirit flowing in the assembly as long as you know that that's a possibility and examine your life and say I don't want to be the I don't want my family to be the the aen family I don't want my family to be the aen family I want my family to be a family of faith I want my family to be a family of Holiness how many believe in Holiness true Holiness I want my family to be a family that's faithful to God I want my family even with all of our and mistakes and everything else to be constantly laying Our Lives before God I want my teach my children to be repentant that they know how to repent when they and to own up to it if they do something wrong if they bring a bad spirit in the home or something to to say I made a mistake pops forgive me let's go to go God and ask forgiveness I love it when Brokenness is in my children all the mistakes doesn't matter if you have Brokenness and sensitivity to the spirit of God being welcome in the home and if somebody does something or brings in this or the song and you know of course I'm you know I I sniff things out un like brother Diggs you know I try to sniff things out too quickly but oh how I love it when the whole family's in harmony to keep their discernment on to always be watching if something's changed the tone of the home would to God we had teenagers and children and parents everyone with that kind of sensitivity brother Ram says that I want to live such a life to the least little bit of grieving I would know it right away soon as I find out to make it right in Brokenness and say let's let's correct this right now because the quality of his presence in our home is priority us walking with him and his presence being here and something that that drives that presence away that's not in harmony with what we stand for and what we believe oh my family we got a long way to go I'm just being honest with you we got a long way to go but in the word is the goal and let me leave you with this guess what the next chapter chapter8 you know what God says first he says and ain's family they were stoned the curse was purged in the children of Israel you know what God says the first chapter first thing he says chapter 8 vers1 and the Lord said unto Joshua fear not NE neither be this dismayed take all the people of war with thee and arise and go up to AI I have given into thy hand the king of AI and his people and his City and his God didn't waste no time the curse is gone it's time to get back in the battle again and I want you to go to AI first Lord we failed there now no AI I want you to AI God's that way friends he doesn't want to sit with a pity party with you with all the stuff you've done wrong amen he doesn't want you to go in depression for three months over what you did wrong bring it underneath the blood of Jesus Christ and get back in the battle amen put it under the blood and get back in the battle the next day go back to AI can you say amen that's our God because once a curse has been lifted God's ready to go again God's ready to bless you again God's ready to put you under his blessings again once the curse has been lifted amen praise God let's Stand Together praise the Lord it's exactly right friends that's how God's nature is not to sit around and be in the mully grubs over what happened but to move on get back into battle get back to AI again get back to overcoming again praise the Lord amen how many want to be a true Overcomer in Leo deia amen I do friends and I believe by the grace of God we can do that can we pray together how many say pray for me brother Paul amen I want to live the word I want to walk in his word I want to walk in his precepts praise the Lord father I do pray for the hearts of the people as they sit and hear the word I pray for me Lord as well Lord our family is a a long way to go in
