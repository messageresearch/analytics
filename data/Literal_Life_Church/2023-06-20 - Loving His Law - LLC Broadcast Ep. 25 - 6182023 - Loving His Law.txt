hi everybody Pastor Paul LaFontaine and literal Life Church in Petersburg Michigan would like to invite you to take the next half hour and enjoy some time in the word of God if you're hungry for more of Christ we believe you can be fed and we pray that you'll be blessed visit our website for more information at literallife.church may God bless you my friend and may the music and message encourage you today thank you [Music] another God foreign [Music] anything we thank you [Music] for God Alone [Music] that's just the way [Music] you were gone [Music] let's party [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] this word is forever [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] happy birthday [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] inside nobody else [Music] thou has dealt well with thy servant O Lord according to Thy word teach me good judgment and knowledge for I have believed thy Commandments before I was afflicted I went astray before I was afflicted I went astray but now have I kept Thy word thou art good and do us good teach me thy statues the proud have forged a lie against me but I will keep thy precepts with my whole heart their heart is as fat as Greece but I Delight in thy law it is good for me that I have been Afflicted that I might learn thy statues look at the good that comes out of being Afflicted going through things that's a pretty strong word being Afflicted he said it's good for me to be afflicted because what I learn out of it is your statues the law of thy mouth is better unto me than a thousands of gold and silver 97 skip to verse 97. oh how I love thy law it is my meditation all the day oh how I love that's what I'd like to title this tonight loving his law because law and the the the talk about the law of God has a bad connotation to it right and Satan's done that has a bad connotation but here's a man of God especially after he had sinned now he's saying Lord I love thy law I love the law of God I love the precepts of God there's not too many people say that but he's come to a place that I want to come to Lord I love thy law you'd have to understand the power behind God's law in order to say that I love thy law you don't have your people saying it you don't hear too many people that are Lawless saying it I love the law they want to get rid of policemen and be a lawless nation and sometimes you have teeny teenagers you'll never hear them saying I love the rules of this house I love the laws of this home you rarely hear it saying you don't hear people saying concerning the laws of God but David's saying it Lord I love thy law it is my meditation all the Day verse 113 if you would 113 I hate vain thoughts but thy law do I love verse 163. verse 163. I hate and abhor lying but thy law do I love in verse 165 great peace have they which love thy law how many want peace tonight great peace have they that love thy law and nothing shall offend them now this Psalm 119 is set apart in very special uh in itself because of it keeps having a theme to it and the theme is in all uh 176 verses of it that's the amazing thing if you read it the theme runs through all uh 176 verses it's I believe I think it's the longest you'll have to correct me if I'm wrong but I think it's the longest Psalm that's in the Book of Psalms and it's the 119th Psalm but what's interesting is about it it has a theme in every verse and we're going to talk about this really the theme is loving his law loving his precepts David's saying I love your Commandments and so you correct me on this as well if you read it through I could only find two verses that don't mention these things every verse besides two and I mean it now coming correct me if you find me wrong okay that's fine I only found two verses that didn't have these things in every verse his his law his word his precepts his testimonies his Commandments his judgments and his statutes are in every verse but two so I think we know the theme and that is he has come to a place that he loves his law he loves his precepts he loves his Commandments everything that's come from God he's in love with him and he's not running from them he's not questioning them he's come into the world that this is the only world to live in is God's precepts God's quotes God's what do you ever want to whatever you want to call him they're quotes from God and they come through God's prophets there's quotes of Moses that's the quotes of the prophet and so he's living on all the quotes and he's valuing all the quotes he's saying this all has meaning to me and I I'm not running from it I'm not resisting it I'm not bucking up against it I may want to understand some of them more but there's one thing for sure I have learned I love your law so all these things are what God spoke to his people through his Prophet all these things are things God spoke to his people through his Prophet back at that time and I don't know if he had uh had this strong love for them before he broke the law himself how many eurasians say David broke the law himself David brought broke the thing that thou shall not commit adultery and he was with another woman that was not his his wife and not taken as his wife so he broke that so I don't know if David come into this deeper love for the law of God after he made a mistake a lot of times we do if we're really broken and we're real sincere about our sin then we develop a deeper love for what we ignored in other words he had to trample upon a bunch of precepts as a king he had to ignore and say this doesn't apply to me and it's not important he had to make it less important in order to commit adultery with Bathsheba he had to trample upon or he didn't forget because he knew but he had to say you know what I'm I'm taking a vacation I'm taking a vacation from certain laws of God because I want this woman sometimes after we make a mistake and we defy and go against God's law we pay for it because how many know David paid for it we can pay there's something but there's something good that we get out of it can you say man and that is maybe what David got was such this deep deep love for the law of God I don't want to ever ever resist it again I don't want to trample upon it these things are not just words in a book they're just not words in the tablet but God gave them to me to protect me God gave them to me to keep me guarded from the things that I would get into and now I'm not looking for ways around them I love them all I know is that his life was 100 percent trustworthy of what God said there's not an ounce of question or resistance in David he's basically saying I may not have been all in before but I'm all in now I love your precepts I love your law so this this life of David that he come into it would be another extreme of what we see in the world today this would be the Other Extreme of what we see in the world because the world is mocking the precepts of God the world is saying it's out of date the world is saying it doesn't work world the world says many in the world say there you know there is no God number one but then a lot of them are saying if this is God this has no value anymore that's crazy stuff that's stupid stuff so this is if you have that extreme that you live in in the world that there's no value for the precepts of God in other words God says something and they decide whether it's relevant or not and they dump it out that's the world we live in I think David is the Other Extreme of the world we live in and that is he's not just in between but he's actually saying they're saying I hate God's laws I don't need God's laws I don't need to live my life according to God's word and David's saying I can't live without the laws of God I can't function without the precepts of God the littlest little detail on how to live I need it to live by but here I love the law and guess what this is David's saying this before Calvary so before the possibility is the holy spirit coming in in an image individual and living the law by the spirit this is before the spirit is on the soul yet this is before Calvary this is this is way before there's any possibility of of the laws being written in the heart or in the Soul by the Holy Ghost before that David's already saying I love it I want to live by it that's amazing friends because we got the blessing of calvary we've got the blessing of living a holy ghost life the amen are on the inside that in the soul when the flesh even says I don't want it the soul says amen Lord I want it I desire thy laws I want your word I want what your Prophet said I want it I want it it was sent for me it's not sent for everybody it's that's the reality of it I wish the whole world could receive it but it's not sent for everybody I want the love of God in my heart that I know that it's set for me and I want to embrace it I want to take all of it can you say amen and so they had nothing to live it by the spirit but David loves it anyway he Embraces it David changes his attitude towards the statues and precepts of God his mind had changed to love them and not to try to get around them because human nature and the serpent nature is to get around the laws of God but you see now God breathes on a generation to give us precepts and principles that are meant for the generation as well that's just the way I believe it because the people in Moses they would have had to believe the same thing the people that Nathan's they would have had to believe the same thing the people in Isaiah and Jeremiah because there were other prophets and some of them would have said no you know what I'm sticking with what he said back there but yet Jeremiah it was addressed forcing the children of Israel going into idols and different things so now he had to address what was going on for the day can you say amen and so you couldn't say well I'm going to believe this prophet and not this one no because God's breathing on a generation saying I love my people that I may give some precepts for them to be able to understand for their day in their own language you ought to thank God it's in English for you a lot of countries don't have that don't have as they have so much access but God breathed on this generation God brought his word to our generation and it's more up to date I think I said this Sunday I preached this Sunday and I don't have as many here but I'm going to preach anyway tonight this word is more up to date than anything I've found it's more up to date than it ever was it's more relevant than it ever has been he gave us his word and he's put Protections in place and you start playing with them then you're going to have you're going to open yourself up to Spirits in your home in your mind in your life God's put Protections in place Mr said Luther Martin Luther said this if you preach the gospel with all of its aspects with the exception of dealing with the issues specifically for your time you are not preaching the gospel at all because the convictions of the Gospel the gospel is the good news when you preach Redemption when you preach it's for your age too and when you preach it you're going to be blasting out and warning people of The Temptations of the age but you're not just going to keep preaching The Temptations and keep preaching that this world is all dirty and the spirits are there you're going to bring around a hope in Calvary and the good news I've got an atonement for you I've got an answer for you it hasn't changed since Calvary I don't care how bad the modern day gets his blood is powerful enough to change a life his blood reaches to the deepest Mirey clay his blood has the answer for any depression his blood has the answer from any mental breakdown can you say mine his power is there for us he gave it to us we just have to receive it now Josh McDonald says some things here a couple things about the principles of God and then we'll just bring it to a close two teenagers bored on a hot summer night remember that a neighbor has a backyard pool they also remember that the neighbors are on vacation they decide to sneak over to enjoy a refreshing swim they giggle as they clamor over the tall backyard fence willfully ignoring the posted signs no trespassing and no swimming the girl cautiously makes her way across the unlit backyard as her boyfriend races to the diving board with one hard bounce he hits his body he throws his body high into the air the girl's laugh turns to a shriek as she reaches the pool's Edge and realizes there is no water in that pool the impact of the boy's dive snaps his neck instantly paralyzing him for life so Josh McDowell makes the comment the homeowners didn't post the warnings to make to take the fun from the boy's life but to protect those who are around the pool in choosing to disregard the posted warnings he moved himself into a dangerous spot I say it again in choosing because it's a choice everybody right when God has his precepts in front of us and the world wisdom of the world it's a choice it's a choice after what I preach Sunday it's a choice got to choose and in choosing to disregard posted warnings because as I preached Sunday some things are not you have you've sinned already but this has the potential to lead you into sin this is a warning sign this is something be careful this that could lead in this direction can you say Amen they ignored and by choosing to disregard posted warnings I think the message has a lot of posted warnings for us in doing that he this kid moved himself into Danger and so he's like this young man we often don't see the looming dangers or we minimize the consequences of stepping into sin how much can it hurt we ask ourselves unfortunately you and I have a very limited perspective God on the other hand sees every possible scenario and their resulting joys and sorrows we have a very limited perspective but God has the greatest perspective and God sees every possible scenario and the resulting Joys and sorrows George you should say Joys or Sorrows because the scenarios could be joys or could be Sorrows God sees all that he sees the scenarios he says have you ever entered one of those corn mazes and they're having those now I don't know if you've been through a corn maze yet but at every Junction in a corn maze you're saying should I turn right should I turn left perhaps and you're trying to figure out the corn means okay trying to go through it and with every Wrong Turn and Dead End you get more confused about where you are in the maze and the location of the correct path leading to the exit if you only had a bird's eye view it would be a lot easier can you say Amen if you had a guide a trustworthy Source perch the top of a real high ladder you'd have help in making the right choices to successfully navigate the maze in life we can consistently make right choices and enjoy much good in life by following God's guidelines and God's boundaries can you say Amen he has a much taller ladder he's looking from a much taller place and he sees this maze how many would agree we're in a maze of this world how many would agree that the young people were in her maze a corn maze trying to navigate which direction to go it was way worse than it was 20 years ago way worse than it was 10 years ago it's a corn maze how wonderful it would be and how wonderful it is I can tell you tonight we've got a god with a bird's eye view let's take it further we got a guy with an we got a god with an eagle's View because God the Great Eagle is looking from the top and he can see go this way go this way go this way and this will get you out of this world and bring you to a rapture I said it'll bring you to a rapture this word this word is not just to keep us holy Christians it's to bring us to a rapture do you believe that he's he's he's saying God says it this way do you believe that I love you and want to bless you with provision and protection then commit to my boundaries they are good they are for your good because I am good from God's Eternal perspective God does life with us asking do you want to avoid heartache in your life follow my priesthoods don't deviate you want to avoid addiction follow my precepts don't deviate you want to be successful in business follow my precepts don't deviate from it you want to experience true meaningful love follow my precepts and don't deviate from them you might have to wait for genuine real love but don't ever go away from his precepts but sometimes we get in our heads that we know better than God so we make willful choices outside of his boundaries and then must suffer the consequences so we should spend time reflecting in our life and how choosing to live with God's boundaries has protected you but also look at the times you willfully Step Beyond his umbrella of protection and had to endure the Fallout here's the thing about Sin the repercussions aren't always immediately evident sometimes we think we've gotten away with it but sin eventually demands our payment unless we each come to understand and this is important unless we each come to understand God loves me and I can trust him we will never walk through life dependent on the character of God to make the right choices I'm going to say it again I'm not you see this is before you can talk about dress you can talk about boundaries you can talk about rules all you want to but something has to drop deeper and this is what d That's what I said about David he said I love thy law David's not saying I have to do this he's saying I love it he come to a place I love it I love your precepts the more the more detail that God's made it for me the better I embrace it I love it I haven't I'm not bucking up against it when I read that quote of Moses when I read that quote of the Prophet Nathan when I read that thing I'm all over it I'm saying Lord you said that for a reason and I would never dump that out there's got to be a reason that you said it I love it because of this unless we come to understand that God loves me and I can trust him don't mess with God's boundaries don't mess with God's precepts it if God said it I believe it that settles it I love his law I love his word Lord I want you to know tonight I may not understand every detail of this word but I want him to know I love this word I trust this word I have a full confidence in it and that's what we need in young people we need a group of people to rise and say I have one honor 100 confidence in this word and the message of Christ for the last days and I'm all in I'm all in thank you for watching our message today if
