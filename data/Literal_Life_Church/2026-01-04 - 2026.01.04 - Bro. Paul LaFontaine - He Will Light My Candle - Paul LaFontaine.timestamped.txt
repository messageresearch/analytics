[28:45] Typical to Lefontines. We're making the
[28:47] decision right now. What we're singing
[28:49] and that's just the way it happens,
[28:51] right? This is the first time I've seen
[28:52] them all week pretty much.
[28:58] Solomon conclude it all is vanity
[29:06] and now my heart believes
[29:10] that it is true.
[29:15] Took me all this time to find reality
[29:23] that all I ever really want is you.
[29:33] All that really counts.
[29:38] All that's really true.
[29:42] All that really matterers, Lord, is you.
[29:52] Everything to gain,
[29:57] nothing else to lose.
[30:01] All I ever really want is you.
[30:10] So take the grandest thing you know that
[30:15] this life can give
[30:19] and weigh it with eternity
[30:24] bright side.
[30:29] One thing I have learned
[30:32] in all this life I live
[30:37] that there is truly nothing good
[30:42] but God. How many will agree this
[30:44] morning? You're all that really counts.
[30:52] All that's really true.
[30:56] All that really matterers, Lord, is you.
[31:05] Everything to gain,
[31:10] nothing else to lose.
[31:14] All I ever really want is you.
[31:22] All that really counts.
[31:27] All that's really true.
[31:28] &gt;&gt; All that's really true.
[31:31] &gt;&gt; All that matters.
[31:33] &gt;&gt; All that really matters. All
[31:37] &gt;&gt; is you is you. Everything together
[31:46] mountain
[31:51] all I ever
[31:54] want
[31:54] &gt;&gt; it's just you.
[32:00] All I ever really want is you.
[32:10] All I ever
[32:12] really want
[32:16] is
[32:18] you.
[32:26] That's my design. Is that your design?
[32:33] Hallelujah. Well, I'm not giving up. No,
[32:37] no, no. I'm not turning around.
[32:43] By the grace of God, I'm going to wear a
[32:47] shining crown
[32:50] someday.

[33:38] on.
[33:42] I've been walking through the valley
[33:47] through this spell of tears
[33:50] and at times I've even questioned even
[33:55] if my Lord is near and many times that
[34:00] old devil
[34:02] he says why not turn around
[34:07] you can't get any further
[34:10] because of or just losing ground, but

[34:58] won't let God's children be laed
[35:05] and determined
[35:06] to get right in the way
[35:11] and lead us from the way of life and
[35:15] lead our soul? Somebody standing. I'm

[36:41] to the next hand.
[36:44] Oh, I'm not giving up. No, I'll keep
[36:49] going.
[37:00] Praise the Lord.
[37:02] Amen. Let's give our Lord.
[37:12] They want to continue doing that. They
[37:14] want to keep singing that one. Praise
[37:16] the Lord. I love to tell the devil. I'm
[37:18] not giving up. Amen.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's a good New
[37:22] Year's resolution.
[37:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Doesn't matter what happens, what
[37:26] comes our way. We're not going to give
[37:28] up. It's because something within us.
[37:30] Praise the Lord. Doesn't matter what
[37:32] you're facing this morning. Make that
[37:34] confession. You know, I've appreciated
[37:35] the last few days. My daughter, uh,
[37:37] she's in the hospital and some high
[37:39] blood pressure and she's got the baby
[37:41] coming. So, I ask for your prayers for
[37:43] her in Washington. My wife is with her
[37:45] today. But I appreciate her confession.
[37:47] Uh I don't know if I've taught her that,
[37:49] but I know the word teaches us to keep
[37:51] that confession. Everything's going to
[37:52] be right. The Lord's going to bring us
[37:54] through. I said you hold that
[37:55] confession, God. We praise the Lord.
[37:57] Amen. Hope you didn't mind us singing
[37:59] this morning. That's what happens when
[38:01] there's no specials.
[38:03] That's what happens is you stuck with us
[38:05] to sing it. So, that's what happens
[38:07] here. Praise.
[38:07] &gt;&gt; Well, happy new year to you all. God
[38:09] bless you. It's great to have you in the
[38:11] service and and just feel his presence
[38:13] and uh we're looking forward to what the
[38:15] Lord has in mind for us. I hope you are
[38:17] looking forward because he always goes
[38:19] above and beyond our expectations. He's
[38:22] a wonderful God. Amen. Can you stand
[38:24] today and let's read if you would in
[38:26] Psalms
[38:28] chapter 18 and we'll just read a verse
[38:31] of scripture together and come to the
[38:34] most important part of all of our lives
[38:36] is that we take time in the word of God
[38:39] to be able to get revelation from him to
[38:43] be able to live
[38:45] Psalms chapter 18 we'll read
[38:49] Psalms
[38:51] 18
[39:03] verse um
[39:06] 25. Psalms 18 verse 25. This is one of
[39:10] the scriptures here is what we had
[39:13] engraved in your gift that we gave you.
[39:15] I wanted this to kind of set a theme for
[39:17] the year and you'll find that verse
[39:19] here. We appreciate brother Henry doing
[39:21] those for us, carving those into the
[39:22] wood and also a candle. Sister Miriam
[39:24] doing the candles. But we took the one
[39:27] scripture from this area. Psalms 18 and
[39:30] verse 25 says, "With the merciful, thou
[39:33] wilt show thyself merciful.
[39:36] With an upright man, thou wil show
[39:38] thyself upright." So there's a response
[39:42] from the Lord. Um if someone uh offers
[39:45] something to to God then he responds
[39:49] back in verse 26. With the pure thou
[39:52] wilt show thyself pure and with the
[39:53] forward thou will show thyself forward.
[39:57] For thou wilt save the afflicted people
[40:01] but will bring down high looks.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; Thou will save the afflicted people but
[40:07] will bring down high looks. And the next
[40:09] verse is what we gave you in that gift.
[40:12] For thou the Lord will light my candle.
[40:16] The Lord my God will enlighten my
[40:18] darkness. So if there is afflicted, if
[40:21] there's darkness, if there's anything,
[40:24] God, what will he do? He'll light our
[40:27] candle.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; God wants to light your candle.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And as we heard last Sunday, as we
[40:33] were uh just hearing our brother Steve
[40:35] last here Sunday really just preaching
[40:38] in such a wonderful way to show us that
[40:40] the mystery is Christ in you the hope of
[40:42] glory. That's
[40:43] &gt;&gt; right.
[40:43] &gt;&gt; So God wants to take this light and this
[40:46] word and light your candle. And whenever
[40:48] we move out of depending on a church,
[40:51] depending on I'm in the message,
[40:53] depending on I'm a certain a part of I'm
[40:55] part of a group. Whenever we start lean
[40:57] that way, we get away from the mystery
[41:00] that God wants to express himself in
[41:02] you. That's
[41:03] &gt;&gt; right.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; And he wants to light your candle. Can
[41:06] you say amen? And that light will shine,
[41:08] that revelation, that light, that
[41:10] understanding will shine into not only
[41:12] your own dark darkness, but the people
[41:15] that you come to and the darkness that
[41:17] you come into. It only takes one little
[41:19] candle. It's not how big the candle is.
[41:21] It's how powerful the light is.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; And this is a powerful light.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; Father, we pray you'll bless anoint us
[41:28] today. We thank you, Lord, for bringing
[41:30] us into this new year. We thank you for
[41:32] the blessings of the retreat this week
[41:34] and the fellowship with all the young
[41:36] people. And we pray, Father, as we set
[41:38] our directions, many may be sitting
[41:40] down, writing out their goals, and just
[41:42] praying, Lord, asking us to be better
[41:44] representatives of of your love, Lord,
[41:47] and your light of this hour. We pray,
[41:49] Father, as we do that, that you'd come
[41:51] with your Holy Spirit. That may it not
[41:53] just be mechanical or something we write
[41:55] down, but let it be by revelation. Let
[41:57] it be something from the inside out,
[41:59] Lord, that would be able to change us
[42:01] and also to change others. Help us and
[42:04] give us strength in each thing, Lord.
[42:06] And as the song said, we're not giving
[42:07] up, Father, because you've put something
[42:10] within us that will rise above every
[42:12] situation. We commit the situations and
[42:15] we commit our trials. We commit, Lord,
[42:17] the new year to you. We ask it in Jesus
[42:20] name. Amen.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated.
[42:27] The recent service we had a couple weeks
[42:29] ago in talking about the Christmas
[42:31] message was talking about light and
[42:34] darkness. And um we learned that Jesus
[42:40] uh manifested
[42:42] is to bring light to any darkness in any
[42:46] age in any time. Uh when you have Jesus
[42:50] manifested, the person of Christ
[42:52] manifested, he is there in order to
[42:56] shine light in the darkness that's
[42:58] already there.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; That's the manifestation of Jesus
[43:01] Christ. Uh and whatever interpretation
[43:04] we have of him, even if it's a
[43:06] historical Jesus that you've been
[43:08] presented with, uh we don't want a
[43:11] historical Jesus. We want a a Jesus that
[43:14] when he manifests his word, it manifests
[43:16] light and it brings darkness within us
[43:19] or darkness to this world. If darkness
[43:22] is still there, if darkness remains,
[43:25] then the light of this word has not
[43:27] broke through yet. I would say that to
[43:29] you kindly. But if if darkness is still
[43:32] in your life, that shows that Jesus has
[43:35] not manifested himself for you in the
[43:38] way that he could. Amen.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; And uh because he is light, the word is
[43:43] light and he is he wants to manifest
[43:45] himself that way to drive away any dark
[43:49] any darkness that's there. If there was
[43:51] a a direction that I could give the
[43:53] church for this coming year, uh I would
[43:56] just point us in this direction that it
[43:58] would be the evening light that God has
[44:01] sent us. that from the evening message
[44:03] and the evening messenger of Christ. It
[44:06] is what he has provided in order to
[44:08] enlighten uh your darkness first and
[44:11] then it's not just I don't want to stay
[44:13] there because as the scripture says
[44:15] he'll light my candle and he'll drive
[44:17] away my darkness but then it's not just
[44:20] to drive away our darkness within us but
[44:22] it is a light that is to be expressed to
[44:25] drive away the darkness around you. Now,
[44:27] we was telling the young people that uh
[44:29] in one of the devotions this week that
[44:31] that you will go into schools and you
[44:34] will go into a job and you will go into
[44:36] areas that I will never get into. The
[44:38] rest of the people won't get into. And
[44:40] Jesus wants to come into that area. And
[44:42] guess who he's doing it through? He's
[44:43] bringing light
[44:45] &gt;&gt; to that job, to that place. Light would
[44:48] never get there unless you were there.
[44:50] And you know, people think, "I'm there
[44:52] for a job. I'm there for a promotion. I
[44:54] can't wait for a promotion. I'm there
[44:56] for a paycheck. You're not believers are
[44:58] never there for just a paycheck. We are
[45:00] to be the light of the world. Light my
[45:02] candle so that where I walk into, no one
[45:05] else can get there except you.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; And so we cannot be carnal-minded that
[45:09] we're just there for a job or just there
[45:11] to make friends. But we are there to
[45:14] carry because we are carriers of this
[45:17] light of the last days. This evening
[45:20] light is not somewhere out here and not
[45:22] even in books and tapes. this evening
[45:24] light that he promised is to be in us
[45:27] and shining brightly. Can you say amen?
[45:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So it is it is this
[45:32] light that's within us to that takes
[45:34] away our darkness first. And I might say
[45:36] this is that you should allow that light
[45:39] to drive your darkness away first. Cuz
[45:41] you can't be a proper witness if you
[45:43] still have some darkness within you. Say
[45:46] Lord let this revelation of the word for
[45:48] the last days, this evening light. Let
[45:50] it shine on all the areas of my life
[45:52] that I would be hiding.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; Christians can hide things sometimes.
[45:56] Christians can have things for years and
[45:58] they look good at church, but they still
[46:00] have some dark areas in their life. And
[46:02] so the first thing say, "Lord, let this
[46:04] revealed word of the last days, let it
[46:07] shine so deeply in me that it would
[46:09] drive away my darkness."
[46:12] But then when it does, then we we want
[46:14] to see the light have an effect on the
[46:16] darkness that's around us and around
[46:19] others that we're coming in contact
[46:21] with. And so we learn that to have light
[46:23] is to have understanding. Light is
[46:26] revelation. Light is understanding. And
[46:29] one of the understandings we have is the
[46:30] understanding of the times that we live
[46:32] in. This present darkness that we live
[46:35] in. Because darkness in every age is a
[46:38] little bit different. Sometimes it's way
[46:40] different than the other ages. Our
[46:42] darkness today is a different darkness
[46:44] than what they dealt with in the early
[46:46] age, in the early days of Christ, in the
[46:48] early days of the church. So our
[46:50] darkness is different than other times.
[46:54] And also our light and our revelation is
[46:57] different because our light, our evening
[46:59] light is meant to come up against the
[47:02] darkness of this evening and this
[47:04] evening time and this last days.
[47:06] Darkness changes. So we live in a
[47:08] different darkness. And so our light is
[47:11] to meet the darkness of our age.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; And so now we realize that that that we
[47:16] cannot affect the darkness around us for
[47:19] this age if we're living in the light of
[47:22] another age.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; WE CANNOT BE DEPENDING ON A HISTORICAL
[47:27] JESUS.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; We can't just look ABOUT JESUS OF
[47:30] NAZARETH 2,000 years ago that was on the
[47:32] shores of Galilee. I love to read about
[47:34] that. But today I know that I KNOW THE
[47:37] JESUS THAT WALKED THOSE SHORES of
[47:38] Galilee through the word. I know him for
[47:41] this day. AND YOU CANNOT USE AN
[47:43] HISTORICAL JESUS to shine light on this
[47:45] darkness for this day. IT HAS TO BE
[47:48] PRESENT TRUTH, PRESENT LIGHT that he's
[47:50] shining now that affects the darkness.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; That's why you say a lot you see a lot
[47:54] of people claiming Christianity, but
[47:56] they live dark lives. They're still in
[47:58] darkness because the power of the light
[48:00] of the hour has not come to them yet.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Hallelujah. So, how crucial
[48:07] is it then that we know the time that
[48:09] we're living in and understand the times
[48:11] we live in so that we can meet the
[48:13] challenge of the darkness that we're in
[48:16] now? How crucial is it that we know the
[48:19] time? There was a people in the Old
[48:20] Testament and they marked them. They
[48:22] said that they were men of
[48:24] understanding. They were men of
[48:26] understanding. We need to be a people of
[48:28] understanding. We need to understand to
[48:31] meet the challenge for this hour. And
[48:34] spiritual ignorance will get us into
[48:36] trouble.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; In this hour, spiritual ignorance, and I
[48:40] say that because all ignorance can get
[48:43] us into trouble, but especially
[48:45] spiritual ignorance. Brother Rap was
[48:47] talking a couple one of the sessions
[48:48] there at retreat and he was talking
[48:50] about this generation seeking answers to
[48:53] their questions and their identity. He
[48:55] was talking about identity. And so most
[48:57] of the generation is borrowing or taking
[49:00] their answers to their identity from the
[49:02] internet, from social media, from
[49:04] everybody else, from professors,
[49:06] wherever, whatever source because they
[49:09] haven't come to the true source to find
[49:11] their true identity. Every young person
[49:13] needs to go to the word of God to find
[49:15] their true identity. And what happens if
[49:17] you don't? You will be given another
[49:19] identity.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; You will be handed because we as human
[49:23] beings, we receive everybody else's word
[49:25] on it. So, you'll take your identity off
[49:27] of social media. You'll take your
[49:29] identity. The problem is, and I'm I'm
[49:31] quoting what uh he said, is that uh a a
[49:34] generation that takes their answers to
[49:37] this huge question, who am I? The
[49:39] question, who am I? And if you take the
[49:41] world's answers, it can only be
[49:44] destruction to your life. Now, I I don't
[49:46] mean to be a doubter, but I'm telling
[49:47] you the truth. IF YOU TAKE THEIR
[49:49] ANSWERS, it it looks good, but it'll
[49:52] LEAD TO DESTRUCTION. THAT'S why we have
[49:54] so much suicide related to social media
[49:57] now
[49:58] &gt;&gt; because they're hungry for identity. And
[50:02] so if you keep going that direction,
[50:04] destruction is down the road. Suicidal
[50:06] spirits and demons down THE ROAD BECAUSE
[50:08] GOD HAS NOT CALLED YOU TO LIVE SOME
[50:11] OTHER IDENTITY. Some from the world or
[50:14] some from HOLLYWOOD OR SOME FROM SOCIAL
[50:16] MEDIA. HE'S CALLED YOU TO FIND YOUR
[50:18] IDENTITY IN CHRIST. AMEN.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; And all those identities can lead to
[50:23] destruction. Can you say amen?
[50:25] &gt;&gt; So we are a generation seeking for that
[50:27] answer of who am I? And if we take the
[50:29] answers from the So now I want to go to
[50:31] some prophecies because a couple weeks
[50:33] ago we talked about Christ being born
[50:35] 2,000 years ago. But look at this light.
[50:37] Look at this prophecy bringing it up to
[50:39] our day now. Zechariah 14 and verse 6.
[50:42] This is the promise that we can believe
[50:44] for our time. And it shall come to pass
[50:46] in that day that the light shall not be
[50:49] clear nor dark, but it shall be one day
[50:52] which shall be known to the Lord, not
[50:55] day nor night, but it shall come to pass
[50:58] that at the evening time it shall be
[51:02] light.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Right?
[51:04] &gt;&gt; So I hope I don't have to explain that
[51:06] TOO MUCH. THAT'S A prophecy for our
[51:09] time. Remember I said we got to
[51:10] understand our times. So in
[51:12] understanding our time, it says that it
[51:15] shall be not light, not clear, nor
[51:18] completely dark. Uh the prophet called
[51:20] it a dismal day. We live spiritually in
[51:23] a dismmo day. So it's confusing if we're
[51:26] talking about understanding. It's
[51:27] confusing. It's dism. But we have a
[51:29] promise. In the evening time, it shall
[51:32] be light.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; He'll give us understanding. He'll give
[51:36] us eyes to see. And and so then another
[51:39] prophecy in Isaiah 60 and verse one.
[51:43] Another one for our day is arise, shine,
[51:45] for thy light is come. And the glory of
[51:48] the Lord has risen upon who? Upon thee.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; For behold, the darkness shall cover the
[51:54] earth and gross darkness the people. But
[51:57] the Lord shall arise upon thee, and the
[51:59] glory shall be seen upon thee, and the
[52:02] Gentiles shall come to thy light, and
[52:06] kings to the brightness of THY RISING.
[52:08] NOTICE HOW THE LIGHT, IT'S not something
[52:11] we're looking at out here, but it's thy
[52:13] light. They'll come to thy light. The
[52:15] the the the glory will arise upon thee.
[52:17] Can you say amen? That's why I can say
[52:20] the Lord can wants TO LIGHT YOUR CANDLE
[52:22] BECAUSE THE LIGHT IS NOT IN BOOKS AND
[52:24] TAPES AND ALL THESE OTHER THINGS. IT'S
[52:25] TO BE LIVING IN YOU AND SHINING IN YOU.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; And everything about the evening light
[52:31] at the end time is related to that
[52:33] light. WHERE IS IT? WHERE IS THIS
[52:35] EVENING LIGHT? WELL, WE KNOW IT CAME
[52:37] INITIALLY THROUGH THE WORD. BUT HOW DOES
[52:39] IT SHINE EVERY DAY? THAT UNDERSTANDING,
[52:42] THAT REVELATION, THAT LOVE, WHATEVER IT
[52:45] IS THAT GOD PROVIDED IN THE EVENING
[52:47] LIGHT, WHERE IS IT? IT HAS to be in his
[52:50] people.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; You can invite people to church. But if
[52:55] they don't come to church, you're you
[52:58] say, "Lord, light my candle."
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Right.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; With this light of the last days and
[53:03] this evening time. Praise the Lord. Are
[53:06] you with me this morning?
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Seems kind of quiet here this morning.
[53:10] Maybe too much pumpkin pie over the
[53:11] holidays. I don't know.
[53:15] Notice all of you know that Jesus said,
[53:16] "I'm the light of the world." How many
[53:18] would say, "Amen. Jesus said he was the
[53:19] light of the world."
[53:21] &gt;&gt; Everybody knows that. Everybody can say
[53:23] amen to that. But did you ever hear too
[53:25] many sermons on when he turned around
[53:26] before he left this earth? And he says,
[53:28] "Now ye are the light of the world."
[53:30] &gt;&gt; So everything that he was now is split
[53:33] into his body. And they're NOT GOING TO
[53:35] GET IT through his body. They're going
[53:37] to get it through you. ANYTHING OF GOD
[53:40] IN THE LAST DAYS WILL COME THROUGH HIS
[53:43] PEOPLE. THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET COULD SAY
[53:45] SHE IS THE FINAL VOICE TO THE FINAL AGE.
[53:48] WHO? THE PROPHET. NO, HE WAS USED
[53:51] INITIALLY. BUT YOU SEE, SHE'S THE FINAL
[53:53] VOICE
[53:54] &gt;&gt; TO THE FINAL AGE.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; SHE'S THE ONE SHINING THE LIGHT. WHERE
[53:58] IS IT? SHE'S CARRYING IT.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; She's speaking it. She's living it. Can
[54:03] you say amen?
[54:04] &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. SO, YE are the light of
[54:07] the world at the end time especially. He
[54:10] lights your candle. And that means his
[54:13] light is in you. Where is it? In you.
[54:16] Not in a church, not in a book, not even
[54:19] in our Bibles. It's in you. It's Christ
[54:22] in you. As we were, as I said her last
[54:24] Sunday, anything less than Christ in you
[54:27] is becoming denominational. I'm going to
[54:29] say it again. Anything less than the
[54:31] mystery of Christ being in you is
[54:33] becoming denominational.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Cuz we'll get a crutch to lean on. I'm
[54:38] in the message. A crutch to lean on I'm
[54:40] lean on my parents.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; A crutch to lean on. I'll get in because
[54:44] of this or I I I I'm in a part of the
[54:47] message group. BROTHER PAUL, QUIT
[54:49] PREACHING ON ME. I GO TO A MESSAGE
[54:50] CHURCH. ISN'T THAT ENOUGH? NO, IT'S NOT
[54:52] ENOUGH.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; IT BECOMES DENOMINATIONAL WHEN YOU
[54:56] DEPEND ON THAT. THIS MYSTERY COMES DOWN
[54:59] TO CHRIST IN YOU INTERPRETING IT EVERY
[55:02] DAY, LIVING IT OUT EVERY DAY.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING THAT HE SENT US. I THANK GOD
[55:06] FOR IT. BUT I'M WAITING uh uh my LIFE IN
[55:10] MY LIFE IN YOUR LIFE. LET ME SEE it all
[55:12] manifested in your life.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; In my life. Praise the Lord. It's Christ
[55:17] in you. It's your candle that he wants
[55:20] to light. Why? You will carry it into
[55:23] places that he can't get to in his own
[55:26] body and you I can't get to. You'll
[55:28] carry that light into areas and his
[55:31] light will get there through you. And he
[55:34] has confidence in what he puts in you.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; There was one uh Christian leader who
[55:39] said all the darkness in the world. Now,
[55:41] if you want to put that gift that we
[55:43] gave you back up, just one candle.
[55:45] You're just one candle. But this one
[55:48] writer said one he said all the darkness
[55:52] in the world cannot extinguish the light
[55:56] of a single candle.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; I got to thinking about that. How
[56:01] powerful
[56:03] &gt;&gt; is that light if it's been lit by God
[56:06] &gt;&gt; right
[56:07] &gt;&gt; that if you take it into a room of
[56:09] darkness there is no way that darkness
[56:12] within itself can knock that light out
[56:16] &gt;&gt; one single candle
[56:19] &gt;&gt; why because it's not you
[56:21] &gt;&gt; right
[56:21] &gt;&gt; if he lights it him
[56:24] &gt;&gt; and darkness will never ever be more
[56:27] powerful than the light
[56:30] &gt;&gt; unless Unless you let it,
[56:32] &gt;&gt; unless you don't let him light your
[56:33] candle. Unless you say, "I'm just going
[56:35] to live a life of religion. I'm just
[56:36] going to live a life. I'm in the
[56:38] message. I'm I'm fine." That something
[56:39] greater's GOT TO HAPPEN. HE HAS TO LIGHT
[56:42] YOUR CANDLE.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; I'M ONLY 14 YEARS OLD. IT DOESN'T
[56:45] MATTER. YOU SHOULD SAY, "LORD, FILL ME
[56:47] WITH THE HOLY GHOST. LIGHT MY CANDLE. I
[56:49] KNOW YOU LIT MY PARENTS. I KNOW I CAN
[56:52] TELL BROTHER PAUL'S HIS FIRE IS LIT. BUT
[56:54] LORD, LIGHT MY CANDLE THIS YEAR.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO FOR THE KINGDOM of
[56:58] God?"
[56:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; And that doesn't necessarily mean what
[57:02] you would do in the church and your your
[57:03] gifts and all that. It's what does he
[57:05] want me to do for his kingdom as he
[57:08] lights my lights my candle lights my
[57:10] life up. Can you say amen? So he said
[57:13] that the world darkness in the world
[57:15] cannot extinguish the the light of a
[57:17] single candle. If it goes out, if the
[57:20] light goes out, it won't be because of
[57:23] the darkness.
[57:26] You know, a candle, it won't go out
[57:28] because you're standing there in the
[57:29] darkness. The darkness won't do it. It w
[57:32] I If it goes out, it won't be because of
[57:34] the darkness. Light is always stronger
[57:36] than darkness. Other things can stop it,
[57:39] but not darkness. Isn't that a
[57:41] revelation? Remember that
[57:42] &gt;&gt; other things can try to blow out the
[57:45] light, but darkness can't affect a
[57:48] single candle.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; Because it's him. Light is always
[57:54] stronger. Other things can stop it if it
[57:56] is connected to the source. And you know
[57:58] the story about even in the Bible where
[58:01] there has to be oil in the lamp. There
[58:02] are components to a candle and there not
[58:05] many components but all those components
[58:06] have to be there for the candle to be
[58:08] lit and the candle to keep lighting. So
[58:10] it's it's not the darkness that affects
[58:12] it but all the co components have to be
[58:15] in place. And if there's oil in the lamp
[58:17] it will burn and it will continue to
[58:19] burn. Now if there's no oil in the lamp
[58:21] it won't continue to burn. So that
[58:22] wasn't the darkness is that you DIDN'T
[58:24] GET THE OIL.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; OIL IS the Holy Spirit.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; And it had to THE WICK HAS TO STAY
[58:32] LAYING IN THE HOLY SPIRIT ALL THE TIME
[58:34] TO SHOOT THAT THROUGH THE WAX THAT'S
[58:37] THERE. THE WAX the the wick uh all these
[58:40] are components of a a candle. I'm
[58:42] certainly not an expert, but the wax the
[58:44] fuel the wick wax is part of the fuel.
[58:47] And so all those components coming
[58:48] together, the wax has a fuel in it. THE
[58:51] WICK DRAWS UP THAT fuel and brings it up
[58:54] to the flame and keeps it going. I would
[58:56] only SAY THIS, DARKNESS CAN'T KNOCK IT
[58:58] OUT, BUT DON'T MESS WITH THE COMPONENTS.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; YOU START MESSING WITH THE COMPONENTS,
[59:06] YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TROUBLE.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT A PROBLEM that darkness is the
[59:10] devil did this, the darkness, and they
[59:12] did that. NO. IF YOU'RE LIT BY GOD AND
[59:14] STAY LIT BY GOD, THAT DARKNESS WILL
[59:17] NEVER overcome you.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; YOU WILL SHINE IT in the worst darkness.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT. SO MAYBE YOU'VE
[59:26] MESSED with the components. You mess
[59:27] with the wax or the fuel, the wax has a
[59:30] fuel in it. The wick draws it up to the
[59:32] flame. Don't mess with the components.
[59:34] Keep your vessel filled with the Holy
[59:37] Ghost. Keep your wick or your L trimmed.
[59:40] And that to me means sanctification. WE
[59:43] WE CONSTANTLY SANCTIFY our lives AND
[59:46] TRIM THAT WICK. CAN YOU SAY, "MAN,
[59:48] Sister Miam even gave us a little stick
[59:50] to trim the the the wick because we have
[59:52] to keep that trim." That's
[59:53] sanctification.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; Don't laugh at me. I'm using all the
[59:56] wrong terms. I'm sorry. I'm sure I am.
[59:58] But get my point? Amen.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; I'm not a candle expert here,
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; but you know, uh, you you you got to
[1:00:07] keep your vessel filled with the Holy
[1:00:09] Ghost and you got to keep your wick
[1:00:11] trimmed in sanctification. That's a life
[1:00:14] of sanctification. Sanctification isn't
[1:00:16] when you just first come to the Lord.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; It's a lifestyle.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; And staying on fire for God is a
[1:00:24] lifestyle. It's it's something that
[1:00:25] should continue on. But you can't do
[1:00:27] that unless you would keep your lamps
[1:00:30] trimmed and glowing and left keep your
[1:00:32] life sanctified. Something's going to be
[1:00:35] affected if you start not living a
[1:00:37] sanctified life. Well, I've been serving
[1:00:38] the Lord 20 years and then you turn to
[1:00:40] something dark secret thing. You start
[1:00:42] doing that, you're going to affect the
[1:00:44] components of the light burning.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; You did it. The darkness didn't do it.
[1:00:49] You did it.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; You mess with the components. And so
[1:00:53] Jesus said in the evening, now he gives
[1:00:56] a parable of our time. EVERY TIME I KEEP
[1:00:58] REFERRING to the evening, the in the in
[1:01:01] the evening time there shall be light. I
[1:01:03] want to keep referring because you have
[1:01:04] to understand our time, our light and
[1:01:06] our time. And we have an evening light
[1:01:08] that's shining. And Jesus WHEN HE TALKED
[1:01:11] ABOUT BEFORE THE RAPTURE AND THE
[1:01:12] BRIDEGROOM COMES, THIS IS WHAT HE TALKED
[1:01:15] ABOUT. Keep your lamps trimmed. There
[1:01:16] was 10 virgins and the only thing they
[1:01:19] realized at the last minute, they were
[1:01:20] all trimming their lamps. So in other
[1:01:22] words, all of them were sanctifying
[1:01:24] their lives. They had a sincerity. I
[1:01:26] want to serve God. The problem was is
[1:01:29] ones realized they didn't have any oil.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; They didn't have the true Holy Ghost.
[1:01:33] And that's the fuel. You can't have your
[1:01:36] candle lit without the Holy Ghost.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, I should be getting more amens.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; I don't care how OLD YOU ARE. YOU CAN'T
[1:01:44] MAKE IT IN THIS DARKNESS without the
[1:01:46] true new birth experience of the Holy
[1:01:49] Ghost. And we say, "What do I do,
[1:01:50] brother Paul?" Well, the father's ready
[1:01:52] to grant that to you as soon as you ask
[1:01:54] sincerely from your heart. He's like our
[1:01:57] like the earthly fathers. He's nothing
[1:01:58] like our earthly fathers. But what won't
[1:02:00] our fathers if a child needs something
[1:02:02] do everything they can to get that? And
[1:02:04] Jesus said, "How much the more will he
[1:02:06] give the Holy Ghost TO THEM THAT ASK
[1:02:09] HIM?"
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO WANT IT.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; SAY, "WELL, I'm a pretty good
[1:02:14] Christian." AND NO, NO, I'M NOT TALKING
[1:02:15] ABOUT THAT. I'M SAYING, "HAVE YOU EVER
[1:02:16] SAID, "LORD, CHANGE ME. FILL ME WITH A
[1:02:20] TRUE GENUINE NEW BIRTH OF THE HOLY
[1:02:22] GHOST. Have you ever said that? Have you
[1:02:24] ever come to an altar in your life say
[1:02:25] this has got to start first? I need the
[1:02:28] OIL AND NOBODY'S MAKING THE RAPTURE
[1:02:30] WITHOUT THE OIL.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Cuz they ended up scared and they said,
[1:02:33] "Oh, give us some of your oil." No, they
[1:02:36] said, "No, I've got enough just enough
[1:02:37] Holy Ghost to make it through myself. Go
[1:02:39] to them that buy." And guess what? When
[1:02:41] they went to buy the oil, it was too
[1:02:43] late. The bridegroom came. That's a
[1:02:45] serious message the Lord has given us is
[1:02:47] that you better have your lamps shrimped
[1:02:49] and you better have oil in your lamp.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; He didn't say make more money before the
[1:02:54] rapture comes, bridegroom comes, you if
[1:02:57] you can do that, praise the Lord. He
[1:02:59] didn't say give more in the plate and if
[1:03:00] you can do it, go ahead and give it. We
[1:03:01] We need it here. We got a roof coming up
[1:03:03] and different things. But he didn't say
[1:03:05] that. What we need to do is trim our
[1:03:06] lamps and make sure that we have the
[1:03:09] oil.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; So he talked about uh they missed it.
[1:03:17] They missed the oil when he came and
[1:03:19] they were still trying to get the oil
[1:03:21] when he came. Many people will do the
[1:03:23] works of sanjification. It's great and I
[1:03:25] appreciate it. But with no oil does no
[1:03:27] good. You must be born again. Have you
[1:03:30] received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:03:32] believed?
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, I believe. I I'm a a good person.
[1:03:37] No, no. I'm Have you received the Holy
[1:03:39] Ghost since you believed?
[1:03:43] That's right.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; But he's got confidence
[1:03:48] in the fire that he lights
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; and no darkness can stop it. Can you say
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; amen?
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:57] And uh even Satan if he blows it out and
[1:04:01] you let him blow it out or you blow it
[1:04:03] out yourself because a light can be
[1:04:06] blown out except for these new candles
[1:04:09] that came about 20 30 years ago. And I
[1:04:13] love those candles because it plays such
[1:04:14] a trick because when everybody thinks
[1:04:16] the candle is out, you know, you got
[1:04:20] whatever you got now. They don't even
[1:04:22] have they don't even sell enough candles
[1:04:23] now for my birthday cake. But when you
[1:04:26] have 10 or 15,
[1:04:29] you ever been tricked that somebody
[1:04:30] slipped in the candles and you're going
[1:04:33] and everybody's excited and you go,
[1:04:38] you ever watch little kids do that? It's
[1:04:39] a lot of fun.
[1:04:41] And they do it and they get all the
[1:04:43] candles and everybody goes, "Yeah, woo!
[1:04:45] You did it. You did it." And they're
[1:04:46] sitting there going, "I'M SO PROUD of
[1:04:48] myself. I was so proud of myself." And
[1:04:50] then all of a sudden
[1:04:54] all the candles begin to light again
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; and they keep blowing on them and they
[1:04:58] won't go out. I think it's a modern, you
[1:05:01] know, the last 23 years a modern thing.
[1:05:02] I think it's cool, but I think it speaks
[1:05:04] of the light.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; That the Lord would put in somebody.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Satan may try to blow it out.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; You may blow it out. But if it's his
[1:05:14] light, it's going to come back on again.
[1:05:17] If it's the true thing, it's going to
[1:05:19] come back on.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE LIGHT OF GOD. IF
[1:05:24] IT'S THE TRUE LIGHT OF GOD, THEN YOU
[1:05:26] DARKNESS DOESN'T DO ANYTHING TO IT. IF
[1:05:28] IT GETS BLOWN OUT FOR A WHILE, THEN GOD,
[1:05:30] IF IT'S HIS LIGHT, HE LIGHTS THAT BACK
[1:05:32] UP AGAIN. IT COMES BACK AGAIN.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you today, if Satan's blown
[1:05:38] your candle out, you just wait a minute
[1:05:40] because you just say, "Lord, is this is
[1:05:42] THIS TRUE?" JUST WATCH THE LORD COME IN
[1:05:45] AND THAT THING light up again.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; It might you might need that to happen.
[1:05:49] HOW MANY RAISE YOUR HAND SAY? I NEED HIM
[1:05:50] TO DO THAT IN MY LIFE. I NEED HIM TO
[1:05:52] LIGHT MY CANDLE. WELL, IT'S ALREADY LIT.
[1:05:54] IT'S JUST SOMETHING BLEW IT OUT.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; But we need these candles shining bright
[1:06:00] in the darkness we live in.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; We don't need compromisers. We don't
[1:06:04] need people that's just religion. We
[1:06:06] don't need people to put religion on the
[1:06:08] outside. WE NEED THE true light of the
[1:06:11] last days, THE EVENING LIGHT, LIGHTING
[1:06:14] OUR INDIVIDUAL CANDLE,
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; AND TO KEEP IT bright and shining.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; This may be simple to you this morning,
[1:06:21] but listen, this is what the Lord has
[1:06:23] given us. HE'S GIVEN US LIGHT IN the
[1:06:25] last days.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; IN THE EVENING TIME, IT SHALL BE LIGHT.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YEAH.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; So now, and you know, Satan can be so
[1:06:33] proud when he blows it out, but even
[1:06:35] he's surprised.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; You know, that whole birthday party all
[1:06:39] there, and everybody's surprised it all
[1:06:40] comes back on. Satan is surprised when
[1:06:43] your flame comes back on so quickly.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; He doesn't like it. I thought I blew
[1:06:49] that out. It was over. No, this is a
[1:06:51] whole new lighting in the end time. This
[1:06:54] is a whole new candle, Satan.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; That's right. You're dealing with a
[1:06:58] light that's shining so bright.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; You're dealing with something that you
[1:07:04] think you can blow out,
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; but you can't if it's the true light of
[1:07:08] God.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; I really do believe that keeping our
[1:07:13] lamps trimmed and our vessel full is
[1:07:16] important. Would you agree with me?
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; I believe there needs to be a stability.
[1:07:21] And you hold on to that word because
[1:07:22] we're going to get to it in a minute
[1:07:23] here. A stability and a consistency. a
[1:07:25] stability, staying in the word and
[1:07:27] resting in that word continually every
[1:07:29] day. I believe stability in the word and
[1:07:32] resting in it to me is the real revival
[1:07:35] today.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; You know, Paul said, "Having done all to
[1:07:39] stand, stand therefore."
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; You know, there's a glory, there's a
[1:07:43] there's a power, there's a strength
[1:07:44] today in just standing.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Everybody's falling,
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; but it's a miracle when somebody just
[1:07:52] stands through all of this. Right.
[1:07:54] Right.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Having done all to stand, stand
[1:07:56] therefore. You put the armor of God on.
[1:07:59] BUT LISTEN, JUST STANDING in the midst
[1:08:01] of winds and storms and everything. Just
[1:08:04] the consistent stability. You know what?
[1:08:06] I'D LIKE TO SEE MORE OF STABILITY IN
[1:08:08] PEOPLE'S LIVES. STABILITY IN SERVING THE
[1:08:10] LORD. NOT THEY'RE UP AND DOWN AND ONE
[1:08:12] DAY THEY FEEL THEY'RE SAVED, ONE DAY
[1:08:13] THEY'RE NOT. THEY'RE OUT OF CHURCH FOR 6
[1:08:15] MONTHS, THEN THEY COME BACK AND THEY'RE
[1:08:16] SUPER SPIRITUAL TO EVERYBODY. LORD, LET
[1:08:18] US SEE SOME CONSISTENCY. LET US SEE SOME
[1:08:21] FAITHFULNESS. LET US SEE THE LIGHT
[1:08:23] SHINING EVERY DAY WHETHER YOU'RE AT
[1:08:25] CHURCH OR NOT. LET US SEE PEOPLE THAT
[1:08:27] ARE CONSISTENT TO COME TO THE HOUSE OF
[1:08:29] GOD.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; I've seen enough instability in the
[1:08:33] world. I don't need to see that in
[1:08:34] church people. WE NEED TO BE STABLE IN
[1:08:37] THE WORD. And can you say amen? Rest,
[1:08:39] peaceful, STANDING IN THE WORD. THE
[1:08:41] MIRACLE TODAY IS NOT SOMETHING SUPER
[1:08:44] SPIRITUAL.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; The miracle is the bride will still be
[1:08:48] standing.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Somebody ought to say, "Praise the
[1:08:51] Lord." WE LOOK FOR MIRACLES. AND GOD
[1:08:53] DOES MIRACLES. HE'S DOING THEM THIS
[1:08:54] WEEK. BUT LISTEN, THE REAL MIRACLE FOR
[1:08:56] THE BRIDE IS SHE'S THE ONE THAT'S LESS
[1:08:58] STANDING AFTER ALL OF THIS.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; EVERYBODY ELSE FELL,
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; BUT SHE'S just s standing. And it's his
[1:09:05] grace that she's still standing.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; May you be encouraged this morning that
[1:09:11] the miracle is not just an outward
[1:09:13] manifestation of emotion every year at
[1:09:16] camp.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; But let me see some stability in your
[1:09:20] life. Let me see that fire burning every
[1:09:23] day. When you're not around camp, when
[1:09:25] you're not around all the young people
[1:09:27] to encourage you, when you're by
[1:09:28] yourself, when you're alone by yourself
[1:09:30] in your room, is the candle shining
[1:09:33] there by yourself?
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Is there consistency? Is there
[1:09:37] stability?
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; I'll get to that word again in a minute.
[1:09:40] I think there's a steady burning of a
[1:09:42] candle, and that's better than some
[1:09:43] bright light that fizzles out after
[1:09:45] every camp
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; looking for consistency and
[1:09:49] faithfulness. So now I want to take this
[1:09:51] a bit deeper if you'd open your Bibles
[1:09:53] to Genesis 18. Uh some wonderful things
[1:09:56] here that the Lord showed us last night.
[1:09:58] Genesis 18. You remember we talked about
[1:10:00] Sarah and she took a long time and she
[1:10:03] coming to the promise of God. Abraham
[1:10:05] came to it but she was kind of slow and
[1:10:07] coming to it and then we realized Sarah
[1:10:10] finally caught it. She caught the the
[1:10:12] same faith of and seeing the same thing
[1:10:14] as Abraham. So that was wonderful. So I
[1:10:16] said last night I felt led to what's the
[1:10:18] next thing after Sarah catches that and
[1:10:21] after this this visitation with Elohim,
[1:10:24] these three angels, two angels that were
[1:10:26] going to go down to Sodom and one angel
[1:10:29] Abraham's calling Lord. Now he's in
[1:10:31] flesh. He's eating with Abraham. He's
[1:10:33] sitting down there eating with him and
[1:10:35] Abraham's calling him Lord. One of those
[1:10:38] was Lord. He didn't call three of them
[1:10:40] Lord.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; It was not a trinity. There was one. The
[1:10:44] other two were angels, but one of them
[1:10:46] was Lord. And he's meeting our father
[1:10:48] Abraham. How many believe we're the
[1:10:49] children of Abraham?
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; So when we look at our father Abraham,
[1:10:53] he's having a special visitation of the
[1:10:56] son of man. And it's the Lord who is the
[1:10:59] son of man. And he's sitting there
[1:11:01] eating with him, reminding him, I'm
[1:11:03] going to give you your promise. Tell
[1:11:06] Sarah, I'm gonna give you your promise.
[1:11:08] It's all about his promise. But look
[1:11:09] what happens here now in this setting of
[1:11:12] the evening time. He was there in in the
[1:11:15] heat of the day at this meeting with
[1:11:17] him. But then as the evening goes on,
[1:11:19] then something else happens. And let's
[1:11:21] read it. Verse 16. And the men arose
[1:11:23] from then and looked towards Sodom and
[1:11:25] Abraham went with them to bring them on
[1:11:28] the way. So he kind of walks out of the
[1:11:30] way with them. And two of these angels
[1:11:32] are headed to Sodom. Does anybody know
[1:11:33] why they're headed to Sodom? because God
[1:11:35] has pronounced judgment and he's going
[1:11:36] to go down and check it out and
[1:11:38] judgment's going to come to Sodom
[1:11:40] because they had become sodomites. They
[1:11:42] had become in sin. They had become uh um
[1:11:46] filled with vile spirits without God.
[1:11:49] You turned to all kinds of things,
[1:11:51] homosexuals, lesbians, trans. You say,
[1:11:54] "You're saying that publicly?" Yes, I
[1:11:56] am. Because all you need to do is read
[1:11:58] your Bibles. When men get further away
[1:12:00] from God, that's the sin that comes in.
[1:12:02] It is a sin.
[1:12:04] It is an abomination to God.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; You say, "What about the people?" Well,
[1:12:08] I'll love the person, but God is not
[1:12:11] going to love you and let you stay the
[1:12:12] way you are. He's going to love you out
[1:12:14] of that spirit.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; It's an abomination to God.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so that's what Sodom WAS. NOW,
[1:12:21] DOESN'T THAT SHOW US THE TIME WE'RE
[1:12:23] living in? How many could say as Jesus
[1:12:24] said, "As it was in days of Sodom, so
[1:12:26] shall it be in the coming again of the
[1:12:28] Son of Man." So now we have the setting
[1:12:30] for our day. It's a Sodomite condition.
[1:12:32] It's Sodom and Gomorrah. Even our laws,
[1:12:35] some of them have been passed to cater
[1:12:37] to the Sodommites.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; And they keep continue to pressure that
[1:12:41] way. We're living in the days Jesus said
[1:12:43] of the evening time. And that is we're
[1:12:45] living in the midst of Sodom.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Spiritually like Abraham, we're living
[1:12:49] on the mountain away from it. But
[1:12:51] remember, Lot went down there to try to
[1:12:53] help the people. And he's down there
[1:12:55] trying to work with them. And so, watch
[1:12:57] what happens. Now, listen to this.
[1:12:59] Abraham already has his promise. And
[1:13:02] that's a body change. His body's going
[1:13:03] to change. Sarah's body's going to
[1:13:05] change. And they're going to have a
[1:13:07] baby. And but watch the spirit
[1:13:12] of our father Abraham. And I'm asking
[1:13:14] you to check yourself and see if you
[1:13:16] have this
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; because this is what's next after the
[1:13:20] son of man visits us.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Seeing that Abraham, verse 17, the Lord
[1:13:25] said, "Shall I hide from Abraham this
[1:13:27] thing that I do?" Isn't that wonderful?
[1:13:30] The Lord says, "You know what? I'm going
[1:13:31] to do something, but I can't really hide
[1:13:34] it from my elect.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Amen, Lord.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you what I'm going to
[1:13:37] getting ready to go do.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; Seeing that Abraham shall surely become
[1:13:41] a great and mighty nation, and all the
[1:13:42] nations of the earth shall be blessed in
[1:13:44] him. For I know Abraham, that he will
[1:13:47] command his children and his household
[1:13:49] after him, and they shall keep the way
[1:13:52] of the Lord to do justice and judgment,
[1:13:54] that the Lord may bring upon Abraham
[1:13:56] that which he had spoken unto him. I
[1:13:57] want all the brothers and all the men
[1:13:59] and all the young men to keep that verse
[1:14:01] in front of you because this is what
[1:14:03] impressed God about Abraham. He had the
[1:14:06] promise, but one of the reasons God
[1:14:08] brought it to him is because I know him.
[1:14:11] I know him
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; and he will command his children and his
[1:14:15] household after him well in the things
[1:14:18] of the Lord. He'll direct and be the
[1:14:20] leader in that family to direct them to
[1:14:23] the things of God. I trust him to do
[1:14:26] that. in this in the middle of Sodom
[1:14:28] Gomorrah.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; We need men like that.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; We need young men not to get married
[1:14:33] until they have that strength in their
[1:14:35] life
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; that he's going to command his household
[1:14:38] well. And he is going to actually be
[1:14:40] having a multi-generational vision that
[1:14:42] what I do now is going to affect the
[1:14:44] future of my family,
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; my grandchildren.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; The decisions I make now. And and God
[1:14:49] said, "I know him. I know Abraham. So,
[1:14:51] I'm going to share my secrets with him."
[1:14:53] And the Lord said, "Because the cry of
[1:14:55] Sodom and Gomorra is great, and because
[1:14:56] their sin is very grievous, I will go
[1:14:59] down now and see whether they have done
[1:15:02] alltogether according to the cry of it
[1:15:04] which has come up unto me, and if not, I
[1:15:07] will know." And the men turned their
[1:15:08] faces from then, and went toward Sodom.
[1:15:12] But Abraham stood yet before the Lord.
[1:15:15] So two of them head that direction.
[1:15:17] Abraham stood before the Lord. And
[1:15:19] Abraham drew near and said, "So now
[1:15:24] Abraham has his promise,
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; His his body's going to change. He's
[1:15:31] going to have that baby. Him and Sarah,
[1:15:33] Jessica, he's got his promise of being
[1:15:35] in the rapture,
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; You think he's done?
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; You think that's all he wants?" No.
[1:15:42] He's stepping near the Lord and before
[1:15:44] he goes, he's saying, "Wilt thou also
[1:15:48] destroy the righteous with the wicked?"
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; That's right,
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Perventure. There are 50 righteous
[1:15:53] within the city. Wil also destroy and
[1:15:55] not spare the space, the place for 50
[1:15:58] righteous that are therein. Nobody is
[1:16:01] giving any hope for Sodom except
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; this light.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. of the evening time
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; shining and saying to the Lord, "No,
[1:16:13] there's no hope for Sodom. There's no
[1:16:15] hope for Lot, for his family down there
[1:16:18] except for the prayer
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; of Abraham."
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; My friends, I I read that last night. I
[1:16:24] stand corrected because you know what
[1:16:25] Abraham's asking the Lord for? Just like
[1:16:28] brother Steve brought it up last Sunday,
[1:16:30] we've been here the last few months is
[1:16:31] that even when the judgments have
[1:16:33] already been pronounced, somebody who
[1:16:36] would rise and ask for grace,
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; God will step in and do it.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Brother Steve said Jonah that day, all
[1:16:43] these days, there's a mystery in
[1:16:45] scripture that says when judgment has
[1:16:47] been pronounced and friends, America,
[1:16:49] the world, judgment has already been
[1:16:51] pronounced. She's headed for tribulation
[1:16:54] and there's nothing we can do to stop
[1:16:56] it. But but he's actually asking the
[1:16:58] Lord if you find 50 righteous.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; And he's not asking for the 50.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; He's asking if there's 50 there, are you
[1:17:06] sure you want to destroy the whole
[1:17:07] thing? He's getting the Lord to promise
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; to go against his judgment.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; WOW.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; WHAT KIND OF POWER IS IN THE light of a
[1:17:19] son and daughter of Abraham?
[1:17:22] BOY, HE MUST HAVE KNOWN HIS POSITION TO
[1:17:24] BE ASKING THE LORD THAT IF YOU FIND 50,
[1:17:27] I WANT YOU TO SPARE ALL OF THOSE
[1:17:30] SODOMITES.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm just going to be
[1:17:38] honest with you. I've not heard too many
[1:17:40] sermons about that in the message. And
[1:17:42] I'm not boasting. I'm doing I haven't
[1:17:44] preached too many.
[1:17:46] But we stop at our promise of the
[1:17:48] rapture.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; And the type does not show us stopping
[1:17:52] at our promise.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; It says we're reaching out and saying,
[1:17:57] "I'm concerned about destruction hitting
[1:17:59] these people."
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; What I've heard in our ranks is that
[1:18:05] sodomites, they had it coming to them.
[1:18:08] They deserve it. GOD'S BRINGING JUDGMENT
[1:18:10] ON THEM. THAT'S ALL TRUE. BUT THE SPIRIT
[1:18:13] OF ABRAHAM SAYS, "LORD,
[1:18:16] LORD,
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; IS THERE SOME WAY?
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; DON'T DESTROY THEM, LORD.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; WHY DO WE HAVE THIS THING IN OUR RATES
[1:18:24] THAT'S SO WILLING TO DITCH SOMEBODY
[1:18:26] ELSE? GIVE THEM UP. PUT THEM IN A
[1:18:28] CATEGORY. THEY'RE FINISHED. AND WE'RE
[1:18:30] GOING ON WITH THE WORD AND WE'RE IN OUR
[1:18:32] CONVENTION SHOUTING ABOUT THE WORD, BUT
[1:18:34] WE HAVE NO CARE OR HEART FOR SOMEBODY
[1:18:36] WHO'S A SODOMITE. I SAY, LORD, HELP US
[1:18:39] TO HAVE ENOUGH LIGHT AND GRACE THAT WE
[1:18:41] HAVE GRACE FOR A SODOMITE.
[1:18:44] GRACE FOR THE CONDITIONS OF DARKNESS,
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; LIGHT TO SHINE THERE.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; PAUL, I can't even talk to that guy, his
[1:18:51] feminine feminine ways. Well, listen,
[1:18:53] you need something deeper in your life
[1:18:55] cuz you HAVE TO LOOK PAST THE SIN
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; CUZ YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO SAY SOMETHING
[1:19:00] THAT THAT WOULD draw him out of that.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; He needs the Lord.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; He needs this light.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; It's up to him if he receives it, but
[1:19:09] it's up to you to have that kind of
[1:19:11] Abraham heart.
[1:19:13] Oh God, I'm standing in this position
[1:19:15] right now. If you could just spare this
[1:19:17] person from this demon power that he's
[1:19:19] under. It's not him, it's the demon.
[1:19:21] GOD, CAN YOU USE ME TO SAY SOMETHING? IF
[1:19:24] THERE'S 50, will you spare them?
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; WE NEED TO GROW, FRIENDS,
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; IN THE MESSAGE. WE'RE TOO CONCERNED
[1:19:33] ABOUT WHAT OTHER CHURCHES ARE THINKING.
[1:19:35] WE'RE TOO CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT EVERYBODY
[1:19:37] ELSE IS WEARING. AND WE'RE WE'RE STUCK.
[1:19:39] CAN YOU SAY AMEN?
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; AND YOU KNOW WHAT? WERE SELFFOCUSED.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; GOD DOES NOT WANT US TO BE SELFFOCUSED.
[1:19:47] OUR FATHER ABRAHAM, HE COULD HAVE BEEN
[1:19:49] SELFFOCUSED, BUT HE HAD A HEART FOR WHAT
[1:19:51] WAS GOING ON out there.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, I wish the Lord give me
[1:19:58] words to say it this morning. He kept
[1:19:59] working on them. Verse 24, preventure
[1:20:01] there be 50 righteous within the city.
[1:20:03] Wil thou also destroyed uh not spare the
[1:20:06] place for the 50 righteous that are
[1:20:07] therein that be that be far from thee to
[1:20:10] do after this manner to slay the
[1:20:13] righteous with the wicked and that the
[1:20:15] righteous should be as the wicked that
[1:20:17] be far from thee? Shall not the judge of
[1:20:20] all of all the earth do right?
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; You imagine he's talking to the Lord
[1:20:24] this way.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; You're you're the judge of the whole
[1:20:27] earth. Don't you want to do right in
[1:20:28] this? This seems a little bit injustice.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Wow. Amen.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; And the Lord said, "If I find in Sodom
[1:20:35] 50 righteous within the city, then I
[1:20:37] will spare all of the place
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; for their sakes."
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'll do it. I'll spare all of
[1:20:44] Sodom and Gomorrah from the fire and
[1:20:47] brimstone
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; for you
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; because you're asking."
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; What if we're the only hope?
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; For those that are out there,
[1:21:00] Verse
[1:21:04] 27. And Abraham answered and said,
[1:21:05] "Behold now, I have taken upon me to
[1:21:07] speak unto the Lord, which am but dust
[1:21:10] and ashes." So, he's going to go
[1:21:11] further. And as he goes further, he gets
[1:21:14] a little bit embarrassed. And he keeps
[1:21:15] asking, but he said, "I'm just dust and
[1:21:17] ashes. Pre-adventure, there shall lack
[1:21:20] five of the 50 righteous. Wilt thou
[1:21:22] destroy all the city for lack of five?"
[1:21:23] And he said, "If I find there 40 and
[1:21:25] five, I will not destroy it." And he
[1:21:27] spake unto him again and said, "Per
[1:21:28] adventure, there shall be 40 found
[1:21:30] there." And he said, 'I will do it for
[1:21:31] 40's sake. And he said unto him, "Oh,
[1:21:33] let not the Lord be angry with me, and I
[1:21:36] will speak. Prayer adventure, there
[1:21:37] shall be 30 found there." And he said,
[1:21:39] "I will not do it if I find 30."
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Behold now,
[1:21:45] I'm sure that we don't catch the full
[1:21:47] depth of what's being happening here,
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; but this is our father
[1:21:52] Abraham
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; living a type
[1:21:57] of the bride of the last days.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; In a Sodom Gomorra comm uh condition and
[1:22:04] has already had uh a a visitation of the
[1:22:09] son of man. We stand in that position.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; This is right. This is us in the
[1:22:14] scripture.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; And the type says that Abraham's
[1:22:18] pleading
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; to hold back the judgment.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; The only one doing it.
[1:22:25] He said, "Oh Lord, be not angry with me
[1:22:28] and I speak, but this preventure 10
[1:22:30] shall be found there." And he said, So
[1:22:32] he drew him down to 10
[1:22:35] from 50 to 10.
[1:22:38] And I will not, he said, I will not
[1:22:41] destroy it for 10 sake. And the Lord
[1:22:43] went his way as soon as he had left
[1:22:44] communing with Abraham. And Abraham
[1:22:46] returned unto his place. He kept coming
[1:22:51] before the Lord.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. with his light that he already
[1:22:54] has.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; He's using his light.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; God has lit his candle with revelation.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; But what is he using it for now? Oh God,
[1:23:04] can somehow there be mercy for them out
[1:23:06] there?
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; I don't hear no us no more.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; I don't hear we're Abraham's royal seed
[1:23:12] and we've got it. I don't hear any of
[1:23:14] that.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; I hear his whole focus is to appeal to
[1:23:18] Elohim
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; that's visited him. Now that I've got
[1:23:22] you here, I'm pleading for my family.
[1:23:25] I'm pleading.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; I'm speaking on behalf of my family
[1:23:29] members. I'm speaking to you, Lord.
[1:23:32] Would you spare the whole thing if you
[1:23:34] find 10 righteous? And guess what? He
[1:23:36] didn't find 10.
[1:23:38] But the Bible says because he remembered
[1:23:42] Abraham,
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; he spared Lot.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Read the story.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. He comes to his two son-in-laws
[1:23:48] and his son-in-laws. They say, "We got
[1:23:50] to get out of here. We got to go."
[1:23:52] Because his daughters were married. He
[1:23:53] said to his son-in-laws, "Get your let's
[1:23:55] get out of here." And son-in-laws as if
[1:23:57] he mocked them. It was a joke to them.
[1:23:59] We're not going.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; His daughters came with him, but not his
[1:24:03] son-in-laws.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; It speaks of families being broke up
[1:24:08] sometimes.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[1:24:10] because they're not seeing the mercies
[1:24:12] of God to lay their lives at the altar
[1:24:15] to he say he's reaching out a hand of
[1:24:18] mercy to me.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; I wonder if those son-in-laws tried to
[1:24:22] influence their wives to stay.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; It's another sermon, but I'll tell you
[1:24:28] that's what was happening. Sodommites
[1:24:30] were trying to come in and take these
[1:24:31] angels even because they must have been
[1:24:33] they were in flesh and blood. Sodommites
[1:24:35] were trying to pervert Lot's own home.
[1:24:38] Remember, Lot was living there. He
[1:24:40] should have been living there, but he's
[1:24:41] living there. And the the the the sins
[1:24:42] of Sodom vexed his righteous soul daily.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; He wasn't doing anything about it, but
[1:24:47] he was there and he was vexed. So,
[1:24:49] because that little thing was there and
[1:24:51] because Abraham said it, he grabbed them
[1:24:53] and says, "Because of Abraham, grace is
[1:24:56] extended. Grab your daughters and your
[1:24:58] wife and head out of here and run
[1:24:59] towards the mountain
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; because of Abraham." Now, I got to move
[1:25:03] along here. Uh, but there's there's a
[1:25:06] quote that I want to get to and then
[1:25:07] I'll bring this to a close. I don't want
[1:25:09] you to have the impression that I'm uh a
[1:25:11] long-winded preacher.
[1:25:13] One of my New Year's resolutions.
[1:25:17] Don't laugh, Michael.
[1:25:20] Um,
[1:25:21] look at some things he says here.
[1:25:24] Now, we're going to Yeah. Now, we're
[1:25:26] going to speak about evening light just
[1:25:28] for a moment. The Bible predicts. You
[1:25:31] still with me? Amen.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; The Bible predicts that there will come
[1:25:34] a time right at the closing time that
[1:25:36] the sun will come out and there will be
[1:25:38] an evening light. We all know that,
[1:25:39] don't we? We're we who are familiar with
[1:25:41] our message today from the Lord Jesus,
[1:25:43] we believe that there will be an evening
[1:25:44] light. And this evening light, of
[1:25:46] course, the great light will come when
[1:25:49] Jesus himself will be manifested here on
[1:25:52] earth or up in the heavens taking away
[1:25:54] his bride and then the millennium will
[1:25:56] set in. I want you to notice the
[1:25:57] distinction he makes in the great light.
[1:26:00] The evening light is different than the
[1:26:02] great light because the great light is
[1:26:03] when we go in a rapture and go in a
[1:26:05] millennium.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; But then he said then the million was
[1:26:10] said but we've got one of the most
[1:26:11] dreadful times to go through that ever
[1:26:13] laid before human beings. Now it said
[1:26:15] the day itself the day between that time
[1:26:17] will be kind of like oh like a dismal a
[1:26:19] dark day could not be called day or
[1:26:20] night in between that. Now remember
[1:26:23] notice this is the time that the son of
[1:26:25] man will be revealed. The revealing of
[1:26:26] the son of man. Now, the Son of Man was
[1:26:29] actually revealed potentially just for a
[1:26:32] few moments there, just before Sodom was
[1:26:35] burned. That's what I just read to you.
[1:26:37] Just before Sodom was burned, and he did
[1:26:39] burn it, by the way. Now, that man was
[1:26:42] Elohim. That was God. And Jesus is God.
[1:26:44] And God was revealed potentially right
[1:26:46] there for a few moments to talk to
[1:26:48] Abraham in the investigation judgment
[1:26:51] just for a little bit. The son of man
[1:26:52] was revealed. The son of man, Elohim. Do
[1:26:54] you see it, church? The son of man,
[1:26:56] Elohim, was revealed just for a few
[1:26:58] minutes. For the next morning, she was
[1:27:01] burned before the sun could come up
[1:27:03] again. So there can't be no organization
[1:27:06] left. Neither can there be any further
[1:27:09] advancement that what's going on right
[1:27:11] now for shall burn before the day breaks
[1:27:14] again. The revival is over. Stop right
[1:27:16] there. Did you see what he just said?
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; There'll be no denomination officially.
[1:27:22] No organization. There's no time for
[1:27:24] another organization out of this
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; and there can be any there can't be any
[1:27:29] further advancement than this revealing
[1:27:30] of the son of man to us. So listen,
[1:27:33] we're there.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; We're right here. We've had the
[1:27:36] revealing of the son of man. We're still
[1:27:37] having it even this morning. The
[1:27:38] revealing of the son of man. So we're
[1:27:40] right where Abraham stood just the day
[1:27:43] before destruction hits Sodom and
[1:27:45] Gomorrah. Tribulation sets in. That's
[1:27:47] where you're at.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; That's where we're at.
[1:27:52] And so just for a little bit, the son of
[1:27:54] man was revealed
[1:27:56] uh coming down here. There ain't he says
[1:27:58] I want just to notice the revival is
[1:28:00] over across the nation.
[1:28:04] There ain't going to be no more
[1:28:05] revivals.
[1:28:07] Now why? How could brother? How could
[1:28:08] you say that?
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Because it's not in the type.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Before Sodom and Gomorra, it's not in
[1:28:14] THE TYPE. THAT'S WHY THE people don't
[1:28:16] know their Bibles in the types. They're
[1:28:18] out there saying there's going to BE A
[1:28:19] BREAK NATIONWIDE REVIVAL. WE'RE GOING TO
[1:28:21] HAVE A WORLDWIDE revival and even you
[1:28:23] have temporary little things happen
[1:28:25] which I rejoice in. Charlie Kirk dying
[1:28:27] is is is created this hunger for God in
[1:28:29] the young people and they're coming by
[1:28:31] droves to church now. I say praise God.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; I don't mock that. I say praise the
[1:28:37] Lord. BUT THE REVIVALS THIS nation has
[1:28:39] had. WE'RE NOT IN THE TIME TO HAVE a big
[1:28:41] national revival. That is over. Why?
[1:28:44] It's not scripturally supposed to happen
[1:28:46] that way. We're in the days of
[1:28:47] tribulation setting in.
[1:28:50] So know where you're at. DON'T PREACH
[1:28:51] SOMETHING THAT'S NOT IN THE SCRIPTURE.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; DON'T PROMOTE A NATIONWIDE REVIVAL WHEN
[1:28:56] WE KNOW that's over. It's not in the
[1:28:58] scripture for that. We've had the
[1:29:00] visitation of the son of man and now we
[1:29:02] are standing here just before judgment.
[1:29:04] And so for a little bit the son of man
[1:29:06] was revealed. Oh, I always lose my place
[1:29:08] here. Oh yeah. So there's no more. He
[1:29:11] says um there'll be no organization
[1:29:14] left. Neither can there be any further
[1:29:15] advancement than what's going on right
[1:29:17] now. offer shall burn before the day
[1:29:18] breaks. The revival is over across the
[1:29:20] nation. There ain't going to be no more
[1:29:21] revivals, big sweeping revivals. This
[1:29:23] nation never received it. You might have
[1:29:25] an intellectual gathering, but I mean a
[1:29:27] real I mean a spiritual revival. We've
[1:29:30] seen all of it. I hope you're catching
[1:29:32] it. Listen now. I want you listen close
[1:29:33] where he goes. I'm saying it in such a
[1:29:35] way that I hope you get it. See, it's
[1:29:37] over. A fine minister said a while ago
[1:29:39] said, "Brother Brandham, IF I COULD JUST
[1:29:41] HAVE THE JOY OF THE LORD IN MY HEART."
[1:29:42] And what he's probably referring to is
[1:29:44] he come from Pentecost and he wanted
[1:29:46] that type of joy again. And he's saying,
[1:29:48] "Oh, IF I COULD JUST HAVE THE JOY IN MY
[1:29:50] HEART." I SAID, "SON, the revival is
[1:29:52] over."
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Wow. That seems just like it's
[1:29:58] discouraging. But no, what it is, it's
[1:30:00] recognizing the time you're in.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; I believe there's a revival, but I
[1:30:04] believe it's God lighting your candle.
[1:30:07] Sure.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; I don't believe in a church revival. I
[1:30:10] don't need a message revival. I believe
[1:30:12] individuals are having a revival in
[1:30:14] their hearts.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; I do believe in that. But when this man
[1:30:17] is asking for the joy of the Lord for a
[1:30:19] national revival, he said, "It is over.
[1:30:22] That is over." And so all of us would
[1:30:24] say, "How is he going to answer next?"
[1:30:27] If he says, "Son, the revival is over."
[1:30:29] Here's what he says next. Now, now
[1:30:34] the stabilizers have been put on the
[1:30:37] ship.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; You know what he just did? He just told
[1:30:41] us the time we'll enter into now. Don't
[1:30:43] look for a national revival. Don't look
[1:30:45] for big meetings. The stabilizers have
[1:30:49] been put in the ship. Now, I when I read
[1:30:51] that, I'm thinking in the Philippines,
[1:30:53] and they got a picture there. I'm
[1:30:54] thinking of those things that in the
[1:30:55] Philippines. It's like that's the
[1:30:57] stabilizers for a little canoe. But I
[1:30:59] didn't realize how big a stabilizer had
[1:31:01] in the cruise ship. A few years ago, my
[1:31:03] wife and I were on one for just two or
[1:31:05] three days and it was the worst
[1:31:06] experience.
[1:31:09] My wife said, "I'll never go on one
[1:31:10] again." Uh, and so we went through a
[1:31:13] storm and that's why it got got a little
[1:31:15] rocky there. Um, but I can guarantee you
[1:31:18] now that I know this, those things come
[1:31:19] out of the side of a big ship. If you
[1:31:21] didn't have those stabilizers, and I
[1:31:22] didn't realize they had such big ones,
[1:31:24] well, we'd have never made it through
[1:31:25] that storm. We would have been finished.
[1:31:27] That's right.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; It it it went through the storm because
[1:31:31] the stabilizers were there.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; And then I got my wife to go on another
[1:31:38] one last year. We went on a Southern
[1:31:39] Gospel cruise that was a lot of fun. It
[1:31:40] wasn't it wasn't, you know, we didn't
[1:31:42] die. We're still here. And uh it it was
[1:31:44] fine. But you know, you realize that it
[1:31:47] was a smooth. It still rocked just a
[1:31:49] little bit. But I'm telling you now that
[1:31:51] I know this. I know what's stabilizing
[1:31:53] the ship. And that's a big ship to
[1:31:54] stabilize. That's a big deal. But there
[1:31:57] are big storms we're facing today. And
[1:32:00] brother Brandham says going back to the
[1:32:01] quote, "The stabilizers have already
[1:32:04] been put in the ship." I hope you're
[1:32:07] catching it. I'm saying now the stab put
[1:32:09] in the ship. Next one.
[1:32:11] Great fearful waves are out there. What
[1:32:14] year are we in? 1965.
[1:32:16] Great fearful waves are out there before
[1:32:18] us. But we know just beyond that wave
[1:32:21] yonder, we're nearing the shore. You
[1:32:23] see, we're nearing the shore. Just stay
[1:32:26] stabled. Just stay in the word. Stay
[1:32:30] with God. No matter how you feel, what
[1:32:34] anything else, stay right with the word.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; DON'T TRY TO WORK UP SOMETHING HIGHLY
[1:32:41] EMOTIONAL. IF YOU GET EMOTIONAL, I
[1:32:43] WOULDN'T MIND IF YOU DID THIS MORNING.
[1:32:44] IT'S FINE. BUT WE'RE NOT LIVING ON
[1:32:46] EMOTIONS NOW. WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR A
[1:32:48] NATIONAL REVIVAL. WE'RE NOT TRYING TO
[1:32:50] WORK UP WITH THE STABILIZERS OF THE WORD
[1:32:52] HAVE BEEN PUT in the ship. And we're
[1:32:55] going to go through some difficult
[1:32:56] times.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to people in my own
[1:32:59] congregation that went through times in
[1:33:00] the last two years that you would have
[1:33:03] never dreamed they'd have never dreamed
[1:33:05] it up they'd be GOING THROUGH THIS
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; RIGHT NOW even going through it.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; What hope do I have my counseling? Well,
[1:33:11] I do my best, but you know what? You
[1:33:13] know the hope the stabilizers have been
[1:33:15] put in the ship
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; and we're going to crest every one of
[1:33:18] those waves. Can you say amen? We're
[1:33:19] nearing the shore. Just just stay
[1:33:21] stable. Stay in the word. This is the
[1:33:23] miracle. It's not that we have big
[1:33:25] meetings with a lot of things. No, the
[1:33:27] the miracle, the revival is somebody
[1:33:30] stays stable in the word.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; That just seems so intellectual. It's
[1:33:34] not intellectual.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; It's the power of God to that keeps us
[1:33:38] that sustains us.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; That when that little devil whispers
[1:33:42] giving up, something else rises in the
[1:33:44] FIRE AND SAYS, "I'M NOT GIVING UP.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE, SATAN. I'M NOT
[1:33:49] GOING ANYWHERE." SOMETHING RISES UP. CAN
[1:33:51] I GET AN AMEN THIS MORNING? WHEN WE FEEL
[1:33:53] LIKE GIVING UP, AND THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.
[1:33:55] WE'RE NOT GOING ON FEELINGS NOW. THE
[1:33:57] STABILIZERS HAVE BEEN PUT IN THE SHIP.
[1:33:59] The message, the word is there. I hope I
[1:34:02] can get into it in a few weeks that that
[1:34:04] word is our stability. And if you're not
[1:34:06] in that word, you're missing the
[1:34:08] STABILITY IN YOUR LIFE IN THIS DARKNESS.
[1:34:10] AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'LL BECOME? Jesus
[1:34:12] said the if the blind lead the blind, IF
[1:34:15] YOU'RE BLIND to the understanding that's
[1:34:16] in this message, you'll follow the blind
[1:34:18] that's not in it either. That's right.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; And if the blind lead the blind,
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; they'll fall in a ditch.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; We have the message for light, for
[1:34:26] understanding.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; He said great fearful waves are out
[1:34:29] there before us. Stay with the word. The
[1:34:31] next one or is that? Let's let it stay
[1:34:34] stable. When you see all these great big
[1:34:36] old clouds around us and storms coming
[1:34:39] and atomic bombs and everything else
[1:34:41] they're talking about, but our
[1:34:43] stabilizer is right straight in the
[1:34:45] word. God said it would be here. will
[1:34:48] crest every one of them waves. Yeah,
[1:34:51] we'll go right over the top of them.
[1:34:53] Yes, indeed. They can't sink us. They
[1:34:57] can't drown us.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Can you confess it this morning? I don't
[1:35:02] care how big the wave is, it ain't going
[1:35:04] to sink us.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Next one. You can put us in the grave
[1:35:08] and we'll come out again.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; That's just all there is to it. There
[1:35:15] ain't no way in the world to keep it
[1:35:17] down there. We'll crest every one of
[1:35:19] them because our great chief captain is
[1:35:21] calling at the other side. We're
[1:35:23] anchored in Jesus. The storms of life
[1:35:25] I'll brave. I've anchored in Jesus. I
[1:35:27] fear no wind or wave. Whatever it might
[1:35:29] be, let it come. And go skipping down in
[1:35:32] the quote now. What may, what will,
[1:35:34] doesn't make any difference. We're
[1:35:35] anchored right there in Jesus. If I
[1:35:37] live, I live to the glory of God. If I
[1:35:40] die, then I could die to the glory of
[1:35:42] God. I just want to just it's to the
[1:35:45] glory of God is what I want to do. When
[1:35:47] that's all over, I don't want to stay
[1:35:50] any longer. I want to go to where to my
[1:35:53] reward that he brought bought for me.
[1:35:55] Not what I earned, but what he bought
[1:35:57] for me. What he gave to me by his
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, church of the living God, get to
[1:36:04] your feet. Believe him with all your
[1:36:06] hearts.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; All that's in you. Hold to that w little
[1:36:10] wheel in the middle of the wheel. So
[1:36:11] friends, I'm going to end on this. He
[1:36:12] enters into his prayer here. And I want
[1:36:15] it to make it our prayer.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Hold to that little wheel in the middle
[1:36:22] of the wheel. Let it stabilize every
[1:36:25] move and every motion that you make.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; Every thought that you have, may it be
[1:36:31] controlled by this tower on the inside
[1:36:34] of you. Because God is sitting right in
[1:36:38] his word of this hour in the evening
[1:36:41] light showing forth his light.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Here we are today sitting in the midst
[1:36:47] of the word and the word being revealed
[1:36:48] to us by Jesus Christ. Then this is
[1:36:50] God's word and be his subjects and be a
[1:36:53] subject. We must walk close to the
[1:36:55] author of the author to understand for
[1:36:57] it to reveal. Now, how many say,
[1:36:59] "Brother Paul, I want to walk closer to
[1:37:01] the author of the book
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; so that he can be me bring me more
[1:37:04] understanding that I can shine my light
[1:37:07] in this darkness." And so, I want to
[1:37:09] walk close to the author to understand
[1:37:12] for it to reveal. Oh Lord, what wilt
[1:37:15] thou have me to do? Now listen, this is
[1:37:17] where Abraham was. This is where he is
[1:37:19] ending. The evening lights have shine.
[1:37:21] Lord, light my candle. But here's how it
[1:37:24] ends up. Us four are no more. I'm happy
[1:37:27] with my promise. No, he's saying, "Oh
[1:37:30] Lord, what will thou have me to do this
[1:37:33] year, Lord? What will you have me to
[1:37:35] do?"
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Sounds like a seed of Abraham to me.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Sounds like what Abraham was saying.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; If I must go to the fields and preach
[1:37:46] the gospel or must stay at home.
[1:37:50] Brother Rap, you were on that at camp a
[1:37:52] little bit that sometimes we glorify
[1:37:54] what am I going to do for the Lord? big
[1:37:55] positions, going overseas, all these
[1:37:57] other things. Often, brother Brandon
[1:37:59] mentions these things as being great
[1:38:01] works as well that God is using. Or if I
[1:38:03] must stay at home, sisters, that's a
[1:38:07] calling, too.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; Lord, what would you have me to do? Stay
[1:38:11] home? Well, God gets just as much glory
[1:38:13] out of it. No matter what it is, if it
[1:38:15] must be a good housewife or if I must be
[1:38:17] a good mother, if I must do this, that
[1:38:20] or the other, whatever it is, if I must
[1:38:22] be a farmer, whatever it is, Lord, what
[1:38:25] would you have me to do? Wasn't that
[1:38:27] what Saul cried out there, Lord, what
[1:38:29] would you have me to do? When the light
[1:38:32] struck Paul, he said, Lord, what would
[1:38:35] you have me to do?
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; First, he said, who are you, Lord? He
[1:38:39] said, I'm Jesus. Once he knew it was,
[1:38:41] you know, the next question, what would
[1:38:42] you have me to do?
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; Can God just burn any selfishness and
[1:38:47] self-focused out of us in this message?
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Make me like my father Abraham. Take all
[1:38:54] the selfishness out and all the
[1:38:55] nitpicking and all criticism. I le next
[1:38:59] Sunday, Lord willing, I want to talk
[1:39:00] about if I have to don't have to go out
[1:39:02] and see my daughter. We'll see how it
[1:39:04] goes. But next Sunday, I want to talk
[1:39:05] about things that cause division
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; in the Bible.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Because we need to know what causes
[1:39:12] division because we're not interested in
[1:39:14] more division.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; We're interested in oneness.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; To come to oneness to this word so we
[1:39:20] can bring this rapture on.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Lord, burn all the self- focus. Lord,
[1:39:25] make me like the father, my father
[1:39:27] Abraham. that with his promise in the
[1:39:30] bag, he reached out and says, "But what
[1:39:33] about those other ones?
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; What?" And the prophet's saying the same
[1:39:37] thing. What would you have me to do?
[1:39:39] Excuse me for referring to him that way.
[1:39:41] We we believe that Malachi 4 was
[1:39:44] fulfilled that the last days,
[1:39:46] Revelations 10:7. And so there's many
[1:39:48] scriptures that talk about a prophet in
[1:39:50] the end time. If you come and see me,
[1:39:51] I'll be glad to explain that to you.
[1:39:53] There's too many scriptures to deny it.
[1:39:54] And we believe God used a ministry at
[1:39:56] the last days to bring us back to Bible
[1:39:58] faith.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; Okay? So, don't let that stumble you.
[1:40:02] I'll be glad to share that with you. And
[1:40:04] we we quote from all the seven age
[1:40:06] messengers that were in go Christ's
[1:40:08] right right hand in the book of
[1:40:09] Revelations. We quote from a lot of
[1:40:10] them, other gospel ministers, but the
[1:40:13] seventh one we quote from quite a bit
[1:40:14] because we realize he's the closest one
[1:40:16] to point us in the right direction back
[1:40:18] to Bible faith in this evening light.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. What would you have me
[1:40:23] to do? I think that's a good word. He
[1:40:25] said he would Paul come down to the road
[1:40:27] down to put the church into prison. But
[1:40:29] when the he cried out, "What would you
[1:40:30] have me to do?" When the light turned on
[1:40:32] as a big pillar of fire hanging above
[1:40:34] him, "What would you have me to do?" The
[1:40:36] response in Paul, the response here in
[1:40:39] Brother Brandham, response of Abraham
[1:40:41] when the light was shining to him, the
[1:40:44] question is now what would you have me
[1:40:47] to do for others?
[1:40:49] Same response. Paul meets the pitifier.
[1:40:52] what would you have me to do? And I
[1:40:54] think that's a good word to close on and
[1:40:56] say, Lord, what would you have me to do?
[1:41:01] When I see this scripture so perfectly
[1:41:03] revealed right now, Lord, what would you
[1:41:05] have me to do? Let us bow our heads.
[1:41:09] I ask everyone in here to search out
[1:41:11] your hearts now and ask that question.
[1:41:14] Lord,
[1:41:16] what would you have me to do?
[1:41:19] And you people, if you're still on the
[1:41:20] telephone wires across the nation these
[1:41:23] days, it would be streaming as some are
[1:41:25] today. You bow your heads and ask,
[1:41:28] "Lord,
[1:41:29] what would you have me to do?" Can we do
[1:41:31] that just now?
[1:41:33] Seeing that we're here in the last days,
[1:41:35] in the last hours, just so perfectly
[1:41:37] before, so plainly revealed, "What would
[1:41:40] you have me to do?" He keeps coming back
[1:41:41] to that. Dear God, while they're asking
[1:41:44] you that question, I ask myself to you,
[1:41:48] what would you have me do? Lord, as I
[1:41:51] realize that each day must be counted
[1:41:54] for. And I pray that you'll help me,
[1:41:57] Lord, to live so that each day,
[1:42:01] if you want a a New Year's goal, here's
[1:42:03] one. Let me live a life so that each day
[1:42:07] it'll be counted to your honor and your
[1:42:11] glory. Amen.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Don't miss a day. Every day.
[1:42:16] What would you have me to do?
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; And I want to make every day count
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; for his glory. You may only have two
[1:42:25] days left. You may only have 10. We're
[1:42:28] pretty close. Okay? We may not have a
[1:42:31] year to plan out our our goals. We may
[1:42:33] have just tomorrow.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; We don't know. But can we all have that
[1:42:37] before the Lord?
[1:42:41] Can we can we ask it? Lord, what would
[1:42:43] you have me to do?
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Burn all of the selfishness out of me.
[1:42:48] Burn all the self-focus out of me. I
[1:42:50] pray the Lord takes it from our rank.
[1:42:52] Somehow we have way too much of it. But
[1:42:55] we can start here this morning. If there
[1:42:58] be any selfish way in us, make me like
[1:43:02] my father Abraham that's pleading that's
[1:43:04] pleading. Lord, can I shine this light?
[1:43:07] What will you have me to do? Light my
[1:43:11] candle. Can you close your eyes and ask
[1:43:13] that, Lord? Light my candle.
[1:43:16] Light my candle. Light my life with your
[1:43:20] word, Lord. Change me, Father. Burn out
[1:43:23] all the selfishness and all the
[1:43:25] selffocus. Oh God,
[1:43:28] seeking for and running after what I
[1:43:30] want, Lord. Here we are with Sodom
[1:43:33] getting ready to go down. What can I do
[1:43:36] for you, Lord?
[1:43:38] How can I further your kingdom? Can I
[1:43:41] talk to somebody? Can I be a blessing to
[1:43:44] somebody? Can I be light, Lord, shining
[1:43:46] in this darkness?
[1:43:49] Light my candle, Lord. I pray.
[1:43:53] Father, I
[1:43:55] spent time with you the other night,
[1:43:58] Lord, just writing down my goals and
[1:44:00] things. But Lord, it's not so much
[1:44:02] writing them down. And this one, this
[1:44:04] one trumps all of them. Lord, how can I
[1:44:06] serve your kingdom? How can I How can I
[1:44:10] find what I'm supposed to do, Lord, and
[1:44:12] fulfill that, Lord?
[1:44:15] Let me never let money or popularity,
[1:44:19] anything take the place
[1:44:22] of this calling for this last days.
[1:44:25] Who's carrying this evening light? when
[1:44:27] you said there shall be light about the
[1:44:29] evening time and we received it Lord
[1:44:32] through Malachi 4 but Lord who's
[1:44:33] carrying it
[1:44:35] we're carrying it Lord
[1:44:38] may we carry it to the darkest moments
[1:44:40] the darkest places that you would choose
[1:44:43] to put us in not that we go there but
[1:44:46] Lord the places that are dark that we
[1:44:48] are in and called to may you speak
[1:44:52] through us if not through words
[1:44:55] through our life.
[1:44:57] Humble us, Lord.
[1:45:00] Teach us, Lord, what it means to be this
[1:45:04] last light that would shine on this
[1:45:06] earth as tribulation comes in. And Lord,
[1:45:11] there's a part of us that says, "Come
[1:45:12] quickly, Lord Jesus. We want to get out
[1:45:14] of here." But then there's another part
[1:45:16] that says, "Oh, but Lord, I I don't want
[1:45:18] to leave my family members behind.
[1:45:21] I don't want those to end up in
[1:45:23] tribulation. Lord, I cry out for them. I
[1:45:26] I ask you, Lord, save my loved ones.
[1:45:28] Save my uncles and aunts. Save my
[1:45:31] family. Lord, I ask you, Lord, do
[1:45:34] something to reach out to them, Lord,
[1:45:37] because they don't know how close we
[1:45:38] are, but I know how close we are, Lord.
[1:45:40] You showed me your secrets like you did
[1:45:43] to Abraham, and how close we are to
[1:45:45] destruction. I know it, Lord. So because
[1:45:48] of that, I want to be that one that ask
[1:45:51] for mercy for my family members and
[1:45:54] those Lord that we're influencing in the
[1:45:58] community, in our schools and our jobs
[1:46:00] wherever we're at. Lord, may we die to
[1:46:05] the pride
[1:46:07] of looking at the surface of who we are
[1:46:09] and that we know more than everybody
[1:46:11] else. May we die to all of that. And may
[1:46:14] we come alive with this light, Lord.
[1:46:18] As John Wesley said, "What do I do for
[1:46:21] the kingdom?" He says, "Just catch on
[1:46:23] fire and the world will come and watch
[1:46:25] you burn." Grant it, Father. I pray each
[1:46:28] of these young people that are here.
[1:46:32] Lord, if you would light their life with
[1:46:34] the Holy Ghost,
[1:46:36] they'd be so instrumental, Lord, in
[1:46:39] shining your light in areas, Lord, that
[1:46:41] we can't get to. Now Lord, I pray move
[1:46:45] upon their hearts. Move upon their
[1:46:47] lives. Lord, may they be broken. Lord,
[1:46:51] not to go back, try to fix their own
[1:46:52] problems, but today is the day I come. I
[1:46:56] respond.
[1:46:58] I give my life. Light my life with your
[1:47:01] word. I pray in the name of Jesus
[1:47:05] Christ.
[1:47:08] Let's stand together. You're welcome to
[1:47:11] come to this altar if you're receiving
[1:47:12] the Lord.
[1:47:14] We'll be glad to pray with your desire
[1:47:17] because God is
[1:47:20] God is looking at you this morning.
[1:47:23] He'll take whatever yielding you give
[1:47:26] him. He'll take that and begin to work
[1:47:27] from that. How many believe that
[1:47:30] pleasing? Let's just worship now. Let me
[1:47:34] be pleasing
[1:47:38] to you.
[1:47:41] Let everything
[1:47:43] oh Jesus
[1:47:45] that I do
[1:47:48] be pleasing
[1:47:52] to you.
[1:47:57] Praying
[1:48:02] that everything
[1:48:06] I
[1:48:08] pursue,
[1:48:10] oh be pleased,
[1:48:15] oh Lord,
[1:48:18] unto you. We're making it our prayer now
[1:48:21] as we sing it again. You come to the
[1:48:24] altar if you want to receive Christ
[1:48:25] today. Oh, please.
[1:48:32] Let me be pleased
[1:48:38] to you. Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord.
[1:48:42] Everything.
[1:48:47] Do you want to begin this year on a good
[1:48:50] path towards the Lord? Come to the
[1:48:52] altar. Give your life to Christ. Turn it
[1:48:55] all over to him. Give everything to him.
[1:48:57] Let it go.
[1:49:02] Hallelujah. Let everything
[1:49:08] I pursue.
[1:49:15] Come to the altar and give your all.
[1:49:17] Begin this year the right way.
[1:49:21] Laying it all at the altar. everything
[1:49:23] that you are, your time, your energy,
[1:49:25] everything to him. Oh, please
[1:49:30] some of the ministers can come and pray
[1:49:32] with these.
[1:49:34] Let some of the sisters want to come and
[1:49:36] pray.
[1:49:39] Do we have time this morning to just
[1:49:41] take this time in his presence to
[1:49:43] respond to him?
[1:49:47] Oh Jesus,
[1:49:50] further your kingdom, Lord. Bring the
[1:49:52] kingdom inside these. Lord,
[1:49:56] let them receive Christ. Let them
[1:49:57] receive Christ.
[1:50:01] I give my all to you. I give my time. I
[1:50:04] give my energy. I give my ambitions to
[1:50:06] you.
[1:50:08] Have you given everything to him?
[1:50:13] Oh,
[1:50:16] I may just I want more than a religion.
[1:50:18] And I want God to light my candle full
[1:50:21] of the Holy Ghost like lamps trimmed and
[1:50:24] burning to burn the midnight oil.
[1:50:26] Hallelujah.
[1:50:29] Want to be burning,
[1:50:32] burning the midnight. Oh, sing it now.
[1:50:38] With my lamp. With my lamp. Oh, trimmed
[1:50:42] and glowing.
[1:50:44] A vessel full of the Holy Ghost.
[1:50:48] I will shine the light. This is what
[1:50:51] matters this morning
[1:50:54] to the word. I must be Lord.
[1:50:59] Oh, there is a virgin bride
[1:51:04] burning the midnight.
[1:51:07] That's what I want to be. Hallelujah.
[1:51:09] Sing it now. I want to be burning.
[1:51:14] Burning the midnight.
[1:51:20] With my lamp all trimmed and glowing,
[1:51:25] a vessel full of the Holy Ghost, I will
[1:51:30] shine the light.
[1:51:33] Through the night to the word I must be
[1:51:37] Lord.
[1:51:41] There is a virgin bride
[1:51:44] burning the midnight. Oh.
[1:51:50] Oh, think about it now. Jesus said it.
[1:51:53] And in the midnight hour there'll be
[1:51:56] virgins who hear the great cry. Think
[1:51:59] about it. It's what Jesus said. Behold,
[1:52:02] he cometh. Rise and trim your lash. Go
[1:52:05] and meet him. The bridegroom is nigh.
[1:52:09] Oh, it's close friends. But some
[1:52:11] discovered they were lacking the oil.
[1:52:15] They were empty with no light to see.
[1:52:19] So I ask you, dear Lord, come and fill
[1:52:23] me with your spirit. Keep me burning for
[1:52:26] you is my belief. I want to be burning.
[1:52:34] Oh,
[1:52:37] hallelujah. With my lamp all trimmed and
[1:52:41] glowing,
[1:52:43] a vessel full of the Holy Ghost,
[1:52:47] I will shine the light
[1:52:51] through the night to the word. I must be
[1:52:55] Lord.
[1:52:57] Yes, Lord.
[1:52:59] There is a virgin bright
[1:53:02] burn in the midnight. Oh,
[1:53:06] hallelujah. Think about it now. Oh,
[1:53:10] sometimes I really get to wondering why
[1:53:13] it's a struggle. Think about
[1:53:17] think about the darkness
[1:53:19] in the spirit of complacency.
[1:53:23] We're surrounded by them. How many wants
[1:53:26] to pierce through that darkness? Yes. I
[1:53:29] am running with the burning. Oh God,
[1:53:32] burn it within me, Lord.
[1:53:34] Light of my Let's pray together.
[1:53:37] We're looking day and night with the one
[1:53:40] you hold cross. It's time for us to
[1:53:43] rise.
[1:53:48] I want to be perfect.
[1:54:02] A vessel full of the Holy Ghost. I will
[1:54:08] shine the light
[1:54:10] through the night to the word. I must be
[1:54:14] Lord.
[1:54:18] There is a mercy
[1:54:22] burning midnight. Oh.
[1:54:25] Oh, I want to be I want to be worthy.
[1:54:31] Burning the midnight
[1:54:37] with my trim and glory.
[1:54:42] Vessel full of the Holy Ghost.
[1:54:46] I will shine the light
[1:54:50] through the night to the word I must
[1:54:54] belong. Oh,
[1:54:58] there is a virgin bright
[1:55:01] burning midnight. Oh,
[1:55:09] she is my
[1:55:14] great shepherd
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; to
[1:55:20] you.
[1:55:21] Light up those lights up at your will.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; Lord, with all my heart
[1:55:29] I worship you.

[1:57:47] desire
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; to honor
[1:57:54] honor you.
