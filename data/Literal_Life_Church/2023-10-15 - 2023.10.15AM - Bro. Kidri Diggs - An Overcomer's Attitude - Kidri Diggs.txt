prayer if you have an unspoken request you can acknowledge it to the Lord by uplifted hand let's pray Lord Jesus father we are here on the merits of your mercy and Grace Lord know there's no good thing that we could do father that's Place Us in this position but it's all your election and your choosing Lord Lord and you see that hands that are lifted to you father to identify a need or a desire Lord and we know that you're more than able Lord to touch that need or that desire but Lord we pray this morning Lord that our desire and our need would be according to your perfect will Lord God that we wouldn't want father anything that you don't already have for us Lord but Lord God we would pray Lord and we desire the leadership of the Holy Spirit Lord knowing father if it's your will nothing could stop it from coming to pass Lord no no enemy Lord no situation nothing could hinder it from coming forth Lord in its fullness so Lord God we give it to you this morning Lord we thank you for the atmosphere Lord you've allowed us to create as amateur creators Lord that's what you said about us Lord so we create an atmosphere today that we're believing that you are welcome Lord and Lord if you're welcome Lord you're welcome to be everything that you are in our lives right now Lord some may need healing Lord some may need Deliverance or encouragement or financial blessing or whatever it may be Lord we put you in position right now to be that God who is a reward of those that diligently seek him Lord and Lord God we know that there different situations in families Lord and and in churches Lord and we put the hand of God before it Lord and we give you our faith this morning Lord along with our B souls and spirit Lord that you'd have a dominating presence over us today Lord Lord that nothing of the past Lord or nothing even right now in the present would hinder us from being dominated by the spirit of the Holy Ghost and father we want the Holy Ghost to take full control of us and the servants both speaker and hearer Lord Lord not just in the sanctuary Lord but father throughout the rest of this day Lord when we leave this place Lord let the word that's been sold Lord bring forth a h hundredfold Lord and we pray for the pastor Pastor Paul Lord you just continue to use them Lord in a mighty way to touch lives Lord and father all those that follow him Lord that they're following the spirit of Christ the voice of the Lord which is more than just the man because we as men and as women we have failures but with you leading Lord and you being the Forefront of Our Lives Lord L father it takes over anything that we can do as men and women so Lord God let the projection of Our Lives be the projection of Christ and Lord God we ask as we say so many times Lord forgive us for our sins Lord the trespasses Lord in our lives Lord the transgressions Lord the things that no one else sees but you Lord that may be a stench in your nostril Lord we ask that that blood would atone right now Lord that it will still be a sacrifice Lord amen for the covering in our lives Lord Jesus father we bless your name Lord God and we we're in expectation of what you will do with us in the service in the precious and Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ we pray Let the church say Amen the church say amen amen before we read amen I just want to give thanks to you all amen we we always enjoy ourselves and and and we feel so welcome when we come I I appreciate brother Paul so much you know because to me he's one of the brothers that I can truly say is a friend you know and uh you know God called Abraham friend Hallelujah you know but he called him friend through his trials amen and that's how you know who really is your friend amen when they can when they can still show their love no matter what you going through they may not even have an explanation for what you're going through but they still show their love amen and that's I feel about brother Paul you know I I really appreciate him you know I appreciate his wife his family his church family all of you guys amen because what I see when I come is I see the expression of love you know there's there's there's great gifts there's great Ministries you know that we're all different people we have our own individual personalities but what we should be reflecting is the love of God Amen church people say it all the time I want perfect love perfect love but you got to get there amen so I I really thank God for him and what he's doing and how God is using him I think we have to realize that you know David was a man of God's very own heart but the men that God gave to David was just as powerful as he was let's realize something David was was a giant killer but all the men that followed David were also giant Killers Hallelujah so you you need to consider what God is doing when you look at your pastor and you see the goodness of God and the grace of God you're a part of that which God is doing in his life so we appreciate him amen and I know it's pastor's appreciation and I just thank God for a good pastor cuz I have one amen but let's just uh get into the word of God today how many expectation that's all about 10 of you anybody in expectation Hallelujah let's pretend I said pretend let's pretend we are a part of the Ohio rivalry Ohio and Michigan Let's Pretend Hallelujah and you have the skills to win the game I got you now amen let's go to St John chapter 11 St John chapter 11 St John chap 11 and verse one I don't know about y'all but I feel good in the Lord amen rain yesterday and now the sun is shining Hallelujah but it was shining yesterday yes it yes it was we have to look beyond the conditions amen uh St John 11 verse1 if you have it say Amen the Bible says now a certain man was sick named Lazareth of Bethany the town of Mary and his his sister M her sister Martha it was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with a hair whose brother Lazarus was sick there therefore for his sisters sent unto him saying Lord behold he whom thou lovest is sick when Jesus heard that he said this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of God that the Son of God might be glorified thereby oh my praise the Lord let's go to Second Corinthians second Corinthians chapter I want chapter 12 2 Corinthians chapter 12 second Corinthians chapter 12 oh my praise the Lord 2 Corinthians 12 and let's start reading that verse verse let's start at verse six 2 Corinthians 12 and6 the Bible says for though I will desire to Glory I shall not be a fool for I will say the truth but now I forbear lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be or that he heareth of me and L I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the Revelation there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest I should be exalted above measure for this thing I besought the Lord Thrice that it might depart from me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore I will rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me oh my let's read that again listen to what Paul says he says and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest rest upon me amen may the Lord the blessing reading of his word you can have your seats praise God let's give the Lord a hand clap of Praise amen this morning by the help of God I want to use for a subject a Overcomers attitude a Overcomers attitude you know I think that word attitude is very important to the Christian amen it's very important to our Christian walk our attitude even right now just being in church you know how you sit reflects your attitude you know how you how you worship when the songs were going forth it it it kind of tells me what your attitude is concerning worship you know uh uh depending on the event or what the event is and where it's at the clothes you put on tells me your attitude concerning that event you know so how attitude is very important Hallelujah you know your attitude uh per se can be uh known as or looked upon as a behavior Hallelujah you know one thing we hate when we tell our kids something sister spur we hate hallu to tell them something and they give us what an attitude oh you know that one huh they give us an attitude that attit means that they don't quite agree with what you're telling them to do and most times there's consequences and repercussions when you have an attitude Hallelujah so as a Believer if we could say this morning what kind of attitude should we have concerning the things of God and you know Hallelujah one of the uh Premier statements that our Prophet made is that the right mental attitude Hallelujah Hall Hallelujah the right mental attitude will bring any Divine promise of God to pass Hallelujah and I know right now some of you are needing something for God or you want God to do something but let me ask you this morning what is your attitude concerning God doing that for you Hallelujah cuz sometimes God will make it linger or God will do it just like that because of your attitude Hallelujah and you know church when we look in the scriptures one thing God hates is a bad attitude Hallelujah because one thing about God he knows what he's able to do and can you imagine us praying to God and asking him to do something and then we get an attitude because he don't do it when we ask him to do it now let's keep in mind he's well aware to do it can I get an amen your prayers your desires God is well aware to do it he's more than able to do it so why should we have an attitude that he's not amen this morning our attitude should be expectation hallu you say brother why do you say that well I'm going to give you a scripture Hallelujah that shows what our attitude should be like Hallelujah the scripture says wherever two or three are gathered I don't know about you but that does something to me Hallelujah he says wherever two or three what kind of two or three Believers wherever two or three Believers are gathered Hallelujah now I know I'm a Believer I believe brother Joe is a Believer I believe this brother's a Believer and this brother's a Believer this brother's a Believer so right now I got more than two or three Hallelujah I know she's a believer I know she's a Believer I know I know he's a Believer Hallelujah let's keep going Hallelujah wherever two or three are gathered in my name Hallelujah now I don't know how you come I don't know what you're believe in but I come in the name of Jesus Christ can I get a witness can I get a witness that we're all here because of Jesus Christ Hallelujah we come and We Gather in the name of Jesus Christ can I get an amen we are gathered in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ two or three I don't know about it's maybe 150 to 200 in here I don't know about the other 147 but I know I got three huj and then the Bible says I only need two Hallelujah so if I'm not sure about the rest of y'all I got my daughter I know she's a Believer hallelujah hallelujah so I ain't got time to question whether you believe or not I'm a grab hold of somebody I know that can make this word come to pass with me Hallelujah so two or three of us are gathered in his name in the name of Jesus Christ then the Bible says hallelujah if those two or three would touch and agree concerning anything that's my attitude Hallelujah if I find somebody in here this morning let me get Gideon Hallelujah if I find somebody who can agree can touch and agree with me the Bible says that we can have what we ask for that should be our attitude this morning that if we touch and agree concerning anything in the name of name of Jesus we should have it Hallelujah but what God has to do he has to Hallelujah bounce our attitudes Hallelujah God has to put us in check cuz a lot of times we're not looking at things how God is looking at it anybody got trials anybody got pain Hallelujah and sometimes that trial and that pain will affect your attitude but I'm here to say hallelujah that pain can be a blessing W Hallelujah trials and tribulation can be a blessing Hallelujah suffering trouble can be a blessing Hallelujah because it's by those things that God can't help but come on the scene Hallelujah but what we have to do we have to Solomon we have to adjust our attitude while we're suffering we have to adjust our attitude while we're going through pain we have to adjust our attitude while there's trouble in your life Hallelujah cuz I'm going give you another scripture the Bible says he'll put no more on you oh my do I got a church in here this morning he'll put no more on you than you can bear so my attitude should reflect that whatever I'm going through I can overcome it whatever I'm going through is there to make me stronger whatever I'm going through is only for a period of time it's not forever Hallelujah so our attitudes are to reflect that God is in control oh my but what we do we get in the moment what's the key thing that messes up your attitude the key thing that messes up our attitude is this thing called your imagination oh yeah let me show you how powerful the imagination can be remember the story of the garden well and y'all forgive me I'm not a pool pit preacher I'm a walker Hallelujah my attitude is to walk Hallelujah my attitude is to connect with your spirits you didn't know that was going on Hallelujah watch me good I'm going to places where people are pulling if you want me on your you got in the pull hallelujah hallelujah you want me to talk to you you got the pull amen if you if your attitude is just to say brother di preaching that's all you going to get is some preaching Hallelujah but if your attitude is Lord let him talk to me Lord let him talk to me something will begin to direct my feet towards your path what is it you're pull H you pull what happens I preach you pull I preach you pull I preach you quit I stop you resist I sniff so there's three different levels in here this morning for your attitude that's right Hallelujah but you know church when we look at these things and and we appreciate what God is doing the pre the primary thing that affects our attitude is our imagination now let's get this straight Hallelujah and the key thing Hallelujah that that that motivates and move your imagination is fear Hallelujah you said oh when I get to heaven it's going to be such a rejoicing Hallelujah in the beginning we didn't need an imagination for that Adam was created in the image of God the likeness of God so he didn't had to I can only imagine what it be like surrounded by Your glory what would my life be we didn't have to imagine Adam was in the presence of God every day it worked like clockwork he knew what the voice of God was he didn't have to pray about whether this is God or not when he heard it he knew it was God there was no imagination there it was only reality God so what brought forth an imagination the fall are you with me church so let's be careful where we are in our attitudes today now we know that Satan wanted to get into uh God's he wanted to get in God's way so he got in creation he used Eve Hallelujah cuz she was the weaker vessel no matter how you want to say it Hallelujah she was the weaker vessel so Satan came to her first cuz he knew he could influence her attitude because when he saw Adam he saw the same one that kicked him out of heaven so his attitude was and it's always been and it shall be to this day I'm not messing with that Son of God hallelujah when the devil saw Adam he said I'm not messing with that Son of God and when you get the holy spirit inside of you it's still the same attitude concerning a Son of God the devil won't mess with you if you know who you are Hallelujah so we know the story they sin they fall into sin and now the next thing starts to happen they go from a reality to an imagination What do they do fear came in Hallelujah although adultery was the first act fear was the first Act attribute of sin Hallelujah and now in this day in this time even right now while I'm preaching on it some of you need to overcome your fears there are things in your life Hallelujah that's holding you back from giving God your all there are things in your life Hallelujah that's holding your marriage back there are things in your life that's holding your worship back there are things in your life that holding your life back what is it it's fear but what the enemy has done he's given it a a a proper name he's given it a proper name and now we've accepted it and doctors have given it a proper name Hallelujah Physicians and and psychologists all these people have given it a proper name and now we've accepted the spirit what's the proper name it's called anxiety we hear people confess it all the time my anxiety my anxiety oh I just my anxiety when I get there it's just my anxiety let me tell you something that's just fear and fear comes from where the devil Hallelujah and if it came from the devil it's a part of your imagination and if it came from the devil it doesn't have an origin of creation it's a perversion [Applause] I want to strip the enemy so bad today that we walk out of here like we be doing a goose step in the [Applause] spirit listen God says hallelujah through a Vindicated Prophet that Satan cannot create all he can do is pervert so fear here is not a creation and if it doesn't have an origin I'm going to say something that's going to shock you if it doesn't have an origin is it really real if it's not a creation is it really real if it's not a creation it's a perversion of other creation is it really real cuz if you turn it around to what it really supposed to be then you have the substance of it Hallelujah but once you live in the life of it after it's been converted it's a lie how many of us today are living a lie I'm talking about the attitude of an overcomer Hallelujah but listen God comes down in the cool of the day like he's always did like he like he's always done Hallelujah even after Hallelujah sin came in God in his faithfulness Hallelujah his attitude was these are my children Hallelujah and I'm not going to let sin affect our relationship Hallelujah it'll affect our fellowship but it's not going to affect our relationship God looked at Adam and Eve still as a son and a daughter oh my how many of us can look at one another as children as people of God with certain things in our life that we might see but we do we look at one another say oh man did you hear my brother so and so you hear what he going through he must be the devil God didn't call Adam the devil he didn't call Eve the devil but what did he do he called him by the name he originally gave them he didn't say sinner sinner where are thou adulterer adulterer where are thou unbeliever unbeliever where are thou but he said Adam Adam where are thou so even after he fell into sin God didn't live in imagination God lived in reality and I want to live in my reality and God has made me an overcomer God has made you an overcomer and that should be our attitude not succumbing to the imagination of anxiety you know there are people among us who don't like to be around crowds oh I just I just get afraid when I'm around too many people don't get afraid that's just who you are you like to be alone what is I get the terms mixed up uh introvert extrovert Hallelujah now you may look at me and you say he has to be an extrovert has to be cuz he's loud he's wow he's all over the place he just loves to be around and something happen uhuhuh that's just the gift but who I am I just like to be by myself sometimes H I just like to think about what's going on sometimes but that shouldn't produce a fear in your life Hallelujah that's just Hallelujah a part of how God Made You Hallelujah like we may have some people that like to shout and dance and worship Hallelujah you have some people who just like to lift their hands and cry you have some people who like to stare now the staring one is a challenge for me hallelujah hallelujah unless you got a strong pull in your stair Hallelujah but then there are some people who don't say a word but you can feel a connection hallelujah amen they're just dare their expectation they're on the edge of their seat and they're saying amen my brother inside amen my brother inside Hallelujah my brother inside thank you Jesus my brother inside and the minister can feel it Hallelujah even the worshippers can feel those who really have a spirit of worship in their heart and they may not be they may just be doing us Lord let them worship let your praise flow to me but it's connecting Hallelujah but you look at how God hallelujah how God now remember I'm dealing with an attitude first you look at how God hallelujah look at his attitude towards Adam and Eve after the fall after sin came into their life God didn't move in an imaginary Mode God remained the same Hallelujah he still wanted Fellowship yeah but oh my God told Paul Hallelujah my grace is sufficient for you Hallelujah don't worry about what's going on in your life my grace is sufficient I have this there for a purpose can you believe it church God allowed the fall for a purpose so we would just be Angels but we would be Sons and Daughters of redemption to know what it means to come through things and still feel the love of God to know what it means to have failures in your life and God still show up as a deliverer oh my I want to I want to I want to I want to caution you don't wait 45 minutes to get into what I'm saying cuz I might be quitting by then cuz y'all know right now I'm about to close hallelujah what we do our attitudes is it's like brother say something I've never heard give me something that can challenge my mind the challenge to God is not in your mind the challenge to God is deliver it from your heart Hallelujah see fear Hallelujah can conquer your mind that's right Hallelujah how many athletes have become Hallelujah gold medalists and champions Hallelujah because they played the game or they they they they lived through the game from what was in their heart they conquered what their fears they overcame what their anxieties hallelujah what did it reflect their attitude they have something Hallelujah in the sports world where they call that man that woman she must be a dog y'all heard that expression a dog means that they going to grab hold of it and they ain't going to let it go till it becomes their huah so in the Sports World Michael Jordan was considered a dog in the Sports World Florence Griffin jordal was considered a dog Hallelujah in the Sports World Hallelujah Gabby Douglas is consider considered a dog Hallelujah but you know who God called dogs first Hallelujah he said should I give the children's bread to that dog but look at her look at the attitude of a dog Hallelujah she says truth Lord but the dog eat from the crown eat the crowns from the table of the Believers so yes Lord I'll be your dog but I ain't just an ordinary dog I'm a can Corso or maybe a Argentina Dogo and if that one is too strong for you just let me be a pit bull everybody know about a pitbull H they got rules and regulations for when you buy a pitbull oh but it's just a regular dog it's how that dog is trained by the master which allows the nature to come out now what kind of dog are you some of you have been in poodle mode too long some of you been in pole mode too long you just nice and pretty even your bark don't scare nobody how many of you ever seen a poodle and got afraid it just don't happen Hallelujah but I'll give you another small dog that you think twice about when you come around a Chihuahua Hallelujah so it's just like what the prophet said it ain't the size of the dog it's the size of the fight that's in the dog H cuz you step in a room Hallelujah with a Rowdy wild Chihuahua and he'll let you know El cocko kettle bell or however you say it in Spanish and he he will make his presence known and if you take him for granted you might get bit see and Satan has been taking some of you Chihuahuas for granted you need to bite the devil you need to say hey look here I'm an overcomer and what God has made me I'm going to display that that's my attit think about it Church the attitude of a Chihuahua he's this big but his attitude is like [Applause] this Hallelujah his attitude is the attitude of a of a of a St Bernard Co Jo Hallelujah but we look at Hallelujah God's attitude once the imagination of the believer came into sight God didn't change God knew they was going to experience pain but his attitude didn't change God was going to use the pain to make them an overcomer H but what he has to do he has to allow us to look through his lens that's the only way we're going to overcome Hallelujah because look fear is not connected to your flesh no it's not connected to your flesh it's connected to that inward man H what's stopping you from touching the stove again hallelujah it's not your five senses it's your memory Hallelujah see it's your memory first then touch comes into place so fear deals with the inward man that's why fear can be a torment and too often the devil hasn't even done anything but our imagination makes it run wild and here just to say what I'm saying hallelujah God comes down and he says Adam Adam where are thou his faithfulness is God faithful I want you to testify is God faithful Hallelujah is God faithful he's faithful to conquer your fears Hallelujah let's live in a reality today as an overcomer look God comes down he says Adam Adam where are thou he didn't call them by the sin they just produced he called them by the revelation of who they were Hallelujah Adam Adam where are thou and then he comes down and the first thing they begin to say Lord we hid ourselves because we were naked now God is f to address their attitudes their thinking first thing God says is who told you you was naked because God didn't give them that kind of exposure Hallelujah so if there's something you're fearing God didn't put it in there hallelujah it's something that's perverted you allowed to be perverted in your life and it's stopping you from making a contact with God he said who told you was naked but before we get to that part listen to what they say look at their attitude they say we heard you we heard your voice in the garden now the question is hadn't they always heard his voice in the garden so that didn't change still the same God we heard your voice in the garden and we ran and hid ourselves so what happened between them always hearing God's voice and now they're running hiding themselves what came in me fear fear will cause you to run from God when God is trying to have Fellowship fear will cause you to run from God when God is trying to be faithful Hallelujah are you with me Church Hallelujah and now Hallelujah God says who told you was naked and the first we do we start to blame somebody else when you the one going through it I'm going to give you a pre example of something I like talking about and I probably said this here before Hallelujah but it's just a part of my Ministry so I'll say it again real Deliverance is not you running from what you're delivered from say brother what do you mean if God delivered you from being a smoker hallah you're not running from cigarette packs in the Walmart I can't go down that aisle cigarettes are down right I seen a I seen a mar pack out that's not Deliverance that's fear I was in a restaurant one time eating with a brother I was preaching for him that weekend and we were sitting in we sitting in a restaurant and you know how they have music playing in the restaurant you know coughman you know how that brother was hitting that field yesterday you know that was in our spirit when we got back my daughter couldn't stop we almost got in the hotel [Applause] went the music was in my spirit H but it was a joyous sound Hallelujah see that's what real worship should do it should bring a joy in your life it shouldn't make you depressed or judgmental real worship that is but anyway I'm going to leave that alone cuz I know we got to all everybody has a difference of opinione and my thing is why is it so hard cuz the Bible says hallelujah in the mind of God we all shouted and dance for joy in the mind of God hallelujah now what was the Rhythm in God's mind I don't know but I know I was there brother Kenny I don't know but I knew I was there so I worship in God's mind all I can do is do it here on this side it ain't my job to explain to you why I worship the way I worship Hallelujah just let me be free Hallelujah cuz I know what it's like to be bound to rap music when it come on I know what it's like huah some of you folks in here know what it's like to be bound by country music what do you mean to be bound country music has a spirit of depression on [Music] it and you think oh man I just love G Brooks he's just oh my boyfriend left me and my girlfriend gone they always singing about their pain and Taylor Swift all her broken relationships there's a spirit on everything Hallelujah but let me leave that alone Hallelujah I let him do that H well better yet I should be able to do it let me take the licks as an evangelist Amen Let me take the links Hallelujah cuz the prophet of God said the Evangelist he comes and stands between you and the enemy that's right Hallelujah and if there's any kind of spirit in the land that's trying to stop the people from worshiping that's an evil spirit Hallelujah cuz Through the Bible Hallelujah you know the scripture that says the battle is not yours but it's the Lord's before you get to that scripture God said you're going to go through the battle but you're not going to fight just go there and worship go back and read it before they even fought the Battle Hallelujah they sent singers and worshippers out there first to prophesy the victory through music Hallelujah and sometimes the gifts in the church don't start operating till a good song is played yeah what do you mean that happened with the prophet Hallelujah the prophet was angry and he said bring me a Minstrel and when they brought the minist his gift start the working W so let's be careful how we judge things let's be careful with our attitudes concerning individual worship Hallelujah cuz David Hallelujah when he worshiped his worship was so powerful Hallelujah it drove off an evil spirit that God put on somebody that mean in that moment Hallelujah he was so much like God he could tell the spirit what to do through his Worship in one place God said you can over Oh my he said through the prophet you can overcome God I thought that's all I was going to get is a my ah my my my means I don't know if that's true my if you believed it you would have said amen let me address your mind all right God being overcome by a desperate believer we know the story of Jacob to Israel look at his attitude how do he overcome Hallelujah he started to wrestle with God and he said I'm not going to let you go until you bless me now he kept saying Turn Me Loose turn me loose he said no not until you bless me turn me loose turn me loose no not until you bless me turn me loose turn me loose no not until you bless me when did he turn him loose after he got the blessing so he overcame W that's what the prophet of God said the prophet God said he overcame God in that moment Hallelujah and that one ain't good enough for you let me keep going cuz I feel your thoughts Hallelujah some of you are in that in that message Zone I don't know did the prophet say that I don't know maybe your attitude the right mental attitude can even change God's mind for that moment hallelujah hallelujah you said oh my boy I feel the expectation in here Glory Hallelujah it's coming as a resistance but I feel it ah Hallelujah think about the church God comes to Hezekiah he say hey it's your time it's time to go life is over and then Hezekiah goes into prayer and he says God you know my heart you know my life I walked perfect before you now I need more more time and the prophet was walking out and the prophet spin back around and came back God said go tell Hezekiah I've given him 15 more years what look at his attitude hezekiah's attitude made God change his mind what about your attitude Hallelujah but Church like I say we was in a restaurant [Music] brother say oh brother DS I'm sorry I'm sorry brother di for the music pass Salt so Brother D I'm so sorry for the music you know that music is just you know I just come here to eat and you know the music is just so loud can you pass me the butter for my [Laughter] [Music] roll sometimes the things that's bothering you it'll get louder and louder you know why it gets louder because you're afraid it gets louder and louder Hallelujah but then he says Oh Brother D Brother D I'm so sorry the music is just out of control I say look brother this music is not bothering me it's bothering you I didn't have to overcome rock and roll I had to overcome R&B and rap now if this was Tupac it would be different right if if this was Mary J BL it'll be different but I don't know nothing about Van Halen and whoever it don't bother me so what I said is brother this ain't bother me it's bothering you and what we do all the time we go through things and we try to pull everybody else alone our trial brother ain't what Paul said Wednesday night didn't that bother you didn't that just bother you sister what happened in the church you know I don't you feel the same way I don't you feel the same way I feel trying to recruit people and bring everybody along with your thoughts that's a spirit on you if you got a problem stand alone and and and speak your mind don't try to gather whole church like a coward that's what's wrong with all the people that are leaving the message they can't leave quietly on their own they got to try to influence everybody else why cuz they don't believe in themselves they need a group of people to make them feel good in their imagination I told you i' take the leaks Hallelujah I didn't took him before a Leck is a Leck Hallelujah see I'm used the licks cuz my mama didn't Play Hallelujah I know what a lick feel like it hurt but it's there for your good Hallelujah but you know Church Hallelujah we'll go through things and we'll experience pain but we're not supposed to be running from it see real Deliverance you'll stand back and you'll look at it and say this what God brought me through and you'll look it in the face and you'll say you know what rock and roll you have no power over me Hallelujah I go sit right down in um I can't think of a restaurant that has a bar in it Hallelujah Applebees I go to sit right down in Applebees and order my chicken and fries and eat it and feel good about it and say oh that was nice Hallelujah with no temptation to go by the album of the word of music that I heard playing on that radio that's when you've overcome Hallelujah when you overcome you're not running from your imagination see your imagination creates things that are not even true people in their minds they go through things and they go through troubles and and Trauma uh in their lives oh my I feel like committing suicide that's a lying devil talking to you what is that that's fear that's the imagination of fear what have you done to Merit suicide nothing it's the enemy trying to pervert your pain when your pain should be there to make you stronger if I can cuz I'm feeling us you take a woman who who has a baby and she starts to go through postpartum depression stress look that shouldn't be happening right because the Bible there's no scripture for postpartum depression H the Bible says hallelujah when a woman is in travail Hallelujah she can experience the pain she experience the hurt the agony all the things she's going through while she's in travail but it's that travail that lets her know a birth is about to happen hallelujah it's the pain and all the things she's going through that let her know she's about to step into a new era of Life Hallelujah and he says what's the child is born she doesn't even remember the pain anymore Hallelujah now that's scripture you carried it for months and weeks after your child's been born that's a spirit on you and I say this morning that there's enough power one here because there's two or three of us that we can touch and degree and people can be delivered even the one you praying about can be delivered Hallelujah but let's look into it everybody all right now I can get into my message oh my I pull that first quote up I ain't going to be too much longer listen listen he says we always get what we expect when people expect anything well then they usually get what you look for it's the mental attitude that you have remember this remember this church remember this and never forget it the right mental attitude towards any promise of God will bring it to pass the right midle attitude towards any promise of God that I will you in your SE to think of a promise that you need from God and he says the right mental attitude of bring it to pass what does the right middle attitude look like you can take that down we're going to go back to John chapter 11 and I'm going hit this quick and I'm going get out the way cuz I believe you you you you understand what I'm talking about see the first part of the service was deliberately dealing with Spirits right right you know why because I've learned Hallelujah for people to get Deliverance you have to poke at the Devil you have to poke at him make him upset Hallelujah and let him know I see you you've been hiding and L your life too long but you spirit of fear today is your day to be conquered by faith usually demons like to hide they'll hide under good worship I've been I've been in Services where Hallelujah we've preached in this line of matter and they' come up to sing and the lead the one leading the songs were demon possessed but nobody knew it because she had a good voice but she had things in her life she was going through that didn't make her unbeliever that means that the word came to give her a cleansing oh my my alarm going off man how time flies when you're having fun am I all right there's a brother in Guyana South America when when when I'm preaching and I say hey I got to quit he say you haven't start yet brother Peter brother Peter say you haven't start yet preach the word hallelujah and in South Africa they say uh kubba da that means preach the gospel amen hallelujah so do I have time I need I need I need some evidence do I got time can I have about five more minutes anybody anybody can have about five more minutes 5 10 15 20 25 30 how I got oh but praise God I got a whole another hour it ain't my fault your people didn't now I know some of y'all want to go get that roast beef and them Donuts but listen let's look at the attitude of an overcomer first things first Christ always Hallelujah tries to get us to look at how he's thinking can I get Amen in any situation Hallelujah that we go through which may produce pain let's understand something about pain pain has a contrast to it there's a contrast to pain H pain is dead to bring forth a healing we use the term growing pains and all of us we had to grow into adults but growing into adults there was a lot of pain there was a lot of struggles some of us couldn't get our finances together some of us chose the wrong people when we were young we went through different things pain pain pain but it made us who we are hallelujah oh my you know what if I could say this what I'm tired of I'm tired of the enemy coming to trying to divide Us by our personalities the common goal is that we love Jesus Christ Hallelujah why should I look at you different because you're not as radical as me on you are on the inside though on the inside you like I can feel it Hallelujah because I'm not creating this atmosphere you are Hallelujah but what the flesh tries to do is say well this ain't God because you ain't on your feet that's a lie or you say this is God because you're on your feet that could be a lie and what the enemy see preachers shouldn't be coming try to separate us based upon our personalities because Peter and Paul were completely different but when they met they had the same goal which was the death Buri and resurrection of Jesus [Applause] Christ well well brother you know I love the way brother Paul said can you say Amen am man you know I got to get them back cuz when he preach a message he start shouting like me my this brother digs and then said somebody call him and show it to him see only a friend could do that he knew I wouldn't be offended so I called I said brother that message was good it was just one thing I didn't appreciate Hallelujah but friends can do that and not be offended Hallelujah and you think about how how how many times somebody has been your friend and they told you something you needed to hear you got offended and cut the Friendship off you weren really a friend you were an associate like I say a friend can stick with you through your good do your bad a friend can stick with you when you're going through some pain that they don't even have an answer for but what he can say is well even in this moment I'mma still be your friend what it is is in the message of the hour we got too many eleases in the church you know who he was he was Joe's buddy and when Jo start going through nobody had an answer but what happened to his message believing friends they turn their backs on him when it was God in the midst of the pain they had the wrong attitude oh my church let's let's let's look at it St John 11 are we all right oh my running out of time listen the Bible says in St John 11 this the story of Lazareth he says now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany in the town of Mary and her sister Martha Hallelujah now right now there's a loved one we know going through something and per se hallelujah what he's going through he's in Bethany Hallelujah but this there was some people there in Bethany that could call on Jesus right Hallelujah now I'm talking about about Brandon Hallelujah he's our loved one today Hallelujah and he's sick Hallelujah he's going through something but we are going to make a call for Jesus to come are you with me church not only brand it but there may be other situations in here see Hallelujah I'm I'm the kind of person I don't like to beat around the bush I like to be very direct if you have cancer let's deal with it you have high blood let's let's deal with it you got diabetes let's deal with it pornography stress Hallelujah whatever it is let's deal with it whatever your fear is today let's deal with [Applause] it cuz we're in Bethany and there's people in Bethany that Jesus loved hallelujah look it says and it was the Mary which Anointed The the Lord with ointment Hallelujah so the people who called upon God they called on him because they had an experience this this is their attitudes now Mary's attitude was look I know what God did for me let's call let's go find Jesus my brother sick let's go get GES I know what I was I was in prostitution hallu my life was messed up I had demons inside of me let's go get Jesus that was an attitude that was what the attitude of an overcomer look in that moment there was nobody reminding her of her past but everybody jumped right on board with the attitude of Faith say let's go get the Lord hallelujah that Mary who anointed the Lord ointment and wiped it his feet with a hair see Mary was the kind of person who knew what it was like to give God glory she wiped Hallelujah his feet with her hair Hallelujah and a woman's hair is her glory she gave God the glory Hallelujah and now she's giving it back in her actions you want to know how to get something from God give him glory he said whose brother Lazarus was sick let's keep going therefore his sisters sent unto him saying Lord Behold Him who thou love us is sick no doubt hle the people that we prayed for this morning or we put up we standing in the gap for those are people that God loves see I figure what we ought to do Josh is apply the word to the situation don't put your imaginary thoughts there Hallelujah let's apply the word let's apply reality there Hallelujah let's get the imagination out the way is God not a Healer yes he is a Healer is God a deliverer yes sometimes it takes pain for God to do something hallelujah what brought God to the children of Israel it was their cry it was their pain of being in bondage then Moses was born let's keep going when Jesus heard that he said the sickness is not unto death look what is he doing he's changing their attitude they look at they say my brother going to die he real sick he got Co people get on my nerves this Co stuff Co back Bo you know what the answer is to that if we got over it the first time we can get over it the second time and let me give you the real definition of Co a common Cod a common cold what turns it into a lung disease or or infection in the body whatever else your fears Hallelujah your imagination turning it into more than what it is hallelujah I give you a prime example my mom Hallelujah back when it was ring and raging she went to the hospital Hallelujah she said because she was dehydrated Hallelujah she was taking some medicine and the medicine was dehydrating her so she went to the hospital they said oh ma'am ma'am you got Co she said look I came here for a dehydration I didn't come here for no Co then they s the nurse in Hallelujah they s the nursing who look like her and talk like her and say oh oh mama call her my mama Mama oh Mama you know sometimes these things they're hard to receive and hard to you know just believe your body can go through this and it's hard to accept my mom was like hard to accept what that you have Co she said look girl I don't have no Co I came in here for dehydration and treat me for dehydration but y'all know the enemy he don't give up easy and no doubt she had some symptoms of pain but what was those symptoms there for the symptoms were there to challenge who she really was and what she really believed Hallelujah and sometimes you'll get in a moment where God is trying to make the real you come out then the dark that comes in he looks so professional and has all his charts and books and he starts to talk to her and calls her mother and all these things and and and looks at her and says you know you got it and she says got what you got Co she said look man I came in here for dehydration treat me for dehydration so I can go they were forced their hands were forced to treat her for what she said because what she said Hallelujah bound everything else that they were trying to give her her confession made everything else null and void Hallelujah her confession Hallelujah kept Hallelujah Co suppressed kept lung problems suppressed kept all the other sickness that comes with it suppressed why because of her confession her [Applause] attitude look he says he's trying to adjust the attitude said this sickness is not un to death but for the glory of God could you be going through a pain in your life why for the glory of God right it could be something that God wants to get Glory out of you how's he going to get it in that moment you just say thank you Jesus you just say Hallelujah Lord I give it to you right Lord my life belongs to you see what we fail to realize it's not up to us to heal ourselves it's up to him once you put him in position that savior God has to take it from you that's right Hallelujah it belongs to him once you say Lord I give it to you God says I accept Hallelujah but it's our attitudes Hallelujah he says but for the glory of God that the Son of God might be glorified thereby I'm a witness is of that I had something in my life that end up being the glory of God cancer in my brain H oh my but it took the word coming into my life so I could see it for what it really is the Devil comes he said oh you got cancer you going to die you going to be a vegetable and they were partly right I did die and I am a hot pepper for Jesus Christ Hallelujah w oh my look Church where I am right now because it's a product of my pain that God turned into his glory I would have never met him without the testimony of Jesus Christ in my life I would have never met you without the testimony of Jesus Christ in my life so God used that pain to bless you let's keep going amen now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazareth let's keep going when he had heard therefore that he was sick he Abode two days still in the same place where he was see Christ said you know what I'm going to see if they really believe in me I could come right away but you know what I'm going to take two days off and that's when our attitude start to get messed up when we feel like God is Not There he is he's just proving you he's just seeing what's really in your heart what he's doing he's giving you attitude of checkup and you know some of us we get we have a we start pouting God that's the worst thing you could do in my house if you was a child I tell you to do something and you go out the room stumping n she didn't get much of she the baby you know by the time the baby come you all soft and Doty you talking Morey instead of bringing more wrath you know and the other two are sitting there looking like you let her get away with that oh that couldn't have been me if I when I did that you did you did and I'm like hey one thing you got to realize I was learning with you guys Solomon he was learning with you Hallelujah was learning man don't take it personal he learn let's keep going then e he said unto his disciples let us go unto Judea again now he turns back and starts going back the other way right still ain't going to Bethany Oh my he said you know what we going to let this thing marinate to see what kind of attitude they got let's keep reading he said the disciples said unto him Master the Jews of late sought to Stone thee and goes therefore thei again let's keep going Jesus answered are there not 12 hours in a day if any man walk in the day he stumbleth not because he said the light of this world but if a man walk in the night he stumble because there is no light in him these things said he and after that he said unto them our friend Lazarus sleeping first of all what he did he had to deal with the attitudes of the disciples he's like if y'all go come with me your attitude got to be right they were walking in fear they were like Jesus we can't go back here remember they wanted to Stone you God wasn't afraid of that Hallelujah he was like I'mma go wherever I want to go because I'm God hallelujah and he's making them wait what he's doing he's getting everybody on the same page to overcome Hallelujah let's keep reading no no no right there right there he says our friend Lazarus sleepeth but I go that I may awake him out of the sleep hallu see Jesus his attitude he didn't even acknowledge he's trying to get them to see he's not dead he's just sleeping now if you sleep that mean you got to awake but the people wern't catching it h then he said to the disciples Lord he sleep shall he shall do well he said how be it Jesus speak of to death but they thought that he had spoken of taken of rest in sleep then said Jesus unto them plainly Lazarus is dead see they wern't catching it right yeah some of us are not catching it that what you going through is a blessing in disguise what you going through is that very thing that's going to make Christ come what you're going through is that very thing Hallelujah that pain is there to bring forth a joy Hallelujah that sickness is there to bring forth the healing Hallelujah that bondage is there to bring forth Liberty H that sadness is there to bring forth the joy there's a contrast to it Church let's go and I'm glad for you now look at God God saying I'm glad for your sake I'm glad for your sake that I wasn't there Hallelujah he wanted Lazarus to die just so he could show his power maybe he wanted you to lose that house just so he could give you a bigger one Hallelujah he wanted you to lose that car or whatever it is whatever you thought it was significant that you couldn't live without he wanted it to happen so you can see the glory of God he said for your sake that I was not there to the intent ye may believe these things are happening so God could make real Believers out of us nevertheless let us go unto him all right now said Thomas which is called Damas unto the fellowship let us also go that we may die with him then when Jesus came he found that he had laay in a grave for four days four days it seemed like it's irreversible it's been happening a long time you look at your loved one's life and they way out in the world they way out there but God let it go out there like that just to show you that once he get a line on you H he'll reel you back on in oh this is a big one oh it's coming back it's coming back you know what Jesus don't struggle like that he stands in one spot and you just come now Bethy was n unto Jerusalem about 15 forong off and many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary and comfort them concerning their brothers their brother see he's dead now everybody's coming there saying oh my your brother we understand my sister but that's the wrong attitude that's the wrong attitude they shouldn't be like Jesus on the way I heard he's almost here he's all the champion is almost here hallelujah the deliverer is almost here then Marth as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming went to meet him but Mary sit still in the house see Mary wasn't worried Mary was like whatever God going to do he going to do it Martha said let me go out and make sure that's him H then Martha comes out next verse look at her attitude I'm about to close now attitude of an overcomer now she's in pain her brother is dead but Christ is there amen and look at her attitude concerning Christ she says then Martha says unto Jesus Lord if thou had been here my brother had not died first of all she recognized that Christ had the power to stop death Hallelujah think about that she's putting Christ into position now look what her imagination is doing her imagination is producing something that's real it's presenting a reality Hallelujah to the situation if Christ Lord of you was here my brother had not have died why based upon their experience Jesus what about you today Hallelujah Christ is here if Christ is here that mean whatever you stand in need of can be a reality today let's go but I know now she's overcoming but I know that even now right now this very service right now not not not not Wednesday not next Sunday right now not the next big meeting right now she said Lord you been here it would happen but even so right now Hall look at what her attitude is doing Hallelujah her attitude is going to force Jesus hand to show them something her attitude Hallelujah is going to make Jesus to a place to where he can't constrain himself no more they may have never seen him in this kind of manner Hallelujah but the attitude are going to make them show him he's going to show them something that they never seen before H what happened the attitude brought it out H he she said whatsoever thou ask God God will give it thee H let's go Jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again look at her attitude mother said unto him I know I know that my brother shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day hold it right there see her attitude is like my brother's going to rise again because I've heard of the day of the resurrection and I know Hallelujah because my brother was a good guy he served the Lord filled with the spirit I know Hallelujah that the day of the Resurrection he's going to rise again look at her attitude her attitude made Jesus respond next verse Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection because you believe in the resurrection you Ain going to have to wait till that day come I'm going show you the resurrection right now Hallelujah Church her attitude took her to Calvary before Calvary ever happened Hallelujah and your attitude can take you to places Hallelujah before it even happened look Jesus hadn't died and went to the Cross yet the resurrection hadn't even touch took place but mother's attitude made it happen to them before Jesus ever died what is your attitude reflecting musicians come he says he belied that in me thou were dead yet shall they live next verse and whatsoever liveth and whosoever liveth and believe in me shall never die because believest thou this now he's saying believest thou this he said I am the Resurrection now I want you to believe this very moment she said unto him y Lord I believe that thou art the Christ the son of the Living God which should come into the world what she saying Lord show me the resurrection I believe show me healing show me Deliverance show me what real Joy looks like next verse and when she had said so she went her way she left it there with God she didn't fight with him and called Mary her sister secretly saying the Master's come now she goes to her sister and say Hey Joe we about to see something powerful ain't tell everybody else yeah there's a lot of people screaming maybe looking at the service but me and Joe we know we're about to see something powerful Hallelujah because we know what we're going through we know the pain Hallelujah that's going through hallu maybe me and Joe has touched and agreed and now we're looking for that God that we've touched and agreed upon to do what he said he would do the Masters come and call it for thee Hallelujah God is say hey I want you to be a witness of what's about to happen see Mary wasn't there but now mother comes and say hey God requesting that you come we need people with experience to be around when the dead is raised we need people with experience to be around Hallelujah when healing takes place we people would experience to realize what real Joy what real worship is like so Jesus called for Mary Hallelujah and as soon as she had heard she arose quickly and came Hallelujah let's not Slumber Hallelujah let's stand on our feet and get in God's presence if he's requested you Hallelujah it's time for you to give him the attention he deserves next verse now Jesus was not yet come into the town but was in that place where Martha met him the Jews then which were there with her in the house comfort her when they saw Mary that she rose up hastily and went out followed her saying she goeth into the grave to weep no uh-uh it was something mess about to happen happen hallelujah hallelujah they already cried Hallelujah they already wept but this time they go to the Grave they're going with the master Hallelujah this time they go back to that situation to pray about it they go with Jesus Hallelujah this time they go back they go with faith they going back with an attitude of reality that all things are possible right now it's time to overcome the grave Hallelujah when they went Bo ass before were crying they were weeping they s for Jesus now Jesus is here Jesus is here and what's your attitude next verse then when Mary was come where Jesus was and saw him she fell down at his feet what did she start to do she went back into what brought her Deliverance the first time W the prophet of God said you meet the same conditions you will get the same results Hallelujah and the last time she was down on her knees at Jesus feet Jesus changed her life so now she's falling back into that same action down at Jesus feet for what to change their life again so they see something they never seen before and then she said if thou has been here my brother had not died Mary and Martha are saying the same thing remember what we started with if two or [Music] three Hallelujah see that's what we must first realize this message of the hour Hallelujah is a product of the Bible right Hallelujah William bam is a product of the Bible he's a word Prophet amen every inspiration ties back into the word of God true inspiration that is Hallelujah and look he says Mary and Martha now they're touching and agreeing amen he said and the Jews also weeping which came with her he groaned in the spirit and was troubled Hallelujah why is he groaning Hallelujah because he's almost like I'm here and some of y'all don't have the right attitude why are you crying this should be a rejoicing he said I told you I've come that the glory of God may be magnified but the Jews are there weeping let's go and said where have you laid him they said unto to the Lord come and see now listen to the unbelief they say Jesus wept Oh my he said then he said the Jews behold now he he loves him next verse and some of them said come now this man which opened the eyes of the blind have caused that even this man should not have died Hallelujah now they trying to blame Jesus for the death but he already told him get your attitudes right I've come that you may see the glory of God he was supposed to die Jesus therefore again groaning in himself come to the Grave it was a cave and the stone laid upon it Jesus said take away the stone right now in the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ I'm saying to your life life take away the stone take away the depression take away the troubles take away the fear take away the things that's hindering your walk this morning Hallelujah take away the family issues Hallelujah take away all maners of unbelief why because the master is here now remember we're dealing with your attitudes now if the master was here would that's how you respond to him being here if you knew he was going to roll away the stone of your bondage if you knew he was going to roll away the stone Hallelujah that was holding you back from being in his presence will that be all you give God is a two single fingle hand clap our attitudes you know let's keep going he say back up back up listen to the unbelief even while Jesus is there by this time he stinketh he's supposed to [Music] be why you reading us cuz some of us got some real nasty stinky stuff in our lives stinky unbelief stinky fear stinky doubts we got a lot of stinky stuff in our lives and we don't want Christ to see it so we're trying to stop him from coming but no he ain't stopping he coming he going to deal with it hallelujah hallelujah that stench is drawing him right to you hallelujah how that stit is dead so that you can see the grace of God hallelujah Oh my he said but now he's stinking he said he said unto him by now this time he stinking for he had been dead four days Jesus said unto her said I not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou should see the glory of God God Church let your life if you were believed you would see the glory of God this morning Hallelujah let's go and they took away the Stone from the place where the dead was laid and Jesus lifted up his eyes and he said father I thank thee that thou has heard me oh my listen listen what is he doing he's speaking as a god we going to come back to that verse 42 Hallelujah bring up uh Ian bring up that next quote I'm about to close don't get nervous listen my yeah I like how y'all reading it before me go ahead and read it go ahead and read it amen then if Jesus defeated Satan upon the faith knowing who he was Hallelujah he was a predestinated creature are you ready are you ready he was a predestinated creature are you ready Hallelujah I ain't talking about you I'm talk I'm talking to the devil are you ready let's get

spirit's been given the Sea's been sold the evening light has been shining the sign of Sodom that Jesus promises here Malachi 4 a predestinated church Satan are you [Applause] ready he has to let go if you know who you are if your attitude is I'm a Child of God he has to let go he has to let go of your promises hallelujah what you're claiming Hallelujah is yours according to your attitude according to your attitude Hallelujah Satan can't stop it he said if Jesus defeated him by simply knowing who you are if you tap into the same inspiration Satan is also defeated he's also defeated right now if your attitude is Right Hallelujah the attitude of an overcomer this is the attitude of an overcomer yes sir Hallelujah to look at a situation and say when God comes it's over when God comes it's done true when God comes I don't have the fear anymore I'm no longer a slave to fear but I'm a Child of God right now this very moment Deliverance has come to let your [Music] life whatever
