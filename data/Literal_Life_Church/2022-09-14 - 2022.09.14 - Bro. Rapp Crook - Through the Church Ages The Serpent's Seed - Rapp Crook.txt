========================================

Lord willing tonight we're going to take a look at um the Bible's teaching on the serpent seed and to be honest is one of the tougher uh sessions for me to study for just because I can remember a couple of services growing up in the past couple years as I've heard from Brother Stephen strew and brother Jason demarius they just kind of hit the ball out of the ballpark um explaining and showing it from the scripture so I thought my I wish I could just kind of stream their service this evening but um we're not going to do that this evening we'll just see how the Lord will bring it this way but um my uh my goal tonight is just to kind of hopefully by God's grace to show that what we believe what brother Brandman has brought and restored to us it's a it's a Biblical teaching we've got a strong Foundation to stand upon and um and it's hard to see it in another way I just pray that God will open our eyes to to see that and and just bless uh bless my word as I try to explain it we'll take a look at Acts chapter 2 and verses 42 to 44. it says and they continued steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine and fellowship and in Breaking of bread and in prayers and fear Came Upon every soul and Many Wonders and signs were done by the apostles and all that believed were together and had all things in common I just love how that said now brother Paul brought it out that um all the noses are pointing in the same direction they had the same vision they weren't worried of anything else they didn't have misdemean today we are so attempted by materialistic values we want the biggest house the biggest car the biggest sister that they didn't care because they had a really Clear Vision this world's not my home I'm investing in the future that's out of this world and that they had that and the over and that acts uh um I think this must be at one of these scriptures wrong this would be Acts 2 I think um but in the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one Soul neither I said any of them that odd of the things which he possessed was his own nothing that I have is mine it's all given to me of God so if God wants to do something else with it it's God's priorities that's fine they had all things in common and notice God was with them he Vindicated them with great power he gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and great grave is upon them all this what wonderful signs that God is with them and you maybe see that we'll just ask the Lord the Lord's blessing here Heavenly Father we just pray that you would put a watch over my mouth I might say what's true and right and may we all be established in your truth tonight in Jesus name amen so the question I want to kind of start with we see so clearly that the church at Pentecost was established on a strong Foundation God was with them I mean they had all they had all things in common they were of one heart one Soul it says in Acts do they continue the apostles Doctrine they were in fellowshipping with one another it's also good but if we look in the Red Book of Revelation chapters 2 and 3 when John is prophetically describing the church that it's to come and the church ages you see something very very different and you got to wonder why because if the if the seed is planted perfectly in the book of Acts and it's showing such beautiful perfect fruit that's just like the seed that went in the ground just like Christ how did all these other attributes come to get involved that's not that wasn't part of the seed that was planted how did it get involved and we can kind of take a look at some of the characteristics in the Ephesian Church age um Jesus Christ recommend commends the church because they cannot bear them which are evil who say their Apostles and are not these are folks who Christ is calling evil but they're calling themselves part of the church and this just continues to grow and he says there's this group here that hates the Deeds of Nicolaitans here's a group that says they're part of the true church but that's showing a very different fruit than the seed that was planted yet they're identifying themselves as the true church how can this be and it just goes from bad to worse in Smyrna there's a group that says they're Jews which in the early church if you were a Jewish believer that you had special Insight perhaps into the Old Testament because you that that's what you grew up with he says they're not they're of the synagogue of Satan they don't they're they're they try to be with us but they're definitely not of us then finally in Smyrna I think it is they says there are those that among you that are not following in the apostles Doctrine as an Acts 2 or acts 4 but they're actually holding the doctrine of Balaam and we know in the Old Testament in the audience then would have known in the Old Testament the doctrine of Balaam brought nothing good forth how does this church that was planted and show such good fruit right at the beginning how is something so different coming up and it just continues in in the I think pergamus there's this woman Jezebel who's that the church is all suffering or is allowing to teach and further seduce my servants to commit fornication how can this be and it just continues on in in Sardis it says you have a few names who have not defiled their garments which means that defiled garments is the rule and the exceptionists they haven't defiled their garments how can this be because in the in Acts this was a church that was that was that was that was almost perfect it is beautiful yet in Ephesians chapter 5 Paul writes there is going to be a bride who is his garments are washed pure and white by the water of the word that that will be there but you see how you have both characteristics all intertwined and mixed throughout the church ages that's what we're seeing here and again uh um even in the Philadelphia nature is going to be them who who are of the synagogue of Satan that are they say they're part of the church but Christ says I'm going to make sure that these folks who are of the synagogue State and they are going to know who the real church is they're going to know that I loved you there'll be a Vindication of that little bride that's what's being referred to there and then finally and now this year there's this group that's lukewarm that says they're the church that says they're the bride of Christ yet he says I'm going to spew them out of my mouth so the way I show all this is how did this happen how can a church that began so well end so poorly how did it all go wrong because we could look at the fruits of this of this church and it's very very mixed and to understand the problem with the fruit we want to take a look and see where the what is the problem with the seed because it's very clear there's a problem with the fruit in the church here somewhere where did this come from and unfortunately the devil has worked very hard to hinder a clear understanding of the Fall the Fallen Eden and the fall also in the early church he's worked very hard to hinder this and a few years ago I was teaching an elementary Bible class and we were going through the Book of Genesis that would be a good idea to start in the Old Testament just go through Genesis and take him up probably to the Book of Exodus and with the days of creation that was all nice and then before I knew I was going to teach the fall I thought man how am I going to teach the story of the Fall to these little to these little little first and secondly six seven and eight-year-olds and that class I gained a great appreciation for the symbolism used in the Bible because you know what those little Sunday school books they meet the kids on that level and the kids can get everything they need to know at that age from the story about Eve eating a forbidden fruit and there being punishment for it that's great at that age but you know what the devil wants everybody to stay with that understanding but as we grow older there's a there's a lot more in that story it's a it's an allegory we'll look at it tonight packed full with meaning and as you start pulling back layers of the meaning the story becomes much more meaningful to us as we get older and as we grow up we can let scripture we'll do that tonight let scripture interpret scripture and we'll see that there's a lot more going on in this and why is the devil hindered an understanding of the Fall so clearly as we come out of this this Bible story in Genesis that you tell the little six seven eight-year-olds it's very clear you get to Genesis 3 15. there's a punishment and there's there's a promise and you can tell the kids Jesus that that God is promising adds me that there's going to come an offspring later the seat of the woman is going to bruise the Serpent's head and he's going to bruise Satan there on the cross and Christ is going to be the Victor he's going to be our our champion he's the hero of the story and that's true so the in this little Sunday school version the hero is very clear but the villain kind of remains foggy and I would say it's the to the villains benefit that his identity and the way that he works kind of remains foggy he's happy everybody that's given the idea of the story general idea but not too many of the specifics because if you get the specifics you'll see how he works in our lives how he's worked every single Church age and how he's working today he just want us to see that he wants to keep our understanding basic so when we peel back the the meaning here and look at this scene more clearly the seed story more clearly we'll also see how terrible sin is it's not just an arbitrary eating of just some apple that you were told not to touch and then everything goes downhill from there let me talk about the the sin that we'll talk about tonight that affects every area of your life affects every relationship that's involved it poisons everything and Satan doesn't want you to look at sin that way Satan one looks you said why does God say you can't do that what a ridiculous rule come on but when you can see what's being talked about wow sin is serious but Satan I want you to see sin is serious sin looks like why is god making a rule about that um and you'll also see we see what the sin was how it affected everything what the graciousness of God the love of God nothing could keep him from coming down on the scene rolling up his arms and trying to deal with this problem and to and work in redeeming love for his children so when we see what the sin was what we see who the villain was what the deed was we gained such an appreciation for how terrible sin is how terrible our enemy is and how great our God is so we'll just start off with the uh the uh the question if you look in your Sunday school books and things Ebates and apple or some other fruit but that begs the question what's wrong with eating an apple what's wrong with that um and you could if you just take the story of the fall at face value it seems like God sets up an arbitrary rule that there's all these fruit trees in the garden you guys can eat all of them that you want except that apple tree back there don't touch that and I just kind of thinking about it it'd be like me setting out 10 cookies on the counter okay Sophie you can have all nine of these cookies but don't dare touch this 10th cookie it's like why am I doing that I mean there's what's the point of the Rolex of just this is just a test of this kid's obedience but would we do that as parents if we're going to make a rule there's going to be a purpose for it it's not just to have a gotcha moment I knew you were going to do that so whack and here you've got this arbitrary Rule and the most Draconian of punishments I mean it's not like you eat that cookie and you're going to be in the corner for 10 minutes no you eat the cookie I'm going to kick out of my house I mean it's just that doesn't make sense I mean what kind of parent would do that you wouldn't and God wouldn't either there's more going on here than just eating this this particular fruit so the Bible doesn't show God's character to be this way so I'd suggest there's more to the story than that and Jesus indicates that it's not eating that causes someone to be unclean the disciples were given this question by the Pharisees the Pharisees say your disciples eat with unwashing hands oh that's bad but Jesus says here understand it's not that which goes into the mouth that defiles a man but that which comes out that defiles a man and this this teach this this truth here in Matthew kind of pulls the rug under from the Sunday School interpretation it's not just this eating of something that that that's defiling but it's that which comes out of the mouth that comes from the heart that's able to defile a man and so we're going to take a look perhaps in the Genesis chapter two it's on page two in our notes um here um God is uh it's described out of this is Genesis 2 verse 9. out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that's Pleasant to the site and good for food and I just want to point out there's a semicolon there every tree that's good for food that's Pleasant to the site they're all growing out of the ground here they are and then the tree of life was also in the midst of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil so it's this setup as being two different categories of two different categories of trees and then the Lord commanded the man in verse 16 of every tree of the garden you may freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil you won't eat everything you shouldn't eat of that one for the day you eat thereof you will surely die again this is a different kind of fruit also because it's a little banana peaches are going to have that effect this is a different kind of fruit it's mentioned in a different category it's it's different than the one that is naturally Pleasant to the site and good for food now the fruit from this tree of knowledge of Good and Evil you can learn that it's Pleasant to the eye you can learn that's plus the site you can learn that it's good for food but that's not what you grow up seeing right away it's not naturally that way you you you learn that and there's we'll take a look at some of the symbolism that's used in the story we have trees there's Gardens the fruit even the very active eating all of these can be used metaphorically it means they have a double meaning well first off take a look at trees in the Bible trees can speak of persons it's not just going to be speaking of um a bark covered uh living organism with leaves that practice photosynthesis and bears fruits and things like that it can be more than that but first let's just take a look in Revelation 2 7 it's here on the screen if we were to say that the tree of life is a literal tree in the Garden of Eden the tree of knowledge would be a literal tree in the Garden of Eden the way it's referred to in Revelation 2 7 is interesting because it says he the hath and you let them hear what the spirit says to the churches to him who overcomes will I give to eat of the Tree of Life if it were a literal tree we would expect to be able to find it somewhere there in the middle of East there in the Middle East where it was planted in the Garden of Eden if it were a literal tree we would expect to find it there but it's not there it's in the midst of the paradise of God so this tree of life is something more than that and there are lots of symbolisms uh there are multiple references to um to Christ being the source of Life what is the what is the Tree of Life and it's interesting there's a people all want to people throughout history if one defined the uh um the uh the the the elixir of life or this this tree of life or this this this this well we have this this water that would make them forever uh forever healthy but it's not here on Earth it's not a literal thing it's something that the soul desire is for there's only one source of that and Jesus says if you don't come to me you won't have life you won't you should you should come to me to have life she says I'm the bread of life I'm the way the truth the life first John this is the record that God God has given us eternal life and this life is in his son so where can we find eternal life where can we find life it's in Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is that tree of life and other other examples in the Bible where trees can symbolize persons and Psalm 1 blessed is the man who walketh not in the Council of the ungodly or stands in the way of Sinners nor sits in the seat of the scornful but um he'll be like a tree planted by the rivers of water now does that mean that because Brother Paul's walking with the Lord so well we only have for a few years longer and he'll be putting down some roots and stretching forth branches it doesn't mean that but there's a continuousness to a a fruitfulness this is this is a comparison and Daniel chapter 4 and Nebuchadnezzar has a dream and he's grown so mighty in this he's been he's this great tree and this tree and the dream symbolizes Nebuchadnezzar he's not literally a tree but this is a tree can stand for a person in Judges chapter nine Gideon's son abimelech is having a a big discussion um with the men of shechem and he starts giving him what for and he tells them this whole Parable where this Bramble Bush came and beat up these uh these these olive trees because the olive trees weren't doing what they were supposed to be doing and every all the trees are meant to are symbolizing actual characters they're in the story um in Matthew chapter 3 the religious leaders are very proud that we are sons of Abraham they said to John the Baptist why do we need to repent and um John the Baptist says I've come to lay the ACT to the root of all the trees so this is they're looking a family tree right this is they say we're you're justification your spiritual standing is not a matter of your family tree I'm coming to lay the root to all of them so you can have a born-again experience and be born from above that's what John the Baptist is teaching so the Tree of Life brother Branham says just like the Bible points out the tree of life is a person so he says the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil is a person also it can be otherwise it's consistent thus the righteous one and the wicked one he says stood side by side there in the midst of the Garden of Eden he quotes from Ezekiel 28 13 thou Satan has been in Eden the Garden of God so there in the they're in the Garden of Eden Christ is there and Satan is there also and they have a choice Adam and Eve have a choice what will they um what will they be doing and there's a uh there's a there's some copies of attract by Brother Jason demarris um on the on the mystery of the seat of the serpent revealed it's back on the back on the table by the tithe and offering envelopes but he also points out how and uh in each in each one one of us we can look at ourselves the a garden it can be some a bride is often symbolized as a garden in the scripture look at the Song of Solomon I've got scriptures here for that it says let my beloved come into his garden and eat his Pleasant fruit It's a Wonderful metaphor but he's not talking about eating an apple or eating a pear um so this this this metaphor of a of a garden that's speaking of the bride's body um her body can also be depicted as as Choice fruits and then these sexual relations that are beautifully described in the Song of Solomon that's carried with a metaphor of of eating and um say uh you've got my beloveds and he is my beloved is mine he feeds among the lilies he's not having a barbecue Down by the Riverside this is a much more romantic a much more romantic thing and um so in gardens fruit the act of eating they're all used as metaphors for sexual relations in proverbs 30 20 it says it really clearly this is the way of an adulterous woman she eats she wipes her mouth and says I've done no wickedness it's clear here they're using this eating metaphor it's clearly interpreted clearly accepted that we can use the Bible to interpret the Bible there's an active eating that takes place here in the Book of Genesis and this is a different sort of tree it's a different sort of fruit and what follows from it it's very lead us to believe that yeah something else happened my dad just telling me on the way up today he was at the soup kitchen and some lady comes in and said and this is a non-believer she just comes in and asks so what do you think happened there in the Garden of Eden why is it talking about the serpent having a seed and does this all come from an apple and dad says well how do children come about today and it doesn't it's common sense you almost would think but if if you if you have the the the layers of kind of religiosity that are in and tradition peeled off then you can see it and and it's there Psalm 128 verse 3 talks about your wife can be like a fruitful Vine they talk about a wife could be like it like like a tree the symbolism is there and what and this is a tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and you can think about sexual relations as they're described in the Song of Solomon it's beautiful he has lyric poetry says oh it's described as a beautiful thing and sexual relations and a good marriage are a beautiful thing but what can be so intensely joyous and just as much intensely tragic as sexual relations take a look at the take a look at the story of and I believe I'm preaching from and when they're they're when amnon goes and rapes Tamar it's a terrible thing a terrible thing and you don't have to look very far nowadays folks just take a look what's going on in children's services today and opioid epidemic with all kinds of dysfunctional families and children Satan is trying to sell this fruit the way he sold in the Garden of Eden promising It's a Wonderful it's a joyous thing um and people go and eat of that fruit and all that they get is the tragic of the fruit it's a tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil he promises the good but if you get it outside of God's program all you get is the tragic evil what else is so intensely good and intensely tried can be so intensely tragic at the same time this fruit it's there it's it's a sexual act that's performed outside of God's will so we can we can see that it's it's kind of like this let's go over to Genesis chapter 3. I'm getting enough comments but but it's nice to kind of see what the Bible says here Genesis 3 and verse 5. verse 1. now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made notice he's not being described as a Slytherin creeping thing he's being described as a beast of the field that's that's subtle so in his in his reasoning capabilities he's a he's a it's at a completely different level and we're impressed now when you can train uh you go to the zoo in Fort Wayne Zoo I think he can there are monkeys who are trained to go and crack so many knots into particular spots and reward kind of man those are smart monkeys it's amazing but the serpent of those guys beat by a long shot his his reasoning capability is just amazing because he's able to speak also now this isn't something that he just that the Devil comes into him and all of a sudden he begins to speak because that would kind of be creepy to the woman why he wasn't talking yesterday and all of us he says how are you this morning that'd be weird but this is something that this is completely normal to have a this this creature we've been working together for and he's always talk it's all that they knew it was her her alarm balance didn't go off at all he just starts talking to her one day and starts leading her in a conversation down the way that she'd really never been LED before and he says you know did God really say you shouldn't eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said to the serpent now we can eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God said You shall eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest ye die and the servant oh you won't he won't surely die will you he's just gradually planting seeds of doubt and she just gradually listening listening listening there on their own and then he goes on God knows that in the day you're going to eat thereof your eyes will be opened you'll be as Gods knowing good and evil why wouldn't God want you to know good and evil why wouldn't God want you to have pleasure he made you this way why wouldn't God why would he want to withhold that from you we love each other and this is something that's perfectly acceptable for people who love each other this is fine we we desire it so that's how he speaks to us today if if you have love for one another sex is great if you have love for one another but if you don't have love for one another and you're just doing it just to have a good time then that's a different class altogether that's how he justifies today it's a serpent talking why would God want to withhold something so good from you and she just keeps listening and listening and notice all the other trees of the garden she knew they grew out of the ground they were good for food they were pleasant to the eyes she knew that she'd not have anybody she didn't need anybody to tell her that they were that way but only by listening to the serpent for a long time does she come to see that there is another tree that is also Pleasant to the eyes that is also good for good for food she didn't see that she learned that that wasn't self-evident or she learned that and I don't know what what how we told it all together but we see finally it was pleasant to be desired and then she finally took it ate it and then they she gave to her husband with her and he did eat and then it says the eyes of them both then were opened they knew they were naked and brother Branham says if it was just a natural piece of fruit then we should pass those around because we never would let people know that they were a naked day that that'd be a really good thing to know but this that just it's not a natural piece of fruit that gives you that message there's something more that gives you realizes your sense of Shame their your sense of desire for modesty there's something else there that awakens that and they all right right right right away they want to sew fig leaves together and make them aprons why why to cover their shame or the bread and because this is an example of the first religious system trying to solve your own problem trying to give Redemption for your own need there on your own and then when they heard the voice of the Lord God Walked In the Garden in the cool of the Dead this is what this was something they would have been looking forward to every evening the communion with uh with Father God as he kind of takes him to bed and Tucks him in tells him a bedtime story talks men for good night and now they're running from it Everything Has Changed notice how this particular sin affects everything it's not just I tell Sophie don't eat that 10th cookie she eats it and then that that makes the whole house turn upside it's not that it's something so much more and if you can look when somebody commits adultery in the family that turns the house upside down that makes even the littlest thing combustible anything could be it could lead to an explosion that's the kind of thing all of a sudden God's oh no we got to get out of here everything becomes different here so um when we so there there was an act here let's just keep on going um I'm going to run too far ahead of myself so the Lord God comes down and he calls into Adam verse 9 he says where are you he said I I heard your voice in the garden I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself and good question who told you that you were naked did you eat of that tree that I told you that you shouldn't eat from and Adam points right away he doesn't point to that tree way over there where the apples hang off his as he points right to the woman and he says the woman gave this to me he's kind of pointing to a tree just a different one he says the woman that you gave me she gave me to eat of this uh of this tree and I did this it just when When sin starts the blame game starts right away I mean even as guy as as Adam is answering God's question he says the woman but he's pointing his finger at the woman because the woman that you gave me it's God's fault here too that all of this happened no no no taking uh responsibility for himself and he asked the woman he didn't he doesn't ask what did you eat his what have you done it's a different kind of a question and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and I did eat and beguiled that's a that that's a strong word all of these words have particular connotations that that that speak of a sec of of of a sexual seduction they're all there and it's beautiful because you can teach us as a Sunday School Story and you can teach it just fine but you don't stay there because if you stay there you're missing so much you don't see how the devil works you don't see how who your enemy really is and he loves that he doesn't want you to see how he works he wants to keep you in the fog but it's all there and then it's interesting as it just goes on he's going to punish uh there's there's consequences for this and he he curses the uh he curses the the serpent let's just see um how how which one is cursed let's see here um in verse 14 the Lord God said unto the serpent he hasn't asked the servant what he did the serpent knows full well what he did he says watch you because you have done this and notice he doesn't say it because you've eaten this he says because you've done this you're cursed above all cattle above every beast of the field upon your belly you shall go so he's not when when when he's speaking when the serpent is speaking to to Eve there he's not on his belly then because he's cursed to his belly he's on he's on his two feet standing upright and dust shall you eat all the days of thy life what was the the the the the initial part of the sin that the serpent began with the sin of Seduction with his mouth and he and part of the curse is that Serpent's Tongue is cloven in half he's not going to be able to talk again it matches where part of the sin was committed and then in verse 15 I'll put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed or between thy Offspring and her seed or her offspring and you just kind of if you're just reading this in the from the from the Sunday School Story why is God talking about the serpent having an offspring and the woman having an offspring it's like this comes out of left field if you're reading it from this Sunday school book where did this come from why is it talking don't eat from this fruit of this tree or that tree and you did this and I'm going to be cursing you here because you didn't and then your Offspring and his offspring there's going to be enmity between them where does that come from well if you look at the back story we can see it there was an act there wasn't a there was a beguiling there was only a sexual act an adulterous act and there was a pregnancy there was something going on and Eve's body already that she might not have understood but God already saw and Adam came to understand also and then the woman he says I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception what why this would seem so Random if I'm just eating an apple then I'm going to give you sorrow in your monthly where does that come from but it makes sense if you're looking the there's a there's there's a sexual act that's that's done is God's talking of Offspring and then the next thing she's the next nine months for for her are going to be very difficult and he's telling her why because you've gone about you've eaten from the Tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil instead of doing it in the confines of how I wanted you to enjoy this fruit you could have eaten from the tree of life but you didn't you went from the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and there's a there's an unfortunate price to pay for that and Adam is cursed in verse 17 in the act of seed sowing the thought he'll have to labor to bring forth and and support his family and I think it's also ironic in verse 20. he said and Adam called his wife's name Eve because she was the mother of all living mother where are the kids there aren't any kids walking around here yet why would there already be speaking of a mother of all living Adam understands she's with child she's going to be the mother and she's the mother of both of them she's the mother of all living I'm the father of one of them I'm not the father of both of them but she's the mother of all living these are just kind of random why is God speaking of Offspring why is Adam speaking of Offspring when in Genesis 4 in the Sunday school version this is the first time when we see Adam knowing having carnal knowledge of his wife but no this is kind of summarizing what had already happened because it already happened in chapter three but they're already speaking about it in chapter three of Offspring coming and Eve being the mother of all living it's there it's there and Paul speaks about it like this also in second Corinthians chapter 11 he is the he's he's he's he's he's leading this this early church and he wants to present this early church he wants to present as a as he realizes this is Christ's bride and he says I'm jealous over you with Godly jealousy for I have espoused you to one husband there is an engagement here you are reserved for one another I'm jealous because I want to present you as a chaste virgin a pure virgin who knows none other but her intended bridegroom that's how I want to work with you but I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety that your minds will also be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ Paul is using these same metaphors that are filled with connections to to sexual relations they're there he wants a a pure Bride for Christ he doesn't want the serpent to come back again because you know the serpent wants the devil wants to keep his identity his work his ways of working foggy but Paul's trying to pull back the mask this is how the devil works this is your enemy he might come to you like an angel of Light speaking of the most beautiful things it's how we came into even it's how he comes every time and I want to I'm laboring so that you won't accept his lies like Eve did because corruption begins here you accept his thoughts and it goes deeper and deeper I don't want that I don't want you to be beguiled as the serpent was as as the serpent did are we together so we can see these questions why in Genesis 3 15 was God speaking at both The Serpent and Eve having Offspring why is Adam calling even mother when she has no children because she was with child and that was clear and God was warning her the next nine months you're going to have sorrow with your and all of this that's that's just part of it now because it's the knowledge of Good and Evil and it's interesting um the the situation that's described where you have a woman pregnant um with with twins from two different fathers it's a rare case and we see it right there in the Book of Genesis but um here's just a situation that CBS News covered some years back The Strange Case of twins with two different fathers that could be the subtitle of Genesis chapter three but it is a that's that's what it was it says in the case that sounds more like the makings of a daytime TV talk show than the real life Court proceeding in New Jersey judge ruled that twin girls were fathered by two different men the story began to unfold when the woman sought child support payments from a man she claimed was responsible for her pregnancy and according to a report at the New Jersey Law Journal a DNA test was ordered by the Passaic County Board of Social Services which found that the mother's eggs had been fertilized by a sperm from two different men happens today it's possible and it happened happened then as well and what you what we can see here we have the the the Bible genealogies bear this out so if you're having a genealogical family tree I was doing this job has got inspired the other day and he was making a family tree genealogy who's asking who uh how how do you spell the the parents names of of Grandpa and Grandma and the great grandparents who we were doing all that and um so and so and then they've got the child and so on so here God was the uh was the father of of Adam he made Adam and Eve and then their first son was was able and the none of the genealogies will we ever see that Adam begat Kane whereas Cain was the firstborn son and he's there and even when there's a situation where a firstborn son is being judged for something for sure of some sin that he did for example Reuben um is he loses the right to the firstborn later but he's still named as the firstborn of Jacob even though the firstborn promise I think goes to Judah um but he's still named he's not kicked out of the family tree but Cain he's not kicked out of the family he just never was in the family tree and he's never mentioned there so um you've got um after uh after the the murder of of Cain and Abel of after Kane's murder of Abel and just think what what the dysfunctional family Gods was it didn't take that long and there was already adultery in the family already a murder in the family if anybody had skeletons in their closet God's first family did I mean every family has them but one of the things I I I've come to appreciate about understanding the serpent seed is that God's Not Afraid of dysfunction he's not going to say oh there's a dysfunction in this family I got to put this family this particular person in quarantine so they don't infect the rest of them he doesn't do that he doesn't look at this function like oh there's leprosy I better be careful not to get around that person too much because I'm a holy God and if I'm around them too much I will become less holy he doesn't do that God he Embraces dysfunction because he realizes only by my love can that dysfunction become become redeemed God doesn't run from it God doesn't run from all of us have skeletons in our closet Alders were all tainted by the fall and when and we can be encouraged when the first family was tainted by the Fall brother Graham says God came running and screaming from Heaven Adam Adam where are you he doesn't give Adam the cold shoulder we give each other the cold shoulder sometime we might give each other the silent treatment sometime but God doesn't God goes right down there and he gets in and pulls up his sleeves and we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna help this he gives a picture of redemption he goes and kills the innocent lamb foreshadowing Christ or there on the cross he slays them they try to take care of their their own Redemption by getting fig leaves God throw those things away all of our attempts to to cover for ourselves they're so they're so shameful he takes these bloody skins wraps them around and as and as they head out of Eden they've got these bloody reminders that something has died for me my sin was so terrible but God's love was so much greater he died for me and redeemed me So Adam is murdered by uh sorry Abel is murdered by Cain but the Genesis 4 25 says Adam knew his wife again and she bear his son and called his name Abel and called his name Seth for God Seth she hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel whom Cain flew so we can see then that Seth comes in this line and he is the replacement of Abel there's not more seed but it's not more seed that's not what the Bible says because Abel's gone Cain left I didn't have a child give me it's more no it's another seed Seth is replacing Abel's spot there and then the genealogies in Luke and Luke's genealogy worked backwards from Jesus Christ and it goes back with Christ's Earthly genealogy through Joseph I believe and it goes all the way back and says so so and so who was the son of Enos who was the son of Seth who was the son of Adam who was the son of God and what an awesome genealogy Adam has he can go straight to God but you know what that's what God wants to restore us to by being born again we can point hey I don't my Earthly genealogy I really don't not too concerned about that I can go straight to God God's my father and then Genesis 5 3 Adam lived 130 years and notice how this is phrased he began a son in his own likeness after his image and called his name Seth nowhere does it say that Cain was in his own likeness or was in his own image no that's what Seth was because Seth was Adam's son Cain wasn't if we look at page four on our handout King's genealogy is nowhere found with Adams but we can find different hints in the Bible where he came from in First John 3 12. says Cain was of that Wicked one Who Dares how dare somebody call Adam the father of Cain Adam was the son of God not of that Wicked one and then in Revelation 12 9 it just as interesting The Book of Revelation in the Book of Genesis shed the most light here talk about the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent the devil and Satan how much clearer do we need to be who the serpent was that old serpent the devil Satan who deceives the whole world he started out deceiving in Eden he's still doing it today so Cain's genealogy is tied up with the serpent the devil the dragon the wicked one and uh in his uh track brother Jason Demars refers to um um how the um some Jewish the Jewish tradition he says um um they refer to they assert that Adam was not the father of Cain rather Eve was subject to adultery having been seduced by the serpent in the Garden of Eden or the Devil Himself so there is um there is aspects of Jewish tradition that hold to that as well and even the in church history tertullian uh talks about uses uses the same kind of metaphors and suggesting that Eve was also impregnated by uh the serpent also or by the devil so the same it's a similar Point here so we take these literal genealogies throughout the Bible if we take them at face value and interpret them as the accountant Genesis would suggesting to be interpreted in Genesis chapter 6 we see the sons of God seeing the daughters of men that they're fair and they're taking wives and here you see Seth's line those are the sons of God because as soon as the sons of God as soon as Seth has children then then it's called the sons of God they begin to call the name of the Lord that's a clear characteristic of God's children their calling upon God's name but then at a certain point the sons of God start seeing how beautiful the daughters of men are that'd be Keynes line and then the lion starts to intermix and that was the devil's goal that was the devil's goal because he knows um he knows that God's goal was to have what what was to see man as his Temple and be enthroned upon this Temple and ever since Lucifer was in heaven Lucifer wanted to be seated there at the most high wanted to be on God's throne and he got kicked out of heaven for doing for for trying him that was his goal he's kicked down to uh to Earth there and he tries to do that he's doing the same thing there in the Garden of Eden he he knows God wants to Tabernacle these Earthly human beings he wants to be he wants them to be his Temple and he says no I'm going to beat him to it I want to be I want to be Lord of that Temple and a second Thessalonians talks about how the Antichrist he wants to sit in the temple of God showing himself that he is God that's what he's still trying to do in this Temple of our souls that that is his goal um let's take a look um in the message power of Transformations it's a October of 1963. brother branham's on the road and he says when I go home this time for after this trip I'm going to preach on the subject the trail of the serpent the beast at the beginning the beast at the end and Trail him right through the Bible and show how he heads up and just watch how cunning that fellow is that just like Judas and Jesus there both brothers in their tribe just like Esau and Jacob and everything is a twin and this great Warfare that we're in and it just he never preached that sermon he died first but you can still go through the message and it's all there you can see how the the trail of the serpents going throughout the scriptures going throughout church history going throughout he's still working the same way and in the in the in the church age book brother Brandon keeps keeps showing us that um that you have that false flying that True Vine both growing together he says we talked about that one or two sessions ago so this is a great truth slightly less glorious truth but still a great truth I hope you'll capitalize on what he says do capitalize on them because we can see the false fine it gets so discouraged and throw the baby out with the bath water it's all that way but no there's a mystery there there's two Vines growing there together and the devil tries to get them to be so intertwined like they were in the Garden of Eden so intertwined that if you're good to touch one you really can't be certain which one you're touching that's what he that's what he wants to do to try to deceive and in the Ephesian Church age it says the religion and the spiritual world are made of those two trees which had their roots and Eden it's still that way both the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil they both stood in the midst of the garden and no doubt their very branches intertwined each other thus in the Ephesian church is that same Paradox so way back there in the early church a very short period after Pentecost the false Vine got to intertwine itself around the True Vine and we see those deeds of the Nicolaitans that's what we read in the book of Acts the book of Acts you see just the Tree of Life shooting forth and how beautiful that fruit is but very quickly after that in the Ephesian age smarten age pergaming age further you see all these other things cropping up how did that get there and that's I think one of the significances of uh the serpent Seed doctrine the new their new testament passages that also refer um to this idea of other being two seed lines and as we kind of try to wrap this up um we'll take a look at First John 3 Verses 9 through 12. this I think it's probably bottom of page four um whosoever is born of God does not commit sin for his seed remains in him and he can't sin because he's born of God in this the children of God are manifest and the children of the devil the children of God and the children of the devil I just want to give a step back and give a copy I don't believe that you can go through and take a DNA test that well this particular person based on their DNA this is seed of God and this particular person oh their DNA their blood testures and their seat of serpent it's not a physical thing if it were a physical thing that all these sons of Abraham and the Pharisees say were of the seat of Abraham they had their genealogies they could show it and prove it so if it were a physical thing then they would be in if it were a physical thing and get two Believers and it's just they have a child they're in they have a child they're in but it's not it's very clear you have to be born again so it's not a physical seed we're all so our flesh is Just Junk because the devil polluted it we're all that way we're all in need of a savior we're all in need of being revived we all need that it's not a physical thing by any means at all some people try to twist the stocks and make it say something that it doesn't say in Matthew 13 it's interesting Jesus teaches the same thing and the misters of the Kingdom he says the field is the world The Good Seed is he's interpreting us to the disciples are the children of the Kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one or who was the first tear of the wicked one well Cain was of that Wicked one there are many others who have been sown by this wicked one the enemy who sowed them is the devil Jesus we're not reading too much into this to say that Jesus Christ is kind of teaching a form of what happened in the Garden of Eden here how did it get this way and I love John chapter 8. Jesus speaks to the Pharisees and they they've he's been speaking to them and they say unto him Abraham is our father we're good but Jesus says if you were Abraham's children you would do the works of Abraham but now you seek to kill me and Abraham didn't try to do that who did try to do that first you do the Deeds of your father and they know what he's talking about they don't say no we are he said we weren't born a fornication what a weird thing to throw in there I mean it's like somebody's been caught doing something wrong at school and says I wasn't born no it doesn't it doesn't fit but the Pharisees know what Jesus is talking about you do the Deeds of your father you seek to kill me who is the first murderer what is he telling him they knew what he was talking about we're not born of fornication we have one father even God if God were your father Jesus says you would love me for I proceeded forth and came from God neither can I have myself but he sent me why don't you understand my speech it's because you don't want to understand my speech you cannot hear my wordy because you are of your father the devil wow this is strong language but it's all pointing right back where was the devil doing fathering it goes back to Eden where was there an act of fornication an act of illness is sexual relations it was back in the Garden of Eden and that goes right through and Jesus is highlighting it you are of your father the devil he was a murderer from the beginning he's saying you're a Cain's kids that's what he's saying you're not of Abraham you're Cain's kids he Abode not in the truth because there's no truth in him when he speaks of a lie he speaks of his own he's a liar and the father of it and you're his kids wow did the religious leaders but he's telling him this because there's there's a truth and man think about John the Baptist he he all these religious leaders come to him as he's baptized and he says you Generation of Vipers what are vipers they're snakes talking about Generations it's Offspring he's Jesus says here in Matthew 23 33 you serpents you Generation of Vipers how can you escape the damnation of hell it's there if you let scripture interpret scripture you can see that it's there there are twins throughout the scripture and in the last days Church where the branches there's always twins the church in the last days there's going to be twins and on the top of page six I believe it is I made a a list it's probably not exhaustive but I tried to find I think this is from the um no I've done my notes now um uh two messages for brother Bramley starts listing him out I can't remember him now but Luther and Michael we're we're twins they're in there they're in heaven can't enable you have the daughter of men the sons of God lot and Abraham a lot of desire for asandom Abram was going the other way Ishmael and Isaac God's and there uh Abraham and Sarah they had the promise but there's twins being born right from where the promise was was given um Jacob and Esau being twins one has a desire for truth the other one doesn't brother Bram talks about Korah and Moses being twins both men who were anointed do certain things but leading different way um Moab and Israel Balaam is being a lead of a leader of one set of of the false twin Israel going the right way there was ahab's school of the prophets 400 of them then Makai the prophet um the Pharisees John the Baptist go all the way through and even at the last days the Antichrist and the Holy Spirit will be so like each other that they deceived the very elect if it were possible Twins and if you don't really know them really well you'll get the names mixed up and that's how he says in the last days it would be it's been twins all along even the Holy Spirit and the Antichrist will be twins so close it will deceive the very elect if it were possible so just in the in conclusion brother Michael if you want to you want to come um I like to ask the so what question of what what is the significance of the serpency doctrine why is it so important we don't want to just have something that was oh this is deep I've got inner better knowledge than somebody else does it just Puffs us up it's this isn't something to Puff ourselves up it's something actually quite humbling we see how rotten we are I say the serpent C Doctrine gives a clear understanding of the first promise of redemption it without the doctrine of the serpent seed we have a story with a clear Hero by the foggy villain um his identity remains foggy but the serpentry doctrine shows us who that villain really is and help us understand the reference like Romans 3 20 the God of Peace shall Bruce Satan under your feet shortly Jesus Christ was going to be the serpent Bruiser he was but he's still bruising the serpent under your feet as we have his Christ's Spirit within us and we go forward we follow his Warfare instructions we're bruising say under our feet as well because we are also sons of God and like I've mentioned the serpent C Doctrine just shows the awful effects of not just sexual sin in the film but really any sin James chapter 1 verses 14 and 15 says this um lust when the hath conceived bringeth forth sin and that that's a that's a sexual analogy of what of any kind of sin it works that way sin when it is finished brings forth death it destroys all kinds of relationships but God is not put off he's uh he doesn't distance himself from it he runs toward it not to accept it God's not saying it's it's okay he's saying no I want to help you if you're willing to be helped but you know what to be to be helped requires humility because you have to say yes I need it I'm completely messed up would you help me but he showed the servant seat Doctrine helps us see just how awful sin is shows us the importance of the Virgin birth why did a virgin have to conceive that that the egg and the sperm were placed there by God and and he and and Mary was just a carrier of that and it just shows also this is the serpency doctors in continuity with the Battle of Rage some from the very beginning it's all it's all there and I just pray that um the Lord will help us to uh to to see it to see how the devil is still working today as we can uh so we can war against him effectively I hope that um that establishes us perhaps on a little stronger um biblical footing we don't have to be afraid to share what we believe because it's there in the Bible and uh it uh it's very clear I trust you it's been if you want more information brother Jason to Mars track is there in the back um perhaps we can just uh close in the word of Prayer amen Heavenly Father we just thank you for your goodness to us Lord I Thank you for the Revelation that you have given in this day Lord to help us see not just um who you are but also see who our enemy is and who we are as well oh God Lord just ask your your blessed on each family I thank you Father that you that you're not afraid of the dysfunction each of Our Lives each of our families each of our relationships that you ran down and and came to uh redeem us Lord I Thank You forth I pray though that you would give us that heart as well to be ones who want to share your love and would never put somebody in the in the quarantine or give them a cold shorter shoulder but or we would reach out and embrace and and share your love Lord I pray that you would help us father in our own lives to to bruise Satan under our own feet Lord that we might be participating in that great Redemption also Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ a
