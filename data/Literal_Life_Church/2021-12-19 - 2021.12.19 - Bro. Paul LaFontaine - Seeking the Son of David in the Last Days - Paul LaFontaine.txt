========================================

and verse four and this is when they got away from god but then it speaks of redemption verse four for the children of israel shall abide many days without a king and without a prince and without a sacrifice and without an image and without an ethod and without a terraphim now i won't have time today to break all those down but just catch the simple theme the children got so away from god they didn't have a king anymore they didn't have a sacrifice anymore and all many of these things are elements that god gave the people to connect with god these are some of these are essential elements to connect with god and when they rebelled and got away from him it removed all of these connections to god that they were without any of these connections without a king without leadership without a prince without a sacrifice and like it was sung about the blood of jesus christ if we remove the true blood of jesus christ we're without that we are in trouble sacrifice was removed their king was removed but here's redemption just in two verses we see it verse 5 afterward shall the children of israel return and seek the lord their god and david their king and shall fear the lord and his goodness in the last days in the last days father bless your word today ask for your anointing i asked lord once again as i was asking yesterday for many hours that lord you will put the words in our mouth as we step aside to minister and say those things that have power behind them demonstration behind them that the people's lives could find that channel that we could grow and know you in a deeper way the beauty of your holiness the beauty of your your presence lord that we could be changed by it may we leave here change people today and we commit ourselves to you may the families just have a great wonderful time with in this worship of christmas time lord may reconciliation take place with family members may husbands and wives draw closer may children draw closer may families draw closer lord into your presence god i just pray that you the great god of redemption and reconciliation will continue to do your work lord in your kingdom we commit it to you bless these families we pray in jesus name amen god bless you once you shake somebody's hand before you take your seat god bless you each one now i'd like to speak on seeking the son of david in the last days now this is a prophecy this uh this verse 5 is a prophecy and it's a prophecy for the last days because he said they will turn to the lord and david their king shall fear the lord and his goodness in the latter days that's the last day so this is a prophecy and many times things apply to israel they apply to israel yes naturally but they apply to us spiritually so this returning and this seeking david the king applies to us gentiles as well and that we will be seeking after not having a king after not having the sacrifice after 2 000 years of church history as brother brother branham makes some comments about how that church systems and church denominations actually thwarted the effects of the blood of jesus christ because when you tamper with the word you tamper with the blood of jesus christ that's the path to the blood is through the word of god and so after 2000 years of church systems they eliminated the holy spirit they eliminated the true power of the blood of jesus christ but when he said i'll restore the word when he restores the word then he restores the power of the blood and we realize people can come back to their the true atonement and so i think he words it in one place he says the seventh angel or the end time message is to bring us out of pentecostal and world traditions back to the genuine atonement the word of god so being we're being restored back to the word but we're being restored back to the blood and the atonement and the true atonement of what it is it's not denomination it's the the blood of jesus christ through the word that cleanses a soul so the message has come to bring it so now this is a prophecy for our day because we're coming back and and so there's the seeking of the son of david in the last days and so i believe that this scripture is being fulfilled even more than what we realize in the last few years we see this because you look at hunger and you look at what's on the people's hearts and you look at the decisions they make and i'm talking within our own ranks even people making decisions because they're seeking more of of what god has for them and if you look at the past conditions of people and what they have been through it's just amazing what people have been through it's amazing the stories of people i would just say it safely this morning that there's many sitting here this morning it's a miracle that you're sitting here it's a it's an absolute miracle that you're still standing that you're still coming around the word of god that you still have a hunger you still have a desire when you hear some of the stories you really shouldn't be here but there must be something within you that's connecting and wants to grow even more can you say man i've got to know my king even more i'm seeking the son of david i'm seeking this king because this ends up in a millennium with the son of david can you say amen this ends up with us the bride being with the bridegroom it ends up with the king i can i can i can take a prophet and i've accepted his prophet but that's the son of man ministry can you say that a son of man ministry is is a prophet can you say man and i've embraced that with all my heart but that's not enough for me i don't want just the son of man ministry i want the the son of david i want my king you understand it's the same person now but he comes in different offices but you can't just be satisfied with son of man he's the son of god which the brother brahms says was the holy spirit because that's invisible son of david is more visible excuse me son of son of man is more visible and he was that way in jesus christ then he displayed that again in the last days to the gentiles it was more visible son of god is not visible it's the holy spirit coming in his people that's the unseen person living in his people for 2000 years we had that son of watching a prophet son of man is not good enough you have to have the same god as son of god you have to have the holy ghost a lot of people in the message think it's good enough and they'll go to the rapture because they believe god sent a prophet that's not enough you have to have the holy ghost but then there's this whole son of david which he's just as much son of david as he is son of god and that's what we're headed towards and so as we get closer to that i'm seeking more than just son of man i'm seeking more than just son of god i'm looking for my king i'm looking for the king's character to be displayed in his people and i just preached my whole message right there so we can i couldn't i couldn't hold back just letting it out and i look at the conditions of some people and what they're going through and but yet i see a desire very common in many people that are coming and staying close to the word no matter what conditions they're in there's a desire common in many and it's it's seeking out this king it's seeking to be in the presence of the king the seeking within god's people you know the within god's people they're seeking the lord and seeking the king doesn't stop with just salvation we don't stop seeking the lord after we receive salvation some of you were saved when you were a child maybe or maybe when you're 16 or maybe last year but we don't stop seeking after we get received salvation seeking the lord does not stop when we're sanctified can you say amen seeking the lord it does it doesn't end even after years of being in church i don't think our seeking the lord should end because we've been in church for years seeking is not over seeking does not is not over because deliverance is not over if we still need deliverance then we still need to seek god because there more is more of god can you say amen and when there's more of god when there's a deep call into the deep there's a deep to respond otherwise we probably wouldn't even be here this morning there has to be a seeking i hope you're not here for just a religious duty but i hope there's something in your heart seeking more of the king seeking more of god can you say that because seeking him doesn't end with salvation it doesn't end with sanctification seeking him doesn't even end after you receive the holy ghost there's more and when the deep is calling to the deep that shows there's a deep to respond somewhere and i would say and give us the benefit of doubt we're here and we wouldn't be here unless we were seeking him more and we're going to keep seeking they talk about these seeker-friendly churches anybody ever heard that seeker-friendly churches and they adapt everything for the seeker but it's all what they're seeking if they're seeking more rock and roll then we provide rock and roll for them if they're seeking more of worldly living and still sit in church and so it's a seeker friendly well we're we're the true seeker friendly church and for a soul that's hungry for god we preach the word of god unrestricted can you say amen and if you're seeking for more of god and and less of denomination then you need to come out of that nomination come out of religion can you say man and find the church that's truly seeker friendly it can meet the needs in your life [Music] that you're growing by seeking does not end because deliverance is not over yet your deliverance did not end when he delivered you from alcohol your deliverance did not end when he delivered you from cigarettes or adultery your deliverance wasn't over did you know that your full deliverance did not end when you received the holy ghost there are some preachers that preach us preach it that way that your deliverance was over but i'm here to tell you your deliverance isn't over and so you're seeking a more hymn isn't over and first corinthians 1 9 says if you guys want to pull that up first corinthians 1 and verse 9 but we had first corinthians 1 and verse 9. but we have the sentence of death in ourselves that we should not trust in ourselves but in god which raises the dead first corinthians 1 verse 10. do you have it up there first corinthians 1 verse 10 who delivered us from so great death so he delivered us from so great at death and doth deliver in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us he delivered us he does deliver and he will deliver your deliverance didn't end at just an altar one night or a camp meeting or a youth camp maybe we'll get into this the first of the year and just be specific if you're sitting there saying well i don't know what i need to be delivered from maybe we should talk about it because there's there's still things that don't get talked about a lot and we really need to be delivered from them maybe gossip maybe possession minded the love of money religion pride can you say amen but i'm a believer i have the holy ghost well we still need deliverance from things and if you've got them all covered the very fact you're still in this body shows you need to be delivered from this body so we still need deliverance and if we still need deliverance then we still need to seek god and seek the king amen so one thing today i'd like to lay down i don't know how much time we'll have but we're just going to lay some things down but one thing i was i must lay down when you see when you have seen jesus again as son of man as we have enjoyed in the last days we've seen him in his administration now for those of you who don't know those who be listening from different avenues of religions or denominations i just want to qualify and just say that jesus come in three sons names he was referred to as son of man when he came to earth he was mostly referred to a son of man he is also referred to as the son of god and he's also referred to as the son of david it's all the same person same as father son and holy ghost is the same person it's not three persons it's one person in three offices so other three offices he comes is the administration the son of man it's it's the same god but in a different nature that he comes to the people and it's a prophet that comes to the people jesus was the god prophet all the prophets of the old testament all typed him even moses himself said the lord someday will rise up a prophet like and unto me so it's prophesying that jesus will come first as son of man which is a prophet can you say amen he'll be in a visible administration acting as a prophet the god prophet he also comes as son of god it's a different administration but it's the same god he also in the the the prophet refers to it is in the millennium he'll come as son of david king and so all this is the same jesus christ but see now when you have seen jesus again repeated as son of man in the scripture jesus says i'll have to repeat son of man again he says when the conditions are sodom and gomorrah as in the days of sodom as in the days of noah when those conditions hit us again then he will reveal himself again as son of man similar to what he did in jesus christ he and he has to repeat that son of man administration for two reasons two reasons the conditions have become sodom and when conditions become terrible bad what's god do he sent a prophet people bark at prophets but it's the very thing that they need this last generation needed one thing and that was the prophet sent from god if you deny that then you're denying the very answer that this whole world needed can you say mine when the conditions get like sodom it's time for a prophet when israel rebelled against god these god sent jeremiah to warn them when the conditions get bad so that's the first reason is when the conditions get to such a low spot god sends a prophet the second reason he sins son of man jesus said i'll be revealed at the end time as son of man jesus said that all right the second reason he has to do it is because he displayed it the first time to the jews but to be fair he needs to place display son of man to gentiles so he says i'll leave it to the end time but there will be a short display of a similar administration of son of man now this is all in your bible if you're listening in or here listening here today i'm not off of the scripture we can talk about it if you want it's right in the bible he was referred to as son of man when he was here so much though he referred to himself as son of man and when somebody would refer to him something different than the administration he was in then we find that he sometimes would correct them even that he was not in the office of this yeah someone said son of god or someone said son of david the jews were wanting him now catch this i'm ahead in my notes here but that's all right saves us all time is anybody learning something from this this is important so so because i said it's important but you see when when the when he came in that office of son of man the jews didn't like it because they were under the conditions of rome they were under conditions of pressure they were getting taxed more uh anybody does that sound familiar with anybody the conditions were bad they were in despondence of rome and so what they wanted god to come is son of david we need a king like david to take over rome to get rid of all of them we want a king we want a king and one place when he come across and he said i'm going to go across to the boat to the other side and the reason he jumped on a boat and got away from the crowds because they feared lest they would make him a king they were so excited about the miracles they said this is our king this is the son of david we're going to make him a king and he the reason he got an abode and took off is because it wasn't time for son of david so we learn the lessons i don't care how much we want out of a certain thing we have to respond to what god is manifesting in the time he's manifesting with it's not what you want it's what god has provided for you [Applause] this morning it's not what you want out of god it's what god says you need i say that respectful because he desires to fulfill our needs and desires but you see now it can't be about you it can't be selfish and they wanted to make him a king there was another woman that was a a gentile seraphinician woman i think and she refers jesus she wanted healing jesus thou son of david have mercy on me and she only learned that from the jews she wasn't a jew but she learned i said maybe this is the term we'll get his attention and i'll get my healing he never even responded to her so it must have been pretty important because jesus didn't even respond to her now eventually when she kept coming and they got it worked out she got her healing but these things are important so so so now when he says he'll repeat as son of man in the end time we have watched this ministry and i'm not only referring to just it does come as one man first but he also referred to the son of man as being not only a prophet but bringing that word of the prophet which we still have with us and and he referred to it a couple times i believe son of man husband and wife and he also said this you're not feeding on a man but you're feeding on the body word of the son of man [Music] so something interesting about the son of man ministry how jesus comes is that although it starts with the one man visible ministry the words he speak is that's what's important because it becomes food to feed on you're not feeding on a man now you're feeding on the body word of the son of man that's different that's why people can disagree well it's just a man and that's his opinion be careful what you label his opinion and all this stuff just be careful with that i know there's some opinions there of his but i'd be careful what i it's not my choice to choose what's his opinion and what's not his opinion i just respect all of it knowing that he was a human being knowing that but we have to look at this right this is the ministry of the son of man that jesus said would come in the end time and we what we do with this we eat it we eat the word we eat the word we eat it what do we do with it we don't idolize the man who came we don't idolize any flesh we eat the son of man we eat what he gave us [Applause] so much he says that he says you're feeding on the body word of the son of man and you'll take a rapture someday it has to do with our rapture as well but the first thing god does in conditions he sends that ministry of a prophet son of man to give the word to the people so they know how do we get back how do we get back to god how do we get back restored to god israel would ask how do we get back to him we've rebelled we're in terrible conditions we're without a king we're without a sacrifice what do we do and many times the answer i say every time god sent a prophet right now god sent a prophet and though they might have went uh another prophet it's exactly what they needed this generation this culture has rejected the very answer god sent in the 20th century most if not all of denominational systems have rejected god's answer and it's always been god's answer he starts it to get the people back he starts it with a prophet that's right that's how he starts it you're never getting past that biblical pattern i just elaborate on this because i just feel to this morning maybe somebody's listening you just need to take your bible and see that there's a bible pattern you never can get around you say well that stopped in the new testament well who died made you interpreter of the word he only did miracles in the book of acts who died and made you interpreter of the word who gave you permission to say that your denomination tell you that i say hebrews 13 8 says jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever if people spoke in tongues in the book of acts they can speak in tongues today if people were raised the dead in the book of acts god can still do it in this very service this morning he can raise the dead still can you say amen and you come around and say well just prove it well i don't do things just to prove it because it probably wouldn't help you anyway if you got that attitude but the god that raised the dead 2000 years ago is able to raise the dead in this service this morning amen and i'm not preaching to the physically dead i'm preaching to spiritually dead people sometimes so the same god that can raise up lazarus can raise your soul out of death to new life this morning [Applause] as henry my brother-in-law has told me many times he says you preach my funeral every sunday because the old man dies and the new man christ comes to life i'm preaching funerals here and if you'll just die get in the casket and die to yourself and raise up the new man christ can come alive in your life i'm preaching the power of resurrection i'm preaching the power of the gospel and it has resurrection within it for your life to raise you out of denominational thoughts to raise you out of the religion within the message even to raise you out of a dull spiritual life to raise you out of life with no revival to raise you to have a spiritual revival in your life to raise up this is the living christ the resurrected christ as my friend wayne lawson says don't preach psychology preach the resurrected christ amen and that's what we've been preaching for 33 years here hallelujah so i don't have a clue where i'm at now in my notes but he has come as son of man oh it's been a great rejoicing time son of man son of god son of david prophet priest and king jesus is all of them eagle lamb and lion you'd say it anyway you want to say it here eagle lamb and lion if i can say it this way just let me get more specific now number one the washing of the water of the word by a prophet number two the intercessory blood of a lamb by a priest jesus christ and number three the character of a king coming forth this is our message and i'll get to it in a minute if i get to it when you look at the nativity scene all over right now after yesterday i'm looking at nativity scenes all together different because i'm looking at a baby which they didn't expect god to send but in that baby was the whole package son of man son of god son of david it was all there [Music] and when he sent this word as the last days and repeated son of man again it should alert us to the fact that god when he sends something he's not going to just said one thing but resident within that word is son of man son of god and son of david to get us ready for a millennium it's all jesus christ amen so the washing of the water and and get this now your old testament you read your old testament oh but i don't understand this here it is you know here he comes as prophet priest and king and did you know as you read through first samuel first chronicles second chronicles you read through all these words you know what the theme is a lamb priest prophets and a king he's speaking something he's saying something the theme is pointing to that baby jesus christ i'm going to do something here i always like to say it this way in the old testament god was trying to say something but when jesus came he was what god was trying to say the whole time he was everything god was trying to say this is what god looks like in a human being and if he looks that way and i say lord bring jesus in me he's going to look that way in your life the old testament it's prophets there's a lamb that's slain there's a lamb there's a priest bringing the lamb oh that's jesus christ and then there's a king and all of these things were speaking of what the one thing god would sin that we would need and that is the king but when they looked at that baby it was it was not only the king but everything would be in that baby everything would be there so when he sent a prophet and even when you're entering when you're entering the uh the tent the tabernacle of god you know they had a place on the outside and so you're approaching to get into the throne of god to get to into his presence so you come first to the the table and you wash there and the sacrifice is washed god sends a prophet for the washing of the water by the word but you're not done yet then you go into the tent and then you've got the different things you go there for for for sanctification the priest is inside that inner part and the priest prepares himself to enter for you that's the old testament in the old testament the priest enters that throne room for you with the sacrifice after calvary we have a right to enter the throne room ourselves that's why he says in revelations 3 he says i have overcome you overcome and to whom they'll overcome us i will grant to sit with me in my throne as i have overcome and said so this thing isn't about about jesus it's all about jesus but it's about you coming to kingship and priesthood with him see you it's approach to the lord approach the lord you have a priest there you have a lamb there you have a prophet there and then you come into the royal intervale royalty kingship the throne everything speaks of this baby that was born that was the whole package that had everything within it when you looked at it the washing of the word by a prophet intercessory blood by a lamb and a priest he actually was our lamb the character of king in other words our high priest jesus jesus christ he was not only the high priest but he became the lamb too and so we come under the correction of a true prophet the cleansing of a true sacrifice and the leadership of a true king under this message it's not done with a prophet under this message we come under what jesus christ did for the last days we come under the correction of a true prophet some people haven't even come underneath that yet and some attend this church they can't even line themselves up with the prophet's word yet but if it's the ministry of christ you come under the correction of a true prophet the cleansing and sanctification of a true sacrifice and then we come to true leadership of character in our amen how many want to be following true character and leadership a lot of people can preach this message and it'll be true preaching but they're lacking the character of the king that's a serious thing for your life that man should be growing in the character of the king and if he's going the opposite direction and still preaching this word you're missing an element that's in the message and that is it's not just preaching the prophet it's not just preaching that he was our high priest it's not just preaching the good mysteries and the true mysteries but we are growing into a kingdom people oh our goal for 2022 say god grew me into a kingdom people i know i'm royalty because the word says i'm royalty but lord let me start acting and conducting myself like royalty that's where we're going once you come and go with us that's where this message has taken us not intellectuals that can just dazzle one another with all the mysteries that we know but let me see the character of adoption coming in your life that's what this message is supposed to produce we're not done at a profit we're not done in just sanctified lives we're not done in dresses and long hair [Applause] don't you ever dump it out can you say a man a woman shouldn't cut her lay a pair of scissors through her hair that's according to the word of god don't ever dump that out don't ever dump out that it's wrong to wear a tight slits curtain above your knees and i don't cut any of that out we believe those things but we don't stop in a dress code we don't stop at just a prophet can you say amen we're looking for the character of the king [Applause] i'm looking for that character that come even in our prophet that grew to adoption in his life grew to maturity in his life grew to more divine love in his life the capstone he he was capped his life was capped with divine love so much so in 1965 he said god forgive me for calling those raquettas and rickeys he said they don't know what they're doing jesus said at the cross forgive them they don't even know what they're doing he says and shalom i recognize most of people don't even realize the state that they're in i shouldn't be the one criticizing them and putting out of the the kingdom but i should be the one that's praying for them that god can show them more truth that was adoption that was character not writing somebody off and say i'll never speak to that person again i know they go to my church and that's not what we're looking for we're looking for the capsule to divide love in our life [Applause] this message is not just god sending a prophet son of man it's son of god [Music] and son of david and i'm seeking the son of david i'm seeking my king you say well that's brother brother says that's the millennium i know that's when it all gets set up set up in this earth but we already have the king here do i need to do i need to verify he stood there and he held a sword you know what whose sword is that that's the king's sword that's the king's word i'm going to give my word to the people but the king is present with us that's why it just makes us want to just say lord ministers and all we bow to the presence of our king let him come and do what he wants to do praise the lord i'm having trouble finding the place here in my notes all right taking my coat off so somebody said keep going so that's what i'm doing once you pull up that quote and we'll read it as he said it it's probably 11 12 times he refers to these three names son of man son of god son of david making the distinction and when he revealed himself the son of man as the scripture said he would be no sir they rejected it he wasn't no prophet they couldn't believe it they hadn't had one for hundreds of years and they couldn't believe him to be a prophet when he told the little woman about how many husbands she had in her heart her in that condition she was ordained to life so he's making the point here that all the religious leaders said we don't want you to come this way we don't want a prophet we want son of david we don't want son of man but a little harlot girl who had five husbands and was living wrong she says i perceive you're that prophet you're a prophet so this is by predestination can you say man and she sees it she she doesn't have any back learning she hasn't been in in all that no she just her heart her soul connects with it you're they're the prophet and i receive it if you're coming a son of man i receive it i need it not only for my sin but i i need it to be a witness and she went and was a witness to everybody come see a man who's told me all the things in my life son of man became real and became alive to her can you say amen so now when he told that little woman uh the next one and when he told she said sir i perceive you're a prophet i know when messiah cometh we haven't had a prophet for hundreds of years but i know when he comes that's the sign he'll do because he how does she know that she hasn't been trained she's speaking from the soul i know that when he comes that's the sign he'll do because he'll be the word he knows what's in my heart he said i am he that speaks to you and her testimony caused the whole city to come to christ right they all believed not for the religious leaders but from a harlot who testified of the right ministry of son of man don't underestimate the power of your testimony next one now look as son of david he was with the jew but the son of god now look son of man prophet see the son of david king they recognized him not as a prophet they wanted to make him king they wanted to be delivered out from under the roman empire so they had needs and they wanted god to come and meet their needs in the channel that they wanted him to come in but he wasn't coming in that channel actually if they knew the condition of their soul which was in sin the serpent nature that they had if they knew the conditions their denominations were in if they knew the real state that they were in they would be saying the one thing that we need first is a real true prophet to rebuke us and get us back to the word but they weren't saying it because they didn't see their condition they had religion that they thought they were okay and prophets come to show us where we all are can you say amen not the modern day prophets that we have today modern day men who most of the time you're never going to hear a rebuke from them you're going to hear prosperity it's all good you're going to be mighty i was prophesied over one time i went to a hemphill concert years ago they don't sing anymore but i went and the son joel had lost his voice so i had been listening to their new project i liked i like southern gospel and so i was listening sister w to enjoy this so i went to toledo the concert and he was losing his voice i can tell so i went up my my buddy mark stanky saying go tell him you can sing with him you can do it i'm not going to go back there i'm not going to well he pushed me so i went back and i said my name's paula fontaine you don't know who i am but i know all the parts if you want me to help you out you can't do they say you know the parts yeah you know the parts you can do it he said fine you take it you know this song you know the idea yeah i know him is pretty easy and so they put me on with them the rest of the night here in toledo which i mean you know i don't know what i was 21 years old or 20. man to me i had hit the big time man i had hit the big time when i tell other people they usually say who's the hem pills so most other people i didn't hit the big time but to me i hit the big time and to my buddy mark stakey he's a southern gospel lover i hit the big guy sister debbie would probably think well you did hit the big time you sang with him pills so i did so good that night and they were loving it and his so they said we'll call you in the morning if his voice is bad we need you in columbus tomorrow night man i thought this was a career starting out for me i thought this is really good how much am i going to get paid for this no i didn't think that but anyway i got on the bus the next one because they asked me to go with them i drove down the bus well they had a profit on the bus from detroit and so now i have never been around that type of prophet i only knew the prophets of the bible the true prophet god sent in the last days so this is a total contrast so you know i'm already going okay here's a prophet on the bus and i walk on the bus and everything's kind of still and he's going around to every member of that that the bus every band member and he's prophesying over them and i was noticing every one of it was such a huge future for them they were going to go to the ends of the earth and they're going to be so popular they're going he's going on and on so that was a little strange to me that everything was prosperity there was no rebuke in these guys i said these guys must be angels because there's no rebuke there's no correction it's all they're going to be rich and famous someday so then he heads towards me and he's going to prophesy over me so i just bow my head you know and reverence and respect and man did i ever get a future your talent is going to go around the world and you're going to have all these people he went on and on and prospering and i just respect myself well praise the lord you know i respect those things i'm not going to put anybody down but it was my first taste of a prophet and so then after he walked off the bus and i spent the rest of the day with band members my conclusion was is that their lives needed some other things said from a prophet than what they heard i say that respectfully and i hope the hempfields don't ever listen to this video you know they were struggling they needed some deliverance in certain areas they need to say and so and i'm not saying anything i'm perfect myself i'm just saying that's what the word does that's the nature of the holy spirit you parents that try to protect your kids from correction and conviction you better think about that what other thing in their life did they have that's going to correct where they're wrong accept the word of god and accept the godly pastor who loves them where are they going to get it so that was a real lesson for me to know that you know the nature of the prophets to bring that correction first but that's not the end of the message and we find that they wanted a king son of david they would let's take a lesson this morning let's say lord it's not what i necessarily i want from you but you know my needs you know what i need at every service can you say amen and i say lord i submit myself if i come and get the hide ripped off of me by the word of god by conviction not condemnation but if i get it then lord if that's what you sent that's what i take but if i'm coming and i needed to be encouraged like wednesday night we were in here shouting shouting like crazy last sunday we had a special here we had church during the special and then we had church after that and sometimes it makes our hearts rejoice wednesday night we had a revival in here talking about our position and place and that we can live with no guilt god says we can live with no guilt sometimes god comes in different ways for what we need but we should never try to micromanage god and say i don't want this part i just want this part whatever way he comes let him come to me [Applause] they wanted son of david because they had rome and these different things every manifestation of the true christ is a direct perfect answer to our need and our condition for our times praise the lord hey so let's let's this is my christmas service so turn to matthew chapter two look at these fellas traveled all the way across the desert matthew chapter two now when jesus was born in bethlehem of judea in the days of herod the king behold there came a wise man from the east of jerusalem saying where is he that's born king of the jews for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him when herod the king had heard these things he was troubled in all jerusalem with him and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together he demanded of them where christ should be born and they said unto him in bethlehem of judea for thus it is written by the prophet and thou bethlehem in the land of judah are not the least among the princes of judah for out of thee shall come the governor thou shalt rule my people israel then herod when he had privately called the wise men inquired of them diligently what time the start appeared and he sent them to bethlehem and said go and search diligently for the young child and when you have found him bring me me word again that i may come and worship him also when they had heard the king they departed although the star which was saul in the east went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was praise the lord one of god's bibles was the heavens they didn't have a bible like yours but you know they didn't go to the internet to try to find where the king was coming but one thing for sure they were seeking the true king this morning just ask yourself am i seeking the true king and the crude leadership in my life and uh there's a there's a statement up there those that got the slides when we go when we're seeking last place you should go is to the internet and google it can you say man we can't trust anything can you say amen amen and even abraham lincoln said something about it do you have that up there nope nope i found that in tennessee i thought it'd be pretty cool to incorporate in one of my sermons you know new people that come to my church they might think this this guy is not your standard preacher at all all right put it down before i get in trouble i have a lot of fun i enjoy life and even though abraham lincoln didn't say that when we're seeking god we don't google it do what i was saying this morning get your bible get the message these guys didn't google it these guys didn't they went to the bible they went to the heavens and it began to show them and the star when they heard verse nine the king they departed below the star which they saw the east went before them until it came and stood over the young child when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy why because they were seeking a king they were seeking the king and they were already rejoicing when they found the star because the right star led them to the right king wasn't just another baby this was going to be their king that they were seeking their entire lives maybe you sought them for your whole life but tell you i tell you you ought to rejoice this morning if you found the right star that's leading you to the king they rejoiced with exceeding great joy and when they were coming to the house they saw the young child with mary his mother and fell down and worshiped him and when they had opened their treasures they presented unto him gifts gold frankincense and myrrh and being warned of god in a dream that they should not return to herod they departed into their own country another way whenever we come before the king we want to bring something to him and the gifts that they brought to him reflected what they thought of him they had a revelation of everything that was in this baby or this two-year-old child i should say they had a revelation and their gifts that they brought their life that they brought reflected what they said that he was and he goes back to prophet priest and king deity is a king gold represents deity frankincense is service the priest is death the lamb would die for us even their gifts reflected who this baby was going to be it's not going to be that we're looking for a politician or we're looking for another type of king like israel saying we want a king like the world we want leadership like they have all that was finished after we've seen what saul did and all of his mess up and everything even though he was anointed he kept messing up and god says it's time for me to give the true leadership to my people in this message it's time for the true leadership to come and it's not about men it's about the king jesus christ it's time for my people to get that and that they'll be the son of david in that baby is the son of david and that baby is the son of man in that baby is the whole package the son of god everything can you imagine if you'd have lived in that day and been there worshiping with the wise men which i believe if you have a revelation you would have been there [Music] but can you imagine there they're already rejoicing at the star they're already bowing and worshiping at the little baby the baby hasn't done anything yet he hasn't done anything yet he hasn't healed anybody yet he hasn't had his ministry yet he hasn't been a prophet to rebuke yet he hasn't rebuked all the denominational systems yet he has not come in the office of son of god where he fills people with the holy spirit yet he has not come as a king yet none of that's been manifested and yet they can look by revelation and say it's all here i wonder if we can look at the message the same way not the man william brandon but what god has given us in the last days because remember said they sought david the king in the last days they sought the lord there's a baby in heaven the whole thing is there everything is there you know i preached a few weeks ago on the potentials sometimes god gives you revelations of the potential that lays within something hey look at our bibles here you get into this word you young people and everyone else you start getting into this don't underestimate the potential and the power of living a life in the scriptures amen and some of you don't know because you've never been there you never experienced it yet we've got a few real bible-based people in the church and i like them in the church but you become real bible-based and bathe yourself in this word you don't realize the power that's in there can you say amen and you see things in potential form even if you don't see something that you need the jesus to manifest in your life yet for deliverance if you're looking at the right thing all the potential is there for all deliverance if you're looking at the wrong thing you don't have the potential for it but when you're looking at that baby you have the potential of all healing you have the potential of all redemption you had the potential of the lamb going to calvary you had the potential of all your sins being taken away can you say man and he was going to do all that and he did do all that can you say as we heard about the blood this morning thank god for the blood he went to calvary and for the joy that was set before him that's what our brother read last sunday for the joy you were the joy that was set before him he endured the cross you know what jesus said i went and did that i fulfilled that office of lamb and because because not because you're worthy but because i love you so much i made you worthy you were worth it you're my child you were worth it to redeem you amen you have to have see the value of it and songs like that show us the value we had our anniversary last week and uh we were out of town a couple days and so i wanted to take on friday i wanted to take my wife to a nice place so we chose this ruth chris steakhouse and uh so i had been a couple times before many years but i didn't realize how much the prices had gone up until we open the menus so so we open it up when we start looking at things and praise the lord all right so you have to you start weighing the value of things the value of this woman i know and i just struggled just a little bit and we can joke around about this and i did i i reached over to her and i said really enjoy this because it'll be another 28 years so there's before we come back to this restaurant again i said that to you did i say we joke around she was kind of you know surprised at it too you know 60 70 80 just for the steak so we we ordered and we did and i have to say the value of the food i mean i haven't tasted food like it was tremendous it was worth every dime as far as that goes it was really good and and so then you know crunch time came and we were gonna and so and this place was real i mean we didn't know how which forks to use miriam we just you know i know in canada you know they they have the they call it the cutlery up there it's a fancy term for a fork and spoon now because i was in a restaurant up there and the waiter said i don't know if i told you this mary but the waiter said would you like some cutlery i said no but i'll take some silverware that's how dumb i am you know but anyway we got towards the end and the waiter went in the back room and he was gone for quite a while and i said hon this is our chance to kind of scoot out the door before he comes back with the bill i would not do that all the children listening i would not do that but i can't say that the thought didn't come to me but i'll say publicly and i won't tell you what the bill was but she's worth every dime worth every time amen i mean that with all my heart it's the least i can do for her who she is in character and that's what our hearts is towards the lord and that's what his heart is towards us i went to calvary because you were worth it to me i i win as the lamb because you were worth it to me praise the lord she was worth it she's she's been a great wife and a companion a great woman of character and she was worth every penny of it some other bills may not get paid the next couple months she was still worth it oh my god okay i'm looking for a place to end here how about matthew chapter one and verse when he speaks to joseph verse 18 now the birth of jesus christ was on this wise one as is mary mother mary was espoused to joseph before they came together she was found with child of the holy ghost then joseph her husband being a just man not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privately but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the lord appeared to him in a dream saying joseph thou son of david fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife can you see he was dealing with his fear he was dealing with his fear for that which is conceived in her is of the holy ghost and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name jesus for he shall save his people from their sins i want to simplify all of this that i've said this morning to you when he comes it's for one purpose he will save his people from all of their sins when you looked at that baby the whole package was there when you look at god's word that he sends he will take care of it all you don't have to take some of the message and some of this and some of that it's it's provided in the atonement and he shall save his people from their sins that's my christ today because i have been delivered for many things but i still need some deliverance how many raise your hand and say i've been delivered from many things but i still need some deliverance in my life thank you thank you for being honest i need some more deliverance and that word says when he comes he'll save his people from all of their sins oh i rejoice today when we see the word you may not have everything you need yet but the potential is there and simeon you kids know the story of simeon old man he had prayed oh god before i die can i see the messiah the salvation of israel could i just say it please he prayed he fasted he prayed he fasted and when mary came to the temple that day he was to dedicate the baby and he got that baby in his arms and god showed him by revelation he's holding that baby and he his tears coming down his eyes he reaches up and holds that baby says your servant can depart in peace now because i have just seen the salvation of israel he didn't see him do one miracle he didn't see him as son of man he didn't see him as son of david he would be all that but he's seen all the potential right there and this will be the entire salvation of israel hallelujah don't underestimate the word that god sends and all that it's in it to finish the work in your life all the potential lies within the word can you say amen david is already among us the son of david is already in our midst he's already manifesting himself because i can see it in the character of the people and i'm going to keep seeking that character in the people a people without fear a people without pretense a people without gossip a people that's growing to maturity a kingdom people for the millennium they're being delivered from their corpse and their complexes and their fears they're being delivered from those things that's when you sing in the king of character on the scene [Applause] and i'm going to keep seeking it in my own life in your lives until we see more of it because the son of david is among us and when all those people do you know can i close on this can i have one minute do you know when david became king turn with me if you would ten to one i know what time it is i i got you a gift so you have to stay extra time look at here in first samuel i might have to find it because i didn't okay so so david the new king gets anointed in chapter 16 and then as he goes in this transition of saul coming against the new king all this i want to preach on all this because it's amazing all this stuff happens sometimes within our ranks in the message but if you go to chapter 22 and verse 1 and 2 i want you to look at who was seeking the king and then i we will close you can stand just as a sign that we're closing david therefore first samuel 22 they were therefore departed dance and escape to the cave adam and when his brethren and his father's house heard it they went down thither to him and everyone that was in distress and everyone that was in debt and everyone that was discontented what a crew what a group of people gathering to david in debt in distress discontented gathered themselves unto him and he became a captain over them and there were with him about 400 men you often hear sermons by many preachers on the four or 500 gentile warriors that are fighting with david but you don't hear of this crowd that gathered with them discontinued disappointed in saul's leadership distressed in debt that's the type of people god gave david but they had a revelation this guy's coming to the throne and if he's in the cave i'm going to the cave wherever his presence is even though he's not fully on the throne yet he will be king someday and i'm going to bring my life no matter how much debt i have no matter how much distress i have i'm going to bring it to him because something's going to good be good from being in his presence let's give the lord a handclap of praise amen hallelujah glory be to god he's promised to hold my hand he's promised to help me stand when the valley's too low and the river's too wide he promised he would lead me to the other side he's promised to light feet to strength living his word i will overcome standing on his promises one by one he's promised to hold my hand he promised to help me stand when the valley's too low and the river's too wide i promise it would lead me to the other side he promised living in his word i will overcome standing on his prom sing it one more time he's from us to hold hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] standing on his promises one amen you know there's a little course we used to sing and that's why i think of my king today my king is everything to me he used to be of course he said he is my he is my everything he is my all is this king everything to you he is my everything both great and small he gave his life for me made [Music] no other will do he's everything he is the son of man son of god son of david he is everything to us friends he is my everything both great and small oh he gave his life for me [Music] [Applause] no other will do [Music] amen can we just pray together can you bow your heads and just speak to the lord today you know the wonderful thing friends is you don't have to go through anybody to talk to christ your king you can go directly to the king you have a direct line to him this morning don't go through a priest or go through me as a pastor if you speak to him and speak to him this morning say lord i'm seeking you i'm seeking the son of david i'm seeking this type of king leadership in my life and i'm seeking for the royal [Music] character to be manifested in my life whatever deliverance i have left in my life he has provided for that deliverance help me raise your hand and say i accept that deliverance i accept that lord show me where i need deliverance in my life show me don't let me be blind to it when you show me then god give me that in your atonement that would deliver me from that that i can be free lord i can leave here a different person than what i came in the son of man son of god son of david all of our needs all met within the same god and the same christ it's wonderful can you pray with me can you speak to your king this morning lord [Music] we feel humbled and honored lord to be [Music] able to meet like this spend time in the word like this lord just praying here last night in the sanctuary such a nice atmosphere lord you know father i prayed for every one of these that are so important to you you gave your blood for them i prayed that you'd change them lord and change me and you remember i prayed father and said i feel just a tad distant from you whenever that happens i don't run to other things i run towards you and say god don't let me feel distant don't let me feel that coldness anymore lord i don't want to feel that i want to be close to my king and know that i'm in his presence [Music] and esther she had the boldness and humility to come and approach to the king and have an audience with the king because she was the queen lord she really had a right to come and speak to you we have a right lord through the blood [Music] approach you with boldness before the throne of god all boldness all humility say god we are one of your children lord we long for the finished work of calvary to be manifested in our lives in our families and our children in our character finish us lord you who have begun a good work in us all the years in between don't really matter it's lord that you finish the masterpiece and finish what you've done what you started granted father we commit our souls to you may we draw closer this coming year to one another to our god our king granted father commit these lives to you in jesus name amen
