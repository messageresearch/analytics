[0:06] hope to meet you after the service and
[0:08] God is good all the time and we're glad
[0:10] to be with you this Wednesday night to
[0:12] study the word together and to feel that
[0:14] his presence is here it's so much easier
[0:16] to preach when we've invited him and
[0:18] made him feel welcome and we're just
[0:20] happy to be in his house tonight and we
[0:21] have our special meetings this weekend

[0:36] and then the weekend after that Memorial
[0:38] Day weekend we're announcing the
[0:40] meetings over at Brother Sam Browning's
[0:42] Friday Saturday and Sunday and we'd like
[0:44] to participate in some of those I'd like
[0:45] you to do it if you can as well brother
[0:47] Nathan Brian will be speaking over there
[0:49] so those are Friday Saturday and Sunday
[0:50] as well and Memorial Day weekend but
[0:52] this weekend it's Saturday night at here
[0:54] at six o'clock here at the church and I
[0:57] know you enjoy the word we let the
[0:58] pastors know in the area today and so we
[1:01] have some people coming out to
[1:03] fellowship with us for the meetings and
[1:05] they've been announcing it so we're
[1:06] excited about that Exodus 19 and verse 3
[1:09] if you would here and Moses went up unto
[1:12] God
[1:13] the prophet of God went up unto God and
[1:15] the Lord called unto him out of the
[1:17] mountain saying thus shalt thou say to
[1:19] the house of Jacob and tell the children
[1:22] of Israel so now God is telling the
[1:25] prophet to go tell the people something
[1:28] and this is what he told the people you
[1:29] have seen God saying you've seen what I
[1:32] did unto the Egyptians and how I bear
[1:34] You On Eagle's Wings and brought you
[1:36] unto myself now therefore if he will
[1:39] obey my voice indeed and keep my
[1:42] Covenant I just want you to stop and
[1:43] recognize now what God is saying he just
[1:46] gave his whole history with the children
[1:49] of Israel he said what have I done he
[1:51] says I you've seen what I did to the
[1:53] Egyptians I took care of your enemy
[1:55] phase one and then and then I bore You
[1:58] On Eagle's Wings now in this Wilderness
[2:00] journey I bore You On Eagle's Wings
[2:02] phase two and then he says I brought you
[2:05] unto myself which is a revelation of the
[2:08] mystery of why God did all that and that
[2:10] is to bring you to himself to bring you
[2:14] to himself aren't you glad that that's
[2:17] the purpose God's bringing you to
[2:19] himself he'll use miracles to do it
[2:21] he'll destroy your enemy in the Red Sea
[2:24] to do it he'll do whatever needs to be
[2:26] done but the purpose is to bring you to
[2:28] himself because he wants relationship
[2:30] with you
[2:31] now therefore if you will obey my voice
[2:34] if you follow my voice indeed and keep
[2:37] my Covenant then ye shall be a peculiar
[2:40] treasure unto me above all people for
[2:43] all the Earth is mine and ye shall be
[2:46] unto me a kingdom of priest plural a
[2:49] kingdom of priests a holy nation these
[2:53] are the words which Thou shalt speak
[2:54] unto the children of Israel Heavenly
[2:56] Father we thank you for your glory just
[2:58] sweeping through the building tonight
[2:59] and Lord we just we can't worship you
[3:02] enough Lord when the people lift their
[3:04] Praise You inhabit those Praises God has
[3:07] been a joy father to express ourselves
[3:09] in this way and that song saying lift
[3:12] our head if you're faithful to us Lord
[3:14] God in the loss of time we can lift our
[3:17] head to you and know that redemption's
[3:19] drawing nigh Lord I pray you anoint us
[3:21] tonight with your word anoint us with
[3:23] your spirit Lord that we could say those
[3:25] words that encourage everyone in their
[3:27] Christian walk and their Journey
[3:29] relationship with you Lord may we lay
[3:31] guide every doubt every fear Lord every
[3:35] depression anything that would hinder us
[3:37] I pray we'd lay it aside tonight Lord
[3:39] and just look and behold your face we
[3:42] commit the service to you in the name of
[3:44] Jesus Christ amen everybody said amen
[3:48] God bless you may be seated I'm directed
[3:51] by the Lord back to this small portion
[3:54] of text that I read last Wednesday night
[3:56] in Exodus 19 and I believe that it's
[3:59] there's more in here that I'd like to
[4:01] preach on a little bit and that it shows
[4:03] and unveils to me the final purpose of
[4:06] God
[4:07] through many of the mighty acts that God
[4:09] did you got to realize with the children
[4:11] of Israel he did some mighty acts some
[4:13] mighty things that he hadn't hadn't done
[4:15] for four or five hundred years and then
[4:17] God visits his people God sends a
[4:19] prophet and then God begins to display
[4:22] himself in such a powerful and a mighty
[4:25] way I don't think until this day God
[4:29] displayed him out himself to that many
[4:32] people two million is what come out of
[4:34] Egypt and I don't think God displayed
[4:36] himself until today to in that way of
[4:39] Mighty acts like he did to the children
[4:40] of Israel it was awesome it was amazing
[4:42] the things that God did you couldn't
[4:44] deny that God had not come down and
[4:46] visited his people and he opened the Red
[4:48] Sea and he brought water out of the rock
[4:50] for them and he brought bread and he
[4:52] just did so many marvelous things and
[4:54] then he destroyed as he said the
[4:56] Egyptians for them the enemy and so
[4:59] there was so many mighty things done but
[5:02] I believe these scriptures just a few
[5:04] scriptures we read right in the middle
[5:06] of all that there's a there's a
[5:07] revealing of God's purpose you see
[5:09] because when God does something Mighty
[5:12] or many things Mighty like that it's to
[5:15] grab our attention but whatever he's
[5:17] doing he has a final purpose to it God
[5:22] is a god of purpose God doesn't do
[5:26] anything just to fill time God doesn't
[5:29] do anything just to just to show off
[5:33] God doesn't do anything just that you
[5:35] can continue to watch his mighty acts he
[5:39] always has a final purpose to it and and
[5:42] so this is what I believe these
[5:44] scriptures reveal you're seeing the
[5:47] fight there's always a final purpose and
[5:48] you're seeing the the purpose and and
[5:52] let me just say it this way seeing God's
[5:54] purpose is very very very important and
[5:59] matter of fact it's probably the most
[6:00] important out of your experience with
[6:02] God is seeing his purpose of why he's
[6:05] doing it
[6:06] as a matter of fact you could watch God
[6:08] in your whole life and not catch his
[6:10] purpose
[6:11] and what a shame that would be because
[6:12] God has an achievement he has something
[6:15] he's trying to do even in the hour we
[6:17] live in he has an achievement something
[6:19] that he wants to accomplish something he
[6:21] wants to get done can you say man I've
[6:23] always aligned myself since 16 years old
[6:26] with God's achievement for this hour I
[6:28] said Lord whatever it is you're trying
[6:30] to achieve it's not about my career it's
[6:33] not about my achievement it's not about
[6:34] my vision my goals although you have
[6:37] goals I think it's good but you must
[6:39] align your achievements and your goals
[6:42] and your career and your college choice
[6:44] or whatever it is a young person you
[6:47] should align your dreams and your goals
[6:49] and your achievements with what God's
[6:51] achievement is for this hour young
[6:53] couple that you you've been married
[6:55] you've got a young family you should
[6:57] pray and say God what can we do for the
[7:00] kingdom of God how can we align our
[7:03] careers and our jobs and our paycheck
[7:05] every week with God's purpose for this
[7:09] hour
[7:11] because there's nothing everything else
[7:13] is empty you know why would you want to
[7:14] put all your money into something and
[7:16] then it just doesn't mean anything
[7:17] someday the only meaning only one life
[7:20] will soon be passed only What's Done For
[7:23] Christ will last my mom here used to
[7:26] sing that song Only One Life till soon
[7:28] it will pass only What's Done For Christ
[7:31] is going to last
[7:33] only one chance to do his will so give
[7:36] to Jesus all your days it's the only
[7:39] life that pays when we recall we only
[7:42] have but one life how many rations are
[7:45] going to say we only have we only get
[7:46] one
[7:47] we only get in the on this Earth anyway
[7:49] now we know we have eternity but on this
[7:51] Earth we only have one chance boy I want
[7:53] to do it right don't you
[7:55] we only have one chance we better do it
[7:57] right and we better not wait till
[7:59] opportunities to come we better say Lord
[8:00] you've given me this paycheck and maybe
[8:03] it's a big paycheck or maybe it's little
[8:04] it doesn't matter doesn't matter are you
[8:07] saying Lord what can I do for the
[8:09] kingdom of God what can my family do for
[8:11] the kingdom of God if you don't have
[8:13] that then you're not catching God's
[8:14] purpose and so God has a purpose for
[8:17] everything he has a vision and seeing
[8:19] that vision is so important if we don't
[8:21] see it what happens when we don't see
[8:23] God's purpose if we don't see God's in
[8:26] purpose and what he's doing then we
[8:28] might get hung up on all the details in
[8:31] between
[8:32] it might get hung up on people get hung
[8:34] up on the details people get hung up on
[8:37] God people get hung up on God's law
[8:39] people get hung up on God's principles
[8:41] people get hung up on what God tells
[8:43] them to do and say oh why is God asking
[8:45] me to do that I don't understand and so
[8:47] they might get hung up on the details
[8:49] and why is it they lack seeing God's
[8:52] purpose in all of it because there's a
[8:54] purpose there's an in purpose there's a
[8:56] there's a reason why God says everything
[8:58] he says there's a there's a final end to
[9:01] it can you say amen and what would it be
[9:03] if you didn't understand the end can you
[9:05] say amen and you're trying to figure out
[9:07] why he's saying this now but you don't
[9:09] understand his purpose God has a purpose
[9:12] in it
[9:13] and so you're always praying saying God
[9:15] give me a vision
[9:16] show me a vision show me what your
[9:19] purpose is for this hour and show you
[9:21] show me what my purpose is because if we
[9:24] don't catch that then we might get
[9:25] snagged we might get hung up on the
[9:27] details and or people might get hung up
[9:29] on depending too much on watching
[9:31] Miracles the Bible speaks of sign
[9:33] Seekers the the the the the the uh
[9:36] there's a certain group of people in the
[9:37] New Testament they were followed the
[9:39] signs they were saying Jews are somewhat
[9:41] that way they seek signs we would become
[9:44] just sign Seekers of God if we're not
[9:46] catching his purpose the sign is not his
[9:49] final purpose
[9:51] and so we can't just be sign Seekers but
[9:55] we must be purpose Seekers saying Lord
[9:57] what's your purpose
[9:58] what happens when we don't get his
[10:00] purpose and we don't get the vision it's
[10:02] because we because we maybe don't want
[10:04] to see it or we're not crying for it God
[10:07] show me your purpose and why you sent
[10:09] this message show me your purpose and
[10:11] why you said this in this hour what's
[10:13] the final result of everything God I
[10:15] want to know what your purpose is if we
[10:16] don't we get hung up on the details and
[10:19] we become a sign seeker and by that we
[10:22] stop short uh like I was saying on
[10:25] Sunday about the farmer the husbandmen
[10:27] who here he is he he has faith in the
[10:30] seed that's been planted in the ground
[10:33] that it says he has long be patient unto
[10:36] the coming of the Lord he has long
[10:38] patience for it until he received the
[10:40] former and latter raid why does he have
[10:42] patience because he's got a faith and a
[10:44] confidence in the seed that's been
[10:46] planted it's the right seed it's the
[10:48] good seed and the good seed has been
[10:51] planted not by him but by the son of man
[10:55] and when you have a confidence in what's
[10:58] been planted then God for a farmer he
[11:02] knows if that's good conditions and it's
[11:04] a good seed and there's going to be the
[11:06] right sunshine and the the right Reign
[11:09] which by the way is all up to God
[11:12] you realize the farmer is completely
[11:14] dependent on God for his crop
[11:17] he may take his tracker and tractor and
[11:20] tear up the you know and break up the
[11:22] fallow ground and then they may have uh
[11:25] things today tractors to plant the seed
[11:27] and all that but you see it's got to be
[11:28] good seed but once it's planted in the
[11:31] ground then he stands back and he's he
[11:33] has to have faith in the seed and then
[11:35] he's completely dependent on the sun and
[11:37] the rain can you say amen and God
[11:39] provides that so when we know that God's
[11:42] in our life then we step back and say
[11:43] God I know this will be right if you're
[11:46] in it can you say Amen
[11:48] and and and so the farmer he has faith
[11:50] in the seed but I want to I don't want
[11:52] to preach that sermon again but he has
[11:53] faith in the scene and who planted it
[11:55] and the vision a farmer can see if if
[11:58] the conditions are right he has a vision
[12:00] of what's going to come out of that
[12:01] ground
[12:03] he sees a full crop coming up there's a
[12:06] purpose in planting the seed and because
[12:09] he sees that purpose it's easy for him
[12:11] to be patient and wait for God to do it
[12:14] amen he has patience he waits on the
[12:16] full purpose to be fulfilled so millions
[12:18] of people even Christians have struggles
[12:21] over history because they did not see
[12:23] the purpose of God millions of people
[12:26] even Christians throughout history 2 000
[12:29] years of church history even in the Old
[12:30] Testament there's been people that
[12:32] struggled there's been people that have
[12:34] that has fears they they haggle over
[12:37] things they they struggle within
[12:40] themselves sometimes you can't see it
[12:41] outside but they struggle within
[12:43] themselves and many times it's because
[12:45] they don't see the purpose of God
[12:49] they don't see and they get hung up on
[12:51] trying to understand him in their own
[12:54] mind we can't understand God in our own
[12:56] mind his thoughts are higher than our
[12:59] thoughts
[13:00] his life is higher than our life can you
[13:03] say Amen his purpose is greater than our
[13:06] purpose and people get up hung up trying
[13:08] to understand them in their own mind why
[13:10] is God asking me to do this why does God
[13:13] ask us to wear this
[13:15] why well this is strange and it's
[13:19] because it's strange to them because
[13:20] they don't see the purpose the
[13:22] long-range result of God in his mind and
[13:25] what he's trying to accomplish
[13:27] correction of God correction from God
[13:31] is mostly resisted
[13:33] do you realize that God's correction is
[13:35] mostly resisted in people
[13:37] but it's because they don't understand
[13:39] the purpose in the correction
[13:46] I think Paul mentions it where he says
[13:49] our fathers in the flesh corrected us
[13:51] and spanked us and you know disciplined
[13:55] us for their own Prophet for their own
[13:57] benefit but he says our father chastens
[14:00] us his sons not for his own benefit but
[14:02] it's for our benefit
[14:04] so God's chastening God's correction has
[14:07] a purpose it has an intent behind it
[14:09] aren't you glad can you say Amen but
[14:11] most people resist the correction of God
[14:13] because why they don't see the purpose
[14:15] of God behind it they just see they're
[14:16] being corrected they only see the moment
[14:18] you did wrong I'm correcting you for it
[14:20] but God has a much bigger purpose in
[14:22] correction when he comes and corrects
[14:23] you God has a vision God has a
[14:26] correction for your life and that
[14:27] correction is to bring something good
[14:29] history has these people struggling many
[14:32] times and I believe that I believe God
[14:35] has Grace for people who struggle
[14:37] especially when we realize that the
[14:40] scripture speaks about God holding back
[14:43] his full mystery till the end time
[14:46] Daniel started to see some things by
[14:49] vision
[14:50] this will be a little bit teaching
[14:51] preaching tonight so it's preaching
[14:54] Daniel had a thing and but then he was
[14:57] told seal this up Jeremiah had something
[15:00] there in a scroll he said seal it up
[15:02] and then even when you get to the the
[15:04] end time as far as John on the Isle of
[15:06] Patmos he began to see and and and watch
[15:09] what the watch what was being uttered in
[15:11] the Mysteries under the Seven Seals and
[15:14] and he was about to write and he said no
[15:16] seal it up it's not time for it yet so
[15:18] there's a certain holding back that God
[15:21] does to the full mystery because he has
[15:23] a time for it and that's why there's a
[15:26] scripture that says God for many years
[15:28] winked at ignorance because the full
[15:30] purpose and mystery of God wasn't
[15:32] unveiled to the end time Revelations 10
[15:34] 7 but in the days of the voice of the
[15:36] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[15:38] sound the mystery of God should be
[15:41] finished not back in Jesus day not back
[15:43] in Daniel's day it was there was certain
[15:45] parts held back but there would be a
[15:48] time that God fully pours out his
[15:51] purpose his mystery can you say Amen so
[15:54] that's why I think he has Grace there
[15:55] was a time that God winked at ignorance
[15:57] but now there's a time he doesn't
[15:59] because when he fully lets his purpose
[16:00] know that's when that's the time for us
[16:02] to latch onto it and say God you show me
[16:05] what your full purpose is from Genesis
[16:08] to Revelation you've opened up your uh
[16:11] what you've done even what happened in
[16:13] heaven before Earth was here before the
[16:15] fall came in the garden you opened up
[16:18] all the way back what happened in heaven
[16:20] when Lucifer fell you've unveiled his
[16:22] schemes then you opened up what happened
[16:24] in the garden that it wasn't an apple
[16:26] that it was sin in the garden can you
[16:28] say Amen that there was two seeds that
[16:31] come from the Garden of Eden you've
[16:32] opened all that up today and through
[16:34] Genesis to Revelations at the last days
[16:36] he says I'm going to do this and my
[16:38] purpose is to show my my in purpose and
[16:41] my mystery to the people he held it back
[16:43] so that's why I say there's some Grace
[16:45] for people who struggle through the
[16:47] years and struggle God I don't
[16:48] understand why you're saying that God I
[16:50] understand why'd you ask us to wear that
[16:52] God I don't understand this and and I
[16:55] believe it's because people do not know
[16:58] the full purpose and mystery that was
[17:01] held until the end time he even says it
[17:04] this way by lack of this Revelation is
[17:06] the reason we have so much Division and
[17:09] denomination Among Us
[17:11] so in other words if the full purpose of
[17:14] God was known you wouldn't have division
[17:17] amongst the people of God
[17:19] by lack of this revelation of the
[17:22] mystery Christ is the mystery of God
[17:25] revealed and by lack of this Revelation
[17:28] is the reason why we have so many
[17:31] divisions Among Us that's the way he
[17:33] said it by lack of this Revelation is
[17:35] the reason that we have trouble and then
[17:37] besides God prayer God's purpose let me
[17:40] just move along now then we we we're
[17:42] seeing our own purpose as well but let's
[17:44] just say this you can't see your purpose
[17:46] without seeing God's purpose
[17:50] you can't understand
[17:52] why you're here on Earth unless you
[17:55] understand what God's purpose is
[17:57] it's linked together can you say Amen
[18:00] why would somebody want to say I'm going
[18:02] to figure out what my purpose is in life
[18:04] but I don't believe there's a God
[18:08] didn't work that way
[18:10] matter of fact you're in trouble if you
[18:11] ignore God
[18:13] in a lot of ways you're going to be in
[18:15] trouble
[18:16] you can't go without God you can't go
[18:18] without his his Revelation and his his
[18:21] personal relationship with you you can't
[18:23] approach marriage or finances or life
[18:28] or death
[18:31] without God
[18:33] so when you're trying to find your
[18:35] purpose then you can't see your purpose
[18:38] without seeing God's actually God's
[18:41] ultimate purpose and achievement
[18:44] can never be separate from you
[18:46] personally now that's a strong statement
[18:48] but I can confidently make it is that
[18:50] God God's ultimate purpose and
[18:53] achievement that he wants to achieve can
[18:55] never be separate from you personally
[18:58] the elect of God because his achievement
[19:00] is related to you
[19:03] his final achievement is related to you
[19:06] you say God I'm not a part of this you
[19:09] just go ahead and fulfill your final
[19:10] word no no his final achievement is to
[19:13] express himself through his people
[19:15] so your purpose is interlinked with his
[19:18] purpose
[19:19] this mystery is comes back to us Paul
[19:21] said Christ The Mystery of God revealing
[19:24] as Paul said Christ in you the hope of
[19:26] glory you can't separate God's purpose
[19:29] from it being related personally to you
[19:31] and I don't mean a group because you
[19:33] can't say well God's purpose is a
[19:34] Revival around the world God's purpose
[19:36] finally is God being revealed personally
[19:39] to you if no one else if the theologians
[19:42] don't understand it God doesn't care if
[19:44] the theologians don't understand it he
[19:46] doesn't care systems don't understand it
[19:48] the final Revelation the final the new
[19:51] birth is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[19:53] personally to you personally to Haley
[19:57] personally personally sister personally
[20:00] to brother Tom it's personal it's not a
[20:02] group it's not a church can you say Amen
[20:04] the final purpose of God is revealed to
[20:06] you personally
[20:08] so you can't say I'm going to find my
[20:10] purpose in life without finding God's
[20:12] purpose because you are God's purpose
[20:15] oh we should be shouting over that
[20:18] you are God's purpose you are God's
[20:21] final achievement he went to Calvary for
[20:24] you
[20:27] man
[20:28] so
[20:30] it it's this there's something here
[20:33] that's
[20:33] uh interesting another Minister quoted
[20:36] this the other day he would speak in
[20:37] another place and I just listened to a
[20:39] little bit of it and he quoted this out
[20:41] of why Christ speak he says God has a
[20:43] God God has got a purpose of you being
[20:45] here
[20:46] this is the uh 1963 why Christ speak God
[20:51] has got a purpose of you being here see
[20:53] if you could only get to that place
[20:57] where you find your purpose
[20:59] how much trouble you'd save God in
[21:02] yourself
[21:03] oh my now I'm going to stop right here
[21:05] and preach for an hour
[21:07] you're going to tell me that that's the
[21:10] problem and you would save God a lot of
[21:13] trouble and save yourself a lot of
[21:16] trouble in life if we just if you could
[21:18] just find your purpose in God
[21:22] so Trouble Comes when we don't find our
[21:25] purpose
[21:27] if you don't have it tonight say God
[21:28] this is my priority tonight God show me
[21:31] my purpose while I'm on Earth
[21:33] show me why I'm here Lord
[21:35] show me I'm a son and daughter of God
[21:36] and what not just what I'm supposed to
[21:38] do show me who I'm supposed to be
[21:41] then you'll show you what to do
[21:42] in the kingdom of God
[21:44] but but look at that if you can only
[21:46] find that place of your purpose how much
[21:48] trouble you'd save God in yourself too
[21:50] if you just find your place what kind of
[21:53] trouble have you caused because you
[21:54] weren't in your position you weren't in
[21:56] your place
[21:58] what kind of trouble have you brought to
[21:59] God well I haven't brought any trouble I
[22:01] doubt it you've probably brought quite a
[22:03] bit of trouble to God
[22:04] and you probably got try to get quite a
[22:06] bit of trouble to your life and maybe
[22:08] your finances or whatever else because
[22:10] you don't know your you don't know your
[22:12] purpose yet
[22:15] I know a young man or a young woman
[22:17] sometimes can cause a lot of trouble
[22:19] because they don't know who they are yet
[22:21] they have an identity crisis so now
[22:24] they're trying to be a basketball star
[22:25] and then the next week they're trying to
[22:27] be this and they're trying to be that
[22:28] and parents can't figure it out because
[22:29] they have an identity crisis they
[22:31] haven't found out who they are in Christ
[22:32] yet
[22:33] come on now say Amen you know that's
[22:35] true they have an identity crisis and so
[22:38] they haven't found their purpose in life
[22:40] and they can cause a lot of people a lot
[22:42] of trouble matter of fact some of them
[22:43] end up in prison because they're still
[22:45] trying to find themselves still still
[22:47] trying to get a purpose in life they go
[22:49] from thing to thing and and they're a
[22:51] mess they cause God a lot of trouble
[22:52] they cause themselves a lot of trouble
[22:54] but it's not just people that go to
[22:56] prison all of us can be that way when we
[22:58] don't find our purpose and that's why
[23:00] the purpose of God is essential the
[23:04] purpose the mystery of God what is the
[23:06] mystery of my life what is the mystery
[23:08] of God I must personally find that or
[23:10] else I'll struggle even with the
[23:12] scriptures sometimes the purpose of God
[23:15] is revealed you see I can go down to
[23:18] Ephesians chapter one you know what I
[23:19] don't think I'll leave it out Ephesians
[23:21] chapter one just to confirm how
[23:24] important that God's purpose is how many
[23:26] believe that God has a purpose
[23:28] let's not let that become common to us
[23:30] to us God has his acts he has his
[23:33] miracles he has so many things that he
[23:36] has done and will do can you say Amen
[23:40] our faith applied to the word will heal
[23:43] cancer our faith and applied to the word
[23:46] will open up the blinded eyes I said
[23:47] that on Sunday
[23:49] but it's not just what God can do it's
[23:52] what's his purpose because performing
[23:54] Miracles is not his final purpose
[23:57] so it's important that we find the
[23:59] purpose of God and here in Ephesians 1
[24:01] it speaks about it just so you know uh
[24:04] picking it up here in verse 3 blessed be
[24:06] the god of our father Lord Jesus Christ
[24:08] who hath blessed us with all spiritual
[24:10] blessings in Heavenly places in Christ
[24:12] Heavenly places is the believer's
[24:14] position standing in Christ according as
[24:17] he has chosen Us in him when that night
[24:19] at the altar
[24:21] no he chose us in him before the
[24:23] foundation of the world that we should
[24:25] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[24:27] love having predestinated us unto the
[24:29] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[24:32] himself according to the good pleasure
[24:33] of our will
[24:36] of his will
[24:37] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[24:39] where he hath made us accepted in the
[24:40] Beloved in whom we have Redemption
[24:42] through the blood the Forgiveness of
[24:44] sins according to the riches of his
[24:46] grace wherein he hath abounded toward us
[24:48] in all wisdom and Prudence having made
[24:50] known unto us the mystery the mystery of
[24:53] his will according to his good pleasure
[24:56] which he hath purposed in himself
[24:59] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[25:02] of times he might gather now we're in
[25:05] our day we're in the dispensation of the
[25:07] fullness of times that he might gather
[25:08] together and want all things in Christ
[25:11] both which are in heaven and which are
[25:13] on earth even in him in whom also we
[25:16] have obtained an inheritance being
[25:18] predestinated according to what
[25:21] according to the purpose of him
[25:24] who worketh all things after the counsel
[25:27] of our will
[25:29] of the government's will
[25:31] he's working everything according oh I
[25:33] like this type of counseling this type
[25:34] of counseling
[25:35] he's working his purpose according to in
[25:39] work of all things after the counsel of
[25:41] his own will what does his will say and
[25:44] he's going to work that and bring his
[25:47] purpose to pass and we're a part of that
[25:49] purpose by predestination how many can
[25:52] raise your hands Thank God I'm a part of
[25:54] his purpose
[25:55] that we should be to the praise of his
[25:56] glory so I want to let you know this is
[25:58] a priority when he's speaking to the
[25:59] Ephesians the purpose of God is priority
[26:02] for believers it's not just the miracles
[26:04] of god it's not just the signs of God
[26:06] it's it's not just heaven in the future
[26:09] but it's what God is showing you in a
[26:12] mystery for your lives right now can you
[26:14] say Amen
[26:15] I had a nice my wife and I had a nice
[26:17] lunch with sister Claire today nice
[26:19] fellowship and I was listening to a song
[26:22] on the way over and asked I figured
[26:24] she'd knew it she did know it it's an
[26:26] older bluegrass gospel song and it says
[26:28] everybody wants to go to heaven but
[26:31] nobody wants to die
[26:33] I thought man that's the good lyric
[26:35] everybody wants to go to heaven but
[26:37] nobody wants to die oh no I don't want
[26:39] to die but everybody wants to go to
[26:40] heaven and they don't want to die
[26:42] physically they're scared of dying
[26:44] because they're not ready to die and
[26:45] people don't want to die to themselves
[26:47] people don't want to die to their own
[26:49] will yet they want to go to heaven but
[26:51] remember Jesus died in the garden before
[26:54] he died on the cross and he died to his
[26:57] own will
[26:58] he had a will can you say amen and he
[27:01] said not my will but thine be done
[27:03] people want to go to heaven but they
[27:05] don't want to die
[27:06] and you can't go to heaven without dying
[27:09] to yourself your mentality your former
[27:12] religious training Paul said I had to
[27:15] consider all my former religious
[27:16] training as dung in order to receive
[27:19] Christ
[27:20] you die to yourself you die to your
[27:21] habits you die to your sin you die for
[27:24] your sinful habits and you die to your
[27:26] former religious training you say God
[27:27] I'm starting from fresh I want to learn
[27:30] of you because I want your purpose from
[27:32] my life somebody say praise the Lord
[27:35] so the purpose of God in Exodus 19 is
[27:39] revealed to the Jews listen now I want
[27:40] you to catch these points
[27:42] the purpose of God in the scriptures
[27:45] that I read is revealed to the Jews
[27:46] before all the Commandments after all
[27:50] the Miracles had been done through the
[27:52] Wilderness and before the laws came
[27:55] right in the middle God gives a few uh a
[27:58] few things he says to the Jews through
[28:01] the prophet
[28:03] that is his purpose revealed and it's a
[28:06] simple hidden purpose of all the
[28:09] Miracles purpose of the law coming
[28:11] is to bring you to myself I'm going to
[28:13] bring these things up because it's
[28:15] revealed right here it's to bring you to
[28:17] myself that's Oneness God says I want to
[28:20] bring you to myself think about all the
[28:22] Commandments and I'm going to talk about
[28:23] how many they are here in just a minute
[28:25] if you don't know think about all the
[28:27] Miracles he did before this before
[28:29] Exodus 19. think about all the
[28:31] Commandments coming down the road in the
[28:33] next few the next 20 chapters is
[28:35] Commandments
[28:37] so you get all these Miracles and you
[28:39] get all these Commandments and right in
[28:40] between just four verses God says to the
[28:43] people but but here here's what it is I
[28:46] did these things and I will do these
[28:48] things that I could bring you
[28:50] to myself
[28:53] that I could be one with you and we know
[28:56] he couldn't fully fulfill that until
[28:58] Jesus went to Calvary you realize that
[29:00] but when he went to Calvary and took
[29:02] care of our sin we could truly become
[29:04] one with Christ
[29:06] how many want to be one with them
[29:08] and so the mystery is that it's Christ
[29:10] in you the hope of glory it's Oneness
[29:12] it's you in Christ becoming one and you
[29:15] may see the Miracles you may see the you
[29:17] may believe and love all the law of God
[29:19] and the word of God instead of the word
[29:20] of God but what's it all for what's the
[29:22] purpose that I could bring you unto
[29:24] myself and Oneness that you could follow
[29:27] my voice and Obey it all along the way
[29:30] and if you do that I will fulfill my
[29:33] purpose in you and he mentions this last
[29:35] thing that he shall be unto me a kingdom
[29:39] of priest I know I won't get to all of
[29:41] this tonight but this opens up a whole
[29:43] nother Revelation I want you to be a
[29:47] kingdom of priests
[29:50] you say well what's that mean it means a
[29:52] lot
[29:54] because remember God God didn't say here
[29:56] my purpose is I want you all to keep
[29:59] watching me do miracles
[30:03] my purpose here is that I'm getting
[30:05] ready to bring you about 20 chapters of
[30:07] laws and I need you to just obey all my
[30:09] laws
[30:10] that's not the full purpose
[30:13] my purpose here is to build a kingdom of
[30:18] priests and that means a couple of
[30:19] things that means that I will bring you
[30:22] into relationship with me a priest has
[30:25] access to God complete access to the
[30:28] inner Chambers and secret of God
[30:33] wait a minute wait a minute we're we're
[30:35] the children of Israel we're two million
[30:37] of us here and we're a group we do this
[30:39] as a group and God says but that's not
[30:41] my purpose
[30:43] I want a whole Kingdom of priests which
[30:46] means every one of you individually
[30:47] brother Josiah sister Hannah brother
[30:50] Kenny
[30:51] he starts to point out names and say I'm
[30:54] going to make you a kingdom a priest
[30:55] that means every one of you individually
[30:57] has access to me
[30:59] has access to my mystery
[31:04] the coming day that I won't have to
[31:06] speak through a prophet anymore
[31:08] I'll start it that way but my final
[31:11] mystery isn't to send a prophet
[31:13] my final purpose is not sending a
[31:16] prophet I use that I will always use
[31:19] that but that's not the final purpose
[31:21] the purpose is I don't want a kingdom of
[31:23] prophets
[31:24] I want a kingdom of people that have
[31:26] access to God
[31:30] the priest is the one that had had
[31:33] uh
[31:34] what do they call that today when you
[31:36] have access so you have a clearance
[31:40] the priests are the ones the only ones
[31:42] that the high priest the only one had
[31:43] clearance into the inner chamber
[31:46] they had it and he's saying I want
[31:49] everybody to have clearance
[31:51] I want a whole Kingdom of ones that have
[31:53] clearance they don't have to go through
[31:54] anybody they have clearance they can go
[31:58] in the inner Veil themselves
[32:00] they can see my secrets I'll tell them
[32:03] my secrets I'll whisper my secrets to
[32:05] them and then they will come in and go
[32:07] out because that's what the priest did
[32:09] and the second part of her priesthood is
[32:11] what's so wonderful they have access to
[32:12] God they can come in the inner Veil but
[32:15] the main part of a priest is he's a
[32:16] mediator between God and humans a priest
[32:19] is a mediator between God and humans and
[32:23] they will go between and they'll go
[32:25] catch the mystery of God and then
[32:26] they'll come back and they'll be able to
[32:28] bring God to the people can you say Amen
[32:31] they'll they'll be able to pray for
[32:34] people and it won't just be the
[32:35] preachers praying for people it won't be
[32:37] the big evangelist everyone will be a
[32:40] priest unto God and have access to God
[32:41] and when they lay hands on the sick
[32:43] they'll recover somebody say praise the
[32:46] Lord
[32:46] you don't have to wait for the pastor to
[32:48] pray for you you don't have to wait for
[32:50] the evangelists for the next convention
[32:52] you don't have to wait you are a priest
[32:55] unto God you have access to God you can
[32:58] lay hands on the sick
[33:01] I think of that little room in the
[33:03] vision that little room I was pointing
[33:04] this way because there was a big tent
[33:06] there was a big following but in the
[33:07] vision he says then I'll meet you in
[33:09] there and it was individuals going
[33:10] through that room nobody knew what
[33:12] happened until they come out the other
[33:13] side and they were healed the lame were
[33:15] healed they come out with healing on the
[33:16] other side you enter that little room
[33:18] privately secret that little place the
[33:20] Bible speaks of it everywhere there's an
[33:22] outer Court to the Tabernacle there's an
[33:23] inner court but then there's the holy of
[33:25] holies that only the high priest could
[33:26] come in can you say Amen we are our
[33:29] three-part Temple outer Court inner
[33:31] court and then our souls can you say
[33:32] Amen where God comes in the soul I
[33:35] believe Believers need to live from the
[33:37] soul not their flesh but live from the
[33:39] soul
[33:40] Jesus said when you pray he says don't
[33:42] pray openly like that go to your father
[33:44] in secret in a closet it's all speaking
[33:47] of the Bride coming into that secret
[33:50] place and she's the only one that has
[33:52] clearance to do it
[33:54] think about it friends think about it I
[33:56] want a whole Kingdom of not prophets not
[33:59] laborers not workers not chair stackers
[34:06] not just chair stackers not laborers
[34:09] I want a kingdom of priest
[34:14] and he don't give age groups I'd like
[34:17] some 14 15 year old that come to their
[34:20] place in position and they can get
[34:22] access to God at 14 years old
[34:24] there's no age on it
[34:26] baptized we got a baptism coming this a
[34:29] young girl that we've been praying for
[34:31] in this assembly and and I've been
[34:33] praying for all the young people that
[34:35] they'd be baptized and filled with the
[34:36] Holy Ghost and it's going to happen it's
[34:38] going to happen those who don't have the
[34:40] Holy Ghost is going to receive it it's
[34:41] going to be baptized this Sunday by the
[34:42] grace of God praise the Lord
[34:47] amen so so you see now that it's a
[34:51] mediator and so we want to take some
[34:54] time on that at another time my my
[34:55] subject tonight is the purpose behind
[34:58] and so I want to look at this the
[35:00] Miracles was not the final purpose the
[35:03] laws were not the final purpose but
[35:05] sandwiched in between this is what he
[35:07] will do if we will follow his voice
[35:09] remember that voice came through his
[35:11] prophet in that day that voice come
[35:13] through his Prophet what he wanted to
[35:15] say to the people came through the
[35:16] prophet
[35:17] and so if that that history repeats
[35:20] itself I was saying something Sunday
[35:22] that if you don't believe that the that
[35:24] the Bible can repeat itself and God can
[35:26] do the same thing again just like a
[35:28] Miracles there's a lot of denominations
[35:30] that say God did that in the book of
[35:32] Acts but he can't do that again you
[35:33] don't have a right to say that whatever
[35:35] God did in the Bible he can do it
[35:36] tonight
[35:38] whatever God did in the Bible he can do
[35:41] tonight whatever it is and you don't
[35:44] have a right to say that he can't
[35:46] but it's not just Miracles they can do
[35:49] tonight but God can repeat what he did
[35:51] in past history by sending a prophet and
[35:54] then that Prophet brings the word and
[35:56] then that people get a hold of the word
[35:57] and God begins to build from there he's
[36:00] done the same thing in the end time he
[36:02] prophesied Elijah Malachi 45 and zinc he
[36:05] said it would happen again I'll speak
[36:07] through my Elijah in the end time and
[36:09] that'll bring the people back to the
[36:11] original faith God doesn't change his
[36:12] pattern and history will repeat itself
[36:15] Jesus said history will repeat itself he
[36:17] says in the days in the coming of the
[36:19] son of man he was the son of man but he
[36:21] says there'll be another repeat to the
[36:22] Gentiles of the son of man Ministry
[36:25] past Bible times it's still Bible times
[36:27] but past the Book of John because I even
[36:29] talked to somebody the other day it's
[36:30] like when it comes up to the Book of
[36:32] John the revelations that's it I only
[36:33] believe what's in here well there's
[36:35] prophecies in here that go beyond John
[36:37] being on the hour Pappas that God will
[36:39] repeat himself again God will restore in
[36:42] the end time
[36:44] so don't put limitations on God
[36:47] history repeats itself God can repeat
[36:49] himself and we shouldn't put limitations
[36:51] on him so now I've got to get to this if
[36:53] you're looking at this setting in Acts
[36:55] 19 Acts 19 we come through countless
[36:58] Mighty displays of the supernatural God
[37:01] but that didn't make each of them
[37:04] one by seeing the supernatural did not
[37:08] make them priests unto God
[37:12] didn't bring him to the purpose yet
[37:15] they weren't there yet
[37:17] I mean he's gonna he's showed me many
[37:20] miracles he's going to give them a big
[37:23] law
[37:24] with details in it and then the purpose
[37:27] will be is that Moses will fade out and
[37:29] they're going to come into their
[37:30] promised land and they'll step up on
[37:32] their own feet by faith and say I've got
[37:34] a piece of land here I'm going to fight
[37:36] the Devils until I get it it's my land
[37:41] that's the purpose can you say Amen
[37:43] what's my land
[37:45] what's my place in Christ
[37:48] the promised land does not represent
[37:50] heaven
[37:51] when we get there someday as much as it
[37:53] represents our life in the Holy Ghost
[37:57] that's what the problem is so now you
[37:59] just begin your journey when you get the
[38:00] Holy Ghost because now Satan I'm here
[38:04] Satan
[38:06] wake up because I'm awake
[38:09] wake up and smell the coffee Satan I'm
[38:12] here I've recognized my position I got
[38:14] faith I don't care about the Giants I
[38:17] don't care about the big walled cities I
[38:19] don't care I'm not a grasshopper I'm a
[38:22] giant I'm bigger than that giant I found
[38:24] my place and I'm gonna go take my land
[38:26] and Caleb Caleb even was an old man he
[38:30] says I'm old I've been in this thing
[38:32] from the beginning but I'm not going
[38:34] until I take my Mountain I'm getting my
[38:37] Mountain because God gave it to me
[38:41] every person no matter what age if
[38:43] you're 78 years old or 15 years old I'll
[38:46] be saying God hasn't land for me and I'm
[38:49] going to stand up and take it
[38:51] God has a life of the Holy Ghost for me
[38:54] so many young people say oh I'll get
[38:55] that later I want to have one of soul my
[38:57] Wild Oats don't sow any Wild Oats get a
[39:00] hold of Christ now
[39:02] look what you can do for the Kingdom
[39:04] right now
[39:07] take my land right now I'm gonna I'm not
[39:10] going to give the devil 10 years of my
[39:12] life to just wreak havoc in me I'm
[39:14] getting hold of this thing right now
[39:15] right now I'm going to be a David at 14
[39:18] 15 years old
[39:20] I'm gonna stand for things I'm gonna get
[39:23] filled with the spirit
[39:24] I'm an 18 year old girl I'm gonna be
[39:26] filled with the spirit of God and find
[39:28] his purpose for my life
[39:30] and by the way the purpose isn't just
[39:32] finding a husband you know
[39:34] I know a lot of 18 year olds think
[39:36] that's the deal and it is important and
[39:39] it is and God will do that but the first
[39:40] thing you need to say what is God's
[39:42] purpose for my life
[39:44] what can I do for his kingdom right now
[39:48] praise the Lord somebody praise the Lord
[39:50] somebody
[39:52] amen
[39:54] so now
[39:56] it wasn't it wasn't the Miracles that
[39:59] made them priests after this God gives
[40:01] the law so now we got the Miracles now
[40:03] let's talk about this law because this
[40:04] is amazing today to realize after God
[40:07] gives this purpose in four verses
[40:09] there's about 20 chapters packed full of
[40:12] details
[40:14] 613 laws
[40:17] 613 detailed laws details for his people
[40:22] how to live
[40:25] and they they trickled down to really
[40:27] they it was Ten Commandments but then it
[40:29] broke into ten was only it was only 10
[40:32] of the 613. the first 10 was only 10 of
[40:35] the 630 so it wasn't just 10 but it was
[40:38] the details after the Ten Commandments
[40:41] broke into a total of 613 laws covered
[40:44] covering everything that the people
[40:46] would know how to live that the people
[40:48] would know how to be covered that the
[40:50] people would know how to be protected uh
[40:53] and from uh from it I tell you friends I
[40:57] don't have time to understand it was so
[40:58] detailed from what day to work on
[41:02] what day not to work on
[41:05] to sexual perversion to pornography well
[41:09] I don't remember him mentioning
[41:10] pornography in the Ten Commandments yeah
[41:13] two of them address pornography
[41:16] must have been pretty important that he
[41:18] addressed the lust of women in
[41:20] pornography
[41:21] you think the Ten Commandments are not
[41:23] relevant today he dedicated two of them
[41:27] to this
[41:28] don't covet your neighbor's wife which
[41:31] is some other woman besides your own
[41:32] wife
[41:34] and don't commit adultery
[41:37] it covers everything to the protection
[41:40] of genders to keep the genders the same
[41:44] and to keep them dressing different so
[41:46] that we would know which one is which
[41:51] the law covered it it and how did God
[41:54] know that they were going to be tested
[41:56] and all these how do because God knows
[41:58] everything and he loved the people
[41:59] enough to put his laws out there to say
[42:02] you're going to be tested they're going
[42:03] to question your gender they're going to
[42:05] question who you are and so I want you
[42:06] to be distinctly male and female like I
[42:09] made you and I want you to dress
[42:11] different like I made you
[42:14] it's going to address what day to work
[42:16] on it's going to address the Fabrics
[42:19] it's going to address that a woman that
[42:21] that uh that even kids that are
[42:23] disobedient to their parents could
[42:25] possibly be stoned
[42:28] you see now now we get into some sticky
[42:30] areas
[42:31] it's like uh I don't know about a God
[42:34] Like That Stone a woman that's found in
[42:37] adultery to stoner
[42:40] it gets quiet
[42:42] it's the same God you worship tonight
[42:45] that wrote those laws
[42:48] hello the same God you lifted your hands
[42:51] to is the same God that wrote all those
[42:52] laws
[42:57] 613 laws
[43:00] did anybody feel overwhelmed
[43:04] it's like oh boy
[43:06] that's a lot
[43:09] yeah it is a lot
[43:11] and if you're looking at it wrong you're
[43:12] going to say
[43:14] that's a lot brother Paul
[43:16] 16 no the the ten you know the 10 was
[43:20] one thing
[43:21] and I can just barely squeeze out those
[43:23] now we're talking 613 laws
[43:26] uh I feel like what James said and look
[43:29] at the pressure James said in James
[43:31] chapter 2 verse 8 he said if you fulfill
[43:34] the Royal law according to the
[43:35] scriptures the Royal law this comes from
[43:37] the Old Testament thou shall love thy
[43:39] neighbor as thyself he do well but if
[43:41] you have respect or persons you commit
[43:43] sin and are convinced of the law as
[43:44] transgressors for whosoever shall keep
[43:47] the whole law and yet offend in one
[43:50] point he's guilty of the whole thing
[43:51] great
[43:54] I got 613 laws here to deal with and
[43:57] James says reminding me that I could do
[44:00] the whole thing and fail in one it's as
[44:02] if I failed in all of them that's
[44:04] exactly right
[44:05] because God wants you to fail in
[44:07] yourself
[44:11] but why do you give so many things
[44:13] there's two ways they go look at it one
[44:18] God sure makes things impossible
[44:21] he hates me I know he hates me
[44:25] 613 God sure makes things totally
[44:29] impossible for anybody to do right you
[44:32] can look at it that way it's like one
[44:34] kid said years ago
[44:35] back of the old church years ago over
[44:37] there on Brown Street
[44:40] looked at me and said every time I turn
[44:42] around here there's another rule that
[44:44] you make up brother Paul you're just
[44:46] making them up as you go along
[44:49] rebellious young teenager still not
[44:52] serving the lord today because if you
[44:53] take that mentality towards the word of
[44:56] God and towards instruction into
[44:57] boundaries there's no end to that can
[45:00] you say Amen you will always view God is
[45:02] that he hates me because he's just
[45:04] coming up with more rules all the time
[45:06] every time I turn around here there's
[45:08] another rule
[45:10] he's coming back though I believe it
[45:14] you can look at it that way
[45:16] or
[45:17] you could look at it like this that God
[45:20] cares
[45:21] and knows about every detail of my life
[45:29] you can look at it that way that God
[45:30] cares and that he would give his people
[45:33] details about every little area of her
[45:37] life that should tell us he knows about
[45:39] every area of our life he knows what
[45:41] will be tempted in before
[45:44] and no temptation is come to man that's
[45:47] been common to man that with every
[45:49] Temptation he will make a way of Escape
[45:51] because he knows what it is in other
[45:54] words he knows what you're going to
[45:55] experience so God puts his word out
[45:57] there ahead of time so that you and you
[45:59] discovered it I didn't know this was
[46:01] going to happen I don't know I didn't
[46:02] know this was going to happen well God
[46:04] knew it was going to happen and he put
[46:06] it in his word and he loved you and gave
[46:08] every detail
[46:09] to warn you
[46:11] so it's all in how you look at it can
[46:13] you say Amen
[46:14] now man tries to remove it all
[46:17] uh
[46:18] they try to remove all these
[46:20] Commandments even some denominational
[46:22] systems we're not going to go with the
[46:24] law anymore the old testament's no good
[46:26] and brother Stephen's Drew had a
[46:28] wonderful message that you can't dump
[46:30] out New Testament or Old Testament
[46:31] because they they hold everything
[46:33] together
[46:34] they're a revelation to Jesus Christ the
[46:36] whole thing can you say Amen but there
[46:39] is a lot of systems and people that dump
[46:40] out say I just want the Jesus of Grace
[46:42] that starts in gen it starts in Matthew
[46:45] and I want the Jesus of Grace and they
[46:47] dump out the the Old Testament they dump
[46:49] out the law they try to they try to
[46:51] remove even the Ten Commandments today
[46:53] you know it's like there was a uh there
[46:55] was a sign on the church that says
[46:57] special this week observe any eight of
[46:59] the Ten Commandments
[47:03] many denominational systems have ditched
[47:06] all the Old Testament it's only Grace
[47:08] now Jesus why do they do this
[47:12] here's the reason why you say well they
[47:14] just want to live the some just want to
[47:15] live there but why do they want it
[47:17] because it's so confusing and it's too
[47:19] overwhelming to live on their own it's
[47:22] too much and and you know what the
[47:24] biggest reasons they don't see the
[47:27] mystery and purpose of God
[47:30] and that's what I said at the beginning
[47:31] of this message not seeing God's final
[47:34] purpose in all of it will cause you to
[47:37] be confused
[47:39] about why he said it
[47:42] you must catch the mystery of God
[47:46] the purpose of God
[47:48] can you say Amen
[47:51] that's why I said well I read last
[47:53] Wednesday night
[47:54] why do you hunger why do you thirst
[47:55] church it's the father trying to get
[47:57] this hidden secret to you it's
[47:59] everything it's everything but you'll
[48:01] let so many things get out you let your
[48:03] job you let precious cares of life but
[48:05] their father's trying to get something
[48:06] to you because once you catch that once
[48:09] that happens game over for the devil
[48:12] I said game over for the devil
[48:15] game over for him using depression
[48:18] listen how far do we want to go with the
[48:20] world today they released it 17 percent
[48:23] of Americans now are being treated for
[48:25] clinical depression 70 it's real it's
[48:28] just bursted even since covet so now I'm
[48:31] not here to to put that down I'm just
[48:33] saying that we have to have something
[48:35] greater and deeper because we want to
[48:37] continue to be a part of that statistic
[48:39] that's the way the world goes that's the
[48:42] way that's the only Direction because
[48:43] there's no hope but we have a hope in
[48:45] Jesus Christ we have an anchor in Jesus
[48:47] Christ we have a balm in Gilead can you
[48:50] say amen I don't want to be a part of
[48:52] that and sometimes I've had depression
[48:53] and been apart but I'm not a part of a
[48:55] statistic that keeps growing
[48:58] that's a pretty big number 17 of
[49:00] Americans and it continues to grow I
[49:02] don't want to be a part of that I want
[49:03] to find my balm in Gilead I want to take
[49:05] my depression to the Lord
[49:10] praise the Lord
[49:12] so why do they do this they don't see
[49:14] the mystery of God the purpose of God
[49:15] the mystery of Christ if they did if if
[49:18] they've seen the mystery of Christ and
[49:20] that's why it's so important to all of
[49:21] its friends if they've seen the mystery
[49:24] of Christ
[49:25] they'd never eliminate
[49:27] the word of God
[49:29] look at what Jesus said you say well
[49:31] we'll get rid of the Old Testament we'll
[49:32] just destroy it no no Jesus said I come
[49:35] not to destroy the law
[49:38] so why are you destroying it
[49:40] when Jesus said you don't destroy it
[49:43] I don't come to destroy the law it all
[49:45] has significance and meaning and types
[49:48] I came to fulfill it
[49:51] see the power of the mystery of Christ
[49:55] coming to your life and you connecting
[49:57] with it comes into a different level
[49:59] than just living do's and don'ts
[50:04] it's a different level than just the law
[50:07] and God is the god of laws and if I can
[50:09] just abide by the laws and do my best
[50:11] hopefully I'll make it and Jesus said I
[50:15] didn't come to destroy them but I came
[50:16] to fulfill it I'm bringing the power of
[50:18] the Holy Ghost to fulfill this in you
[50:21] that you become a kingdom a priest
[50:25] so I got a little part here that I
[50:27] probably will end on here tonight we'll
[50:29] pick this up again but I just thought if
[50:31] you feel overwhelmed by 613 laws all
[50:34] right
[50:36] because we're to live this you know
[50:37] we're to live this and uh I just thought
[50:40] I would help you a little bit tonight
[50:41] because we know that we narrow it down
[50:43] from 613 to 10 Commandments
[50:47] first 10 are part of the 613 so we can
[50:50] narrow it down to 10. then Jesus himself
[50:52] says in Matthew 22 35
[50:55] Matthew 22 35 I'm assuming this is my
[50:58] water from Sunday
[51:03] and then nobody else drank out of it
[51:05] like the church cleaners or somebody
[51:09] Look what Jesus said in about the laws
[51:11] Matthew 22 35 then one of them which was
[51:13] a lawyer
[51:14] oh boy red flags up already
[51:17] one of them which was a lawyer asked him
[51:19] a question tempting him so a lawyer is
[51:21] going to ask Jesus A Question Master
[51:23] which is the great commandment in the
[51:25] law
[51:26] so you got 613
[51:28] Narrows down to 10.
[51:30] and he's tempting Jesus saying which is
[51:32] the greatest of all the Commandments the
[51:35] Commandment of the law Jesus said unto
[51:36] him Thou shalt love the Lord thy God
[51:39] with all thy heart and with all thy soul
[51:41] and with all thy mind
[51:43] this the this is the first and great
[51:46] commandment
[51:48] and by the way that's not technically in
[51:50] the tin that's just something else God
[51:52] said but he's pulling the mystery out of
[51:54] it saying there's a mystery that if you
[51:57] love if you love the Lord God like I
[52:00] said from the beginning when even when
[52:02] he started when the people coming out of
[52:04] Egypt love the Lord thy God with all
[52:06] your heart soul mind and strength he's
[52:08] making that a Commandment that it's
[52:10] actually he's going to draw out too now
[52:12] neither of them are in the ten
[52:14] commandments so I'm just trying to make
[52:15] you feel better
[52:16] if you're feeling the pressure of 613
[52:19] Jesus himself here says now I'm going to
[52:21] bring it down to two aren't you just
[52:23] feeling relieved already
[52:26] I was sweating there
[52:28] here's here it is thou shall love the
[52:30] Lord thy God with all thy heart with all
[52:32] thy soul with all thy mind this is the
[52:34] first and great commandment and the
[52:36] second is like unto it Thou shalt love
[52:38] thy neighbor as thyself so Jesus took it
[52:42] all and he nariled it down to two and
[52:44] guess what he's he's definitely got he's
[52:47] definitely bringing the mystery because
[52:48] if somebody by the Holy Ghost lived
[52:51] these two out you're going to live the
[52:53] rest of it as well
[52:55] if you have the reality of loving God
[52:58] that way with all your heart so mind and
[53:01] strength I'm sold out Lock Stock and
[53:04] Barrel I'm filled with the spirit of God
[53:06] and I'm loving with the Divine love of
[53:08] my neighbor no matter what he does to me
[53:10] all the other Commandments how could you
[53:13] commit adultery on your wife if you love
[53:15] God that way
[53:16] [Music]
[53:18] there's no way you could do it how could
[53:20] you kill somebody How Can you steal from
[53:22] somebody you're not going to do any of
[53:24] that because why you you love your
[53:26] neighbor as yourself
[53:27] [Applause]
[53:29] so we come from 6 13 down to 10 and down
[53:33] to two now guess what it gets better
[53:36] if you're still nervous on these two
[53:38] Commandments he says hang all of the law
[53:41] and the prophets on these two
[53:42] Commandments hang all the law and the
[53:45] prophets
[53:47] I love that I love it I love it because
[53:50] see if you only read the Old Testament
[53:52] and went from Exodus 19 and read the
[53:54] next 20 chapters of the details of the
[53:56] law you're going to be saying you should
[53:58] be saying there's a reason God says this
[54:00] I want to catch the meaning and the type
[54:02] and all that but if you don't look at
[54:04] that what you're going to be saying I
[54:05] will never be able to do all this this
[54:07] is confusing to me this gets muddy God
[54:10] why are you asking us to do all this
[54:13] but you got to have the mystery the
[54:15] purpose
[54:16] now Christ starts to break the
[54:18] fulfilling of the law
[54:20] he says love him with all your heart
[54:21] soul mind and strength and he says on
[54:24] all these two Commandments hang all of
[54:26] the law on the prophets I love that I
[54:28] love that
[54:29] but when Paul goes to sharing and Paul
[54:32] if you're visiting online tonight or
[54:36] on the broadcast you're watching later
[54:38] on
[54:39] or your visitor here tonight
[54:42] Paul is the first one in the Bible can I
[54:44] have about 10 more minutes
[54:46] thank you that was enough for me
[54:49] Paul was the first one in the Bible who
[54:52] uses the term the mystery of Christ
[54:56] okay
[54:57] we know who Christ was in the four
[54:59] gospels he came and lived 33 years he
[55:02] did Miracles and he said what he said
[55:04] and we know that the four gospels
[55:06] there's some denominations they don't
[55:07] want the Old Testament and some of them
[55:09] don't even want the New Testament they
[55:11] just want the four gospels that's all
[55:12] they want and sometimes only the red
[55:14] letters because that's what Jesus spoke
[55:15] they said no there's a lot more that
[55:17] Jesus spoke in the Bible than the red
[55:19] letters
[55:21] but
[55:22] Paul begins to break this thing called
[55:25] the mystery of Christ so it's not just
[55:27] that you know Jesus that walked on the
[55:29] shores of Galilee 2000 years ago that's
[55:31] not enough there's a mystery that's in
[55:33] Christ
[55:34] there's something hidden kind of like
[55:36] there was a mystery in Adam before Eve
[55:39] was brought out of Adam Eve was the
[55:42] mystery within Adam that nobody could
[55:44] see
[55:45] and just like Christ there was a mystery
[55:48] in Christ that nobody could see Paul's
[55:50] going to break something deeper than
[55:52] just talking as a matter of fact Paul
[55:54] was not even there like the rest of the
[55:57] disciples that's why they kind of didn't
[55:58] like him and we're hesitant of them
[56:00] because we're the twelve that was with
[56:01] them we fished with them we ate with
[56:03] them we we fed the five thousand with
[56:06] them we've seen him we were chosen by
[56:08] him Paul
[56:10] he never seen Jesus physically
[56:14] but he's seen Jesus in a pillar of Fire
[56:18] in a light that come over him
[56:20] so there's nobody can say he didn't see
[56:22] Jesus he just seen Jesus in another form
[56:25] they said where has it in him he hasn't
[56:27] and so but here's the way the prophet
[56:29] said it he said Paul had something that
[56:33] the disciples didn't even have
[56:35] yes he was going to be given to preach
[56:38] the mystery of Christ not just Christ of
[56:41] the 33 and a half years
[56:43] there's something deeper and then John
[56:46] on the alpapness he writes the
[56:48] revelation of Christ which is somebody
[56:50] corrected me a few weeks ago I said the
[56:52] revelations of Christ it's not called
[56:54] the revelations of Christ it's called
[56:55] the revelation of Christ
[56:57] so it's all one Revelation it's one
[56:59] revealing of Christ
[57:01] even all the symbols and Revelations is
[57:04] to reveal one person Christ
[57:06] but uh and thank you for that correction
[57:08] whoever did that that's exactly right
[57:10] but Paul's Paul John on our promise he
[57:12] calls it
[57:13] not Jesus Christ I'm not going to talk
[57:15] John was with Jesus he could have talked
[57:17] about those days with Jesus but he's
[57:18] going to preach he's going to bring the
[57:20] by Vision the revelation of Christ the
[57:22] Revelation so you have the mystery of
[57:24] Christ you have the revelation of Christ
[57:26] and that's what you start to get into in
[57:28] the New Testament as Paul starts to
[57:29] break this and most the Jews rejected it
[57:31] said no this is it we've so the
[57:33] Christian the Christian Jews who came to
[57:36] Christ knew him only by the Flesh and
[57:39] knew his what he did and went to Calgary
[57:40] which is all fine but Paul's going to
[57:42] break something even deeper than that
[57:43] what came out of Calvary what came out
[57:45] of the Resurrection what's the power
[57:47] that came out of that what's what's it
[57:49] bringing us to can you say Amen what's
[57:51] the purpose of God what's the purpose of
[57:53] calvary
[57:55] and so here he begins introduces and
[57:58] while he's bringing that mystery of
[58:00] Christ
[58:01] to help us all see what how many laws we
[58:04] have to live he introduces one law
[58:08] and that's the law of the spirit of life
[58:14] the law
[58:16] of the spirit
[58:17] of life
[58:19] that the answer is being filled
[58:22] with the Holy Ghost
[58:27] and living this thing
[58:29] by one law
[58:30] That's the Law of the spirit
[58:34] and what Jesus said was right I'm not
[58:36] knocking it that we love the Lord with
[58:38] all heart soul mind and strength but you
[58:40] see a person can try to do that without
[58:43] the law of the spirit the Holy Ghost in
[58:45] him he could be a passionate I'm going
[58:47] to do this thing I'm going to love God
[58:48] with my heart out I'm going to become a
[58:50] missionary and I'm going to give my life
[58:52] to missionary work and just do it
[58:53] passionately and and God will have
[58:55] rewards for that I'm not going to knock
[58:56] a guy like that but listen now you could
[58:58] do all that and you can love your
[59:00] neighbor as yourself without the spirit
[59:02] of life and so now he's narrowing it
[59:04] down there's a law of the spirit of life
[59:06] he narrows it down to one and once we
[59:09] have that mystery of Christ Living in US
[59:11] it comes down to living that from the
[59:14] depths of our soul and when we're living
[59:16] from that law of Life all of the
[59:19] expression of everything that he wanted
[59:21] to express as a kingdom of priests comes
[59:23] out of that law of life that's living in
[59:25] you
[59:27] the new birth is a revelation of Jesus
[59:29] Christ personally to you can you say
[59:31] Amen
[59:32] you have crossed into the secret of
[59:34] living it's kind of like the priests are
[59:36] given clearance and acceptance in the
[59:39] inner Veil you've crossed into that
[59:40] secret by the Holy Ghost into the secret
[59:42] of living into that Kingdom you are
[59:44] invited on the inside track into the
[59:46] inner Veil Galatians 5 14 says for all
[59:49] the laws fulfilled in one word even this
[59:51] Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[59:53] but Romans 8 2 says for the law of the
[59:56] spirit of life in Christ Jesus that's
[59:59] the other law he's talking about the law
[1:00:01] of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus
[1:00:03] hath made us free from the law of sin
[1:00:07] and death what a law that's the law that
[1:00:10] I want to live by that's the law that I
[1:00:11] want living in me because it's so
[1:00:13] powerful he says it makes us free from
[1:00:17] the law of sin and death you realize
[1:00:20] that all the laws had to be created
[1:00:22] because of our sin
[1:00:25] do you realize that every one of the Ten
[1:00:28] Commandments is in a direct answer from
[1:00:30] God to the sin that was living already
[1:00:32] within us
[1:00:33] that because of sin we have the
[1:00:35] potential to commit adultery because of
[1:00:37] sin we have the potential to see oh I
[1:00:38] would never do that well it's in you to
[1:00:40] do it
[1:00:41] the serpent nature you're born with
[1:00:44] there's a law working in you to sin even
[1:00:47] if you are encouraged to do it you're
[1:00:49] going to eventually do it
[1:00:51] and every 10 of the all every one of the
[1:00:54] laws but if you take the Ten
[1:00:55] Commandments
[1:00:57] every one of us to address something
[1:00:59] that's going to come out of us
[1:01:01] and to keep it in check
[1:01:06] not coming into the rest of the Sabbath
[1:01:08] we're going to violate that
[1:01:10] we're going to run away from it all of
[1:01:12] them are to address something of Sinners
[1:01:14] but this law says this law says the law
[1:01:17] of the spirit of Life hath made me free
[1:01:21] from the law of sin and death
[1:01:24] oh Lord
[1:01:26] let me live by this law let me let this
[1:01:29] law live in me
[1:01:31] can you say Amen only the priest can
[1:01:33] come in the Intervale the secret place
[1:01:36] only the priest can be given access to
[1:01:37] the mystery of God by the holy ghost
[1:01:39] ever and and to come out and listen a
[1:01:43] priest with access to the mystery of God
[1:01:45] by the Holy Ghost will never come out
[1:01:48] hating the law of God
[1:01:50] you can never come out of that presence
[1:01:52] of the Lord and that experience and have
[1:01:54] the spirit of the law of life you can
[1:01:56] never come out of hating the word or
[1:01:58] hating God
[1:01:59] can someone who has the chance to know
[1:02:01] the author of a book personally ever
[1:02:04] hate the book that they wrote
[1:02:07] not likely
[1:02:09] they get to live with them they like to
[1:02:11] be with them
[1:02:12] they get to know his nature and then
[1:02:14] when they go to the re read the book
[1:02:16] they understand why he wrote it that way
[1:02:18] because they've been around him for
[1:02:20] months or years
[1:02:22] most of the time they'll never turn
[1:02:23] against that author because why they're
[1:02:26] not going to just read a book and not
[1:02:28] understand they personally have been
[1:02:29] given access to the author of the book
[1:02:34] you can never have a priest of God with
[1:02:37] the Holy Ghost in that inner secret
[1:02:39] place with Christ in relationship with
[1:02:41] him come out of that it'll never happen
[1:02:44] that they'll hate God or hate this word
[1:02:46] that's why he says the evidence of the
[1:02:49] Holy Ghost is saying Amen to every word
[1:02:52] of God
[1:02:53] you'll never have the Holy Ghost
[1:02:54] resisting it it's like oh I'm doing that
[1:02:56] no not the Holy Ghost because that's the
[1:02:58] author that wrote it
[1:03:00] it'll always respond with a amen
[1:03:09] God completes his purpose for this
[1:03:13] brother's life
[1:03:14] and when that purpose is complete in his
[1:03:16] life and he catches that mystery he can
[1:03:19] never come out of it playing the victim
[1:03:20] anymore
[1:03:25] no he'll say what was meant for evil
[1:03:28] God meant for good
[1:03:31] he can never come out of an abuse victim
[1:03:33] the rest of his life of victim mentality
[1:03:35] said I've been abused my whole life I'm
[1:03:37] continually being abused not when you
[1:03:39] come into this mystery
[1:03:41] there's no way
[1:03:43] he's going to say like Joseph what was
[1:03:45] meant for evil for my brothers was
[1:03:46] intender for good God's good good
[1:03:49] purpose was meant for that in that
[1:03:51] secret place God shows you all things
[1:03:53] work together to the good
[1:03:56] can you say Amen to those who this is
[1:04:00] the only result that comes out of
[1:04:01] catching the mystery of God all things
[1:04:03] work together for the good to them that
[1:04:05] love God and that are called according
[1:04:09] to
[1:04:10] his purpose he's caught the purpose
[1:04:13] he's got the mystery you can never get
[1:04:16] an abuse victim that continues I'm
[1:04:18] continuing no it's over it's done it's
[1:04:20] finished
[1:04:22] because they've seen their place in
[1:04:23] Christ
[1:04:25] called us to his purpose not just a
[1:04:27] miracle not just the law and Paul speaks
[1:04:29] of the mystery of Christ something
[1:04:31] secret something in there that he's
[1:04:32] wanting to speak to you
[1:04:34] and we get to the end time where he says
[1:04:36] time no longer no more delay I'm going
[1:04:39] to reveal it to you you can never have
[1:04:42] and we'll go on with this a little bit
[1:04:44] when I get another Wednesday night of
[1:04:45] what this Kingdom of priest is but I'm
[1:04:47] so stirred in my heart to realize that's
[1:04:51] the purpose is to get us that a people
[1:04:54] that we have access to God and that we
[1:04:57] are the mediator
[1:05:01] between human
[1:05:02] 's
[1:05:04] and God
[1:05:06] there's you know when you have a lawyer
[1:05:08] that's a mediator it's parties that are
[1:05:10] disagreeing and at audits with one
[1:05:11] another so you call a mediator and you
[1:05:13] mediate so it doesn't have to go to
[1:05:15] court he sits with you and said let's
[1:05:17] let's try to come up with something so
[1:05:19] this goes back to the word priest
[1:05:21] because you have access to to the
[1:05:24] presence of God you have access to him
[1:05:25] you bring the word out of there and now
[1:05:28] someone who's in hatred towards God
[1:05:30] someone who resents God say no no you're
[1:05:33] seeing it wrong and I'm going to try to
[1:05:35] bring reconciliation and bring them back
[1:05:37] to God because how how more perfect
[1:05:40] you've been on both sides you've been in
[1:05:42] the world you've been bitter you may be
[1:05:44] been abused but that's not all you are
[1:05:47] you've been in the presence of God
[1:05:49] you're you're a high priest unto God
[1:05:51] you're a priest unto God and so now when
[1:05:53] you go back and forth you've got
[1:05:54] something to say like me laying hands on
[1:05:56] that that lady the other day and praying
[1:05:58] and God stepping in like that way he did
[1:06:01] I just
[1:06:02] I just want this working in my life
[1:06:04] friends I want this third pole working
[1:06:06] in my life Simplicity can you say Amen
[1:06:10] I'm going to close with so much more to
[1:06:12] say we'll pick it up again but God's
[1:06:15] called us as purposes to call us not to
[1:06:17] see another miracle not to push for that
[1:06:19] not even to live by a law if you're
[1:06:22] living this message by law if this
[1:06:24] message is a law to you you haven't
[1:06:26] caught the mystery of Christ yet and you
[1:06:28] can never leave it you can never leave
[1:06:30] it if you've caught the mystery of
[1:06:31] Christ within it this message is a
[1:06:33] revealing of Jesus Christ
[1:06:35] can you say Amen
[1:06:37] and I'm I want to be an influence of one
[1:06:39] of those guys I walked into Costco the
[1:06:41] other day and there was a young boy that
[1:06:42] was a little boy in my church
[1:06:44] and I've been talking to him there in
[1:06:46] Costco me and my wife
[1:06:48] and I don't think he's serving the lord
[1:06:50] and all that but
[1:06:52] um I was just trying to get in
[1:06:55] uh and I didn't have my card and so the
[1:06:58] manager his manager he's a manager his
[1:07:00] manager stopped me said well who's this
[1:07:01] and he said hey you can let him in he
[1:07:03] said this was my pastor when I was a
[1:07:05] little boy
[1:07:06] said you got in he says this is a man of
[1:07:09] God you can let him in
[1:07:11] now he hasn't been to church he hasn't
[1:07:13] been around but he has respect and guess
[1:07:15] what I'm glad that he has that
[1:07:18] impression
[1:07:19] that this was a man whatever happened
[1:07:22] and I know the family but that's I'm not
[1:07:25] talking about that something is still in
[1:07:27] that boy's heart to have enough respect
[1:07:29] to say this is a man of God
[1:07:32] praise the Lord that's what we want to
[1:07:34] leave them accepting or whatever they do
[1:07:36] that's between them and God that's not
[1:07:38] up to me but I want to leave an
[1:07:40] impression in this world don't you want
[1:07:42] to leave an impression in this world I'm
[1:07:44] not just another statistic I'm a priest
[1:07:47] of God I have access to God when I pray
[1:07:50] for you I believe something's going to
[1:07:51] happen not because of me because I got
[1:07:53] the Holy Ghost

[1:08:03] another day but listen I'm going to
[1:08:04] believe something good is going to
[1:08:05] happen God's going to turn things around
[1:08:07] because why we have access to our Lord
[1:08:09] we have access to his presence
[1:08:12] let's stop letting the devil belittle us
[1:08:15] into something that we're not some false
[1:08:18] today let's stand who we are in Jesus
