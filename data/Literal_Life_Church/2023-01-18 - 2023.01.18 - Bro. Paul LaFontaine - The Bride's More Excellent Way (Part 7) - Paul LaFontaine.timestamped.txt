[0:00] 13 and we had a little section there
[0:02] that we were talking about tonight the
[0:05] last part of the at the attributes of
[0:07] divine love but this series is called
[0:09] the bride's more excellent way and so
[0:12] we've been going through these
[0:13] characteristics and uh we want to talk
[0:17] about these tonight out of verse 7.
[0:20] Divine love beareth all things believeth
[0:23] all things
[0:25] hope with all things
[0:27] endureth all things read it again Divine
[0:31] love beareth all things believeth all
[0:33] things hope with all things
[0:35] endureth all things I want to add a
[0:39] couple scriptures to that in First
[0:40] Corinthians chapter 15 if you don't mind
[0:42] First Corinthians 15 and verse 57
[0:48] but thanks be to God which giveth us the
[0:53] victory through our Lord Jesus Christ
[0:55] are you glad tonight that he gives you
[0:57] the victory
[0:58] in the battles of the Lord if he fights
[1:00] our battles there's always a victory
[1:02] amen and then it says in second
[1:04] Corinthians chapter 2 a similar thing
[1:06] that we want to add second Corinthians
[1:08] chapter 2 and verse 14.
[1:11] second Corinthians 2 and verse 14. now
[1:13] thanks be unto God which always causeth
[1:17] us to Triumph in Christ and maketh
[1:21] manifest the savior of his knowledge By
[1:23] Us in every place the first part of it
[1:25] says we thank God which always causeth
[1:29] us to Triumph in Christ
[1:32] always the victories in mind always the
[1:36] Triumph is in mind doesn't matter how
[1:39] low it gets he causes us always to try
[1:42] up so he's got the victory in mind for
[1:44] our lives amen that's what we want to
[1:46] talk about in this part of divine Love
[1:48] Tonight heavenly father bless your
[1:50] children wherever they would be
[1:52] listening father the ears to hear as it
[1:54] says over and over in the church ages of
[1:57] the Book of Revelations the churches
[1:59] that says to him that hath an ear let
[2:01] him hear what the spirit is saying to
[2:04] the churches and so Lord if you're
[2:06] speaking we want to have an ear to hear
[2:08] tonight and whether they be online or
[2:10] the archive or here tonight in the
[2:13] service we pray that you will bless the
[2:15] ears to hear maybe it's some morning
[2:17] somewhere somebody's listening father
[2:18] but father whatever time it is I pray
[2:21] that you give them spiritual revelation
[2:23] we commit this service to you in Jesus
[2:25] name amen praise the Lord sometimes
[2:29] those you may be seated sometimes those
[2:31] video glitches and those things that
[2:33] happen to cause problems technically in
[2:36] all the equipment and no we won't have
[2:38] any of this equipment on the other side
[2:40] praise the Lord
[2:41] but sometimes it's just the devil
[2:43] getting all the equipment because you
[2:45] don't like what's being said
[2:47] praise the Lord so we want to look back
[2:49] look back at this here again tonight and
[2:51] finish up with this series and uh you
[2:54] know I I want to just look at this as
[2:58] something that we not look at Divine
[3:01] love should not be looked at as anything
[3:03] that originates in human at all no human
[3:07] being can produce this on his own this
[3:10] isn't just being good to people if
[3:12] you're being good to people that's a
[3:13] good thing but this love this Capstone
[3:16] love this Divine love this perfect love
[3:19] can only be in one it can only originate
[3:22] in one place and that's our Lord he is
[3:24] love he's the substance of love Christ
[3:27] is the substance of love and so if you
[3:30] didn't receive the right kind of love in
[3:31] your life there's a person who can give
[3:33] it to you and besides that if it comes
[3:36] and lives in you then you can project
[3:38] this love to other people and so when we
[3:41] look at we want to know the point that
[3:44] this love is not a human love in the
[3:47] beginning of time it's amazing that in
[3:49] the first two or three scriptures of the
[3:50] Bible we could have the key actually to
[3:53] all the chaos that's in the world today
[3:55] because in the second verse of the Bible
[3:57] you go back and read it if you got your
[3:59] Bible you can go back and read it
[4:00] sometime we already have the answer when
[4:03] the whole world was without form and
[4:05] void and empty and chaos and so there
[4:08] was nothing to fix fix that there was
[4:11] nothing to make that right can you say
[4:13] Amen there was no source of itself that
[4:17] could redeem the chaos that was in the
[4:20] answer I think is in verse 3 and the
[4:22] spirit of the Lord moved upon that chaos
[4:25] the spirit of the Lord moved upon the
[4:29] waters and then light it said let there
[4:31] be light and then Light Came where'd the
[4:34] light come from it came from God
[4:36] so when he the spirit moved on this
[4:39] that's when chaos turned to an Eden
[4:43] it's when the spirit of the Lord moves
[4:45] on your life and you respond
[4:47] is when your chaos turns to an Eden can
[4:50] I get an amen tonight
[4:52] it's when the spirit of the lord it's
[4:54] not when it's not within yourself it's
[4:56] not something you can produce within
[4:58] yourself if you're in chaos you can't
[5:00] change the chaos
[5:02] you can't just have a psychological
[5:04] thing and change and people can get
[5:05] pretty strong in their minds but when
[5:07] there's that type of chaos and the type
[5:09] of chaos that's in the world there has
[5:11] to be something come from another source
[5:13] and that's where it came from the spirit
[5:15] of the Lord moved upon the face of the
[5:19] waters and that everything begin to
[5:21] change and became at Eden he can do the
[5:23] same thing to your life so when we look
[5:25] at this love we have to see it is that
[5:27] it's not from Human effort the answer is
[5:30] is it doesn't the answer doesn't come
[5:32] from an outside thing of human effort in
[5:35] any form this love will only come from
[5:38] the person of Love Christ and he will be
[5:41] the only source of it and so then when
[5:43] you have that buy a new birth when you
[5:46] have his love within you the next step
[5:48] is getting past the Flesh and the mind
[5:52] and the clouds and all that be moved
[5:55] away and with all that and that's why
[5:58] Paul said be transformed by the renewing
[6:01] of your mind this is so someone who's
[6:03] already born again this is someone who
[6:04] already has the Holy Spirit and in the
[6:07] Holy Spirit is that love but see our
[6:09] minds are clouded by things so the next
[6:12] step in a Christian journey is now to be
[6:15] transformed by the continual renewing of
[6:18] our mind and that it gets all the
[6:20] cloudiness now all the past out all your
[6:23] past thinking out and when it keeps
[6:25] purging all of those things and washes
[6:27] it away guess what can happen the love
[6:30] of God is released out of you to other
[6:32] people
[6:34] I'm going to say it again when you get
[6:36] all your mind and your past and your
[6:40] thoughts and and and you you get the
[6:42] clouds moved away so then his love what
[6:46] will happen his love can be released out
[6:49] of you
[6:50] what happened at Calvary what happened
[6:53] at Calvary you say well our Lord died
[6:56] there he he brought the sacrifice he he
[6:59] was the the lamb that took care of our
[7:01] sins yeah we got all those explanations
[7:03] and that's exactly what happened but
[7:05] what happened at Calvary there was a
[7:08] death and guess what love was released
[7:11] to you
[7:14] can you say man
[7:15] what happened to Calvary the love of God
[7:18] was released
[7:19] the love of God came forth from Calvary
[7:22] and but it had to be released it was
[7:24] there but it had to be released and how
[7:26] was it released it was released look at
[7:28] this now through a death through a
[7:31] suffering through pain through the death
[7:33] of Christ and when we start dying to
[7:36] ourselves when we start dying to our own
[7:38] will when we stop fighting for our own
[7:41] will and learn how to respond to God
[7:43] then maybe the love of God can be
[7:46] released when he died at the cross it
[7:49] released the love of God to us when we
[7:51] can die to ourselves it releases more
[7:53] the love of God can I get an amen
[7:57] because we're asking Lord how can I have
[8:00] this excellent way how can I have more
[8:01] of this perfect love released in my life
[8:03] well through Calvary the love of God was
[8:05] released through a suffering
[8:07] through a death
[8:09] through a dying to himself and he died
[8:11] physically we die in our minds we die to
[8:14] our own will there is a death we go
[8:16] through or else our Lord would not have
[8:18] said take up your cross and follow me he
[8:21] didn't say take up his cross he he went
[8:24] to his cross but there's a cross you
[8:25] have to bear
[8:27] and so everyone has a cross and that's
[8:29] dying to our own will Jesus himself had
[8:32] to die to his own will he's prayed in
[8:34] the garden father not my will but thine
[8:36] be done there was a death in the Garden
[8:38] of Eden before there was a death at
[8:40] Calvary
[8:41] and there would have been no Calvary
[8:43] unless there had been a Garden of Eden
[8:46] excuse me a Garden of Gethsemane excuse
[8:48] me there would have been no Calvary
[8:50] unless there had been a Garden of
[8:52] Gethsemane there have been no doubts at
[8:54] Calvary unless there had been in death
[8:56] to his will and he prayed in Gethsemane
[9:00] not my will but thine be done
[9:02] it's when we die to ourselves that the
[9:04] love of God can be released this
[9:06] excellent way we find this excellent way
[9:08] when we die to fighting for our own will
[9:10] and our way to respond to things
[9:13] and I want to get into this a little bit
[9:15] tonight it's when we die to these things
[9:18] maybe love can be released this love
[9:20] that we're searching for more of it the
[9:22] love of God the the True Love Of Christ
[9:25] can be released how many tonight would
[9:27] raise your hand how many raise your hand
[9:28] if you're listening online how many
[9:30] razors say I want this love this
[9:32] excellent way I want it to be released
[9:34] and projected more to people
[9:36] you say well I've got it but it needs to
[9:38] be released
[9:40] and one of the things and just a note
[9:42] for personally here one of the things
[9:44] I've learned as I'm preaching this I'm
[9:46] being challenged in this every day
[9:49] I'm so hungry for this more excellent
[9:51] way and more of this love but I'm I'm
[9:54] seeing it more and more as a battle and
[9:57] a death to myself to make a choice and
[10:00] sometimes it's actually embarrassing and
[10:03] humbling the decision you have to make
[10:05] because I'm confronted with now what do
[10:07] I do there's two things and I'll get to
[10:09] this a little later but I'll say it now
[10:11] when people are confronted with a bad
[10:13] Spirit or a bad situation or or
[10:16] circumstance in life
[10:18] psychology says that we don't do one of
[10:20] the two things fight or flight
[10:23] my wife and our fellowship some good
[10:24] fellowship with sister Julie Smith's
[10:26] here Monday morning and uh that's why I
[10:28] said we're taught we either human beings
[10:31] will fight
[10:32] all right I'm ready fight back oh
[10:34] they're run
[10:35] did you know in this excellent way
[10:37] neither of those are are right
[10:41] that's psychology that's a human being
[10:43] that's what we do we're going to get our
[10:45] fist out or we're going to get our guns
[10:47] out we're going to fight for this fight
[10:48] for my own way or we're going to run and
[10:51] that's not always good either
[10:55] so we learn to fight for our own will we
[10:59] learn to fight for our way and sometimes
[11:00] you're confronted with that decision and
[11:03] I've been confronted with these things
[11:04] over and over again an embarrassing
[11:06] humbly thing thing in a decision will I
[11:09] take the more excellent way will I eat
[11:12] Humble Pie
[11:17] Humble Pie doesn't taste very good when
[11:19] you're
[11:21] until later
[11:23] do I eat Humble Pie do I take the more
[11:26] excellent way do I die to myself or do I
[11:29] respond like 99 of other human beings
[11:33] respond respond to confrontation and to
[11:36] evil
[11:37] and to be being done wrong that's the
[11:40] decision every believer will be faced
[11:42] with do I respond the normal response do
[11:45] I fight do I fight
[11:47] do I respond by could I say that a big a
[11:51] big majority of Christians respond the
[11:52] same carnal way
[11:56] or do I say Lord you've got a more
[11:58] excellent way and it's not fight or
[12:00] flight It's Your Love
[12:02] being released
[12:05] Christ died at Calvary and because of
[12:07] that death and suffering it released the
[12:09] love of God and that's what I want in my
[12:10] life I mean raise your hand say that's
[12:11] what I want
[12:13] I I want to make a reference to the word
[12:15] Christian
[12:17] first time I was mentioned in Acts 11 26
[12:19] they were first called Christians at
[12:21] Antioch and uh the writer Barry petite
[12:25] says the original Greek word for
[12:26] Christian is christianos which comes
[12:28] from the two Greek words Christ and shun
[12:31] the word Christ means anointed and Chun
[12:34] means little so the word Christian
[12:36] literally means little anointed ones
[12:40] we're familiar with the term little
[12:42] Messiahs Christ the Messiah and Messiahs
[12:45] because if you put the same spirit in
[12:47] the Messiah in Christ the anointment in
[12:49] the Believers like happened on the day
[12:51] of Pentecost they're not just people
[12:53] following Christ they have his anointing
[12:55] on them
[12:56] they're little Messiahs can you say man
[12:59] so Christian does not mean like I used
[13:02] to think christ-like and we're following
[13:04] we're duplicating how Christ would treat
[13:07] people and we're putting that on we're
[13:09] not putting anything on Christian means
[13:11] a little anointed one and that means you
[13:13] have the same holy spirit that was in
[13:16] him in your life
[13:18] he goes on to say so the word Christian
[13:20] literally means little anointed ones
[13:22] during his life Jesus was called Messiah
[13:24] which meant the anointing one and we
[13:25] heard his little anointing ones who have
[13:27] been anointed by his holy spirit to
[13:29] represent him in this world
[13:31] interestingly the word Christian is only
[13:33] found three times in the Bible however
[13:35] how do you know if you are truly a
[13:37] Christian I can say I I can say I'm in a
[13:41] car because I can't say I'm a car
[13:43] because I'm in a garage
[13:44] or uh if I'm surrounded by a chicken
[13:47] fence that doesn't mean I'm a chicken I
[13:50] believe being a Christian is more than
[13:52] just saying a few words but is rather a
[13:55] changed life and a new way of living
[13:58] life according to the scripture it's the
[14:01] life that's in Christ that has to be in
[14:03] you
[14:04] and thus Christian takes on a deeper
[14:06] meaning it's not just you join Church
[14:08] you signed a membership you shook the
[14:10] pastor's hand or you gave heavy in the
[14:13] plate that doesn't make you a Christian
[14:18] but it's having the Holy Ghost
[14:21] is what made them Christians and they
[14:24] said in the book of Acts Church they
[14:25] said they took note
[14:27] after they've seen certain signs take
[14:29] place in the Believers they took note
[14:31] they've been with Jesus now some of
[14:34] those disciples after the upper room
[14:36] there's just three thousand Souls saved
[14:37] some of them worked physically with
[14:39] Christ but they took note the disciples
[14:42] had been with Jesus many others but some
[14:44] of them hadn't been physically with
[14:45] Jesus but they said they've been with
[14:46] Jesus why because his Same Spirit is in
[14:49] them they're doing the same works and
[14:51] didn't Jesus say that the works that I
[14:54] do shall you do also can I get an amen
[14:57] tonight he said the works that I do
[14:59] shall the Believers do also
[15:01] so it's not it's not us imitating Christ
[15:04] it's it's being Christ and thus that
[15:06] love is released to the people now that
[15:11] are the the confrontations the the the
[15:14] the the the the disappointments the
[15:16] people that have done you wrong the
[15:18] hatred in this world the persecution
[15:20] whether it's for you're a Christian or
[15:22] whether whatever it is there has to be
[15:24] something without ourselves come inside
[15:26] of ourselves by the Holy Ghost by a new
[15:30] birth that manifests a different
[15:32] response than what a human being would
[15:34] respond
[15:35] well I'm just going to be nice to that
[15:37] person well that's nice to be nice but
[15:39] we're talking about the love of God here
[15:42] and this love is not just some mental
[15:44] exercise This Love In Jesus had power
[15:48] over demonic forces
[15:51] I may believe that love is the strongest
[15:52] force in the world the love of God it
[15:55] has power over demonic forces
[15:57] you don't have power over demonic forces
[16:00] and maybe some of you listening you
[16:01] don't know if there's demonic forces or
[16:03] not there is demonic forces there's a
[16:05] real God there's a real devil there's
[16:07] demons there's hell there's Heaven
[16:09] there's other dimensions the Bible says
[16:12] that can you say Amen so now all this
[16:14] demonic realm is against you especially
[16:17] if you choose to be a believer and
[16:19] filled with the Holy Ghost all of Hell's
[16:21] guns are trained on you
[16:23] how do we fight it that with yourself
[16:26] good luck fighting demonic power on your
[16:29] own good luck fighting demonic power
[16:31] with your mental exercises there's one
[16:34] force that can defeat Satan's demonic
[16:37] power and that's the love of God
[16:39] somebody say praise the
[16:43] praise praise be to God
[16:45] so now
[16:46] let's look at these four things just a
[16:48] minute if you would again and uh
[16:51] we've already read the scripture but
[16:53] this is what it says this is the part of
[16:55] love we're finishing up tonight it says
[16:57] Divine love bears and protects things
[16:59] Divine love believes the best of things
[17:01] first Divine love always has hope for
[17:05] all things Divine love endures and holds
[17:08] up during difficulties now I know all of
[17:11] you have heard this uh recently before
[17:15] but I'm asking you to act like you've
[17:17] never heard it before and amen like
[17:19] you've never heard it before I can't
[17:21] help that the devil got in the equipment
[17:22] and nothing got recorded Sunday and so
[17:24] now if I'm gonna preach it to us again
[17:27] then you say Amen as if you never heard
[17:29] it before
[17:30] love and bears and protects all things
[17:33] love believes the best of things first
[17:35] love always has hope for all things and
[17:37] love endures and hopes up during
[17:40] difficulties holds up during
[17:42] difficulties in the Amplified this
[17:44] scripture says love bears all things
[17:46] regardless of what comes it believes all
[17:48] things looking for the best in each one
[17:50] it hopes all things remaining steadfast
[17:53] during difficult times endures all
[17:55] things without weakening it's strong can
[17:58] you say Amen it's faithful can you say
[18:01] Amen it's consistent can you say man
[18:04] and uh we find that in these statements
[18:07] that it's positive
[18:10] all of this is positive it's not cynical
[18:14] it's not this oh I'm I'm not sure that
[18:18] you'll make it this is positive it Bears
[18:21] all things it believes all things it's
[18:23] got victory in mind these statements
[18:26] this love has victory in mind no matter
[18:30] what condition you are in this love says
[18:33] you may be in that condition but I'm
[18:35] believing for something better
[18:38] how many would like crazy I'd like to be
[18:40] more of a positive person this Divine
[18:43] love is positive that you believe the
[18:45] best in somebody that you believe
[18:46] there's going to be a victory for
[18:48] somebody I like to be around people like
[18:50] that that can correct me but there's a
[18:53] victory in mind that's why I read to the
[18:55] scripture he gives he's given us the
[18:57] victory in Jesus Christ
[18:59] he didn't give us Jesus Christ in
[19:01] Christianity and the message of the last
[19:03] days to bring us defeated people and to
[19:05] go into our apps are defeated he brought
[19:07] it to end this in a big victory
[19:09] the Rapture is a big victory
[19:11] talk about Satan being upset when the
[19:14] True Believers leave this earth in a
[19:16] Rapture you talk about an ultimate
[19:18] victory
[19:19] it's just like Satan will be laying out
[19:22] completely faded I did everything I
[19:25] could and they're gone and that's it
[19:27] we'll just you just you know fan him
[19:29] just a little bit
[19:31] yeah it's a victory for the bride
[19:34] it's a total Victory so now all this has
[19:37] victory in it it has it's positive I
[19:39] mean it would like to be more positive
[19:42] it's getting past what you see to what
[19:46] you don't see and that's faith
[19:48] you can't find a cynical spirit in this
[19:51] you can't find a sarcastic spirit in
[19:55] this
[19:55] you can't find a doubtful spirit in this
[19:59] you can't find a pessimistic attitude in
[20:02] any of these scriptures of divine love
[20:04] you can't find a pessimist you can't
[20:07] find someone that just always leaves a
[20:08] doubt you'll never make it
[20:12] you're a dirt bag look where you're at
[20:14] there's a you know you might get help
[20:17] but I doubt it you can't find that in
[20:19] here
[20:20] it Bears all things it believes all
[20:22] things it hopes all things it's
[20:24] steadfast to keep believing all things
[20:26] no matter how many years it takes it's
[20:28] going to keep believing it endures
[20:29] things without weakening that's that's
[20:32] our Father Abraham he endured through
[20:34] doubts through unbelief through all the
[20:36] things he went through his faith remains
[20:39] steadfast
[20:41] I'm gonna believe
[20:43] Sarah Sarah
[20:45] do you feel any different today because
[20:47] he's going to have a son through this
[20:48] old grandma
[20:50] you feel any different today it's just
[20:52] foreign
[20:54] no I don't feel any different Abraham
[20:56] praise the Lord we're going to have a
[20:58] baby anyhow
[21:00] 25 years
[21:03] how about today Sarah
[21:04] Abraham you asked me that the last 30
[21:07] days you've asked me the same question
[21:08] I'm sorry I don't feel any different
[21:10] praise God we're going to have a baby
[21:11] anyhow
[21:14] you're not going to have a grandson he's
[21:16] going to have a son that's 75 years old
[21:20] then up to 90 90 years old he's going to
[21:22] have a son what kind of weirdo
[21:25] what kind of weirdo believes that he's
[21:28] he's a grandpa type age he's not going
[21:30] to have a grandson he's going to have a
[21:31] son he reminds me of my dad collecting
[21:34] all those things for his grandchildren
[21:35] all those toys he collected didn't even
[21:38] have a grandchild yet but he went to
[21:41] McDonald's and bought the Happy Meals in
[21:42] his drawer was I looked at one day I
[21:44] looked into my dad's drawer and he's got
[21:46] all these Happy Meal toys he don't have
[21:48] any grandkids yet but he's getting ready
[21:51] he's gonna have grandkids someday and
[21:54] the he ended up I mean mom how many has
[21:57] he got how many grandkids now
[22:00] fifty thousand
[22:02] nine
[22:04] but I I seen dad and the drawers for all
[22:07] these toys from McDonald's you know and
[22:09] said Dad what's this he says for my
[22:10] grandchildren you don't have any
[22:11] grandchildren he's like Abraham but
[22:13] Abraham wasn't a grandchild it was a son
[22:16] at 75 years old
[22:18] you feel any different Sarah feeling
[22:20] different today
[22:21] no I'm sorry I don't feel nothing so
[22:23] right we're going to have it anyhow
[22:25] God told us we're going to have it it's
[22:27] a steadfast believing through the
[22:30] weakening times
[22:32] through the enduring things enduring
[22:35] criticism and during whatever it is and
[22:37] incidentally he had some times in the
[22:39] Old Testament Abraham that he didn't
[22:41] look like he acted like that but the New
[22:43] Testament Accord of him or account of
[22:46] him basically just recorded that he was
[22:48] a man of faith and he believed against
[22:50] hope believed in Hope
[22:53] praise the Lord so now uh so
[22:57] so you can't find cynical in here you
[22:59] can't find sarcasm you can't find
[23:01] doubtful you can't find a pessimistic
[23:03] attitude in any of this because Divine
[23:06] love is not out to look for a reason to
[23:09] condemn
[23:12] beautiful
[23:13] that's right he said I've heard this
[23:15] somewhere before
[23:18] well tonight is the first time because
[23:20] you can't get the archive of it
[23:26] Divine love is not out to look for the
[23:29] reason to condemn first
[23:34] but the reason to save
[23:37] to create an atmosphere that however bad
[23:39] it looks that there's Redemption there's
[23:41] hope it's Redemption you can find in
[23:43] this in this love you always find
[23:45] redemption in this love you now it's not
[23:47] a lack of Truth it'll never compromise
[23:49] on truth if someone's living a
[23:51] rebellious life then you can't justify
[23:53] that you can't say they're okay they're
[23:55] not okay
[23:56] but your hope believes that they're
[23:58] gonna be okay someday that God's going
[24:01] to bring them out of their Rebellion
[24:02] somebody say praise the Lord so this
[24:05] love is not wishy-washy compromising and
[24:09] and justifying things people do but it
[24:11] never finds the condemnation first it
[24:15] tries to say listen I know you're in a
[24:17] state and I know you've done this to me
[24:19] or you've done this to you this and you
[24:20] you've done all these things but listen
[24:22] now I'm going to pray for you because
[24:24] I'm believing all things for you and I
[24:26] believe God can save you
[24:30] it's got positive Hope and Faith in it
[24:32] can you say Amen
[24:34] so to create an atmosphere however bad
[24:36] it looks where there's Redemption
[24:38] if you do this with your kids your kids
[24:40] will be a lot healthier in life in this
[24:42] atmosphere in the home of a positive
[24:45] there's always redemption in every
[24:46] mistake
[24:50] how many want to raise positive kids
[24:53] or help us parents help us parents
[24:56] that they get corrected
[24:58] and they know where they're wrong and
[25:00] they feel conviction don't raise kids
[25:01] that don't you're going to cover and get
[25:03] get rid of all convicted convictions
[25:04] good they need to feel bad for what
[25:07] they've done but they need to be a
[25:08] positive atmosphere that that's not a
[25:10] judge of your character you're going to
[25:11] come out of that thing you're going to
[25:12] be better for it
[25:15] uh create a home like that create an
[25:17] atmosphere where there's Redemption so
[25:19] first it's a the first confession is to
[25:21] speak Faith and Hope not a denial of the
[25:23] person's condition not that not a denial
[25:26] of truth but speaking positive instead
[25:28] of negative First the power and lot
[25:30] power the power of death and life are in
[25:32] the tongue can you say Amen
[25:35] not looking for the negative First
[25:39] Christians and our friend our Christian
[25:41] friends they have a duty in the right
[25:43] thing to expose something that's wrong
[25:45] in my life and wrong in your life that
[25:47] if they don't do that for me or you it's
[25:50] not love
[25:51] love is corrective
[25:54] love is corrective this world and the
[25:57] church World removes all the correction
[25:59] in love that's not love
[26:02] God corrects us because he loves us
[26:04] so you don't remove this love doesn't
[26:06] remove the correction but but it's the
[26:09] type of correction that has value in it
[26:12] it has something no father a father is
[26:15] correct for their own benefit the
[26:16] Hebrews talks about it but he says our
[26:19] father corrects us for our own benefit
[26:21] that we could bring forth the fruits
[26:23] later he's got the fruits in mind he's
[26:25] got the victory in mind so he may
[26:27] correct you but he's got something in
[26:29] mind there's a victory for the
[26:30] correction there's a victory coming at
[26:32] the end of the correction help our
[26:34] parenting to be that way Lord help our
[26:36] parenting to be that way the ultimate in
[26:38] is a victory over something it's a
[26:41] positive hope over something can you say
[26:42] Amen you're not defeated for life
[26:45] because you made a mistake
[26:47] you're not doomed for life because you
[26:49] made a mistake
[26:51] make a mistake own up to it bring it to
[26:53] the cross
[26:55] go on with God
[26:57] There's Hope in that
[26:59] I love being around someone who has a
[27:02] value for the god in me can you say I
[27:04] don't want to be around people that just
[27:05] that they don't ever correct me that's
[27:07] that's immature
[27:09] but I want to be around someone who has
[27:11] the value for God in Me and they
[27:13] encourage that God in Me and they have a
[27:15] welcoming spirit that I can come to and
[27:18] if they have a welcoming spirit and
[27:20] they've got Divine love expressed to me
[27:22] I can listen to them when they come to
[27:25] correct me
[27:27] just okay with everybody
[27:29] the gospel is good news it's good
[27:31] telling it's a good story it's the true
[27:33] uh can you say it man it's it's
[27:35] something that ends in a victory there's
[27:38] always a victory it's not just a story
[27:40] but has power with it there's the power
[27:42] under the salvation of it there's power
[27:44] for redemption in the love of God I'm
[27:47] going to say it again there is
[27:48] Supernatural power in Redemption and in
[27:51] the cross and in the blood and in his
[27:53] Spirit there's power for Redemption for
[27:56] salvation of any situation
[28:00] I wouldn't stay in a church that did not
[28:02] preach against sin or against hell and
[28:04] the nature of sin why because it's in
[28:06] the Bible and so if it's in the Bible it
[28:08] needs to be preached but when you preach
[28:10] at hell when you preach the truth when
[28:12] you bring conviction to me which I'd
[28:14] love to have more preachers preaching
[28:16] conviction
[28:17] but when you preach it to me please
[28:19] preach the gospel with it preach it in
[28:22] its power and give me a Lifeline give me
[28:25] something to deliver my life from that
[28:27] hell don't just preach hell but give me
[28:30] a Lifeline give me a way out don't give
[28:33] me an intellectual sermon on the blood
[28:35] preach conviction under the word with no
[28:37] denominational restraints and let the
[28:40] life come from that gospel to save me
[28:42] there's life in the blood can you say
[28:44] Amen tonight
[28:46] you can't have access to the blood
[28:48] without the full word it's not a symbol
[28:50] in the cross it's a power it's a
[28:52] substance of the Life of Christ preach
[28:54] that to me preach out to me give me a
[28:57] lifeline
[28:58] give me something to grab a hold of that
[28:59] if I Repent he's going to save me from
[29:02] my situation somebody said praise the
[29:04] Lord
[29:05] this is this is a positive
[29:08] thing
[29:09] but it's not positive thinking
[29:14] people think that the gospel now they've
[29:16] preached on TV and everything it's it's
[29:18] it's it's positive thinking the blood is
[29:21] not just positive thinking in the mind
[29:22] of positive thinking
[29:24] it expresses confidence and hope that
[29:28] something is going to happen you see if
[29:30] you just talk positive thinking there's
[29:32] no blood in that
[29:36] there's no power in that oh there's the
[29:39] power of a mind that can think the the
[29:42] what's the the book called The Power of
[29:44] Positive Thinking yeah there's a certain
[29:46] power but with that they were building
[29:48] the Tower of Babel it was positive
[29:50] thinking that built the Tower of Babel
[29:52] till God himself said if we don't
[29:54] confuse their language I can't stop the
[29:56] power of their positive thinking
[29:58] seminars
[30:00] positive thinking seminars rebuilding
[30:02] the Tower of Babel because something
[30:04] completely against God
[30:06] so we're not when we when we look at the
[30:08] Divine love of God this isn't positive
[30:10] thinking this is the has the blood in it
[30:13] and it's a positive hope that the power
[30:15] of the blood can change you and bring a
[30:18] real victory in your life it's positive
[30:20] because the blood has positive effects
[30:23] always
[30:24] praise be to God the blood always has
[30:27] positive effects the blood will always
[30:30] have problems the blood will always
[30:32] cause us to Triumph Triumph the blood
[30:34] will always bring the victory in our
[30:36] life
[30:36] there is no defeat in the blood of Jesus
[30:39] Christ
[30:42] there is none
[30:43] we will always Triumph through Christ
[30:47] praise the Lord
[30:51] Hallelujah it Bears all things it
[30:54] believes all things it hopes all things
[30:56] it expresses confidence and hope uh that
[30:59] something is going to happen it's a
[31:01] complete coverage of all things because
[31:03] it keeps saying all things Bears all
[31:05] things beliefs all things it covers
[31:09] everything
[31:10] it's a god response to everything it's
[31:13] Faith Faith Works by Divine love and so
[31:16] if we have more of this Divine love
[31:18] Faith Masters every circumstance faith
[31:21] will bring more of this Divine love can
[31:24] you say Amen praise the Lord so
[31:27] we'll come back to this quote in just a
[31:29] minute but look at this now we're we're
[31:31] reading here from Pastor Stephen Cole
[31:33] there's been some great things come out
[31:35] of the messenger of the hour out of this
[31:37] series and some other writers that I've
[31:39] read from as well I like how Pastor
[31:42] Stephen Cole says some things here and
[31:44] on this particular four sections of the
[31:47] uh of the uh the love of God
[31:50] these here he says he takes the first
[31:53] one and it to love bears and protects
[31:56] things to protect and it means to
[31:59] protect by covering stick with me here
[32:01] now we'll just we'll just wrap this up
[32:03] it's to protect by covering this love
[32:05] protects by covering love doesn't
[32:07] broadcast the problems of others love
[32:11] doesn't run down others with jokes
[32:14] sarcasms or put-downs
[32:18] love defends the character of the other
[32:20] person as much as possible within the
[32:23] limits of Truth
[32:26] love won't lie about weaknesses but
[32:28] neither will deliberately Expose and
[32:31] emphasize those wickedness weak
[32:34] weaknesses love protects love bears love
[32:39] protects love is a covering and that's
[32:41] where we have that statement that says
[32:43] love covers a multitude of sins
[32:48] it's not that the blood can't wash away
[32:50] sins but but as far as people's
[32:52] weaknesses it's covering it's covering
[32:55] those those things those weaknesses and
[32:58] it's not out broadcasting the problems
[33:01] of Others May the Lord help us to stop
[33:03] broadcasting the problems of others
[33:06] may the Lord help us Believers to stop
[33:09] being sarcastic and jokes and put Downs
[33:12] of other people just to make us feel
[33:14] better
[33:17] in Satan's even the message Satan he
[33:19] says if there's sin in your heart if
[33:21] there's fault in your heart if you've
[33:22] got anything pray now and ask God to
[33:24] forgive you you pray for me I'll pray
[33:26] for you God bless you is my prayer till
[33:27] we meet till we meet you sing in that
[33:29] song till we meet and God be with you
[33:31] too we meet again do you love one
[33:32] another John said little children love
[33:34] one another love one another for love
[33:36] covers a multitude of sins
[33:39] love covers love protects
[33:45] love theirs it doesn't endorse a lie or
[33:50] endorse endorse sin but it protects
[33:54] can we see that
[33:56] when it says love believes all things in
[33:58] the NIV it's translated love always
[34:00] trust and always trust this does not
[34:03] mean gullibility it does not it does
[34:05] mean that love is not suspicious and
[34:08] doubting of the other person's character
[34:11] and motives without good reason
[34:14] even if his actions offended you even if
[34:18] his actions offended you that love is
[34:21] not suspicious and doubting of the other
[34:23] person's character and motives without
[34:24] good reason you better have some good
[34:27] solid reasons I've been thinking about
[34:28] this this week and that is that you know
[34:30] when we go through and try to work out
[34:32] uh things from the past you know you got
[34:35] several scenarios there uh you you
[34:37] sometimes hearing all the scenarios
[34:39] helps you see the picture a little bit
[34:41] better and be a little bit more
[34:43] forgiving because you didn't know the
[34:44] whole picture
[34:45] so so here Paul says you're supposed to
[34:49] as the church be able to judge things
[34:51] judge matters you're not supposed to
[34:53] take one another to court because you
[34:54] should have the maturity and this Divine
[34:57] love this mature love to judge matters
[34:59] amongst yourself but when we go to judge
[35:02] our judgment has to be it can't be
[35:05] limited to just our opinion it can't be
[35:07] limited just to Eliza this is what I
[35:10] heard so I'm making a judgment call
[35:11] that's not what your judgment
[35:14] so now you wait to hear all the facts
[35:17] and and so now you got the facts and the
[35:21] facts can be truth so once you hear the
[35:23] facts oh now I can make a better
[35:26] judgment call
[35:27] but guess what even after you got the
[35:29] facts then you got where that person
[35:32] heart their heart was and guess what
[35:34] you're not a prophet you don't know
[35:36] their heart
[35:39] so ever more so careful we must be ever
[35:44] more so careful how we quickly judge
[35:47] matters
[35:49] how many want mature judgment
[35:52] love judgment with the Divine love
[35:55] so it doesn't jump right out and make a
[35:57] judgment call that's it you know that's
[35:58] that's how I no no no wait to hear all
[36:01] the facts and then when you hear the
[36:03] facts oh yeah it this happened this it's
[36:05] truth we're not denying it but then
[36:07] you're looking at the person's heart
[36:10] we're going to get to it in a minute I'm
[36:12] going to end this with a quote and a
[36:14] live action she said live action in The
[36:17] Prophet's life where he was confronted
[36:19] with something such an evil spirit but
[36:21] you're going to see this principle is
[36:23] that if you make a quick judgment call
[36:26] a lot of times you're not you're not
[36:28] acting by Divine love
[36:33] a quick judgment call is not acting by
[36:35] Divine love
[36:36] the facts and then you got the person's
[36:39] heart I want you to really hold that in
[36:41] your heart because I'm going to
[36:42] elaborate so he goes on to say that but
[36:44] love believes the other person is
[36:46] innocent until proven guilty not guilty
[36:49] until proven isn't it if there's a
[36:50] problem love doesn't jump immediately to
[36:52] blame the other person
[36:54] in the family this trust shows Itself by
[36:57] not grilling the other person about
[36:59] every detail of a story like an attorney
[37:02] cross-examining a defendant it means
[37:04] believing in your kids expressing
[37:06] confidence in them I'm thankful that my
[37:08] parents this writer says this uh this
[37:11] pastor says I'm thinking when my parents
[37:12] trusted me as a teenager it made me want
[37:14] to live up to that trust one of my
[37:17] friends had parents who did not trust
[37:18] him and he lived up to their distrust
[37:20] sometimes you will get ripped off in
[37:23] life when you trust people
[37:27] but don't give up on trusting
[37:31] because what love never gives up
[37:35] so someone broke your trust someone
[37:37] ripped you off someone Did You Wrong
[37:41] okay
[37:42] but don't give up trusting
[37:45] because love will persist
[37:49] in trusting
[37:50] oh somebody say praise the Lord
[37:53] you won't but this love will
[37:56] it's going to trust it's going to say
[37:58] I'm going to believe the best for the
[38:00] next thing for the I'm going to believe
[38:01] the best I'm going to lose all my trust
[38:04] you know we live in a world there's no
[38:05] trust anymore there's no trust in
[38:07] churches there's no trust in
[38:08] Christianity hardly there's no trust in
[38:10] Preachers a lot of preachers have failed
[38:13] you see the humanness and preachers
[38:15] sometimes
[38:17] trust is everything
[38:19] we live in a world doesn't have a trust
[38:21] in anything the trust the government
[38:22] they don't have any trust in anything
[38:24] there's got to be something to trust in
[38:25] I can tell you something tonight you can
[38:27] always trust this word you may not be
[38:30] able to trust people
[38:32] or maybe some Churches have done you
[38:34] wrong and maybe some preachers but
[38:36] listen you can always trust his word
[38:39] he's the same yesterday today and
[38:42] forever he's never failed in his word
[38:45] can you say Amen my daughter's writing a
[38:47] song about that now he's the same
[38:49] yesterday today and forever I believe
[38:51] his promise because his promise has
[38:53] always come through he's always kept his
[38:55] promises
[38:56] so there is something we can trust in
[38:58] this world
[39:00] The Love Will persist in trusting it'll
[39:03] just keep trusting
[39:05] well I'm gullible got hurt over and over
[39:08] and over again yeah I guess he forgive
[39:11] over and over again
[39:13] because if we lose trust and we lose and
[39:16] we get pessimistic and we just you know
[39:18] there's not much to live for anymore
[39:20] there's no hope there's no skip in your
[39:22] step there's no smile there's no joy
[39:25] anymore
[39:26] because everything's negative you don't
[39:27] trust anybody I want to be around
[39:28] anybody I just sit in front of my you
[39:30] know my phone and I don't it's a pretty
[39:33] boring life
[39:35] but the Holy Ghost for life is a vibrant
[39:37] a live life that believes the best and
[39:40] believes something better is coming
[39:42] it's positive
[39:45] praise the Lord love hopes all things
[39:50] that means it's not pessimistic it does
[39:52] not expect the one love to fail but to
[39:55] succeed you ever met people that I'm
[39:57] expecting that person to fail
[40:01] I just expect that they failed their
[40:03] whole life so I'm expecting them to
[40:05] completely fail that's not Divine love
[40:08] Divine love has an expectation I don't
[40:11] want them to fail
[40:12] I want them to have a victory
[40:14] it's not pessimistic it's it's it's it
[40:17] love hopes for all things There's Hope
[40:20] always in it never take the Hope out
[40:22] love refuses to take failure as final
[40:27] it exudes a Godly optimism which says I
[40:31] know you can do it brother because God
[40:33] is God in you is able to do it my
[40:35] brother it does not ignore reality it
[40:38] doesn't close its eyes to problems but
[40:40] it rests in the promises of God that he
[40:43] is working all things together for the
[40:45] good can you say Amen praise the Lord to
[40:48] those who love him though those are
[40:50] called according to his purpose and so
[40:52] love always always hopes it always hopes
[40:55] because brother I know God can do it
[40:58] brother I'm believing God can do it I
[41:00] know it seems impossible but I'm
[41:02] believing with you that's what we want
[41:04] to hear out of believers
[41:07] and when when they were getting ready to
[41:09] cross into the promised land and canis
[41:11] barnia and they they sent spies over and
[41:14] most of the spies come back and said
[41:15] it's not doable it's not a doable thing
[41:18] let's go back let's go back to Egypt
[41:20] give up the whole congregation was
[41:22] discouraged and that's when
[41:24] Caleb and Joshua rose up and stilled the
[41:28] crowd I always like to think if there's
[41:31] that many people there if Caleb and
[41:33] Joshua were sick of the pessimism and
[41:35] sick of the attitudes and sick of we
[41:37] can't do this and we can't do that I
[41:39] always think if there's a lot of people
[41:40] to think they just they still the crowd
[41:42] they didn't just say can I say something
[41:45] foreign
[41:47] please Moses could I say something no I
[41:50] think when they still the crowd they
[41:52] said ever
[41:53] everybody be quiet I got something to
[41:55] say
[41:58] shut up everybody
[42:01] be quiet
[42:03] I've been over there with these guys and
[42:06] I'm bringing a different report they see
[42:09] the Giants they seen the walls
[42:11] if they want to see themselves as
[42:13] grasshoppers let them do it I'm not a
[42:16] grasshopper I'm a Son of God and I'm
[42:20] bringing back a good report here's the
[42:22] evidence and I'm going to tell you we
[42:25] are more than able to take the land
[42:28] sometimes you got to steal the pessimism
[42:31] sometimes you say everybody shut up
[42:33] sometimes you they used to interrupt
[42:35] conversations at The Retreat I forget
[42:37] what it was called but when things turn
[42:38] negative at the table somebody would
[42:40] hijack the conversation that's what they
[42:42] called it they hijack it turn it to the
[42:44] word turn it to something positive and a
[42:47] lot of times you're gonna get some funny
[42:48] looks when you do that
[42:50] what are you doing
[42:52] what kind of weirdo are you get ready to
[42:55] be by yourself but that's that Joshua
[42:57] and Caleb said but I think things are
[42:58] going to get better I believe this
[42:59] brother's going to be okay let's pray
[43:01] for him let's not talk about him can you
[43:03] say Amen shut up steal the people we're
[43:07] well able to take the land can you say a
[43:10] match because love hopes all things
[43:14] Hallelujah the last one love endures all
[43:17] things the word endure in the middle is
[43:19] a military term that means to sustain
[43:21] the assault of an enemy
[43:23] it has the idea of holding up under
[43:25] trial of perseverance in spite of
[43:28] difficulties it means that love hangs in
[43:30] there it's with our song we've been
[43:31] singing Love never gives up from Bill
[43:33] Gaither love never lets down that keeps
[43:36] on trying through Smiles or frowns love
[43:39] never gives up it's a military word that
[43:42] when there's an assault of the enemy
[43:43] it's holding up it's persevering in
[43:46] spite of difficulties it means that love
[43:48] is going to hang in there love hangs in
[43:51] there
[43:52] it is not just passive stoic attitude
[43:55] it's a positive triumphant spirit that
[43:58] sticks it out until the end
[44:02] praise the Lord
[44:04] there is an epidemic among Christians of
[44:06] bailing out of tough situations
[44:10] the excellent way that I'm preaching to
[44:12] you believers
[44:14] is that
[44:16] we are not to bail out just because
[44:18] things get tough
[44:22] we're not to bail out of marriage just
[44:24] because the marriage gets tough
[44:27] I'd say if we ask of a show of hands
[44:29] that every marriage is not perfect and
[44:31] every marriage has tough times
[44:34] but the world has taught us to bail out
[44:37] the world is taught us I can make it on
[44:39] my own well not if you've become one
[44:40] with that person and had a vow with that
[44:43] person with the Lord you ought to battle
[44:45] it out together say we're going to get
[44:47] through this tough time
[44:49] but we've been taught to bail out and
[44:51] we've got a lot of reasons for doing it
[44:53] many times but this Divine love it has
[44:56] something in it there's hope there's a
[44:58] door
[45:00] how many like a door out
[45:02] there's there's the Door of Hope can you
[45:04] say
[45:05] amen there's an epidemic to bail out or
[45:08] test situations people don't like
[45:09] something that happens in a church they
[45:11] go find another church more of their
[45:12] liking they run into problems or
[45:14] disagreements in their marriage they
[45:16] grow tired of the effort and they bail
[45:18] out but you and so these things
[45:20] definitely are happening every day in
[45:23] our world
[45:24] uh and he says I'm not minimizing the
[45:28] the seriousness you know an adultery in
[45:30] a marriage it destroys trust and creates
[45:32] all sorts of problems in marriage I'm
[45:34] not suggesting that it's easy to work
[45:35] through it takes a lot of hard work to
[45:37] rebuild from something like that one
[45:39] brick at a time but God's best is to
[45:42] forgive and renew the marriage my
[45:45] question is do you have this excellent
[45:48] way this Divine love do you have that
[45:50] forgiveness or do you have human
[45:52] forgiveness
[45:55] because what the scripture tells me is
[45:57] that God's very best is to forgive and
[46:01] that forgiveness begins to work to renew
[46:04] the marriage if we don't have true
[46:06] repentance and true forgiveness we
[46:09] cannot get out of situations you can
[46:12] intellectually say these things and read
[46:14] quotes all you want to but until you say
[46:17] God I Lay My Life on the altar give me
[46:19] the true flood of forgiveness in my
[46:22] heart because in that is the power to
[46:24] give a Door of Hope just a little door
[46:26] that things are going to work back into
[46:28] a Reconciliation
[46:30] somebody say Amen tonight
[46:33] you've been taught by the world to find
[46:35] reasons to bail out
[46:37] but you see now God's best is to forgive
[46:40] and renew the marriage not to bail out
[46:42] love endures all things oh my goodness
[46:47] that covers a lot
[46:49] how much can you endure God can give you
[46:51] Grace to endure things
[46:54] friends if we've lost forgiveness and
[46:55] repentance we've lost everything for our
[46:57] families for the church
[46:59] for following the Lord everything those
[47:01] are essential things but they can't be
[47:03] mechanical somebody somebody think about
[47:05] it now they can't be intellectual
[47:08] you can forgive somebody intellectually
[47:10] and there's no forgiveness in your heart
[47:13] there's no release of the love of God
[47:15] there's no Door of Hope
[47:18] don't tell me no no we want the real
[47:20] thing
[47:21] say my hurt
[47:23] restricts me
[47:25] from really forgiving
[47:26] well you've explained it well because
[47:29] you're hurt is more important than
[47:31] finding this substance of the
[47:33] Forgiveness of God
[47:35] and when the Forgiveness of God becomes
[47:37] bigger than your hurt let God heal your
[47:39] hurt then it becomes a power to give you
[47:42] a Door of Hope
[47:44] to be released
[47:46] back to reconciliation
[47:50] I believe that and there's some tough
[47:51] situations sometimes that seem
[47:54] impossible
[47:56] hurtful situations I'm not talking about
[47:59] here I'm talking about hearing my whole
[48:01] life even amongst Believers tough family
[48:04] domestic situations that seem impossible
[48:07] and sometimes it's just but but but what
[48:10] if you're if your partner doesn't do it
[48:13] hopefully both of you will you can find
[48:15] a release of the love of God
[48:18] yourself
[48:20] somebody say praise the Lord
[48:23] this is how love acts it's selfless
[48:25] wholly dedicated directed to the
[48:27] building up of another person
[48:29] of course nobody can love completely
[48:32] like that and human it's got to be God's
[48:34] love
[48:36] so put Christ as we said this Christ in
[48:39] these scriptures now that we're
[48:41] finishing up with the characteristics of
[48:42] divine love it says charity we're
[48:44] calling it Divine love that's the same
[48:46] thing put Christ in there Christ is
[48:49] patient Christ is kind Christ is not
[48:53] jealous Christ does not brag Christ is
[48:56] not arrogant Christ does not act
[48:58] unbecomingly Christ does not seek its
[49:01] own Christ is not provoked easily
[49:03] provoked Christ does not take into
[49:05] account a wrong suffered
[49:08] Christ does not rejoice in
[49:09] unrighteousness but rejoices with the
[49:12] truth
[49:13] oh my there's a whole other sermon in
[49:16] that right there that I got to go back
[49:17] to that this love rejoices in truth it
[49:22] pursues truth
[49:25] and when it pursues it and gets to the
[49:28] bottom of it it rejoices in it
[49:30] not only does truth have victory in it
[49:33] and freedom but but truth is the thing
[49:36] that brings us to what we want and love
[49:40] will always pursue the truth and not act
[49:43] too quickly it pursues it and it
[49:45] rejoices when truth prevails
[49:49] so powerful
[49:50] uh
[49:52] Christ always protects Christ always
[49:54] trusts Christ always hopes Christ always
[49:56] perseveres if you want to love one
[49:58] another we must focus on his love for us
[50:00] and walk in his spirit for him to
[50:02] produce this Divine Capstone love in us
[50:06] can you say Amen tonight
[50:09] this goes on in conclusion he says love
[50:11] at first sight is easy to understand
[50:15] but it's when two people have been
[50:17] looking at each other for years that
[50:20] love becomes a miracle
[50:26] but it's not really a miracle it's a
[50:28] result of yielding to God
[50:30] did you catch it now love at first sight
[50:32] that's easy
[50:33] right and it's easy to understand
[50:35] but now it's the ones you're around all
[50:37] the time and the ones and your boss for
[50:38] 30 years
[50:40] yeah
[50:42] that's when this this really gets its
[50:45] test
[50:46] but it's not a miracle it's a result of
[50:48] yielding to God repeatedly confronting
[50:50] our selfishness and daily practical
[50:52] biblical love in our homes and as the
[50:55] old Apostle John they said was so weak I
[50:59] brought this up in some Services before
[51:01] the old Apostle John was so weak he had
[51:03] to be carried into church in Church
[51:05] meetings at the end of the meeting he
[51:06] would be helped to his feet to give a
[51:08] word of exhortation and he would always
[51:10] repeat just one word of exhortation
[51:12] little children love one another the
[51:15] disciples grew weary of the same words
[51:16] every time finally they asked him why
[51:19] he said the same thing over and over
[51:21] again and he replied because it is the
[51:25] Commandment of the Lord number one and
[51:28] is the observation of Love Alone that is
[51:31] sufficient
[51:33] so his answer to everything was Brothers
[51:37] you're debating over something you've
[51:39] got a disagreement you got this
[51:41] just love one another
[51:44] the observation of it is
[51:47] of it alone is sufficient
[51:50] someone has said that if we discovered
[51:52] that we only had five minutes left to
[51:55] say all we wanted to say every telephone
[51:57] booth every phone cell phone would be
[52:00] going and would be occupied in those
[52:03] five minutes by people calling other
[52:05] people to stammer that they love them
[52:08] Selfless Love is our priority
[52:14] the excellent way is the bride's calling
[52:18] it is our calling it's not just a
[52:20] teaching it's our calling
[52:23] prophecies will fail all these other
[52:26] things will fail but love will endure
[52:27] forever
[52:28] and love is the most powerful force in
[52:30] the world
[52:33] in relation to this I I I don't think I
[52:36] read the
[52:39] I'll just read the first part of this
[52:40] perfect faith is a master of
[52:42] circumstances perfect fake Masters all
[52:44] circumstances no matter what it is it
[52:46] Masters it now watch when you believe
[52:48] anything do anything and you got faith
[52:50] in what you're doing no matter what the
[52:52] circumstance is that don't have one
[52:53] thing to do with it see it Masters that
[52:56] circumstance isn't that wonderful
[52:58] and that's this love that produces faith
[53:01] that no matter what you're confronted
[53:03] with no matter what circumstance you're
[53:04] confronted with it only has one response
[53:07] to it it's Faith it's love and instead
[53:10] of the circumstance mastering you it
[53:13] Masters the circumstance the evil in
[53:15] front of you and it it goes beyond what
[53:18] the quick response is now I'm just going
[53:21] to end this by um
[53:23] reminding you of things that you you
[53:26] probably know but remind you of some uh
[53:29] there's some examples and brother
[53:31] branham's life that he gave and one goes
[53:34] all the way back to 1950
[53:36] um in Portland Oregon and he gave some
[53:40] examples of different times of when
[53:42] something really struck him
[53:45] um and I you know the story so I'm not
[53:47] going to get on I'm just going to focus
[53:48] on this one because it's been really
[53:50] special to me to look over the different
[53:52] times he gave this account of when he
[53:54] was praying for the sick and when this
[53:56] Maniac man came in in Portland Oregon
[53:59] ran up to the platform the two small
[54:01] policemen couldn't hold him back because
[54:03] they were small this was a very large
[54:04] man
[54:05] demon-possessed and really lashing out
[54:08] some pretty hard things and he said
[54:09] you're a false preacher I'm gonna I'm
[54:11] gonna break every bone in your body
[54:13] tonight and and the brother Brown says
[54:15] he could do that with his size you know
[54:18] and he's just spilling out this Venom I
[54:20] don't know where it came from they said
[54:22] that he had had some domestic trouble
[54:23] before but he's unleashing all of this
[54:25] evil upon him and so I've been reading
[54:28] some of these things and just reminding
[54:30] myself of these stories going back to
[54:32] 1950 and one of the things I catch in
[54:35] all the stories though I think one of
[54:36] the things that I'd like you to just see
[54:37] before we close tonight is that in each
[54:40] of those incidences when I was
[54:42] confronted with stuff like that and with
[54:43] this maniac and Portland he said
[54:46] something come over me
[54:49] something very unique come over me
[54:52] and he said many times he said I wish I
[54:56] could have that all the time
[54:59] well if he's got the Holy Ghost he's got
[55:01] it all the time but see it's got to be
[55:03] released especially in moments when
[55:06] someone is hating you
[55:09] and he said these unique situations and
[55:11] by the way this is before the Seven
[55:12] Seals were preached
[55:15] I I hate to bring that up but he's
[55:18] moving into something there that I want
[55:20] even for the book of redemption is
[55:22] opened but you see now he said something
[55:25] he said I wish oh I wish I had that all
[55:27] the time and I wish you as a
[55:29] congregation could have that all the
[55:30] time but it come over him and what it
[55:32] did he says all of a sudden now I love
[55:34] this man with a deep love and I wasn't
[55:38] so now he's not reacting with the normal
[55:40] human reaction of fight or flight any
[55:44] man and he was a man he would react
[55:46] saying I've got to get the defenses up
[55:49] I've got to do something here he's not
[55:51] going to talk to me like that police get
[55:53] him all those other things he's having
[55:55] something else come over him how many
[55:57] would like to have that happen to you
[55:59] and that's something else that come over
[56:01] him was way more powerful you know
[56:04] Sunday we've talked about security here
[56:06] this was way more powerful than any
[56:08] human security
[56:11] this is a force that could break down
[56:13] demonic power
[56:15] and he says all of a sudden this that
[56:17] come over me he said I love the man
[56:19] there's so many different accounts and
[56:21] he goes into it he gives details and
[56:23] each time he tells the story It's a
[56:26] Wonderful story and he says as he come
[56:27] to the platform he said he hawked up
[56:30] and he gives the oh and he spit across
[56:34] the stage and spit right in brother
[56:35] brahm's face this big Globus bit
[56:39] and he's saying I'll tear you up I'll
[56:41] break every bone in your body I'll show
[56:43] you who's boss just all these things and
[56:45] so this is just one account but he says
[56:48] he walked up to me with his hands like
[56:50] this and his teeth set together and he
[56:52] and we got to me
[56:54] right in my face I just stood and looked
[56:56] at him and you know what I wish I could
[56:58] always feel like I did right then and
[57:01] instead of despising that man instead of
[57:04] hating that man I felt sorry for him I
[57:07] loved him
[57:09] why I thought that man here's the
[57:12] thoughts that man don't want to be like
[57:14] that
[57:16] no matter what he said it's not him
[57:19] talking like that
[57:20] he wants to be a normal man he wants to
[57:22] love his babies and his wife is a
[57:24] sweetheart he wants to come in at night
[57:26] and take up his little babies and play
[57:28] with him and go out and work and come in
[57:29] and put his his arm around his wife and
[57:31] have a home like any other man
[57:34] and you know what he's saying is the
[57:35] truth any Normal Man
[57:37] that's not possessed with demons that's
[57:39] the normal life he wants to come home to
[57:42] your wife to come home to your family to
[57:44] provide for your family have love in the
[57:46] family to love your children to provide
[57:48] for them a normal good spirit in the
[57:51] home
[57:52] it's when these other demonic Powers
[57:54] come that we have divorce yelling
[57:57] separation arguments that end in fights
[58:01] come on somebody say amen that's not of
[58:03] God
[58:05] the son of God
[58:06] and so
[58:09] he said I wish I could feel that all he
[58:11] said I I felt sorry for him and that man
[58:14] don't want to be like that he wants to
[58:16] be home take his little babies and play
[58:18] with him go out and work and come and
[58:20] have a home like any other man and
[58:21] that's not the man he'd be my brother
[58:23] that's the devil in that poor fella and
[58:25] listen close and that happening I wish
[58:27] that could happen right now here listen
[58:29] now I wish that could happen that come
[58:32] over me
[58:33] to Every Soul that's here right now he
[58:36] said there wouldn't be a feeble person
[58:37] Among Us in the next five minutes
[58:41] and you can't make yourself do it it has
[58:44] to be a gift of God and while standing
[58:46] there I love them I thought poor fellow
[58:48] and right while I was speaking
[58:50] projecting to him now you can't Bluff
[58:52] yourself that's what somebody was
[58:53] so-called Christianity you're trying to
[58:55] act like something that you're not you
[58:56] can't fool a wild animal many times I
[58:58] walk right face to face with kind all
[59:00] kinds of wild animals and someone said
[59:02] are you afraid brother Brown no sir I
[59:03] love them and they know it you can't
[59:05] fool them I walk I used to have a lot of
[59:08] writing I've rode for many years and so
[59:09] forth I walked into wild horses and
[59:11] somehow in a few minutes he'd have his
[59:13] head laid over my shoulder and I just
[59:15] put a blanket on him and walk him around
[59:17] a little bit with a blanket on and then
[59:18] throw the saddle on him and the first
[59:20] thing you know I'd be riding him along
[59:22] he loves you and if you really love him
[59:24] he knows it now listen I want to tell
[59:26] you something human beings are more
[59:28] intelligent than animals you can't tell
[59:30] people you love them they won't believe
[59:32] it unless it's the real thing there to
[59:34] prove it so you say oh brother you know
[59:37] we have such great fellowship and down
[59:39] in your heart you're holding a grudge in
[59:41] your heart
[59:43] you got too much fake Christianity
[59:45] oh I love you with the love of the Lord
[59:47] but
[59:48] brother you better make sure that's real
[59:50] in your heart
[59:51] instead of holding a grudge for years
[59:54] it's always amazing people can come and
[59:55] worship in the same congregation for
[59:57] years they can worship together even
[1:00:00] take communion together sometimes
[1:00:02] but they can't Fellowship
[1:00:06] just I'm just saying
[1:00:09] it doesn't really make sense
[1:00:11] I don't want to be around that person
[1:00:12] holding a grudge in your heart
[1:00:16] it has to be real God make it real
[1:00:21] your neighbor your neighbor knows it you
[1:00:24] got to be clean and above war and say
[1:00:25] Lord God created me a clean heart to
[1:00:27] love and when that poor fellow staying
[1:00:29] there in the depths of my soul I felt
[1:00:30] sorry for him and just as I was feeling
[1:00:32] sorry the Holy Spirit begin to speak and
[1:00:34] the man fell across my feet it's
[1:00:36] wonderful to see what God can do love is
[1:00:39] the mightiest force that there is did
[1:00:41] you know God is love he that loveth is
[1:00:43] of God now I don't mean affectionate
[1:00:45] love I mean Godly love affection of Love
[1:00:47] creates lust but I'm talking about Godly
[1:00:50] love real love I just like to open up my
[1:00:52] heart and tell you a little
[1:00:54] um inside of my life and would like to
[1:00:56] let you know you strangers we're
[1:00:59] children of strangers and children of
[1:01:01] God that are here this is just on my
[1:01:03] heart to say this now I'm going to I'm
[1:01:06] going to something else but I want to
[1:01:08] say this I'll tell you a little bit of
[1:01:10] the inside of my life I'm so grateful
[1:01:12] tonight the Lord for the to the Lord
[1:01:14] Jesus for he's let me do what he's let
[1:01:16] me to do for his people I love people
[1:01:19] and so he goes on and talks about this
[1:01:21] love of he talks about how it's
[1:01:22] manifested and I could say so much more
[1:01:25] but but the accounts of this bring out
[1:01:27] so many facets of it to where that man
[1:01:30] fell at his feet and he was delivered of
[1:01:32] his his demons at that moment because
[1:01:35] this something come over him the most
[1:01:37] powerful force in the world and it
[1:01:39] dismantled this spirit
[1:01:42] dismantled this Spirit he said the Lord
[1:01:46] said through him today you'll fall at my
[1:01:48] feet and he says I'll show you whose
[1:01:50] feet who's going to fall whose feet and
[1:01:52] he started to run towards brother
[1:01:54] Branham and all of a sudden at the last
[1:01:56] minute he just crumbled and they had to
[1:01:58] come and take him off brother Bam's feet
[1:02:00] because he was just there he was he that
[1:02:02] once a man is delivered of stuff like
[1:02:04] that and he just has no hardly any life
[1:02:06] left in him
[1:02:08] what did it he was able to project past
[1:02:12] my point tonight as I close is that this
[1:02:16] love came over him and what did that
[1:02:18] love do what did it do it didn't react
[1:02:22] like we would normally react
[1:02:26] fight
[1:02:28] or flight
[1:02:31] I'm running I'm getting out of here
[1:02:34] I'm fighting I'm getting my fist up you
[1:02:37] know brother Brandon was a boxer
[1:02:40] he probably could have did some damage
[1:02:43] but we're not talking about how we react
[1:02:45] like the world does
[1:02:47] right and now they respond to
[1:02:48] confrontation they respond to evil
[1:02:51] people they respond to demon power
[1:02:54] you should not let demon Power Make You
[1:02:57] Afraid
[1:02:59] you should be praised that I have the
[1:03:01] love of God
[1:03:02] let it come over me now and manifest
[1:03:04] because it's more powerful than this
[1:03:06] demon
[1:03:08] may we as Christians yield ourselves to
[1:03:10] this more excellent way
[1:03:12] in whatever we come upon in life
[1:03:14] whatever it is tomorrow you may face
[1:03:16] something you probably will somebody or
[1:03:19] something or some spirit this is what I
[1:03:22] teach it this is not just a teaching I'm
[1:03:23] saying Lord let me find this love and
[1:03:27] faith to react perfect Faith Masters
[1:03:30] every circumstance
[1:03:31] let not my reaction be even to something
[1:03:35] like this that the prophet encounter let
[1:03:38] it not be the normal 99 of human beings
[1:03:43] the normal thing of fight or flight
[1:03:47] fighting back
[1:03:49] how am I going to deal with this and
[1:03:50] you're going through their mind how
[1:03:51] you're dealing with us all of us do that
[1:03:53] it's that's normal right
[1:03:55] but if we were to yield back and say now
[1:03:57] Lord
[1:03:58] I have access to the same Holy Ghost
[1:04:00] love
[1:04:01] that the prophet did
[1:04:04] let me just
[1:04:06] step back just a minute let me examine
[1:04:08] and then then that projects past the
[1:04:12] demon and it's looking just like all
[1:04:14] these attributes tonight love bears all
[1:04:17] things love believes all things love
[1:04:19] believes the best and guess what God has
[1:04:21] in mind and that love has in mind for
[1:04:23] this Maniac in Portland Oregon you know
[1:04:26] what God has in mind and this love has
[1:04:27] in mind of victory
[1:04:31] not the demon not him spitting in his
[1:04:34] face listen friends if someone Hawks up
[1:04:37] and spits in your face all that
[1:04:40] it's a test
[1:04:44] but all the normal things of reactions
[1:04:47] went out the door and something come
[1:04:49] over him he said oh I wish I could have
[1:04:51] that on me all the time and it was such
[1:04:54] a powerful force it broke that spirit
[1:04:57] this is the more excellent way
[1:04:59] this is not a teaching this is an
[1:05:01] atmosphere this is his love this is a
[1:05:03] substance
[1:05:05] that Believers have access to and I
[1:05:08] believe this Series has done us all good
[1:05:13] I believe this series was of the Lord I
[1:05:16] believe it's the pastors that he's
[1:05:18] wanted us sheep to feed in for a while
[1:05:21] and I there's a few scriptures left in
[1:05:23] First Corinthians
[1:05:25] and I want to go on with them but the
[1:05:27] attributes we've kind of finished but I
[1:05:29] want to go in because really the theme
[1:05:31] at the end prophecies will fail these
[1:05:34] things may fail but love will never fail
[1:05:37] and so the the end result now by the
[1:05:41] faith now abideth hope but the greatest
[1:05:45] of these
[1:05:47] is divine love
[1:05:50] so what's the end of all this thing
[1:05:54] it's the end of all this what's the end
[1:05:56] of the message what's the what do we
[1:05:57] what's the culmination of all this
[1:06:00] Fellowship woman sister Julie about it
[1:06:02] what's the what's the Well it can't be
[1:06:06] just a mechanical intellectual stepping
[1:06:09] into a rapture
[1:06:11] there's going to be Supernatural to this
[1:06:14] there's going to be a quick short work
[1:06:16] in the bride how many believe that it
[1:06:19] won't be a public show but there's going
[1:06:20] to be a quick short work in The Bride of
[1:06:22] Jesus Christ The True Believers around
[1:06:24] the world something's going to energize
[1:06:26] the faith to Not Just Produce something
[1:06:29] that's publicly but something has to
[1:06:31] bring that Faith to pass and I
[1:06:34] personally believe the end result is to
[1:06:36] find this more excellent way and live by
[1:06:39] it and in that he can do all things
[1:06:43] you know when that Maniac when the
[1:06:45] police drug him off his feet he said do
[1:06:48] you know at that moment and I didn't
[1:06:49] read this till today he said at that
[1:06:51] moment they come out of the structures
[1:06:52] they come out of the wheelchairs they
[1:06:54] come out of the the blind eyes were
[1:06:56] opened no prayer line when they seen the
[1:06:59] love of God manifested that way all the
[1:07:02] demons broke up at that moment
[1:07:04] come out of their structures come out of
[1:07:06] their wheelchairs all over the building
[1:07:08] there was spontaneous healing
[1:07:12] you see it's not a public it doesn't
[1:07:14] have to be a public show it doesn't have
[1:07:16] to be worked up can you say Amen live by
[1:07:19] this true genuine substance the love of
[1:07:21] God and let it do what it's going to do
[1:07:22] but I guarantee you it's going to do the
[1:07:24] supernatural
[1:07:26] because when Divine love projects
[1:07:29] Grace takes over
[1:07:31] Sovereign Grace and things will happen
[1:07:34] you never dreamed of you never dreamed
[1:07:36] of because in this substance he can do
[1:07:40] all things
[1:07:42] praise be to God let's give the Lord a
[1:07:43] handcuff a praise amen let's Stand
[1:07:45] Together

[1:13:04] it change how you look at it by faith
[1:13:07] tonight it tells us he
[1:13:10] the Jesus of the Bible is present Among
[1:13:13] Us here tonight
[1:13:15] how many believe that
[1:13:17] and if you believe that there isn't
[1:13:19] anything that's in your life would be
[1:13:21] too impossible for the Lord he's right
[1:13:23] here ministering to you right here
[1:13:25] loving you drawing you in closer and

[1:14:23] let our motivation for everything be
[1:14:26] this substance of Your Love expressed to
[1:14:30] those around us
[1:14:31] and that'll be the distinction Lord
