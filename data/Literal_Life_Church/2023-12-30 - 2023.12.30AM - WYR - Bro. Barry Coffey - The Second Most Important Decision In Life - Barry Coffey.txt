side working on the outside [Applause] oh Jesus on the inside working on the outside oh what a change in my life Jesus on the inside working on the outside what a change in my life [Music] in my life one more time Jesus on the inside working on the outside oh what a change in my life Jesus on the inside working on the outside what a change in my life Jesus on the inside working on the outside oh what a change in my life oh what a [Music] change in my [Music] life Heavenly Father we thank you for your mercies which are new every day have your way Lord we pray in this session challenge us help us Lord to grow and apply your word in truth and in everyday life we depend on the Holy Spirit to help us to do that we commit our time to gather down to your hands in Jesus Christ's name amen let's read from the scripture thanks thanks hey got it buddy yeah okay go did you just go on sit down there get in your wheelchair Proverbs 1822 you're welcome to read it from the board Proverbs 18:22 who so findeth a wife findeth a good thing and a hey who so findeth a wife findeth a good thing and obtaineth the favor of the Lord may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated all right I have a timer some of you may know notice I I often carry I'm sure you probably haven't but I carry around this black book because it looks like a Bible and and sometimes it's just easier for me to uh carry that around but en and I have a bunch of questions and these are questions that have have gathered accumulated from youth all over the world places I go and they want to have a youth meeting and so forth and we usually do questions and answers a Q&A H we didn't do one here but we usually do Q&A and I keep these questions because and I don't put names of countries on them or anything else or male or female because what what I've found over the years and Paul and I have talked about this turn me down just a shape will you just a shape um what what we found is that wherever we go and wherever we talk to young people the concerns they have generally uh are are very similar uh to you know regardless of what country they're in and they generally fall into two categories and one of them is about what they should be doing in life finding the will of God you know what should I be working at how do I know that I'm working the right thing and how do I know I'm doing the right thing and uh that's a very common question and that's a normal question because that's that's the point in life you're at okay okay the second question though has to do with relationships and how do I know when I found the right person how do I know when uh you know this is this is the right the right person when I was single I asked my brothers that question which was a foolish thing but I asked him I said how did you know uh that uh you know sister Brenda was the person for you how did you know and my oldest brother being I falsely assume was the wiser he said well I just knew I said ' it's not really an answer and so I went to my next oldest brother and falsely assumed that he'd know what he's talking about and I said how did you know that uh sister Moren was the right one for you and he said well I just knew I said you're both losers and uh so I you know I I I thought about that and I thought wow there must be some something a little more than that there's probably something in the Bible about that nobody had ever taught me anything about that and uh so one year after I was married and had kids I was at Louisiana Camp I was speaking there and some uh young girl came up to me and said brother Barry as I was I was doing a a thing on courtship and uh she said brother Barry he said how did you know Sister Becky was the right one I said I just knew it was love at first sight do you believe in love at first sight huh all right brother Braham said when Adam saw Eve it was love at first sight brother bam said when Isaac saw Rebecca what what' you say you're a legalist that's your trouble when when Isaac saw Rebecca brother Bram said it was love at first sight brother Braham said when Jesus sees the bride in person it'll be love at first sight when I saw sister Becky it was love at first sight so it is a certainly a scriptural thing however now uh you're not supposed to propose when you make that first connection I wanted to but uh her father was there so so that is the second question that people ask and and it's a very important question very powerful one and one that's going to affect you for the rest of your life so for a few minutes I want to talk about this second most important decision in your life but first let me preempt that and say what is the most important important decision in your life now either you have to give me a clicker or I got to say next what do you want me to do clicker I like clickers I like clickers a whole lot better so we want to look at uh what is the first most important decision in your life does anybody want to Hazard to guess what the most important decision in your life is yeah red big red stand up big red there you go accept the Lord Jesus yeah wonderful that's right okay okay next I believe that the most important thing in any life is to entertain Jesus Christ properly in the first place in your worship first place in your uh life first place in everything go give that to somebody will you Jesus Christ deserves that place and me I believe with all my heart lots of places and in many different ways brother brandom says that's the most important decision in your life and you got to get that right okay so I call it the vertical you have to get the vertical right first if you don't do anything else right get that right you have to have a relationship with Christ you have to have an encounter with him and it has to turn into a Life coming out of you right which is the Life of Christ it's all about developing character God's always interested in developing character in you because that's the the only thing you're going to take with you and the thing you leave behind is your legacy so when I leave here when I leave here whenever I leave behind a legacy a legacy of uh having the yeah sure it a legacy of doing really uh carnal things with Paul in the usri cheet over all these years uh the video has went viral the snowball fight last night it's gone viral so would you give that to somebody um so uh it is a it is a very important and you have to get this right okay hear me you have to get this right the next thing though is this you have to deal with people who are within the body and people who are without so you got to Be an Effective witness to people outside about what this message really is and as a matter of fact according to the book of Timothy you have to be an example don't talk I'm talking uh you were they were trading notes back there um what what what Timothy says is that we have have to be an example of the Believers in faith Purity conscience and so forth right that's what we have to be we have to be an example of the Believers and we we therefore in in a sense we should be able to point to any one of you and say stand up this is what the message produces that's what we should be able to do unashamedly and say if I'm a Christian I'm a believer I'm identified then we should be able to point you and say here's an example of what God's produced in the last day and this last crop okay and that's what we should be so God's always interested in developing character in you and the Legacy that we leave behind is our testimony and our you know the uh the our exploits and the things we've done and all of that so that's really important for us to think about okay because those are two things you can't take anything else with you so wherever I go in the world and Paul will tell you the same thing these ministers will tell you and young people get together they want to know basically questions surrounding those two things and they're very important in life so if we understand is everybody okay on what the most important thing is in your life that's that's the first most now the second the the the other thing that I next the other thing that I want to just reference here in Proverbs 22 it says remove not the ancient Landmark which thy fathers have set so God's placed his word uh in front of us and we darent not move it you have no right or jurisdiction to take the landmarks that God has established and just move them over here because you know what in that church that's what they do so we're going to do it like that church over there or that's the way I did it when I was uh you know in the world so you know you're going to try to move around landmarks and and that's not possible in God's economy you can't move the landmark so if God established a landmark if God put things in place you got to leave them there and you got to deal with it okay you got to stay within that boundary boundaries are good boundaries protect you and it's really important for you to pay attention to where those boundaries are now the reason this series came up is because next someone asked me about the question of vows vows are real important let me pause a minute on vows because uh in the eyes of God uh there are things said in the beginning of the Bible the middle of the Bible and the end of the Bible about vows when th vows The Vow unto God defer not to pay it for he hath no pleasure in fools pay that which thou Hast owed and it and better is it that thou should not vow then thou should vow and not pay so better off don't even enter into a vow if you're not going to pay it but if you do enter into a vow you got to pay it this is a vow this represents a vow right an engagement ring represents a vow so I'm warning you this morning this is the one thing that you need to hear and hear very clearly don't you enter into agreements or engagements unless you're sure this is the one because you don't want to back out of it when you start to go find scriptures that give you permission to back out of an engage M you're going to be huh you're going to have a tough time and if you want to find quotes where brother Brandon gives you permission to back out of an engagement you're going to have a tougher time because he's very consistent in what he says about breaking an engagement don't say it doesn't happen in our message Community it does and I know situations I know young girls that were left brother brandom had them in his church where a young boy rolled in you know look like a Believer act like a Believer uh sang like a believer smell like a Believer went to all the camps like a Believer got engaged to a certain girl and then figured out he didn't want to be married to that girl and flew the coupe now we got a 20-year-old engaged girl uh who's now not engaged anymore and let me tell you that's what I referred to as a pastor's nightmare it's a difficult thing because naturally that girl is going to want to get married and it is a serious thing and you don't want to get to that place so when you when you decide yeah if this guy asks me then I will uh then you need to be real sure you need to be real confident that this is not just based on feelings it's not just based on looks it's not just based on anything else but you know it's the will of God the problem is when you get into a relationship with somebody and uh you know you're young normal healthy young man and you're sitting next to a young girl uh that's normal healthy there's all kinds of things firing off right there's all kinds of nerve endings all of a sudden you discover you had that you never knew you had and uh it's hard for you to be neutral and brother Ram said when we pray we should pray neutral right so it it's very hard for you to pray neutral in a situation like that because you got all your emotions you know leaning a certain way and uh you know you I know how you pray in that situations I did too you know Lord whatever your will is but I know but I know Lord that your will is that sister Becky be the one and Lord I've claimed her I put the token over her and Lord I want to thank you in advance for what you're going to do for me Lord you've never failed me yet don't this time if you don't mind you know what I'm saying that you you naturally kind of lean that way I did and and that's that's a very normal thing so despite the emotional uh involvement that you have here you got to you got to figure out somehow how to make this right decision despite your emotions now I just kind of gave you the girl or the guy side of things but the girls man they tend to be just a little more emotional about this so they have sheets of paper in their Bible that say Rebecca coffee Rebecca coffee how would I sign my new signature Rebecca coffee Rebecca coffee Becka Becky coffee Becky coffee oh wow that's so nice do you have another sheet of paper and there's you know all of a sudden we're subscribing to bride magazine and wonder what colors we'll have in the wedding and all the rest of it there's a lot of emotion wrapped up in this so you got to get people on your team that are not emotional and have them to be praying with you and for you because you're going to be stupid during that time you're going to make all kinds of stupid statements during that time but I'm warning you you don't want to make this one ill advised because you know what there's no repentance for marriage there's no repentance for vows so you can switch churches and then all of a sudden you realize whoa this was not a good decision I'm going to go back to my former church you can do that and God will not frown upon it you cannot repent of your marriage and believe me I've done a lot of counseling and a lot of talking with couples over the years ministered to lots of marri couples and I've had people tell me I wish we had never done it I've had people say to me and they live in kind of a quiet silent dread every day because they know that this is really probably not the best decision and so uh it it's it's a it's a thing like brother Joe over here he tells me all the time that uh you know when something's a thing it's a thing it's a real thing and so therefore you you want to make sure that you uh that you make the right decision uh during that time next now it's a serious thing when we go to choose a wife for the vows is until death let's say it together until death all right let's do it together until death I'm only saying what he said okay until death uh do we part that's how we should keep it in other words we're not going to move the landmarks you understand what he's doing god Set this in motion hey we're we got no right to move that a man in his right mind how many do we have no I forget it guys planning a future he should choose that wife very careful guys say it with me very careful and a woman accepting the choice of a husband should be real careful guys say it real careful it's the guys that start this off so we got to make sure they get it the girl should be real careful too in what she's doing especially in these days I wonder was he talking about our day so it begs a question next how can you know if you're making the right choice or what can we impart to you today that hopefully will help you make the right choice there are three guiding principles that I want to talk about real quick because I got to go next number One never marry an unbeliever say it with me never marry an unbeliever rule number one clear as a bale it's found in scripture how can two walk uh together L they be agreed and so forth all of those different statements it's really important now if you're not sure next then in ahab's wedding instead of marrying among his own people he went over and married a sinner an idolator a worshiper of I I iol he married Jezebel she was not a Believer and no believer should ever marry an unbeliever under no circumstances say it with me under no circumstances should always marry a Believer oh I think I can get them to the altar I think after we're married I'll just sweep him right into Malachi 4 they're a really good person and I think I think we can I think I can do it good luck don't play the game right I grew up in a home like I told you yesterday I grew up in a home where Mom and Dad were on different planets when it came to spirituality and it affected everything about our household it affected everything about their relationship and uh it's scripturally it's clear it's not right according to brother brandom it's not right so you got to you got to make sure you got to look and you got to be sure that you qualify that you qualify uh this this person person now uh I don't know why this is but go next if you will go next so what we're going to do is we just introduce and and this is a the word courtship here and I can't find another word uh so this is just simply a season when you meet a a guy or girl it's you enter into a season where you have an honest and open exploration of each other's lives you begin to look at that girl as a possibility of a future mate you look at that guy as a possible future mate and you're looking at their lives their beliefs their personalities you're looking at their desires their goals their families and how they live families that build and grow towards engagement and then marriage so you're you're you're not you're not engaged but you're getting serious about looking at that person as a possible candidate until then and it's really good for you to travel in packs like wolves so it's not oneon-one oneon-one oneon-one but you're moving in a pack you're with you know like uh that that table last night was in the dining hall and had nine girls and they invited one boy that's the way to do it that's the way to do it just chew that guy up and spit him out and if he comes back well a possible candidate here but you're looking you're looking at this person to qualify and see whether this guy's got it right you girls you want to look at a guy I'll tell you this and I don't have a lot of time to get into all the examples but I'll tell you this you girls want to find a guy that loves God he's got his own Bible and he doesn't sit in the back and fall asleep and drool but he's got a Bible and he's interested in what's being preached he's into it he's all in you want to find a guy like that because he's going to have to answer for you and he's going to lead you through the most difficult and complex time that men have ever lived on the earth and and you're going to need to put your trust in confidence in that person and uh you need to be looking at that guy and say does he know who brother brandom is is he only here because it's a free lunch after church right you need to you need to look at that guy does he have a love for the Lord does he does he know anything about the Bible uh does he you know is he does he pray is he is he able to pray does he work you want to look at that guy does he work is he does he just play video games does he think that the government's going to supply everything is he just spouting conspiracy theories or does he work I mean that's a good thing you guys like I said the other day in my devotional group stand up here you sometimes as pastors turn this way sometimes as pastors what we need to do is get the young guys take them by the lapels and shake them a lot just shake them a lot and say get your act together get a job save money you good save money because you're going to need it down the road and and you want to you girls you want to look at a guy who's not just you know nicel looking stand no don't don't stand up stand you want to get a guy that's you know he's he's got a mind for God that's what you want to look at and you want to guys you want to look for a girl uh that has more than just a black belt and MasterCard especially her father's MasterCard right you want to look for a girl uh who's not just you know when she's she's just into it for the looks right so she's dressed like this and if you could put words to the way she dresses it's like all right everyone I'm going to the bathroom now in the middle of service [Applause] hi sorry should I not have said that yeah is is she just there to present herself uh you know in a way that gets everybody attention why are you talking about this why is it important because of the value that God places on the promise and the engagement and the vows of marriage so they are important here here all right next so let's talk about some of the steps here to a Godly decision how do we do it or what can I leave you that prevent you from making a stupid decision a bad decision okay and I want to just leave this with you because I I got to go we want to start with a clean slate so what you want to do is uh if you've had ideas about uh you know things that maybe like how they do it in the world because the world is notorious for moving landmarks right when it comes to the word love the world has moved matter of fact the world has basically done away with landmarks right and now it's a free-for-all out there and you've got to make sure that you develop a real definition about what love is and what God meant what God intended there what the Bible declares well you got to get yourself a Bible and you got to let the word reshape your thinking and repent of any mistakes because we all make them and and you need to you need to say Lord Lord hey I I i' I've messed up I've made some mistakes but I I want to get on the right track and so Lord let the word reshape it I'll give you some stuff here and we teach this in our church here and uh it's it's uh it's a good thing for you to tap into some of the principles that are related to this second thing that you want to do is get people on your side so you want to have Pastor pastor's wife uh your parents maybe Elders uh somebody who can you can talk to about this uh important subject next and then thirdly want to establish clear boundaries so you as a young person you want to say uh you know this this is this is what I'm going to do and these are the boundaries that I have and you want to establish those boundaries and know where your weakness and limitations are some of you have weaknesses when it comes to the computer or social media pornography right you got to learn to keep those weaknesses covered Because You're vulnerable in that area and you got to know those uh weaknesses and what constitute a wrong setting and how to find appropriate activity because we're made like a car without brakes physically we're made like a car without brakes you know a car with brakes can stop anywhere but a car without brakes has got to be very careful how far he goes because if you're on the flat no problem but if you're on an incline and you get rolling they no stopping right so a lot of times and and I will tell you this I I was uh doing a a camp one time was all young people just like you and one brother came to me afterwards and he said he said brother Barry I have one problem with what you said today and I said oh and he said yeah you weren't strict enough you weren't strong enough in what you said I said really tell me your story and he said well he said I was the son of a pastor and my wife now was the daughter of a pastor and because we were preachers kids uh we got lots of uh we got lots of uh uh room you know we had lots of free time and we were unchaperoned there was nobody around and we spent lots of time together just her and I and then we got engaged and uh he said it was a long engagement pause I don't like long engagements myself now sometimes they're they're they're necessary but in this case they had a long engagement the feeling Creeps in well we're going to get married anyway so we can take a little liberty here and a little liberty there and he said when my wife got to the altar wearing all white because everybody thought she was a virgin and I lifted the veil off her head and kissed her he said she felt like a horrible hypocrite in front of that congregation because they had slept together because they had lots of Liberty they had lots of free time together and everybody trusted him because they were preachers kids and he said it took my wife 10 years to forgive herself for what happened he said our life was murder our life was terrible for the first 10 years of our marriage because he said she was so racked with guilt and I was too he said you need to tell these young people very strictly that they need to have boundaries because we're made like a car without without brakes and so therefore uh it's really important for you to set boundaries and if some guy you know uh he he wants to uh you know he's at youth retreat and he's you know he sides up and wants to get email address or that's the old days if he wants to get you know a social media thing and then he you know he reaches over and puts his arm around you wants to hold your hand or something you tell him I said to you go take a long walk on a short pier or go play in the traffic okay and if he doesn't if he doesn't you call me I'll tell them you know what's interesting I have had people call me me and I've talked to some of these guys that's the truth seriously uh you know you have a right to refuse and you need to know where all right this guy's crossed a line or this guy's wanting me to cross a line and I'm not going to do it you need to you need to establish those boundaries in your mind and in your heart but remember it's going to be really hard for you to do that when you're in the moment it's going to I tell you it's going to be next it's going to be really hard for you to uh resist and refuse because you're going to uh you're going to feel terrible when that happens I'll tell you you're going to feel terrible when that happens but you need to do that my wife and I you know we had we had boundaries and we we kept those boundaries and I I was really thankful and when I whenever I marry somebody uh I'm already married but when I perform a marriage let's say it that way I always ask the guy and my guys are here from hbt none of them are married I don't think but I always ask the guy before the wedding on the the wedding day when he's standing there looking like a deer between the headlights and he's nervous as anything and he's just dressed in a tuxedo and his future mother-in-law is telling him things and I always tell just shut up and don't say anything just just look pretty for the pictures that's all you need to do today just look good for the pictures but I always ask him in a private moment is this your first kiss at the altar because I believe that's where it should be brother bandam said in the countdown that's where it should be he said the first time you kiss that girl is when you lift the veil at the altar and I remember one time I was uh sitting with my two and my sister before I got married and we were sitting in the in the kitchen and uh she's not a Believer there two of them are believers she's not a Believer and uh so we were sitting there talking about marriage and for some reason or another I said uh to them I said um yeah this will be the first time I ever uh kissed Becky it' be at the wedding and it was in our conversation with my two brothers but my sister rolled in on that conversation a little bit late but she heard me say that's the first time I'll kiss Becky uh when when we're at the altar and she had just taken a mouthful of food and she went just like that and uh she said run that by me again I said well that's the first time I'm going to kiss Becky and uh she said what about if you don't like the way she's kissing that was her question I said what about if you don't like the way she's kissed and you've never kissed her before now you're stuck I said you know what you I said that's what the message teaches and I believe the message and I believe if I honor that God will take care of the rest and he did but hey either we believe it or we don't right and I I I believe I believe that's a landmark personally and I believe we don't have a right to move it no matter how emotional the setting next courtship is about seeking a made for marriage one man man one woman for life that's the idea one man one woman for life and it develops an honorable and respectful treatment of other people in case it doesn't result in marriage because sometimes when you move in a little closer and it doesn't work you know what that's the grace of God in your life because you can back away but you ought to be able to back away clean you ought to be back you ought to be able to back away without apologizing I'm not looking at you guys because I'm looking at you guys but and I I'm not picking on your anything else but I know there's some folks here that are you know looking at one another and and so forth and that's great but I will tell you if it doesn't work you ought to thank God for the consolation that now you know but you should be able to back away and not have to go to them sorry I put my arm around you and sorry I kissed you and sorry you should be able to do that walk away clean so you got to conduct your your your relationship with that girl at all times in a way that you can back out without regret and without having that girl to go tell some future guy yeah he kissed me and he touched me in this way and because a a girl should declare that to her future husband right and so therefore it's really important for us to keep that in mind and you develop that honor it's it's about honor and respect and those things are important here next the goal is to become ready or mature enough to enter into a commitment if it shows to be God's will so this is a time of testing now so I in my Curious way I went to Brother braham's uh daughters and uh I asked them I said what did Brother Bram tell you about you know meeting a guy what did Brother mam say to you and uh the answer I thought was very interesting and brother Bram said if you're going to get involved with a guy he should be a Christian number one and he should maintain a healthy distance at all times and this is what he said a a simple handshake after church maybe that's what he told the girls a simple handshake after church maybe now let me show you how a handshake doesn't go sister God bless you great to have you today at church hey you know what our church wouldn't be the same without you today you look really nice and M fact of all the girls that are here I think You Stand Out Among the girls yeah and you know what uh I'll be here next Sunday so uh you know maybe we could shake hands in the parking lot next Sunday too shaking hands doesn't take a half hour and brother brandom wanted to make sure that nothing got started because you know why we're made like a car without breaks and all of a sudden that girl starts to think things that she shouldn't think and uh you know uh it's just like if a guy rolls up to a girl here at the retreat and says hey you know how are you doing I no you're here at the retreat that's not a proposal and sometimes guys don't do that to girls because you know they're afraid the girl will whoa hello there there hello there yeah where you been all my life whoa praise God in the meantime next in the meantime you want to strengthen the inner man you want to develop your spiritual life with God right you want to you want to have a relationship with God that is real and like Joe says it's a thing it's a real thing and I have a living relationship with God and I want to I want to develop that because that's a season God's given me to do that okay and you want to seek opportunities to serve so I I got my guys uh usually started I had four boys we decide to have boys when we got married and uh I had all of them get tracked and start thinking about their careers and stuff uh when they were 12 13 14 going into high school and they were then I had them seeking God what gifts and talents is God giving in you what has what has God shown you as something that you could develop for the kingdom because whoo because that's going to be important here and you want to lean into that you want to recognize those gifts that God's given you lean into that you want to seek opportunities to serve you want to ask the Holy Spirit to be your elaser and reveal his will in season and don't enter into vows unless you're absolutely certain of the will of God I can't say it enough I can't say it strong enough because when you vow vow and defer not to pay it someone's not happy next and then on the last thing and girls especially you need to guard your heart because out of it are the issues of life and I wish we had more time to deal with this scripture but you have to guard your heart because you know Hallmark teaches us that you know you fall and fall fast fall hard it's got to be over an hour right so that's that's the way we're taught in our society and everything is very fast but in this case you want to do the opposite you want to do it slow and and you want to be real careful you want to next you want to keep the relationships out of the Romantic zone so you want to communicate from the start that this Association is platonic that it is friendship only and you make a friend uh make a friend a friend of the family and you want to avoid spending time alone like I said and then certain topics like longterm plans for our future you want to you want to kind of refrain from discussing dreams how many kids do you ever do you want to have and all these other kinds of things that suggest or lean towards or tend towards intimacy hey let me give you a little rule of thumb you can write this down if you're writing it down girls you can share this one over here in the world the practice is the mindset is intimacy comes before commitment intimacy precedes commitment it is the total opposite with us that commitment precedes intimacy so in the world they'll say well I'll date a girl I'll sleep with a girl I'll live with a girl uh we'll move in together and then if we like it we'll get married and I'll guarantee you when a girl feels like she's being tried out like a used car she's going to feel like that especially when he goes and trades in that model and gets another one it it is a moving of the landmarks and you don't want to do that commitment precedes intimacy we commit first and then all the rest follows okay that's the rule that's how it should be so we avoid certain topics like long-term plans and saving your uh you know your most intimate thoughts until later next we avoid counseling that creates dependency so sometimes a girl says oh he tells me everything he feels really he says he says he feels really comfortable with me and he can tell me everything and so therefore I feel like I'm helping him over this hurdle I'm helping him through this crisis that he's going through and so he needs me he needs me and you can get involved in that too much you know what if he's got a real dilemma if you got and I've seen it I've seen it where people have said that to girls and the girls have said you need to go see my pastor okay see you later because you know what the crisis was not really a crisis after all girls watch the way you dress because it greatly affects the whether guys view you as a friend or an object you had to be modest you had to practice modesty and that's that's just that's just basic stuff but it's really important because guys are affected guys are visual creatures I'm a visual person I'm a visual learner and uh you know if I if I see somebody uh you know build something and I watch them do it I remember one time I went to a a picture framing coming to get a picture frame for a church and they were going to charge like back then 00 something dollars I thought sorry but I thought wow that's crazy and I went and I got bought a book and I looked at how it was done and I did that and then I eventually uh started a framing picture framing company and so forth and you can send me your pictures I'll charge you two or $300 to get them but I'm a visual person and so you need girls you need to understand because you don't see this yourself you are uh you're um a lot of you girls who are right here and naturally beautiful and naturally pretty and so forth and uh you had to be careful how you present yourself uh and I'm not saying that you need to wear flower sacks not at all but you need to be careful about how you present yourself okay and and be modest guys also need to practice modesty as well next if you will so we're going to have I'm sorry we're going to have to wrap it up next oh no yeah things that are clearly not just friendship okay being alone a lot together saying I love you and other intimate comments that should be reserved I think until you're engaged or you're right there at engagement I think so despite all the little buttons you can push on your phone I think it's really good to say I love you to the person that you really love because that's a strong word now it's not in the world right it's not in the world in Hallmark is over an an hour but in but in God's world and you don't have a right to to move the landmarks that's what's really important here and holding hands hugging and kissing and looking with wanting eyes at each other and maybe even drooling I I got that from Paul okay next finding a wife means finding a good thing and the main thing your relationship with God has to come first if it doesn't then it's not all if it does not then it seems like all dos and don'ts it seems like rules okay but my relationship with him is not merely one of my relationship it it is the relationship by which I understand every other relationship does that make sense it regulates all others and if this one is correct and healthy it enables me to right be the right kind of a brother father husband and friend next brother bramman talking about Rebecca he said she was a virgin the beautiful Rebecca that married the righteous seed of God's promise Isaac that they were two listen two consecrated Spirit-filled Believers on God foreordained to the very marriage that they United together by and God forew it and if God forew it for them could you believe that God has foreordained somebody for you it's just possible next brother mam says a man nowadays getting married you young fellas you better pray a long time guys say it with me a long time say it again a long time you better pray and ask God to give you a companion you young women the same way say girls say it with me same way same way good because it's so uncertain and a man when he chooses a life companion he usually inquires of her life what family she's out of and her background we have to have a basis let's say that you're interested in a girl and her family doesn't go to church they're Believers in the message they're at the youth camp but they don't believe in going to church they believe it's okay to stay home and listen to tapes or it's okay to stream but now you're a person who was raised and going to church that's your normal she's got a normal that normal is different than your normal you know what we got to have a conversation and we got to have a conversation before we do this right CU you know what that might be a problem going forward and so we got to talk about that stuff and let me tell you it happens next and last brother Braham said now the king of Israel was ahab's son who had succeeded his father who had married out of the the Jewish people just like today when a Christian boy marries a sinner girl or a sinner girl a Christian boy don't you get married unless you're equally yed together with Believers to keep trouble down and when God made men and women in the beginning he made their Spirits then there's someone for you just wait say this with me I'll wait I'll wait because I'd rather be in the will of God than not be in the will of God Heavenly Father we thank you for your word thank you for the standards we thank you Lord for the boundaries that you have put in place may we always be the kind of people that respect the landmarks Lord in all of our decisions and choices we want to be found in the center of your will and we want to be doing EX exactly what you would have us to do but Lord in this area especially we want to be mindful and thoughtful of your will help us Lord in this important area I commit the young people now into your hands pray to Lord that they would go away maybe with some new insight into how important a decision this really is it is truly the second most important decision in their lives I thank you Lord for my wife I thank you Lord for our years together and our family and grandchildren Lord I Thank you for all the blessings that making the right choice brings and Lord I can truly say that when I found a wife I found a good thing and I'm thankful have your way Lord among this group of young people we pray we thank you for them for all that's happened here at the camp in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen all right now everybody hold it I hav got time Adam where's Adam stand up all right everybody say goodbye to Adam say bye Adam he's going with me to the airport see you later God bless you yeah all yours thank you again brother Barry we appreciate it let's give him another hand we appreciate him give him good talk to us this morning I think she ESS essential things for life and um a lot of years you know teaching these things and the benefit of having many years of the retreat and uh having many generation couple Generations come through now is that you get to hear back the ones who kind of took these things serious and just said hey you know I'm going to apply these things and then they get 10 years into the marriage or even further and you get to hear testimonies back is that some of those essential things that we learned at Retreat and through our pastor as well um some of those things that are that we applied they're still enjoying the benefits of it uh many many years later the other bad side of it is that somebody comes back in a situation that they ignored these things and thought they weren't important love you buddy see you later love see you next year okay um so you get to see sometimes the negative side somebody said these aren't important they don't apply to me uh they move the boundaries or they just said uh you know they don't apply to me because I'm I'm all right I'll handle this on my own and when we start going down those Paths of thinking they're not important and essential to apply things like this then then you get to eat the fruit of uh things sometimes and it doesn't turn out good there are stories that are not good that come from ones who have been and and brother Barry kind of and AR kind of tease each other sometimes on the phone cuz we'll see on social media we'll see things happen and people you know uh you know kissing before marriage and doing and moving the boundaries and changing things even within the message and we kind of teas to say we ought to get together sometime maybe between Christmas and New Year we ought to have a meeting where we get the youth together and just talk about scriptural principles and and we we ought to have something maybe called the winter youth retreat we're being sarcastic because we've been doing this a long time but some people people who've been here don't think they're important they start think they're under different rules and then they be begin to eat the fruit of that and that's the negative side but there is a positive side there's a lot of healthy marriages and testimonies that come from good things it may be now in your life when God brings somebody it might be five years from now doesn't really matter if you're satisfied and that's the that's the thing in the first most important decision you must be satisfied and content with your walk with the Lord first because what happens if you're not satisfied with your relationship with the Lord and you're content with that then then you're going to replace a relationship with a guy or girl with what you should be getting from the Lord you see that's how we work as a human being we're craving something we're craving companionship and beyond beyond the sexual thing and passions where Barry talked about that's a part of our human being who we are but We crave something deeper than just uh being with somebody uh sexually in marriage or something We crave C intimacy We crave Oneness We crave relationship God made us a relational be being his first words was when he created ad it is not good for man to be alone and so he made us a relational being so he put a craving within us Adam was feeling lonely God put that in him for for for Eve for a companion for somebody close to him and so we all have that within us the problem is is that when we try to replace that craving for God with a guy or a girl and we shouldn't have that first that's why the second most important decision is who we would marry in life but the first one has to be filled you should be content you should be happy going along and when you're that way you're not making foolish decisions to jump too quickly into a relationship to make something happen with somebody you know we're we're pretty strict here as far as the boundaries and we bring the strict boundaries of the scriptures and guidelines we honor them when we teach them uh if you honor God's things uh even when the flesh don't want it when you honor it God's going to honor you God's going to honor your future marriage God's going to honor your life so we're pretty sick but I want to let everybody know brother Barry and I we're we're not against romance we're not against falling in love we're not against these things cuz you know if you meet somebody and you start to really become attracted to them that's a part of us too so we're not against that but when that is more important when that's more important than the essential solid things to make a decision for marriage uh commitment getting to know one another and and a lot of times when you enter into a physical thing to early you connect physically first when you're not supposed to connect physically first that's left for marriage so you you unite in Soul first do you believe the same do you believe the same message do you can you Fellowship around the word of God can you openly say what God's doing in your life you're with a guy and he never talks about that he never says anything about God he never says anything about the services he never see says anything about God correcting him never even brings it up uh you better girl you better back away from that because he should be able to talk about that freely it's not like he has to be a preacher and talk about it all the time but there's going to be if God is in his life God's going to pop up in his conversation and if it's not then you can't even connect with him in a soul level and that's where you got to connect first and example my wife and I is that we were already established in the word of God the new birth everything and so we quickly connected on talking about what was being preached talking about what the Lord was showing us it was easy to come into a union that way in conversation that was first and then you kind of connect the second way emotionally as you get closer you connect in emotional intim intimacy where you get to know one another you get to know one another's personalities and you start to connect emotionally if you jump the first two steps and in and introduce physical then you basically I shouldn't say abort but you you you do away with the first two steps and you do like the world they jump they jump the first night in bed they jump the first night to physical um and then everything else is eliminated that supposed to come first and that's so what we we teach that but that being said again we're not against um the part that is a part of our human being is that you know you don't want to just be married to somebody just because they have message books and okay this is the one for me there is an attraction you do fall in love but don't put those things first and brother brandom taught the same thing in choosing of a bride you choose based upon who they are character and their characters who they are how they tick how they live and so I'll go back to that point again that you should be content and satisfied with your walk with the Lord and if you can't say that here you you you can say I don't have the Holy Ghost yet and I love people to be honest that way I don't have that real experience with God or I do but I don't feel stable and solid yet I want to see that grow praise God God bless you for that type of statement that's an honest statement and it would be really bad to bring someone else into your life cuz the way God made us is we're going to jump to all of our affections and Cravings being fulfilled in that person rather than the Lord first so in whatever state you are in your singlehood now which is your state be content be content with your walk with the Lord and you know for me my sister got married before I was she my she got married at I think 19 and I got a testimony about my sister here in a little bit I'm going to share with you uh as we begin in some testimonies um but she got married and so I was at the ripe young AG I didn't get married till 27 so she she's second I'm firstborn she got married before me and I I got a little resentful cuz I thought you know hey wait a minute I'm the oldest one here I should have got married first I mean it's it's isn't there some type of scriptural rule that the firstborn gets married I was looking for it you know and I actually got resentful and then I got a little angry at God because you know the the girl wasn't coming along and I talked to a few sisters and different things and just didn't come out right and and uh so boy you know so I had a couple years there that actually in being older I become a resentful towards God I be become uh you know this is not happening for me I'm trying to live a good Christian Life here and and uh so I but if you get resentful and you get angry like that it's almost like God can distance himself even further because God wants you to be content and satisfied with his will and where you're at right now he doesn't want you living in the future that life doesn't begin till I get married that's a lie life begins now with the Lord and you have a completely contented life with the Lord very happy serving the lord coming to church uh that needs to be first and so then but I when I realized I was resentful then I started to ask God to forgive me and ask God to take that away from me and when I come to the place then and I was about 26 then when I come to the place that I said Lord and I was willing to say Lord I am content with what you've given me in my life right now I was doing things to serve the Lord I'd already been ministering going to different things doing things for the Lord God I'm I'm content doing this and I said Lord I'd be willing like Paul in the Bible and I I had to mean this from my I'd be willing to go this journey as a single person serving you I I I'd be willing to do it if that's what your will is and you know when I said that minute from the heart it wasn't just a few months later God brings sister Rebecca into my life Bang Bang bang bang bang bang done they happen very quickly and so we got to work some of these things out with the Lord you see and he knows us and he there might be some things that we need to work through with the Lord um and only God knows those things you know only God knows when completely we're ready uh and so but we want to make sure that the Lord knows that we're ready he's prepared us and you've given him time for you to grow in many things uh but you know at the same time God know God has his will for your life and God will show you I guess you know if you got a specific question sometimes about but really you know how do you find that will of God it's kind of like following him content and patient and you look for green lights from the Lord or you look for red lights because there's a couple relationships I had with girls that um I thought okay this is I think this is it I think this is it and then as time went on I started to feel some checks in my heart and and I wasn't being honest about it I was just feeling my heart you got to be honest about those little checks that you feel they were red lights and it was cuz because if you're praying neutral I like what brother Barry said about you know really truly praying neutral not saying Lord you know uh make me happy um if you're really praying new say God I really do want your will then you're willing to wait you're willing to say Lord I I want your will God will honor that prayer if you're really truly neutral God will honor it and he'll give you red lights little signs along the way this isn't right or he'll keep giving you green lights green lights okay and more and more it gets confirmed in your heart okay this is I believe this is the one and and then then that Revelation drops this is the one for me now uh anyway you know what for Mar I we can talk about courtship and marriage all day long so I got to cut it off here pretty soon um but I hope these things are a blessing to you we get a little criticism uh and I don't want to talk about Chris but we get some for talking about these things openly to the young people and talking about them practical a little bit of humor in there but um I'm not afraid of the criticism because I've seen the fruit in young people that will apply these things I see their marriages now I see their children I see their home life and you you're going to be blessed if you honor God's simple principles you're going to be blessed by it amen don't avoid them don't think you're under different rules than what's being taught here they're for every body God knows human beings and he knew what to put in place as boundaries for us to be able to have Abundant Life can you say amen I think someone read the scripture last night uh uh I think it was that you know he he come to give us life and life more abundant that's our Lord praise the Lord so I was going to ask for before we go uh some testimonies we got a little bit of time here and I'd like to hear back some Reflections sometimes I ask you to write a little note of uh something the Lord did for you or something that you liked about retreat or even CR uh constructive criticism something you you think we should change if you if you have that go ahead and give it to us Ian why don't you to come up and give your a couple announcements there a way to we can communicate one with one another this year um so um so we're going to have some testimonies we'll just do them here something the Lord spoke to you something the lord gave you in this meeting we'd sure like to hear that back it's just a reflection it' be an encouragement to everybody else so be thinking of that and we'll have just a few here then I want to give my sister's test Tony to she was healed of cancer here Ian all right so real quick for the photos buz we can put that up you can't be up here back nope you can only

everybody has you can get it there or if you're in the telegram group you can also get it there but right now day one and day two are in there and the following days will be coming here very soon also one more thing I wanted to do this last night but I wasn't able to I wanted to call out a couple people who really helped me I wasn't alone this time there's John Olen Esther Olsen and Elena quinland wherever you guys are they are a big help to me so thank you guys as well so Ian so you guys are setting up a telegram for this Retreat for this year that's already set up that's already been set up

well so all right so I'm going to come out here and I I would appreciate that if you're closer I can give you the microphone but you could um uh you could just come up my way if you're from this here just walk up and just get it lined up up here if you have a testimony did you forget something you probably saw it's not working sorry I'll fix the QR code and I'll put up a new one in a second here you're failing us after all this week um all right who has a testimony while you're coming just line up here if you want to just say something quickly as a testimony of this Retreat or something the Lord's done in your life my sister uh early on in this year learned that she had um she she's surprised she is stage four cancer and she had a couple tumors in her body already growing and um so of course we get begin to pray and begin to put things before the Lord and she she did do some chemo this was kind of new to our family had hadn't had a lot of cancer and so to have a stage four and not much hope you know of Sur of survival with it it was quite a a shock to wasn't Ike for our family because we've never had that too much and so this is my sister Sharon and so we just want to give glory to God I just want to give glory to God give the devil a black eye because something that looked very hopeless God has completely restored and it was it was three weeks ago I guess something like that and she came back with a completely cancer-free report from the doctor there's no cancer none left in her body none left amen there's no trace of the tumors so uh God is good God is mighty and God is still still able to do the impossible we thank God for God's spirit in our life come on and these are short so um keep it short well I just wanted to testify um the other when I came here I was just battling a lot of guilt and just feeling worthless and just had a lot of failures and everything till it was just a huge burden on my heart and just I wasn't myself and then the other night I came to The Altar and I was just praying just talking to the Lord and then just from my heart I just started confessing I'm not a failure I'm not a failure and I just watched that thing completely roll out of my life and I just felt such a freedom and I just wanted to testify about [Applause] that so on the note of Sharon actually I think the first time I've ever felt God's faith like God's faith that she that anyone was going to be healed was for sister Sharon because like as soon as I think the first time I went to pray for her it just dropped in my heart she's going to be fine so but on the uh note of something for me um I similar I came in this meeting kind of feeling like a failure as a Christian and the first the first night you know that went away and the second night like just felt so much more settled in my identity in the Lord and I just feel ready to go back and just really be me so I'm going to be a lot more annoying now thank you for letting us know ahead of [Applause] time I'm so nervous right now are you nervous a little bit oh we'll get through this all right so there's something there's something that I've been struggling with uh for years and I go to I go to different camps and I just stand there and uh I'd sing and I'd see a lot of people going up to the altar um and I really felt like uh I was like building up a a Heart of Stone really but uh I got to the point where just last night something something just broke inside me and I just I broke down I started crying and um I went up to the Altar and I I kept asking Lord please forgive me please forgive me and then eventually started turning to thank you and thank you Lord so yeah this my first time here and I'm definitely going to be coming back again it's been wonderful yeah I want to thank the Lord for this the wonderful things that he he's he's given to us this this Camp the thing that brother Jack had last night really spoke to my heart I was able to just kind of get on a personal level with God and even after the the service last night we were in our our dorm room last night just us five guys and we really had a a long heart-to-heart conversation about God and I I've never felt it that deep before and I was just on such a spiritual high and I'm I'm still there and I I don't want to just stay on the spiritual high but I want to like feed my experience so I just want to thank him for that that confidence and to not only get closer with God but to get closer with with my brothers and it's it's very really important that you stay close with your brothers and so I I I thank the Lord for that experience and there's nothing like it so Praise His Name the Lord amen you want to put that other QR code up too besides that one just in case somebody didn't get the other teaching materials and such so this past year I had been really struggling with my faith and and had had gotone to the point where I was really struggling on whether or not I had salvation whether or not I had receive Jesus in the first place and so Thursday night I felt such a pool to go to the Altar and I was just crying my heart out to God and I just kept saying over and over again in my mind like I've been so foolish like how could you still love me even after all the mistakes I made this year cuz I felt like such a failure of a Christian and I just kept saying that over and over again and then just something real still and small just spoke in my heart that was like I never stop loving you and it it was just honestly a confirmation I guess that even though I still make mistakes you know Jesus has always been there in my life and I've I've never been so sure of my salvation until then so hallelujah thank you he never stops loving us it's unconditional love come on brother anybody else who wants to say something come come on up front here so you're already ready available well this is my second year here at the retreat and I'm always glad to come here and uh I was end of this year of this last year I was playing a lot of loneliness and um not a lot of social happening end of my end of the year and all that and I came here I really want to see more friends and people I wanted to you know be more of a group of Youth people and all that and um I started talking to people people friends me and new people and I found out that brother Barry's church is 10 minutes from my house and I never knew that that and I feel like that was I think I was answer my prayer having social and getting to me more friends with people but and um I also want to say I up to get prayed on Thursday night and there's something like has been bothering my life for many years and I going to profess it I'm going to say it and I got prayed for and I'm going to say I'm going to leave it here I'm going to go home a new person amen Bud it here God bless you um so like the Friday night service was totally for me not Friday night um sorry what day is it Saturday today Saturday today's Saturday so it would have been we started Thursday when yes so Thursday night the first pre uh sermon Brother Sam preached um because he was kept talking about like this quiet sister that's me um and I guess I've been dealing with guilt cuz like I'm so quiet in like in church usually I'm a very quiet person and it was just like your life can be the noise like that's the big thing so that was just like the most wonderful thing that it's okay God made me this way so yeah tremendous thanks appreciate it there was some there were some other people ministered to that way you know um and I just would say this we all each have our own way that God deals with us and our our personalities and different things and we should never be put in a box under certain meetings that someone can testify say this is what happened to me when I received the Holy Ghost and so they you compare yourself so that H has to happen with me what you need to do is just yield your life and bring true repentance to God and what emotion comes from that that's that's between you and God and I don't think it's right to to force a certain thing that has to happen and so I've heard that a lot from the young people just let God do do the work and if there's an altar call let him bring you to the Altar and let the let the work be done by the Lord so I just want to testify of some physical healing uh of just a spoonful of the Mountain Moving I several years ago I played soccer and I had a head injury and from that then afterwards my jaw just clicks really loudly it's not a huge deal like you know but it's something that I don't have to live with you know and the devil might try to come to me and say like well it's not a huge deal don't worry about it you can live with it you know but I don't have to live with it you know and so when when brother Samuel or no brother Jack I think was talking about you know get rid of the baby Philistines too and I'm like I'm not leaving this baby Philistine here so I just want to testify that it's going to be gone even if it's not gone now A Spoonful move the other night is it visible not really does it matter no it's going to be gone one day I like the confession buddy I like it I like it just going to piggyback off of uh what Zion was talking about uh over the past few years I've uh had a couple back injuries and it's just been a real real struggle back pain is not not fun especially when you're only 21 so but uh got God prayed for the other night and I am feeling the best I felt in 2 years and it has been absolutely amazing and I just can't thank the Lord enough healing to you Rebecca okay so I really felt like last night's service was really for me and I really really needed it cuz during the song service I was like okay God I need I need a service about victory over like your old self I need encouragement to know that like I am not my old me and my mistakes and failures before Christ are not who I am anymore and I was like I I just really really need some encouragement and then I had that service I was like I I am so thankful I needed that cuz I was born to destroy the old me who I was before I got Christ and I'm just really really grateful cuz I really really needed the encouragement these are all so encouraging we appreciate it someone else so encouraging anybody else how about one of the guys there from South Africa all the way from South Africa the furthest must have been a long walk they've been through a little something there was your grandfather was the pastor there passed away instantly and so it's been a rough road through the church there and such you know but I didn't mean to call you on the spot but just wanted to hear from you so first here I just want to say God bless everyone here um God bless from South Africa um it's always such a blessing to come to a completely different country on the opposite end of the world and that Spirit just moves through the people and it was just such a wonderful experience for me to know that while we are bound by by place and time and we can only be in one place at once but that same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead is still moving everywhere across this Earth for God's people and it's such a blessing the unity that I feel here man it feels like I'm home like the The Same Spirit between the youth between the the facilitators it's just that peace of God that's in each of his children and it's such a blessing to be here so thank you for the organizers and praise God for all his glory amen thanks for coming buddy where's where's the sister from London then London England is she here or she had to leave do you mind saying something no yes oh okay both of you sisters are from London both of them all right come on and is there a sister here from South America Peru or Ecuador where is she at will you say something well I understood what you said just now um okay good thank you God bless you all um I'm really really grateful to be here and to have the opportunity of um fellowshipping with you all um I was told about these meetings and um um apart from many years ago when I went to a different Camp it's so nice to see so many young people who really love the Lord and not ashamed to actually seek for you know seek prayer seek God go to the altar um and you know I I just hope that you know people back in in in England and in different places in Europe it would be so nice for them to see that the same way they are you know we're all seeking God and wanting a closer uh relationship with God that's the same thing that's happening across you know the US Canada and um I um yeah I I just thank God for just being able to to come here and uh yeah fellowship with you all yeah thanks for coming um yeah I guess a small testimony is um I think I was battling with a lot of a lot of things um before I kind of decided to sing um something um I think for me it was like will I be accepted for who I am um how I move how I sing how I act um I think there's a lot of fear actually um around that and I think I spoke to a few of the girls I was like I don't know if I should sing or or not um something in me kept on saying just just do it I know it's the Holy Spirit but um I said to Gideon I was like I have a song and this is at 5:00 p.m. before the service um yesterday and then he was like yeah yeah okay okay maybe he might sing he might not sing and I was like oh okay um so I practiced the song um and you know just singing and and actually you know brother Paul you turning and saying when you said that like sing again I think to me that was like actually people accept me for who I am like that's okay it's okay to be who you are um and I think in a lot of conversations with the young people here today um I think a lot of us are struggling with like like the somebody else was saying like it's okay to be you you don't have to be somebody else and God has made you unique and just be who you are because at the end of the day if people can't accept you for you then maybe they're not yeah maybe that's their problem maybe they're not worth being with anyways um so yeah um thank you for accepting me for me I guess [Applause] it's just like fire shut up in my bones it's that Holy Ghost Fire and it shut up in my bones it's just like fire shut up in my bones well it's that Holy Ghost Fire and it shut up in my bones well some people get offended because I dance and shout and they say that's too much emotion and too much moving about but don't you tell me to be quiet a go sit down in my chair because if

Holy Ghost Fire and it shut up in my Bon thank you thank you thank you yeah yeah praise the Lord fire shut up in my M Holy Ghost [Music] oh been my it shut up in my Mo praise the Lord so you're from

testimony about this cam um I was feeling so sick uh two days ago and I was with Sam we both were feeling so bad and we took medicine but it was not working sister Miran was doing a lot of things she was so nice and so one day yesterday I told some hey you we we need to pray because we really want to be in the camp we really want to enjoy it and listen to our mon to do everything and she said okay wake up and let's pray she prayed and after that right away we start feeling so good and that's all and I've been so blessing it's nice to meet people around the world so keep going God bless you all thanks for coming appreciate it God bless you amen where are you from Indiana Indiana right no we're exotic overseas in Indiana right so my testimony is a little bit different um I'm kind of testifying it to everyone to kind of just praise the Lord anyhow um so the other night it was last night I was praying to God um just about some life choices and just the direction I I didn't know where I wanted to go I just had a few choices I need to make I'm just praying to God for an answer of where I should go cuz I wanted his will I just wanted to completely surrender to him and um as I was praying it just it felt like so quiet that God like just wasn't answering like I kept praying I kept emptying myself I kept surrendering and I'm like God please just speak to me like I've heard you speak to me before and just and on it went on people were singing rejoicing and I just kept like grabbing at what felt like it wasn't there and but I knew I knew God could answer so I just I just kept going I said God I'm not leaving until I get an answer and people were rejoicing around me it was getting towards the end nobody was left at the altar and I was still praying in my seat and finally when I was spent on tears and just completely like emotionally like gone like I was in my my seat and just there was no more praying it was just lay there and then finally like during the prayer I had asked God just one word just anything I'm willing for anything and finally towards the end of it I got just wait and it may not be the answer I wanted or was praying for but I'm going to praise God anyway that he gave me an answer and I'm just going to hold on to that just wait believing that he knows what's best for me and he's got it just wait praise the Lord [Applause] awesome you you had to endure Berry coffee there that was great it was great I'm sitting there and Devil's fighting me like crazy he's giving me heart racing now right now I'm I'm getting dizzy right now seriously cuz Satan's fighting me that sister that just sung she spoke directly to me because I was sitting there everybody's testimony is better than me I'm sitting there last night um I came to this Camp as I'm always guilty I don't feel like forgiveness is accepted I know it is but I'm sitting there I'm like God please forgive me I've done all these things immediately when I said God forgive me the song came on there's forgiveness at the cross or the song that we sung last night immediately within a second of me saying please forgive me and I was like that was it yes but that it's amazing and now Satan's fighting me right now because I can't remember what else I was going to say you're giv a black eye you got up here you're talking about I know there's probably more people here that's like his testimony or her testimony so much better than mine I can't amount to that and like she said it's important to be yourself and Satan was telling me you're not you're so little your God's forgiveness it's nothing compared to other people but I was like fight it fight it boo devil do devil all right just one more just one more cuz we got to get to our uh rooms and get stuff out who's got everything out of your room raise your hand okay if you don't I'm going to have to dismiss you in a minute to go do that because we should be out of the rooms at least by 12 before we go to lunch come on hey buddy listen don't let the devil talk to you and anybody else here we've heard so many things you're more quiet in nature you're not you're going you're not going to sing like this sister as far as but we need to be ourselves you're quiet you had a lot of people get up with testimony their choir they' probably never even got up in front of people like this but they overcome it you got got to be yourself and give a testimony to the Lord you're already way ahead cuz you're a redhead you realize that right I had red hair just like you it's special red hair and freckles is special above anybody else so that itself should encourage you plus you're a Son of God yep and then I I married a wife who likes freckles cuz of when we started to get know one another I had to know a couple things I said first do you have the Holy Ghost and then my second question to my wife is what do you think about freckles I did didn't I and she goes in her Southern Tennessee accent I love freckles praise the Lord let's get Let's Get Married let's do this thing it's a real confirmation for me God made us the way that we are and God gave me all I mean when I was uh 14 I begged my dad for some cream to get rid of my freckles I hated them and he bought this expensive cream I talked him into it and I put it on and over night I woke up the next morning this going to be yet I woke up the next morning I had more freckles than what I had the night before so I didn't know the purpose in my freckles but then I married a wife who likes freckles that's why I have them I'm beautiful fearfully and wonderfully made how do you follow that I don't feel like I would follow much I just want to say um I appreciate each and every one of your testimonies and I appreciate everything that all of youall do um I just want to thank the Lord uh for answering my prayer um I've always been a very fearful uh neurotic person um it's just part of my nature but um uh what what I've been looking for from this uh not just in this camp but over the past few months is confidence I'm at a point in my life where I'm making some pretty big decisions with career-wise and where I'm going to live and other things and um I've been praying for confidence but uh the the last sermon of brother Samuel and then brother Jack kind of Hit the the nail in confidence is great but I believe courage is more important and by God's grace um I think he's given me courage to push forward even when I'm not confident in what I'm doing and um I'm just very grateful and I I hope he'll fill each and every one of you with courage as well amen yeah Lord bless you all be strong and courageous be strong love you all right one more okay just a quick announcement if you go back make sure everything is out of your room we

just took over and it wasn't even me like I didn't do anything I was just the vessel and when I went back and sat down it was just so strong it felt like there was just a cloud over me and like it was just raining on me and it was so powerful and it still feels like that I hasn't even left for days and every time I think about it I just want to lay on the floor and just like God I can't believe you
