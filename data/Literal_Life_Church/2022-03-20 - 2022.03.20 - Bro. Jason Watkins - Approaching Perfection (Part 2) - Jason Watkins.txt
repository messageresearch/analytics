========================================

want to continue on this morning i've been able to shake a few more hands this morning and see a few more friendly faces and passed a young man in the back as just as we were coming and just as i glanced at him what was going on oh i know that guy and i turned around as luke caught him in the back back there so we're happy to have him and all the different ones and brother john my very good friend here from phoenix and uh he's a airline captain for southwest and he got trapped in detroit i say yeah the lord has a way to ground an airplane put him here on the front row this morning amen praise the lord so they were checking you out on video brother john so they weren't sure who you were i think they were going to take you down maybe and so i said wait that's my good friend that's brother john amen so we're happy in the lord and the different ones of you so many wonderful faces i understand i got brother george buckman was telling me last night that some of his kin are here and uh but we're all ken folk aren't we amen one common father above all through all and in you all so i sure counted a privilege to be here i'm looking forward to tonight to uh hear brother diggs now that's what y'all call him i was telling the ministers at the meeting saturday we don't call him that at bethel tabernacle we call him the weapon amen lethal weapon amen the devil has taken such a beating over the years that we just even on our church calendar when he's scheduled it just says the weapon and everybody knows who everybody knows who that is but the dick's coming people get excited amen the devil gets trembly amen praise the lord so we sure have enjoyed brother diggs over the years and known him for a long time and he's like family to us at bethel tabernacle like one of us amen praise the lord ephesians chapter 3 i could stand here there's a lot more i could say in greeting but amen um my table is full this morning and i wanna i want you to at least get a sampling of all of it amen so ephesians three uh we'll begin verses three to ten i traveling light i didn't bring my bible i just brought my ipad and i thought wow i hope somebody wouldn't get offended if i don't carry a bible for it so last night i said hey brother brandon get me a bible he said well brother paul's got a stack of old bibles here i said perfect get me one with the most anointing on it and and that way i'll have it close to me amen and so that's what was happening last night i had this bible sitting there amen so ephesians chapter 3 verses 3 through 10. how let's start start at verse 1. i said verse 31 let's just go one through 10 ephesians 3 1 through 10. for this cause i paul the prisoner of jesus christ you gentiles if you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of god which has given me to you word how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery as i wrote it for in a few words whereby when you read ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit that the gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel whereof i was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of god given unto me by the effectual working of his power unto me who am less than the least of all saints in is this grace given that i should preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ and to make watch this ninth verse and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery all right so this is not just some dark saying this is not some ancient spell this is not some you know some mystical mysterious thing this mystery wants to have fellowship with you all right which from the beginning of the world hath been hidden god who created all things by jesus christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of god father we surrender ourselves afresh to you this morning and i i can hardly read the text lord without feeling the anointing falling upon me so lord there's so much to say i probably can't get to it all and we don't want to weary the people so i just pray for your wisdom that you would move me along at your pace i'm surrendered to you now not here for my own thinking lord i'm here just as your assistant we commit it to you in jesus name amen god bless you as you're seated so paul is bringing a tremendous thought here that at first blush you can you can miss a lot about what he's trying to get the church to comprehend and he starts talking about how that things that in other ages were not made known to the sons of man so it when you think of it in that connotation then you think oh there must have there must have been some you know some type of secret code some hidden mystery some teaching some doctrine something that was missed but but really that that kind of overshoots what paul kind of misses the mark of of what he's really trying to get their thinking he's trying to get their thinking lined up because he's trying to bring uh trying to bring them an understanding of their position in christ jesus and so it's very much like when you read in the old testament how that you and i know we've read it since the days of being children in sunday school how that god you know made himself known to abraham and abraham even when he's taking isaac for the sacrifice you're familiar amen behold father here's the here's the wood here's the fire where's the lamb and abraham says those wonderful words the lord shall provide see and we say jehovah jireh the lord shall provide himself a sacrifice and so we find and much could be said there i cannot get sidetracked today i must be studious so just keep keep me in prayer so so so but but then now oddly enough if you go on over into the exodus then god is beginning to talk to the israelites in their journey and talk to moses and he's going to make a strange statement that seems like that's that's that's inconsistent with what i know to be in the scripture uh but of course we know that there's nothing inconsistent in god so the inconsistencies in your understanding and he says to them he says now by my name jehovah i was not known speaking back about abraham's day by my name jehovah they didn't know me like that see you think wait a minute but abraham said he's jehovah jireh and so how how is he not making himself known but you're now you're beginning to get paul's angle it's it's it's like when peter talks about how that today he says we have a more sure word of prophecy now he wasn't meaning that that it's all about you know we understand it doctrinally better than the old testament saints what he's saying is that now what they held in prophecy we're the materialization of we're those words in flesh we are we are now the living prophecy that they only knew is a prophecy but now it's a more sure word to us because we're it and so when he's when he's dealing with he's saying you know by my name jehovah because remember that that abraham calling him lord and brother branham would repeat constantly capital l capital o capital r capital d it's it's elohim but remember that elohim is the self-existing one whereas jehovah is that same being not a different one but he's moving forward in his unfolding and his unfolding is in manifestation and so now he's got a family which now is is closer to the meaning of jehovah god living with his family god with the family so so now he's simply saying it's not that abraham didn't understand jehovah jireh he called me that but but but i wasn't known like that i because i only had abraham and and i only had isaac but my but my but i but in my vision i see a whole family more than the stars of heaven and the sands of the sea and by the time they're walking through the wilderness two and a half million people now god is more like jehovah because now he's got a family [Applause] so now you're i'm trying to get your mind going in the same direction you understand so this is unfolding all right so so we realize then that paul now is coming to the church in ephesus and remember that everything he's trying to teach them this is what we are to achieve that that church got relaxed ephesus and fell away and therefore there was no way for christ to come and take a bride in a rapture all the apostles were aiming at that and they were preaching at that but the church began to be infiltrated by make believers and unbelievers and and you've got the apostles writing letters and saying you need to earnestly contend for the faith once delivered to the saints you know and you've got john writing about gnosticism it's encroaching effect on the church and said anybody who won't say that jesus christ has come in the flesh because gnostics didn't believe that because they didn't want to believe that because if they if they admitted he was a man then that put that put a responsibility on them to live a holy life because they were men and they didn't want to live a holy life so they wanted to make him a spirit or an angel or a phantom or something there's no way a human could live like that but a human can live like that as long as that same spirit that was in him is dwelling in you amen all right so i'm just just trying to build in lay foundation get us all on the same on the same direction so so we find then that that that church fell away and so rather than christ being able to come and take a bride in the rapture as everything in the letters of the apostles was aiming at then what happens we see christ has to sit back down in the eternities he has to intercede for the ignorance down through 2000 years he seals up the word under seven seals but he promises at the end time he'll break that seal and unveil christ again and there'll be an omega bride who's predestinated not to fall like that and this omega bride will be restored back to where the alpha church climax and begin to descend and we'll pick up at that climax and take it on to a body change so you're living in unprecedented times you're it is upon you what's going to happen to you and i has never happened there's never been a global many-membered bride taken in a body change and all the saints down through all the new testament era will be raised and we which are alive and remain shall be changed and the procession shall go by and every age jumping in and brother branham said as they go by then we'll fall in line and we'll go marching off to meet him in the air hallelujah that's an hour see your future is bright friends don't worry about what the devil's up to he ain't nobody you don't live by his mercies he don't have any say over your life your your whole life is in the hands of god and your future is bright god's whole purpose is to get you marching in the step of the gospel according to the vision wow all right so so now we see that this is why paul would would say there's a fellowship with this mystery in other words there's going to be a further unfolding that's going to unfold not in extra teaching not that that there's something in william branham's message that's beyond saint paul there's nothing william branham taught that's not what paul taught it's not everything he taught was established because you can't add to paul's revelation but there is a a greater fulfillment in the people in the bride because we're going in a body change so so we find then that that that's what the message of the hour restores us back to because that word is is effective to do it and we're predestinated not to repeat what happened to eve what happened to the jewish the hebrew church what happened to the christian church they all every time christ got ready every time god got ready found them polluted but this bride is predestinated to not fall so so so then we find that god now and then this and now i'm going to have to now turn it turn a quick corner and there's probably going to be more than four corners so just let me keep turning corners it might be a multi-sided building here so so we find then that now that you're understanding the development that it's continued manifestation it just keeps unfolding and and every time here's a here's an important point every time something more of god is known it's known by an unfolding in the people and every time there's an unfolding in the people it's it always verifies that every unfolding before it was also god because he's the same yesterday today and forever he's of old up from everlasting and so that's the old testament way of saying yesterday and forever from old from everlasting and it meant that every time that that's how you know it's the word because it unfolds more of christ and it and it and it and it's a natural continuation it it's not uh it's not something that would contradict a previous unfolding see it's all continuous and and and it's it's really more than contiguous it it actually overlaps it it moves and blends and and and every time it gets the focus gets more and more and more until finally you're coming now to the last day and we're going to see a bride under a capstone ministry say how far is it going to go into his very image that's the prophecy pick up your pen and write that's what he he wrote this bride will be in his very image so she's coming all the way to a body change all right now i got to keep moving so so now that you understand that's how it's unfolding that's how it's going that's what fellowship with the mystery means that it's christ in you becoming you as i said last night looking where the i am is it was in moses it was in david it was in john it was in jesus it was in the apostles and it's in you and i see so and it always bears the same nature always has the same characteristics now brother brennan makes an interesting statement and sirs we would see jesus now what he's about to say is certainly uh uh you know not inconsistent with the scripture i'll prove to you just in a second brother branham says sirs we would see jesus as our scientists tell us it's long ago three minutes until midnight now watch this it took a prophet to say this i'd never had the courage to say it but took a prophet to say it but we know the hand of god has stopped time to wait just long-suffering like he was in the days of noah now you're already going to have to abandon the classical model of time i'm just going to tell you right now because god measures existence according to prophecy not chronology not this this thing doesn't govern god understand this governs his actions this is happening in this but this doesn't control this it's the other way around and god has got his hand on the governor and he's manually controlling how fast things speed up how much they slow down how fast they speed up how much they slow down see now you can see that friends in the scripture and i'm not going to have you turn because it would really get bogged down take way too much time but it's familiar to us when we go into uh revelation seven and we we find that you've got you know you're gonna have the 144 thousand spoken of there and brother branham says perfectly an interval of time to deal with with catching the the 144 000 brother branham says it fits perfectly between revelation 6 and revelation 8 which is the coming of the lord and and it's it's a little interval of time to get israel under the trumpets but it's also an interval of time between not only the sixth and seventh trumpet but in an interval between the sixth and seventh seal because it's also gotta come down and drop a prophet into the earth and call a bride out and no one knows she's the bride they think she's a cult and they don't realize she's becoming into fellowship with the mystery and then he takes her off the earth not in a global event covered by satellite a secret rapture see and it's just a little interval of time this is why brother branham that's why brother branham would say the church goes up in revelation 3 and she's not seen again until revelation 19. and brother branham said oh everything else is is concerning israel you say well how does that what does that look like how does that even work but it actually fits perfectly because because god god is once the bride goes up in a rapture in in time then god turns to the jews the eagle anointing simply lifts up flies east picks up moses and elijah and goes to the 144 000 and they get born again by the holy ghost by believing the same message you believe this is why when you see them in revelation 15 standing with the unwise virgin they're both standing there one has the song of moses one has the song of the lamb but only the 144 thousand go into the millennium and the and the unwise virgin don't they don't they're not getting the millennium why because they're not born again you understand now they have salvation from destruction not in the ra not in the tribulation but they went into the tribulation already saved from destruction because they have a faith in the death burial and resurrection of jesus christ and they're holy people they're not this fakery this artificial christianity today that's that's garbage and nonsense but they're holy people righteous people they're called saints saints mean sanctified ones and the king will say unto the righteous and the righteous will say unto the king matthew 25. so we find that day that brother ram says they have a seed they just never get the moisture they never their seed is never germatized see because because why they rejected the message of the hour and that's how you get germatized by a personal revelation of christ to you and you believe it and then god performs it in your life [Applause] no wonder i can't miss the rapture i couldn't prevent my new birth i won't prevent my body change hallelujah i was running all over the world but when the time met prophecy god caught me and i'm here to tell you i got all kinds of ups and downs and ins and outs and weaknesses just like you but on that morning the trumpet of god will sound and i will know him as i'm known so we find that when revelation 7 opens you have the four angels standing on the four winds and there it's it's over we're done it's time for tribulation and the first woe second third woe are gonna sweep the earth clean of humanity and they would have actually all they would have went continuously but but but but an angel rose out of the east with the seal of the living god of course it shows it's a portrait of christ in bible imagery because only christ has the seal of the living god he's the only one who can seal you and not only that he's the only one who can serve an injunction on his own on his own word he's the only one who can stop time see and so he rises up they've already got a commission to destroy the earth first of all second world third world he says hold it stop wait hold up there's other words i've got to fulfill first i've got people down there and i got to get them sealed in hallelujah hallelujah and that's why well and that's why when the first woe it brings on world war one then he comes there to stop it because what does he do he stops time he can't let it run to armageddon yet because at this time this under the fifth trumpet a prophet isn't even born yet to redeem a gentile brag so he's he's got to stop time not stop this kind of time but he freezes this kind of time makes sense so that's exactly what he's doing and that's why they don't know to this day who stopped world war one see but but we know that god stopped it now malachi 4 is identical to that behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord see but so now the prophecy is the great and dreadful day of the lord and it's coming once it gets going there's going to be no stopping it however there's a little interval of time when when i'm going to send elijah down and call a bride out and and and grab a quick bride and just do a short quick power forward take her off the earth and then the great and dreadful day of the lord will have its play and it'll it'll go out into the end of the tribulation so so we see then that's that's what you know that's what seventh-day adventists are missing that's what the the people who who try to say that you know revelation 10 is to israel they they're missing the secret of the interval because they say well revelation 4 all the way from there on is israel and it is israel but you have to understand that that this interval of time god is coming down to take a bride home and and that's why when when revelation 4 opens she's called up higher she's a door which is christ a revelation further is now open and that's why brother branham talks about revelation 5 and 4 by connection because they're the exact same event that that brother brown said he's showing in revelation 5 how he pulled it off how did he get her in those first three chapters how did he take her in the rapture this is how he done it and he goes into revelation five and brother adam goes to boaz and ruth and and again i can't get sidetracked but but we find then that that that's why when we come to revelation 7 there's another pause and then and then god's got to bring elijah and then we we find the coming of the lord and the coming of the lord under the opening of the seals and now prophets on the scene and now you've got a a mighty angel who's showing up visible hallelujah and he's got every in in all the bible imagery of revelation 10 1 it's literally the bible imagery of christ in his bride christ in his body and it's not the first time that's happened brother branham said the very one in the walking in the seven lamp stands was actually christ but in the form of his body in the form of his bride hallelujah that's why brother branham would call it a bride coming of christ see jesus doesn't come to this earth his feet don't touch this earth until after until revelation 19. we meet him in the air for a rapture so how is he descended into the earth and still he's in heaven because he's in you it's now an unfolding there's a people and a fellowship of the mystery and she is the blood of god by the spirit and you are the continuation of that same creation so malachi 4 is that if you look at it from the hebrew it's an injunction he's saying i'm going to destroy it all however i'm going to i'm going to serve upon myself a temporary injunction and i'm going to first send elijah before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and once he's gone and the bride is out of the way have at it then the word is going to roll and steamroll the whole world they can't stop it because it's the word of prophecy all right now so brother branham now here's another example that brother branham uses in god's stopping time to wait all right just like in the long suffering days of noah just like when you when god told uh moses it'll be 400 years i told abraham it'll be 400 years but we find out that paul when he records the chronicling of it paul says it was 430 years why because it's it's god moving at the pace of prophecy not moving at this he's moving at this this is you take comfort in that because that means that everything you see happening in the world is is under perfect control it's happening what's supposed to be happening there's no need for us to be fearful you don't have to be afraid of anything all we have to do is have the wisdom of the mind of christ to know how to go forward see so brother branham now here's another example brother branham it's very familiar to you look away to jesus now you might see some little odd things happening for me nothing sinful i don't mean that but i mean something odd to what the regular trend so in other words you're going to have to lose your classical model you're not going to be able to think of it normally see because this is something this is an eternal purpose working and those kind of things crop up all the time god does things in mysterious ways that defy the classical model and when people try to look at god in that way of human intelligence and intellect and to in intuition they end up that he's three or two or one only or they end up that that he contradicts and they they say the bible contradicts itself that's because they're looking at it through human intellectualism but god is mysterious you can't always look at him in that classical way you've got to have faith you've got to believe he that cometh to god must first believe that he is see so brother branham says he says not it's just it's going to be odd to what the regular trend because where i've where i reach to now in the ministry i'm dropping back here now he's not telling yet why he's just he's just bringing you up to speed to say i've got to drop back because of where i've arrived at now what does that even mean brother brown all right sit still he says he says because where i've reached to now in the ministry i'm dropping back here watching that spot and waiting for the time to use it he's referencing the third pool but it's going to be used he says now i must lay quietly for a little while just a little while now remember and who is listening to this tape you might see such a strange such a change in my ministry right away dropping back not going forward no i mean sorry not going up dropping back here now he's going to give the rhyming reason to it all we're right at the age now and it can't be can't go any further see now you're just like in revelation 7 because the three woes were to sweep the earth clean of humanity and allow him to annihilate god pulls all the chucks out of the wheels and the wagon rolls off the cliff and and god's not going to destroy the world mankind god's just going to take you out of the way you're preventing it and as soon as he takes you out of the way he that letteth will let till he christ in the bride be taken out of the way and then then it rolls off the cliff and so man's going to destroy himself see so god doesn't have to destroy anything he's going to let man do it to himself and so he says dropping back not going up dropping back we're right at the age now it can't be can't go any further we have to wait just a minute until this happens over here to catch up then the time comes but it's thoroughly identified so now he's talking about time as it relates to prophecy so in other words revelation 7 was ready to go but wait hold on i got to first seal the servants because i got another prophecy back here that says i'll have servants and i got to get them sealed so now when we come over here and it starts unfolding in real time an angel descends out of the east having the sealed living god and says wait time time out now the clock kept going this kept going but a war stopped and political geopolitical things began to move in the earth and we found out that what god is doing and they think it's this nation and that nation and you know they gotta you know austrian amen gets assassinated and we're gonna go to war and it becomes a global affair because now it's not just nation rising against nation you'll have that jesus said wars and rumors of wars you'll have that the end's not yet this now is beginning to be the first time that it's world war ii that it's whole nations against whole nations see so it's it's beginning to be now you're starting to see unprecedented time unprecedented things strike the earth that's never been in existence and so what's controlling it prophecy so now the seventh seal is open the third pole has made itself manifest the spoken word and squirrels have been created a storm has been rebuked the tumor's been rebuked young boys have been brought to the holy ghost all by the power that operated out of a man's mouth just spoke and it happened now you're back to genesis this is why we were saying last night it's redemption is all about restoring genesis hallelujah where god and man had an unfettered unbroken relationship to where adam was perfectly unconscious he just operated nature because he was the god of the earth oh friends your future is bright hallelujah this thing isn't accidental this thing has been precisionly planned and god has moved each step starting stopping pausing speeding up slowing down to do what now he lets man the best laid plans of mice and men it just comes to nothing only what god does stands and that's why his believers all the way from genesis have abandoned keeping up with the world they only want to know oh i want to know him more so so now he's he's been god has been governing time at the pace of prophecy he's been doing that all along since the dawn of time he's always done that all right now you can see that's god slowing it down and stopping it you can also see him hit the hit the throttle you see him hit the gas and accelerated because that's what you see happening under the fifth trumpet because what happens on the fifth trumpet is a star falls from heaven and comes down to the earth and he's got a special key to the bottomless pit and he's going to open up a prison where where these scorpion-like creatures with teeth and hair like women and stings in their tail and their and they're spiritual now they're going to be released into the earth and it's and brother branham takes that star in in in the book of revelation and he he in revelation 9 under the fifth trumpet and ties it back to isaiah 14 how art thou fallen from heaven oh lucifer son of the morning so brother branham connects the two dots and so now we see that satan now because now you're getting global war now things are starting to heat up now we're coming into the 20th century it's getting time that you're coming up now the seventh age is just on the horizon hallelujah and god is moving god's moving all over the earth and they think it's politics nothing doing it's prophecy and so now satan is given a key to open a pit to release spirits he's in other words i'm going to give you a little temporary i'm going to give you a little extra juice lucifer go down here's some keys it's never been opened the world don't know what's coming but i need to bring it's got to go beyond nation rising against nation i got to bring a global affair i got to get the first woe second low third one i got to get this first wall started so here's some keys go down and open the pit and when he does and brother branham says here come these scorpions with stings in their tail these creatures that came out of the and they've got a king over them which is abaddon or a polygon and it's lucifer from isaiah 14. and and brother branham says he's it makes an interesting statement he says they've got hair like a woman to torment the women who cut theirs off now now now overlay these over late because where we are is we've come into the 20th century and now the first woe is about to break and and a first world war is going to start up and you know 14 15 years in it's going to start happening and they're going to assassinate a an austrian monarch and then the whole world and then this treaty and that treaty the whole thing is going to take off and now it's global war and so so when brother branham makes that statement you're understanding that it's right at the the first decade of the new century now if you go back historically the hair bob began in 1912. that's where historians tag it they say right there that that hollywood began with their with their picture shows they began to bob their hair their speakeasies right in 1912. now that's just uh that's just 30 24 to 36 months before the first woe gets underway world war one actually the one the the war the world wars aren't always correlated directly to the woes because the wall caused world war one just like the second will cause world war ii but world war ii ended in 1945 but the second woe doesn't until in the tribulation in revelation 12. see say how does that work well it's not hard because the the sons the the same men that were fighting in iwo jima in the late 1945 were fighting a few years later in korea and then their sons were fighting in vietnam and then their sons were in the gulf war and then their sons are in afghanistan and the world has never known peace why because it's still the effects and that's why in revelation 12 after they killed moses and elijah and the 144 000 are all martyred the bible says that ends the second woe and the third woe cometh quickly oh my god's wrapping it up at that time you're still with me i'm trying to make it as clear as i can so you don't get lost in the shuffle and so so you find then that that harry here he comes and he's he's now he's going to hit the accelerator right satan take off down there and and he's going to release these creatures with hair like women to torment the women who cut theirs off in 1912 say how's he going to torment him in 1912 he don't he's not going to be in 1912 it's going to be a few years later when the first world war breaks out and you're going to have mothers and wives losing husbands and sons in a global war women all over the world are going to be tormented because they're losing their husbands they're losing their sons and whole generations are being wiped out it's god tormenting them because they cut their hair these things aren't accidents friends this stuff stacks up perfectly and beautifully we wouldn't know any of this if it wasn't for the message of the hour we'd be we'd be just as turned around as seventh-day adventists we wouldn't even understand what god is doing in the interval of time but i'm glad that our eyes see blessed are your eyes for they see it in your ears for they hear it hallelujah so now in that case god is hitting the accelerators bringing it on so this is why you know when when when when we look at what's happening i just said to my church recently you know you see what's happening in ukraine and i can tell you there's never been a time it's unprecedented and unparalleled the cooperation of western powers say oh well we've had it before not to this level every you read headlines causely men with with who who study that know that they're shocked and they're stunned and you know what's happening you know what vladimir is finding out putin you know he's finding out you can't fight the beast because the book of revelation prophecy doesn't matter what's happening here prophecy has already said that the beast brings the king of the north to heal the beast brings the whole world china's going to figure that out north korea is going to find that out radical islam is going to find that out you can't fight the beast who's already in control you know what's happening you know what russia's happening having happened right now that's going to come into full force when the bride is gone is you can't buy or sell except you're part of our program and we're just going to shut you down globally and financially because the the beast power rules by commerce hallelujah these things aren't an accident i don't know what's going to happen here in ukraine i don't know how that i've got no prophecy i've got no quotes to tell me what's going to happen in ukraine but i can tell you here what's happening is the world is plunging into a tribulation and the beast is gaining power and flexing its muscles that it's had for years only no one knew it was to that level oh precious friends think of the hour that you have arrived at you are the last generation you're the one upon whom the ends of the world have come see it's not going to matter what a what outcome happens in ukraine russia's learning a secret see and so now all right can i turn another corner i've only been 44 minutes you still with me all right if i see you blinking and starting to sway i'll have to stop so stay with me amen if you need to get awake and everybody is but if you find yourself sleeping get up and jump up down we'll think the spirit hits you and and people will rejoice amen so paul comes to the hebrew church to his own countrymen hebrews 6 and in through seven wearing god willing more bundling to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for god to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast which entereth in into that within the veil whither the forerunner christ is entered for us even jesus made a high priest forever after the order of melchizedek he goes on into chapter seven it was chapters and verses were added hundreds of years later it's just a letter he's writing for this melchizedek king of salem priest of the most high god who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him to whom also abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of salem which is king of peace without father without mother without dissent having neither beginning of days nor ending of life but made like unto the son of god abideth the priest continually now it's interesting because paul had had had broken down to them uh in the in the chapter just prior in hebrews 5 paul had began to break down to them how that god was willing had been willing to lower himself down to become a temptable man so that god could feel what we feel so that he knows the struggles you have so that he can be a faithful high priest see and paul is trying to get them to understand that he he knows what you're going through he know i'm glad i'm glad he knows what i'm going through i'm glad he knows my frustrations amen at least half of which i probably brought on myself amen see but he knows see he's here to help me not destroy me i i love that that just rings through my soul you know just receive that today i don't know what your life is going through right now but i didn't promise you this he's here to help you he's not here to destroy you doesn't matter how sometimes the preaching can get really tight really hard and you can just really get rolled over by it but just believe this he's here to help you he's not here to harm you satan satan does does that to get you to feel like giving up that's why he does it he's a master at it he's a master psychologist so this is why our faith is in is in the word of god we can because we can see him in prophecy now i'm moving as rapidly as i can so brother branham comes now and he's going to he's going to bring us here about who is melchizedek because paul had said in the fifth chapter after he's trying to get him to understand their position in christ and he said look this whole thing about melchizedek man i've got a lot to tell you but wow are you ever dull of hearing and i i can't really bring it to you like because you're already starting to drift you're already starting to fall away and and and paul is trying to get him to say do you understand and he's going to go into chapter 6 and chapter 7 do you understand how great this man was see so brother branham says here people say it was a priesthood that was a melchizedek priesthood he says that's the most likely they hold better to that side than they do the other because they say it was a priesthood brother iran says but it can't be that in other words just merely that for in the fourth verse it says he was a person he was a man see so in order to be a person he has to be a personality a man not a order but a person so he was not just a priesthood order neither was he a myth he was a person and now watch and the person is eternal and if you notice he had no father no mother no time he ever began no time he ever ended and i love this statement remember who he was he's still alive [Music] argue about are you all you want whoever he was he's still alive see see because the because he had no father mother beginning of day's ending of life so it would it would have to be an eternal person and so he says an eternal person see so it could only be one person that's god he's the only one that's eternal now watch him begin to break it down see i contend that he was god because he's the only person that can be immortal and now here's what's happening here's here's what paul was wearing over that that church was dull and couldn't quite grasp and you say how do you know what paul was weird over because i've got a prophet preaching the back half of it i've got a prophet in this message showing me what that age who fell away couldn't receive and didn't receive but we're receiving it see and he says he had to be immortal god changing himself into a person that's what he was no father mother beginning life reading of days the whole bible is the revelation of god the whole church is built upon the revelation of god there's no other way to know god only by revelation whom the son will reveal him see revelation is everything see and and but now remember revelation is not just the accumula accumulation of knowledge revelation is is faith that when god reveals himself to you you then surrender a part of you so that you can absorb that part of him and and you become him he became you so that you can become him now it's a revelation because it's a manifestation see now watch the opposite of it see the whole church is built upon it there's no other way to know god see watch to not accept the revelation then you're just a cold theologian and there's no hope for you see he's talking he's he's giving a testimony he's speak speaking to a minister who's trying to contend with him and he says but it's revelation the man says brother brother my brother branham i can't accept revelation he says then you cut yourself off from god there's no way how's god going to get to you if you don't accept that see the man is still thinking in the classical model he's still thinking about you know xyz and one two three he's still thinking of it in human terms and brother branham is in a completely different hemisphere going look it becomes a life a revelation is a living thing and it's that's why it changes your life into the image of god see that's that's the sign that you've been redeemed and born again your seed has been germanized because you start looking and acting like him see so he says if you don't receive that if you in other words if you don't receive the engrafted word if you don't let it become a part of your life then there's no hope for you you're just a cold theologian and he would probably be a better theologian than william brown but but they're going to have different destinies see so i thought there's nothing sadder than that you know it's one thing to have a doctor tell you you've got a disease and you're dying and there's no hope but my goodness to have a prophet tell you there's no hope for you see and so it was sad in brother branham's heart he wasn't trying to make the man feel bad you know it's just a true principle and an application and and that's why you can't become as i as i was saying last night and i say so again today you can't become satisfied by merely merely being by being filled with knowledge don't ever be satisfied because when you do that listen first of all the more knowledge you accrue the more culpable you become the more guilty you become the less chance you'll have at the throne at god's throne because to whom much is given much is required see so you never if you all you do is be filled with knowledge and you never come to life changing power that's why brother branham said satan don't really care how right you are in your doctrine that's really mattered him because he's got a military secret he's got a war secret that and a prophet told us devil got really mad he didn't want a prophet to tell you his secret but his secret the william branham discerned the heart of lucifer just like isaiah did and said isaiah said lucifer i know you you said in your heart i'll ascend mm-hmm and lucifer's like stop don't tell people that tell them i'm going to write it a book man i'll send it to the whole world this is exactly what you did and william branham comes along in this day and puts it on tape sends it around the world and now it's in the digital now it's in the stratosphere the satan will never be able to get it offline now that here's the secret satan don't care how religious you are he don't care how right you are in your doctrine he don't even care about that because what he knows is is if you miss the life you won't come up anyway see so when you refuse to allow the spirit to reveal himself further to you not knowledge but but but brother adam said you empty out and christ comes in the more you empty out the more he'll come in and fill up that place that's my goal that's why i live oh i want to know you more and the only way you can know him more is to is to get make less of you so you can have more of him see so you never when you don't do that you don't allow the spirit to reveal himself to you in that way you never become different you only become more religious you never really get more spiritual you're because you're you're never able to see now i'm coming to another corner you're never able to see your life that you're living here in real time you're never able to see your life blended into the mystery of god see that this is not just about doctrine that this is an unfolding this is an eternal being who expressed a family and put seed in his whole family so that he could redeem that seed all down through time and that's why you believe it because the seed gene inside of you is the exact same substance as this now it's not ink on paper it's a spiritual gene inside you but this ink on paper doesn't do you any good unless it gets inside and becomes a living book he's not coming to rapture your bible brother branham said when the books are closed for the last time the word will be flesh this is the third iteration of the bible the first one was in the stars the second one was enoch's pyramid this is the third one there's another one coming hallelujah it's in a body it's in a people who become the capstone they become the manifested word of the hour they come into his very image see so you're never able to see that your life really is here for that purpose it's to be blended in it's to begin to cooperate in a vision that god had of you long before you ever breathed there in the earth it's a mystery of god that is unfolding in your day and you're part of it now this is entanglement this is what i made mention of last night and i'm not going to go into it because science today there the more i study it the more disgusting it becomes because i see now why the bible says in their wisdom they became fools and they they they think they understand quantum mechanics although they're just as confused as anything and you try to follow their teaching and you'll see they're confused and they admit they're confused over it and even einstein missed it a million miles even albert einstein completely wrong and and and and you know you know you know you know how i understand quantum entanglement because i have a hillbilly prophet who put it in his language i have a bible that it's it speaks of it in the scripture i'm going to show you here just in a minute so so so when you find an entanglement at the quantum level you know there were three there were three and now it's like i say i'm not going to go into this deeply it's a fascinating subject i love studying physics but but there were three major advancements in physics in the 20th century of course one was you'd know as relativity einstein's special theory of relativity the second one was quantum mechanics and the third one was chaos theory and so we find that in the in the quan in the area of physics that we call quantum mechanics they talk about quantum entanglement where you have you know objects that are you you you take you take two objects at the quantum level and you and you entangle them and then they they actually share a new condition they become something different they be they share a new condition or state and and here now it was actually einstein that proved that's true but here's here was the whole conundrum of why they argued for decades and and albert einstein and his team he had two other scientists and then you had niels bohr who come on the scene and he was the counter to it ends up neal turned out to be right nils turned out to be right einstein turned out to be wrong and uh they didn't really couldn't prove that to 1964. i don't want to go let me let me just stop right there before i get into that but but but so we find that that they they found that they could take these two objects that were now entangled and they could they could see that when they were taken apart and you could actually send them in opposite directions for hundreds of light years that way and hundreds of light years that way and they were hundreds of light years apart and yet as soon as you observe one then then the then the superposition of the other snaps into place to match that one if this one is pointed up this one points down whatever this one does it's it's a it's it's a corresponding so whatever this one does there's a reaction in this one and and it doesn't happen over time it's instant it's instant as soon as as soon as this one moves this one moves i mean if i take my hand and i have the top and the bottom and i and i just do them like that now the bottom's on the on the top and the top is on the bottom but i've only got one hand i understand so so this is what blew einstein's mind and he he couldn't figure out how does the signal get from that one hundreds of light years and and einstein said it can't be instantaneous because that would mean that there's some and einstein called it a hidden force and he called it spooky action at a distance because he couldn't understand how does it instantly do that and they're hundreds and hundreds of light years apart and and and neil niels bohr would say albert you're just wrong you're just wrong that that it's not there's nothing spooky about it it's not it's not spooky action at a distance and there is no hidden force that what you're not realizing is they're the same thing now that blew out einstein's mind and why wouldn't it why wouldn't it because you've got two objects and you send them in opposite directions hundreds of light years away and einstein knew there's no way that that can be instant because his theory of relativity proved nothing can travel faster than the speed of light oh my but there's coming a world where the speed of light will be the slow lane speed of thought is infinitely faster than the speed of light because it doesn't matter it can take me 30 seconds to walk to that door but then it would take me probably three or four times that to walk to the road and it would take me months to walk to walk home but but it but but on that other side time and distance are a moot point it doesn't matter if it's 5 feet or 5 million feet or 5 million light years of miles i'm there instantly all i do is think of it so i had time you can't look at it in the classical model and that's what einstein couldn't get his mind around and and boers would say there's no hidden action he said they only look like two separate things but they're he said well how are they not two separate things because they're entangled and this is this is what blows physicists mind well what does that even mean they're entangled and and he said albert there's no hidden force it's not anything happening at a distance that you're the problem you're having is you're looking at it as two separate things but once they're entangled at a quantum level they're no longer two they're one see so it didn't matter that god the father lived in the son and they were the same person and whatever the father did the son did likewise hallelujah they said it's two no it's not two say but he was a man sure he was a man but he was also god that's a paradox it's entanglement see and and einstein would he said he would say but they'd have these funny public debates and he'd say no he says god doesn't play with dice like that and and boer would reply through the media said somebody tell albert he needs to stop telling god what to do [Applause] because once they're entangled and now they're realizing only just now they're realizing that maybe they've misunderstood space entirely that maybe they don't understand space like they think they do see now i begin to they they they're beginning to understand that space might be this whole singular thing and that and that all nature might actually just be one singular thing all the way through the galaxies and all the way through the through the through the through the many multi multiverses and and and and they're they're going pow pow pow pow pow pow pow and i'm just opening a book and the prophet says all nature runs in perfect continuity i'm thinking boy you idiots you don't understand nothing why do you think all nature runs in con but brother branham would say he all nature brother branham would say of god he fills all time space and eternity and then he'll come over here and go but now he's not like the wind he's a being he lives in a house well how do i i mean but wait you how do you i mean if he feels all time but but he's not like the wind because it's expression it's the same god in the beginning was the word it actually was with him and it was him and and and that's why the the bible talks about the elected son being christ say well how did you get elected because i was in christ i said when did you get in him before the time before the world before anything before stardust i existed in god and that's why i'm a believer today because i mean i i bet you know the best way to get elements entangled is start them at the same time create them at the same time and when that logos came out of god you were in him when that logos came out of god i was in him all it had to do was go over time and overlay that with prophecy and it just walked down through the ages and brother branham said all the lives of all the people and all the bible is one goal one goal god with a family that he has expressed into the earth exactly that that's why when you go to ezekiel and you see his very first vision 30 years in and he sees a wheel in the middle of a wheel and he sees living creatures and they're all they're four but they're all one and they don't never turn they just always move forward they're always moving forward it doesn't matter they're always looking forward and when the when the wheels moved the creatures moved when the wheels lifted the creatures lifted that was entanglement it's right in the bible and science is blind to it that's why we're believers because we've been entangled with the mind of god so it doesn't matter that he's in heaven and that i'm in earth when god moves i move when god wills i will i as the father does so does the child this is what the holy ghost does it brings to life that gene of god inside you and that's the same life that was in the logos of god hallelujah you can't help but be a believer you can't help but forsake the world because that's your dna as brother diggs was saying that's the nature of what god put in you [Applause] see and so so they they didn't they couldn't even prove that they thought who is right for years is it einstein or is it bore is it is it according to einstein that well it's just already fixed that way or as boer would say does it snap into superposition as soon as you observe this one and they proved it was that because see when god is observed when god reveals himself to observation his bride his counterpart snaps into position and whatever he does she immediately snaps into position and wherever he goes she's immediately responding and it doesn't take her she doesn't have to go pray about it she doesn't have to fast 40 days for it it's something that happens it's a life inside her she can't help herself it moves her forward hallelujah and so so and then they they couldn't prove that until 1964. right at the time and brother branham is bringing shalom and brother branham now he comes to another thing and he starts talking about this symphony he's talking about a composer a conductor and you know you've got players who are we're the instruments we're playing the sheet music and god sent a conductor who was locked in with the composer who knew how the composer wanted it played and the composer and the conductor and the musicians and it's harmony and brother branham brother brennan would actually use this kind of language he would say music can be such that he said it can get so beautiful so real and brother branham said you just close your eyes and live in it you just live in it it moves you i mean music does that music wasn't in the creation music predates the creation there was already worship in heaven long before the earth was ever built you understand that's why music moves your body that's why you have to be careful what kind of music you listen to you'll find yourself moving and tapping what does that there's a there's an affinity between music and worship in your body see and so so we find that brother branham he begins to talk about this symphony and brother branham keeps it sounds like he's stumbling he says you know this the sympathy when you're when you're the sympathy of god and people are kind of going uh it's symphony and and and brother branham even fine as a man he finally goes he goes that's simp that's that's simple and he turns around and says am i saying that right symphony sympathy and and somebody says symphony symphony symphony right because that's what we are but sympathy is is what's happening to us the symp this the symphony is in sympathy with the composer and it's and it's a musical term called sympathetic resonance and and it happens but in fact is you can take musicians know this you can take a stringed instrument and you can bring another stringed instrument tune the same way and you pluck one string here and the sound energy will make this string over here vibrate you never touched it you see what i'm saying and and so so they so brother branham was actually he kept trying to say symphony and the holy ghost kept interrupting him saying sympathy sympathy in the symphony hallelujah and so so it it it you have all of these instruments and they don't they don't use it a whole lot anymore but back in the day they used it uh a a lot in fact his you find that that mozart uh he actually wrote a number of pieces for an instrument called the viola diamori and and and there and it was a precursor to some of the later inventions but what the biola it was just like a regular viola stringed instrument across the bridge moving down a fretboard but what happened was they drilled holes and so that with the with other guts of strings underneath through the holes that the sound would go through and vibrate the under so you had an over and under and mozart talked about how that it makes a a silvery velvety sound because what it does is it prolongs the sound decay so that instead of just boom it's boom it just keeps going once god said it the church just god said it and people say god said and people say what did he say you understand why what's wrong with your people [Applause] why are you acting like that i don't know something something's moving me son there's an invisible force and i can't resist it somebody's plucking on something and i'm having an effect by it because so it doesn't matter him in heaven and me on the earth when he strikes a cord i move whatever his will is is my will hallelujah this is the mystery that god has invited you into today to have fellowship with that's the mystery that you yeah and and they wrote all kinds of parts for it and even even the very famous madame butterfly and there she is and and and there's a scene where she's there with you know with cocaine and and they're waiting on the arrival of lieutenant pinkerton and all of a sudden in the back of viola diamore begins to play and what is it doing it's it's showing that there's some kind of commensurate there's some kind of love language moving in the air and her heart is ra is moving because he's coming and the anticipation and and she's already waiting and he hasn't even arrived because the music is causing it in her hallelujah there's music playing this is music to my ears they say i say turn on a tape they say oh kentucky hillbilly with broken english it's mozart it's music to me it's how i it's how i open this book and read between the lines i know what the line is saying anybody can read the line but i can read between the lines because i'm in a love affair doesn't matter oh it's a it's a dance of spirits and god comes down to his bride now how much does it mean to you to sing the song oh i want to know him more and he comes down and the dance begins and and and i'm not tripping over his feet and he's not stepping on my toes we're moving oh it's just a love affair and we love the lord and we worship him and our our life is holy and our minds are clean and our families are are moral and pure why because of this beautiful love affair that god started before the world began and you're here today to become that mystery hallelujah [Applause] and that's what's happening in our lives coming to this perfect realization from partial realization to a perfect realization so knowing then that the bible imagery of melchizedek knowing now that's why brother and say he became jesus christ see this is why this is how a prophet could say things like he fills all time space and eternity but he is a being he's not like the wind he prophet could say you know he's the beginning of the creation of god you're the continuation of that same creation no he's not it's not two god and the father and the son weren't two they were the same and and that's what science is finally starting to realize maybe we've been looking at it all wrong if they just listen to a prophet all the way back into the 50s they wouldn't have to spend billions of dollars on research they wouldn't have had to have decades-long grants and scientists from all over the world trying to prove what we already know right in the bible thank god we see these things friends and so this mystery that's that that that had been unfolding since god began to build back his vision in the garden of eden and how it would unfold down to this very ah this very hour how that he would he would work all sides he'd work all sides he had a he had plotted a solution for for the jews under the trumpets and he plotted a completely different redemption solution for the gentiles under the seals and he's working both sides of it that's what you've been seeing happen that's what happened that's what happened in the interval right right at the time he's stopping he's stopping world war one right at the time when when because when the when when the devil released those special demons and got that kind of a jump on on the world then because the bible made a promise that when the enemy comes in like a flood god will raise a standard against him and so right as god hands satan the keys and says go down and open your pit god comes over here and grabs a hold of lake and parnum and grabs a hold of seymour and starts a pentecostal revival in 1906. why because satan's been given keys and the church is going to be given some keys because god is always there to see you through so it doesn't matter what's happening in the ukraine or around the world i mean it matters but i'm just saying no don't be in fear god is here god is on the scene god is in control of these things right in the time he's allowing under the trumpets here comes the sixth trumpet and here here's demons release from euphrates right away you see him going after eichmann and hitler right away because world war one took him out of the control of the ottoman empire world war ii has got to drive him out of central europe he's got to get him home see i mean why right there in the first part of the 20th century right when the first woe is moving and nations are starting to rattle their swords god's over here in a tree speaking to a young boy and he says now don't worry about that just don't defile your body in any way when you get older don't worry about this i got this when you get older i got to work for you to do and as you see god is moving all sides of it the whole thing friends that's why i kept telling you god is not worried god's not worried about this god's worried about this this is why brother branham would always add uncertainty in his in his time predictions and he would say now i could miss it 50 years i could miss it a hundred years but say what did he know what he did know was what this said what he did know is this has always come to pass and it's coming to pass and it always will come to pass see and that's the confidence so here he is and and he's he's working both sides together and you know what he's doing he's taking all the time that he needs to take now let me just come to my last corner this might have just ended up in the four corner building i'm on my last one you got 10 more minutes i want to make this mean more to you than just an increase of understanding because i want to put this down where you live and i want to put it in real time and stitch it into the very fabric of what you're facing on a daily basis that's what preaching is designed to do we're not here just to you know have a have a wonderful rally of of understanding it is stimulation and it does stimulate and we do get excited and i love it and you're lucky i didn't blow through the roof already but i'm here to tell you i want to know i want to know this god now that i see him in all his glory i was coming to church i was driving across coming through the country and i said lord i'm just humbling myself again because lord let it be inspiring i remember sitting as a young man and and ministers my elders from years gone by and how they preached these these things and inspired me and my young heart would just burn and i want your young hearts young people i want you to burn i want you to realize mom and dad haven't fed you cunningly devised tales this is real and it's provable and you overlay history with this and it fits perfect it hits exactly you take the take the most cutting edge science you're not going to get more cutting edge than than quantum mechanics and take all that they think they know and overlay it with this and it suddenly starts making perfect sense and now i see now i see how that it's all expression and it's god unfolding himself into a family so we find out friends that that when the dead in christ rise this bride's catching away occurs i want you to take some confidence here it will not come one day late and it will not come one day early i don't care where your station is or what you got going on i'm here to tell you that you are locked into a mystery that you can't get out of and this thing is translating you and transforming you and i'm here to tell you i want to give you this piece of news according to the bible and you can take courage and run with it god is doing more in you than you know he's doing more in your children he's doing more in your family he's doing more in your life than you're even aware of hallelujah and i'm here to tell you when he does it it'll be right on time he's on time every time all the time even satan right here in his zenith of power and his zenith of influence of the world he can't stop it i you know here's what i love telling the devil when he comes to try to he already knows he can't stop god so you know he'll come after you remember how brother branham said he said now satan couldn't tell me so when he started talking to me he said he couldn't tell me there was no god because i'd already met him he said but what he told me was he don't care about you oh there's a god but he don't care about you if he cared about you why is your wife laying down there a cold stiff laying in the morgan your baby and you're begging god for her life and god drops a black sheep down as if to say shut up i don't even want to talk to you and you said he could heal cancer and the whole town thinks you're crazy and nobody will have anything to do with you and he said i was i was crazy and he said i'd give my whole life and he said i thought well if he if he can't he said that's right that's right that's right he's starting to agree now satan's got him he's moving this is the prophet of god and he's already going down the path of reasoning like eve and he says he says that's right he said i was about to say well if he can't then i'll just he said i was about to say then i'll quit and he said that's right and if he can't do it then i'll and he said something held [Applause] something was holding something was inside wouldn't let him cross that line and he just kissed her and he said sherry honey daddy wanted to raise you but the angels are coming to pack you i'll bury you with mama and on that morning i'll see you baby i'll see you again because because i get all back everything i ever loved hallelujah and god's intention friends is to have a bride ready to take a flight and i'm here to tell you something friends brother john we're not going to miss this flight this flight ain't going to get delayed this flight ain't going to get canceled it doesn't matter what the storms of life happen it doesn't matter what's happening in the middle east or europe or america or the white house or the kremlin or the vatican this flight is leaving [Music] and i'm going to be honest say how do you know i'm already on it say but what if you wait too late it's already too late for the devil i tell him that i love telling him all the time satan you're already too late he comes in he tries to wear you tries to fake you out tries to lie to you tries to tell you if if god loved you this wouldn't happen if you loved god you wouldn't have done this oh just put him in his place friends and say it's already too late i've already been impregnated by the word i've already got faith rising up out of my heart my soul has already crossed over into its eternal day sitting together in heavenly places in christ jesus that's why that's why it's impossible for someone born again to backslide now you might go off and defile yourself and embarrass yourself and and and god have to come with a rod of correction and whip you back into shape because good parents do that but you but you but you understand that that once you pass from death to life and that soul is in his eternal realm then brother branham said that they're in that eternal realm there was no there's no today there's no tomorrow there's no yesterday it's just all right now so once you've passed from death to life and you're already in that eternal realm you you can't go back because there is no back there is no back you're just present with god right now i must go forward stumble sure you stumble sure you do you stumble preacher do the preacher stumble of course we do we're just like elijah we have our ups and downs that's what a prophet said we're we're men of like passions as the bible said elijah was a man of like passions brother branham said that many had his ups and downs but i'm here to tell you something friends there's a there's a music playing and something is moving me forward something something won't let me stop something keeps driving me onward i i i keep going and i keep going and i keep going and i might stumble so what i do i i go to my knees say oh but but brother brown brother branham said that the holy ghost brings your body subject to the word it's right it does the holy ghost will never agree with you living carnal he'll always come after you on that kind of thing but he's not make turning you into a robot you understand there it's it's the bride hath made herself ready brother said there's things god won't do because he's waiting for you to do it you can lay these things down you can be free from them say oh i gotta i gotta pray god will help me to help me to lay it down i heard brother jack duff recently he said everybody wants to pray god help me to lay it down he said ain't that funny you didn't pray to pick it up you just picked it up so what do i do lay it down lay it down brother branham said even just just show your respects to god and lay it down and then he'll come behind that and he'll empower you to do it and then it won't just be you know it'll be the king living inside you oh i'm gonna keep pressing on friends how many are gonna keep pressing on with me let's stand to our feet today god bless you i hope you catch it today i hope you realize that you're part of a great mystery that god has been unfolding down through the ages i was torn between singing the song something keeps holding me and i'm going to keep pressing on and i chose i'm going to keep pressing on paul's going to come help me amen i think brother donnie wrote this song and uh you know that song who am i talking to yeah of course you know ask a dumb question you get a dumb look so brother donny's song i keep pressing i'm going to keep pressing on on and on and on pressing on i'm going gonna keep pressing on to the higher calling amen how many want that you know that song amen amen help me out buddy i'm gonna keep pressing on come on now i'm gonna keep pressing home sing it lift it up now i'm gonna keep pressing on to the higher calling i'm gonna keep [Music] [Music] satan tries to stop [Music] that's [Music] let's bring it up sing it tell the devil now [Music] [Applause] i'm [Music] [Music] satan tries to stop me turn me aside [Music] [Applause] there's no use to try even [Music] i'm gonna keep messing it up [Music] [Music] one more time yeah i'm gonna keep [Music] i'm gonna keep pressing all oh i'm gonna keep pressing on to the higher [Music] amen hallelujah thank you [Applause] amen praise the lord this morning thank god for his word oh praise be to god the fellowship of the mystery the fellowship of the mystery i think we you didn't know it some of you but you passed into the eternal dimension this morning you can't think about things the way you thought of them before you can't think about anything the way you thought before and you certainly can't think of things through the filter of the wisdom of this world it's a whole different ball game hallelujah i appreciate the word today and i i have a bunch of things written down but i'm just going to leave it i know we're going to pray for a brother here and whoever else wants to be anointed with oil [Music] but i will say just a couple things that i'd say quickly [Music] and i was saying that something keeps holding me brother kenny help me believe something's key is anybody this morning if you maybe you just had this thought because i'm just trying to give my thoughts is that wow i i'm i'm i feel like my mind's just getting a little behind [Music] there's just so much how many thought that i feel like my mind's just uh can't catch it all and i can tell you your soul's catching all of it if you're a believer your soul is catching all of it can you say man and there might be someone who says my i just really realized this morning i need to read my bible i need to read the book of revelation i'll encourage you to do that those are your bible's got dust at home shame on you you need to read your bible you need to book the read the book of revelations and if you're not in this message you need to be in this message it's people still around the message and even sometimes younger haven't even listened to the seals yet and you say well i'm too busy if you're too busy for that you're too busy [Music] get your bible and read it because you'll understand more what's being said this morning that have come together more but that being laid aside your soul's not missing anything your soul's catching it can you say amen praise the lord one of the things i enjoyed he said is a pastor i see this because you're looking at people's lives you're looking at your own sometimes it's the breakdown is if you just have knowledge of the message the breakdown is that you're not able to blend it together with your everyday life and that's the downfall religion and knowledge will actually separate this mystery this we go to church and hear about the mystery but separate from your everyday life what's going to happen tomorrow in your life that's the trap of the enemy and actually for 2 000 years of religion the religious organized church they actually separate the human being because they don't know the mystery so they separate they make you a separate individual a separate entity than god that's been the trap because if you think it's a separate thing you say well i'm worshiping god i'm trying to get to god they even had a few years ago a little bracelet you wore from the denominations what would jesus do so it's still about whatever he did you see in the bible you duplicate it and you'll be fine this this this has nothing to do with trying to be some this is we're of the same thing we're of the same material something down here is that's why those two separate entities or whatever he called them he's he's uh he knows the terms but they're separated and they're acting the same and yet they're separate it's because they're made of the same they're made of the same somehow as a pastor somehow we say lord what i've heard today anchored in my soul and let it not stop there but let it be blended into my everyday life the decisions i've got to make for jobs the decisions i've got to make for my family the order for my family if i'm i've got some habit in my life that i haven't laid down let this mystery affect my life every day let it be blended let us step out of just carnality into this eternal time zone that we can be the people that god wants us to be in these closing seconds of time be the people something keeps holding me those who want prayer make your way forward be anointed with oil
