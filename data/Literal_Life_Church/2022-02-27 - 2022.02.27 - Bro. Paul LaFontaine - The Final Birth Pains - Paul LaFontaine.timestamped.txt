[0:00] morning as we read a verse of scripture
[0:02] together and then we'll go back to john
[0:05] 16.
[0:08] we're grateful we thank you choir
[0:10] brother kenny for ministering to this
[0:12] morning and
[0:13] our
[0:14] service just have such a good
[0:17] uh representation and team here to bring
[0:19] us into the presence of the lord and
[0:20] create the right atmosphere
[0:22] for the word of god we're thankful for
[0:24] him let's continue to remember jim
[0:27] holtmann in prayer as he's in surgery
[0:28] here this morning we're keeping just
[0:30] tabs on that and just wanted to see how
[0:32] he was doing just here in the next hour
[0:34] or so so let's just keep him in prayer
[0:36] while he's in surgery
[0:38] amen we're going to read from second
[0:40] peter chapter 3 first
[0:42] and then if you let me go into john 16
[0:46] we'll do that as well
[0:48] second peter 3
[0:50] 2 peter 3. i'd like to read
[0:52] we'll just take the time and read from
[0:54] verse
[0:56] 3
[0:58] knowing this first that there shall come
[1:00] in the last days scoffers
[1:03] walking after their own lust and saying
[1:05] where is the promise of his coming
[1:07] for since the fathers fell asleep all
[1:09] things continue as they were
[1:11] from the beginning of the creation
[1:14] so this group
[1:15] knows
[1:16] that things are to take place but
[1:18] they're mocking it and scoffing it
[1:20] their and their their manner of life is
[1:22] to live as if it's not going to happen
[1:25] but if god said it's going to happen
[1:26] it's going to happen
[1:28] so this is another group who's living
[1:30] they're scoffing but their their manner
[1:32] of life is to live
[1:34] not only scoffing it and don't not
[1:36] believing that it's true
[1:38] but there is something else in the world
[1:40] that says if it is true
[1:42] we're going to do everything within our
[1:44] power to stop it
[1:46] and that's another
[1:47] weakness and arrogance of man
[1:50] for this they willingly are ignorant of
[1:52] that by the word of god the heavens were
[1:54] of old and the earth standing out of the
[1:56] water and in the water whereby the world
[1:58] that then was being overflowed with
[2:01] water perished it happened how many can
[2:03] say amen
[2:04] but the heavens and the earth which are
[2:05] now by the same word are kept in store
[2:09] reserved unto the fire against the day
[2:11] of judgment and perdition of ungodly men
[2:13] but believe beloved be not ignorant of
[2:16] this one thing that one day of the lord
[2:18] is as a thousand years and a thousand
[2:20] years as one day the lord is not slack
[2:23] concerning his promise as some men count
[2:26] slackness but his long-suffering to us
[2:28] word not willing that any should perish
[2:30] but that all should come to repentance
[2:33] but the day of the lord will come as a
[2:35] thief in the night in the which the
[2:36] heavens will
[2:37] shall pass away with great noise and
[2:40] elements shall melt with fervent heat
[2:42] the earth also and the works that
[2:44] therein are shall be burned up seeing
[2:46] then that all these things shall be
[2:48] dissolved what manner of persons ought
[2:51] ye to be in all holy conversation
[2:54] all holy
[2:56] manner of life in all holy conversation
[2:59] and godliness
[3:00] looking for and hasting unto the coming
[3:03] of the day of our god wherein the heaven
[3:05] shall be on fire shall be dissolved and
[3:07] the element shall melt with fervent heat
[3:10] nevertheless we according to his promise
[3:13] now here's the other group we're living
[3:15] according to his promise
[3:17] we're living on his promises
[3:19] we're looking for something else can you
[3:21] say amen
[3:22] and you can't endure what's coming on
[3:24] the earth unless you know of the promise
[3:26] that there's something else coming
[3:29] nevertheless we according to his promise
[3:30] look for the new heavens and new earth
[3:32] wherein dwelleth righteousness wherefore
[3:35] beloved seeing that ye look for such
[3:37] things be diligent that ye may be found
[3:40] of him in peace without spot and
[3:42] blameless if you won't mind back to john
[3:45] one of the gospels john chapter 16
[3:48] and they can pull up there pull it up
[3:50] there quickly if they want john 16 and
[3:53] verse 20
[3:54] verily verily i say unto you that ye
[3:56] shall weep and lament but the world
[3:58] shall rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful
[4:00] but your sorrow your sorrow and here's
[4:03] the other group now
[4:04] there's one group that that may sorrow
[4:07] and yet they may rejoice in this world
[4:09] we may go through sour but the world
[4:11] shall rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful
[4:13] but your sorrow shall be turned into joy
[4:17] a woman when she is in travail hath
[4:19] sorrow because her hour is come but as
[4:22] soon as she is delivered of a child she
[4:26] rem she remembers no more the anguish
[4:30] for joy that a man is born into the
[4:33] world
[4:34] blessed be his name i want to speak this
[4:36] morning a little on the the final birth
[4:38] pains
[4:39] heavenly
[4:40] father
[4:42] we are happy christians here today lord
[4:45] not out of just a shallow emotional
[4:48] thing but lord our hearts are settled
[4:51] our hearts are anchored
[4:54] and lord i heard someone this week
[4:56] saying that the very day that
[4:58] thursday i think it was when we went to
[5:00] war this believer woke up and
[5:02] they had a dream that the rapture took
[5:04] place
[5:06] and lord she just got on her knees and
[5:08] just began to pray
[5:10] say lord
[5:11] let me be ready
[5:14] these are the things that's happening
[5:16] lord and believers
[5:18] are saying in their hearts this morning
[5:19] lord if there's anything that you have
[5:21] to do in my life
[5:22] to change me let it be now
[5:25] let me not leave this building this
[5:27] morning until you change me lord i don't
[5:30] want to leave the same way that i came
[5:32] for god we're looking at things from a
[5:34] different perspective when we know that
[5:36] god there is a promise that lays ahead
[5:38] of us we're not living as if we plan as
[5:41] if you're coming 10 years from now but
[5:43] we want to live every moment as if the
[5:45] moment is now
[5:47] that's the way we want to live maybe
[5:50] that's why there's such a hunger to be
[5:51] in the house of the lord today there's a
[5:53] cry
[5:54] to be here lord and to be where your
[5:56] presence is
[5:58] to be where we can hear the word of god
[6:00] where it can encourage us where it can
[6:03] solidify things for us where we can see
[6:06] your perspective lord
[6:08] god and we could that our eyes could be
[6:10] to the worldly things and our pressures
[6:12] and our possessions
[6:14] all that becomes strangely dim
[6:17] in the light of your glory and grace
[6:19] help us to see you this morning as we
[6:21] commit the service to you and we pray
[6:23] every heart would be blessed and
[6:24] strengthened and encouraged whoever
[6:26] hears in jesus name amen god bless you
[6:30] once you shake somebody's hand and greet
[6:31] them in christian love this morning and
[6:33] god bless you all for coming
[6:35] joining in the house of god those that
[6:36] are listening online all the families
[6:38] that are part of our church god bless
[6:40] you all we love you
[6:41] amen
[6:43] so we want to as we were
[6:45] hearing
[6:46] some of the events this week and we
[6:48] won't be all on the events of course
[6:51] but uh these things trigger our hearts
[6:53] and i was hearing a term quite a bit in
[6:55] the news of that the the news people
[6:58] referring to
[6:59] um
[7:01] world war iii in referring to this world
[7:04] war iii and no one really knows uh
[7:07] if this is that one uh but we know that
[7:10] there's a world war three coming
[7:13] and no one really knows but i think it's
[7:14] interesting that they referred to it
[7:16] and as they kept referring to the world
[7:18] war iii then i thought of birth pains
[7:22] and i thought of that message that
[7:23] brother brown preached because in that
[7:25] as he's talking about different things
[7:27] of that and you're welcome to uh
[7:29] encourage you to listen to that this
[7:31] week and it was a wonderful message to
[7:33] listen to it again yesterday and to see
[7:35] the theme and and the basically the
[7:37] mystery that was unfolded to us to be
[7:39] able to see historical events like the
[7:41] first world war the second world war and
[7:43] then the third one coming on to be able
[7:45] to see that in light of the mystery of
[7:47] scripture and to be able to sing and
[7:49] that's what a prophet does if you didn't
[7:50] know this morning or you're listening a
[7:52] prophet is uniquely gifted to be able to
[7:54] unlock
[7:55] events and unlock the word by the way
[7:58] that he says it we would not be able to
[8:00] do that in ourselves but that's the
[8:02] specialty of a prophet and gifted that
[8:04] the way he says it unlocks the mystery
[8:07] behind it this isn't anything different
[8:09] than what jesus said as the disciples
[8:12] said why do you speak in parables he
[8:14] said because it's given to you to know
[8:16] the mysteries in other words it's given
[8:19] to the believers to know more than just
[8:21] the parable or more than the events but
[8:23] to see the mystery of the events we're
[8:26] blessed this morning
[8:28] and so as they kept saying it i uh as
[8:30] this was uh birth pains is something the
[8:33] prophet referred to
[8:34] when he came to naming what the first
[8:37] two war wars and we probably would have
[8:39] never heard anybody refer to world war
[8:42] one and world war ii as birth pains like
[8:45] a woman has a birth we would have never
[8:46] heard that except he does and he's
[8:48] saying that and i love how the prophet
[8:51] in his simplicity brings something
[8:52] natural to type the spiritual otherwise
[8:55] we wouldn't be able to understand it
[8:57] correctly it's simple because he takes a
[8:59] natural thing that a woman goes through
[9:01] and having a child and he puts that into
[9:03] political events and he referred to the
[9:05] first two wars as birth pains that are
[9:08] coming because the scripture says as i
[9:11] read this morning this this earth is to
[9:14] give way to a new heavens and a new
[9:16] earth in other words there's a new baby
[9:18] coming there's a new earth coming it's
[9:20] not going to be a patched up earth it's
[9:22] going to be a brand new earth
[9:25] can you say amen and whenever you have
[9:27] something brand new coming in god you
[9:30] always have a death and you always have
[9:33] pain that comes before it can you say
[9:35] amen
[9:36] and we'll get into that a little bit
[9:37] because that's the process in god's
[9:39] kingdom that's the way it works in god's
[9:41] kingdom that's not the way that it works
[9:43] in the world we tend to polish ourselves
[9:46] up we tend to try to make ourselves
[9:47] better the world gets better and better
[9:49] we intellectually try to change
[9:50] something or do something or patch up
[9:52] what's already done even if it's dirty
[9:54] and it's filthy we patch it up and do
[9:56] the best we can but when god does
[9:58] something he does it brand new and then
[10:01] it comes the way that its birth is
[10:03] through pain
[10:06] through suffering
[10:08] through hard times
[10:10] can you say amen
[10:12] i'll tell you if you have a real true
[10:14] new birth this morning it's because
[10:16] probably a lot of your life and
[10:18] especially right before the new birth
[10:20] you went through hard times
[10:23] you went through pain because why you
[10:25] had to die out to yourself to have a new
[10:28] birth
[10:29] and it's just the way the kingdom of god
[10:31] works you can avoid it you can get
[10:33] around it you can try to polish it up
[10:35] i'm a good person i'm okay i love god
[10:37] but that's not the new birth there has
[10:39] to be a death before there's a new birth
[10:43] many people will not allow themselves to
[10:45] go through that pain but if they only
[10:47] knew the joy if they only knew what was
[10:49] coming then they would die out to
[10:50] themselves
[10:52] because what god has brand new is so
[10:54] much far beyond what you're living now
[10:57] hallelujah
[10:59] and so now by looking at it this way we
[11:01] see this these nervous scary events as
[11:05] bringing us closer to the birth of a new
[11:08] life a new heavens and a new earth so we
[11:10] see these events as not the scary
[11:12] nervous events that the world looks at
[11:15] it as but we see it as something of
[11:17] giving birth to the new life giving
[11:19] birth to the new world and that is a
[11:21] very exciting result that when it's all
[11:24] over can you say amen the prophet opens
[11:27] the mystery that we know if it's in the
[11:29] final days when it's all over as a woman
[11:31] going through her final days of birth
[11:34] pains when it's all over then a baby is
[11:37] born the pain increases before the baby
[11:40] is born
[11:41] can you say man the contractions
[11:43] increase that you know and how feeble i
[11:46] am to talk about this this morning when
[11:47] i haven't had a baby myself we have
[11:49] professionals in this room
[11:52] that have been through this and none of
[11:53] you guys better talk about you knowing
[11:56] about you don't know nothing and how how
[11:57] many sisters would raise their hand how
[11:59] many has ever had their husbands say to
[12:01] somebody we're going to have a baby or
[12:03] we had a baby and the wife looks over
[12:05] what you mean we
[12:09] we had a baby you didn't do nothing
[12:10] hardly
[12:12] but you mean we partner
[12:15] yeah so none of you but there's some
[12:16] professionals in the room and i'll say
[12:19] this that the mystery of god is actually
[12:21] written in the life of a woman
[12:24] the mystery of the bride the mystery of
[12:26] what the bride goes through
[12:28] the mystery of
[12:29] everything bringing forth christ lies
[12:32] and she lives out this mystery when she
[12:34] dresses modest and lives like god said
[12:36] to the sailor she's she's a light she's
[12:39] a word more than what i can preach the
[12:42] woman is the mystery to this world of
[12:44] what god's doing in his bride that's a
[12:46] pretty important position god bless you
[12:48] sisters we give you praise and honor
[12:50] this morning for holding up that
[12:52] standard
[12:55] she's been through it just they know so
[12:57] i'm not going to talk about it but we
[12:58] know that as she gets closer and closer
[13:01] the pain gets more intense and the
[13:03] suffering gets more intense can you say
[13:05] amen the pains increase but see when you
[13:08] know the joy that's just a few minutes
[13:11] away you can endure
[13:13] and you can have
[13:14] hallelujah
[13:16] in the valley
[13:18] somebody say praise the lord
[13:20] you can have hallelujah in the valley
[13:23] because the joy i'll just say this to
[13:25] you jesus endure endured the most
[13:28] suffering of any human being and he
[13:31] endured that pain at the cross for you
[13:33] and i so we wouldn't have to take it
[13:36] can you say man he endured the worst
[13:38] pain but the bible says he for the joy
[13:42] that was set before him endured the pain
[13:45] of the cross the only way that he could
[13:47] bear it is that the joy that was set
[13:49] before him and that's the same with the
[13:51] revelation with us the only way that we
[13:54] can endure this the only way we can
[13:55] survive this is we know what lies ahead
[14:03] praise the lord
[14:04] so the pains increase there's another
[14:06] reference to it in luke chapter 21
[14:09] thought i would read that if you guys
[14:10] want to pull up luke chapter 21. it says
[14:13] verse 25 this is where he refers to it
[14:16] luke 21 25
[14:18] it says and there shall be signs in the
[14:20] sun and the moon and the stars and upon
[14:22] the earth distressed of nations
[14:24] with perplexity the sea and the waves
[14:26] roaring
[14:27] men's hearts failing them for fear and
[14:30] for looking after those things which are
[14:31] coming on the earth for the powers of
[14:34] heaven shall be shaken
[14:36] and then shall they see the son of man
[14:37] coming in the cloud with power and great
[14:39] glory and when these things begin to
[14:41] come to pass
[14:43] then look up and lift up your heads for
[14:45] your redemption draw now jesus is saying
[14:48] the same thing when there's perplexity
[14:50] of nations when there's earthquakes in
[14:52] diverse places when men's hearts failing
[14:54] for fear when all this stuff begins to
[14:56] intensify and get more and more as
[14:58] you'll see in the scripture more and
[15:00] more then when these things begin to
[15:02] come to pass then we can look up and
[15:04] lift our lift up our head because the
[15:06] joy that's set before us
[15:09] that says to us our redemption is
[15:11] drawing nigh
[15:13] it's the only way to look at events
[15:16] the right way and that's with the
[15:18] revelation
[15:20] you bound by the scare and as i said
[15:22] last sunday you're going to make an
[15:24] issue with some family in the church
[15:26] knowing these events are taken and we're
[15:28] this close you're going to distance
[15:29] yourself from the body of christ now
[15:32] you're going to backslide i say to you
[15:34] as a gospel minister you need to be
[15:36] under the word you need to be clinging
[15:38] to the body of christ you don't need to
[15:40] be running away
[15:41] [Applause]
[15:44] god have mercy on people that are doing
[15:46] that even today
[15:48] god have mercy on their souls
[15:52] so if you don't see it the way jesus say
[15:54] goes on to say look up lift up your head
[15:56] for your redemption is drawing nigh
[15:58] and and so that just uh we'll continue
[16:01] with that in a minute but if you don't
[16:02] see it this way you will be looking
[16:04] at
[16:05] things like the world looks at it where
[16:08] you where you stand and you
[16:11] where you're standing there and they're
[16:12] gonna hand you the next
[16:14] uh fear
[16:16] that you're going to worry about the
[16:18] next year
[16:22] the next conversations at the water
[16:24] cooler started on thursday and guess
[16:27] what it wasn't about covet anymore
[16:33] what happened to coven i mean it's like
[16:35] that's the whole conversation for two
[16:37] years but now that's over and so now if
[16:39] you stand uh not as a believer stance
[16:42] they're gonna hand you the next fear and
[16:44] thing that you need to worry about the
[16:46] next year or two
[16:47] okay they're gonna hand you the next
[16:49] fear and they're done and i don't know
[16:51] if you were watching but this thing
[16:53] starts on thursday morning i believe and
[16:55] then i just see a little small news
[16:57] article that says on friday the cdc will
[17:00] be issuing
[17:02] their lowest uh
[17:05] requirements for mass mass are going
[17:07] away how many can say praise the lord
[17:09] massacre going away man i'll tell you
[17:10] i'm so happy
[17:13] and our counties included gideon looked
[17:15] it up this morning lucas in monroe
[17:17] county it's included the massacre gone
[17:19] praise be to god i feel free i can show
[17:22] you my face
[17:24] but did you ever catch that while the
[17:27] the new thing starts thursday
[17:29] and it's consuming the news cycle and
[17:32] then now all of a sudden now this goes
[17:34] away
[17:35] and if you're carnal you're going to let
[17:37] them hand you
[17:39] the next fear-driven thing
[17:44] that's not how i want to live i'm not
[17:46] waiting for issues to come forth from
[17:49] the cdc or ukraine or anything i'm not
[17:53] going to be bound by their fears i'll do
[17:55] what needs to be done if it doesn't
[17:57] contradict the
[17:58] word but i will refuse to live under the
[18:02] fear that they're handing me every day
[18:04] and you should too can you say man
[18:10] brother brown says if they came to the
[18:12] door and your name was on a box that was
[18:15] being delivered to you and ended up
[18:16] being a box of rattlesnakes
[18:18] your name is on it it's coming to you he
[18:20] talked about symptoms of illness
[18:24] came to your door but guess what you
[18:26] don't have to sign for it
[18:28] so the fear that they're handing out i'm
[18:30] not signing for it anymore i'm not going
[18:32] to sign for that box of rattlesnakes can
[18:34] you say amen they want me to have it but
[18:37] i'm not going to sign for it somebody
[18:39] needs to say praise the lord because you
[18:40] know this is true you know they hand out
[18:42] what they have you know they control the
[18:44] minds of the people
[18:46] it's true friends and the quicker we
[18:48] admit it and say lord i want to be in
[18:50] that hiding place with jesus christ
[18:53] that's where i want to be
[18:55] my peace and my rest is in the word of
[18:57] god that he has sent us
[19:00] and not in the fears of man
[19:02] i guarantee you that's how the saints in
[19:04] the ukraine have to live this morning i
[19:06] guarantee you
[19:07] what a blessing to see
[19:09] some believers and some christians over
[19:11] there send out that song or singing it
[19:13] in ukraine just about broke my heart
[19:15] they're singing peace of god
[19:18] cover me
[19:20] can't sing it in ukrainian maybe rap can
[19:24] cover me through the storm
[19:28] i just i broke down
[19:31] praise the lord
[19:33] hallelujah in the valley
[19:36] the sisters here who have given birth
[19:39] going back to that uh
[19:40] you know they've experienced it and the
[19:42] breaking forth of new life
[19:45] and uh being able to experience the pain
[19:47] that goes through it this is what
[19:48] brother brad refers to and jesus refers
[19:50] to like a woman going through a woman
[19:52] when she's in travail has sorrow because
[19:55] her hours come but as soon as she has
[19:57] delivered the of the child she
[19:59] remembereth no more the anguish for joy
[20:01] than a man that is born into the world
[20:03] the spiritual birth is the same way as
[20:06] the natural birth a lot of people run
[20:08] from the pain part of it can you say
[20:10] amen but if you would just sit still and
[20:12] know the pain that's in you is to bring
[20:15] forth new life it's not the new birth is
[20:17] not a new intellectual exercise it's not
[20:20] shaking the preacher's hand it's not
[20:22] speaking in tongues it's not a feeling
[20:24] or emotion the new birth goes much
[20:27] deeper than that can you say man and and
[20:29] it works by a natural birth it's the
[20:32] pain that a woman goes through you're
[20:34] not going to get to that new birth
[20:35] without some pain without your system
[20:38] being jolted your life crumbling apart
[20:40] sometimes
[20:42] divorces and all kinds of things can
[20:44] happen and a lot of times it's driving
[20:46] the person in this pain of life to seek
[20:49] god can you say man and to say finally
[20:52] god i need you more than anything else i
[20:55] don't care about anything except a new
[20:58] birth
[21:00] pain drives you to that suffering drives
[21:02] you to that because that's the way god
[21:04] set it up can you say amen
[21:06] praise the lord and and in god's kingdom
[21:09] you can't get around it and and so we
[21:11] see that new life it's not an
[21:12] intellectual but your whole life changes
[21:15] i had some good fellowship with michael
[21:17] and
[21:17] jason coming home friday night from the
[21:19] youth meeting and to see god forming
[21:21] these young men's lives and to be able
[21:23] to hear their testimonies and their
[21:24] story where they came from where they're
[21:26] at now and i don't mean to embarrass
[21:28] them this morning but god god is doing
[21:30] something god these new ones that have
[21:32] come god's doing something in their life
[21:34] but i can tell you it's not without pain
[21:36] it's not without suffering it's not
[21:38] without god challenging the mind and
[21:40] challenging everything they ever knew
[21:42] before it's painful friends but i'll
[21:44] tell you i complimented my brother to
[21:46] see that he's stuck with it he's
[21:48] sticking with it and he's staying around
[21:51] the word of god a lot of people would
[21:52] have bailed out a long time ago but this
[21:54] young man here wants to be baptized here
[21:56] in the next couple weeks he's stuck with
[21:58] the word of god in the name of jesus
[22:00] god's doing something
[22:02] but it's not without pain
[22:06] we think sometimes the birth is just
[22:07] like that but a lot of times it's
[22:09] through a lot of pain and suffering
[22:12] losses can you say amen challenges where
[22:14] the word is rebuking you and all these
[22:16] other things
[22:18] but oh
[22:19] the end result is what we're looking at
[22:22] hallelujah i could join my brother
[22:25] and grab his hand and step into a
[22:27] rapture with brother jason step into a
[22:30] rapture with brother brother michael
[22:35] a bunch of other stories in the church
[22:38] technically you shouldn't be here today
[22:40] through your story you shouldn't be here
[22:41] you should be saying amen to the word of
[22:43] god there's a lot of other places you
[22:45] could be but it's god grace and the pain
[22:47] that you've been through that puts you
[22:49] here this morning
[22:50] amen
[22:52] your story every story is different but
[22:54] i guarantee your story if it's of god
[22:57] will bring you
[22:59] to being ready for a rapture
[23:01] amen
[23:03] amen you don't like your story
[23:06] i don't like mine either we didn't get a
[23:08] choice of our story
[23:10] we didn't get a choice of what our
[23:11] family would go through
[23:13] we didn't get that choice
[23:15] but god certainly was watching over it
[23:18] and the most inhumane the most the most
[23:21] tragic things that happen to us
[23:25] can't get what much worse than
[23:27] brothers throwing joseph into the pit
[23:30] his own flesh and blood
[23:33] selling him to egypt into slavery
[23:35] slavery
[23:36] you can't get much within feeling
[23:38] rejected and betrayed
[23:40] and yet god's working to fulfill the
[23:43] vision
[23:44] for his life
[23:46] hallelujah
[23:49] i feel his presence here this morning
[23:51] i may not be long i'm not feeling that
[23:53] well i'm feeling
[23:54] uh i'm not accepting those rattlesnakes
[23:56] and symptoms
[23:58] but in the in my soul
[24:01] i just feel that i love the presence of
[24:03] god i love to be near him i
[24:05] i love to hear his voice
[24:08] and like brother boaz said if you're if
[24:10] you're hearing that still small voice
[24:12] this morning
[24:13] you you know that he has to be real
[24:15] close for you to hear a still small
[24:16] voice
[24:19] i think god doesn't have to shout at us
[24:22] but it's a still small voice
[24:25] so
[24:26] your whole life changes when god's
[24:28] getting over you it it it inconvenes it
[24:31] in it gives you inconveniences in life
[24:34] doesn't it do that with a woman
[24:36] uh
[24:37] that's become pregnant
[24:39] and her life now becomes inconvenienced
[24:43] once again sisters you know all about it
[24:45] but
[24:46] life wasn't about it you can't
[24:49] always move around as easy as you did as
[24:51] you get bigger
[24:55] and i was suggesting those uh i read up
[24:57] on all this you know and i was i i said
[24:59] hun i read up that you're when you're
[25:02] pregnant like you're supposed to be
[25:03] wearing snow skis around the house and
[25:05] walking in them because your back will
[25:07] get out of shape so do you want me to go
[25:09] buy you some snow skis and you to walk
[25:11] around the house no i don't want no
[25:12] scooters snow skis i'm not gonna waddle
[25:15] around i'm already waddling around
[25:21] snow skis that's what they said
[25:23] and
[25:25] your life becomes inconvenienced and you
[25:28] can't
[25:28] do all the things you did before and you
[25:31] get you go through morning sickness and
[25:32] you go through these things and and then
[25:34] there's sisters that don't have any of
[25:36] that which everybody else is jealous of
[25:38] they don't have any of it but in most
[25:40] cases you have changes and you can't fit
[25:42] into the clothes that you fit in before
[25:44] and and what's going on and there's
[25:46] something growing inside of you
[25:50] there's a new life growing inside of you
[25:52] and this is a type of the spiritual is
[25:55] that when you have new life that's
[25:56] getting ready to be birthed in you
[25:57] there's going to be pain there's going
[25:59] to be suffering you're going to be
[26:00] inconvenienced
[26:03] life won't be the same can you say man
[26:05] and and that's why today we live in a
[26:08] day of
[26:08] abortion it's a spirit can you say man
[26:12] because women are saying i'm not going
[26:13] to go through all that i want a baby but
[26:15] i don't want to go through all that so
[26:16] i'm going to end that i don't want to go
[26:18] through that suffering as brother bram
[26:19] says she's going to mother a little dog
[26:21] and she's going to abort the baby and
[26:23] she don't want to have all the
[26:24] inconveniences of life she'll take care
[26:26] of a little snotty dog
[26:28] excuse me for being sarcastic
[26:31] and treat him like a baby
[26:33] because she's neglecting i don't want to
[26:35] go through all that pain i don't want to
[26:37] go through all that suffering and then
[26:39] you know of course they have uh the
[26:41] epidural that helps women to go through
[26:43] the pain which i'm not against that i
[26:45] thank god for it for my wife because she
[26:48] she needed that some sisters don't need
[26:49] it and then sisters get real heroic and
[26:52] say i don't need any of it i want to go
[26:54] through a normal normal thing and my
[26:56] wife got that on a couple of our babies
[26:57] she said i i don't want to go have any
[26:59] epidurals anything i don't want to put
[27:01] that in my body i'm going to do it and
[27:02] paul i need your help to stay with me we
[27:04] went through classes we did it we were
[27:06] ready
[27:07] breathe do this lamaze whatever it was
[27:10] and we're ready i don't want to do this
[27:12] i don't want any medicine i want to do
[27:13] this
[27:14] naturally
[27:16] it must be something of god in them or
[27:18] something i don't know and and so i said
[27:20] we're doing this i think it was the
[27:22] third one or whatever i said okay
[27:24] after we went she had long labors it was
[27:26] like 20 i don't know
[27:28] 20
[27:28] 48 hours long on labor's i thought she
[27:31] was gonna die everything every time i
[27:33] thought she was finished because she
[27:34] looked like she was going to die
[27:37] shouldn't have said that
[27:42] she said that in one of them she said i
[27:45] feel like i'm going to die and i said
[27:47] well you look like you're gonna die
[27:48] honey that was the wrong thing
[27:51] a few hours after that i was down in the
[27:53] cafeteria
[27:57] i was
[28:00] that's fine they give them something and
[28:02] you know the old joke goes that when
[28:03] when should you take the epidural and
[28:06] somebody said on the news as soon as you
[28:08] find out you're pregnant start taking
[28:09] the epidural
[28:11] just keep feeding it
[28:14] but that's all
[28:15] it's all remember that's a type of the
[28:17] spiritual that i don't want to go
[28:18] through the pain of it and there's
[28:19] churches today thousands of them that
[28:22] are making an atmosphere you don't have
[28:24] to go through the pain of dying to
[28:26] yourself you don't have to give up your
[28:28] makeup you don't have to give up all
[28:30] these things of the world you don't have
[28:31] to diet yourself you don't have to quit
[28:34] and keep no no you can come and give
[28:36] your heart to the lord and put your name
[28:38] on the book that's that's something
[28:40] that's trying to help get rid of the
[28:42] pain and suffering but you'll never get
[28:44] to a true new birth
[28:48] is this okay this morning
[28:50] no there's churches and you can go join
[28:52] them and i encourage you if you're
[28:54] miserable here you probably should go
[28:55] join them because they're not they're
[28:57] going to make a painless experience
[28:59] they're not going to preach against sin
[29:01] they're not going to nab the sin in your
[29:03] life they're not going to do it they're
[29:04] going to sugarcoat it and say that
[29:05] you're okay but listen i want to be
[29:08] under the gospel of jesus christ the one
[29:10] paul preached the one brother branham
[29:12] preached and the holy ghost field
[29:13] ministers of all time have preached it
[29:16] straight like it is not holding anything
[29:18] back now if that minister has an agenda
[29:20] to offend somebody that's that's between
[29:23] that's wrong but when it's the love of
[29:25] god correcting from the word of god
[29:27] i want more of that in my life than i
[29:29] ever wanted it
[29:32] and when i get tough on certain things
[29:34] thank god i have some saints texting me
[29:36] saying preach it like it is in the word
[29:38] of god don't hold back
[29:41] your church may get smaller but keep
[29:43] preaching the word
[29:47] where else you're going to go to hear
[29:48] somebody correct you where else you're
[29:50] going to go in this world not too many
[29:51] places will tell you where you're wrong
[29:53] in your life
[29:54] if it's the voice of the lord i want
[29:56] them to correct me now i don't want to
[29:57] be on judgment day i want my judgment
[30:00] right here judgment begins at the house
[30:02] of god can anybody say that's the
[30:04] scripture
[30:05] i don't want to wait till judgment day i
[30:07] want him to judge me right now
[30:10] take the sin out of my life right now
[30:14] so the spiritual birth is the same way
[30:16] and i just finished with sister rebecca
[30:18] i've embarrassed her enough today but
[30:19] you know
[30:21] just to say that each one of these
[30:23] things i thought she was going to and
[30:25] then the third one this
[30:28] i was going through and helping her and
[30:29] we we went we put her in a tub there and
[30:32] we were doing everything we had been
[30:33] learned so she could avoid the epidural
[30:36] and after 48 hours or whatever it is
[30:38] she's looking to say go get him go get
[30:40] him get me the epidural i want to get
[30:41] the upper door and i go but but hon
[30:44] i promised you
[30:46] to stick with you we're going to do this
[30:48] thing and she
[30:49] you
[30:50] go get the epidural
[31:00] but here's the here's the exciting thing
[31:02] is that i i was worried after every
[31:05] prank after every delivery and i was
[31:07] actually suggesting ask the doctor she's
[31:10] a couple times she come real close and
[31:12] she was bad i thought i was going to
[31:14] lose her and
[31:15] that was me and so know that we're fine
[31:17] and after everybody i said hun should we
[31:19] consider maybe this one being the last
[31:20] one and i was talking no no she's
[31:22] holding that baby
[31:26] and she forgot
[31:30] she forgot every pain she forgot the
[31:32] last 48 hours wasn't even her mind
[31:35] holding that baby smiling
[31:37] sweat dripping down and
[31:39] her hair not like it looks this morning
[31:44] just completely no sleep for 48 hours
[31:47] but she's got a smile on her face i said
[31:50] honey you think maybe we can no no no
[31:52] i'm not done
[31:54] and
[31:55] after after the third one she's saying
[31:57] the second one third one after the
[31:59] fourth one it was real bad and actually
[32:02] after that point the doctor did suggest
[32:03] we stop after that because it was
[32:05] starting to get she was getting a little
[32:07] older and stuff so we took that wisdom
[32:09] but but she's still saying after the
[32:10] fourth one once she's holding that baby
[32:12] who was it gabriella and you can imagine
[32:14] holding gabriella
[32:18] like you you'd want to keep having
[32:20] 15 more babies after gabriella
[32:25] i'm serious it's like we're having we're
[32:27] going to be 19 and county we're going to
[32:29] have a television show
[32:34] she told me i said hon don't you think
[32:36] don't you think this is pretty rough i'm
[32:38] worried about you don't you think we
[32:40] should just be done she says in canada
[32:43] not let's not make the decision i'm not
[32:45] done
[32:46] and i go back to the cafeteria and say
[32:48] this woman is crazy
[32:50] she's absolutely crazy going through all
[32:52] of this pain going through all this
[32:54] suffering
[32:55] so if i'm scaring all you young girls
[32:57] that are single right now
[32:58] don't you ever let me scare you because
[33:00] there's nothing there's nothing in the
[33:02] world like bringing forth a child into
[33:04] this world nothing like it
[33:07] the pain
[33:08] the suffering
[33:11] you probably will have it but there's
[33:13] nothing like the joy
[33:15] or you could be like sister phyllis
[33:18] used to be in our church just past the
[33:19] way she's in colorado but she's in the
[33:20] church when we started it and she's
[33:22] she's nobody knew her age because she
[33:24] never told it so we never researched it
[33:26] but she was she had to be 90 something
[33:28] but she always looked about 50 40 and
[33:31] nobody you know not a lot of tucker age
[33:32] and so one time i was talking to her
[33:34] about that and preaching on the pain you
[33:35] know
[33:36] it didn't well it didn't happen you know
[33:38] well it didn't she's in west virginia
[33:40] well it didn't happen that way with me i
[33:42] just didn't feel anything during the
[33:45] during the pregnancy or during the labor
[33:47] she said it was just like a it was just
[33:49] like a little tickle and then i had the
[33:51] baby
[33:53] and my wife was sitting here soon a
[33:55] tickle
[33:59] that's it
[34:01] that's how you got out of it with just a
[34:02] tickle
[34:04] i'm serious
[34:07] but
[34:08] most people it doesn't happen that way
[34:10] it's pain suffering can you say man
[34:16] but when the baby's there
[34:18] it's all done
[34:20] and jesus said it when the baby comes
[34:23] then all of a sudden the joy that's
[34:25] there
[34:26] and he said
[34:27] that when the joy is there and the joy
[34:29] of what has come
[34:31] you don't remember any of the pain
[34:35] anymore
[34:36] i'm telling you friends we're getting
[34:38] ready to step into a dimension
[34:41] i said we're getting ready to step into
[34:43] a dimension real soon
[34:46] and there's things that you won't be
[34:47] able to remember no more
[34:53] you won't remember those bills that are
[34:55] due tomorrow you won't remember the hard
[34:58] time that you came through earlier in
[34:59] your marriage you won't remember all the
[35:02] struggles in your family you won't
[35:04] remember the people that done you wrong
[35:07] amen
[35:08] you won't remember any listen if god can
[35:11] forget it all then there's a place that
[35:13] we come that we can forget it all and
[35:15] when we step into that other dimension
[35:18] the pain the sorrow the trials our story
[35:22] we will not remember any of it
[35:25] because of the joy
[35:31] that's not a story this morning that's a
[35:33] reality for every believer sitting in
[35:35] this room we're getting ready to step
[35:38] into another dimension that you'll never
[35:40] remember in the pa any of the pain of
[35:41] life you'll never remember it
[35:46] i'll tell you how to stop the service
[35:48] and rejoice and shout say thanks be to
[35:50] god for this promise
[35:55] this is a promise that is real can you
[35:58] say amen
[35:59] and the pain
[36:00] let's pull up that quote and read what
[36:02] he says about these birth pains in the
[36:04] message birth pains he says the first
[36:06] war war showed great birth pains it
[36:09] showed one of the first birth pains of
[36:11] going into labor because of that time
[36:13] for her we had brought forth the bombs
[36:16] and we had machine guns and poison gas
[36:18] and you remember maybe many of you
[36:20] cannot i was just a little boy about
[36:22] eight years old but i remember then
[36:23] speaking of this mustard and chlorine
[36:25] gas and so forth hey just look like it
[36:27] just gets started and they said it would
[36:29] burn up the whole earth it'd kill
[36:31] everybody well it might be a breaking of
[36:33] that just winds blow across the earth
[36:35] and now everybody was scared to death of
[36:37] that great weapon of poison gas the
[36:39] earth went through had its first birth
[36:41] pains and we find out now we've had a
[36:44] second war war war and her pains was
[36:47] much greater it it was a more terrific
[36:50] all the time the birth pain of the earth
[36:51] she almost had to give way during the
[36:53] time of the atomic bomb because it would
[36:55] destroy a whole city it was much greater
[36:58] than the pains of the first world war of
[37:00] destruction to the earth now she knows
[37:03] that her time of deliverance is at hand
[37:05] that's the reason she's so nervous
[37:08] frustrated as she is is because that
[37:10] there is a hydrogen bomb and missiles of
[37:12] the air that could destroy the whole
[37:14] world one nation is scared of the other
[37:17] no matter how little it is they got
[37:19] those missiles that they can claim one
[37:21] of them they can direct them by the
[37:23] stars and drop them anywhere in the
[37:25] world they want to russia as i heard on
[37:28] the news the other day she claims that
[37:30] she can destroy our nation this nation
[37:32] and keep the atoms and the things from
[37:34] breaking up her nation we don't know
[37:36] what to do about it everybody is making
[37:38] these claims and so and it's so people's
[37:41] science has broken into god's great
[37:43] laboratory until they're going to
[37:44] destroy themselves god lets always lets
[37:47] wisdom destroy himself god doesn't
[37:50] destroy anything man destroys himself by
[37:52] wisdom as he did at the beginning taking
[37:54] satan's wisdom instead of the word now
[37:57] she knows she must give way this earth
[37:59] he's talking about she cannot stand it
[38:02] russia i believe would destroy this
[38:04] nation today if she thought that she
[38:06] could destroy it and then preserve
[38:07] herself any of those little nations
[38:09] could do it but they're afraid because
[38:11] they know that this world cannot stand
[38:14] in its orbit under such conditions the
[38:17] world knows that her birth pains is so
[38:20] great she's got to give way there's
[38:22] going to be a new birth born at hand i'm
[38:25] thankful for that i'm tired of this one
[38:28] how many are tired of this earth
[38:30] anyone knows that there's a place i'll
[38:32] tell you friends the last couple days i
[38:34] don't know what's coming we might know
[38:35] you another 10 years i don't know that
[38:37] i'm not telling you this morning but i
[38:38] begin to look at more things in
[38:40] perspective of what's coming just around
[38:42] the corner i looked at my house i looked
[38:45] at my the cars i looked at all my
[38:47] responsibilities i looked at this and
[38:49] i'm thinking monday i got to do this i
[38:51] got to do that i got to do that and i
[38:52] thought just think about it if this
[38:54] happened right now i can leave every bit
[38:56] of this and just leave it right here
[38:58] well who's going to take care of it i
[39:00] don't care who's going to take care of
[39:01] it somebody needs it during tribulation
[39:08] there's a just juvenile thoughts i guess
[39:10] but listen that's what i was thinking
[39:13] i would be ready to leave all this even
[39:15] this beautiful church
[39:17] i'm ready to move can you say amen
[39:21] leave it for somebody else
[39:25] oh but you've worked so hard no i
[39:27] haven't worked so hard for this kingdom
[39:28] this is a city that's going to end this
[39:30] is a
[39:31] here we have no continuing city
[39:35] don't get your mind on your i.r.a
[39:38] no no we're going to leave it all
[39:44] you said anyone knows here's the place
[39:46] of death and sorrow and all the kinds of
[39:48] discrepancies and so forth i'm glad
[39:50] that she has to give way and i'm glad
[39:52] that time is at hand this 1965.
[39:56] i'm glad
[39:57] is that the way you're living i'm glad
[39:59] that the time is at hand
[40:02] and john said of old even so
[40:05] come lord jesus
[40:07] there's a place where brother branson
[40:09] says when russia goes for the oil
[40:11] i've been pondering that as well and
[40:13] there are articles that in the last few
[40:15] days that clearly say in the last few
[40:17] few weeks this is this is about oil more
[40:20] than anything else it's not about oil
[40:22] because oil is about money and money is
[40:24] about who controls in the empires who
[40:27] has the most funds
[40:29] but it goes back many of the articles go
[40:31] back to the oil even though russia says
[40:33] well it's it's about this that and the
[40:35] other
[40:36] when when brother brahm says that it's
[40:38] interesting he uses oil
[40:40] like that when russia goes for the oil
[40:42] then watch then
[40:44] but
[40:46] maybe we thought of it oh they're going
[40:47] to go down and when they invaded
[40:49] afghanistan in 79 then everybody's using
[40:52] that quote which is fine when russia
[40:53] goes for the oil and we know there's
[40:55] reasons to go down there but you see now
[40:57] the last 20 30 years
[41:00] it's they've been one of the biggest
[41:02] suppliers of oil russia
[41:04] so when he says when they go for the oil
[41:06] well they're still going for the oil but
[41:08] they started bringing up oil there in
[41:10] their own country and now they've become
[41:12] a big supplier where even our country's
[41:14] a bit dependent on them
[41:17] so when they say they're going to go
[41:18] down somewhere no but when russia goes
[41:21] for the old i i hear that as saying it's
[41:23] all about the oil
[41:25] it's all about the empire it's all about
[41:27] control which goes back to money which
[41:29] goes back to the oil
[41:31] so there was great eyesight by a prophet
[41:34] that's right
[41:35] that we're still hearing articles the
[41:36] last few days about this is related to
[41:39] the oil
[41:40] 40 of europe's heating and natural gas
[41:43] is supplied by russia that's why they're
[41:45] nervous right now
[41:46] 40 of the heating and natural gas is
[41:48] supplied from russia
[41:50] but russia pays 2 billion a year for
[41:52] them to run a pipeline through ukraine
[41:55] to get to the rest of europe so now
[41:57] that's that's interrupted that's going
[41:59] to be interrupted
[42:00] and so
[42:01] ukraine joining nato or eu would change
[42:04] many things in the flow of
[42:06] oil
[42:08] and the flow of money and the flow of
[42:11] power
[42:12] and the eventual world dominance so it's
[42:14] all tied together 60 of russia's export
[42:18] is this
[42:19] so their economy and thus 40 of its
[42:21] budget so this is related to money this
[42:24] is related to oil to summarize that to
[42:26] summarize it there's a reason that a
[42:28] prophetic eye could tie oil with russia
[42:32] the way he did
[42:35] i know it's about a dictator i know it's
[42:37] about all of a sudden now a friendly
[42:40] democratic guy
[42:42] shaking hands and trying to squeeze out
[42:44] a smile in front of the cameras with
[42:46] obama and with trump
[42:49] and yet we know all along that soviet
[42:52] thing is all still laying there
[42:55] and this is the proof of it
[42:57] this friendly guy
[42:58] trying to squeak out he has a hard time
[43:01] smiling
[43:04] he's trying to just be friendly and
[43:06] democratic and all of a sudden now it
[43:09] all
[43:10] changes
[43:13] there's a reason that every time she
[43:15] goes back to her aggressive way
[43:18] that ruthless old soviet spirit instead
[43:20] of a friendly democratic there's a
[43:22] reason and every time she goes back to
[43:25] that aggressive
[43:27] nature
[43:28] the oil prices skyrocket
[43:32] every time
[43:33] fifty dollars a gallon of a barrel now
[43:36] up to 110 did the same thing when they
[43:38] invaded afghanistan in 79 every time
[43:41] just it fluctuates even our own country
[43:45] our gas prices may be going up
[43:48] probably will be already up probably
[43:49] going up some more
[43:51] so it's
[43:52] related to oil in some way
[43:56] it's who the oil
[43:58] who has the oil who has control of it
[44:00] goes back to power isn't that amazing
[44:02] that the profit ties in the natural
[44:05] that it all is summarized in oil on the
[44:08] natural side
[44:10] and isn't it amazing on the spiritual
[44:12] side there's a wise virgin and there's a
[44:15] foolish virgins
[44:17] and the difference in the two is related
[44:20] to oil
[44:26] it's related to oil
[44:29] when russia goes for the oil
[44:32] when the bride goes for the oil
[44:37] what are you willing to do to go for the
[44:38] oil
[44:40] hallelujah
[44:42] and even the foolish virgins say we
[44:45] recognize
[44:46] we've did our church we've did this
[44:48] we've done modern and we've brought rock
[44:50] and roll in the church and we've done
[44:52] everything to try to help human beings
[44:55] and yet now we're recognizing we need
[44:57] the oil
[45:01] never mind all the risks
[45:03] we're lacking the oil there might be
[45:05] people in my own church and i pray god
[45:07] recognized that they'd have her help
[45:09] them to recognize it's not about church
[45:11] administration and church problems and
[45:13] the people who hurt you at the end of
[45:15] the day all that fades away do i have
[45:17] the oil
[45:19] [Applause]
[45:21] do my children have the oil
[45:25] and i say that prayer trumps all other
[45:27] prayers god i'm gonna keep praying until
[45:30] my children have the oil
[45:34] and that's more important than your
[45:35] money it's more important if you have a
[45:37] job or lose your job that's more
[45:39] important than cohen that's more
[45:41] important than the fears of anything
[45:43] that's more important than this war
[45:44] going on can you say man
[45:47] the oil is the prominent thing
[45:50] and they said you better go and buy to
[45:52] those who are selling because we just
[45:54] have enough for ourselves
[45:56] you can't get your oil from someone else
[46:00] you can't lean on a church and go in on
[46:02] the pastor's coattail because you want
[46:03] to be friends with them
[46:05] no no no no
[46:06] you need the oil
[46:08] you need the oil
[46:10] hallelujah somebody say praise the lord
[46:13] amen somebody say praise the lord
[46:17] it's all about the oil
[46:20] so the principle is birth pains without
[46:22] pain without suffering without death the
[46:24] new cannot come on i'm going to move
[46:26] along now
[46:27] one of the favorite things in nature to
[46:29] me
[46:30] is the trees in the fall you know that i
[46:32] love the fall time
[46:34] and i didn't bring a picture with me i
[46:35] have a lot of pictures i collect them i
[46:36] found another one the other day in a in
[46:38] an office that we purchased i found a
[46:40] beautiful just a beautiful picture and
[46:42] those colors in the fall are so
[46:45] extremely
[46:46] brilliant and bright and the most
[46:48] beautiful thing you've ever seen you
[46:49] know that and i love it it just it moves
[46:52] me every time i see the smoky mountains
[46:54] that way and just see all the different
[46:55] colors brilliant so i took a picture of
[46:58] this picture and i sent it to a brother
[47:00] who's going through a kind of a hard
[47:02] time right now in the church and going
[47:04] through some suffering and starting to
[47:05] see some things in his life that he
[47:06] needs to address and die out to and i
[47:09] know he's going through a death and i
[47:10] sent that to him and i says isn't it
[47:12] amazing only in the kingdom of god that
[47:15] you can have something so beautiful
[47:17] while they're going through a death
[47:19] [Music]
[47:21] it is only in the kingdom of god
[47:23] that death becomes a beautiful thing
[47:28] beautiful is the death of his saints
[47:30] we don't want to lose our loved ones but
[47:33] in christ it's not an end can you say
[47:35] amen
[47:36] it's a beautiful thing they go on to
[47:38] their new body can you say amen only in
[47:40] the kingdom of god is death a beautiful
[47:42] thing
[47:44] and i was encouraging the brother that
[47:46] you keep dying out to yourself you keep
[47:48] doing that
[47:49] the beauty of god is showing in your
[47:51] life
[47:52] praise the lord
[47:54] hallelujah
[47:56] amen so
[47:57] you know
[47:59] the lily was one of the prophet's
[48:00] favorite flowers and he comments in
[48:03] birth pains the lily says but look at
[48:05] what that lily that pond lily he says i
[48:08] love that flower it comes up the lily
[48:10] said and considered how it grows and
[48:12] toils has to bring itself up this little
[48:15] pond lily look where it comes from
[48:16] through dirt muck
[48:19] mud muddy waters dirty waters
[48:22] it pressed its way through all of that
[48:24] this little germ of life working itself
[48:26] from the bottom of the pond
[48:29] where the frogs and the things are at
[48:31] and then brings itself up through all of
[48:33] that but when it gets in the presence of
[48:35] the sun it's born
[48:38] the little seed bursts open into new
[48:40] life it cannot do that until it goes
[48:42] through all of that process it's got to
[48:44] come through that that's what it makes
[48:46] it is because what that the sun itself
[48:49] is what's drawing out drawing it and
[48:51] when it gets just remember that when
[48:53] you're coming through all the muck and
[48:55] the mire and just remember that you're
[48:58] only coming up and pushing through it
[48:59] because the sun is drawing you out
[49:04] god has been in your life
[49:08] god has been drawing you
[49:10] you didn't fix yourself
[49:14] god washed you from a baby can you say
[49:16] amen
[49:17] and the sun has been shining even when
[49:20] you were in the mud
[49:22] gideon didn't know what i was preaching
[49:23] on this morning but he saying he brought
[49:26] me out of the miry clay
[49:29] repeat of god he set my feet on a rock
[49:32] to stay
[49:36] my heart was distressed
[49:38] pain sorrow but he the sun was shining
[49:41] and you're drawing out of these things
[49:43] you're going to come out of it all it's
[49:45] got to come through the water that's
[49:46] what makes it because the sun itself is
[49:47] what's drawing it and when it gets fully
[49:49] above all the dirty waters and muck and
[49:51] so forth then it's so happy
[49:54] it just gives its life out freely and
[49:57] it's a beautiful life when it gets in
[49:59] the presence of that which is drawing it
[50:02] up
[50:03] some of you haven't hit there don't try
[50:05] to mechanically in your mind figure out
[50:07] who's who just put your life before the
[50:09] lord i wonder who brother paul is
[50:11] talking about i don't know who has the
[50:12] holy ghost who doesn't
[50:14] all i know if you keep yourself in the
[50:16] presence of the lord and you die to
[50:18] yourself
[50:19] he's going to give you everything that
[50:20] you need
[50:22] but i know in our assembly some are
[50:24] coming up through the mud you're coming
[50:25] up through praying some are learning
[50:27] that these things of life is not what
[50:28] you want to latch on to some young
[50:31] people are learning that it's not about
[50:32] a guy or girl it's about christ first
[50:35] and i'm going to keep loving you and i'm
[50:37] going to keep preaching to you and i'm
[50:38] going to keep teaching you and training
[50:40] you and pointing you to the word of god
[50:42] i'm not giving up on you but all of us
[50:44] are in different stages coming out of
[50:46] the muck in the mud if you keep growing
[50:48] you're going to come out and shine with
[50:50] the beauty of jesus christ
[50:52] i don't care what family situation
[50:54] you're in brother sister you're coming
[50:57] out of it can you say man
[51:01] you're coming out
[51:03] this word is a lot more powerful than
[51:05] paula fontaine could ever produce
[51:07] any kind of psychology or any kind of
[51:10] thing this word
[51:12] is going to bring you out
[51:14] hallelujah i think that's a beautiful
[51:16] type of the christian life when
[51:19] something is drawing you out of the
[51:20] world until one day you're born right
[51:23] into his presence
[51:25] by the holy spirit
[51:27] how
[51:28] beautiful
[51:30] how beautiful
[51:32] is that
[51:36] god's kingdom has pain and suffering
[51:39] that you go through
[51:40] until you get to a new life
[51:43] this world is under possibly its third
[51:45] birth pain it can't suffer another birth
[51:48] pain there's only going to be three
[51:51] this would be the final one
[51:53] and it's related to bombs this morning
[51:55] young people everybody listening this
[51:57] morning putin issues this might become
[51:59] atomic now
[52:01] he's never said that this morning he's
[52:03] getting angry
[52:05] this becomes atomic
[52:08] it could be the end of the ball game
[52:10] once you get that started it doesn't
[52:12] seem to be any into it
[52:15] i never preach these things to scare you
[52:19] but young people i do preach them and
[52:21] anyone that if your not heart is not
[52:24] anchored in the holy spirit all you need
[52:27] to do is find an altar this morning
[52:30] you see there's there's a there's a
[52:32] conviction and there's a fear i'm not
[52:33] scaring you hanging over hell but i'm
[52:35] telling you if this is the time don't
[52:38] wait
[52:40] don't wait to another sunday and just
[52:42] nod and walk out of here
[52:43] that's the thing we need friends you
[52:44] know you can become polished and you can
[52:46] have a nice church and
[52:48] you you know when when when he talked
[52:50] about the lily jesus said
[52:53] the lily a raid in all of its beauty
[52:56] see how it toils and brother brahm
[52:58] talked about so and so jesus talks about
[53:01] that literally he says
[53:02] he says but there's not one array that's
[53:04] beautiful even in the kingdom of solomon
[53:07] he compares it to the kingdom of solomon
[53:09] all the glory of his kingdom and he says
[53:11] the lily the psalmist king doesn't touch
[53:14] the beauty of this lily
[53:16] why because it's natural
[53:18] it pushed its way through
[53:21] god did it
[53:22] solomon basically was handed the king
[53:24] i'm not saying god didn't put him there
[53:25] but he was handed the kingdom he's kind
[53:27] of like the next generation he didn't
[53:29] have to fight for so much for it it was
[53:31] just handed to him
[53:33] that's the thing when you become with
[53:34] manufactured churches and manufacture
[53:36] things and the music becomes polished i
[53:38] believe we are doing our best but let me
[53:40] tell our musicians keep striving play
[53:43] skillfully but any of us whatever
[53:45] position you have whatever this church
[53:47] but there's one thing this pastor
[53:48] doesn't want that we've become so
[53:50] manufactured and so polished that we
[53:53] lose repentance
[53:55] conviction
[53:57] the moving of the holy ghost let your
[53:59] songs be anointed by the holy ghost let
[54:01] your hearts play that instrument such
[54:03] anointing it draws the presence of god
[54:06] we're not here to become another polish
[54:07] church and make sure everything's just
[54:09] perfect we're here that if we don't have
[54:11] repentance and you say well i already
[54:13] repented 20 years ago when i gave my
[54:15] heart to the lord hasn't somebody told
[54:17] you that we have to repent all the time
[54:20] we need an altar almost daily in our
[54:22] lives
[54:24] so don't you dare come here every sunday
[54:26] and just nod and say i'm okay the truth
[54:29] is we're not okay can you say man we
[54:32] always need more of god we always need
[54:34] more correction and the only way to
[54:36] change that is to repent we need
[54:38] repentance
[54:40] repentance brings the new millennium can
[54:42] you say amen this is not going to be a
[54:44] millennium brother brown says florida
[54:45] they're trying to create a millennium as
[54:47] a counterfeit to gods but this
[54:49] millennium will because there's people
[54:51] that repents and dies out to themselves
[54:55] none of us want a millennium without
[54:56] repentance
[54:58] you don't want a home you don't want
[54:59] possessions you don't want a business
[55:01] you don't want a big truck without
[55:03] repentance in your life
[55:05] it's a phony artificial life it isn't
[55:08] life at all it's empty without god in
[55:10] your life it's emptiness it means
[55:13] nothing
[55:14] i got a really nice truck but it means
[55:16] absolutely nothing this morning to me
[55:20] and i mean that
[55:23] praise the lord
[55:24] i parked it out front here way out front
[55:27] and tom i come in tom says are you
[55:29] abandoning that vehicle
[55:32] because tom would steal it if it was
[55:34] abandoned
[55:35] nothing
[55:36] if we don't have repentance so if we
[55:37] don't have altar
[55:39] if we
[55:40] then i don't want the young people or
[55:41] anyone to just leave and say i'm okay
[55:45] if god
[55:47] speaks to your heart and corrects
[55:49] something
[55:50] then just just set brother paul aside
[55:54] so i'm going to take that as from the
[55:55] lord and the next step say god
[55:58] i cry out to you
[56:01] please burn the things of the world out
[56:03] of my life
[56:05] take me lord
[56:07] this is almost wrapped up this is almost
[56:09] over
[56:10] you might not have another sunday to
[56:11] repent
[56:13] who are we to assume that
[56:16] we need
[56:18] an atmosphere
[56:19] of repentance
[56:21] that's when we have a millennium coming
[56:26] praise the lord god is good amen
[56:30] the lily
[56:32] solomon arrayed in all of his glory was
[56:34] not like one of these
[56:36] if we feel the pain of conviction
[56:39] sorrow repentance
[56:41] then i believe that there were the
[56:43] church that god can work with
[56:49] praise the lord
[56:53] the world is going through its final
[56:55] birth pains
[56:57] many believe that
[57:00] this may be the final birth pain
[57:04] on a daily basis we look and see those
[57:06] things
[57:08] the world is in its final birth pains
[57:11] the church goes through birth pains
[57:13] brother bram says when a new message was
[57:15] coming
[57:17] luther went through pains to bring the
[57:19] message and then wesley and then
[57:21] pentecost every time the church went
[57:23] through birth pains to bring forth new
[57:25] life
[57:27] and if you realize that the pain of
[57:29] dying out to your own desires because
[57:31] see the birth pains is in you
[57:33] individually too
[57:36] through pain
[57:37] through suffering
[57:40] through
[57:42] things that take us
[57:44] things we don't understand things that
[57:45] are
[57:46] hurtful to us things that where we
[57:48] suffer
[57:51] if we realize that the pain of dining
[57:53] out to our own desires and truly
[57:54] repenting and saying lord i'm done
[57:57] when we come to that it's going to bring
[57:59] forth god's life within us
[58:02] and that's when we say
[58:04] every bit of pain was worth it
[58:08] maybe it's embarrassment i'm embarrassed
[58:10] that the lord has exposed this in my
[58:11] life
[58:13] you'll get at the end of it say it was
[58:14] worse it was worth all the embarrassment
[58:18] people talked people said things
[58:20] other times we don't want people to know
[58:21] things and we try to
[58:23] and that's fine that's fine none of us
[58:25] like to be embarrassed but one day
[58:27] you're going to say this was worth all
[58:28] the embarrassment
[58:31] whatever man could say whatever man can
[58:33] do if it brings the end result it's
[58:35] worth all the pain
[58:37] worth all the trouble
[58:40] worth all the trials
[58:43] it will be worth it all
[58:45] when we see jesus
[58:50] he for the joy is on that cross
[58:53] enduring the pain
[58:55] taking a crown of thorns into his head
[58:58] pierced in the side
[59:01] spikes through his feet spikes through
[59:03] both hands
[59:06] suffering how did he do it
[59:08] he for the joy
[59:10] that was set before him
[59:12] he looked ahead in time
[59:17] he knew me yet he loved me
[59:20] he whose glory made the heavens shine so
[59:23] unworthy of seth's mercy
[59:26] when he was on the cross
[59:28] brother zimmerman i was on his mind you
[59:32] were on his mind
[59:36] get to a place we cross into that
[59:37] dimension and we'll
[59:39] we'll know it's
[59:41] every pain was worth it
[59:44] my story wasn't one that i would have
[59:47] picked
[59:48] wish i had a different one
[59:50] but god's predestinated trials
[59:53] led me
[59:54] to a greater joy
[59:57] this all ends very well saints i'm going
[59:59] to close this but i could go back into
[1:00:01] the text that says what manner of people
[1:00:04] should we be right now
[1:00:06] seeing all these things shall be
[1:00:09] dissolved
[1:00:10] things
[1:00:14] i like to me i like when the bible says
[1:00:16] things because it pretty much covers
[1:00:18] everything
[1:00:21] so you need to approach tomorrow morning
[1:00:24] in a real repentant heart in a soft
[1:00:26] heart before god but you need to have
[1:00:28] this approach
[1:00:30] seeing all these things
[1:00:33] the nice chairs the equipment the new
[1:00:35] piano the truck outside the home
[1:00:38] all these things shall be dissolved
[1:00:42] it'll be done it'll be gone
[1:00:45] it's all gonna burn
[1:00:50] brother donnie said one time said why
[1:00:51] would you want to make all that money
[1:00:52] and it eventually ends up in the hands
[1:00:54] of the catholic church anyway
[1:00:58] i think that was good why are you
[1:01:00] working so hard and they're going to get
[1:01:01] it all anyway
[1:01:03] the truth is when that's over
[1:01:05] all these things shall be dissolved
[1:01:08] so if we have that perspective looking
[1:01:09] for and hastening unto the new heavens
[1:01:12] and the new earth
[1:01:13] what manner of people are we to be in
[1:01:16] all holy conversation and manner of life
[1:01:18] i told the young people friday night i
[1:01:19] read the same scripture is that we don't
[1:01:21] need to have more unholiness and
[1:01:23] dirtiness in our life we need to be
[1:01:25] striving to say lord sanctify me
[1:01:29] we criticize and talk about holiness and
[1:01:31] standards and and dress and all that
[1:01:33] just quit quit complicating and just say
[1:01:35] lord make me holy before you make me
[1:01:38] separated in my mind in my spirit and in
[1:01:41] my dress let me manifest holiness
[1:01:44] why not to have an argument with you
[1:01:46] over what's appropriate no no because
[1:01:48] the coming of the lord is near
[1:01:51] it's not time to argue about that stuff
[1:01:52] it's time to be holy before the lord
[1:01:55] consecrated before the lord
[1:01:57] do we have time to debate about all
[1:01:59] these quotes no we have time to get in
[1:02:02] the filled with the holy ghost repented
[1:02:04] hearts created an atmosphere for the
[1:02:07] last elected seed to come in and our
[1:02:09] children to be saved that's the priority
[1:02:12] here can you say about it
[1:02:14] let me be ready for the coming of the
[1:02:15] lord
[1:02:16] what matter of person should we be in
[1:02:18] all holiness conversation and all
[1:02:21] these things looking to and hastening
[1:02:23] unto seeing all these things looking for
[1:02:25] it hazing under the coming of the day of
[1:02:27] god wherein the heavens being on fire
[1:02:29] shall be dissolved and the elements
[1:02:30] shall melt with fervent heat i like the
[1:02:32] next one nevertheless we
[1:02:34] according to the promise that's the
[1:02:36] difference in us and the scoffers we
[1:02:39] according to the promise we're not
[1:02:40] trying to fix things we're not trying to
[1:02:42] ward it off we're not trying to come up
[1:02:43] with things to keep it from happening
[1:02:45] we're looking at the promise we're
[1:02:46] looking for a new heavens and a new
[1:02:48] earth we're in dwelleth righteousness if
[1:02:50] you're not looking for that you need to
[1:02:51] say lord correct me this morning
[1:02:54] you need his head i'm looking for one
[1:02:56] thing a new heavens and a new earth
