Jeremiah chapter 50 verse 22 and we're going to read to 25. the scripture reads a son of battle is in the land and of great destruction how is the Hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken how has Babylon become a desolation among the Nations I have laid a snare for thee and thou art also taken o Babylon and thou has not and thou was not aware that are found and also caught because thou is driven against the Lord the Lord hath opened his Armory and hath brought forth the weapons of his ignition for this is the work of the Lord God of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans who by our heads were to prayer most gracious kind Heavenly Father Lord I Thank you Lord for this congregation a group of people that are wanting to serve the Lord and Lord we sing songs we've given testimonies we had a great a great weekend with the kids Lord to further your gospel in their hearts but Lord as our Prophet taught us we now come to the most important part of a service Lord and we ask you now dear Jesus by thy anointing speak to our hearts o God we don't come to be seen we come to be come to hearing from you oh God and so we ask you dear Jesus anoint our ears anoint the speaker Lord just anoint the whole service so that thy presence would be knowns amongst us your Supernatural can have a hook in our hearts and in our lives we're trusting you and believe again now in the name of thy son our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ the bride said together amen God bless you may be seated laughs and um I'm going to preach the message called the Lord hath opened his Armory the Lord hath opened his Armory now sometimes people especially in the world and sometimes us can get the wrong image of God sometimes as brother Graham said that um uh a lot of people treat God as like a doting old grandpa up there and you can just sit on his lap and just ask him this thing and ask him that thing and he's just like a doting old grandpa over you and things like that amen but God's that's not God's character amen but it says in Exodus uh chapter 15 that the God is a man of war that God is not here to compromise with the Enemy God is not here just to settle things out a lot of times I hope you're hearing me this is not God's attitude towards situations and trials it's not just to sit on the sideline and just let bygones be bygones no the Lord is a man of war amen matter of fact in Exodus chapter 17 this is one of of Jehovah's Redemptive names in Exodus 17 verse 15 and Moses built an altar and called the name of it Jehovah Nissi for he said because which means the Lord is my banner and he said for he said because the Lord has sworn that the Lord will have war with the Malik from generation to generation amen see what does this mean God don't compromise God always has War amen when God went to war with sin he went to war to abolish it not just to live with it not just let it do what it wants sometimes and then you go oh well you know one or two times ain't that big of a deal no from generation to generation the Lord was going to have War amen he's a man of war amen and so are his children amen watch brother bam said that first quote I sent you brother it's in Revelations chapter 5 and 61. now Satan will constantly punch at you until you're finished here on Earth I know you want to break sometimes don't you know it's not that's not what happens watch he says it right here just remember that you'll never have a time but what there's a punching going on all the time because you're in a battle did you ask to come to Christ to go to a picnic well you're sure going to be surprised ain't that the truth I know some of you are surprised weren't you you come to Christ and you thought oh everything's gonna be great and it's going to be easy and then also in the battle show up didn't it do you know why the battle showed up is because the Lord will have war against sin we don't compromise with sin the world lets it Go the world says why not let them do that why not let these things happen oh they're just laughing look at that Spirit of homosexuality amen they just oh they just love no God will have war against that spirit that's why it becomes harder for you the Lord will have War you don't come to Christ to go on the picnic you're sure to decide because it's a constant battle he said I've been on the field for 31 years and had a fight for every inch amen but you remember this this isn't our war this is the Lord's War amen God started this fight you remember the Book of Job amen when job was living a good life and things like that safety came up and said and job picked the fight or I'm sorry God picked the fight Zayn was walking around one day and God said hey satan hey have you considered job I wanted to happen to one of you one of these times hey have you considered job look at this man he's fear of God and look what he's doing pretty good God Satan said oh you just put a hedge bottom of course he is like that God said all right go ahead Satan never brought job up God did oh why am I going through this struggle why is it so bad for Me Maybe god mentioned you glory to God hallelujah see God's gonna have war against sin God's gonna have War and because he has War he's gonna have some weapons don't he needs the weapons to fight in this war amen uh in Isaiah 13 Verse 1 watch this scripture here in Isaiah 13 Verse 1 the bourbon of Babylon which Isaiah the son of Amos did see lifting up a banner upon the high mountain exalt The Voice unto them shake the hand that they may go into the gates of the Nobles I have commanded my Sanctified ones who got any Sanctified ones in here so he's commanding you to do something I commanded him my sake to fight once I have also called my my mighty ones for my anger amen God's upset about something and he needs to deal with it and so he opened his Armory and he's getting some weapons out and what are those weapons his Sanctified ones let's set the cat out of the bag hello how does it feel to be one of God's weapons of ignation he's going to have one worth of Malik and he needs some weapons and he pulled you out of the Armory glory to God in Hallelujah oh my Jeremiah 51 watch this Jeremiah 51 verse 19 the portion of Jacob is not victim for he is the former of all things and Israel is the rod of his inheritance the Lord of hosts is his name Thou Art my battle Acts and weapons of war you see you thought I was making it up maybe just a little bit amen but God called you a battle ax see you're more important in this fight than you think sometimes hey man there's no Little People in God I I tell you what sometimes we get this idea of of we got high people up here low people up here listen we're all in Christ together do you know that's why you do foot washing we know God gave us three ordinances right first one is water baptism what does that do it gives a Christian a date something they do to be born again right it's not the actual cleaning but it gives a Christian something to hold on to that they can look back and say I did do the word and that's two amen I did do it amen so that's why God gave it to us amen then we have communion what is communion to do it's to remind us of why we're going to make it glory to God why are we going to make it not because we were better than the church down the road but by the body and blood of Jesus who is broken for us that's what's going to get us through and God knew as humans we would go on being a Christian we forget so he brought you the Lord's Supper to remind you that you're only going to make it because of the body and blood of the Lord Jesus Christ so aren't you glad he did it too because we would have that's why God gave us the Lord's Supper so then why did God give you foot washes why did God give you foot washing he tells us why remember Peter when Peter's asked to do the foot washing Jesus said wash my feet he said Laura or no Jesus said let me wash your feet Peter said you ain't gonna wash my feet Lord You're the Lord Jesus see if you don't let me watch your feet you have no part with me and Peter said not only my feet and God my head and my shoulders do it all then and he said if I your order Master washed your feet so ought to wash one another's feet what is it to remind you of there is no big people or Little People in God We're All in This Together you all got a part to play amen don't devalue your part god did it glory to God God didn't devalue your part amen we're all important this together amen boy I tell you what if if none of you are playing your part this morning this sermon be pretty boring I didn't be preaching the walls who wants to do that hey man see we all got a park to play glory to God you know sometimes even God use your worship to play a part you know what I mean sometimes you can praise the Lord remember at one time Paul and Silas who were in prison pray the Lord so hard brother bam said about the first Jailhouse Rock split the prison and set them free oh well we're all over the place anyway we're going amen you know sometimes you think sometimes your service is a waste of time it's never a waste of time there has never been something you've done for God that's been a waste of time never not one thing you have never been a bother you have never been a waste of space you are a weapon in the hand of God and one time Paul and Silas were in a jail amen why God knew see there oh God knows it better than us sometimes amen God knew there was a Philippian Jailer there God knew about him so of course God brought him a trial to Paul and Silas remember they were just doing the work of the Lord and they ended up in jail but they had to be there because there was a man who needed to hear the word and they were a weapon in the hand of God that despite being in a jail in circumstances at one time he said a Christian Masters all circumstances not that he controls every circumstance in his life but the circumstances don't control him that's the difference Paul and Silas were surrounded by circumstances that night in the jail they were just trying to do the work of the Lord preaching the gospel and they ended up in jail but they didn't allow the circumstance to control them and they became a weapon in the hand of God because that night they probably started singing that night Gideon amen they heard some songs saying you know thank God I am free free free remember that Philippian Jailer heard him all night the Bible says they heard them singing and that Philippine jail heard him well what in the world what Maybe started saying once like a bird in prison I dwell no freedom from this sorrow I felt then Jesus came and listened to me glory to God he set me free that Philippians set him free they're in jail right now what do you mean they're going to be free ah God knows how to do it amen it wasn't that they controlled the circumstance they didn't let the circumstance control them and because of their right attitude God is able to use them and and with the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God it will bring you to pass they were looking to save souls and God put them in the right spot to save a soul because God sent a Jailhouse Rock through there slit the jail no wonder that Philippian Jailer believed they were singing praising the God Amen that's settle free and then they became free amen and he was about to kill himself why because he was going to do it before the Roman boss did it since they let some prisoners go he was going to die in their place but then Paul said well we're still here we're still here no wonder he believed Stephen why do I gotta go through this hard trial what is gonna be so bad for me maybe there's a Philippian Jailer in the easy to hear the word could God use that to save somebody else see God is going to have war against sin against this world sin not against people against the sin amen and who did he call to fight it amen the Lord will have War with a Malik so the Lord opened his Armory in that situation the Lord opened it he got a Philippian Jailer so the Lord opened his army and he took out a pollen to Silas that day amen one time the children of Israel amen we're stuck in Egypt they need to be saved God made a promise to them of a promised land to Abraham Isaac and Jacob but they were Bound in circumstances in Egypt there arose a pharaoh that knew not Joseph and so they became stuck in that situation and so God had to open his Armory and God said I'm going to free my people and he opened an Armory and he got out of Moses amen and he took a Moses amen now listen sometimes God's going to do things in a weird way sometimes you think when Moses was 40 years old he mo God had her he had Moses in the in the Kingdom God God already put Moses in the pharaoh's house you think this would be the time to deliver up matter of fact see I think Moses is about a rapper when he took that out that Egyptian you know in a human sense it made sense for him to do what he did he was a prince of Egypt at the time he was in line to take over so he was the boss at the time and so he took out one Egyptian but do you know why God couldn't do it that way amen because it wasn't Moses's fight it was the Lord's fight and then Moses would have done it it would have been Moses amen so God had to make sure everybody knew that the Lord was in this war so he said you know what we gotta wait another 40 years we're going to wait for the day that nobody could think you could do it glory to God wait until he was 80 years old amen Bend him in a burning bush gave him a Crooked Stick and said go take over all he gave him brother Ben told us what that stick represented he said it was the name of Jesus Christ amen look weird to the world but that stick turned water into blood that stick took out an entire nation amen amen that name is more powerful than you give a credit sometimes I know you say it in church I know you say it in church amen I'm not talking about here though I'm talking about when you're in the land of Egypt and you're gonna need the name of Jesus can I say it like this it ain't called thinking word it's called spoken word [Applause] sometimes you need to pipe up and say it amen Oprah but Stephen I don't know no I believe it then ask God to help your unbelief and say it anyways you know what the Bible says the Bible says my thoughts are higher than your thoughts my ways are higher than your ways I tell you what sometimes we get too much brother Paul we get too much trouble doing it our way your way can never be better than God's ooh preach it brother Stephen I think I will amen your way is never going to be better than God God knows more about it than you you just need to yield and belief this is not your War amen you are a part of it but you didn't start it do you see what I'm saying the Lord is in this war and you're the weapon God uses to take it out to fight on that side of the war amen that's why brother Bynum said the best thing you can do is yield yourself unto him amen listen I know we say it but what does it look like when we actually yield ourselves oh now we're going to preach a little bit I hope you don't mind amen what does it look like when you yield when we say ah you know I surrender all oh we love singing that song it's a great song don't get me wrong but what does it look like when we surrender what would it look like you know I've said it like this before I said you know if the Lord called me to eat Taco Bell every day of my life I'll be like well the Lord said so and I'd be right there get my Taco Bell every day see that wouldn't hurt me that's something I would be willing to do but what if God asks you to do something you're not willing to do what does it mean when we say we surrender all can you surrender something you don't want to see surrendering to God is not measured by the things you're willing to do but by the things you're willing not to do amen when you're really wanting to serve God be closer to God what does that mean surrender all amen yielding to him see I see what I'm saying when we say you know oh yeah the greatest gift is the yield unto God sometimes that's not easy to do and can I say it like this a lot of the times it's not easy to do to yield unto God when you're supposed to witness to somebody when you're supposed to say something and you stop yourself were you yielding can I give you some advice real quick amen you can't scare people into hell too there's no such thing as hell too there's only there's only the bad way amen you can't make their situation any worse than what it already is you're not going to be liked by everybody well here we are you're not going to be liked by everybody the Bible says Christ is a rock of offense people can get upset people are gonna get mad at you sometimes but are you willing to fight in the war regardless listen God is a man of war he does not compromise people are going to look at you as if you're being mean listen can I say like this just because somebody says something don't mean it's true one time I walked into the uh I used to work at elevator when I was a young Christian I walked in there and they said Oh look The Holy Roller is here and I said thanks I like that hurt my feelings one bit why because I know I know what I am I've been calling a brain a night many many times I've been called a brain of my oh you just follow a man but they can say whatever they want doesn't mean I do you see what I'm saying just because a Critic says something doesn't mean you actually are that quit giving them so much power amen listen to what God Said Amen they're not going to make it to heaven for you oh that was so good and hallelujah amen they're not gonna make it heaven for you only God's gonna take you home so make sure God said you're going to make it that's even more important amen well I you know as someone one time are you going to heaven or hell you say I got a 50 50 shot don't I I said boy I'm glad I don't serve your God only give me a 50 chance if God would call a Rapture in three minutes from now would you go would you go see every time I do that there's always that hesitation I feel I always feel that well would I well you should know the answer now it should be so settled in your heart you do get a little big-headed about it sometimes what do you mean a Rapture of course you're I'm going to make it a Rapture the rapture's for me of course I'm gonna be there I'm a Christian God say my soul when he died on the cross we sing that song when he died on the cross you and I was on his mind amen so who is he thinking of he was thinking of me the Bible says he endured the cross despise the shame for the joy set before his heart amen who is the joy what was the joy it wasn't cars it was the houses who was the joy it was literal lifetime literal Life Church right here up here in Michigan right now amen he died for me he died for me it does sound a little big-headed but that's exactly what the scripture says you're not saying anything contrary that's what the Bible said and by Revelation Glory when you look at the word of God and it says the Joy by Revelation you say that's me amen what did Paul say he said we shout out our sleep but we shall be changed well he's got a mouse in his pocket who's the we the reason why Paul had to say we is because I exist and I'm gonna be there in the rapture get it settled in your heart don't make it against the game don't hope about it don't don't think it's gonna you have a chance I'll think it's like a lottery oh that was ooh don't think Heaven's like a lottery don't think the reference like gonna be a lotto that you're just rolling the dice and hoping you make it be assured that he who promised it will bring it to pass get persuaded I'm gonna tell you something I don't know what it is this morning amen make sure you're persuaded today I wouldn't even wait to the end of my sermon amen get persuaded right now if God would have the Rapture at the end of this service I'd be gone and have it so settled in your heart have it so settled in your heart that not even you can take yourself out of it when Noah was put into the ark and the doors closed he was in there for seven days even if he wanted to leave he couldn't that's how sold out you need to be whether you're going to make it or not get get it in your heart you're not hurting God's feelings being assured the Bible says try the spirits whether it be of God or not the Bible says prove all things not just some of them all of them that includes whether you're part of First Corinthians 15 or not amen we which are alive and remain shall not hinder them which are sleep in Christ who's not going to hinder them I am not going to hinder them me I'm not in the way I'm going to make it oh I don't know what it is this morning amen but I think we need to be reminded why we're coming to church to begin with why do we have kids days why do we do these for our kids why do we come to church and hear a preacher spin around all day it's God's provided way for you to make it to heaven I know people sometimes don't like hearing that but you're going to hear it anyways because it's Bible God gave you a promise in Ephesians 4 by the foolishness of preaching God will save them believe you have a five-fold Ministry given to you to bring you into the Perfection of the Statue of a perfect man and you cannot do it any other way but by the fast forward God's provided way amen so you're not going to make it without a preacher amen it's God's provided way that why you come here we don't come here for a social Gathering we don't come here just to hang out is it okay for social Gatherings of course it is I'd rather hang out with you guys than at the bars okay I think that's kind of a given amen right even if I was in the world you guys would still be nicer than them I've been in the bars don't you ever go either hear me young people you don't want my kind of a testimony okay but listen I've been to the places they're they're all bad anyways a bunch of depressing spirits and everything like that you're still better than what they have to offer amen we do not so it's okay to hang out with each other amen it's okay for social gatherings but when we come in the house of God it is to get closer to God to prepare us according to the word of God remember we have preachers not because we thought it was better the church didn't come up with it when Paul set the church in order he set up a five-fold Ministry through God now God set it up but God used Paul as the instrument to set it up how you're going to make it and you need them you need them and guess what I don't know if you know this or not they need you we need each other listen you're not going to have a special this church ain't going to have their own Rapture and then my church is going to have their rapture We're All in This Together aren't we we all got a part to play the Bible says there's a diversity of gifts and many operations there's multiple things there's multiple ways to act and things like that we all have our part to play make sure you're willing to Play Your Part oh brother Stephen I don't know what my part is well I don't know I'd ask the guy who decided it you know what I mean why don't you go ask God what you're supposed to be doing amen why don't you asked God brother Brown said there's one thing we should ask more than anything that's revelation you need a purpose you know they've proven that many times many times that people who don't have purpose they just die off they have no goal they have no Direction God is here to give you Direction and purpose today amen you're not useless wow well praise the Lord you are not useless what you did this weekend was not useless even if it's one little small thing it is not useless you are important and you are vital to the body of Christ Paul even talks about it in First Corinthians 12 about the body he said you know body parts that are more vital you don't necessarily see do you but body parts that seem to have no use like your hair for instance what's my hair actually doing for me well think about it physically do I really need it I know we have some brothers who can say you don't really need it do you don't mean to bring it up I know it's a hard thing brother I know it's a hard thing to bring up okay so you forgive me for that okay but you know if I came in with just my hair just all messed up and everything like what's wrong with that guy up there that guy's preaching in that goofy looking hair I'd be like what are you talking about my hair does nothing anyways who cares it just does actually nothing for me so why would I need to take care of it and yet we all woke up took a shower and combed our hair didn't we everybody took care of their hair even some of you sisters braid it make it look a little prettier and things like that sometimes you put it in a bun sometimes you lay it out why because it looks pretty yeah there's actually no use for it at all see that's how God set up the body can I say something like this let me type into preaching you know me and brother Paul and other preachers you know when Paul's supposed to preach as a pastor he's supposed to show up I mean he's the pastor right Paul's the pastor so Paul's going to show up to church I mean he's the pastor nobody's shocked that he showed up he's the pastor but you take somebody with like one of you who who maybe you just sit there and pull on the word of God and just listen but you show up Sunday Wednesday Sunday Wednesday you might even have a bad day and you still show up maybe you had a long day of work and you're still Somehow Here you show up like that like that oh it may not look useful but you got a grand more testimony than us preachers we're supposed to show up and yet somehow you're still here pulling on the word you are not unimportant God thinks remember God even hears those small prayers God even hears those small prayers you have sometimes this sermon is throwing in a bunch of rabbit Trails so you forgive me for this amen you know build a brand one time amen Went to went to fish and I'm gonna butcher up the testimony so you forgive me but he went fishing with those book boys amen and Bank Woods that's it is Woods the woods boys and so forth they went fishing he caught that one little small fish remember he had the vision in the beginning there's going to be a resurrection of life and there's a little fish swim that's flown in the the water and just stood there for hours just dead all the innards was took out he wanted to say you shot your last wad you know what I mean and all of a sudden God anointed brother Banner amen it's a little fishy I give your life back in the name of Jesus swam off and brother Graham said I got people who are dying of cancer I got manual letters of people going through way way bad things and yet God used his power to raise that fish why did God do it but the man tells us why God did it is to tell us he's even concerned about the small things he did it for you he did it for us in this day right now in this service the reason why God did it is because this preacher was going to say it to you this morning and remind you even the small things that you're worried about God is still listening to you God has not forgotten about it God has not forsaken you on it God even hears the small things that you're worried about that's why God did it back then was for you this morning aren't you thankful for that aren't you thankful he is worried about those small things the things you don't think are a big deal oh I shouldn't waste God's time with it I don't know why we think of it like that sometimes God is not like the president of the United States he wants to have a relationship with you I say we get rid of that fear get rid of the the the depression and anxiety throw it out the door you ain't got time to waste being depressed listen listen I know I it's a real thing don't get me wrong depression anxiety it is a real thing but do you understand as Christians it makes no sense why you are do you understand that it doesn't make any sense why you're depressed this is God's War not yours what do you got to fear what do you got to be scared of God this is God's War he started it hey man so how can you lose if it's God's if God's on your side who can stand against you can anything stand against you so yes it is a real Spirit but it makes no sense why you're doing it if you really believe God so stop believing in yourself when when Jesus cursed the fig tree he said he said I curse you you're gonna bear no more fruit they came back Peter said look this tree look how fast it was cursed what did Jesus say Jesus didn't say okay memorize chapter you know Psalms 150. memorize this certain book what do you say have faith ain't God he did not say Have Faith In Yourself can I say like this if you're looking as being a Christian through you of course you're messing up and you're sitting here right now probably thinking it's so hard to live a Christian Life well of course you're thinking that you're trying to pick it up yourself of course it looks like that if you just let go and let God stop having so much faith in yourself have faith in God 's gonna do it this is the Lord's War amen amen you know what that's a good segue because I want to talk about a little story here remember the title was the Lord hath opened his Armory amen I hope you don't mind going on a rabbit Trail sometimes amen I sure hope you're hearing what the word is saying though amen amen remember the church feeds off inspiration we make it because of inspiration because God breathes the word amen that's what we're listening for amen one time the Philistines showed up against Israel amen and the Bible says the Philistine Army ended up on one mountain and so Saul and his army went onto another Mountain so the Bible says they were both on two mountains there was a valley in between them that's how the devil likes to come sometimes don't he never comes when you're on the Mountaintop does he when everything's going good he don't show up then does he it's when you're in the valley he starts showing up then don't he amen that's when the real fight's going to start the fight is never going to start when you're all happy and everything's good you hear me Church that's why a lot of times the battle doesn't really start in this service we're all surrounded by Christians we have a great atmosphere we're on a Mountaintop we're in church a lot of times that's where the battle is not going to start though it's going to start out there in the world let's go start on your job when you're in the valley and it's time to fight that's when you got to start fighting then and they were on both of the mountaintops and so forth and all of a sudden in a big old man showed up now you say brother Stephen you're a pretty big guy well I know that don't get me wrong but this guy was even bigger than me the guy and I know you all know the story but we're doing it anyways it was kids days right I think it's okay to go over some of these old Bible stories sometimes amen remember this the Bible says when the kids came up to Jesus the fair the disciples tried to shoot them away no bring him on in for such is the kingdom of God sometimes that was us adults need to remember to go back down to being a kid again sometimes amen a man named Goliath showed up do you know how tall he was he was over nine foot tall nine foot nine inches I mean that's taller than this he's still taller than me this man was huge and he wasn't just a big guy as far as his waistline if you will this guy was a man of war from his youth amen his armor the Bible says wait five thousand shekels I looked it up it's 125 pounds that he just wore as a male on his body that weighs more than a lot of us in here amen and not only that he had Grieves a Target on his back his staff was six to eight feet long I am 6'5 his staff was longer than me the weight of it was 15 pounds I mean this guy was huge a massive man amen and Goliath walked up and said bring out a man bring out a champion I'm a Philistine you're for the armies of Saul did you notice he called it the armies of Saul not the armies of God see God call it guys God was listening he said oh this guy doesn't know who he's dealing with if Goliath knew who he was really dealing with he might have ran hightail too amen he said the Army's a saw bring out a man and I wonder if God was in heaven you know the Bible says he rested on the seventh day I think I said this last time you know God sometimes rests amen I wonder if he was resting in a chair I don't know I don't see nothing wrong with chairs in heaven do you maybe he was sitting on a chair I don't know reading a book I don't know how do you rest baby he was reading the stories of people who believed him amen baby he was reminiscing about job if you will and just how proud he was of his son amen that even through his trials he could recognize his fear and be able to overcome maybe you looked at Abraham and just looked at the stories of what he was able to when he went out to go save his brother remember lot Amen brother man said that was his nominational brother and Abraham still had enough care for even for his denominational brother to go pray for him hear me Church don't get too messy amen we're here to help people in general amen Abraham was concerned about his brother lot who even ends up inside him anyways and maybe God had that story open reading in his chair one day praise the Lord that's my son that's exactly what I want to see hey man that's so good and all sudden he hears a voice from on Earth he says I defy the armies of the Living God today perked his ear up a little bit oh what's going on down there I better go look and maybe he looked over a cloud and looked down and saw this big man he says oh he wants to take me on well I think I'll just let them and all of a sudden the Lord looked back and opened up his Armory and he looked through he said I've used that one before maybe he pointed Abraham and I've used that one before I looked at Isaac I've used that one before Joseph I used that one real well I'm going to give Joseph a break I use that weapon a lot and he looked and he looked at a current weapon he's been using lately maybe he just got it out and started testing it a little bit and he said you know what I think it's time for this weapon to go into the big games and he took out a little old Ruddy Fair counting its boy who he just anointed to be king and he took out a little David and he said you know what I think I'll use David remember Goliath made his protests against God for 40 days he came out day and evening day if evening you hear me church sometimes it feels like that don't it every day and evening it's the same Goliath that's showing up all the time you think he overcame them the first day nope he showed up day two didn't he and day three and day four see sometimes I think we give the devil too much credit do you know how stupid that devil is sometimes he keeps coming thinking he's going to win he ain't gonna win he always loses he keeps fighting this war thing he's going to win we already know the end from the beginning he ends up in the Lake of Fire amen and yeah he is still fighting like as if he's going to make it amen that's how dumb the devil is so you just remembered that yeah he's a smart shoot guy don't get me wrong but when you really break down what he's doing he's pretty dumb and Goliath kept showing up day dang and everybody was scared of him well in a human view I think I would be too this man was nine foot nine inches man of muscle had huge weapons who could take him out and all of a sudden Jethro or Jesse I'm sorry uh David's father says I need you to go down to the war you need to bring some food to strengthen your brethren oh if only Jesse knew what he was doing I bet he knows now since he's on the other side what he was doing David was going to go and strengthen his brother and all right it just wasn't in the way Jesse thought because he told him to take some food and go strengthen the Brethren can I say something why don't you do that with each other sometime too don't try to focus on putting people down try to strengthen people give them strength you know sometimes you can strengthen people just by being available just be willing to help you may not know what you need to do but sometimes you just need to sit there and be available that's going to strengthen each other David is called of his father Amen to go down the war to strengthen his brethren and so David Goes Down And he's going to do what the father told him glory to God and he goes down there and remember this isn't his battle the Lord is going to have war with Goliath so God hadn't made sure David was in the right spot at the right time the Bible says he showed up in the morning he even left the carriage for the other person why David had to rush a little bit to get there David God's like David you gotta hurry up he's about to come and God put David right there he's about ready to go strengthen his brother Goliath showed up and he made his post again said the same words I'd fire the armies of the Living God but the Bible says something different here the Bible says and David heard him uh oh see this day is going to be a little different they stay is going to be a little different why God put a weapon there and David heard Goliath amen and it sparked something in him listen this boy was not a big guy brother man I looked up a few quotes he weighed anything from 80 to 110 pounds I mean I'm three Davids right now you know what I mean I'm standing up being three of them amen it was not a big guy but there was a revelation in his hearts amen something sparked in him God was going to have war and he was the weapon for the day amen he was the weapon God choose for the day hearing me Church there was a day when Goliath was trying to destroy the armies of the Living God it got out a weapon for the day to take care of it what are you gonna do today amen we're in a wicked evil age but God still has weapons on the Earth you're called to handle the day you are built to handle it don't let Satan lie to you that this world can destroy you it cannot you're built for it just like the three Hebrew children when they're throwing the fiery furnace amen the fire couldn't even touch them Amen to fiery furnace was seven times hotter Seven Ages of heat were built up and at the end of Satan's Eden showed up amen and they got thrown in the fire but a Fourth Man showed up glory to God a Fourth Man showed hope you know what that Force man had to be there before they entered into it glory to God and that Fourth Man was already there when they entered into Satan's Eden yeah it's pretty bad out in the world isn't it and it's only going to get a worse church it's not going to get better it's only going to get worse amen but there's a fourth man here still in the last day glory to God and you are built and equipped the hand of the heat of the day the Bible says couldn't even smell the fire on them oh glory to God even though the world's getting worse and worse you can't even get a hint of the smell of the world on a real Christian amen it cannot touch them amen brother Ben told us the only thing he did was loose their chains they were Bound in circumstances weren't they and they became free hey man listen this world can't even touch you God there's a fourth man in the fiery furnace God was having war at that time and he took out those three Hebrew children David heard these words boasting that Goliath had and God says I'm going to defy the armies of the Living God David said who is this uncircumcised philistine you know he got a little angry you know the Bible says be angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your Wrath you're allowed to be upset absolutely just don't be upset at each other [Laughter] don't be angry at each other we ain't got time for that you hear me Church be angry at the actual problem it's spirits and wickedness in high places we wrestle not against flesh of blood but against principalities and so forth amen that's the real enemy amen who's your biggest enemy brother man Thomas who our biggest enemy was he said it's not even the devil amen and so you know husbands it's not that white beside you either it's not her either just so you know your wives too I'm not gonna get there anymore okay I'm done last thing I'm gonna say about it amen who's the biggest enemy you got yourself amen that a lot of time is our problem that is the enemy amen listen can I give you some advice again amen as a Christian you have got to remember you cannot control what other people do no matter how hard you try no matter how hard you try to be nice no matter how hard you try to be kind you cannot control what other people do but you can't control what you do when I was a young Christian I heard the testimony of Earl Williams he was the son of Carl Williams with the business better businessman Bureau and so forth um he preached for brother Craig one time gave his testimony brother Earl Williams did way back in the day this is going maybe 2009 and so forth and I was a young Christian at the time and Earl Williams gave a great testimony he gave his opinion about brother Bama one part of it and he said you know about brother Branham you couldn't tell the difference between his friends and his enemies and I remember being a young Christian I got on my knees after that I said Lord God that's what I want to be spoken about me nobody could tell the difference between my friends and my enemies you treat them the same love your enemies amen bless those that curse you I'm sorry church I hate to be the bearer of bad news but not everybody's gonna like you some people are going to despise you some people are going to say some very hateful things especially behind your back and listen can I can I give you I have a little saying if you see one Mouse there's two in the walls if you see something how much more has it happened to you didn't see you see what I'm saying so see there's just things a lot of times that happen in life and it's not going to be easy it's not going to be fun amen that's why it's so important to make sure you know who you are know where you stand you can't control think about Brother Band me and Josiah were talking about this brother brand um the critics like to say he just had a word of knowledge gift or he had just a gift of Prophecy no he was a word prophet see a gift of Prophecy can be turned off and on by God a word of knowledge gifts are an anointed brother Ryan said a gift can anoint you one time and then not anoint you for 50 years he said that so gifts can be anointed and then taken back that's not brother Branham brother Brown was a prophet of prophets he was a word Prophet it didn't turn off and on he always had divisions could you imagine looking at people and knowing what they did to you all the stuff he knew it all and he could shake their hand say God bless you brother still love him from his heart remember that was the test for the seals remember it remember when God called him for the healing lines would he say if thou can only be sincere oh can you think about that and yeah he knew everything everybody said about him maybe he didn't know at all but he sure knew a lot of it and he knew it and he still had to be sincere in his heart and we know he was because he did heal the sick those prayer lines did work I said Lord take me higher then we talk about Higher Ground don't we won't go higher what does it look like what does it look like when we go higher amen I think it starts looking like when we can treat our enemies like our friends see when we're talking about this story of Goliath and so forth It's not the person that we're fighting Goliath is representing something but I've been talking many times can represent intellectual faith and so forth like that it can represent all these things what is the Goliath in your life I don't know but it's not each other amen we deal with spiritual things amen those are the Glides sometimes it's yourself looking in the mirror amen so David heard these words from Goliath I defy the armies of the Living God David said what's going to happen to the man it takes out Goliath well they said Saul's going to reward them greatly it's always going to reward them greatly but you know what David didn't worry about the rewards do you know that he was even accused of it God's you know sometimes you're going to have critics too he had a Critic oh that was so free I never thought of his brother as a Critic before amen David had his own critics because his older brother said I know the naughtiness in your heart did you know that just because he said that didn't mean David did David did it right David was a man after God's Own Heart so yeah God called see elab said you have naughtiest in your heart God said you're a man after my own heart who you going to listen to oh that was so free Hallelujah and I'm not even charging for that this morning amen I hope you heard the voice of God this morning amen just because somebody says something don't mean it's true about you Elie said oh you got naughty sir I know your pride you're just trying to be a bigger Christian than me oh let's bring it on down to us amen you're just trying to be more spiritual than me David said what are you talking about he said is there not a Cause and that's what David was worried about he wasn't worried about the reward he was worried about the condition the church was in and there was a problem that needed to be addressed Hallelujah quit sweeping your problems on the rug you hear me church because they don't actually go away you know God didn't even do that God didn't take the sin question just sweep around the road what did he do he came down into youth of Flesh and met the problem and when God met the problem what did he do he said I'm just going to forgive it all see that's going to help your heart a lot of times get a heart brother Ramstein a perfect faith faith is based on forgiveness so if you can't forgive you can't believe I hope he heard that I said the same with brownies and I still feel God's anointing right now when I just said it if you can't forgive you can't believe and you're sitting there going oh why is it so hard to believe in healing do you got bitterness in your heart why is bitterness so bad is because you can't forgive it that's why it's there and people like to hide just that little bitterness in their heart oh I'm preaching now you know why I'm preaching out because I've walked it myself you hide just a little bitterness in your heart and you know what you do you take another little bit of bitterness and you stack it on top of this bitterness and guess what now you got more of it then you take this and take that remember you can't control what other people do you can't control Satan coming in and bringing in bitters in your heart but you can't control what you do you don't have to hold on to your bitterness because if you do you if I have the Holy Spirit out of your heart you will come to church depressed and sad you'll be home reading your Bible getting nothing from God and you'll be like where is the feeling I used to have with God I'll tell you why you don't got it you ain't got no faith that's why you're feeling like that you got that bitterness of stacking up stacking up and listen listen I'm not saying it's going to be easy can I say it like this real quick well brother Paul we're here aren't we brother Paul can I say this listen you ain't being a big guy with bitterness amen bitterness is easy being bitter against somebody that's easy anybody can do that can you forgive like a man we taught the boys at kids days we taught boys to be men really drive home what sister Sharon was saying about trying to really define gender roles because of what this world is trying to do to it it is okay for boys to be boys and it's okay for girls to be girls nothing wrong with it and boys amen have to be tough they are tough they can endure hardships they got to the Bible does call I'm sorry to remind you remember the Bible does say a woman is the weaker vessel not that they're a worse vessel they're just weaker but they have different benefits right amen sometimes when the babies are crying about times that God can't handle it sometimes amen Brothers I got aim in the house of God yeah amen sometimes when the baby keep crying you're just like what are we crying about you know and you're just sitting there trying to solve the problem well you pull your hair out that's why you need a mama there sometimes because the mama can take it she can be emotional about it she can sympathize easier she can empathize easier that's why you do it but then sometimes you need somebody to take the hits somebody's got to protect the family and that's why Ben got to be tough that's why I say it like this bitterness is easy man it's easy to be bitter can you forgive like a man [Applause] get rid of the bitterness bitterness is never worth it there has never been a time in anybody's life that bitterness helped them in any way shape or form never happened it didn't help the human race and it ain't going to help you when God came to save the human race he didn't use bitterness Glory he used forgiveness the Bible says God has forgiven us for Christ's sake Hallelujah when God saved the world when God saved our souls he didn't use bitterness he used forgiveness amen Paul your dad one time preached a long time ago BCF the power of forgiveness amen there's so much power untapped in forgiveness for the church this morning you will feel better you will walk better you will talk better you'll think better you'll have a better day it is a new and better Covenant Hallelujah when you trust in God Amen and believe in forgiveness not only for yourself but for the sins of the whole world you know the Bible even says the world sins are forgiven nobody goes to hell because of sin nobody they go to hell because they didn't accept the pardon God paid the price for all sins he paid the price for all sins you know why because as soon as somebody accept it their sins are already paid there's not a new payment God is if somebody knew coming to this church and ask for forgiveness God doesn't have to show up again to die for him he already paid the price and since he already paid the price when they accept it we're done it's forgiving and that's how God save the world Hallelujah and that's how God's Gonna Save your loved ones amen oh I said we strike down Goliath today amen strike down that Goliath of bitterness amen use your grace amen fire smooth Stones David took j-e-s-u-s g-r-a-c-e f-a-i-t-h amen take your five stones and break down that giant amen glory to God and Hallelujah are promised not to be long today but it's not working is it hey man oh don't you feel good in the presence of the Lord do you feel that right now do you feel it's it's somehow you know what I mean like like a lot of times people get stuck in this legalistic thinking of I if I have more works I can be closer to God Amen and I just I can I encourage you this morning get rid of that thinking out of your mind I've said this multiple times lately it keeps popping up in my sermons I've said do you think that if you hadn't made any good works and you live so holy that if you add your Holiness to God he'd be more holy now you cannot live so holy that you add more Holiness to God amen so then why does God need your Holiness then there's nothing wrong with good works but we got to think of it right I don't do good works because I think God is better because of it I do it because I love him because of what he did for me I don't want to hurt him what did Brothers say the middle of the road between faith and works called it love that's the middle of the road listen what did God what does God actually want from you what does God actually want from you think about it like that does God need your good works to be better you know what the Bible says the Bible he says in the book of Acts he doesn't even mean your hands to worship Him seeing he gives life and breath to all things wait a minute so now he doesn't need my hands to worship I mean think about it God made the air didn't he he made your body so he made it all so you're only alive because of him so he made you alive just to do this what did he actually want from you but Abraham said the Bible well we're we're doing a different sermon this morning I hope you don't mind the Bible says brother bam taught us in Christ the minister of God the Bible is written for one purpose and one goal one purpose you hear me it's not two it's not three it's not ten all this Bible was written for one purpose and he said it's three-fold amen it's not three purposes it's a three-fold one purpose and what is it we all know what it is Christ on the preeminence of one man Christ I'm the preeminist a group of Believers hello you are the second fold of his purpose hello you are a part of God's purpose but then what's the third one Adam and Eve in the garden again all the Bible's purpose is written for is that we would know him in the fullness back in the garden and what was the garden made for you ever thought about that for a second why did God make the guardian of Eden I mean Canadian just made man and planted him anywhere and one sense he could right he's God he could do whatever he wants but why did God make the Garden of Eden brother Brahm tells us and it's a quote I can give you the quote later if you want it but the RAM said in Fellowship the guardian of Eden was made for Fellowship there's one thing God couldn't do by himself and that's fellowship with you so why did God bring you here for Fellowship do you see why God don't need your works I do my works I want to live a better Christian life because of what he did for me not because I think he'll do more for me are you hearing me church I know this is so hard for us to hear sometimes your Works your Works your your holiness amen isn't going to ever match God's holiness your Holiness and your righteousness is filthy rags so throw it in the dumpster already will ya get rid of your anger and your bitterness amen get rid of your legalistic thinking what a waste of time don't you want to serve God how do you serve God who wants to be closer to God I know I do well brother man told you how to do it said read your Bible and pray every day it's one of the quickest answers you ever gave him question and answers my goodies do you think you talk a little bit more about it but is it really that simple you know what I mean could it be that simple oh sometimes we think we got to be a better Christian and I gotta do more work for the Lord can I feed more sick can I feed more of the poor can I do more work can I do more do more and sometimes we start relying on that stuff that's what's going to make it to heaven for us for us no it's not you're going to make it to Heaven because of him remember the story of Martha and Mary I always mix them up you forgive me if I get their names wrong but there was one sister one time doing the work in the kitchen getting the food ready and the other sister was sitting down listening to the word and the other sister got upset didn't she man I gotta do all the work and this one's not doing anything Jesus says she picked the more important thing this was supposed to be a fun sermon but what are you doing are you picking the important thing sometimes you're going to need to stop and listen listen it's good to hear a preacher amen it's good to hear each other but sometimes the only answer is going to be God and you need to start listening for his voice you need to hear what God has to say to you because I'm telling you right now preachers don't always have the answers sorry brother Ram said that he said the gospel ain't a gimmick it's not a gimmick that has all the answers to everything amen one person might have to do something and one person has to do something different sometimes they can look completely opposite of each other and yet they're both following the will of God you ever think about this for a second Jonah when Jonah was was ended up in that Wales building you know how Jonah ended up in that whale's belly not doing what God told him to do he was supposed to go to the Eva and he said I ain't going to Don Nueva and he went to tarshus and he was on a boat that day and they knew those Sailors had a lot of sense more sense of the world today they think the judgments of God and things like that and the bad weather is because of climate change oh man that was pretty good amen those Sailors knew better than that they said no this climate ain't because of climate change because God's trying to tell us something oh that was good you take that home with you hey man who hallelujah amen those Sailors had a lot more sense they said oh what's this storm going on this ain't just climate change God's doing something here and Jonah knew it was him he said throw me off and they actually felt bad for the guy took lots and it was still Jonah he was a prophet remember so not only did he know but God made sure and Jonah aylined up in that whale's belly didn't he he said once more will I look to thy Holy Temple now we sometimes brother Graham said this sometimes Jonah gets a bad rap people think Jonah was backslided brother man said Jonah wasn't backsliding he was spirit-led wait a minute Jonah Spirit lead how could you say that oh it's very easy Jesus brings it up about his own Resurrection Jesus said as Jonah was in the whale's belly for three days and three nights so shall the son of man be in the heart of the Earth Jonah became a type of the resurrection of Christ as a matter of fact he's the only one he's the only type of a person going through the resurrection of Jesus Christ and how did he end up in that whale's belly not doing what God Said isn't that something brother Stephen I don't think that brother should be doing that are you sure what if he's a Jonah oh can I say it like this what if you're the Jonah see that's why it's so important I'm going to close with this because I could talk about this all day hey man but let me just end with this amen sometimes we don't have all the answers you don't have all the answers for yourself and you don't have all the answers for your brother but we're all in this together still can you say Amen and not just I hope you understand your local assembly should be close together too remember there's a bride over the whole earth too I appreciate what brother Paul said about your church supporting other Ministries and so forth amen that's what we ought to do and you ought to be thankful that your your your finances and your and your servitude and so forth can help other people I know you got started you're broadcasting and things like that I think that's an absolute fantastic idea you know how many people don't have a chance you got don't even have a chance to hear the words of the prophet we take it for granted sometime can you say Amen I know I do sometimes sometimes we get stuck in our own little bubble and we forget about the actual goal is to find more souls for Jesus Christ maybe we can do a little prayer like that maybe we'll end on that amen can you let's take a little time and just remember those people who don't know Jesus Christ and we can and we can worry about them just a little bit can you say Amen there's people out there who if you don't say something are going to hell if you don't bring it up when you're in the supermarket amen and you maybe you see somebody have a little Jesus fish pin on their thing in the cash register bring it up hey are you a friend Christian will praise the Lord I'm a Christian too would you mind if we pray with them amen oh I think I've given you this testimony before but I'm going to do it again real quick okay if you don't mind I had a brother one time come up to me and ask me that very same question when I started working at Salters he came up to me and he said me and this other brother pray each morning hope you hear me he overheard me talking about Christ to somebody else and he came up and he said I want to pray you want to pray with me and this other person uh me and the other person work third and he worked first so they would pray in the morning together and I said amen I'll pray with you there were all denominational people some Mennonite some uh Pentecostal we prayed with each other something so small is that amen and then they found out they did a bible study on Tuesday some men's bible study would you like to come sure I'll come and we get to talking and so forth and I present the message to him amen by by that one little willingness to pray with somebody else ended up saving a man named Steve Delaney and you know his daughter she a couple of his daughters and I think about it the one daughter seered this time but the other daughter decided to miss my service too you make sure you make Kyle and Laura feel bad for missing my service okay I did it to Josiah and Ashley last time now I'm doing to them okay I treat the ladies like my family so I can get him in trouble he's listening right now so I'm getting him in trouble amen but that's my point is that that one little prayer that's all it started I'm just so struck by it right now it was one man came up to me and asked to pray with him amen saved an entire family what about you you see what I'm saying I have a heart willing for that have a heart like David when you see that Goliath let's take that Goliath out amen let's pick up our five smooth Stones let's take Grace with us amen and let's take out the Goliath can you say Amen you love the Lord amen let's bow our heads for a prayer most gracious kind of heavenly father I just thank you Lord for this morning's service Lord Lord your presence just as Paul said this morning Lord your presence just feels so comforting this morning Lord the words that you spoke today Lord I believe we're just used to try to lift us up a little higher Lord just said Lord we do want to be better Christians I want to be able to be a servant to you Lord to be a better Christian in the army of the Lord I want to be a better weapon to your lord Jesus I want to be able to be used by you in a more effective manner Lord and I do believe this morning Lord you have given us lessons and thoughts oh God to help us to become a better Christian in this life because Lord as Christians we're not living this life to stay here but we are living for the world to come and so I pray God in the name of Jesus Lord you meet each Soul this morning Lord and however manner you need to meet them oh God and maybe you can just pull them up just a little bit higher this morning maybe they were just weak from this weekend Lord and and as brother Brian would say when you do something for the Lord the devil's always right there afterwards to try to bring it down I pray under the anointing of the holy spirit that Lord God your spirit will come down to them and maybe just lift them up a little higher [Music] just bring them up a little higher in your presence and say listen you are serving well not just take a little rest and comfort in my presence if we just say in your presence a little bit this morning Lord Satan's trying to destroy us he goes as a lying walking to and fro seeking whom he may devour below we're going to speak like David when Goliath is standing there saying I'm gonna put you on the end of my spirit and feed you the fowls we can stand tall amen even facing a giant man like Goliath Facing a Giant trial and situation and we can say like David you come to me and sword in spear but I come in the name of the Lord oh Lord as the Bride of Jesus Christ we hold nothing but the name of Jesus Christ and Lord that's how we're going to overcome in this age that's how we're going to fight that's how we're able to stand in this day we come in the name of the Lord for the name of the Lord is the Strong Tower and the righteous run into it and are saved thank you Lord Jesus for this morning God I pray for a special blessing upon these people who gave their hearts for a great ministry and a service I pray you bless all the people who helped within oh God and when I ask for the blessing I don't ask for more money or more or more cars Lord God I pray that the words that were spoken that were planted in the kids Hearts oh God you will bless it by reigning your spirit upon them and bringing and grow into life and to those young people's hearts oh God [Music] thank you Lord Jesus for this weekend Lord what a great beautiful weekend we've had Lord this this service just feels like icing on the cake to me this morning Lord it just feels like a
