[4:27] [Music]
[4:38] [Music]
[4:42] Psalms 46, God is our refuge and
[4:46] strength, a very present help in
[4:48] trouble. Therefore will will not we
[4:51] fear, though the earth be moved, and
[4:54] though the mountains be carried into the
[4:55] midst of the sea, though the waters
[4:56] thereof roar and be troubled, though the
[4:59] mountains shake with swelling thereof.
[5:01] Sa there is a river, the streams whereof
[5:04] shall make glad the city of God, the
[5:08] only the holy place of the tabernacles
[5:10] of the most high. God is in in the midst
[5:13] of her. She shall not be moved. God
[5:17] shall help her and that right early. How
[5:20] many you know that when he's present and
[5:22] he says he's in the midst of her. It's
[5:24] interesting that's speaking of the city,
[5:26] but it's also speaking of the bride.
[5:29] He's in the midst of her. And the reason
[5:31] she can't be moved is because he's in
[5:34] the midst.
[5:36] God is in the midst of her. He shall not
[5:38] be moved. God shall help her. And that
[5:40] right early the heathen raged. The
[5:42] kingdoms were moved. He uttered his
[5:45] voice. The earth melted. The Lord of
[5:48] hosts is with us. The God of Jacob is
[5:50] our refuge. Sailor like to go back and
[5:52] look at the elements of his kingdom
[5:54] here. And that is that you have him in
[5:56] the midst of her. You have her not
[5:58] moved. You have the heathen raging. When
[6:01] you have his kingdom and you have these
[6:03] elements, the heathen is raging and
[6:05] other kingdoms became uh crushed and
[6:08] become moved. And then you have the
[6:10] element of him uttering his voice. And
[6:13] when he utters his voice, the earth
[6:15] melted. Now, when we go to Hebrews 12 in
[6:18] the New Testament, you're going to find
[6:20] exactly the same language here in
[6:22] speaking about his kingdom breaking up
[6:24] other kingdoms. So, I want to read it
[6:27] and see how you know the Bible is
[6:29] inspired by the Holy Ghost. And as David
[6:32] wrote that inspired by the Holy Ghost,
[6:33] then we find uh Paul here in Hebrews
[6:36] writing exactly the same thing in
[6:38] continuity. Hebrews chapter 12 and verse
[6:41] 25.
[6:43] See that ye refuse not him that
[6:45] speaketh. For if they escape not, who
[6:48] refuseth him that spake on the earth,
[6:51] much more shall not we escape, if we
[6:53] turn away from him that speaketh from
[6:55] heaven, whose voice then shook the
[6:58] earth. So I want you to notice there's
[6:59] the voice that David talked about. The
[7:02] voice is present. The voice is speaking.
[7:04] What's it doing? It shook the earth. But
[7:07] now he promised saying, "Yet once more,
[7:08] I shake not the earth only, but also
[7:11] heaven." at this word yet once more
[7:14] signifyth the removing of all those
[7:17] things that are shaken. This voice is so
[7:20] powerful it will shake every other
[7:22] kingdom on the face of the
[7:24] earth. Th those things that are shaken
[7:26] are the things that are made that those
[7:28] things which cannot be shaken may remain
[7:31] and that's the kingdom of God. Wherefore
[7:34] we receiving a kingdom which cannot be
[7:37] moved, let us have grace whereby we may
[7:40] serve God acceptably with reverence and
[7:43] godly fear. This is the way we should
[7:45] live if we've received a kingdom. How
[7:48] many believe that we have received his
[7:50] kingdom? This is thy kingdom come part
[7:52] two. And I want to continue on it
[7:55] because I I'm discovering more things um
[7:59] that even though this prayer, thy
[8:03] kingdom come, thy will be done on earth
[8:05] as it is in heaven, is probably quoted
[8:08] by millions of people, probably a
[8:10] majority of those people don't know what
[8:12] that means to pray, "Thy kingdom come,
[8:15] thy will be done in earth as it is in
[8:17] heaven." We have so many things that
[8:19] become popular, including Christmas
[8:21] time. But how many people don't know the
[8:23] true meaning of it? And so I've been
[8:25] looking at this prayer again uh and
[8:27] looking at over and and and many people
[8:29] and believers quote this uh and know
[8:32] that since Christ, they'd actually know
[8:34] we we have had in phases
[8:37] uh for when Christ came from that point
[8:41] we've had the kingdom coming to us in
[8:43] phase phases. In other words, his
[8:46] kingdom coming back to earth. He has to
[8:48] redeem the earth and he has to redeem
[8:51] his people before his kingdom can be
[8:54] established back on earth again. But
[8:56] it's a process. It's been quite a long
[8:58] process, a couple thousand years. And
[9:01] God promised back in the garden there
[9:02] would be a redemption. There would be a
[9:04] restoration. But then we find when Jesus
[9:06] came, uh, that was the beginning of the
[9:09] kingdom. It wasn't just Jesus standing
[9:11] there, God in flesh, but he was bringing
[9:13] something with him. He was the king and
[9:16] he was bringing his kingdom to this
[9:17] earth. And that's the first time we get
[9:20] to see what God looks like in human
[9:22] flesh. What God looks like on the earth
[9:25] in a full manifestation. And he's
[9:27] actually carrying the principles, the
[9:30] word. He is the word and he's bringing
[9:32] that to earth. That's God's desire to
[9:35] bring himself in his kingdom back to
[9:37] earth again. And so this morning I want
[9:40] you to look at it because we realize
[9:41] that uh that it's well known that his
[9:44] kingdom is coming and many know that
[9:46] when Christ came he was bringing his
[9:47] kingdom. He talked about it so it's in
[9:49] the Bible. They know that his kingdom is
[9:51] is coming. John introduced him by saying
[9:54] repent for the kingdom of heaven is at
[9:56] hand. So he was saying the kingdom is
[9:57] coming through this uh through this
[9:59] Messiah coming. And so we need we need
[10:02] to repent. That's what he called for is
[10:04] repentance as a prerequisite to the
[10:06] kingdom coming. We need to repent. I
[10:08] wonder if it's the same today. If you're
[10:10] interested in his kingdom coming to you
[10:12] and you have the kingdom within you, it
[10:14] starts with repenting.
[10:17] It starts with a true repentance. If you
[10:19] want something more of God, it starts
[10:21] with a true repentance. And so, uh, then
[10:24] it is also well known that the kingdom
[10:27] relates to after the last days, uh,
[10:29] there will be an ushering in of a new
[10:31] age and it's called the kingdom age. And
[10:34] that's the millennial reign of Christ
[10:36] for a thousand years. And so many Bible
[10:38] scholars, many people that maybe don't
[10:41] read their Bibles much, they kind of
[10:42] have that in their mind. They know that.
[10:44] And then we realize what we spoke about
[10:47] last Sunday. His people come a bit early
[10:49] into that kingdom before the millennium.
[10:52] There's a people who come into uh his
[10:55] kingdom by revelation. And that's
[10:57] because in Revelations 5, the book of
[11:00] redemption, the book, the title deed
[11:02] that was to the earth that Adam had got
[11:05] lost, went back into the hands of the
[11:07] original owner and it was lost from Adam
[11:09] and he fell. Him and Eve fell and they
[11:12] lost the authority. They lost the title
[11:15] deed. They lost the the inheritance that
[11:18] they had. They lost the power. And so
[11:20] now they become weak because sin came in
[11:22] the picture. Everything that they had
[11:24] that was given to them by God was lost
[11:27] there in the garden. His authority, his
[11:30] power, and his title deed that he
[11:32] actually owned the earth and ruled and
[11:34] reign over it. It got lost in the file.
[11:36] And then God starts to say, "I'm going
[11:38] to bring that all back. I'm going to
[11:40] bring my kingdom back on this earth. I'm
[11:42] going to purge it from every sin and
[11:44] every spirit. I'm going to bring it
[11:45] back. But before I bring that kingdom
[11:48] back to the earth, I'm I'm going to
[11:50] spiritually put that kingdom in the
[11:52] hearts of the people. And that's why in
[11:55] Revelations 5, after that book is opened
[11:57] and our kinsman takes that book, we
[11:59] realize that the last thing they said is
[12:02] we shall rule and reign. That's quite a
[12:06] proclamation. I thought the king was
[12:08] supposed to rule and reign. I thought it
[12:10] was Jesus. Well, he is the king of
[12:12] kings. But they're saying after the book
[12:14] is open, we shall rule and reign as
[12:17] kings and priests. That's a pretty bold
[12:20] statement. But they had a it it takes a
[12:22] revelation. They had never said that.
[12:24] They would have been more of the past
[12:26] religions that would say our king is
[12:28] going to be the king and he's going to
[12:30] rule and reign in the millennium. But
[12:32] they weren't saying just that. They were
[12:34] saying we shall rule and reign. Can you
[12:37] say amen?
[12:39] We shall rule. something happened in
[12:42] Revelations 5 and a revelation come to
[12:44] their hearts to say we as his people
[12:47] shall rule and reign. Can you say amen?
[12:50] So it would it would take a a revelation
[12:53] of the entire view of his kingdom coming
[12:56] to make that statement. We shall.
[13:00] Anybody ever had uh somebody say we?
[13:02] Like for example, you know, a husband
[13:05] saying, you know, to his buddies, he's
[13:07] saying, you know, uh me and my wife, we
[13:10] we had a baby and it was real hard. And
[13:13] the wife hears and she goes, "What you
[13:15] mean
[13:17] we? What you mean we?" Or the wife's on
[13:20] the phone say, "Yeah, we cleaned the
[13:22] whole yard today. It looks beautiful."
[13:25] and and the husband's listening in the
[13:27] corner saying, "What you mean we?" I I
[13:30] drive up my driveway and I have kind of
[13:33] a long one there. And I I drive up and I
[13:35] have to I hear my wife saying, and I
[13:38] hate to say this, but it's like, "We
[13:40] need to do that. We need to cut those
[13:42] trees down. We need to" And we get up to
[13:44] the house and we need to move those
[13:46] flowers. We And I'm going, "What you
[13:47] mean
[13:49] we? You mean I do that?" you but it's
[13:52] it's polite to say we we need to do
[13:54] that. It's like a you know we we go
[13:56] together but you know what uh Christ
[13:59] said where I am you may be also
[14:02] everything that he overcome he's called
[14:04] you to overcome.
[14:05] Every kingdom power that he's come to in
[14:08] authority he's given that to his people
[14:10] as well. So they were allowed by
[14:13] revelation to say it's not only our king
[14:16] but we shall rule and reign. Can you say
[14:18] amen? And so it it's it's because uh uh
[14:23] after the book was taken and the seals
[14:25] were taken off, we become joint hes with
[14:28] Christ. And that's why we can say we
[14:31] shall rule and reign. Can you say amen?
[14:33] So because of the revelation in the
[14:35] bride, she is the one calling for the
[14:37] kingdom to come. Millions and billions
[14:39] may say the Lord's prayer, thy kingdom
[14:42] come. That's fine. That's fine. But it's
[14:44] the ones that have received the kingdom
[14:47] by the word that are qualified to call
[14:50] for his kingdom to come. Can you say
[14:53] amen?
[14:54] It is the ones who have already received
[14:57] and taken possession of the kingdom of
[15:00] the word that are qualified to say the
[15:03] prayer, thy kingdom come, thy will be
[15:06] done. It's us that's qualified to pull
[15:08] it from the other dimension and bring it
[15:11] to earth. Not only to say say it, but to
[15:13] live it. That your your will, Lord. Your
[15:16] will that's been unwelcome in the earth,
[15:19] unwelcome in homes, unwelcome in
[15:21] governments, unwelcome in people's
[15:24] minds, unwelcome with everywhere.
[15:26] There's been a rebellion for 6,000
[15:28] years. And his perfect will has been
[15:30] unwelcome. Finally, there's a people
[15:32] that receive his kingdom and they say
[15:35] the prayer by revelation. Thy kingdom
[15:37] come and your will that's not welcome
[15:40] will be welcome in my life. Your word,
[15:43] if it's not welcome in any other place,
[15:46] it'll be welcome in me. It'll be welcome
[15:48] in my home. It'll be welcome in my
[15:50] thoughts. I receive it and I possess it
[15:53] in Jesus name.
[15:56] This is the people that can pray that
[15:58] prayer by revelation. Uh to not only say
[16:02] say it, but to live it. Your kingdom of
[16:04] your word is being pulled from the word
[16:07] and implemented on earth wherever we can
[16:10] establish it in every area of our life.
[16:13] our homes, our churches, our businesses,
[16:17] if we own a business, our domain that
[16:20] God, every place that we can bring his
[16:22] kingdom and his word, our
[16:25] relationships, every place we call upon
[16:29] his will to be on earth as it is in
[16:32] heaven. Praise the Lord. And last Sunday
[16:35] I was drawing a clear distinction about
[16:37] just knowing his kingdom is coming and
[16:40] calling for it, praying for it, pulling
[16:43] it down. When Jesus did the multiplying
[16:46] of fishes and loaves, they wanted to
[16:47] make him a king because they seen his
[16:50] kingdom was coming. They did miracles
[16:52] like that. So they got excited. This is
[16:54] our Messiah. This is our king because
[16:56] he's doing these miracles. The kingdom
[16:58] must be coming to us. But what they
[17:00] didn't realize, it's not in the way they
[17:02] were thinking. and they were thinking
[17:03] his kingdom is coming. I want to draw
[17:05] that distinction. When Jesus did those
[17:08] miracles, they wanted to make him king.
[17:10] And he actually got in a boat and got
[17:11] away from him because it wasn't time yet
[17:14] for him to set up his kingdom as king
[17:16] that way. There was a whole 2,000 years
[17:19] that he would bring his elect Gentiles
[17:22] into this kingdom and they would rule
[17:24] and reign with him. So, it wasn't time.
[17:26] So, but they want they they knew this is
[17:29] something different. this is the
[17:30] kingdom. And they wanted to make him
[17:32] king and he ran away because they seen
[17:34] his kingdom was coming. But they did not
[17:37] want to go deeper than that. Here's my
[17:39] point. People can see that his kingdom
[17:41] is
[17:42] coming. But I think we should desire to
[17:45] go deeper than that.
[17:48] I see a distinction in receiving the
[17:51] kingdom and even deeper than that
[17:53] possessing it. Next week maybe I'll go
[17:55] into Daniel where three or four places
[17:58] in prophecy it says that the saints
[18:00] shall possess the kingdom. It doesn't
[18:03] say they just receive it. It says
[18:05] they'll possess it. They'll take it as
[18:08] their own. This is a possession. This is
[18:11] not just saying nodding your head and
[18:13] saying, "Yeah, I agree. Yes. Yes." This
[18:15] is taking hold of it yourself. When
[18:17] somebody possesses something, they take
[18:19] it as their own. It's mine. If you call
[18:22] and you you hear you've got something
[18:24] down at the pawn shop and you call him
[18:26] and say, "Hey, you know, uh, I've got
[18:28] this. Jesus has paid the price for me.
[18:30] He gave me this gift." You can tell it
[18:32] on the phone all day, but you haven't
[18:34] possessed it yet. You just said, "It's
[18:35] mine. You've claimed it is yours." But
[18:37] you got to get in your car and go down
[18:39] to that before you possess it. When you
[18:40] go in that store, it's been paid for.
[18:42] Jesus paid for it. And now I'm here to
[18:45] possess it. I'm here to take it as my
[18:47] own. And guess what? I'm going to take
[18:49] it home. I'm going to put it in my home.
[18:51] It's going to become a part of my home.
[18:52] Can I get an amen? This message is not
[18:55] just to go to church and nod your head
[18:57] at. It's to take it and possess it and
[19:00] take it home with you. This message is
[19:02] the kingdom of God come to us and we
[19:05] pull that kingdom down into oursel and
[19:07] we establish that in our homes and in
[19:10] our lives. David started the kingdom.
[19:12] And so Saul was anointed. He was
[19:14] anointed the same anointing, but he was
[19:16] the wrong man because God didn't choose
[19:17] him. And later on when he messed up,
[19:20] then God said, "I'll send my prophet
[19:22] again and I'm going to anoint this this
[19:24] young boy." And here he anoints David,
[19:27] that young boy that day. And the prophet
[19:29] anoints him. But the prophet was only
[19:32] part of it. The prophet was only part of
[19:34] it. That was only just a small segment
[19:37] of the process. Once his prophet
[19:40] anointed him, then you enter in the
[19:41] kingdom age. David becomes the king who
[19:44] was a type of Christ. Can you say amen?
[19:46] And guess what? He was anointed, but it
[19:48] wasn't until about 10 or 15 years later.
[19:53] Theologians dispute over this, but it's
[19:55] about 10 to 15 years before David
[19:57] actually took the throne.
[20:00] So, I just want you to look at your
[20:02] lives. You can be anointed by the Holy
[20:05] Ghost, but David had to go through some
[20:07] real learning and hurtful times and Saul
[20:11] trying to kill kill him and all kinds of
[20:13] stuff before he actually took the
[20:15] throne. What are we doing here? Well,
[20:17] we're be we're anointed for the throne.
[20:20] Can you say amen? The Holy Ghost has
[20:22] anoint you for kingship, for for kings
[20:25] and priests. It's to anoint you to the
[20:27] throne. But were you ready when you were
[20:29] first saved?
[20:31] Oh, there's no response. Maybe you were.
[20:34] I wasn't ready.
[20:36] I wasn't ready. And I'm The very reason
[20:39] I'm still here this morning still shows
[20:40] I'm still not ready. But somebody's
[20:43] making me ready to rule and reign.
[20:45] Somebody's molding my life and he's put
[20:47] people in my life. He's put trials in my
[20:49] life. He's put people that's hurt me.
[20:51] All these other things. Saul, if you
[20:53] haven't been through a Saul, David
[20:55] situation, you probably will eventually
[20:57] because I see that cycle of Saul and
[20:59] David play in churches in this message,
[21:02] in family relationships, in all kinds of
[21:06] things dealing with headship and things.
[21:07] You watch that Saul. And why is it that
[21:09] happens? There's a Saul. There's a
[21:11] David. There's a mistreatment of Saul.
[21:13] There's him holding on to his kingdom.
[21:16] All that plays out. And what was it for?
[21:18] To groom David for the throne.
[21:22] Every trial that is allowed in your life
[21:26] is not just wasted. It's to groom you
[21:28] for the throne. It's that you rule and
[21:31] reign with Christ. Can I get an amen
[21:33] this morning? Don't you devalue any
[21:37] mistreatment that you've received. Don't
[21:39] get bitter about it. Because as Joseph
[21:42] said to his own brothers who put him in
[21:44] a pit and sold him and did all after he
[21:47] recognized the predestinated plan of
[21:49] God, he said, "What you did in evil, God
[21:51] has meant it for good." And guess where
[21:52] it took him? To the throne as a king.
[21:57] He had to go through the brothers
[22:00] persecuting him that way to be ready for
[22:03] the throne.
[22:06] Amen. I see a distinction in actually
[22:09] from receiving it to possessing it to
[22:11] claiming it to owning it. Amen. If you
[22:13] win a prize, you can say call and say
[22:15] it's yours, but it's another thing to
[22:17] possess it and go home, bring it home
[22:19] with you and use it. Can you say amen?
[22:22] This is what's happening is that we
[22:24] receive his kingdom and then we begin to
[22:26] put it to practice in our homes. Matthew
[22:28] 13 and verse 19. When anyone heareth the
[22:32] word of the kingdom and understandeth it
[22:36] not, can you imagine this? They hear the
[22:39] word of what? His
[22:41] kingdom and understandeth it not, then
[22:45] cometh the wicked one and catcheth away.
[22:47] That's what is sown in his heart. Talked
[22:50] about this in the youth meeting at my
[22:51] house Friday night. I had a wonderful
[22:52] discussion on friendship. And if you
[22:55] form the wrong friendships, they always
[22:57] steal something away from you.
[23:00] something will get stolen. And I asked
[23:01] the young people, "What will get
[23:02] stolen?" Well, they knew exactly. If you
[23:04] go in that crowd and hang with that
[23:06] crowd, you're going to lose precious
[23:08] things that you have.
[23:10] And uh it was a tremendous conversation.
[23:13] And so this is what happens is if if you
[23:15] don't move from hearing the kingdom like
[23:18] you are this morning to understanding
[23:20] the kingdom and then embracing the
[23:22] kingdom, then cometh the wicked one and
[23:24] catcheth away that which is sown in his
[23:26] heart. This is he which receiveth seed
[23:28] by the wayside. Verse 20. But he that
[23:30] receiveth seed into stony places, the
[23:32] same is he that heareth the word. So
[23:35] here's another start. They heard the
[23:36] word of the kingdom, and Aon with joy
[23:39] receiveth it. So their first response is
[23:43] different than the guy that doesn't
[23:44] understand it. And the wicked one steals
[23:47] and catches away what was swn in his
[23:48] heart. This one receives it very good.
[23:51] He's a big amener. Ah, I hear the word
[23:54] of the kingdom. Glory. He might be the
[23:56] biggest shoutter in church. the biggest
[23:58] amener because he receives it with joy.
[24:01] Praise be to God. This is his kingdom
[24:04] being preached to me. And you think this
[24:06] guy's going to go on forever. He's the
[24:08] loudest amener. He shouts all over the
[24:10] building cuz he received this preaching
[24:13] with aon of joy.
[24:17] But look what happens. Yet he hath no
[24:20] root in himself, but endureth for a
[24:23] while. But when tribulation or
[24:26] persecution arises because of that word
[24:30] by and by, he is offended. There's a lot
[24:33] of different categories here, but
[24:34] they're all sitting
[24:37] there hearing the word of the kingdom.
[24:40] His offense become greater than the
[24:42] kingdom.
[24:44] Is anybody listening this morning?
[24:46] people can get a place that their
[24:48] bitterness and their offenses and being
[24:50] offended become greater in their life
[24:53] than the kingdom.
[24:55] And when it does, bitterness comes in.
[24:57] Bitterness comes into families and then
[24:59] they're gone. They're gone. You don't
[25:00] see them. There's a lot of families
[25:02] here. You don't see them again because
[25:04] something happened and their offense or
[25:07] the persecution or the preaching that
[25:09] was correcting them and that become an
[25:11] offense to them and it become greater
[25:13] than the word of the kingdom. There's a
[25:15] big picture here this morning in this
[25:17] service. There's a bigger picture
[25:18] besides this uh uh little bit overweight
[25:21] preacher here and besides what you see
[25:23] in me and all this and looking over and
[25:24] seeing your neighbor. There's a bigger
[25:26] thing that's going on. The kingdom is
[25:28] being preached to us. And at the end of
[25:30] the day, it's about you receiving that
[25:33] kingdom and possessing that kingdom.
[25:35] When you walk out of here, if you don't
[25:37] get that, then everything else is a
[25:38] waste. Can you say amen? Let me finish
[25:40] the scripture because he's not the only
[25:42] one that receives it with joy. Glory.
[25:45] And then he's gone. He's offended. He
[25:47] also, verse 22, that receive seed among
[25:49] the thorns is he that heareth the word
[25:51] of the kingdom, and the care of this
[25:53] world, the worries of this world, and
[25:56] the deceitfulness of riches choke the
[25:59] word, and he becometh unfruitful. Here's
[26:03] another guy. All these people receive,
[26:05] all these people hear it. But here's
[26:07] another guy who he gets worried about
[26:10] maybe gets worried about the finances or
[26:12] he gets worried about the worries of
[26:13] this life and it overtakes him and that
[26:15] becomes more important than the kingdom
[26:17] the riches. What how did it the
[26:19] deceitfulness of riches? Oh my god my
[26:22] can it be that this happens that the
[26:24] deceitfulness of riches can choke the
[26:26] very kingdom of the word and something
[26:28] stops and all of a sudden now riches
[26:31] become more important and then they're
[26:33] gone. They're not here because you know
[26:35] why? Riches and the cares of life and
[26:38] those goals become more important than
[26:41] the kingdom.
[26:43] And the family and the children will
[26:46] suffer for it years down the road
[26:48] because why? Daddy wasn't about the
[26:50] kingdom.
[26:51] Daddy fell to the pressure of riches.
[26:54] But he that receiveth seed into the good
[26:56] ground is he that heareth the word and
[27:00] understandeth it, which I believe is a
[27:02] revelation. They got a revelation of it.
[27:04] But look what happens. Which also
[27:06] beareth fruit and bringeth forth. What
[27:09] does that mean? That means the kingdom
[27:12] came in their lives. The word was not
[27:14] just the word. It came into their lives.
[27:16] And you see fruit of the message coming
[27:19] from their life. You see the kingdom in
[27:23] their lives. If I want to see what
[27:25] heaven looks like, if I want to see the
[27:27] atmosphere of heaven and what it looks
[27:28] like, I should be able to see it in
[27:31] people's lives. And let me say that this
[27:33] king of this kingdom, brothers and
[27:35] sisters, never forces you to do what you
[27:38] need to do. He never forces his headship
[27:40] on you. He never forces his rulership
[27:43] over you. Joseph never forced the people
[27:46] to come under his reign in Egypt. They
[27:48] slowly in the famine all begin to come
[27:51] to him, including their brothers, and
[27:53] they all begin to surrender willingly.
[27:56] Joseph, we need your help. You're our
[27:58] king. And that's our king. He never
[28:01] forces anybody to do anything. They come
[28:04] willingly and say, "If this is your
[28:06] kingdom, then I want to see your kingdom
[28:09] in me." For watching our service today,
