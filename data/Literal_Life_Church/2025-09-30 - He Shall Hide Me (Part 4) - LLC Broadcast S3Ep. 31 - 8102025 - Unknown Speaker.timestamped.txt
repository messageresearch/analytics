[0:00] Hello everyone. Pastor Paula Fontaine
[0:02] and Literal Life Church in Petersburg,
[0:04] Michigan would like to invite you to
[0:06] take the next half hour and enjoy some
[0:08] time in the word of God. If you're
[0:11] hungry for more God, we believe you can
[0:13] be fed. And we pray that you'll be
[0:16] blessed. Visit our website for more
[0:18] information at literalife.urch.
[0:21] May God bless you, my friend. May the
[0:23] music and message encourage you today.
[0:30] [Music]
[0:38] Oh,
[0:44] one more time.
[0:46] Oh,
[0:50] [Music]
[0:52] do it again. Sing it with us.
[0:55] Oh
[0:59] [Music]
[1:02] Lord, you know when I'm giving my all or
[1:06] when I'm giving.
[1:09] [Music]
[1:11] And you know when I'm trying, but my
[1:14] heart's not in it.
[1:19] I'm amazed by the grace that you have
[1:22] for me every day.
[1:25] [Music]
[1:28] How could I let myself give you less
[1:31] than my highest praise?
[1:35] I've seen what we've been through
[1:39] and how much I've been blessed
[1:43] by you.
[1:47] So I'll do my best to bring you glory.
[1:51] Give my all to tell your story. Praise
[1:56] you through the trials showing you're
[1:59] worth it all.
[2:02] Amen. Oh you have set me into my fire.
[2:08] Call me upon
[2:10] the water. You have called me to live
[2:14] higher. You gave your all.
[2:19] So I'll do my best.
[2:25] [Music]
[2:30] Oh,
[2:32] [Music]
[2:38] I will lift up my hands when the
[2:40] circumstance pulls me down.
[2:46] When the world tries to silence me, I
[2:49] will sing.
[2:52] [Music]
[2:54] I will turn up my praise in the face of
[2:58] my enemy.
[3:01] Amen.
[3:03] I will dance in my freedom even in
[3:06] captivity.
[3:09] Why? Because I've seen what we been
[3:13] through.
[3:15] and how much I've been blessed
[3:19] by you.
[3:22] So I'll do my best to bring you glory.
[3:26] Give my all and tell your story. Praise
[3:31] you through the trials. Show me you're
[3:35] worth it all.
[3:37] [Music]
[3:39] You have stepped into my fire. Pulled me
[3:44] up from the water. You have me to
[3:50] higher. You gave your own.
[3:54] So I'll do my best to bring you glory.
[3:59] Gave my all to tell your story. Praise
[4:04] you through the triumph. knowing you're
[4:08] worth it all.
[4:10] [Music]
[4:11] Lord, you have sent me into the fire
[4:16] upon
[4:18] the water. You have to higher. You gave
[4:24] your own.
[4:27] So I'll do my best. Oh.
[4:36] I'll do my best.
[4:44] I'll do my best.
[4:46] [Music]
[4:52] I'll do my best.
[5:02] Psalms 27:5. In the time of trouble, he
[5:06] shall hide me. In his pavilion, in the
[5:09] secret of his tabernacle shall he hide
[5:12] me. He shall set me up upon a rock. How
[5:16] many know that a rock in the Bible is
[5:19] type to a revelation. So he's he's not
[5:23] setting us up upon uh something that's
[5:25] not stable, but he's setting us up upon
[5:28] a revelation, something that'll stand
[5:30] the test of time. Jesus told Peter,
[5:32] "Upon this rock, I'll build my church, a
[5:34] revelation of him, and the gates of hell
[5:37] shall not prevail against a revelation."
[5:40] This is what's solid in our lives. Can
[5:42] you say amen? I want to add a scripture
[5:45] here in the Song of Solomon if I could.
[5:48] Chapter 7 and verse 10
[5:51] is the woman speaking and she says it'
[5:55] be Song of Solomon 7 and verse 10, I am
[5:59] my beloveds and his desire is toward me.
[6:04] And then she says in verse 11, come my
[6:06] beloved. In the beginning of the
[6:08] chapters, he's saying to his wife, his
[6:11] beloved, come away. He's calling her
[6:14] away. He's calling her away. Now, when
[6:16] she recognizes I am my beloveds and his
[6:18] desire is toward me, she's calling him
[6:22] to come away as well. I think that's a
[6:24] wonderful thing to recognize this
[6:25] morning that there's such a love affair
[6:28] between Christ and his bride that uh
[6:30] each of them are saying, "I have a
[6:32] desire for you and I have a desire to
[6:34] come away and be alone with you." This
[6:38] hidden secret place is actually the
[6:41] apex. It's actually the the finish. It's
[6:44] actually the final of all the history of
[6:47] Christianity and of all the history of
[6:50] the journey of Christians in every
[6:53] generation. This quiet place in Christ,
[6:56] this hidden place, this pavilion is
[6:58] actually the apex that a Christian comes
[7:01] to. It's the high an apex is the highest
[7:05] point a believer reaches. The apex is
[7:08] the highest point in anything, but it's
[7:10] the, if I'm calling it the apex, it's
[7:12] the highest point a believer reaches. It
[7:15] is above signs. It is above miracles. It
[7:19] is above miracles and signs and wonders.
[7:21] It is above all the great works of God.
[7:24] It is it is the apex. It's the highest
[7:27] point. It is above having everybody in a
[7:30] perfect dress code like the holiness
[7:32] groups. If we would get if we can get
[7:34] everybody just dressed right, then we've
[7:36] reached the apex. And there are some
[7:38] holiness groups. That's the apex. If we
[7:40] could have all the girls and the men and
[7:42] women dressed just right, that's the
[7:44] apex. But I'm here to tell you that's
[7:47] all important in the word of God. But
[7:48] it's not the apex. It's not the highest
[7:52] point.
[7:53] &gt;&gt; If that were the highest point, some of
[7:55] the other groups would do better than us
[7:57] in the dress. Can you say amen? But they
[7:59] make it the apex. And isn't it
[8:01] interesting that there are so many
[8:03] Christian groups that have made the
[8:05] highest point? so many things.
[8:09] And yet, the more I study it, this
[8:12] secret place in Christ,
[8:15] &gt;&gt; is the apex.
[8:18] &gt;&gt; And us believers know that it's so
[8:21] important and it sets the apex. It's the
[8:24] room, it's the secret place that brings
[8:27] forth the rapture. So, it's pretty
[8:29] important.
[8:30] &gt;&gt; It is the apex. It's the ultimate place.
[8:33] It's not the dress code being perfect.
[8:36] It's not uh this all ends with not not
[8:39] in a convention or a geographical place
[8:41] or we're going to all end up in
[8:43] Jeffersonville or we're it's going to
[8:45] end in climax in a camp meeting. That's
[8:47] the apex is a camp meeting or a
[8:49] convention or it doesn't apex in us
[8:52] being the best church in the world and I
[8:54] go to it. No, that's not the apex. Take
[8:58] take all the best of all the Bible and
[9:00] all that God has done through the Old
[9:02] Testament into the New to the upper room
[9:05] to a prophet being on earth to Jesus
[9:08] being on earth and the apex. It's not a
[9:10] time or a church or a certain age or a
[9:14] geographical location or some success.
[9:18] It is a secret place that the bride has
[9:21] been invited into. If you don't get
[9:24] anything else this morning, that's the
[9:26] apex of Christianity.
[9:29] &gt;&gt; You don't have to all say amen, but I've
[9:32] looked at this enough to realize after
[9:34] everything God has done, this is the
[9:37] highest point that a believer can reach.
[9:40] And we're at the end here, friends.
[9:42] &gt;&gt; I want to know what the highest point
[9:43] is. And guess what? I want to be there.
[9:45] Everything I've been preaching, say,
[9:46] Lord, bring me to live in that place
[9:48] every day and never come out of it.
[9:52] Amen.
[9:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The apex is not a time or
[9:56] church or location or success. It's a
[9:59] secret place. It is the highest point a
[10:01] believer can come to or reach to. And I
[10:04] want to refer to Enoch because Enoch was
[10:06] our type. How many believe Enoch was our
[10:08] type in the Bible? We have many types of
[10:10] the bride, but Enoch was definitely our
[10:12] type. And Enoch reached the apex. You
[10:15] can't get any better than a scripture
[10:17] saying, "And Enoch was not for God took
[10:20] him.
[10:22] And to us, that would probably be the
[10:23] apex is the rapture, the coming of the
[10:25] Lord, getting out of here. Can you say
[10:27] amen? I I'd say all Christians would
[10:30] agree our goal is heaven. Our goal is to
[10:32] be on the other side. What Christians
[10:33] miss though is that the apex isn't
[10:36] necessarily going to the other side. The
[10:38] apex is where we're living before we get
[10:40] to the other side. Because when we go to
[10:42] read Enoch and we read about his life,
[10:44] he does not have a huge biography.
[10:47] probably just two verses or three at the
[10:50] most of his life. And if we know that he
[10:52] made it in a rapture, that he was
[10:54] translated and was not for God took him,
[10:57] then when we go to read, we're looking
[10:58] at how was this guy, what was his apex
[11:01] before he got out of here? What was he
[11:03] doing before he got here? And we go to
[11:05] the scripture of our perfect type and
[11:07] we're curious, what kind of man is this?
[11:10] What kind of lifestyle is living before
[11:11] the rapture? Because he was raptured. Uh
[11:14] is he raising the dead? Uh, was he an
[11:16] influencer on social media? Did he reach
[11:19] any heights? How many hits did he get on
[11:21] his social media? Wh was he an influ was
[11:24] he a famous singer? Was he a famous
[11:26] preacher? What was his gifts? What was
[11:28] his talents? What was he doing before
[11:31] the rapture? Was he the biggest amener
[11:33] in church? Did he dance all over the
[11:35] building? What was he what was the apex
[11:38] of Enoch before the rapture? And the
[11:41] Bible just simply says before the
[11:44] rapture, he had this testimony that he
[11:47] pleased God and he walked with God.
[11:54] &gt;&gt; And we're we're curious. We're looking
[11:56] what was he doing just before the
[11:58] rapture and we're curious. We go and we
[11:59] read it for the first time. That's it.
[12:01] That's what he was doing.
[12:03] &gt;&gt; It wasn't miracles, signs, and wonders.
[12:05] And you you trust me now? We're always
[12:07] going to have miracles and signs and
[12:09] wonder. If God is among us, he's a God
[12:11] of the supernatural. He's always going
[12:13] to be doing the super supernatural. He's
[12:15] always going to be healing cancer like
[12:17] you did a few weeks ago with my sister,
[12:19] the tumor is completely gone. If God is
[12:22] among us, he's a supernatural God.
[12:25] But I'm not talking about that. I'm
[12:27] talking about what was Enoch doing
[12:29] before. What was the apex?
[12:32] &gt;&gt; And the apex, his biography is real
[12:35] short, like three verses. He walked with
[12:37] God
[12:39] &gt;&gt; and God took him
[12:40] &gt;&gt; and he pleased God.
[12:44] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[12:45] &gt;&gt; See, we don't make that the apex because
[12:48] we make all the other flashy stuff
[12:50] important. Can I get him? Can I get a
[12:52] witness this morning? That's it. He
[12:54] walked with God. That's it. He He
[12:57] pleased God. That was the apex. That was
[13:00] the highest point. And I want to be
[13:02] there. I want to bring in another
[13:04] element to it that we have not preached
[13:06] on in relation to the secret place. It's
[13:08] a place has been referred to as a place
[13:11] of refuge. It's a place of security.
[13:14] It's a place of God's protection and
[13:16] provision for believers. It's a place of
[13:20] finding refuge and and God in God's
[13:22] presence and refuge in God's promises.
[13:25] We heard that Wednesday night so
[13:27] beautifully that we need to be resting
[13:29] in one place and that's God's promise.
[13:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. We can't rest in the economy. We
[13:34] can't rest in family members. We can't
[13:36] even rest. Husbands and wives, you can't
[13:39] rest in anything but the promise of God.
[13:42] And you find your place. I'm I'm focused
[13:44] on the promise of God. I'm resting in
[13:46] the promise. And this is a place where
[13:48] you're resting in his presence. You're
[13:50] resting in his promises. It's resting in
[13:53] his uh completely in the promise. And we
[13:56] have a place to run from, as I've been
[13:57] preaching, from our struggles and from
[13:59] our troubles. It's a place to run. I'll
[14:02] tell you friends, this world is getting
[14:04] so busy. Uh did you know how many has
[14:07] read the last few days that the the
[14:08] earth is spinning faster,
[14:10] &gt;&gt; you know? I didn't need to hear that.
[14:12] But something is happening and global
[14:14] warming or whatever it is. They're
[14:16] messing with things and also the
[14:17] glaciers and all that and it's affecting
[14:19] our days a little bit and it's going to
[14:20] start doing that a little bit more. But
[14:22] our days are shorter. I didn't need to
[14:24] read that. I feel it. Right.
[14:27] &gt;&gt; I I I got up and Tuesday they said this
[14:30] last Tuesday we ended up with a shorter
[14:33] day just by a second or less than a
[14:35] second. Well, I needed that second. You
[14:38] know, I had a lot of stuff to get done.
[14:41] I don't need shorter days. I need longer
[14:43] ones. And we're ended up shredding.
[14:46] That's because this world is spinning
[14:48] faster. And then our heads are spinning
[14:50] because the earth is spinning faster.
[14:51] How many can say amen? You know, we we
[14:54] need to really uh look into this secret
[14:57] place because we're so busy, we can't
[15:00] get quiet alone with God.
[15:02] &gt;&gt; The world's spinning and and Tuesday, I
[15:04] know it happened Tuesday before I even
[15:05] read it in the article because Tuesday,
[15:08] it was a shorter day, they said. And I
[15:10] know it was because I got up in the
[15:11] morning, I brushed my teeth, I went and
[15:13] mowled my grass, then I took my mom out
[15:16] for a date as I do every Tuesday night.
[15:20] I love my mom.
[15:24] I loved her husband, too. He was like a
[15:25] father to me.
[15:30] Every Tuesday night, I mowed the grass.
[15:32] I took my mom out, and then I went to
[15:34] bed. So, I know I didn't get anything
[15:37] else done. That was it. I know the day
[15:39] was shorter, and it was frustrating cuz
[15:41] I had 10 other things I needed to get
[15:43] done. So, I know this is happening. And
[15:46] I know to tell you this morning if it's
[15:48] happening physically, but it's also
[15:50] happening that we're too busy to spend
[15:53] time alone with the Lord.
[15:58] &gt;&gt; True.
[15:59] &gt;&gt; I said we're so busy that time with the
[16:02] Lord is the last on the list.
[16:06] &gt;&gt; And somehow we got to get a revelation
[16:08] that it can't be the last on the list.
[16:11] &gt;&gt; And the times we're living, it's got to
[16:13] be the first on the list. Can I get an
[16:15] amen?
[16:16] &gt;&gt; It's got to be first. And I'm going to
[16:18] show you some of the deeper reasons why
[16:20] it needs to be first on your list. And
[16:22] so now we see then this other element I
[16:24] want to talk about here as the times get
[16:27] more stressful. Here is one thing that
[16:30] has been missed that I haven't talked
[16:31] about. And when I was reading the
[16:33] meanings of this pavilion, this quiet
[16:36] place, and what David talked about, all
[16:38] the other meanings I just gave, a place
[16:40] of protection, a place of rest, a place
[16:42] to run to, uh, a place of refreshment.
[16:45] But here's one thing that I I missed in
[16:48] this mystery of the hiding place. They
[16:50] called it, they said it is a place of
[16:52] intimacy and fellowship with him. I
[16:56] haven't talked about that yet, but to me
[16:58] when I read that intimacy and fellowship
[17:02] that actually the Lord, the reason that
[17:04] he's saying, "I'll hide you here and
[17:06] I'll call you here cuz really he wants
[17:09] intimacy with us.
[17:12] &gt;&gt; He wants fellowship with us.
[17:16] &gt;&gt; And if it's not our priority, it's
[17:18] certainly Christ's priority."
[17:20] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to show you how much today
[17:21] as I read the scripture in Song of
[17:23] Solomon, his desire is for me. his
[17:25] desires for my fellowship. We find that
[17:28] under the ministry that it's a place of
[17:30] intimacy and fellowship with him. A
[17:32] place alone with just you and him. The
[17:37] closest resemblance that we have of
[17:39] course to that of just being you and him
[17:42] or you and another person is marriage.
[17:45] Marriage is what God had on earth to
[17:48] reflect this this relationship that is
[17:51] an intimate relationship that is only
[17:54] shared between a husband and wife. God
[17:58] wrote that mystery in marriage on earth.
[18:01] But he was speaking of a greater mystery
[18:05] &gt;&gt; and that is that a husband and wife and
[18:08] I'm going to talk a little bit about
[18:09] that because if you didn't understand
[18:10] the world's twisted all the ideas of
[18:13] what marriage is. You got to go back
[18:14] what God said marriage is. And this is a
[18:17] place of intimacy. This is a place in
[18:19] marriage we know. Uh and let me just say
[18:23] without being too plain in front of the
[18:25] children today that there is an intimacy
[18:27] that's shared exclusively between a
[18:30] husband and wife. The husband and wife
[18:33] relationship is an exclusive
[18:35] relationship at so many levels including
[18:39] physical. But it is only two. Two in
[18:43] this close relationship. Can you say
[18:45] &gt;&gt; amen?
[18:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:47] &gt;&gt; It is only shared by two. I want you to
[18:49] just hold that thought now because
[18:50] that's what it is. And I just wanted to
[18:53] say while I'm on these subjects, I try
[18:55] to take the time to teach as well and
[18:58] remind people if you don't understand
[19:01] that concept real deeply, you should not
[19:04] get married yet.
[19:06] &gt;&gt; Right?
[19:07] &gt;&gt; What concept? that it is an intimacy to
[19:11] be shared
[19:13] by just you two. If you don't understand
[19:15] that that I wouldn't get married yet
[19:18] because there's a couple of demonic
[19:19] spirits in the world and the Bible calls
[19:21] them fornication and adultery. That's
[19:24] &gt;&gt; right.
[19:25] &gt;&gt; And those spirits are contrary to God's
[19:28] precept of sharing yourself and sharing
[19:30] your emotions and sharing your intimate
[19:33] details of your life and intimacy. God
[19:35] says it's only blessed in the state of
[19:38] marriage. It's only blessed by God after
[19:40] you say I do. Uh the sexual experience
[19:43] is only blessed in one place and that's
[19:45] in marriage, not before and not sharing
[19:48] it with someone else after.
[19:51] &gt;&gt; Come on now. I won't be don't get
[19:52] nervous on me. I won't be too plain. But
[19:54] you got to understand what I'm saying.
[19:56] God, just in case we don't know, it's
[19:58] not to be shared with two or three
[19:59] partners. You're not supposed to be just
[20:01] dating 10 people. Even young people are
[20:04] supposed to set their mind to say, "God,
[20:06] I'm praying because I'm to share all of
[20:08] my emotions, all of my pasts, everything
[20:10] that I am, my affections are being held
[20:13] and being kept to share with one person
[20:15] on the face of the earth. And that's the
[20:17] one person you gave me to share my life
[20:20] with. And when I say I do, I will share
[20:22] everything with them. And after I'm
[20:24] married, I will not share any of the
[20:26] rest of it with anybody else." Because
[20:28] the demonic spirits is fornication.
[20:31] doing that before the the wedding and
[20:33] then adultery after. And those two
[20:35] spirits
[20:37] are are are permeating in everything on
[20:41] this earth. The spirits of fornication
[20:43] and adultery means you share yourself
[20:44] with others besides just one. Things
[20:47] intended only for one in life are
[20:49] shared. Why do we have to understand
[20:51] this? Because the atmosphere is around
[20:53] us and on the web, worldwide web and on
[20:57] social media, the clips, the movies, the
[21:00] songs, the music, the books are
[21:03] contaminated with these two spirits of
[21:06] fornication and adultery to cause you to
[21:09] cheapen a relationship that's supposed
[21:12] to be exclusive.
[21:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[21:16] &gt;&gt; Are you listening? Those spirits are to
[21:19] cheapen a relationship that God wants to
[21:22] keep exclusive.
[21:25] Are you typing it with the spiritual
[21:27] now?
[21:28] &gt;&gt; God loves you so much and desires you so
[21:30] much. He doesn't want you sharing your
[21:32] heart with other gods.
[21:37] &gt;&gt; God doesn't want you be giving your
[21:39] affections to something greater than
[21:41] him. He wants your relationship to be
[21:44] exclusive.
[21:46] So if that's true in the natural, it's
[21:48] true in the spiritual. And you start
[21:49] tampering with those things in those
[21:51] spirits, whether by reading this or
[21:53] certain movies. And listen, I'm not
[21:54] going to get into details because the
[21:56] world's so full of it. You got to get
[21:57] the Holy Ghost and make your own
[21:59] decisions. But all I know is the more
[22:01] you feed on it, you'll weaken yourself
[22:03] as a Christian. You will weaken whatever
[22:05] God has given you. If you leave the
[22:08] services like this and go back to
[22:10] feeding on that, you'll weaken yourself.
[22:12] that that will become the dominant thing
[22:14] in your life. Oh, it doesn't bother me.
[22:17] Oh, I can watch this and it doesn't
[22:18] bother me. Well, uh, I'm sorry, but the
[22:20] way God has made us is that what we feed
[22:22] on is what we are. What we feed on is
[22:25] what we think about. What we feed on
[22:27] eventually becomes what we carry out and
[22:30] do.
[22:33] &gt;&gt; Just the way God made us. And this
[22:35] spirit is to cheapen a relationship
[22:37] that's exclusive. Every once in a while,
[22:39] I like to give reminders to our young
[22:41] people. There is one person, I hope
[22:43] you're listening and have enough
[22:45] confidence to listen to a gospel
[22:47] minister tell you. There is one person
[22:49] in life that will you will give your
[22:51] full heart, your full affections of life
[22:53] and physical intimacy. That's not meant
[22:56] for three. It's not meant for 10 to try
[22:58] out 10 of them before you get married.
[23:00] It's meant for one person in life. And
[23:03] you should say, "God, protect my
[23:06] innocence until that one person is
[23:09] there, and then I'll pour it out upon
[23:11] them. Amen.
[23:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:13] &gt;&gt; It's not to be shared. It's not to be
[23:15] played. And then after the commitment of
[23:17] I do at the ceremony, nothing before
[23:19] that. There's one place that's blessed
[23:21] and approved of God. I want to make it
[23:23] crystal clear. If you feed on those
[23:26] spirits of fornication every day on
[23:28] social media, on movies, if you take
[23:32] their mindset of sexual things, if you
[23:35] feed on those spirits of adultery over
[23:36] time, are you listening?
[23:40] You must be because you're quiet.
[23:42] &gt;&gt; You feed on those spirits of
[23:44] fornication, adultery, and all those
[23:46] clips. It eventually gets lodged in your
[23:50] spirit.
[23:52] &gt;&gt; You go for a while and you're just
[23:54] looking at it. But then the way God made
[23:55] the human being is you feed on something
[23:57] of that adultery or fornication spirit
[23:59] gets lodged in your spirit,
[24:01] &gt;&gt; right?
[24:03] &gt;&gt; And then you're now you're talking about
[24:04] a different thing because when it gets
[24:06] lodged in your spirit, lust is not
[24:08] satisfied. You can't get enough of
[24:10] looking at this stuff. You can't get
[24:11] enough of listening to the kind of music
[24:13] that's encouraging. You can't get enough
[24:15] of it. And so because lust is not
[24:17] satisfied, you keep going that
[24:18] direction. And so that's why you ended
[24:20] up in the fornication is over time it
[24:23] got lodged into your spirit and carried
[24:24] you to where you become possessed with
[24:27] it yourself and then you carry it out.
[24:28] Just like a demon, just like a demon now
[24:31] came into your spirit. Now I want to say
[24:33] this as a positive. Just like a demon
[24:35] can come into your spirit, a demon can
[24:37] be cast out of your spirit.
[24:40] &gt;&gt; Can I get an amen? Just like a demon
[24:42] comes into your spirit by what you feed
[24:44] on, a demon can be cast out of you by
[24:47] feeding on the right thing. By inviting
[24:49] your life into the Holy Ghost, inviting
[24:51] him into your life, you can be delivered
[24:54] of fornication spirit.
[24:57] &gt;&gt; It's not lodged in your spirit anymore.
[24:59] And if you want forgiveness and freedom
[25:01] from the Lord, God can do it. But don't
[25:04] say that I want to be delivered. I don't
[25:06] like living this way. Don't say you want
[25:08] deliverance and go back to your trash
[25:10] this week like a dog back to its vomit.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; It doesn't work that way. I don't like
[25:17] this. I want this off of me, but I'm
[25:19] coming up for prayer. When you come up
[25:21] for prayer, we're asking for a
[25:22] supernatural God to get that spirit
[25:24] lodged and take get it cast out
[25:26] somewhere else. But don't dare go back
[25:28] to the trash you're feeding on
[25:30] &gt;&gt; because you invite it back again.
[25:33] Jesus said, "A house is cleaned,
[25:36] completely sanctified, and because it
[25:38] didn't get filled, seven other demons
[25:40] come back and fill that house." It's
[25:42] just the way human beings work
[25:45] &gt;&gt; and you can invite the wrong things.
[25:47] What about married people? Should we
[25:49] just talk about the young people in
[25:50] fornication? Or should we mention that
[25:52] feeding on demons of adultery in books
[25:55] and the internet? No sense just warning
[25:58] the young people.
[26:00] &gt;&gt; We should warn the married couples. You
[26:02] will feed on adultery enough in subtle
[26:05] ways it gets lodged in your spirit and
[26:07] now the exclusive love for you that you
[26:10] have for the one you made a vow to
[26:13] begins to be shared.
[26:15] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[26:17] &gt;&gt; The oneness in the marriage is broken.
[26:19] No, there's no divorce yet. But the
[26:22] oneness has been broken because it's not
[26:25] exclusive anymore. The bedroom is for
[26:28] rest and it's for intimacy between
[26:30] husband and wife and no one else. Now,
[26:33] if that's what God's mind was for
[26:35] marriage on earth, if he was thinking
[26:37] that way, an exclusive intimacy between
[26:40] just two, then that's what he had in his
[26:43] mind even more for you and him. I'm
[26:46] finishing this series now. In the day of
[26:48] trouble, what does he say he will do?
[26:50] What am I going to do with the trouble
[26:51] you're facing? Well, how is God going to
[26:53] deal with it? I'll hide you in my
[26:54] pavilion. Is he going to just give me
[26:57] more superpower? Yeah, he'll power to
[26:59] overcome, but what's he going to do?
[27:00] I've got to hide you. I want to be alone
[27:02] with you. I want to fellowship with you
[27:04] that you can be refreshed. Can you say
[27:06] amen? And when Song of Solomon says
[27:08] this, I want to comment now as I close
[27:10] on Song of Solomon. You know, it's the
[27:13] most intimate eight chapters of the
[27:15] Bible. Some rabbis in the early day
[27:19] begin to tell people not to even read
[27:21] the Song of Solomon because it was just
[27:24] too graphic and too intimate. But then
[27:26] you look at it and the rabbis later some
[27:28] of them says
[27:30] they said first it makes the hands
[27:32] impure so don't read it, don't touch it.
[27:35] Then later as they begin to look they
[27:36] called it the most sacred chapters of
[27:40] the Bible.
[27:42] Why? Because there's a mystery in there
[27:45] about Christ and the bride exclusive
[27:49] relationship. When we really look at it,
[27:52] it's such a deep love between them and
[27:55] it is so deep. They both are meeting
[27:59] their deepest thirst in one another and
[28:04] no one else. God gives us a fountain for
[28:07] the deepest thirst within us.
