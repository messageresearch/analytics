[Music] life hey guy chapter 2 and verse three says who who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory and then we'll skip to verse n as he prophesies about this Temple the glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former saith the Lord of hosts and in this place will I give peace sayith the Lord of hosts and then over here in Zechariah 4 is also a prophecy concerning the same thing and this is when they were building rebuilding the foundation it is also a prophecy um verse six we'll start then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel saying not by might not nor by power but by my spirit sayith the Lord of hosts so you can you can just imagine imagine now that uh this is a bit of training or a bit of teaching the people of God to not just expect certain things and expect the power of God and him to work a certain way because God can do something in the simple things and uh it's not by power it's not by might so if him he says that we can kind of get in the mode that God only does something through might or by power but he he he he has different ways that he works sometimes in it's every bit as powerful when you speak of the power of the world then God doesn't use that when you speak of the power of the might God doesn't that but by his Spirit he can do anything amen can you say Amen who art thou oh great Mountain before Zer rubbable Thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it it's prophecy for our day moreover the word of the Lord came to me saying the hands of zerbo had laid the foundation of this house his hand shall also finish it and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts has sent me unto you for who hath despised the day of small things all of this prophecy talking about the rebuilding of the temple the foundation he's teaching it's not by power it's not by might it's by my spirit and don't you dare despise the day of small things because in this hour God can be every bit as powerful in small things we we'll miss it if we're looking just for big things the reality is is there that when he said uh in the scripture here look and compare when he said look at those of you who are with the first temple Solomon's Temple and there wasn't too many of them left but he said those of you who were there when the first temple was built and what happened and the glory of the Lord coming down and just not just that but the magnitude of it and the beauty of it and he's having them look and compare what you see with this first house and compare it with this second house this Temple that they begin to build uh the second one was not as big it was a smaller Temple and it it certainly did not have the Splendor of Solomon's first temple now Herod later on took the second temple he enhanced it he enlarged it he and he he did many things to it to make it bigger but when these brothers and sisters first seen it the second one being built the foundation and being built they actually were uh were going wow this this has nothing to compare with the first Temple and so I want you to just notice now uh if we look at things from the we can learn a lesson in this if we're looking at the glory of the past and what God has done in the past we could miss that God could do something greater in the future and so he's teaching them that look at this and compared with the glory of the first temple and then he ends it with a prophecy saying I can tell you and it's not just a prophecy about the final Temple for the Jews it's actually a prophecy for the bride because it's the the the latter Glory will be even greater than what you've seen in Solomon's Temple so the prophecy for the future Glory would be greater and imagine those people said wow what a prophecy is that because we were there at the beginning you couldn't get much greater glory than what we felt that day it was so powerful the preacher couldn't even preach the Holy Spirit came down in that place so they're looking and comparing it but then they're looking at the second building and saying that that does not have the Splendor it's not as big it's it doesn't have the uh uh the the the the way or the manner the beauty that was before and if you would have judged it by the second temple you would have thought there's no way that God could put more glory in this than the first one but that's judging carnally that's looking at the outside remember brother Bram says the beauty of the church is not the building it's the character of the people God looks at things different than what we do and God as we've been preaching can bring his glory in situations and so we're if we're mindful to be obedient to the Lord and walking in step with him we're available any time for God to do something in us and it doesn't have to you don't we don't have to blow our horn about it God just gets the glory can you say Amen so Herod expanded it he enhanced it later but the ones who looked at the at the first time they're say wow this is not as big and so it's a kind of a lesson tonight on human nature especially among Christians and I'll just say that it it's it's human nature to live in the glory of the past and belittle what we have now oh there's nothing can compare to all that God has done in my life before there's nothing compared to that that camp meeting that we had here that that year boy was that a year I don't mind testifying of it but sometimes we're looking back and thinking God can't do it again or God can't do more and you you don't realize you can belittle God you can put God in a box you can underestimate what God can do we've got to look forward and in this prophecy he said the glory in this Temple at the end at the latter will be a greater glory I'll tell you I don't want what I want had back then I want more than what I had back then I want to be close closer to the Lord now I want more of his glory to be how many would raise your hand tonight in agreement I don't want to reach back to that that was glorious but I want something more they garnish the tunes and oh wow the prophet Isaiah the prophet Moses he brought us the law and they're just going oh well this is great and they live in the past they live in the rivie mirr and they say nothing is ever as great as it is as it was back then Jesus said you garnish the tombs of the prophet and rejected what he was doing when he was around when Christ the word was around in in in the middle of them and God was in his fullness standing right and you can't get much greater glory than God put in all of himself catch it now God poured everything that he was into that one vessel not a temple not a building God took all of himself and put it in one individual all of the glory of God why I I'll take some of it I know it comes by measure but I'll take all the measure I get but that was powerful that he actually put it not in a building but he put it in one individual and he's standing there and he's telling them you garnish the tubes of the prophets and you can't even recognize the glory of God in his Temple right now because why human nature is to lift up he made strong statements like a greater than Solomon is here now so something greater was there in Jesus day then Solomon because they're going wow Moses David Solomon that's our guys that's the Glory Days there was it was a millennium when Solomon had the kingdom there wasn't no Rome around or anything he was he was a superpower all the nations feared him they looked back to the glory and what happened in that Temple they were they were gazing upon it and always looking back at it and yet Jesus is saying a greater than Solomon is here right now if we would have a reverence for that then we wouldn't be looking back and saying oh I wish I could work up that feeling I had at Camp 20 years ago no you'd be saying a greater than Solomon is here now he's greater tonight than he's ever been can you say amen and he's able to do above and beyond what we ask or think for our lives Hallelujah so some strong statements are greater than Solomon why the level of Glory became greater than a man with the spirit the level of Glory became greater than just a man with a spirit of Al elah and that's a great thing that God sends a man and puts the spirit of Elijah on him in fact he said Jesus said when he was talking about John the Baptist there's not a man that's risen greater than him as far as his office of a prophet he said and why did he say that because he introduced the first coming of Christ he's introducing the Messiah the Forerunner he says not there not a man among this born and woman but then he says he that's least in the kingdom is greater than John the bapti Baptist amen we don't read the rest of the scripture what's he saying in that when he makes that strong saying you know what he's saying he's saying sometimes in the smaller places it'll be a greater glory praise the Lord so he that's least in the Kingdom you might feel pretty low tonight but Jesus said he that's least in the kingdom of God uh is is is greater than him greater than this Prophet even so we serve God we serve a God that says the future is a greater glory than the past I'm going to say it again we must always serve a God and we do serve a god that is always that says the future has greater glory in it than even the past even than the days of a prophet Revelations 10 did not end at Revelations 10:7 it doesn't end with seven verses it ends with 11 verses it didn't end with the seven Angel the mystery did not end it does say the mystery of God should be finished but what is that what's the mystery of God Christ in you the hope of glory when you have Mysteries plural then we realize the seventh angel was used in this hour to finish the mysteries of God to finish the Loose Ends he was used for that and then because that vessel was there God uses the same vessel now God uses the same vessel to launch something something else and that's the bride coming into her position it's not just the Mysteries plural revealed but the mystery itself that Paul preached now will be restored and there'll be a bride on the face of the Earth that has the very mystery of God living in her Christ in you the hope of glory that's a greater glory Christ in you the hope of glory what's the whole hope of glory Christ being in you not Christ being in the prophet Christ in you young teenage boy Christ in you young teenage girl Christ in you old people like me Christ in us the hope of glory it didn't end on Revelations 10:7 but there's 11 verses and it's about a book and it's about John eating the book it's about ingesting and taking what God has brought from the other dimension to us it's ingesting it spiritually so we become the mystery of God revealed Paul said you're saying I'm of sephus I'm of Paul and everybody's splitting up into different favorite preachers he said no he said you know we we don't lift oursel up as ministers one plants one Waters God gives the increase and when we start getting into that mode where we lift up buildings and make the beauty out of there's one preacher higher than another we're in the same mode that human beings have all done always done and lifting lifting up the past and judging things by the size or the Splendor or the outward beauty of it it's that's not what God wants us to to look for it's the smaller things he can work through can you say Amen it's it's not the size of the dog in the fight it's the size of the fight in the dog can you say Amen it's how much fight the dog has inside of him so they're looking at this and then God prophesies that the end will be a greater glory but in a smaller place it doesn't look like it's anything and just to example this now go with me in your Bibles back to Ezra 3:12 and because this is actually WI it happened where zerubabel went back he's sent back by the uh by the Persian kings there he's given money he's given everything and uh God just moved apart upon these uh these Kings Hearts because it was time for restoration and so these Kings actually sent zerubabel and sent them with the money to begin the restoration of the temple it was really a work of God but in Ezra look what's happens here when they finally finish just the foundation of this new place not the not the temple yet verse 9 then stood jeshua with his sons and his Brethren camel and his sons and the sons of Judah together to set forward the workmen in the house of God the sons of hodad with their sons and their brother and the Levites and when the builders laid the foundation it's just the foundation when they laid the foundation of the Temple of the Lord they set the priests in their pray with trumpets and the Levites the sons of ASF with symbols to praise the Lord after ordinance of after the ordinance of David the king king of Israel and they sang together by chorus and praising and giving thanks unto the Lord because he is good for his mercy endureth forever toward Israel same song they were singing with all the children and the wives they didn't use the soldiers they actually sent them out with the weapon of worship how many enjoyed that God said I'm going to do it a different way I'm not going to use the soldiers but I'm going to go to battle and the enemy was already destroyed by the Praises of the people there's a weapon in worship can you say amen and so they did the same thing here it's the same words I wish somebody would write a song on this that because he is good for his mercy endureth forever this is what they sang all the time he is good for his mercy endureth forever some songwriter ought to write a song like that I feel there's plenty of them around here and all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised the Lord because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid but many of the priests and Levites and Chiefs of the fathers who were ancient men that had seen the first house when the foundation of this house was laid Before Their Eyes wept with a loud voice and many shouted aloud for Joy amen so there's a little distinction made here that the ones that were in the original Temple had a little trouble because they were maybe looking at it and they were crying because it wasn't quite up to par with what the first temple was so you got a mixture of things going on you you got people that are Weeping maybe because they're thinking of oh this is nice but oh was it so nice back there and this just isn't as good and you got people weeping but then you got people shouting for Joy because hey the foundation's being laid again we should be worshiping we should be glad we shouldn't be looking in the past can I get an amen tonight we shouldn't be weeping and looking back and saying oh but we missed the first one we should be saying God's Building the foundation again God's building a house again and I'll tell you I'll bring it up today God's Building a bride again God's laid the foundations with all the restor restoration of the word all the word has been restored I believe that but what did he do it for he's bringing back a bride full of the glory of God and we should be this is a different worship we should be shouting and rejoicing they were just looking at the foundation these people people were coming unglued shouting and dancing and they hadn't even seen the temple built yet just the foundation if you're building a new house that probably is the way it is just the foundation you start to say because the potential it's coming when you say God lay the foundation in people's lives you should rejoice in it well they don't have the Holy Ghost yet they haven't been filled with the glory you should Rejoice of whatever God does for them that young person gives their heart to the Lord you ought to be shouting rejoicing because heaven is can I get an amen tonight the only way thing that we have if they Rejoice on the other side is when a sinner comes to repentance and all of Heaven rejoices why can't we do that we should celebrate every move that a young person makes we should celebrate Every Soul that comes to the Lord and if it's just a foundation we still should SE celebrate amen praise the Lord but they wept aloud and then many shouted so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of Joy from the noise of weeping of the people for the people shouted with a loud shout and the noise was heard a far off so then we go back into uh Zachariah and then Zechariah 4 in the text we read do don't despise the day of small small things why is he saying that don't maybe it was these people that were weeping and now they're saying this this is not going to be as good this isn't going to be as big you guys should have seen the success of the first one and man you know sometimes we get that way where we look back at services in the past and I and and and so then we come to church kind of not under expectation like we should and praying that God could do something greater we cannot get in that mode of looking back we can't say oh the glory of that because I got to be looking what does God want to do today not just in church you got to get up Monday morning and say Lord I'm Available to you and we we feel insufficient sometimes but some of the simplest things that have been given to us through the word to teach our children if we're just putting them before our kids that's a blessing in itself they they should feel privileged and we should be privileged that we have a word to give them we have a token to apply to our homes can you say Amen praise the Lord so we should be available but but he he's saying uh don't despise the day of small things what's he saying don't underestimate you're looking at this Temple saying that's not like it was at the beginning and this it's so much smaller in size but don't underestimate what God can do with simple faith and smaller buildings don't apply his greatness to big things to Big preachers to Big camps to big numbers in this final work of the Lord and I'd like you to listen listen just now in this final work of the Lord that he's doing he is downsizing the place downsizing the numbers but increasing the power uh Charles Spurgeon the prince of preachers made some comments about this particular scripture in hegi and that it holds a mystery of why God did not allow that second temple to be greater in splendor because what what the distinction in Hagi is in the prophecy is that the building won't be any won't be greater in splendor but the glory will be greater it's God teaching them something and God actually Spurgeon is bringing it and I do believe it is that God actually is teaching because he's he's making that second temple less impressive to them because he wants to teach them you're coming into another dimension that it won't even be a physical temple they're going to come into the dimension that the temples will be that will be bodies can you say Amen will be human beings and so he's getting him ready for that so so uh why wasn't the second temple more magnificent was there an economic downturns supply chain issues is that why it wasn't as nice the issue wasn't a lack of funding to make that thing because even the money given by the family heads had had had not been enough and the degree came from Darius in Ezra 6 uh and it meant that they would have all the financial resources needed to restore the temple to its for for of Glory just a little history now they had all the finances to restore it to its original Splendor that Temple the issue wasn't a lack of political sport uh support Cyrus actually approved plans for the second temple to be bigger Cyrus actually approved plans for the second temple to be bigger than the first one so somebody God is behind this and it's not going to be bigger until Herod made it Herod made it bigger later but it wasn't be there they approved plans for the second temple to be bigger than the first one twice as high three times as wide but then they would have looked at it and said oh man this is going to be greater based upon the building and not looking for the glory of God so if money was no object and there was no bureaucratic red tape and they had all the permits they needed to build a huge magnificent Temple why didn't they and Spurgeon comments he says Charles Spurgeon had it been God Providence that a temple equally magnificent as the first should be built it might have been easily accomplished but God and God in his Providence is not arranged that it should be so and that though Herod lavished a good deal of treasure on the second temple for the pleasure of the nation he ruled and and to gain some favor from them he profaned the temple more than he had adorned it and actually became Pro profaned by the Jews themselves as Jesus begin to whip the money changers out and he said you've taken my temple and made it a den of Thieves and this is has a purpose to be a House of Prayer I got a little sermon I preach temples that lose their purpose and it ain't talking about buildings it's talking about individuals that lose the whole idea that you're the Temple of the Living God and it became about the money changers and sometimes in people's lives they start out good with the Lord then it becomes about money then it becomes about running after success then it becomes about the Mighty Dollar then it becomes this that and family and all the other things and their house their house their Spirit gets full of the things of the world and the values of the world and I wonder Jesus has to come sometimes and whip all those money changers out of your temple and say this is not what you were built for this is not what God's purpose is for your life can I get an amen tonight sometimes the word rebukes us cuz we get carnally and worldly minded and he takes his whip out and he whips the money changers out and say you forgot you're actually supposed to be a temple of glory and a temple of prayer thank you for watching our service today if you would
