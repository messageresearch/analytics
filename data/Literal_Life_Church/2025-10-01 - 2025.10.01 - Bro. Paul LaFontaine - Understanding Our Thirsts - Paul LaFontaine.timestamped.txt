[19:43] only you can fill.
[19:47] A raging tempest
[19:51] only you can still.
[19:56] My soul is thirsty, Lord, to know you as
[20:00] I know.
[20:04] Drink from the river
[20:07] that flows before your throne. Let that
[20:11] be your desire. Just take me deeper,
[20:17] deeper in love
[20:19] with you,
[20:22] Jesus. Hold me close in your embrace.
[20:30] Take me deeper,
[20:34] deeper than I've ever been before. Lord,
[20:38] I just want to love you more and more.
[20:42] How I long
[20:45] to be deeper
[20:47] in love. Sunrise to sunrise,
[20:52] sunrise to sunrise.
[20:55] Lord, I will seek your face.
[21:01] Drawn by the spirit
[21:04] to the promise of your grace.
[21:09] My heart is found in you. A hope that
[21:14] will abide
[21:18] here in your presence. Forever
[21:22] satisfied.
[21:27] Take me deeper,
[21:31] deeper in love,
[21:36] Jesus.
[21:39] Your embrace.
[21:42] Thank you, Lord. You take me deeper,
[21:47] deeper than I've ever been before.
[21:53] love you more and more
[21:56] how I long.
[21:58] Oh, can we sing it one more time and
[22:01] make it our deepest prayer tonight?
[22:04] Lord, take me deeper,
[22:08] deeper in love with you,
[22:14] Jesus. Hold me close to your embrace.
[22:19] Come and teach us tonight, Lord.
[22:23] Take me deeper, deeper than I've ever
[22:27] been before.
[22:30] Love you more and more.
[22:34] How I long
[22:36] to be deeper
[22:38] in love.
[22:42] Amen. Praise be to God. That's our
[22:44] desire tonight from the depths of our
[22:46] hearts to him. And the word is never has
[22:49] it's an inexhaustible fountain and it
[22:52] never uh can never you just always sat
[22:55] never satisfi you are satisfied but
[22:57] there's always more he has for us. So
[22:59] that's
[23:00] &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians chapter 2 and just uh one
[23:04] verse
[23:06] in verse 11. Lest Satan should get an
[23:09] advantage of us for we are not ignorant
[23:13] of his devices. Just hold that scripture
[23:16] in your heart. less Satan should get an
[23:18] advant how many would say I don't want
[23:19] Satan to have the advantage on me I want
[23:22] to have the advantage on the devil and
[23:24] then he says we are not ignorant of his
[23:26] devices there's another scripture I
[23:28] found this afternoon Proverbs chapter 20
[23:31] and verse 5 and is related to the
[23:34] subject tonight and uh never seen this
[23:36] before but just one little scripture
[23:38] that has some good depth to it Proverbs
[23:41] 20 and verse 5
[23:45] counsel in the heart of man is like deep
[23:48] water, but a man of understanding will
[23:51] draw out. Counsel in the heart of is
[23:54] like deep water, but a a man of
[23:56] understanding will draw out. The very
[24:00] reason uh that he's drawing out and
[24:03] going to the right fountain and actually
[24:05] doing the exercise of drawing out means
[24:08] that he's a man of understanding. He's a
[24:10] man of understanding to know what he
[24:13] needs. He's a man of understanding that
[24:15] knows where to go to get what he needs
[24:18] and he goes and gets it. He draws it
[24:20] out. And in our talk about uh our
[24:24] thirst, we want to continue on with that
[24:25] tonight. I thought that was a wonderful
[24:27] scripture. A man of understanding will
[24:29] not just know that he has a thirst, but
[24:31] he'll actually go draw out of the well
[24:34] that will quench the thirst. All of us
[24:36] will do that. Heavenly Father, bless
[24:38] your word and strengthen the people of
[24:41] God tonight wherever they may be
[24:42] listening here or abroad. We commit the
[24:45] service to you and our lives to you in
[24:47] Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. May be
[24:50] seated. Thanks for coming tonight.
[24:52] Thanks for listening in and may the Lord
[24:54] bleach bless each and every one of us.
[24:56] Um
[24:58] 2 Corinthians chapter 2 and 11 talking
[25:01] about the the devil having an advantage
[25:04] over us. Um, I I guess if I were to
[25:06] reward it tonight, I would say that
[25:08] ignorance, when he says we're not
[25:11] ignorant of Satan's devices, then it's
[25:13] really saying that when we have
[25:16] ignorance, it puts us as at a
[25:18] disadvantage to the enemy. So, the thing
[25:21] that causes us to have a disadvantage on
[25:23] the uh from the enemy is that we have a
[25:26] lack of understanding. God does not want
[25:28] us to be ignorant. And the first thing
[25:30] that he wants to deposit in us is
[25:32] revelation. How many know revelation
[25:34] goes beyond head knowledge? It's not
[25:36] just that you understand something up
[25:38] here, but it's a it's something he drops
[25:40] right from his throne uh and he gives it
[25:43] to us. But that doesn't cancel out God
[25:46] using our our thinking and stuff to
[25:49] influence because the mind is the womb
[25:51] to the soul. So it has to start
[25:52] somewhere. So you don't say, "Well, I
[25:54] just need a revelation and everything
[25:56] else." No. Uh the scripture says that we
[25:58] would be transformed by the renewing of
[26:01] our mind. So our thinking and our minds
[26:03] as a matter of fact that's the thing
[26:05] that gets in the way sometimes even of
[26:07] revelation is our own thinking and the
[26:09] way we think about stuff. So now
[26:11] ignorance whether it's a a lack of
[26:13] revelation or a lack of understanding of
[26:17] uh seeing things causes the devil to
[26:20] have an advantage over us. And Paul is
[26:23] just real clear less Satan should have
[26:26] an advantage. We don't want the enemy,
[26:29] any of us, we don't want the enemy to
[26:31] have an advantage over our lives. And
[26:33] thus, we don't want to be ignorant of
[26:36] his devices. Um, and I preach to young
[26:39] people about that because we have many
[26:41] devices today, but it's not just devices
[26:43] of phones and iPads and everything else
[26:46] and computers. Uh, that's devices as we
[26:48] know it. But Satan's devices is tr
[26:51] trickery and the tricks and the and his
[26:54] ways. Satan's ways. how he deceives, how
[26:57] he tempts, his manner, how he gets at
[27:00] you, how he can just put the right thing
[27:02] in front of you to tempt you. And it's
[27:04] not just tempting everybody else. You
[27:06] actually learn how he tempts you.
[27:07] Because remember, we were saying last
[27:09] Wednesday night that you're unique.
[27:11] You're different. Satan has studied you.
[27:13] And so now he knows how to trick or try
[27:15] to tempt you, even you individually. He
[27:17] knows what makes you fall. He knows what
[27:19] makes you get up. He knows what uh uh ma
[27:22] makes you tick because he's studied you.
[27:24] So now when Satan is ahead of us in
[27:27] understanding deep things or the depth
[27:29] of ourselves, he can have the advantage
[27:32] over us. And that's my theme. So I want
[27:33] to just add a bit of teaching to last
[27:36] Wednesday night. We also spoke a little
[27:38] bit of these things very more specific
[27:40] to the men as the women weren't there
[27:43] and we were able to be uh pretty open
[27:45] with them about this and a man's thirst
[27:47] and uh how Satan tries to fill a man's
[27:50] thirst uniquely to a man. And he does
[27:52] the same thing to a woman too. her
[27:54] thirst. So, we'll talk about that
[27:56] tonight just a little bit. But, uh, we
[27:58] spoke down there at God filling a man's
[28:00] thirst, deepest thirst. And so, uh,
[28:02] tonight I want to go back over some
[28:04] things and some of this be will be a
[28:05] little bit of repeat from last Tuesday
[28:07] night, but I want to just bring you back
[28:09] into thinking about it. There are
[28:11] God-given thirst that God has placed
[28:14] within us. They are God-given. He gave
[28:17] them to us. We are are born with those
[28:19] things. And because they come from God,
[28:22] they're not impure. They're actually
[28:24] pure. They start out pure. Um, we have
[28:27] thirsts within us and longings and needs
[28:30] within us, both natural and spiritual.
[28:33] Um, we have physical thirst. We have
[28:36] emotional thirst that are within us. And
[28:38] then we have spiritual as well. And they
[28:40] are all needs that are within us. And
[28:43] then we learned last Wednesday that
[28:44] there are levels of these thirst. There
[28:46] are some that's on the outside a thirst
[28:48] or a hungry a hunger to be fed. In other
[28:51] words, we get hungry. uh that's in the
[28:53] body and then in our emotions of five uh
[28:56] inlets to the emotions of see taste feel
[28:59] smell here but the emotional the spirit
[29:01] realm has five inlets of memory
[29:04] imagination conscious effects and
[29:05] reasoning. So in those in our spirit is
[29:08] actually um like a vacuum or it it
[29:11] actually is a thirst within us something
[29:13] that we need in those areas. And so now
[29:16] there are levels cuz some are services,
[29:18] some are deep and some needs that we
[29:20] have are obvious. And you'll remember I
[29:22] went through this last Wednesday night.
[29:23] So just pretend you haven't heard it
[29:25] before. Just shout amen like it's the
[29:27] first time you ever heard it. Some needs
[29:30] that you have are obvious
[29:33] and the warning signs are obvious. the
[29:35] alarms and so you get hungry of course
[29:38] the alarm goes off on the inside so it's
[29:39] obvious you need to get something to
[29:41] eat. Some needs are deeper in our life
[29:44] like spiritual emotional and they're not
[29:46] as easily detected. They're not as
[29:49] easily seen and the alarm maybe you
[29:52] can't hear it as strong. So that's why
[29:54] we have to go on a journey to to say
[29:56] Lord show me my needs. Let me go to you
[29:58] with my needs and let me understand the
[30:01] thirsts that are within me. Some needs
[30:03] are deeper than our spirit and they're
[30:05] harder to detect and to know what you
[30:08] need and when you need it and what you
[30:10] need to fulfill that and what is needed
[30:13] to quench that need. And the prophet
[30:16] mentioned in the message thirst, he
[30:17] mentioned the thirst for success, a
[30:19] thirst for fellowship. Uh he he talks
[30:22] about it's not uh uh it's not strange
[30:26] for a young man and young woman to be
[30:28] attracted to one another and to fall in
[30:30] love with one another and to desire one
[30:32] another and to be married. That's all a
[30:34] normal thirst God put within us and to
[30:37] to have one another to share with uh not
[30:40] only life together but share everything
[30:42] together even physically. So that's a a
[30:44] pure thirst that's within man and within
[30:47] woman. He talks about a thirst for
[30:49] success, a thirst for fellowship, for
[30:51] companionship. He thought uh talks about
[30:54] um uh different things. Uh and we know
[30:57] there's a man's uh there's a man's
[30:59] thirst for woman and for fellowship and
[31:01] companion. And then there's a a woman's
[31:03] thirst for man and for what he would
[31:05] fulfill, that husband would fulfill in
[31:07] her life. God provides that. He talks
[31:09] about fellowship. He talks about a woman
[31:12] having a thirst for beauty and having a
[31:14] thirst to be pretty and even enjoys the
[31:17] attention of being uh complimented for
[31:20] being pretty. A woman that's a natural
[31:22] thirst within her to want to be pretty
[31:25] and to want to know that she's pretty,
[31:27] especially from her husband and maybe
[31:30] her boyfriend as time goes along. Uh
[31:32] that's a natural thing. She loves to
[31:34] hear that. She she feeds off of that
[31:36] more than a a man does not have that
[31:38] thirst to want to be pretty. This is
[31:40] where the difference is in a man and
[31:42] woman. But but we know that over time
[31:45] Satan has learned all these thirst and a
[31:48] thirst for beauty and women. We know
[31:50] that he can misdirect a woman to fill
[31:54] that thirst by the wrong attention and
[31:57] also wearing the wrong thing cuz she
[31:59] knows she's learned to fill that thirst.
[32:02] I can wear this certain thing and I can
[32:03] get a lot of attention. Well, it might
[32:05] be the wrong attention. Might be the
[32:07] wrong kind of character. And so women of
[32:10] the world, it's it's all a natural
[32:12] thirst they're born with. But look how
[32:14] they have all different ways. And we'll
[32:16] talk about that in just a minute uh and
[32:18] bring a scripture for it. But he said
[32:20] there's a thirst for that. There's a
[32:21] thirst for joy. There's a thirst for
[32:23] happiness. There's a thirst for
[32:24] friendship. All natural thirst. And then
[32:27] God, as I said last Wednesday night, God
[32:30] not only put these things within us, but
[32:32] he provides also Godgiven fountains for
[32:35] each of these to quench them purely. God
[32:38] provides for you to be truly satisfied
[32:42] in what God provides for that particular
[32:44] thirst.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; So we understand that now. And so then
[32:48] we took it on to say in order for Satan
[32:51] to be so good to develop other sources
[32:54] to quench our God-given thirst, Satan
[32:57] would have to and not only provide a
[32:59] place to drink from that, but to make it
[33:01] very appealing. Satan is very good to
[33:04] make that appealing that you would
[33:06] actually choose something besides what
[33:07] God has for you. You'd choose something
[33:09] else. Have to be pretty appealing. So on
[33:11] the outside, he can make it very
[33:12] attractive. And so he's working off a
[33:15] deep thirst within you, but he's made it
[33:17] very attractive that that's the answer.
[33:20] Go quench my thirst in that. And so you
[33:22] run after it because he's made it so
[33:24] appealing. But also, he would have to
[33:27] understand a man and a woman and
[33:29] understand the human being. As I said
[33:31] last Wednesday night, he has a master's
[33:33] degree in the study of human beings for
[33:35] 6,000 years. He knows uh he knows you.
[33:40] He knows mankind.
[33:43] And here's what I want to say. It's bad
[33:45] when he knows mankind and how our brain
[33:47] works and how our body works and how our
[33:50] spirit works and how our emotions work.
[33:52] It's bad when he knows those things more
[33:54] than you.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; Then we're at a disadvantage. But he's
[33:58] had a long time to study it. He knows
[34:01] how to tempt it. And guess what? He
[34:02] knows the differences in men and women.
[34:05] News flash, men and women are different.
[34:13] Women are uh they're I should I should
[34:16] say they're both I should say women are
[34:19] they're different for sure. But anyway,
[34:20] men and women they're they're different.
[34:22] And boy, women are a different deal. Um
[34:25] they women, you know, respectfully, they
[34:27] don't want you to solve their problems.
[34:29] They just want to talk about the
[34:30] problems. They feel better about that.
[34:32] Women can go to a closet full of clothes
[34:35] and say, "I don't have nothing to wear."
[34:39] And when you figure out, brothers, when
[34:41] you figure out women, please come and
[34:45] tell me and you can do a service on and
[34:47] help us all out. They're quite
[34:49] different. You know why I'm saying that
[34:51] though, and we laugh about it, it's
[34:52] because it's it's a it we have to really
[34:55] lay our lives before God and pray that
[34:58] we have an understanding of how
[35:00] different they are than us. And Paul
[35:02] says it in the scripture, I've got it
[35:03] later on here, but he brings that out
[35:05] and he says, "We have to dwell with them
[35:08] according to what?" According to
[35:10] knowledge. We have to understanding as
[35:13] being joints together in this walk of
[35:16] faith in the Lord. They're not they're
[35:18] they're they're co-equal in our faith
[35:20] together with the Lord. They're they're
[35:21] a weaker vessel, but not when it comes
[35:23] to a daughter of God. They're not a
[35:25] weaker vessel. Only the vessel. But when
[35:27] when they come when it comes to a
[35:29] daughter of God, they're co-equal with
[35:31] us and and inheritors of the faith
[35:33] together. So a man has to he has been
[35:36] told you not only study yourself and
[35:38] understand yourself but you study and
[35:41] you understand and dwell with a woman
[35:43] according to knowledge and do not get
[35:46] bitter against them or your prayers will
[35:47] be hindered. So what's he encouraging?
[35:50] What's he saying? He's saying that we
[35:52] have a a a lifelong sacrifice and a a
[35:55] prayer to make and say God give me
[35:58] knowledge and understanding. He said
[36:00] that in Hosea, "My people are destroyed
[36:03] for lack of knowledge." My people are
[36:06] destroyed for lack of knowledge. And I
[36:08] believe that means more than just mental
[36:10] knowledge. It's a revelation. But
[36:12] anytime you're lacking it and you have
[36:14] ignorance, the devil's going to have an
[36:15] advantage on you. So here he is saying,
[36:17] "Dwell with women according to
[36:19] knowledge, you're on a lifelong to earn
[36:21] a degree to learn what how God has made
[36:24] this special vessel and that you dwell
[36:27] with them according to knowledge." If
[36:28] you just say, "Well, they need to be
[36:29] like me." And you say, "Their needs are
[36:31] like my needs, and you just need to meet
[36:33] my needs." You're missing it, brother,
[36:34] because you're seeing God's telling you,
[36:36] you also study how God has specially and
[36:39] uniquely made this other vessel of
[36:42] woman. And you can dwell together when
[36:44] you understand that more. And the woman
[36:46] understand the man because he's not like
[36:48] you either. Thank God he's not like you.
[36:50] And thank God the women aren't like the
[36:52] man. And and God is a God of variety.
[36:55] Can you say amen? I better move on here.
[36:57] I'm going to get in trouble. I I know
[36:58] I'm going to just say something that I
[37:00] shouldn't say. So now, uh,
[37:05] Satan understands the body. Satan
[37:09] understands psychology. Satan
[37:11] understands the behavior of human
[37:12] beings. Has had a long time to study it.
[37:15] And he's he has studied uh how a human
[37:18] being works. It's kind of like a boxer
[37:20] who studies his opponent for many weeks
[37:22] or months. Football teams watch the
[37:24] video of the other team they're going to
[37:26] be playing. How many guys know that?
[37:28] They study the videos. The coach goes
[37:30] through the videos. So, this is how
[37:31] their plays are. They study the plays of
[37:33] the opponent. They know how they're
[37:35] going to hit. And so, in defense,
[37:36] they're going to work around and try to
[37:38] come against how they study the videos
[37:40] of it. So, football teams do it. Armies,
[37:43] armies study how the enemy works.
[37:47] &gt;&gt; Armies just they they they do all kinds
[37:50] of study to say, "Now, who are we going
[37:52] up against? And how do they fight? what
[37:54] kind of uh uh uh instruments are they
[37:57] going to use? What kind of uh guns are
[37:59] they going to use? Where are they going
[38:00] to come at us? What side? And so they
[38:02] study. So if armies do it, football
[38:04] teams and all these other things, we
[38:06] ought to have a a personal
[38:08] understanding. The devil has studied
[38:11] human beings. He's studied you. And I
[38:13] know I said this last Wednesday night,
[38:14] but I want to just lay it down. Satan
[38:17] has studied even you since your birth.
[38:19] And he understands how you tick.
[38:23] He understands your weaknesses. He
[38:25] understand what gets you down and
[38:26] depresses you. He understands that maybe
[38:29] you're a a high you would score high
[38:31] rejection on a test and you got high
[38:34] rejection issues and brother Brandon
[38:36] mentions a man that's maybe a little
[38:38] more highly passioned. Uh so even levels
[38:42] of men there's one more higher passion
[38:44] the other one. All of men desire a woman
[38:46] and that's a natural desire but some are
[38:48] more high passion. He says he's in he'll
[38:50] be in trouble all the time because he's
[38:52] been built that way. These highly
[38:54] passionate uh women have different
[38:57] things. And so Satan knows these
[38:59] different bents, these slants and even
[39:02] the different bents in you bents in you
[39:04] and what attracts you and what gets you
[39:07] up and what depresses you, what brings
[39:09] you down and what is I'm going to say
[39:11] this again. What is in your past that
[39:12] affects you? Uh, Satan knows what
[39:15] affects you from your past and triggers
[39:18] also your mistakes in life. He knows how
[39:20] to take your mistakes that that are
[39:22] under the blood and pull them out, bring
[39:24] them to your mind and knows how to
[39:26] defeat you by that past mistake. He
[39:28] studied how to do that. It might be he
[39:30] he has a song playing in the restaurant
[39:33] that's one of the old songs back from
[39:35] the 70s and he songs playing and all of
[39:38] a sudden all these things get triggered
[39:39] in your memory and it brings you back
[39:41] when you're into the world and all that.
[39:43] He knows how to do it. And as I said
[39:45] that when they do commercials and stuff,
[39:46] they know how to get things in our mind.
[39:48] And also, he knows how to trigger the
[39:50] mistakes in your life. He has a file on
[39:53] your life. He studies it. He pulls it
[39:55] out when he needs it. And he said, "Let
[39:58] me look this person over again and all
[40:00] their mistakes and all that they have
[40:01] done. What is their story? And I'm going
[40:04] to take all that. I'm going to use it
[40:06] against them again." That's when Satan
[40:08] has an advantage over us. My point is is
[40:11] that if he has taken that long and that
[40:13] much time to study you, then we ought to
[40:16] study God. We ought to study ourselves.
[40:19] We ought to know how we tick. We ought
[40:20] to know our ups and downs. I lean a
[40:23] little bit this way. There was a
[40:24] testimony, I think, on one of the
[40:26] telegrams this week in the church uh of
[40:28] somebody sharing that and their tendency
[40:30] towards uh depression and different
[40:33] things. I appreciate the openness and
[40:35] honesty of the sister who shared that as
[40:38] she begins to people begin to recognize
[40:40] how they're made up, how the devil can
[40:42] defeat them as they do that. There can
[40:44] only be a victory down the road because
[40:46] you got the devil's number. Can I Can I
[40:48] get an amen tonight? He's not just got
[40:51] your number. You got his number.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; You're on his trail. I know how the
[40:54] devil's going to use this to to press me
[40:57] and I'm going to be all over it. I'm not
[40:58] going to go that direction. Brother Bram
[41:00] said to overcome something do the
[41:02] opposite.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; If you're selfish then he said then give
[41:06] all the time and that counters that
[41:07] thing. Sometimes the antidote sometimes
[41:10] it's doing the opposite of what you
[41:12] think. Can you say amen? What your bent
[41:13] is Satan? I'm going to do the opposite
[41:15] of what that bent is and that's how you
[41:17] counter it sometimes. The Lord has
[41:19] certainly showed us many wonderful
[41:20] things. So he has studied the inner
[41:22] thirst of us. He knows those inner
[41:24] thirsts. And then we find then that I
[41:28] just wanted to get a little bit more
[41:29] specific tonight. When we look at the
[41:31] thirst that's within us. Uh then we
[41:34] realize that sometimes the problems or
[41:37] the mistakes in life or trouble with
[41:39] other people or hiccups in life. We look
[41:42] for reasons and we look sometimes for
[41:44] surface reasons and we look to maybe
[41:46] blame others and blame the
[41:48] circumstances. But I want us to grow
[41:50] deeper than that.
[41:52] I want us as a congregation to grow
[41:54] deeper than just a shallow conclusion.
[41:57] Somebody did me wrong or I got in. I
[42:00] made this mistake because and the
[42:02] reasons are all surfaced. Sometimes you
[42:05] fall into things because you had an
[42:08] inner thirst that was not being
[42:10] fulfilled right.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; And if you look deeper in yourself, you
[42:15] might say, "Maybe it's not everybody
[42:17] else's problem. Maybe I wouldn't have
[42:18] got into that. there there's an inner
[42:20] thirst within me and I was trying to
[42:22] meet a thirst that was that was laying
[42:24] there and that whole situation could
[42:27] have been different maybe if I knew
[42:28] myself a little deeper is that okay so
[42:31] we see then we blame others we blame
[42:34] circumstances but most of the time you
[42:36] have a deep need or thirst inside that's
[42:37] not being quenched and that's why it
[42:39] happens so you have to look inward what
[42:42] was lacking in me what was lacking in my
[42:45] heart why did I fall I was preaching on
[42:48] David a couple Wednesday nights ago. And
[42:50] I don't know, we don't have much on his
[42:51] story as far as what led up to David's
[42:54] sin with Bashibba. We we we know a
[42:57] little bit. We we don't know much. I've
[42:58] given a few things and we preach on a
[43:00] few things. He relax when he was
[43:02] supposed to go to battle, all those
[43:03] things, but we really don't know what
[43:05] led up to him coming one night when he's
[43:08] looking at Bashibba and then falls in
[43:10] sin with her. What led up to it? Cuz I
[43:13] can tell you the way we're built as
[43:14] human beings, David was built the same
[43:16] way. And it didn't just start in a
[43:19] moment of lust. Something began way back
[43:23] that David was not addressing.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; It never happens that it's just a
[43:28] one-time event. And oh, and I'm
[43:31] wondering if David, the kind of man that
[43:33] he was speaking later about the deep
[43:36] call to the deep and speaking later
[43:38] about thirst and then Solomon, his son,
[43:40] begins to speak deeper about thirst. And
[43:42] I'm going to read those things in a
[43:43] minute. But I wonder if David, we don't
[43:45] have a lot of scripture for it, but I
[43:47] wonder through some of the things he
[43:49] said afterwards, even in his repentance,
[43:52] because you know, in his repentance, uh,
[43:54] you know, he said some things, you know,
[43:56] his repentance wasn't like, you know,
[43:58] some of my grandkids is just, I'm sorry.
[44:01] Say, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. David's
[44:04] repentance was so deep. I'm going to
[44:07] read it.
[44:09] Psalm 51.
[44:11] Psalm 51.
[44:15] Have mercy on me, oh God, according to
[44:17] thy loving kindness, according unto the
[44:19] multitude of thy timber mercies. Blot
[44:21] out my transgressions. Wash me
[44:24] thoroughly.
[44:26] That's not just saying, "Okay, let's
[44:27] let's get this over with and let me get
[44:29] back to my kingdom. Get back." No. No.
[44:31] Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity and
[44:34] cleanse me from my sin. For I
[44:36] acknowledge my transgressions and my sin
[44:38] is ever before me. Look at the reality
[44:40] of that. God's going to wash away his
[44:42] sin, but something about it is always
[44:44] going to be before me. And that's part
[44:46] of it. That's part of it, too. He's
[44:49] being honest. Against thee. Thee only
[44:51] have I sinned and done this evil in thy
[44:53] sight. That thou mightest be justified
[44:55] when thou speakest, and be clear when
[44:56] thou judgeest. Behold, I was shaped in
[44:59] iniquity, and in sin did my mother
[45:00] conceive me. Behold, thou desireest
[45:02] truth in the inward parts, and in the
[45:05] hidden part, thou shalt make me to know
[45:06] wisdom. I'm not so sure that David had
[45:09] the depth to say something like verse
[45:14] six until after he had come with through
[45:17] this terrible sin that he had done and
[45:20] needed to be forgiven of it. I'm not
[45:22] sure sure he is this deep to say this.
[45:24] Lord, thou desires truth in the inward
[45:27] part
[45:30] &gt;&gt; and in the hidden part thou shalt make
[45:32] me to know wisdom. What's he saying? The
[45:34] same thing I'm preaching tonight. I need
[45:36] wisdom and understanding about the depth
[45:38] of me,
[45:40] &gt;&gt; the inside parts. Because is he saying
[45:42] with that is he saying that this
[45:44] happened because something was missing
[45:47] deep inside. There was a thirst not
[45:49] being quenched.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; But he's learned here that this isn't
[45:53] just about something surface. This isn't
[45:55] just lust. It turned into lust. And when
[45:58] lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth
[46:00] sin. How many know that's Bible? When
[46:02] lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth
[46:04] sin. But it doesn't start with lust. It
[46:07] starts maybe with a thirst that's not
[46:09] being quenched in the right place.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; Purge me with hissup and I shall be
[46:14] clean. Wash me. I shall be whiter than
[46:16] snow. Make me to hear joy and gladness
[46:19] that the bones which thouast broken may
[46:21] rejoice. Hide thy face from my sins and
[46:23] blot out all my iniquities. Create in me
[46:26] a clean heart, oh God, and renew a right
[46:28] spirit within me. That's a strong
[46:30] statement because what's he saying?
[46:32] Something in my spirit wasn't right.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; Create in me a clean heart, oh Lord, and
[46:38] renew the right spirit within me.
[46:41] Something was wrong. It wasn't just a
[46:43] man's eyes that got a in lust attracted
[46:46] Bath Sheba. It was deeper than that.
[46:48] He's saying something in my spirit was
[46:50] wrong.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; Something was not being quenched. And
[46:53] he's saying that in his repentance. And
[46:55] what a repentance. Because it's not just
[46:57] saying, "Sorry, I looked at a woman and
[46:59] I killed her husband." And no, there's
[47:01] sincerity in this. And there's a depth
[47:03] of looking at his life to say, "Lord,
[47:06] let me see this, where it come from, why
[47:10] I did it, so that I'll never do it
[47:12] again." That's repentance.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; It's not falling into the same hole. He
[47:17] didn't go back and fall into the same
[47:18] hole. No, he's saying, "Lord, purge me
[47:21] and clean me." And he says something
[47:23] here later on that uh uh said verse 11,
[47:25] "Cast me not away from thy presence.
[47:27] Take not the Holy Spirit from me.
[47:29] restored to me the joy of thy salvation.
[47:31] We know it's been said it didn't that he
[47:33] wasn't asking for a salvation. He was
[47:35] asking for the joy of it and uphold me
[47:37] with thy free spirit. Then will I teach
[47:39] transgressors thy ways and sinners shall
[47:42] be converted unto thee. Deliver me from
[47:44] blood guiltiness. Oh God, thou God of my
[47:46] salvation. My tongue shall sing aloud of
[47:48] thy righteousness. Oh Lord, open thou my
[47:51] lips and my mouth shall show forth thy
[47:53] praise. For thou desireest not sacrifice
[47:56] else would I give it. Thou delightest
[47:59] not in burnt offering. The sacrifices of
[48:02] God are a broken spirit, a broken and
[48:06] contrite heart. Is he saying that I had
[48:09] some pride
[48:11] and the pride is got me into
[48:15] committing adultery with a woman?
[48:19] I didn't have a contrite heart. Is he
[48:22] saying that?
[48:24] Do good in thy good pleasure under Zion.
[48:26] And I love this. You know, you've heard
[48:28] me preach on this before. Build thou the
[48:30] walls of Jerusalem. What a revelation.
[48:33] You know what he's saying? He wasn't
[48:35] talking about the temple. In fact, it
[48:37] wasn't even built yet. He wasn't talking
[48:39] about a literal temple. He's talking
[48:40] about I'm the temple now. Look what
[48:42] happened to the temple. What's going on
[48:44] in the temple and I don't want it to
[48:46] ever happen again. And so, I'm saying
[48:49] build strong walls of protection around
[48:52] me that I'll never sin like this again.
[48:55] That's a repentance, friends. Thou shalt
[48:58] then thou shalt be pleased with
[48:59] sacrifices of righteousness when when
[49:02] with burnt offerings and whole burnt
[49:04] offerings, then shall they offer
[49:06] bollocks on thine altar? So why did I
[49:11] fall?
[49:13] What was lacking in me that made me do
[49:15] this?
[49:17] Why did I choose to drink from the wrong
[49:19] fountain, Lord? What was I thirsting
[49:22] for? And why didn't I find out how God
[49:24] could quench it first? Why did I drink
[49:26] from something else? These are questions
[49:29] that a shallow person does not ask.
[49:34] Why did I do this? Why did I fall? I
[49:36] know I fell and I go, I know God has
[49:38] forgiven me, but what led me to it?
[49:43] &gt;&gt; Why did I fall? What thirst was not
[49:45] being met by the Lord?
[49:49] So, you know, uh there's a lot of data
[49:52] out there. Let me talk about the men
[49:53] real quickly first. I'm doing good. It's
[49:55] only 10 to 8. Let me talk about and I
[49:58] I'll try. We got a mixed audience here,
[49:59] so I won't be as as plain as I was with
[50:02] the men down there, but we have a lot of
[50:05] uh thing research now that breaks down
[50:09] the science of a man. How a man ticks,
[50:12] how a man is attracted to certain
[50:14] things. He's different than a a woman.
[50:16] the needs of a man are different than a
[50:18] woman. And all this is out there and I
[50:20] don't have to tell you the data. The
[50:21] data is out there. The data is out there
[50:24] now of the damage of pornography.
[50:28] Now, the world don't care about that
[50:30] data. But I think sons of God should
[50:33] care. I think sons of God should care
[50:37] that there's statistics and things that
[50:39] are related to the biology, the mental
[50:42] thing, the mind, everything that happens
[50:44] and why it happens. And if that is out
[50:46] there and there's all this time to prove
[50:48] it and the damage it does to the
[50:50] thinking process and everything, we
[50:52] should be concerned as sons and
[50:53] daughters of God that we want to
[50:56] understand because our brain and our
[50:58] thinking is not to be manipulated by
[51:01] Satan. Our brain is not to fall into an
[51:04] addiction.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; An addiction is related to parts of our
[51:08] brain where our pleasure center is
[51:11] activated by the wrong thing for too
[51:13] long. Can you say amen? And so because
[51:16] of this scripture in Romans, be
[51:18] transformed by the renewing of the mind.
[51:20] We can conclude that many times the
[51:22] distance between you and the fountains
[51:24] and the springs of God to quench your
[51:26] thirst. The only thing in between that
[51:28] is the mind. It gets in the way if it
[51:31] does not know or understand. Our brain
[51:33] is made up of three areas. The cortex,
[51:36] the preffrontal cortex, and the lyic
[51:39] system. The cortex only as thick as six
[51:42] business cards but stores our higher
[51:45] reasoning. The prefrontal cortex where
[51:48] decisions are made. Our brain makes five
[51:50] trillion decisions every second. This
[51:52] area of the brain is not fully developed
[51:54] until around the age of 25. Might be
[51:57] good to wait to get married till then.
[52:00] That's what brother Barry would say. Um
[52:03] then the lyic system is where we
[52:06] experience
[52:08] you know if I was Steven's true brother
[52:09] rap or some of these guys I' I'd have a
[52:11] nice you know powerpoint tonight of this
[52:14] so you can see it. The limbic part of
[52:16] our brain is where we experience
[52:17] pleasure and memories form as we repeat
[52:20] or not repeat. It's far more powerful
[52:23] than our preffrontal cortex. Did you see
[52:26] what that said? It's more powerful than
[52:28] our prefrontal cortex where our
[52:30] decisions are made. So now if we
[52:32] activate the pleasure center in the
[52:34] wrong way with the wrong thing for too
[52:36] long it it actually numbs and undermines
[52:39] the thinking
[52:41] part of our brain.
[52:43] It doesn't even bring up the higher
[52:45] reasoning the cortex but but uh
[52:48] addictions
[52:50] whatever it may be this is what it does.
[52:53] It activates the pleasure center in the
[52:55] wrong way. Normal natural things are to
[52:57] activate the pleasure center. We have
[52:59] normal things in life. normal things
[53:00] that God has provided, normal pleasures
[53:02] of this life. But when you start messing
[53:04] with something that's unnatural, that's
[53:07] not organic, but it's something
[53:08] synthetic. It's something that's created
[53:11] by Satan, or I shouldn't say creative,
[53:12] but developed, whether it would be a
[53:14] Hollywood movie or some type of thing
[53:16] that you keep feeding on.
[53:19] It messes with the brain. Pornography
[53:22] messes with the brain. And I believe
[53:25] Satan can have an advantage over us if
[53:27] we don't understand how that works and
[53:29] stand strong and say, "Wait a minute. My
[53:31] mind is not a garbage can. My mind is
[53:34] not to be manipulated by Hollywood and
[53:37] Hollywood's music and Hollywood spirits.
[53:39] This brain, this body belongs to the
[53:42] Lord Jesus Christ. And I stand here as a
[53:44] son and daughter of God to give all of
[53:46] my being." Jesus said, "To love me with
[53:48] all your heart, soul, mind, and
[53:51] strength. everything that I am. You
[53:54] can't be a Christian, come to God and
[53:55] raise your hands, you give your hands,
[53:57] you give your heart, but all week you
[53:59] give your mind to all kinds of trash.
[54:01] And some of it is can be wholesome, but
[54:03] there's too much of it. And you're doing
[54:05] it just to pleasure yourself in your
[54:07] brain, and it can still have damage.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[54:16] One writer says, "When a man looks at
[54:17] porn,
[54:19] he is often trying to meet needs such as
[54:21] relief from anxiety or stress. To escape
[54:25] from emotional distress like loneliness
[54:27] or boredom or or a desire for fantasy,
[54:30] control, or power. When you want to
[54:32] escape real life because it's
[54:34] disappointing and discouraging to you,
[54:36] then you go into the fantasy world."
[54:39] You, you know, some of the women would
[54:41] say, "That's right. That's what those
[54:42] men do. They live in a fantasy. But you
[54:45] women can go to romance novels
[54:47] sometimes. Or you can go to social media
[54:50] and you might do it for the same reason.
[54:52] Cuz you're tired of life and you want to
[54:54] go into a fantasy world and it's a lot
[54:56] more enjoyable to read about the man and
[54:59] woman in the book.
[55:02] Cuz your marriage is not that good.
[55:06] Ph. I better find a back door to get out
[55:08] of here tonight. This is really heavy
[55:10] duty.
[55:12] Fantasy control or power with the effort
[55:14] or emotional risk of real relationship.
[55:16] Look what it says now. A man will do it
[55:18] for the desire for fantasy, a desire for
[55:20] control or power without the effort or
[55:24] emotional risk of a real relationship.
[55:26] Because in a real relationship, there's
[55:28] risk. Love is hard sometimes, real love.
[55:31] While porn can provide immediate
[55:33] gratification and a sense of being
[55:35] desired, using it as a primary coping
[55:39] mechanism can shift sexual preferences,
[55:42] reduce the entrance in the interest in
[55:45] and capacity for real life intimacy. And
[55:49] there's the key word, there's the deeper
[55:52] thirst.
[55:54] It it it it will reduce the interest in
[55:57] the capacity for real life intimacy.
[56:00] Could it be that's the real thirst?
[56:03] Looking for real life intimacy, not
[56:05] getting it from your own fountains, and
[56:07] then it leads to feelings of shame and
[56:09] isolation. Boy, I tell you, the devil
[56:11] just does such damage because he
[56:13] attracts you to something that's going
[56:14] to be some temporary fantasy. It's going
[56:17] to make you feel good, but then you
[56:18] leave. He leaves you with all the guilt
[56:20] and condemnation and all that goes with
[56:23] it, and it never fully satisfies. You
[56:25] know why? Because you go away with
[56:26] condemnation.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; And he knows that. He knows that he's
[56:31] got this figured out. Don't mean to give
[56:34] him too much credit tonight, but he has
[56:36] got these things figured out. So, it
[56:39] mentioned stress and l lust and many
[56:41] more things that drive a man to fall,
[56:43] but that's all surface. Turn with me if
[56:45] you would to Proverbs chapter 7.
[56:50] Could it be that the need for intimacy?
[56:51] You say, "Well, intimacy, let's the
[56:53] world says intimacy is sexually
[56:55] relations, but intimacy is not sexual
[56:58] relations. It's a bonding. It's a close
[57:00] bond. It's a connection. And when
[57:03] somebody's spirit gets distant from a
[57:05] real connection in life, especially a
[57:07] man, he withdraws himself. And I just
[57:11] want to break this down for the man and
[57:12] then if I have time, I'll talk about the
[57:14] woman's thirst a little bit and how uh a
[57:17] woman can come on to tap into these
[57:19] thirsts. Proverbs, well, we'll just go
[57:21] to Proverbs
[57:23] um
[57:26] 7 first.
[57:31] Verse six.
[57:33] For at the window of my house I look
[57:34] through my casement, and behold, among
[57:37] the simple ones, I discerned among the
[57:39] youths a man void of what?
[57:45] A young man void of what?
[57:49] So he's a young man, you know, he's
[57:52] young and vibrant and he's got, you
[57:54] know, everything there, but he's void of
[57:57] one thing and that's understanding. And
[57:59] in the next few scriptures, you're going
[58:00] to see what he's going to fall into and
[58:02] susceptible to because
[58:06] he doesn't have understanding of what's
[58:08] going to happen. So he's a man, he's got
[58:11] hormones, he's got all these other
[58:12] things. And so he's got he's got his
[58:14] eyes that are attracted by by sight. Men
[58:16] are attracted by sight. So, he's got all
[58:18] of that, but he's void of understanding.
[58:20] So, now he's going to fall into a trap
[58:22] here because he has a lack of what I'm
[58:24] preaching about tonight. I'm preaching
[58:26] about being people of understanding of
[58:28] what our thirst are. And because he
[58:30] doesn't understand his thirst and the
[58:32] woman that's going to come onto him, she
[58:34] understands by the anointing of the
[58:36] devil, she understands what a man's
[58:39] thirst is,
[58:40] &gt;&gt; but he doesn't.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; Passing through the street corn uh
[58:44] street near her corner, that was the
[58:45] first mistake. He was passing by her
[58:48] corner and he went the way to her house
[58:52] in the twilight in the evening in the
[58:54] black in the dark night. That's not
[58:56] good. And it's interesting how many
[58:59] things happen in the night in the dark.
[59:03] Temptation happens a lot of times. Then
[59:06] he goes and behold there met him a woman
[59:08] with the attire of a harlot and subtle
[59:11] of the heart. Number one, she appeals to
[59:13] man's
[59:15] man. The way that man's built is he's
[59:17] attracted by sight. So the first thing
[59:21] that she uses to attract him to that
[59:24] thirst and the way God's made him is to
[59:26] appeal to him by what she's wearing.
[59:28] It's all surface. It's all outward. But
[59:31] she knows it. And a harlot knows it. And
[59:33] the women of the world know it. And
[59:35] that's why godly women should not buy
[59:36] into that. You don't want to attract the
[59:38] wrong man. You don't want to wear
[59:40] something. thing. You don't want to have
[59:41] to wear tight skirts and slit skirts up
[59:43] to showing your leg and you don't want
[59:45] to wear tight clothes and stuff like
[59:46] that because you're attracting the wrong
[59:48] attention. You don't know what modesty
[59:50] is and you don't know that you could be
[59:52] wearing the attire of a harlot and
[59:53] you're not even a harlot and you're
[59:56] drawing the wrong attention. So that's
[59:58] the first thing she appeals to. She is
[1:00:00] loud and stubborn. Her feet abide not in
[1:00:02] her house. Now is she without now in the
[1:00:05] streets and lith and the weight in every
[1:00:06] corner. She's come out now to meet him.
[1:00:08] So she caught him and kissed him and
[1:00:10] with an imputent face said unto him,
[1:00:12] remember men are you know physical as
[1:00:14] well. So now her kissing him uh I think
[1:00:17] brother Bram said one place that he said
[1:00:21] you you can't um you can't have that
[1:00:23] happen without it bringing something up
[1:00:25] in a man. And I'm I'm generalizing but
[1:00:27] he's saying you can't have that touch
[1:00:29] you can't have that happening. He was
[1:00:30] talking about us all at church. He says,
[1:00:32] uh, somebody asked him that, um, should
[1:00:36] we do like the Bible when they they
[1:00:38] greeted one another with a holy kiss?
[1:00:41] And that was the greeting back then. And
[1:00:43] brother Ben says, "Oh, no, no, no. Don't
[1:00:45] get that started. It'll lead to
[1:00:46] homosexuals and everything just to get
[1:00:48] it started. Aren't you glad for a
[1:00:50] prophet to nip things in the bud where
[1:00:52] it's going to start something? It
[1:00:54] doesn't mean all that's happening, but
[1:00:55] it can grow into that because why the
[1:00:58] men and women now all of a sudden you're
[1:00:59] hugging somebody after church that's
[1:01:01] different than your wife and you're
[1:01:02] kissing somebody that's different than
[1:01:04] your husband. It's it's all supposed to
[1:01:06] be innocent but eventually it's not
[1:01:07] innocent. It's not innocent. Can you say
[1:01:10] amen?
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, you know, he can't
[1:01:14] be how how brother Brandon worded. I
[1:01:16] didn't get a chance to look this up, but
[1:01:18] a red-blooded male and not have this
[1:01:20] happen and not be affected in your body
[1:01:23] about it. Why? Cuz it's the way God made
[1:01:25] you. Is that thing that you're made is
[1:01:27] that impure? No. It's impure how Satan's
[1:01:30] trying to get him to use it in the wrong
[1:01:32] way. Go down the wrong path. Look what
[1:01:35] she does now. She said, she caught him
[1:01:37] and kissed him and with an imputed face
[1:01:38] said unto him, I have peace offerings
[1:01:41] with me this day have and have paid my
[1:01:44] vows. Therefore came I for to meet thee
[1:01:46] diligently to seek thy face. And I have
[1:01:48] found thee. I have decked my bed with
[1:01:51] coverings of tapestry, with carved
[1:01:53] works, with the fine living of Egypt. I
[1:01:56] have perfumed my bed. It's pretty direct
[1:01:59] now. I have perfumed my bed with myrr,
[1:02:02] alos, and cinnamon. Stop right there.
[1:02:05] Second thing, man has a stronger urge
[1:02:08] towards sexual relations than a woman.
[1:02:11] She's appealing to this thirst that's
[1:02:14] within him by saying, "I've got the bed
[1:02:16] ready."
[1:02:18] So, she's she's appealing to the thirst.
[1:02:21] Men are attracted by sight. She's
[1:02:23] appealing to his thirst to be with a
[1:02:24] woman. But let's go deeper.
[1:02:28] Come and let us take our fill of love
[1:02:33] until the morning. You know what this
[1:02:35] is? This is her version of love. It's
[1:02:38] not true love. But could it be that once
[1:02:41] again the devil is recognizing there's
[1:02:43] something deeper within him and she said
[1:02:45] I she's saying I together we can fill
[1:02:49] this thirst for love.
[1:02:54] This is the thing that just struck me.
[1:02:55] Let us soulless solace. I don't know how
[1:02:58] to say that. Let us soloulless ourselves
[1:03:01] with loves. That's the key. That's the
[1:03:03] key word. Soulless ourselves with love.
[1:03:06] Beyond the appeal to man's eyes and the
[1:03:08] potential for a sexual relation to
[1:03:10] fulfill his sexual drive, something
[1:03:12] deeper is going on. When she says, "Let
[1:03:14] us solace oursel together." It means
[1:03:17] solace means to give comfort to in a
[1:03:20] grief or a misfortune.
[1:03:25] It means the alleviation of grief or
[1:03:27] anxiety
[1:03:29] and to make cheerful again. It's only
[1:03:32] going to be a tempor temporal cheerful.
[1:03:34] But she's saying, "I can meet this
[1:03:36] thirst for your anxiety, for your need
[1:03:40] for soulless. You need comfort. You're
[1:03:43] you're feeling low. Sometimes a man
[1:03:45] feels low because he's not successful as
[1:03:47] he thought he would be and his spirit is
[1:03:50] low. And you're very vulnerable during
[1:03:51] those times. You better go to the Lord
[1:03:53] right away because you're vulnerable
[1:03:55] when your spirit gets low." A lot of
[1:03:56] times a man won't tell anybody else that
[1:03:58] his spirit is low. But when you get real
[1:04:01] low in your spirit and there's a need,
[1:04:03] there is a thirst for comfort for
[1:04:08] comfort for the grief or anx or a
[1:04:10] misfortune that's happened to you.
[1:04:14] I can make you cheerful. It's a source.
[1:04:16] A solless is a source of relief or
[1:04:18] consolation. She is the deception that
[1:04:21] this place she invites him to will fill
[1:04:24] all of these thirst and fill all these
[1:04:26] needs. How does she know that? Satan
[1:04:30] anoints her that this is man's
[1:04:32] particular needs and she becomes the
[1:04:35] temptation. I'm going to meet those
[1:04:37] needs even for solace.
[1:04:42] Praise the Lord. But then if you go back
[1:04:44] to chapter five says the same thing.
[1:04:46] Verse 5, my son, attend to my wisdom and
[1:04:49] bow thy ear to understand that thou
[1:04:51] mayest regard discretion that thy lips
[1:04:52] may keep knowledge. For the lips of a
[1:04:55] strange woman drop as a honeycomb in her
[1:04:57] mouth. Wait a minute. I didn't finish
[1:04:58] seven yet. Wait a minute. I didn't
[1:04:59] finish and I got plenty of time here. Go
[1:05:02] back to seven. Please don't leave.
[1:05:07] Don't get scared.
[1:05:09] Don't be scared. Be frightened.
[1:05:13] I didn't finish what how this guy ends
[1:05:15] up. Come, let us take our fill loves.
[1:05:17] 7:18. Until the morning, let us solstish
[1:05:20] ourselves with loves for the goodman is
[1:05:21] not home. He has gone a long journey. He
[1:05:23] hath taken a bag of money with him and
[1:05:25] will come home at the day appointed.
[1:05:26] With her much fair speech she caused him
[1:05:29] to yield. With a flattering of her limps
[1:05:31] she forced him. He goeth after her
[1:05:34] straightway as an ox goeth to the
[1:05:36] slaughter.
[1:05:38] Anybody seen an ox come back from the
[1:05:40] slaughter?
[1:05:42] Or as a fool to the correction of the
[1:05:44] stocks, till a dart strike through his
[1:05:46] liver as a bird hasteth to the snare and
[1:05:48] knoweth not that this is for his life.
[1:05:51] Hearken unto me now, therefore, oh ye
[1:05:53] children, and attend the words of my
[1:05:54] mouth. Let not thy heart decline to her
[1:05:56] ways. Go not astray in her paths, for
[1:05:59] she hath cast down many, say it,
[1:06:02] wounded. She's cast down many wounded.
[1:06:04] Yay. And many strong men have been slain
[1:06:07] by her. Her house is the way to hell,
[1:06:11] going down to the chambers of death.
[1:06:13] Chapter 5 and verse two. For the lips of
[1:06:16] a strange woman drop as a honeycomb, and
[1:06:18] her mouth is smoother than oil, but her
[1:06:21] end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a
[1:06:23] two-edged sword. Her feet go down to
[1:06:25] death. Her steps take gold on hell.
[1:06:27] Strange woman is mentioned several
[1:06:29] several times in Proverbs. It's also
[1:06:31] mentioned in Jude that after they left
[1:06:34] God, they went after strange flesh.
[1:06:35] That's the term strange flesh. Strange
[1:06:38] woman is any other woman than your wife.
[1:06:41] Strange flesh is something that God
[1:06:43] hasn't provided. It's strange to you and
[1:06:45] you're seeking after it. Whether it's a
[1:06:47] physical woman or man or whether it's on
[1:06:49] the the TV or in a book or on porn, it's
[1:06:53] the strange woman. Why is she strange?
[1:06:56] Why is it strange? Because it's a
[1:06:58] fountain that God hasn't provided for
[1:07:01] your thirst. Satan has provided it.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Lest thou should ponder the path of
[1:07:09] life. Her waves are movable that thou
[1:07:12] cut not know them. Hear me now therefore
[1:07:14] children and depart from the words of
[1:07:15] thy mouth. Depart not from the words of
[1:07:17] my mouth. Remove thy way from her and
[1:07:19] come not nigh the door of her house.
[1:07:22] Lest thou give her on thine honor unto
[1:07:24] others and thy years unto cruel. Lest
[1:07:26] strangers be filled with thy wealth and
[1:07:28] thy labors be the house of a stranger.
[1:07:31] And thou mourn at the last when thy
[1:07:33] flesh and thy body are consumed and say
[1:07:36] there's nothing good about the fruits
[1:07:37] that come from this friends. There's
[1:07:39] nothing good. And he loses his money and
[1:07:42] everything. Sometimes his inheritance is
[1:07:45] shared with others. It affects his whole
[1:07:47] life.
[1:07:49] And say, "How have I hated instruction?
[1:07:51] My heart despised reproof." That's what
[1:07:53] he's saying now. "If I have not obeys
[1:07:54] the voice of my teachers, nor inclined
[1:07:56] my ear to them that instruct me. I was
[1:07:58] almost an evil in the midst of the
[1:07:59] congregation and assembly." And then he
[1:08:02] says, verse 15, you've heard me read
[1:08:04] this before. Drink waters out of thine
[1:08:06] own and running waters out of thy own
[1:08:08] well. Let thy fountains be dispersed
[1:08:10] abroad and rivers of water in the
[1:08:12] streets. Let them be only thine only and
[1:08:14] not strangers with thee. Let thy
[1:08:16] fountain be blessed and rejoice with the
[1:08:19] wife of thy youth. What is that saying?
[1:08:23] God has given you springs
[1:08:26] and fountains that you bring all of your
[1:08:29] thirst to. And whenever you deny those
[1:08:32] and go to another one, it's nothing but
[1:08:34] trouble.
[1:08:36] He provides fountains to drink from of
[1:08:38] satisfaction, of joy. My wife is the
[1:08:41] fountain God gave me.
[1:08:44] Enjoy the life of thy youth. Your
[1:08:47] children are fountains that God has
[1:08:49] given you. Your grandchildren are
[1:08:51] wonderful fountains to drink from for
[1:08:54] satisfaction and happiness.
[1:08:57] He's encouraged us to go to them. Can
[1:08:58] you say amen?
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Just one last note
[1:09:02] about what brother Brandham says here
[1:09:04] about the woman's effect on a man. They
[1:09:07] don't have this up here, but what is any
[1:09:09] sweeter in a man's life?
[1:09:12] What is any sweeter than to come home
[1:09:14] when he's tired and weary with his
[1:09:17] little bucket in his hand from working
[1:09:19] all day and plowing or whatever he might
[1:09:21] be doing to walk in and have a lovely
[1:09:23] wife to meet him at the door, sit down
[1:09:26] on his lap a minute, brush his brow a
[1:09:29] little and kiss him on the cheek and put
[1:09:31] her arms around him and say, "Dear, I
[1:09:34] know you're tired. You've worked so
[1:09:36] hard." Give him consolation. It gives
[1:09:41] him consolation. And that solless that
[1:09:43] that woman's trying to meet is supposed
[1:09:45] to be met in his wife.
[1:09:48] Consolation. Soloulless.
[1:09:51] Amen. What about the women?
[1:09:53] Of course, this is something I didn't
[1:09:54] get into at the men's meeting,
[1:09:58] but since I have more time here,
[1:10:01] the man is supposed to seek
[1:10:03] understanding of her as well. 1 Peter
[1:10:05] 3:7. First Peter 3:7. Likewise, ye
[1:10:08] husbands, dwell with them according to
[1:10:09] knowledge, giving honor unto the wife as
[1:10:11] unto the weaker vessel, as being heirs
[1:10:14] together of the grace of life, that your
[1:10:16] prayers be not hindered. So, let me just
[1:10:20] mention these scriptures to you instead
[1:10:22] of going to them. We go all the way back
[1:10:25] to Genesis 3 when Eve was led on by the
[1:10:28] serpent. You know what the serpent used?
[1:10:33] Sure, they got into a sexual
[1:10:34] relationship, but it didn't start there.
[1:10:36] He used words to entice. Why? Because a
[1:10:40] woman, she's highly deceived, but she's
[1:10:43] attracted to words.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; She's attracted by words. And he uses
[1:10:48] words. He's appealing to the thirst in a
[1:10:51] woman to draw security from words. And
[1:10:55] when God says, "You will die." In other
[1:10:58] words, that serpent asked Eve, "Yeah,
[1:11:01] what what God said?" And and Eve repeats
[1:11:04] the word, God said that if we are to eat
[1:11:07] of that tree, we will die. And the
[1:11:11] serpent comes back and says, "You shall
[1:11:14] not surely die."
[1:11:16] You know what that appealed to her?
[1:11:20] Because a woman has a thirst to hear
[1:11:23] words, but also she's she's she's
[1:11:25] appealed to words, but she a woman has a
[1:11:28] thirst for security. A a woman has a
[1:11:31] thirst for peace and not to feel
[1:11:32] anxiety. A woman has a thirst to
[1:11:35] something to settle and so maybe in her
[1:11:38] spirit you shall not surely die. But he
[1:11:41] says, you know what, you're not going to
[1:11:43] die. Well, that feels like a little bit
[1:11:44] of relief. Okay, we're not going to die.
[1:11:46] That appealed to the woman. If you go to
[1:11:48] Genesis 34, she spoke kindly to Dina and
[1:11:53] he ended up uh misusing her and being in
[1:11:57] a wrong way with her. But the Bible says
[1:12:00] he spoke kindly to Dina. Why? He's
[1:12:03] meeting a thirst in her. He spoke kindly
[1:12:05] to her. Women do not usually have a
[1:12:08] physical affair. In most cases, they
[1:12:11] have a emotional affair because
[1:12:15] somebody's meeting an emotional need
[1:12:18] that's not being fulfilled.
[1:12:20] the guy at the office or the guy out at
[1:12:23] the park or whatever it is and all of a
[1:12:25] sudden he's played on things and meeting
[1:12:27] a thirst within her. But you know, uh,
[1:12:30] Dina did that and it was the wrong dude.
[1:12:32] It was the wrong guy. It wasn't that God
[1:12:34] provided man for her. Hosea chapter 2.
[1:12:37] And I'd like to read this one. I still
[1:12:38] got a little time here. Hosea chapter 2.
[1:12:44] You remember Hosea? he married uh was
[1:12:46] instructed to marry this uh woman that
[1:12:50] was kind of an unfaithful woman. And I
[1:12:54] just want to pull these quickly out of
[1:12:55] here.
[1:12:58] Verse 5, Hosea. And the whole book of
[1:13:01] Hosea is to show that Israel has
[1:13:03] committed adultery against God. In other
[1:13:06] words, she's gone after other lovers,
[1:13:08] gone after idols. And he uses this
[1:13:10] prophet's life to show Israel, this is
[1:13:13] what you're doing. He marries a harlot,
[1:13:15] marries an unfaithful woman. She lives
[1:13:17] with him for a while. Then she leaves
[1:13:19] again and she has many lovers. Does not
[1:13:21] necessarily say she did prostitution,
[1:13:23] but she went with she was unfaithful to
[1:13:25] her husband. And God is trying to say,
[1:13:26] Israel, you're being unfaithful to me.
[1:13:29] He says here verse 5, "For their mother
[1:13:31] hath played the harlot. She that
[1:13:33] conceived them hath done shamefully. For
[1:13:35] she said, I will go after my lovers that
[1:13:39] give me bread, give my bread and my
[1:13:42] water, my wool and my flax,
[1:13:45] uh my oil and my drink, thirst and women
[1:13:50] security of having the finances in
[1:13:53] order, having what we need." And I don't
[1:13:56] know if Hosea was not meeting it or not,
[1:13:58] but one of the reasons she went after
[1:13:59] her lovers is they're fulfilling all of
[1:14:02] these things. My bread, my water, my
[1:14:04] wool. They're they're quenching that
[1:14:06] thirst for that security of having those
[1:14:08] things in place.
[1:14:11] Last one, verse 13.
[1:14:17] And I will visit upon her the days of
[1:14:19] Balum, where she burned incense to them,
[1:14:22] and she decked herself with her earrings
[1:14:24] and her jewels, and she went after her
[1:14:28] lovers, and forgot me, saith the Lord.
[1:14:33] Could this be that she is using the
[1:14:37] thirst for natural beauty that God gave
[1:14:39] her,
[1:14:41] and it's not natural beauty? She's
[1:14:43] decorating herself with earrings and
[1:14:47] with jewels too much.
[1:14:49] Not natural beauty or a character that
[1:14:52] attracts a son of God, but she buys into
[1:14:54] this unnatural, making herself
[1:14:57] unnatural. You can do that through
[1:14:59] makeup. You can do that for decorating
[1:15:01] yourself too much. All out of a thirst
[1:15:04] purely to be pretty.
[1:15:07] But you make yourself unnatural. In some
[1:15:08] cases, you make yourself look different
[1:15:10] than the way God made you.
[1:15:12] something wrong with that. I'm going to
[1:15:14] change myself. I'm not happy with
[1:15:16] myself. All coming from a pure thirst to
[1:15:18] be pretty and to be acknowledged that
[1:15:20] way. But now you're using she's using to
[1:15:23] appeal to her lovers. It's it's playing
[1:15:25] on the thirst within her to be pretty,
[1:15:27] but she's using outward things that are
[1:15:30] unnatural to try to attract her lovers.
[1:15:33] So, she has a need. A woman has a need
[1:15:35] for leadership. And Satan twists that.
[1:15:37] If she does not get true leadership, she
[1:15:41] can easily be misled. Eve is an example
[1:15:44] of that. The serpent came when her
[1:15:46] husband wasn't there. And so, she has a
[1:15:49] need for true leadership. Satan takes
[1:15:51] that thirst that the woman needs for
[1:15:53] leadership. And if she does not get the
[1:15:55] right leadership, she can easily be
[1:15:57] misled. and she takes on the leadership
[1:16:00] that she uh she can be easily misled or
[1:16:05] she takes on the leadership that she
[1:16:08] thirsts for herself.
[1:16:10] I'll do this myself. Example in the
[1:16:12] Bible, Jezebel Herodiius,
[1:16:17] if she don't have the right strong godly
[1:16:19] leadership, she can become a
[1:16:21] manipulator.
[1:16:22] Women's sinful tendency is to become
[1:16:25] dominating.
[1:16:26] Men's sinful tendency is to become harsh
[1:16:29] in his leadership.
[1:16:31] But women can become a manipulator. And
[1:16:33] where does that thirst start? It thirst.
[1:16:34] I need leadership. I need to be led. But
[1:16:37] now it kind of comes out if I'm not
[1:16:39] getting that right leadership. Sometimes
[1:16:42] somebody appeals and she'll follow a
[1:16:44] leadership other than her husband, other
[1:16:46] than her pastor, other than some
[1:16:48] guidance in her life. She can she's
[1:16:50] easily led. So that thirst, Satan abuses
[1:16:54] that for the leadership to be led in the
[1:16:56] right way. And so a woman takes an
[1:16:58] sometimes if she don't get that through
[1:17:00] something else, she takes an unhealthy
[1:17:02] control over everything like Jezebel did
[1:17:05] because she has a thirst for leadership.
[1:17:07] Could be two reasons. Her husband don't
[1:17:09] provide it for her or he does and she
[1:17:12] says, "I need to take over the
[1:17:14] leadership here and I need to do things
[1:17:16] my way. He can't do it. He can't do
[1:17:20] certain things. I need to guide this
[1:17:22] along myself. You're quenching your
[1:17:25] thirst for leadership that's supposed to
[1:17:27] be provided by God and you're trying to
[1:17:29] quench it yourself.
[1:17:32] Oh, I got to find a place to get out of
[1:17:34] all this now. But the biggest thing in
[1:17:37] women is almost the same as men is that
[1:17:40] is intimacy, emotional connection,
[1:17:43] feeling close as a friend, close to
[1:17:47] feeling that need. And that's when the
[1:17:49] enemy will appeal to a woman to her
[1:17:50] thirst for intimacy, for emotional
[1:17:52] connection.
[1:17:54] Because remember, uh I said this last
[1:17:59] Wednesday night that the quality of life
[1:18:02] is in the quality of relationships. And
[1:18:03] for men and women, if you don't happy
[1:18:06] have happiness and contentment and
[1:18:08] satisfaction in the relationships around
[1:18:10] you, a closeness, then you can look to
[1:18:13] other ways to fill your intimacy. But
[1:18:15] God provides it. You just have to take
[1:18:17] joy out of it. You will try to meet that
[1:18:20] on your own sometimes through books or
[1:18:22] social media or the fantasy of something
[1:18:25] and you're trying to fill a need on the
[1:18:27] inside, a thirst on the inside with
[1:18:29] something other than what God has
[1:18:32] provided for you.
[1:18:35] A woman also needs appreciation and
[1:18:37] affirmation. She has a thirst for that.
[1:18:39] And us husbands don't give her enough.
[1:18:42] We never give enough. But a woman has a
[1:18:45] need for that.
[1:18:47] Proverbs 31 woman, she gets it. Have you
[1:18:50] read it? She's a very confident, godly,
[1:18:55] productive woman. Proverbs 31. I don't
[1:18:58] have time to read the scripture, but I
[1:19:01] think three ta three times it mentions
[1:19:05] her husband praiseth her. Her husband.
[1:19:07] Her husband. Where is she quenching her
[1:19:09] thirst to be appreciated? Her husband.
[1:19:13] God provided a fountain for that. You
[1:19:16] say, "I'm single." God can provide the
[1:19:18] right fountain to receive your praise
[1:19:20] and appreciation, not the wrong one.
[1:19:24] So, church, we need an understanding of
[1:19:26] the thirst within us. Can you say amen?
[1:19:28] We need to go know where to go with our
[1:19:31] thirst and to understand our greatest
[1:19:34] and deepest need is for the living God.
[1:19:37] Deep calleth in the deep. David said at
[1:19:40] the noise of thy water spouts,
[1:19:43] I thirst for God and I thirst for the
[1:19:46] living God. How many knows that's our
[1:19:47] greatest need? That's our greatest
[1:19:50] thirst. And we need to know to take our
[1:19:52] thirst to the well that he's provided
[1:19:54] and draws satisfaction. God's well is so
[1:19:57] deep and full of springing water. And I
[1:19:59] showed this picture to the brothers down
[1:20:01] in the meeting. I'm going to show it
[1:20:03] before I close tonight. I love this
[1:20:04] picture I found because this is really
[1:20:07] represents what David's saying. what I'm
[1:20:09] preaching tonight. If a man is willing
[1:20:11] to go to God's fountain, look where he's
[1:20:14] pulling from. Look at the beauty. Look
[1:20:16] at the purity. Look what God has
[1:20:18] provided. The springs of fresh, clean
[1:20:21] water. You don't see that up there, but
[1:20:23] if you'll go to the right fountain,
[1:20:25] that's what he has for you. That's the
[1:20:26] depth of what's underneath it all.
[1:20:28] That's why it's important to take all of
[1:20:30] our thirst, understand what they are,
[1:20:32] and take all of them to the correct
[1:20:34] fountains. Because underneath that
[1:20:36] fountain, you're drawn from the right
[1:20:38] thing. It's only going to be fresh water
[1:20:40] from the Lord. It's only going to be
[1:20:42] satisfaction. It's only going to be true
[1:20:44] joy. It's only And the thing about, let
[1:20:46] me say this as we close. When we are
[1:20:48] going to his well and we are fully
[1:20:51] satisfied, you know what? You don't
[1:20:53] really want the other thing. We preach
[1:20:55] against sin. We preach against
[1:20:57] temptation. We stay away from this, stay
[1:20:59] away from that. But the truth is, if you
[1:21:01] were fully satisfied with God's fountain
[1:21:03] drinking from it, you wouldn't want the
[1:21:05] other.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; I should get a bigger amen than that.
[1:21:09] Brother Brandham says, "I've been
[1:21:10] satisfied." He says, "Uh, are you are
[1:21:12] you drunk?" He said, "Yeah, I've been
[1:21:14] drunk for 30 years since I've been a
[1:21:15] Christian. Drunk on the Holy Spirit."
[1:21:17] And they were in the upper room. He
[1:21:18] said, "That means I've been fully
[1:21:20] satisfied with the Lord. He is my
[1:21:22] contentment. He is the source of my joy.
[1:21:25] He's where I go for truththing." And
[1:21:27] when we're really going there, and
[1:21:28] that's the evidence that you've turned
[1:21:30] from other things on your own because
[1:21:32] that all has lost its attraction.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Going to other stuff privately loses its
[1:21:38] attractive because you're so satisfied
[1:21:42] in this fountain of the Lord. You're
[1:21:44] drinking from it and it's like, I feel
[1:21:46] so satisfied today in the Lord and what
[1:21:48] he's given me. That doesn't mean you're
[1:21:50] not going to have hard days.
[1:21:52] One of my children said uh uh before
[1:21:54] church, she said, ' Man, I I I read this
[1:21:57] morning and I communed with the Lord. He
[1:21:59] said, she said, 'But boy, I've had one
[1:22:00] of the hardest days. I said, 'That's the
[1:22:01] way it is. And it's probably because
[1:22:03] you're communing with the Lord.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; So, I'm not saying today you're going to
[1:22:07] h you're not going to have bad days. But
[1:22:09] listen, all I know is this fountain when
[1:22:11] you're satisfied, you don't turn to
[1:22:13] other fountains.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; You don't want to do that because this
[1:22:16] becomes more satisfying. It's the
[1:22:18] greatest power to turn down temptation
[1:22:21] and turn down sin. The greatest power is
[1:22:24] to know you're fully refreshed,
[1:22:26] quenched, and satisfied. You just don't
[1:22:30] want it because you found your
[1:22:32] completeness
[1:22:33] completely in him. How many would say,
[1:22:36] "Lord, help me. Lord, help me tonight
[1:22:39] because I know I turn sometimes to
[1:22:42] something that I think, but Lord, help
[1:22:45] me understand how deep all of my thirst
[1:22:47] are. And then help me to understand
[1:22:49] where to take those thirst because I
[1:22:52] know everyone that you put within me,
[1:22:55] you gave me a place to fulfill it.
[1:22:57] Friendship,
[1:22:58] companionship, connecting. You say,
[1:23:00] "Well, I'm single. I don't have a
[1:23:02] husband. I don't have a wife." Listen,
[1:23:04] you think God can't provide for you. You
[1:23:07] don't think God knew you were going to
[1:23:09] be single? God knew that. And he's
[1:23:12] already got something in place for you
[1:23:15] to be satisfied, for you to quench that
[1:23:17] thirst. Praise the Lord. I'll read the
[1:23:20] scripture up again. Proverbs 20 and
[1:23:21] verse 5. You can stand. Proverbs 24
[1:23:23] verse 5. Counsel in the heart of a man
[1:23:25] is like deep water, but a man of
[1:23:27] understanding will draw out. How many
[1:23:29] want to draw out? Bring that picture up
[1:23:31] again. You got to You got to find his
[1:23:33] fountain. You got to draw out of it. You
[1:23:34] got to take that bucket. Where's that
[1:23:36] picture at? If you guys still got it.
[1:23:38] You got to take that bucket and find
[1:23:40] God's fountain and you got to dip it
[1:23:42] down all the way into those beautiful
[1:23:44] springs. You've got to do the work. You
[1:23:46] can't just be out in the field
[1:23:47] somewhere. You got to get your thirst
[1:23:49] and bring them to the fountain and drop
[1:23:50] that bucket and get that fresh water.
[1:23:52] You've got to do that. God can't do that
[1:23:54] for you. But he can show you where the
[1:23:56] fountain is.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; He can put it right in front of you.
[1:24:00] Gideon sang a good song tonight. It was
[1:24:02] led into it just perfect. I love the
[1:24:04] words that take me deeper. But let's
[1:24:06] sing that. Let's sing uh I had another
[1:24:09] one here I wanted to sing and worship
[1:24:11] the Lord with under this
[1:24:14] uh subject tonight. Come quench this
[1:24:18] thirsting.

[1:24:21] tonight?
[1:24:23] Come quench this thirsting. Amen. Praise
[1:24:28] the Lord. I'm sorry. I don't need the

[1:24:54] one who can fill me. Here I am waiting.

[1:25:07] First verse. Let's sing it again. Oh,
[1:25:10] fill this void
[1:25:13] and empty it. Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord.
[1:25:17] Shine your light
[1:25:21] on my darkness
[1:25:24] and satisfy
[1:25:27] and restore my soul.
[1:25:32] I long for you to make me whole.
[1:25:37] Come quench this thirst.
[1:25:41] Lord, I am
[1:25:43] ready. Here I am waiting.
[1:25:48] Come fill my heart.
[1:25:52] You are the only
[1:25:55] one who can fill me.
[1:25:59] Here I am waiting.
[1:26:02] Come fill my heart. Second verse.
[1:26:07] Come fill my life.
[1:26:10] I am incomp complete.
[1:26:15] Let your love
[1:26:18] rain down on me.
[1:26:21] I need you more. Lord, I confess
[1:26:29] more of you. Nothing less.
[1:26:34] Come quench this thirsty.
[1:26:38] Lord, I am ready.
[1:26:41] Here I am. waiting.
[1:26:45] Come fill my heart.
[1:26:48] Oh, you are the only
[1:26:52] one who can fill me.
[1:26:56] Here I am waiting.
[1:26:59] Come fill my love.
[1:27:02] So, we just bow our heads tonight and
[1:27:04] pray before we're dismissed. I wonder if
[1:27:06] we just ask that question to the Lord.
[1:27:09] Lord, guide me and give me understanding
[1:27:13] of my deepest thirsts that are within
[1:27:15] me. Don't let it be that Satan
[1:27:17] understands me more than I understand
[1:27:19] myself. The cravings, the the cravings
[1:27:22] for praise, the crazy the cravings. Let
[1:27:25] me understand them, Lord, and let me
[1:27:27] understand where I need to take them so
[1:27:29] Satan never has the advantage on me.
[1:27:32] Help me not to be ignorant, Lord. Help
[1:27:35] me not to uh be taken advantage of by
[1:27:38] the enemy, but let me understand your
[1:27:41] word and who I am, not only in the
[1:27:43] Lamb's Book of Life, but how you've made
[1:27:45] me even here on this earth. That I could
[1:27:48] be an overcomer, Father, and not always
[1:27:50] beat up by the enemy. That he's got the
[1:27:52] upper edge all the time. But Lord, grow
[1:27:55] your people into a people of
[1:27:57] understanding.
[1:27:58] Grow your people, Lord. form them into
[1:28:01] people that are are Lord walking so
[1:28:05] strong in the overcoming power that the
[1:28:08] devil would not know where he could hit
[1:28:10] them at. That's what I desire. Lord,
[1:28:12] start with me. Start with me, Lord.
[1:28:15] Start with the pastor. Oh God, take me
[1:28:17] deeper.
[1:28:19] Oh God, quench my thirst, Lord. May it
[1:28:22] be quenched by your satisfying wells,
[1:28:25] inexhaustible fountain. Lord, let it be
[1:28:28] satisfied only by you. do I pray? Grant
[1:28:31] it, Father. Forgive us, Lord, where we
[1:28:34] maybe have looked to other things. God,
[1:28:36] forgive us. Make us into the people,
[1:28:39] Lord, to understand ourselves in the
[1:28:42] word of God. Thank you, Father. We give
[1:28:45] you glory and honor and praise for the
[1:28:47] time together tonight to break bread.
[1:28:50] And may you grow the people into what
[1:28:51] you've called them to be in the name of
[1:28:54] the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Everybody
[1:28:57] said, "Amen."
[1:28:58] Praise be to God. God bless you tonight.

[1:29:03] satisfaction outside of salvation. S.
