TRANSCRIPT
========================================
i remember when i was taking the oath of allegiance i had to stand on my feet so if we're going to take our house of allegiance to you know no disrespect to anybody i want to sit down but i just feel like it's just respect to our lord to stand amen second timothy chapter 3 verse 16. if you please with me it says all scriptures all scripture is given by inspiration of god profitable for doctrine for approve for correction for instruction and unrighteousness that the man of god may be perfect thoroughly furnished into all good works amen i read one more scripture before we see first peter chapter four 17 and 18. and it says for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of god and if it first begin at us what shall be the end be of them that obey not the gospel of god and if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and a sinner up here may the lord bless the reading of zola what tonight you may be seated amen like i said you know you guys you know operate a gift you know saying amen to the world and pulling the gift is going to help me tonight so help me preach tonight amen i know we're not that much like we used to be on sundays but it's not about the people amen it's the fire and the people amen so the last time i was here i'm on right now the term we uh we spoke about um the power of correction and god's principle and if you all remember we're you know going i will read the same scripture the first scripture will happen timothy 3 16 to 17 about the scriptures been given by inspiration of god and it's profitable for doctrine for approval for correction for instruction and righteousness that the man of god who is the man of god us that we may be perfect and truly funny into good works and remember we talked about correction as to the modern day interpretation what the words is correction as and how the present word you know you know a line of correction and i remember we also talked about i'm just trying to give a little recap of what happened last time i mean the sermon last time so that those who are not here or those listening online can you know catch up amen and then we talk about the defensive response of the ward how nobody wants to be corrected out there but it's just like up right there they don't want you to tell them anything they believe they know everything and then when you try to talk to them they'll tell you oh even your bible tells us that she's not judged no man and they use that as uh um as an excuse not to listen to us being the correction it's supposed to take and now they were referring to matthew 7 verse 1 but that was not what the lord was saying there so they misinterpreted just to make sure they don't you don't deal with them and you know but what i always tell them like i said the last time i was discussing john garrett i said the same scripture first corinthians 2 14 and 15 especially verse 15 says that a spiritual man judged all things so it's not him judging anything right now it's the spirit of god and him that's judging the word amen so we know better than that even though they say oh judge no man you know don't condemn no man i understand that but if the scripture cannot be against himself see if he says the spiritual man judging all things that means that he gets it gets the spirit of god in him first and when he has it then god and him is going to judge whatever is around him amen and we talked about that i also talked about the principle of god as opposed to what he believes on correction we also talk about uh correction interpersonally corruption and home we talk about correction you know um in the church we talk about correction within ourselves and even the church family and then you know we talk about ingredients of correction we talked about the testimony as you all remember we said the testimony is important and testimony is our authority amen and we also talked about the motive what's your motive incorrect and why are you correct and are you correcting to just put the person down or you're correcting to make their life better i corrected to uplift them i encourage them to raise them up from their their the situation and also talked about the approach how do you correct you can say certain word in a certain way and someone will listen to you you can say the same word another way and they will flare up so how do we correct you know we talked about that so well you know i went back to listen to the sermon myself you know just to you know because i believe i have to be fed too so i went there and i was listening while i was listening to that part where paul was kind of giving comments at the end of the sermon and i was talking about that the testimony of the authority and i was just listening to it and then something took my heart and said our testimony is our authority against the devil and the the world of darkness so i was like wow so i just sat down i meant it on it on a little bit i was like this is deeper than you know what i was thinking and said and just keep talking my heart the testimony you know the devil is not scared of how beautiful you are the gift you heard you can sing your play instrument those are good things they was not scared they was not scared of how good the vocabulary is the devil is not scared of how you how much you call the scriptures he's not scared of how many messy quotes you know there's one thing that they was scared of your testimony amen he's scared of testimony because he knows that the word of god is mixed with faith in your heart and you're not just a tinkling symbol anymore you are god on two feet so every time you go on your knees even before you say in jesus name demons are trembling because you have testimony devils are shaking because they have testimony every time you try to go into worship the moment you say the first word and you're about to just praise god he knows that you're not just praising god because you feel like you know you have a good voice or whatever he knows that you're seeing him because you have a testimony and because you have the god in you he will take his life amen so the devil left at house whenever we speak or pray he might he is not afraid you know how eloquent to speak he was afraid of testing of christ in us and that that kind of you know i was just you know thinking about and i went back to the scriptures acts 19 11 to 11 to 17. if you want already i won't take our time because i have someone so much to share but about the songs seven sons of skiva and you know if you go back from verse 11 you talked about paul you know was preaching to the people and it was really you know the the anointing of god was being manifested in this after his breathe and people were being healed and in the plan you know what was saying the lame or walking and they saw this power and they were so envious they wanted to do the same thing but they didn't know that the man had an experience at the back of desert they thought he just came and just performed some miracles they didn't know that god had made him so they tried to do the same the same or you know you know to go to demon they might also add a demon and said you i join you come out of come out of him in the name of paul in the name of jesus if i read that scripture i think i should read that so we can you know get it together amen acts chapter 19. i want to get the whole picture together act 19 from verse 11 and god wrote special miracles by the hands of paul so that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons and diseases departed from them and the evil spirit went out of them then certain of the vagabond jews exhausted took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the lord jesus saying we are joined you by jesus whom paul pritchett and there are seven sons of skiva a jew and chief of the priests who did so the heaven jews and the evil spirit answered and said jesus i know paul i know but who are you so devil knows you if you're a child of god if you're standing if you're understanding the devil knows you're standing amen you never know who this all these people are and the men and women the evil spirits who sleep on them overcame them don't call the name of jesus if you don't have jesus because the devil should beat you blue blood they will give you a tough time and overcame them and prevailed against them so that they fled out of the house naked and wounded and it was known to all the jews and greeks also dwelling on the ephesus and fear fell on them all and the name of the lord jesus was magnified why was the name of jesus magnified because there was a man that had a testimony there's a man that was saved already there was a man i was a murderer who was chasing the church but god turns out around and when god gives you god gives you the holy spirit it gives you a testament to go with it when god gives the holy spirit he gives you some manifestation the first that come after it that's how you know that you've been saved amen and these people were not safe they didn't know they didn't have a testimony to it they have no authority amen i love the scripture i said if any prayer of a righteous man i have let much james 5 16. i a village means to have strength force and power so when you pray because you have a testimony you have christ in you god listens amen i just felt like she said that no go put down my heart so i just want to i want to skip i don't know it's our time it's almost uh it's been about 15 minutes now let's just go through it's perfect everybody so um we stopped at that last the last time everybody approached you know and how we just you know have the right approach to talk to people and correction by god's leading and have grace with them but tonight i'm going to speak on correction by god's word i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna try to dig a little bit deeper correction by god's word and we all know that the word of god is ever true ever faithful it doesn't change times and seasons will change the political error will change but god's word remains the same hebrews 13 8 jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he said but you say jesus you're not saying the word but he's the word john chapter one verse one in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and that's some word if you go to verse 14 of john chapter one sayanda and that word became flesh in jesus and dwell among us so when i say jesus is the same yesterday today and forever i'm saying the word is the same yesterday today and forever amen i can tell you something you know last year and they say i'm like oh i didn't say that way oh i forget the way i said i'm human but god doesn't do that he doesn't lie he doesn't repent of his word damn if he says it it stays like that forever amen matthew 24 35 evan anderson passed away but god's word would never pass away i'm glad this one they have ghosts of my heart that's what's keeping me my 244 remember where where uh after jesus has fasted and uh the devil went to tempt him and he was trying to you know tempt him and said uh that if you have power without some god command that these stones be made bread and jesus said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by some word are you listening to me but by some word but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god so not don't not never nine percent 100 of god's word so he's saying that that word is so strong that if you don't live in that word you plan for that i love the way the amplified version but they say it is written and forever remains written that means nothing can change it amen therefore for men to have to live in the past and present future he has to leave by the word i mean every word that proceeds from god's mouth that implies that anywhere else a mind finds himself is death if he really wants to leave he has to abide by the word of god amen the word becomes your road map when the word says stop you stop when war said go you go when worse i lift your hand you lift your hand when once when war says sit down you sit down why you're a prisoner of the world at that point it's not you anymore it's christ living in you hallelujah said the word is so powerful that david said in psalm 138 verse 26 he said thou has magnified thy word above thy name now the word of god god's name i mean expresses is mighty deed but the word of god tells us exactly who god is i'll say that again god's name expressed his mighty deeds you know god has done this you know they did that you know he's manifestation but god's word tells us who god really is and someone might say here i want to know god the only way you can know god is abiding that word daily continually and gradually you start to see god and who is then i put a note right here you can't worship god you cannot have a relationship with god if you don't know who god is you might make up some you know worship like candy you can you know can can have a very beautiful beautiful um altar with fruits and you know permanganates and you know grapes and yeah beautiful flowers it's a beautiful alter head but one thing he didn't have he didn't have a relationship with god he didn't know who god is hallelujah if he knew who god is he would know that god has not god he didn't want that god wanted to represent and buy a land a dripping lamb that had blood in it but abel was different heaven knew god it was just trying to make up and show up for whatever we want to do he knew that what god was going to come in later was as a bleeding lamb so because he had a revelation of who god is it didn't cost him anything to know what to give god so when we know who god is then we're gonna know what god expects from us i'm gonna say this if you know who god is then you finally realize who you are amen because when you know who god is if you are made in the image of god now let me break it down but the brown talk about ma'am god man we made the image of god it's not this flesh this blessing was made in the image of animal and that's why if he mended him the holy ghost in his life is a beast because god is dying in in him so this when i say the image i'm asking about this i'm talking about the soul that soul reflects who god is amen so when god said you know let me let us man his own image in genesis after one and chapter two he wasn't talking about his talking about the soul so when you realize who god is that this is who god is this is what god wants this is his way this is this is the path that you want god will go through then you realize exactly who you are because you are god hallelujah i feel like jumping right now amen so if you know who god is if i know who god is i know who i am then i'm walking in power and authority i love that song amen and paul said in 1st timothy chapter 1 if you want to open for the second timothy amen second timothy chapter 1 11 and 12. he was talking to timothy here and said where until i am appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher of the gentiles but the which cause i also suffered these things nevertheless i am not ashamed for i know i have the lead it's not a doubt it's not a worse and i'm persuaded persuaded me was convicted that he is able to keep that which i have committed unto him against that day so we are persuaded that's how we are tonight i swear that god is able and we know we believe it's not some guesswork amen i love the scripture also then in 11 32 said those that do know their god shall be strong and do exploits so when i said when you know who your god is you know where you are i think i'm i'm i'm correct by the scriptures because if you know your god say you will be strong diamonds is our strength and you do exploit greater works jesus said you know in the book of matthew greater what shall you do but you got to know him first now today everybody wants to they want to perform miracles and do great things and everybody want to be a prophet i was somewhere with that but paul was there and uh brother uh uh brent was there someone was still calling himself a prophet no no offense i mean but we know what the prophet is let me let me leave it right there so i don't go too far so back to what would uh no our uh the sermon we're talking about and we talked about the word of god i have three items that you know i would love to share the going forth of the word number one number two resentment word number three accepting the word so i'm gonna you know in the next maybe 30 minutes i'll try to see if i can just you know catch up with time the word of god retains its efficacy and the word efficacy in latin means efficacy which means power to produce effects that's in the web's dictionary in 1928. i love you know well i was talking brother uh dana the other day how i love the webster dictionary it brings it back to the christian walk most of the world the ones back in 1800s were the guys they were christians that's why everything they say they bring it back to you know the word that's no the christian them it said as the efficacy of the gospel and converting man from sin so the words to retain the power to change lives amen the efficacy of prayer that's how we define it powers to produce effects production to effect to the effect intended so there's a purpose for the world going forward the water isn't good doesn't go forward and i reach also what isaiah 5 said we're together the world doesn't go forth and just have no no no no purpose there's a projection and when there's this projection anything that's projection as direction and aim so the word of god has direction he has what's going to he has the heart that is that's been prepared that he wants that wants to receive it amen isaiah 55 8 11 says so shall my word be that goes forth out of my mouth if you go back a little bit it talks about you see my ways are not your ways you know as the rain coming from the earth uh on the earth and it's no one you know you went so far then it came to verse 11. he said so shall my word be that goes forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void that means when it's sin when god sends his word coming out of his mouth it has to perform the purpose that god sent it forth amen it shall accomplish that which i please and isha prosper so it's it will just go and just you know you know just you know you know do anything it's going to prosper whatever god's saying is that means to be successful so god's word don't come back to him boy he has to read that that seed of jesus somewhere maybe it's in somewhere somewhere in the world wherever he is god will bring that seed back to convince that heart amen it shall prosper in the thing we're until i sent it amen so the purpose of the word of god is to be planted as a seed in the heart of those who accept god's word that's the purpose of it and that word has to mix with faith what does it have to produce to produce effects and i remember brandon was talking about it the other day to be a fruits john john 15 to bear morford he didn't stop there he said to be a much fruit that means to the maximum amen so there's no limit to what fruits of christ that can be exhibited in our life there's no limit to it there's no stop to it something can tell you i'm talking saying you don't know your life your word your life cannot be effort don't listen to him because the word of god says you can be a much fruit he said you're trying to be like god but the bible says you're god so my life can produce as much fruit the bread of christ and praise that much fruit ask god himself you say oh the prophet had it oh i saw this no no now it's our it's our turn god just brought the prophet as the first sheep remember you know in the old testament the first shift has been weighed first but that the barbarously supposed sheep to see how god's going to work among the bride but even greater words than what we see in the prophet's life is what god is going to do now among the bride i don't care i don't care how much the devil tried to hold us back i don't try my devil try to divide us into different ranks and you know we all have our personal issues i don't know how much mind games we have i'm telling you that god has a promise for the bride and it's going to do greater works among us as long as we allow that word to take charge of our life as long as that word to you know to dissect our life he said he said in hebrews a two edges word as scotland used cutting me right here too i sang i was just open and said lord this word let's just take his full charge it should be a much fruits amen when the word is planted as a city in your heart it doesn't just remain in his status it wants to blossom just like our sisters when they have enough flowers on the planet all over and my wife has a little garden in front of our apartment and you know she's always on on the case of those plans i feel bad for this plan so she's always watching them but what what is that name she wants those the the little seed to grow to blossom full-blown amen so how does god's word get to get to a man number one directly by god himself god speak to his people god didn't want god god doesn't want a uh what he called an intermediary he doesn't want a middleman he wants to connect to the heart himself when you go to the uh uh catholic church you know they the priest would go behind you know the door and you go every side of the eagle confess your sin and you say oh chris you know last week i did this and that and you know and i say you're forgiven by the way who is that man as a part of forgive me that's a blasphemy no man has power for you i said my lord and whatever he forgives no man can even look back into it and even when you look at it you can't even see no more and god said and sit and say oh lord by all sister did this you did that she did that but god said i cannot see it so he is the only one who has a power to forgive no man on earth he needs god himself so god doesn't have no intermediary or someone to stand in between or you know i know we know we have ministers but the purpose of the ministers is for god to use them for you to connect back to him so god how does god speak to us directly by himself number two three servants amen and god spoke from from uh uh at adam to this age god has spoken to servant and we are witnesses of it and those words have never failed amen psalm 68 verse 11 says the lord gave the word great was the company of those that published it who are those ministers who are those god servants and every time they come here behind this pulpit wherever they are found and known in the jungles of africa in america and asia and the and the combo and the all they're doing is publishing the word that god has given them i was reading through this uh this uh this word um this scripture and i'll see i i don't know just to look at different translations and different bibles and the translation was different and what they said was the lord gave the word great was the company of the woman that published it i said what an error i've never seen that all my life i just saw it today and 99 of all the translations had that even amplified version the only one i didn't have that same translation was the king james version i was like wow that's why we need to know who we are and what we believe what we stand for we need to read it by ourselves don't let nobody tell you tell you anything except you're confirming yourself amen confirm that word yourself read up the scripture yourself because there's so many errors in the world right now that the devil has used people to populate what were they trying to push this they're trying to push human preachers that's what i can discern from it if 99 of all transitions have that that means trying to save women purchases okay but the bible didn't tell me that first corinthians 14 24 let your women keep selling these churches it didn't it didn't take the power of women down it just said it according to decoration when a woman the woman fell he said now your willer should be accounted to your husband does it take that position away no i'm telling you sisters have more greater position more without work to do in their homes and life at families than women even have i told my wife i said i can never try to compete with you in a row i can i don't want to switch it's hard they cook they claim that you have the the children they give you food they make sure you're okay sometimes women act like babies because you just wanna take care of us and they do all that and it's just served all together that's a lot of work the other day brother paul was talking about you know talking about the the the um salary that come how they estimate the amount of you know what mothers and house wives should have i was like i kind of afford half of it so i look at my i said just take me as i am right now i can pay for all that but people think that because god said that in book of corinthians that is taking away the role of women no you know it's just putting them in their position greater is their word if they stay by their position hallelujah so i don't believe what they said about in psalm 68 11 what this other interpretation said i believe what king james said the lord gave the word great was company of those that published it if another scripture for that 1st timothy 2 11. he also spoke about that amen so this scripture of psalm 18 11 talked about the servants of god who proclaimed the word day and night without adding to it they don't identify ideology i'm here i'm not having nothing to do to god's word because i know better out there if you go see different different preachers and out in the world and nominations they bring up cultural backgrounds and ideologies and you know just to make it look good and nice but i don't care how harsh the word of god is i'm gonna bring it the way it is and that's those are the two men of god and those are the ones that the scripture is talking about they don't have the ideological theology they deliver as sent theirs and those are the ones that the manifestations follow because if eternal god's word is so very very strong that if you had just won a little percentage that's it it's out so you have to keep it the way it is amen now when the world goes for the power and strength who are the recipients you and me but what determines um the product or the result is our our attitude to that word we can resent it or we can receive it but for senate referred to show if we receive it the first will follow so you might not you might find the brother said you can't you can't tell you can't tell a man if he has a legal son now you can but he can't see in his life by the first commandment of life if he has that ghost or not if he's receiving god's word so then i'll go to the second part presenting the word representing the word of god i look at the word resembling as harden of heart hardening of heart and if you want to know have a little example of that if you go back to the book of genesis i'm in exodus when moses spoke to pharaoh and said let my people go and the bible said he hardened his heart so god's word came and said this is what i promised my children let him go what he did he resented that word so if you want one thing you have a picture in your mind or an illustration that's what i'm i'm trying to look at after the word has been projected to to correct our lives in various forms sometimes we do not agree with it because of our emotion emotional convictions our associations our fleshly affiliations we just you know don't agree with it so instead of allow the word of god to to you know to right the wrong we just resent you know harshly we might not say it by the words of our mouth but sometimes we do it in our heart and the bible said our hearts speak louder before god jesus said instead of matthew your heart speak louder before god for the throne of god that even worse of my mouth so when the preacher is preaching even if people don't understand it even if i've not heard it before go back to my study and say lord help me because if resent is very it's very it's very dangerous if you represent the word of god because you get to a point of no return and that's because the outcome that's a very difficult situation excuse me resentment gets us nowhere resentment hardens our hearts resentment to god's word brings a man to a deadly position a very delicate position i've seen a few cases i asked my wife of a few people who are you know believers no in the word and they've been to church and they resent god's word they kick again against the pastor and they become very sick we just had a case recently and then people go to him brother please you know come back you know because i would work because i would the pastor said i'm not doing i'm not doing it and they died in that that's a very delicate position but you know what it is thought right there it started from the first time somebody said something that touched his heart about something was doing wrong and instead of him saying lord help me help my help me and get me out of the situation he fought against it and it didn't stop right there it keeps going um but i'm saying you keep falling into one error if you don't correct it you force another one and keep going you keep going once he gets at that point of no return now he has to on the day of judgment he has to stand before god and present his case because they implode and talk to him that buys them but he doesn't care about what he did that's what his power for my brothers and sisters it's not something we play with as much as he helps he saves life he also destroys life you might say oh that's harsh but that's what the word is right if i've accepted it it's life if rejected death and that's why jesus told the apostles in matthew i think matthew 10 when they even sent him out if i'm right if i'm wrong please correct me when i sent him out he said when when you when you go on pretty work those in the cities and they don't take you he said dust your shoes and walk away you know what that means the glory of god has departed from that place i don't mess it with people like that who i rejected god's word i want the best to say with people who accept god's word amen when you cross that line it's hard to come back remember the case of that woman that said not even my dog would believe the discernment of the perfect bridge guess who killed her our son-in-law struck that's i mean that i don't think there's anything that anything that will be so harsh on your heart or heart at the heart of family that your family member killed you what did she do sure xena goes for she she rejected it please my brothers don't reject us word even if it beats you hard just take it like that one day you get better hey man i'm getting faster so i'll get it i get in a minute number three accepting the correction by the word accepting correction by the word and i'm gonna split it into two and talk about the unsaved and the saved mark mark 16 15 says go into the water and preach the gospel to every creature one two he that believes that means he that accepts that word and is baptized shall be saved but either believe it or not shall be damned so when you accept the invasion of the word it convinced the sinful ways that's what it does i'm talking about it on save now i'm sick of going to wherever we're saved after you have though because i'm getting there and you know paul was i don't know uh peter was saying in the book of acts 238 and after he had the holy ghost you know in the opera when i know you know they say oh this men are drunk you know when you have the words of god in your heart and your life so much you act like you're drunk now you're not drunk or fiscal wine but you don't it looks like you don't you don't believe in this world no more because god's word in you but was you know it was talking about he was given an illustration of holy ghost as a iraq that was thrown around and dropped now a barrel of wine and it comes and he's just staggering and staggering he doesn't know it doesn't know what it's doing no more because it's not here no more it's not the right number it's the wine working and that's why sometimes you see somebody just run around the building don't make fun of them see somebody just you know tearing them and crying and just you know falling in front of the author it's not them no more that one is doing something in their lives it's changing it from glory to glory hallelujah so when that happened to peter the people wanted now they got a testimony before they didn't have a testimony maybe i sometimes speak i'll speak on the life of peter when it was you know when he was with the lord but he was not like he didn't have the holy ghost and after i had the lucas maybe sometimes i speak on that but peter after the holy ghost he was he was a shy person he was scared of the parishes and the statuses and all the you know chief person everything this time he didn't care anymore he stepped out it was not hiding no more and started speaking to the people and then the people were convicted remember we said the water has a power they asked the efficacy the power and that power convicted the heart of people who were not saved were not believers before and they said i'll say well so it's about to say they were pretty hard and they ask spirit what do we do and peter said repent the word of means change direction i'm going this way right now allah just turned around totally that's what word of pain is the pain doesn't mean i'm in direction i'm i'm peeping like can i still you know can i still you know you're not doing that no more you change direction finally you're going to a different different place amen that's the word that's the word of pain the water pain means so repent change your direction change your ways and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission and the word of mission means freedom pardon deliverance forgiveness liberty that's where the true freedom is they can say we have freedom of you know freedom of religion you know the first amendment i had to go through all that classes and everything freedom of amendment uh freedom of uh the first time in the freedom of religion freedom of speech oblique to be arms and all that stuff they might say that but i'm telling it's not now in canada they don't do that i'm sure they promised them that before so the true freedom is the word of god when you say amen he said be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost now that makes that person will say who is unsafe before who has repented who have cleansed their ways now a candidate of the old holy ghost but what what really astounded me what really surprised me a lot was i was reading now robert brown was talking about something i'll share that that could be in a minute bubba graham said don't you don't have to baptize to receive the holy ghost i was like wow i was shocked because you know i know that you have to baptize and that was uh peter's uh approach which is a good great one baptism you know justification authentication and baptism of oligarchs it wasn't that was one of the by right what the prophet said and i was really really surprised i'll share that with you in a minute and the prophet said now in question and answers number one 1954 generic the third paragraph 42 the prophet said now you don't have to be baptized to receive the holy ghost because you can receive the holy ghost when your heart is right so the holy ghost looks at the condition of the heart first that's the most important thing you can be baptized you can you know get to this set of certification but if that heart is not right yet if it's not cleaned up yet the illegals cannot enter in there it's very timid he said see because an act to peter gave a formula to repent and bypass the name of jesus christ and you shall receive the gift of the holy spirit i believe that too but then in acts 10 49 god turned around and gave the gentiles the baptism of the holy ghost before they was ever baptized at all you see it's the condition of your heart so if your heart is out right now even if you're not saying even if you're not baptized yet good holy spirit comment and peter said can we forbid water seeing that these have received the holy ghost like we had it at the beginning so then so then they constrained them that they must be baptized in the name of jesus christ but if you're here tonight and we are not saved yet if you're here tonight and your heart's not convicted yet please listen to this word i'm telling you because this is where true freedom is there's no freedom out there not now they don't need what can offer it's just pain and walls and then but if you look at paul's uh peter's uh uh formula justification i will justify by faith romans 3 28 galatians 2 16. write that down romans 5 1 galatians 3 26 again like i said justification is by faith you profess it now what does what does it mean to be justified you're innocent you know they did in the first place amen and then you go to that those are the stages of salvation the next one is sanctification centered by the word every day every chance of um two twenty six or three twenty six seven i was satisfied by the word daily and then the baptism of the holy holy ghost now i'm gonna take it down to where we're talking about the safe the safe people now how do we accept correction by the word for those who are saved after the bible it goes we used to make mistakes i wrote a question down here when you're baptized oh i got all the ghosts man you know what i'm done everything's fine i don't know nothing no more i will never make mistakes no more i'll just be the perfect man walking on earth will you make mistakes after the elder ghost is in your heart after i receive it yes you will you will make mistakes do you know why because you're still in this body your soul is saved but this body is not saved and that's why i can connect to taste you know the five sense of spirit you know touch taste you know smell and all that you can still connect to that and then to affect you sometimes your spirit is not safe because consciousness reasoning remember affection all that you see sometimes you just risen as a man like my brother paul said the other day he said give me a break sometime i just i sometimes just recently i think man why because he's still in the flesh that's why we make mistakes every day your spirit is not saved by your soul's sake but i like what the brother said here i've heard that quote i was i was trying to read it last time when i where i i spoke but i have the quotes right now i'd like to share with you say believers backslide every day so now this one is a question and answer chapter one so now just saying that you're baptizing christian baptism at age of 13 and you leave the christian life all the way along and you bastard a few times on bass lightning i wish somebody who asked me that bottom backslider remember you backslide every day there's no way at all for you to keep out of it all right but you bust like to the people in the church but not before god i love that you might make mistakes you might see my mistakes i might see your faults and not because you're human but god doesn't see all that it sees a satisfied life amen he said your sins are gone but you're constantly falling and paul said i die every day is that right you have to die every day repent every day so when they made the mistakes it didn't stay right there you have to make sure you're paying it every day and that's why we're heading out just constantly repenting all day as paul said he's in the first corinthians i'm 15 31 and say i die daily this will work put the notes down they say if paul had to do that then i'm gonna have to do two and if perfect i do that we're gonna have to do that too make the mistakes every day correct the mistakes the someone said don't let the bible say don't let the sun go down that's right on you whatever you've done that's what the scripture said but also said you know the question i'm going to ask a question i said but the bible said that everything works works for the good to them to love the lord then if you love god and turn back to the world will god let you die in sin and we will he let you reconcile back to him before he takes you away and brahma answered that question but i love this part where he said so now you make a mistake and do i do wrong not willfully because now you might say oh well because but mike said oh no no you make mistakes but bram said you make mistakes then i can do whatever i i want to do no that's willfully sin that means you're not converted in first place so i want to balance that out with listening and making mistakes so you make a mistake when you're trying to do right if you have a pencil for example you have you know expense to have a little eraser at the bottom of it and you try and draw the make to draw an image and you make a mistake use the eraser to wipe it up that's the purpose of it but when you will listening that person needs calvary amen said don't do it willfully here christian you're born again you don't mean to do wrong your intentions and everything is right but but if you do as she said here making me saying do do wrong will god let you go go on and on die like that and be lost or will he bring you back to recon consolation he will bring you back and if you're anything wrong you don't condemn you i'm going like that remember you wasn't safe at the beginning they said you were you had just had to make believe you were unsafe you have a different spirit you're a different nature you're a new creature in god and all things have passed away they are buried and are dead and buried in the sea of forgetfulness it said be no being living here in this war there's traps set for you everywhere i want you to understand that part i go to work every day and i see what i see sometimes it's nothing to build over high do it for the rest and everything and devil knows that so he set those traps for you just for you and me to fail that's the purpose of it see that strap set for you every day and you're walking with your eyes on christ i remember what the prophet said he said he had a cross and you know on this red mirror they're hanging down so that when they see anything that's not right it looks like that it looks like that cross i think i should have another cross in my car now so when anything happens around me i look at that cross but it's not a physical cross it's not it's it's this is the one that you the eyes cannot see you're looking at jesus the author finishes our faith that's what that that implies amen walking with your eyes on christ and remember when you make a mistake a real christian will always come back to reconciliation amen and that's why we need the word to wash us daily never stop it that's how we need to accept correction by god's word to purge us daily paul said i died daily he died not just not just that he made mistake he made a mistake by corrected his mistakes every day that's what the holy ghost is there to purge us but the prophet said when if you're holy spirit in your heart and you do something wrong it will step away i'm not just saying somewhere i'm waiting for you to repent but if you don't repent it keeps going further if you do if you still go that way this is white because it's very timid amen but if you repent it comes right back in so if you want to keep the holy spirit in your heart if you want to make sure that the spirit is still you know we just want to live that life for god make sure that every mistake that comes around you let the world clean it and that's how i would come that's that's why i'm here amen that's why i'm here daily as i you know you know i just want the word of god to just you know watch me daily you know cut me i know it's gonna be hard you know sometimes you know and if you look at that as a perfect man it gets it gets thin as it goes up faith virgin knowledge temperance patience godliness and brotherly kindness and cancer with love all the excess weight that you have you know that you're carrying along your christian journey the word of god does what it cuts it down anger because of doubt malice gossip because of them so many things that we came up came with the adamic nature that still announced that this flesh is still projecting because it's not saying the word of god just know so much that the the flesh has to now subject itself to the soul because the soul is filled with god amen the world becomes so connected with us that it's not now a force or you have been coerced or being impulsed to do it it's not love i fear like lord just you know you know you have you seen a young man and a woman you know we just you know fell in love with seattle you know they're not forced to do anything and that's how when the whatever comes to you you we should receive it with you know with that with the that grace of lord whatever you want to do just do what you have to do in life i'll submit to whatever your will lord amen acceptance accept into a line for direction god projects his word for correction we are set correction and a line for direction so there's a purpose washed by the water of the world correction starts from the soul and it works its way out from the inside out sometimes you know we see what we call religion which is the cloak the outsider attire and see you know the pharisees were there in the scriptures where the bible said when they fast they will go to the you know open open um streets with long places so everybody would know that they faster but that's religion but corruption doesn't do that it it goes to soul first it cuts the soul down i love what he said when the word of god touches your heart it sells the soul of flame burns anything that's ungodly and sheds its light so bright that every form of darkness will take flag so you don't have to force that person to change the way to talk no more because they've allowed one of us to correct them daily you don't have to stop them tell them to to cost i i see some some so-called christians in my job and they say oh i'm a christian every time the church and everything and they still still no use cost word i'm like the world has not touched this man yet if i touch his mind yeah the tongue will change you'd be like isaiah when he said when the call of fire taught the prophet it wasn't the same no more amen you don't have to you don't have to force them to oh please can you dress in them make your skirts know long enough so you don't expose yourself you don't have to tell them no more because the water is correction themselves if you have a child a daughter or someone i know sometimes and i'm not there yet but maybe low tires i'll be there parents who have children who you know you try to advise them and talk to them about you know how to dress and everything or the boys that keep longer and everything if you talk to them and talk you know try talk to them fine but if their heart is not converted you can just force it but when when when when the call of fire when the call of the holy spirit touched that heart you won't you just say change by yourself and what are we looking at i'm looking at something i'm looking at life of enoch genesis 5 22. he said enoch walked with god and it was found not right and that's that's the problem that's the only proper song i'm accepting the word of god the prophets why you and i accept the god's word is that walk with god unto a found not so we have an a we're looking to a city normally by hand but nothing entered that city about perfect love that means that life has to be corrected you know daily walking daily with the lord if we don't get to that point we cannot and you know you say oh you know i'm waiting for the generator you might be raptured personally uh there but john has been raptured then he's taken to glory but guess what happened to that man i'll i'll break it down what happened to him he walked with god so much that this world was not fit for him and that's what we're looking at i want to walk with god and let the world just turn me and turn me on up and down shape me to what they want until i get to a point where the world is just i'm like no i'm tired of this one i'm like come on my son that's what happens to individuals so you might make generations fine but you don't know what all that's important and plan for you the lord might say tonight it's time to go that's why we're trying to just whatever word comes to you don't don't reject it just take it because enoch walked with god and has found no more just make me pause and just think for a little bit and then i'm going to close in a minute and this brings me to the story of that made that the the ranch remember that story the prophet told about that made that was like cousins and the ranch son of the ranch owner came and they found them you know she was a cousin our cousins were all dressed beautiful beautifully and everyone's just you know lived good skimpy skirts he was saying oh when the man could demand they knew the man wasn't very bright when the man comes so you know we just dress and show them all our buddies and everything and that's what they were looking thinking what thing was looking for but he wasn't looking for that he was looking for a troop right and she wasn't made you know bashful she couldn't even look at his face and you know she was there just no they would push her dishes right go go ahead and wash those dishes i mean a cousin but she didn't complain because her nature right now was to clean and she's never so you know just do the right things and she kept doing those things not even knowing why sometimes you know the holy spirit puts his heart he doesn't know why it's for your purpose and that that lady you know we will keep doing that day day and night and they'll go to parties and everything and when it was time they heard always comment they all went to dress up and you know put some boogie boogie movies and just dance and everything the man was not even interested in that then they walk around and look look at the property because his father hold it properly he walked around and then saw the lady washing the dishes somewhere and she couldn't look at his face actually yeah he told her i'm just gonna paraphrase he told us that the purpose while i was here was looking for it and she was she i know i'm showing her mind she's like i'm not i'm not enough this is the kind of person you want but he knew what he's looking for let me tell you the lord knows the kind of bread he's looking for he's not looking for some wishy-washy you know naked bride somebody's looking for a bride that's clothed by the world and that's you and me he's looking for a bride that will stand correction don't care how far it goes and say lord i'll submit to whatever you will say that's what that's that's the bride the lord is looking for the man who was looking for and guess what he said i want you to be my bride but then somebody said i'll come back in a year stein what did they give a promise maybe sometimes i'll speak on the word the promise and power sometimes maybe we have time even in the future god permits and he gave a promise to the woman and said i'll come back in a year of time just you get dressed and then you know he just said what he said and he left so she held on she held on to that promise she wasn't playing with it so she told you know this got to know cause and said you that man can come for you look at how you dress your gown not flowing around he doesn't use two he's too dressed in an old fashion but he didn't announce it for a character he was looking for award bride was looking for some you know some some you know you know painted painted gold penified and then she she waited i'm showing her heart she was not preparing more what does it take to be a bride you know what are things that have to be no she was not working towards that promise that the man gave and she held on that promise and then one day one day that man showed up there's dots all over the place i mean and you know with all the entourage and everything and you know the now we're out in the horses gold and the galloping and just dust everywhere and the man showed up they didn't believe it they didn't even they didn't think you would come for that kind of woman and the man showed up he said i i came the promise i gave you and my father saw that there are many mansions if it were not so i wouldn't have told you but i'll give it a comforter he shall teach you all things and that man took his bride guess where he went to his father's mansion they were lost she was saved and that's what i want to also keep in my mind tonight after that story the prophet said something quickly i'll read that and then i'll close i read the scripture said some of these days we'll take a flight and go away just be ready keep the wedding garment on the wedding has to be pure how's the pure by the washing of water of the world keep all cruelty out of your heart everything and they read the scripture so let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready to her was granted that she would be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the final and in his righteousness of saints said praise be to god he said to me right blessed that day which are called to the marriage of the lamb and said unto me these are the true sins of god there's going to be a meeting in the air one of these days in that sweet buy-and-buy just here ready keep yourself ready purge your heart from all even thinking have faith in god no matter how dark it looks or how many lives people will make fun of you you believe even your family members will do that friends they make fun of you and say you've made a mistake keep right on living holy and leaving for god just keep moving on the hour will arrive this is all i have my brothers and sisters i don't have any special message this is as simple as it is though my up god's word find time every day and meditate on this word sermons that we're here every day you know they're on the archive you have the bible you have the messages you have the tapes and just like that word just do its work and you know it's slowly that word would change you it will touch every part of your life sometimes all you need to just just you know stay right then god's presence and just ask him to clean you and you see i'll go bring out things that you don't even kind of remember things that you've done that you overlook and go bring that this one hasn't worked out that one has worked out you might say oh i don't i don't gospel i don't do anything i mean i'm a sister i don't it might just be god touching your heart and saying to you when you're rolling your eyes and you are signing when your husband talks you're disrespecting it it might just be as simple as that and that could be an endurance to god doing the perfect work in your life that's just an example but there are many things that god has now in our lives that i mean that god has plans to take out of in our lives if we just run up to him god bless you bro three
