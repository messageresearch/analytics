[0:00] this morning and uh
[0:03] it's good to have my wife with me this
[0:05] morning
[0:06] where is she all right bless you
[0:10] and uh
[0:13] appreciate brother paul allowing us to
[0:16] be here
[0:17] by his grace and mercy we thinking man
[0:19] but paul we got a long way back
[0:22] and he's a real friend amen and it's
[0:25] good to see
[0:26] each and every one of you and uh i pray
[0:29] that the lord
[0:30] will help us this morning um
[0:33] if you will i want to turn to
[0:38] uh first peter chapter three
[0:48] first peter chapter 3.
[0:55] we want to go to
[1:00] we'll go to verse one
[1:05] who was ministering yesterday on a woman
[1:09] to die for and uh it's the law will help
[1:13] this morning
[1:14] i want to just preach on a man to live
[1:17] for
[1:19] amen and we just see how he leads amen
[1:22] because
[1:24] these things are very important in this
[1:26] day and time
[1:28] uh there's
[1:31] i think paul you quoted it yesterday but
[1:34] actually i quote it myself
[1:36] i always believe if you want a strong
[1:39] church
[1:41] you need to have strong families
[1:44] because church is made of families
[1:47] changed the same as the children of
[1:50] israel
[1:51] even though it's 12 tribes but god look
[1:54] look at them as one
[1:56] and so it's the same as the church we're
[1:58] made up
[1:59] of different families but we look that
[2:02] as one
[2:03] and it's very important because
[2:07] i enjoy the mysteries of the message
[2:10] i preach on them a lot at home myself i
[2:13] enjoy revelation i enjoy stimulation
[2:17] from revelation
[2:18] i i love it but i do know one thing
[2:22] if life is not there character is not
[2:25] there
[2:26] you have no power
[2:29] it's just uh i've been in the message
[2:32] now
[2:32] 31 years i believe and i've seen a lot
[2:35] of things
[2:37] and one thing i have always observed
[2:41] as coming in as message young i always
[2:44] look at life
[2:46] regardless of what a person could say
[2:48] what do they live
[2:50] or about what they're saying and the
[2:52] bible tells us in the book of hebrews
[2:54] you know you're supposed to respect
[2:56] those that are over you
[2:58] and but it says but consider the end of
[3:01] their conversation
[3:03] and that conversation means considered
[3:05] the life that they live themselves
[3:08] and we're living in a time even around
[3:11] the message i've noticed
[3:13] um i think things
[3:16] have been forgotten it's easy for me to
[3:19] preach
[3:20] to you who the bride is what she is
[3:23] what a purpose is it's easy to preach
[3:26] those things
[3:27] can make you we can preach how revelated
[3:31] we supposed to be
[3:32] we can jump high in the sky all of those
[3:34] things are fine
[3:37] but we're not born again you just only
[3:40] know about who you're supposed to be
[3:43] but without a birth you can't be that
[3:48] one thing in denomination what they have
[3:50] mastered
[3:52] they can preach prosperity
[3:56] and make people in denomination they
[3:59] literally
[4:00] because i do studying on certain things
[4:03] they can make a center feel like a saint
[4:07] and walk right out of the service and
[4:08] feel just like a saint
[4:10] but with sin still in their lives
[4:13] i kind of find this creeping up around
[4:15] the message you know
[4:17] i'm right i'm right i'm writing brian
[4:19] i'm about whoa but are you born again
[4:23] that's what it's gonna all come back
[4:25] down to is that life of jesus christ
[4:27] inside of you
[4:28] it's gonna come all the way back down to
[4:29] death because we have learned
[4:33] i better read the scriptures let's just
[4:36] read the scripture
[4:38] first peter three and one likewise you
[4:41] wise
[4:42] be in suggestion to your own husbands
[4:45] that if any obey not the word
[4:48] that also may without the word be won
[4:51] by the conversation of the wise
[4:54] that's interesting
[4:58] this is what it says that obey not the
[5:01] word
[5:02] that also made without the word
[5:08] be one a woman can win her husband
[5:12] without the word see in our mentality no
[5:15] i got to take them to the word take them
[5:16] to the word they got to see this do you
[5:17] see this right here in the scripture
[5:19] but according to this they can be one
[5:22] without the word
[5:25] how could that be because instead of
[5:28] them
[5:28] speaking the word taking them to the
[5:31] word
[5:32] they're expressing the word the word is
[5:35] being expressed through them they
[5:37] actually become that living bible to the
[5:39] unbeliever
[5:42] and it says it verse 2 while they behold
[5:45] you'll chase conversation
[5:47] coupled with fear whose adorning let it
[5:50] not be that outward adorning of planting
[5:53] of the hair
[5:54] and of the wearing of gold putting on
[5:56] the power
[5:57] but let it be the hidden man of the
[5:59] heart and that which is not corruptable
[6:02] even the ornament of a meek and quiet
[6:04] spirit
[6:05] which in the sight of god of a great
[6:06] price
[6:08] for after this manner in old time the
[6:10] holy women also
[6:12] who trusted in god adorned themselves
[6:15] being in subjection
[6:17] to their own husband if you look at
[6:19] verse 5 again
[6:21] you see the key of it it said who
[6:24] trusted in god
[6:25] so their whole life was based on in the
[6:27] fear of god
[6:29] trusted in god and by them being that
[6:32] way
[6:32] it expressed things through them
[6:35] and he says verse 6 even as sarah obeyed
[6:39] abraham
[6:41] calling him lord whose daughters
[6:44] ye are as long as you do well and
[6:48] not afraid with any amazement
[6:51] likewise your husband dwell with them
[6:53] according to knowledge
[6:55] giving honor unto the wife as into the
[6:58] weaker
[6:58] vessel what's so honorable about that
[7:03] honey i'm gonna give you honor because
[7:05] you're weak
[7:07] i don't think that's what it's saying
[7:10] it's taking acknowledge
[7:12] she's the weaker vessel but not weak
[7:15] because we have to go back to what the
[7:17] prophet said
[7:18] he did say the easiest person to be
[7:21] deceived is a woman
[7:23] now he said it i believe it could he say
[7:26] amen
[7:28] that don't now that means not deceived
[7:31] for his election
[7:32] because the elect can't be deceived but
[7:35] there can be some things in life she
[7:36] don't see
[7:38] that she should see the devil can get a
[7:41] little
[7:41] slip in there you don't understand what
[7:43] i'm saying so they don't mean you're
[7:45] weak and you walk around fragile
[7:47] they don't mean that but i will get into
[7:50] that in a moment
[7:52] and it says finally be all of one mind
[7:55] having compassion one of another
[7:58] love as brethren be pitiful
[8:02] be courteous not rendering evil for evil
[8:06] or railing for reeling but countrywise
[8:08] blessing
[8:10] knowing that you are there to call that
[8:13] you
[8:13] you should inherit a blessing you may be
[8:16] seated
[8:16] if you look in verse 8 again when it
[8:20] talks about love
[8:22] it said love as brethren so we was
[8:26] talking
[8:27] last night in the uh back with
[8:30] that a husband and wife most of the time
[8:32] we look at each other as
[8:34] husband wife husband wife but we don't
[8:36] look like this is my sister
[8:39] this is the son of god this is a
[8:41] daughter of god and
[8:42] you look right here in the scripture it
[8:44] says love as
[8:46] brethren so we're supposed to look at
[8:49] each other's brothers and sisters in
[8:50] christ
[8:52] amen so i pray that the lord will help
[8:54] us
[8:57] how long i got to preach for
[9:02] i'm a little slow this morning
[9:05] well when brother paul used talking
[9:08] about adoption that's what i was
[9:09] studying this morning
[9:11] i said wow and i said well i told him
[9:14] i'd do a part two
[9:16] so we'll do a part two but it all
[9:19] actually works in together
[9:22] adoption which we know is like the
[9:25] prophet taught us very well adoption is
[9:27] not your birth
[9:29] it's your positioning but there is no
[9:32] adoption without a birth
[9:34] because the holy spirit is your tutor
[9:37] and it and it trains you to teach you
[9:40] and guides you
[9:41] and it leads you to all truth and uh
[9:44] we we're in the time brothers and
[9:46] sisters you have to be very dependent on
[9:48] the holy spirit
[9:50] not on our knowledge and trusting what
[9:53] and the lord speaking to our hearts and
[9:55] what to say and do
[9:56] amen so just to give a little background
[10:01] well i got a quote that i would like to
[10:02] read
[10:04] this is a very familiar quote
[10:08] i was thinking about it this morning
[10:11] if i can find it
[10:19] it's come from the greatest battle ever
[10:21] fought fought
[10:23] he said i thought in order i thought
[10:26] of the order of the heavenly host
[10:29] not one of them is out of place
[10:34] everyone keeps its time
[10:37] perfectly he said god's great army
[10:42] i thought of the soldiers how that the
[10:45] moon would happen to get out of order
[10:48] the earth would be covered again with
[10:49] water
[10:51] just in a few minutes he said the earth
[10:54] would be just
[10:55] like it was when god decided to use it
[10:58] for to us for to have us here on it
[11:03] it was without form and void and
[11:06] darkness and water was upon the
[11:07] brightest of the earth
[11:09] and that moon would ever move it would
[11:12] do the same thing again
[11:14] when the moon rocks a little bit away
[11:16] from the earth
[11:17] the tides come up when it goes down
[11:20] just follows the tide it's god's great
[11:23] army it's when i thought about that
[11:26] being god's great army there
[11:28] now we went he said now we went to bed
[11:31] then i began to think that not one of
[11:33] those get out of their place
[11:35] they all set in place
[11:39] in other words they're in their adopted
[11:41] place
[11:42] they're in their position where god
[11:45] for the foundation of the world put them
[11:48] to be
[11:50] he says they all set
[11:53] in place and if there is a moving
[11:56] anywhere of them
[11:58] it's for a cause and it will affect this
[12:01] earth we just see the results of it now
[12:04] from some of them moving into their
[12:07] other spots
[12:08] it's it affects everything
[12:11] and i thought then if that great
[12:14] heavenly host
[12:15] like that has to keep its place
[12:18] to make everything in order what about
[12:21] the disorderly
[12:23] of the earthly host how when one gets
[12:27] out of order
[12:28] how it throws the whole thing out of
[12:30] cater
[12:31] the whole program of god is upset when
[12:34] one member
[12:35] gets out of order wow
[12:39] the whole program of god is upset when
[12:41] one member
[12:42] gets out of order we should continually
[12:47] we should continually to strive to keep
[12:49] the order
[12:50] of the spirit notice he said keep the
[12:54] order
[12:55] of the spirit not the order of emotions
[13:00] every time something goes wrong you rely
[13:02] back to the same emotion to deal with
[13:04] the situation
[13:05] no the order of the spirit
[13:08] people say man you see some people are
[13:11] you see
[13:12] one thing you have to learn we have to
[13:14] understand about the devil
[13:16] uh you got to understand he studies you
[13:20] he studies me he knows your ups he knows
[13:24] you're down he know how you built up
[13:26] satan actually knows amen
[13:29] and then you remember them spots in our
[13:31] life you have to protect
[13:33] we all know your weaknesses you know
[13:35] your weak spots
[13:36] we all know that in them spots that you
[13:39] have to protect
[13:41] and uh you can know you can every
[13:43] believer if you be honest
[13:44] you can know when you get in the wrong
[13:46] spirit you know you can feel
[13:48] it coming you can feel it coming you
[13:49] know it but what we do
[13:51] we say well i'm going to get out of
[13:53] order for this minute god you're just
[13:54] going to have to understand but i'ma
[13:55] have to let this theme off
[14:00] i'm just being honest with you see
[14:04] but what you have to understand when you
[14:07] even see it coming
[14:09] you're getting ready to get out of order
[14:10] you go back to the holy spirit you're
[14:12] leaning on the word say lord that's
[14:14] that's not where i'm supposed to be
[14:16] that's not how i'm supposed to act
[14:17] let me line up with your word you're
[14:20] you're having a victory then
[14:22] instead of heeding to their own spirit
[14:23] you're heeding to the right spirit
[14:26] can you say praise the lord you see we
[14:28] all like to paint a perfect picture of
[14:30] ourselves in church that we are perfect
[14:35] but don't nobody know you better than
[14:37] god
[14:39] the devil your husband your wife
[14:42] and your children
[14:46] this exactly right we know each other
[14:49] did you like brother paul was talking
[14:51] yesterday in
[14:52] marriage life you know how to push the
[14:54] buttons
[14:56] you know how to make one another mad
[14:58] your children know how to make you mad
[15:00] your children know how to upset you your
[15:02] children know how to ask you for things
[15:04] they know when to ask you for things
[15:06] they know how to catch you off guard
[15:08] when they want things we all study each
[15:11] other
[15:12] that's what we do can we say amen
[15:17] just like your children they love to
[15:19] catch you on the phone
[15:20] conversation they love that
[15:24] especially when you get to hey brother
[15:27] hey man hey man you're on that then the
[15:28] children be like
[15:29] man it's my time uh daddy can i go over
[15:32] with such and such
[15:33] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you go go go go
[15:35] and when he gets off the phone
[15:38] hey what what that boy he's always
[15:41] saying what are you doing over there you
[15:43] told him he can go in do you argue no i
[15:45] did not tell him that
[15:47] and when you thought son i didn't tell
[15:49] you to do that yes you did
[15:50] when you was on the phone i asked you
[15:53] and you said i could go
[15:56] he studied you
[16:00] so we study each other we do
[16:04] praise the lord this might might be like
[16:06] a normal service to you but it's going
[16:07] to be a service
[16:09] i'm just going to be honest with you you
[16:11] know and uh
[16:13] i can preach revelation but that ain't
[16:17] what god telling me to preach right now
[16:19] and i actually love it when we were
[16:21] talking about the book of ruth i started
[16:22] getting excited
[16:24] no no i know i'm here for a certain
[16:27] purpose
[16:28] because family is important
[16:32] and uh we grow all of us grow
[16:36] and uh to me the mistakes ain't so much
[16:39] the problem
[16:40] sometimes it's trying to it's how you
[16:41] handle the mistakes makes the problem
[16:45] and but we got to grow and uh i know i
[16:48] probably said
[16:49] here at your church before but i i
[16:51] always tell my church
[16:53] if you're going to make mistakes that's
[16:55] fine because the prophet god said as
[16:57] long as we're in this flesh we're going
[16:58] to make mistakes
[17:00] i said but don't take that quote and
[17:01] stretch it so far
[17:04] and then you become justified in making
[17:06] mistakes
[17:07] i said if you're gonna make mistake make
[17:09] new ones
[17:13] don't keep making the same ones over and
[17:15] over because
[17:16] it's not mistakes it's somewhere you
[17:20] need some deliverance but you want to
[17:22] say
[17:22] the prophet said the prophet said no you
[17:25] need to dig a little deeper now you
[17:27] you keep doing the same thing there's
[17:29] some deliverance need to be taking place
[17:32] so you can get quotes and stretch them
[17:34] the wrong way too far
[17:35] and it gets out of balance and
[17:39] we have to be honest can we say praise
[17:41] the lord
[17:43] amen let me finish this
[17:49] see there is power
[17:53] in position when a person knows their
[17:56] position
[17:57] there is a power that actually goes with
[17:59] it let me just finish
[18:01] he said and i thought then that great
[18:03] heavenly host
[18:05] has to keep its place to make everything
[18:09] in order what about the disorderly of
[18:12] the
[18:13] earthly host let me just verse
[18:16] 50. he said i would to god this morning
[18:20] that we would bring this to a real
[18:23] healing
[18:23] service that we could keep this part
[18:27] group that we have gathered under this
[18:29] roof this morning in such a
[18:31] harmony that the holy spirit would place
[18:34] every member of the body that's here
[18:38] this morning
[18:39] in such a harmony there will be such a
[18:42] spontaneous
[18:43] healing of soul and body
[18:47] if we'll just hold our positions
[18:52] now i want you to think about this now
[18:55] he start talking about
[18:56] the spontaneity spontaneous thing can
[18:59] just take place
[19:01] if the believers would hold
[19:04] their position because by you holding
[19:07] your position
[19:08] that brings a power now if you ever
[19:11] thought of the
[19:12] word holding your position really that's
[19:15] an army term
[19:17] and he's speaking about this great
[19:19] heavily hosted soldier
[19:20] it's an army term because in the army
[19:24] what is the enemy job what is his
[19:27] purpose
[19:28] is to take your position defeat you
[19:31] on your own land defeat you in your
[19:34] position
[19:34] so he can take over you remember goliath
[19:38] that's what they told the the
[19:40] philistines told the israelite
[19:42] if you come beat us we'll serve you you
[19:45] we beat you
[19:46] you serve us each one want to have gain
[19:49] and control
[19:51] so a position holding your position like
[19:53] even in the army
[19:55] when the enemy don't start rushing in
[19:57] that you'll get the sergeant scream out
[19:59] man hold your position other word don't
[20:02] run
[20:04] you stand right there it's a fight going
[20:06] on to hold your position
[20:08] it's something coming against you but
[20:09] you got to be strong enough to stand
[20:11] right there i am not moving i'm going to
[20:14] take this challenge i'm going to stay
[20:15] right here i'm not going to break
[20:17] i'm going to hold my position and then
[20:19] that and the enemy say why they don't
[20:21] want to give in they don't want to break
[20:23] that's the way you got to be when
[20:24] pressure comes it comes from everywhere
[20:27] you got to say uh i'm a wife in my house
[20:31] and the devil's not going to make me
[20:32] think little of myself i'm going to
[20:34] hold my position as a wife
[20:37] i'm going to hold my position as a
[20:40] husband even pastors
[20:42] problems start happening in the church
[20:43] your position is a pastor
[20:45] but the devil is going to make you not
[20:46] want to be one no more
[20:48] but you're going to have to stand up no
[20:50] i'm going to stand right here i'm going
[20:52] to hold my position
[20:53] i'm not going to let the devil gain
[20:54] grounds
[20:57] see holding position it lands on every
[21:00] one of us you have to
[21:01] put your foot down and stand your ground
[21:03] because it's a fight
[21:05] how many of you like victory
[21:10] but how in the world you're gonna have
[21:11] victory if you never have a challenge
[21:15] there has to be challenges before you
[21:17] could have victory
[21:19] but you and i don't know where the
[21:20] challenge is going to come from most of
[21:22] the time just things just pop up
[21:23] sometimes we just don't see it
[21:25] but you know what it actually didn't
[21:28] just pop up
[21:30] the devil been working all along he just
[21:33] finally came to the place and now
[21:35] bam now i can get him he's always
[21:37] working on something
[21:39] that's why you and i we have to keep
[21:41] ourselves consecrated
[21:43] in prayer staying in the word amen
[21:47] because so many things out there in this
[21:48] world to distract you now
[21:50] and uh to get you from your
[21:52] concentration this is the age we're
[21:54] living in
[21:55] but let me tell you buddy and sister out
[21:58] of all the parables that i read
[22:00] when they start talking about the seed
[22:02] being planted
[22:04] the most crucial parable i believe it is
[22:06] to today
[22:07] when jesus would start talking about the
[22:09] seed he said it's the cares of this life
[22:13] the deceitfulness of riches has
[22:16] choked the seed and that's what's going
[22:20] on now don't choke the word
[22:22] cares of this life want to keep up with
[22:24] certain things because the world got so
[22:26] much to offer
[22:27] you know even in technology and all
[22:29] these things technology is good
[22:32] but it can take you away from god if you
[22:34] use it wrong
[22:36] facebook is a killer
[22:41] i just can't understand that people
[22:43] can't stay in church an hour
[22:46] but can stay on facebook four hours
[22:49] don't get sleepy don't get tired or
[22:51] nothing to
[22:53] the church of faith books
[22:57] dude come to church man
[23:00] here is the devil it's the devil
[23:03] telling you here you're tired oh come on
[23:06] no
[23:06] friends look where our attention is
[23:08] being drawn to in this day and time
[23:12] hey man that wasn't
[23:15] it wasn't in the notes
[23:20] but this is very important about holding
[23:22] position
[23:25] i thought it was pretty nice but paul
[23:29] i was thinking this morning i said well
[23:31] we got a youth meeting tonight
[23:33] so it's okay to still stay on this
[23:37] topic with husband and wife
[23:40] and then deal with the youth tonight so
[23:43] this is perfect
[23:45] so when we talk about things even
[23:47] husband and wife lives some of you are
[23:48] not married
[23:50] but these some things you can still
[23:51] listen to and glean from it
[23:53] and when you one day you do get married
[23:56] the holy spirit will bring your mind
[23:58] back to certain things that different
[23:59] ministers have said
[24:01] and that's what helps through marriage
[24:02] when you listen to the word
[24:04] problems come up and then you can say
[24:06] wait a minute i remember somebody
[24:08] preaching about something
[24:09] and then now you're going back the holy
[24:11] spirit is taking you back to the things
[24:12] that you have heard
[24:14] that's how god does things because
[24:16] sometimes you know you could sit in a
[24:18] service a minister preaching
[24:20] you might not even be understanding it
[24:21] ain't even getting nothing
[24:23] but then later on it's just why that's
[24:25] what he meant
[24:26] that's how god works what you're doing
[24:30] sitting in service you're storing things
[24:32] in your hard drive
[24:35] and then one day it comes back up by the
[24:38] holy spirit to remind you of what you
[24:40] heard is that right
[24:43] but now let's get to this
[24:50] i want to i want to turn the first first
[24:52] let's go to first john chapter four
[24:55] and then we're gonna go back to first
[24:58] peter
[25:05] a man to live for
[25:10] and a woman to die for
[25:16] and some of you that probably wasn't
[25:18] there that put it in a nutshell a woman
[25:21] to die for
[25:22] we just took the characters of some
[25:24] women in the bible they had
[25:27] no good reputations bad scars in their
[25:30] lives
[25:31] but their husband married them because
[25:34] they seen something else in their life
[25:36] worth dying for regardless of what they
[25:38] don't been through what they've done
[25:40] they said this is a lady that i'm ready
[25:42] to take the reproach for her
[25:44] i'll die for her i'll do anything for
[25:46] even though it looks bad
[25:47] i'll do it but we're just bringing it
[25:49] right back to christ
[25:51] there's nothing you and i did good for
[25:53] him to accept us
[25:55] nothing he loved us
[25:58] at all bad we were yet sinners he loved
[26:01] us
[26:02] so there was taking it back to the
[26:04] relationship how a husband should even
[26:06] be with his wife
[26:07] lord he has to look at her faults and
[26:10] look at her this is a daughter of god
[26:12] i love her and i can and love covers the
[26:16] multitudes of sin
[26:17] error and fault it does so that's
[26:20] it that helps out in the marriage stop
[26:23] looking at one
[26:24] another physical things and look at
[26:25] spiritual things
[26:27] about one another it actually helps
[26:30] and we went through a lot but i can't go
[26:32] back over all that now
[26:34] but just just a brief uh thing but
[26:37] what i want to get to about uh uh a man
[26:40] to die for
[26:42] now that goes i'm sorry a man to live
[26:45] for
[26:46] that's gonna go back to her sister
[26:48] saying
[26:49] i want to live for this man just getting
[26:52] on my nerve
[26:55] i want to live for this man and every
[26:58] man
[26:59] wants his wife to live for
[27:03] respect him honor him every man wants
[27:06] that
[27:08] but i find something in the bible and in
[27:11] the nature of god
[27:12] there's something man actually have to
[27:14] do
[27:16] to make a woman wants to do that not
[27:19] only that she knows the word
[27:20] that she's supposed to do those things
[27:23] but there's something about a man that
[27:24] he can do to make her actually wants to
[27:26] do it
[27:29] so we got to type everything with our
[27:31] relationship with jesus christ
[27:33] they all have to go back to death
[27:35] because we are his bride he's our
[27:37] husband
[27:38] and in marriage life to see how he
[27:40] treats his bride
[27:42] we can relate that to us and we should
[27:44] just follow that same
[27:45] pattern now i'm gonna ask you a question
[27:51] why do you love god
[27:57] why what's this reason according to the
[28:00] scripture
[28:02] why do you love god why do you want to
[28:05] serve him
[28:06] why do you want to just give him your
[28:08] all
[28:10] what made you that way why do you want
[28:11] to do it according to the scripture
[28:14] i'm going to show you according to the
[28:15] scripture why you do it and
[28:17] you bring it over to your marriage it's
[28:19] the same thing
[28:22] first john chapter 4
[28:25] verse 17. herein
[28:29] is our love made perfect
[28:32] that we may have boldness in the day of
[28:35] judgment
[28:36] because as he is so are we in this world
[28:42] there is no fear in love but perfect
[28:46] love
[28:46] casts out fear because fear has
[28:50] torment he that feareth is
[28:53] not made perfect in love
[28:56] we love him because he first loved
[29:00] us
[29:05] because he first loved us
[29:08] and he expressed it to us you know what
[29:11] it meant you and i do
[29:13] melt
[29:16] look what he done for me he gave his
[29:20] life for me
[29:22] shed his blood for me he understands me
[29:25] i can't help
[29:27] but submit to this man
[29:32] i can't help it i just because what he
[29:34] what christ don't express
[29:36] to you and me unlocked submission
[29:40] in our lives to submit to him
[29:47] praise the lord so now you would say
[29:50] that's a man christ i am
[29:54] willing to live for
[29:58] it's because of what he done makes you
[30:00] want to do that
[30:02] now look at as a man want his wife to
[30:04] submit
[30:06] be submissive to him but what are you
[30:08] doing brother to make her want to do it
[30:12] what is she seeing in you
[30:15] hello what is she seeing and you say i
[30:17] just i just love this guy
[30:19] oh i just want to be be more submissive
[30:23] it had to be something you're doing
[30:26] to unlock that now we used some
[30:30] characters yesterday
[30:32] we use rahab we use eve we used
[30:35] mary and uh seemed like it was another
[30:38] one
[30:39] but we used different characters of
[30:41] women
[30:42] but i'm gonna use the actually the same
[30:44] characters but show you the other side
[30:48] we was talking about eve uh well first
[30:52] we're talking about
[30:52] ye eve how did adam when he even seen
[30:56] eve have fallen he seen it
[30:59] but there was no thought in adam's mind
[31:02] how can i get rid of this woman she just
[31:04] done messed up
[31:06] he didn't even think about it he was
[31:08] just thinking how can i get her back
[31:10] to me are you with me
[31:13] the same with rahab look how marred her
[31:16] life was but simone he didn't care
[31:19] he was looking at something down in her
[31:21] heart he said i want to doctor this
[31:23] woman
[31:24] this is the type of woman i want to die
[31:26] for
[31:27] so then mary with joseph telling her
[31:31] she's going to have a child that wasn't
[31:33] good news to joseph
[31:36] unto god open up joseph i by way of a
[31:39] dream
[31:40] for joseph was concerned you you how
[31:43] could you do me like this i can't
[31:44] believe this but when god
[31:46] opened his eyes and then he realized
[31:48] this mary
[31:49] is willing to accept what the angel of
[31:51] the lord has said about her and
[31:53] according to the word
[31:54] she's willing to stay with the word and
[31:56] push me aside he said
[31:57] i i want to die for that type of woman
[32:01] but now look at the flip side of all of
[32:03] it
[32:05] think about it brothers and sisters
[32:09] with adam and eve when adam forfeited
[32:12] everything for her
[32:14] and they were walking out of the garden
[32:16] of eden
[32:17] walking out hugging his bride
[32:21] he could have looked at adam
[32:25] how bad it was but they walking out
[32:30] out of their home out of their
[32:32] inheritance
[32:34] he hugging her walking out of the garden
[32:36] and then she looks at him
[32:39] but you could have stayed
[32:45] you didn't have to do what you did
[32:48] because the prophet god could have gave
[32:49] him another life
[32:52] but adam you
[32:55] you did this with me
[32:59] could you just go in the ease heart now
[33:02] she was
[33:02] this man gave up everything for me
[33:06] what a man i can't help but be
[33:09] submissive
[33:10] to him i want to live for them it's the
[33:12] same
[33:13] thing but christ has done for you and me
[33:16] so brother look what adam sacrificed
[33:19] he gave himself for her adam
[33:22] was fulfilling ephesians 5 and it wasn't
[33:25] written yet
[33:27] in paper it said husband love your five
[33:31] give yourself for her even as christ
[33:33] gave himself for the church
[33:35] adam was fulfilling that before it was
[33:36] written on paper
[33:39] and by that it unlocked a submission and
[33:42] heard
[33:42] what a man what a man
[33:47] think about rahab
[33:50] same thing being with simone
[33:53] he could have had any israelite sister
[33:56] he wanted
[33:58] very easily like some of the young boy i
[34:01] think in the message i can get any girl
[34:02] in the message i want
[34:06] he could have but he was interested in
[34:09] one
[34:10] rahab with a marred tore up life
[34:14] but could you think as him and her
[34:19] she's married to this man and she just
[34:21] looks at him
[34:24] what a man he could have had anybody
[34:27] that he wanted
[34:29] but he chose me and really i have
[34:31] nothing to offer this guy
[34:34] but he chose me i'll submit to a man
[34:37] like that
[34:38] because he gave himself for me that's
[34:40] why we submit to christ he gave
[34:42] everything
[34:43] for you and me see it unlocks submission
[34:48] now everything i'm saying there's a
[34:50] balance to every bit of it
[34:52] it is balance because it's so
[34:57] we get so much into emotions because
[35:00] it's some struggle
[35:01] when you know it as a even as a sister
[35:04] you know the word say be submissive to
[35:06] your husband
[35:07] and then your husband can literally be
[35:08] treating you wrong
[35:10] then a fight comes with you in the word
[35:16] god i know what you're worth but just
[35:18] just god
[35:22] i did the prophet of god gives a story
[35:26] he gives a story you remember this man
[35:31] he was a drunkard him and his friend
[35:34] they drank
[35:37] and then they the question come up
[35:41] it comes up there's no real christians
[35:42] no more
[35:44] and then this man said here it is
[35:47] there is one i know of and they said who
[35:51] he said my wife here is a man
[35:54] been treating her bad all alone
[35:58] but yet she was witnessing to him she
[36:01] was fulfilling peter
[36:04] by her conversation she was winning him
[36:07] even though he treated her bad
[36:10] now for she knew this guy just a rough
[36:13] man
[36:14] is he ever going to be saved i don't
[36:15] know but she hold her position
[36:19] and god was working he treat she even
[36:22] sometimes you have to understand when
[36:23] things get worse
[36:26] that don't mean it's worse it's actually
[36:29] getting
[36:30] better sometimes when it's getting worse
[36:34] amen right before dawn you know
[36:38] but we when words come we're like whoo
[36:40] man
[36:42] no this is messed up
[36:45] the devil wants you to stay just like
[36:47] that because that's going to show you
[36:49] you ain't got faith
[36:51] your faith is not where it needs to be
[36:53] we've been taught
[36:54] very well because things get dark that
[36:56] don't mean that it's the end
[36:58] that means things because god he shows
[37:01] his best in the darkness
[37:04] light shines best in the darkness
[37:08] amen so when things going bad just keep
[37:11] holding your position
[37:14] amen so she comes he comes and told
[37:18] now here's this man testifying for her
[37:20] and she don't have an idea
[37:22] he's doing it and then he goes home
[37:25] you know the story they pretending like
[37:28] they drunk
[37:29] comes staggering in there and she go fix
[37:32] his food
[37:33] the guys you know i don't like my eggs
[37:36] like that
[37:37] who threw it on the floor
[37:40] now what would you do if you don't do
[37:41] that
[37:46] what you know i don't like it like that
[37:48] fix it yourself the next time buddy
[37:54] but she just got on her knees
[37:57] started scraping it up let's jesus bow
[38:00] the cross along and all the world go
[38:04] free
[38:06] and all of them got converted just
[38:08] because of her compensation
[38:10] her life but she hold her position
[38:16] that's powerful see we
[38:19] this is not stories i believe god
[38:21] anointed the prophet god tell little
[38:23] stories because of the it's an impact
[38:25] behind every story sometimes people
[38:28] brother brother you dramatize too much
[38:30] you do that dude i said paul call them
[38:32] allegories
[38:35] jesus used parables can we say amen
[38:39] i said there's a meaning in everything
[38:41] in the bible
[38:42] that's why the prophet god said you
[38:43] can't see christ on every page go back
[38:45] and read it again
[38:47] it has to be something you remember
[38:50] even in christ the mystery god revealed
[38:53] how was the seventh seal revealed
[38:56] he said it's revealed through the
[38:58] believers through the stories in the
[39:00] bible
[39:02] it's revealed through all of that it's
[39:04] revealing christ
[39:06] that's why we go into all of the stories
[39:08] we
[39:09] learn from it because it's a purpose and
[39:11] it's for
[39:12] the bride of jesus christ how many of
[39:14] you know we ought to be the most
[39:16] grateful people
[39:18] because god used them for examples
[39:22] faults and failures so you and i can
[39:24] look
[39:25] learn don't have them same thoughts and
[39:27] things
[39:28] that's what paul said they was awful
[39:31] examples
[39:32] for you and i i think first corinthians
[39:34] 6 don't do the things that they did
[39:37] so we should be more overcomers being
[39:40] able to look and see wait a minute i
[39:42] don't want to go that way
[39:43] i see what happened but yet we're still
[39:45] falling in some of them same traps
[39:50] can we say praise the lord
[39:54] so that woman that husband looking at
[39:58] her
[39:59] he realized this is already testifying
[40:02] this is a woman of god she was already
[40:05] winning him
[40:06] before his friends come over there
[40:10] but god put it away they needed
[40:11] salvation too so let me bring
[40:13] all the right down with him god
[40:16] know how to do things can we say praise
[40:19] the lord
[40:22] i'm trying to get started
[40:30] i want to go to ephesian five
[40:49] ephesians 5 we're going to go down to
[40:54] this very scripture we all know it but i
[40:56] just want to read it again
[40:58] we're going to verse 21.
[41:03] so submitting yourself one to another in
[41:05] the fear of god
[41:07] why submit yourself and to your own
[41:09] husband
[41:10] as unto the lord we was talking about
[41:13] that yesterday
[41:14] submitting yourself to your husband's
[41:16] ass unto the lord
[41:17] that goes back remember it's a quote the
[41:20] prophet god said
[41:22] as you serve your husband is as you
[41:24] serve god
[41:26] i mean you remember brother branham
[41:27] saying that there goes the scripture
[41:29] that backs that up
[41:31] listen what it says submit yourself unto
[41:34] your own husband
[41:36] as unto the lord so how you submit to
[41:39] the lord you should to
[41:40] submit to your husband the same way and
[41:43] what makes us
[41:44] want to submit to him because of what
[41:46] he's done for us
[41:48] are you with me giving thanks always
[41:53] of all things unto god and the father in
[41:55] the name of the lord jesus christ
[41:57] i'm sorry go back to verse 23
[42:01] for the husband is the head of the wife
[42:04] even as christ is the head of the church
[42:06] that he is the savior
[42:08] of the body i remember when i was a
[42:10] young christian first coming the word
[42:11] and i sing that scripture
[42:13] the husband is the head of the wife oh
[42:15] that was power
[42:19] on your head i'm your head you're
[42:21] supposed to follow me
[42:23] i'm your head follow me
[42:26] but at that young time am i immature
[42:30] life i wasn't mature giving her
[42:33] something worthy to follow
[42:36] but yeah i had a big head
[42:40] i'm the leader but i wasn't falling
[42:42] under leadership myself
[42:44] so be in the head you got to have a head
[42:46] above you
[42:47] which is christ are you with me
[42:52] i was going about it the wrong way why
[42:54] say something i didn't like do something
[42:56] like you you supposed to respect me
[42:58] obey me and submit to me that's what the
[43:00] bible says
[43:02] write scripture wrong application
[43:09] see then you try to beat somebody into
[43:11] submission
[43:12] with the scripture
[43:15] that don't that's not love that's
[43:18] putting fear into somebody
[43:20] i do not want my wife to be my wife
[43:22] because she's afraid
[43:25] it can't be perfect love she's afraid
[43:29] hello that's why we don't serve god
[43:32] because we're afraid to go to hell
[43:36] we're serving because we love him and
[43:38] knowing we deserve to go to hell
[43:41] it's the same thing if we could just
[43:43] take these simple principles
[43:45] and apply to marriage
[43:48] it makes things works out a whole lot
[43:51] better
[43:53] but when one uh both in the flesh
[43:57] it's gonna be my way or the highway it
[43:59] ain't gonna work
[44:01] would you tell jesus that oh god you're
[44:04] gonna be the way
[44:04] see that's another problem we got too we
[44:06] like to tell god our plan
[44:09] then we want him to anoint our plan
[44:13] when we should take our plan to him and
[44:15] ask him is it okay
[44:17] what is your perfect will see that's
[44:19] what we mess up right now
[44:23] don't work that way it just don't work
[44:25] that way
[44:27] praise the lord that's why i believe in
[44:29] the unity in the home husband and wife
[44:30] and unity
[44:33] and that unity going to have a
[44:34] foundation that is based upon
[44:37] and it had to be based upon the word
[44:41] amen praise the lord
[44:44] i believe that even in the beginning
[44:47] we understand even in the fall adam and
[44:49] eve were co-equal
[44:52] but when the fall took place that's when
[44:54] god
[44:55] changed it and told her he shall be a
[44:57] ruler
[44:59] right he put the man over the woman
[45:03] but now what we have to even understand
[45:05] about that scripture
[45:06] it is actually true but when it comes to
[45:10] the spiritual side now
[45:12] with the bride of jesus christ in jesus
[45:14] christ he brought all that back together
[45:17] that the bride in christ she can speak
[45:20] not just preachers get adopted
[45:21] sisters get adopted too not just men
[45:25] have power
[45:26] sisters have power too but there's
[45:28] perimeters that god had put
[45:30] to balance everything out but the man
[45:33] still
[45:33] is the head with christ being his head
[45:38] not trying to run his house by his own
[45:40] intellect or his personal feelings it
[45:42] don't work that way
[45:43] it had to be the leadership that god
[45:45] give you to run your family the same as
[45:47] a pastor
[45:48] a pastor can't run his church by his
[45:50] desires
[45:53] he runs it by the word what the word
[45:56] orders it out
[45:57] can we say amen because i can tell you
[45:58] if a pastor runs the church by the way
[46:01] he thinks things are supposed to be
[46:02] within himself
[46:03] and when it don't work
[46:07] he's going to get frustrated
[46:11] hello now i'm a pastor too so i can say
[46:13] these things
[46:15] so i learned i learned
[46:19] i see things in people's lives god wants
[46:22] to do
[46:24] i sit back and watch
[46:27] before i say something because sometimes
[46:31] there can be something god doing in a
[46:32] person's life a pastor can see it he can
[46:35] speak too quick
[46:37] he said god put that down and then by
[46:39] that person respect the pastor
[46:40] he's going to try to operate in that
[46:43] because the pastor thought it was good
[46:46] but if you wait for the time and season
[46:48] and the pastor has a right to brother
[46:50] sister
[46:51] i need to talk to you brother the lord
[46:53] been showing me something when that
[46:54] season is right
[46:56] that anointing will drop right in and
[46:58] everything will work out perfect
[47:00] see we can speak too quick sometimes and
[47:01] sometimes we can wait too long
[47:03] because it all goes back leaning on the
[47:06] holy spirit
[47:07] win the same thing and i know some in my
[47:09] church get mad at me because they think
[47:11] i should say things and
[47:12] i don't say it see that's their
[47:15] challenge
[47:18] do you really believe me i'm your pastor
[47:21] so why you want to push me to move
[47:23] quickly that's your challenge not mine
[47:25] i'm waiting on god
[47:27] not you hello
[47:30] see when it's a work of the holy spirit
[47:32] we'll learn to respect
[47:34] each other and just wait because when
[47:37] god does something
[47:38] it always works out right
[47:43] can we say praise the lord oh i go
[47:45] through these things too i think you
[47:46] should have said something quicker
[47:47] so you think i think one of the most
[47:50] funny incidents i tried to deal with the
[47:51] situation
[47:53] it'd been a while ago and then the
[47:55] parent come back to me and say i i think
[47:57] you handled that wrong
[48:00] i said really yeah that's what we would
[48:03] have done
[48:05] i don't know so you think i heard it
[48:08] wrong but you don't know what you would
[48:09] have done
[48:11] that don't make sense do it i said
[48:13] forget about that you know i've done
[48:15] what i said what god allowed me to say
[48:18] can we say praise the lord
[48:21] i don't know why i'm getting on this one
[48:22] brother paul but we're there
[48:27] let me explain something brother sister
[48:31] christ and his bride is a relationship
[48:36] husband and wife is a relationship
[48:39] pastor in the church is a relationship
[48:42] and all just drops right on down but in
[48:45] all the relationship
[48:47] is the holy spirit operates at all
[48:51] that's the way it's supposed to be the
[48:54] holy spirit
[48:55] operating it all
[48:59] hold your position even in
[49:02] mary's life could you just think
[49:05] when she looked at joseph how joseph was
[49:09] willing to bear the reproach of all the
[49:12] things people are saying about her
[49:14] joseph walking around smiling and people
[49:17] probably shaking their heads
[49:19] just man come on be for real and then
[49:22] marriage and look at joseph
[49:24] what a man what a husband
[49:27] he ain't caring about what people are
[49:29] saying he's just caring about me
[49:31] i have to submit to this man
[49:35] he unlocked that in her life
[49:39] now here's the scripture i want to get
[49:40] to
[49:42] back to ephesians
[49:46] verse 25. let's go to verse 24.
[49:50] therefore as the church is subject and
[49:52] to christ
[49:54] so let the wise be subject to their own
[49:57] husband
[49:58] and everything look at the comparison
[50:00] he's just taken aback
[50:02] how the church relationship it was
[50:03] christ so should the woman had that same
[50:05] relationship
[50:06] with her husband and also the husband
[50:08] with his wife
[50:11] then he give us a good example god gave
[50:14] us an example
[50:15] all through the bible what kind of man
[50:17] he is he's a supplier
[50:18] he's a comforter he's a supporter amen
[50:21] he's also a corrector
[50:24] he's expressing husband he expressing
[50:26] fatherhood he's expressing all that's
[50:28] why man
[50:29] we look at how god do things and we do
[50:31] the exact same thing
[50:35] verse 26 i'm sorry verse 25 husband love
[50:40] your wife
[50:41] even as christ also loved the church
[50:44] gave himself
[50:45] for it so the way christ loved us we
[50:48] have to love our wife the same way
[50:50] amen and then he takes it to the woman
[50:53] he talks about how that she should
[50:54] submit herself
[50:55] subject to herself to the husband and
[50:57] how the church should be the christ
[50:59] it brings everything back in and this is
[51:01] our pattern right here
[51:03] but we get so much into our own little
[51:07] uh books how their wife ought to be how
[51:11] to hub and not be we write our own books
[51:14] we write our own rules and if one of us
[51:16] ain't lining up to death
[51:17] say you're not going by the book the
[51:19] question is what book
[51:23] your book or this book is supposed to be
[51:26] this book
[51:28] because we're all different different
[51:31] personalities
[51:32] god made every one of us different
[51:35] i don't think the world could handle two
[51:36] burley williams
[51:38] just one my wife deals with me
[51:42] it ain't easy to pray for sister denise
[51:47] amen let me you know
[51:51] let me finish this this is all right but
[51:53] paul i'm just relaxing to be be on it
[51:55] with you
[51:56] because i'm just following out wherever
[51:58] you need to go i'm just going to say it
[52:02] i want you to notice verse 26
[52:06] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[52:08] with the washing
[52:10] of the water by the word
[52:13] how is christ molding his church
[52:18] not a word now watch this right here now
[52:22] what's the purpose though verse 27
[52:25] that he may present it to himself a
[52:28] glorious church
[52:30] now a spot or wrinkle any such thing
[52:34] but that it should be holy and without
[52:36] blemish
[52:37] so christ gonna present his church to
[52:40] him
[52:41] so if he gonna present his church church
[52:44] to him
[52:45] shouldn't he have a right the way he
[52:46] wanted presented
[52:48] and how is he doing it by the word
[52:53] you and i we create each other
[52:56] by our words
[53:01] whether good or bad you create each
[53:03] other
[53:05] by your words
[53:09] i was talking to a guy counseling
[53:13] he was telling me what his wife was
[53:14] saying to him
[53:17] when he was telling me that i'm like
[53:20] sound familiar
[53:23] he was getting mad but then i thought
[53:25] about it months and months ago he told
[53:27] me some of the things he said to her
[53:31] and as i listened to him she was
[53:33] repeating to him
[53:34] what he said to her and he's getting mad
[53:38] i said brother that's your creation you
[53:40] created that
[53:43] she giving you back what you gave her
[53:45] and you get mad
[53:48] see in marriage it's also you reap
[53:51] what you sow
[53:56] that's why we should sow the right words
[54:00] and then we get the word back one to
[54:01] another
[54:03] the right way we create each other
[54:08] how is god creating the bride by the
[54:11] word
[54:12] we created each other by the word
[54:16] the prophet god said no church is any
[54:19] stronger
[54:20] than what it inheritance is it has to
[54:23] the word it's no stronger than that
[54:25] so whatever word is being preached
[54:26] that's how strong the church is going to
[54:28] be
[54:29] so that's why even in the ministry we
[54:31] create the church our church is strong
[54:33] through the ministry of the word that
[54:35] you're receiving it all works the same
[54:39] way
[54:40] that's why god gave us a revealed word
[54:42] in this hour to let us know what the
[54:43] mind of god is
[54:45] because he know what bride he will
[54:47] present it to him a perfect bride some
[54:52] of you might be sitting there saying
[54:53] this man
[54:53] the way this man is preaching is like we
[54:56] should never have no problems
[54:59] in marriage i don't believe that that is
[55:02] not what i'm saying
[55:03] i'm just trying to show you how to
[55:04] handle your problems so they won't get
[55:05] ridiculous
[55:09] because sometimes the problem ain't the
[55:11] problem is how you try to solve the
[55:13] problem makes it the problem
[55:18] and you know what when flesh gets in it
[55:21] that's what ruins everything
[55:25] why do i want to let you know how i feel
[55:26] well i won't let you know how i feel
[55:29] do you say why you go first no you go no
[55:31] no no no no
[55:34] it's come to battle marriage supposed to
[55:37] be fellowship
[55:39] not battleship
[55:45] that's right how many do you battle with
[55:47] god
[55:48] my lord i felt like you like no no no no
[55:50] you won't do that with you
[55:52] you'll humble yourself even sometimes
[55:55] you don't understand you just humble
[55:57] yourself
[55:58] and wait all right
[56:11] let me uh
[56:14] try to simplify this a little more here
[56:20] i want to go back to holding that
[56:22] position
[56:26] to me that's very important holding your
[56:28] position
[56:30] because when a wife gets out of her
[56:31] place it caused chaos in the family
[56:35] when a man gets out of his place it
[56:37] caused chaos
[56:39] and the children they they grow because
[56:43] when they're young they don't understand
[56:44] their place that's why you have to teach
[56:46] them as they go
[56:48] but as a child begin to grow and when
[56:50] they start
[56:52] understanding responsibility it kind of
[56:54] balances things out
[56:55] as the family goes but the
[56:58] husband and wife is important both for
[57:01] them knowing their place
[57:03] so it's more of an advantage for the
[57:04] child growing up
[57:07] when their parents are stable they
[57:08] actually mature your child a whole lot
[57:10] faster
[57:13] see me and my wife we were young we were
[57:15] immature in a lot of things and it
[57:17] affected
[57:18] i could look back now and see how it
[57:19] affected the children because of our
[57:21] immaturity it affected them
[57:24] so the children need something mature to
[57:27] look up to
[57:27] they're going to help them to grow in
[57:29] their lives
[57:30] and things are very important let me you
[57:33] know as a believer this goes for man and
[57:35] wife it goes for all of us
[57:39] do you really understand the importance
[57:42] for you to stay on the uh the right
[57:45] level
[57:46] of maturity so that you can help
[57:48] somebody
[57:50] it's very important because god could
[57:53] send somebody to you
[57:54] that need help but if you are all tore
[57:56] up yourself you ain't going to be able
[57:58] to help them too good
[58:00] so that's why we need to be stable in
[58:02] our heart mind and soul knowing where
[58:03] we're at so we can be able to minister
[58:05] to somebody
[58:06] that has needs in certain areas
[58:10] it's important for a woman to love their
[58:12] husband many ways
[58:14] many purposes many reasons because god
[58:17] might want to use you to minister to
[58:18] another sister
[58:20] but if you're struggling with your own
[58:22] husband you're gonna have a problem
[58:24] ministering to that sister i'm gonna
[58:25] tell you what you're gonna do
[58:28] you got a problem with your hug and
[58:29] you're mad and upset and
[58:31] and just just saw all of a sudden a
[58:33] sister say can i talk to you in a moment
[58:34] i'm having problems
[58:35] and you already got him you'll say what
[58:38] is it
[58:40] and if she start talking about her
[58:42] problems and some of them are familiar
[58:45] with what you and your husband going
[58:46] through i'm going to tell you what
[58:47] you're going to do
[58:49] you're going to fall into emotions and
[58:52] reasoning
[58:53] and you ain't going to be able to help
[58:54] that sister because you're going to
[58:55] start telling her
[58:57] i understand what you're going through
[59:01] these men
[59:06] you're not going to help that sister
[59:07] because now you're going to feed her all
[59:09] your emotions
[59:11] or the feelings you got to get your
[59:12] husband that's why it's important
[59:16] as a man brothers and sisters we be in
[59:18] our place in maturity in our marriage
[59:21] so we can minister to others
[59:24] same as a man got a problem with his
[59:27] wife
[59:28] you know men look different i call it
[59:30] pep rallies
[59:32] when they talk to the brother listen
[59:34] brother this is what you need to do
[59:36] get in there and take home control of
[59:38] your family you're the head of this
[59:39] house did anybody say that
[59:41] yeah yeah yeah so you get there you go
[59:44] you take control let the devil know this
[59:45] is your
[59:46] house you ain't gonna let him come in
[59:47] there that's you're the man of this
[59:48] house
[59:49] you understand brother yeah yeah yeah
[59:51] yeah he all pumped up now
[59:54] he goes home wrong spirit we need to
[59:58] have a talk
[1:00:00] we're going to sit down and talk so you
[1:00:01] got the wrong spirit all over
[1:00:03] where did that spirit come from they
[1:00:05] come from that brother
[1:00:10] that's why my brother got better saying
[1:00:12] oh brother let's talk
[1:00:15] let's go to the word this is what the
[1:00:16] word say
[1:00:18] listen brother start telling that man
[1:00:20] about his position this is your position
[1:00:21] according to the word
[1:00:23] you're the priest of your home
[1:00:27] and you have to handle it that way if
[1:00:29] things are out of order
[1:00:30] don't take your emotions take the word
[1:00:32] go back to the word
[1:00:33] let's talk about the word i said that
[1:00:35] word will come in the holy spirit will
[1:00:36] come back all the spirits in your house
[1:00:38] if you handle the things the right way
[1:00:41] but we want to do it with flesh
[1:00:44] our way our thinking it won't work
[1:00:49] battle's in the house i say it all the
[1:00:53] time never argue in front of your
[1:00:54] children just don't do it
[1:00:56] people think you know people hear you
[1:00:58] tell them that
[1:01:01] but when they get mad child can be right
[1:01:03] there they say i'm sorry baby
[1:01:06] when it's all a little mama sorry daddy
[1:01:08] sorry but it's too late

[1:04:26] i'll just be honest but if i'm
[1:04:28] struggling with something
[1:04:29] but my faith is high and i know
[1:04:33] i already see the end and you say you're
[1:04:35] all right i'm gonna say yeah i'm fine
[1:04:37] because my faith is there but if my
[1:04:39] faith is not where it's supposed to be
[1:04:41] and i'm really struggling i'm going to
[1:04:42] say
[1:04:43] pray with me not only pray for and pray
[1:04:45] with me because i got a situation here
[1:04:48] that just being honest but we want to be
[1:04:52] superheroes
[1:04:54] oh nothing wrong with me and you know
[1:04:56] you're dying inside
[1:04:58] you can't be helped like that
[1:05:02] if you ever want to read a story
[1:05:05] if you get a chance some of you probably
[1:05:08] i'm sure you don't read it
[1:05:09] but if you want to read a story about a
[1:05:12] struggling believer
[1:05:14] until everything looked at bad until he
[1:05:16] got back to god and things changed read
[1:05:19] psalm 73.
[1:05:23] it's about asaph that is a powerful song
[1:05:27] it's an honest it's a believer being
[1:05:29] honest
[1:05:30] that i'm struggling with the world i'm
[1:05:33] mad at the world because they got so
[1:05:34] much more than what we got a man
[1:05:36] and what makes this story more
[1:05:38] interesting he was
[1:05:39] a levite one of them one that carried
[1:05:42] the ark of the covenant
[1:05:43] but yet he was looking at the world
[1:05:47] and as you read that story on down
[1:05:50] he was giving the world praise what the
[1:05:52] world has
[1:05:53] i did he said until i come back into the
[1:05:56] sanctuary
[1:05:58] he said then i understood their end
[1:06:01] other word he got his spirit back he got
[1:06:03] his heart back right with god
[1:06:04] then he realized this world ain't got
[1:06:06] nothing to offer me
[1:06:09] that's the same as you and i brothers
[1:06:10] and sisters it's a pull on the world of
[1:06:12] many different ways and
[1:06:14] things in each one of our lives but you
[1:06:17] keep your
[1:06:18] heart consecrated on the word you'll be
[1:06:19] ready to realize the things of this
[1:06:21] world
[1:06:22] turn your eyes on jesus and the things
[1:06:24] of this world will go
[1:06:25] strangely i like the way that song said
[1:06:28] that we go
[1:06:29] strangely dim other words the more you
[1:06:31] stand in the word
[1:06:32] these things just start vanishing away
[1:06:34] the world don't even mean nothing to you
[1:06:35] no more
[1:06:40] i don't want some kind of love story
[1:06:42] book and pattern my marriage off of it
[1:06:45] i don't want to perish my pattern my
[1:06:46] marriage i'm some kind of author don't
[1:06:48] wrote some kind of marriage but
[1:06:50] i don't want a parent i want to pattern
[1:06:51] my marriage off of the revealed word of
[1:06:53] this day
[1:06:56] that's why i want to pray that's what
[1:06:57] god give it to us for to bring
[1:06:59] everything
[1:07:00] into perfection do you believe that this
[1:07:03] morning
[1:07:05] because every one of us has a position
[1:07:09] and when the positions find their place
[1:07:13] it's beautiful the children of israel
[1:07:17] they knew canaan land was the area
[1:07:21] they knew that they knew that what was
[1:07:23] promised
[1:07:24] but neither one of them knew which one
[1:07:26] was their lot
[1:07:29] they knew what the place was but they
[1:07:30] didn't know their life
[1:07:32] because their lot had to be divinely
[1:07:34] revealed to them
[1:07:35] through the ministry of joshua to give
[1:07:38] them their place and position
[1:07:40] the same thing you and i we know the
[1:07:42] message
[1:07:43] we we know it but hasn't been revealed
[1:07:46] to you what your position is in the
[1:07:47] message
[1:07:50] that's what the power is that right
[1:07:53] there
[1:07:54] can we say praise the lord
[1:07:57] we've been through some things recently
[1:08:00] i don't mind i'm just one of those i
[1:08:02] guess transparent person
[1:08:04] and uh it's interesting
[1:08:09] let me tell you something church i'm a
[1:08:10] pastor
[1:08:12] paul didn't tell me to say these things
[1:08:14] but i preached
[1:08:15] you know when you when you preacher get
[1:08:17] out you're kind of a little free
[1:08:20] because when your own church you got to
[1:08:22] be careful what you say
[1:08:24] i know i don't want to say that that's
[1:08:25] bad
[1:08:27] but that's the complex pastors have i
[1:08:30] will not go that direction they're going
[1:08:32] to think it's bad
[1:08:37] but i'm telling you it's pressure
[1:08:40] it's a lot of pressure being a pastor
[1:08:43] it's pressure being a pastor's wife
[1:08:46] it's pressure being past the children
[1:08:49] it's
[1:08:50] pressure ain't no other word to put to
[1:08:52] it
[1:08:53] it's pressure you
[1:08:56] would never understand a pastor unless
[1:08:59] you're on
[1:09:01] you'll never understand a pastor's wife
[1:09:03] unless you know what
[1:09:05] you'll never understand pastor children
[1:09:07] unless you do with one
[1:09:10] you have to be one to understand it
[1:09:14] we're we're no privilege no more
[1:09:16] privilege than you are
[1:09:18] we're just servants of god that comes
[1:09:21] with a lot of sacrifice
[1:09:25] i had an incident with my own daughter
[1:09:29] i don't go into detail with nothing bad
[1:09:31] bad she was doing but i told my daughter
[1:09:35] you just recently me and her was talking
[1:09:39] and uh
[1:09:43] there's some things that i don't want to
[1:09:44] go into detail i'm not trying to offend
[1:09:46] nobody
[1:09:47] but it was something she was wearing
[1:09:50] that i didn't like it and it wasn't
[1:09:54] necessarily that it was bad
[1:09:55] bad but it's representation
[1:10:00] so i wasn't going to get my daughter
[1:10:04] and say you're making me look bad
[1:10:08] wearing that you're making me look bad
[1:10:10] that's the wrong approach
[1:10:12] you just put a complex in her cause she
[1:10:15] have to grow herself
[1:10:16] and i have to let her grow are you with
[1:10:20] me
[1:10:22] so me and her was talking i said
[1:10:25] becky i want to say something to you
[1:10:28] i said when i said i said you're looking
[1:10:30] at things wrong
[1:10:32] when i correct you about certain things
[1:10:34] i say you're looking at it wrong
[1:10:37] i see you looking at it i'm correcting
[1:10:40] you
[1:10:41] because people in the church saying
[1:10:43] something about you or people in the
[1:10:45] church
[1:10:45] think something about you i said that
[1:10:48] ain't got nothing to do with it what
[1:10:49] people think
[1:10:52] because i don't let what people think
[1:10:54] dictate my thinking i can't do that
[1:10:56] if i do that i'll become a puppet i'll
[1:10:59] be trying to cater to everybody's
[1:11:00] thoughts and you can't do that
[1:11:02] in ministry i said maybe i'm correcting
[1:11:05] you
[1:11:06] because of the word
[1:11:10] so i'm taking you to the word of how
[1:11:14] a pastor's family is supposed to be it's
[1:11:17] right there in titus and timothy
[1:11:18] explains it
[1:11:19] how the children impose the bible is so
[1:11:21] perfect it explains how everybody in
[1:11:24] their position is supposed to be
[1:11:28] and i began to read it to him explain
[1:11:30] things to her
[1:11:32] and i said here's what you're missing
[1:11:35] we are all privileged to be called to
[1:11:38] this
[1:11:39] message every one of us are
[1:11:43] but i want to express something to my
[1:11:45] daughter
[1:11:46] i said it's not that there's more of a
[1:11:49] privilege
[1:11:50] but you got to really look at the
[1:11:51] privilege your dad
[1:11:53] i said yo god called your father to
[1:11:56] preach
[1:11:57] this end-time gospel
[1:12:00] this is something i wasn't looking for
[1:12:02] as he called your father
[1:12:04] i said you ought to take that consider
[1:12:07] it in your heart
[1:12:08] god you call my father to be a pastor
[1:12:11] and i want to do everything i can to
[1:12:13] support my father
[1:12:15] as a pastor line up with the word
[1:12:17] whatever i do
[1:12:18] because you called me into this family
[1:12:22] of a pastor i said when you're looking
[1:12:24] at it as a burden
[1:12:28] people look at me i said don't don't no
[1:12:30] no that's just the wrong way
[1:12:31] just don't look at it like that i look
[1:12:33] at what god called you
[1:12:35] because it's pressure
[1:12:38] being a preacher kid it's pressure
[1:12:43] but even the child if they look at it
[1:12:44] wrong
[1:12:46] don't understand it it's going to break
[1:12:48] them
[1:12:49] they're gonna make them do things they
[1:12:50] shouldn't do say things they shouldn't
[1:12:52] say
[1:12:52] if they can't catch division
[1:12:56] you can't look at it i'm burdened my dad
[1:12:59] the pastor
[1:12:59] i can't do no no don't don't don't look
[1:13:02] at it like that
[1:13:03] you ought to say lord i think you've
[1:13:06] called me into this family
[1:13:08] what can i do to contribute to it
[1:13:09] regardless of it people gonna be people
[1:13:13] people gonna say things people are gonna
[1:13:15] be people but
[1:13:18] stay focused on the position
[1:13:21] and god take care of the rest
[1:13:25] this is like right certain thing my wife
[1:13:27] want to say
[1:13:28] i know she's going to say i'll tell her
[1:13:30] don't do it because being the pastor i
[1:13:33] can look down the road
[1:13:34] know what it's going to cause if she
[1:13:35] said
[1:13:37] it's not that she don't have the right
[1:13:38] to say certain things
[1:13:40] it's just being wise
[1:13:43] because the devil life of things to get
[1:13:46] out of cater and a bunch of talking
[1:13:48] started going
[1:13:49] but never want to get to substance and
[1:13:51] base it on the word
[1:13:52] but it's talking that's what the devil
[1:13:54] liked to do
[1:13:55] called chaos
[1:14:00] if you look at the bible if you go to
[1:14:05] numbers uh i think chapter 23
[1:14:10] you remember the story when uh balaam
[1:14:13] was trying to get
[1:14:14] bailiff uh bailout trying to get baylon
[1:14:16] to curse the children of israel
[1:14:19] you remember he never do it he couldn't
[1:14:20] do it
[1:14:23] but balaam was smart he knew
[1:14:27] god won't compromise with his word
[1:14:31] so what did he do balaam taught balak
[1:14:36] it says in the book of revelation how to
[1:14:38] cast a stumbling block but if you look
[1:14:42] in genesis
[1:14:43] you're going to hear him verbally
[1:14:45] talking about it you're going to hear
[1:14:46] him talking about it written
[1:14:48] but the book of revelation exposed what
[1:14:50] was behind the scene
[1:14:52] what he did he knew god
[1:14:55] don't like mixing
[1:14:59] so he taught him all you need to do
[1:15:02] get them to mix with the medianitis
[1:15:05] people
[1:15:06] god don't like that that's what it
[1:15:08] called the feast of bear poor
[1:15:11] so what he did what he did
[1:15:15] if you go back and read the story you
[1:15:18] remember that medianitis girl
[1:15:20] and an israelite boy come together
[1:15:24] came up amongst the congregation of
[1:15:25] israel and disrespect even to the
[1:15:27] prophet
[1:15:28] it caused the plague to come but if you
[1:15:31] keep reading that story
[1:15:34] i think one of them named zimri one of
[1:15:36] them named cosby
[1:15:38] watched the writings of it they both
[1:15:42] come out of a family where their father
[1:15:44] was the chief
[1:15:48] so the devil chose two children come out
[1:15:52] of a
[1:15:53] popular family to bring it amongst the
[1:15:56] congregation
[1:15:57] to bring the influence
[1:16:01] that's how the devil works
[1:16:04] if you are gifted if you're influential
[1:16:08] and the devil know you got influence you
[1:16:09] can put on people
[1:16:11] he gonna hit you harder
[1:16:14] he gonna come at you harder just to get
[1:16:17] you to fall for that position so you can
[1:16:18] cause damage and people say look at that
[1:16:20] look at that
[1:16:22] so you have to be very very careful
[1:16:26] that's exactly right so even being in
[1:16:30] in the deacon's office the children will
[1:16:33] get attacked
[1:16:34] it ain't so much the children it's the
[1:16:36] office that the devil won't attack
[1:16:39] but he'll have to use whatever he can
[1:16:40] use to get to it
[1:16:42] in the past of the deacon that's how he
[1:16:44] attacked
[1:16:45] because he wanted to kill the influence
[1:16:47] of the individual
[1:16:48] that's why even as a congregation that's
[1:16:50] where our maturity comes in
[1:16:53] and we begin to realize this is my
[1:16:55] pastor
[1:16:56] i understand he's my pastor he ain't
[1:16:59] going to compromise
[1:17:00] we're going to be praying for not
[1:17:02] criticizing we're going to pray for him
[1:17:03] we're going to lift his children up
[1:17:04] we're going to lift him up
[1:17:05] because you got to remember if the devil
[1:17:07] can get get to your pastor he'll get to
[1:17:09] you
[1:17:10] he'll try to come down through the
[1:17:11] congregation
[1:17:13] some of the pastor's temptations i had
[1:17:16] to learn this over the years
[1:17:18] but people do things and got on my nerve
[1:17:20] so bad
[1:17:22] so so bad and i'm tore broken
[1:17:27] you know what the devil does
[1:17:31] when you're studying this is how crafty
[1:17:35] the devil is
[1:17:36] while you're studying he will give you
[1:17:40] scriptures that'll go against that
[1:17:44] person don't get on your nerves
[1:17:46] he will give you a sermon title it
[1:17:50] just right for that one person sitting
[1:17:53] in the congregation
[1:17:54] because they don't get on your nerve and
[1:17:57] if you ain't mature
[1:17:59] you're going to take his sermon with
[1:18:01] scripture
[1:18:02] rightfully divided but wrong motive
[1:18:06] and you're going to get up and preach at
[1:18:08] that person
[1:18:10] and you're going to lay you're going to
[1:18:11] preach and
[1:18:13] ones that don't know what's going on
[1:18:15] because a boy pastor was evangelist this
[1:18:17] morning
[1:18:19] what pastor dunn got in his own spirit
[1:18:23] and failed and preached to one person in
[1:18:25] the congregation
[1:18:26] is what he's done
[1:18:31] that's exactly right those are
[1:18:33] challenges
[1:18:35] that's why i was a pastor when you see
[1:18:36] that it says satan that ain't gonna
[1:18:38] happen
[1:18:39] see i can tell you that because i failed
[1:18:41] before on that
[1:18:44] exactly right hey now i was preaching
[1:18:46] too and that one individual they just
[1:18:52] yeah smiling because they know i was
[1:18:54] going at them
[1:18:57] and i was anointed too by who
[1:19:01] wasn't god
[1:19:05] jumping in the pool
[1:19:11] one person and i failed
[1:19:15] these things are very important see
[1:19:18] sometimes you don't know what goes on
[1:19:20] behind the scenes
[1:19:22] sometimes i don't know what goes behind
[1:19:24] the scene in your life
[1:19:26] that's why i would rather talk to you
[1:19:28] instead of just making a judgment
[1:19:30] talk to you what's what you know what's
[1:19:32] going on
[1:19:35] how many of you ever thought something
[1:19:36] about somebody
[1:19:39] you thought something about it you
[1:19:41] thought you was anointed and spiritual
[1:19:44] and you received hidden information
[1:19:45] about a person god don't really inspire
[1:19:48] you
[1:19:50] and then when you finally go talk to him
[1:19:53] i i was thinking i want to talk to you
[1:19:55] you know are you
[1:19:57] you know the lord was you know such well
[1:19:59] you ain't gonna say lord at first
[1:20:01] because you want to make sure you're
[1:20:02] right
[1:20:04] then when you talk to them about a
[1:20:05] situation they say sister
[1:20:07] bro i don't have a clue what you're
[1:20:08] talking about i wasn't thinking nothing
[1:20:10] like that and you go
[1:20:12] oh oh but anyway how are you doing today
[1:20:18] see you don't build up a whole story
[1:20:21] about a person and never talk to them
[1:20:22] about it
[1:20:23] that's how the devil just come in and
[1:20:25] crush stuff
[1:20:28] we're in the message elite pride but
[1:20:32] this
[1:20:32] it's as little as foxes
[1:20:36] that spawns divine
[1:20:41] that's right and i believe in all of my
[1:20:45] heart
[1:20:48] god want us to know these sheep go back
[1:20:50] not we this is nothing we don't let me
[1:20:52] know
[1:20:53] i'm just stirring your mind by the way
[1:20:56] of remembrance lord that mercy
[1:21:01] what time i come up here brother i
[1:21:02] couldn't remember
[1:21:05] what time what time i came
[1:21:10] i asked my wife what time did i start
[1:21:15] she could she keeps all the time
[1:21:20] she's my corrector well sometimes i can
[1:21:24] be preaching
[1:21:24] i might be talking about a character
[1:21:26] saying her own name i just be preaching
[1:21:27] i just happened to do like this you go
[1:21:32] and i said then i hit it right she go
[1:21:38] you see her being my wife
[1:21:43] want to make sure i'm saying things
[1:21:45] right and if i say something wrong it's
[1:21:47] kind of embarrassing
[1:21:51] get it right
[1:21:54] same thing in marriage if i see her
[1:21:56] falling somewhere she reflects me i said
[1:21:58] get it right let's do it right it all
[1:22:01] goes the same way
[1:22:05] this is the killing right here right
[1:22:06] it's flesh
[1:22:09] this flesh we just have to identify
[1:22:11] saying no i'm the bride i am the bride
[1:22:13] and i live above these types of things
[1:22:15] this is immature stuff i live above this
[1:22:19] i guarantee you it'll help your life can
[1:22:21] we give god a hand
[1:22:23] but probably gonna stop
[1:22:30] [Applause]
[1:22:32] i'll just stop
[1:22:38] praise the lord i promise you
[1:22:42] it's a whole lot more but we're just
[1:22:44] going to stop
[1:22:46] god bless you bye paul
