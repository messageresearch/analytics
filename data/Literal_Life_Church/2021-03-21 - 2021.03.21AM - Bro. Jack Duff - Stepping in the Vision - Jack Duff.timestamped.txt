[0:03] um
[0:04] last year we were planning to actually
[0:07] come last year
[0:09] and the year changed
[0:13] and uh we were not able to be here so
[0:15] i'm
[0:16] preaching a sermon that i had in my
[0:18] heart for last year
[0:21] so i pray to be a blessing to you some
[0:24] that are here have heard this but act as
[0:26] if you've never heard it before
[0:28] amen genesis 21 verse 1 says in the lord
[0:32] visit to sarah
[0:35] as he had said and the lord did
[0:38] unto sarah as he had spoken
[0:43] vasara conceived and bear abraham his
[0:45] son in his old age
[0:46] at the set time of which god had spoken
[0:50] to him and abraham called the name of
[0:54] his son that was born
[0:55] unto him whom sarah bare to him
[0:58] isaac amen the lord had a blessing
[1:02] to reading of his word you can be seated
[1:04] in the presence of the lord
[1:07] as brother paul was saying last week he
[1:10] was there for us
[1:11] in west palm beach and ministered on a
[1:14] wonderful
[1:14] topic of uh working together and
[1:18] it was just so timely for our church and
[1:20] just many of the saints were just really
[1:21] really blessed by it and
[1:23] we thank you all for uh
[1:26] allowing him to share his gift with us
[1:29] and
[1:30] um this morning you know i wanted to
[1:32] just kind of take a
[1:33] thought on step into the vision
[1:37] and step into the vision and
[1:40] um as we said you know last year
[1:43] 2020 was supposed to be a year vision
[1:48] and you know just just the numbers along
[1:50] 2020
[1:52] it just kind of set people up for you
[1:55] know just great expectations for the
[1:57] year
[1:58] and uh even though things might have
[2:00] changed naturally
[2:02] uh for most people i still feel the
[2:04] bride
[2:05] is still uh under a vision
[2:08] amen and the bride has not moved from
[2:11] what god
[2:12] has called her to uh in this hour
[2:15] and you know and it's not i don't want
[2:16] to make it light i know that we've had
[2:19] some loved ones to pass away from from
[2:22] covet
[2:22] amen and we we realized that um that you
[2:25] know there are families that are still
[2:26] you know dealing with that uh i know
[2:28] god's still in control
[2:30] amen and you know we realize uh that
[2:33] because of what happened in the garden
[2:34] of eden um
[2:36] you know at some point in time we all
[2:37] are going to face something and whether
[2:39] it goes through a car accident
[2:41] a airplane accident um you know just
[2:44] something just comes out of nowhere
[2:46] you know we all got to face this at some
[2:48] point but we we're encouraged that god
[2:50] is still
[2:51] in control amen no matter what it is
[2:53] that we face
[2:54] and you know so when we look at this uh
[2:56] this you know just looking at it from
[2:57] the year 2020
[2:58] a year of vision uh when you go to the
[3:02] doctor
[3:03] and you have your vision checked
[3:06] and the the doctor comes out and says
[3:08] you know
[3:09] uh you have 20 20 vision you actually
[3:11] walk out and you're pretty excited about
[3:13] i got 20 20 vision that's that's great
[3:16] but really what the doctor is telling
[3:17] you is that you are
[3:19] normal you're normal right
[3:22] and as as as believers we really don't
[3:25] want to be
[3:26] just normal right and one of the things
[3:29] that i
[3:30] thought to myself at the beginning of
[3:31] the year i don't want to be disordinary
[3:33] i want to be extraordinary
[3:35] right i don't want to see the usual i
[3:37] want to see god do the unusual
[3:40] right i don't want to be the same as
[3:43] everybody
[3:43] else i actually want to be different
[3:45] there's nothing wrong with that design
[3:46] to be different
[3:48] i don't want to just see the natural i
[3:50] want to experience the supernatural
[3:53] praise the lord i don't want to just be
[3:55] average i want to be above
[3:57] average i don't want to just get by i
[4:00] want to excel
[4:01] amen and uh and we don't want to just
[4:04] meet expectations we want to exceed them
[4:06] because that's the way our god does he
[4:08] does the exceeding the abundant above
[4:10] all we can ask or think so
[4:11] you know we uh you know we we saw um uh
[4:15] you know the different things that
[4:16] happened in the year but you know as i
[4:17] was just kind of thinking to myself you
[4:19] know
[4:20] a lot of people probably have a vision
[4:22] for their business and vision for
[4:24] uh their careers and vision for this and
[4:26] vision for that and you know they wrote
[4:28] their visions down but the year just
[4:30] changed
[4:30] everything hallelujah glory to god but
[4:33] but but but i said lord
[4:35] you know with all this vision that
[4:36] people are setting out you know to
[4:38] attain
[4:39] uh what is the greatest vision that you
[4:42] could have
[4:43] for us as your bride hallelujah
[4:47] and what i'm going to share with you
[4:48] today this vision
[4:50] hasn't changed no matter what happened
[4:53] in that year
[4:54] the vision that god has for his people
[4:57] has not changed
[4:59] glory to god amen and what i'm trying to
[5:03] do is
[5:03] share a portion of this vision that god
[5:06] has for you and when you can catch
[5:08] the vision my encouragement is step into
[5:12] the vision amen let the vision become a
[5:15] manifestation
[5:16] in your life hallelujah amen so as i
[5:20] thought about that and i'm just
[5:21] beginning to pray
[5:23] uh over you know what what would be the
[5:25] greatest vision that you could have
[5:27] for your bride uh this uh this
[5:30] this this came back to me i started
[5:32] looking at a section
[5:33] in the church age book glory to god and
[5:36] uh
[5:37] and and i found where the prophet was
[5:39] told to pick up his pen
[5:41] and write hallelujah and here's a
[5:43] statement that is being made here in the
[5:45] pyramid in church and he says
[5:46] one night as i was seeking the lord
[5:50] the holy spirit told me to pick up my
[5:52] pen and write
[5:53] as i grasped the pen to write his spirit
[5:57] gave me a message for the church
[6:01] glory i want to bring it to you it has
[6:04] to do with the word
[6:06] and the bride so what i want you to get
[6:08] from this is that brother branham is
[6:10] simply recording what the spirit is
[6:13] saying about you
[6:16] hallelujah the words that i'm about to
[6:18] read are not even brother branham's
[6:20] words it's the words of the holy spirit
[6:23] directly to you through his prophet
[6:27] hallelujah so i think it's important for
[6:30] us to understand
[6:31] what is the holy spirit speaking
[6:32] directly to us
[6:34] amen so it goes on in this quote it says
[6:36] uh here is what i'm trying
[6:38] to say to you the law of reproduction is
[6:41] that
[6:42] each specie brings forth after its own
[6:45] kind
[6:45] even according to genesis 1 11 and god
[6:49] said let the earth bring forth grass and
[6:52] the herb yielding seed
[6:53] and the fruit tree yielding fruit after
[6:55] his kind whose seed is in itself upon
[6:58] the earth and it was so
[6:59] whatever life was in the sea came forth
[7:02] into a plant and thence into fruit
[7:04] the very same law applies to the church
[7:08] today
[7:09] whatever seed started the church will
[7:12] come forth and be like the original seed
[7:14] because
[7:15] it is the same seat so what we read in
[7:17] scripture about the church we should
[7:19] also expect to see
[7:20] in the church today because it's still a
[7:22] part of the same
[7:24] seed all right it says in these days
[7:27] the true bright church christ's seat
[7:30] will come to the headstone
[7:32] and she will be the super
[7:35] church i like this promise she
[7:38] will be the super church a super race
[7:42] as she nears him they in the bride will
[7:45] be so much like him that they will be
[7:47] given they will be even
[7:48] uh be in this very image this is in
[7:50] order to be united with him
[7:52] they will be one they will be the very
[7:54] manifestation of the word of the living
[7:56] god
[7:57] denominations cannot produce this wrong
[7:59] seed they will produce their creeds and
[8:01] their dogmas
[8:02] mixed with the word this mongrel eyes
[8:04] and brings forth a hybrid product
[8:05] now i want to just stop there and just
[8:07] inject this you know you're not
[8:09] here in this church by accident
[8:12] you're not here in uh uh and i'll just
[8:15] go a little further you're not in a
[8:16] message church by accident
[8:18] glory to god there are many churches as
[8:20] i was driving here this morning i saw
[8:22] many parking lots full of cars
[8:24] with people inside of church amen but
[8:26] there was
[8:27] a specific reason why god
[8:30] would have elected for you to be a part
[8:32] of literal life
[8:34] hallelujah there's a specific reason why
[8:36] you would have been drawn to
[8:38] a man to hear the word of god from this
[8:40] pulpit
[8:42] hallelujah because this pulpit is
[8:43] preaching a message of transformation
[8:46] this pulpit is preaching a message that
[8:48] will change our
[8:50] our bodies hallelujah amen so so god
[8:53] does not make a
[8:54] a accident by putting you in a message
[8:56] church a message church is not an
[8:58] alternative to denomination
[9:02] a message church is not an alternative
[9:04] amen god is trying to bring you back to
[9:06] the truth because when you
[9:08] hear truth truth will make you free
[9:12] stay with me here just for a little bit
[9:13] he says the first son adam
[9:15] was the spoken seed word of god he was
[9:18] given
[9:19] a bribe to reproduce himself that is why
[9:21] the bride was given to him
[9:23] to reproduce himself to produce another
[9:26] son of god
[9:26] but she failed she she failed by
[9:28] hybridization she
[9:30] calls him to die now we could go through
[9:33] just about and i did this on last year i
[9:36] went
[9:36] paragraph by paragraph through these
[9:38] statements and i preached the entire
[9:40] year
[9:41] on this this uh stepping i mean on this
[9:44] uh pick up your pen and write i preached
[9:46] the entire year i can't take time to go
[9:48] through all that today so i'm gonna hit
[9:50] highlights
[9:50] but hopefully hopefully you'll catch
[9:53] enough of this
[9:54] where you can see yourself and you can
[9:56] say hey hey hey this pertains to me
[9:58] and i am going to step into what god has
[10:01] called me to be
[10:04] glory to god all right let's go a little
[10:05] further he says this um
[10:07] the second son jesus also a spoken seed
[10:11] word of god
[10:11] was given abroad like his adam amen but
[10:14] before he could marry her
[10:16] she also had fallen she like adam's wife
[10:18] was put to the test
[10:19] whether she would believe the word of
[10:21] god and live or doubt the word
[10:23] and die she doubted she left the word
[10:25] she died
[10:27] very important there she left the word
[10:29] she died if you want to remain alive you
[10:31] have to stay fortified
[10:33] behind the word of god
[10:37] stay for the fortified behind the word
[10:39] of god amen
[10:40] he made a mistake by trying to make give
[10:42] her own interpretation to the word of
[10:44] god
[10:44] the the word says don't eat of the tree
[10:47] it's very simple
[10:49] hallelujah very simple sometimes god
[10:51] just gives us simple commands and we
[10:53] have a hard time following it
[10:55] amen but just stay fortified behind what
[10:57] god said
[10:58] watch this he goes on he says from a
[11:01] little group
[11:02] of the true seed of the word god will
[11:04] present christ
[11:06] with the beloved right she is a virgin
[11:08] of his word she is a virgin because she
[11:10] knows no man made creeds of dogmas
[11:12] by and through the members of the bride
[11:14] will be fulfilled all that was promised
[11:16] of god
[11:17] to be to be made manifest in the virgin
[11:20] now one more statement i want to make
[11:21] here
[11:21] the word of promise came to the virgin
[11:24] mary
[11:25] but that word of promise was he himself
[11:28] to be made manifest now the angel is
[11:31] writing
[11:31] amen the holy spirit is giving brother
[11:34] branham what to write to the church
[11:36] this is about reproduction glory to god
[11:39] he was given a bride to reproduce
[11:42] glory hallelujah amen to produce him
[11:45] reproduce himself
[11:47] again you're not here by accident you
[11:49] have been elected
[11:51] by almighty god to be his wife
[11:58] glory hallelujah let that think let let
[12:00] that sink in
[12:01] god has elected you amongst so many
[12:04] other churches
[12:05] amen he's elected you to become his wife
[12:10] glory hallelujah think about it said the
[12:12] word of promise came to the virgin mary
[12:15] but that word of promise was he himself
[12:17] to be made manifest
[12:19] god was made manifest he himself acted
[12:22] at that time and fulfilled his own word
[12:24] of promise in the virgin
[12:26] it was an angel that had brought her the
[12:28] message but the angel's message was the
[12:30] word of god isaiah 9
[12:32] 6 he fulfilled that at the time all that
[12:34] was written of him because
[12:36] she accepted his word to her now
[12:39] i want to just uh break into this story
[12:41] with mary and we're going to turn in our
[12:43] bible
[12:43] to luke 1 verse 26
[12:47] uh just get that in your just get your
[12:50] finger on that for a little bit
[12:52] but i want to just kind of set this up a
[12:55] little bit
[12:56] in the garden of eden
[13:00] eve failed to hold uh stay fortified
[13:03] behind the word of god and
[13:05] and now every funeral that occurs is
[13:07] because of what eve did
[13:09] every time we go to the hospital to
[13:10] visit somebody it's because of what
[13:12] eve did right i mean every negative
[13:15] thing every war that happens in
[13:17] in in our world it's because of what eve
[13:19] did
[13:20] the plague that is striking the world
[13:23] right now it's because of what
[13:24] eve did and all she had to do is just
[13:26] stay behind one word
[13:28] don't eat of the tree that's all she had
[13:31] to do
[13:32] it seems very simple right you know but
[13:34] but here she reads it with the word of
[13:36] god and it produced
[13:37] every every evil thing that we see right
[13:39] now but in the beginning when god came
[13:42] down and he began to try to figure out
[13:43] okay what happened because
[13:45] you know adam and eve they used to go to
[13:47] church every uh every day in the cool of
[13:49] the evening
[13:49] god would come down and and one day they
[13:52] didn't show up to church
[13:54] hallelujah they didn't show up to church
[13:57] and
[13:57] and god knew now that they're usually
[13:59] here every day at this time
[14:01] oh hallelujah so god began to ask a
[14:04] question now
[14:05] adam and eve knew he was there they
[14:07] could not hide from the presence of god
[14:09] and today when people decide that
[14:11] they're not going to come to church you
[14:12] can't hide from the presence of god
[14:16] glory to god god knows exactly where you
[14:18] are so so god comes and says
[14:20] adam adam where art thou
[14:23] adam begins to have this conversation
[14:25] with god saying i'm i'm over here and
[14:28] what are you doing over there adam we're
[14:29] supposed to be in church right now what
[14:30] are you doing
[14:31] so adam shows up to church late
[14:36] and then he comes with some new garment
[14:37] song oh hallelujah somebody
[14:41] now now bye-bye by this big leaf garment
[14:44] that he's wearing
[14:45] god knows that something has happened
[14:47] god already knew it before they came to
[14:49] church
[14:49] what god was waiting for is for them to
[14:51] confess it
[14:54] god already knew what was going on so
[14:56] here they come in and
[14:58] and uh and god said now hey uh
[15:01] it's it's pretty obvious you got some
[15:03] new clothes and i didn't give them to
[15:05] you
[15:05] what happened here well you know lord
[15:07] this woman that you gave me and he just
[15:09] start passing the book
[15:12] so then he turns to the woman saying now
[15:13] what happened here eve said well even
[15:16] you say the serpent that you put here in
[15:17] the garden and they tried to blame their
[15:19] sin
[15:21] on god catch that now
[15:24] they actually tried to blame their
[15:26] decisions on god
[15:28] the woman you gave me the serpent
[15:31] you put in the guard no this was not
[15:33] god's problem
[15:35] this was their problem and they have to
[15:37] learn how to deal with their problem
[15:39] you can't blame the pastor for your
[15:41] problem
[15:42] you can't blame your mama your daddy
[15:44] your brother you can't blame anybody
[15:47] you have to accept responsibility
[15:52] hallelujah that's where god can do
[15:53] something with you when you learn to
[15:55] accept responsibility
[15:56] for the decisions you've made
[15:59] here they sit there and god begins to
[16:02] kind of
[16:03] go through all the okay well since all
[16:05] of you were involved
[16:07] all of you are going to have to suffer
[16:08] some consequences from this
[16:10] eve you know you're going to bear
[16:12] children in hard labor
[16:14] adam you're going to work by the sweat
[16:15] of your brow and the serpent you're
[16:18] going to be cursed and you're going to
[16:19] go
[16:19] on your belly for the rest of your life
[16:21] hallelujah but
[16:23] even in the midst of this god makes a
[16:25] promise
[16:27] here in genesis 3 15.
[16:30] it says and i will put enmity
[16:33] between thee and the woman and between
[16:36] thy seed and her seed
[16:38] it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
[16:40] bruise his heel
[16:42] so god gives a promise and and in this
[16:44] particular scripture
[16:46] god is already speaking of the virgin
[16:49] birth
[16:51] this is the first promise and and i'm
[16:52] gonna tell you when god has
[16:54] prophesied something it's got to come to
[16:58] pass
[16:59] if it's truly thus saith the lord
[17:02] it must come to pass now now we're going
[17:05] and we find
[17:06] you know god speaking this but isaiah in
[17:09] the book of isaiah chapter 7 verse 14
[17:12] isaiah picks up amen on this same
[17:14] prophecy and adds a little bit more to
[17:16] it
[17:17] now i want you to read this with me
[17:18] isaiah 7 14 says
[17:20] therefore the lord himself shall give
[17:23] you a sign
[17:25] behold a virgin shall conceive and bear
[17:28] a son
[17:29] and shall call his name emmanuel now i
[17:32] want you to think about this if
[17:33] you were the prophet isaiah
[17:37] you rose up in church one day the spirit
[17:40] of the lord comes upon you and you say
[17:42] oh
[17:42] i feel something telling me to say it
[17:44] and i gotta say it
[17:46] a virgin shall conceive can you imagine
[17:49] what the congregation
[17:50] thought see see we we take these words
[17:53] and
[17:54] they don't mean as much just now as it
[17:56] might have meant at that time
[17:58] a man rises up and says a virgin shall
[18:00] conceive
[18:02] the people would have went home with
[18:03] mine down us how is that
[18:05] possible hallelujah
[18:09] just the same way it is for a woman to
[18:11] have a seat
[18:12] because a woman carries the egg how is
[18:15] that possible god
[18:16] god when when we're looking at god
[18:18] things are not impossible anymore
[18:22] oh hallelujah see with us it might be
[18:25] impossible but we're talking about god
[18:28] all things are possible when it comes to
[18:31] god
[18:33] something as as difficult
[18:37] as a virgin conceiving a virgin having a
[18:40] baby
[18:44] pick up mary now in luke 1.
[18:49] what i read to you in genesis 3 15
[18:52] was the vision what i read to you in
[18:55] isaiah 7
[18:56] 14 it was the vision
[18:59] hallelujah this was a vision that god
[19:02] had already wrote about mary before she
[19:04] even came
[19:04] god never put her name in scripture but
[19:08] he did put her condition
[19:10] a virgin will conceive
[19:13] and i can go a little further with that
[19:15] god has a virgin bride
[19:18] that will conceive and bear a child
[19:22] hallelujah look look at luke 1 verse 26
[19:27] and in the sixth month the angel gabriel
[19:31] was sent from god
[19:33] unto a city of galilee named nazareth
[19:37] glory hallelujah to a virgin espouse to
[19:40] a man whose name was joseph
[19:41] of the house of david and the virgin's
[19:43] name was mary
[19:44] now now uh brother branham gives us some
[19:48] some
[19:48] insight on what's going on here on this
[19:50] day they had just come from church and
[19:53] and the priests had just finished
[19:54] reading out of the book of isaiah
[19:56] talking about the virgin conceiving
[19:57] and uh brother random says maybe mary
[19:59] and joseph was discussed in the
[20:01] scripture and
[20:02] and mary's maybe saying joseph what you
[20:04] think what do you think it means
[20:06] that the priest just read it but what do
[20:07] you think that means jose i i really
[20:09] don't know
[20:10] i don't know what to tell you i mean
[20:11] that's what that's what the prophet said
[20:13] and i believe the prophet isaiah
[20:15] hallelujah i just believe the prophet
[20:17] isaiah that's what he said
[20:19] so if he said a virgin's going to
[20:20] conceive you know what i'm going to say
[20:22] a virgin's going to conceive
[20:24] that's the way we got to be with god's
[20:25] prophet that he sent us i might not
[20:27] understand it but that's what he said
[20:29] and i just believe what he said
[20:33] glory to god so they're having this
[20:35] conversation they're talking about the
[20:36] word of god
[20:38] not even realizing that
[20:41] mary herself is the one
[20:46] that the scripture was speaking of
[20:49] she's talking about it but doesn't
[20:51] realize she is actually
[20:53] born for this
[20:58] look at this verse 28
[21:01] and the angel came into her
[21:06] uh the angel came in unto her and said
[21:08] hell thou art highly favored the lord is
[21:10] with thee blessed art thou among women
[21:13] and when she saw him she was troubled at
[21:16] his team
[21:17] and cast in her mind what manner of
[21:20] salutation this should be
[21:22] now she separated from joseph after this
[21:24] conversation
[21:25] and now the angel gabriel appears unto
[21:27] her and she's having a conversation
[21:30] with the angel oh glory to god let's go
[21:33] on
[21:33] amen and the angel said unto her fear
[21:36] not
[21:36] because she was under you know great
[21:38] duress like what is this i'm i'm
[21:39] experiencing something supernatural
[21:41] never seen anything like this
[21:43] what is going on here he said fear not
[21:46] watch
[21:47] hallelujah mary for thou hast found
[21:49] favor with god
[21:51] and behold thou shalt conceive
[21:55] in thy womb and bring forth the son and
[21:58] shalt call his name
[21:59] jesus glory he shall be great
[22:03] and shall be called the son of the
[22:04] highest and the lord god shall give
[22:06] unto him the throne of his father david
[22:08] and he shall reign over the house of
[22:10] jacob forever
[22:11] and of this kingdom there shall be no
[22:14] end
[22:15] then say mary unto the angel how shall
[22:18] this be
[22:20] seeing i know not a man now i want you
[22:22] to catch something here
[22:23] mary is is a proud of her testimony of
[22:26] being a virgin
[22:28] she's engaged to amen to joseph and
[22:31] she doesn't want to do anything to
[22:33] shatter this relationship
[22:35] she doesn't want to do anything to
[22:36] shatter her testimony
[22:38] and now the angel is telling her this is
[22:40] gonna happen that's gonna happen but
[22:42] she's
[22:42] how can this be sin i know not a man i
[22:45] thought that was very remarkable for her
[22:47] to be able to say
[22:48] something like that in the presence of
[22:49] an angel how can this be
[22:51] i know not a man hallelujah
[22:55] now watch the angel is going to share
[22:57] something with mary
[22:59] and when he shares it with her she's
[23:01] going to hear a sermon
[23:03] with language that she's never heard in
[23:07] church before
[23:09] sometimes we come into a message church
[23:11] and we hear things that we've never
[23:13] heard before
[23:14] but i want to tell you something even
[23:16] though you don't understand it
[23:18] stand behind it stay fortified with it
[23:22] it will bring you to where god wants you
[23:23] to be watch this watch this the next
[23:26] verse
[23:27] hallelujah amen what verse is that i
[23:30] can't
[23:31] uh 35 okay so it says this and the angel
[23:35] answered and said unto her
[23:37] the holy ghost shall come upon thee and
[23:40] the power of the highest shall
[23:42] overshadow thee
[23:43] therefore also that holy thing which
[23:45] shall be born of thee shall be called
[23:47] the son of god
[23:48] language she never heard before no one
[23:51] ever preached about the holy ghost in
[23:53] her church
[23:55] no one ever ever took a topic or uh a
[23:58] sermon on the holy ghost
[24:00] so this is something she never heard
[24:02] before
[24:05] and i want you to also understand this
[24:07] the angel's telling her look
[24:09] you will have nothing to do with this
[24:10] promise being made manifest
[24:12] this will come by the spirit of god and
[24:15] i want to tell you today
[24:16] amen when we talk about stepping into
[24:18] the vision it's not what you do
[24:20] all you got to do is just accept the
[24:22] word of god but the holy spirit will
[24:24] bring this promise to pass inside of you
[24:28] if you yield yourself to it
[24:31] glory glory glory let's go on a little
[24:34] further
[24:35] verse 36 and behold thy cousin and i
[24:38] love this i just love the way this reads
[24:40] behold our cousin elizabeth she has also
[24:44] conceived a son of her old age and this
[24:46] is the sixth month with her
[24:47] who was called baron now why would the
[24:49] angel tell
[24:50] mary about elizabeth how did she not
[24:52] know about it
[24:55] elizabeth was hiding elizabeth was in
[24:58] hiding
[24:59] elizabeth had many miscarriages so she
[25:02] probably thought
[25:03] i mean me with the age that i am having
[25:05] a baby now i don't i don't know how this
[25:07] is going to happen
[25:07] she didn't tell anybody not only that
[25:10] elizabeth was having problems with john
[25:12] in her womb
[25:14] he was stillborn until he heard mary's
[25:16] testimony
[25:19] one day you're gonna hear the testimony
[25:21] from almighty god
[25:23] and it'll bring life to you church
[25:28] it says uh uh he's encouraging her faith
[25:32] by telling her your cousin elizabeth is
[25:35] also pregnant with child
[25:37] now i can see mary going through her
[25:38] mind elizabeth
[25:40] now you realize the age of elizabeth
[25:45] but you said elizabeth not only pregnant
[25:47] six months
[25:49] pregnant elizabeth
[25:52] well if god can do that for elizabeth
[25:56] then god can do that for me he's just
[25:59] igniting and encouraging her faith
[26:03] hallelujah you need to hear testimonies
[26:06] that will encourage your faith
[26:08] when i stepped into this church i have
[26:10] my faith and courage
[26:12] i know what god can do hallelujah
[26:16] glory to god look amen it goes on
[26:20] oh hallelujah verse 36 again behold that
[26:23] cousin elizabeth she also
[26:25] uh she has also conceived a son in her
[26:27] old age and this is a six month with her
[26:30] who was called barren i love this next
[26:34] statement
[26:35] because see we face things church and we
[26:37] don't we don't you know we think it's
[26:39] impossible for us to overcome
[26:41] i mean elizabeth pregnant impossible
[26:45] marry a virgin conceiving if there was
[26:48] anything impossible that absolutely
[26:52] was impossible i mean
[26:55] not capable of occurring that's what
[26:57] impossible means
[26:58] it's not capable of occurring
[27:01] hallelujah but the next verse tells us
[27:04] something that should encourage all of
[27:05] us
[27:07] for with god oh
[27:10] church nothing shall be
[27:13] impossible i gotta encourage you with
[27:18] that i said with
[27:19] god nothing shall be
[27:23] impossible i don't care what you're
[27:26] facing this morning i said no
[27:28] it's included in the category of nothing
[27:31] shall be impossible
[27:36] oh glory to god
[27:39] if you're if you got a negative report
[27:41] from the doctor
[27:42] it's not impossible if you need a new
[27:46] job god can open up a door your lack of
[27:49] degrees does not stop you from
[27:51] receiving a blessing from almighty god
[27:54] nothing shall be impossible
[27:59] if you're unable to have a child it's
[28:01] still not impossible
[28:04] glory to god if you need an approval on
[28:06] a loan it's not
[28:07] impossible glory to god if you need a
[28:09] place to rent
[28:10] it's not impossible for god to open up a
[28:13] door for you
[28:14] if you need the restoration of a way
[28:16] with child it is
[28:17] not impossible no matter what you hear
[28:20] about that child
[28:21] it's still not impossible
[28:25] if you need papers for citizenship it's
[28:28] not impossible
[28:30] if you need a job transfer it's not
[28:32] impossible
[28:34] if you need a loved one released from
[28:35] prison it is not
[28:37] impossible with god nothing shall
[28:41] be impossible
[28:44] [Applause]
[28:49] mary you can't make this happen there's
[28:52] nothing you can do as a virgin
[28:55] there's nothing you can do the only
[28:57] thing you can do is surrender yourself
[29:00] to the word of god
[29:06] and look at what mary does in verse 38.
[29:12] mary said see sometimes god's waiting to
[29:14] see what you're gonna say
[29:16] mary said behold the handmaid of the
[29:19] lord
[29:21] be it unto me
[29:25] according to thy word i didn't say this
[29:27] you said it
[29:29] as the angel of the lord you spoke to me
[29:31] and all i'm going to say is be it unto
[29:33] me
[29:33] i want to step into the vision
[29:38] isaiah wrote about it god himself spoke
[29:41] about it in genesis 3
[29:43] and now the manifestation and i like to
[29:45] put it this way
[29:46] the words that god spoke in genesis 3
[29:48] were just whirling around like this
[29:51] waiting circling the earth and just
[29:54] waiting
[29:55] waiting waiting waiting for mary to come
[29:58] to the earth
[29:59] isaiah isaiah makes a prophecy and his
[30:02] his prophecy attaches to the one that's
[30:04] already worldly
[30:07] now there's a double prophecy on this
[30:09] and there was more in the old testament
[30:11] and it's just waiting waiting waiting
[30:13] and when an
[30:15] gabriel the angel comes at the set time
[30:18] hallelujah now he needs just one thing
[30:20] for mary
[30:22] to yield
[30:26] and i'm telling you all god needs from
[30:28] you this morning is you to yield
[30:31] you don't have to make it up you don't
[30:33] have to make it happen he will bring it
[30:35] to pass
[30:36] you want to know why he will bring it to
[30:37] pass because it's it's his
[30:39] word and he watches over his word to
[30:43] perform it
[30:44] he just needs some merit to rise up and
[30:46] say be it unto me
[30:48] according to thy words when we look at
[30:51] this amen and pick up your pen and write
[30:53] somebody's got to come on the seat
[30:54] and say be it unto me according to thy
[30:58] word
[31:01] mary say behold the hand made of the
[31:03] lord be it unto me according to thy word
[31:06] and the angel departed from her
[31:10] brother branham made some statements
[31:11] here that i just want to uh
[31:13] uh mention to you first first the
[31:15] definition of
[31:16] impossible means is incapable of
[31:19] occurring
[31:20] cannot be done
[31:24] that's what impossible means cannot be
[31:26] done
[31:27] but when we're so i'm gonna tell you
[31:29] just like this
[31:31] if you're a christian and you believe
[31:34] the virgin birth
[31:36] you already believe in miracles
[31:41] if you just believe in a virgin birth
[31:42] you already believe in miracles
[31:47] hallelujah all christians believe in
[31:49] miracles we believe that our god is able
[31:51] to do the impossible
[31:53] no matter what we hear no matter what we
[31:56] feel we still believe our god is able to
[31:58] do the impossible
[31:59] look at this the the the word impossible
[32:02] means that which cannot be done
[32:05] uh incapable of uh of occurring
[32:08] and uh and and you know i i just when i
[32:11] look at this scripture i realize that
[32:12] that definition goes right out the
[32:14] window because god did something
[32:16] impossible in mary
[32:18] brother branham said she had to believe
[32:19] the impossibles
[32:21] something that had never happened before
[32:24] but she never argued she never
[32:26] questioned anymore
[32:28] his word was enough for her
[32:32] is the word of god enough for you his
[32:35] word was enough for her
[32:36] he says but god takes the impossibles
[32:39] and makes them
[32:40] real when he took at his word
[32:43] he also said this but impossibles fade
[32:46] out
[32:47] when gods took at his word he said give
[32:50] us more mary's around here
[32:52] that that that can take god at his word
[32:54] and praise him
[32:56] when you feel anything or not
[33:00] whether you feel anything or not let me
[33:02] read that again give us more
[33:03] merits around here that can take god at
[33:08] his word and
[33:10] praise him whether you feel anything or
[33:13] not
[33:15] now i know you say brother jack i've
[33:16] been waiting on god to manifest
[33:18] his promise to me but how are you
[33:22] waiting
[33:24] i know you're waiting my question is how
[33:25] are you waiting
[33:27] because what brother branham just told
[33:28] us that we need more marriage that will
[33:30] wait on the lord right you know that
[33:32] they'll take god his word and while
[33:34] they're waiting they will praise him
[33:39] see praise actually puts you in the
[33:40] right attitude
[33:42] praise actually puts you in the right
[33:44] mindset
[33:46] that's that's why you got to learn how
[33:47] to worship god in the middle of your
[33:49] waiting
[33:51] oh hallelujah church glory to god
[33:54] i don't know about you but there's been
[33:56] many times in my life where i'm going
[33:57] through a little something
[33:59] and as i'm going through there's just
[34:01] all of a sudden just a song will drop
[34:03] into my heart
[34:05] and as i'm pondering you know the thing
[34:07] and i'm wondering okay lord how is this
[34:08] going to work out and how is that going
[34:10] to work out and
[34:11] what about this and what about that and
[34:12] you know then god will just kind of
[34:14] drop a little song in my heart and it
[34:15] just lifts my spirit
[34:18] and i get encouraged to away into a
[34:20] place where i forget about what i'm
[34:22] going through
[34:23] oh hallelujah i want to tell you
[34:25] something church so
[34:26] you know we we come last night for the
[34:28] for the service and
[34:29] you know and and uh brother paul was
[34:31] making some comments about worship and
[34:33] recently
[34:34] i was in prayer amen and uh and while i
[34:37] was in prayer the
[34:38] scripture just kind of quick into my
[34:39] heart
[34:41] i will enter his gates
[34:44] with thanksgiving in my heart and then
[34:48] it says i will
[34:49] enter his course with praise
[34:53] hallelujah and i thought about this i
[34:55] said the first thing david tells us is
[34:57] that we have to come and approach god
[35:00] with the attitude of gratitude
[35:04] i'm gonna enter with thanksgiving i'm
[35:06] not gonna come with a downcast
[35:09] spirit when i come to church yes i
[35:12] am going through but i will not be
[35:14] downcast in the presence
[35:16] of the king hallelujah i'm not gonna
[35:20] show that type of emotion
[35:22] in the presence of the king i'm gonna
[35:24] refuse to do that
[35:25] i'm gonna start thanking god for the
[35:27] things that he's already done for me
[35:29] so i'm going to enter his course with
[35:32] thanksgiving
[35:33] my heart has to be right when i come
[35:35] into the house of god
[35:37] and when my heart is made right in his
[35:39] presence then i can enter its course
[35:41] with praise
[35:43] sometimes it's hard to clap your hands
[35:45] in the presence of the lord when you've
[35:46] got so much on your mind
[35:48] but when you can just begin to think
[35:49] about how good he has been
[35:53] then it's easy to lift your hands it's
[35:56] easy to worship a little bit
[35:59] hallelujah church i enter the courts
[36:02] with thanksgiving i mean it's gates with
[36:04] thanksgiving that means soon as i come
[36:05] through the door
[36:07] big smile on my face
[36:10] god bless you my brother god bless you
[36:13] my sister i am so happy to be here
[36:15] everything changes when i come into just
[36:17] the gates
[36:19] you know what i haven't even come into
[36:20] the sanctuary yet i'm just
[36:22] in the gates and i got a smile on my
[36:25] face just by
[36:26] coming to the gates
[36:27] [Applause]
[36:29] and then amen now once i come into the
[36:32] sanctuary
[36:33] everything changes because the bible
[36:35] says i enter his courts
[36:37] with praise going to lift my voice
[36:41] i'm going to lift my hand if i get if i
[36:43] feel good enough i might run around and
[36:45] shout a little bit
[36:46] because that's how david told me to come
[36:49] somebody just reminded me i think i was
[36:51] talking to brother michael belton it
[36:52] reminded me of something that i said a
[36:53] brother hurt
[36:55] and and and i made this statement at
[36:56] home i said you know
[36:58] if you haven't been criticized for your
[37:01] worship
[37:03] you haven't even worshipped yet
[37:09] if there's nothing been said about your
[37:11] worship
[37:12] the way that you worship you haven't
[37:14] even started to worship god yet
[37:16] brother jack how can you say that you're
[37:17] jesse no i'm not emotional i'm in the
[37:19] bible
[37:20] because paul said i worship god
[37:24] in a way they call
[37:28] heresy that means i mean i look crazy
[37:31] did not david look crazy when he
[37:34] worshipped
[37:34] he i mean his his wife began to
[37:37] criticize him
[37:38] for his worship if we haven't been
[37:40] criticized for our worship we haven't
[37:42] even entered yet
[37:47] i'm in good company with david and i'm
[37:49] in good company with paul
[37:51] i got another one for you too brother
[37:53] random was sitting in church one night
[37:56] some saints come and they got to worship
[37:58] my brother ram said don't take
[37:59] all that why would they do something
[38:01] like that
[38:02] oh lord in my church
[38:06] the next thing you know brother branham
[38:08] you know uh began to cast that spirit to
[38:10] the stop that was the spirit talking to
[38:11] brother branham
[38:12] and he had to cast it to the side and it
[38:14] said before you knew it he was
[38:16] you know thinking about certain places
[38:18] in the bible where they began to dance
[38:20] they began to sting and it was a sign of
[38:22] victory
[38:24] [Applause]
[38:25] he said it was a sign of victory he said
[38:27] before you know it after he pushed all
[38:29] that to the side he found himself
[38:31] in the middle of the aisle worshiping
[38:34] with them sisters
[38:37] oh hallelujah won't that be something to
[38:41] create an atmosphere in the prophet's
[38:43] church will you cause the prophet to

[47:48] he's here to override it glory to god
[47:52] whatever you're facing he is here to
[47:54] override
[47:57] glory glory glory genesis 21
[48:02] we were reading this earlier and just
[48:04] want to come back to it
[48:08] oh glory
[48:18] when we look at verse 1 and the lord
[48:22] visited sarah
[48:25] as he had said
[48:28] and the lord did unto sarah
[48:32] as he had spoken and and
[48:36] as i meditated on this this verse i
[48:38] thought that
[48:39] see now in genesis 21 we
[48:42] move from it just being a promise
[48:46] that i'm going to visit you sarah at the
[48:48] time of life
[48:49] now we're moving to the stage of
[48:51] manifestation
[48:53] and what i'm saying is that as the bride
[48:55] of christ
[48:57] we have to move from just promises and
[48:59] quotes
[49:00] at some point in time we have to step
[49:02] into
[49:03] the manifestation of it
[49:07] hallelujah and i want to i need you to
[49:10] understand
[49:11] the manifestation the way it works is
[49:13] not you
[49:14] doing anything except
[49:18] surrendering that's all god needs
[49:22] a surrender like i said mary never heard
[49:24] anybody preach about the holy ghost with
[49:26] her what is this
[49:26] but she didn't argue with it she just
[49:29] said be it unto me according to your
[49:31] word i don't know i don't know anything
[49:32] that you're talking about
[49:33] i've never that is foreign to me
[49:37] but be it unto me according to your word
[49:46] god came down in genesis 18
[49:49] and he visited abraham and sarah
[49:52] and uh he came with two angels as he was
[49:54] coming down to visit them and
[49:56] and uh and god himself was sitting there
[49:59] you know having
[50:00] uh calf and milk cornbread whatever it
[50:03] was sitting there eating with with
[50:05] abraham and sarah
[50:06] and uh and and sarah was as he began to
[50:08] just kind of have conversation with
[50:10] abraham
[50:11] says you know uh now i told you that i
[50:13] was going to visit you and sarah is
[50:15] going to have a have a child
[50:16] it says uh yeah i remember that and now
[50:20] you've got to remember also
[50:21] abraham laughed at the promise too those
[50:23] of you that are bible readers
[50:25] abraham laughed at the promise when he
[50:26] first heard it
[50:28] hallelujah but sarah laughed
[50:31] and it seemed like she got in trouble
[50:33] because god said
[50:34] why is sarah laughing i just told you
[50:36] i'm going to visit him while sarah
[50:37] laughing with his back turned to the
[50:38] tent
[50:39] very easy for us to put that scripture
[50:42] and apply it to brother branham's
[50:44] ministry very easy very easy
[50:46] glory to god i see that too says
[50:49] he says but but when she laughs at why
[50:51] is sarah laughing
[50:53] behind us in the tent why is that
[50:55] happening
[50:56] sarah say i didn't laugh he says uh
[50:59] uh yes you did i heard you as soon as i
[51:02] made the promise you start laughing at
[51:03] it and you know what
[51:04] some of us come to church we hear the
[51:06] word of god preach to us
[51:08] and we laugh with unbelief that can
[51:11] never happen to me
[51:16] but one day god's going to stop you
[51:18] laughing
[51:19] and he's going to show you that what i
[51:21] promise is going to come to pass
[51:24] he said he says why is sarah laughing i
[51:26] wasn't laughing yes
[51:28] you were laughing say oh you did this
[51:29] you did that
[51:31] but we we can stop there but i love this
[51:34] scripture in hebrews 11
[51:36] 11. it shows a different side of sarah
[51:41] just like it has to show a different
[51:42] side of us yes there might have been a
[51:44] season in our life
[51:46] where we doubted the promises of god we
[51:49] doubted whether it would happen or not
[51:51] but but some some at some point in time
[51:53] maybe this could be the service
[51:56] where god ignites something in your soul
[51:59] he said god i believe that word
[52:02] hebrews 11 11 says through faith
[52:08] also sarah herself
[52:12] i like the way paul writes this not not
[52:15] just
[52:15] i'm not dependent on abraham's faith
[52:20] sarah say i have my own
[52:23] faith in god hallelujah
[52:29] sometimes you can't just depend on
[52:31] daddy's faith and
[52:32] depend on mama's faith but there must
[52:35] come a season in a time
[52:36] where you begin to stand on your own
[52:40] faith hallelujah
[52:43] because god don't have grandchildren
[52:48] through faith also
[52:51] sarah herself received strength to
[52:54] conceive
[52:55] seed and was delivered with child
[52:58] when she was past age because
[53:02] she judged him faithful
[53:06] who it promised she moved from laughing
[53:09] to one day judging god faithful
[53:11] to the promise that he made oh god when
[53:14] the bride can recognize who she is
[53:17] the prophet said the rapture will go as
[53:18] the bride we got to recognize he's
[53:20] faithful that made the promise to us
[53:22] something happened in sarah not just a
[53:26] change in her body
[53:28] but maybe a change in her attitude
[53:32] let me go a little deeper on this story
[53:34] because brother branham gives us insight
[53:37] you want to know why sarah seemed
[53:39] seemingly got in trouble
[53:41] when the angels showed up when god
[53:42] himself and the two angels showed up and
[53:44] had
[53:44] had fellowship there at abraham's house
[53:47] sarah was
[53:48] actually uh upset with abraham
[53:53] the brother brandon tells us this she
[53:55] was just coming out of like an argument
[53:56] with him
[53:58] and her argument was what look at lot
[54:01] and his wife down there in sodom and
[54:04] look at look at what she's doing down
[54:05] there
[54:05] but i'm dwelling in the planes
[54:10] because sometimes our sisters don't want
[54:12] to dwell
[54:14] in the planes
[54:17] is that okay to say that
[54:20] my face is too plain i gotta add this
[54:22] and i gotta add that
[54:24] my dress is too plain so i gotta do this
[54:25] i gotta do that sisters don't like
[54:26] dwelling in the place
[54:28] but you can get a visitation from
[54:30] almighty god
[54:32] when you're dwelling in the place
[54:37] her attitude was wrong and this is why
[54:39] when she got in trouble with god's
[54:41] because of what her attitude was
[54:43] the argument that her and abraham was
[54:44] just having ain't that something
[54:48] out of an argument god comes to visit
[54:50] this house
[54:53] you need to think about these things
[54:55] because we this is practical
[54:56] we go through things like this but god
[54:58] wants to come and visit your house how
[55:00] many might have come into the house of
[55:01] god today
[55:02] just leaving the argument i had a
[55:05] brother in my church
[55:07] shared this he said you know the husband
[55:09] and wife uh they came to church and
[55:11] had just finished arguing and um in the
[55:14] car and they got him to the church
[55:16] and um and wife was just sitting there
[55:18] she didn't have an attitude of gratitude
[55:20] she was just sitting there
[55:21] you know and then the husband just oh
[55:23] praise god glory amen hallelujah
[55:27] the wife looked at him and said how can
[55:30] you
[55:31] be such a hypocrite acting like that
[55:33] knowing the argument that we just had
[55:35] how can you do that in the house of god
[55:37] he says well you know
[55:39] the reason i can do this because i
[55:40] wasn't mad at god i was mad at you
[55:49] i'ma praise god
[55:53] we got to learn how to keep that keep it
[55:56] out there
[55:57] but come in and give god the glory and
[55:58] the honor and the praise because of what
[56:00] he's done for you
[56:01] as an individual
[56:04] the bible says and the lord visited
[56:05] sarah as it said and lord didn't say as
[56:07] he had spoken
[56:08] other thing i want you to get here when
[56:11] god came down to genesis
[56:12] 18 he was in a physical
[56:16] form when he made the promise to abraham
[56:20] in genesis 18 in the body of a man
[56:23] god was standing there
[56:26] but in genesis 21
[56:31] he does not come back in a physical form
[56:34] the bible says
[56:35] and the lord visited sarah
[56:39] as he had said and the lord did unto
[56:42] sarah
[56:43] as he has spoken for sarah conceived and
[56:46] bear abraham as stunned as old age at
[56:48] at the set time of which god had spoken
[56:49] to him and abraham called the name of
[56:51] the son that was born unto him whom
[56:52] sarah bear to him asked isaac
[56:54] when god came in genesis 2 1 it was not
[56:57] in physical
[56:58] form this time he comes the same way
[57:00] that he came
[57:01] unto mary he came in spirit form
[57:09] i'm here to tell you that for this
[57:11] promise to be made manifest in you for
[57:13] you to step into the vision that god
[57:15] has for his pride in this hour is going
[57:17] to be not by
[57:18] might not by power but it's going to be
[57:21] by the spirit
[57:26] if the spirit brought it to pass in
[57:28] sarah and the spirit brought it to pass
[57:30] in
[57:30] mary the same spirit
[57:34] will bring it to pass in us oh
[57:38] hallelujah
[57:40] hallelujah we just got to step into
[57:44] the vision there's a
[57:50] testimony here that i want to share as i
[57:52] bring this to a close
[57:55] i was inspired by
[58:01] something brother branham spoke in the
[58:02] message wisdom versus faith
[58:08] and he talked about
[58:11] brother welch evans brother welch evans
[58:15] was the brother who
[58:17] went to church brought all of his family
[58:19] and all his belongings he was there in
[58:20] church
[58:21] drove miles to get there
[58:24] he gets there to church and as he's
[58:26] there in the service of the lord
[58:28] the devil attacks him while he's in the
[58:31] church
[58:32] and while he well you know can you
[58:34] imagine go i'm going to hear the prophet
[58:36] i'm going to hear
[58:37] and i you know usually brother ram
[58:39] speaking a prayer line takes place
[58:40] everybody knew they were going to
[58:41] experience the presence of god
[58:43] everybody knew that so brother welch is
[58:46] there
[58:47] and while he's there outside in the
[58:49] parking lot the devil
[58:51] takes his car out the parking lot runs
[58:53] off with it
[58:54] guy just takes off he comes down he's
[58:57] like oh where's my car brother sat the
[58:59] service is over he's just fellowship

[59:33] a scripture and when he quickens that
[59:36] scripture you just stand
[59:38] on that scripture and not only that when
[59:40] he quickens it repeat the scripture back
[59:42] to him
[59:43] remind god of what he said to you in his
[59:45] promised word
[59:47] so this scripture was quick and quick
[59:49] and the scripture said uh if you abide
[59:51] in me
[59:52] and my words abide in you then ask what
[59:55] you will
[59:57] brother branham quoted that scripture
[59:59] back and said lord we're asking that
[1:00:01] brother wells will get his car back and
[1:00:02] while they were praying a vision
[1:00:04] popped and brother branham said oh i see
[1:00:06] a young man
[1:00:07] he's driving the car he's going to turn
[1:00:09] the car around he's bringing it back to
[1:00:11] this city brother welch you're going to
[1:00:12] find the car over here did you have a
[1:00:14] whole tank of gas
[1:00:15] says yes so you're going to have half a
[1:00:16] tech when it gets back
[1:00:18] it's going to be sitting there just go
[1:00:19] get go get your car told them exactly
[1:00:21] where to go
[1:00:22] now brother adam said when they prayed
[1:00:25] the because the young man that stole it
[1:00:28] used to be a christian
[1:00:30] he was a backslider brother branham said
[1:00:33] the prayer
[1:00:34] actually had something to connect to
[1:00:42] the prayer has something to connect to
[1:00:44] so what happened is that he
[1:00:45] ended up under conviction because he
[1:00:49] used to be a christian
[1:00:50] and god could deal with him still
[1:00:57] mamas and daddies i want to tell if your
[1:00:59] children used to be christians
[1:01:02] just say a prayer over that child and
[1:01:05] let the word
[1:01:06] go after the child and bring them back
[1:01:08] in
[1:01:09] oh it's not by might it's not by power
[1:01:12] but by the spirit of god
[1:01:15] the spirit went after that man because
[1:01:17] it has something to attach to
[1:01:20] and it the prayer they seal the prayer
[1:01:22] in the name of jesus
[1:01:24] and the prayer went after the man
[1:01:26] started dealing with him in his heart
[1:01:27] and then he turned around and brought
[1:01:29] the car back all they did was sin
[1:01:32] the word i encourage you to do the same
[1:01:35] thing just send the word of god
[1:01:40] my brother welch
[1:01:45] seemed to always have testing trials
[1:01:48] with cars
[1:01:51] but welch was selling a car
[1:01:56] said i'm selling this car for 400 first
[1:01:59] person give me 400
[1:02:00] they can buy it and i i'll be good well
[1:02:02] this fella comes along and
[1:02:04] it says uh i'm interested in your car
[1:02:08] okay well great so i just like to take
[1:02:10] it for a test drive
[1:02:11] you don't mind sure no problem you know
[1:02:14] it's all good
[1:02:16] you know fella got in took up a test
[1:02:18] drive but did not return
[1:02:22] stole the car
[1:02:26] so brother branham told brother welch it
[1:02:28] says you know uh
[1:02:30] i don't know why what that happened what
[1:02:32] happened we're just commit it to the
[1:02:33] lord in prayer that's all we can do
[1:02:36] god showed the prophet no vision on this
[1:02:38] one
[1:02:39] just committed to the lord in prayer and
[1:02:42] we'll just see what god does so
[1:02:44] just prayed over it kept it before the
[1:02:45] lord and brother welch had the right
[1:02:47] attitude in the midst
[1:02:48] of it and one day uh there's some
[1:02:50] brothers that were in the church and
[1:02:51] they said brother welch you know that
[1:02:52] car you you uh
[1:02:54] you you that man took he said we saw the
[1:02:56] car over in the city of bowling green

[1:03:16] sermon and they were leaving to come to
[1:03:17] florida and brother brother branham saw
[1:03:20] a vision
[1:03:20] of brother welch getting his money for
[1:03:23] the car
[1:03:24] not getting the car but at least getting
[1:03:25] his money but in this vision
[1:03:27] god told him not to tell brother welch
[1:03:31] brother welch had to catch the vision
[1:03:36] and then step into it
[1:03:39] so here you know brother welch
[1:03:42] is going to go with brother branham to
