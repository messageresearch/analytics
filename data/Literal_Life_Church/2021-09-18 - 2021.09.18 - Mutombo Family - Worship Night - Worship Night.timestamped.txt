[45:44] [Music]
[45:56] amen
[45:57] oh how good is it being house
[46:04] i was thinking it was
[46:06] eight years uh ago it was actually i met
[46:10] my wife we got engaged when i met your
[46:13] pastor and his sons
[46:15] i spoke to this youngest he was
[46:17] he was i think 12 he said
[46:20] me and my wife have been married now for
[46:23] uh
[46:25] nine years this august so it has
[46:27] actually been nine years
[46:30] so just
[46:31] god is so good
[46:34] i had a testimony in
[46:38] when i
[46:41] i came to the message when
[46:44] i was uh
[46:45] right around 20 years old
[46:47] and
[46:49] i met my pastor
[46:52] pastor
[46:54] matumbo and
[46:57] it changed my life
[46:59] uh it was something
[47:01] it was more than just the message it was
[47:03] the people
[47:05] that presented the message
[47:08] that people can actually be what the
[47:11] bible shows
[47:14] living the word
[47:15] seeing the miracles seeing the the
[47:18] fruits of how they are how we are
[47:22] it's
[47:23] it's awesome
[47:24] this
[47:26] if this is your first time or if this is
[47:29] something that you've been listening to
[47:31] i know
[47:32] the ministry here is is very popular on
[47:34] the internet
[47:36] dive right in and uh one thing i can say
[47:41] is that
[47:43] don't live 99 as a christian
[47:47] that one percent gap is holding you back
[47:50] from all your blessings
[47:53] and that was one thing i learned in the
[47:54] very beginning i said
[47:57] i'm doing it
[47:59] this is real
[48:00] i love the lord with all my heart
[48:03] i'm going to serve them with all my
[48:04] heart i'm gonna put him first and
[48:06] everything
[48:07] everything
[48:09] and god has opened up doors beyond
[48:12] imaginable
[48:13] uh
[48:14] when sorry i get emotional talking about
[48:16] god
[48:18] so
[48:20] we got married uh right after i met your
[48:23] pastor it was probably two or two months
[48:26] right around there we were married uh
[48:28] then we also obviously tried to have a
[48:31] family
[48:32] um and it took
[48:35] a long time
[48:36] um to the point where we started talking
[48:39] to the doctor
[48:41] seeing what was going on
[48:43] and they
[48:44] said that
[48:46] that my wife had something
[48:48] um
[48:49] that made it difficult to have a child
[48:52] um
[48:54] so we just gave it to the lord that's
[48:55] all we could do
[48:56] and we had the pastor come pastor ben
[49:00] and we prayed and we prayed and we said
[49:02] we're just going to give it to the lord
[49:04] it's in his hands now
[49:05] that's all we can do
[49:07] and
[49:08] uh
[49:10] about a year later this is close to
[49:12] three years in
[49:15] pastor ben was visiting our
[49:17] other church in africa
[49:19] and when he was praying
[49:21] uh
[49:24] god showed him a vision and he was
[49:27] he was going through speaking about the
[49:28] church to the lord
[49:30] and said um
[49:33] you know lord please remember
[49:36] my brother justin sister lindsey my wife
[49:39] you know they're faithful to you lord
[49:42] they just want a child
[49:44] and god showed him a vision and said
[49:47] you can stop praying for him
[49:49] i bless them with a baby boy
[49:52] [Music]
[49:53] and uh
[49:57] [Applause]
[49:59] and uh
[50:02] that message got back to us in maine
[50:05] and
[50:08] we just confessed it we didn't doubt it
[50:11] i said amen and we went out and started
[50:13] telling people we're pregnant
[50:16] no holding back
[50:18] we're saying yeah we're having a we're
[50:19] having a baby and they'd say oh how far
[50:22] are you i think we're like a week or two
[50:26] and uh
[50:28] people thought it was kind of crazy
[50:32] but we confessed it and infested and
[50:34] confessed it and confessed it
[50:37] and uh
[50:41] my wife wanted to get a test i said you
[50:43] don't need to get a test just keep
[50:45] confessing
[50:46] when i was at work one day
[50:48] she called me
[50:49] and
[50:52] she ended up buying a test
[50:54] i listened to this whole thing
[50:57] and
[50:58] she uh she took the test
[51:02] and it came out it was negative on on it
[51:06] and she threw it in the trash and she
[51:08] just kept walking around the house i'm
[51:10] pregnant i'm pregnant i'm pregnant i'm
[51:11] pregnant i'm pregnant i'm pregnant
[51:15] and an hour later she went back to that
[51:17] test in the trash and picked it out and
[51:19] it was
[51:19] positive
[51:22] [Music]
[51:22] [Applause]
[51:29] and

[52:34] to say god is good is an understatement

[53:04] shower
[53:05] that water touches every filthy place on
[53:08] your body
[53:09] and that word is the word of that water
[53:11] is the word of god
[53:13] and if we can be intimate with god and
[53:15] open ourselves up
[53:17] and let him cleanse us
[53:20] every filthy place
[53:22] just let it go
[53:24] and god can forgive you
[53:26] and you can move on and you don't have
[53:28] to ever look back
