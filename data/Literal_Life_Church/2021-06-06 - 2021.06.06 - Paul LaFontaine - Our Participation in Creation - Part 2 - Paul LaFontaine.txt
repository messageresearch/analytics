========================================

corinthians chapter 5 is where we want to read together in the scripture and any other visitors we're glad to have you today god bless you anyone coming in and joining with us fellowship around the world we spend a little time in the bible and see if the lord can speak something to us out of it and we're just grateful that we have our bibles and have the word of god and we're thankful to be christians today it's such a blessing inspiration to see a young heart like that singing with filled with the holy ghost and ministering to us that way i always like to pause and say in this wicked age in this age of young people without god it's so good to see a young life filled with the spirit and dedicated to the lord and i say we give glory to god for that we have so many here in the church as well and we're thankful for it you know god's doing something when the young people have an interest in god can you say man you know there's something right going on when it's drawing the hearts of the youth because if something's wrong that's usually who you lose first as the young people and that's even in our own ranks sometimes not this church but other ones where you know something's not quite right but if god is working it'll draw every age can you say man old young but when you're drawing the young people and there's something there that they're hungry for then you know god is in the midst and something's happening a special set of scriptures here and i want to continue my subject from last sunday our participation in create creation part two our participation in creation and second corinthians chapter five and verse fourteen the love of christ constraineth us because we thus judge that if one died for all then we're all dead and that so paul is saying if if that's true that we believe that one died for all of us then we have to reconcile reckon that we in our old nature we're dead we consider ourselves dead if we believe that truth but here he says in 15 and that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves so if you have a revelation of this that you're dead in christ and and the new man christ is living one of the attributes of it will be we no longer from henceforth we no longer are living selfishly we're no longer living for ourselves how many believe we're in a world that it's it's about themselves everything is about people's rights my rights themselves well this revelation says that we no longer henceforth live unto us themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again wherefore henceforth know we know man after the flesh so henceforth we don't live selfishly but then henceforth we are now looking at people different we are now looking at every individual different when you have this revelation we don't look at the flesh because the world looks at the flesh the world judges by what the person is wearing the world is judging by the person's baggage the world is person there's a helpless case there we can no longer look at what we see on the inside but we're looking to is there a seed in that soul is there a part of god in that that can be tapped we from now on we can no longer look at people after the flesh there's a lot of christians who still do that but you're living in the flesh you're not living in the spirit henceforth no we know man after the flesh ye though we have known christ after the flesh he had 33 years on earth we knew hamlet the flesh but even him yet now henceforth know we him no more after the flesh we don't know christ after the flesh we weren't there 2000 years ago but here we're here today and christ is just as real in this building this morning therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new and all things are of god who hath reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation so christ was pulling and recognizing or excuse me reconciling those back to god through his ministry but now that ministry has been given to paul and then he goes on to say it's been given to us we have a ministry of reconciliation to with that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation it's not just paul it's us why are you living as a christian you've been committed the ministry of reconciling people back to god it's pretty powerful now then we are ambassadors for christ as though god just beseech you through us we pray you in christ's dead i'm standing in christ's dead because fleshly he's not here but by spirit he's here and i'm standing in his place and saying be ye reconciled back to god what a powerful ministry amen heavenly father we humbly ask for your help in the service today and we pray that the lives that are listening the ears that are listening that you would be real to them that you would find them lord where they're at that you will draw them closer to you and that's all we pray for we know your power is able to do it there's needs greater here and listening online greater than any man can meet but god can do all things and we depend on that we commit the service to you in jesus name amen you may be seen once you shake somebody's hand before you're seated since we're allowed to do that now we appreciate your prayers while we were resting this week my wife and i had a real nice rest and we appreciate the um those who took care of things while we were away god bless those that the staff and different ones that god has given us so this morning we want to develop this thought on our participation in creation we just want to develop it just a little further and when the ministry of the last days transitioned from the first and the second poll to the third poll and that was god bringing back the open word to his people that those transitions happened in the last days and just in case nobody understands that what i'm saying when i use the word poll p-u-l-l the three polls um in jesus ministry two thousand years ago he had i won't call them polls but i'll call them phases they were three polls to his ministry they were phases to his ministry and the first one was is that he was did so many uh uh so many prayers were answered in the healing of the body the healing of the sick so that was the first phase of this ministry it it was not done in a quarter it was all over galilee and jesus phase of that ministry healed so many the blinded eyes were open the lame walk the dumb talked jesus can still do that today jesus is still opening up the blinded eyes jesus is still making the lame walk how many believe that but then he had another phase as that he could discern the thoughts and the intents of the heart and he could he could tell you what the secrets of your heart were that was another phase of jesus ministry and he that's the way that he was and god would show him by vision and he could see into a person's life both the past the present and the future by vision jesus was able to do that in that phase of his ministry and then when he come to the third part of jesus ministry it was more about him opening the word to his disciples it was about opening the word and speaking the word and seeing who would follow that and so there was three phases of jesus ministry to make it simple jesus uh in in each different level he was dealing with the human being and a human being is made up of body spirit and soul so everything that jesus came to do was to affect the human being not just in your soul but in your body as well he made an atonement for when you get sick you can go to him he took stripes upon your back he cared about your body when you're sick so jesus everything that he was was related to affecting the human being you as a human being jesus came not not so that he could show off but that he could affect you he sends his word to affect you and it's not just your soul it's your body can you say man and then it's your spirit your emotions these secrets of your heart your spirit realm and he could get into that and find out as a matter of fact today quite often well every service somebody says pretty much that brother paul did not know that but he god through brother paul through a minister discerned what i was thinking discerned what i was thinking we were talking about it last night and you preached the merry thing how did i know that i didn't know it but god knew it because he's concerned about what you're thinking he's concerned about your discouraged spirit that you have he's discouraged when your emotions are low he he is he is encouraged that he has an atonement for when you're under depression he himself was depressed he himself was low and so then i just not spend a lot of time on that because i just wanted to qualify these different three polls then we come to the third part and the third part dealt with the soul and particularly creation because when he come to the third part he was actually going to have his new creation and make new creatures in christ jesus completely new human beings would be as paul said when you come into christ you are a new creature you are a new creation in your soul level it's brand new new creatures in jesus christ and so when we talk about creation now the third pole has creative power in it to create the human being and to create something new and uh so so the the question is is why does what god want to do that why does god want to create something new why does he want to use this power it's far deeper and a lot of us believers know that he displayed that power in the third poll when our prophet was used to create squirrels uh howdy right and all these things that we are familiar with god displaying it but i can tell you that god did not bring this power to the bride he's not bringing it to her for us to create squirrels frankly i could do with less squirrels in my yard two of them out there this morning and give you said what are we going to do i'm going to do the same thing my dad did i'm going to get me a bb gun and i'm going to have a target practice to get them away from my bird feeders and uh dad's gone on now so i'd say he just he shot himself in the finger even doing that with the bb gun one day we had to take him to emergency he said don't you tell the church that his worst fear in emergency his worst fear was that they said to him said we have to report you now as a shooting incident he said i just had a bb gun well we have to report it his testimony would be ruined for life so i can get by he's god i can share with the church now do you think that god sends the third pull and this creative power to the bride of christ just to create squirrels no he did those things to say it's here his word has come back to the bride it's not that it's not to to do those things so it's the the the message of this and what it means to us is far deeper than creating squirrels and i want you to catch this through this series and be able to see it and so then at the last days jesus ministry must manifest again in all these three variations or all these three phases three polls whatever you want to call it that means healing that means discerning of thoughts and that means the third pole the opening of the word and the creative power coming back to sons of god again like adam had it in the garden we fell from something in the garden and his word comes back in the end time to sons god sons of god to give them back that power again this creative power can you say amen our participation in creation god wasn't keeping that to himself god was putting it by the holy ghost in every believer can you say amen because of this the third paul here is with us and we now because this is with us and been working and the opening of the world his word is becoming more alive to the bride through these years something has been happening because we're growing in our understanding of what this really is and it's not to show off and exercise power to the world so they can see who we are this is not a public show can you say man but there's something that we have within us that god wants to play this way to give him glory can you say amen in everyday situations i don't need more squirrels but i certainly have needs and i've got to recognize that something within me allows me to say if you say to this mountain be removed and cast in the sea that's his word coming back to the people again jesus didn't say if i say it for you he said if you say to this mountain one of the most mysterious places in the scripture and the prophet said he stumbled over it for years but you can't get away from those words that jesus said if you speak those words help us lord to see it because the third poorest paul is here we understand now some things about it that other generations have not understood we understand how god brings his thoughts to material like no other people and generation before we understand how god brings his thoughts to the people and how he causes his thoughts to materialize and come to pass we understand how that takes place god could have done it anyway but we understand from the quote i read to you last sunday which i'm going to read a little bit of it again to remind you of it but we understand how god brings his thoughts into material like no other people understand it's not just understanding today but it's not just understanding it today but sons doing it and acting upon it according to the word of god we're not in a day of the third poll that we just say we understand this and how it works but god is saying yield to me surrender to me get emptied out of all the world get emptied out of your own thoughts so this thing can work in you god bless you good to have you today don't mean to embarrass this is your parents okay god bless you good to have you god doesn't bring us understanding of things so that we can just have conventions and get excited about the understanding of it this is on a daily basis that god says i've given you my word back eve lost the word adam lost the word but i'm i've given it back to you in the last days what will you do with it and i can tell you my series is the main reason he gives it is so you can affect other people not yourself but other people that your words are powerful not because of you but because of the holy ghost in here what you say can bring life or what you say can bring death so we want further understanding sons of god are doing it and acting upon it so let's bring you back to the quote from last sunday the prophet said saint john 1 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god i don't know if you have that quote or not in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word became flesh and dwelt with us god dwelt with us in flesh he was the word so what is he saying here it was thought it was word he spoke it and then the word became material begin to materialize and that's where we have the term the word became flesh that's what he wants the word to become flesh how does god do that and the prophet goes on to explain it here he says so god's thoughts before a word it's a thought and a thought has to be created how is it created all right so god's thoughts become creation when it is spoke by the word it's not just that it's in the heart it's spoken with lips god's thoughts become creation when it was spoke by a word that's when he presents it to you as a thought his thoughts and it is revealed to you see his thoughts are there it's revealed to you then it's still a thought until you speak it and once again in the same language as jesus 2000 years ago when he says if you say to this mountain this prophet has worded it this way he says it's still a thought until you speak it he didn't say it's still a thought until god speaks it god's already spoken it through prophets god's already said he's already spoken we've got our bibles here this morning the bible is full of prophets words it's been spoken by prophets he's not saying that god speaks it he's saying it still stays in thought form until you speak it so you understand when i say we understand the process now of the third poll and that is how do we bring god's thought into material it comes to a revelation to us and that revelation goes further that you begin to speak these things and say these things and you don't realize god's creative power is in your words to be able to speak things into existence am i losing any of you boy brother paul i sure don't feel like that today this week you don't know the week i've had i'm not looking at the week you had i'm not looking at your troubles i'm not looking at your finances can you say amen i'm looking at what god's word says you are with the holy ghost and this word materializes based upon what you're speaking now this sunday i won't get into it but i'm going to talk about the power of the tongue i'm going to talk about the power of the negative effect you can have on your wife your children your husband your families the world by your words you have a negative effect but you turn it around by the holy ghost and you start peaking positive you don't realize that some of those words have his anointing in it and can change in possible situations i say praise the lord somebody ought to clap their hands and say yes that's true brother hallelujah it's still a thought until you speak it and then he goes right to you now don't you see where jesus said if you say to this mountain he goes directly to that scripture because he's in the same theme he's saying if you say to this mountain it's still a thought until you speak it it's a thought then god reveals it then you speak it and that's when it starts to materialize so back before the world was formed the logos began to speak things this was his process it was in the mind of god to have a world to have creation to have animals to have this planet but also many other planets and in his first creation he began to create and he did it by the same process it was in the mind of god and by the logos he began to speak the world into existence and the solar system and it and he was standing there today we look at it the way we look at it it's just he was standing there and he just began to speak these different lights into existence kind of like when henry put all these in one by one whoever did god seen all the feminine it was in his it was in his mind all the firmament but it had to be spoken and guess what i want to say this we really don't know how long it took to materialize the only thing we know is when he spoke it it was as good as done there's some say a day some say a day of the lord is a thousand years so it took him 6 000 years to create the world some day six days i'm not going to hassle over that with you i can believe both i don't really know but all i do know is he spoke by the logos the word of god spoke god's thoughts and that no matter how many years it took to materialize it could happen right now if it took a thousand years whatever it took when it was spoke it was gonna materialize someday because it's god's word it's not your word it's god's word and when it comes on lips and begins to speak you're not speaking just some carnal thing you're speaking his word and it has the power within it to begin to materialize and begin to form blessed be his name and so now it's a thought god reviews it you speak it so here's he's saying this and so when i say our partner participation in creation it would be like god when he was creating the solar system the logos he would invite you alongside and he'd say come stand by me here i want you to participate in this creation so he said let there be this star and let there be this planet let there be and he would draw you alongside and he would say brother paul brother kyle listen tom brother tom come i want you to stand by me today and i want you to help participate in creation because i've given you the same power that this is his thoughts it's not your thoughts i want you to participate with me in creating the solar system so god says a few things the longest said but he says now you speak it and so you're standing there you're maybe you're a little nervous i don't know but if he said it then i'm gonna speak it let there be a planet right there called venus and we don't know how quick it took place maybe it took places in the second time way the prophet described it in some places said there it was the lord says do it again let there be a planet mars i don't know which one men or women are from but we wasn't thinking about that right then you think about the lord is saying participate in creation i want you to participate now it may not have happened then even though we were in him but i can tell you as we get past calvary and the holy ghost comes individuals in the book of acts which i'll get to today we are the lips that god uses in his new creation he didn't use the lips of jesus christ he did while he was here but in the new creation which the new creation the first one the solar system then he created this earth and and everything in it okay but then when he comes to his new creation the third creation of new creations in human beings the soul being changed when he come to that i'm going to read you places in the book of acts it is that it was his body it was his people things that were spoken on their lips are what begin to create those new creatures amen so as we think about this deeply if he asks you to come and participate he certainly does in this creation and we think it happens right now but we know it materialized but when he put man on earth then we go to the next phase let's take a step back here we go to the next phase when he put man on earth he actually made man a creator adam was a minor creator himself and he participated in things the heavens was one thing but on earth did you know that he created this earth for man to be a god over and after the earth was here adam was the one that spoke it was on his lips when when it was earthly related because he created this earth for man to rule and reign on the other planets i don't know who's up there i don't know if it is up there they're trying to find out but i knew though i do know that god made this planet this earth to put his son and daughter on that they would be the god over this earth so gets us now earthly things earthly related things he gave his sons power over earthly related things my and that's why we have jesus saying the disciples saying teach us to pray and he says pray like this our father which in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven now why is he teaching you to pray that prayer because you had control over things of the earth not in heaven so much although i will say that there was such a burst of faith one day in joshua that he spoke to the son and said i need you to stand still for 24 hours now we didn't see a lot of that here in the old testament but there's every once while there's a birth of faith and a son of god catches his position he said i got something to do here and i'm just speaking it i don't have any scripture for it sun stands still and it stood still for 24 hours but anything earthly related not so much heavens but earthly related it's it's earthly things that he put his son's charge over adam says adam says this is given to me to do this and so maybe adam is standing there and he said what you know lord lord what are these little things running around over here and maybe the lord said well we don't have a name for it yet it was created but we don't have a name for it yet and the lord says to adam you're in charge of the earth you name what it is participation i i made you ruler over this earth i i i put you here to rule and reign under there so so don't be leaning back on me he said what's that little thing running around over there well it doesn't have a name i need you to name it he said all right i name you a squirrel i name you monkey there's this great big thing headed towards him you know and not to destroy him but just he's a big mammoth thing lord what's that he doesn't have a name yet name him elephant names all of them but the other thing was is that he said lord i i've been thinking about where that river is running over there and i see that mountain over there i was wondering i would like it if that river ran around this way and the mountain was over here and the lord says well speak it then i would like it to be different than that i would like that river to run around here and adam said you want me to speak it yes you speak it you're in charge of earthly things you're in charge of this if you say to it it'll be removed he said all right lord i want that river to run in there and he begins to speak these things and when he spoke them it materialized it and it all changed i don't need to move physical mountains like i don't need any more squirrels jesus said if you say to this mountain why do i if i if if i wanted to move mountains i'd move all the smoky mountains just behind my backyard over here on concierge street i'd move all of them all the smokies up in michigan now and my wife would be saying amen i would but i don't think jesus meant for us to go move physical mountains because you've got some bigger mountains than the smokies in your life when he says whatsoever things you desire in prayer whatsoever things are laying there brother brahman says these things are on conditions they're on motive and different things the motive has to be right but when the motive is right and god places a desire there then one thing needed is for you to begin speaking it that's true see this is it can be dangerous territory for people because you think you're going to get off track and the preacher is going to get off track and and you know we are yielding ourselves saying lord let me yield myself more so that you can trust me with your word bring me your desire but lord am i missing out on what you have given me here to speak and to pray and to change situations i ask you to consider that i ask you to consider if you are living below your privileges i said last sunday that a lot of you are living below your potential as a christian you have a lot more potential to be spirit-filled and moving on with the lord things are holding you back walls are up but listen your spiritual life is not over it is not done i said that about my own physical life my wife says your days are not over your life and over and your spiritual life this morning your spiritual life is not over god has many more things for you to grow into plus it'd be his name so that's all earthly things that's that's not god's creation his third creation was new creatures we have to move on now and the more that i look at this subject it seems that we have we have a huge part in pulling the potential of christ out of others we are handed the keys to unlock the kingdom within people in this work of new creations god used his own people to speak just the right words and bring others to their potentials in the first creation he by his work spoke those things unseen into existence in this new creation he is still speaking but on whose lips if something is laying there that is untapped yet word to become flesh who is it that pulls this out god works through his body i'm reminding you of our two scriptures last sunday matthew 16 18. if you can pull that up again matthew 16 and verse 18 and i say unto thee thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven acts 1 verse 8 acts 1 and verse 8 we read this last sunday but ye shall receive power but ye shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and in judea and samaria and under the uttermost part of the earth why does god give you the holy ghost not for yourself as such but you receive power that you become a witness you receive power in your life to overcome sin power to overcome the world but what's the real purpose that you speak on your lips and you are a witness to the word we're here to affect others we're here to find another elected seed we're here our businesses our money our resources everything our families we are here to serve the lord we are here to affect this generation for the lord i pray this morning god would burn every bit of selfishness out of you in every goal or every agenda or every business venture that's to self-satisfy you i pray god would burn that out of you and say i'm gonna do this lord i pray for your direction but i'm doing it for the kingdom of god i'm doing it to affect souls for his kingdom we're here for that can you say amen and a lot of believers have lived their whole life selfish if you'll catch this that he doesn't give you his spirit for yourself marriages break down because of selfishness the two fighting i want things my way but if you read the bible marriage is not about you marriage is about sacrificial life to the other person and actually for a husband you're the encourager and nourisher in the things of the lord that she is washed in other words you're providing an environment can you say man you're making decisions as a daddy of what priorities are in life and it's not the world and television and all kinds of sports the priority is the lord and what he wants to do in our lives teach your children that the lord is number one hallelujah so acts you shall receive power after the holy ghost is coming so let's just talk about that so when these new creations begin to start in the book of acts believers because of those scriptures now believers are participating in speaking it to another one to untap a seed of god thousands i think came the first day and you know why thousands came because peter had the keys of the kingdom and he stood there and they said what do we need to be to do to be saved i stumble sometimes what do we need to do to be saved and now peter's standing there and if he hadn't said nothing he has the keys to the kingdom to unlock this whole thing if he'd have been selfish he'd have looked over the crowd and said well i don't even know if god could accept you see you complicate things with your prejudice you're looking at the flesh peter had to stand that day and know no man after the flesh and had to believe the person's asking that question because something is in here saying i want to know what to do to be saved and peter had to put away what he was looking at and say i'm i'm i am focusing in on that hunger right there that question that that man asked me in the line at work that employee asked me another question i'm focusing in i said lord use me right now because the words i say can untap that seed of god that lays there i don't care if they got tattoos i don't care if they got earrings hanging out of their ear i don't care what they look like right now i'm a son of god and i'm not knowing this person after the flesh i'm going for that soul i am called as an ambassador that what i speak could untap what's in that person see we got to quit living selfishly we caught to quit judging from the flesh we've got to quit looking at the outside we got to quit giving people the elevator look sometimes we just we knock them out of the kingdom before they even spoken to us they'd never receive that shame on us that's selfishness we're not here to serve ourselves we're not here to choose who god would choose we're here to be a vessel to speak just the right word that would untap something within that person don't you dare judge them by the flesh i watched the healing line friday night at brother russell's i went over there and just enjoyed the healing life they invited the community come and be prayed for whatever need you have fill out a prayer card i went there and prayed for different i watched them come through there i'll tell you they look like some rough characters and brother brother andrew have such a burden for the community that way they look pretty rough they look bound and they were wearing all kinds of things coming through that prayer line but listen if they desire something from god let them come through there let's pray for them i walk through the prayer line myself i stood in for sister janice sister tiffany a few other needs in the church i wrote up prayer cards because i'm burdened i believe god's going to be a miracle for these people i stood there but to watch these people if you'd have judged them from the flesh you'd have said you don't even belong here but we're not doing that we're believers and we're looking for what's in that soul hallelujah shame on us as believers all these years to make this message just an outward dress code shame on us you know me i preach on modesty i preach on these things i believe them because they're in the bible but our first approach to a person is not about what they're wearing it's that soul that needs to be baptized with the holy ghost we have made this message a religion by the outward thing we judge whether a person is acceptable or not don't make this message of religion don't make the dress code this message this message isn't a dress code this message is holy ghost coming into the people by the word spoken on our lips oh i could get on that a lot more modesty yeah i've got a sermon coming up i'm going to nail it i'm going to preach it in a way you've probably never heard it before i also got a little sermon god gave me that i was so grieved i read an article from this haley baldwin uh she's the wife of justin bieber i mean bieber my heart was so grieved i went to prayer for and i want to read i want to preach a message the language the new language of the antichrist because that woman in her words shows the deception if some preacher has deceived her to present another jesus to her that she can dress almost naked and still feels like she's a christian god have mercy on her soul and the people mostly who's deceived her don't preach on modesty we preach on clothes we preach men and women are different we preach god didn't create adam and steve he created adam and eve don't ever make this message all about that because you'll get distracted by what a person is wearing does it reflect what's coming out in the heart yes it does all the more reason to change the heart we got the holy oats to change people's hearts praise the lord let's give the lord a hand while i get a drink god is good so believers in this new creation are participating in speaking it to one another in fact i'm going to go here on a limb and say there is not one incident in the book of acts where a believer is filled with the holy ghost without someone there in the body speaking something first think about it and brother bran taught us that he says the seed comes through the body he says the seed word comes through the body somebody spoke something and that day peter he they said what do we need to be saved he had the keys to the kingdom he said repent be bad he gave the key to it and thousands come to the lord and are baptized that day we don't have those numbers but sometimes we do it and that day it did it he unlocked the entire kingdom to those people by what if he hadn't said nothing it wouldn't happen but peter standing there a human being spoke just the right words and all those people were birthed into the kingdom of god he participated in the new creations and there they all were standing there we want to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ they didn't look right yet but then we something in your words drew us we want to be baptized they're all standing there they didn't look right but peter said let's baptize them let's see them filled with the spirit of god not one incident is where a believer is filled with the holy ghost without somebody speaking something and in other words there's not one incident there were angels in the book of acts that come to people there was an angel the lord came to saul paul so it's not that there weren't angels but i'm telling you when there was a new creation started of the holy ghost someone of another body member had to speak something so and that was you know let me just get to the examples here not one got the birth by an angel or a cloud or alone with their bible i'm saying that because people say i don't need a church i don't need a preacher i don't need a pastor i can go up here and live up north or way down south in key west and i just need my bible and god and i'll get it all that way your bible you should read it because it declares different than that because in the book of acts there was a guy named um well he's not he didn't get his name but he's the ethiopian eunuch and he's in the chariot reading his bible trying to figure it out and i'm sure he got little lessons out of it it was all great all the old testament stories but then he started to read these scriptures like isaiah said he was led as a lamb to the slaughter and said and he said what is this i don't understand this so he alone with his bible could not bring the new creation of a new birth so philip is called i think a deacon philip is a deacon not a minister a deacon phillips called and said i want you to leave this meeting and i want you to go see there's a ethiopian eunuch here he's sitting there with his bible and he needs help okay now this is a story in the bible but it's everything that i'm preaching they were human beings and philip had a mind just like you do and he's trying to figure out why is god sending me down there maybe he's got a little fears will i say the right thing i don't know but i'm going to obey god and do what he says to do and when he gets there he says he says i jump up in the chair he jumps up there and he's reading through the scriptures and the man says to him or philip says do you understand what you're reading see it takes revelation do you understand would you pull that scripture up in acts chapter 8 and verse 26 do you understand what you're reading and he says how can i and the angel lord spoken to philip saying arise and go okay clip down there i got the wrong one and he arose and went okay on down a little further was returning seeing his chariot read isaiah's the prophet then the spirit said unto philip go near and join thyself to this chariot and philip ran thither to him and heard him read the prophet jesus and said understand though what thou were eatest and philip and he said how can i except some man should guide me and he desired philip that he would come up and sit with him the place of the scripture which he read was he was led as a lamb sheep to the slaughter and like a land dumb before his ears so open he nod his mouth in his humiliation his judgment was taken away and who shall declare his generation for his life is taken from the earth next one and the eunuch answer phone said i pray thee of whom speaketh the prophet this of himself or some other man and then philip you see it then philip first step open his mouth at that moment if he would have judged him or let his carnal mind or his fear get involved he wouldn't and if he hadn't opened his mouth this man would not have become a new creation then philip opened his mouth and began at the same scripture and preached unto him jesus the revealed word for the hour i say praise the lord in the new testament church in the new creations philip is participating in that creation is anybody listening to me today by opening his mouth and the anointed words no matter what carnality he felt at that time or felt about himself or that eunuch he opened his mouth and he declared jesus unto him and the scriptures came alive because that's what happens people are going to read the bible but there's certain ones in there he was looking for the messiah of that day couldn't tie it together it took a holy ghost-filled believer to break it down and to be able to share with him jesus which is the revealed worthy hour what's the next scripture say and as they went on their way they came under a certain water and the eunuch said see here is water what doth hinder me to be baptized praise the lord that doesn't happen unless god's pulling something out of them by what philip just said now there's another incident in acts chapter 9 paul meets a light the next chapter paul meets a light it's jesus he meets jesus jesus speaks to him who are you lord he said i'm jesus whom you're persecuting as you go to try to put the saints in jail and my people in jail it's me that you're persecuting i'm paraphrasing this it's jesus jesus speaks to him in a pillar of fire in a light but guess what no new creation in paul yet even by hearing from jesus out of a light because god says my body will participate in this creation i'll speak it through my body can you imagine he's talked to jesus and doesn't even have the new birth yet if a pillar of fire came to you say well that's the ultimate experience that jesus spoke to me in the pill of fire that's it doesn't mean you have the birth yet doesn't mean you're a new creation yet if something's changed your life will change paul wasn't changed yet very religious man theologian all these of and now he's met the lord himself in a pillar of fire but he still does not have this new creation in his soul yet why because god says my body will participate in creation you guys have that scripture we can read through that one because i want people to see it in their bibles what i'm preaching to you today is in the book of acts so much that he used his body can you say amen acts chapter 9 and pull up if you would verse oh my i'm in second corinthians still acts chapter 9. all right so he meets the light verse 10. and there was a certain disciple acts chapter 9 verse 10 there's a certain disciple in damascus named ananias and to him said the lord in a vision ananias and he said behold i am here lord and the lord said unto him arise and go into the street which is called straight and inquire the house of judas for one called saul of tarsus for behold he prayeth and hath seen in a vision of man named ananias coming in and putting his hand on him that he might receive his sight because he had been blinded by seeing the bill of fire and then ananias answered lord i have heard by many of this man now much evil he hath done to thy saints at jerusalem here's the human side of ananias which all of you have here's the human if you read the book of acts the human side comes out a lot we think these book of acts believers are just way on the clouds somewhere just you know creative power but we see their humanness many times when they prayed all night for peter to come out of jail and he shows up at the door they were afraid and didn't believe it was peter they're praying for his deliverance he shows up at the door and they're running away saying it's the spirit they weren't even believing their own prayer that's the humanness in the book of acts you have the same humanness and yet with the holy ghost you've got god there to open the kingdom to other people and i says lord this man do you know this but he didn't say that because the lord but i'm just reminding you do you know are you sure you want me to go to this saul have you heard what he's doing to our people and ananias he doesn't even show any position he's just a disciple he's just a believer he but god says i'm going to sin and this is this is god's sense of humor because i love this god's sense of humor he's going to take the one of the greatest theologians that's learned from the greatest theologians that knows all about the old testament saul and he's on a religious agenda inquisition to kill all those and put him in jail and he knows the word and then he picks maybe this new disciple ananias and he's i'm going to choose him to go and pray for this great theologian this is god's sense of humor because under normal circumstances they wouldn't be in the same room together ananias is going to say i'm not the guy for the job to talk to him he's intimidated by him and paul probably is going to look say there's a movie there like peter and paul and ananias consist paul says who are you he couldn't see ananias and paul goes ananias ananias i love how he says it because it's like who are you who are you god just puts this arrangement together and then in just a few seconds ananias is going to be used to bring a new creation in the prophet paul he hears from jesus out of a pillar of fire which a prophet should he's going to be the prophet that's going to write an apostle that writes 14 books of the new testament he's going to go on the backside of the desert study for three and a half years he's going to have a huge worldwide ministry and god sends little ananias so he can get his birth first love god's sense of humor i love it so we learned from that that don't you ever put someone in a category don't you ever write someone off don't you ever say saul was voted by the church as the least likely person to write foot 14 books in the new testament paul was voted the least likely to succeed the very last person they would think of to be a holy ghost-filled believer and even take the gospel to the gentiles no way can't happen but don't you dare write someone off because god says in the further scriptures as ananias says this stuff i'll read it here ananias says have you seen the vision jesus and he said lord i have heard by many of this man verse 13 how much evil he has done to the saints at jerusalem and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all that the call in thy name but the lord said unto ananias go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to bear my name before the gentiles and kings and the children of israel for i will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake and ananias went his way entered the house putting his hands on him said brother saul the lord even jesus that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest has sent me that thou mightest receive thy sight and be filled with the holy ghost and immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales and he received sight for with and arose and was baptized ananias participated in that creation of paul the prophet god chose a nobody to go to a somebody so that somebody could recognize he's a nobody and ananias is a somebody go ahead put that on your refrigerator this week that was fresh that's not in my notes put it on the refrigerator god took a nobody to bring the create new creation to a somebody and teach to somebody he's a nobody and to acknowledge that ananias is the real somebody why is he a somebody why is he most important not because of ananias flesh he's holding the word he's got the keys to the kingdom what he says could have the anointing in it to break down and break every chain do you sing that this morning brother michael break every chain i thought you're saying that this one we'll sing it here in a minute after i'm done god used nobody to go to a somebody i'm trying to say that again so i remember it it's good don't laugh time you forget things too you know that yeah that's a good idea you're my age aren't you you have the same issues you're sitting there laughing at me god used a nobody to bring the new creation to a somebody so that somebody could recognize he's really a nobody and the nobody is a somebody it's different every time i say it whoo all right get up here and figure out where i'm at i it's kind of god's sense of humor can you say amen so if you're prejudging their past and it's all through the book of acts i preach a lot about through the years about peter and his prejudice against the gentiles and god calls him to go to the house of cornelius and says don't call what i've called clean unclean rebukes them and that's peter with the holy ghost holding back from telling what he knows just because he's got prejudice against the gentiles and so even with the holy ghost god has to deal with people's prejudice in this method they're not wearing the right thing they don't look the right way may god humble you and deal with your prejudice some people they only need themselves they only need their family never think of someone else never think of connecting with somebody else that their words could be encouraged to someone else in the bible they don't need anybody i say that's selfish i say that god if you have the holy ghost you have something within you to minister to the rest of the body you might say something to another body member but you're not even around them enough to allow that to happen better re-examine your life and see maybe there's too much selfishness there i need my business i need my life i need my job i need my kids that's pretty much it and that is your first responsibility but don't forget you're put on this earth to be the holy ghost to someone else and to speak words of encouragement to someone else can you say amen i think of brother andrew caruso out there friday night and when he was 2006 they were coming to the lord and they were rough guys and there was this alex who by the way preached on friday night and alex and he come around and he said there was such tension between them that you know borderline fighting and they were back and forth and then when andrew come to the lord then he shared the message with this alex after all the fighting intention alex is the one voted voted last likely to be the one coming to the word and he came to the message in the light filled with the holy ghost and preached a wonderful service now preaching this message he'll preach for us lord willing on the tri-state youth meeting he'll be here alex mcgoulas some of you know him from brother ray's church but to see what i preached today is that somebody with the holy ghost begin to speak the words and someone who is the least likely to come is now preaching the word of god and brother alex said friday night he pointed to a man sitting there he's about 60 years old and he said about five years ago he was sitting in his car this man was sitting in here there's a testimony he said he was sitting in his car and he was hit by a car at going 55 miles an hour he was hit as he was sitting permanent there he the car came and hit him that fast they took him in the hospital after a few hours the doctors gave him no hope they said if if he even comes out of this hospital alive he'll never walk again he's completely finished and it was brother alex heard about it and went to prayer and he spoke and god showed him showed him to say he's going to walk out of there he's going to be completely well in two days and that man raised his head i testified two days i had dinner with him applebee's after two days he walked out of the hospital completely whole you see and alex back in 2005 was the least likely to be anything and here he has received the word of the lord now some five years ago season for someone else to be healed listen friends god puts the holy ghost in us for a reason and it's not for you it's not for you it's to open the kingdom to that person sitting next to you or that person at work you have to be a big bible scholar oh brother paul i get nervous about what to say jesus said don't pre-think what you're going to say in that hour it'll be given to you in that hour how many remember that scripture gets so nervous about stuff we need to depend on the word that's lying within us so i'm preaching to build your faith today and i'm almost done but we have the word how many believe we have the word it's not just that we have when i say we have the word it's not just we have our bibles it's that's not that we have the word the substance of the creative power of god through the holy ghost that's the word the spoken word of god god gave us this to read but remember adam and eve didn't have this and they had all power over the earth so when i say we have the word how many appreciate your bibles i appreciate this bible i love this bible it's my favorite book but you see now when i say we have the word it's not that you're holding your bible and you should appreciate your bible you should bring your bible to church i know they put it up on here but you need to bring your bring your sword to church i'd encourage you to do that and we get a little bit lazy but i think you should you know hold your bible bring it to church but these bibles we're thankful for them because god actually did give our bibles back to us the catholic church took our bibles away from us i said the catholic church took the bibles away you can't read that only us priests can read it the catholic church took the bibles away but under luther and those different god gave our bibles back to us they got the printing press and god allowed the printing press to be to be invented so we could have our bibles back so i'm thankful for this bible people have given their lives for this bible that you have this morning but when i say we have the word as the bride and we have thus saith the lord we have it i'm not talking about holding your bible i'm talking about we have the substance of the spoken word of god to be able to speak life to another individual we have thus saith the lord we have his word can you say man eve had no bible but she had her and adam had the word and then she fell from that word she fell from it and then god gave the word back after calvary he began to give it back to the people and when the people had the word back creation was taken place on their lips and then the church fell from the word the second eve fell from the word and throughout dark church ages they got away from the word they lost their bibles but they got away from the word after the book of acts they got away from it and then in the end time god prophesied through his prophet said i will give the word back to the people at the opening of the seals the third poll i'm giving the word back that eve lost i'm giving the word back that the book of acts people lost i'm giving the word back to the people again can you say man then he gives it back thanks be to god but the word is more than just our bibles it's the power of god's thought by revelation given back to the people and when she has it she has creative power again i hope i'm not preaching up here to you today i hope i'm preaching what's in your heart i hope you're not thinking squirrels creating squirrels that's not why god gives it to you it's to pull out of you and out of others what's on the inside that is not seen never mind squirrels oh if i could create a squirrel i'd be really proof that i have the holy ghost never mind creating squirrels just try to create a better attitude in you sometimes people this message you know they want squirrels it's like just create a better marriage create a better attitude towards people use the word to create a more positive atmosphere god help us for being negative homes and negative families and and speaking gossip about the worst of somebody before we believe the best of somebody this is believers i'm talking to can you say man we can speak words of life and in front of our children we can speak negative or we can speak positive but i think we should change that don't worry about squirrels just create the right speech in your own lips and you will see god begin to work in that atmosphere create the right atmosphere in your home that one day when brother brahms home was in disarray and she was all nervous sister meaty and the kids were fighting with one another i know none of your children ever fight with none other but brother adams did i know none of you ever have marriage issues intentions none of you do my wife said sometimes people will sin they listen to sometimes sometimes my wife and i we love one another with all of our heart and we're dedicated to one another of course we're we're soul mates but it doesn't mean that sometimes we don't have disagreements it seems like people love to hear when we have a disagreement because it makes them feel good that they have them we are human beings you know and we work it out and we forgive and god's given us these things of forgiveness repentance if we don't have forgiveness we don't have nothing that's why people end up in a divorce because you haven't tapped in to forgiveness the way that you should but you know we have these intense moments of fellowship let's just call it that and that's what him and his wife were having and his wife was broken down crying and the house was a mess and the kids are fighting and you know the story a million times but there's one place i love when brother brahm says he says i just he says we're little creators adam was a little creator and he starts to use this thing in the home a lot of people want to use it at church a lot of people want to use it for squirrels but but use it in your own marriage forget squirrels create their own your just start with the right atmosphere in your home get rid of the rock and roll music and bring some good holy ghost-filled music in change the music start there buy some lafontaine cds here today in the library and change the atmosphere don't remind squirrels and how do you write listen he did that to show us five times grace he displayed it to the bride five times hattie wright the little fish that's speaking to the storm you believers know what i'm talking about if you have questions about it if your visitors ask me after and i'll let you know what it is god displayed that not so we could go do those same things to show us the word is here it's been given back to the bride now he's in a situation at home is disarray he says he said this is the way he said it he says now lord i'm going to start praying for my wife under his breath not not openly not not like some men lord use me now i'm going to rebuke this spirit off of my wife woman come at your subjection right now and everything will be fine once you get this house clean everything will be all right you're laughing because but i have counseled guys that say if my wife would just keep her house this one guy said like sister so and so in the church and i go oh no you shouldn't have said that but sometimes if my wife would just keep this place organized our marriage would be fine and i said you are so wrong you are so wrong do you honestly think that the house is perfect all your marriage problems are over you are blind you create the right atmosphere it's like lord i rebuked that spirit children you know you don't fight fire with fire you don't fight temper with a temper those kids are not going to relate to a dictator coming in but the christ that's within us you have to correct things but he just starts he didn't start speaking things yet he started praying in his heart and one of the things he said he says lord i send my peace that's within me i send it to my wife right now in other words he has something in there he's got to tap into it because she needs it right now i send my peace to my children lord settle their spirits he goes in there but then he starts to talk to the kids get him playing nice together get everything resolved with them he's doing things but he's speaking things and he said something to his wife he said honey do you remember that little dress down that you liked in the store the other day he's not saying thus saith the lord you're going to be better he's speaking now listen friends i'm right here are you right here with me he's not necessarily quoting a scripture there but the holy ghost in him is make allowing him to say just the right thing to change the right atmosphere to the right hemisphere and it happened to be let's go down later and look at that dress and get that for you you sisters should be saying amen right now and getting behind me big time some of you sisters need a vacation brothers planet do it that's that's an order from your pastor can i get amens from the sisters thank you thank you i'm on your side there next sunday i'll be on the brother's side so he does he does he speaks things but they're not necessarily things that we could you know quoting scripture and we know we say the word sometimes but these are things that have the love of christ and the holy ghost behind them that are things that can change the atmosphere so you've heard that story many times maybe it's the first time you heard it today but all it is is the summary is as brother bram is teaching us you before the fall were created a minor god like adam you fell from that but calvary has redeemed you back to a son of god again and you stand as with the holy ghost now if you don't have the holy ghost you seek god say god i need it but that's the holy ghost you stand where adam stands to create worlds and go live on them the power have you heard it before the power of the holy ghost within a believer has enough power to create a new world and go live on it it's not my words that's the prophets how much does this have so we're being we're redeemed back we're coming back to eden again coming back to a place and if you think that's oh i get my new body someday that's when i'll change and move mountains and no no we're already redeemed beloved now are we the sons of god now we're the sons and daughters of god and with the holy ghost we stand there with the power to pull something out of somebody to speak the right the word in season to change atmospheres you do it when you come to service if you'll join in some people don't join in i don't mean to make you feel bad but you're not utilizing your if you say you have the holy spirit you're not using your holy spirit to create an atmosphere for god to really do something come in here and stand to your feet and worship god with all your heart you create the atmosphere brother andrew said you're you're activating you're you're using the gift that's within me what's the word to use motivate activate there's another one operate you operate the gift that's in it people don't join in i'll let somebody else do it i'll sit back and let somebody else join in you should join in amen it's part of you being a creator are you a creator if you can if you can't do it here at church you're probably not doing it at home at all i hope you come back to my church after being so hard on you today i love you i wouldn't say it unless i love you i have no agenda i don't need your money i don't i don't need you know friend i do need friends but i don't need to be here as trying to be a friend today to pat you on the back we've got to look at what god has given to us and quit playing around with it this earth was created for us to rule and reign and adam had the power to change situations but you know what he you know what adam had adam had by the power of god adam controlled things instead of things controlling adam some of you have heard me say that before what adam had is he controlled things on earth instead of things controlling him how many people and even believers we have everything's controlling them they let their finances get awry and their finances are dictating whether they come to church tonight sometimes whether they do this can't come because and so now finances emotions family emotions is controlling them and keeping them away from god but sons of god life doesn't control them money possessions family emotions families dads and moms do not control them sometimes dads and moms need to be told listen we're going to go to church your past doesn't control you your past hurts and pains you can't let it control you i've received so many testimonies from that service i'm not building up my ministry but god using us to speak how long will you mourn that is going everywhere and there's so many places that being ministered to because why i just asked the question mourning is real but how long will you let it control you it's time to move on can you say amen and i don't mean that disrespectful to your morning i say there comes a time that you have to move on with the lord you have to say is this thing controlling me i'm a son and daughter of god things are not supposed to control me i'm supposed to control things you have a choice can you say man i know i'm i'm going along here i don't even know they don't have a watch in here yet o'clock so it is if you let me read our text just one more time it's one o'clock my i haven't gone a long time if you let me read second corinthians 5 and refer to it then then we'll find a place to close here i haven't been this long in a long time and next sunday i'll be really short don't laugh i have my uncles uh uncle jim passed away my dad's brother and they have a memorial next sunday up in chelsea for him i think it starts at 2. so more than likely next sunday will be short because i got scoot out of here and if the lord's still dealing i'll get one of these preachers and they can come up here and just continue on and i'll scoot out that was a joke second corinthians chapter five it's pretty bad when you have to tell people you were joking said to grace i told her is she here grace and hannah oh she always laughs at my jokes whether they're good or not complimented her the other day all these years as a little girl she's laughed at my jokes so our text said this second corinthians 5 let me just hone in on verse 15 15. and that he died for all that they which live shouldn't henceforth not henceforth live unto themselves first thing two things they that live should not live if you want the creative power working in your life you don't live to yourselves let me word it the way lane worded it a few weeks ago it's not about you that's what that scripture says this isn't about you it's not about you don't live to yourselves from henceforth if you have this revelation you want to see the third pole working more don't live towards yourself next verse wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh so we learn two things out of these scriptures as a prerequisite to for creation or preparing for creation to bring these new creatures later on the scripture creeks of new creatures number one don't live to yourselves number two don't know any man after the flesh no selfishness can ever work in his kingdom it's about his kingdom it's not about you only thinking about yourself and your needs won't work never touching or speaking to someone else what a shame that is don't some don't even need anyone else some don't need to even speak to anyone else but yet if you have the holy spirit we can't be selfish with it we have to speak words of life to other people second of all knowing one's after the flesh will not work in his kingdom what is inside and what what is inside that individual and what can i say to pull more out of them we can bring out the worst in people by our words the flesh or we can bring out the best in people and what's living in their soul he's committed the last verse says he's committed to us if you just look at verse 11 the end of it verse 11. no that's not it verse 19. he hath committed unto us the word how many believe we have the word and it's not just the word but it's the word of reconciliation so something cries that out in us verse 20 we are ambassadors for christ as though christ did beseech you by us we pray you in christ's dead be ye reconciled to god we have the word of reconciliation i want to live the way he wants me let's stand together
