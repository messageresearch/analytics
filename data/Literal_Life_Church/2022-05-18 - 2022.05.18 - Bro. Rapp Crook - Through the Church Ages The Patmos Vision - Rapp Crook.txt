TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the second chapter of the church age book we'll try to go through that some this evening and i'm kind of hitting highlights so there's there's a lot in there so i really do encourage you if you haven't uh if you made it through chapter one uh try to get into chapter two there's a lot more there than what i have here and just really encourage you to get in yourselves um let's see revelation 1 and verse nine i john who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ was in the isle that is called patmos for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ i was in the spirit on the lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying i am alpha and omega the first and the last and what thou seest write in the book and send it unto the seven churches which are in asia and ephesus under smyrna and to pergamos and thyatira and to sardis and to philadelphia and unto laodicea and then i turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candle sticks and then the rest of the chapter goes into the vision that he sees or the path of his vision but we'll go into that uh here as we go into the service let's just bow our heads and ask the lord's blessing here heavenly father we thank you very much for your goodness and grace to us lord i thank you for your presence here with us lord father we just ask your your blessing as we go through the service father just pray for your inspiration lord and clarity in jesus name amen amen all right you may be seated as we look at chapter 1 i just kind of want to think of it in the way that john is giving us here jesus christ is giving us here at the very beginning of revelation the setting of the entire story that we're getting ready to have and it's kind of like some of us might be readers get this set up here wonderful well we might be readers i enjoy a a good mystery and you can be reading it can be a page turner it can be late at night and then you're tired you know you really should be going to bed but you is he going to is the guy going to survive the night or not it's the point of utmost suspense so that you can get a good night's sleep and still make to work on time the next morning you might peek back at the very last page of the book and see oh okay the hero is all right in the end anyhow and that's the kind of effect that we have here in this path vision it's the very beginning of this great drama that's going to be playing out in the church ages where i mean all the devil's throwing everything he has at this new church from the day of pentecost so he's throwing everything we're going to be seeing beasts coming out of the closet just he's just throwing everything of the horse riders everything like is this little church going to make it or not at the very beginning we have a very large dose of foreshadowing we see the victorious christ coming back with eyes of fire with hit with with his with his white wool with his feet like brass he's coming back as a victorious judge so we can set off on this journey through the church ages knowing that in the end we're going to win so we can read the story relaxed and enjoy it because there's an assurance we're going to make it and as we look at the vision this evening pray the lord will help us to look at it not just on the level of what's happening in the church ages but what's happening there also is happening in our own lives because we can look in the bible and say yes there's a lot the devil's going to be throwing everything he has at us we'll be going through times of turmoil times of stress short times of tribulation but we can sit back and enjoy the journey because we have an assurance that we're going to win with jesus christ kind of like the like we heard sunday as long as he's in your boat you're going to make it that's the important thing and that's what we kind of see here with the patmos vision so we read our text and just by way of review the uh the seven churches are located historically there in what's uh present-day turkey and there they are john ministered especially in the at the church of ephesus for quite some time but in the uh i think the at the end of the first century um the emperor do mission um it launched a fresh assault of persecutions against the church and he uh took john himself and the isle of patmos is uh let's see if i can find it can you see my mouse up there no you can't i can probably put this on there that will we won't get too techy the iron of patmos is right there to the south east to the southwest of ephesus and it was not a vacation destination if you read about it in the uh church age book um brother branham describes it but the greek word itself means my killing and you can my maybe you know pathos has to do with with great feeling where he's sent to the isle of patmos and that's my killing i just thought that there's there's a little message in there because don't times of personal suffering and distress come before outpourings of god's revelation it certainly did in john's life we can look back at our own lives and we've gone through times of great difficulty oh man when we look back we wouldn't trade them for the world because of what came after them and the and the trick is to have that same attitude as we're going through them that yes god is with us i wouldn't trade this for the world because of what he's building in me now it was a it was a volcanic island very rocky treeless landscape lifeless landscape there wasn't much there except brother branham says it was rocky infested with snakes lizards and scorpions it had very little commercial value the romans used it as a penal colony where they would send all the troublemakers over there kind of like we the british sent all the troublemakers to georgia or to australia all the unwanted send them far away where they can't cause any trouble that is where john was sent and when john opens up this verse 9 he says i john who also am your brother and companion tribulation all christians at this time were going through great trial and great stress and john's saying i am your brother in this i'm going through the very kind of same things that you are going through as well and he's he's doing this in the patience of jesus christ and if you look at the very beginning of the chapter brother branham relates the story how at this time the early church was going through great persecutions their religion was not only everywhere spoken against but the people themselves were imprisoned and killed john like multitudes of others was now suffering imprisonment for the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ it says when arrested they tried in vain to kill john by boiling him in oil for 24 hours and the enraged and powerless officials then sentenced him to patmos as a witch but he says but god was with him and he was spared to leave the island and returned to ephesus where he again continued to pastor until the time of his death and brother braham says this this the time period he's here on patmos was a couple years so it wasn't that he just saw all these visions and one afternoon and then wrote them down but i don't know how it went exactly but it was a period of time with angel meeting him messengers meeting him and sharing more and more with him and the last last time i felt kind of bad after we had their uh session over to god that i felt like i had to rush and get through it all i'm gonna try to take a little easier so if you have a question to draw it down or you just raise your hand that's not going to be a violation of any church order if you have a question i'm happy to put the brake on we'll just kind of go where we go but i want to think about the very same demonic power that was persecuting john that day it's the same demonic power that's still behind persecution of christians the persecution of the bride today why is that well you can look in the book of daniel the demonic power behind john's persecution was the very one that's behind ours the book of daniel nebuchadnezzar gives it receives a dream in daniel chapter 2 where he sees this this great image and daniel interprets this dream for nebuchadnezzar and what this is this great image with a head of gold daniel says nebuchadnezzar you are that head of gold but after you is going to come another kingdom not quite as great as you are but it'll be the medes and persians and after them they'll come another kingdom and this is the belly of brass and just the metals are getting less and less valuable and at the very bottom after them will become a very different kingdom legs of iron feet of iron and clay and this kingdom is going to be different than all the rest and at the bottom of our notes we see daniel describing on page one how the fourth kingdom is going to be strong as iron for as much as iron breaks in pieces and subdues all things there's iron that breaketh all these shall it break in pieces and brews and whereas thou sawest the feet and the toes part of potter's clay part of iron this kingdom shall be divided but if there shall be in it of the strength of the iron for as much as you saw the iron mixed with miry clay and the toes of the feet were part iron part of clay so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken this kingdom is different than the others it doesn't end in the same way the others do where another kingdom comes and just replaces it it's different this kingdom is a mystery kingdom it just continues into the future past past daniel's lifetime past this time passed all the way into the future until finally jesus christ kingdom comes back and with a stone out of a mountain without coming out hands it smites all this image and destroys world systems well daniel chapter 7 daniel sees another vision that that's different the same different symbols but they're representing the same thing he sees four beasts again first one's a lion and that runs parallel with the image that nebuchadnezzar had seen that lion is going to be babylon just like the head of gold was babylon and then after he sees this great bear and the bear that's going to be the one that defeats the lion this is the king of the medial persians just like the silver was the next kingdom in the first vision daniel two and after that comes this leopard this this fast fast beast fast just like this is uh representing alexander the greats empire who is able to conquer the known world in such a short time and then finally there's this uh fourth kingdom that's different than all the rest again and on the top of page two in the notes we see um daniel's talking about this this fourth kingdom after this i saw on the night visions and behold a fourth beast dreadful and terrible and strong exceedingly and it had great iron teeth it devoured break in pieces stamped the residue at the feet of it and it was diverse it was different from all the beasts that were before this fourth kingdom is different the other ones are defeated in our time and they're replaced by something else this fourth kingdom it goes on and on until god himself calls it into it and it's this fourth kingdom that's actually this kingdom it started out as a pagan rome and it was partly strong and partly broken and then pagan rome is replaced by by papal rome and we see a couple and we see this this fourth kingdom it goes on and on on in and into the future and that's actually where we would put the church ages all of this all the time it's in in the book of revelation the time period that we know as the church ages that takes place under the worldly domination of this fourth mystery beast and then in revelation chapter 13 verse three this is on page two of the notes talks about john is now seeing revelation 13 and daniel 7 kind of run in parallel revelation 13 if you describes that same fourth beast in daniel 7 that the seven heads the ten horns there's a lot of similarities there because they're the same beast in revelation 13 3 it says i saw one of his heads of this beast as it were wounded to death and this deadly wound was healed this is when pagan roam it seems to be wounded to death we've got them but no it resurrects itself as papal rome and the same thing in revelation 17 8 this beast is called the beast that was and is not and yet is pagan rome is there pagan rome falls but yet it's resurrected in papal rome it's still there it was is not and yet is and brother branham talks about this in many places here's a real succinct quote from the 70th week of daniel we know beyond any shadow of doubt who that beast was that power that had the deadly wound but did live it was when pagan rome was killed and papal rome took its place when pagan rome was killed and papal power took its place that very same spirit that had john on patmos might be the same is the same spirit that's persecuting us in different ways now um in the 20th century there's um they saw the rise of totalitarian governments they're trying to control their people and persecute their people there were books written about soviet russia and stalinism and one was like 1984 where big brother razir trying to persecute and control the population so much and you said this is kind of the strategy of of pagan rome for a long time we just persecute those christians beat the torah out of them so they'll stop being christians that's how one uh one book was written about totalitarian societies controlling there's another book that was written i forget the name of it now but the point of the book was that if we can just get the people love entertaining themselves and pursuing the next pleasure getting their next great kick then we will be able to control them anyway because they won't care about anything except more and more pleasure and i think pagan roman papal rome were not being persecuted like john was being boiled in oil what about the things that we get plugged into and are submersing ourselves we might not be immersing ourselves in boiling oil we might be immersing ourselves in ah the wonderful most wonderful bubble bath there is it's a very pleasant experience it's distracting us and keeping ourselves from what's most important and that's a different kind of persecution because we don't experience it that way but pagan power papal power doing it's achieving the same effect that persecution might be experienced differently by us in the moment that makes sense so um john says he is um he was in the spirit on the lord's day and he he brother brandon emphasizes here in the second chapter of the church age book that john is taken out of the day of man and he's transported someday into the future into the day of the lord and he emphasizes here multiple times this day our day right now this is a man's day it's man's doings man's work man's church man's ideas but the day of the lord is coming we live in the time period where our own personal efforts are emphasized to achieve all kinds of things i think brother paul's quoted watchmen knee how great the american church is and they accomplish so much without praying because it's a day of man we do so much in trying to do it in our own experience and i would say our challenge today is to walk in the spirit even while we're living in the day of man we have to walk in the spirit even though our tendency is to do so much by ourselves to do to improve ourselves etc the day we're living in brother branham says the god of this evil age it's called in the bible the day of man this is not god's day he says this is choosing day either live for today and die or choose god and live what day are we going to going going to live for so this is the day of man um we're waiting for the day of the lord to come and at this place in the message brother branham stops and talks a little bit about uh the sabbath being the um being being the day of rest and he talks about the sacharidarians or i think he's speaking at large about seventh day adventists and other groups who look at look at saturday as being the sabbath and if you keep the sabbath that is that is the day of rest and that is what you're supposed to be doing and brother branham stops here i'm not going to stop a real long time on it but he makes a good point evan read those couple pages 42 to 44 in the church age book that keeping a certain day keeping anything of a certain law that doesn't give us rest we can do all kinds of things on our own thinking we're going to achieve a certain feeling a certain rest but that's not it if that were the case it's all by our own works anyhow but the sabbath isn't in keeping a certain holy day brother brahm talks about that quote in colossians 2 16 the best sabbath observers that were around on jesus day jesus said come unto me and i will give you rest he was the source of rest then he talks about in isaiah chapter 28 where is the rest going to come from it says with stammering lips another tongue i i will speak to you this is the rest that was spoken of and that was that rest was given and was accompanied by stammering lips and another tongue on the day of pentecost and that was a vindication that the holy ghost that's the rest so brother branham emphasizes in this day of man keeping a certain holy day anything else that we do that's not the rest that we can be really good things but that's not the rest the rest is ceasing from our works and resting in god's works the day of man does put our focus on on man's works and if you go into book shops like like i do from time to time it's amazing how huge the self-help section is it's just expansive and there's self-help titles on on everything there's even self-help books on how to write self-help books because it's the day of man we want to improve ourselves by our own strength because we want to be able to have a certain to to achieve a certain standard we want to do it on our own i was looking at this last night i mean six books to read during burnout when you feel exhausted 25 book street if you're feeling stuck and unmotivated i can imagine how would you feel if i came to you and here you're feeling stuck read these books i mean that's that's not going to help at all but that's the day of man we kind of buy into this we got all these oh yeah i'll take this i want to help i want help why help when we come home crashing exhausted by this the burden of all these self-help books because we can't help ourselves we need god to do it so we need to get out of the spirit of the day of marriage i got to do this i've got to do this the keys in this book the keys in this book we've got to get out of that spirit and we have to get in the holy spirit because notice when john got in this spirit says i was in the spirit fine just imagine john is on this penal colony this island with snakes and lizards and everything like that now and all these he probably wasn't the only one on there it probably wasn't a really encouraging holy ghost revival atmosphere on that island and it would be very easy to get in another spirit besides god's spirit on the island but think it's the very same spirit that was oppressing him that oppresses you and me do we have a heart of getting in the holy spirit sometimes yes we do it might not be because of all the terrible experiences we have we have all these other distractions but those distractions are the very same persecuting spirit trying to fool us not make us hurt it not make them hurt us so we keep on doing it's the same spirit but john had to make a choice there i'm going to get in the spirit i want to be in this spirit he opened himself up for that and as soon as he gets in the spirit he gets in the spirit on the lord's day and the voice is behind him what does this show us when we're in our own spirit when everything around us we get all turned around and we're finally in the spirit like lord and he turns i'm back here it's when we're in the spirit we realize how turned around we really are and is it isn't it so easy to get involved in the rat race of all our different priorities and we think this is important we think that's important we think that's important and then we get into a wonderful church service the holy spirit just comes down we just enjoy his presence we're just immersed in his presence and we leave and like wow nothing to what i was so worried about being so important none of that's really important after all lord i just want one thing if i can just dwell on your courts that's the most wonderful thing there is when we get in the spirit we realize how turned around we are when i was uh when i was a teenager we played little flight simulator games and in those days we had joysticks didn't we ever play a game with a joystick yeah okay very good well after a while you're playing the game with the joystick and all of a sudden you're doing this thing and your plane's not doing what it's supposed to do and you realize you have to recalibrate the joystick so you have to like tell the joystick again where the middle point is and once it does that then you can fly good again that's like what getting in the spirit is it has to you have to recalibrate this is this is the middle this is the middle if you get the middle right you can fly straight but if you don't get the middle right you're going to be your plans will do all kinds of things you'll be work trying to get that joystick you'll break the joystick eventually you have to get recalibrated we get recalibrated by getting in the spirit and when we get in the spirit god turned us around so we see him and not our circumstances and brother branham says that you can't do any good until you first get in the spirit you can't do any good until you get first get in the spirit god can't use you we do all we try to do all kinds of things for god in our own spirit a lot of times we train we do it the best of intentions but oh my it's so much better to hold our tongue sometimes and get out of our spirit and get his spirit in my some things a lot of things to be done more quickly if we do that until we're in the spirit we really can't see our circumstances as they truly are and until we're in the spirit we can't see ourselves as we truly are either we have to get in the spirit and when john finally got in the spirit the spirit of god points him in the right direction again i wonder how long john had to be on the isle of patmos before he got in the spirit it could have been he was there for a year and a half before he finally said okay well i'm going to stop fighting this i'm going to get in the spirit it takes if patentness means my killing it takes a while to give up if i say look i'm going to stop fighting this thing have your way lord it takes a while so maybe he maybe he wasn't getting visions for two years i don't know this can take a while for us to finally die and say lord have your way but john's trial wasn't worthless he was boiled in oil had this terrible experience on patents we can see now it wasn't worthless we have a great book of the bible because of what he went through i'd say also neither are our trials worthless his words ours aren't either in first peter 1 6 peter says that we can rejoice in god's salvation though now for a season if need be we're in heaviness through manifold temptations so now for a season if need be we're in heaviness from through manifold temptation so if we're going through something somebody above our pay grade decided it was needed because we go through them only if need be god doesn't waste pain and suffering he's not a masochistic sadistic god he doesn't waste that if we're going through something we can lord give up and to have your way on my heart because god's doing it for for a reason and we can be assured that he will be speaking to us in these times because somebody opened up to matthew 10 27 i can remember when my um well my dad's mother um passed away um her name was uh kit i we called her mama um so if i say mama i'm talking about my grandmother but she she passed away and my dad asked me to um to minister at her her graveside service or her little funeral and sure i do that and before um before i i was able to find a old devotion book that she had it was my utmost for his highest and this is a book she had read this i i was looking at it that evening going through it and the very front page she had like 13 different colored lines with years beside him each year that she would read the book she would use a different colored marker to make her her comments and her underlines and as she was going through it she would make a make a 1981 october 20th rap was born or these different important dates or there's different you can go through there and see the different difficulties that she went through she had the she had a son who passed away at age 16 do a drowning accident notes those kind and that kind of then there was a divorce that that she went through and then she talks about how um um she she she got saved how she got baptized all those things are in there i'm just kind of going through this and seeing wow she had a walk with the lord and i knew that but you see how it's chronicled this is a it's a precious book well one of the one of the devotions that was in there was oswald chambers was commenting on matthew 10 27. could someone read that for you gotta volunteer go for abby i wait for anybody to show anything yeah go for it matthew 10 27. thank you and oswald chambers just writes about this particular verse and i'd never seen it until i read it in my grandmother's devotional book but he says when you go through a dark time god is speaking to you he wants you to get so quiet so that you can what that which i speak in the ear if he's speaking in your ear he's speaking quietly he's sharing something special to you that which i speak in it tells you those things in darkness but that's just the first part of the verse the second part of the verse what you hear in the ear that preach you on the housetops so that time of darkness where you're just hearing it in the voice of god faintly but so preciously still that's going to end because there'll be a time when you come out of that darkness and you're going to be preaching that on the housetops that happened with with john he had very personal time with god during the isle of patentness but that time ended and there was a time when he went back tempest he was preaching from the housetops and we can go through night seasons ourselves but we're just long lords i want that soft quiet voice to speak into my ear it's that assurance that you're right there beside me you're with me and you'll go through that time and you'll finish that time and you'll be able to preach it from the housetops and share it boldly it'll be a bold testimony c.s lewis said god whispers to us and our pleasure speaks in our consciences but shouts in our pains it's his megaphone to rouse a deaf world when god wants to speak to us he wants to speak to us so badly he's willing to do anything to get us to hear his message to hear his voice he's even willing to put us into a little bit of pain maybe a lot do we go with the easy way or go the hard way he's going to put us through a lot so that because he values that relationship with us so much that he's willing to do that he wants us to get in his spirit so john turns around after he gets in the spirit and he sees this vision of seven golden candle sticks and brother branham shares on page 47 in the church age book here says we we have candlesticks in our king james bible but he says what he's he says actually they were lamp stands to represent the churches they could hardly be candles a candle burns but a while then is burned out and it dies there would be no more of it but lampstands possess a lasting quality not found in candles so it's it's a lamp stand that we're looking at and it's kind of interesting what why is this imagery used why is this symbolism used well when do we use a lamp stand when might we use a candle we don't use it they're there at noon in the bright daylight we'll use it at night and he said all the all these symbols that we're seeing in revelation chapter one he talks about stars candlesticks lamps what's it mean it means the dispensation that we're living in is a nighttime dispensation but that which we hear in darkness that which we hear in the night time we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna treasure it and we'll that night time will end we'll be able to shout it from the housetops but this is the dispensation we're living in it's a it's a it's a time of it's a time of night now when john talks about um these lamp stands and and brother brandon emphasizes it's not a candle because a candle is going to be exhausted very quickly but the lampstand has such an everlast is going to have an everlasting quality to it and to emphasize that brother graham branham goes to another place here in the old testament now where lamp stands are referred to again this emphasizes that this is a these lamp stands this light in this nighttime it's enduring if you've got just a little bit of light and the power has gone out or if you're if you're if you're if you're stranded somewhere and all you have is one little lamp you want to keep that lamp that fire lit as long as you can you don't want to lose it because you're desperate to preserve your fire well as a church going through this night cycle we can we don't have to worry about the fire going out because the source of fire it's being fed by the oil of the holy spirit and that never goes out we don't have to worry about that we can just rest and then zechariah chapter 4 zechariah sees a vision an angel shows him something and this angel asks him and verse 2 what do you see and zechariah said i have looked and behold a candlestick all of gold with a ball upon the top of it and his seven lamps thereon and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are up on the top there zachariah must have been a real detailed person because he describes this very good detail you could draw this based on this description and the two olive trees buy it one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side of the bowl so i answered and spoke to the angel who talked with me saying what are these my lord then the angel that talked to me answered and said unto me you don't know what these be and i said no lord then he answered and spake unto me this is the word of the lord unto zerubbabel saying not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts this is an illustration that we can't live by our own power we can't live by our own spirit brother branham talks about this on page 48 of the church age but quote on the bottom of page four it's commenting upon this vision that zachariah saw he says here is another lamp of pure gold it's burning brightly because it has plenty of oil which it's getting from the two olive trees which stand on either side the two trees represent the old and new testament so where are we anchored i mean this this this lamp is anchored right in the scriptures and of course the oil typifies the holy ghost who alone can give the light of god to the people the angel who spoke to zechariah was as much as saying this what you see means the church cannot accomplish anything by its own might or power but by the holy ghost this is what we have need of and we can look at we have we have full assurance that olive trees that's the source of the oil this lamp is connected directly to the olive trees it's impossible this lamp could ever run out of wood it's connected to the source wall itself these olive trees and you talk about the old new testaments we want to be grounded in both of them drawing the holy spirit from both of them because it's not by our might or by our power but only by our but only by his spirit so the source of our light and its oil is inexhaustible we don't have to worry about about that in jesus christ if we look we'll take a look now at um revelation 1 verse 12. i don't have this on the uh there on the slides we'll take a look at the rest of his that the rest of his vision revelation 1 12 and in the midst of the seven golden candle sticks so he sees this he turns he's in the spirit he turns he sees this these seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man close the garment down to the foot and gert about the paps with a golden girdle now the illustration that we have here on the screen this is the illustration of the candlesticks that was in the first that was in the edition of the church age book when it was printed i think in 1965 and the little bit maybe even an odd picture if you're not acquainted with it but each of those little circles above the candlesticks look at the varying degrees of light and darkness they match a set of um which year it was but there was a an eclipse i think when the pope went to jerusalem if i recall right this i wasn't prepared for this part and there was pictures six pictures taken that match um pictures that brother branham had drawn on the wall um there in jeffersonville when he preaches on on the church ages as brother branham draws this out behind him the spirit of the lord came down and drew those all those very same things with with a light and i i work for for a school supported by um the dow foundation sister gladys dao who helped start the foundation she was in those meetings i never met her but brother jeff told the story when he was uh when he was still pastoring about how he was talking to he says yes i was there and you can hear me scream and are there on the tape when that when that fire came down and started illustrating that so it happened what it is light's good darkness is bad so at the first church age ephesus there's a lot of light because the the apostles are just proclaiming everything and the devil's the antichrist spirits just starting to ride just a little bit of darkness there but as you see darkness increases with every age to the smyrna and age to the pergamian age the dark ages the thyatiran age it's really dark there's just a little bit of light to see by you've got sardis here you've got the where martin when the reformation began a little bit of light not much in the philadelphian age when you get all the missionary age do what john wesley george whitfield another you see a little more light coming up there but then finally with laodicea if you were to take a um i don't know if i can do this certainly if you take a timeline here yeah i can draw this or not yeah okay if you take a timeline there you see that timeline if we were to take a time onto to the side of it as you're going through time it's getting darker and darker and darker as you end that circle of laodicea as you walk along the bottom of that of that last circle of laodicea that that dark that that light tapers off then there's still a bit of that circle that's left with all darkness and that's the end of this church age there's not much light out there at all it's just darkness brother branham has these had these visions because after 1977 i'd look for i all i see is just total darkness the time that we live in it's nighttime total darkness but john is seeing this vision at the very at the very beginning of this whole drama of this whole plot line john's seeing this vision and he sees this candlestick and who is in the middle of it all jesus is there in the middle as all this darkness seems to be prevailing the dark forces seem to be winning jesus is there and john and jesus tells tells john i'm alpha omega the first and the last what you see right in the book sent to the seven churches that it gets published so all the churches from here on out will know when it's dark when it's bad i'm right there with you you're not alone jesus wanted all the believers throughout history throughout the future to know it'll get bad but i'm right there with you you're not alone he said john write this down and tell this because we're really important they're going to think they're by themselves but they're not i'm right there with them it was really important to him he does that in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks there was one like the son of man we see that kind of phrasing another time when the it was really bad time nebuchadnezzar's through the three hebrew children of the fiery furnace nebuchadnezzar opens up his icy one light gun to the son of man the same person was there with them brought them out of their fiery trial is with us who will bring us out of our very dark trial he's right there with us and how is he clothed he's clothed the garment down to the foot gertie about the pabst the golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool and all these characteristics are going to be telling us about christ we'll look through the brother branham talks about this as his sevenfold glory they revealed him as coming as a judge a victorious judge his hair is white as snow like like like the wig a british judge would wear his eyes were as a flame of fire and these are all metaphors i was looking for a really nice image online to put on here and i finally stopped trying i was finding uh finding images where fire was little flames of fire were coming out of his eyes is where his mouth is a two-edged sword there's a sword coming out of his mouth and you can't take this literally these are these these are metaphors his eyes are flaming with fire because he's angry about what what what the devil has done to his world he's gonna judge him his feet like undefined brass as if they burned in the furnace and brass that's a metal that's connected to judgment there in the bible and the book deuteronomy talks about when the skies are his brass when it's time of time of drought the sin was when when the children of israel were being plagued by um by poisonous serpents moses put this brazen serpent upon a stick of wood so people could look and live in a serpent it was made of breath he was already judged so they could look it's like we look on christ because he took our judgment for us sin is already judged they're on the cross brass is symbolizing judgment that's why in the tabernacle you don't see brass in the holy of holies brass is where sin is being judged it's in the outer court you're offering sin offerings upon a brass altar but after their sin has been judged you can go off for prayer things like that i'll have a golden altar because gold speaks of god his voice is as the sound of many wanters and many wanters to be talking about brother branham explains is uh more depth than i i will we talked about many many people and the voices of many waters these are voices of gospel ministers giving words of warning throughout the ages the seven stars are in his right hand and the seven stars this is going to be extra special attention is going to be brought to these seven stars at the end of this chapter but these seven stars are the messenger of the seven churches brother branham doesn't come up with that the bible says that that the seventh stars are the messengers of the seven churches and there's a two-edged sword coming out of his mouth that's a metaphor for the word of god that's how god fights his battles with his word and then his face is shining like the sun and brother branham refers to malachi chapter four when after the millennium the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in his wings it's going to make all things new and good again so this seventh this vision of christ sevenfold glory show him coming as a judge show him that he's gonna make all things new and all things right i just want to say that we we we can look at this patentless vision on on a church age level that god is with his bride with his church with this special group throughout the whole throughout all of time we can take on a personal level also he's with us all of our dark times and all of our trials and i like this little little picture we have our after we get saved we have our picture we have our image in our mind how the how our walk with god is going to be like there's heaven i just got to make my one little sprint to the finish line i'm there it'll be easy but god's got a different plan and that's kind of what it looks like for the church ages up and down all kinds of difficulties but we can be assured through the whole thing he's right there with us he'll never leave us he'll never forsake us he's right there he's in our boat he's not going to forsake us we can stick right with him he'll be walking i love that he's he's uh his plan is is perfect and when john sees him john i mean john gets in the spirit he turns around he sees this vision of the seven golden candlesticks he describes in multiple verses the glory of what of of what he's seeing of this one like the son of man of jesus christ and when he saw him i it's amazing and john sees him he immediately falls his feet as dead but in that one moment that he saw he saw so much he could describe so beautifully in those three or four verses but he just had a glimpse but he falls on his face as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying fear not and to make that's what whenever god comes to us every angel comes to us his first words are fear not fear not i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore they couldn't kill me they couldn't get me they can't get you either because you've got my spirit in there i'm the living proof john you have nothing to fear i am alive forevermore amen and i like that name of god he is the amen that's one of god's titles he is the amen and why is that important because god always has the last word in our trials he's the amen amen means last word he has the amen the devil does not ever have the last word over us ever he always tries to throw something in there to get us all messed up says no god's got the last word i'm going to wait for his last room not getting myself into this but the devil said because god's got the last word he's the god of the amen so we wait on his word and we hold on to it because he is the god of the amen he's the lord over all history the present the past the future and he's telling john he's telling him john make sure the churches know that difficult times are coming but they'll never be alone this emperor domitian who thinks he's god who can persecute you and they do whatever he thinks he's he's he's on a power trip he's not i am the amen i have the last word he says don't fear john this is brother brandon's paraphrase here don't fear john don't fear little flock all that i am you are heir to all my power is yours my omnipotence is yours as i stand in your midst i have not come to bring fear and failure when god brings a trial in their lives it's not a gotcha moment ah i knew you didn't know the right answer now you got to write sentences and stay after class that's not why god brings a trial to us god doesn't come to show us what we can't do god's not he does not come to bring fear and failure but love and courage and ability because in our trials we get drawn so close to him we know what's in him we know what's in us and we get drawn so much closer we have confidence because we've spent that personal special time with him i've not come to bring fear and failure but love and courage and ability all power is given unto me and it is yours to use you speak the word i'll perform it this is my covenant and it can never fail so he says write the things that you've seen the things which are the things that shall be you're after the mystery of the seven stars which you saw on my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks write all of this it's important the seven stars of the angels of the seven churches the seven candlesticks which you saw are the seven churches and i think the important question here for us on the personal level then is where do we have our wick that's the important question because it's a lamp stand that's connected to like in zechariah's visions these olive trees with an inexhaustible supply of the holy spirit inexhaustible if we want to burn brightly all we have to do is put our wick in god's oil and we will burn brightly we don't have to do anything except put our wick and that we have to do anything except just relax in god's spirit and he's going to make us burn brightly we'll be we'll have that i was going to try to do a little science demonstration here at the very end but it would take way too long to achieve the results i wanted to achieve so i just got pictures but there's a science administration that's often an elementary classroom some of you might have done it before with your children but you can take a piece of celery cut the bottoms of them off and put them into into different cups with colored water with with food coloring and you'll see if you look closely at the leaves of the cellar this takes a couple maybe a day or two to actually get this result and i didn't want service to go that long on the wednesday night but you can see that the leaves are of the cellar are starting to color why is that it's because if you look at the bottom of the cell to take it out the capillaries in the cellular drawing up that water this is how plants take the water out of the earth and get them into themselves this is what happens when we immerse ourselves whether it be in the holy spirit whether it be it's not some worldly thing it's good it's osmosis is a spiritual principle too whenever we put ourselves in we're going to absorb we're going to absorb what we're going to put our wick into and this is amazing if you peel back the celery you can peel it back and you see oh those capillaries draw that color all through the plant all the way through it works and if you were to do a spiritual um a spiritual dissection of of a believer just really in the spirit of god you'll be able to look and see ah all their spiritual blood vessels all all their spiritual veins and all just absorbing god's spirit you'd be able to see that just like you see it there in the plant what are we putting ourselves what kind of spirit are we exposing ourselves putting ourselves into because there's an amazing promise that's given here to the overcomer if you immerse yourselves in god's oil what riches of blessings i really love the uh the quote here that brother branham kind of closes with says how thrilling it is to think of those seven lamps drawing life and light from the resources of that main bull because they had their lit their wicks dipped therein each church age messenger is depicted here his life is on fire with the holy ghost his wick his life has been immersed in christ through that wick he's drawing the very life of christ and by it he gives out light to the church what a beautiful blessing but jesus tells his disciples and us in matthew chapter 10 that if you receive him sorry he says he that receiveth you receiveth me he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me he receives a prophet the name of a prophet receives a prophet's reward if this is the promise through the church age messenger we can do the same thing because we can receive him we get that reward as well he received the righteous man in the name of a righteous man receive a righteous man's reward so he says he goes on to say not only can we speak this way of the messengers but every true believer is dramatically depicted here these lamp stands are a beautiful portrayal of what it means to be in the spirit just that we're just we just let our wicked abs absorb that oil and as soon as the fire of god's spirit comes down it just burns brightly this is where the life with christ is about but isn't this isn't just for the messengers this is for every true believer they're all drawing from the same source they've all been dipped into the same bowl they're dead to themselves their lives are hid with christ in god they're sealed in by the holy ghost their lives cannot be tampered with what is security the devil cannot hack your life the devil cannot get in there he can't if you're sealed by the holy spirit brother branham says in the breach the only way he could get in is by is by getting the holy spirit too and brother ramsey and then he'd be your brother you're completely secure you can't be tampered with he's a bluff the visible life is burning and shining giving light and manifestation of the holy ghost the inner invisible life is hidden in god and fed by the lord's word and it will never run out ever this is what it means the point for me the point of the patmos vision is this reassurance he'll never leave us or forsake us he never has the the church as a whole the bride as a whole can go through very difficult times but jesus is right there within the spirit of god's right through with him we can go through difficult times but we get in the spirit we turn around and say oh there he is i thought he i was looking at all the wrong things when we get in the wrong spirit we don't see him we have to get in the spirit and then we see and that peace comes back and that's i think the key question for me as we kind of close is just the question is where do we have our wick that's right john it took it might have taken him a while there on patmos to realize oh yeah i wanted i it took him all to get in the spirit but once he got there all he saw what god was his revelation outpoured like it never had before then um as we just closed missions can come brother brandon closes this this chapter saying this country talk about the seven stars that are in his right hand what a comforting place to be in there it's on page 59 he says when you think of that little group whose members were sawn asunder fed the lions persecuted and driven from pillar to post and yet stayed true to the word now definitely that would have to be god not by might by power but my spirit saith the lord how they survived their battle of faith and carried on still that is a miracle and this comfort is not for the seven church age messengers only this cumber you're going to make it that's not for the seven church age messengers only every true believer is in the hand of god and can draw from his love and power and receive the full benefit of all that god is to the believer what god gives the messenger how he blesses and uses the messenger is an example to all believers of his goodness and care to all members of his body what an assurance that is all we have to do have access to it is put our life in his hands put our wick there in his hands amen do the song he has all in control if we can just um pray and ask the lord to help us to get in the spirit more as well it can be so easy um to lose track of where we are just like our we can get busy on their little on our simula this life is a simulation is the example of a joystick and a flight simulator our our our life's a simulation the things we're doing here at work or walk with god that's the real thing on our simulation we can get out of the spirit we need to recalibrate it and then we can fly straight again amen let's pray heavenly father we thank you very much for your goodness and grace lord lord we think of all the troubles and trials that that john went through lord to in order to in order to be a vessel that you could bring this mighty revelation through lord father i just i thank you that you brought him through it because how else would we have had this revelation otherwise lord i pray for each one of us all of us are going through some kind of a trial it's just the nature of it lord if we're not we're getting ready to lord i pray that you would help us to get in the spirit and see your hand with us every single moment every single hour lord lord i just love you how caring you are lord lord we can look back in their lives and see moments where if it had been left up to us we would have given up how many times were we different places on the point of giving up but there was something that that held us and it wasn't us it was an anchor deep down in it was you lord and we thank you for that lord lord just pray that you bless each and every one of god in jesus name amen let's just try to sing this [Music]
