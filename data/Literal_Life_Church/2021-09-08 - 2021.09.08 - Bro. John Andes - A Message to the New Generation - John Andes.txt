========================================

the word joshua chapter 4. now let's not spend 45 minutes getting to know one another and you find out well we're all the same the end of the service we're just going to jump right in and you might not know me very well and i might not know you very well but the word is the same so just dig right in and we're going to speak from our hearts and to the generation that was born to the generation that came out of egypt and those that were born on the way and those that are born in the promised land it's september 2021 and so many years have gone by so it's like the holy spirit is going to speak to us that are alive and remain to just give you some encouragement joshua chapter 4 this is after they had crossed over and took the stones to be a memorial for the children of israel forever verse 19 joshua 4 19 and the people came up out of jordan on the tenth day of the first month this would have been april the first month was april to them and encamped in gilgal in the east border of jericho and those 12 stones which they took out of jordan did joshua pitch in gilgal and he spake this is joshua which is a type of the holy ghost spake unto the children of israel saying when your children shall ask their fathers in time to come saying what means these stones or what means stones are like revelations or the things that's been revealed what does all this mean then you shall let your children know saying israel came over this jordan on dry land that was a miracle verse 23 i want you to watch this verse for the lord your god dried up the waters of jordan from before you until ye were passed over as or the same as the lord your god did to the red sea which he dried up from before us until we were gone over did you catch that verse verse 23 is joshua standing in the promised land saying the same god that dried up the red sea for us 40 years ago has just done the same thing in this generation to show that i'm the god that was yesterday i'm the god today it wasn't a story about 40 years ago 50 years ago the holy spirit was making real saying the god of yesterday is the god of today and i'm letting the new generation know that what i did yesterday i'm here doing the same thing today so don't get your eyes on moses don't get your eyes on the 40 years of wondering and the division and the trouble and the message we have crossed jordan you're part of a new generation it's time to go into your inheritance that's what joshua was doing get your eyes off the past 40 years and get your eyes now on what god has for you now verse 24 then all the people of the earth that all the people of the earth might know the hand of the lord that it is mighty that ye might fear the lord your god forever god bless you you can have your seats and to you that love this message tonight's service will be mean something to you we'd just like the holy spirit to take the microphone and speak to us that are alive and remaining that have given our hearts to the lord a message to the new generation sister loretta you'll appreciate the service tonight it was god in the old testament that made the distinction and the separation and the difference in the age groups in exodus and leviticus and in numbers it was god that said everyone that passeth among them that are numbered from 20 years old and above shall give an offering unto the lord it was god that made that age a distinction and you say well why 20 years old why was that a certain age it's because that was an age 20 years old was when an age was considered an adult a person was accountable they were old enough to start making mature decisions that would bring the blessing of god or the curse of god upon their lives it was an age when choices and decisions and awareness of god's plan should have a hold on a person's life it was that age of 20 that uh because there were different ages for vows for offerings or for having a knowledge if you look at leviticus can you bring up these scriptures this quick leviticus 27 verse 3 it was in leviticus 27 verse 3 that there was to be an estimation of the male from 20 years old even unto 60 years old even my estimation shall be 50 shekels of silver after the shekel of the sanctuary verse 4 and if it were a female then thy estimation shall be 30 shekels and if it were to be 5 years old even until 20 years old or adolescent or a teenager then thy estimation shall be of the male 20 shackles and of the female tin shekels if you look at that verse you'll see that god requires more of a brother or of a young person of a man than than the young ladies numbers chapter one verse three i'm just making this as a foundation numbers one verse three to show you that it was god that made this separation tonight when i speak about the new generation i'm not speaking about we're in the new testament that it's so much age you have the young people we have the middle age the old people no you are part of the new generation to believe the message of the hour and to believe that you're those that are going in the rapture are we all together tonight so brother john's not just preaching to young people or to children i'm speaking to even remember joshua and caleb were part of the new generation even though joshua and caleb were older they were 80 and 85 years old when when caleb said give me my land they were part of the new generation though they were older is everybody clear on that so no attitudes and nobody thinking brother john's making different groups in the message it was god though that said it was 20 years old in the old testament numbers 1 verse 3 from 20 years old and upward all that are able to go forth to war in israel thou and aaron shall number them by their armies numbers 14 verse 29 this is very strong your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness and all that were numbered of you according to your whole number from 20 years old and upward which have murmured against me god was saying if you're that old you should have caught a revelation of the message so all those that were 20 years old and upward they died in the wilderness i want you to listen real closely those they died in the wilderness in that 40 years because they committed idolatry and they would not go into the full promise of what a prophet moses had said the inheritance is is the promised land it's not the wilderness it's not fighting it's not bickering it's not making certain camps and the message it's not taking the doctrine and making it all twisted that's not our inheritance our heritage is your life in the holy ghost and that's what they should have went across to right away in the 60s but we're finding out there's been years now of churches churches and now a lot of things that we've gone in so now if you turn to deuteronomy chapter 2 verse 1. this is again the old testament exodus leviticus numbers now this is deuteronomy chapter 2 verse 1 then we turned and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the red sea as the lord spake unto me and we compassed mount seer many days and the lord spake unto me saying you have come past this mountain long enough turn you northward in other words we've had enough of all this wandering around and wondering about this and wondering about that and god it was god that said you have come past this mountain long enough it's time to turn northward and i believe for the new generation that's alive now we've had enough of politics we've had enough of church fighting we've had enough of division and people wanting to go back to egypt and people saying who's the greatest one among us i believe there's a new generation brother brandon that loves this message love this word and they're part of a real word revival i would say tonight we've compassed this long enough it's time to turn northward so god was speaking to moses concerning the new generation numbers chapter 3 verse 28 this is where we'd like to come tonight so now numbers sorry deuteronomy chapter 3 verse 28 charge joshua and encourage him and strengthen him for he shall go over before this people and he shall cause them to inherit the land which ye shall see this is moses coming to the end of his life and he couldn't cross over into the new land so he's actually god's going to commission joshua which is a type of the holy ghost and now you lead the people on into their land but watch these three words charge joshua that means command him give him orders lay out the charge appoint him commission him and ordain him to be the leader not the pastor not the pope not the preacher it was the holy ghost joshua's a type of the holy ghost and encourage him this is now the spirit coming from brother branham always if you'll notice how he treated young men young ladies in the new generation he was encouraging him that means to strengthen him to be strong and to grow strong and to be courageous cause them to be firm cause you to be resolute press them into urgency this is an urgent message teach them to grow uh to sustain and to make bold and to keep the support of what's been spoken all these years repair the land it means to have it to take it keep a hold of it not a new message not just a new message but now it was the same message of coming out he was just encouraging him take the people in too so we find out we are in another season in the message we are in another time we are not back in the 40s or 50s or 60s when it was young and it was fresh and people were coming to the lord from the denominations and i know that's happening in many places overseas and places even brother brandon reminded me brother jason demars is going into egypt i think in the in the next few hours or he's just asking for prayer brother paul that we remember him these are new lands this uganda with many baptisms and this message is going in and fresh vision books and as they're sending books and uh bibles into this it's the same experience that the older generation had by coming out god is inspiring us now to go into our land and retain it encourage joshua give him support give him strength charge joshua if we could bring that word up deuteronomy 3 28 charge joshua encourage him and strengthen him how many would like some strength tonight about half of you amen we need strength tonight all of us strengthen joshua cause him to be alert it's not the time to slumber and sleep no more wake up the people wake up the leaders wake up the singers wait wake up the young wake up the middle age arise arise brother c arise come to your place this isn't the time to be sleeping and slundering and wondering and just looking around the room it's time to be focused god's called you you're a believer it's time to rise strengthen joshua means to cause him to be assured and be determined and to confirm be persistent in this exhibit this strength deuteronomy chapter 4 verse 1. this is all foundation chapter 4 verse 1 the brothers are helping us therefore hearken o israel under the statutes and under the judgments which i teach you for to do them that you may live and go in and possess the land which the lord god of your fathers hath given you now if we go back to the scripture in deuteronomy chapter 2 verse 3 when they had come through now you will remember they came out of egypt with a mighty hand and the token message was given brother branham said we've not come together to talk about the message talk about the token we've come to apply the token so this message is not a hear only message it ought to be an action where we hear the word we become the word and the holy spirit's right there to make it alive not tomorrow not we don't have another month in another year this is the time when you hear the word you become the word and you arise it's a resurrection it's a rapture that's what the message was years ago and that's what it is tonight i know it's wednesday night but this message always comes with life with power with healing with deliverance that's malachi 4. that's the duty of our prophet was to turn the hearts so if it did it back then it'll do it today not turn our minds turn our emotion it'll turn our hearts then if god's got your heart then he's got your emotion and he's got your money and he's got your future and he's got your job hallelujah lord phyllis with vigor tonight as we're hearing this message to the new generation our children our young people you that are middle-aged or older they they came 40 years they wondered in a desert time that was not their promised land it was 40 years of just wondering just wondering and remember those that were 20 years old and they came out they would have been 60 years old they all died in the wilderness that's what the bible says but there was children raised up or five-year-olds that came out of egypt that would have been 45 when they came into their new land there were 10 year olds just in sunday school that when they came into the new land they would have been 50 years old so that's why the new generation isn't always old people it's it's people that were either born along the road or people that were born younger than 20 years old in egypt are we all together this is now the charge to the new generation moses my servant is dead that's joshua 1. but now god was calling the people it's time to go in the 40 years are over and finally god says in numbers chapter 2 verse 3 we can put that up on the screen you have come past this mountain long enough deuteronomy two verse three i'm sorry brothers i'm glad it's a team effort amen deuteronomy two verse three you have come past this mountain long enough let's turn northward or let's inherit what we've been hearing about for years and brother branham picked this up in shreveport and he said there came a time when god said you've been on this mountain long enough come we're going over and he was talking about returning jubilee and about an experience again with god and the holy spirit that it would speak to the people of this generation their sons as they did back there when the old fighters have died out i want you to keep that phrase old fighters if you want to write it down or put it in your notes or if you want to search brother branham spoke about the old fighters now he's speaking to the new generation and he was saying that the holy spirit would speak to the people of this generation their sons as they did back there when the old fighters have died out and when they fought and when they fought they said you're going to do this or i'll do this and if you do baptize this way i'll have nothing to do with you and we'll have that and the other and he said now the old fighters are dead it's time to rise and be sons of god in the name of jesus christ and rise to a place so you can return in this jubilee and hear the sound of the trumpet of the gospel of the word of god you are brethren you are not denominated he said if the slaves want to stay in the walled cities let them stay but we're free you're free so if you want to stay on the borderline and be a borderline believer you we're going we're going in the rapture where the messi's prophesied us into existence first thessalonians said there would be those alive and remain unto the coming of the lord that would not hinder those which are asleep but they that have been sleeping will rise one day oh brother royale soriano was in this building if brother lafontaine was in this building and brother branham was in this building hearing this kind of preaching they'd be the loudest people here because they've crossed over they know that it's real and to be sitting in a congregation of people where they preached and they labored and for many years of their life this is the crowning generation of the message [Applause] in the 70 weeks of daniel gabriel's instructions brother branham said there was a generation that raised up 40 years old fighters they were called and they organized and they beat and they fussed all down through mount horeb and nebo all through there but finally we're at the river now he's going to raise up a new one with a joshua to take them over the law had failed and moses went with it moses failed and joshua took them over and he talked about organizations and how they failed but the spirit of god that joshua means jesus our savior that the holy spirit will come into the church not an organization but the holy spirit will get amongst the people and make her ready to go up and cross jordan he said i understand by the reading of the book that that's what's to take place and god knows what i've been seeking this is brother branham i know he said i understand by the reading of the book that is to take place and god knows that's what i'm seeking that i might comfort his people and tell them what's at hand both here this morning out throughout the lands and these tapes go worldwide that we're at the end time so this is not for one local church this is not just for one estate i love you literal life church and believers of you know uh this assembly but it's not just your church or this state it's a global revival no matter what's happening in your local area there's a global revival brother branham said in presuming in cleveland i pastored near here for almost three years he said what i'm going to say now it might scorch you but listen that's exactly what pentecost has done she organized and never did get to the full promise she come out of egypt god took care of her showed her wonder signs and miracles but never to the fullness and the old fighters they died that's where he said we've got again we're wondering how long 40 years then he starts to convey the attitude of the old fighters bless god i'm oneness hallelujah bless god i'm assembly glory to god i'm church of god we're this kind we're that kind and brother branham said you're nothing now i'm just going to be very honest tonight i'm open tonight brother paul if that's okay over the last years in the message we've had this doctrine we've had that church we've had this ministry these kingdom builders we've had that doctrine the new generation isn't interested in being led by a strong man that can just move them they are being led by the holy ghost that's why you find the new ones and those that are coming in this wave of the holy spirit i know i've experienced it now as in our ministry in these last this year especially brother uh precious brother kenny as you've seen it now where god is just moving globally and he's striking congregations and young men and young ladies and our children and i say god let it happen more what the older ones experienced now i'm going back to our opening scripture what happened in the red sea when god opened up the red sea how many knows that was a miracle i mean they're just mud daubers and slaves and god led them across they turned around and they saw the whole the whole armory and the whole egyptians just swallowed up that was a miracle and they praised god my they got the tambourine and they were shouting and singing songs for a long time you know and the tokens been applied in the original life and amazing grace but we saw what happened in the 40 years as revival began to die and people begin to die pastors begin to die song leaders begin to die trustees and the older ones begin to die off there had to be another generation come up so in our opening scripture in joshua chapter 4 verse 23 joshua 4 23 god was now going to show them for the lord your god dried up the waters of jordan from before you this is now we've crossed jordan this is the new generation it's not stories of what used to be that's going to give a revival for the new generation god isn't going to have stories and so and so said and so and so said and did you hear this about what happened and brother branham said this and over there and the stories of squirrels and the stories of what he did here and that i'm not speaking to diminish that but i'm saying god was saying i've just brought cross allowed you to crush jordan so that the new generation can see i'm the same god it's not a powerpoint it's not let's have a video of deep color to the deep or 20th century prophet but it's i'm gonna come myself and show the new generation i'm the same [Applause] i hope no one's misunderstanding and i know we have a global audience tonight but i i i'm just speaking with the lord laid on our heart and i believe this scripture is being fulfilled in the ranks of the message god is opening the jordan river he's doing this globally he's doing miracles in our families it's the same god of elijah it's in this building tonight the same lord jesus that led william branham is in this building same pillar of fire same angels of the lord that line these walls he's trying to get our faith he's trying to get our attention not on the man not on the preacher no no no you know this is our church and now we're going to have a global ministry no it's the message of the hour is the ministry and i'll say this any faithful minister is preaching what i'm preaching tonight it's not stories and it's not the way it used to be and it's not holding over the present generation a bunch of laws and rules and you've got to tell them lie that's not the spirit of christ it is having the message come alive and it's personal and it's real then it doesn't matter my mommy don't go my daddy don't go my husband don't go my wife don't go my friend don't go i've got to go i pray god open your jordan river tonight do a miracle in your life show you personally there's so many that's fallen away and we have so many that are looking for reasons where brother branham was a false prophet and they're trying to find a hole or for a crack or friends i was born and raised in jeffersonville i know about the bridge i've been to arizona and you talk about the you know all the things that people talk about and they try to discount and this that and the other friends we're standing here tonight as a testimony i'm giving you a message to the new generation watch this if we can put that up again deuteronomy the lord your god dried up the waters of jordan from before you until you were passed over as the lord your god watch these words as the lord your god did to the red sea so it wasn't moses that parted the waters come on it wasn't moses that's why moses my servant is dead and god allowed a whole generation to go across jordan river get your eyes off the man and get it back on christ that's why are we getting people to christ are we getting them to a real personal relationship are we are we getting them like jonah to have a revelation that we need to be changed [Applause] as the lord your god did to the red sea which he dried up from before us until we were gone over god was saying to joshua let them know i did all this and i'm the same yesterday today and forever if they can just put their trust in god oh we want to see moses and stand out there with your rod and we want to know brother branham's address and we'll go and we want to be counseled oh just give me a few minutes of counsel from a man of god i'll go to jeffersonville i'll crawl to jeffersonville i'll do it and god took that man away to get the eyes of the people on christ the very answer to the question when he passed away on december 24 1965 what are we going to do where do we go from here god is now answering now all the time it wasn't about the man it was about christ never was it about jeffersonville that's not the headquarters but we find a whole generation of old fighters old fighters that's a brother branham used that phrase he said it's the biggest job for the church and the individual today is to empty yourself and turning northward if you'd like to write that down in 1961 in phoenix brother venom said they made a fatal mistake he's talking about the message and they raised up a bunch of fighters he said and that's what we have a big bunch of fighters bless god i'm assemblies i'm oneness you don't have anything to do with it you old church of god we got it and and bless god and we're the ones that got it we got prophesied this and the one that says well we got it right because we baptized this and he said you bunch of fighters god just let you set right there till you died and the bible said i'm quoting they stayed right there till all the old fighters died i'm not speaking about people tonight i'm not speaking about a generation in the message that died i'm speaking spiritually that spirit god has allowed to die amongst us you can't control people to love the lord you cannot abuse them into perfect love it's not going to be a strong dominating pastor that knows and can tell you this and that and you just come and are just swooned by his oh he can just take authority and say and lead us while we just are just going to sit here and marvel you know no god's taking those off the scene and if they haven't passed away they're getting older to get your eyes off the flesh get it back on christ you say well a man has hurt me or a man hurt me or that church hurt me they will but god has never hurt you god has never broke you that way [Music] they made a fatal mistake by raising up fighters and god had them die out he said he just let him stay there till the old fighters died out then fighters fighting over their organizational boundaries and say don't you have no fellowship with that group and that buzzard roost and this is so and so haven't we heard that in the message don't go over to this church and don't go over to that church and that pastor's this and that church group is nothing it was a bunch of fighters brother branham said this he said as long as you got that in your head you'll just sit right there on the mountain and starve to death and they have died and messaged pews they have starved to death they're dry they're miserable there's no life there's no desire their young people want to go to the world as soon as they can get out of the home because they've seen a bunch of hypocrisy and people can dress all nice and come to church and act apart and be good old rich young rulers hear a nice sermon maybe run the aisles and scream and go right out and wear their makeup and cut their hair and play rock and roll and then people just scratch their head you know this is supposed to be revival people are supposed to have revival and they go out and live another life you know who picks up on that you're young people i say god give us the life of this message you parted the red sea 40 years ago part this river jordan now brother branham called them old fighters they were just a few days away when they crossed the red sea they should have went right into the land how many have heard brother branham say this they were just days away they brother henry they could have just walked right in in the 60s and walked right into the promised land and they should have been there for all these years but as it was in the old testament it's the same today they fought they this camp and that cramp and our group and our preacher some of you don't know what i'm talking about and i think that's good god bless you because there's been a lot of tragedies and people go by the wayside they're a product of carnality and now there's a generation that's thirsty and hungry just give me life i don't want to care about the politics or what happened this and the failures of that they know we're all failures it's only the grace of god rise up tonight if you're a brother or sister if god forgave you you should be able to forgive somebody else i mentioned this over the weekend in north carolina years ago sister tina we used to hear all the time having meetings and having services all the young people and our children is the church of tomorrow how many has ever heard that well the young people and the children they're the church of tomorrow well let me just announce to you tomorrow has arrived and some people don't like it we don't need those young preachers and those young people and what's all the exciting what's all this no tomorrow has arrived i'm not preaching to the church of tomorrow i'm preaching to the church of today young middle aged and older they're going in the rapture we might not have it tomorrow we might not have another year is that true brother ken we need the holy spirit that was in the branham tabernacle years ago to be just as strong just a powerful you sister there with this back trouble you there with this female trouble that cancer over here and god delivered them god allowed their red sea to be parted and they shouted hallelujah and they they left their wheelchairs they left their stretchers they left they didn't care about the crutches let somebody else use my crutches stop describing your crutches in your wheelchair arise get up out of that trouble it's time to arise you say if the god of elijah was real then he's alive tonight where is the god of elijah don't criticize gideon for saying if god be with us where are all the miracles that's not that's not a bad attitude that is what many young people and even people in the message need to pray tonight lord if that is your prophet prove it in my life if a man can talk to you into the message another man can talk you out so it's not men leading the bride it's the holy spirit in men and in women they sing they are sunday school teachers they're preachers they're housewives they're they go to college the holy ghost goes to college the holy ghost just started school the holy ghost is just starting a new job it's like where's the future sister debbie sang about tomorrow i don't know about tomorrow but you take the hand of god tonight he'll be there tomorrow covet didn't take one believer god took his son and daughter home they're just sleeping they're just waiting for us so brother branham talked about these old fighters he said they disbelieved these two men talking about caleb and joshua when they went over into the land and brought back the promise and all these grapes and things there were 12 spies 10 of those brothers those princes those preachers had a report that wasn't the same as joshua and caleb and two of the brothers are saying we are more than able they saw them they saw the message and they were always encouraging i'm encouraging you i'm strengthening you you can do this and here's ten over here and they're preaching this and how big the walls are and the great your grasshopper i don't know your young people's gonna make it and you know you just follow me come to our church come to our camp where they went to your church in your camp and it's just bunch of dead and tragedy i'm not talking about this church i'm talking about the attitude of old fighters god said i'm going to let that whole generation die out till i can get some people that are fresh and new when they receive the word they believe it it can be happening amongst them but they disbelieve joshua and caleb they had to quiet in the crowd there was a new generation that rose up that said we're going to let the holy ghost lead us some of them said let the holy spirit lead and brother bradham said some new issues and the different kinds coming in he's talking about issues and things in the message brother bam said just let him go ahead and things don't fight with he said as long as the devil's got you fighting one another he won't have to fight at all is everybody listening tonight as long as the devil's got you fighting one another he don't have to fight at all he will sit back and have a picnic watching you fight one another and laugh at you professing to have the holy ghost and fighting one another i think friends if that's even you've entertained that spirit you need to say god forgive me fighting someone that was an attitude of the old fighters brother branham said i believe this day is the same i believe that these men here that you see now these younger fellas are what these groups it's the group of sons of the old fighters let me say that again he's talking about a new crop a new one's coming up brother gideon he said i believe that these men here that you see now these younger fellas are what these groups are it's the group of sons of the old fighters he said these but these fellas are not fighters the new group wasn't fighters he let all the old fighters die off when the old fighters died off he took their sons and raised up among them joshua and sent them over to the full promise now who wants the full promise tonight i mean wow there's more of you participating amen it's like brother john we have heard the message we we've all these years but we want to see christ among us see what's been happening all these years brother eli what's been happening all these years that's god has allowed years to go by and that old spirit of fighting to die out and there are now sons and daughters of this message that god is raising up that want to go into the full promise brother brown said i believe that's what we're seeing today brother paul i'm standing here in september 21 2021 saying that's what i've been seeing especially this year i've been seeing it's like an awakening like a refreshing something is moving out into our families it's a hunger it's a thirst it's laying aside every weight and lord forgive me if i've compromised forgive me if i've got my eyes off the wrong thing get my eyes back on you [Applause] he said let's move upward let's move out there ministers my ministering brother's out there don't you think we've been on this mountain long enough you know what some of them would do if they're sitting on the platform well brothers what do you think we've been on this mountain long enough they have had their whole ministries to just go around and around so they'd have probably sat there like this and said no it's we're doing fine money's good finances is good that's what a lot we're saying a little over a year ago we're coming into january in february 2020 and coasting along and god says you know what i'm going to allow a global pandemic to hit this earth to shake up my bride it's not fear it's not torment and for the last 17 months it's been numbers and masks and vaccines and deaths and that's the world that's their global message that's what the world wide web has caught people to a huge distraction can this church say man you're out on the internet you know what i'm talking about it's become a media obsession it's become just global it's on the news it's it's this and then another wave i just read to the other day they caught the fourth wave of this virus globally taking lives people are just frustrated they're tired of it don't let that happen to you where you get lulled to sleep and compromise and allow the sword to drop down there ever ought to be a revival in our heart saying come lord jesus come catch us out of here [Applause] this isn't the time to backslid this isn't the time to divorce or separate or you know start striking out at one another another wave they say another wave we've heard about it another wave of the virus another wave of cases more restrictions more lockdown social distancing i've already said it mass vaccines death and sickness it's become like another wave like the waves on an ocean like the waves on a sea side it's like on the waves of a lake it's just a wave and now here's another wave and people can get frustrated that's in the negative that's what they talked about in egypt oh the plagues all this through the wilderness all the sand oh it's so hot yeah we're not of that generation we're of a new generation that says give me my land of the holy ghost i've got to have my life in the holy ghost where's my joy where's my peace another wave that's in the negative well what about on the positive brother ken and sister anita where where are the believers of the message that will say give me my mountain another wave means it's happened before well what that's on the negative what about the positive what about a wave of the holy ghost what about another surge of the holy ghost when the holy ghost moves when the power of god is released it released on moms and dads years ago and it's released upon children now you've grown up and those children brother kenny you've played for many camps and services now they're having children now the children of those that were older are now raising children hello i mean my father and mother that came to the message in the 60s said they would never have children then sister debbie came then six children came oh they'll never go to school they came to school oh they'll never get married they all get married oh we'll never have grandchildren oh there's many grandchildren right sister loretta and then you have great great grandchildren and it's like well it's time has gone on so what god did for you years ago he's bringing back now for your children and your children's children if you read the book of joel it was like that your children and the next generation they would have a revival where is that hunger today where is the thirst in fact today we become master criticizers of of sweeps and moves of god and waves of the holy ghost i'll say lord give us the genuine i told someone the other day i said i don't know about this or that but we want the genuine we want it in our wives our sons our daughters our children we want to see that in literal life church we talk about a wave and a surge what's wrong with seeing a surge of healings take place seeing miracles happen seeing evil spirits and demons cast out waves it comes in with a gideon then it goes out and it comes in then it goes out you expect it to come again it's amazing how dry people can become and how they can get so in a form of godliness they don't want another wave it's like we got our little church we got our little family we got our little this and god sends another wave and they're like oh no no it's the same thing god gave you for your children you ought to be saying bring it on lord we want to see more give us a double portion well i think there's been people that has there may be in the flesh or in the i'm not talking about those that were in emotion there's got to be a real somewhere a surge that is a sudden powerful forward and upward movement especially by a supernatural force it's like it's like a wave and then you have a second wave and a third wave i just want to stand here as a message to the new generation saying we are experiencing that in the message of a global surge it's a worldwide wave in the message where god is sending his quickening power back on display in the bride body and he doesn't need a passport or a visa to come into your country in case anybody's streaming and want to fall off your chair there's not going to be any mask in heaven they're not gonna ask if you've been vaccinated or not vaccinated it's do you have the holy ghost do you have the blood tag where's your faith where's your energy what do you [Applause] believe stop criticizing people when they ask the same question if this god is true and if the message is true where is the life that ought to bring a conviction lord bring the life let it be so on display he said we're ready to go up and take the land we're ready to do it when you sons of the old fighters gets together he said oh you ministers here your brethren in phoenix break down your barriers repent and get a revival he said you want a revival the holy spirit falling back in the church being led by the holy ghost and willing to do it go up and possess your land now if i would ask the question who wants to be a borderline believer nobody would raise their hand is that true we don't want to live on the border line and you're right they're close you're like a razor's edge from the truth we don't want to be like that you say well what am i supposed to do with people that are borderline fuss adam sit him down and debate no here's counsel from brother branham he said pass right on them don't fuss with them if they don't want to come that's all right just go ahead how do you do brother and pass right on he's a borderline believer that's all he knows is stay on the border line he said that's the way a lot of people are today they all they know and they say i belong to this i belong to that so don't fuss stop debating the message we don't need another youtube channel and another 10 series on why the prophet friends god will confirm his word you don't need to answer all this and that you don't know things that happened years ago you just friends there's times when you just need to say if the holy ghost is in a person they'll hunger the thirst the deep calling to the deep it's not a shallow calling to a shallow it's a deep it's earnest where are the jacobs today that'll wrestle it all night no they want an answer instantly email you know give me an answer and they want it back you know you didn't answer me well wrestle all night and hear ye him brother brown are we doing okay but the branham said they made their rational mistake in exodus when they got away from the grace that god had provided for them a prophet a pillar of fire sacrifice signs wonders and grace and they wanted to do it themselves they wanted a law and that's where they died and they stayed right there till the old fighters died out and he said god come and took a new bunch and crossed over jordan with them how many want to be part of that group in california he said i think we should all be warned of things to come that's what the church needs today and they lack is the warning of making ready he said i believe really the church was in better condition 40 years ago for christ to come than it is today 40 years this is brother branham he said he was speaking the other day how the church is 40 years lost ground like it did in the wilderness but it's time now when the old fighters is dead and we ought to get ourselves together and get started on for the kingdom of god and go over and possess the full blessing and be not afraid in virginia he said that was only about four days away from the promised land they were only four four days away brother gideon and the same mistake that our pentecostals made not long ago they were 40 years from the promised land they had to go get go get something that they could argue about arguing fussing fighting and what did god do to them he left them in the wilderness for 40 years and what did they do now this is exactly what's happened in the message they raised crops and children and god blessed them and they was great this is brother brown i'm saying that's what they did 40 years you say oh i think it just went down brother brother branham said they raised crops children god blessed them and they was great but one day god said you've been on this mountain long enough let's rise go north and take the promise when all the old fighters died and that he waited till the old fighters died out in middletown ohio that's near middletown ohio he said watch just a minute they stayed there they married wives they raised children they had good crops they were blessed they had a great time he says it again they stayed there how long the bible says until all the old fighters was dead and he starts talking again about their attitude we're assemblies we're this we're oneness we're and he goes talking about that he said you old fighters out there oh he's talking about that you old fighters out there that wants to say hallelujah we have nothing to do with this new issue glory to god and he starts talking about this their prophecy and we'll have nothing to do he said they're dead that's not pulling any punch he said they're dead marked out with an x this is what he's saying he stayed there and let them die till they were all the way dead old fighters their attitude and it's my way or the highway we'll take your way i can see that it brings forth death and fighting and flesh i don't want that if that's what the message is i don't want it if that's what your revelation of the message brings forth is that kind of a spirit i don't want your message god give literal life church a real baptism of the holy ghost it'll drive back sin worldliness and maybe you're the one that's been hindering it brother branham said i think it was adoption he said you sin of you believers could cause this church to miserably fail getting in the spirit he said get to digging get out here and he said you've before your people once crossed through the desert they want to and he starts talking about this god gave him a prophet a pillar of fire and they wanted something they had to fuss about so let them stay out there in the wilderness till the old fighters died out now you that went after the seals i'm going to give you two quotes here before we close and the sixth seal he's talking about balaam and things and when they came up to a certain point that was one year before they went into the promised land is balaam watch right before the rapture that's a compromising spirit that we sense happening balaam's spirit when caused the children of god to air and they started marrying moabite women and into israel and caused adultery and he did the same thing in the same age on the journey on the road to the promised land that we are on that false prophet comes in and marries and calls the protestant church and caused denominations and little israel moved right on she railed in the wilderness for a long time and all them old fighters had to die off this is the sixth seal but she went right into the promised land watch them all in arm just before they cross jordan and we're getting down to that age right now here now here this is after the seals once more lord how many has heard that message once more lord it's a cry of a man that had been in the message and been a judge and been a leader and he killed more in his death than in his whole life it was like i believed this i might have failed in my flesh and that's the attitude moses had he's like i can't cross over because i struck it twice but there's another generation back here i look behind me and i see sisters and brothers and young people that they're thri they're they've got to go come back and encourage joshua strengthen him and that's where our song came you are the generation what is it it's the spirit of god that was in a prophet is now in our generation lifting up your hands lifting up your families in this message oh lord just once more he said this the old fighters when all of this great group of old fighters it was called like god let them stay there till every one of them died and he started with the new generation now there's a lot of people that don't like preaching like this and they're offended and they feel like you're having a bad attitude about the older ones and they feel like you're making a separation we wouldn't be here tonight if we didn't have the old fighters i'm just going to say it the way it is we wouldn't be here if we didn't have those old fighters they they had tenacity they they didn't care what people thought they had street meetings and they were like a farmer that would plow the field is that true they might have been a little hardened a certain way and maybe you'd say well they didn't go on to this and they didn't turn the corner but they had to be there to break up the ground to break up and cause seeds to be put down in and when it's all been said and done they believed the message it might have been slants and yes there's a lot of this and that but god's not gonna lose one of his children you just nail that down tonight well i've been wounded and i've been hurt we all have it's time to rise it's time to come out of that it's time to say but i'm not going to be a victim [Applause] yes there's broken homes and years ago brother paul was in conventions and everywhere all the baptists all the pentecostal all the catholics and we heard it preached for years and the harlot and pope and and all the divorce and now it's come right into the message and now it's right here among us and young people that are homosexuals and mothers that are sleeping around and dads that won't even work you know and they want to have a social security check instead of a job in 2021 they get more off of social security why should i go to work no you're lazy get out there and work god is gonna bless you because you're doing what you're supposed to do arise get up out of that doldrum you're not a gamer you're not a you know you know twenty hundred thousand i'm number one in the gaming and i'm a basketball stars and they wear their earrings and all their tattoos you've been called for more than that you don't have to be on social media till two in the morning it's not made for you the old fighters they had to be here but you're a new generation you need to say like joshua and caleb we are more than able to take it well brother john what about this and what about that we've seen all that too and the lafontaine family is rich with heritage and our family ourselves and the hatfield family i could go right down the line we're here as an encouragement to all of you that are living this message is true well what about this i'm not here to give an answer about that and this person and why that happened it's time to arise and go in and possess your land and if you're by the ocean then you're going to talk you know fish and boats and another brother's up on the mountain and he just sees things different and he wears a big coat and he has a big mustache and you say you are weird well he's looking down at you saying you're weird well stop saying you're weird and saying praise god he's by the ocean that's a farmer you know they talk corn and tractors and they're called to be a farmer there was 12 tribes we're not all supposed to be like you and the church isn't supposed to be like you and my family's different than your family stop letting making us all be like you i don't want to be like you well we want to be like you i'm trying to die to myself i've got three wonderful children and three wonderful grandchildren and more on the way am i supposed to say that serving the lord is great it's fantastic it's not boring if we can't beat disney and in many families they can't we don't have millions of dollars in in our budgets to excite our young people but we do have the holy spirit and what one you daddy and you mommy's got to win your children for christ help us close lord this is after the seals once more lord brother branham said the old fighters he let him stay there till they died and he started a new generation under the leadership of joshua who believed the word and he took them into the promised land oh god may this young generation get the vision and they went on into the promised land he said we ought to have where we have all gifts of god we have speaking in tongues and that's fine nothing against that he said but moses crossed the red sea the enemy was killed behind him we appreciate that but that's not all of it how little did your fathers and mothers think when they i'm quoting after the seals how little did your fathers and mothers think when they were standing out there my my my dancing in the spirit that their children would ever come to this but it did and there's a generation a new generation coming on now samson's hair has grown out a message to the new generation how many want to be faithful tonight faithful till the end about half of you the streaming audience you know all of us we want to be faithful friends we've got to make it in the rapture we we can't make it this far and then pull back god can do a miracle in your life in five minutes the burning bush did more for moses in five minutes and 40 years churches churches this that and god can do something for a little girl a little boy a mother a daddy a divorcee a song leader a preacher [Music] i trust there's enough power in this church that if there'd be a drunkard or somebody come in here or a prostitute that you'd have enough power the holy ghost they'd be converted and filled with the holy ghost the remedy tonight is christ and we've seen so much perversion all the years i'm going to close with a little thought here before our musicians come and i spoke on this just a little bit in north carolina some of you that are in business or would understand this phrase this is a message to the new generation this phrase they have it in the world they call them sleepers and it's in a business or it's in a church or it's in an organ it's in a certain group of people and they're they're people men and women that are in those groups and they're called sleepers and it's an individual that for a long time they're largely unseen they're not heard of and they just lay dormant how many has ever heard this phrase of a sleeper sleeper cells or this person you say my where they've where they been they just came alive or that that man or that sister like she's been here for years and all of a sudden bam it's like got something's alive they would call her a sleeper they would call that young girl a sleeper not that they're sleeping it's just they they were just laying dormant they were just like spiritually laying flat they were like laying down and all of a sudden they arose they begin to be awakened it's like a nudging the alarm clocks going off stop rolling over and hitting the snooze button it's time for you to arise you you sleeper cells you ministers you mothers you girls and boys and teenagers it's time for you to arise we're not going in on the coattails of another dominating strong pastor like we've had and i can mention names across this pulpit strong men strong gifts that were convention speakers and they were leaders and they had churches four five six hundred people and now they're going by the way of the grave or now dementia or alzheimer's or they're being taken and many times it's now more about health than the years of their strong and they're on fire and people would move across nations to go to their church and they had schools and they had camps and they had conventions and that was the glory years of the message does this seem like wow people flocked those years are gone i'm just here to tell you there will never be a rallying around this brother in that ministry are you this and now it's like do you stream that church or i've got to be under those days are gone those are old fighters where do you come to our camp do you listen to our tapes it's so powerful the man will die and that local church will play his tapes and play his videos there's no young men coming up there's no succession plan they have no vibrancy it's just a lot of old people uh you can be quiet all you want to but i've been to churches this is a lot of old people where's your young people they're backslidden they have no interest why go to that church it's all rebuke it's all never good enough it's a god give god restore unto us a freshness and a newness they shall mount up their wings with eagles god give us youth again back give us a smile on our face and again i'm not talking about old people and young people i'm talking about a spirit you get old cranky got to do it my way with the singer or the preacher i don't listen to that you know brother so and so he's only 20. her third brother gideon that's it for you know we ought to be encouraging we ought to be come on brother here's the baton run with it that's the way it ought to be brother paul here's the baton run with it not push them down i've been there done that bought the dick off the t-shirt forget about your t-shirt i'm being very respectful maybe not i don't know but brother branham called them old fighters brother branham said new generation and it's not a rebuke to someone that's older caleb was 85 years old or 80 and he said give me my mountain i'm more stronger today i'm well able he was older he's talking spiritually so these sleeper cells they're in our churches they've been in the message for years they're singers they're sisters that instead of you know number one instagram and facebook leaders they should be prayer warriors guys coming in half late to church you try to get a job you be you know it starts at eight o'clock they're there at 7 55 they're you know i'm gonna go to university you don't go walking in half hour late because your vision and your mind you're running after money you're running and the house of god becomes broken and the lamp goes out that happened under eli's ministry he got old and the light went out and god was leading now we could preach a whole weekend on this god was raising up a samuel right in the church he was a sleeper he was right in the church i've been around the message so long you know eli got so fat and big don't talk about my sons i know they're committing adultery with women in the church and i know that we got the offerings bless god hallelujah don't say nothing about my family and god smoted all dead and he said it's ichabod and he raised up a samuel that could bring back the fire and bring back the holiness and bring back the spirit of god where is the fire that should be on the altar that burns up the sins i want to close tonight saying to you on the internet or locally it's time for you that have been sleeping spiritually to arise stop the nonsense and the playing around and running through the streets of egypt the death angels in the land stop running through the streets and it could be the internet streets you know you there's no way you would let your children run down in the middle of cincinnati in the middle of the night something bad would happen brother john i'm a better f but you let them run down the streets of the internet in the middle of the night you're guilty and you've made idols in the message and no one wants to talk about it because you're the trustee you're a big tithe giver i say god start from the top and move right down through the bottom and let it go right back let there just be a flame of fire brother braddon preach blushing prophet and he says i want to have an altar call and he said i want to be the first one and he walked right around he was kneeling down and crying out to god now what would that do you if your pastor was the first one at the altar said i'm preaching this whole message and i'm crying and i'm confessing and i'm going to come down to this altar is there anybody that would like to join me i guarantee you most of you would be right behind him that was a prophet that was a man of god that would say i lied i have it done right and would you forgive me and that was a man of god that stood standing in the gap and said i wanted to go up here and i wanted to do it my way you know today we've got to be strong and we've got to present an aura we got it all together we got all we don't have it all together i think if more of our elders humbled themselves and gave testimonies like it hasn't always been like this we've struggled too we've gone through that our younger people would probably look wow incredible they're human you're not angels sitting there with your wings and in a few minutes brother kenny's going to come and the musician and we're going to stand up oh hallelujah and then you go out here and say things and do things that's the worst testimonial detriment to a church is to have people that are hypocrites all sleepers arise let our families arise is this okay tonight someone that's just dormant they're in the background they're unassuming but suddenly it's like a gear they move into action they haven't been in the forefront they don't seem to be outward you might say they don't have much to offer and then unexpectedly something sometimes even shockingly you'll say honey did you see so-and-so you know what they're going through and yet they were praising god and thanking god that sister's gone through hell in her life did you see her she's encouraging she's happy she's helping somebody else i just say god help us to have testimonies like that and unexpectedly sleepers it's time to rise up tonight i'm putting my notes away all the years that satan tried to choke you away i will restore saith the lord is that a promise in the word then you have a right to say lord restore unto me the joy of my salvation restore my health restore my mind restore my soul restore my energy lord get get with one another get in fellowship give testimony some of you older ones start giving testimony to your others that we're visiting and have them over you know we've become a distant generation the years sister loretta you know this we used to have people over all the time and you'd fellowship and play the guitar and sing and families would get around that's very unusual now people's busy this parking lot will probably be empty and a half hour after i we close people just rush home and go years ago and i'm not saying anything negative i'm just being real it was like 11 12 and we got to go to work at five in the morning but we love the presence of god my it's wednesday night and i'm not going to see it till sunday morning they used to cry and weep and not anymore there won't be no social distancing in heaven no mask in heaven do you have the vaccine do you not have a back pain just a few months ago there was all kinds of coughing going on in churches and people hacking up and you just church went right on now it's like [Music] deacon brothers you know i love you brother but just a few months it can become an attitude you're not distancing do you know the guidelines of ohio you're supposed to distance why aren't you distancing or i am distancing well your attitude is distancing i know it is but that's the law of the land well what's the law of the holy spirit we become calloused and cold now we're years later and everybody's cold and distant let's all go let's all go kid oh forgive me i don't even know where some of those things come from but maybe it's the lord just cleaning up saying if you want revival around here i'm not telling you to go against the guidelines now do i need to spend five minutes to clarify for someone i just say god burn burn holy spirit in me touch us lord there's no animosity there's no bad attitude it's not big eyes and little use if you've got a cough and you need to stay home you can stay home but if you come to church and you've got a cough and you ask brother paul to lay hands on you and anoint you with oil we're going to do that and the bible says you shall be healed [Applause] and it's in the book of acts maybe musicians can come that just the shadow of the believers walking by they were healed just my shadow just brother kenny's shadow just brother henry's shadow and i'm healed you come to church mentally depressed stressed and worried abused and you're just around that person you just heard that song sister cher he sings that song about brother kenny just playing that music and my heart was open i just prayed lord heal my broken heart in the pre-service just play something brother kenny brother ken this happened a few weeks ago when i was in the meetings there sister anita and i can't a brother came after any tears streaming down his face he said brother john before the service i came into the meeting of course we know him well and his family was broken a relationship broke and his parents left the message mother father left one another and he's just crushed he's broken he's married with children and for about 45 seconds brother john said if you have a broken heart god can heal that i just want you to know tonight if you've had a broken heart god can heal that just about 45 seconds he said something happened to him he'd just been praying be lord my heart's broken i feel crushed and he said brother john when you said that friends it doesn't take five years ten years just a moment and from that moment sister anita i've been more sensitive to the heart matters of the people in our services it's not loud music it's not loud preaching i'm not against none of that it's just the holy spirit coming and ministering you can say the holy spirit talk to that person i could tell that brother was affected by the word that's a sleeper that's somebody that's coming alive you say i have never seen my children be so attentive in a meeting that's the holy ghost the holy ghost is on that person that marriage needs that kind of preaching you don't know what that brother went through this week you don't know what that sister i said sister what she thought on tuesday afternoon but the holy spirit does and if we're not willing to leave our notes or speak with the lord laid in our hearts if we've got so much of a attitude that we oh i'm going to preach tonight some big i've never preached here before so i'm going to preach something that shows how great of a rev it's no wonder people have died in the wilderness it's no wonder people are proudful condescending is because their ministers have been like that no wonder people have majored on church order church order so long and it's no wonder they're dead and miserable i say god help all of us we're part of the new generation you are if you're alive you're part of the group that's gonna hear the resurrection has happened the saints are walking around are you ready to go are you ready to go we can have great meetings great camps great nice new churches now we used to be in storefronts we used to not we used to just kick off our shoes and be barefoot we used to our girls were homely young men didn't have college educations they were rugged they were now we're educated now we got nice churches now i'm preaching in the message of the hour we've got nice churches nice sound system we're on the internet and we can get so stuck it's just like the old fighters all over again and i say god take that out of my life take that attitude take that spirit if i have wronged you by getting in a rut take it out of our lives and lord fill oil put oil put wine give me a fresh revelation like give me a revelation like it was the first time i heard the message it's like wow did you see that sister respond did you see that brother he just had his hands raised he was that's the holy ghost in our church heavenly father as we stand to our feet tonight let the new generation arise let the sons and daughters arise let the holy ghost move in our homes our lives judgment must begin at the house of god we've been in your house tonight and it's a wednesday night and we're gonna drive home almost two hours for us almost six for brother chris cathy oh i pray god we would not get in a form of godliness and no power thereof don't let us be labeled an old fighter or a new fighter that just is carrying on that old tradition break that out of our lives break us out of a structure long enough that we get the holy ghost and miracles can happen and our children can love the lord and our teenagers can love the message and our wives can want to hear your prophet's voice and we're not struggling we're not trying to force it we're not oh jesus do miracles tonight when we get home let there be something different in our home put a song back in our heart tomorrow morning [Music] lord no matter what we go through just put a song on our hearts in the morning rather than picking up our cell phone as the first thing can't we just pray a little bit can't we just let a new song begin to come through our hearts lord we are human and forgive us for our humanness forgive us for our blatant heirs and our iniquity and if we have built up idols in our families forgive us lord we're not going to be proud and bold enough to say that there's no wrong in our midst but let it begin from the ministry and from the elders and from the leaders let there let there just be a trickle effect down where sleepers can arise men can arise brothers can take their position and we're encouraging them we're bless you young ladies bless you young men we encourage our children that was a wonderful special that was a wonderful to see you worshiping god i have no greater joy than to see our children walking in the truth i lift my hands lord with many in this congregation fill us freshly anew with a fiery baptism of the holy ghost let us be less critical let us be less looking around and saying lord start it in me lord anoint me fill me give me that portion lord what you did in the red sea do it in our jordan river do it in my family lord miracle's so great healing's so great we just want to see you back again amongst us i know you're here lord i know you're pressing i know you're you're aware that you're coming very very soon let us lay aside every weight take that old mentality away from us give us the newness of freshness humility love we're so busy about the other things and we forget the main thing bring virtues back let us sweep the house let's get our broom let's we're looking for that love we're looking for that peace we're looking for that brotherly kindness we're looking for that leadership we're looking for the mind of christ jesus i bless this church brother paul and sister rebecca lafontaine and see sister loretta here now the children and the grandchildren it brings great joy in our hearts that there will be a generation that does know their lord and the one scripture that we did not read in judges how there was a the generations begin to pass off and there rose up a generation that did not know the lord it was the succeeding generation after these brothers went off the scene oh god raise up the generation that knows you in your power stop the cycle of revival and death and move us lord into that channel now tonight and for the remainder of our lives until the rapture let us be red-hot on fire burning up for god i commit this service to you and the seeds that have been sown and the rain that has fallen down upon some thirsty soul feed us lord continue to work in our midst bless this church and all the churches some in this area could not have meetings tonight and tomorrow i pray jesus you would send comforting spirits and healing angels by their way that the presence of god would awaken them and arouse them and drive back this virus and drive back the complexities of all of the chemical issues and may the healing virtues be released [Music]
