========================================

Hello everyone. Pastor Paula Fontaine and Literal Life Church in Petersburg, Michigan would like to invite you to take the next half hour and enjoy some time in the word of God. If you're hungry for more God, we believe you can be fed. And we pray that you'll be blessed. Visit our website for more information at literalife.urch. May God bless you, my friend. May the music and message encourage you today. When we come together with our licks of fire, two or three gathered or more all in your name in one accord, you're gracious to meet us here, Lord. And then as I leave, I take you with me. I know what awaits past those doors and I'll not take your presence for granted anymore. It's not just about the feeling, but I love to feel you. So many souls are seeking. They land what matters most. Your mercy and grace has followed my days. I'm blessed just to be near you, Lord. And I'll not take your presence for granted anymore. [Music] Without a strong power to run to, to hide. In my own strength, I'd fall prey. To darkness and harm, fear over faith. But in you, I know I am safe. I can imagine. I don't want to know what a life without you would afford. And I'll not take your presence for granted anymore. It's not just about a feeling, but I love to feel you close. So many souls are seeking. They lack what matters most. Your mercy and grace has followed my days. I'm blessed just to be near you, Lord. And I'll not take your presence for granted anymore. [Music] On the wings of the morning, to the depths of the sea, wherever I go, you are with me. My rise to the heavens. Make my bed down in hell. Still you are there. Still with me. You dwell. It's not just about a feeling. Lord, I love to feel you close. So many souls are seeking. They l what matters most. Your mercy and grace has followed my days. I'm blessed just to be near you, Lord. And I'll not take your presence for granted. No, I'll not take your presence for granted. No, I'll not take your presence for granted. [Music] anymore. [Music] In thee, oh Lord, do I put my trust. Let me never be put to confusion. You know, when we're trusting the Lord completely, then we won't live in confusion. How many know the Bible says God is not the author of confusion? If you're confused, it comes from the enemy's side. It comes from the devil. God's not the author of confusion. And so when we put our trust in him, he said, "Let me never be put to confusion. Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape. Incline thine ear unto me, and save me. Be thou my strong habitation where to I may continually," Everybody say continually. &gt;&gt; Continually resort. We'll talk about that in a minute. But David said, "You're my habitation. You're that place that I want to go to. You're the place I want to default to. And I don't want to just go there every uh few months when I need it. I want to continually resort to this habitation. I want to continually to default into this secret place." That's the way we want to live. Continually, may I continually resort. Thou hast given commandment to save me, for thou art my rock and my fortress. Can you imagine? God has given a commandment to save you from whatever you need to be saved from. It's not you going saving yourself. It's not you running to something you don't get no help. He's already got a commandment. He's got a word over your life. He's got a covenant over your life. And God's covenants cannot be broken that he makes himself. You remember the covenant he made with Abraham? He says, "I will do this. I will do this. I will do this." First one he made with man. It was like a deal. If I do this, will you do this, Adam? If I do this, and man always fails. When he come to Abraham and says, "I'm going to bless you. I'm going to give you a land. I'm going to do this." And that's the covenant. It's not it's not contingent upon your mistakes. God will hold his covenant over you your whole life. And God will fulfill his covenant. God has a commandment over your life to save you. &gt;&gt; And if we have that assurance, then we ought to just rest in that rock and that fortress that he has given us. Can you say amen? We're going to pick up where we left off in talking a little bit about he shall hide me. He shall hide me. And this will be part three. And we want to talk a little bit about these different scriptures. And we David is the one in the Bible we said that wrote so much about this mystery of a hiding place in Christ. Even though he didn't fully have access to it in mystery, he began to write about it. He began to know about it. And and uh the reason that he wrote about it is some of the reason he wrote about it is God allowed experiences in David's life to teach him that there is really at the end of the day there's really only one place to run into where we are safe. And David was allowed to go through many experiences in his story that taught them. He he learned a lot, but he really learned and that's why David kept referring to a rock, a fortress, a hiding place, a secret place, a secret place of his tabernacle. That's just some of the terms he used. And he mentioned those terms more than anybody in the Bible because God allowed him to go through experiences that he learned. There is a place to go to. There is a place of safety. There is a place that is a default place that today especially friends we need to know that every time something comes up in life there's one place that we run to. It's not something of the world but we run it back into this place with Christ. &gt;&gt; And so but there was a lot of things that taught David that run to that place. But the fact is we learn too in our lives and we learn by seeing all the places that we run to. One of the things I'd like to us to learn and and to ponder in this is that we begin to see in our life especially as we go down the road the places that we develop that we run into uh that we escape into that we go into we run and we learn all those places fail us all those places are not assur asssuring all those places aren't the protection that God gives there's only one place that we can come and get true satisfaction &gt;&gt; and when we're running from something then we want to choose the place that that's really safe that's really protected there there are two things that I want to probe at this morning a little bit is that we all run from things we are all prone to run from things we all tend to in our human nature to run from stuff but then we all choose things to run to something that we run to so how many would all agree that's the way we are in our human nature when trouble come when People treat us wrong. We have a nature about us that we mostly will run. They have a thing called fight or flight. We either fight for ourselves or we'll run away. A lot of times we run away. We don't want the the the confrontation. We don't want to do that. But we run. We run in our nature and we all run to something that we think probably will be our escape. David says here in Psalm 71, "Lord, I want you to be my ultimate escape. I want you to become my escape. I want you to be the one that I run to." Is he the one you run to when you want to go hide? But we run from and we avoid a lot of things in life. And even Christians sometimes are running from something. They're avoiding talking about something. They're avoiding things. And they'll go for years running from something. him. And then we have to bring up the prophet Jonah. Here's Jonah. He was not a back he was not backslid as we would think he was, but he was running from the responsibility and the presence of the Lord. I want you to remember that he was running from the presence of the Lord. He received a commission, a calling. Go tell the Ninevites and get them to repent and preach the the message to them. But what was he running from? The presence of the Lord. When you run from the responsibility of what the word is being presented to you even today, then it's not you're running from Paul Fontaine. It's not that you're running from some religion, but you're running from the presence of the Lord because in the word is the presence of the Lord. And as Sher Song said, we never want to take it for granted. Can you say amen? We don't want to do that anymore because we could be a Jonah that's running from the presence of the Lord. In the presence of the Lord is where we need to be and where we need to live. And Jonah, you know, think about, you know, I try to be nice to him, but and I've said before that I need to apologize to him because some of the sermons I've been pretty critical. Jon Jonah only has four chapters on his life, but sure has provided a lot of sermons for me in that short four chapters. I'll tell you, there's a lot of sermons it's provided us. We are bent towards running from things. It's human nature. But then it it's it's you know if we're going to run sometimes it's it's what we run to that counts. It's what we run to. Sometimes we run into something else that's not Christ and then it turns out worse. How many has ever experienced that you run to something thinking that's the answer and you find out it everything turns out worse than what it was at the beginning because you ran to the wrong thing. Why does it turn out? We didn't run to Christ. But why did it turn out we ran to the wrong thing? We escape, but we escape into the wrong thing or things. If we run, we should run into something that God has provided. I trust you're listening to me this morning because we live in Leodysia. We live in the closing seconds of time. And I have never seen so many things offered to us, even believers, that are escapes, that are things to run into. There are things to relieve our nerves. There are things that we got because the trouble is too much. I know there's some out there they're turn they'll turn to drinking to relieve their nerves. They'll turn to smoking to relieve their nerves. Christians, they they don't want to do that. They want to put that aside. But even Christians that don't smoke or drink, you better be aware of all of Satan's devices that we're running to something where we should be running to that secret place. I could take another sermon on all the things that we run to. I can name them. All the things that we run to that are our satisfaction. And many times we run because we're having trouble. Someone doesn't like us. Something happened. Some people are still running from their past. They're still running from it. They're not facing it. They're not bring it to the Lord. They're not finding deliverance over it. They're still running from their past. We tend to run to the wrong thing. We escape, but we escape into the wrong thing or things. And if we run, then we should run into something God has provided a place of strength that the next time if we run into Christ's place of strength in that secret place that that habitation of a a rock in in a weary land, a place of strength that the next we should run into a place of strength from the Lord so that the next time we face things, we face it better. This is what David found. This is what he learned. People will treat you a certain way. You will have ups and downs in life. And when that happens, it creates emotional instability. You don't feel stable. You don't feel you feel the ground is shaking a little bit. You feel uh not not physically, but your emotions are are instable because we are emotional people. God knew that. God understood that we are an emotional people and so Satan abuses that to like life will happen. Satan will do things but even life itself and the way people treat you and the way things people say about you and the unrealistic expectations of people all can create emotional instability in our lives. And when we begin to run from that instability to something else instead of Christ, then we find we can find we we we can realize even more emotional instability and it doesn't get any better. But we should run into a quiet place with him because we know that that is going to bring stability emotionally. Couple years ago, I preached on where we find emotional stability. And I read the scriptures to show that there's a place. There's a place that I'm preaching that you can run to to stabilize things, &gt;&gt; to make things more consistent, to just to to to rest. The Christian life is based solidly upon rest. &gt;&gt; Rest in what God does. Rest in the word that he said from the beginning. He he said, brother uh Steven said it w uh Wednesday night is that even God rested from his own works. He spoke it once the word was spoken. He had such confidence in what was spoken. He rested the seventh day. All the works were finished before before the foundation of the world. But when he spoke it, it was really settled. He could rest completely in his own word. And now we can rest in God's word and find a place of rest when ships are tossed. When our life is tossed, when people have persecuted you and spoken wrong things against you, when you have done wrong things to other people, you can feel unsettled about it. But there's a place of repentance and there's a place of rest that brings emotional stability. Husbands can create stability in their family or they can create instability by their doubts, by their fears, by their inconsistency. You don't have the family in church once a month, whatever it is. And the whole family feels unstable because daddy is not creating stability. Our great daddy, our great Christ, our husband, when he went to Calvary, he created the greatest stability for the bride ever before. that we rest not in our own works, but we rest in a finished work of Calvary. He's already done it. It creates stability. Our groom, Jesus Christ, creates stability and peace, consistency. The Christian life is based upon rest in that secret place. The work's already done. &gt;&gt; And there isn't any turbulence in this life, no matter what happens. I've preached to people here for 36 years and I'd never seen such things hit their life that you go oh no you one thing you say they don't they didn't deserve that it seemed like somebody else deserve that some rotten person you know that that's lived here's a faithful Christian to the Lord and something strikes their life or those that family those kids life they never expected we're living in that power &gt;&gt; and that's why I create keep preaching. Are you listening? &gt;&gt; There's a place that you can run to. &gt;&gt; I can't change situations. &gt;&gt; I can't change what's happened to you, but I can point you to a secret place. &gt;&gt; I can point you to a place that has rapturing faith. This was amazing. Smith Smith Wigglesworth, a great preacher. He said, "It is in the secret place." Smith Wigglesworth said, "It is in the secret place where God begins to unfold his mysteries to your spirit. It is in the secret place where you get to discover." These are wonderful words. It is in the secret place where you get to discover who you are in Christ. People will wonder where you get your boldness, your understanding, your peace of your heart. The secret place is the place where you get to study the word, meditate on the word, pray it through into your spirit man, man. It is a place of honor. It is a place of glory. A place where things are created. Can you say amen? What a place. A place where things are created and called forth. Many of us today have forsaken the secret place and are busy chasing after the shadow, leaving the real substance behind. We need to get back to the secret place and build ourselves in the most holy faith through the word and prayers. Let Smith Wigglesworth correct us and set us on the right course. We get so busy, we'll choose something shallow or choose a shadow. Listen, you don't have to choose a shadow. You can choose the realities of God. With David, what he learned is he didn't, you know, David, he didn't run from the enemy. He didn't run from Goliath. He ran towards Goliath. So, we were talking about when David, it was uh what David was running from many times is not the enemy, but it was running in the first case with from a backsliden believer that turned against him. a man in authority, a man who was God's anointed, a man who was in the king of Israel. It was him who turned against David. There's not too many things that cut to the core of hurtful situation than someone within the body of Christ or some preacher that says the kind of words to be a Saul to you and to hurt you and actually to try to kill your influence as Saul tried to kill David. And all this time David's learning, I need a place to run to. I need to get away with it because I can't really come against God's anointed. And so he was in there playing music and anointed in music actually relieved Saul of his evil spirits that had got actually from the Lord because he had been rebellious. God sent he allowed evil spirits to come to him. Then they bring in David. He plays anointed music. It refreshes him. He gets re relieved temporarily. But in those moments, he comes around the corner throwing javelins. Throwing javelins at the new anointed, the the David. David didn't do anything wrong, but he's throwing javelins. And it's coming from somebody within the body of Christ. I'm calling it that to bring it up to date. It's coming from God's anointed king before. It's coming from a preacher. Do I have your ear this morning? These things are more trying sometimes than receiving persecution from the world. When I receive the criticism of lies that are told about me, it hurts more when it comes within our own ranks. It I'm just being honest with you. It hurts. And yet a Saul rises up and he rebelss against God, takes a wrong spirit. You know what he turns his javelin towards? He turns it to some somebody God is beginning to work with and anoint and be refreshed and kill the Goliaths. And Saul gets jealous of that. And instead of saying, "I submit. I'm going to come to your church and I'm going to say David is the God's man and I'm going to submit myself to it." He turns his javelin and starts throwing pot shots at David. That's what David dealt with. Could speak a lot more about it, but a man who wanted to kill him and kill his influence. It was an internal pressure that affected David most. Not the Goliaths of life. Listen now. God gives us strength many times to defeat the Goliath of life. You should never be afraid of a Goliath. Can you say amen? God has called you against the Goliath of life. I tell young people, listen now. David was on the back side of the desert and he was training when there was a bear, when there was a lion, and he took him. He was gaining testimonies cuz someday he didn't know he was going to meet a Goliath. God was teaching that man as he was young as he teaches young young people how to get a hold of God. How to get in the presence of God, how to get into my Bible. &gt;&gt; What are you doing young people? Are you in your phone all day? Get into their Bible. Get into the word of God. &gt;&gt; While you got time because if you get married, your time's cut in half. &gt;&gt; With each kid, the pie's cut even more. You don't have time hardly at all to have those moments to be alone with God. And when you were single, you got them all. Don't waste those moments with God. And David spent time with God. He learned about the anointing. He learned how to sing under the anointing. He learned how to drive away evil spirits. You don't think God's doing something in your life right now, young people, and the trials you're going through. He's training you. How do I get in the spirit? How do I learn how to defeat the enemy? How do I kill this lion? He's preparing you for the Goliaths that are coming in your life. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. He's preparing you for the Goliaths. And God gives the strength. But there's nothing ever more so confusing. Seems like not a Goliath, but fighting being falsely accused, fighting jealousy from others, cruelty from others, unfair conclusions about oursel. It was a a bitter, unsatisfied king. It's bitter, unsatisfied people that was the challenge. It's bitter people in their life. They've always been bitter and they haven't overcome it. It's those bitter people that'll take shots at you. And you know what it is? They want to make you bitter, too. &gt;&gt; And David said, "Lord, help me. Hide me. Let me run from this spirit because I may not be perfect, but I don't want to become a Saul. Can I get an amen this morning? &gt;&gt; God, help me in my character. I don't want to become a Saul. David had his mistakes. David was young. David wasn't perfect by any means, but he fought against becoming. He ran from I don't want to hang around that because I don't want to become a Saul. In the message, we have Sauls. In the message ranks, we have Davids. We have Saul's. We have two different types of leadership. I trust you'll choose the Davids in your life because the under the leadership of David's, you will come into the character for a kingdom age. Can you say amen? If you're under the ministry of a Saul who has become bitter, you'll become that yourself. CJ Williams has really narrowed this down that a way that like the three things he summarized this well. three things and he made the point. He said unbelievers and the world when they run into this these type of three types of trouble he said they run a certain way but we Christians we're to run and flee to Christ. The first trouble is worry. This includes all of the whatifs. Now I want you to listen closely because I'm closing but don't miss these parts. This includes all the what-ifs that we entertain all the time. What if &gt;&gt; the bad possibilities we play out in our minds and all the variables of life that we cannot control. &gt;&gt; Fear is a powerful force of the enemy. Fear of the future. Fear of things that haven't even happened yet. And guess what? Probably 95% of them don't ever happen. But you played it out in your mind as if it was going to happen. I got some of your number. I got my number this morning. I hope you're gonna say amen. Listen, &gt;&gt; Satan uses worry and fear of things that's never even happened yet. The next thing is conflict. If you are at odds with someone and you find yourself angry and fed up, I know none of you people in literal life church every has felt this way about someone. So just try to act like you understand this. If you are at odds with someone and you find yourself angry and fed up, you don't need to stew over the situation and plot your next move. You need the guidance of the Lord and the spiritual composure to re-engage the problem with the grace and love that comes from the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Before you go back to that person, first go hide yourself in the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because if you don't run and hide yourself in the Lord, you're putting on the boxing gloves. We get mad at conflict in life and we put the boxing gloves on. Take the gloves off. The last one is weariness. This may be another pandemic around us. People are busy and people are too busy which makes them weary in body, weary in spirit, weary in emotion, on edge, burning their candle at both end. We need to do better at focusing on what is really truly important. But the fact is that if you seek to be faithful and diligent in your calling, you will have a busy life. God designed it that way. but also gave us himself as a hiding place. If you ever find yourself feeling just plain tired, hide yourself in Christ. &gt;&gt; Thank you for watching our service today.
