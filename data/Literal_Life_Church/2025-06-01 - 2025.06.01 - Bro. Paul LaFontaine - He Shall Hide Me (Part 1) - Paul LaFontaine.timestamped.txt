[4:03] Amen. Brother, Paul Bower, would you
[4:07] come and lead us in a word of prayer
[4:08] this morning? Praise the Lord. I just
[4:10] want to make a quick testimony. Um just
[4:14] singing that song. Um he is my healer
[4:16] this morning. Amen. Um
[4:20] last year sometime I got some blood work
[4:23] and thyroid levels were a little bit up.
[4:27] and uh was uh kind of put it off for a
[4:30] whole year. Got married, you know, we're
[4:33] having a baby, so I was just kind of
[4:34] putting it off and um Wednesday night
[4:37] here um I kept putting it off. She my
[4:40] doctor opened up for a full year where I
[4:42] could get it at some point in that year.
[4:44] So, I was right at the line. I was right
[4:46] close to when I needed to get it. So,
[4:49] um, Wednesday night, um, when, uh, our
[4:52] pastor was talking about, you know, he
[4:54] is the Lord that's here. He's here,
[4:57] right? And recognizing that is here and
[5:00] that we have all the benefits of him
[5:02] being here right now. Amen. He's our
[5:05] He's our healer. He's our provider.
[5:08] Amen. He's our right now. Amen. He's our
[5:10] present help in our time of need. Amen.
[5:13] So, uh, just, uh, kind of worked out
[5:17] where there was a little prayer line or
[5:19] I got prayed for on Wednesday night, had
[5:21] our pastor pray for us, and we know
[5:24] that, um, they lay their hands on the
[5:27] sick and they shall recover. So, I just
[5:29] went up believing, and I can testify
[5:31] that those, uh, I got my labs drawn on
[5:34] Friday and those labs are all trending
[5:36] down. So, they're right where they need
[5:39] to be. Amen. So even my vitamin D level
[5:42] came up and usually I'm deficient so it
[5:45] came up a little bit. I think my my wife
[5:48] brought a little bit of sunshine in my
[5:49] life that's why it came up a little bit
[5:51] but
[5:54] but God is good. Amen. I'd like to
[5:56] testify he's my healer this morning.
[5:57] Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Let's
[6:00] just uh have brother Paul come up. Amen.

[23:16] A year ago,
[23:21] About a year ago, Brother Rap preached a
[23:24] message um about the 4 and 20 elders
[23:27] around the throne and and how we kind of
[23:32] they oh my goodness, the elders, but he
[23:35] reminded us of their lives and they
[23:37] weren't all perfect. And um it it's just
[23:40] really been an impact on me every day
[23:42] because on at the end of the day, our
[23:45] righteousness, the best works on our
[23:47] best day is just filthy rags. But his
[23:50] grace, experiencing grace, that's what
[23:54] really really makes the difference. And
[23:56] so a bunch of us have talked and this
[23:58] song, I think we've all experienced
[24:00] grace. We're just going to worship him
[24:02] from our hearts. Feel free to join in
[24:04] with us or whatever.

[24:31] thankful.
[24:34] Yes, I am. I'm a fighter caught in
[24:39] struggle.
[24:41] A survivor
[24:43] rising above it.
[24:47] I'm all of these things, but mostly I'm
[24:51] thankful
[24:52] cuz you gave me one more day
[24:58] just to say I love you.
[25:02] And you have brought me all this way
[25:07] just to testify
[25:10] of your grace.
[25:13] And one more can I say
[25:18] but halleluah

[25:42] [Music]
[25:44] One more day.
[25:49] [Music]
[25:51] When the night was closing in on me, I
[25:56] didn't know
[25:57] if I'd see the morning.
[26:01] You held on to me. And Jesus, I'm
[26:05] grateful.
[26:08] Yes, I am.
[26:10] When my enemy, he turned up the fire.
[26:15] El Shai, you were right there beside me.
[26:20] You showed up for me. And Jesus, I'm
[26:25] grateful cuz you gave me one more day
[26:31] just to say I love you, Lord. I love
[26:35] you, Lord. You brought me all this way.

[26:53] Thank you Jesus.
[26:58] Thank you Jesus.
[27:03] Thank you Jesus.
[27:10] Cuz you gave me one more day.
[27:17] One more day.
[27:19] [Music]
[27:21] one more day.
[27:27] And oh,
[27:30] Lord, I just really want to praise you
[27:36] cuz you mean everything, everything,
[27:40] everything

[29:13] Thank you Jesus.
[29:17] Thank you Jesus.
[29:24] Cuz you gave me one more day,
[29:31] one more day.
[29:36] Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
[29:46] that saved a broken rich like me.
[29:55] I once was lost, but now I'm found.
[30:03] Jesus
[30:05] was blind, but now my heart
[30:09] can see.
[30:13] Gave me one more day
[30:17] to say I love you.
[30:21] [Music]
[30:24] [Applause]
[30:30] Praise the Lord. Let's just read from
[30:31] Psalms 27. We won't read the whole
[30:34] thing, but we'll pull out the the
[30:35] section that we're speaking of here now.
[30:38] Uh verse 5, for in the time of trouble
[30:40] he shall hide me. In his pavilion, in
[30:43] the secret of his tabernacle shall he
[30:46] hide me. He shall set me up upon a rock.
[30:50] Let's go to the New Testament in Hebrews
[30:52] chapter 10, if you would, and uh let's
[30:54] look at that and see if Paul picks up
[30:57] that mystery of that secret place in the
[30:59] New Testament as well. Hebrews
[31:03] chapter 10, I believe it is. Hebrews
[31:05] chapter 10
[31:07] uh verse 19 and 20. Yes. Having
[31:11] therefore, brethren, boldness to enter
[31:13] into the holiest by the blood of Jesus.
[31:16] So now, if you know your Bible, Paul is
[31:20] referring back to the shadow of the Old
[31:22] Testament tabernacle that had three
[31:24] parts to it. And he's not referring to
[31:26] the outer court. He's not reporting to
[31:29] the He's not reporting the holy place,
[31:31] but he's actually referring to the holy
[31:34] of holies, which is the last part of it,
[31:36] which is the most hidden place, which
[31:38] only the high priest could go. But now
[31:40] he's here bringing it up that we have
[31:43] found a boldness to enter into that
[31:45] holiest place by the blood of Jesus
[31:48] Christ, by a new and a living way which
[31:52] he have consecrated for us through the
[31:55] veil. that is to say, his flesh. God has
[31:59] called believers, especially in this
[32:02] last hour, to this new and living way,
[32:05] living from the inside of the inside of
[32:08] his holiest, the secret place. If he's
[32:11] called us to, how many is called to this
[32:13] message? How many's called to Christ?
[32:16] How many was somewhere and you didn't
[32:17] even know uh that if God could find find
[32:20] you and he found you? So, you know
[32:23] you've been called to Christ. You know,
[32:24] been you've been called to this message,
[32:26] but now that you've been called to him,
[32:28] there's another calling here. And he's
[32:30] called us to come with boldness into
[32:34] this holy of holies and to live from
[32:36] there and to come there with boldness
[32:37] because by the blood, he can bring us
[32:41] through that inner veil. And that's
[32:42] where we can live from. Can you say
[32:44] amen? Praise the Lord. Father, we pray
[32:47] that you'll bless every heart that's
[32:48] here this morning. And Lord, we remember
[32:51] the special time that we had yesterday
[32:53] together, Lord, communing and talking
[32:56] with you. And Lord, burdened for the
[32:58] hour that we live in and burdened with
[33:00] the word of the Lord. But now, Lord, we
[33:02] come today refreshed. We come, Lord,
[33:04] with these scriptures before us. And
[33:07] Lord, we know that we you're the one
[33:09] that opens this revelation to us, Lord.
[33:11] You're the one that breaks open things
[33:13] to us. Lord, you could show us and open
[33:15] up our eyesight. Then any blindness that
[33:17] we would have, you're a able to open up
[33:20] the blind eyes. Lord, if you're able to
[33:23] do that physically this morning, then
[33:24] you're able to do it spiritually as
[33:26] well. And Lord, he's even even believing
[33:29] for Brother Ryan's mom that she would
[33:30] walk again. Lord, the same God that made
[33:33] the lame walk when you were here 2,000
[33:35] years ago can make the lame walk again.
[33:38] And I pray that would be so for Sister
[33:40] Lori. Lord, bless her, touch her, I
[33:42] pray, and bring back healing to her
[33:44] body, I pray. And Lord Jesus, that it's
[33:47] not just a physical healing that we need
[33:50] this morning, but Lord, we trust in a
[33:52] spiritual healing that you can make the
[33:54] lame walk. You can make the blind see,
[33:57] Lord, you can make our change our minds
[33:59] and change our hearts, Lord. God, you
[34:02] can go to the innermost part of us and
[34:04] you know all that's going on. Come, Lord
[34:06] Jesus, as we have sung and the sisters
[34:09] have blessed us, Lord. And I'm sure that
[34:12] it went up as a sweet smelling savor to
[34:14] see these godly women here, Lord, and
[34:18] all that they have been through and all
[34:19] the trials and to turn back and give you
[34:22] glory and praise and honor and say, you
[34:25] know what I'm going to do at the end of
[34:27] all these trials? I'm going to thank God
[34:29] for another day. I'm going to thank him
[34:31] for what he's done in my life. Lord,
[34:33] thank you for these dear sisters that's
[34:35] blessed us. Lord, we feel your presence
[34:37] here this morning. We feel broken, Lord.
[34:40] We feel unworthy to be able to stand in
[34:43] this place and in your presence. But my
[34:45] father, would you come and say something
[34:48] to us this morning? Would you encourage
[34:50] would you strengthen the brokenhearted?
[34:52] And Lord, bring us into that place. We
[34:54] pray as we commit every word to you in
[34:58] this day to you in Jesus precious name.
[35:01] Amen. Amen. God bless you. You may be
[35:03] seated this morning.
[35:10] I want to begin to speak on this hidden
[35:13] place out of Psalms 27 and uh transition
[35:17] into this place. And this is one of the
[35:20] most incredible mysteries of the Bible.
[35:23] I am so intrigued by it. And the mystery
[35:28] of the secret place, the inner veil, the
[35:31] place that we come into is throughout
[35:34] the Bible. And it speaks of it through
[35:36] shadows and through types. And David
[35:38] refers to it, of course, quite often. We
[35:40] will in the next few Sundays get into
[35:43] David's life and and why this uh
[35:46] description of pavilion, tower, shelter.
[35:50] Uh he gave all of these word
[35:52] descriptions of place that he was in
[35:54] envisioning. And all of it speaks
[35:56] towards a place that he desired. As we
[35:59] said last Sunday, he desired more than
[36:01] anything to stay there and to be in that
[36:03] place of protection. But it's not just a
[36:05] place of protection. It's a place of
[36:08] intimate fellowship with him. And so,
[36:10] it's one of the greatest incredible
[36:11] mysteries of the Bible. And it actually
[36:14] culminates at the very end time before
[36:16] the rapture. It's actually the last
[36:19] stage that the people of God would be
[36:21] living out of before the rapture takes
[36:24] place. And uh I'll say it later in the
[36:27] in the notes, no doubt, but the Lord
[36:28] just dropped it on my heart that he, our
[36:30] loving Lord, woos our hearts to to steal
[36:34] us away. How many know the rapture is a
[36:36] is a secret stealing away. He comes and
[36:39] steals his bride and takes her away. But
[36:41] before he steals us away, he steals our
[36:44] hearts. He woos us into an intimate
[36:47] relationship with him. And uh so that's
[36:50] this place that we come to with him. And
[36:52] David actually could only desire to be
[36:54] in there. He couldn't fully come into
[36:56] that place because the veil w of the
[36:59] temple was not rent until Jesus went to
[37:01] Calvary and there was blood there so
[37:04] that the temple veil could be rent. It
[37:06] actually happened without them doing it.
[37:07] God supernaturally broke that inner veil
[37:10] that all those years only the high
[37:12] priest could go into. And God sent a
[37:14] clear message. Now that there's blood,
[37:16] now that there's a way paved, now I'm
[37:18] going to send a clear message. It's not
[37:20] just the high priest that has authority
[37:23] to come and come into that holy place.
[37:26] Now it's every believer has a right to
[37:28] come into that inner place. And he tore
[37:30] that veil from top to bottom. We know
[37:33] they went and sewed it back up. They
[37:34] went to Jerusalem tent awning, had the
[37:37] guy out, sewed it back up again because
[37:39] they completely missed the revelation
[37:41] that God had opened his place for all of
[37:44] his people to come into. And so, but
[37:47] David couldn't. He could only desire.
[37:50] I'm sure David had loved to be in the
[37:52] house of God and he loved to come into a
[37:54] a secret place with the Lord as much as
[37:56] he could, but there was no blood on the
[37:57] altar yet. And so, he couldn't come into
[38:00] there the way that we can this morning,
[38:03] the way that we can enjoy the the
[38:05] invitation that has been given to us to
[38:07] come into this place. And so, we have it
[38:10] here. And she we should make sure that
[38:13] we're living from there in living where
[38:16] living in Christ. living in Christ. I
[38:19] don't want to make this a mystery. It's
[38:20] not a mystery anymore. It's being It's
[38:22] living in Christ from your soul. It's
[38:25] being in Christ. There's a place Paul
[38:27] said, we are hid in Christ. How many
[38:30] want to be hid in Christ? Being in
[38:33] Christ is a hiding place. It's a place
[38:35] of protection. It's a place that you're
[38:38] shielded from the darts of the enemy.
[38:40] You're shielded from all the things. In
[38:42] other words, the the world may be
[38:44] affected mentally and emotionally by a
[38:46] lot of things. But he gives us a place
[38:48] that we're not as affected by those
[38:50] things because we live in a place of
[38:52] peace and rest and communion with him.
[38:55] And God has a protection there for us.
[38:58] David could not live there, but we want
[38:59] to make sure. How many would raise your
[39:01] hand? We want to make sure we're living
[39:02] in there. We want to make sure that
[39:04] we're in Jesus Christ. But I love how
[39:07] this is worded because it said, "He
[39:09] shall hide me."
[39:13] So we know we preach that we should get
[39:14] in that hidden place, but he says in
[39:17] this case, "I'll hide my people."
[39:20] You know, it must be pretty bad in these
[39:22] days. And and this scripture, Psalms 27,
[39:25] is talking about our day. A few weeks
[39:26] ago, I brought out all the attributes
[39:28] that he brings that's similar to our
[39:31] day. the mental illness, the emotional
[39:33] instability, all these things that
[39:35] mother and father forsaken you. It's all
[39:38] there in Psalms 27 that speaks of our
[39:40] day. It must be a pretty bad day for God
[39:43] to have to say, "You know what? I'll
[39:45] take my people and I'll hide them in my
[39:48] pavilion."
[39:49] And when I'm not uh leaning and yielding
[39:52] to him enough, I pray he would hide me.
[39:55] Can you say amen?
[39:57] must be pretty bad. He he has to steal
[39:59] us away and hide us away. But as a
[40:03] foundation this morning, I I want to
[40:05] take this very slow and lay a foundation
[40:08] so that we understand some things.
[40:10] There's a great revelation that's been
[40:12] brought to us in the evening time about
[40:14] God's only provided place of worship. It
[40:17] was broken to us through the prophet of
[40:19] this day. And he he began this uh
[40:22] breaking this open through the scripture
[40:24] Deuteronomy 16:1. I'd like you guys to
[40:26] pull that up. Deuteronomy 16:1 and he
[40:28] just reads this Old Testament uh uh
[40:31] thing here to this scripture to be able
[40:33] to show something. Observe the month of
[40:35] Abib and keep the Passover. The Lord thy
[40:37] God in the fourth month of Abib. The
[40:40] Lord thy God brought thee forth out of
[40:42] Egypt by night. Thou shalt therefore
[40:45] sacrifice the Passover unto the Lord thy
[40:48] God of the flocks and of thy herd in the
[40:51] place which the Lord has chosen to place
[40:55] his name there. And the prophet takes
[40:57] this and begins to go through the
[40:59] scripture and show us that God has a
[41:02] provided place that has blood. It has
[41:05] his lamb. And here in the scripture, I'd
[41:08] like you to notice that it was in the
[41:09] evening time. It was the Passover. And
[41:12] when they bring the Passover, they bring
[41:14] the Passover lamb. So this also speaks
[41:16] of our day because we live in the
[41:18] evening time. And in the evening time,
[41:20] they're bringing the Passover lamb. And
[41:22] when they bring the lamb, they come to
[41:24] worship. They come to worship. But he
[41:26] said in that particular one place, I
[41:30] choose that place. That's where you need
[41:33] to worship because I choose to put my
[41:37] name there. Amen. So we have to we have
[41:41] to realize it's not where we choose to
[41:45] put the name of God. It's where he
[41:48] chooses to put his name.
[41:54] And God has a provided place because
[41:57] that's what we're preaching on is a
[41:58] place. And he has one provided place in
[42:02] the evening time that we bring our
[42:05] worship that we that we worship the
[42:07] lamb. We don't worship a man. We don't
[42:10] worship a church. We don't worship a
[42:12] system. We don't develop a new system of
[42:15] denomination. There's enough of them.
[42:17] When we come to the end time in the
[42:19] evening time, it's about the lamb and
[42:22] it's about worshiping in the right place
[42:24] with that lamb. And that's as simple as
[42:26] it is. At the end, it's about worship in
[42:29] God's provided place of worship. and
[42:32] worship somewhere else that we have
[42:34] created is not where God go God may not
[42:37] choose that but we need to find the
[42:39] place that he is bringing his name and
[42:42] his power that we could worship in that
[42:45] place. I know these are foundational
[42:48] things but I want you to listen as we
[42:50] lay this foundation. So it would not be
[42:52] that man puts his name where he wants to
[42:54] because today we have many people that
[42:56] attach themselves to the name of Jesus.
[42:58] They have many people take Jesus' name
[43:00] and they place it in their denomination.
[43:03] We're going to use this because this is
[43:05] this is Christ is Jesus Christ. And so
[43:07] they choose to put his name. But his
[43:09] name is not just a physical name. His
[43:11] name is a manifestation. His name is a
[43:14] power. His name uh is is as I said a
[43:17] manifestation. So it's in the place God
[43:20] chooses, not where we choose. It's in
[43:22] the place God chooses to put his name.
[43:26] And so as the prophet introduces this
[43:28] revelation to us, we realize that he's
[43:31] in the middle, he says, of about 900
[43:35] different denominations
[43:37] within Christianity.
[43:41] 900 within Christianity.
[43:44] And then so now he he begins to bring
[43:46] this subject, but God only has one
[43:48] provided place of worship. And he says,
[43:51] everybody's attaching themselves.
[43:52] Everybody's saying this is the place. We
[43:54] got an edge. we got a monopoly on truth.
[43:57] And they're all saying, "You got to come
[43:58] to our church to be able to find that."
[44:00] And he's taking it scripturally. And
[44:02] he's dismantling that whole idea that
[44:05] it's in a church, that it's in a
[44:07] denomination. We could safely say that
[44:09] God himself, his spirit, has never ever
[44:12] worked with the system of a
[44:14] denomination.
[44:17] Wow. Don't get any amens on that. That's
[44:19] exactly right. The only organized system
[44:22] was not of God. It was they're going to
[44:24] it was an organized religious system of
[44:26] the Tower of Babel and they organized
[44:28] and they brought unity to build a tower
[44:30] to get into heaven so that when the if
[44:32] the flood came again they got their own
[44:34] way to heaven. They would make their own
[44:36] way to heaven and that's the only
[44:37] organized system. God wasn't in it at
[44:40] all. In fact, God had to confuse their
[44:42] language to stop it or else they would
[44:43] have finished building it. That's how
[44:45] powerful it is in man's hand to build
[44:48] his own system and attach the name of
[44:51] God to it. Look what we're doing for
[44:53] God.
[44:55] But you see now 900 different
[44:57] denominations. Now today it grows to
[45:00] about 35,000. It's probably closer to
[45:02] 40,000 now if you look it up. 40,000 not
[45:06] not the Islam religion, not uh Buddha,
[45:09] not these things within Christianity.
[45:12] Almost 40,000
[45:14] uh different ways all say they have edge
[45:17] on truth. We are the way. We are the
[45:19] only way. God just accepts all of them.
[45:22] Listen, God accepts all of these just
[45:25] because they attach his name to it. Not
[45:27] necessarily.
[45:30] God doesn't attach himself to it just
[45:32] because they attach his name of Jesus to
[45:35] it. And it gives the human beings, you
[45:38] know, uh, you know, when you talk about
[45:40] 40 different thous,000 different uh
[45:43] choices, it gives the human beings a lot
[45:46] of choices.
[45:49] So I just want us to take a minute and
[45:51] just notice that that's very leodian
[45:55] to give human beings a lot of choices
[45:59] and actually the choices we have so many
[46:02] we have such convenience today that we
[46:05] have so many choices of so many things
[46:07] and it makes it fit the likings of the
[46:11] human being. If we have more choices for
[46:13] thing then we can choose something that
[46:15] fits us more.
[46:18] Um, all right. So the children and
[46:20] everybody can understand go into a, you
[46:23] know, we can go into a store and we
[46:26] don't just years ago we went into a
[46:27] grocery store years ago there was just
[46:29] maybe one brand of something.
[46:32] Now there's hundreds of brands with all
[46:34] different go and I always use this
[46:36] example. Go down Kroger in the shampoo
[46:40] aisle and it's it's not just a little
[46:43] two choices. It's a whole mile long of
[46:47] just shampoo choices. And if you want it
[46:50] greasy or if you want it dry or if you
[46:53] want a little bit of this, a little bit
[46:55] of that, if you want herbs in it, if you
[46:57] want oranges in it, if you want plums in
[47:00] it,
[47:02] and and I'm I'm going down. I don't
[47:04] know. It actually makes me nervous. I
[47:08] just want some shampoo to wash my hair.
[47:10] My wife says I need to wash my hair. I
[47:11] just want one. I'd be happier with just
[47:13] one. But look at all the the shampoos
[47:16] and look at all the products. It's le
[47:18] oysia. Keep giving human beings and
[47:22] catering to the human being to give them
[47:24] many many choices to satisfy them and to
[47:29] fit their preferences. I'm not so sure
[47:32] that's a good idea because what we do is
[47:34] when we come to church then and someone
[47:36] wants to serve the Lord, we've got many
[47:38] choices as well. We got so many
[47:40] different variations. Can you say amen?
[47:43] And uh you know at the restaurant the
[47:45] other day uh and I always notice this,
[47:47] but you know it's the waitress is
[47:49] putting pressure on you because there's
[47:51] so many choices. First of all, you make
[47:53] the choice of what you're going to eat
[47:55] out of the the huge menu. So you got to
[47:58] decide and you got oh my goodness, what
[47:59] is my preference? What is my taste buds?
[48:01] And so there's so many choices. Then the
[48:03] waitress is asking you more choices
[48:05] based upon what you order. Do you want
[48:07] this? What kind of salad? Do you want
[48:09] this on it? You want that on it? And
[48:11] when you finish, if this is the kind of
[48:12] salad, what kind of dressing do you
[48:14] want? What you know, like it just goes
[48:17] on and on. And bread. Well, what kind of
[48:20] bread do you want? Now, I know this is
[48:22] really stupidly simple this morning, but
[48:24] I'm trying to get a point to you.
[48:27] We have moved into this thing of
[48:29] humanity given all the preferences they
[48:32] want. Could it be that the devil has
[48:35] given lots of ways to worship God?
[48:40] And brother Brandham's bringing out,
[48:42] he's saying there's only one provided
[48:44] place of worship. You know where it is?
[48:47] In the shed blood of Jesus Christ. It's
[48:49] in Jesus Christ. One place, not a
[48:52] church, but it's in Christ. And that's
[48:55] the one place. And so you have all this,
[48:57] you know, and the funny little story.
[49:00] One waitress asked me one day, you know,
[49:02] she was getting creative how she asked
[49:03] and she she asked me uh at the end of
[49:05] getting my salad ordered and all that,
[49:07] she says, "And and how do you feel? How
[49:10] do you feel about blue cheese?"
[49:15] Everybody's kind of quiet because that's
[49:16] a strange question. I had never in my
[49:18] life been asked the question how I felt.
[49:23] It It wasn't whether I wanted blue
[49:25] cheese. It's how do I how do you feel
[49:27] about blue cheese? And so I played along
[49:29] with it. I just I kind of embarrassed
[49:31] her cuz I said, "You know, ma'am, I
[49:34] don't think in my entire life I've ever
[49:36] actually considered what I feel about
[49:39] blue cheese dressing."
[49:42] She got a little embarrassed. My wife
[49:44] was saying, "Shut up."
[49:47] But it was an interesting way to ask it
[49:49] because now it's not just ordering
[49:50] something in your preference. It's how
[49:52] you feel about it. And I said, "Well, I
[49:54] guess I get need to get in touch with my
[49:56] inner feelings about
[50:01] Praise the Lord. Preferences. My wife is
[50:04] the queen of substitutes. She's always
[50:06] substituting something. Even in a
[50:08] drive-thru, she's substituting something
[50:10] else for something else. Honey, just
[50:13] order what's on the menu, please.
[50:16] She's the queen of substitutes. Can I
[50:19] substitute this for that? And you know,
[50:21] it it's it's a culture to cater to human
[50:23] beings and to make everything fit us and
[50:26] our preferences. You ever go into a
[50:27] Bible bookstore and see how many
[50:29] different Bible choices you have?
[50:33] And I don't knock all of them, but they
[50:34] cater to, you know, you got a this Bible
[50:36] and you got a camouflage Bible and you
[50:38] got a Bible for fishermen and you got a
[50:40] Bible for deer hunting. I'm serious. And
[50:44] you got this and the teenage Bible and
[50:46] the the woman that's going through her
[50:49] time or life Bible and you got this. And
[50:51] I looked it up. According to the Bible
[50:53] project, there are over 900 English
[50:56] translations of the Bible. Each aims to
[50:58] cater to various cater to various
[51:02] reading preferences.
[51:05] Anybody awake this morning?
[51:07] 900 different English translations. And
[51:11] then, you know, it was really funny to
[51:13] see the new emoji Bible out for all the
[51:16] millennials.
[51:18] It's all about preferences.
[51:21] Christianity has become the same way.
[51:24] But we don't work, listen now, we don't
[51:26] work to make things fit us.
[51:30] Can I get an amen? We don't come to this
[51:33] to make the gospel and make the message,
[51:36] make everything fit us. We come and make
[51:39] us fit the gospel.
[51:42] We cut. My dad used to say it that you
[51:44] know when you got a big piece of garment
[51:46] there and you're going to make a dress
[51:47] out of it and they take it and they cut
[51:49] out the they cut the dress uh to so
[51:52] because they're going to make a dress
[51:53] out of the fabric and then the remnant
[51:54] is laid aside and and God and so he used
[51:57] to say my dad used to say he said it's
[51:59] it's it's it's guess who gets cut. It
[52:02] it's it's we that get cut to the word of
[52:04] God. We don't cut up the word to fit us.
[52:08] We cut our lives to fit this word.
[52:12] Praise the Lord.
[52:14] So, you know, there's one place. And so,
[52:17] now there's lots of choices then where
[52:19] to worship and your preferences and how
[52:21] deceiving this is. Anyone that says we
[52:24] are the uh uh that that and let me just
[52:26] bring it close to home here. Any church
[52:28] that starts to say we have the right way
[52:31] or we have a monopoly on truth or we
[52:34] have the only way and they're putting
[52:36] down other systems of denominations. I'm
[52:39] here to say even in our own ranks if
[52:41] we're lifting up our doctrine or lifting
[52:43] up our church as being the only way and
[52:46] belittling everyone else. I wonder if we
[52:49] have the same denominational spirit that
[52:52] says we have a monopoly on truth. We do
[52:55] not have anything except for the grace
[52:57] of God. We do not have a monopoly on
[53:00] truth. Truth is Jesus Christ. Can you
[53:02] say amen? We preach that truth, but it's
[53:05] not in a church. It's not in
[53:07] Jeffersonville. It's not in your church.
[53:09] It's not in my church. It's not in a
[53:11] building. It's in Jesus Christ, the lamb
[53:14] of God.
[53:17] And I just I could say a lot more, but
[53:19] just be politely now. We must be careful
[53:22] that we don't adopt a lot of the same
[53:24] attitude as denominations that we have
[53:27] the thing and everybody else is down
[53:30] here and we're up here. If you're moving
[53:32] up here in Revelation, let me see the
[53:35] humility of God. Because to me, a
[53:38] revelation brings more humility that I'm
[53:41] only here by his grace. I'm not better
[53:43] than any other church person. If I am
[53:46] better, it's only because there's no
[53:48] good thing in me. It's only because his
[53:51] grace. If I have more revelation, it
[53:53] should bring more humility. Paul said
[53:56] that knowledge puffth up. So maybe you
[53:59] don't have as much revelation as you
[54:01] have knowledge. Cuz I see a bunch of
[54:03] puffing up.
[54:06] Praise the Lord.
[54:08] He meets a man. This is the great truth
[54:10] revealed. There's one place in Jesus
[54:12] Christ, a lamb. He meets man only in
[54:14] that one place. In the shed blood of
[54:16] Jesus Christ. Christ. Listen. Now,
[54:19] Christ is the word to every generation.
[54:22] As brother Jack Duff was here a few
[54:23] weeks ago, and he was bringing out the
[54:25] attribute of that name, the name that I
[54:28] am. He didn't have the name of Jesus
[54:29] yet, the physical name, but he had a
[54:31] name. And when Moses came and said, "Who
[54:34] shall I tell the people sent me?" He
[54:36] said, "Here's my name. Tell them I am
[54:38] that I am." So, his manifestation of his
[54:41] name is I am that I am. Tell the people
[54:45] what's your name. Tell the people I am.
[54:47] Not I was, not I will be, but I'm always
[54:52] the I am.
[54:54] You'll find me. You'll find that place.
[54:58] Never in a God of history and never in a
[55:00] God of the future, but you'll find me
[55:03] right there in the I am.
[55:07] Hallelujah.
[55:10] when it came time for his verbal name
[55:12] that we would say it was Jesus.
[55:16] Even before he was born, his name shall
[55:19] be called Jesus. So it must have been
[55:21] that was already established that his
[55:24] name would be called Jesus. It was Jesus
[55:27] even before he was born. And so Jesus
[55:29] will always be the manifested I am.
[55:33] Jesus will always be the word manifested
[55:35] to every generation. Jesus is not just
[55:39] the Jesus that walked on the shores of
[55:41] Galilee 2,000 years ago. Jesus from the
[55:44] beginning was the word. Can you say
[55:46] amen? He will always be the word. And
[55:48] when we have the word in every
[55:50] generation, we have a manifestation of
[55:53] the I am, which is Jesus Christ.
[55:58] So, I know that just dispels our former
[56:00] ideas, denominational ideas of who Jesus
[56:02] is. It's not just that he was 2,000
[56:04] years ago and that's Jesus and we're
[56:06] trying to be like him. Jesus is the word
[56:08] of every generation. He is the I am. The
[56:10] I am is where God and so now let's move
[56:12] on. The I am is where God meets man and
[56:15] accepts worship. The I am the I am is
[56:19] God's provided place. How many believe
[56:21] that God's provided place of worship is
[56:23] in Jesus Christ and only in Jesus
[56:25] Christ? He is the word. So now if that's
[56:27] the only place he says that's the
[56:29] provided place of worship. That's where
[56:31] worship is truly accepted in the I am in
[56:34] Jesus Christ in the lamb of God in the
[56:38] blood of the lamb. That's our place for
[56:40] fellowship. Cain tried to bring
[56:44] an offering to God without blood. It was
[56:47] of his own making. It was worship. It
[56:50] was worship but no blood.
[56:55] Can you say amen?
[56:59] So the I am is where God meets and wor
[57:01] ac accepts worship when we come with our
[57:03] own place and attach his name to it. And
[57:06] I trust you all precious Christians are
[57:08] listening today. Whoever's listening I
[57:10] trust you when when we whenever we take
[57:12] the name of Jesus and attach it to our
[57:15] church system it does not mean that he's
[57:17] there or that he endorses it or accepts
[57:19] the worship. No matter how sincere Cain
[57:22] Cain's worship was very sincere but it
[57:24] was worship his own way through his own
[57:26] thing. There was no shed blood there
[57:28] which mean there was no life. If you
[57:30] have blood you have life. There was no
[57:32] life. It was just fruits. It was just
[57:34] just produce the fruits. Just be like
[57:36] today it would be be like Jesus. Try to
[57:38] put on and be Jesus. But if there's no
[57:40] life of his blood there you don't have
[57:42] any life to be Jesus. So you got to have
[57:45] blood to have his life. Not just the
[57:47] fruits. Kate had fruits but no blood
[57:49] there. So doing all the right things is
[57:51] not enough. There's no blood for sin
[57:54] there and no blood for new life. No
[57:56] repentance will never work the blood of
[57:59] God in our lives. Repentance is not just
[58:02] agreeing but repentance is accepting the
[58:05] shed blood of Jesus Christ to wash us
[58:09] from our sin. I was just say this. I
[58:12] don't care how wonderful a service is to
[58:16] a minister like me. Unless we leave with
[58:20] a repentant heart of where the word has
[58:22] corrected us, it will do us no good. The
[58:25] shed blood begins to flow in our lives
[58:27] to wash our sin away when we have a
[58:30] truly repentant heart. You don't have to
[58:33] come to this altar. If you do, that's
[58:35] fine. But I trust that we would never
[58:38] leave this building when the word is
[58:40] spoken without repenting. The Bible says
[58:43] in the later scene and age, be zealous,
[58:44] therefore, and repent.
[58:47] It starts with repenting. God, I'm
[58:49] wrong. You're right. God, you show me
[58:50] where I'm wrong today. Forgive me, Lord.
[58:53] And don't Lord, don't let me be a
[58:54] one-man denomination.
[58:57] We got 40,000. We don't need 40,000 in
[58:59] one. You know, people can make their own
[59:02] denomination in their own mind, their
[59:04] own system, their own worship. I'll
[59:06] approach God this way. I'll dress the
[59:07] way I want to dress. I'll do the thing I
[59:09] want to do. I I know Paul said modesty,
[59:12] but that was for his day. Modesty was
[59:14] for his day. You don't have a right to
[59:16] do that and be your own denomination.
[59:18] What does the word say? We surrender. We
[59:20] repent. And through that repentance, he
[59:23] gives us the blood, the life of his
[59:25] blood to be able to live the true word
[59:27] of God. Can I Can you say amen? So,
[59:30] Brother Brandham says, "But there's one
[59:31] thing you must know. You've got to be in
[59:33] Christ or you're dead. You can't live
[59:36] outside of him. Your church may be
[59:38] right. I hope you guys have those quotes
[59:40] there. Your church might be all right as
[59:42] of a building. Your fellowship might be
[59:45] all right as a man. But when you deny,
[59:47] listen to this now. The body, the blood,
[59:50] and the word of Jesus Christ. You're
[59:52] dead the minute you do. Notice how he
[59:54] brings it all into one one place. The
[59:57] shed blood of Jesus Christ. But he says
[59:59] the body, the blood, the body was 2,000
[1:00:02] years ago at the cross. How many believe
[1:00:04] he he purchased our salvation there? He
[1:00:07] paid the price. That body went as a
[1:00:09] memorial. Talking Wednesday night, it
[1:00:10] went as a memorial. And so, but he's
[1:00:12] here in every way except his corporal
[1:00:14] body. Oh, it's just so wonderful,
[1:00:16] friends. Glory be to God. That body had
[1:00:18] to be there and go up to heaven as a
[1:00:20] memorial in the presence of God. So that
[1:00:23] every time God looks at us, he looks
[1:00:26] through that body that went to Calvary.
[1:00:28] And he can only see us as perfect in his
[1:00:31] eyes. Amen. Hallelujah. And then besides
[1:00:35] that, he sends his Holy Ghost all of
[1:00:37] himself to the earth to live within us.
[1:00:40] So, it's a win-win situation. God sees
[1:00:43] us through his blood and we live by the
[1:00:45] Holy Ghost here on earth. It's a
[1:00:47] win-win. This bride is going to be
[1:00:50] victorious. Not because of you, but
[1:00:52] because of his grace. Didn't the sisters
[1:00:55] sing it to us? It's by his grace that we
[1:00:58] have another day.
[1:01:01] Hallelujah. And so now the body, the
[1:01:05] blood, and the word of Jesus Christ.
[1:01:07] Because a lot of people would say,
[1:01:08] "Well, if we look back 2,000 years ago,
[1:01:10] we just believe in the body and that's
[1:01:11] enough." No, no. The body, the blood,
[1:01:13] which is the life that's in the word and
[1:01:16] the word. You can't deny the word,
[1:01:18] especially of your day, and tap into the
[1:01:20] blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:01:23] It's okay. You don't have to say amen to
[1:01:24] that. But you can never separate the
[1:01:27] word from what he did at Calvary
[1:01:31] because that was the word that went to
[1:01:32] us, went to Calvary for us. It was the
[1:01:35] word that bled for us. And through the
[1:01:38] life of that, going through church ages,
[1:01:40] his word is still bleeding for us.
[1:01:43] It's the bleeding word. Can you say
[1:01:45] amen? When you preach the word in all of
[1:01:47] its fullness, it's bleeding for you.
[1:01:49] It's washing you. It's cleansing you.
[1:01:52] That's why Paul said the bride will be a
[1:01:55] spotless bride at the end time by what?
[1:01:57] The washing of the water by the word.
[1:02:04] Why? Because the blood is in the word.
[1:02:07] I'll just say this as a pastor's an
[1:02:09] instruction. If you're not in that word
[1:02:12] in your Bible and in the message, you
[1:02:14] can't find something to wash your life.
[1:02:17] You stay in that word. You listen to it.
[1:02:20] you, you know, there's too many people
[1:02:22] and especially young people, they're not
[1:02:24] listening. And sometimes I'll say
[1:02:25] something over the pulpit and I look
[1:02:27] like I'm from another planet, but I'm
[1:02:30] preaching the message. And if you were
[1:02:32] in the message, you know what I was
[1:02:34] preaching. But here's the other benefit.
[1:02:36] It'll wash your life over.
[1:02:38] It'll wash you of your sin. Sin is
[1:02:41] unbelief. It'll wash away unbelief.
[1:02:44] Praise be to God. Watch how he points to
[1:02:47] to the job now of John the Baptist who
[1:02:51] has the spirit of Elijah to introduce
[1:02:54] this one place of worship through Jesus
[1:02:56] Christ. Watch how John is sent to
[1:02:58] introduce it. The next quote and he
[1:02:59] looked around. John looked around and he
[1:03:01] said, "Behold, there he is. There's
[1:03:04] God's chosen place of worship.
[1:03:08] Behold, there he is." This is John the
[1:03:10] eagle with the spirit of Elijah on him.
[1:03:13] He says, "Behold." One day he looks and
[1:03:14] said, "Behold, there he is. There's
[1:03:16] God's chosen place of worship. There's
[1:03:18] the lamb, the real lamb that takes away
[1:03:20] the sin of the world." He didn't say,
[1:03:21] "Here comes the Methodists. Here comes
[1:03:23] the Baptist, the Pharisees, the
[1:03:24] Sadducees, all the system." He didn't
[1:03:26] point to that. He said, "There comes the
[1:03:28] lamb of God that takes away the sin of
[1:03:30] the world." Listen now, related to my
[1:03:33] subject today, the only safety zone
[1:03:35] there is is in the lamb of God.
[1:03:40] In him alone is salvation.
[1:03:43] Not in any church, any creed, any
[1:03:47] people, any father, any mother, any holy
[1:03:51] man. He's covering a lot of stuff that I
[1:03:54] think some pe sometimes people they have
[1:03:56] a crutch in their family. They have a
[1:03:58] crutch that they lean on. They lean on a
[1:04:00] holy man. They lean on a father. They
[1:04:03] lean on a mother. They lean on a creed
[1:04:05] of some system or any people. He said,
[1:04:08] "No, no. Salvation alone is not in any
[1:04:11] church, not even literal life church.
[1:04:13] Salvation is not in a church, any
[1:04:16] people, any father, any mother, any holy
[1:04:18] man, nothing holy place. It's in the
[1:04:21] holy God, the Lord Jesus Christ, where
[1:04:23] God placed his name on the human being
[1:04:26] for redemption, who paid the price for
[1:04:28] us sinners. That's the only place that
[1:04:31] there is salvation. That's the rock that
[1:04:33] I stand on.
[1:04:36] And when John looked up and saw the
[1:04:38] spirit coming, he said, 'I bear record.
[1:04:40] This is him. Oh my, there's you catching
[1:04:42] what he's saying now? Okay. There was a
[1:04:44] ministry introduced
[1:04:47] before Jesus came the first time, the
[1:04:49] lamb. And if he spoke throughout the Old
[1:04:52] Testament of the one provided place of
[1:04:53] worship, now when you come to John, he's
[1:04:56] going to introduce. It's not going to be
[1:04:57] about John's ministry. In fact, when
[1:04:59] he's finished doing this, and what's he
[1:05:01] going to do? What's he going to do?
[1:05:02] What's his ministry? to point us to the
[1:05:05] one provided place of worship.
[1:05:10] John could have said anything, but John
[1:05:11] said, "Okay, everything you read about
[1:05:14] in the Old Testament, the one provided
[1:05:16] place of worship, here he is." And
[1:05:18] actually became a man. It wasn't a
[1:05:19] tabernacle, wasn't a pillar of fire. It
[1:05:22] became a man. He was the tabernacle. And
[1:05:24] he pointed to Jesus Christ and he said,
[1:05:26] "Behold the lamb of God. He's the
[1:05:30] provided place of worship."
[1:05:33] He points, he said, "There's your
[1:05:34] worship. There's your hiding place.
[1:05:36] There's the lamb of God that takes away
[1:05:37] the sin of the world." Excuse me for
[1:05:38] reading so many quotes this morning. No,
[1:05:41] not no church, no creed, nothing else,
[1:05:42] but the lamb of God that takes away the
[1:05:44] sin of the world. See how John placed
[1:05:46] it. He didn't say, "You Pharisees is
[1:05:48] right. You Sadducees, you Herodians." He
[1:05:50] said, "There's the lamb." Malachi 3 was
[1:05:53] John. He we might say this. Now he jumps
[1:05:56] to Malachi 4. Aren't we supposed to be
[1:05:58] promised another eagle, a pillar of
[1:06:00] light to be following? Because John,
[1:06:03] Jesus said John was a light and you were
[1:06:04] willing to rejoice in that light. What
[1:06:06] did that light do in John the Baptist?
[1:06:08] It pointed us to the lamb. Now he said,
[1:06:11] "Weren't we were supposed to receive uh
[1:06:14] uh let me pick this up. He said in
[1:06:16] Malachi 4, aren't we also promised
[1:06:18] another eagle, a pillar of light to be
[1:06:20] following to show, listen, the airing
[1:06:23] church this day that he is Hebrews 13:8,
[1:06:26] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:06:28] Aren't we promised another one to come
[1:06:30] flying from the wilderness?" Amen.
[1:06:32] That's exactly the truth. How fitting
[1:06:34] and matching it is to Luke 17:30 where
[1:06:37] the son of man, eagle, will be revealing
[1:06:39] himself to bring to not all other
[1:06:43] worship places such as denominations and
[1:06:46] so forth. What's he saying? The same
[1:06:48] thing that John the Baptist did. Here's
[1:06:50] the one place and I'm pointing to to
[1:06:53] you. It's the lamb.
[1:06:55] And guess what? Malachi 4 will do
[1:06:58] exactly the same thing.
[1:07:02] That's that's it. That's his ministry.
[1:07:05] Because now we're going to have 900 and
[1:07:06] then it jumps to 40,000 different
[1:07:08] denominations in Christianity. You ought
[1:07:10] to be lift your hand and say, "Thank God
[1:07:12] for another Elijah that points us to the
[1:07:15] one pl provided place of worship." And
[1:07:17] it's not in a church. It's in the lamb,
[1:07:20] the shed blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:07:26] Praise the Lord. There's only one place
[1:07:28] that God puts his name and that's not in
[1:07:30] a church but in Jesus. There's only one
[1:07:32] place of worship. There's only one place
[1:07:34] that we are you are received and that is
[1:07:36] in the beloved Jesus Christ. There's not
[1:07:37] another name under heaven given among
[1:07:39] men whereby we be saved. No church, no
[1:07:42] creed, no nothing. Jesus Christ. And
[1:07:44] that's supposed to be the message of the
[1:07:47] hour. I I'm I'm emphasizing this to say
[1:07:50] what is the message of the hour? What is
[1:07:52] the message of the hour? Well, I can
[1:07:54] tell you it's not just another pebble on
[1:07:56] the beach of a healing evangelist. It's
[1:07:58] not that. It's more than that. Can I say
[1:08:01] this? In this hour, Satan has taken this
[1:08:05] ministry of William Brandom and he's
[1:08:07] lifted it way high to a position of
[1:08:10] Jesus Christ. But then you got another
[1:08:12] influence even sometimes coming trying
[1:08:14] to come among us to lower it to make him
[1:08:17] just another man of God down here. He's
[1:08:20] not down here. He's not up here. He's
[1:08:22] what the scripture said. It's another
[1:08:24] Elijah to come. But when his ministry
[1:08:27] phase out phases out, it's because he's
[1:08:30] done one thing. He's pointed all of us
[1:08:32] to the provided place of worship. Back
[1:08:35] to Jesus Christ. And any ministry who's
[1:08:38] pointing only to William Brandham or
[1:08:40] pointing to himself, that's a deceptive
[1:08:42] ministry.
[1:08:44] Can I say it? Because brother Brandham
[1:08:47] did not point us to himself or some
[1:08:50] other other minister to take over. He
[1:08:52] pointed us back to the lamb Jesus Christ
[1:08:55] the word.
[1:08:57] That's how this ends up the provided
[1:09:00] place of worship. The message end result
[1:09:03] is to point us to back.
[1:09:07] Let me finish what he said here. And
[1:09:08] that's supposed to be the message of the
[1:09:09] hour. I just love that statement. That's
[1:09:11] supposed to be the message of the hour.
[1:09:13] But how people make it something
[1:09:15] different than what it is
[1:09:17] to restore back the hearts of the
[1:09:19] children back to the faith that was once
[1:09:20] delivered to the saints once you accept
[1:09:21] it tonight. Praise the Lord. You still
[1:09:24] with me? I'm still building a
[1:09:26] foundation. Looks like I have to put
[1:09:28] this next Sunday here. Hang on with me.
[1:09:31] The message end result is to point you
[1:09:33] to one place back to the bloody lamb
[1:09:36] through the word and to bring to not
[1:09:39] every other place that has been pushed
[1:09:42] for you to worship under. Whatever has
[1:09:45] been said through our messenger has the
[1:09:47] goal of bringing us to that one place in
[1:09:51] Christ and warning us of any other
[1:09:54] deceiving modern idea that sells itself
[1:09:58] as another place to worship Jesus under.
[1:10:02] Can I say it again? The message has come
[1:10:05] with the goal of bringing us to that one
[1:10:08] place in Jesus Christ. Do we need it
[1:10:11] after 2,000 years? Do we need it after
[1:10:14] 40,000 different denominations? Do we
[1:10:16] need us to be brought back to the one
[1:10:19] worship place? We needed it.
[1:10:24] And it's the message isn't just to do
[1:10:26] that, but it's to warn us. You say,
[1:10:27] "Well, my he's so harsh and this or he's
[1:10:30] so straight even to the women of this
[1:10:32] generation." Listen, it's it's all to
[1:10:35] bring you back. When you shed things and
[1:10:38] you get rid of things and you die out to
[1:10:40] yourself, you know where it's leading
[1:10:42] you? In that secret place with Jesus
[1:10:45] Christ before the rapture.
[1:10:49] I can't take the dress code. Well,
[1:10:51] you're looking at it wrong. It's not a
[1:10:52] dress code anyway. And by the way,
[1:10:54] talking to our brother about this on
[1:10:56] Friday, by the way, it wasn't brother
[1:10:59] Brandham that
[1:11:01] brought up all these dress codes and
[1:11:04] holiness.
[1:11:07] He only echoed what was restored under
[1:11:09] the Wesleyan movement of holiness.
[1:11:13] Most of this stuff was already here and
[1:11:15] it was normal.
[1:11:17] So people are attaching all this dress
[1:11:19] code to brother Brandham. And brother
[1:11:20] Bram No, no, no. Brother Bram said for a
[1:11:22] woman not to cut her hair. Brother Bram
[1:11:23] didn't say that. He only echoed what the
[1:11:25] scripture says that she shouldn't cut
[1:11:27] her hair. It's her glory to her. Don't
[1:11:29] lay a pair of scissors to it. It's your
[1:11:31] glory, sisters. That's what the Bible
[1:11:33] says.
[1:11:36] So the dress and all these other things
[1:11:38] Malachi 4 is just blasting out. What's
[1:11:40] he doing? He's pointing out any other
[1:11:42] thing that a person just wiggles
[1:11:44] themselves and creates their own thing.
[1:11:46] And I'm going to worship God. I want to
[1:11:48] worship God, but I want to worship him
[1:11:50] this way, my own way. And all the while
[1:11:54] he's pointing us to the lamb, the word
[1:11:55] of God. No. When you shed all those
[1:11:58] things, you're ready to worship purely
[1:12:00] in fellowship and intimacy with him. And
[1:12:02] let me finish it with one quote here out
[1:12:04] of God's chosen place of worship. It's
[1:12:06] the last one here. My friends, I don't
[1:12:08] want to hurt your feelings, but I'm
[1:12:10] responsible for a message. And that
[1:12:13] messages come out of this mess.
[1:12:19] If you're in a mess, whatever it is, the
[1:12:22] message has come to call you out of that
[1:12:25] mess.
[1:12:27] Maybe you're not in a mess of a church
[1:12:29] system, but your life is a mess. Guess
[1:12:31] what? All the messes God's come to
[1:12:35] change.
[1:12:37] God's called out. Maybe you got family
[1:12:39] messes. Maybe your life is a mess. Guess
[1:12:42] what? He's come to call you out all of
[1:12:46] the mess.
[1:12:50] Brother Brham says this, "If I asked you
[1:12:51] to come out, where am I going to take
[1:12:53] you?
[1:12:56] Would I take you to Brandham Tabernacle?
[1:12:58] it's as much fault as any of the rest of
[1:13:01] them. I just wanted to add that in
[1:13:05] because when he comes to the end of the
[1:13:07] message, he says, "Now, if I'm saying
[1:13:08] I'm going to point to something and I'm
[1:13:10] saying the spirit's calling us out of
[1:13:12] all systems and places to worship that
[1:13:14] his name is really not there." Then
[1:13:16] where am I going to point the people? To
[1:13:18] himself? No. No. Where am I going to
[1:13:20] take the people to Brandham Tabernacle?
[1:13:23] It's as much at fault as the rest of
[1:13:25] them. You know what he just did?
[1:13:28] There's got to be, you know, people tell
[1:13:30] me to push play.
[1:13:32] I wish they would push play on that one.
[1:13:37] That Brandham Tabo is as much fault as
[1:13:40] any of the rest of them. And I'll say
[1:13:41] Literal Life Church, any church that's
[1:13:43] just a church, that's not the place he
[1:13:46] chooses to put his name. It's not in a
[1:13:48] church.
[1:13:50] And when people become all proud about
[1:13:52] their church, well, that's nice. That's
[1:13:54] wonderful. But don't start procilating
[1:13:56] saying we've got revelated truth and
[1:13:57] they pressure people and they procelite.
[1:13:59] You need to be here where the waters are
[1:14:01] warm. You need to do this, you need to
[1:14:02] do that. There's something wrong with
[1:14:04] that picture because we're not supposed
[1:14:06] to be pointing people to a church. We're
[1:14:08] supposed to invite people to church.
[1:14:10] Please do to get them in the presence of
[1:14:12] God. But we're not pointing to a church.
[1:14:15] We're pointing to the lamb Jesus Christ.
[1:14:19] Can I get a greater amen this morning?
[1:14:21] That's what this message is pointing to
[1:14:24] and that's what we should be pointing
[1:14:26] to. Not to a new movement, not to
[1:14:28] another Pentecostal movement, not to an
[1:14:31] intellectual movement. Not to our
[1:14:32] church, not a movement within the
[1:14:34] message. We're not to point to that.
[1:14:36] We're not to be proud about that. No,
[1:14:38] no, we're to be a proud actually. We're
[1:14:40] supposed to be if we're pride, we're
[1:14:42] pride in what our Lord has done before
[1:14:44] us by his grace there. But there's one
[1:14:46] place Tab is much as follows the rest of
[1:14:49] them. But there's one place I can take
[1:14:50] you to where you're safe and pro
[1:14:53] protected from death. That's in Jesus
[1:14:55] Christ, God's place of worship. That's
[1:14:57] the place I'm introducing to you
[1:14:59] tonight. Where God put his name, where
[1:15:02] he promised he would meet every person
[1:15:04] that come in there, he would worship
[1:15:06] with him and feast with him. That's in
[1:15:09] Christ. Not in no church, no tabernacle,
[1:15:13] only in Jesus Christ. How many raise
[1:15:16] your hand say, I want to be in that
[1:15:17] place where I'm fellowshipping an
[1:15:19] intimate relationship with Christ our
[1:15:22] lamb.
[1:15:24] Now, so the end time message is to give
[1:15:27] us an I just want you to step back now
[1:15:29] and look at it. The end time message is,
[1:15:32] you know, there's reasons why I lay that
[1:15:34] foundation. It's because of the uh how
[1:15:37] should I say this? I could say the
[1:15:40] Antichrist spirit, but I won't say that.
[1:15:42] But the the a subtle a subtle work a
[1:15:46] subtle pressure to undermine
[1:15:50] what undermine this message.
[1:15:54] Be careful of it.
[1:15:56] That's why I lay the foundation that the
[1:15:59] end time message don't let somebody
[1:16:01] interpret what it is. It's to give us an
[1:16:03] entrance to a place, a hidden place in
[1:16:07] Jesus Christ. Everything he sent us in
[1:16:10] this message is to bring us into that
[1:16:12] final secret place of his dwelling,
[1:16:16] hidden away in Christ. So much so that
[1:16:20] the devil can't hardly find you. I want
[1:16:24] to be in there. I want to be in there.
[1:16:27] Uh so much so the devil can't find you.
[1:16:29] It looks like a place where it's it's
[1:16:32] you and God alone. There's no crutches.
[1:16:35] There's no dependence on anyone. That's
[1:16:37] why he slams making a church system or a
[1:16:40] church a crutch that you lean on. As
[1:16:42] long as I'm attending church, then am I
[1:16:44] okay? I believe in attending church, but
[1:16:47] we shouldn't attend as a crutch that
[1:16:49] that's what we're depending on to be
[1:16:51] saved or that's what we're depending on
[1:16:53] to go to the rapture. No, it's it's to
[1:16:55] take all the crutches away and to
[1:16:56] realize it's not a dependence on anyone
[1:16:59] else. It's you and God alone. Can you
[1:17:02] say amen? And a place that is not
[1:17:04] exposed to the outside forces. The only
[1:17:07] safe place is in Christ the word. The
[1:17:10] only trusted place is in Christ the
[1:17:13] word. It is to hide us. Look at that
[1:17:15] now. It is to hide us.
[1:17:19] The opposite of hiding.
[1:17:21] The opposite of a hiding place is to be
[1:17:24] in a place that you're too exposed,
[1:17:28] that you're not protected,
[1:17:30] that you're vulnerable.
[1:17:34] that you're intimidated,
[1:17:38] that darts can hit you.
[1:17:41] The opposite of hiding and God hiding
[1:17:43] you is being vulnerable, not protected,
[1:17:45] intimidated. That darts can the opposite
[1:17:48] of hiding with Christ is is being in a
[1:17:51] place of confusion. Who do I believe?
[1:17:53] What do I believe? When you're outside
[1:17:55] that place, then you have those doubts
[1:17:57] all the time because you're vulnerable
[1:17:59] to spirits of doubt.
[1:18:01] There's so many voices out there. What
[1:18:03] do I believe? And we begin to depend on
[1:18:06] things that are seen on the outside.
[1:18:09] But he by hiding us removes the
[1:18:12] dependence on other things and he steals
[1:18:15] away with him alone. As I said, the
[1:18:18] thief in the night steals his bride
[1:18:19] away. But before he steals her, he
[1:18:21] steals her heart. He woos her into a
[1:18:23] deeper relationship with him. Like
[1:18:25] Solomon said to his bride first before
[1:18:28] he brought her into the bed chamber,
[1:18:31] "Come away. Come away." So before
[1:18:33] there's an intimate relationship and
[1:18:36] Solomon, the song of Solomon is a type
[1:18:37] of Christ and his bride. But before he
[1:18:40] brings her into that inner court with
[1:18:42] him, he says, "Come away, my love. Come
[1:18:46] away." There's a wooing to come away.
[1:18:48] Come away from what? Come away from this
[1:18:51] world, from it, from your vulnerability.
[1:18:54] Come away from all the fears. Come away
[1:18:56] from being so affected in your mind and
[1:18:59] in your heart by so many thing and so
[1:19:01] many family situations. Listen, I'm not
[1:19:03] dehumanizing you and saying you're not a
[1:19:05] human being. We can be affected by
[1:19:07] things, but I'm preaching to you a place
[1:19:09] for me and for all of us that we can be
[1:19:11] a in a place that's safe and protected
[1:19:15] from not being so influenced by the
[1:19:16] outside forces. Our Lord, our Lord, our
[1:19:19] precious one is saying, "Come away.
[1:19:22] Should
[1:19:25] I say he's saying come away from the
[1:19:27] busyiness of life
[1:19:30] and commune with me a while.
[1:19:33] Come away from your phone. Come away
[1:19:36] from your busyness.
[1:19:38] Come into a place with me.
[1:19:44] Praise the Lord. Come away,
[1:19:48] my love. Come away. There's no reason
[1:19:51] for you acting so dismay, for I'm coming
[1:19:54] to take my bride away. Come away, little
[1:19:56] one. Come away. He says, "Come away with
[1:19:59] me alone before he catches her away."
[1:20:03] Our provided place,
[1:20:06] our provided place is in Christ by a new
[1:20:10] birth. Now, I want to transition into
[1:20:13] the stark reality that believers don't
[1:20:15] live in that state every day that's
[1:20:19] hidden. It comes by the spirit. It comes
[1:20:22] by a new birth. If you don't have that
[1:20:24] this morning, I would make that your top
[1:20:27] earn earnest prayer before God. Lord,
[1:20:30] fill me with the oil. No one made it
[1:20:33] with the bridegroom without the oil in
[1:20:35] their lamps. Give me that oil, Lord, if
[1:20:37] I'm lacking that oil. Everybody ought to
[1:20:40] say that. Lord, if I'm lacking that oil,
[1:20:42] fill me with that oil. When God bursts
[1:20:44] you into his body by the Holy Spirit,
[1:20:47] then we find, as I take this a step
[1:20:48] further, the stark reality that
[1:20:51] believers themselves, sometimes you have
[1:20:53] the spirit. Don't live in a state every
[1:20:55] day that's a hidden state. They choose
[1:20:58] to live on the outside, Monday through
[1:21:00] Saturday, possibly affected by things
[1:21:03] too much. Can you say amen?
[1:21:07] So way in the early years, the prophet
[1:21:11] begins to see something and he wants an
[1:21:14] answer for it and he finds the answer in
[1:21:17] the Old Testament.
[1:21:19] And he one, you know, there's many
[1:21:21] sermons, the hidden life, the hidden
[1:21:23] life with Christ. I've been listening to
[1:21:24] all of them. Uh but there's one called
[1:21:27] Why are Christians so tossed about? and
[1:21:29] he he's he's wondered about something
[1:21:32] all the years especially maybe being
[1:21:34] around as many powerful meetings as he
[1:21:36] is was around to watch the dead raised
[1:21:39] to watch many cripples healed the lame
[1:21:41] walk the dumb talk just so many things
[1:21:43] of the supernatural going on God was
[1:21:45] doing and then with that of course came
[1:21:48] he was amongst the group of the
[1:21:49] Pentecostals who uh were probably become
[1:21:52] very emotional about that not a thing
[1:21:54] wrong with that but in his eye like
[1:21:57] Solomon's wisdom he looked deeper into
[1:21:59] people's lives. And he was really
[1:22:01] troubled by the fact that people could
[1:22:03] get caught up in the emotion of what was
[1:22:05] going on. And he even said people can
[1:22:07] actually be be healed temporarily and
[1:22:11] then they go back into their sickness
[1:22:13] again. And so he's given examples to
[1:22:15] show why isn't there a stability? Why
[1:22:18] are people coming to camp every year and
[1:22:21] getting all riled up by the emotion of
[1:22:22] camp and then they're coming back to the
[1:22:24] altar again every year to be saved every
[1:22:27] year or to get the Holy Ghost again?
[1:22:32] Why isn't there a consistency? Why isn't
[1:22:34] there a stability? Why are Christians so
[1:22:37] tossed about and they're in one day and
[1:22:40] out the other? They're believing
[1:22:42] completely one day and then they're
[1:22:44] doubting everything the next day. He's
[1:22:46] troubled with this. And so he goes to
[1:22:48] the word asking God for an answer. And
[1:22:50] he found his answer as he began to watch
[1:22:53] all these things. And I could talk a lot
[1:22:55] more about what he expressed if you want
[1:22:57] to go through these sermons hidden life,
[1:22:59] hidden life with Christ. Why are people
[1:23:01] so tossed about? He noticed Christians
[1:23:04] being tossed about from church to
[1:23:06] church, from camp meeting to camp
[1:23:07] meeting, from emotional highs to
[1:23:09] emotional lows, fussing with people all
[1:23:12] the time, fussing with church people,
[1:23:14] worried about what everybody's thinking
[1:23:15] about him, living in fear every day,
[1:23:18] people, Christians living in fear every
[1:23:20] day.
[1:23:22] This was a concern to him. Shouldn't
[1:23:24] there be a a bit more consistency in
[1:23:27] people's lives and not such extremes?
[1:23:32] and and and and living in fear every
[1:23:35] day. I just want to say something about
[1:23:36] that. Do you know that it says in the
[1:23:39] Bible the term do not be afraid?
[1:23:43] This should be encouraging to you. It
[1:23:45] says the phrase do not be afraid 365
[1:23:48] times in the Bible.
[1:23:51] Amen.
[1:23:55] So God supernaturally puts do not be
[1:23:57] afraid in there for every day of our
[1:24:01] lives. And this is a daily thing that
[1:24:04] every day it's not you live in fear for
[1:24:06] three years and all of a sudden you come
[1:24:07] to a temporary victory. We're not
[1:24:10] interested in temporary victories.
[1:24:14] We're interested in consistency and
[1:24:15] fellowship with the Lord all the time.
[1:24:18] 365. How many want to take that? Do not
[1:24:20] be afraid. 365 days a year. This is a
[1:24:23] daily thing and we can live every day
[1:24:25] without fear. Brother and sister, you
[1:24:28] can live every day without fear if
[1:24:30] you're living in this place.
[1:24:32] So, he points us to God gives him the
[1:24:36] answer in the Old Testament tabernacle.
[1:24:38] I'm watching my time. Uh I don't know if
[1:24:40] you are, but I'm watching it. He points
[1:24:43] us to two parts of the Old Testament
[1:24:47] tabernacle. actually three parts of it,
[1:24:50] but two main parts. And he goes into the
[1:24:52] tabernacle. He says, "Isn't it
[1:24:54] interesting that there's uh this Old
[1:24:56] Testament, this is where God dwelt. This
[1:24:58] was God's provided place. This was God's
[1:25:00] provided place to worship. This is where
[1:25:02] the people come to bring their
[1:25:03] sacrifice. It was his place, but was but
[1:25:06] it was divided into three sections.
[1:25:10] And you could worship. Listen now. And
[1:25:12] many of you have heard these things
[1:25:13] before, but actually pretend that you've
[1:25:15] never heard them before.
[1:25:17] You could worship at a certain level in
[1:25:21] all three parts of the tabernacle
[1:25:26] and God was around and you could
[1:25:28] worship. I wonder if you could pull up
[1:25:30] that first picture, the first picture we
[1:25:32] had of it. So you could worship. This is
[1:25:35] how it looked. First of all, this is how
[1:25:36] it looked in the Old Testament with all
[1:25:38] the tents that were around it. This is
[1:25:40] where this was God's provided place to
[1:25:42] worship. And so as you go in, you have
[1:25:44] the outer court. And then as you walk in
[1:25:47] that first tent part, there's a place
[1:25:49] called the the the the um the holy
[1:25:53] place. And then there's another veil
[1:25:55] that is actually the holiest of holies.
[1:25:58] So that's something greater. So he's
[1:26:00] bringing out and God shows them through
[1:26:02] this this Old Testament tabernacle
[1:26:04] because this is the place God dwells yet
[1:26:07] there's three section to it and you can
[1:26:09] worship at a certain level at all
[1:26:11] places. Then he brings out there's seven
[1:26:13] pieces of furniture related to this. And
[1:26:16] all those pieces of furniture are
[1:26:18] related to our worship and our coming to
[1:26:20] God. Seven pieces of furniture. Some are
[1:26:23] outside, some of the holies, some of the
[1:26:25] holiest of holies, but there's seven
[1:26:27] pieces and all of them are symbols. All
[1:26:29] of them are types and they're all
[1:26:32] related to our worship or coming to God.
[1:26:34] This is God's provided place to come and
[1:26:37] worship. So we're coming and we we
[1:26:40] approach him and then God takes us
[1:26:42] deeper and closer to God. Each place you
[1:26:45] move into. Listen now, each place you
[1:26:49] move into in this tabernacle, you become
[1:26:51] more hidden from the elements outside
[1:26:54] and more hidden from Satan and all the
[1:26:57] world and all the pressures. And that's
[1:26:59] true today. The more you come into that
[1:27:02] secret place, the less you're exposed to
[1:27:04] the outside.
[1:27:07] So he's saying, "Lord, this must be the
[1:27:09] answer. These people are Christians, but
[1:27:12] they're not living in that secret place.
[1:27:16] They're fussing with people in the
[1:27:18] church and they're they're still
[1:27:19] gossiping and they're getting caught up.
[1:27:21] You know, it's just as worse to gossip
[1:27:22] as it is to get caught up in gossip."
[1:27:25] And you know, all these people, there's
[1:27:26] such immaturities with them and all
[1:27:28] these other things. And and so he's
[1:27:29] saying the answer must be is that
[1:27:31] they've got to grow deeper. They've got
[1:27:33] to move closer. There's something
[1:27:35] inconsistent. It's instable unstable in
[1:27:37] their life. They got to bring their
[1:27:39] mind, their heart, everything that they
[1:27:41] are. They've got to forget about all
[1:27:42] this stuff and move closer in a deeper
[1:27:45] worship coming deeper and closer to God.
[1:27:48] So there were three parts and he meets
[1:27:50] them here in the outside. Uh go to the
[1:27:52] next one and it's a little bit more
[1:27:53] specific to show what's inside. So this
[1:27:56] first altar here is where the sacrifice
[1:27:58] is and that's when we come to the Lord
[1:28:00] and we acknowledge that his sacrifice
[1:28:03] that he's done something for us at
[1:28:05] Calvary. The lamb was there. They
[1:28:07] brought the lamb with the priest. But
[1:28:09] all the congregation can come. They come
[1:28:11] to that area. They bring the s the
[1:28:13] priest helps them and they bring the
[1:28:15] sacrifice. Then there's that golden
[1:28:16] lather there that has water and they
[1:28:18] wash there. They they they wash the they
[1:28:20] wash themselves. And so that speaks of
[1:28:22] sanctification. God washing your lives.
[1:28:25] So we have steps that are justification,
[1:28:28] sanctification, the baptism of the Holy
[1:28:31] Ghost. But even the prophet points out
[1:28:32] then you have to go deeper even just the
[1:28:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost. You have to
[1:28:36] go deeper than that. Some preachers will
[1:28:38] say you're finished. You're done. You
[1:28:39] get the baptism, you're finished. No,
[1:28:41] you only begin. And you go deeper with
[1:28:44] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. So you
[1:28:46] come to the altar, that's a sacrifice
[1:28:48] for your sin. You accept it. You rejoice
[1:28:51] in it. Uh no doubt when people receive
[1:28:54] that there's a joy. Then they're washed.
[1:28:56] Their life is under justification and
[1:28:59] sanctification. Their life is clean. And
[1:29:01] many people come and enter and worship
[1:29:04] God just to this point. But you're still
[1:29:08] exposed to all the elements.
[1:29:13] The next part you enter is in that tent.
[1:29:16] And inside that next place in that
[1:29:18] curtain is called the holy place. You go
[1:29:21] a little deeper. You worship in there.
[1:29:23] It's more hidden. It's more hidden, but
[1:29:25] it's not completely hidden. You have the
[1:29:27] light of the seven golden candlesticks.
[1:29:29] The table of bread. The uh in other
[1:29:32] words, that represents fellowship. When
[1:29:34] you talk about bread, you talk about
[1:29:35] fellowship. When you talk about the
[1:29:37] seven golden candlesticks to us, you're
[1:29:38] talking about the light that was in each
[1:29:40] age. They're living off of a certain
[1:29:42] light in there of revelation. And so
[1:29:45] then you have in there the altar of
[1:29:47] incense which goes back to you have the
[1:29:49] altar of incense which is incense going
[1:29:51] up is our prayers going up. So I just
[1:29:53] want to in my feeble way of explaining
[1:29:55] it as you move closer to just salvation
[1:29:57] and accepting a sacrifice you move into
[1:30:00] a place past sanctification and you move
[1:30:02] and you start to receive the light of
[1:30:04] the of the truths of the seven gold and
[1:30:06] the seven church ages. You you you break
[1:30:09] bread together. You fellowship. You
[1:30:11] worship. Then you come to this instant.
[1:30:13] You bring your prayers to God. It's all
[1:30:15] worship. But I'm here to tell you that's
[1:30:18] only a certain point you come to in your
[1:30:20] Christian life.
[1:30:22] It's still not completely hidden. We
[1:30:26] can't just serve God because we want him
[1:30:29] to answer our prayers. That's right.
[1:30:33] That's we can't just come to church and
[1:30:36] partake of the bread together and it
[1:30:39] makes us feel good because I'd say when
[1:30:41] someone had that sacrifice of the lamb,
[1:30:43] there was a certain feeling good with
[1:30:45] that. He's accepted my sin. This lamb,
[1:30:47] he accept the lamb for my sin. I'm sure
[1:30:49] when you come into the light, oh, look
[1:30:51] at those. I'm sure when you come, the
[1:30:52] priest comes in and sees you fellowship
[1:30:54] with the showbread. You fellowship
[1:30:56] together. This fellowship is great. I
[1:30:58] love this. My prayers, God answer my
[1:31:00] prayers. All of this is a certain level
[1:31:02] that we're enjoying and God is
[1:31:04] responding.
[1:31:06] But notice it's a fellowship really with
[1:31:10] the other things of God and other
[1:31:11] people, but it's not that intimate
[1:31:13] fellowship with him yet.
[1:31:16] Everybody understand?
[1:31:19] This is why
[1:31:21] people only went so far when they first
[1:31:23] came to the Lord and first came to the
[1:31:25] message. They only go so far. A couple
[1:31:27] weeks ago, I said, "The Holy Spirit's
[1:31:30] really speaking to us about this message
[1:31:32] and your your Bible, go back and read it
[1:31:35] again."
[1:31:38] Because if it didn't take you deeper
[1:31:41] into a deeper walk, go back and read it
[1:31:43] again.
[1:31:45] Don't jump onto some psych psychology.
[1:31:48] Better go back because you're going to
[1:31:49] find, "Oh, I didn't know it said that. I
[1:31:52] didn't know that was in there." And it
[1:31:54] leads you more and more and more to a
[1:31:58] place that you're not got a crutch.
[1:32:00] You're not leaning on.
[1:32:03] Young people lean on their parents' Holy
[1:32:07] Ghost
[1:32:09] for too long.
[1:32:11] You need Christ the savior and Christ
[1:32:16] the a Holy Ghost anointing in your own
[1:32:19] life. You can't
[1:32:22] make it into a rapture on the coattails
[1:32:25] of your parents.
[1:32:28] You can't do it on a pastor. You can't
[1:32:30] do it because I go to Li Life Church.
[1:32:31] You can't do it because you're
[1:32:33] intellectually stirred by all the
[1:32:34] mysteries. Paul said, "I can understand
[1:32:36] all the mysteries and still not have the
[1:32:38] main thing, love."
[1:32:41] We use revelation and mysteries as a
[1:32:43] crutch that I'm in. I'm good. I
[1:32:46] understand these things. I understand
[1:32:47] serpent seed. understand lots of the
[1:32:49] seven seal, but we we can't use anything
[1:32:52] that takes us away from this fellowship
[1:32:56] with him. Amen. This intimacy with him.
[1:33:00] So now in the last place you come to,
[1:33:02] there's not too many pieces of furniture
[1:33:04] there except for the altar that holds
[1:33:06] the word of God in it.
[1:33:09] Uh
[1:33:11] it's deeper in the Holy Holy. It's the
[1:33:13] ark. It has the word inside. It's the
[1:33:15] pot of mana. And we find that the
[1:33:19] brother brand brings out that the mana
[1:33:20] that was outside had to be replaced.
[1:33:22] That table show had to be replaced all
[1:33:24] the time. It went bad. Had to be
[1:33:26] updated. When you put that mana in that
[1:33:28] place in the shakana glory, it never
[1:33:34] got old.
[1:33:39] It didn't have to have a revival every
[1:33:41] year at camp. It never got old. You'll
[1:33:44] see a reference in Revelations about the
[1:33:46] Pergamist church age. He said, "I will
[1:33:48] give you as an overcomer to eat of the
[1:33:51] hidden mana." What does that mean? It's
[1:33:55] the mana that's inside the Holy of
[1:33:57] Holies.
[1:33:59] The mercy seat is there.
[1:34:02] Praise the Lord. The high priest once a
[1:34:05] year sprinkles the blood on the mercy
[1:34:08] seat. I'd be interested in living in a
[1:34:10] place like that. Not just enjoying the
[1:34:12] blessings and shouting and enjoying that
[1:34:14] he saved me, but I'd enjoy being in a
[1:34:16] place where his shakana glory and his
[1:34:18] light, his blood is on the mercy seat,
[1:34:20] that I have his mercy, that I have his
[1:34:23] shakana, his presence, not the light of
[1:34:25] seven golden candlesticks, but the
[1:34:27] actual light of the pillar of fire
[1:34:29] living in there. And then we find
[1:34:31] Aaron's rod was in there, which was
[1:34:33] constantly budding on its own by the
[1:34:35] power of God. Aaron's rod was budding. I
[1:34:38] want my life to bud.
[1:34:44] I want to eat of the hidden mana that
[1:34:45] doesn't get old.
[1:34:48] I want to live in his presence that way
[1:34:49] every day. Can you say amen? I want to
[1:34:52] be that close to the mercy seat.
[1:34:58] Praise the Lord.
[1:35:03] And so each place
[1:35:07] was deeper. You believers that's been
[1:35:10] around for quite a while, you've heard
[1:35:11] these things many, many times before.
[1:35:15] But you see now, there's many here that
[1:35:19] haven't heard them at all yet.
[1:35:22] And this is the provided place in the
[1:35:24] Old Testament
[1:35:26] pointing to Jesus Christ. And when Jesus
[1:35:29] Christ left, your tabernacle became the
[1:35:32] dwelling place for the Lord.
[1:35:36] And like that has three parts.
[1:35:39] Your tabernacle has three parts. You
[1:35:42] have a body, you have a spirit, you have
[1:35:44] a mind, and you have a soul.
[1:35:48] My dad used to preach a message, third
[1:35:51] realm thinking and third realm living.
[1:35:53] He said, "Are we living from the third
[1:35:55] realm or are we living from the flesh or
[1:35:58] just our emotions?
[1:36:00] I want to live from the inside of the
[1:36:03] inside.
[1:36:05] I want to live from the inward man. I
[1:36:08] want to live every day, not just the
[1:36:09] church. I want to live from that inner
[1:36:11] part, that inner man." Can you say amen?
[1:36:13] I want to be living in that holy place
[1:36:15] with him every day where I'm unaffected,
[1:36:18] not as affected I should say, by the
[1:36:20] things that are on the outside. Can you
[1:36:22] say amen? I want to be in that kind of
[1:36:25] fellowship with him. The New Testament
[1:36:29] place in Christ. And you know, I could
[1:36:30] go on with your tabernacle being three.
[1:36:33] You know, I could go on and say people
[1:36:35] can get a feeling in a camp meeting. And
[1:36:37] I I love the feeling. I think I danced
[1:36:39] here a couple weeks ago. I love the
[1:36:41] feeling that knowing the presence of God
[1:36:43] is near. If I feel like dancing, I'm
[1:36:45] going to dance. If I feel like
[1:36:47] worshiping, I'm going to worship. But
[1:36:48] one thing I've learned in my Christian
[1:36:50] walk, something can make you feel good,
[1:36:53] but it doesn't necessarily mean it's
[1:36:55] strong enough to meet the devil on
[1:36:56] Monday morning.
[1:36:59] And so I can worship that way, but my
[1:37:02] worship has to go deeper than just a
[1:37:05] feeling.
[1:37:06] And then you go to your mind and your
[1:37:08] spirit. You know, your spirit can be
[1:37:10] refreshed just by being at church.
[1:37:14] Saul had a demon and spirit on him. And
[1:37:16] Saul was refreshed by the right kind of
[1:37:19] music anointed by David. David would
[1:37:21] play. The anointed would come and it
[1:37:23] would drive away the evil spirits from
[1:37:26] Saul who was under rebellion.
[1:37:29] And he felt good
[1:37:31] temporarily.
[1:37:34] That's a lot of believers coming to
[1:37:36] church sometimes where it made, oh, I
[1:37:38] feel good today. That just made me and
[1:37:40] it stimulated my mind. There was such
[1:37:42] revelation there. Listen, I'm not here
[1:37:44] to stimulate your mind. I'm not here
[1:37:46] just to make you feel better. I don't
[1:37:48] believe the Lord is here just to do
[1:37:50] that. He's looking for relationship.
[1:37:52] He's looking for you to live on Monday,
[1:37:54] Tuesday, and Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
[1:37:55] from the inside of the inside. He wants
[1:37:58] you to go deeper. Can you say amen? And
[1:38:01] so you you you can worship on the
[1:38:03] outside. You can your mind. And I'm not
[1:38:05] knocking you. I'm just saying I know
[1:38:07] some believers. I know my Christian walk
[1:38:09] that I've been touched by the feeling of
[1:38:11] the Lord. That my mind has been
[1:38:13] stimulated by certain preachers. Oh,
[1:38:15] that's good revelation. I really enjoy
[1:38:17] that. But I want to get the consistent
[1:38:19] thing and fellowship in my life. When
[1:38:22] that feeling goes away, there's a
[1:38:24] consistent worship before the Lord this
[1:38:27] morning. Lord, it's Monday morning. I
[1:38:29] don't feel very much, but you know what?
[1:38:31] I'm going to raise my hands and worship
[1:38:33] my God.
[1:38:35] I don't need church to do that. I love
[1:38:37] you, Lord, and I'm going to let you know
[1:38:39] how much I love you today. Can somebody
[1:38:41] give me an amen this way? On Thursday,
[1:38:43] when the bills, you can't pay the bills,
[1:38:45] you know what I'm going to do? I'm going
[1:38:46] to lift my hands because it's another
[1:38:49] day to thank God. Amen. I've been
[1:38:52] through hell, it seems like. But Lord,
[1:38:54] and I feel like I'm living in hell
[1:38:56] sometimes, but God, even in hell, David
[1:38:59] said you he you were there. Can you say
[1:39:02] amen? Even in hell, even if I'm feeling
[1:39:04] a certain way, you're there with me. and
[1:39:07] I'm going to grab a hold of your arm and
[1:39:09] I'm going to have you pull me out of
[1:39:10] this.
[1:39:12] My attention is toward you even in the
[1:39:15] bad days.
[1:39:17] Praise be to God. The voice of God will
[1:39:21] always draw us higher, will always draw
[1:39:24] us deeper.
[1:39:26] I'm not quite done yet. If it's okay.
[1:39:30] We are the tabernacle. Body, soul, and
[1:39:32] spirit. Where are you worshiping from
[1:39:34] this morning? Boy, this feels good. This
[1:39:36] is a good service. Boy, my mind
[1:39:38] stimulated. Your spirit's refreshed.
[1:39:40] Maybe like Saul's spirit was refreshed,
[1:39:42] but it was only temporarily.
[1:39:44] And we think it's okay, but it doesn't
[1:39:46] last. I'm ready for God to do more in me
[1:39:49] to get in there. Listen, friends, I'm 59
[1:39:52] years old. I'm still
[1:39:55] hungry. I'm still hungry.
[1:39:58] this place. I know what it feels like to
[1:40:01] live from there, but I am so hungry to
[1:40:04] be in there every day.
[1:40:08] I've been baptized in there by the Holy
[1:40:09] Ghost, but I'm more hungry. I'm still
[1:40:13] letting God weed this garden.
[1:40:17] I'm a gardener and I'm still letting
[1:40:19] them weed. I'm 59 and I'm never, you
[1:40:21] know, I was walking on the road in my
[1:40:23] driveway yesterday and my neighbor, she
[1:40:26] was down on her knees. She had a bucket
[1:40:29] and she's out there weeding. She really
[1:40:32] shouldn't be. She's on diialysis three
[1:40:34] times a day and probably if I called
[1:40:36] Probably if I called her son, he'd be
[1:40:38] upset at her. But I just let and she's
[1:40:40] there and she's crouched over and I
[1:40:42] think she's not doing well. So I come
[1:40:44] over. Can I help you? Are you okay? She
[1:40:46] reaches up. She's just all tired and
[1:40:48] she's out there. She's got a whole
[1:40:50] flower garden and she weeded that whole
[1:40:52] thing and she said, I feel better now. I
[1:40:56] said, "Are you all right? Do you need me
[1:40:57] to help you? Can I help you? She's What
[1:40:59] if she 90some years old and she's still
[1:41:02] weeding her garden?
[1:41:05] I got a sermon from it.
[1:41:09] We never get too old for God to weed our
[1:41:13] gardens
[1:41:15] because we still get weeds. How many
[1:41:17] still gets weed in their garden? I don't
[1:41:18] know what it is. The millennium, I
[1:41:20] guess, will bring us a garden without
[1:41:22] weeds, but we still get weeds. And in
[1:41:24] our Christian walk, we still get weeds.
[1:41:27] We still get crab grass.
[1:41:30] That's why we get crabby.
[1:41:34] The root of bitterness
[1:41:36] sparks up like Paul talked about. God
[1:41:38] wants to just jerk that root of
[1:41:40] bitterness completely out of us. Make us
[1:41:43] happy again. Make us free again. I said
[1:41:45] to her, I said, "Sis, she's a she's a
[1:41:48] wonderful Christian lady and just very,"
[1:41:50] and she just raised her hand. said,
[1:41:52] "Praise God, he gives me strength." I
[1:41:54] was just so blessed by her. I said, "Can
[1:41:56] I help you?" She says, "No, I'm in a
[1:41:57] minute." She had her walker in a minute.
[1:41:59] I'm headed over there. It was a good, I
[1:42:01] don't know,
[1:42:03] 90 yards or something. I'm headed over
[1:42:05] there to do that part. I said, "Are you
[1:42:06] sure you want to go to that part?" She
[1:42:07] said, "I I want to get this done. I want
[1:42:09] to get it all weeded." And I'm telling
[1:42:10] you friends, I'm 59 years old. I got a
[1:42:13] sermon out of it. And I said to the
[1:42:14] Lord, I never want you to stop weeding
[1:42:17] my life.
[1:42:20] I want this holy place more than I want
[1:42:23] my name on any flyer or more that I want
[1:42:26] the church to grow or get. I don't care
[1:42:28] about any of that. I want to find that
[1:42:31] place and live in there. And I want
[1:42:32] every one of you to find it and live in
[1:42:35] that place. This this is this trumps
[1:42:39] every other thing that you've been
[1:42:41] through in this message. Every
[1:42:42] revelation points to one thing. this
[1:42:46] secret place with Jesus Christ. You know
[1:42:49] how I feel about it. He said a couple
[1:42:52] places.
[1:42:55] Look what he said here in the hidden
[1:42:57] life. I have three more quotes. Okay.
[1:43:01] Appreciate your graciousness.
[1:43:04] Ministers of the gospel, the reason I'm
[1:43:06] read I'm reading this for me. Ministers
[1:43:07] of the gospel, don't care about your
[1:43:10] denominations or what the world thinks,
[1:43:12] but seek to enter into that hidden mana
[1:43:15] where the every I hope every minister's
[1:43:17] listening here. Seek to enter into that
[1:43:20] hidden manner where the full revelation
[1:43:21] of God is making love perfect in your
[1:43:24] heart and you and God and everything
[1:43:26] else is at rest. Let everything come
[1:43:30] what may. You're hidden away. What a
[1:43:32] place to live. Oh, just let me abide
[1:43:36] there. That's for ministers. Can you say
[1:43:38] amen? Is there more to it? Just let me
[1:43:40] abide there. Yes. And the song said,
[1:43:43] "Let me rest neath the tree where the so
[1:43:45] freely flows where the water so freely
[1:43:47] flows, where the lamb is the light and
[1:43:48] the soul of the saved never die." Amen.
[1:43:51] Smith Wigglesworth said this, and this
[1:43:53] is for us ministers as well. Smith
[1:43:56] ministers and anybody who serves, so
[1:43:58] many people want to do great things.
[1:44:00] This was on a pastor's uh telegram that
[1:44:02] I'm a part of. So many people want to do
[1:44:04] great things and to be seen doing them.
[1:44:07] But the one that God will use is the one
[1:44:10] that is willing to be hidden.
[1:44:14] I love that.
[1:44:17] I love that.
[1:44:21] The last one he says on hiding hidden
[1:44:23] life. Sure they ain't man out there but
[1:44:26] didn't know about this. They'd never
[1:44:29] been in there. Have you my dear brother?
[1:44:32] Don't despise my ignorance, but I want
[1:44:34] to ask you something. Have you ever come
[1:44:35] to a place in life where Christ meant
[1:44:39] more to you than all the arguing you
[1:44:41] could do about your church?
[1:44:44] Has Christ meant more to you than all
[1:44:46] the world?
[1:44:48] I don't mean from an emotion or mental
[1:44:50] workup. I mean from the depths of your
[1:44:53] heart that something's settled in there
[1:44:56] that something's taken place that you
[1:44:58] don't know how it come but you're hid
[1:45:01] away and your whole motive is to serve
[1:45:04] Jesus Christ. Have you entered that
[1:45:07] place my dear brother? Have you come
[1:45:08] into that place where you don't care
[1:45:10] what anyone says? Not to go out and act
[1:45:13] smart now. That's that's not what he
[1:45:14] means. But till the love of God is so
[1:45:17] anchored into you that you can't see
[1:45:19] nothing else. Your whole motive is to do
[1:45:22] the will of God. Love for everybody.
[1:45:25] Flowing free from everywhere. What a
[1:45:27] place to live. That's the hidden place.
[1:45:31] That's the place where we got to come
[1:45:33] to, my brethren. That's the place where
[1:45:35] God reveals his secret things. That's
[1:45:40] the place where God does the placing and
[1:45:43] the calling.
[1:45:46] Hallelujah.
[1:45:48] You are
[1:45:51] my hiding place.
[1:45:55] You always
[1:45:57] fill my heart with songs
[1:46:02] of deliverance.
[1:46:07] Whenever I am afraid,
[1:46:12] I will trust in you.
[1:46:16] [Music]
[1:46:18] I will trust in you.
[1:46:24] Let the weak say I
[1:46:29] am strong
[1:46:36] of the Lord. You are my hiding place.
[1:46:40] Just softly now. You are
[1:46:48] Yes, Jesus,
[1:46:50] you are.
[1:46:53] Let's stand together if you would stand
[1:46:55] together
[1:46:59] of
[1:47:01] deliverance.
[1:47:04] Whenever I am afraid,
[1:47:10] I will trust in you.
[1:47:17] I will trust
[1:47:20] in you.
[1:47:22] Thank you Lord
[1:47:25] that the we God
[1:47:29] [Music]
[1:47:31] and strong
[1:47:34] in the strength
[1:47:38] of the Lord. I just love that. Sing it
[1:47:42] one more time.
[1:47:45] You are
[1:47:47] my
[1:47:51] [Music]
[1:47:53] You
[1:47:56] f
[1:47:57] my heart
[1:47:59] with song
[1:48:01] of
[1:48:03] deliverance.
[1:48:06] [Music]
[1:48:08] Never
[1:48:10] am
[1:48:13] I. I will trust in you.
[1:48:20] I will trust
[1:48:23] in you.
[1:48:26] [Music]
[1:48:30] Say I
[1:48:35] am and strong
[1:48:36] [Music]
[1:48:38] in the strength
[1:48:42] of the Lord.
[1:48:45] Just bow your heads and pray with me
[1:48:47] this morning.
[1:48:49] Say just play it softly.
[1:48:53] We meditate on the things that's been
[1:48:55] said.
[1:49:02] My precious Lord, I pray that these
[1:49:04] words would be more under your
[1:49:06] anointing, Lord, than just words that be
[1:49:08] anointed.
[1:49:11] And they would anoint the faith of your
[1:49:13] people
[1:49:14] to see the final end, the final phase,
[1:49:17] the final
[1:49:19] place.
[1:49:20] And David could only speak of it. David
[1:49:22] could only desire it. And yet, Lord, he
[1:49:25] so passionately desired to live there
[1:49:28] every day. And the very thing that he
[1:49:30] desired so passionately is the very
[1:49:33] place that we have access to that we've
[1:49:36] been baptized into.
[1:49:39] Lord, how we still fall so short and we
[1:49:42] let too many people and too many things,
[1:49:45] too many worries and fears overwhelm us,
[1:49:48] Lord.
[1:49:49] Lord, that place is a place of resting.
[1:49:51] We rest in you. You're in control.
[1:49:54] You'll take care of it, Lord. Even our
[1:49:57] sin and our mistakes, God. We have a
[1:49:59] place to bring them this morning. And I
[1:50:01] trust every person would bring their sin
[1:50:04] and bring their life holy to you finally
[1:50:07] and say, "God, I'm all yours. My heart
[1:50:10] is all yours. I hold nothing back from
[1:50:14] you, Father.
[1:50:16] Take me, Lord, as this man, Lord, who's
[1:50:20] been privileged to look at these things
[1:50:23] all these years and preach them, Lord.
[1:50:26] And it's a privilege. Thank you, Lord,
[1:50:28] for giving me the privilege to speak to
[1:50:30] your people all these years, but God, I
[1:50:33] don't want to just preach it. I I want
[1:50:36] this mountain. I want this place. I want
[1:50:39] this hidden life deeper than I've ever
[1:50:41] had it before. I want to live there,
[1:50:43] Lord. Where brother Brandham said,
[1:50:44] Jesus, you were a mystic to the world.
[1:50:47] Doesn't mean you were strange, but yet,
[1:50:49] Lord, you were just so closed in with
[1:50:52] the will of the father. Oh, God, could
[1:50:54] you please just let me, Father? Hide me.
[1:50:58] Hide me in that place. Hide me, Lord.
[1:51:01] Take me, Lord. Woo me into that. Say,
[1:51:04] "Come away, my little one. Come away, my
[1:51:06] bride. Come away from your busyness.
[1:51:09] Come away from your heartaches. Come
[1:51:11] away from your past and the scares and
[1:51:14] the devil running after you. Run into my
[1:51:16] presence. Run into that secret protected
[1:51:19] place. Ran at my Lord for every
[1:51:22] individual I pray under the sound of our
[1:51:25] voice. We look to you, Father. May that
[1:51:29] shana glory shine so brightly upon our
[1:51:33] souls and upon our lives today. Lord, we
[1:51:36] would leave her with more than a
[1:51:37] feeling, but something
[1:51:40] something of a deeper desire.
[1:51:43] Take us deeper, Lord.
[1:51:46] Take us deeper, we pray. Break every
[1:51:49] stronghold of the enemy. Break every
[1:51:50] sickness, every cancer, every disease,
[1:51:53] every headache, every pain in the name
[1:51:56] of the Lord Jesus Christ. Every
[1:51:59] emotional, mental instability.
[1:52:02] Break the power of the enemy. Let there
[1:52:04] be peace. Come, I pray to your people.
[1:52:07] Satan, take your hands off of God's
[1:52:09] property.
[1:52:11] Let them be free in Jesus Christ.
[1:52:14] Grant it, Father. Grant it, my Lord,
[1:52:19] as we put our trust in you. Thank you,
[1:52:22] Jesus.
[1:52:25] You are my hiding
[1:52:28] place. Yes, you are.
[1:52:32] You always
[1:52:34] fear
[1:52:39] songs
[1:52:40] of
[1:52:42] deliverance
[1:52:45] whenever
[1:52:49] [Music]
[1:52:51] I will trust.
[1:52:54] [Music]
[1:52:57] Wonderful Jesus,

[1:53:01] you father.

[1:53:12] am strong
[1:53:16] strength.

[1:53:20] Oh let's sing order my steps in your
[1:53:23] word. Let's sing that together. Worship
[1:53:25] the Lord this morning. I think we might
[1:53:27] have just one testimony in a minute, but
[1:53:30] just let's how many believe the Lord is
[1:53:31] here present with us.
[1:53:34] Order my steps in your word, dear Lord,
[1:53:40] lead me and guide me every day. Oh, send
[1:53:48] your anointing.
[1:53:51] Father, I pray
[1:53:54] order my steps through your word.
[1:54:00] Please
[1:54:01] order my steps.
[1:54:05] Order my steps.
[1:54:08] Order my steps.
[1:54:11] You're worthy,
[1:54:13] Lord. It's my desire, Lord.
[1:54:18] every day.
[1:54:20] Not just on Sundays, every day. Send
[1:54:24] your anointing.
[1:54:26] Father, I pray
[1:54:29] for myself.
[1:54:34] Hallelujah. Please
[1:54:39] your word. Come on, sing it. I want you.
[1:54:47] Oh yes, Lord.
[1:54:52] [Applause]

[1:56:47] with all those sisters. Sing that again
[1:56:49] as you send us away today. We'll go away
[1:56:52] with that song again. I know I'm keeping
[1:56:54] you a long time this morning. I know
[1:56:56] they turned my mic off, but I know I'm
[1:56:58] keeping you a long time.
[1:57:00] Where did you have to go? What's so
[1:57:02] important? Where did you have to go?
[1:57:04] Amen. Say, "Well, I'm hungry." Well, I
[1:57:06] am, too. But hey, this is better. This
[1:57:09] is better. Praise the Lord. Bless us
[1:57:10] ladies again. I'm a sinner. Grace is
[1:57:14] still healing.
[1:57:17] I'm a story. Time is revealing.
[1:57:23] I'm all of these things. Mostly I'm
[1:57:27] thankful.
[1:57:30] Amen. So thankful.
[1:57:33] I'm a fighter caught in the struggle.
[1:57:38] a survivor by his grace rising above us.

[2:03:58] today, shake one another's hands and
[2:04:00] Christian love. I want to sing as we go.
[2:04:03] Where do I go when there's no one else
[2:04:05] to turn to? I go to the rock of my
[2:04:07] salvation. God bless you all in
[2:04:10] Christian love today. And we look
[2:04:11] forward to fellowshipping together
[2:04:13] again. You love the Lord. Come on,
[2:04:16] Gideon. Send this. God bless you all.

[2:04:19] we go. Where do I go
[2:04:23] when there's no one else to turn to? Who
[2:04:27] do I talk to?
[2:04:31] When there's no one left to listen to
[2:04:39] when there's no foundation
[2:04:42] to rock. I know that he's able to ride.
[2:04:47] Where do I go? Where do I go
