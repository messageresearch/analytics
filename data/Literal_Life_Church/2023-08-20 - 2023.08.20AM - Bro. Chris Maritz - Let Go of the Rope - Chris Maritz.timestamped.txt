[0:23] we've just been really blessed to be in
[0:24] your midst and trust this morning that
[0:27] the Lord will bless us in his presence
[0:29] here and just ask that he would look
[0:31] beyond the the frail Veil that is

[0:36] if we have faith in him and we approach
[0:39] him with that attitude amen coming with
[0:41] an expecting Heart To A man that God
[0:43] will speak and it's I think it's so
[0:46] profound the song that our brother Paul

[1:09] core

[1:12] sermons we want something that that
[1:15] refines us that draws us closer to the
[1:18] Lord that we want the real thing we

[1:22] joyful and surface level religion we
[1:25] want the real deal

[1:30] manifest in our lives we want to know
[1:32] him in his in the realities of God Amen
[1:35] I don't want to just live a mediocre
[1:37] life I want to I want to live a life

[1:42] understanding him and and having the
[1:44] power to overcome the challenges that we
[1:46] Face amen so this morning will be a real
[1:49] challenge to us so it asks we just be
[1:52] really attentive I'm going to go through
[1:53] a lot of scriptures and a lot of quotes
[1:55] because I want to give you a real solid
[1:57] background for the angle that we're
[1:59] going to be bringing the sermon from
[2:01] today and then that way you'll have all
[2:03] the quotes and the scriptures you can go
[2:05] read later amen so we're just going to
[2:08] give the service to the Lord just now if
[2:10] you have a need today I'd ask you would
[2:12] just bow with me and we're just going to
[2:14] present our needs we're going to present
[2:16] our desires
[2:17] and his word to him now that he would
[2:19] come and he would break bread with us
[2:21] amen
[2:23] our precious Heavenly Father Lord we
[2:25] come to you in this awesome presence
[2:28] Lord that we know so well
[2:30] Lord and it bring such a calm and arrest
[2:32] to us Lord when we come into your
[2:34] presence knowing that you know us better
[2:36] than we know ourselves Lord that you
[2:38] know your word Lord you know the the
[2:40] intent wherewith you had it written with
[2:43] Lord you had you had a desired effect
[2:46] that you would like to see it have in
[2:47] our lives and today we want to just lay
[2:50] before you we open our hearts to you our
[2:53] minds to you Lord that your word would
[2:55] have its desired effect Lord that it
[2:57] would bring forth fruit that is pleasing
[2:59] to you we ask for for understanding we
[3:02] ask for for power we ask for your grace
[3:05] this morning Lord wash us and By the
[3:08] Waters of your word today and draw us
[3:10] closer to you and make us stronger Lord
[3:12] so that we can face the challenges that
[3:14] we face as we know God that the devil is
[3:17] out there and he's he knows his time is
[3:20] short he knows that he's just got a few
[3:22] days months if it even be that Lord and
[3:26] so he is roaring like a lion
[3:29] but Lord you raise the spirit up within
[3:31] us and so this morning we want to look
[3:33] to those things and be encouraged in
[3:35] your word that you would strengthen us
[3:37] and gird us up father in your word
[3:39] we love you we appreciate you Lord and
[3:42] we present our needs to you this morning
[3:44] and just asking you would have your
[3:46] Divine will and way with us this morning
[3:48] in Jesus Christ's name amen amen we're
[3:51] going to turn in our Bibles to the book
[3:52] of Deuteronomy 7.
[3:54] Deuteronomy 7
[3:56] verse 7.
[3:58] I've been preaching this uh series at
[4:01] home called The Covenant of Grace how
[4:02] that God when he makes a covenant with
[4:05] his people he's the one that brings that
[4:07] Covenant to pass you know we it's not a
[4:09] whole lot we can do we see how many
[4:11] times Israel failed and and fell and
[4:14] made mistakes and things so God is the
[4:16] one that keeps the Covenant and I'm so
[4:18] thankful for that that we are also under
[4:20] a Covenant of Grace it's nothing we did
[4:22] but what God did for us and so God made
[4:26] a promise to you and I God made a
[4:28] covenant between you and I and he's the
[4:30] keeper of that Covenant and he and he
[4:32] and and so we understand that the
[4:34] Covenant that God makes is a Covenant of
[4:37] Grace between you and I and so we're
[4:39] going to lay a little bit of a
[4:40] foundation here this morning before we
[4:42] get into letting go of the Rope what
[4:45] does this mean this Covenant that we're
[4:46] under the promise God has made to you
[4:48] and I and then we're going to look at
[4:50] letting go of the road Deuteronomy 7 and
[4:53] 7 says that the Lord did not
[4:56] set his love upon you nor choose you
[5:00] because you were more in number than any
[5:02] people for you were the fewest of all
[5:04] people so he's going to describe to us
[5:06] now why he has set his love upon you
[5:10] right did you want to know this morning
[5:12] why does he set his affections your way
[5:15] why does God love me why does God take
[5:17] care of me why is this Covenant a
[5:19] Covenant of Grace he says but because
[5:22] the Lord loved you
[5:24] so not because of your numbers not
[5:27] because of your great Cathedrals and
[5:28] churches and because of your efforts
[5:31] this is not why he he loves you he loves
[5:33] you because he chose to love you
[5:36] because the Lord loved you and because
[5:39] he would keep the oath
[5:41] which he had sworn unto your fathers
[5:43] which the Lord brought you out of with a
[5:45] mighty hand and redeemed you out of the
[5:48] house of bond men from the hand of
[5:50] pharaoh King Egypt he says no therefore
[5:52] that the Lord thy God he is God the
[5:55] faithful God which keepeth Covenant and
[5:58] mercy with them that love him and keep
[6:01] his Commandments to a thousand
[6:03] Generations I think that covers us today
[6:06] God is the keeper of his Covenant and
[6:09] it's a covenant of Mercy
[6:11] Hallelujah
[6:13] amen you may have receipts this morning
[6:16] because the Lord loved you he would keep
[6:18] the oath he's The Keeper of the Covenant
[6:21] he's the one that guards it he's the one
[6:22] that ensures that he's the one that
[6:24] guarantees it amen and we we sit under a
[6:28] covenant we sit under a promise this
[6:30] morning of mercy and Grace because of
[6:34] his love towards you see it's not
[6:37] because of our efforts towards him it's
[6:39] because he first chose to love us
[6:41] Prophet says in in the message the
[6:44] message message of Grace amen that's a
[6:45] good message to go to go and listen to
[6:48] and anybody that's willing to repent the
[6:51] grace of God still goes for you
[6:54] the grace of God is searching for you so
[6:57] that goes for your backsliders this
[6:59] morning the grace of God is still
[7:01] looking for you if you'll just repent
[7:03] God's grace is sufficient no he's not
[7:06] looking at your Deeds he's not looking
[7:08] at your behavior he's not looking at
[7:10] what you can bring to the table he's
[7:12] looking at what he has done for you his
[7:15] grace is sufficient it doesn't matter
[7:18] how far you may have slipped it doesn't
[7:21] matter if you have backslid in my brown
[7:23] sister if you turned to him this morning
[7:24] his grace is sufficient because the
[7:27] Covenant that he made for you he shed
[7:29] with his own blood amen and it covers
[7:31] all your sins it washes you makes you
[7:33] white as snow and the prophet told us
[7:35] that all he sees is his blood covering
[7:38] you so you have a right to approach him
[7:40] this morning and say Lord I need that
[7:43] Covenant this morning I need to come
[7:44] under the banner of your grace and love
[7:46] this morning you have a right to do that
[7:48] because his Governor his Covenant is
[7:51] enforced by grace
[7:54] Hallelujah
[7:56] he says he took good old Abraham and he
[7:59] brought him back and remember Abraham
[8:01] was not saved by his Works he was saved
[8:04] by grace Abraham was saved by faith
[8:06] which it was Grace and God saved Abraham
[8:08] because of his grace not because of his
[8:11] behavior he saved him because of his
[8:13] grace oh how good he was saved by grace
[8:16] we know the the times that Abraham would
[8:18] even lie any any and and the little
[8:21] mistakes he would make and the little
[8:22] bit of unfaith maybe he would he would
[8:25] show you know and these little things
[8:26] but God wasn't looking at that go read
[8:28] the book of Hebrews 11 and you'll find
[8:30] that the only thing that was recorded is
[8:32] the faith that Abraham had and how he
[8:34] staggered not at the promises of God
[8:36] hallelujah that's God's Covenant of
[8:39] Grace this is God's attitude towards you
[8:41] this is what he sees when he looks at
[8:43] you this morning
[8:45] he said I will bring you to a good land
[8:47] I will take care of you I will feed you
[8:50] I will lead you it's all on him this
[8:52] morning and we can go and rest in God
[8:54] because of the Covenant he made God
[8:56] making a covenant that he will enforce
[8:59] by Grace because he knew we would make
[9:02] mistakes he knew we would make a big
[9:04] mess out of it all
[9:06] amen
[9:07] it's going to take Grace because we make
[9:09] mistakes and we mess things up just look
[9:12] at Israel for an example this morning
[9:15] yesterday we we covered this quote
[9:17] talking to the couples and uh just just
[9:21] looking at what it takes to keep a
[9:23] family together and it takes the same
[9:25] thing to keep a church together and to
[9:27] keep a relationship together and and our
[9:29] and our relationship with the Lord it
[9:31] takes Grace to keep the family just in
[9:33] the yellow there it says but then think
[9:34] what if that woman would turn wrong and
[9:37] lives lazy and won't work and won't do
[9:39] nothing then it takes Grace to keep that
[9:41] family together see we're so quick to
[9:43] judge you know and I feel like sometimes
[9:46] in the message we feel like because we
[9:48] know everything and because we we act
[9:50] like we know everything anyway you know
[9:52] then what happens is we tend to judge so
[9:55] quickly somebody doesn't have just the
[9:57] right length skirt on or or acts a
[9:59] certain way we're so quick to isolate
[10:01] and categorize not not remembering that
[10:04] you were saved by the same Grace that is
[10:06] saving that person and all God sees is
[10:08] his love for that individual don't
[10:11] overstep the love of God and the
[10:13] Covenant he has made with another person
[10:15] remember how brother Brandon was judging
[10:17] that little that couple there in the in
[10:19] their Cafe and and the policeman and
[10:21] that woman that was there and he judged
[10:23] them and then God said but have you not
[10:26] noticed the grace wherewith I loved you
[10:28] with
[10:29] right it's the same Grace that was given
[10:31] to that couple how dare you how dare you
[10:33] judge somebody else if you are a
[10:36] Christian my brother says that's why I
[10:37] say we're going to be challenged this
[10:39] morning we if we call ourselves
[10:40] Christians how dare we judge how dare we
[10:44] hold grudges how dare we do those things
[10:46] to one another
[10:48] we are message Believers what does that
[10:51] mean to be a message believer
[10:54] huh
[10:56] we can be so dogmatic we can be so you
[10:59] know full of our our intellectual uh you
[11:02] know quotes and and things but do we
[11:04] really understand what it means to be
[11:06] called a message believer this whole
[11:08] thing is a love relationship between a
[11:10] husband and and his bride this whole
[11:13] thing is because of love it's because of
[11:15] Grace this whole thing is God showing to
[11:18] you that I've chosen you because of my
[11:20] love towards you so us as message
[11:22] Believers that is our message to The
[11:24] World God loves you and he and he died
[11:27] for your sins and that you can also be
[11:29] part of this wonderful Grace Covenant
[11:33] that's our message to the world
[11:38] God fed them and took care of them why
[11:40] because he looks after his Covenant
[11:42] I'm so thankful for that this morning it
[11:45] says so regardless of what the church is
[11:48] sorry it takes Grace for Jehovah to keep
[11:51] his family together and then it says so
[11:52] regardless of what the church is how
[11:55] wrong you've been what difference does
[11:58] that make it's how right you can be now
[12:02] oh my this morning let's just let's just
[12:04] reset huh let's just reset everything
[12:07] all the mistakes we've made we can bring
[12:08] it to the altar this morning and he said
[12:10] you can cast your cares upon Him you can
[12:12] lay your burdens down at the altar this
[12:14] morning and he can just say it's over
[12:16] I'm done with those things I want to do
[12:18] right from now on
[12:20] God's Grace has showed it to you then
[12:23] walk in it it's God's grace
[12:26] see he does both things he is the one
[12:29] that loved you and he is the one that
[12:32] chooses you
[12:33] he loved you and he chose you not
[12:36] because you were more in number
[12:38] not because you are something you know
[12:41] extraordinary firm another church or
[12:43] because you know we we do things a
[12:45] certain way it's because he loved you
[12:48] and he chose you praise the Lord
[12:52] not because of anything we did we so
[12:55] quickly categorize you know and and
[12:58] fixate little schemes and plans and and
[13:01] we caused divisions amongst churches and
[13:03] families all because we have this little
[13:05] idea or this little Doctrine or this
[13:08] little we're going to be so careful with
[13:09] that my brother and sister that is not
[13:11] what this message has come to do
[13:13] that's not right it's not appropriate
[13:15] when we consider the Covenant of Grace
[13:18] wherewith he has come with to us with
[13:23] Ephesians 1 4 says according as he hath
[13:25] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[13:27] of the world that we should be holy and
[13:30] Without Blame before him in love
[13:33] we wouldn't want to overstep that
[13:37] God chose us it was God's election it's
[13:41] God's choosing
[13:43] the Covenant would reveal something
[13:45] about God it reveals something about his
[13:48] heart and his attitude towards his
[13:50] people
[13:52] it's God's choice the next time you want
[13:54] to judge somebody just remember God
[13:56] chose them the same way he chose you
[14:00] and he loved them before they gave her
[14:02] made that mistake
[14:04] before they ever had that little thing
[14:06] God loved them
[14:09] well just look at Jacob if you don't
[14:10] believe me this morning remember he said
[14:12] that Jacob have I loved and he saw have
[14:16] I hated God chose before they were even
[14:18] born that he would love Jacob why
[14:21] because God had a plan God had a purpose
[14:23] for Jacob and he knew that Jacob would
[14:26] mess up he knew that he would be a
[14:27] little shyster but he made him a certain
[14:29] way why because he knew he would have a
[14:31] heart he would have a love for the
[14:33] birthright and he had a plan for Jacob's
[14:36] life that he would one day become Israel
[14:38] and he would become a prince with God he
[14:41] wasn't looking at all the mistakes he
[14:42] would make he was he he chose him
[14:44] because he loved him and he had a plan
[14:46] for his life
[14:48] we would so quickly want to judge Jacob
[14:51] and want to criticize him for all of his
[14:53] failures and mistakes and how he cheated
[14:55] his brother out of his Birthright my
[14:57] brother and sister God did not see it
[14:59] that way
[15:03] um
[15:06] that love was there before Jacob could
[15:08] do anything wrong
[15:10] before Jacob had a choice God chose him
[15:17] and it's not like God didn't know what
[15:19] Jacob would do
[15:20] but the key is that Jake God loved Jacob
[15:24] God chose to love Jacob
[15:32] Prophet says so God told him he said now
[15:34] he's in your hands but don't you take
[15:36] his life talking about job and Satan
[15:38] even stretched as far as he could on
[15:40] that he took every friend and everything
[15:42] he had almost his complete life but he
[15:44] couldn't take his life but job still
[15:47] held right on there was no turning back
[15:49] he says you see when a man or a person
[15:52] has once really come in contact
[15:54] with god with that genuine revealed
[15:58] faith that God is there's nothing
[16:01] there's no time nowhere can ever
[16:03] separate that man from his God I believe
[16:06] it was Paul said there's no Strife no
[16:08] anger no perils nor neither living
[16:11] creatures or death or anything that can
[16:13] separate us from the love of God which
[16:15] is in Christ Jesus is that true this
[16:18] morning is there anything that can
[16:20] separate us from the love of God
[16:23] that's anything by the way
[16:26] nothing can separate you from the love
[16:28] of God oh brother Chris I just don't
[16:30] know I don't feel right it doesn't feel
[16:32] good or I have this complex or this
[16:33] insecurity nothing can separate you from
[16:36] the love of God he chose to love you
[16:38] before you even had a choice
[16:41] and he has a reason he has a purpose in
[16:44] loving you because he has a covenant
[16:46] that he wants to keep between you and
[16:48] him
[16:51] oh my
[16:54] he was ordained to that life brother he
[16:56] says but Satan thought he could twist
[16:58] him around a little bit and cuff him up
[16:59] and make him do it but you see job with
[17:02] his perfect revelation of God and who
[17:04] God was and how God loved him he waited
[17:09] no matter what the circumstances was he
[17:12] waited for his faith to be confirmed
[17:14] because he had a grip on God a
[17:16] revelation that I spoke of last night
[17:19] so what is this love that we're talking
[17:21] about love is powerful you know where's
[17:23] the message you know this group we call
[17:26] ourselves the message Believers right
[17:27] we're under this Capstone Ministry we've
[17:31] reached the the very elite of all the
[17:35] church ages and all the the most
[17:37] powerful things and the strongest
[17:39] anointings and Eagle age and all these
[17:42] wonderful things and yet the whole thing
[17:43] is capped by his love
[17:48] see the power that we have is to love
[17:51] one another
[17:53] so what is this love we're talking about
[17:54] this morning
[17:57] he says hatred
[17:58] stirth up Strife but love covereth all
[18:02] sins This Love that covers old sins it
[18:04] doesn't just talk about your own sin see
[18:06] when we read that we immediately go Oh
[18:09] all my sins are covered that's wonderful
[18:10] praise the lord it's not just talking
[18:12] about you
[18:13] all right that's wonderful and we praise
[18:15] God for that that this Covenant of Grace
[18:17] is for you and he died for your sins and
[18:20] he covered you with his blood amen and
[18:22] he set you free and made you a new and a
[18:25] new living creature in Christ Jesus but
[18:28] that is not just for you this love
[18:30] covering all senses not for you only
[18:34] this is so that you can cover also the
[18:36] sins of others
[18:38] because you can choose to hate and you
[18:40] can choose to love
[18:42] you can choose to criticize you can
[18:44] choose to be different you can choose
[18:46] all those things but choose love because
[18:48] it covers a multitude of sins love will
[18:51] spread its mantle over the sins of his
[18:53] fellow Christians and it forgives them
[18:57] even all of them instead of exposing
[19:00] them it hides and conceals their errors
[19:04] and instead of loading and aggravating
[19:07] the infirmities of others it puts the
[19:10] best constructions in other words you
[19:12] build them up you you like a framer
[19:15] would build a house he he makes sure the
[19:17] right nails are used and the in the the
[19:19] structural strength is going to be there
[19:20] you build the best constructions around
[19:23] your fellow Christian
[19:26] why because you love them you have the
[19:29] love of God in your heart you put the
[19:31] best things forward in front of them you
[19:34] you you show them hope and you bear with
[19:37] them and you believe all things
[19:40] for their sake
[19:42] first Peter 4 7 says about the end of
[19:44] all things is at hand be therefore sober
[19:46] and watch unto prayer and above all
[19:50] things have fervent charity love among
[19:54] yourselves for charity shall cover the
[19:57] multitude of sins
[19:59] I don't think he just wrote this just so
[20:01] that you know we can read over there's
[20:03] power here that we have today this very
[20:05] morning in 2023 there's power if you
[20:08] have the Holy Ghost my brother and
[20:10] sister you have power to forgive you
[20:12] have power to build up and to and to
[20:14] create an atmosphere of love and peace
[20:16] and rest why would we want to aggravate
[20:19] somebody why would we want to point out
[20:21] their weak spots or why would we want to
[20:23] you know belittle somebody or or judge
[20:26] or criticize someone why not rather
[20:28] build them up and lift them up and see
[20:30] if he cannot save that soul
[20:34] you were saved the same way God chose to
[20:38] love you when he knew the mistakes you
[20:40] and I would make
[20:42] he chose to love
[20:45] my goodness
[20:47] you see in the sight of men both those
[20:50] whose sins are against and who they have
[20:52] been committed against he says this is
[20:54] true love true love thinks no ill of one
[20:57] another
[20:58] this is the ministry we're under
[21:01] praise the Lord I said it was going to
[21:03] challenge us today but puts the best
[21:06] constructions upon the words and actions
[21:08] of your fellow Christians does not take
[21:10] them up and improve and exaggerate
[21:12] things but lets them lie buried in
[21:15] Oblivion it takes no notice of injuries
[21:18] so we as individuals we're so easily
[21:20] offended that brother didn't look at me
[21:22] right or he didn't sing just in the
[21:24] right note or or it was a little too
[21:26] loud or it was a little too quiet or or
[21:28] maybe they didn't invite me over to a
[21:30] party it says that love does not take
[21:32] offense
[21:35] well the Lord help me give me strength
[21:38] this morning it takes no notice of
[21:41] injuries
[21:43] or a fronts but overlooks them and bears
[21:47] with them gives them the benefit of the
[21:48] doubt
[21:50] because we choose to love
[21:52] it bears with them and it forgives them
[21:55] so that they never are raked up again or
[21:58] seen any more
[22:02] which prevents strife and trouble if
[22:04] there's trouble and if there's strives
[22:05] my brothers and sisters because we're
[22:06] not letting go of things we as
[22:10] Christians have no right to hold grudges
[22:12] or criticize we just don't have that
[22:15] right and you might say how that's not
[22:17] fair brother Chris I've been really hurt
[22:19] you know I went through a situation in
[22:21] my life and I'm not saying that that
[22:23] your hurts are irrelevant and that it
[22:25] didn't happen that's what I'm saying
[22:26] what I'm saying is you don't have to
[22:28] live with those things there's a power
[22:31] here called the love of God that can set
[22:33] us free from hurts from pains and all
[22:35] those things and we have to choose that
[22:37] this morning choose to forgive and say
[22:39] Lord I might not be stronger strong
[22:41] enough to forgive I might not be strong
[22:43] enough to let go but you are strong
[22:44] enough
[22:49] he says I love you don't forget the
[22:52] Commandments of God to you little
[22:53] children love one another love everybody
[22:55] right or wrong sinner or Saint love them
[22:58] anyhow if you don't then pray God to
[23:01] help you
[23:02] because God loved the sinner
[23:06] and the nature of God is in you oh
[23:10] if the man is wrong love him anyhow see
[23:13] we want to justify our actions we want
[23:16] to sometimes you're right sometimes you
[23:18] are right and then you feel Justified
[23:20] but why why would we do that choose to
[23:23] love the person and lift them up rescue
[23:25] them
[23:26] choose to love him anyhow don't partake
[23:29] of his sins don't partake of his sins
[23:31] but in sweetness not in sourness and
[23:34] rebuke right have you ever seen you you
[23:36] tell a child oh go say sorry to your
[23:38] sibling I'm sorry
[23:41] right
[23:42] no in sweetness right not in sourness
[23:45] and rebuke and sweetness tell him of the
[23:48] hope of life that rests with within you
[23:50] through Jesus Christ being revealed to
[23:53] you by the Holy Ghost
[23:55] Romans 5 5 says and hope maketh not a
[23:58] shame because of the love of God is shed
[24:00] abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost
[24:02] which is given unto us in other words it
[24:04] is it never disappoints this hope that
[24:07] we have it's not ashamed you'll never be
[24:09] disappointed in in acting this way
[24:12] you'll never be disappointed in choosing
[24:14] to love and and allowing the Holy Ghost
[24:17] of God to shed this love of God in your
[24:19] heart you will not be disappointed and
[24:21] it will not dilute anything it will also
[24:23] not bring you to shame for God's love
[24:26] has been poured out into our hearts
[24:28] that's what the scripture is saying and
[24:30] in verse 6 then it says 4 when we were
[24:33] yet without Strength In Due Time Christ
[24:35] died for the ungodly when we were weak
[24:38] when we were Sinners unsaved when we
[24:40] were alienated from God God did what we
[24:43] could not do he bridged the Gap he stood
[24:46] in the gap for us because he chose to
[24:48] love us even while we were weak which is
[24:51] to be powerless to help ourselves
[24:53] so at the fitting time God stepped on
[24:56] the scene because of his Covenant
[25:01] what about us and one another for
[25:04] scarcely for a righteous man one will
[25:05] one die yet per adventure for a good man
[25:07] some would even dare to die but God
[25:10] commandeth commandeth his love toward us
[25:13] in that while we were yet sinners Christ
[25:16] died for us God is showing us clearly
[25:18] and proving the kind of love that he
[25:21] loves us with
[25:23] lay his life down
[25:25] before we even had a choice before we
[25:28] even had to say anything he laid his
[25:30] life down for you and I
[25:33] what should we be prepared to do for one
[25:35] another
[25:37] um
[25:39] father forgive them he said for they
[25:41] know not but they do
[25:46] just think he says if if gifts is so
[25:49] great what we call power and Paul said
[25:51] though I have faith that could move a
[25:52] mountain and have not charity I am
[25:54] nothing think of that and though we say
[25:57] well I understand I wish I know the
[25:58] Bible he says though I understand all
[26:01] the mysteries of God
[26:03] oh my see and still though I could do it
[26:06] and not and have not charity I am not a
[26:09] little I am nothing
[26:12] we can know all the quotes we can know
[26:14] all the scriptures I'm not belittling
[26:15] those things we should study the word of
[26:17] God and we should know those things so
[26:18] don't misunderstand me but my brother
[26:20] and sister if that's all you've got and
[26:22] you do not have the love of God in your
[26:24] heart it's worth absolutely zero
[26:27] and all we find it doing is causing
[26:30] divisions and strife and and it agitates
[26:33] and aggravates people that's not what
[26:35] we're after that's not what the message
[26:37] came to do in our lives
[26:40] just want to be very clear about that
[26:41] unless we have this charity I am nothing
[26:43] see I haven't got nowhere yet see the
[26:46] main thing is the main thing is love God
[26:50] and humble yourself with it he says now
[26:53] surely after all these years on the
[26:55] field and around the world and seeing
[26:56] different people I ought to know a
[26:58] little bit a little bit about the gate
[27:00] to enter in at and if you want to get
[27:03] somewhere with God never let an arrogant
[27:05] Spirit ever come around you don't let No
[27:08] Malice come in no matter what anybody
[27:11] does
[27:12] if they are wrong don't you never build
[27:15] up a complex against that person
[27:18] see you be sweet and kind remember God
[27:21] loved you when you were in sin and if
[27:24] the spirit of God is in you you love the
[27:26] other person when he is wrong see just
[27:29] pray for them and love one another my
[27:33] brother and sister I'm not I'm not just
[27:34] I don't want this to be cheap this
[27:36] morning I know what it means to be hurt
[27:38] I know what it means to be betrayed or
[27:40] or evil spoken of or falsely accused and
[27:43] all those things I get it I understand
[27:45] those things but it's so much better to
[27:48] just let it go
[27:49] and just say Lord give me strength to
[27:52] love give me strength to forgive oh God
[27:54] because I don't want to live like this I
[27:56] don't want to live in this misery with
[27:58] under the shadow of this cloud of misery
[28:00] and and and and self-loathing and and
[28:04] trying to find a little bit of happiness
[28:05] here a little bit of happiness just to
[28:07] let it go it's not worth it my brother
[28:09] and sister God will take care of all
[28:11] those things and you will come to
[28:13] understand all those things are working
[28:14] together for your good
[28:19] um
[28:21] above everything love God and love one
[28:23] another and be humble with God and
[28:26] around one another and God will bless us
[28:28] and it's hard telling what he will do
[28:30] usually when a church begins to get in
[28:32] numbers and get get to getting a little
[28:34] bigger or something like that they then
[28:36] they get away from the real thing the
[28:38] real thing
[28:41] do you know what brought these things to
[28:44] pass look at the message we've come how
[28:47] many years since the the message began
[28:50] the the the sounding of that eagle
[28:52] scream you know and and the and what God
[28:55] was going to do in this age how many
[28:56] years have we come
[28:58] come gone along now
[29:01] what has it become
[29:04] I want to say we have gotten to know the
[29:07] love of God
[29:09] we've become stronger in forgiveness
[29:11] we've become more willing to let go is
[29:13] what I'd like to say
[29:16] but look at what he says
[29:19] he's talking about the real thing
[29:21] and he's talking about the beginnings of
[29:24] the message
[29:26] when he was commissioned to bring a
[29:28] message to you and I do you know what
[29:30] brought these things to pass what
[29:32] started this whole thing when I first
[29:34] started and the Lord appeared to me down
[29:36] on the river and told me that that he
[29:38] was commissioned to bring a message to
[29:39] prepare the way of the Lord and brother
[29:41] Vale saw that and I believe in a paper
[29:43] in Canada many years ago where the angel
[29:45] of the Lord appeared on the river down
[29:46] there it was on Associated pessimistic
[29:49] light over a local Minister while
[29:51] baptizing you know what did that
[29:54] what brought that about what caused God
[29:57] to raise up a Ministry and have an angel
[29:59] come and meet him and declare before
[30:01] witnesses that this is the message this
[30:04] is this is my chosen vessel for a
[30:06] message to prepare the way of the Lord
[30:07] as John did right to bring the word for
[30:10] this generation I mean that's a pretty
[30:12] that's a that's an incredible event but
[30:16] what caused that event to come into
[30:18] fruition or to come into manifestation
[30:22] it says when we had the tent meeting
[30:24] just across the street a tent that
[30:26] seated about old 2500 people ministers
[30:28] come from everywhere and said brother
[30:30] come here a minute oh I was just a boy
[30:32] like just a kid and he said oh how deep
[30:34] do those P how do you keep those people
[30:37] in one Accord
[30:40] they love one another until I haven't
[30:43] seen people love one another
[30:47] whoa wait that's how this started
[30:51] that's the Lord that's what this church
[30:55] was established upon that Godly
[30:58] brotherly love one for another
[31:01] I've seen them even shake hands with one
[31:04] another leaving the place and cry like
[31:05] babies to leave one another
[31:08] they love one another that well and I
[31:12] could go to their house to visit them
[31:14] then times the Bible was laying open and
[31:16] stained with tears and he says come in
[31:19] at a night time where fathers and
[31:20] mothers was gathered together and their
[31:22] little children around on the floor
[31:24] kneeling around them fathers and mothers
[31:26] on their knees crying and praying and
[31:28] I'd stand at the door and wait and wait
[31:30] and wait and they didn't stop praying
[31:33] I'll just sit down on the steps and
[31:34] start praying myself waiting for them
[31:36] you see that that that was they loved
[31:40] one another they loved one another
[31:45] that's where this all started
[31:49] Galatians 5 14. here's a few scriptures
[31:51] just to jot down for yourself for all
[31:54] the law is fulfilled in one word
[31:58] even this Thou shalt love
[32:02] thy neighbor as thyself
[32:05] but the fruit of the spirit is love
[32:08] make no mistake about that the fruit of
[32:10] the spirit the holy ghost that we have
[32:12] the manifestation of that Holy Spirit In
[32:14] Our Lives is
[32:16] love
[32:18] sometimes we look for great
[32:20] demonstrations and great healings and
[32:22] those things are all part of the promise
[32:24] that God has given to you and I but what
[32:27] is the fruits of the spirit
[32:29] it's love
[32:32] amen peace long-suffering gentleness
[32:35] goodness Faith Ephesians 2 4 but God who
[32:38] is rich in Mercy for his great love
[32:40] wherewith he loved us even when we were
[32:44] dead in sins hath quickened us together
[32:45] in Christ by Grace you are saved and
[32:48] hath raised us up together and made us
[32:50] sit together in Heavenly places in
[32:52] Christ Jesus
[32:54] that Christ May dwell in your hearts by
[32:56] faith that ye being rooted and grounded
[32:58] in Doctrine
[33:01] in love
[33:02] in love my brother says don't forget how
[33:05] you came to the message how God saved
[33:07] you it's because you found out that he
[33:09] loves you and he was willing to forgive
[33:11] you and you fell in love with God and he
[33:13] poured out his mercy and his grace upon
[33:15] you and he and he has kept you on this
[33:18] journey he has poured out Revelations
[33:19] upon Revelation he has given you a
[33:22] pastor he's given you families he's
[33:24] giving you blessings he's healed you
[33:26] he's done all these things why because
[33:27] of a Covenant of Grace
[33:30] don't forget what this is all about we
[33:33] have been rooted and grounded in love
[33:36] we are the bride of Christ are we not
[33:39] there's a relationship start based on
[33:41] love
[33:44] and raise us up together
[33:46] sit in Heavenly places grounded in love
[33:48] may be able to comprehend with All
[33:50] Saints what is the breadth and length
[33:51] and depth and height and to know the
[33:54] love of Christ which passeth knowledge
[33:58] that you might be filled with all the
[34:01] fullness of God
[34:04] forbearing one another in love Ephesians
[34:06] 4 2 would tell us I didn't have that
[34:07] slide up there but the next one here
[34:09] Will Tell Us in First John 3 11 for this
[34:12] is the message I love that that ye heard
[34:16] from the beginning that we should love
[34:19] one another
[34:21] what is the message my brother and
[34:23] sister that we should love one another
[34:26] amen if we truly love one another as God
[34:29] love one another as God loved us
[34:32] huh wouldn't we live a very different
[34:35] kind of a life when we treat one another
[34:37] very differently
[34:39] this is the message that we heard from
[34:41] the beginning that you love one another
[34:43] not as Cain who was of the wicked one
[34:45] and slew his brother and wherefore slew
[34:48] he him because his own Works were evil
[34:50] and his brothers righteous Marvel not my
[34:53] brethren if the world hates you so don't
[34:55] be surprised if you're hated it doesn't
[34:57] mean we get to hate back it doesn't mean
[35:00] we get to have complexes and
[35:01] indifferences and build up walls no we
[35:03] are stronger than these things
[35:06] we are much stronger greater is he that
[35:08] is in us than he that is in the world my
[35:10] brother and sister friends at school
[35:11] might disregard you or push you aside or
[35:13] bully you it doesn't mean we get to
[35:15] treat them that way you need to know
[35:17] that they need the love of God
[35:21] they need the power of God
[35:24] it will break every chain don't be
[35:26] afraid of those things don't be afraid
[35:28] to love someone
[35:29] there's more power in love than there is
[35:32] in hate
[35:41] he says
[35:43] Marvel not my brother if the world Haiti
[35:45] we know that we have passed from Death
[35:46] unto life because we love the Brethren
[35:49] he that loveth not his brother abideth
[35:52] in death that's a sobering scripture
[35:56] sobering oh I believe the message well
[35:58] let's just go look what the Bible says
[36:01] I know it shook me to my very core do I
[36:05] really understand what this message has
[36:08] come to do for me
[36:12] verse 15.
[36:14] whosoever hateth his brother is a
[36:16] murderer and ye know that no murderer
[36:19] has eternal life abiding in him
[36:22] ouch hereby perceive we the love of God
[36:24] because he laid down his life for us and
[36:27] we ought to lay down our lives for the
[36:29] Brethren Lord give me strength
[36:32] huh
[36:33] beloved let us love one another the
[36:35] Bible says for love is of God and
[36:37] everyone that loveth is born of God and
[36:41] knoweth God he that loveth not knoweth
[36:44] not God for God is love
[36:49] in this was manifested the love of God
[36:51] towards us because that God sent his
[36:53] only begotten son into the world that we
[36:56] might live through him here in his love
[36:58] not that we love God but that he loved
[37:01] us and sent his son to be the
[37:03] perpetuation of our sins beloved if God
[37:06] so loved us we ought also to love one
[37:09] another no man has seen God at any time
[37:11] if we love one another God dwelleth in
[37:14] us and his love is perfected in US
[37:18] there's another one are you going to
[37:19] find a lot of scriptures when you start
[37:21] looking for the power of love and the
[37:23] ministry we're under the anointing
[37:25] that's in the bride the spirit of God
[37:27] love is going to be at every turn
[37:30] amen praise though I'm happy for that
[37:32] because if God said so my brother and
[37:34] sister then it's available to us today
[37:40] first John 4 and 17 hearing is our love
[37:42] made perfect that we may have boldness
[37:44] in the day of judgment because as he is
[37:48] so are we in this world
[37:50] there is no fear in love
[37:53] but perfect love casteth out fear
[37:56] because fear hath torment in he that
[37:59] feareth is not made in perfect love this
[38:02] is why love is so important in a
[38:03] Christian walk because when you get into
[38:06] a place where you're critical or you
[38:08] cannot forgive somebody it starts to
[38:11] generate a fear you don't want to be
[38:12] around certain people it starts to
[38:14] generate a certain insecurity and you're
[38:17] afraid to visit other churches or you're
[38:19] afraid to to talk to other people from
[38:21] other churches or other family members
[38:23] because you're afraid it's as insecurity
[38:25] it's a complex that sets in but love
[38:29] knows no fear there's no fear in love
[38:32] love is liberating it sets you free
[38:40] so we love him because he first loved us
[38:42] and if a man say I love God and heideth
[38:45] his brother he is a liar for he that
[38:48] loveth not his brother whom he has seen
[38:50] how can he love God whom he hath not
[38:52] seen and this commandment have we from
[38:54] him that he who loveth God loves his
[38:57] brother also
[39:00] thank you Lord
[39:02] Lord help me
[39:04] and give me strength oh God
[39:06] huh I'm nothing Lord I am nothing
[39:09] without you I cannot even take the next
[39:11] step I cannot I don't even want to take
[39:13] the next thought without your power
[39:15] without your Holy Spirit
[39:17] he says don't hold nothing against
[39:19] anybody or anybody's Church let's go
[39:23] together as one like brother and sister
[39:25] and then the sinner on the outside will
[39:28] know what that we really love Jesus
[39:34] right we think it's all about Doctrine
[39:37] and Mysteries those things are good
[39:39] because they they are the revealed word
[39:41] for our day I'm not downplaying those
[39:43] things but at the end of the day the
[39:45] center on the outside is looking in and
[39:46] they're going wow those people cannot
[39:48] even get along
[39:50] and this is the truth for our day now
[39:52] I'm just I just want to get real down to
[39:54] real business you know this might be the
[39:56] last time I ever preacher my brother and
[39:58] sister but the important thing is is
[40:00] that we take inventory of what we are
[40:02] presenting to the world
[40:04] because if we have the truth and it
[40:06] should give us power to walk one with
[40:08] one another
[40:10] and not have inferiority complexes
[40:16] on the outside we really love Jesus
[40:18] Jesus said this this will this will all
[40:20] men know that you are my disciples
[40:21] because you have Shake one another's
[40:23] hands because you belong to this church
[40:26] because you have love one for another is
[40:30] that right he says the love one for
[40:32] another
[40:33] then you will know all men will know
[40:35] that you are my disciples and if we do
[40:37] not have love one for another then we
[40:39] cannot be his disciples and that's
[40:42] what's holding the Sinners back
[40:45] that's scary
[40:47] I don't want to stand there on Judgment
[40:49] Day and there's a sinner on the outside
[40:51] saying well I just I didn't want to come
[40:53] into the church I didn't want to go and
[40:55] find out what it was all about because
[40:56] there was so much strife and fussing and
[40:59] hatred
[41:00] I don't want to stand there on that day
[41:01] my brother and sister an answer for
[41:03] having a critical spirit and it kept a
[41:05] soul from being saved and you will be
[41:08] that reason why that Soul wasn't safe
[41:10] because we have the option to show love
[41:13] instead
[41:15] you've been given the right the
[41:17] privilege the power to show love excuse
[41:21] me
[41:23] to show love
[41:32] questions and answers he says this he
[41:34] says but here's the fruits of the spirit
[41:36] love joy peace long-suffering goodness
[41:38] gentleness patience that's the fruit of
[41:40] the spirit and if those signs follow you
[41:42] then I kind of believe what Jesus told
[41:44] me to look for he said this will all men
[41:46] know that you're my disciples when you
[41:48] have congregations said love one for
[41:51] another
[41:52] that's right when you have loved one for
[41:54] another although the man might different
[41:56] with you yet you love him just the same
[41:59] see
[42:00] praise the Lord yes Lord thank you
[42:02] oh if you just love those who love you
[42:04] what reward have you
[42:06] Sinners do the same thing see oh see why
[42:10] it's a Capstone of love
[42:12] it's our challenge my brother and sister
[42:14] it's a challenge that we face is to love
[42:17] and it would be easy to love someone who
[42:19] loves you that's not the challenge of
[42:21] our day you will be hated
[42:24] persecuted spoken evil on falsely
[42:26] accused
[42:27] you will be isolated made fun of
[42:30] and yet we will love back
[42:41] it says if a man really hates you and he
[42:43] proved he hates you and still in your
[42:46] heart you love him you're getting pretty
[42:48] close to the kingdom
[42:50] he proved he came and said to your face
[42:53] I hate you
[42:54] you offend me
[42:57] I dislike you
[43:00] and you can love him
[43:02] that's a real challenge
[43:05] they falsely accuse you behind your back
[43:08] and through the gossip Circle you hear
[43:09] back that they said something about you
[43:11] it's not even true and so quickly we
[43:12] want to justify or clear that up and we
[43:15] get busy and then we want to rebuttal
[43:17] that and we want to meet with everybody
[43:19] if you know how much easier it is to
[43:20] just say Lord I forgive them they don't
[43:22] even know what they're doing
[43:24] they don't even know what they're saying
[43:25] Lord there must be something there in
[43:28] their heart I asked Lord you would just
[43:30] remove that from their heart but Lord
[43:32] I'm so thankful for your love and the
[43:34] and the grace wherewith you love me with
[43:36] help me to love this one the same way
[43:39] isn't that so much easier just let it go
[43:43] because what's going to happen is the
[43:45] devil wants you to try and justify
[43:46] yourself he wants to have a meeting with
[43:48] you right so now you got to justify your
[43:50] actions it's all a lie anyway but now
[43:52] you got to justify a lie or or disprove
[43:56] a lie and you're going to get into this
[43:57] conversation getting get into a heated
[43:58] debate just say I forgive you it's so
[44:01] much easier it's not worth it
[44:06] we don't have a reputation
[44:09] right as a Christian we are dead in
[44:11] Christ it's only his reputation that's
[44:14] at stake we don't have a reputation to
[44:16] upkeep we don't have a reputation to
[44:18] prove we have nothing to prove my
[44:20] brother sister don't forget we are dead
[44:22] in Christ we have no opinion we have no
[44:25] rights
[44:26] we don't need to justify ourselves it's
[44:28] all on God I'm hidden in Christ Jesus
[44:34] we so quickly want to justify ourselves
[44:37] we're so worried about our image it's
[44:38] only God's image that's at stake
[44:42] you'll take care of it amen
[44:47] he says now just don't love them and say
[44:52] and say well I'm supposed to do it
[44:56] but you love them anyhow if you don't
[44:58] love him from your heart you have to say
[45:00] if you have to say you love him when you
[45:02] don't he says you know what that makes
[45:04] you a hypocrite see don't walk up and
[45:07] tell them you do less you really do and
[45:10] if you don't feel that way just stay
[45:13] right here until you feel that way
[45:15] because I'll assure you there's
[45:17] sufficient Grace to make you feel that
[45:19] way
[45:21] oh thank you Lord that's right it really
[45:24] will well brother Chris I just can't
[45:25] seem to get over this thing well just
[45:27] stay there in the presence of God just
[45:29] keep staying there in my run sister
[45:31] there's that as we heard this morning
[45:32] there's that warm feeling that comes
[45:33] over you God pours in his grace and his
[45:36] love to you so that you can love that
[45:38] individual
[45:41] brother Branham talks about the the
[45:43] third pull demonstration this is the the
[45:45] great uh strong arm of the message my
[45:48] brother and sister is that we are in the
[45:49] third pool Ministry and we're seeing the
[45:51] the effects of it and we desire the
[45:53] third pull it's all got to do with Love
[45:55] by the way
[45:57] we're so concerned about the
[45:59] demonstration and the power to speak to
[46:01] hornets and a bull and and speak food on
[46:04] our table Without Love
[46:07] no way
[46:08] no way the third pull is because of love
[46:12] it was love that that spoke to the
[46:14] Hornets it was love that spoke to the
[46:16] bull
[46:16] it was loud that brought that little
[46:18] fish back to life
[46:23] he says and when I was mowing This Grass
[46:26] I run in forgot about it there was a
[46:27] hornet's nest back there and I hit that
[46:29] fence with this mowing machine and I was
[46:31] covered over with Hornets them great big
[46:34] fellows they'll knock you down when they
[46:35] get when they hit you he says at first I
[46:38] was scared truly no shirt on and
[46:40] something or another happened
[46:43] this is the keys right to loving the
[46:46] right way I was sorry I hit those
[46:49] fellows not because that I was afraid I
[46:52] was going to get stung so he wasn't out
[46:54] of fear love doesn't know fear
[46:57] there's no fear in love
[47:00] right just perfect love
[47:03] he says I was afraid I was not afraid I
[47:05] was going to get stung but really it
[47:07] sounds juvenile but if we could just be
[47:10] more juvenile he says if we could be
[47:12] more childlike he says it's the
[47:15] Simplicity of God that turns college
[47:17] students around be simple in those
[47:19] things just like a baby just rely and
[47:22] believe don't try to push yourself just
[47:25] relax and believe it
[47:28] that's all don't try to work yourself up
[47:30] oh God hallelujah and rebuke it no no
[47:33] that's no good no just believe it and
[47:35] walk on that's all
[47:38] so when that happened I thought them
[47:40] poor little fellows up there in their
[47:41] nest now and here I done hit the fence
[47:43] and knock them out of their fence that
[47:44] big old mowing machine I was pushing and
[47:47] I said you little you're little
[47:49] creatures of God I'm sorry that I hit
[47:50] this fence I'm sorry that I Disturbed
[47:53] you but I'm God's servant
[47:56] and I'm praying for his sick children I
[47:57] got to hurry and mow this this yard so
[48:00] now you rush right back into your nest I
[48:02] won't bother you no more in the name of
[48:03] the Lord Jesus and I started my mower
[48:06] off again and stopped and I'd pull the
[48:07] string and start it off like that and
[48:09] then B's just a humming all around my
[48:11] naked shoulders and they took a b line
[48:13] and went right back to their nest
[48:15] without stinging at all love and then he
[48:18] says I can't produce it I can't work it
[48:22] up
[48:23] God's got to give it
[48:27] there's where it is tonight God has to
[48:29] give it then love produces a fellowship
[48:32] now when God said back there the day
[48:35] that sin had separated the Divine love
[48:36] God told Adam and Eve not to eat those
[48:39] certain fruits and they did and sin
[48:41] brought separation and sin by separation
[48:44] brought hatred
[48:46] malice strife and envy is that right
[48:49] what happened they separated from Divine
[48:51] love and when you separate from Divine
[48:54] love then you can't overlook your
[48:56] brother's mistakes no more
[48:59] you've got to ball him out for it that's
[49:01] right you can't overlook your sister's
[49:04] mistakes no more because you've got to
[49:06] get because you've got away from that
[49:08] Divine part that love part
[49:11] but if you really love the Lord Jesus
[49:14] if sister or brother does something to
[49:16] you oh well that's all right they didn't
[49:19] mean to do it
[49:22] that's the kind of love that Christ had
[49:24] father forgive them they don't know what
[49:27] they're doing
[49:28] what if he'd held my sins against me
[49:32] what an awful person I was but he loved
[49:36] me so well that he forgave me for them
[49:38] when I was undone
[49:41] he forgave me
[49:44] he loved me with a pure love
[49:47] and when Adam separated himself from
[49:49] Pure Love from keeping God's word in his
[49:51] heart when he did that these other
[49:53] faculties come in Malice Envy Strife
[49:55] hatred so forth
[49:57] I think we've just gotten off the main
[50:00] thing
[50:01] is it possible
[50:02] it's okay because the prophet told us we
[50:04] can do the right thing from today on
[50:07] it's okay we're under a Grace Covenant
[50:10] we can fix this whole thing right now
[50:12] it's in our power to do so
[50:17] he says now when God's seen his children
[50:19] had separated he come down for
[50:21] fellowship and there was no one there to
[50:23] welcome him
[50:25] remember the other night when I preached
[50:27] on the woman washing Jesus feet he was
[50:29] unwelcome by the Pharisees he was on
[50:32] he's unwelcome tonight by many people
[50:34] he's unwelcomed in many churches in many
[50:37] cities look when Israel was divided in
[50:40] up their lands dividing up their lands
[50:42] there I believe it was God was one of
[50:44] them and perhaps the half tribe they
[50:46] didn't go over into the promised land
[50:48] they stayed on this side borderline
[50:50] Jesus visited that same people and look
[50:53] at the results of staying out of the
[50:55] full benefits of God's love
[50:58] when Jesus visited them he went over in
[51:00] gadara that's where they were where they
[51:03] were dwelling that's where they made
[51:05] that's where they were come from right
[51:07] there and their attitude was still the
[51:09] same
[51:10] see it cost them a bunch of hogs to have
[51:13] the meeting and they asked Jesus to
[51:15] leave their land
[51:17] they didn't want nothing to do with it
[51:19] they had their own ways they had their
[51:20] own churches they didn't want nothing to
[51:22] do with Jesus so they asked him to leave
[51:24] the land where is Jesus Christ today
[51:27] is in his people
[51:30] I wonder how many times he has he has
[51:32] felt unwelcome
[51:36] but he went anyhow because there was one
[51:39] Soul calling for him just think cross
[51:42] that stormy Lake over across there to
[51:44] find that one soul in need that was his
[51:47] love for one needy Soul he will come
[51:50] from Glory tonight to the school
[51:52] auditorium for one need his soul that
[51:54] will believe in him
[51:57] and so then when sin came in it
[51:58] separated man from his Fellowship notice
[52:01] what God did to bring man back to
[52:02] fellowship he introduced to the world a
[52:05] blood Redemption
[52:06] God killed animals and put it for their
[52:08] sin showing a blood Redemption and their
[52:11] God after being separated from his
[52:12] creatures God laid out the welcome mat
[52:15] home by shedding of the blood and that
[52:18] was then and has been and will always be
[52:21] God's provided preparation for
[52:23] fellowship with him is through this shed
[52:26] blood
[52:28] I just got three more quotes and then I
[52:30] want to get into this letting go of the
[52:31] rope we're doing really good for time
[52:33] here
[52:36] we're doing all right
[52:39] he says and he there's one of the
[52:41] greatest hindrance that there is in the
[52:43] church today the greatest hindrance and
[52:45] right here at Edmonton or not Edmonton I
[52:48] didn't mean to say that I mean Prince
[52:49] Albert and among other people everywhere
[52:52] is fear but love perfect love casts
[52:56] without fear see you're fearful is
[52:58] because the right Temperance of love has
[53:00] never entered yet
[53:02] when there's real love all fear passes
[53:05] away when you really love the Lord he
[53:07] says now I'm not condemning you I'm only
[53:09] trying to bring something to light that
[53:11] you could look at because after all
[53:14] these sick people sitting here and
[53:17] Sinners and so forth and the differences
[53:20] what makes it all
[53:23] I can't believe that God's pleased with
[53:25] it so there must be some remedy
[53:29] and if we can find that remedy we ought
[53:31] to use that so the thing it is it's a
[53:35] lack of love
[53:38] no matter how many prophecies we have
[53:40] how many great preachers how much
[53:43] theology we know how great a church we
[53:46] belong to if love doesn't temper that
[53:49] together it's of none
[53:53] oh brother of course we want to see more
[53:54] miracles we want to see healings taking
[53:56] place
[53:58] we know how to do it
[54:02] right we know how to do it
[54:04] sometimes we think oh I just don't have
[54:06] faith and and we need more faith and we
[54:08] need stronger Ministries and bring in an
[54:10] evangelist and do this and all those
[54:12] things are fine as long as you have love
[54:15] right but sometimes we put the card
[54:16] before the horse and we'd say oh well
[54:18] where is God and all these things he's
[54:20] saying where's the love
[54:26] even in First Corinthians 13 though I
[54:28] speak with tongues of men and angels and
[54:32] become as sounding brass and tingling
[54:34] simple though I have prophecy and
[54:36] knowledge and understand all the
[54:37] mysteries of God and have faith to move
[54:39] mountains and have not love I am become
[54:41] nothing so what should we really strive
[54:44] for what is the thing we really want in
[54:46] our lives
[54:48] what is the most important thing we
[54:50] should have
[54:52] based on the scripture
[54:56] Beyond Mysteries Beyond healings and and
[54:59] speaking in tongues beyond all those
[55:02] demonstrations my brother and sister
[55:03] were fine with all those things are all
[55:05] promises that we that belongs to the
[55:08] church but it should be built on this on
[55:10] the right foundation
[55:12] otherwise you'll think you're serving
[55:14] God and he's nowhere near because
[55:16] remember in the Bible they were casting
[55:18] out Devils they were doing all those
[55:19] things in Jesus name and when they came
[55:21] to Jesus he said depart from me I don't
[55:23] even know who you are
[55:27] okay
[55:28] you're going to take a sharp turn
[55:32] what inspired me in this sermon topic
[55:35] was the story of Corey ten Boom does
[55:37] anybody know the story of Corey ten Boom
[55:40] incredible incredible story now she
[55:42] would be a very good example of how to
[55:45] forgive
[55:46] right
[55:47] the Unforgivable
[55:50] right but I think her example and what
[55:53] God did for her is very good for us as
[55:54] message believers
[55:56] and I don't think any of us I'm pretty
[55:58] sure not any of us here today would have
[56:01] the same story that she did
[56:04] right you know we started to look at
[56:06] other people and we realized man we
[56:08] really have nothing to be sorry for we
[56:10] have nothing to be complaining about we
[56:12] have nothing to be criticizing over man
[56:15] this is really nothing because it is
[56:18] so here's just an extract from The
[56:21] Hiding Place by Corey ten Boom and I'm
[56:24] going to read it with you you can read
[56:25] it with me but as we go through you're
[56:27] going to you're going to pick up little
[56:29] nuggets there there's little steps that
[56:31] she took to be free completely from any
[56:34] Grudge or any hurt feelings okay and
[56:38] it's the same process that the prophet
[56:39] has been telling us about and the
[56:41] scriptures have been showing to us
[56:43] it's amazing that it worked for her huh
[56:45] will it not work for us also
[56:49] he says it was in a church in Munich
[56:52] that I saw him a balding heavyset man in
[56:55] a gray Overcoat a brown felt hat clutch
[56:58] between his hands people were filling
[57:00] filing out of the basement room where I
[57:02] had just spoken moving along the rows of
[57:05] wooden chairs to the door at the rear it
[57:07] was 1947 and I had come from Holland to
[57:11] defeated Germany with a message that God
[57:13] forgives
[57:15] you know in the message what we we tell
[57:18] people a message also you know that God
[57:20] is love and God forgives and and the
[57:22] mysteries of God have been made plain
[57:24] and been unveiled to us and we bring a
[57:26] message but sometimes it you know we
[57:28] bring a message and we can say it so
[57:30] easily but it hasn't really happened
[57:32] here
[57:33] right
[57:35] and that's just how this woman starts us
[57:37] off she says you know that that she went
[57:39] to defeated Germany what a noble cause
[57:42] what an incredible thing we would say
[57:45] that she's already found the the power
[57:47] to forgive if she is going to Germany
[57:51] and helping people forgive Germans for
[57:53] the things that they did to them
[57:55] to the Jews right and so we we see how
[57:58] that this already sounds like man she's
[58:00] already doing really well she's
[58:01] obviously overcome all the hurts and
[58:03] grudges and pains in her life and here
[58:06] she is going and preaching a message of
[58:08] forgiveness but something happens and
[58:11] God has a way of bringing something our
[58:13] way he has a way of bringing somebody
[58:15] face to face with us where you go to
[58:17] realize God I'm not strong enough for
[58:19] this
[58:20] Hallelujah but God's grace is strong
[58:23] enough
[58:24] there's a power my brother and sister
[58:26] where you can face that person face to
[58:28] face and you can truly love them not
[58:30] just talk about it but truly love the
[58:33] individual
[58:36] it was the truth they needed most to
[58:39] hear in that bitter bombed out land and
[58:42] I gave them my favorite mental picture
[58:44] because we maybe because the sea is
[58:47] never far from a hollander's mind I like
[58:49] to think that that's where forgiven sins
[58:51] were thrown when we confess our sins I
[58:54] said God cast them into the deepest
[58:56] ocean gone forever and the solemn faces
[59:00] stared back at me not quite daring to
[59:03] believe there there were never questions
[59:05] after a talk in Germany in 1947 people
[59:09] just stood up in silence in silence
[59:11] collected their raps in silence left the
[59:14] room
[59:15] what an awesome thing to consider
[59:18] that you can be forgiven
[59:21] see sometimes we can't forgive ourselves
[59:24] he says and that's when I saw him
[59:28] working his way forward against the
[59:30] others
[59:31] One Moment I Saw the Overcoat in the
[59:33] brown hat the next a blue uniform and
[59:36] advisored cap with its skull and
[59:38] crossbones and it came back with a rush
[59:43] the huge room with its harsh overhead
[59:45] lights and the pathetic pile of dresses
[59:48] and shoes in the center of the floor the
[59:49] shame of walking naked past this man I
[59:53] could see my sister's frail form ahead
[59:55] of me ribs sharp beneath the parchment's
[59:58] skin Betsy how thin you were and Betsy
[1:00:02] and I had been arrested for concealing
[1:00:03] Jews in our home through during the Nazi
[1:00:06] occupation of Holland and this man had
[1:00:08] been a guard at ravensbrook
[1:00:10] concentration camp where we were sent
[1:00:12] this man
[1:00:14] this man would would finally come face
[1:00:17] to face with her the one that that
[1:00:19] exposed him the one that caused them all
[1:00:21] that hurt
[1:00:26] now he was in front of me
[1:00:31] hand thrusts out
[1:00:33] a fine message for a line
[1:00:37] how good it is to know that as you say
[1:00:40] all our sins are at the bottom of sea
[1:00:45] see he knew that God did something for
[1:00:47] him
[1:00:49] but did she know that
[1:00:53] and I who had spoken so glibly of
[1:00:56] forgiveness fumbled in my pocketbook
[1:00:59] rather than take that hand
[1:01:01] she was preaching forgiveness and now
[1:01:04] she's face to face with a very Challenge
[1:01:06] and she can't bring her hand out of her
[1:01:09] pocket
[1:01:11] because it's so real these things are
[1:01:13] real my brother and sister these things
[1:01:14] heard Deep and and they change Us in
[1:01:17] ways we don't realize until you come
[1:01:19] face to face with that thing
[1:01:23] confronted
[1:01:30] he would not remember me of course how
[1:01:33] could he remember one prison among those
[1:01:34] thousands of women
[1:01:36] but I remembered him and the leather
[1:01:39] crop swinging from his belt I was face
[1:01:42] to face with one of my captors and my
[1:01:44] blood seemed to freeze you mentioned
[1:01:46] Raven's broken your talk he was saying I
[1:01:49] was a guard there
[1:01:51] no he did not remember me but since that
[1:01:54] time he went on I have become a
[1:01:55] Christian I know that God has forgiven
[1:01:58] me for the cruel things I did there
[1:02:02] is that amazing God can forgive a man
[1:02:04] like that
[1:02:09] could he erase
[1:02:11] sorry
[1:02:13] the cruel things I did there but I would
[1:02:15] like to hear it from your lips as well
[1:02:19] Fraulein again the hand came out will
[1:02:22] you forgive me
[1:02:25] what power is given into our hearts
[1:02:30] what ability has been given to you and I
[1:02:33] to forgive
[1:02:35] what a message of Hope to this crazy
[1:02:38] dying frustrated world
[1:02:40] that we have in our hearts
[1:02:44] will you forgive me
[1:02:46] and I stood there I whose sins that
[1:02:48] again and again to be forgiven had to be
[1:02:51] forgiven and could not forgive
[1:02:53] Betsy had died in that place her sister
[1:02:56] could he erase her slow terrible death
[1:02:59] simply for the asking
[1:03:02] could he fix all the hurts and the
[1:03:05] wrongdoings could he fix all the things
[1:03:06] he did to me to my sister can he erase
[1:03:09] that terrible event
[1:03:13] just by asking for forgiveness
[1:03:17] it could not have been many seconds that
[1:03:20] he stood there handheld out but to me it
[1:03:23] seemed hours as I wrestled with the most
[1:03:26] difficult thing I had ever faced and
[1:03:28] here she is preaching forgiveness
[1:03:35] for I had to do it I knew that the
[1:03:38] message that God forgives has a prior
[1:03:41] condition that he forgave forgive those
[1:03:44] who have injured us
[1:03:45] if you don't forgive men their
[1:03:48] trespasses Jesus says neither will your
[1:03:51] father in Heaven forgive your trespasses
[1:03:55] this is Dangerous Ground my brown sister
[1:03:58] if we do not forgive we will not be
[1:04:02] forgiven
[1:04:06] what a challenge
[1:04:08] I knew it not only as a commandment of
[1:04:10] God but as a daily experience since the
[1:04:12] end of the war I have had a home in
[1:04:15] Holland for victims of Nazi brutality
[1:04:17] those who were able to forgive their
[1:04:19] former enemies were able also to return
[1:04:22] to the outside world and rebuild their
[1:04:24] lives no matter what the physical scars
[1:04:27] look at the the freedom it brought to
[1:04:30] those people that were able to forgive
[1:04:32] those who nurse their bitterness
[1:04:34] remained invalids
[1:04:37] it was as simple and as horrible as that
[1:04:41] and let's take a look around the message
[1:04:43] World in our families
[1:04:45] those who nurse bitterness oh a pastor
[1:04:48] hurt me or a deacon hurt me those who
[1:04:51] nurse brother my parents were legalistic
[1:04:54] those who nurse bitterness
[1:04:57] will be an invalid forever
[1:05:01] and I'm here to bring you a message of
[1:05:03] Grace and love today that you can be
[1:05:05] free from that
[1:05:07] you don't have to live like that
[1:05:09] just forgive and let go
[1:05:13] it's horrible and as simple as that is
[1:05:18] he says and still I stood there with a
[1:05:21] coldness clutching my heart but
[1:05:23] forgiveness is not an emotion I knew
[1:05:26] that too forgiveness is an act of the
[1:05:29] will and the will can function
[1:05:31] regardless of the temperature of the
[1:05:34] heart
[1:05:35] help I prayed silently
[1:05:39] I can lift my hand I can do that much
[1:05:43] you supply the feeling
[1:05:47] isn't that the most powerful thing
[1:05:50] we need to act by faith that's why when
[1:05:53] we raise our hands in church we're
[1:05:55] saying Lord I believe I would defy
[1:05:57] gravity it's an action but God brings
[1:05:59] the Holy Spirit God brings the increase
[1:06:01] God brings the healing God brings the
[1:06:03] right feeling
[1:06:08] and so woodenly mechanically I thrust my
[1:06:12] hand into the one stretched out to me
[1:06:13] and as I did an incredible thing took
[1:06:17] place
[1:06:18] the current started in my shoulder and
[1:06:21] it raced on my arm and sprang into my
[1:06:23] into our joined hands and then this
[1:06:25] healing warmth
[1:06:27] seemed to flood my whole being bringing
[1:06:30] tears to my eyes
[1:06:34] how many wants to be free this morning
[1:06:37] you got to do the mechanical thing you
[1:06:39] got to start somewhere make an action
[1:06:42] God Will Supply the rest
[1:06:46] God Will Supply the rest
[1:06:49] I forgive you brother
[1:06:51] I cried
[1:06:53] with all my heart
[1:06:56] for a long moment we grasped each
[1:06:58] other's hands
[1:06:59] the former guard and the former prisoner
[1:07:02] what a picture
[1:07:03] I had never known God's love so
[1:07:07] intensely as I did then
[1:07:12] and having thus learned to forgive in
[1:07:14] this hardest of situations I never again
[1:07:16] had difficulty in forgiving
[1:07:19] I wish I could say it
[1:07:21] I wish I could say that merciful and
[1:07:24] charitable thoughts just naturally
[1:07:26] flowed from me from then on
[1:07:28] but they didn't
[1:07:31] if there's one thing I've learned in 80
[1:07:32] years of age is that I can't store up
[1:07:34] good feelings and behavior but only draw
[1:07:37] them fresh from God each day
[1:07:41] that's so incredible that you would
[1:07:43] think that everything was settled from
[1:07:45] then on she had this amazing power in
[1:07:47] her life to overcome and to forgive but
[1:07:50] it it had to happen every day
[1:07:53] every day God would Supply
[1:07:57] maybe I'm glad it's that way for every
[1:07:59] time I go to him he teaches me something
[1:08:01] else I recall the time some 15 years ago
[1:08:04] when some Christian friends whom I loved
[1:08:07] and trusted did something which hurt me
[1:08:09] now this is after this this this episode
[1:08:12] with this guard so you would think that
[1:08:14] this would be easy now that she could
[1:08:16] just go on her way and she it would be
[1:08:18] easy to forgive but look at the
[1:08:19] situation that comes up Christian
[1:08:21] friends I Christian friends right they
[1:08:25] did it all in Christian love right and
[1:08:27] brotherly love right
[1:08:29] Christian friends did something that
[1:08:32] hurt me
[1:08:34] you would have thought that having
[1:08:35] forgiven the Nazi guard that would have
[1:08:37] been Child's Play
[1:08:40] it wasn't for weeks it seized inside but
[1:08:45] at last I asked God again to work his
[1:08:47] miracle in me and again it happened
[1:08:50] first the cold-blooded decision and then
[1:08:53] the flood of joy and peace first a
[1:08:57] cold-blooded decision
[1:09:01] don't wait for the feeling first first
[1:09:03] trust in God then they say I will fight
[1:09:06] your battles
[1:09:09] then they say we can cast our cares upon
[1:09:11] Him
[1:09:12] he would never leave us nor forsake us
[1:09:15] first belief First Trust first extend
[1:09:18] the hand and watch what God will do
[1:09:22] I had forgiven my friends I was restored
[1:09:25] to my father then why was I suddenly
[1:09:27] awake watch this here in the middle of
[1:09:30] the night hashing over the whole Affair
[1:09:32] again
[1:09:33] my friends I thought people I loved
[1:09:37] they're message believers
[1:09:41] if it had been strangers I wouldn't have
[1:09:43] minded so I sat up and I switched on the
[1:09:45] light father I thought it was all
[1:09:47] forgiven please help me do it
[1:09:53] but the next night I woke up again
[1:09:56] they talked so sweetly too
[1:09:59] huh never a hint of what they were
[1:10:02] planning father I cried an alarm help me
[1:10:07] his help came in the form of a kindly
[1:10:09] Lutheran Pastor to whom I confessed my
[1:10:12] failure after two Sleepless weeks so she
[1:10:15] had had enough she needed help so she
[1:10:17] goes through this pastor this Lutheran
[1:10:19] pastor and he can and she confines in
[1:10:21] him because it was you know she was
[1:10:23] losing sleep and it was just not working
[1:10:25] you would think she would have had this
[1:10:27] sorted out already but see these things
[1:10:29] can be so deep
[1:10:32] we don't notice them
[1:10:34] we wonder you know why am I miserable
[1:10:36] why can't I sleep there's something
[1:10:38] rooted
[1:10:39] on the very in the very depths of our
[1:10:41] heart somebody hurt you or or there's a
[1:10:43] feeling and we need to uproot it we need
[1:10:46] to get somebody with a strong enough
[1:10:47] shovel and a picture pickaxe to get in
[1:10:50] there and get and remove it so she goes
[1:10:52] to this pastor and asks him for help
[1:10:56] up in that church Tower he said nodding
[1:10:59] out the window he says Isabel which is
[1:11:02] rung by pulling a rope there's a bell
[1:11:04] there that's pulled that's rung by
[1:11:06] pulling on a rope but you know what
[1:11:08] after the sexton let's go of the Rope
[1:11:11] the Bell keeps swinging
[1:11:13] and first ding
[1:11:15] and dong
[1:11:18] slower and slower until there's a final
[1:11:22] dung and it stops
[1:11:30] I believe the same thing is true of
[1:11:32] forgiveness
[1:11:33] when we forgive someone we take our
[1:11:35] hands off the Rope
[1:11:40] but if we've been tugging at our
[1:11:42] grievances for a long time we mustn't be
[1:11:44] surprised if that old angry thoughts
[1:11:47] keep coming for a while
[1:11:48] they're just the ding dongs of an Old
[1:11:51] Bell
[1:11:52] slowing down
[1:11:56] that helped me so much
[1:11:59] you know I watched a video clip
[1:12:02] they had this Bell massive Bell you know
[1:12:06] about as big as a piano area here and it
[1:12:08] was raised off the ground a little bit
[1:12:10] and then there was this rope system tied
[1:12:12] to these pulleys and coming down on
[1:12:14] either side of this thing like this and
[1:12:15] and and if you look at this Bell sitting
[1:12:18] there it makes zero sound zero sound
[1:12:21] there's no sound coming off that Bell
[1:12:24] because it's not swinging
[1:12:26] right and it's such a nice
[1:12:29] quiet peaceful thing
[1:12:34] so restful but then you see this little
[1:12:36] guy he comes running up and he gets to
[1:12:39] the one side and he gets a hold of that
[1:12:41] rope
[1:12:41] why because his motive
[1:12:44] is to get that thing to make some noise
[1:12:47] so he gets a hold of that rope that's
[1:12:49] the only way he can make this Bell make
[1:12:51] a noise is you're going to put your
[1:12:53] hands to it it takes work
[1:12:55] right the Bell has no power in itself
[1:13:00] so what he does is he gets a hold of
[1:13:02] that rope and he starts talking on it
[1:13:03] like this but man this this is a big
[1:13:05] Bell this is a big rumor
[1:13:07] so he can't move it by himself so what
[1:13:10] does he do he calls friends over and so
[1:13:12] you know they start rallying together a
[1:13:13] little gossip group right so they get
[1:13:15] together maybe it's on Instagram or
[1:13:17] Facebook they get together and man now
[1:13:19] they've got some momentum right and man
[1:13:22] they get this thing moving and then they
[1:13:23] then they even coordinate right back and
[1:13:25] forth one
[1:13:27] two
[1:13:29] push pull right and they're going back
[1:13:32] and forth like this and before you know
[1:13:34] it Ding and you can see the cameraman is
[1:13:38] doing this
[1:13:39] it was so loud and it was so devastating
[1:13:43] and so prevalent that everything else
[1:13:45] became quiet and all you could hear was
[1:13:47] says dang
[1:13:50] dong
[1:13:52] ding
[1:13:54] and everybody's oh
[1:13:56] you know it's it's it's deafening
[1:14:02] the only way to make that thing stop
[1:14:04] dinging and donging
[1:14:07] is to let go of the Rope
[1:14:10] because it will not make any noise
[1:14:13] if you don't let it
[1:14:17] that's how forgiveness works
[1:14:20] it's a bell
[1:14:22] it's a bell that Rings Ding and dung and
[1:14:25] it shakes your whole life and it comes
[1:14:27] crashing down and it's predominant you
[1:14:31] can't hear anything else you cannot hear
[1:14:33] about the love of God you cannot hear
[1:14:35] about how you've been forgiven or how
[1:14:37] you've forgiven someone you can't hear
[1:14:38] any of those things this thing is so
[1:14:40] loud and it can be a false thing it can
[1:14:43] be false accusations it can be gossip
[1:14:45] rumors whatever it is it could be the
[1:14:47] devil
[1:14:49] probably mostly as the devil
[1:14:52] all you have to do is let go of the Rope
[1:14:58] let go of the Rope
[1:15:00] it might ding one more time might give
[1:15:03] another dong
[1:15:04] but it'll pass
[1:15:06] before you know that thing will just
[1:15:08] hang there lifeless
[1:15:11] because we have not given it any power
[1:15:15] we have not given it a voice
[1:15:32] he says I believe the same thing
[1:15:36] is it true of forgiveness when we
[1:15:38] forgive someone we take our hand off the
[1:15:40] Rope
[1:15:41] but if we've been talking at our
[1:15:42] grievances for a long time we mustn't be
[1:15:44] surprised if the old angry thoughts keep
[1:15:47] coming for a while they just they're
[1:15:50] just a ding dongs of the Old Bell
[1:15:52] slowing down and so it proved to be
[1:15:56] there were a few more midnight so it
[1:15:58] proved to be there were a few more
[1:16:00] midnight reverberations a couple of
[1:16:02] dings when the subject came up in my
[1:16:05] conversation but the force which was my
[1:16:08] willingness in the matter
[1:16:10] had gone out of them they came less and
[1:16:14] less often and at last stopped
[1:16:17] altogether
[1:16:19] so I discovered another secret of
[1:16:22] forgiveness
[1:16:23] that we can trust God not only above our
[1:16:26] emotions but also above our thoughts
[1:16:32] and still he had more to teach me
[1:16:35] man it goes deep right you sing with
[1:16:37] forgiveness
[1:16:39] even in the single episode many because
[1:16:42] many years later in 1970 an American
[1:16:44] with whom I had shared the ding dong
[1:16:46] principle came to visit me in Holland
[1:16:49] and met the people involved
[1:16:51] aren't those the friends who let you
[1:16:53] down he asked as they left my apartment
[1:16:56] thinking now watch this look how deep
[1:16:59] forgiveness goes thinking it's all
[1:17:01] settled let go of the Rope she's
[1:17:03] forgiven God has come in and has taken
[1:17:05] care of her emotions and her thoughts
[1:17:07] and all those things and here they are
[1:17:09] fellowshipping together she's they're in
[1:17:11] her home and here they're leaving the
[1:17:13] home
[1:17:14] and he asked us they left the apartment
[1:17:16] said yes
[1:17:18] aren't those the friends who let you
[1:17:20] down he asked if they left my apartment
[1:17:21] yes I said a little smugly you see it's
[1:17:26] all forgiven by you yes he said
[1:17:30] but what about them have they accepted
[1:17:33] your forgiveness
[1:17:35] they say there's nothing to forgive they
[1:17:38] deny it ever happened but I can prove it
[1:17:43] oh man
[1:17:44] that devil is Sly huh he's a slicker
[1:17:48] I know it's over again I can prove it
[1:17:52] I went eagerly to my desk I have it in
[1:17:55] black and white
[1:17:56] I saved all their letters and I can show
[1:17:59] you where
[1:18:03] right
[1:18:05] Corey my friend slipped his arm through
[1:18:07] mine and gently closed the drawer aren't
[1:18:10] you the one whose sins are at the bottom
[1:18:12] of the sea
[1:18:13] and are the sins of your friends etched
[1:18:16] in black and white
[1:18:19] and that's good you see how deep this
[1:18:22] goes we keep a record
[1:18:25] we can't help it we want to protect
[1:18:27] ourselves because what if this comes up
[1:18:29] in the future I need to defend myself I
[1:18:31] need to justify myself no you don't
[1:18:34] just let it go bury it
[1:18:37] bury it in the bottom of the sea where
[1:18:40] your sins have been buried
[1:18:42] you know it's it's amazing Jesus stood
[1:18:45] in front of his accusers and he answered
[1:18:47] not a word
[1:18:49] he could have said a lot of things he
[1:18:52] could have Justified himself he did not
[1:18:53] say a word when someone accuses you my
[1:18:56] brown sister is just a trap you don't
[1:18:57] have to answer
[1:18:59] you don't have to get involved you can
[1:19:01] let it go and when you let go don't keep
[1:19:04] a record of the event
[1:19:09] for an anguishing moment I could not
[1:19:12] find my voice Lord Jesus I whispered at
[1:19:14] last
[1:19:15] who takes all my sins away forgive me
[1:19:18] for preserving all these years the
[1:19:20] evidence against others
[1:19:22] give me Grace to burn all the blacks and
[1:19:25] whites as a sweet smelling sacrifice to
[1:19:28] your glory
[1:19:30] I think we just need to have a little
[1:19:32] bonfire here this morning
[1:19:33] and we can just come and lay all our
[1:19:35] thoughts here we can just lay all of our
[1:19:37] our little blacks and whites and put
[1:19:40] them in the fire today and just walk
[1:19:41] away and just say Lord I am not strong
[1:19:44] enough
[1:19:45] not strong enough to handle those things
[1:19:47] I'm just going to give it to you
[1:19:52] I did not go to sleep that night until I
[1:19:55] had gone through my desk and pulled out
[1:19:57] those letters curling now with age and
[1:20:00] fed them all into my little coal burning
[1:20:02] great as the Flames leaped and glowed so
[1:20:05] did my heart
[1:20:08] forgive us our trespasses
[1:20:11] Jesus taught us to pray as we forgive
[1:20:14] those who trespass against us
[1:20:17] in the ashes of those letters I was
[1:20:19] seeing yet another facet of his Mercy
[1:20:21] what more he would teach me about
[1:20:23] forgiveness in the days ahead I didn't
[1:20:25] know but tonight's a good
[1:20:28] tonight was good news enough
[1:20:31] when we bring our sins to Jesus he not
[1:20:34] only forgives them he makes them as if
[1:20:36] they had never been
[1:20:40] let's Stand Together
[1:20:43] second Timothy 1 and 7
[1:20:46] says for God hath not given us a spirit
[1:20:48] of fear but of power and of love
[1:20:53] and of a sound mind
[1:20:55] amen
[1:20:57] we know that little song the goodness of
[1:20:59] God
[1:21:01] all my life he has been faithful
[1:21:04] we have tasted of the goodness of God
[1:21:06] that song has become just very special
[1:21:08] to me
[1:21:09] because I have tasted I can Rejoice
[1:21:13] because of the goodness of God
[1:21:16] when you see what he has done for you it
[1:21:19] should be easy to do that for someone
[1:21:21] else
[1:21:21] but you see it can be so deeply rooted
[1:21:25] that that we don't notice it we don't
[1:21:27] notice that we have kept record we don't
[1:21:29] notice we think we're properly forgiven
[1:21:32] and let go of something but I would
[1:21:34] encourage each and every one of us
[1:21:35] tonight
[1:21:36] just take a moment and just say Lord is
[1:21:39] there something there
[1:21:40] is there a root is there a is there a
[1:21:42] root of bitterness is there a is there a
[1:21:45] letter is there an account
[1:21:47] is there a record that I'm keeping in my
[1:21:49] heart I don't want to keep it anymore I
[1:21:52] don't have room for this
[1:21:54] life is busy enough we've got children
[1:21:56] I've got grandchildren I've got families
[1:21:58] I've got a spouse I've got a job I don't
[1:22:01] have room for all this bitterness I
[1:22:02] don't have room for all this hatred and
[1:22:04] Malice and strife and frustration I just
[1:22:07] want to be
[1:22:08] basking in your love I just want to have
[1:22:11] peace I just want to have love and joy
[1:22:16] see the devil has tricked us into this
[1:22:18] engaging Us in justifying and
[1:22:21] categorizing and criticizing we don't
[1:22:24] have to engage on the battlefield
[1:22:25] anymore we just walk away Satan you can
[1:22:28] have it
[1:22:29] and good luck
[1:22:31] huh because it's all been put to the
[1:22:33] bottom of the ocean you're fighting
[1:22:35] you're beating at thin air
[1:22:38] because I have forgiven them
[1:22:41] isn't that incredible
[1:22:43] you hold the power to forgive someone
[1:22:46] and to set them free
[1:22:50] Capstone Ministry coming down on the
[1:22:53] bride I think we're getting down to
[1:22:55] those final moments where the bride
[1:22:58] recognizes who she is and the power that
[1:23:00] she has received
[1:23:02] we don't have to live with complexes
[1:23:05] you know it's a it's a day where there's
[1:23:08] so many pressures and complexes and
[1:23:10] insecurities and stripes and and people
[1:23:13] just seem to be going wild and crazy but
[1:23:16] not the bride it doesn't make an excuse
[1:23:18] for us to suddenly go crazy and wild and
[1:23:21] we're frustrated and we start saying
[1:23:23] those things I'm so frustrated I'm so
[1:23:25] I'm so pressured I am so you know this
[1:23:27] I'm so that well you're confessing the
[1:23:29] wrong thing
[1:23:31] greater is he that is in me than he that
[1:23:33] is in the world his grace is sufficient
[1:23:36] for me he chose to love me first I am
[1:23:39] dead in Christ Jesus amen if you believe
[1:23:42] in the Lord Jesus Christ on the house
[1:23:43] shall be saved these are the things that
[1:23:45] are in in the bride's lips
[1:23:47] and in our hearts
[1:23:49] but see the devil has tried to trick us
[1:23:52] into building up
[1:23:55] walls
[1:23:57] divisions
[1:23:59] and all we have to do all we have to do
[1:24:01] today we don't have to sort it out there
[1:24:03] doesn't have to be a court of appeal or
[1:24:06] justifications or anything you hold the
[1:24:09] power to forgive it
[1:24:10] and bury that thing and you know what
[1:24:12] you do is you take all the power away
[1:24:14] from the enemy
[1:24:17] and then when that Devil Comes you can
[1:24:18] say Satan you have no power here the
[1:24:20] judge has ruled on this case
[1:24:23] and I agree with him
