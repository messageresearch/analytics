[0:00] Ephesians chapter 1 starting at verse
[0:03] 18. the eyes of your understanding being
[0:06] enlightened that ye may know what is the
[0:10] hope of his calling and what is the
[0:12] riches of the glory of his inheritance
[0:15] in the Saints and what is the exceeding
[0:18] greatness of his power to us word who
[0:21] believe according to the working of his
[0:23] mighty power which he wrought in Christ
[0:26] when he raised him from the dead can you
[0:30] say Amen so this power is what raised
[0:33] Jesus from the dead when he raised him
[0:35] from the dead and set him in his own in
[0:39] his own right hand in Heavenly places
[0:42] far above all principality and power and
[0:46] might and dominion and every name that
[0:50] is named not only in this world but also
[0:53] in that which is to come and hath put
[0:56] all things under his feet and gave him
[0:59] to be the head dead over all things to
[1:01] the church which is his body the
[1:04] fullness of him that filleth all in all
[1:08] praise be to God God is good this
[1:10] morning Heavenly Father we thank you for
[1:12] this Easter morning Lord we are
[1:14] rejoicing in what you have done for us
[1:16] and Lord we don't want it to be just a
[1:19] symbol or just some type of traditional
[1:21] thing that we look at but Lord we want
[1:24] the power that came from the
[1:26] resurrection to be living in US Lord God
[1:29] I pray that would be possible for every
[1:31] soul under the sound of our voice this
[1:33] morning and not only here but on the
[1:35] internet I pray whoever hears us that
[1:37] Lord I would have your anointing to
[1:39] speak words of encouragement Words of
[1:41] Life Words of Power Lord for we come not
[1:44] to the people with enticing words of
[1:46] man's Wisdom but with power and
[1:49] demonstration of what this word can do
[1:51] and Lord we live with testimonies all
[1:53] the time of what you're doing in the
[1:55] people of God around the world and here
[1:57] locally father so we know that you're
[1:59] Alive the song says you asked me how I
[2:03] know he lives he lives within my heart
[2:05] God that's the proof as we have
[2:07] something real within us we pray you'll
[2:09] bless every heart that's here this
[2:11] morning and encourage every life every
[2:13] family as we commit Our Lives to you
[2:15] this Easter morning in Jesus name we ask
[2:17] him amen God bless you may be seated
[2:20] this morning
[2:21] appreciated the the kids singing that
[2:24] such a joy to all of us and little
[2:25] Israel my my uh nephew there and he had
[2:30] his thumb up which complimented the song
[2:32] very well he's thumbs up amen we got the
[2:35] when we have Jesus we have joy
[2:38] blessed be his name
[2:40] praise the Lord today we celebrate the
[2:43] morning that our Lord rose from the
[2:45] grave and it's celebrated around the
[2:48] world and we're thankful for that we're
[2:50] thankful that people in the world
[2:52] acknowledge a lot of people acknowledge
[2:54] that he rose again there's some who
[2:56] don't believe it some that need proof
[2:58] and but there's some who are believers
[3:00] that believe he rose and this is the day
[3:02] that most of the world gives to
[3:04] celebrate the Lord raising from the
[3:06] grave and coming out of the grave and
[3:09] that when he come out of the Grave was a
[3:11] final Vindication and proof that he was
[3:15] truly everything that the word said
[3:17] about him that was the Vindication that
[3:21] was the proof that he was truly
[3:23] everything the word said about him there
[3:25] had to be a a proof to it uh we can say
[3:28] a lot of things but then people wait for
[3:30] the proof Jesus said things but he had
[3:33] the proof and he followed up with
[3:34] Vindication and so when he rose that was
[3:37] everything that was the Vindication and
[3:39] that was the proof that truly all the
[3:42] word had said about him uh and what he
[3:44] had proclaimed while he was on the earth
[3:46] in a Ministry three and a half years
[3:47] what he had proclaimed it came to pass
[3:50] and he said in three days if you
[3:51] destroyed this body if you if you put
[3:53] this in the ground if you destroy this
[3:55] temple in three days I'll raise it up
[3:58] again and he proved what he said was
[3:59] true let me say something to everybody
[4:01] this morning God has never failed when
[4:04] he speaks something
[4:06] God has never failed his word and it
[4:09] always has come to pass and it always
[4:11] will God has a perfect track record
[4:14] people will fail you and you may have a
[4:16] lack of trust in people but we can trust
[4:18] God because his word has always come to
[4:20] pass and the resurrection is the proof
[4:23] of that at what Jesus said and what the
[4:25] word said he would do we know that it
[4:28] came to pass and we're celebrating that
[4:30] this morning we we want to go into the
[4:32] subject a little bit what Paul says here
[4:33] in Ephesians and uh by the world knowing
[4:37] that it's the Resurrection Sunday we
[4:39] also know some other things at least
[4:40] most of us we know that Jesus uh was
[4:44] both humanity and Divinity together how
[4:47] many believe that
[4:49] Jesus was both humanity and Divinity
[4:52] together as one man and uh we realize
[4:56] that the Bible says that the fullness
[4:58] the fullness of the godhead bodily was
[5:01] in his bodily in other words all of God
[5:04] was poured into that vessel and and so
[5:07] people don't understand and I'll just
[5:08] saying to you don't try to figure that
[5:10] out don't try to figure it out in your
[5:12] own mind anyway because when you try to
[5:14] figure out a man that has full Divinity
[5:17] and fully a man don't try to figure it
[5:20] out because you're going to get it all
[5:21] messed up
[5:22] hence niacia 325 A.D they got it messed
[5:26] up they were trying to figure out how
[5:28] God was in man and when man gets his
[5:31] intellect that's how we get messed up
[5:33] with splitting him into three different
[5:34] persons let me tell you don't try to
[5:37] figure that out with your mind ask God
[5:39] for a revelation of it can I get an amen
[5:42] this morning it comes by Revelation that
[5:44] we would even come close to
[5:46] understanding how man was full Divinity
[5:49] and how he's full humanity and so we
[5:51] know that but we also know that at the
[5:54] end of Jesus life there uh there was a
[5:58] very much of The Human Side displayed as
[6:01] a matter of fact as he come to the last
[6:03] days of his life and the last hours of
[6:06] his life if you know your Bible you
[6:08] realize Jesus when he come to the very
[6:09] end there was very much human in it when
[6:13] he come to the tragic court case when he
[6:16] was accused in court he was an innocent
[6:18] man and he was falsely accused when he
[6:21] come to the brutal treatment of his body
[6:23] when he come to the crucifixion and in a
[6:26] few moments I might elaborate on that a
[6:28] little bit knowing that it was Good
[6:29] Friday this past Friday and we we look
[6:31] at that we want to understand those
[6:33] things but his life at the end came to a
[6:36] turn that even the disciples didn't
[6:37] understand with the brutality and the
[6:40] crucifixion and the scourging and the
[6:42] mocking and the making fun of and he he
[6:45] lived the the last days of his life and
[6:48] you can't find God in any of it now
[6:51] early in his life when he started his
[6:52] ministry you could find God the
[6:54] supernatural God was working through his
[6:56] words in other words he'd speak and the
[6:58] blind eyes would be open he would touch
[7:00] people and they'd be completely healed
[7:02] numerous Miracles took place in the
[7:04] Supernatural God was speaking to him God
[7:06] brought him up to the Mount
[7:07] Transfiguration and said this is my son
[7:10] in whom I'm pleased to dwell so God was
[7:12] there but at the end of his life there's
[7:14] not many traces of God because God
[7:17] actually he was there but he withdrew
[7:20] himself because this man had Dakota
[7:22] Calvary as our lamb and he had to go to
[7:25] Calvary as a man because God couldn't be
[7:29] killed
[7:32] can you say man
[7:34] God could not see be displayed in our
[7:36] eyes anyway in this defeat in this
[7:38] scourging and and we know the story is
[7:41] that the disciples are wondering and and
[7:43] they're saying even in the I think the
[7:44] garden can say can't you to call for
[7:47] help all the soldiers everybody's taking
[7:49] count your Coffer up and Jesus said
[7:51] don't you think that I can call for
[7:53] thousands of Legions of angels and they
[7:55] would come and change us and he said but
[7:57] that the scripture might fulfill so that
[7:59] there was an obedience to what the Bible
[8:02] said can you say Amen had to be
[8:05] fulfilled and in that moment God
[8:08] as in our terms withdrew himself
[8:12] and so we we know that it was God in man
[8:16] but yet we see this this withdrawal
[8:19] because he had to go to Calvary as our
[8:22] lamb and uh in the last hours in the
[8:25] very last hours he even with went
[8:27] without any intervention of God at the
[8:30] cross there wasn't any intervention of
[8:31] God we're saying God God don't let this
[8:34] happen but you see the scripture had to
[8:36] be fulfilled and we had to be saved
[8:40] we needed a sacrifice
[8:44] you couldn't do it on your you weren't
[8:45] worthy enough
[8:46] no man was worthy enough
[8:50] somebody had to do it for us
[8:52] and so that's the reason there was no
[8:54] intervention of God in this act is
[8:56] because and in fact in fact he was so
[8:59] much left alone that he cried himself at
[9:03] the cross my God my God why has Thou
[9:07] forsaken me
[9:09] you remember he said that
[9:11] so this is evidence that he is feeling
[9:13] it he knows and he's crying out why have
[9:16] you forsaken that's the man crying out
[9:19] because he had to live in that moment
[9:21] that he felt forsaken even by God I'd
[9:24] ask for a raise of hands this morning
[9:26] how many has felt that way yourself
[9:30] he had to live where he's saying God why
[9:33] have you forsaken me God where are you
[9:35] God why and in the worldly terms the
[9:39] last of Jesus life felt like a defeat
[9:42] over and over again there was no God in
[9:44] it it felt defeated it was defeat in
[9:47] Man's eyes but she seen this morning let
[9:49] the record show that The Final End was
[9:53] not defeat and that's why we talk about
[9:55] the resurrection because as much defeat
[9:58] was there as much as God hath withdrawn
[10:01] himself I like the song that the choir
[10:04] is saying Jehovah Jehovah has the final
[10:07] say
[10:09] can I get an amen this morning
[10:12] and I'm glad to say that the final end
[10:14] was not a defeat but the final win was a
[10:16] victory
[10:19] the final end was not all of this uh
[10:22] being forsaken by God but you see the
[10:25] the there was not a defeat but when when
[10:29] the body was dead and in the grave and
[10:31] that was it and in a dark uh a cold uh
[10:35] grave with a stone road in front of it
[10:37] the power of God moved on that body and
[10:41] resurrected that body can you say praise
[10:43] the Lord
[10:44] Jehovah had the final say
[10:48] I just want to say to you
[10:50] when God's involved
[10:52] he'll have the final say of every every
[10:55] situation
[10:57] of every condition
[11:00] come on I should have get a bigger amen
[11:02] than that I know when you're dark and
[11:04] under a tunnel of something and under
[11:06] just under something it's hard for you
[11:07] to say Amen to that but you should say
[11:09] Amen because God has a perfect track
[11:11] record and when he's involved he gets
[11:13] the final say and I can tell you he's
[11:16] going to cause us to end in Victory
[11:19] and if he did it at the cross and he did
[11:21] it here in Jesus life then we find that
[11:24] there was a power and this is what he
[11:26] says in Ephesians there was a power that
[11:29] come upon and set Jesus it was so
[11:31] powerful that he'd come on his body and
[11:33] raised him from the dead far above
[11:36] principality has been in power so there
[11:38] was the power that raised him and and he
[11:41] did not just raise out of the graves and
[11:45] and then walk back into the same
[11:47] conditions again did you realize when
[11:49] God raised it when the power of God
[11:51] raised him up he did not just come back
[11:54] to earth again now we know that he
[11:56] walked a few days on Earth but this
[11:58] power did not keep him this power he
[12:00] actually went to hell he he he seen the
[12:03] soul preached to the souls in prison but
[12:05] then the power was down still on him he
[12:07] raised he raised past the grave he
[12:10] raised past the Earth he didn't come
[12:12] back into the same conditions again can
[12:14] you say man then the Bible says he
[12:17] raised far above and that's my message
[12:19] to you this morning when God raised him
[12:21] he raised far above the conditions again
[12:23] far above the Earth can you say Amen far
[12:26] above defeat somebody say praise the
[12:28] Lord
[12:29] how far did he raise him above
[12:31] principalities of both Powers he broke
[12:34] through every demonic Dimension can you
[12:36] say man this power was powerful enough
[12:39] to break through anything
[12:42] how far did he raise him above
[12:44] principality above power above might
[12:46] Dominion every name that is named the
[12:48] most famous name we've ever had in the
[12:50] world the Caesars even famous names
[12:52] today God raised his name above every
[12:54] name
[12:56] not only in this world but also in the
[12:58] world to come and have put all things
[13:01] under his feet I'm telling you this
[13:05] power raised him far above everything
[13:11] I should close and we should shout the
[13:14] rest of the day
[13:16] why because I find that the same power
[13:19] that raised Jesus from the dead is the
[13:22] same power that's in a holy ghost
[13:24] believer's life
[13:26] you're going to tell me you can't raise
[13:27] out of situations you're going to tell
[13:29] me there's some situation that's too
[13:30] impossible you're going to tell your my
[13:32] situation is different my hurt my pain
[13:35] everything is different you're going to
[13:36] tell me that you can't tell me that
[13:38] because this power has power to raise
[13:41] above far above all things somebody say
[13:44] praise this Lord praise the Lord
[13:46] and so now he didn't just raise out of
[13:49] the Grave he didn't walk back into the
[13:51] same conditions which reminds me of some
[13:53] people that come to church and hear the
[13:55] power of God and don't respond and walk
[13:58] back into the same conditions again
[14:01] might be a lesson for us people do that
[14:04] out of habit because some people are
[14:06] comfortable there was a man that was
[14:08] prayed for by Brother Branham and he was
[14:11] he was temporarily delivered of demons
[14:13] that he was ready to destroy brother
[14:15] Branham and when he prayed for him the
[14:17] man fell at his feet and he was
[14:19] delivered but he was temporarily
[14:21] delivered he said he'll go back and take
[14:24] that Spirit again because he worships
[14:26] that spirit
[14:28] so the power of God was there to make a
[14:31] total Deliverance
[14:33] but he had become so accustomed to the
[14:35] spirit that he walked back into the same
[14:38] condition again he went back and fed on
[14:40] the same things again and invited that
[14:43] Spirit back how many know the Bible says
[14:45] as Jesus talked about he says a man he
[14:48] said he the house can be cleaned
[14:50] and when the house is Sanctified because
[14:52] the sanctification isn't enough
[14:57] I could use a little bit more help this
[14:59] morning
[15:00] sanctification isn't enough got a lot of
[15:03] people that come under the presence of
[15:05] God get Sanctified they feel good they
[15:06] feel better their Spirits have been
[15:08] released from them but that's not the
[15:09] final step can you say Amen
[15:12] he walks through Dry places and if you
[15:14] don't get that house filled seven other
[15:17] demons will come and fill that I'm
[15:19] speaking about what Jesus said that's
[15:21] how it works and so I'll tell you Jesus
[15:23] was not just raised back to Earthly
[15:26] conditions if he'd have showed up the
[15:28] same way they would have continued the
[15:30] persecution they would have continued
[15:31] the things and all that he was doing
[15:33] being persecuted of but I can tell you
[15:36] God had to raise them above the
[15:39] persecution above the defeat above
[15:42] Earthly conditions
[15:44] far above how many this morning
[15:47] got things that you've been through and
[15:49] you'd like to be lifted far above those
[15:52] things
[15:54] five of us all right praise the Lord
[15:56] that's enough I'll preach to you five
[16:01] praise the Lord
[16:03] he didn't just raise all the grave
[16:05] he didn't walk back into the same
[16:06] conditions the power of Resurrection
[16:08] moved in actually in a place far above
[16:11] all things to a position at the right
[16:14] hand of authority of God in a place
[16:17] called
[16:18] Heavenly places
[16:21] this is where the power of God that took
[16:25] the dead body of Jesus and raised him
[16:28] far above defeat and raised him past
[16:32] principalities far above and placed them
[16:35] in a place called Heavenly places
[16:39] and we've been taught by the word of God
[16:41] that that is not a feeling it's not a
[16:44] sensation I love the presence of God I
[16:47] feel I felt it I know that it's real but
[16:49] when he said Heavenly places it's not a
[16:52] feeling it's not that it gives us
[16:53] tingles can you say man the prophet has
[16:56] taught us that the Heavenly places is
[16:58] the believer's position in Jesus Christ
[17:02] somebody say praise the Lord
[17:05] he lifted Jesus to Heavenly places and I
[17:09] don't know if anybody noticed uh and
[17:11] scanned while I was reading about Jesus
[17:14] coming to Heaven places you probably
[17:15] didn't read it but I'm going to bring it
[17:17] up if you got your Bibles and if you
[17:18] don't you're they're gonna have to bring
[17:19] it up back there I want you to go to
[17:21] Ephesians 1 back a few verses to verse 3
[17:25] where it says blessed be the God and
[17:29] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath
[17:31] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[17:36] in Heavenly places in Christ
[17:44] did anybody notice that the same place
[17:47] Jesus was raised to is the same place
[17:49] Paul's teaching that every believer who
[17:52] has the Holy Ghost has been raised into
[17:54] Heavenly places
[17:56] we got the same position and guess what
[17:58] most Christians don't know it
[18:01] most Christians live below their
[18:03] privileges now I want to emphasize that
[18:04] because below your privileges is not
[18:06] where you're supposed to be living
[18:11] young people everybody below your
[18:13] privilege privileges is not where you're
[18:15] supposed to be living and the prophets
[18:17] of the church the church is living way
[18:20] below its privileges
[18:22] but my Bible says he raised them far
[18:25] above
[18:27] not below not leveling out on Earth
[18:31] not leveling out that we're scared of
[18:34] demons but it raised him above with his
[18:36] authority over demons it raised him
[18:39] above any name that's a that's been in
[18:42] heaven past present and future it raised
[18:45] him to Heavenly places that all things
[18:48] were placed under his feet and if that's
[18:52] the place Heavenly places it is and he
[18:55] said in Ephesians 1 3 that that's the
[18:57] place a Believer is his position in
[19:00] Christ then we ought to say it don't
[19:02] look like it in my life it doesn't look
[19:04] like it but that's where I am standing
[19:07] this morning
[19:12] Hallelujah whether you respond a lot or
[19:14] not I'm going to give the devil a black
[19:16] eye today this is a really good day to
[19:18] do it for me
[19:20] there's a lot of things that come in
[19:22] life that if you were to look at my
[19:23] heart behind the pulpit this morning and
[19:25] behind my heart I'm grieving I'm in
[19:28] mourning for the conditions of this
[19:31] world for the conditions of families
[19:33] for the devil's attack to our children
[19:35] and our young people
[19:37] if you were to look at my heart
[19:39] I'm grieving this morning
[19:42] I cried half the night I'm being honest
[19:44] with you but I'm going to stand here and
[19:47] bring the preaching of the resurrected
[19:49] power of God because it is our only hope
[19:52] and if I could help some help this
[19:54] morning I'll continue to give the devil
[19:56] a black eye
[20:00] the Saints are moved to the same place
[20:02] did anybody know that that the
[20:05] progression of science has been a type
[20:08] of the spiritual advancement of the
[20:10] church anybody remember that we came
[20:12] through in science the horse muggy days
[20:14] and of course that didn't take very much
[20:16] to develop of science we found a thing
[20:18] to ride horse and buggy and so that was
[20:19] Luther's day of justification then we
[20:22] come the church moved to Lutheran
[20:24] justification that was the horse and
[20:25] Bugattis and then we have the automobile
[20:27] developed uh I believe in the early
[20:29] 1900s that was Wesley's day we come to
[20:31] the message of sanctification and so the
[20:34] church moved along with the advancements
[20:36] of science we come into the automobile
[20:37] and that was that was fast boy the horse
[20:40] and buggy was slow the automobile was
[20:42] fast
[20:43] of course we got to stay within the
[20:45] speed limit
[20:46] amen
[20:48] only five amens on that too it's really
[20:51] strange
[20:53] but then we come to the airplane
[20:56] developed by science and so we move from
[20:58] the horse and buggy we moved to the
[21:01] automobile then we moved to the airplane
[21:03] and all of this is an advancement of the
[21:06] church and where it's come Luther Wesley
[21:08] Pentecost was the airplane I'm telling
[21:11] you anybody who's back in those days was
[21:12] flying high the shouting of the
[21:15] rejoicing the the gifts returned to the
[21:17] church my you talk about flying high and
[21:19] we look like we've come the highest we'd
[21:21] ever come but guess what science didn't
[21:23] stay with airplane
[21:26] then we come into the astronaut age
[21:29] which is Way Beyond what an airplane
[21:31] could go
[21:33] first man on the moon this this
[21:35] generation can you say amount taking uh
[21:38] isolated and taking a few people up and
[21:41] so now as the church has moved from the
[21:44] Pentecostal age to advancing into the
[21:46] astronaut age then we realized we're
[21:48] moving God is moving the church far
[21:51] beyond what we ever dreamed nobody would
[21:53] ever dream what we'd be Have astronauts
[21:55] nobody would ever dream we'd go to the
[21:57] Moon can you say amen and now science is
[21:59] investing more and more and more and all
[22:02] of it is to move Higher and Higher and
[22:04] if it says that in science then that's
[22:07] what God is doing in the church in the
[22:09] bride we're not staying in Pentecost
[22:11] we're not staying in Luther's day
[22:13] anybody that believes those churches and
[22:16] go to those are churches God bless you
[22:17] believe with all your heart all the
[22:19] truth God has given by high as the
[22:21] gospel Minister have to tell you there's
[22:23] more truth than justification there's
[22:25] more truth than Wesley's message there's
[22:27] more truth in what the charismatics has
[22:29] God has restored much more than that and
[22:32] the purpose is is to take the church
[22:34] Higher and Higher and Higher and Higher
[22:37] this is the eagle age
[22:39] the eagle flies higher than any other
[22:41] bird I like an eagle's view of things
[22:45] I don't want to be an Earthbound animal
[22:48] I don't want to be some animal that's on
[22:50] the earth that's all I ever see I want
[22:52] to be in this Eagle age
[22:54] I want to be looking far above so you
[22:56] know uh so did you know that science is
[22:59] working very hard and is there really is
[23:02] there
[23:03] to make
[23:04] being an astronaut and going into space
[23:06] available
[23:07] to anyone
[23:09] whosoever will
[23:13] did you know that
[23:15] the Tesla guy who I think he's already
[23:17] been up a few but listen now even though
[23:20] it's going to be offered eventually to
[23:21] everyone right now it's a very Selected
[23:24] Few
[23:26] that get to go on these little trips
[23:29] now friends I'm talking about
[23:30] spiritually now
[23:32] he's not calling the entire church world
[23:34] to these higher Realms in Christ he's
[23:37] calling the bride
[23:40] if you want to go there with him and
[23:42] you've got The Bravery of the Holy Ghost
[23:44] he'll take you to higher Heights this
[23:46] morning or you can stay where you're at
[23:50] but did you know that they're they want
[23:52] they're taking people and and not just
[23:54] astronauts now that's trained they're
[23:56] they're taking anybody basically who's
[23:58] rich and uh
[24:00] it's all the type here we're not in
[24:02] Luther's day we're not in Pentecost
[24:04] today but the power of the Resurrection
[24:06] moves the church far above currently it
[24:09] is only I looked this up just to show
[24:11] that I did my homework
[24:14] currently I said I wonder what what
[24:16] they're doing with this after who gets
[24:18] to go currently it's only available to
[24:20] those who can spend an average of 250
[24:23] 000 to 500 000 for a sub orbital trips
[24:28] and so and that's only about 15 a
[24:31] 15-minute ride to the edge of space and
[24:34] back so you're going to pay 250 000 to
[24:36] 500 000 for a 15-minute trip just to the
[24:40] edge of space but that's where we're at
[24:42] it's not just astronaut and astronauts
[24:44] if you got that kind of money Stevie
[24:48] it's kind of a goal isn't it
[24:51] yeah start a savings plan
[24:54] you know if you want to do it and save
[24:57] the money it's offered not just assets
[24:59] and so now and then and then they say or
[25:02] flights they're going to offer flights
[25:03] to actual orbit to go into space for
[25:07] more than 50 million percent
[25:11] though typically a longer trip than 15
[25:14] minutes so you get to get longer into
[25:16] the heavenlies as an astronaut and you
[25:18] don't have to be an astronaut
[25:21] you don't have to be you don't have to
[25:24] be a popular person to be in the kingdom
[25:27] of God
[25:29] can you say man you don't have to have
[25:32] the right clothes you don't have to have
[25:34] a lot of riches can you say Amen to soar
[25:37] into the heavenlies by the Holy Ghost
[25:39] come in say Amen praise the Lord but you
[25:42] see now that's what the world is
[25:43] advancing in so now 50 million dollars
[25:46] per seat and so you have to say right
[25:48] now it's a select few who are rich but I
[25:51] can say to you in the name of the Lord
[25:53] God has made this very affordable to
[25:57] only Believers this morning he's made it
[25:59] very it is is a very select few it costs
[26:02] a lot to do it but but God has made it
[26:04] available for you to soar by the power
[26:07] of the Resurrection into the heavenlies
[26:09] this morning God has made it affordable
[26:12] for you because he paid the price at
[26:15] Calvary for the trip
[26:19] Hallelujah
[26:21] I'm having a good time I don't know
[26:23] about you but listen he's paid for our
[26:25] trip and he's made it affordable for me
[26:27] and you don't wanna you wanna know how
[26:28] to get there be filled with the Holy
[26:31] Ghost
[26:33] not religion
[26:34] now just sanctified
[26:37] God fill me with the genuine Holy Ghost
[26:44] not do's and don'ts not just wearing all
[26:46] the right things fill me with the full
[26:48] Holy Ghost convert me change me Lord
[26:51] change my heart change my desires
[26:54] and when he feels you you come under
[26:57] Ephesians 1 which is the Saints because
[27:00] it's to the Saints it's not to everybody
[27:02] else but he blows our minds and it says
[27:04] to the Saints God has already given us
[27:08] spiritual blessings in Christ Jesus in
[27:11] Heavenly places
[27:15] and I didn't have to pay 50 million for
[27:16] it
[27:18] I just had to give my life over to
[27:20] Christ
[27:22] he's made it affordable for everybody
[27:26] you ought to be blessed for that you
[27:28] have to pay 50 million a seat for this
[27:29] you don't have to you've got to
[27:31] surrender your life to Jesus Christ
[27:32] completely I'm sold out locked Stock and
[27:35] Barrel he has my life he has everything
[27:37] Change Me Lord
[27:39] [Music]
[27:41] I can't do that for you your parents
[27:43] can't do that for you
[27:45] your husband can't do that for you your
[27:47] wife can't do that for you your pastor
[27:49] can't do that for you it's when you get
[27:51] serious to God and say I need this Holy
[27:54] Spirit in my life I need you to change
[27:56] me Lord
[27:58] and then you fall under this thing
[27:59] you're being lifted by the power of God
[28:01] into Heavenly places into Heavenly
[28:05] places
[28:07] to rise far above the lust of this Earth
[28:10] to rise far above the dark grave and
[28:14] conditions that are around us now if you
[28:16] have your Bible still open to Ephesians
[28:18] I'll read that verse 18 Again Paul says
[28:20] the eyes of your understanding being
[28:22] enlightened
[28:23] that ye may know things that you may
[28:26] know and I'm going to list three things
[28:27] that we know by him enlightening our
[28:29] eyes because really you know what it's
[28:31] all about
[28:33] what we can see spiritually that's why
[28:35] he said your eyes will need to be
[28:37] enlightened first before you understand
[28:40] your position in Heavenly places God
[28:42] needs to open your eyes and guess what
[28:44] there's not much joy as the kids were
[28:46] singing about this morning there's not
[28:48] much joy if you don't see your position
[28:50] in Jesus Christ
[28:52] because you know what you see you know
[28:54] what you always look at
[28:56] which isn't any Joy at all
[28:59] conditions of life
[29:01] family conditions and this life has
[29:04] temporal joys
[29:06] you get a nice truck you get a nice
[29:09] uh return on your taxes
[29:12] and then it's gone within hours
[29:15] temporal Joy so excited about that
[29:19] and by Wednesday where'd it go
[29:22] it's temporal
[29:24] this world will give you temporal Joys
[29:26] Jesus said I give you Joy not as the
[29:29] world I give you peace not as the world
[29:31] gives it so that shows the world can
[29:33] give a peace the world can give Joys but
[29:36] they're not Eternal they're not lasting
[29:38] not true joy and so now when your eyes
[29:40] are open to what were you really stand
[29:43] and I want you to catch this statement
[29:45] there's a difference in your standing in
[29:48] Christ and the state that you're in
[29:52] your standing is different than your
[29:55] state
[29:57] what state are you in well it's Michigan
[29:59] right now
[30:01] but the state your life is the state
[30:03] state your life is in the state your
[30:06] family is in right now the state that
[30:09] your marriage is in right now I can tell
[30:11] you it's a good thing your state is not
[30:14] the same as you're standing with the
[30:16] Lord
[30:18] my business is falling apart my my life
[30:21] seems like my head's about to burst
[30:24] because of the pressure all these
[30:26] conditions of this generation addiction
[30:28] I want to preach in the next few weeks
[30:30] about addictions addictions is the the
[30:32] number one thing in our nation people
[30:34] are addicted and don't just think it's
[30:35] the drug drug addict a lot of us get
[30:37] addicted to things and I want to give
[30:40] the reason why because I want to expose
[30:41] the enemy we're not called to live in
[30:43] addictions can you say Amen we have a
[30:46] joy in the fountain of the Holy Ghost
[30:47] that's far beyond any kind of drug
[30:50] but it's given by addictions and the
[30:53] state this world is and the state your
[30:54] life is in is not the same as you're
[30:57] standing in the Lord
[31:00] but if you're only looking at the state
[31:02] and not looking at your standing you
[31:04] will find no joy in that
[31:07] it will be
[31:09] grueling it will be everyday negative it
[31:12] will be ups and downs can you say Amen
[31:15] it will be you don't know what's coming
[31:16] to you tomorrow
[31:18] you don't know what's going to hit your
[31:19] family tomorrow can I get an amen
[31:21] oh I know I know I've got it all planned
[31:23] out and I've cushioned I've got cushion
[31:25] here and cushion here I got this life
[31:27] insurance policy and I got it and so any
[31:29] little bumps boom I can just bump bump
[31:32] bump against this cushion you don't have
[31:34] any cushion you don't have any Security
[31:36] in any job in any government can you say
[31:39] a man because God all he has to do is
[31:41] rip the cushion out
[31:43] and you're gonna fall
[31:46] there is no Eternal Joy there is no true
[31:49] joy in this in the state that we're in
[31:51] and the state of the world has come in
[31:54] its very worse with demons Powers Rising
[31:57] oh God Deliver Us from this place I pray
[32:00] bring this rapturing faith in our souls
[32:03] we need to get out of here can you say
[32:05] Amen if you don't feel that in your soul
[32:07] pray for the Holy Ghost because my soul
[32:10] is saying I'm tired of this world I'm
[32:12] tired of the perversion I'm tired of the
[32:14] perverts
[32:16] and I know it's the devil on them but
[32:18] I'm tired in the last two months the
[32:20] news says this increase you know what it
[32:22] is this increase in the perverts and
[32:25] perversions it's such you know what's
[32:26] happening that unconverted Soul that's
[32:30] laying there with all these demons that
[32:31] he's fed on for years movies and
[32:34] everything else it's all laying there
[32:35] laying there but when they see somebody
[32:38] on the news that's becoming a hero and
[32:40] popular it raises those demons within
[32:43] them and now the five percent that I
[32:45] talked about a few weeks ago just five
[32:46] percent of our population it's going
[32:48] it's going through the roof of people
[32:50] coming out
[32:52] I don't know who I am anymore so if I
[32:54] decide that I'm a girl and I'm it's it's
[32:56] perversion can you say man and I'm not
[32:58] ashamed to say it take me off anywhere
[33:00] you want to it's a perverted world it's
[33:03] the state this world is in but I'm
[33:05] preaching to you a resurrected power in
[33:07] Jesus Christ that'll raise you out of
[33:09] this world
[33:11] young person I'm preaching the power to
[33:13] you that will raise you above
[33:15] pornography that will raise you above
[33:18] perverted sex
[33:22] far above it
[33:25] to a holy life
[33:28] not that you're perfect in your flesh
[33:30] but to a consecrated holy life
[33:33] this power raises us high above
[33:36] so the devil's not got you under his
[33:38] feet but you get to a place you've got
[33:41] the devil under your feet can somebody
[33:43] praise the Lord
[33:45] you might feel like you're I'm under the
[33:47] feet of the Devil he's stomping me all
[33:49] over the place but I can tell you that's
[33:51] your state but you're standing with
[33:52] Christ is you're supposed to be with the
[33:54] devil under your feet
[33:59] praise the Lord so without enlightening
[34:02] our eyes and that's why it's so
[34:03] important
[34:04] uh that we see
[34:06] uh and our eyes are enlightened because
[34:09] if we see only this
[34:11] then it's discouraging it's
[34:14] it's hopeless
[34:17] if we only see our conditions of our
[34:19] broken families our corrupt world
[34:23] it's more it's more than clear to us our
[34:26] conditions we can see all of that we can
[34:28] see the the state that we're in if
[34:31] that's all we're looking at then we're
[34:32] doomed we need to see what Calvary has
[34:35] done for us and what the resurrection
[34:37] has done for us
[34:38] and that's what he's going to say here
[34:40] we need to see what Cal we needs our
[34:42] eyes enlightened
[34:44] that we know what Calvary has done for
[34:47] us and we know what the resurrection has
[34:49] done for us
[34:51] that's what I'm preaching to you this
[34:52] morning that do you know what Calvary
[34:54] has done for you
[34:56] do you or is it just a symbolism
[34:59] do you know what
[35:01] Calvary has done for you
[35:04] and your condition
[35:06] and do you know what the power of the
[35:08] Resurrection can do for you in your
[35:10] condition
[35:13] how does it happen your eyes have to be
[35:15] enlightened by Revelation didn't you say
[35:17] in the lateral see an age that they were
[35:19] blind and naked and didn't know it about
[35:21] that church of the last days they were
[35:22] blind and so what did they need I Salve
[35:26] I will give you I sap for your eyes that
[35:29] thou mayest see the message of the hour
[35:31] is I save
[35:33] it's revelation
[35:36] and now you're afraid to read it or
[35:37] listen to it no it's the revelations 3 I
[35:40] have to put on your eyes that you can
[35:42] see what's going on
[35:44] you can see what God said about you you
[35:46] can see your deliverance out of it I
[35:48] anoint your eyes with I said because God
[35:51] gives it we must be given eyesight to
[35:53] see something different than what we see
[35:55] in our lives it's too dark it holds no
[35:57] hope without God enlightening Our Eyes
[35:59] by the message it looks dim and
[36:01] depressing every day Paul says if we
[36:04] have hope in this life only we are of
[36:07] all men most miserable Paul do you have
[36:10] to be so negative we're having a pretty
[36:13] good life here I've got my life in order
[36:15] and I got a good job I just got a
[36:16] promotion we yeah we have hope here but
[36:19] he said if we have hope only in this
[36:22] life we are still of all men miserable
[36:26] I know that seems negative but it's not
[36:28] negative because our hope is in the Lord
[36:31] our hope is not in our money our hope is
[36:33] not in our retirement
[36:36] our hope is not in people
[36:40] yeah
[36:42] that's why the power of the Resurrection
[36:44] is needed because we're of all men most
[36:46] miserable for only looking at this has
[36:48] to be a supernatural energy and eyesight
[36:50] allowing us to see now before I go to
[36:53] the final text today and I'm moving
[36:55] along here I realize that our time is uh
[36:58] we're enjoying the children and such and
[36:59] I appreciate that they preached us a
[37:01] little message as it was but before we
[37:03] go into the final text I just want to
[37:05] say just a few minutes since this was
[37:08] Good Friday about this eyes being
[37:11] enlightened and seeing Calvary right
[37:14] anybody who sees Calvary Wright and the
[37:17] finished work of Calvary and what he did
[37:20] anybody who sees it by Revelation gets
[37:22] affected by it
[37:25] it's not a story in the Bible
[37:27] a lot of churches will read the story
[37:30] but unless God opens our eyes to what he
[37:32] did for you at Calvary
[37:34] you'll never have power to overcome
[37:37] and the more I look at this each year we
[37:39] look at it deeper last year we were here
[37:41] Friday night and we brother Brandon
[37:43] elaborated on what Jesus went through
[37:45] but it just keeps opening it up oh more
[37:47] and more and so you know there's a
[37:49] scripture that says in Revelations they
[37:50] overcame by the blood of the lamb and by
[37:53] the word of their testimony it's an end
[37:54] time scripture but think about it now
[37:56] how did they overcome by the blood of
[37:58] the lamb and by the word of their
[38:00] testimony
[38:01] so there has to be a power in this blood
[38:04] and what it did for us that causes us to
[38:07] overcome
[38:09] everybody understand that they overcame
[38:11] by the blood of them by the word of
[38:12] their testimony Jesus didn't did you
[38:15] know that Jesus didn't shed his blood in
[38:18] just one place on the cross but four
[38:20] places
[38:22] if our answer is in the shed blood of
[38:24] that when he shed blood out of his body
[38:26] our attention should rise because that's
[38:29] where they overcome by the shed blood of
[38:31] Christ but he didn't just shed it on the
[38:33] cross when they pierced his side when
[38:36] they put the spikes through his hand no
[38:39] he shed it in four different places
[38:43] and what happened in the whole process
[38:45] on that Friday was I'm going to say this
[38:48] now with with liberty and with
[38:50] confidence what happened in the whole
[38:53] process on that Friday as Jesus went
[38:56] through the whole process that whole
[38:58] process on Friday was addressing every
[39:01] every need of the human being for
[39:06] Redemption
[39:10] including
[39:12] 2023
[39:15] because it was a finished work
[39:18] it was a complete shedding of blood
[39:21] and you look deeper into it it addressed
[39:23] everything and our Bible says it in
[39:25] Isaiah 53 if you guys want to pull it up
[39:27] Isaiah 53
[39:30] it says uh
[39:38] who hath believed our report who to whom
[39:40] is the arm of the Lord revealed for he
[39:43] shall grow up before him as a tender
[39:45] plant and as a root out of a dry ground
[39:47] he hath no form nor comeliness and when
[39:50] we shall see him there is no beauty that
[39:52] we should desire him he's talking about
[39:54] Christ here when he comes prophecy he
[39:56] was despised and rejected of men a Man
[39:59] of Sorrows and acquainted with grief now
[40:02] notice this is the mighty conqueror no
[40:05] before he was the mighty conqueror he
[40:08] went through this what for for you
[40:12] and what was he going through what was
[40:14] he feeling those last few days he was
[40:17] despised he was rejected anybody ever
[40:19] been rejected before
[40:21] the same four people all right
[40:24] he was despised and rejected a man a man
[40:27] of Sorrows acquainted with grief and we
[40:30] hid as it were our faces from him he was
[40:32] despised and we esteemed him not surely
[40:34] he hath borne our griefs
[40:38] how is this tied together
[40:41] he bore the things that we would bear
[40:45] he felt everything that we would feel
[40:49] he had to feel it
[40:52] he had to feel what it meant to be
[40:54] lonely he had to feel friends rejecting
[40:57] him even his own disciples he had to
[41:00] feel being lonely without anybody in the
[41:03] world but just himself he had to feel
[41:05] that
[41:06] because why you would feel that
[41:11] frankly friends
[41:13] you would never be able to tell God
[41:16] he doesn't understand what I'm going
[41:18] through
[41:23] and there might be some people in here
[41:24] that have said that to God God just this
[41:27] is new he doesn't understand why I'm
[41:29] here to correct you about that because
[41:31] if this is our perfect lamb he
[41:33] experienced what life would be for us
[41:37] and he bore it can you say Amen
[41:44] he born our griefs he carried our
[41:46] sorrows yet we did esteem him smitten
[41:49] stricken smitten of God and Afflicted
[41:51] but he was wounded for our
[41:53] transgressions he was bruised for our
[41:56] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[41:58] was upon him and with his stripes we are
[42:01] healed I'm adding in verse six all we
[42:04] like sheep have gone astray we have
[42:07] turned everyone to his own way and the
[42:10] Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us
[42:12] all so let me tell you something that
[42:14] scripture tells you you're not in a
[42:16] different category in the sense of your
[42:17] human flesh all we all of us that covers
[42:20] all kind of covers everybody I don't
[42:23] care how much pride you have all we like
[42:26] sheep have gone astray
[42:28] all of us in our own self are weak can
[42:31] you say Amen we've made mistakes we've
[42:33] made blunders even if you've hid them
[42:34] very well you're like a sheep that has
[42:36] gone straight and you will always go
[42:38] astray unless the Shepherd gets a hold
[42:40] of your life
[42:41] and all the sheep that have gone astray
[42:44] the answer is one thing and that's this
[42:47] lamb that's going to Calvary that
[42:49] whatever way we have strayed
[42:51] he's given us a sacrifice
[42:56] that we can come back to and say God
[42:59] you did it for me
[43:03] my shepherd did it for me
[43:09] you can see by Isaiah 53 was an effect
[43:11] on our condition
[43:13] whatever condition so
[43:15] to me gospel ministers and preachers in
[43:18] this message have to connect the
[43:20] finished work of Calvary to our current
[43:22] need
[43:26] you have to connect the finished work of
[43:31] Calvary your atonement to your current
[43:33] need
[43:35] and you cannot by the devil's lie that
[43:39] this particular need in my life
[43:41] including an emotional need
[43:45] is going to be
[43:47] satisfied
[43:49] by some other source
[43:54] I'll go ahead and let it out that's
[43:55] because we have addictions is because
[43:58] we're not getting our emotional needs
[44:00] satisfied and our soul satisfied so the
[44:04] Alternatives come up to the Forefront
[44:06] and we try them and get disappointed
[44:09] every time
[44:11] God has opened up a fountain in the
[44:14] House of David
[44:16] and when you drink from that it not only
[44:18] transforms the desires of the soul but
[44:21] has the power to fill your need
[44:23] emotionally
[44:27] preachers need to preach the finished
[44:29] work of Calvary and connect to the
[44:31] people to their current need or its
[44:33] Calvary is just a story
[44:38] Calvary my dear friend listening
[44:41] Calvary is just a story in the Bible
[44:44] unless you find the connection of your
[44:48] current need to the finished work at
[44:50] Calvary
[44:53] he paid it all
[44:55] he took care of it
[44:58] in the garden he's struggling he has a
[45:01] struggle in the garden and you know what
[45:03] the struggle was over
[45:05] God's will or his own will
[45:09] it was pretty intense
[45:12] because he was sweating and his his face
[45:15] had become so intense from the pressure
[45:18] and that battle of his own will that it
[45:21] was great like greats
[45:23] sweat drops of of blood and science says
[45:26] it got so intense that it turns into
[45:28] some blood sweat turns into blood that's
[45:31] the first time he shed his blood and
[45:33] guess what it was related to a struggle
[45:35] over his own will and God's Will has
[45:37] anybody ever had the same struggle
[45:42] is it tense
[45:49] in the court under pilate he's being
[45:51] falsely accused he's being
[45:53] ridiculed he's being made fun of he's
[45:55] being mocked
[45:57] there's a robe put on them to mock him
[46:00] as being King a purple robe and then the
[46:03] crown of thorns the next place he sheds
[46:06] blood a crown of thorns is crushed where
[46:08] where crushed in his head
[46:11] shed blood came from
[46:14] his head
[46:20] anyone ever had any battles in your mind
[46:24] anyone having him today you don't have
[46:27] to raise your hand but I'd say if you
[46:29] live in this world
[46:30] you have the battle of the Mind
[46:35] this age is mental this age is going
[46:37] insane people can't think straight
[46:40] it's everything that a Believer could do
[46:42] can he keep his heart in the word of God
[46:43] to keep his own sound thinking
[46:46] come on friends let's be real this isn't
[46:48] too thou this isn't 1995. this is 2023
[46:52] and I'm here to tell you the atonement
[46:54] and the shed blood of Jesus Christ
[46:56] addressed every condition of this Modern
[46:58] Age
[47:00] he paid the price for you he shed blood
[47:03] in that area that this the mental
[47:05] conditions the insanity the addictions
[47:07] of the Mind the pornography and he shed
[47:10] blood there in his head nobody those
[47:12] soldiers didn't know what they were
[47:14] doing when they crushed it in blood came
[47:15] out of his head now we know what he was
[47:17] doing now we know what was taken but now
[47:19] we know why he had to shed blood from
[47:21] there
[47:23] maybe you can remember that this week
[47:26] when the devil's got your inner tailspin
[47:28] in your mind come on people
[47:32] maybe you can remember what this
[47:34] preacher has said to you
[47:35] that God did something for you God shed
[47:38] blood for that
[47:45] he shed blood at the whipping post 39
[47:47] Stripes that's another place he shed
[47:49] blood and that's when anyone ever being
[47:52] wounded deeply like that and it was in
[47:55] his back but we know as I was talking to
[47:57] the kids that the co-op devotion on
[48:00] Friday morning I was talking to him
[48:01] about how the whip was done and the the
[48:03] pieces of metal and different things put
[48:05] at the end of the whip so that it's not
[48:08] just a whipping in a normal sense but
[48:10] that it would cut the Flesh and open up
[48:12] his flesh and all that is about opening
[48:14] up a wound and all these wounds where
[48:16] the flesh was just hanging down his back
[48:18] and we know we know if that person
[48:21] survived it'll take a long time but
[48:24] there the body would heal itself most
[48:27] the time they died but they didn't want
[48:29] them to die they wanted to suffer so
[48:31] there was a long healing process
[48:35] to Stripes going in his back
[48:40] but it was a it was it was it was
[48:42] looking ahead because Isaiah says he was
[48:47] wounded for our transgressions he was
[48:50] bruised for our iniquity
[48:53] and by his stripes we receive healing
[48:58] somebody raise your hand if you're sick
[48:59] this morning buy his stripes I'm Healed
[49:01] he already paid the price for my healing
[49:04] and though that would take days months
[49:07] to heal that back you've seen it in
[49:09] movies sometimes when it took days and
[49:11] months and sometimes years to get a full
[49:13] healing to that back and sometimes
[49:15] healing is a process but I can tell you
[49:17] it's not just the body naturally healing
[49:19] itself God provided in his atonement
[49:22] that for any sickness any cancer any
[49:25] disease we're not afraid of any of it
[49:26] because he paid the price for any
[49:28] disease to be healed somebody say Amen
[49:30] this morning
[49:34] this might work what my Lord means to me
[49:36] this morning he means so much more to me
[49:38] and then the shed Blood on the cross
[49:42] pierced aside
[49:44] Nails in his hands and in his feet blood
[49:47] of course came forth from there but then
[49:49] the pierced aside in Blood and water and
[49:51] Spirit came out and that's an important
[49:53] thing because we realized when when his
[49:56] Spirit came out
[49:58] praise the Lord
[50:00] the blood cell had to be broken and
[50:02] something had to come out of him why
[50:04] because we needed that same spirit
[50:08] to be able to live
[50:10] how many needed that Holy Ghost that
[50:12] come out of him
[50:13] the blood cell had to be broken so it
[50:15] would come out of him and come back on
[50:17] the day of Pentecost and fill the
[50:19] Believers
[50:20] he shed blood so you could have the Holy
[50:22] Ghost
[50:23] somebody ought to shout praise the Lord
[50:24] in this building this morning I can't
[50:26] get no help this morning
[50:27] [Applause]
[50:37] I told the kids Friday this is the most
[50:39] cruel death that had ever taken place in
[50:41] history this was cruelty he was mocked
[50:44] he was spit in the face he was innocent
[50:46] but he was falsely accused he was made
[50:48] fun of
[50:49] anybody ever had those situations in
[50:52] life
[50:54] and then I said why was it so cruel why
[50:57] such a cruel death why such cruelty such
[51:00] Relentless no holding back cruelty to a
[51:04] human body wise that's crudy I said to
[51:07] the kids for two reasons number one that
[51:09] he would experience what cruelty was
[51:12] because you're going to go through
[51:13] cruelty you're going to have people
[51:14] mocking you if you stand for Christ the
[51:17] people are going to make fun of you
[51:18] they're going to laugh at you
[51:21] you got an easy road if you don't make a
[51:23] full stand for Christ but if you do it
[51:25] you're going to be experiencing well he
[51:26] needed to experience that all cruelty no
[51:29] matter how cruel somebody could treat
[51:30] you he had to be he had to be treated it
[51:32] was such cruelty
[51:34] by the Roman which were the cruelest in
[51:36] their their treatment of prisoners
[51:41] two reasons why they there was such
[51:43] cruelty in this death
[51:46] he had to feel what extreme abuse he had
[51:49] to be abused
[51:51] because there would be people
[51:54] in this generation especially that were
[51:57] abused
[52:02] sexually abused
[52:06] mentally abused
[52:08] emotionally abused
[52:12] physically abused
[52:15] he had to be abused he had to be
[52:17] scourged he had to be mocked he be had
[52:20] to be be made fun of can you say Amen
[52:24] and it was extreme cruelty because he
[52:26] had to feel extreme abuse and cruelty
[52:29] and what it felt like so that you could
[52:30] never go to him to say God you don't
[52:32] understand he understands because he
[52:34] felt he felt he felt that cruelty I
[52:36] needed I know I need to move on can you
[52:38] give me just a few more minutes
[52:40] he felt he felt it because you would
[52:43] feel it
[52:45] it doesn't feel good to be betrayed
[52:48] the human Spirit can hardly handle it
[52:50] when somebody is falsely accused
[52:53] I didn't do that and they're saying that
[52:55] I did it
[52:56] the human Spirit can bear barely bear
[52:59] something of somebody falsely accusing
[53:01] or putting them down or gossiping about
[53:03] we don't take it very well sometimes we
[53:06] can dish it out but we don't like it
[53:07] coming back at us
[53:09] that's cruelty can you say Amen that's
[53:12] cruelty and God needs to remove that
[53:14] cruelty out of your life you don't want
[53:16] to be treated that way in your gossip
[53:20] he had to feel the extreme abuse and it
[53:24] was extremely cruel death
[53:26] it was secondly an extremely cruel death
[53:29] because let's go back to what
[53:33] the prophet has said to us
[53:35] in the message cruelty of sin it had to
[53:38] be the most cruel death because sin
[53:42] is Relentless sin is the most cruelty
[53:46] that can come to a human being
[53:49] people can do one thing but sin is cruel
[53:54] I got a lot of people nodding their
[53:56] heads and say yes brother Paul
[53:58] what my life has been through anybody
[54:00] listening
[54:02] maybe you've had a pretty cushioned life
[54:04] but there's some people sitting here
[54:06] that's been saved by grace
[54:08] but sin they can tell you sin was cruel
[54:11] to their lives
[54:14] destroyed their Spirit drugs destroyed
[54:17] how they think properly
[54:20] sin never sin is only sin is only a a
[54:24] some joy for a temporal time but every
[54:27] time it never ends up right it's cruel
[54:30] to your life
[54:34] had to feel the extreme but because
[54:37] sin is cruel and it was extremely cruel
[54:41] death because of how sin would be so
[54:43] cruel to us with broken families
[54:45] Children of Divorce
[54:48] affairs
[54:49] alcohol should I go on and on and on
[54:52] depression
[54:57] he went through all of it
[54:59] the Bible says when he was across the
[55:01] table from Judas
[55:02] says that his Spirit was troubled within
[55:05] him why because he knew what Judas was
[55:08] and he knew Judas would stand across the
[55:09] table and he had to stand he had to be
[55:11] across the table from a man who looked
[55:13] him in the face his own disciple and he
[55:15] was pretending he was hiding that he had
[55:17] betrayed him
[55:19] and Jesus had to be courteous to him had
[55:22] to look across the table but his Spirit
[55:24] was groaning because he was getting
[55:25] ready to betray him how many of you have
[55:27] ever felt that before
[55:30] he experienced all of it
[55:32] in the last few hours of his life he
[55:35] experienced broken families children of
[55:38] divorced Affairs alcohol sin is cruel it
[55:41] it produces drugs addictions sin is fun
[55:44] on the outside but it is relentlessly
[55:46] cruel to your life how many who's been
[55:48] there done that can say Amen Brother
[55:50] Paul's sin is never comes out right it
[55:54] it messes with your life it's cruel
[55:56] that's why Calvary had to be a cruel
[55:59] death
[56:02] cruelest death because sin is cruel to
[56:05] us
[56:06] young people is the ones that need to be
[56:08] really listening
[56:10] choose that path and it's nothing but
[56:12] cruelty to your life to your family to
[56:15] your future marriage everything it's
[56:17] nothing but Cruelty Without Christ
[56:19] don't choose the path of sin choose the
[56:23] path of righteousness in Jesus Christ
[56:28] choose the right path
[56:30] [Applause]
[56:32] nobody will be able to make that choice
[56:33] for you parents can't make it I can't
[56:35] make them if I could I would make it for
[56:36] you because I love you enough to do it
[56:38] but nobody can make that choice for you
[56:39] you choose sin watch the cruelty come to
[56:42] your life
[56:45] it's only fun for a season
[56:48] he had to feel rejection he had to feel
[56:50] betrayal he had to feel Judas betraying
[56:53] him he had to take offensive words false
[56:55] accused loneliness no friends even his
[56:58] disciples bailed out at the last minute
[56:59] he had to endure a cold a cold shoulder
[57:02] from people
[57:05] been there done that got the T-shirt
[57:08] disrespect the cold shoulder gossip and
[57:12] eventually killed and sealed up
[57:14] in a dark tomb
[57:17] our sacrificial lamb went through all of
[57:21] this for us
[57:22] he covered all the cruelty of a human
[57:24] experience his blood covered it all to
[57:28] redeem you my brother and sister his
[57:30] blood covering it all so that he could
[57:32] redeem you
[57:34] the knowledge of Christ's blood being
[57:36] shed for you is powerful in itself the
[57:40] enlightenment of revelation of what
[57:42] Christ's blood has done for you is
[57:43] powerful just in itself I haven't even
[57:45] got to the resurrection power yet I'm
[57:47] just talking about the enlightenment of
[57:48] what Calvary has done for your life that
[57:51] in itself should have power in your life
[57:52] to rise in Victory
[57:54] and you're singing he did it for me
[57:57] you can't say Lord you don't understand
[57:59] this he did it for me
[58:02] he did it for me and so I don't care
[58:05] what you have or what you've been
[58:07] through you've followed the
[58:08] blood-stained path that I'm preaching to
[58:10] you this morning if you follow the
[58:12] blood-stained path the Via Dolorosa the
[58:15] called the way of suffering I was there
[58:17] in Jerusalem and I walked the entire way
[58:19] and but I've walked that way I've walked
[58:22] that way with my Lord through many
[58:24] experiences in life but listen the Via
[58:27] Delarosa the way of suffering if you
[58:29] follow the blood-stained path that was
[58:31] broken through for you if you follow
[58:33] that path young person you will come to
[58:36] a victory in Jesus Christ
[58:39] the greatest thing and I'm going to
[58:40] close on this I believe I'm going to
[58:42] close on this I'm not making any
[58:44] promises
[58:46] but the greatest thing is the story did
[58:50] not stop
[58:52] with all the cruelty
[58:56] now I want to make this point and I made
[58:58] it to the kids
[58:59] in the simplest way I could hopefully
[59:01] some of them caught it
[59:04] I've talked about all the cruelty they
[59:06] put him in a grave all the way he was
[59:08] treated and I asked him have you been
[59:09] treated bad by somebody have you felt
[59:12] alone have you felt you had no friends
[59:17] have you been bullied
[59:20] have you been made fun of for because
[59:22] your ears look funny
[59:27] yeah Jesus was made fun there's no
[59:30] Beauty we should desire him so if there
[59:32] was no Beauty which desire he was
[59:33] probably made fun of for his looks
[59:37] he attempted at all point he experienced
[59:39] it all and so now I told the kids this
[59:41] one thing but guess what what's the
[59:42] answer to all this what was the answer
[59:46] God raised Jesus and guess what
[59:50] he rose above all the cruelty
[59:56] if I didn't have that last chapter of
[59:58] the book
[59:59] we are of all men most miserable and it
[1:00:02] would be discouraging because we would
[1:00:04] continue to live and guess what we have
[1:00:07] a victim mentality today is that you've
[1:00:09] been victimized you can stay in a rut of
[1:00:12] always feeling like you're being
[1:00:14] victimized
[1:00:18] it's prevalent in our generation if you
[1:00:20] believe I'm telling the truth Say Amen
[1:00:24] it's a victim in it
[1:00:27] was Jesus a victim
[1:00:31] but Jesus didn't keep his victim
[1:00:33] mentality
[1:00:36] kids he didn't keep his I've been
[1:00:38] treated cruel I've been treated cruel
[1:00:40] sometimes I'm just going to give some
[1:00:42] parents some advice is when the kid
[1:00:44] comes to the pity party
[1:00:46] they call me bad names and sometimes you
[1:00:49] gotta act and you got to go talk to the
[1:00:51] other parents and work it out but but
[1:00:53] sometimes you just tell the kids yes
[1:00:54] that's what life is and I can't
[1:00:57] guarantee you that people aren't going
[1:00:58] to make fun of you
[1:01:00] instead of saying my kid has been done
[1:01:02] wrong and I'm going to bring it before
[1:01:04] the church and the elders and we're
[1:01:06] going to settle this thing because
[1:01:07] somebody's done my kid wrong and so now
[1:01:09] you settle it and next week somebody
[1:01:11] does your kid wrong again because that's
[1:01:13] life that's an imperfect World shouldn't
[1:01:16] we rather teach that that you're going
[1:01:18] to get criticized you're going to get
[1:01:20] bullied sometimes can you say Amen but
[1:01:22] there's a Christ that you can look to
[1:01:24] that can give you the upper Edge on the
[1:01:26] enemy
[1:01:27] and I said to the kids in all his
[1:01:29] cruelty and darken the grave he rose
[1:01:32] above it and I'm here to tell you this
[1:01:34] morning you need to rise above it the
[1:01:37] power of the Resurrection says you need
[1:01:39] to rise above it
[1:01:41] whatever they've treated you like it's
[1:01:43] time to rise above it it's time to let
[1:01:46] the power of the Resurrection get you
[1:01:48] past your past
[1:01:51] Jesus did not stay in the grave Jesus
[1:01:53] did not stay on the earth that was being
[1:01:55] cruel to him but he rose high high above
[1:01:58] it far above it all
[1:02:00] something tells me that he gives me the
[1:02:02] power through Revelation and
[1:02:04] Enlightenment of the word he can give me
[1:02:06] the power of God to rise above any kind
[1:02:09] of treatment this world would give me
[1:02:13] broken families broken homes
[1:02:19] his power Rose above it all
[1:02:22] somebody said praise the Lord
[1:02:25] Rose so high not back to Earth or back
[1:02:28] to the same it raised above what else
[1:02:30] would Enlighten us and here's the last
[1:02:32] scriptures in in Isaiah come back to
[1:02:35] Ephesians chapter 1. he says the eyes of
[1:02:38] your understanding Ephesians 1 18.
[1:02:40] I'm closing now
[1:02:42] the eyes of your understanding being
[1:02:44] enlightened that you may know know what
[1:02:46] what do we need to know when he opens
[1:02:48] your eyes you're going to know this
[1:02:49] about the resurrection in your position
[1:02:50] that is that ye may know number one what
[1:02:54] is the hope of his calling and that in
[1:02:57] the Amplified says you're going to have
[1:02:59] a hope and a confident expectation with
[1:03:02] Divine with a Divine guarantee this hope
[1:03:05] is not going to fall through there's a
[1:03:07] Divine guarantee with this hope so one
[1:03:10] thing you need to know is that the hope
[1:03:12] that we hold in our heart comes with a
[1:03:14] Divine guarantee
[1:03:18] and what the riches of the glory of this
[1:03:20] inheritance of the Saints well that was

[1:07:49] resurrection and start enjoying the
[1:07:52] resurrection

[1:09:00] from sin when he died at the day of the
[1:09:02] atonement he totally delivered every sin
[1:09:05] he delivered the church so there's no
[1:09:07] need for us to live underprivileged
[1:09:09] people

[1:09:12] underprivileged your state may say
[1:09:15] you're poor you don't have nothing you

[1:09:18] what your standing says
[1:09:21] you're not underprivileged people devil
[1:09:23] I'm not an underprivileged believer
[1:09:25] there's no such thing as underprivileged
[1:09:28] believers

[1:09:33] defeated State how many can say Amen to
[1:09:35] that

[1:09:44] no need for us to live in a defeated
[1:09:46] State we are not underprivileged
[1:09:48] children there's no need for us to live
[1:09:49] in a defeated State because he defeated
[1:09:52] the devil and took all the
[1:09:54] principalities and powers and subdued
[1:09:56] them under his feet and they have no
[1:09:58] legal rights to rule over you we are
[1:10:01] Christians filled with the Holy Ghost we
[1:10:03] don't have to we we have the devil we
[1:10:05] don't have to have the devil dictate to
[1:10:07] us Christ delivered us total Deliverance

[1:10:19] from The Black Guard and I said what is
[1:10:21] that so I looked it up The Black Guard
[1:10:23] is a man that's not honest he's not an
[1:10:25] honest man he delivered us from the
[1:10:27] dishonest man The Black Guard he
[1:10:30] delivered us from all kinds of smutty
[1:10:32] things wow is that what year is this
[1:10:35] 1959 there's muddy things in 1959 I'd
[1:10:38] say that quotes more for today in 2023
[1:10:41] but Calvary delivered us young people
[1:10:44] from the smut
[1:10:47] the perversion that's on social media
[1:10:53] tick tock
[1:10:55] go ahead 50 of Americans just gobbled up
[1:10:59] 50 Americans have it and we've got
[1:11:01] States now that are trying to get rid of
[1:11:03] it and change laws it's so dangerous
[1:11:04] when they look into it China where it
[1:11:07] comes from China won't even allow their
[1:11:09] children to look at it until they're 14
[1:11:11] years old
[1:11:14] and China will only let the teenagers on
[1:11:17] the internet for two I think it's just
[1:11:19] an hour hour 40 minutes a day that's it
[1:11:22] that's all why because they're smart
[1:11:24] enough to know this affects the kids
[1:11:26] brains it affects the adults brains
[1:11:31] it brings SMUD into their lives it
[1:11:33] teaches them smut
[1:11:35] what a world we live in but I have an
[1:11:38] atonement that will deliver us
[1:11:39] completely from the smut of this world
[1:11:42] he totally delivered us and put us into
[1:11:45] his hands completely it is a total a
[1:11:48] total Deliverance

[1:12:17] far above the state that you're in you
[1:12:21] keep looking at it you're going to be
[1:12:22] defeated but if you get your eyes lifted
[1:12:24] up in Revelation this morning my
[1:12:26] position is more important than the
[1:12:27] state I'm in
[1:12:28] if I keep looking at my position
[1:12:30] I'm going to be drawn out of the state
[1:12:32] that I'm in

[1:13:14] but we know what it is we're close to
[1:13:17] judgment
[1:13:21] God sent us a message to tell sons of
[1:13:24] God who they are
[1:13:26] that's another place that we can be
[1:13:28] ruling and reigning from
