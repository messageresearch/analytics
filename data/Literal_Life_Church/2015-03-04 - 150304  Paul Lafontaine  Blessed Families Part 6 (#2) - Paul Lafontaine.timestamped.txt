[0:00] how shall I prove my love to him by
[0:02] believing what he said and by conducting
[0:06] myself with joy amidst the trials that
[0:10] he in his wisdom allows to come to pass
[0:14] amen Lord help us how do we show our
[0:17] love to him by believing what he said
[0:20] and by conducting ourselves with joy in
[0:22] the midst of our trials that he ordained
[0:25] for us that he allows for us so help us
[0:28] Lord amen help us help us Lord to live
[0:31] that way in our trials amen I'm still
[0:34] trying to live Sunday's message of
[0:35] having the law of kindness in my tongue
[0:38] so now I'm got to move on to this by the
[0:39] grace of
[0:41] God praise the Lord so now so we we and
[0:45] I just want to make sure that I
[0:46] emphasize this enough after Calvary
[0:49] after Calvary he approved our sacrifice
[0:52] for our sin so he accepted you when he
[0:55] accepted the sacrifice so we can't apply
[0:58] this across the board that somehow his
[1:00] disapproval has come to us and his favor
[1:03] is gone now and he's going to kick us
[1:05] out and we've crossed the line no no no
[1:08] that that doesn't work that way when God
[1:10] accepted your sacrifice he accepted you
[1:14] so he approved You by approving the
[1:17] sacrifice and when you accept his
[1:19] sacrifice you have God's favor and
[1:21] approval and the curse of sin in its
[1:24] core nature is lifted from your life
[1:27] Hallelujah you have passed from death
[1:30] and life you have passed judgment but
[1:32] but you can grieve the spirit of God as
[1:36] we read read in Ephesians on Sunday
[1:38] that's how we grieve them a lot of times
[1:39] with our words our corrupt communication
[1:41] that comes out of our mouth but so now
[1:44] he put a you put the family in a
[1:47] position of trouble many times by
[1:49] Disobedience it's not God's disapproval
[1:52] or his lack of favor but it's just like
[1:54] we position ourselves and put our
[1:57] families in trouble by our disobedience
[2:00] uh an example of that would be our
[2:02] finance our finances you can be a child
[2:04] of God and put yourself under the
[2:07] bondage of debt that's right all right
[2:10] you can be you can have the Holy Ghost
[2:12] and have all that but because you
[2:14] disobey in certain areas it doesn't mean
[2:17] God's favor is not not with you that
[2:19] displeases him but it doesn't mean his
[2:21] favor is gone you've crossed the line
[2:23] it's over he just completely disapproves
[2:26] of you absolutely not we can't hang
[2:28] God's love on that we'd be finished if
[2:31] we did but you can cause God to just be
[2:35] displeased and Grievous spirit and you
[2:37] can bring your life under a curse of
[2:39] bondage of your finances you can bring
[2:41] your life under a curse because money if
[2:43] it's not handled right will bring a
[2:44] curse in your life bring bondage in your
[2:46] life and where does it come from from
[2:48] our disob our Disobedience not being
[2:50] obedient in certain areas can you say
[2:52] Amen so when we look at all the
[2:55] different things that the Bible says
[2:56] about curses it has different meanings
[2:58] in different places that it's mentioned
[3:00] but one of the first ones I want to
[3:01] mention to you I want I mention this
[3:02] because it's in relation to the families
[3:05] a father's blessing or a father's curse
[3:07] on a child uh was not just for the
[3:10] present because that's one of the
[3:11] blessings and cursing is a father this
[3:13] goes all the way back to the Patriarchs
[3:15] now that they believed back then that a
[3:18] father pronounced a blessing he could
[3:20] pronounce a blessing over a son or a
[3:22] curse over a son and it not just it
[3:25] wasn't just for the present but it had
[3:27] power in it and it actually extended to
[3:29] the rest of the Li sometimes their
[3:31] Destiny by what he said Noah actually he
[3:34] blessed two of his sons and he cursed
[3:36] the third one Jacob blessed all of his
[3:38] 12 sons and we see there we even see
[3:41] today what Jacob pronounced over his
[3:44] sons coming to pass and still being
[3:46] fulfilled in the children of Israel
[3:48] still see it happening it is and so now
[3:51] it is believ that the blessing and the
[3:54] cursed released a power and I'm reading
[3:57] this from a a Bible dictionary it says
[3:59] it is is believed that the blessing and
[4:01] curse released a power that effectively
[4:04] determined the character and Destiny of
[4:07] the
[4:08] recipient is that true is it still true
[4:11] today praise the Lord first of all our
[4:14] God pronounced the blessing over us amen
[4:17] Our God has a covenant over our lives
[4:20] the great parent the great father
[4:22] pronounced the blessing over our lives
[4:25] and so that blessing has a power within
[4:27] it to bring us to our Destiny can you
[4:30] say amen and bring a certain character
[4:32] at the end of all things praise God
[4:34] because because there's a power within
[4:37] that blessing so is it still true today
[4:40] yes it's true true today it's still true
[4:42] of our heavenly father he predestinated
[4:45] us before the foundation of the world
[4:47] and it it it's and it's also true
[4:48] because the Bible says death and life
[4:50] are in the power of the
[4:53] tongue death and life are in the power
[4:55] of the tongue so there's more power
[4:58] there than what we realize is even with
[5:00] us that you can pronounce something you
[5:02] can say something and there's power that
[5:05] goes with what you say sometimes whether
[5:07] it be a blessing or a curse and so in
[5:09] relation to parents we have to be
[5:11] careful what we say and what we
[5:13] pronounce over our kids because that
[5:15] sometimes have can have more power to it
[5:17] than what we realize parents speak
[5:19] things and not realize it has long-term
[5:22] effects of what they say over their
[5:24] children right right uh we may not do it
[5:28] or say something by this Vision like
[5:30] Jacob did Jacob was a prophet so he
[5:32] spoke by the vision pronouncing over his
[5:34] children but still there's power there
[5:36] in a parent that what we say over our
[5:38] children will have long-term effects
[5:41] maybe not as by Vision but your words
[5:43] can put a cloud over their life your
[5:45] negative words can put a cloud over them
[5:48] that they start to walk into the
[5:49] identity of what you call them what you
[5:51] label them what you say to them what
[5:54] what you if you're constantly focusing
[5:57] on their weaknesses and all that they
[5:58] are oh you'll never make it you'll never
[6:00] amount to anything and you have this
[6:02] weakness in your life and and that's
[6:04] most of your conversation uh they're
[6:06] going to walk into that identity because
[6:08] why you words still have
[6:10] power some of you may still be
[6:12] struggling even with your dad what your
[6:13] dad and mom pronounced over you just
[6:15] what they said enough comments was made
[6:17] in the house that you're still living
[6:19] underneath that
[6:21] cloud but if you say positive things to
[6:24] your children about how God made them
[6:27] and their special gifts and how God
[6:29] could use those gifts and how God is
[6:30] going to use those gifts and even if
[6:32] God's dropped it in your heart to
[6:33] articulate how God maybe would use those
[6:36] gifts in the future that's the positive
[6:38] things that we need to say over our kids
[6:41] negative words can cause them to live
[6:43] out what you said to them just as
[6:45] positive words caus them to live out
[6:47] what you said to them can you say amen
[6:49] amen praise the Lord and we've had this
[6:51] happen in this age a blessing was
[6:53] pronounced on the bride a blessing was
[6:56] pronounced that you're the pure virtuous
[6:58] bride of Jesus Christ never sinned in
[7:00] the first place I believe that was a
[7:01] pronouncement from God's Prophet for
[7:04] this age to his children and if we
[7:05] believe that it was already in the word
[7:07] of God but to have it echoed Again by a
[7:10] prophet that that truth if that really
[7:12] sinks down in your heart there's a
[7:14] security can you say man there's a truth
[7:17] of the blood of Jesus Christ that so
[7:19] washes away that you stand Justified
[7:22] before God just as if you never did in
[7:24] the first place a virgin before him the
[7:26] Lord hallelujah and he pronounced that
[7:28] blessing in this age praise the Lord he
[7:31] also pronounced an indictment on the
[7:33] entire church in the entire systems of
[7:36] denomination a curse on the entire thing
[7:39] there is no blessing that comes from
[7:41] that denominational system from the
[7:42] mother all the way down to the daughters
[7:44] the harlots as well it's been cursed
[7:46] with a
[7:47] curse and it can never be blessed of God
[7:50] never be blessed can can the people be
[7:52] blessed of course I always have to
[7:53] qualify these things now of course they
[7:55] can of course they can be uh moved by
[7:57] the Holy Spirit but the system are under
[7:59] a curse that's why we could never work
[8:01] with those systems we can love people
[8:04] within them they can love us we have
[8:06] friends in them we share the word
[8:08] together but we as the church could
[8:10] never work with a system like that not
[8:13] because of the people there or the
[8:14] pastor but the system is cursed within
[8:16] itself and if I brought that in here and
[8:18] begin to work with it then we bring
[8:20] ourselves under the curse of what
[8:21] they've been cursed
[8:24] by Praise the Lord amen so it's the
[8:28] systems in so you see these things work
[8:30] even with the prophet of this age and
[8:32] all all that's been proclaimed but the
[8:34] prophet proclaimed we the pure virtuous
[8:36] uh bride of Jesus Christ Justified and
[8:38] when we see it and believe it then we
[8:40] walk in that blessing all right so now
[8:42] let's just unveil unveil this a bit
[8:44] deeper that's a that's a truth of a
[8:45] blessing and cursing so we have
[8:47] incidences though in the scripture this
[8:49] is this is great this will make you
[8:52] shout Maybe
[8:54] not maybe not on a Wednesday night we
[8:57] have incidences in the scripture where
[8:59] where God turned a curse into a
[9:02] blessing so that's where we Rejoice
[9:05] tonight is that you may have something
[9:07] that somebody put on you your whole life
[9:09] because but God for a Believer can turn
[9:12] what they're saying and turn it into a
[9:14] blessing amen that's why when shimi was
[9:16] spitting at David and they wanted to cut
[9:18] his head off David said no down the road
[9:20] that be a may be a blessing he caught
[9:22] something he caught a truth can you say
[9:24] am man that if he's in the line of duty
[9:26] and he's a Son of God and he's in his
[9:27] position they can say whatever they want
[9:29] to say he's blessed anyway and God can
[9:32] take their cursing and turn it into a
[9:33] blessing that's what happened with balum
[9:36] that's the first example balum is that
[9:38] he was hired by Balo to curse the true
[9:40] people of God and every time he went to
[9:43] prophesy and do it God turned it around
[9:45] and he blessed them B said man I'm
[9:47] paying you bucks to do this and every
[9:49] time you spill out a prophecy it comes
[9:51] out of blessing why because that's God's
[9:53] blessed people and he was turning that
[9:56] prophecy around every time he tried to
[9:58] curse them turn around into a blessing
[10:00] we're under the same God my friends amen
[10:03] we're under the same God we're serving
[10:05] the same God praise the Lord amen uh
[10:07] Goliath even cursed David and balum he
[10:10] tried to curse Israel and shimi to David
[10:13] and so you see these things these these
[10:15] words prove powerless if God stepped in
[10:20] he is able to turn a curse into a
[10:21] blessing if he wants to do that amen
[10:24] praise the Lord that's right amen amen
[10:27] now then we move on to Deuteronomy 27
[10:29] and we find that Moses lays out specific
[10:32] Cur curses and let's just read through
[10:34] them
[10:34] quickly it's another place in scripture
[10:38] is
[10:38] that it's expressing that if we Deuter
[10:42] Deuteronomy
[10:56] 27 curses come when we're disobedient to
[10:58] the the word and it says here in 20
[11:01] chapter 27:14 and the levite shall speak
[11:03] and say unto all the men of Israel with
[11:05] a loud voice cursed be the man that
[11:06] maketh any Graven image or molten image
[11:09] and Abomination unto the Lord the work
[11:11] of the hands of the Craftsman and
[11:12] putteth in a secret place and all the
[11:14] people shall answer and say Amen cursed
[11:16] is be he that sth light by his father or
[11:18] his mother and all the people say amen
[11:20] cursed be the he that removeth uh his
[11:23] neighbor's landmark and all the people
[11:25] shall say Amen so in other words if
[11:28] these people if you do this in
[11:29] Disobedience because this tied to the
[11:30] law if you do this these things back
[11:33] then if you did these things in
[11:34] Disobedience there'd be a curse come on
[11:36] your life you're not going to be under
[11:37] God's blessings H cursed be he that
[11:39] maketh blind to wander out of the way
[11:41] and all the people said said amen cursed
[11:43] he be he that perverteth the Judgment of
[11:45] the stranger follow us in Widow verse 20
[11:48] cursed be he that lith with his father's
[11:50] wife because he uncover his father's
[11:53] skirt and the people said amen cursed be
[11:55] he that lith with any manner of Beast
[11:57] and all the people said amen cursed
[11:58] cursed be he that lith with his sister
[12:01] the daughter of his father or the
[12:02] daughter of his mother and all the
[12:03] people said amen cursed be he that lieth
[12:05] with his mother-in-law and all the
[12:07] people said amen cursed be he that
[12:08] smiteth his neighbor secretly and all
[12:11] the people said amen cursed be he that
[12:12] taketh reward to slay an innocent person
[12:15] cured be he that confires not all the
[12:17] words of this law to do them and all the
[12:20] people shall say Amen so there's the
[12:22] there's curses that come with
[12:24] disobedience that's the simple principle
[12:26] to it that that you're not going to be
[12:29] if you're uh uh willingly disobedient to
[12:32] clear things of the word of God you're
[12:35] not going to be under the blessings of
[12:37] God that's that's the principle we can
[12:39] get into technically all these things
[12:41] but you know a lot of these things are
[12:43] are still to be reverenced all these
[12:45] things are still to be reverenced and uh
[12:47] and and followed after but we have to
[12:49] realize that that that there's a curse
[12:51] that comes in Disobedience chapter 28
[12:53] verse1 it shall come to pass if Thou
[12:54] shalt hearken diligently unto the voice
[12:56] of the Lord thy God to observe and to do
[12:58] all his Commandments which I command
[12:59] thee this day that the Lord thy God will
[13:01] set thee on high above all the nations
[13:03] of the earth and all these blessings
[13:05] shall come on thee and overtake thee if
[13:08] Thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the
[13:09] Lord thy God blessed shalt thou be in
[13:11] their city and blessed Thou shalt be in
[13:13] the field blessed you shall be the shall
[13:15] be the fruit of the body and the fruit
[13:16] of thy ground the fruit of thy cattle
[13:18] the increase of thy kind and the flocks
[13:21] of the sheep blessed shall the be thy
[13:23] basket and thy store blessed shalt thou
[13:26] Thou shalt be when thou comest in when
[13:29] thou goest out the Lord shall cause
[13:31] thine enemies that rise up against thee
[13:33] to be smitten before thy face they shall
[13:35] come out against thee one way and flee
[13:36] before the seven ways the Lord shall
[13:38] command the blessing upon thee in thy
[13:40] storehouses and all that thou set us thy
[13:42] hand unto do and he shall bless thee in
[13:45] the land which the Lord thy giveth Thee
[13:47] the Lord shall establish uh holy people
[13:49] un himself as he hath sworn unto thee if
[13:53] Thou shalt keep the Commandments of the
[13:55] Lord thy God and walk in his way so now
[13:58] now we see from the obedient heart from
[14:00] the heart
[14:02] obedience brings the blessings of God
[14:04] and he he and guess what looks look how
[14:06] he touches almost every area of your
[14:09] life when God touches it it's
[14:12] blessed blessed this and bless that
[14:14] bless your cattle and I don't know what
[14:16] all that back in that day I guess people
[14:18] wanted them to bless their cattle we
[14:20] don't have cattle here anybody have
[14:22] cattle but catch the principle bless my
[14:25] basket I mean something about basket
[14:27] there he shall bless your basket I don't
[14:28] know what that is but I want him to
[14:31] bless
[14:34] it you know Sunday I was reading that
[14:36] Proverbs 31 Woman I might as well say
[14:38] this and I brought out she was from
[14:40] Toledo because she could deal with the
[14:43] snow and I was text by uh someone in the
[14:47] church and says did you also read that
[14:49] she dresses her children in Scarlet not
[14:52] Ma and
[14:54] blue I said no I did not bring that out
[14:57] cuz I don't think that
[14:59] you can interpret it that
[15:02] way you're
[15:05] right you gotta be careful how you
[15:07] interpret the word
[15:08] now for
[15:10] sure but but look at look at how it is
[15:13] it's it's real simple it's that it's
[15:15] it's it comes down to an obedient heart
[15:17] to the things of God and if that if you
[15:21] lose that obedient heart and you start
[15:23] to say well that's not important anymore
[15:25] and you start to you and ultimately you
[15:27] find in your heart you just don't want
[15:28] to do those things then you're moving
[15:30] yourself away from God's
[15:34] world and God's blessing and all the
[15:37] package that goes with it right you're
[15:39] doing that God's not doing that you're
[15:41] doing that and then look at all the
[15:44] areas he can touch with blessing of your
[15:46] life just simply by obedience doesn't
[15:49] mean that you understand everything I
[15:51] don't find any scriptures here that say
[15:53] yeah you understand it that's right but
[15:54] you're being obedient to it so all the
[15:57] blessings of God pour and touches every
[15:59] area of your life just simply because of
[16:01] obedience to the word of God Amen has
[16:04] that principle changed no no because we
[16:07] can look at Romans 66 and16 it says know
[16:10] ye not that to whom you yield yourself
[16:13] servants to obey his servants ye are to
[16:15] whom you obey whether of sin unto death
[16:17] or of obedience un righteousness but God
[16:19] be thank that ye were the Servants of
[16:21] sin but ye have obeyed from the heart
[16:24] that form of Doctrine which was
[16:26] delivered unto you the principle goes in
[16:28] the New Testament uh Even book of Acts
[16:30] says he gave the Holy Ghost to them that
[16:33] obey him praise God obedience being the
[16:35] core thing there amen uh and he says but
[16:39] to me in the New Testament it goes
[16:41] deeper it's a deeper obedience because
[16:43] remember what I've been preaching that
[16:44] in the Old Testament on a soul level
[16:47] there's no way they could follow those
[16:49] precepts at a soul level because they
[16:52] had a serpent nature and Calvary hadn't
[16:53] come to deal with that serpent nature
[16:55] exactly right all right so here they had
[16:57] to follow him but it was mechanical they
[16:59] did it with all their heart their their
[17:01] emotions and their spirit and passion I
[17:03] believe they did but you see now from
[17:05] the heart of in the New Testament our
[17:08] obedience goes even deeper in the New
[17:11] Testament because it's required now that
[17:14] we do it from the heart that you have
[17:17] obeyed from the heart that form of
[17:19] Doctrine which was delivered unto you
[17:22] praise the Lord it says in 2 Corinthians
[17:24] 6:5 it says casting down imaginations
[17:27] and every High thing that exist exed
[17:28] itself above the knowledge of God
[17:30] against the knowledge of God and
[17:32] bringing into captivity every thought
[17:35] see how much deeper our obedience
[17:37] there's nothing said so much about this
[17:39] in the Old Testament but now we're
[17:40] bringing into obedience every thought
[17:43] captive to Christ praise God our
[17:46] obedience goes deeper in the New
[17:48] Testament exactly right because now
[17:51] we're obeying from the heart and now
[17:53] we're bringing any every thought captive
[17:56] to The Obedience of Christ the Lord just
[17:59] our outside and you know we don't do
[18:01] this we don't smoke and we don't drink
[18:03] and all these other things but every
[18:05] thought is under obedience we don't
[18:07] allow ourselves to just let our thoughts
[18:09] go off and as we said Sunday we don't
[18:11] give oursel permission for our words to
[18:13] say anything we want to say no they're
[18:15] under a law they're held by a law and so
[18:19] now our obedience grows deeper because
[18:21] we're we're now bringing every thought
[18:23] captive praise the Lord so now then then
[18:25] we find at the beginning of the Bible
[18:27] not me not going to comment too much on
[18:29] this but there's the things about the
[18:31] curses and blessings and and in the
[18:33] beginning Genesis chapter 3 we find that
[18:36] God begins Cur putting curses on certain
[18:38] things after the fall and those things
[18:41] even still continue till today and
[18:43] that's what they have to realize if
[18:44] there's a pronouncement of a curse some
[18:46] of those things are continuing even
[18:48] until today uh uh in in in and God
[18:52] cursing the Earth for for Adam he cursed
[18:54] the Earth and now we're still dealing
[18:56] with that curse it's going to be over
[18:58] some someday he's going to lift that
[18:59] curse because he went to Calvary and
[19:01] when he purchased an atonement for us he
[19:04] also purchased an atonement to redeem
[19:06] this Earth as well so we'll go back to
[19:08] Eden again can you say Amen so he's
[19:10] going to lift that curse but he he
[19:12] pronounced it back there and it's still
[19:15] on the Earth right amen he pronounced it
[19:18] on the serpent as well he pronounced the
[19:20] curse on the serpent it's still that way
[19:22] today praise the Lord so we could say
[19:25] that only God Only God Can lift a curse
[19:29] but when he lifts it he lifts
[19:31] it praise the Lord but now when we come
[19:35] to our text we realize here's a
[19:37] different type of thing with the family
[19:41] of Ain the Ain
[19:44] family here's a different type of curse
[19:47] it's different because it's there's a
[19:49] command that when you destroy Jericho
[19:51] the city is cursed and the stuff with it
[19:54] uh let's go go to that scripture because
[19:56] I want to make sure you know that where
[19:57] that says that that we were in Joshua
[19:59] chapter
[20:08] 7 oh some
[20:12] judges and so he says it here in Joshua
[20:16] chapter 6 and verse 17 and the city
[20:19] shall be accursed even it and all that
[20:23] are therein to the Lord only Rahab the
[20:26] Harlot shall live she and all that are
[20:28] with her in the house because she hid
[20:29] The Messengers that we sent she also had
[20:31] the token that they had asked for but
[20:33] everything else besides Rahab is under a
[20:36] curse everything that was in there right
[20:39] under a curse so that God proclaimed it
[20:42] there now when they went into fight the
[20:45] the the battle went great but somebody
[20:47] took the initial stage of the the the
[20:50] aen family uh somehow now brought
[20:53] something and put it into their tent hid
[20:54] it in their tent and so now there's
[20:56] trouble coming from the thing that they
[20:59] felt like that they could take into
[21:00] their tent trouble starts happening when
[21:03] you have a curse come in trouble starts
[21:05] happening there are things that we learn
[21:08] from this Saints I'm trying to keep this
[21:09] just as simple as I can but we learn
[21:12] something about this and that is that
[21:15] there are certain things that carry
[21:17] trouble with
[21:19] it and if we're going to act like the
[21:22] world or or some shallow Christian we're
[21:25] going to just say we're going to just
[21:27] pretend and be blind that it's not
[21:30] causing trouble but if it's causing
[21:32] trouble you got to fess up to
[21:35] it music many types of music bring the
[21:39] reaction and behavior of
[21:42] rebellion sometimes you can't tell it
[21:44] until maybe weeks down the road but
[21:46] certain types of music bring that
[21:48] manifestation of rebellion right bring a
[21:51] certain culture to it bring a thing that
[21:53] I want to dress like the world I want to
[21:54] act like I want to be sensual I want to
[21:56] be sexy uh some sometimes you don't have
[21:59] to see an image of a woman it comes with
[22:01] the spirit of the music and all a sudden
[22:03] the girl she wants to dress that way and
[22:05] it's coming through the music right so
[22:09] there's trouble that comes with that
[22:10] because that of course is not in Oneness
[22:12] with the direction that the the dad
[22:14] wants to leave the leave the home and so
[22:16] Trouble Comes and conflict comes and a
[22:18] lack of Oneness comes and it's not the
[22:21] kid and it's not you and it's not it's
[22:24] just something has come in that's
[22:27] causing trouble
[22:28] something's breaking the Oneness
[22:30] right so we really learned for that that
[22:33] there's there's trouble and the trouble
[22:35] the trouble was not seen until they went
[22:39] into the next battle right did you
[22:41] notice that the trouble was not detected
[22:44] until they had the next battle and they
[22:46] failed in the next battle that's right
[22:48] so that's really uh we should hold that
[22:50] in our hearts that sometimes we can't
[22:52] detect something but when we go about
[22:54] battling with the Enemy and go in our
[22:55] Christian walk and we realize wait a
[22:57] minute it it wasn't like it was before
[23:00] something's missing Something's Happened
[23:03] and you realize in this incident it was
[23:05] something that was cursed that was
[23:06] brought in and brought trouble with it
[23:09] and so if it hinders your spiritual
[23:10] battle then we've got to fess up and say
[23:13] hey something's happening here can you
[23:15] say Amen let me say this a Christian
[23:17] Life Is A Life That's fighting for your
[23:19] spiritual inheritance a Christian Life
[23:22] is in constant battle can you say amen
[23:24] and we have an enemy and we Pro we
[23:26] approach that battle with the confidence
[23:29] expecting a victory in every battle now
[23:32] it's you can't the Bible says in James a
[23:34] double-minded man is unstable in all his
[23:37] ways and so when he even goes to pray
[23:39] you can't have a a a a doubtful uh
[23:42] spirit when you go to pray that you
[23:44] don't really believe it's going to
[23:45] happen but I'm supposed to pray this and
[23:47] say this no he do that's
[23:50] double-mindedness when we go to pray we
[23:52] go with complete expectation and
[23:54] complete 100% confidence that God is is
[23:58] able to answer our prayer that's how God
[24:00] wants to us to approach it it's up to
[24:02] him what he does how he does it how long
[24:05] it takes but when we approach him he
[24:07] doesn't want
[24:09] double-mindedness and so now even when
[24:11] we go to battle the enemy he doesn't
[24:14] want us hesitating and he doesn't want
[24:16] us thinking I may not win this one he
[24:18] wants us expecting to win every battle
[24:21] amen that's how we approach battle as a
[24:24] Christian I'm going about this I'm I'm
[24:27] getting up this morning morning I'm
[24:28] going about this day to win and to
[24:30] overcome today not oh man I don't I
[24:33] don't even want to get up today come on
[24:36] now does that sound familiar to you I
[24:38] don't even want to get out of bed and
[24:40] that's when the Devil he's already
[24:41] intimidating you he don't even want to
[24:43] get out of bed I got him already but I
[24:47] like how brother Donnie says he gets up
[24:48] and says here I am devil I'm ready for
[24:50] you there's a confidence there can you
[24:53] say m and and and then all of Hell goes
[24:56] oh Lord she's up
[24:58] she got out of bed I'm going to have to
[25:00] deal with this daughter of God today I
[25:04] want to live such a Christian Life
[25:05] friends that it shakes hell every day
[25:07] they're scared to death of what I might
[25:10] sing what I might say what I might
[25:13] testify of how I might praise the lord
[25:15] they're nervous they're shaking in their
[25:17] boots because how I'm going to live that
[25:20] day and that's the way it should be
[25:22] every day amen that's good not
[25:25] intimidated by the enemy but going
[25:26] forward and being aggressive in our
[25:29] battle and expecting victories can you
[25:31] say Amen not double-minded but expecting
[25:33] victories we fight to win
[25:36] yes Winning is Everything To Us amen
[25:41] don't apply that to volleyball but apply
[25:43] it to your battle in with the Enemy can
[25:46] you say
[25:49] Amen so now this to We Fight to win this
[25:52] is our priority as a Christian I said it
[25:54] at the beginning of the service I'm
[25:56] going to say it again this this is our
[25:58] priority as a Christian anything that
[26:01] stands in the
[26:03] way of you becoming a Spirit-filled full
[26:07] of Faith mature growing and conquering
[26:11] more than uh more than a conquering type
[26:14] believer anything that stands in that
[26:17] way is your enemy yes amen because
[26:20] that's the
[26:21] goal there is no other goal can you say
[26:23] that's why we're here that's why we are
[26:26] Christians it's not to be a nominal
[26:28] Christian or a a status quo Christian
[26:31] but an overcoming Christian a testifier
[26:34] Christian a Praying Christian a
[26:36] Spirit-filled Christian am can I get an
[26:39] amen amen that's the goal that's what we
[26:42] need to be that's if you don't feel like
[26:45] you're there tonight then make that your
[26:47] goal say God I want to be that type of
[26:49] Christian amen because that's what it's
[26:51] all about is being overcoming a a more
[26:53] than conqueror uh believer standing
[26:56] there it's not to make money or be good
[26:58] in the community community or to do
[27:00] these different things or you know it's
[27:01] not just that but it's to be an
[27:03] overcoming Christian it even goes above
[27:05] Outreach it goes above our witness to
[27:07] the world you know why I say that
[27:09] because really if you're not a
[27:10] Spirit-filled Christian you don't really
[27:12] have that Faith testimony to to be salty
[27:16] to somebody you're going to outreach
[27:18] amen they don't want to see a dead cold
[27:21] formal person that feels like they're
[27:23] under
[27:25] bondage so what's first our w
[27:28] no our first is staying spirit filled so
[27:31] that we're ready to be a proper
[27:33] witness blessed be his
[27:36] name praise the
[27:38] Lord talk to God about the people before
[27:42] you talk to the people about God Amen
[27:46] that's what brother Ram said talk to God
[27:48] about the people before you talk to the
[27:50] people about God good you're not in
[27:52] close harmony with him all the that's
[27:55] why we want to stay anointed if if I
[27:57] know my commission and know my position
[27:59] like to doing walking in that and know
[28:01] my place and I'm anointed for the job
[28:04] then I don't have to worry about what
[28:05] I'll have to be what I'll have to say
[28:07] he'll give it to me to say in that hour
[28:10] Jesus said don't pre-think what you're
[28:12] going to say it'll be given to you in
[28:13] that hour when you're brought up before
[28:15] the councils and you're brought up here
[28:16] and you're you're challenged and put on
[28:19] trial but like Jesus said by the world
[28:21] put on trial when you're put up there he
[28:23] said we're not leaning on our intellect
[28:25] we're leaning on the anointing that's
[28:26] within usen and he'll give you what to
[28:28] say in that hour if you stay spirit
[28:30] filled stay prayed up stay fasting and
[28:32] praying and stay before him that's right
[28:35] this is a Christian walk this is our
[28:39] goal it's becoming a person that goes
[28:42] from Victory to Victory to Victory
[28:45] inheriting God's promise and even the
[28:48] promise of the Rapture can you say
[28:50] Amen have I described is this your
[28:53] desire tonight this is the Christian
[28:55] that we want to be going from from
[28:57] Victory to Victory inheriting God's
[28:59] promises taking a hold of God's promises
[29:02] we expect this life because he said he
[29:05] would fight for us and that's what he
[29:06] said in Joshua 1 Joshua 1 I'll fight my
[29:08] battle I'll fight the battles for you
[29:11] they didn't have to do anything but
[29:12] stand there in obedience and shout and
[29:14] blow the horns at Jericho and God
[29:16] brought all the walls down God fought
[29:18] God did the work am that's a perfect
[29:21] battle Jericho was a perfect battle
[29:23] right it's the way it's supposed to
[29:24] happen and when you have the perfect one
[29:26] to start out with Joshua was going into
[29:28] Ai and Joshua was going what happened
[29:31] what's going wrong right because he said
[29:35] he'd fight our battles for us
[29:37] right and he would destroy the enemy and
[29:40] all these other promises he makes and
[29:42] all of a sudden now they lose 36 men and
[29:44] Joshua was crying out to God in chapter
[29:47] 7 verse 7 and Joshua said alas oh Lord
[29:51] God wherefore hast thou at all brought
[29:53] this people into Jordan to deliver us
[29:55] into the hand of the amorites to destroy
[29:56] us would to God we had been content and
[29:58] one on the other side of Jordan oh Lord
[30:00] what shall I say when Israel turth their
[30:02] backs before the enemies verse 6 says
[30:04] Joshua Ren his clothes and fell to the
[30:06] Earth upon his face before the Ark of
[30:08] the Lord until the evening tide he
[30:10] ritten his clothes he fell down before
[30:12] God what over over a battle that wasn't
[30:15] didn't go like it should go that's how
[30:18] we should
[30:19] live that's how we should live amen Lord
[30:23] what's going wrong what happened Lord
[30:28] why did I fail in this battle what
[30:30] happened here what's what's going on I
[30:32] was I'm an overcomer in this hour
[30:35] something's
[30:36] wrong that I can't overcome this or I
[30:38] didn't follow through with this or
[30:40] something happened and I lost this
[30:42] battle do we have that cry in our heart
[30:44] Lord what happened show me in my life
[30:48] what's wrong this Sunday when I go to
[30:49] church have the minister be anointed to
[30:52] put his finger on that thing in my life
[30:55] something's wrong that's how I go to
[30:58] church let him let him rip my hide if he
[31:01] has to let him expose everything that's
[31:03] secret let him take every let him talk
[31:06] about every Babylonian garment that I'm
[31:08] hiding because it's about winning
[31:11] victories not about justifying what I
[31:13] want to hold on to in my life and hide
[31:15] it's about winning victories as a
[31:17] Christian can you say amen that's what
[31:19] we're here for not to blend in and be
[31:22] become so that we blend in better no
[31:24] we're here to win victories and live the
[31:26] manifested
[31:27] of Jesus Christ in this hour
[31:30] am Hallelujah so Joshua cried out at AI
[31:34] he says something went wrong why he's
[31:37] expecting Victory that's the way it
[31:38] should be expecting the victory that it
[31:40] should be if not we've got to find the
[31:43] trouble and what killed it was a family
[31:46] that chose to use something that carried
[31:49] trouble with it chose to bring it into
[31:50] their tent and they couldn't see the
[31:53] trouble until later are we getting the
[31:56] point tonight
[31:58] isn't the Bible just Rich isn't the word
[32:01] Rich isn't it relevant for our lives
[32:03] right now they brought something in that
[32:06] they didn't notice was going to bring
[32:07] trouble but it started to bring
[32:09] trouble it had it brought a curse on the
[32:12] whole
[32:13] thing and they couldn't see it and there
[32:15] were there are many
[32:17] things that carry a curse with it and we
[32:20] must look for it if you know it is
[32:24] before and someone's warned you of it
[32:27] then really we should stay away from it
[32:30] anyway all
[32:32] right but a lot of times we don't do
[32:35] that I don't care that brother Paul said
[32:38] it I don't care some of the older ones
[32:39] in the church that have grown in the
[32:41] Lord they learned been there done that
[32:42] got the
[32:44] T-shirt no I'm gonna do this I'm gonna
[32:48] I'm gonna have this if someone else has
[32:50] said that brings death in your life that
[32:52] kills your Christian walk we got to
[32:54] listen to them amen
[32:57] you got a host of Christians that are
[32:59] inheriting the promises you got like
[33:02] like I I I'd follow brother Lonnie and
[33:04] Brother Rich Cobb and all these
[33:05] different ones these older ones that I
[33:07] could see in their lives they inherit
[33:08] their Pro they weren't perfect but they
[33:10] were inheriting the promises of God they
[33:12] were moving on to the maturity of God
[33:13] they were moving on of what a Christian
[33:15] should be and uh and a lot of times I
[33:19] thought brother Lonnie I would think you
[33:21] know I appreciate being around him but I
[33:23] realize that some of stuff I'm
[33:24] struggling with and trying to overcome
[33:27] and this like you know I'll bet he he
[33:29] overcome that years ago if I was to talk
[33:30] to him about that it's kind of like he
[33:32] he'd go yeah yeah been there done that
[33:34] and he's he's overcome it he won that
[33:35] battle a long time ago it's nice to be
[33:37] around people like that but it's also
[33:40] nice to be around them when they say
[33:41] listen I I tried that and that brought
[33:44] trouble in my life I tried to do that
[33:47] and I tried to do this and tonight I'm
[33:49] not giving specifics but you know I
[33:54] can I'm not going to make anybody angry
[33:56] here tonight tonight I want you to take
[33:59] a principle that's laying right here in
[34:00] the Bible and realize you better check
[34:02] what you bring in your homes what you
[34:04] listen to in music what you let your
[34:06] eyes see everything you do on it may
[34:10] carry a curse with it right on clothing
[34:13] styles carry a spirit with them
[34:18] amen so in movies and music and all
[34:21] these other things and guess what
[34:23] another thing
[34:25] ideas come on now
[34:27] good the wisdom of this world some of it
[34:30] can carry curse with it exactly right
[34:33] brother and trouble start to
[34:36] come and you look for what's
[34:39] happening and the main thing is there's
[34:41] a loss in spiritual life and a dad has
[34:44] to say there's a loss here in my family
[34:46] there's a loss here and I appreciate any
[34:49] man that's taking a look at that and
[34:51] saying what's what's the cause of the
[34:55] loss what's the reason and that man as a
[34:58] man addresses that and finds out what it
[35:00] is and makes changes whatever changes
[35:03] have to be
[35:04] made amen amen if if you if if you are
[35:10] not growing and feeding then you have a
[35:15] responsibility to pray and find the
[35:18] church the pastor the place where your
[35:21] family and wife is growing and feeding
[35:24] on the word of
[35:25] God don't let that go on cuz because
[35:28] that's not good right right find that
[35:31] because that's crucial that's everything
[35:34] that you're growing and becoming an
[35:35] overcoming
[35:37] Christian Every Man Has a responsibility
[35:39] to do that but I want to say the wisdom
[35:41] of this world it can carry a curse with
[35:43] it it can carry trouble with it can you
[35:45] say Amen to where we we some we quit
[35:48] growing we we we're feeding on things
[35:50] that's wrong we start losing battles
[35:53] we're feeding on worldly things that we
[35:54] didn't do before we're falling away from
[35:57] the Lord and somebody has to say it's
[36:00] not supposed to be this
[36:01] way where am I at now what's going on
[36:04] with my life I mean something's
[36:07] changed and I'm actually hungering for
[36:10] those things and I'm and and I I'm
[36:12] wanting those things that I didn't want
[36:13] before and you have to take into account
[36:16] that something is cursed or something's
[36:19] bringing that trouble hindering your
[36:21] walk with the
[36:23] Lord man's ideas thoughts Som times that
[36:27] are presented on the
[36:29] internet
[36:30] ideas the wisdom of this
[36:33] world can carry a curse with
[36:38] it the interpretations concluded on at
[36:43] Nia still carry a curse with them today
[36:46] right it's been cursed ever since then
[36:49] till today when they concocted the three
[36:51] persons in the Trinity that had a curse
[36:53] on it from that point and it still has a
[36:55] curse on it today
[36:57] so that's man's ideas getting WEA
[37:00] getting together and discussing the word
[37:02] and coming up with man's conclusion on a
[37:05] truth that lays there that God is in
[37:07] three offices but they interpreted their
[37:10] way and soon as they did a curse came on
[37:12] it and then if someone who believes it
[37:15] comes into that they come under the same
[37:18] curse exactly right so thoughts can
[37:21] carry curse movies all these other
[37:22] things I'm not going to be specific I
[37:24] want you to take it as a Christian to
[37:25] realize you you have to examine your own
[37:27] life you have to see if there's trouble
[37:30] that comes in your spiritual walk you
[37:32] ask the Lord to expose it and you say do
[37:35] I have something that I'm hiding in my
[37:37] life praise the Lord adoption brother
[37:40] Ram says as we just bring it to a close
[37:42] tonight the land was provided and
[37:44] divvied up by
[37:47] inspiration and I could take the
[37:49] scriptures and show you to it exactly
[37:51] that he put them in the place where they
[37:53] were supposed to be positionally in the
[37:55] promised land how that two and a half
[37:57] tribes was to stay across the river how
[37:59] that their mothers cried that in that
[38:00] birth and how that that place that each
[38:03] place was supposed to be and now after
[38:05] you are in that don't mean that you're
[38:07] out free from war you still have to
[38:09] fight for every inch inch of ground that
[38:11] you stand on Canaan did not represent
[38:15] Heaven because its war and its troubles
[38:18] and its killings and its fightings and
[38:20] so forth but it did represent this that
[38:23] a man must be a perfect walk
[38:28] and there's where the church is failing
[38:29] today on that walk do you know that even
[38:32] your uh your own behavior can knock
[38:35] somebody else out of getting
[38:39] healed your misbehavior of unconfessed
[38:42] Sins Of You Believers can cause this
[38:44] church to bitterly fail that's right and
[38:48] at the day of judgment you'll be
[38:50] responsible for every bit of it oh you
[38:51] say now wait a minute brother Brown well
[38:53] that's the truth of it think of it your
[38:55] misbehavior and uncon confess sin
[38:57] unconfessed sin has great effects uh
[39:00] terrible effects upon the body of Christ
[39:02] and families that's right terrible
[39:05] effect on a family had a daddy that's
[39:07] held something and not confessed it
[39:08] before the Lord or to his wife for many
[39:11] years it's going to have profound
[39:14] effects on that family and those
[39:16] children and nobody knows what's what's
[39:18] trouble what's going on what what's
[39:20] taking place well somebody hasn't
[39:21] confessed a sin it's just laying there
[39:23] and brother BR says the devil has a
[39:24] right to sit right there on unconfessed
[39:26] sin that demon has a right to stay there
[39:28] until it's confessed and then demons are
[39:30] cast out through
[39:32] confession Joshua after he crossed over
[39:34] the land God gave them a promise just
[39:37] think to fight an entire campaign
[39:39] without losing a man without even
[39:41] getting a scratch without having to have
[39:42] a nurse or first aid or Band-Aid God
[39:46] said the land's yours go fight think of
[39:48] a fighting campaign and there's no Red
[39:50] Cross around at all that was Jericho
[39:54] there's no Red Cross there's no nobody
[39:56] going to get hurt and they slayed the
[39:58] amorites and Hittites but there wasn't
[39:59] one hurt among them any of them until
[40:02] sin come in the camp and when achen took
[40:03] that Babylon garment in the cold wedge
[40:05] and hid it under his Camp then the next
[40:07] day they lost 16 men Jos Joshua said
[40:10] stop stop wait a minute wait a minute
[40:12] there's something wrong something is
[40:14] wrong here we're we're going to call
[40:16] seven days of fast God made a promise
[40:19] there will be nothing hurt us our
[40:21] enemies will fall at our feet and
[40:22] there's something wrong here something
[40:25] went wrong somewhere because we've got
[40:27] 16 dead laying here they're Israelite
[40:29] brothers it wasn't 16 it was 36 brother
[40:31] Bram said 16 and it was um according to
[40:35] chapter 7 verse 5 it was
[40:38] 36 we got 16 maybe more I believe 16 men
[40:41] that was dead Joshua called and said
[40:44] there's something wrong God made the
[40:46] promise and and something's wrong and
[40:49] when we bring the sick up before us and
[40:52] they fail to be healed we need to call a
[40:54] solemn fast and call an assembly
[40:56] something's wrong somewhere God made the
[40:59] promise God's got to stick to that
[41:02] promise and he will do it amen amen and
[41:06] amen praise the Lord that we could
[41:09] actually have a part in affecting
[41:11] somebody I know none of you would want
[41:13] to do that would you if someone come up
[41:15] for prayer and they really need healing
[41:17] healing none of you in your hearts would
[41:20] want to say that I want to be the
[41:21] hindrance to them getting the H all of
[41:23] us say no I want them to get healed
[41:24] because I know how I feel when I'm sick
[41:27] right and if I got a disease or
[41:28] something like that I want the people of
[41:30] God to cry out and I want my healing to
[41:32] I want wouldn't want anybody hindering
[41:34] my
[41:36] healing and so because I know that about
[41:39] you that sincerely you wouldn't want to
[41:42] but you might have blinders on to
[41:44] realize that sometimes if there's a
[41:47] curse on something and you're justifying
[41:50] it that could be the thing that could
[41:54] limit the power of God and the Spirit
[41:56] flowing in the
[41:58] assembly as long as you know that that's
[42:00] a possibility and examine your life and
[42:02] say I don't want to be the I don't want
[42:04] my family to be the the aen family I
[42:07] don't want my family to be the aen
[42:09] family I want my family to be a family
[42:12] of
[42:13] faith I want my family to be a family of
[42:16] Holiness how many believe in Holiness
[42:19] true Holiness I want my family to be a
[42:22] family that's faithful to God I want my
[42:24] family even with all of our and mistakes
[42:26] and everything else to be constantly
[42:28] laying Our Lives before God I want my
[42:30] teach my children to be
[42:32] repentant that they know how to repent
[42:34] when they and to own up to it if they do
[42:36] something wrong if they bring a bad
[42:38] spirit in the home or something to to
[42:40] say I made a mistake pops forgive me
[42:43] let's go to go God and ask forgiveness I
[42:45] love it when Brokenness is in my
[42:48] children all the mistakes doesn't matter
[42:51] if you have Brokenness and sensitivity
[42:54] to the spirit of God being welcome in
[42:56] the
[42:57] home and if somebody does something or
[43:00] brings in this or the song and you know
[43:04] of course I'm you know I I sniff things
[43:06] out un like brother Diggs you know I try
[43:08] to sniff things out too quickly but oh
[43:11] how I love it when the whole family's in
[43:13] harmony to keep their discernment on to
[43:15] always be watching if something's
[43:17] changed the tone of the
[43:21] home would to God we had teenagers and
[43:24] children and parents everyone with that
[43:27] kind of
[43:28] sensitivity brother Ram says that I want
[43:30] to live such a life to the least little
[43:32] bit of grieving I would know it right
[43:37] away soon as I find out to make it right
[43:40] in Brokenness and say let's let's
[43:42] correct this right now because the
[43:44] quality of his presence in our home is
[43:47] priority us walking with him and his
[43:50] presence being here and something that
[43:52] that drives that presence away that's
[43:54] not in harmony with what we stand for
[43:56] and what we
[43:58] believe oh my family we got a long way
[44:00] to go I'm just being honest with you we
[44:03] got a long way to
[44:04] go but in the word is the
[44:07] goal and let me leave you with this
