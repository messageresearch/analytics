TRANSCRIPT
========================================
um i want to preach a sermon tonight and hopefully this will be something that the youth will be able to identify with something that i was inspired by from a trip that i took to israel a few years ago and something that i saw while i was there and this sermon just kind of developed and um i think i might have only preached it once but i pres i pray tonight that it'll be a blessing to your heart shall we stand and we'll just read just a couple verses from the book of daniel chapter six and again i thank god for my wife my daughter and uh my one of my other daughters had to fly back this afternoon sarah had to go back home she has to be to work tomorrow but i was glad she was able to be here last night and amen the last few days as well as this morning so i trust that god will give her traveling mercies amen all right um daniel 6 and i want to start reading at verse 10. it reads now now when daniel knew that the writing was signed he went into his house and his windows being open in his chamber toward jerusalem he kneeled upon his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his god as he did a fourth time then these men assembled and found daniel praying making supplication before his god then they came near and spake before the king concerning the king's decree has thou not signed a decree that every man that shall ask a petition of any god or man within 30 days save thee o king shall be cast into the den of lions the king answered and said the thing is true according to the law of the medes and persians which altereth not verse 13 then answered they and said before the king that daniel which is of the children of the captivity of judah regardeth not thee uh o o king nor the decree that thou has signed but maketh his petition three times a day shall we just bow in a word of prayer father we thank you for the reading of the word of god may the holy spirit now come and make what we've read applicable to our lives even today lord use the scripture to quicken us and god may you have your way in the service and the preaching of the word that you've had your way in our time of worship be glorified be magnified we take every spirit that's against the spirit of god underneath the control of the holy spirit even right now in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen god bless you can be seated our title tonight amen is simply christian conviction amen christian conviction um just want to start us by reading um something here from the message witnesses brother branham preaches this in 1953 uh april 5th uh 1953 it says then these children of israel these shadrach and meshach and abednego god's witnesses says god's never been without a witness he always now here i want you to get this real close god has never at any time been without a witness on earth praise god so that means in every generation uh god is going to have at least one person that he can put his finger on and say that's my witness right amen and my encouragement is you be that person that god can say this is my witness glory to god amen he says uh i want you to get this real close god has never at any time been without a witness on earth he always had at least one man he could put his hands on and say that's my witness it's come down to one man one time and job was his only witness now think about that um god's i mean here brother branham's told that god god thought that job was his only witness oh my now job's friends that came and approached him he would make it uh they would make us think that they were more righteous than joke right they were i mean just the way that they were handling job and the way they were talking to them and and everything but but but what god says through his prophet is that job was the only witness at that time and the other thing that we need to know about job's situation is that before job went through the trial there was a conversation that was conducted in heaven amen and it was god himself that asked satan have you considered my servant job and then what i want you to get get from that is that before you go through the trial god has probably already had a conversation about you have you considered this brother have you considered this it's because god has confidence and he knows that you have the strength to make it through whatever it is that's coming your way all things will work together for good because you love god and you are called according to his purpose he says have you considered my servant job he says there's not a righteous one like him on the earth he was god's witness look at this the prophet says it's come down to one man one time and job was his only witness and abraham in the land but god had a witness somebody's going to witness for god somewhere somebody's going to witness for god somewhere now after a while we find out uh what a witness really is of the of this day all right notice these men as they went down there they refused to eat the king's meat drink his wine and they refused to bow to his image they were a genuine true witness of god now brother branham's just talking about the three hebrew boys and you know and um the hebrew boys as they were coming into this land that uh they were not born in uh this was a land of captivity it was a land of bondage that the children israel found themselves in but in the midst of being in this this place the three hebrew boys had a certain level of conviction hallelujah amen and what i want to get you to uh to see conviction is a fixed or firm belief conviction means fixed or firm belief and and it's one thing for your your parents to have conviction but it's another thing when the young people begin to stand up with their own convictions hallelujah it's a fixed or firm belief that no i will not do this and no i will not do that no it's not because mama said noah daddy said no it's because there's something on the inside of me that says no to what the devil's offering me the hebrew boys demonstrated this you know and uh and this quote that brother branham has given us uh they showed that when they were called there uh into the land of babylon uh in a nation that uh again it's a nation where they're experiencing bondage but it come to a point where here they got brought before the king's presence the king said you know what these are some very wise men and and i want to give them some of my food i want to do this and i want to do that and they say uh no we don't want your meat we don't eat that they have certain laws that they were living by as children of israel said we're not going to do that even though we have a certain status in the kingdom we're still not going to accept what you are presenting to us they say now just let us eat the pulse and amen which was vegetables and things of that nature let us eat that and prove us in 10 days to see if we're just as healthy as the other men that are here and and and the the guard allowed them to just the guard accepted the challenge and allowed them to do this and god proved that he was with those hebrew boys but the reason that they did that is because they had a conviction they were still abiding by the laws of god even though they were not in the land that they were born in hallelujah amen it goes to show as the scripture says thy word have i hid in my heart that i might not sin against you and as young people i want to encourage you hide the word of god in your heart because you will be tried on what you believe and you have to be able to stand on your personal convictions it goes on in this quote says then there's something he said in there sometimes a penalty goes with a witness says sometimes a penalty goes with a witness if you if you choose to be a witness sometimes there's going to be a penalty that comes along with that it's not going to be easy all the time right sometimes you're going to have to suffer some things to be a witness for christ there's these sensed in there sometimes a penalty goes with the witness sometimes when you witness with god you have to suffer a little bit hey man he says you remember when mother told you that you couldn't stay around home as long as you read the bible and carried on so you know there uh he's he's using a a a a a situation here where maybe a young person gets kicked out of the house because they're standing for christ this happens everywhere all over the world young people get kicked out of get get kicked out of the the home uh the the song that we sing uh oh lord help me with that uh it'll come to me oh my my my uh the story is there was a man in india oh the song is i have decided to follow jesus i have decided no turning back no turning back the the cross before me of the world behind me no turning back no turning back they said that the way that that song was birthed the way that song was written is because this man had decided that he was going to follow christ and they the the leaders of this tribe say hey if you're going to follow christ i'm going to have to kill your family and now they bring his children before and uh he starts singing a song i have decided to follow jesus i have decided to follow jesus uh no turning back no torment are you sure about your conviction he says yes i'm i'm very sure he says we're going to have to kill your kids all of them die right down the spot he says the cross before me the world behind me the cross before me the world behind me and says okay we got to take your wife next are you sure you want to follow jesus he said yes i'm sure i'm going to follow jesus then they took his wife out and he just you know just burst after verse begin no turning back no turning back no turning back no you know no matter what i got to go through no turning back it says if you're if you're not willing to denounce this we're going to have to take your life as well it says that's fine it's no turning back he had a conviction but his man lost his family lost his wife even lost his own life but after he died the king of that tribe said you know what you know the leader of the tribe he says if this man is willing to give his life for this for for christianity then i want the whole tribe to change and start following christianity because this man was willing to be a witness no turning back no turning back sometimes to be a witness it causes you to suffer the prophet says you remember when mother told you you couldn't stay around home and as long as you read the bible and carried on or some of the neighbors said of the children said at school you was a fanatic it says or something because you were you was a true witness remember on the job how all the men laughed at you because you was a real witness see how on the streets you were made fun of with when you give a testimony but that's a genuine sign of a real true witness god wants witnesses says now some people say i testify in church that's good it says but brother let your light shine in the dark places where it's really needed out in the hedges and the highways in the bar rooms out down on the street everywhere you're at let your light shine as a witness amen noticed in the fiery trial come on and every man that a witness with god will have to go through fiery trials we have to tell it like it is christianity amen there's a cause for us to even be christians christ had to give his life in order for us to be able to accept eternal life hallelujah so it's got to be a cost on our part hallelujah amen in order to serve him and we have to be determined that we're going to stand as witnesses for this day we must have christian conviction it says uh god every man that a witness with god will have to go through fiery trials isn't it strange how god leads his people very strange again conviction is a fixed or firm belief now um i want to just say it seems as the world gets further and further and closer and closer to the coming of the lord further and further along seems our conviction levels are dwindling hallelujah things we would have never done years ago are being done now with no conviction it's the truth anyhow i won't necessarily go through a whole list i'll just make the statement things that amen that would have never been done years ago we seem to do it now with no conviction at all hallelujah uh i want to say this sometimes young people will come from overseas and uh you know they have certain convictions in the countries in which they live but when they get here in this culture they begin to compromise a little bit and their convictions begin to just kind of dwindle and they don't have any conviction anymore and we say this everybody else is doing it see everybody else might not be a true witness but god is looking for one person that will rise up and say i will be your witness you know if god has one witness in your city that one witness will testify their life will testify against everybody else god only needs one i remember uh you know i'll use this as an example something where conviction is dwindling i was i was eating one day at a chick-fil-a and i noticed this um the worker at chick-fil-a see you know uh back in our when i was a younger person we didn't have these devices uh you didn't go to work with this in your pocket that was a that was no you would never be caught talking on the telephone right around the boss you never you never see that happen but now uh as i was at the at the restaurant sitting i saw the young lady sneak out to go take out the garbage now it looked like she was working that she was taking out the garbage but really her purpose for getting to the trash is so she can pull out her phone and start doing certain things on the phone and she's just kind of looking around and saying well who's looking at me you know i don't want to get caught because i might lose my job they'll see that i'm on my phone and i'm not really working see i mean now there was something there telling her that what she was doing was wrong something began to tell her that what she's doing is wrong that's why she's looking around hallelujah many of you hey man you go through certain things like that in your life and you know something in you is telling you that you're doing wrong it's good when you have something in you to tell you that you're doing wrong when you really have a problem is that when that when that thing is not there anymore to tell you that you're doing wrong because you have accepted it as normal behavior we got to have christian conviction there was a time where people would not even take pit paper or a pen from their job because they considered that stealing now young people probably say oh that that's just too much this was the level of conviction right i'm not gonna i didn't buy the paper i didn't buy the pen so why am i taking it from somebody that i did not buy from that was stealing right this was christian conviction i'm talking about maybe 30 years ago 40 years ago that was the level of conviction can i go a little further you know brother branham has some conviction his conviction was way up here one time brother branham was crossing the border and he had uh his luggage in the car and the border patrol so happened to ask him say do you have any peanuts or anything in your car he says no i don't i don't have peanuts in my car nope i didn't pack anything so i'm let let's go on he says okay go on through he drove three hours from the border when he got three hours and got to his hotel i'm talking late at night maybe 12 1 o'clock in the morning he arrives at the hotel he starts unpacking the luggage to get into the hotel and at the very bottom of his luggage were peanuts so he told his son now hallelujah how many can really be honest and say that our level conviction i'll be honest i'll be the first one to admit it both hands up god i don't know if my conviction is there right uh his his conviction was that you know what uh get back in the car billy for what we got to go back to the border patrol for what it says i told the man of the border patrol that i didn't have peanuts and i got peanuts here i got to go back can we just go in the morning no we have to go now got back in the car drove back down just to just to report that i have peanuts not that i stole money not that i have peanuts i told you that i didn't have them and i do have them his level of conviction was something that we all need to have he turned around took the peanuts back and then came three six hours added to the trip that's the level of conviction hallelujah recently uh and i'll just have to be honest because something happened to me i was i was um i went in through the line at chipotle to get something to eat and and i paid for the food and i forgot to tell them i mean i had already eaten and everything was already home and i forgot to tell them that i had um cauliflower rice in there useful to tell them that because they're going to charge you extra money i actually forgot to tell them so i didn't know how to go back and tell them uh i need y'all to charge me a little extra money because i i i did get cauliflower rice and um you didn't charge it for i didn't know how to how how's this going to work when i go back in here they're probably going to look at me and say this guy is really strange but the next time i went in i just told i did i i got cauliflower rice i didn't have it i was paying for when i had before i had cauliflower rice the last time charged me i wanted to get that off my conscience it's only two dollars but i didn't want two dollars to hinder a blessing [Applause] we didn't go certain places because of our convictions we didn't hang out in certain atmospheres because of our convictions we didn't use certain language because of our christian conviction amen we actually didn't even take certain jobs because of our convictions certain careers we wouldn't go into because of our convictions hallelujah we didn't listen to certain music because of our convictions and so we got to keep this level of conviction because we want the presence of god to dwell with us wherever we are hallelujah i remember while i was in israel i was standing in the city of caesarea caesarea philippi i believe it uh no no caesarea just caesarea uh and as i was standing there they had the the palace ruins of herod and our guide that was leading us through uh israel he was telling us he says this is where um gladiators would fight animals and uh and then eventually the gladiators start fighting one another this was the sport of the day and as i was sitting there and listening to what the guy was saying i i recall a particular quote where brother random talked about a man that was a gladiator that refused to do something because of his conviction i want to read this to you in the message the testimony of a true witness brother randall says becky my daughter was reading to me the gladiators the other night said listen to this daddy i cannot at this time i'm sorry i can't call the name but a young christian had been thrown out as a gladiator to fight at the roman arena it says i've stood in that arena praying the old walls are falling in and and when they could set there uh they just loved to see them they had to kill one another god speaking in the old days they just meet one another and kill one another and that was it god was against that god was against that it says in one uh one of the very first signs of christianity i want you to catch this statement one of the very first signs of christianity uh is to refuse to kill a man that's right you can kill him more ways than just sticking him with a knife speaking against his character many ways you can do it it says but this gladiator they turned a loose i mean they turned a lion loose on him and with the strength and power of god he killed that lion with a sword and knife says the people clapped it was gallant they stood up they turned another one loose and they killed it with the sword and they turned a man a loose a great big tall dark african pagan and this christian had to fight him which he didn't want to do but in the fight he knocked the african down had his sword right up over him of course the african said sir kill me quickly so i won't suffer don't torture me kill me quickly the christian threw over his sword took off his armor walked out before the emperor and said emperor i'm a christian and my lord and savior forbids us to take one another's life i'll take the life of a wild beast but not of my brother he says i refuse to kill a man the emperor at the time was pretty upset that this man refused to kill another man he says you're going to defy our laws and the things that we set in place they what we what we want we want to see people die you kill the animals now kill this man he says i'm a christian this was his conviction i'm a christian and i refuse to kill a man thou shalt not kill i'm gonna exercise my right to follow the word of god he says you know what since you won't kill him he told he spoke to the other guy says his opponent get up and kill the christian you know what he did got up and killed a christian and the christian died with his arms outside says god i honor your word he had conviction look at this hallelujah i was um just thinking on this and you know when we think about conviction that we we just don't want to lose it brother branham was talking to a man in this little quote here he's talking to a man and the man was explaining to him what what what conviction is he saying you know what a conscience is he says yeah i think i know he said but what is it to you he says you know a conscience is like four points that's over your heart and it says those four points when something happens and you know something has gone wrong in life it says they they turn and they just kind of it gives you that feeling on the inside it just that conscious is turning it says it says what happens you do something else wrong and maybe you lie about something it turns again it says and and you lie about another thing and it turns again it says eventually it keeps turning until it just kind of cuts a little space in your heart that you don't feel anything anymore brother branham gave the testimony brother billy paul i believe shared this now and i'll share this and i'll move on a little further in this we gotta have christian conviction he talked about you know when we talk about losing conviction there's a story brother brandon brings out about these sisters that were sunday school teachers and um you know they would they would when they were at church they were very righteous very holy but when they got away from church they lost their religion so they got into hotel rooms and and then they would do certain things at the hotels that you know the husband wasn't there parents weren't there they did all kinds of things that were against god's word and they would just run down the hotel room with a bottle of a liquor in one hand and maybe a cigarette another hand they just said yippee this is life brother branham says he pulled one up to the side and said no this is not life this is death this life that you're living is going to lead you to a hell that you don't want to go to they say you say this is death it's not life after they got a hold of him and began to witness to him the conviction set in and they began to make things right with god i want to tell you don't don't uh don't ever get yourself into a situation where you have allowed those four points to turn till you get to a spot where you no longer have any convictions the story of these parents young parents brother branham told the story about them in ohio he's in this message life it says a few days ago down in ohio in a court they said that all children had to be sent to college they they want no illiteracy in ohio and the amish people don't send their children to these modern high schools and they've never had on record of all the amish history of one case of juvenile delinquency it says let them dress different and act different and be peculiar and act and they haven't had no juvenile delinquency not one case on their records of america they don't send them they don't send them to them kinds of places and they pass the law that they had they had they have to go uh their own high schools and colleges it says and the old mother and father was was called in because they didn't send their son and the judge said you'll either send them or you'll serve two years in prison i was in middletown ohio at the time it happened and the father said i refuse to do it sir not for being different but but because that i come to america thinking that this was freedom of religion we don't have no more democracy brother branham says he says freedom of religion he said you'll either abide by our laws or you'll pay the penalty like the rest of them would he said i refuse to send them the judge says so i sent us you and the mother two years in the penitentiary so because he refused to send his kids to the public school he was just gonna homeschool them that was a parent's choice nothing wrong with that but because he refused to do it according to the law this was his conviction they said we're going to sentence you to penitentiary here brother branham say the last flower democracy faded in that courtroom the father got up and said very well i'll spend it to save my son it says i don't want any of your rock and rolls in your nonsense and when he started out the unjust judge tried to justify himself by saying that remember and this is what happens with you know when the devil tries to get you into a certain spot the devil will actually quote scripture to you to try to justify what he's trying to trap you in that's why you have to know the scripture for yourself in order to combat the enemy so so the judge to justify himself he just yells out while they're sending the young this this father to the penitentiary along with his wife he says he says it says remember the scripture says give caesar's what caesars hallelujah and he turned around and his father turned around and he said and and to god was god's that was his conviction say yeah remember to give caesar's what deceivers but the rest of that scripture says give to god was god's and these children that god gave me i gave them back to god hallelujah that was his conviction and because he stood on his conviction they overturned his case we read there in the book of daniel daniel had to stand on his conviction hear these leaders these guys have high ranking positions and but they just had a problem with daniel remember sometimes as a witness we have to suffer things daniel was there and uh amongst all these leaders and you know daniel was already very well liked in the kingdom but daniel had a conviction that he was going to pray three times a day and according to the scripture he always turned towards jerusalem to pray hallelujah because he knew that there was a promise that god gave solomon that if the people were in any kind of condition they just turned towards jerusalem that god would hear the prayer so daniel prayed three times a day underneath that promise well these guys didn't like them they come up with a scheme and i'm gonna tell you young people that's working you go through things in your job where people will begin to scheme against you i am a witness i lost two jobs because people were scheming against me one of my jobs i had 14 years i had rave reviews and everything and and all of a sudden i got a boss that just came up out of nowhere and said we just want to get rid of you took me through everything that that you can imagine hallelujah i had no idea the reason that i was being tried like that on the job is so god could move me to where he really wanted me to be and i want to give you good news tonight if you're having a trial like that on your job don't quit just just get ready god's going to move you to where he wants you to be while daniel's there in the kingdom and this these guys came up with this law that you know if anybody pray to any other god outside of king darius you know they're gonna have to be cast into the lion's den they said you know what we got a plan we're going to get rid of this guy daniel we're tired of him always kind of showing us up here daniel sees the decree has been signed by the king and he knew that the king probably didn't think this through but he signed it anyway because oh look at the glory that i'll get for the next 30 days but didn't realize that he had a really good friend that was going to pray regardless of what the king signed hallelujah glory glory and here here here uh darius has it signed and he's just get you know he's just really thinking about all this adoration all the praise everything he's going to get and then these these leaders they walk around at the sign and daniel sees it sign but daniel does not stop praying daniel goes and not only not only does he not stop praying he opens the windows like he always did i want you to be able to see me here on my knees i i'm not changing because the law has been signed as christians we can't change because certain laws change we have a certain conviction to the word of god and we're going to stay with what the word says we may suffer a little bit for it daniel they're praying and first time of the day second time of the third time that he's still praying and finally these guys say you know wait a minute let's go and tell the king king king king didn't you uh sign a decree saying that if anybody got caught praying you know that uh if they didn't pray to you or pray to this you know it's gonna it's gonna be trouble they gotta go into the lines they say then you sign they say yes sir assange whatever king actually signed it was good as gold couldn't be altered couldn't be changed king said yes i signed he says well you know we you know that daniel i love the way the scripture just kind of puts puts it in those terms that daniel which which daniel not you know the daniel we're talking about that daniel he's still praying three times a day to his god now didn't you say have to go into the lion's den that's exactly what i said and it was at that moment let's pick it up in scripture so at that moment the king began to realize what had happened to him so let's speak it up here in daniel chapter 6 oh hallelujah verse 12 then they came near and spake before the king concerning the king's decree has to not sign the decree that every man that shall ask a petition of any god or man within 30 days save of thee o king shall be cast into the dead of lions the king answered and said the thing is true according to the law of the means and persians which altereth not then answered they and said before the king that daniel which is of the children of the captivity of judah regard of not the o king nor the decree that thou has signed but maketh his petition three times a day then the king when he heard these words was so displeased with himself and set his heart on daniel to deliver him and he labored to the going down of the sun to deliver him this king is trying to figure out how can i get daniel out of this hallelujah glory to god sometimes god will you know give you people that he'll just give favor give you favor in their life they're not even christians but he'll give you favor with those people oh hallelujah glory to god some people appreciate your stand listen he says uh it goes on um verse 15 then these men assembled unto the king and said unto the king know o king that the law of the means and purges is that no decree nor statue which the king established may be changed they're reminding him of what he said what he wrote glory to god verse 16 then the king commanded and they brought daniel and cast him into the den of lions now the king spake and said unto daniel thy god i love this thy god whom thou serve is continually he will deliver thee think about this this man that signed the decree is also encouraging him and let them know i know what your god can do hallelujah i don't even serve your god but i nobody can do and i got confidence that he will deliver you daniel because you're able to stand on your own convictions look at this and a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the dead and the king sealed it with his own signet and with the signature of his lords and the purpose that the purpose might not be changed concerning daniel then the king went to his palace and passed the night fasting neither were instruments of music brought before him and his sleep went from him you talking about a man that's up all night praying the king was in that position after he signed his decree but he says i know your god gonna deliver you he couldn't wait for the sun to rise the next morning look at him watch him in scripture now he says then the king rose very early in the morning and went in haste unto the dead of lions and when it came to the dam he cried with a lamentable voice unto daniel and the king's faking said to daniel oh daniel servant of the living god is thy god whom thou serve is continually able to deliver thee from the lions you got to see this guy on the outside of this lion's den crying in a lamentable voice hallelujah look at it then said daniel to the king o king live forever my god you told me that my god was going to deliver i want to tell you how he did it my god have sent his angel and have shut the lion's mouth that they have not hurt me for as much as before him in an innocency was found in me and also before the old king have i done no hurt god made a way for daniel then was the king exceeding glad for him and commanded that they should take daniel up out of the den so daniel was taken up out of there and no man and no man of hurt was found upon him because he believed in his god because of his conviction he was preserved god knows how to turn on his enemies because the lions were still hungry hallelujah and those guys that came up with this scheme would never live again to set up another scheme because when they got when daniel got released they received a prison sentence and they went into the den of alliance and lost their lives god knows how to turn things around all you have to do is stand upon your convictions hallelujah let me just uh read you a couple other things here and oh my the message the uncertain sound it says daniel went in without any uncertainty god is able to deliver me from them lot from the lions but they threw him and but they threw him in the fire furnace and i believe when them lions started up there they look at him there's still a halo of fire around daniel any animal is scared of fire you know that those lions backed off what was it the hidden power that was in daniel's heart came come out and clothe him all over you actually have a hidden power in your heart it's the holy spirit and when you're going through trial when you're suffering a little bit it'll come out and be your protection he says it was it was that hidden power that blessing of god that was upon the prophet's life that and surrounded him with the flaming fire like down at dothan that day when gehazi looked and saw what was around elijah angels of fire chairs and fire there that hidden power was around daniel there's a story one time of some martyrs there's 40 of them and they told him so if you're going to denounce christ if you won't denounce christ we're going to have to throw you in this freezing water and they would die by being frozen to death and they just one 40 of them stood there and soldiers carried them out to be martyred and and um the first one said are you going to denounce christ no threw him in the water he died instantly second one comes up you're gonna denounce christ no threw him in the water he died instantly third one comes up fourth one comes up everyone no no no they died instantly when they get to the 40th one so you're going to announce christ yes he watched everybody else die say i don't want to die like that i denounce christ right now he says okay you're free you can go on back to do whatever you were doing well there was a soldier that saw him he says start taking off his gear and his sword and shield and laying it down and taking off everything and it says it was 40 that came and i'm gonna be the 40th i'm going to accept christ and i'm willing to die with these others right now so you got to have a conviction no matter what's going on around you you got to keep that conviction no matter where you find yourself keep that conviction while i was in israel they took us to um like a museum and uh at this museum where a lot of military airplanes and things like that so they had military people there stationed at this museum just kind of watching over everything and the first time i went to israel they gave us a tour guide and and and in israel what happens is when you turn i believe that age 18 no matter whether you're male or female you're forced to go into the military you have to you have to serve the military every every israelite has to serve in the military at the age of 18 boy or girl didn't matter so they gave us this tour guide and we're seeing all these soldiers walking around and they got guns and everything and you know we just we're just uh you know getting ready to go on tour and they gave us this tour guide and our tour guide her name was abigail when abigail comes up i see abigail dressed in a skirt and uh you know i'm looking at all the other soldiers i'm looking at abigail she's dressed in the skirts and this is really strange she's a she's a soldier in a skirt i think we have some other soldiers here tonight that are in skirts but abigail was a soldier i mean serving in the military with a skirt now you know that that that that really spoke volumes i i it was really hard to focus on the tour i needed to talk to abigail and i think everybody that was on the tour just everybody noticed this this soldier coming out here with a skirt so uh abigail you know uh she took us on the tour and she did you know did everything and and it just so happened that after the tour was over we went to like this little mall district and we went shopping and and uh and abigail happened to be walking through the district with her skirt we knew who it was hey you just took us on the tour could you please tell us why are you in the military with a skirt she says well my parents are christians uh and in our in our in our house this is what we believe that women are supposed to suppose excursions said but you're in the military says well this is what we told them this was our conviction we don't mind serving in the military to do our duty to the nation but if we're going to do it we have to stand on our convictions you got to allow us to wear our skirts they agreed to do it so i went back a second time and i told my wife and some of the others that whitman said there's this girl abigail uh that was at this place and you know i don't know if she's gonna be here today but you know i remember her last time she the one that did this gave this a tour and she was there in a skirt well when we get there this time it wasn't just abigail in the skirt there were other young ladies in the military and skirts one person could change a whole number of them god only needs one witness that young lady was standing on her conviction even in the military [Music] god needs young people like that abigail doesn't even know anything about this message that we know about but she had enough in her to say i want to follow my convictions even in my job i want to follow my convictions god needs young people to be the same way i don't care what career god blesses you with remember it's the blessing of god but hold to your convictions not what mama said well my mom won't let me do this my dad won't no no no your own personal convictions because you see it in the word of god let me read a couple more things and i'm going to wind this up and god's provided place of worship brother branham said we find that in each age when god said a certain thing would happen here come that man along and manifested that here come their people alone and live that that was god himself living in the people because it was an answering to his word see we live the way that we live because we're answering back to god's word amen now god's only provided way and only provided plan today is his son through his word for this age quickened by the spirit of his life quicken now there's a statement made by charles finney and charles fenney says revival this is his statement about revival says revival is a renewed conviction amen that's what we need just a renewed conviction you see there were things that we the holy spirit used to deal with us about years ago now we just let it just kind of it's okay but no god wants a renewed conviction it says revival is a renewed conviction of sin and repentance followed by an intense desire to live in obedience to god so so what after god washes you and cleans you up and does all these things what follows that is a intense desire to live in obedience to god it's giving up one's will to god in deep humility brother branham says this in the message the presence of god unrecognized says i watched i watched one time at the seashore where wind was blowing and it was just shaking why it wasn't a seashore it was up at lake michigan i was standing out there watching the waves as they would come in and oh that sea was a jumping and all the waters are jumping and the boats are rocking and i thought what is that going on i thought why the lake is having a revival that that's it is jumping and shaking why there's a rushing mighty wind coming down on it i thought well you know what there isn't one more drop of water in it right now than what it was when it was perfectly still he says no more water in it it's just all stirred up well now what's stirred up about it says you know what a stirring up of the water does washes all the trash out of it up on the bank and that's where we want the trash up on the bank not in our hearts not in our lives let's let the trash go up on the bank he says that's what we need a washing of unbelief out on the bank let the word of god have preeminence that's what we need a revival a wash all the unbelief out in all the bugs and superstitions and things come out and see that god is still god that's what we have revivals for i believe god wants to send somebody their own personal revival i believe god wants to remind us that he wants us to live such pure and unadulterated and clean lines before him and this is not a life because mom and daddy want us to do it but it's a life because god himself has dealt with our hearts and we have our own personal conviction i don't know what you're facing or what you're going through but i know god still wants to be god and he wants to be in control of your life and god wants the heart that is surrendered to him i pray that god will provide that revival the renewed conviction in every heart tonight as the musicians come let's pray i didn't ask the pastor this but i just feel led of the spirit to do it if there's any tonight that want to come and just be prayed for god has dealt with your heart maybe conviction has struck you tonight and said i got something i need to be prayed for about i want to invite you to come as we're saying this prayer and if you came bound you can leave free whatever your need is god is here to meet it tonight father i commit this congregation into your hands you knew the word that would be spoken you know why it needed to be spoken you know who needed to hear it i know that you won't allow your word to fall on the ground and return void but the word of god will accomplish the very purpose and intent that it was sent forth to accomplish lord there's some that needs to go free tonight from something god i pray that the holy spirit would bring the conviction the holy spirit would do the job that only the holy spirit can do father that the people can leave here free from whatever it is that the enemy has tried to trap them in satan you're you're exposed tonight you are a liar these are god's children and you can't hold them in captivity any longer it's the word of god that sets them free father let somebody surrender tonight not hear the voice of brother jack but may they hear the voice of god i commit them down to your hands father it's in jesus christ's name i pray amen
