[6:20] a found a bur Foundation God my God you
[6:28] are
[6:30] my God you
[6:32] are a firm
[6:36] foundation my God you
[6:45] are Hallelujah 1 Corinthians 13 and
[6:48] verse 8 charity Divine love never
[6:52] faileth but whether there be prophecies
[6:55] they shall fail whether there be tongues
[6:58] they shall cease whe whether they be
[7:00] knowledge it shall vanish away so Paul
[7:03] here and this is where my subject is
[7:05] from in 1 Corinthians 8 and the first
[7:07] three words there charity never faileth
[7:10] prophecies they'll fail tongues they
[7:12] shall cease whether there be knowledge
[7:14] it shall vanish Away Paul here is
[7:16] actually bringing an eternal uh the
[7:18] Eternal part of what divine love is that
[7:21] if it never fails then it's Eternal it's
[7:24] always been there it'll always be there
[7:27] there are some temporal things in the ch
[7:29] Church like prophecies and like tongues
[7:32] that in the meaning of this means that
[7:34] they will fade away
[7:36] someday they will fade away prophecies
[7:39] will cease prophecies will fail
[7:41] knowledge shall vanish away so there are
[7:43] things even in the church that will
[7:45] vanish and fade away someday there are
[7:48] things that we won't need
[7:50] someday so there are things that will
[7:52] fade away but then there are things that
[7:55] are Eternal and things that will never
[7:57] fail and will never fade away and divine
[8:00] love is one of those things it will
[8:02] never ever fade away it'll never fail
[8:05] you it'll never fail because we know God
[8:08] can't
[8:09] fail God can't fail and so Paul's
[8:12] bringing in this eternal part that it
[8:14] can't fail other things will fail
[8:16] they'll vanish away but charity never
[8:19] faileth verse 9 for we know in part and
[8:22] we prophesy in part but when that which
[8:25] is perfect is come then that which is in
[8:28] part shall be done away so it shows what
[8:32] we're seeking for what we're looking
[8:33] after is not just to emphasize something
[8:36] that's temporal but to have our eyes not
[8:39] just toward something that's surface or
[8:41] temporal but to have our eyes on the
[8:43] Unseen and that which is eternal if you
[8:46] would go with me to 2 Corinthians
[8:48] chapter 4 I want to add a scripture in
[8:51] in relation to the Eternal and how we're
[8:53] to live looking at the Eternal and it
[8:57] says here Second Corinthians 4: 16 yes
[9:01] for which cause we faint not but though
[9:06] our outward man perish yet the inward
[9:09] man is renewed day by day so this a
[9:12] cycle that's happening that our outward
[9:14] man is perishing but our inward man is
[9:17] being renewed day by day for our light
[9:21] Affliction which is but for a moment I I
[9:24] think it's interesting how Paul takes
[9:25] our life and the trials of it and all
[9:27] the suffering and caus it a light
[9:31] Affliction wow I want to look at my life
[9:34] like that our light Affliction in other
[9:37] words our life with all of its pain with
[9:39] all of its suffering with all the hurts
[9:41] and all the things people did wrong to
[9:42] us he's calling it when when you're
[9:45] looking at in light of Eternity it's
[9:47] just a light
[9:49] Affliction but isn't it amazing how big
[9:52] we make our
[9:54] afflictions and we make it bigger than
[9:56] God sometimes Paul says but our light
[9:59] Affliction is but for a moment it's
[10:02] working for us a far more exceeding and
[10:06] eternal weight of
[10:08] Glory while we look not at the things
[10:11] which are seen But at the things which
[10:14] are not seen for the things which are
[10:17] seen they're temporal but the things
[10:20] which are not seen are Eternal and out
[10:23] of all the dimensions the many
[10:25] dimensions and vastness that we have
[10:27] covered about Divine love this one here
[10:31] today is not to be overlooked I want to
[10:33] take a look at it and I want to title
[10:35] this Divine Love Never Fails this part
[10:38] of divine love should not be overlooked
[10:41] uh we have appreciated all the different
[10:43] dimensions of looking at Divine love and
[10:45] its characteristics but this one is not
[10:47] to be overlooked and I felt to finish 1
[10:50] Corinthians 13 and finish the scriptures
[10:54] and what and and ask what is the rest of
[10:56] 1 Corinthians 13 saying what does the
[10:58] rest of it say and this window that
[11:01] we've been calling it a window into the
[11:04] more excellent way he says there's a
[11:06] more excellent way then he gives the
[11:08] characteristics of that way it's divine
[11:10] love it's God's love it's it's it's
[11:12] agape love and then he explores in this
[11:15] little window in between this
[11:17] Corinthians which is a book of
[11:19] Correction the Corinthians is you could
[11:21] call it a book of Correction because
[11:22] Paul basically is setting things in
[11:25] order in the church that got out of
[11:26] order and so in the midst of all this
[11:28] correction and correcting the gifts and
[11:30] all these other things and setting he
[11:32] has this excellent way just sandwiched
[11:34] right in the middle and it's a window to
[11:36] the more excellent way to show us what
[11:38] it is this chapter stands separate to
[11:42] itself and it is looking at when a
[11:44] Christian breaks beyond the surface of
[11:47] feeling or temporal manifestations even
[11:50] of the spirit or temporal surges of
[11:53] Faith or temporal surges of Hope to
[11:56] bring the Christian beyond the surface
[11:58] surf to a depth to a depth of stability
[12:03] and
[12:04] power how many this morning that want to
[12:07] rais my hand I said I want to grow to
[12:09] more stability and Power in my life and
[12:12] not stay a surface
[12:14] Christian this is what Paul's trying to
[12:16] do there's a more excellent way there's
[12:18] manifestations of the spirit there's
[12:20] prophecies there's giving to the poor
[12:22] there's uh there's an understanding all
[12:24] the Mysteries he takes all of that but
[12:26] he says that's all these things are all
[12:28] temporal if you get knowledge of
[12:30] something it's all temporal but there's
[12:31] something Eternal in here and there's
[12:33] something beyond the surface of living
[12:36] every day by surfaced feeling let me
[12:38] just say that right away Christians
[12:40] cannot live by sight they must live by
[12:42] faith and Christians cannot live off of
[12:46] their
[12:48] feelings Christians cannot live by their
[12:51] feelings you cannot judge your day and
[12:55] judge your Christian walk and judge your
[12:56] fellowship with God based upon how you
[12:58] feel
[12:59] because from one day to the next you
[13:01] will feel very different one day you'll
[13:03] feel good one day you'll feel saved the
[13:06] next day you won't feel
[13:09] saved and those days when you don't feel
[13:12] saved Satan likes those days and he
[13:15] capitalizes it and he's in your ear on
[13:17] your shoulder saying that's right not
[13:19] only do you not feel saved I wonder if
[13:22] you're even saved at
[13:24] all boy he's a quite an enemy isn't he
[13:28] so hey we can't live off of our feelings
[13:32] we can't live with our feelings as the
[13:35] dominant king that's setting in our
[13:36] heart that's dictating our life every
[13:39] day that this is how I feel this is how
[13:41] and a lot of times people will conclude
[13:43] on matters conclude a lifelong confusion
[13:47] conclusion based upon their feelings of
[13:50] what
[13:51] happened based upon lack of facts and
[13:55] based upon well I feel this way so it
[13:57] must be true we can't do do that we
[13:59] can't live on feelings we have to live
[14:01] deeper than that and this is a realm
[14:03] into which we are coming to live in a
[14:06] way that perfect Faith which worketh by
[14:09] perfect love Masters every circumstance
[14:12] it's a Deeper Life of stability and
[14:15] Power in the Christian's Life by the
[14:17] Holy Ghost it's a realm of mastering
[14:20] every circumstance that comes our way so
[14:23] this characteristics of Love Never Love
[14:26] Never failing this characteristic should
[14:28] not be over look that love never fails
[14:31] Paul is saying we enjoy faith we enjoy
[14:34] prophecies and I want to just get this
[14:36] across it doesn't mean that we eliminate
[14:38] what he's saying here that it'll it'll
[14:40] fail prophecies will fail these things
[14:42] will cease knowledge will fade away it
[14:44] doesn't mean we those things stop
[14:46] happening as a manifestation of the
[14:48] spirit but what it means is they will
[14:50] fade away they are temporal I didn't
[14:53] intend to say this but I I I years ago
[14:55] the Lord showed me that there are things
[14:58] are you listening
[14:59] there are things that God gave us in the
[15:01] Bible as as as rules and guidelines and
[15:06] protections and boundaries that we will
[15:09] not need when we get on the other
[15:14] side can you say amen and when you start
[15:17] breaking down teaching what we teach
[15:20] about young people and the boundaries
[15:22] and not touching one another before
[15:23] marriage and all these other things
[15:26] these is this is all in the scripture
[15:27] and it's what God gave us to live in
[15:29] this life of sexual temptation of our
[15:32] flesh taking over it it he gives us the
[15:35] Holy Ghost but he gives us guidelines
[15:37] from the Old Testament to the new and we
[15:39] can't dump those things out we need them
[15:41] for this life you can't mock or ignore
[15:45] the preachers that are preaching God's
[15:47] guidelines for sexual Temptation there's
[15:50] some things in here he gave us for this
[15:51] life and we honor that but we won't need
[15:54] it for the other life we won't need the
[15:56] scriptures for sexual Temptation in the
[15:58] other cuz there won't be any demons
[16:00] there there won't be any lust there can
[16:01] you say Amen there won't be any of that
[16:03] there it'll be gone there won't be de no
[16:05] devil there there won't be any accuser
[16:07] of the Brethren there won't be no
[16:09] sickness can you say Amen we won't need
[16:11] the scriptures to apply Faith to Divine
[16:13] Healing to believe God can heal the sick
[16:15] we won't need those scriptures anymore
[16:17] because we'll never get
[16:20] sick but do we need them now yes so Paul
[16:24] says we enjoy faith we enjoy prophecies
[16:26] we enjoy knowledge especially when it's
[16:28] from the Lord but it will only have a
[16:31] season to it it will fade it will have a
[16:33] temporal help for you you know how many
[16:35] know that you can be prayed for and
[16:36] completely healed by the atonement but
[16:39] you're going to get sick again
[16:41] sometimes so your healing sometimes is
[16:44] temporal now sometimes somebody's healed
[16:46] that's it they're prayed for they don't
[16:47] have that problem again they don't have
[16:49] that eye problem again it's over can you
[16:51] say Amen but but if we live in these
[16:54] bodies we're going to get sick with
[16:55] something else again so our healing can
[16:57] be tempered Al and and so because of
[17:02] that we it's a season it will fade it
[17:04] has a temple help for us but you see we
[17:06] can't put all of our eggs in one basket
[17:08] we can't live solely upon knowledge why
[17:11] it'll fade someday we can't rest our
[17:13] Eternal destination on temporal things
[17:16] they will fade they will have certain
[17:18] limitations to it and to the Corinthians
[17:21] you can't Paul says you can't put an
[17:23] emphasis on these things too much
[17:25] because they are temporal in other words
[17:27] you can't have all your eggs in one
[17:29] basket you can't take a prophecy or you
[17:32] can't take knowledge and put all your
[17:34] eggs in one basket and say that's it
[17:36] that is my that I I rest my eternal
[17:38] destination upon the knowledge that I
[17:41] have you can't do that because it's
[17:43] temporal it will fade
[17:45] away amen but perfect love never
[17:50] Fades never fails it's constant it never
[17:54] walks away God's perfect love for you
[17:57] will never never ever walk
[18:01] away when you fail when you fail his
[18:05] love will not
[18:08] fail how many raise your hand said I
[18:10] failed before but his love don't fail
[18:12] you it's going to keep trying it's going
[18:15] to keep loving you it's going to keep
[18:17] drawing you and there'll always be
[18:18] something if you're a daughter of God or
[18:20] Son of God there's always something down
[18:21] there you got all this stuff on the
[18:23] outside all the guilt and the shame that
[18:25] goes with it all the things you've done
[18:26] wrong that's all the stuff but down here
[18:28] if something's churning that's because
[18:30] God's still dealing with you and that
[18:32] means his love never fails I don't care
[18:34] what you've done his love never fails it
[18:37] never gives
[18:42] up it's constant it never walks away why
[18:45] it was it because his love is not
[18:48] wavering by emotions by Feelings by Life
[18:52] Changes by people his love doesn't
[18:55] change with people because people change
[18:59] his love doesn't is not wavered and
[19:01] moved and changed by emotions or
[19:04] feelings or the stock market or losing a
[19:07] job or gaining a job or his love does
[19:10] not fail during those times his love is
[19:12] constant it's always there but perfect
[19:15] love never faades it never fails it's
[19:18] constant it's not moved by feelings or
[19:20] the stock market or insurance
[19:23] policies or
[19:25] sickness life is that seasons change
[19:29] good and bad things
[19:32] end lives fade away even good lives
[19:35] loved ones will
[19:38] die even good things in life will pass
[19:41] away but his love is still
[19:45] here aren't you
[19:47] glad God takes people from us but he
[19:50] doesn't take himself from us his love is
[19:52] still here it'll never fail
[19:56] you people leave us us people hurt us
[20:00] but his love stays with us Paul's
[20:03] teaching the Corinthians who need they
[20:04] need correction they were sensationally
[20:06] driven they were feeling driven putting
[20:09] all things on sensation or prophecies or
[20:11] emotion you know the Corinthians had
[20:13] great Services they had great Services
[20:17] Spirit-filled pouring out of the spirit
[20:20] tongues interpretation of tongues praise
[20:23] be to God from Pentecost those things
[20:25] would happen and even happen happen have
[20:27] them happen today but you see now it the
[20:30] Corinthians put their emphasis all on
[20:32] that and Paul could recognize it they
[20:34] didn't see it but Paul could see you're
[20:36] putting way too much emphasis on this
[20:38] and if you put it on it feels good it
[20:40] visibly feels like more signs are here
[20:43] and more things are happening it feels
[20:45] better it's a confirmation that God is
[20:47] with us the problem with that is when
[20:50] that is over when that feeling is gone
[20:54] how many can raise your hand and say I
[20:56] have felt the presence of the Lord
[20:58] anybody says no you can't feel it oh
[21:00] yeah you can you might be feeling it
[21:02] today that that you feel don't be afraid
[21:05] of that don't be afraid of
[21:07] thatall it's him coming near us you
[21:09] never you can be afraid of a lot of
[21:11] things but you need to don't need to be
[21:13] afraid of what you feel in your heart in
[21:15] the presence of the Lord the problem is
[21:17] when it's all over sometimes uh people
[21:19] start to wonder well we didn't have a
[21:21] service like that so is God With Us Now
[21:23] what a terrible thing to
[21:27] say
[21:28] all things from God are good but some
[21:32] things are
[21:33] temporary can you say amen and that
[21:37] feeling that I felt and I feel it this
[21:39] morning I love it but I can tell you
[21:41] that feeling isn't always
[21:44] there but there is something that's
[21:47] always there that I can't get away
[21:51] from it's the unfailing love of God that
[21:54] has never failed me never left me amen
[21:58] say I didn't feel the presence of God
[21:59] with you may not feel the presence of
[22:00] God but you have no scripture to say he
[22:03] left you his love can't leave you it
[22:05] can't fail you it can't stop it can't
[22:08] end now friends shouldn't we be
[22:11] interested in something in a world
[22:13] that's failed Us in people who have
[22:15] failed us even preachers have failed us
[22:18] isn't it isn't it not time for us to
[22:20] latch on to with all of our hearts
[22:22] something that never will fail us never
[22:25] will his love will never fail it'll
[22:28] still be there no matter what we go
[22:31] through no matter what people have done
[22:33] no matter what our trials his love is
[22:37] constant it's still there it's still
[22:40] drawing your
[22:41] heart never gives up never fails never
[22:44] will fade away always will be there I've
[22:47] got some wonderful memories of feeling
[22:50] the presence of God in my
[22:52] life being on spiritual highs like never
[22:58] dreamed of I've got some wonderful
[23:00] memories of camp meetings sometimes in
[23:02] our own Services I'll tell you uh
[23:05] there's been times even our own Services
[23:07] I felt like shouting running the aisles
[23:09] and sometimes I ran the aisles but you
[23:11] see now I don't judge how close I am to
[23:14] the Lord by how fast I ran the
[23:18] aisles okay because I may have felt good
[23:22] I felt blessings I felt Liberty but when
[23:24] I get in my car for some reason when I
[23:27] get in my car are the devil's in my car
[23:30] he's there he's on my shoulder he's
[23:33] whispering in my ear he's distracting me
[23:36] to all the you know I'm going to call it
[23:38] the devil you come out of be a service
[23:40] you be thinking of things of God and
[23:42] rejoicing and all of a sudden he's got
[23:43] you thinking about your business what
[23:45] you got to do Monday what you got to do
[23:47] Tuesday you better do this and all of a
[23:49] sudden pressure starts to come in a
[23:51] matter of 10 minutes the all the glory
[23:54] that you felt is went out the window of
[23:56] the
[23:56] car
[23:58] was it really that
[24:01] [Music]
[24:03] important but it's temporary I've
[24:05] learned it in these great mountains what
[24:07] I've learned in my Christians experience
[24:09] if it's a blessing to you today to know
[24:11] this is those I've learned this journey
[24:14] isn't always a
[24:16] mountain this journey has valleys God
[24:19] loves to hear Hallelujah from the valley
[24:24] when I was a young Christian I was not
[24:25] saying hallelujah from the valley
[24:29] I don't know what I was saying but it
[24:30] wasn't that but that's what God wants to
[24:34] hear it's easy to shout hallelujah from
[24:36] the mountains it's easy to shout when
[24:38] you're at church it's easy to shout
[24:40] hallelujah at camp
[24:42] meeting but it's in the valley he wants
[24:45] to hear the Praises of
[24:46] God glory be to God praise our God in
[24:51] the middle of a
[24:53] valley I learned that there's not just
[24:55] mountains in this journey there's Valley
[24:58] but one of the greatest things I've
[25:00] learned is there's a constant in my life
[25:03] there's a constant I might have
[25:05] mountains I might have
[25:06] valleys but there's something always
[25:10] constant there's something always
[25:13] consistent the God on the mountain is
[25:15] still God in the
[25:16] valley and when I crash I just fall back
[25:20] on him amen one Minister said here when
[25:24] you fall if you're going to fall you may
[25:26] fall but when you all fall back on
[25:29] him when I crash I fall back on him and
[25:32] his love has never failed it's never
[25:34] changed something really strong keeps
[25:37] holding me something keeps holding me
[25:40] something stronger than myself something
[25:42] stronger than my good feelings at
[25:44] meetings or the bad feelings during The
[25:46] Valleys something stronger than what
[25:48] people feel about me something stronger
[25:50] is in my life there's a constant in my
[25:52] life and it's the love of God Divine
[25:55] Love Never Fails we've seen people with
[25:57] their up ups and downs and watching
[25:58] other people ups and downs and ins and
[26:01] outs and sometimes I say Lord you know
[26:04] I've labored for their lives I prayed
[26:06] for their lives and just still that
[26:07] roller coaster up and down and up and
[26:10] down I say oh God if that's in my own
[26:12] life take it out but let let me cling to
[26:14] the constant that's in my life let me
[26:17] cling to the consistency that's in my
[26:19] life something stronger than myself when
[26:22] I come from my own
[26:24] inconsistencies and I have to apologize
[26:26] and God God forgive
[26:29] me you know that's the thing is
[26:32] that the devil takes
[26:35] failures we're not we got to look at
[26:37] this from an eternal perspective because
[26:39] from an eternal perspective your
[26:41] failures don't make you a
[26:46] failure well is
[26:48] it you didn't know
[26:51] that well wake up and smell the
[26:55] coffee because you f failed does it make
[26:59] you a
[27:00] failure not in God's kingdom not in an
[27:04] eternal perspective can you say amen
[27:06] amen and I'm sure a few of us this
[27:08] morning have failed just raise your hand
[27:10] just a few of us all
[27:12] right but because you failed doesn't
[27:14] make you a failure not in God's eyes
[27:17] amen but that's where the devil likes to
[27:20] take it he likes to take it and your
[27:22] inconsistencies and other people's
[27:24] inconsistencies dominate your Christian
[27:27] walk can dominate your life for Untold
[27:29] years we've got to stop that today we've
[27:33] got to stop that and we've got to look
[27:35] at something that's constant in our life
[27:38] we may be inconsistent other people may
[27:40] be inconsistent but there's something
[27:42] that's never inconsistant it's always
[27:45] there and always will be there fathers
[27:48] fail
[27:50] us mothers fail us siblings fail us
[27:54] cousins fail us uncles fail us churches
