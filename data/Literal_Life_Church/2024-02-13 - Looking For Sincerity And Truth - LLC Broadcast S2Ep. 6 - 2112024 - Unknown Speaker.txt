worthy you are Lord Lord we you up Lord we live you yes Lord we lift you up 1 Corinthians chapter 5 it is reported commonly that there is fornication among you and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles that one should have his father's wife and ye are puffed up and have not rather mourned that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you so I want you to notice here the rebuke is not only to the ones who are committing fornication but it's also to the church and not dealing with it corre correctly so the rebuke is for both it says in verse three then for I verely as absent in the body but present in the spirit have judged already as though I were present concerning him that hath so done this deed in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ when ye are gathered together in my spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ to deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus Jesus it would certainly take a lot of maturity in prayer to handle a situation this way your glorying is not good now he's speaking to the Corinthian Believers your glorying is not good know ye not that A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump Purge out therefore the old leaven that ye may be a new lump as ye are unleavened for even Christ Our Passover is sacrific for us so there he refers ref to Christ fulfilling the Feast of the Passover he is the Passover Lamb and so he refers to that Feast but look what he says here verse eight therefore let us keep the feast let us keep this Feast not with old leaven neither with the Leen of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth so we have here Paul addressing a situation in the Corinthians Church of incest and he calls it fornication but it was actually incest and that's the same thing it's a sexual immoral thing going on amongst the congregation and so he comes and he deals with it in his rebuke to the church he deals with a different way because he brings in this Passover uh Feast that took place and he refers to that and then he says that we should keep this Feast we should keep this Feast so that lets us know what uh what I was trying to bring to you a few weeks ago that the the seven feasts that if he says we should keep this Feast so if we think all of these feasts are dropped off after the Old Testament because they were in the Old Testament then we're missing something because they G we don't drop them off but we know that they have a spiritual fulfillment in our lives and Jesus said it this way I come not to destroy the law but I come to fulfill the law so whatever is out there in the Old Testament we can't as the modern church just dump all that off it has a meeting it has a purpose and it translates into our spiritual walk that we apply these things and the Seven feasts are no exception there's something spiritual that Christ fulfills all those things and he's fulfilling a lot of those things in us so when Paul says we should keep the feast maybe some of the new Christians were saying but I thought we were done with that I thought we moved on past Calvary now we don't celebrate not we don't physically C celebrate those days but but spiritually they're still in place and he says we should keep the Feast of Passover so spiritually something happens at us if you study the Feast of Passover started the night in in Goan where God the death angel was going to come and he said apply the blood to the kill the lamb and uh dress the lamb and it's a feast of unleavened bread so have have bread but no leaven in it CU leaven means sin so they're doing all this stuff in the household and then they apply the blood to the door and the L the death angel passed over their house because they had the blood and they had purged Leen from the bread and done all things all the things they need to do so when you say keep the feast well that has a meaning for us because we have not only a lamb that has been slain for us we not only have applied the blood to our lives but Paul says part of this Passover feast is to purge the leaven from the lump right yeah he's actually dealing with an issue that was in the church so he's telling them I'm rebuking you as a church that you cannot A little leaven will leaven the whole lump it's going to eventually affect somebody else so grow up and be a mature a mature Church grow up and and try your best to look to the word of God and not ignore what's going on but to address it to look at it because if you don't Purge it how many know the holy spirit is also a purging nature to it it wants to purge something that's not right and so if that continues in our Christian walk then we find under the Passover feast that we believe in our lives this Passover this lamb that we celebrate is one thing the next thing is we realize we must say Lord Purge the leavon out of this bread am I'm if I'm to celebrate this I can't just celebrate the sacrificial lamb at Calvary but I've got to purge the leaven out of the bread I've got to eat this bread with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth and that's the that's the two words I want to get to in just a minute but uh uh sufficient to say that these feast and Paul's saying let's keep this Feast there's a spiritual keeping of these things it's very interesting to say uh that we're under this Feast of unleavened bread it's interesting that he words it that's the bread of sincerity and Truth now these two words together sincerity and Truth together are only together in one other place in the Bible and that's the Book of Joshua sincerity and Truth are not mentioned anywhere else except here in Corinthians and back in Joshua and by the way at the end of the Joshua commission at the end of his life it's some of the last things that he says to the children of Israel after all their history coming out of Egypt all the Miracles all the signs all the Wonders and here he they come through all the history of it and then they come into the promised land they're taking their land they're taking the countries to do and all this after all the history of being in the message and all the things that they've been through let's go to Joshua if you would chapter 24 and let's read it because it's because it's the only other place in the Bible it has to have significance that these two words sincerity and Truth are mentioned together must be pretty important and the time frame must be pretty important as well Joshua chapter 24 if you read the whole chapter 24 you read Joshua telling the people their history God through speaking through Joshua and saying I took you out of Egypt he gives the whole history again pick it up in verse eight said and I brought you into the land of the amorites which dwelt on the other side of Jordan and they fought with you and I gave them into your hand that ye might possess their land I destroyed them before you then Balo the son of zapor the king of Moab arose and wared against Israel and sent and called The Prophet balum the son of bore to to curse you but I would not hearken unto balum therefore he blessed you still so I deliver you out of his hand the the the history is here is that every incident balum uh the false prophet come among among you daythan and Kora uh the Red Sea everything everything in their history that they came through God said I delivered you out of all those things you're still standing because I was there and delivered you out of all of it and then he says verse and he went and ye went over over Jordan and CA here comes the Joshua Commission Now ye went over Jordan and came unto Jericho and the men of Jericho fought against you the amorites the perizzites the Canaanites the Hittites and the girgashites and the hivites and the jebusites and I deliver them into your hand and I sent the Hornet before you which drave them out before you even the two kings of the amorites but not with thy sword nor with thy bow and I have given you a land for which you did not labor and cities which you built not and ye dwell in them of The Vineyards and the olive yards which ye planted not do ye eat he's saying I've brought you into your promise you're dwelling in it and we as the bride can say he's brought us into our Promised Land of the Holy Ghost when he to stood at the seals he said he said Joshua I've seen you two-thirds of the way to Jordan and when the seals were getting ready to be broke it's bringing the people into their inheritance can you say Amen the bride can say he has brought me this far and now we're living in these cities and we're living in this word and we're blessed but it seems like every time God blesses the people it always comes with a warning because we can take it for granted after all this he says I've done for you look look verse 14 now therefore now therefore now what do we do now what's the end of all this we're at the end Joshua's getting ready to go pass away it's the end of the Joshua commission it's the end time after all the history of Israel coming into their land now therefore what fear the lord serve him in sincerity and truth and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood and in Egypt and serve ye the Lord that's our instructions now that's what he says yes serve him with all your heart but serve him with sincerity and Truth do you know what that is well the opposite would be insincerity being deceiving being fake being pretend having pretense as I said Sunday your lips honor be but you're far your heart is far from me sincerity take the opposite then you'll understand what God's saying and truth instead of living on lies you live every day in the truth you're only interested in one thing that's truth your kids come and tell you something don't just jump on it wait until you find the truth and I'll tell you sometimes it takes years before truth is manifested a person can tell a lie and it sounds exactly right and be careful believe it into it because you don't know sometimes it takes a while to manifest but we should be lovers of Truth can you say Amen lovers of Truth lovers of sincerity lovers of being real lovers of being real Christians wanting to dwell amongst people that are being real cuz the whole world's lying and deceiving and all that that shouldn't be in the church we should serve him in truth and honesty and serve him with a with an honesty not a deception not trying to give the people and and and and and cry crocodile tears that's another meaning for insincerity crying crocodile tears we don't believe them because it's not real we should be the most real people on the face of the Earth and saying Lord let me serve you one way with sincerity and Truth it's the essential elements at the end Joshua says they say what do we do now we've got the land we're rejoicing serve him with all your heart with sincerity and Truth Joshua reminds them of their whole history and then he says serve him in sincerity and Truth the last thing this is what we need in the last days this is what we need to live this is what we need to display if we have Lies We Must dispel all the lies if we have insincerity and deception with one another we must Purge that from us and we must be a real people of honesty and so his last words to the people before he died is to serve the Lord with sincerity and truth I tell you friends I want to say to you tonight this is what I'm looking for this is what I title this service tonight this little bible study looking for sincerity and Truth what are you looking for brother Paul what are you looking for what's next I'm looking for sincerity and Truth in the people of God Amen I'm looking for more sincerity and Truth in the people of God this is what I look for in my own life and in the bride this is not just a sermon tonight but I'm Gro groaning to see this I'm groaning for true and real Christian fellowship with honesty with sincerity not grownup games not childish games because there is both there's childish games and then there's new grown-up games that people play and politics and deceiving and saying what you don't mean uh but I want honesty and sincerity and to be amongst the people of Truth people who tell the truth brothers who call themselves brothers that will act like true Christian Brothers they communicate like brothers not like the world not like the wisdom of the world but they actually communicate in honesty like brothers in Christ that's a real brother when he acts that way not with pretense not hiding not fakeness not lying not lips that speak and support and compliments but their heart is far from it Lord let me be first tonight let me have a fullness of sincerity and truthfulness before your presence that's right it also says to put away the gods and this is in tune with First Corinthians 5 that we read when it says Purge out the leaven Joshua said says you you you must put away other gods what is that saying purging Purge your lives if he's saying that I don't know if they still had uh hints towards God's there but we can't serve God any other way but in sincerity and truth and put away the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side that's way he says it so there's a purging a lot of times people thinks that stops at the end the purging of Our Lives stops at the end it's it's actually a part of the end it's a it's a part of our lives at the end it's in this uh perverted world there's still a purging that goes on in our lives I I thank God when he purges my life I thank God when he cleanses my life I thank God when he washes me of something that's hidden there in my life I thank God I don't I don't get offended when he's correcting me can you say Amen when he's trying to purge the church and Purge of something I don't get offended at that that's right because I want to be washed without any spot or wrinkle can you say amen hallelujah and so it's actually part of it as we purge the purging is a part of the work of the Holy Spirit at the end time the challenge then he says to them which I feel like through the ministry is the challenge that's been coming lately choose you this day whom you would serve I'm in verse 15 now if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord can you imagine that if it if it seems evil for you to serve the Lord in your heart if it seems evil to serve the Lord then choose choose don't be in between choose who you want to serve choose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the flood and the gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell and I love it how he makes it so clear he said as for me in my house we will serve the Lord Joshua said make your choice but I want you to let you know my choice as for me in my house as for me in this house we're going to serve the Lord he's challenging them even if to shake their hand and say hey God bless you whatever Direction that's What Abraham did to lot as his wife looked at the Fashions down in Sodom and they set their tent they didn't go to Sodom right away way they pitched their tent toward Sodom and Abraham just said God told me there needs to be a separation you choose a way and I'll choose the other way shook hands with his his nephew God bless you and I'll be praying for you amen you don't need to get in a fuss about it you don't need to influence one another choose who you want to serve choose you this day and he said to all of Israel Purge from the leaven Purge the Gods right now but you need to choose you this day who you will serve Hallelujah things the bread so and so when we talk about bread now uh when they broke bread together and often we talk about this at the Lord's Supper uh the term breaking of bread came from it it didn't mean that they just got together and they tore the bread and they ate it together it had a much deeper meaning when they broke bread together it meant that they come together together to be nourished by the bread of life that he has sent us they're eating the bread of life together they're breaking bread together like we're doing tonight breaking bread together eating together the bread of life and breaking bread also means a love Feast it's about the sweet brotherly Fellowship that goes on around eating of Christ the word in this hour and it can't stay sweet fellowship if there's leav in the lump amen it's why a purging has to go on a continued purging has to go on and so it's a it's the love Feast goes with it sweet Fellowship around eating Christ the word of the hour and our communion when we have it projects that breaking of the bread that it should happen all the time in our life always in remembrance of the Lamb this Passover that's what communion light is about is remembering what our lamb did for us remember that judgment passed over us because of the Lamb so now then in chapter five before uh Paul speaks of the Gathering and speaks of the feast that we're at now as he brings in verse 11 he talks about let us keep this Feast of the Passover let's keep this Feast but it it also shows how we eat this bread bre Christ is the unleavened bread which means there's no world mixed in it with it leaven is the world there's no world mixed in with it it's pure we must keep it that way the elements that are in it must also be in us and those elements he brought out our sincerity and truth it must be kept pure so that you can stay in a state of serving him of sincerity and of Truth amen whenever leban comes in the world comes in we tend to lose our sincerity it and we tend to buy into lies so to eat right we must keep the leaven out keep the insincerity out the lack of being real the lack of being honest losing depths of the meaning of the word of God we must keep living out truth instead of lies and so this this case what Paul addressed was an incest case going on in the Corinthian Church in other words it was a moral failure but it was deceit it was being sneak it was going around the Saints and hiding something and because he said at the beginning it is reported commonly among you the word started to get out of this incest going on and they're still coming to church they're still having the Lord's supper and so now but what was the incest it's moral failure but it was dishonesty it was insincerity it was being sneaky we don't know how these people were but if they were coming maybe they were worshiping just like everybody else and going on and Paul had to rebuke the church why are you letting this go on without something being said about it and I know God rebukes and corrects most of the things over the pulpit and not publicly calling names I understand that because God's a gentleman I want to remind everybody though a scripture and don't get scared I'm not going to do anything tonight but I want to remind you of a scripture that says those that sin rebuke before All That Others May fear every time I read stuff like that people forgot it's in there and people get nervous oh which direction is our pastor going what's next I will by the help of the holy spirit always be a gentleman I'm not wanting to embarrass anybody but I'm also not wanting let to let sin continue in the church that it begins to affect other people those that sin rebuke before All That Others May fear because it has to be a respect for the body of Christ there has to to be a respect and he's challenging them grow up and be real mature Believers and deal with this thing don't let them just keep coming and not address it and sit them down and and say you need to repent of this thing thank you for watching our
