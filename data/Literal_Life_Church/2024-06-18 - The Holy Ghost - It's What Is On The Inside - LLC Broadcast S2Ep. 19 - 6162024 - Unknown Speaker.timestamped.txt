[4:07] [Music]
[4:10] faithful
[4:12] unto
[4:15] me great is my
[4:26] faithfulness in John 7:38
[4:30] and this is an ongoing series here on
[4:32] the Holy Ghost he that believeth on me
[4:35] as the scripture hath said out of his
[4:38] belly shall flow rivers of Living
[4:41] Water but this spake he of the spirit
[4:45] which they that believe on him should
[4:47] receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet
[4:50] given because that Jesus was not yet
[4:53] glorified so if we go back and see he's
[4:56] speaking of the spirit affecting a human
[4:59] being so much that it actually flows
[5:02] from the inside out so we have to look
[5:05] at this this U picture of Jesus pointing
[5:09] to what the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost
[5:11] will do in us we have to look at this
[5:13] picture because we always look at it as
[5:15] this him filling us and we know that's
[5:17] true on the day of Pentecost they were
[5:19] all filled with the Holy Ghost but you
[5:21] see now you can't just look at it that
[5:23] way this is something working from the
[5:25] inside out this is something because if
[5:27] we always look at it as something always
[5:30] coming from the outside in and we know
[5:32] the Holy Ghost can do that then we're
[5:34] missing the the deepest mystery behind
[5:36] what the Holy Ghost does in you because
[5:39] in you it will be something that's
[5:41] happening inside not outside but inside
[5:45] and it'll actually flow out as we'll
[5:47] read it again out of his belly shall
[5:49] flow rivers of Living Water and and the
[5:53] the theologians they I looked it up and
[5:55] they they can't find this reference in
[5:57] the Old Testament that it says as the
[5:59] script rure saith they can't find it but
[6:01] there is some references there to the
[6:04] this thing of out of the belly flowing
[6:06] and the rivers of living water flowing
[6:08] there is references to the rivers of
[6:09] living water in the Old Testament but
[6:11] guess what those rivers are coming out
[6:13] of you yeah by the Holy Ghost so it is
[6:17] there and then he said this spake he of
[6:18] the spirit which they that believe on
[6:20] him should receive for the Holy Ghost
[6:22] was not yet given because that Jesus was
[6:25] not yet glorified so this is the coming
[6:28] of the Holy Ghost here that Jesus refers
[6:30] to and uh I I just wanted to mention
[6:33] there's something else that's said there
[6:34] before we move on at the end of it that
[6:37] he said this is the spirit that will
[6:38] come for the Holy Ghost was not yet
[6:40] given because Jesus was not yet
[6:43] glorified so this is a reference to the
[6:46] holy ghost coming after Calvary and
[6:49] that's an interesting thing because
[6:51] after Calvary the Holy Ghost would do
[6:54] something deeper than it ever did in the
[6:56] Old Testament and that is it would move
[6:59] to the level of the
[7:01] soul the Holy Ghost has always been
[7:03] there if you know the Holy Ghost of as
[7:05] the the one who came the person who came
[7:08] in the word of every generation in Moses
[7:10] day in Joshua's day that was the Holy
[7:13] Ghost himself moving in and anointing
[7:16] and uh and and anointing a man's Spirit
[7:19] the Bible says prophets were moved the
[7:22] oldtime prophets were moved by the Holy
[7:25] Ghost so it's not that the day of
[7:26] Pentecost was the first time the Holy
[7:28] Ghost came no it was always there but
[7:30] now Jesus makes a distinction is that it
[7:33] could not become rivers of something
[7:35] coming out of you until he went to
[7:38] Calvary and he was glorified and the
[7:40] reason the Holy Ghost couldn't come on
[7:42] your soul in the Old Testament is
[7:44] because it had serpent nature on it
[7:46] right God's not going to dwell the same
[7:47] place with his serpent nature so
[7:49] something had to take care of your
[7:50] serpent nature First Calvary took care
[7:53] of your serpent nature and the one you
[7:56] were born with so that you could be born
[7:59] again
[8:00] by the Holy Ghost and now the potential
[8:03] is there for his Spirit to rest in your
[8:05] soul that's pretty powerful friends and
[8:08] the Holy Ghost had never done something
[8:10] that deep on a human being that's why
[8:11] it's prophesied throughout the body body
[8:14] what without the with with all the
[8:16] testimonies of the Holy Ghost and
[8:17] everything that he did all the prophets
[8:20] nothing will ever Trump now what he's
[8:22] going to do with his spirit and that's
[8:24] put it in the heart of man that's pretty
[8:26] powerful that's the mystery of Christ
[8:28] actually that was hidden that's the Eve
[8:30] that was hidden in Adam praise the Lord
[8:32] so so now we uh had covered a part here
[8:36] last Sunday about God doing the drawing
[8:39] instead of and that's the part of the
[8:41] Holy Ghost we covered Sunday I think I I
[8:43] talked about the Simplicity of Christ
[8:45] then we talked about that no man can
[8:47] come except my father first draw him so
[8:50] God does everything in other words if
[8:52] you if you come to repentance it's the H
[8:54] it's him drawing you if if you want the
[8:57] Holy Ghost he's already drawing your
[8:58] heart if you desire to be healed or if
[9:01] you desire something from God guess what
[9:04] he already put that desire within you
[9:06] this coming of the spirit would be
[9:08] something that's deep on the inside
[9:11] after Calvary and it would be so deep
[9:13] that it would go to the soul level it
[9:15] would be not just something uh that
[9:18] would be on the outside manifestation
[9:20] and this is interesting because there's
[9:22] references All Through the Bible in uh
[9:24] uh in the Old Testament All Through the
[9:26] Bible in fact that the Holy Ghost uh
[9:28] coming in the Old Testament and it seems
[9:31] as if it says that it had not come yet
[9:33] when he speaks of the day of Pentecost
[9:35] but that's not what he was saying this
[9:37] coming of the Holy Ghost would be
[9:39] different with a deeper uh purpose on
[9:42] the day of Pentecost it would be
[9:44] fulfilling something and going way down
[9:47] deep to the soul level it's not on the
[9:49] outside it's on the inside coming out of
[9:52] you as Rivers flowing as as out of your
[9:56] belly shall rivers of flowing water and
[9:57] this spake he of the spirit that was to
[10:00] come this is what it would be it would
[10:02] some be something working from the
[10:04] inside out can you say amen and remember
[10:08] religion religion always religion is a
[10:12] Reformation from the outside in but
[10:16] God's gospel and his word always works
[10:19] from the inside out the gospel deals
[10:22] with the inside first the message is to
[10:26] bring the Holy Spirit back to deal with
[10:28] your inside first first and then let God
[10:31] put things together on the outside it's
[10:34] the opposite of psychology it's the
[10:37] opposite it's the opposite motive of all
[10:39] of that denomination all of that it's
[10:41] it's a pure gospel and it's meant to go
[10:43] to your soul
[10:45] first that's the new birth the new birth
[10:48] is not something from the outside in
[10:50] it's from the inside out is that okay
[10:52] with everybody so any religion without
[10:55] the power of God is to work to reform
[10:57] you on the outside to dress it up to
[10:59] make it look good like a pig you didn't
[11:01] change his nature you bring him on the
[11:03] front row you put a you dress him up
[11:05] nice with a bow tie and you look it make
[11:07] him look better than I even look tonight
[11:09] set him there give him a jerk every now
[11:11] and then to say Amen or oink or
[11:14] something like that he'll act a part out
[11:17] but as it's been said take the leash off
[11:19] and after a while he'll run to the
[11:21] quickest M mud hole that he can find get
[11:24] right down in that mud hole and oh this
[11:26] is me this is me I love this what
[11:29] happened to your
[11:31] pig you didn't change the nature this is
[11:34] not it's a personal thing it's a
[11:36] personal Revival it's a personal change
[11:39] but it comes by the word of God and one
[11:41] of the EV the evidence you have is that
[11:42] you'll never deny any of this word of
[11:45] God and that's what I said Sunday my
[11:48] evidence I know is that there's nothing
[11:49] in my soul level since I received the
[11:52] Holy Ghost that would buck up against
[11:54] any of this word I might not understand
[11:56] some of it until he re reveals it I
[11:58] might say oh that but if there's nothing
[12:01] left down here to resist and buck up
[12:03] against any word of
[12:06] God that's how I knew I had something
[12:08] changed in my life and I just been going
[12:10] on since 16 years old what am I now 25 I
[12:13] think I just been going on growing in
[12:16] the Lord you know all these 10 years why
[12:20] are you
[12:21] laughing I just been going on just and
[12:24] it's it's from Revelation to Revelation
[12:26] then I found that place in the word
[12:28] where Jesus was with he was with the men
[12:30] on the road to Emmas and this is after
[12:32] he had done all his miracles and
[12:34] everything but these men on the road to
[12:35] Emmas he just talked to them and they
[12:37] didn't know who he is who he was so he
[12:40] just he says and then when they finish
[12:42] he says did not our hearts burn with us
[12:44] while he opened to us the
[12:46] scriptures and then their eyes were open
[12:49] inside the house they realized wait a
[12:51] minute this is Jesus the Same Jesus that
[12:54] did the Miracles is the Jesus that's
[12:56] being real to me by doing what opening
[12:59] the scriptures to me and I said to my
[13:01] heart I wasn't here when brother Brown
[13:03] was here so I didn't see I've seen a lot
[13:05] of Miracles and I still see them I've
[13:06] seen the blind eyes open so I thank God
[13:08] for that but I know that I wasn't in the
[13:10] day when I seen all the Miracles but the
[13:12] same Jesus that worked in brother rah's
[13:14] life it was it was sitting here with me
[13:16] and ministering to me opening up the
[13:18] Bible to me and that's just that's just
[13:21] as powerful or more powerful than all
[13:23] the Miracles he can
[13:25] do he knew the Jesus they knew the Jesus
[13:27] that was opening scripture matter of
[13:28] fact those days in between his uh in
[13:33] between his death and his Ascension
[13:35] that's what he was doing for the
[13:36] disciples he was opening the scriptures
[13:38] can you say Amen so now it's word upon
[13:41] word if I can have that quote again it's
[13:43] word by word that's where he failed in
[13:45] the Garden of Eden that's where he's
[13:47] always failed that's where them the tape
[13:49] on the false anointed ones and the
[13:51] anointed ones if you don't know what
[13:52] that is that's uh most of you should
[13:54] know but he preached the message brother
[13:56] Brandon fals anointed ones at the end
[13:58] time you should listen to that cuz
[13:59] that's where God spoke to us through his
[14:02] prophet and taught us that the just will
[14:03] fall on the the rain will fall on the
[14:05] just and the unjust and that that his
[14:07] anointing true anointing can fall on
[14:10] vessels that are even false and preach
[14:12] in false
[14:13] Doctrine now I like I said I don't
[14:16] understand how God set that up and why
[14:17] he did it that way but it is a truth
[14:20] that the and this revealed it the false
[14:21] anointed ones he preached revealed it
[14:23] they can be Anointed with the spirit
[14:25] speak in tongues dance shout preach the
[14:30] gospel and still a devil sir honestly I
[14:35] don't understand all that I just know
[14:37] I've seen it happen and I know it's the
[14:39] truth but then he says these few things
[14:41] and I preached on the last one Sunday no
[14:43] man I think these are three things to
[14:45] help clear up the confusion on the
[14:47] evidence of the Holy Ghost because
[14:49] that's what he's saying there's so much
[14:50] confusion about the evidence of the Holy
[14:52] Ghost this is where he clears it up and
[14:54] I spoke Sunday all the father hath given
[14:56] me uh will come to me that pretty much
[14:58] clear clears it up can you say Amen cuz
[15:01] you can't work your way into this it's
[15:02] all the father's already given they're
[15:04] going to come and no man can come except
[15:07] my father's drawing him
[15:09] first so that with that laid then I drop
[15:12] back to what he said here on tonight
[15:15] speaking a little bit about what he said
[15:17] first when he's countering the wrong
[15:20] interpretations and confusion about the
[15:22] evidence of the Holy
[15:24] Ghost then he he talks about the
[15:26] anointing falling of the Holy Ghost but
[15:28] then he says it's the
[15:31] inside and there he's he's in a subject
[15:34] of predestination and the seed and we
[15:37] understand that part and it's been and
[15:38] it's important to realize now you
[15:40] couldn't come unless your father draw
[15:41] your father drawed you but you'd have to
[15:43] be in his mind before the foundation of
[15:45] the world we see then that there's a
[15:47] confusion about it but you see that it's
[15:49] it's God they were predestination all
[15:53] the father hath given me will come he
[15:54] says that in John chapter 6 when he's
[15:57] addressing might as well mention this
[15:59] again when he's dealing with John
[16:01] chapter 6 he's dealing with 5,000
[16:03] followers of Jesus all enticed by the
[16:06] fishes and Lo's miracle and all the
[16:08] Miracles and setting up as as a king
[16:11] then he starts to say that I'm the bread
[16:12] of life you've got to eat of me he he he
[16:16] to break the word to the people then 70
[16:18] of his disciples leave many leave
[16:21] because of the word he's preaching and
[16:23] that's what's separating and in the
[16:24] midst of all that he's saying things
[16:25] like all the father ha given me will
[16:27] come no man man can come except my
[16:30] father's wrong he's he's laying in
[16:32] predestination to them to realize you
[16:34] can't come of your own ACC Accord you
[16:37] have to be predestinated to this and God
[16:39] has to call you to this he's laying it
[16:42] into them and then he one chapter he
[16:44] goes from 5,000 followers to 12 in one
[16:47] chapter and one's a
[16:49] devil I mean that was a pretty quick
[16:52] Ministry you know like 6,000 yeah 12 and
[16:56] one's a devil you got 11 left and then
[16:59] no wonder Jesus said you guys going away
[17:03] too and Peter says from the from his
[17:06] soul something resoning something's
[17:09] right he didn't even have the Holy Ghost
[17:10] yet but something's answering saying
[17:12] thou the Christ you have the words of
[17:15] the Living
[17:16] God hallelujah remember what he said now
[17:19] thou Hast the words of eternal life and
[17:22] and Jesus said then he said my words I
[17:25] speak unto you they are spirit and they
[17:28] are it's always tied with the word so
[17:32] but the last thing the first thing I
[17:34] want to elaborate is it's the inside so
[17:36] when we talk about this it's a focus on
[17:39] the inside if he's talking about the
[17:41] evidence and that's what he is in this
[17:42] quote there's two things never use an
[17:45] outside
[17:46] manifestation as a personal evidence
[17:48] that you have
[17:50] it that's what he's teaching here it's
[17:52] on the inside everything's happening on
[17:54] the inside that's what he's trying to
[17:55] get to is something happening a change a
[17:58] change of your desire ties a new birth
[18:00] all on the inside not the outside the
[18:02] inside and so it's on the inside it's
[18:04] amazing to to see this now because he h
[18:08] he has he has to say this this way in
[18:10] this quote why is brother brand saying
[18:13] it's on the inside or it's the inside
[18:15] because of the confusion what confusion
[18:18] that for some reason many of the Great
[18:21] and I say this respectfully many of the
[18:23] Great outside manifestations of God can
[18:27] be impersonated
[18:30] so that makes it hard and it can make it
[18:34] confusing cuz let me say tonight as a
[18:36] qualification just so I don't get
[18:38] labeled against the manifestations of
[18:40] God we can never we never want to
[18:42] downplay the fact that his holy ghost
[18:45] can do and can still do Mighty things
[18:48] among us he's still doing it he always
[18:51] will do it and if we start downplaying
[18:53] that and not praying in faith that he
[18:55] can do it then we're missing something
[18:57] see so I want don't want to be known as
[18:59] someone that's that's preaching against
[19:01] that cuz if I would preach against that
[19:03] and I'm not even a gospel preacher
[19:05] because we know Jesus Christ is the same
[19:08] yesterday today and forever we know he
[19:10] can manifest his power at any moment he
[19:12] can do anything how many believe that
[19:15] we're believing for some cancer cases
[19:17] here and some different things going on
[19:19] and in the last few months some sin in
[19:20] the church and things and you know what
[19:22] God God is dealing with those things God
[19:24] is dealing with hearts that's what the
[19:27] Holy Ghost is for but the manifestation
[19:29] of the gifts and the church and and
[19:31] healings and all these other things we
[19:33] never want to downplay the fact his holy
[19:36] ghost can do and is still doing Mighty
[19:38] things among us one of the reasons we
[19:40] should pray for that and this is the way
[19:42] I've said it I have said that I don't
[19:44] need to see another miracle for me to
[19:46] stay a Christian or stay believing if
[19:48] God never did another one hey I'm all
[19:51] here I'm in until the duration of this
[19:53] thing but our children and our
[19:56] unbelievers need to see the power of God
[19:59] they need to see the move of God they
[20:02] need to see the outside manifestation
[20:04] because they don't have anything on the
[20:05] inside yet so they need to see God doing
[20:07] something say God's among these people
[20:10] God's doing something here but we we
[20:13] want to just rightly divide this because
[20:16] if if the the church is in the spirit of
[20:18] God he will do these things but we must
[20:21] separate this move and this thing we
[20:25] must separate it correctly and never use
[20:28] an outside
[20:30] manifestation as a personal
[20:34] evidence that you have received the Holy
[20:37] Ghost because brother Braham says it's
[20:39] the
[20:39] inside it's not the outside it's not
[20:42] what he does on the outside that may
[20:44] lead you to believe the first second
[20:46] second poll is to cause you to believe
[20:48] in God that's right believe that he's
[20:51] real right but we can't stay at the
[20:53] first and second pole and so so now it's
[20:57] it's we should never cling to something
[21:00] that's one of those manifestations as
[21:02] evidence it's the inside that draws that
[21:06] we should draw on for our evidence the
[21:08] reason it's been confused also the
[21:10] second reason is if people use an
[21:13] outside evidence it can't be solid
[21:16] sometimes because we know God can
[21:17] manifest himself but then when we know
[21:20] Satan can copy that sometimes in the in
[21:23] the in the coming of the spirit of God
[21:24] there will be lot a lot of things on the
[21:27] outside that we can Rejoice over that we
[21:30] can testim have testimonies of that we
[21:32] can actually see with our eyes that he's
[21:35] doing but what he does in you is deeper
[21:38] than
[21:40] that both will be going on if it's a if
[21:45] it's a holy ghost filled church both
[21:46] would be going on at the same time yes
[21:50] the outward things that you can see but
[21:53] then I'm always saying God what's
[21:54] happening on the
[21:56] inside because there's a lot of groups
[21:59] it's a lot of outward but you're
[22:01] questioning but what where's the true
[22:03] repentance where's the heart where's
[22:05] where's that person's heart you see the
[22:08] Holy Ghost does not come and manifest
[22:10] and show Miracles just to show
[22:13] off it's to draw somebody into the holy
[22:16] ghost in a Deeper
[22:18] Life to cry out to God to say I need him
[22:21] personally I need God God's here but I
[22:24] need more than a miracle I need him to
[22:25] change
[22:26] me he's there for for a
[22:29] reason so uh I can safely say God is out
[22:35] to deal in the soul level more than he
[22:38] is just to manif manifest himself on the
[22:41] outside verse 24 of Ezekiel 36 for I
[22:43] will take you from among the Heathen and
[22:46] gather you out from all the countries
[22:48] now this is speaking of Israel but it's
[22:49] a type of the what the holy spirit will
[22:52] do to his people and you individually
[22:54] he'll do this to you individually for I
[22:56] will take you from among the Heathen
[22:58] gather you out of all the countries will
[22:59] bring you into your own land then will I
[23:02] sprinkle clean water upon you and ye
[23:05] shall be clean from all your filthiness
[23:07] and from all of your Idols will I
[23:09] cleanse you so there's a cleansing that
[23:11] goes on who's doing
[23:14] it who's doing it
[23:16] you we got to do all this stuff in
[23:19] preparation get ready for the Holy Ghost
[23:21] well I think you should offer up a
[23:22] surrendered heart I think you should
[23:24] follow the word and be
[23:26] obedient but you can't even to
[23:28] repentance unless he's drawing you and
[23:30] all these scriptures says I'm going to
[23:32] come and clean you with water from all
[23:34] your filthiness from all your Idols why
[23:35] clean a new heart also will I give you
[23:38] and a new spirit will I put within you
[23:41] praise the Lord I got the Holy Ghost no
[23:42] no no brother re says no that's not his
[23:44] new spirit yet that's he gives you a new
[23:46] spirit that's right because you can't
[23:48] even get along along with yourself with
[23:52] your spirit brother brah says you can't
[23:54] even get along with neighbors or
[23:56] yourself how are you going to get along
[23:58] with God to start receiving anything
[24:00] from him you're not even in in the place
[24:03] yet and God says they have and you know
[24:05] what else you have he says and I will
[24:07] take away your Stony heart you got a
[24:08] Stony heart towards God you were born
[24:10] with it Stony heart I got to replace
[24:14] your spirit he hasn't even filled you
[24:16] with the Holy Ghost yet he's got to do
[24:19] all this he says I'll take the Stony
[24:20] heart out of your flesh and I will give
[24:22] you a heart of Flesh and then he says in
[24:24] verse 20 27 and I will put my spirit
[24:27] within you and cause you to walk in my
[24:30] statues and you shall keep my judgments
[24:32] and do them you'll live the word because
[24:34] the author of the word is on the inside
[24:36] you shall dwell in the land that I gave
[24:37] to your fathers and you shall be my
[24:39] people and I will be your God I will
[24:41] also save you from your uncleanness and
[24:43] I will call for corn and will increase
[24:45] it and lay there's the maturity that
[24:47] comes adoption maturity and lay no
[24:49] famine upon you and I will multiply the
[24:52] fruit of the tree and the increase of
[24:54] the field this is what's to happen in
[24:55] your life personally by the Holy Ghost
[24:58] it's going to multiply it's going to be
[25:00] rivers rivers coming from the your
[25:02] uttermost being it's going to be an
[25:05] increase can you say
[25:07] amen I will multiply the fruit and tree
[25:09] and increase the field and ye shall
[25:11] receive no more reproach of famine among
[25:13] the Heathen did anybody ever noticed and
[25:15] I know some of you have that the word I
[25:17] is mentioned nine times and you're not
[25:20] mentioned at all doing anything in this
[25:23] he said I will do this I will do that I
[25:26] will do that I will cleanse you I will
[25:28] do it that's why I said no man can come
[25:31] except my father draws him first and all
[25:34] the father had given me will
[25:36] come you need cleansing I'll do that
[25:40] Hallelujah you need a you have a Stony
[25:42] heart I'll take care of that Stony heart
[25:45] and religion is trying to address all
[25:47] these things you got to have the softer
[25:49] heart to come before the Lord you've got
[25:50] to do this you got and I do think we
[25:52] yield to him but in this scripture about
[25:54] the Holy Ghost coming into you he does
[25:56] it all Hallelujah
[25:59] he does it all it's not you mention
[26:01] you're not mentioned doing any of that
[26:04] the word I is nine times I will take you
[26:07] out from the Heathen I will cleanse you
[26:10] I'll take away your Stony heart I'll
[26:12] give you a new
[26:13] spirit and when I'm done with that work
[26:16] and that's why I said the first Sunday I
[26:18] talked on Simplicity we can't complicate
[26:20] this thing of the Holy Ghost because you
[26:22] see now friends what I want to get into
[26:24] is that when the Holy Ghost is moving it
[26:26] can affect people in a lot of different
[26:29] ways and he can make people feel better
[26:31] he can heal people it's all the Holy
[26:33] Ghost and when he cleanses you and when
[26:35] he changes your Stony heart it's all him
[26:38] doing it if we'll yield to him am but
[26:42] sometimes it's preached where hey you
[26:44] know you don't have nothing yet and
[26:46] that's why I tried to say if God has
[26:48] done something in your
[26:50] life you say well I don't know if it's
[26:53] the Holy Ghost yet and after you preach
[26:55] this I'm I'm not sure but if he's done
[26:57] something you say I know God called me
[26:59] when I was a young boy at 8 years old I
[27:01] know God spoke to my heart I know I was
[27:03] baptized I know just a few years ago I
[27:06] know God led me into this don't you ever
[27:08] let the devil belittle what he's done in
[27:11] your life you ought to celebrate it you
[27:13] ought to worship about it because the
[27:15] same God that was doing all those things
[27:18] is the same God that will give you
[27:20] everything that you lack to make the
[27:24] Rapture yes he will
[27:28] praise God you going to tell me that a
[27:30] God Like that's doing all that work I
[27:31] said Sunday we are his
[27:33] workmanship if we're under his workers
[27:35] ship and stay in that powder's wheel and
[27:37] stay under his workmanship you don't
[27:38] have to be afraid that you're lacking
[27:41] something you just have to show
[27:42] desperation say God I seen that word he
[27:44] preached tonight I seen that word he
[27:46] preached I want that Lord that's my
[27:48] inheritance but you can't do anything to
[27:51] get it except
[27:52] yield he is the one that does the work
[27:56] Paul said I fear your Minds be corrupted
[27:59] from the Simplicity that's in Christ and
[28:01] I pray I can preach it this the youngest
[28:03] child could understand it this is for
[28:06] you and the devil's the one that
[28:08] complicates it thank you for watching
