[0:04] praise the lord
[0:07] uh we actually did not have any prayer
[0:08] requests today so that's a good thing
[0:12] i'm sure people have unspoken requests
[0:14] perhaps over the internet they do and
[0:16] i got a testimony we were my wife and i
[0:19] were listening to a tape last night and
[0:21] brother branham was saying that
[0:23] when people come in our presence they
[0:25] should be
[0:26] feel thirsty they should be drawn to the
[0:29] lord and i thought lord
[0:31] i don't think that's the way it is with
[0:32] me and so i i just pray that
[0:35] i can have that kind of walk that people
[0:37] would be drawn to him just by
[0:39] by meeting me so let's uh let's pray
[0:44] lord jesus we do thank you for your
[0:47] blessings
[0:48] lord the freedom you've given us to
[0:50] worship here today
[0:52] for this new church you've given us we
[0:54] pray now that you'll see these unspoken
[0:56] requests
[0:58] these hearts they're longing for you and
[1:00] may you grant the request
[1:03] by your power in jesus name amen
[1:07] you can be seated we've got a
[1:10] missions report today and it's from
[1:12] malawi
[1:15] there you go and not long ago
[1:19] we had a brother contact us that wanted
[1:21] to give 50
[1:22] 50 to 50 families in very poor country
[1:26] so i contacted brother alfred fury you
[1:28] can go to the next
[1:30] slide who lives in the cotta bay there
[1:34] and he years ago he had moved from
[1:37] like the long way up there to be with
[1:40] the people that he ministered to
[1:42] and he said he got stuck there so he's
[1:44] ministered there for years has about
[1:46] nine churches
[1:47] with the very poor people but the
[1:49] brother
[1:50] but the alpha told me that some people
[1:52] are so poor they can't even afford
[1:54] salt you know they just have no cash
[1:57] because there's
[1:58] they just live off of the land so that
[2:01] worked out well
[2:02] and and in talking to brother alfred i
[2:04] asked him how many people don't have
[2:06] bibles and he said well most people
[2:08] don't have bibles because the bible
[2:10] costs 14
[2:11] and that might be a month's wage for
[2:13] some people
[2:14] or half a month wage so he asked for
[2:18] about
[2:18] over 300 bibles and you go to the next
[2:21] slide
[2:23] and uh so these are some of the chechua
[2:26] bibles that he purchased and he was
[2:27] going to distribute among the believers
[2:30] the next slide there brother alfred is
[2:31] on the right with the pastor and his
[2:33] wife
[2:34] and uh you know some people have bibles
[2:37] but they're very worn and falling apart
[2:41] and this is the house of a brother here
[2:44] you can see the one on the left that is
[2:45] just
[2:46] grass roof sticks for the sticks for the
[2:49] walls
[2:50] so that's how poor people are next slide
[2:54] and there's the brother there so you'll
[2:56] see the next slide as you see
[2:58] people you'll see they they're dressed
[3:00] nice and but the opera said yes but
[3:02] they're
[3:03] they're impoverished at home go back
[3:06] and that's the brother standing there
[3:08] that we saw who was
[3:10] who was that was his home there you go
[3:13] and here's a brother who had he's so
[3:16] excited about getting the bible
[3:18] he's raising it up and the next slide
[3:21] you can see the one he's carrying
[3:23] is falling apart and so that's uh
[3:26] he had a bible but it was falling apart
[3:29] so go ahead
[3:31] brother alfred's with another pass from
[3:33] his wife go ahead
[3:36] another pastor and his wife husband and
[3:38] wife at least
[3:40] there you go there's a sister who's
[3:44] happy to receive her bible these are
[3:46] nice bibles too go ahead
[3:50] some young people there you go
[3:54] and this is a group of people mostly
[3:57] young people
[3:58] and if we zoomed in you see most of them
[4:00] have bibles
[4:01] there you go there's a group of
[4:04] ministers who got bibles
[4:07] go ahead there you go
[4:12] that's the brother he's so excited it's
[4:15] a lot the people are lined up to get
[4:17] their bibles there
[4:19] there we go and that's one of the
[4:22] churches we built
[4:23] was a year before last now and uh with
[4:26] the people in the church and
[4:28] who received many many of them he said
[4:30] that this church i think
[4:31] 93 needed bibles go ahead
[4:39] and one of the staples there is cassava
[4:43] which is a
[4:44] the root of a tree and here's very
[4:47] experienced
[4:47] what cooks prepare it because if you
[4:50] don't prepare it right it's got cyanide
[4:52] in it and it can be fatal
[4:53] but here she's grinding the flower
[4:55] grinding it up into a flower
[4:58] making it there you go
[5:01] cooking it over the fire speaking of
[5:04] getting our kitchen ready
[5:05] this lady was using her kitchen
[5:08] one more and they're her children
[5:11] finishing it up
[5:13] okay one more
[5:17] i think this is the video clip of the
[5:22] sisters
[5:30] [Applause]

[6:30] and he'll distribute him to the rest of
[6:31] his churches and if he has any left over
[6:33] about 350
[6:34] actually and he'll distribute those and
[6:37] so
[6:38] if you want to contribute you can just
[6:40] put it on your envelope and say malawi
[6:42] bibles and
[6:43] a couple of three weeks we'll send the
[6:45] funds over and uh
[6:47] and be a blessing this is fun i think
[6:50] hey lord bless you thank you
[6:52] [Applause]
[6:55] please god
[6:58] [Applause]
[7:01] so we're going to try to send some more
[7:02] money for more they have a
[7:04] great a bigger need than that what they
[7:05] got okay
[7:08] between you and the promises hebrews
[7:11] chapter four
[7:17] verse 1
[7:20] let us therefore fear
[7:24] last a promise being left us of entering
[7:27] into his rest
[7:28] any of you should seem to come short of
[7:31] it when he says this fear it's not being
[7:33] afraid it's
[7:35] it's a reverence it's a respect it's a
[7:38] it's kind of a jolting
[7:39] sobering feeling let's have a sobering
[7:41] feeling
[7:43] because it is a major thing if we come
[7:45] short of the promises
[7:47] it's probably the most important thing
[7:49] as a christian
[7:50] that we inherit our promised land and
[7:52] our promises and so let us be sober to
[7:55] the fact of anything that would come in
[7:57] between us and the promises
[7:59] you can do a lot of things in life you
[8:00] can have a lot of pursuits but us
[8:02] christians taking a hold of all the
[8:04] promises is priority it's everything
[8:07] so if he says let's be sober and fearful
[8:09] that
[8:10] we come short of the promises there must
[8:12] be some influences
[8:14] that will try to take us away from that
[8:17] and so we must be very sober about that
[8:19] thing is that
[8:20] i don't want to come short of the
[8:21] promise for unto us verse 2 was the
[8:24] gospel preached as well as unto them
[8:26] he's referring to the children of israel
[8:28] unto us was the gospel preached as well
[8:30] as under them but look at this the word
[8:31] preached
[8:32] did not profit them can you imagine now
[8:35] listening to preaching from moses and
[8:37] from
[8:37] moses was from god can you imagine the
[8:39] listening all through the wilderness
[8:41] moses preaching from god and all the
[8:44] time
[8:44] it didn't profit them can you imagine
[8:46] sitting every service and hearing
[8:48] preaching
[8:48] true preaching and it didn't profit them
[8:52] not being mixed with faith in them that
[8:55] heard it
[8:56] so how important it is that we have
[8:58] faith in the word of god we're hearing
[9:00] it has to be mixed with faith now i read
[9:04] chapter four and verse one that which
[9:05] talks about being short of entering the
[9:07] promises
[9:08] i would like to go back and put this on
[9:10] our minds because this is what we're
[9:11] studying out of today
[9:13] of things get between you and the
[9:14] promises and if we go back to chapter 3
[9:16] and verse 7
[9:18] then we find and hear some of the things
[9:20] that we'll speak on today
[9:21] that would be hindrances or things that
[9:23] come between the promises
[9:25] the children of israel many of them did
[9:27] not go in
[9:28] and here's some of the things listed as
[9:30] to the reasons why the children of
[9:32] israel
[9:32] did not go into the land of promise
[9:34] verse 7
[9:35] wherefore as the holy ghost today if you
[9:38] hear his voice
[9:39] harden not your hearts as in the
[9:41] provocation in the day
[9:42] of temptation in the wilderness when
[9:44] your fathers tempted me
[9:46] prove me and saw my works 40 years
[9:49] wherefore i was grieved with that
[9:51] generation and said they do always air
[9:53] in their heart
[9:54] and they have not known my ways so i
[9:56] swear in my wrath they shall not enter
[9:58] into my rest
[9:59] take heed brother lest there be any of
[10:02] you an evil heart of unbelief in
[10:04] departing from the living god
[10:06] but exhort one another daily while it is
[10:08] called today
[10:09] lest any of you be hardened through the
[10:12] deceitfulness
[10:14] of sin it's the second time we hear the
[10:17] term harden harden hearts hardened for
[10:20] we
[10:20] are made partakers of christ if we hold
[10:23] the beginning of our confidence
[10:24] steadfast until the end while it is said
[10:28] today if we will hear his voice harden
[10:31] not your
[10:32] hearts as in the provocation let's pray
[10:36] precious lord jesus we are thankful lord
[10:38] that our brother and his family has
[10:40] ministered and song to us we pray that
[10:42] you'll bless them along their way for
[10:44] coming and ministering to us today
[10:46] we are thankful lord to be in your house
[10:48] to be able to give our hearts freely
[10:51] lord we're thankful to have a safe place
[10:53] lord we don't know how much longer our
[10:55] liberties will be given to us to meet
[10:57] and worship freely but today we have
[11:00] them
[11:00] and we're grateful for them and we come
[11:03] to worship with all of our hearts
[11:05] we come lord with a hunger for you feed
[11:08] us from your eternal word
[11:09] strengthen the body of jesus christ and
[11:12] come lord and walk in this
[11:14] place lord we don't we know you don't
[11:16] walk in in your body that you had two
[11:18] thousand years ago
[11:19] but because you rose the third day
[11:21] you're still alive
[11:22] and you can walk up and down these
[11:24] aisles today lord and you can be here
[11:26] among us
[11:27] if we would just welcome you and we do
[11:29] welcome you father
[11:31] to come and walk in our hearts to speak
[11:33] to us lord
[11:34] to break down our barriers that we can
[11:37] trust you lord
[11:38] and feel safe that what you would tell
[11:40] us is going to be for
[11:42] our good bless and help us to today as
[11:44] we spend this day and bless the
[11:46] lord's supper as we gather this
[11:48] afternoon bless the entire day lord as
[11:50] we start the week this way
[11:52] god i just pray you'll bless it and
[11:54] bless the weak we commit this
[11:56] service to you in what said in the name
[11:58] of jesus christ we ask it
[12:00] amen god bless you may be seated
[12:09] now i know that in our uh
[12:12] type in the book of joshua
[12:16] in the type of what we're talking about
[12:18] the people going in and
[12:21] taking the land of promise that god had
[12:23] promised to abraham
[12:24] isaac and jacob and
[12:28] we have been speaking about that type in
[12:30] joshua and we do
[12:32] know that in the land of promise there
[12:35] if the enemy was squatting upon the land
[12:38] that god had given to israel so
[12:40] before they could have their land they
[12:42] had to
[12:43] push back the enemy fight the enemy and
[12:46] move them back from their land and so
[12:49] that types our lives
[12:50] we know we speak of the enemy who is
[12:52] against us
[12:53] the devil who has that we're fighting
[12:55] against and
[12:57] so that was really what was between
[12:59] israel
[13:00] and them taking their promised land is
[13:02] the enemy was squatting on the land and
[13:06] so it would be
[13:07] easy then for us to say i'm fighting the
[13:09] devil
[13:10] and i'm fighting demons that are keeping
[13:12] us from keeping me from the promises of
[13:15] god
[13:15] and that is true that is that is ever so
[13:17] true
[13:18] but it would be easy to continue to say
[13:21] that
[13:21] and say that it's the devil and it's
[13:23] demons and
[13:25] i believe that today there is another
[13:27] dimension many people don't believe that
[13:29] but there is a
[13:30] another dimension besides the one that
[13:32] we see and it's just here in this room
[13:34] but it's in the
[13:35] the bible tells us that there are
[13:37] principalities and powers and demons
[13:39] that we are fighting against that we
[13:41] cannot see this morning
[13:43] and their agenda and their whole focus
[13:46] is to come against
[13:47] believers that are the coming one with
[13:50] christ
[13:50] that's the whole agenda of the demonic
[13:53] realm
[13:54] if you don't think there's a demonic
[13:56] realm you haven't been a christian very
[13:57] long
[13:59] because if you grow in the lord you know
[14:01] there's something fighting against me
[14:03] and there is a demonic realm the devil
[14:05] and his angels are fighting against
[14:08] the true believers and their position
[14:10] and i believe there's another dimension
[14:12] that's here this morning
[14:14] that is contaminated with unbelieving
[14:16] devils
[14:17] to try to cause us to disbelieve the
[14:19] word of god
[14:21] and disbelieve the promise that's yours
[14:23] can you say amen
[14:24] uh it would be i try to come back to
[14:26] this example if you were given an
[14:27] inheritance
[14:28] then you probably have some people in
[14:30] your life that's trying to
[14:32] back maybe lawyers that are trying to
[14:33] back you off and
[14:35] take you take the inheritance from you
[14:36] keep you from pursuing it
[14:38] there's always forces to keep you
[14:39] getting that money can you say man
[14:42] and if you wanted your money you'd have
[14:43] to fight many times in court to get your
[14:45] money
[14:46] so the other dimension is contaminated
[14:49] with unbelieving devils
[14:50] to try to cause us to disbelieve our
[14:53] promises
[14:54] and they are there to keep you away from
[14:56] your promises
[14:57] to fight you back from the revelation of
[15:00] who you are
[15:02] jesus said to peter thou art peter
[15:05] and he had just made a statement that
[15:09] thou art the christ the son of the
[15:10] living god and and
[15:12] jesus said thou art peter and upon this
[15:15] rock of revelation
[15:17] this revelation of who i am is what i
[15:19] will build my church upon
[15:21] the revelation of who jesus is and who
[15:25] you
[15:25] are is who this church is built upon
[15:28] the next thing that jesus says is the
[15:31] gates of hell
[15:32] shall not prevail against that personal
[15:36] revelation
[15:37] that shows us first of all first of all
[15:39] that the gate what the gates of hell are
[15:41] against
[15:43] what is the hell and demons against the
[15:46] gates of hell are against
[15:48] a person having a personal revelation of
[15:51] jesus christ
[15:52] but he said when you have a true
[15:54] revelation
[15:56] the gates of hell shall not prevail
[15:58] against you
[15:59] can you raise your hand this morning can
[16:01] you say thank god
[16:03] you may struggle and fight every day but
[16:05] jesus said
[16:06] with a true revelation the gates of
[16:09] ultimately
[16:09] won't prevail against you
[16:12] a revelation of jesus for your day and a
[16:15] revelation of your inheritances and
[16:16] promises
[16:17] that is what satan is against in christ
[16:20] the mystery of god revealed
[16:22] the prophet refers to the new birth as
[16:24] being what is the new birth what is the
[16:26] new birth what is the conversion
[16:28] it is a revelation of jesus christ
[16:30] personally to you
[16:31] that is what the new birth is it is a
[16:34] revelation of jesus christ
[16:36] not to the church not to a group not to
[16:39] a denomination
[16:40] but it's the revelation of jesus christ
[16:43] personally to you
[16:46] and then later in the message he says
[16:48] all
[16:49] hell is against this teaching
[16:53] what teaching what teaching the teaching
[16:56] that you receive a personal revelation
[17:00] from god
[17:01] and the prophet refers to it he says not
[17:03] a church because
[17:04] a church can receive things from god a
[17:07] group can
[17:08] and all these other things but that's
[17:10] not what he's saying all hell is against
[17:12] what teaching
[17:13] not something that comes to a group all
[17:15] hell is against
[17:16] a personal revelation so so if nobody
[17:20] else was around
[17:20] and you received a revelation of christ
[17:23] and your position in christ
[17:24] hell is against this teaching all hell
[17:27] is against
[17:28] this teaching the forces against you
[17:32] is because of a revelation
[17:36] blessed be his name and that's what i
[17:37] said last sunday it's not that the devil
[17:39] is against your personality
[17:40] or doesn't like you personally can you
[17:42] say amen it's what you're carrying it's
[17:44] what's in you
[17:45] if god gives you a revelation he's going
[17:47] to fight against that teaching
[17:49] he's going to fight against that
[17:50] revelation he's going to try to block
[17:53] you from taking all the promises of it
[17:55] so it's personal isn't it so i know the
[17:58] devil and i said all that to say
[18:00] i know the devil is trying to keep us
[18:02] from it
[18:03] but there's something the prophet said
[18:05] that we should consider
[18:07] and that is that he said william branham
[18:10] said
[18:11] that his greatest enemy was himself
[18:20] and i think all of us could say that if
[18:23] a prophet can say that
[18:25] then all of us can say it as well
[18:29] so why am i saying that because we can
[18:31] make the enemy the devil
[18:32] all we want to which he is can you say
[18:35] man
[18:36] but if we keep pushing at the devil i'm
[18:38] fighting the devil the devil the devil
[18:40] we take an opportunity sometimes to dish
[18:42] it off all on the devil
[18:46] and ignore what we're personally not
[18:48] giving up
[18:51] and what's in between us and the
[18:52] promises a lot of what i will preach on
[18:55] and what the bible says
[18:57] is not so much the devil doing it
[18:59] himself but the devil
[19:01] using territory that you're still giving
[19:03] him
[19:04] to come in between you and the promises
[19:07] of god
[19:08] so i only say that to say the devil's
[19:10] fighting the devil is fighting the
[19:11] devil's eye but brother brahman says his
[19:12] greatest enemy was himself
[19:16] praise the lord don't get weak in your
[19:18] amens
[19:19] get stronger and if an amen don't come
[19:22] out
[19:23] maybe an ouch or maybe
[19:28] give me something to work with
[19:33] so we can put off all we want to on the
[19:35] devils are fighting with the demons are
[19:37] fighting you
[19:38] and and but when it's things that's in
[19:40] you
[19:41] that the devil is using as ground and
[19:43] taking ground the devil takes the ground
[19:46] the devil cannot do nothing unless he
[19:47] has something to work through
[19:50] the devil cannot do nothing except he
[19:51] has something to work with
[19:54] and territory that you keep giving up to
[19:56] the devil
[19:57] he's going to take it and he's going to
[19:59] use it now is it the devil is it demons
[20:01] yes it is but if you're yielding
[20:04] territory to him
[20:05] if there's a little slot of your life
[20:07] that you're not giving up
[20:08] he's going to say thank you thank you
[20:11] little demons are going to say
[20:12] thank you so much i'm just looking for
[20:15] some territory
[20:16] that i can get in there and torment
[20:18] because how many of those demons
[20:20] are tormentors thank you for
[20:23] giving us that area of your life for 20
[20:26] years now
[20:26] you've yielded everything but this one
[20:28] or two areas and the demons say
[20:31] thank you for giving me this area i'll
[20:33] take what i can get
[20:34] and i'm going to wreak havoc and keep
[20:36] you from the promises of god
[20:39] so it's not all the devil as much as it
[20:41] is
[20:42] sometimes us not yielding things in our
[20:45] life
[20:46] that we're just not going to give to god
[20:48] completely
[20:51] and that's why i like the song jesus be
[20:53] the lord of all
[20:55] the kingdoms of my heart because in your
[20:58] heart you have
[20:59] many different areas and doors and
[21:00] kingdoms and someone can give lordship
[21:03] over
[21:03] all the other parts of their heart
[21:05] except a few
[21:07] but when you surrender to the lord you
[21:10] give it all to him
[21:12] my body becomes a living sacrifice and
[21:15] there are no
[21:16] areas that i rent out to the enemy
[21:20] for a few days or a few years
[21:23] every room every compartment every part
[21:26] of our thinking
[21:28] all of this vessel and you know
[21:32] we haven't done all that yet including
[21:35] myself
[21:36] we haven't yielded everything yet
[21:40] because we're all still here
[21:45] i think if we yield everything and find
[21:47] our position completely in christ
[21:50] brother brown says she'll take a rapture
[21:52] when she fully knows her position
[21:55] so we're all still here and it's proof
[21:57] that we still need to come to church and
[21:59] we still need to hear the word
[22:01] and we still need to yield can you say
[22:03] man
[22:04] and every once in a while you'll come to
[22:06] me and ask questions and get counseling
[22:08] and anybody who's learned my counseling
[22:10] is that i'm not going to
[22:12] ge on the surface i like to get to the
[22:14] real cause of the problem
[22:16] that's why through the years less and
[22:17] less people come to me
[22:20] because i want that for my own life and
[22:22] god forbid that i would require that of
[22:24] you
[22:24] and not required of my own life i'm
[22:26] asking lately lord what areas in my life
[22:29] because i teach the people we don't just
[22:31] hide our weaknesses and just leave them
[22:33] alone
[22:34] we tackle our weaknesses and say god is
[22:36] there air in any area
[22:38] that i'm being immature in is there any
[22:39] area that i haven't given to you yet
[22:41] so if i require that in counseling you
[22:43] and get into the
[22:44] nitty-gritty and just say but what about
[22:46] this and consider this i'm not trying to
[22:48] be mean
[22:49] i want us to be mature i don't want us
[22:50] to be surface people
[22:52] because the devil tends to hide in
[22:54] things that we don't want to yield
[22:56] come on now friends and so we're going
[22:59] to talk about that but but you see now
[23:01] we all have it and we've got to find
[23:04] those areas that are in between us and
[23:06] the promises
[23:07] we've got to narrow that down and we've
[23:09] got to expose the enemy
[23:11] and we've got to say lord i'm willing to
[23:13] give that up can you say amen
[23:15] and so that's why of course that i read
[23:17] second corinthians 7 1 the last couple
[23:19] services
[23:20] that it says having these promises let's
[23:23] cleanse ourselves from the filthiness of
[23:25] the flesh and spirit
[23:26] so in other words there's a
[23:28] sanctification in our own lives
[23:30] in order to take the promises of god
[23:33] demons have no power except we give them
[23:35] room
[23:36] somewhere to weaken us so there's no
[23:39] sense in
[23:39] us always saying the devil is the enemy
[23:43] when we're the enemy letting the enemy
[23:48] in
[23:51] the prophet said in the breach message
[23:53] he says you all have heard me
[23:55] say that people said
[23:58] the devil made me do this anybody ever
[24:01] heard that before
[24:03] anybody ever said it before don't answer
[24:05] that
[24:07] wasn't me at all the devil made me do it
[24:10] and he says you have heard me say the
[24:12] people said the devil made me do this no
[24:14] no no the devil didn't do it
[24:16] you just wasn't sealed in because when
[24:18] you're sealed in
[24:19] he is sealed out can i get an amen
[24:23] yeah see this is not a wishy-washy new
[24:25] birth this isn't just something that's
[24:27] just a up and down backslid one year and
[24:29] get back and forth to god that's not a
[24:31] new birth a new birth you're sealed in
[24:33] by the holy ghost god is sealed into
[24:35] your soul the devil is sealed out
[24:38] now he may plague your minds he may try
[24:40] to get in your flesh sometimes
[24:41] but as far as on the soul level you
[24:43] didn't completely seal him out by the
[24:45] holy ghost
[24:46] seal the devil out and seal god in you
[24:47] didn't get sealed up
[24:49] he is sealed out yeah and now now when
[24:52] you went out to him look at that
[24:53] you went out to him uh-huh he couldn't
[24:55] get into you because the only way
[24:57] to get into you notice the into you is
[25:00] to come through the same process that
[25:02] you have
[25:03] he would have to be the devil now he'd
[25:04] have to be saved sanctified
[25:06] and filled the holy ghost then he'd be
[25:08] your brother
[25:10] i don't want none of that
[25:15] he can't come that path no way he can
[25:17] come there but praise god we can this
[25:19] morning
[25:20] i said praise god we can come this
[25:22] justified sanctified
[25:24] sealed by the baptism of the holy ghost
[25:27] if you ain't got that in your life you
[25:28] ought to say just lord i need to be
[25:30] sealed by the holy ghost
[25:32] god bless you this morning go to god
[25:34] with that and so now then he'd be your
[25:36] brother so you see
[25:37] he didn't do it no no you just went to
[25:39] the borderline and come back
[25:41] lusting for the things of the world you
[25:43] never went all the way
[25:44] over into canaan you see across the
[25:46] jordan the
[25:47] death to what the death to everybody say
[25:51] it
[25:51] self the death to self
[25:54] it's not the devil made me do it it's
[25:57] the death to self
[26:00] so this makes it personal personal while
[26:04] we talk on what is between you and the
[26:05] promises
[26:06] that's the subject that we're on so now
[26:07] i'm quickly jumping to the fourth point
[26:10] last sunday we dealt with
[26:11] three things that would keep us from the
[26:13] promises no repentance
[26:15] if we don't repent we're kept from the
[26:16] promise of the holy ghost
[26:18] because paul peter said repent and be
[26:21] baptized and you shall receive the gift
[26:23] of the holy ghost
[26:24] for that promise is unto you and your
[26:26] children and to many are far off even as
[26:28] many as our lord our god shall call a
[26:30] lack of genuine repentance will keep you
[26:33] from the promises of god
[26:35] i could preach another couple weeks on
[26:37] just repentance friends
[26:39] a lack of real true repentance keeps you
[26:42] from the promises number two
[26:44] to remind you i talked about family and
[26:47] kindred getting in between you and the
[26:49] promises i can take another four weeks
[26:52] on that matter of fact i was
[26:53] people what i heard back in response is
[26:56] that was the point
[26:57] that really really ministered to them
[26:59] that family
[27:00] that kindred you wouldn't believe it
[27:02] family can be so nice
[27:03] family can be so great but be careful
[27:06] they don't come in between you
[27:07] and the promises of god abraham he said
[27:10] abraham
[27:11] come out from your dad come out from
[27:13] your kindred come away from your people
[27:15] so you can inherit the promise he had to
[27:17] separate from them
[27:18] in order to get a hold of god
[27:21] people don't like you to talk about that
[27:22] because they cling to just the emotion
[27:24] of family and the security of family but
[27:26] you see we need to cling to the lord
[27:28] we need to cling to his promises the
[27:31] priority can't be clinging to family you
[27:34] need to cling to the holy ghost
[27:37] i may not get many amens on that but
[27:39] there are people
[27:40] that are clinging to the security of
[27:42] only family
[27:43] and not to the lord you can't do that
[27:46] enjoy your family but cling mostly
[27:48] to the lord because they're not going to
[27:50] get you in a rapture
[27:53] they're not going to give you eternal
[27:54] life they'll support you they'll be with
[27:57] you through things of life
[27:58] and we love family i love to have family
[28:01] there's i'll remind you some people in
[28:03] this church
[28:03] have lost all their family they don't
[28:05] even have family to go to
[28:07] they have to cling to the lord
[28:12] praise the lord the third thing that i
[28:15] talked about
[28:16] is compromise compromise is what keeps
[28:18] us in between us and the promises number
[28:20] four
[28:21] we're continuing on today out of hebrews
[28:23] chapter three where he says
[28:24] verse eight the children of israel
[28:26] harden their hearts harden not your
[28:28] heart i want to talk about hardness of
[28:30] heart
[28:30] being what keeps is between you and the
[28:33] promises of god
[28:36] i want to talk about hardness of heart
[28:40] being something that is between you
[28:44] and the promises of god this is what
[28:47] israel become and i'd like to look at
[28:49] how do they become hard a heart that
[28:52] becomes hard
[28:54] is something that is between you and the
[28:56] promise of god something between
[28:58] you and a further relationship with the
[28:59] lord in
[29:01] israel's case they kept getting
[29:03] disappointed with god
[29:05] and it they were they kept getting
[29:08] disappointed with god not because
[29:10] god was necessarily disappointing them
[29:13] because if we really believe
[29:15] properly god never disappoints us in
[29:17] other words
[29:18] i should say that if we look at it
[29:19] through god's thoughts
[29:21] and not human thoughts god never
[29:23] disappoints god always answers prayer
[29:25] god always if we're praying for his will
[29:27] he gives us his will
[29:28] when we mature in the lord we're just as
[29:31] happy with god when he says
[29:33] no as when he says yes
[29:37] so a lot of us don't have that maturity
[29:38] yet because you got all mad because god
[29:40] said no
[29:43] but the children of israel put god kind
[29:45] of in a spot of tempting him because
[29:48] they got harder in their hearts because
[29:50] they
[29:52] kind of set themselves up for being
[29:53] disappointed in god
[29:55] and the problem is they were unfaithful
[29:57] so in other words they were very
[29:58] childish
[29:59] when they had a need in their life they
[30:01] were going to god say we ran out of food
[30:03] did we come out here to die moses did
[30:05] you bring us out to die god
[30:07] supernaturally provides that need so
[30:09] let's catch this now
[30:10] there are need centered people in other
[30:12] words other
[30:13] they only want god to meet their needs
[30:15] that's it
[30:20] and if you're going on that level of god
[30:22] meet my need god me my ear and it's only
[30:24] about that but you're not pursuing
[30:25] and seeking after the heart of god at
[30:27] all then you're going to set yourself up
[30:29] for disappointment because
[30:31] there will be times that it doesn't look
[30:32] like god's answering just the way that
[30:35] you want
[30:37] so you get disappointed in god i preach
[30:41] to a lot of people that have been
[30:42] disappointed in preachers
[30:44] disappointed on how things turns out
[30:46] disappointed in their upbringing
[30:48] and all of it's real i'm not asking you
[30:50] to deny that i'm just saying how many
[30:52] years are we going to go
[30:53] to view god in all of that in only one
[30:57] particular area we can't just
[31:00] seek after god in this area and our
[31:02] disappointment and he didn't come
[31:04] through or something happened wrong
[31:05] we've got to say but god what is your
[31:08] heart because i want to pursue your
[31:09] heart
[31:10] and the children of israel let me just
[31:12] read it so
[31:13] it's read like the bible says so you
[31:14] know i'm not just going on off here
[31:16] he says he says hard not your hearts as
[31:19] in the provocation in the day of
[31:21] temptation and willingness when the
[31:22] fathers tempted me
[31:24] prove me and saw my works
[31:27] for forty years it goes on to say saw my
[31:32] works for 40 years
[31:34] wherefore i was grieved with that
[31:36] generation and said
[31:37] they do always err in my heart and they
[31:40] have not known my ways
[31:46] here's the problem i want you to
[31:47] underline two things in your bible
[31:50] works ways
[31:55] works and ways the problem was
[31:59] why did they become heart hard
[32:02] hard-hearted
[32:03] because they only sought him to see
[32:06] his works
[32:10] but god is more than just his works
[32:14] is that okay with everybody god is more
[32:18] than just
[32:19] his works god is more
[32:23] than just what he can do for you
[32:27] god is more than just
[32:31] your carnal mind and how you perceive
[32:33] god
[32:35] let me say this god is more probably
[32:38] than most your parents and what they
[32:40] seen of god
[32:42] you with me god is so much more
[32:46] than what your parents presented to you
[32:49] as being god
[32:52] and so when we grow we say lord do i
[32:55] want to only seek your works or do i
[32:57] want to seek your ways
[32:58] works ways works ways in other words
[33:01] they didn't want to pursue the nature of
[33:03] god and find out what his heart really
[33:04] was
[33:05] they just wanted to dwell in the realm
[33:07] of his words
[33:08] and and and so they kept this being
[33:12] getting disappointed with god because
[33:14] they were tempting him
[33:16] i have a need lord would you do it and
[33:19] if you'll do it i'll be faithful
[33:24] i didn't realize i was hitting a subject
[33:27] to make things quieter and quieter and
[33:29] quieter
[33:33] lord i have a need and i wish you would
[33:36] do it
[33:38] and if you'll do it i'll be faithful to
[33:41] you
[33:43] that's the children of israel
[33:46] if it all works out just the way i've
[33:48] planned and you do it this way
[33:51] then i'll offer my commitment to you
[33:54] i'll give faith and i'll believe i'll
[33:56] trust in you
[33:56] you're talking about a land of promise
[33:58] somewhere that i have to believe for
[34:01] and take my promises but i'm not even
[34:03] there yet i'm just
[34:04] i'm just saying lord we don't have any
[34:06] food and we don't have any drink and
[34:08] we don't have this now there's serpents
[34:09] here and all these things
[34:11] popped up in life and they didn't got
[34:14] their mind on the promise at all
[34:17] the heart of god was the promise not
[34:20] life's difficulties
[34:22] not life's losses i'm not asking you to
[34:25] pretend that you haven't had life's
[34:27] losses
[34:27] no you've had them but god couldn't get
[34:30] the people to get their mind off of
[34:31] their losses
[34:32] and look what they were going to gain
[34:40] praise the lord
[34:43] lord i'll do it but i'll and if you do
[34:46] it i'll be faithful
[34:50] but guess what they didn't and sometimes
[34:52] god didn't do what he wanted that they
[34:53] wanted it's it's amazing thing in the
[34:55] in in the wilderness because he just
[35:00] provided everything they asked for
[35:03] multiple miracles but
[35:06] later they didn't trust the next thing
[35:09] they didn't trust moses they didn't
[35:10] trust the prophet
[35:12] they found something else on the
[35:13] internet to
[35:15] have a lack of trust in the profit
[35:19] god does mighty things mighty things but
[35:22] it isn't just a few days
[35:23] and they read on the internet and now
[35:25] they got a lack of trust in the prophet
[35:28] again
[35:30] i know i'm speaking to some of you don't
[35:34] forget i'm
[35:34] i'm a friend to you
[35:39] a few days they read something and now
[35:40] their faith is all
[35:43] i don't know where i stand moses no i
[35:45] can't trust you i want to be back to
[35:46] egypt
[35:47] i want to go back and then god would
[35:50] perform something
[35:52] and they get trust again and then within
[35:54] a few days they didn't have trust
[35:56] i'm telling you that's where they got
[35:59] their hardness of heart
[36:01] because we're made as human beings that
[36:04] if we keep doing that
[36:06] with god our hearts become hardened
[36:09] and hardened and hardened and we back
[36:12] off and we put our walls up
[36:13] and we have a lack of trust and we don't
[36:16] trust anybody
[36:17] anymore including god
[36:22] amen so
[36:27] i asked you to consider these things
[36:28] this morning they
[36:31] later they didn't trust they needed god
[36:34] to act
[36:35] to keep them motivated they needed
[36:36] another revival
[36:38] because they only viewed god in one way
[36:41] to do an act and to keep them believing
[36:44] and god did his part
[36:46] god did his part but they didn't do
[36:47] theirs to believe not being mixed with
[36:50] faith
[36:50] they heard the preaching but it wasn't
[36:51] mixed with faith confidence
[36:54] i believe this and i believe the
[36:56] promises are mine
[36:58] and if i run out of food i still believe
[37:00] this
[37:01] and if god disappoints me i still
[37:03] believe this i still want to take my
[37:05] promises
[37:06] that's what god had wanted to hear and
[37:07] you know i always tell it is that god
[37:09] got so
[37:10] tired of the complaining and the fussing
[37:12] and up and down for 40 years he heard
[37:15] this stuff
[37:16] and he got tired of it and he was tired
[37:19] of the people
[37:20] and said moses just stand back i'm going
[37:22] to swipe
[37:23] every one of them off the face of the
[37:25] earth i'm tired of it
[37:29] and christ was in moses
[37:33] saying lord you can't do that
[37:37] look at your testimony think of your
[37:40] testimony
[37:41] you're the one that raised these people
[37:43] up and gave them a promise
[37:44] you promised to do it you promised to
[37:46] abraham and you swore by yourself
[37:48] and so christ in moses is reminding god
[37:52] this is your people you can't destroy
[37:54] them
[37:56] he said all right i won't destroy him
[37:57] but some of them aren't going to go into
[37:58] the promised land
[37:59] because why no faith
[38:02] the preaching was not mixed with faith
[38:04] in them that heard it
[38:06] and i always like to say that god heard
[38:08] this complaining for
[38:09] 40 countless years he got so tired of it
[38:13] and they sent about 10 spies over there
[38:16] and god is just over in the corner and
[38:18] he's toast so tired
[38:19] and when they come back to view the
[38:21] promised land and said it is there
[38:23] the fruit is there everything god said
[38:25] everything god
[38:26] said through his prophet it's real
[38:32] and they brought back the evidence guess
[38:34] what what
[38:35] moses said the prophet it's true
[38:38] it's there there is a land there is
[38:41] promises
[38:42] i touched it with my hands hallelujah
[38:46] i felt it it's real what the prophet
[38:50] said
[38:50] is true brought back the evidence of it
[38:55] and god is sitting there listening it's
[38:57] true and he's wondering what are they
[38:59] going to do with it
[39:00] and oh 10 8 of the spies
[39:03] said but we can't take it because
[39:07] there's great giants in the land and
[39:09] there's the
[39:09] enemy and there's this and to be honest
[39:13] with you
[39:14] we looked like grasshoppers in the sight
[39:17] of these
[39:17] giants they looked at us like
[39:21] grasshoppers lord we
[39:24] felt like this there and they were like
[39:27] this
[39:28] and we're like this and your friends
[39:30] listen i just
[39:31] this is my narration of it but god after
[39:34] 40 years is saying
[39:36] what am i going to do with these people
[39:40] what in the world
[39:47] so it's all quiet like it is now
[39:54] and joshua and caleb said they
[39:58] they still the people they shut all
[40:01] those guys up
[40:03] every once in a while we get a joshua or
[40:05] a caleb in here
[40:08] and they correct us when we're negative
[40:14] might be your husband or your wife
[40:17] they correct us when we're off track
[40:19] they correct us when we're
[40:21] having a lack of faith
[40:25] joshua and caleb shut everybody up they
[40:28] still
[40:29] the people and i just don't think it was
[40:31] just as simple
[40:32] could i say something
[40:36] josh hello over here
[40:40] me i just don't think that's how
[40:43] joshua's still the people if you read
[40:45] later in the bible
[40:46] he's a great warrior he's not this quiet
[40:49] guy that's saying
[40:51] could i have the floor a minute no he's
[40:54] still the people
[40:56] shut up
[40:59] sorry i'm not supposed to say that to
[41:00] some parents that's a bad word
[41:02] it is what else can i say
[41:08] i'm stealing the people
[41:12] be still be quiet i don't want to hear
[41:16] any more of this what kind of people
[41:20] are you god promised abraham god
[41:23] promised isaac
[41:24] jacob joseph we were in egypt for all
[41:27] these years
[41:28] god sent us a prophet to take us out of
[41:30] egypt we've just come through a journey
[41:32] with god opened the red sea god provided
[41:35] water
[41:36] god provided manna god did mighty
[41:39] miracles
[41:40] and why do we have to hear when men come
[41:43] back that have tasted
[41:45] of the fruit why do we have to hear
[41:48] people still
[41:49] telling us it's not true and we can't do
[41:51] it
[41:54] and i want to make a proclamation i
[41:56] don't care what happens in our life
[41:58] i don't care if we lose food i don't
[42:00] care if the government takes everything
[42:01] away
[42:02] from us we have a promise and it's real
[42:05] and it's been spoken by a prophet
[42:10] the things spoken by this prophet if
[42:13] you're going to ignore them you're going
[42:14] to find out someday
[42:16] that it's real and it's true i would
[42:19] rather you believe it now
[42:21] that's my job is to woo you into a life
[42:25] of faith
[42:25] now not to find out on judgment day
[42:28] because you'll find out
[42:32] watched much too much evidence of it
[42:33] friends and so he says be quiet
[42:36] i want to say me and caleb want to say
[42:40] caleb you with me bud caleb stand up
[42:42] with me
[42:43] we're going to stand alone just the two
[42:45] of us and we're going to say we're well
[42:47] able to take the land
[42:48] amen i only have two of us but we don't
[42:51] care of this influence
[42:53] around the message we don't care of the
[42:55] post that's on the internet
[42:57] shut up right me and caleb want to see
[43:02] say we are well able to take
[43:06] the land amen that's right
[43:08] [Applause]
[43:10] i guess joshua was a little bit more
[43:12] loud than caleb i guess
[43:15] one more time buddy we are well
[43:18] able to take the land
[43:22] god has given us the land and we
[43:25] are well we are more than able to take
[43:28] it
[43:29] [Applause]
[43:34] praise be to god
[43:45] praise the lord i just felt like doing
[43:48] that
[43:48] take a minute can you say man i get it
[43:52] for two reasons
[43:53] to praise his name another reason
[43:56] i have room to do that now
[43:59] brother jigs has room now and the third
[44:02] reason
[44:03] i need the exercise don't say amen to
[44:06] that
[44:10] and i forgot god sitting here and when
[44:13] joshua and caleb said that
[44:14] his ears perked up what did i hear
[44:19] for 40 years i've never heard anything
[44:22] like that
[44:23] and it perked up god's attention perked
[44:25] up his
[44:26] his faith and his confidence somebody
[44:29] 2 out of 2 million
[44:33] had a statement of faith
[44:36] we believe this thing we've seen the
[44:38] evidence of it
[44:39] it's real and if nobody goes in i'm
[44:43] going in to take my land
[44:50] just says well praise my this is awesome
[44:53] i can work with that
[44:56] i can't work with complainers i can't
[44:59] work with gossipers
[45:01] they were in their tents all the time
[45:03] just little chit chat
[45:05] against moses against the message the
[45:07] chit chats or the chats
[45:12] against moses against moses against
[45:14] moses against this
[45:17] the quicker you stop listening to the
[45:18] voices the more faith you'll get
[45:23] i don't even have time for it got a
[45:26] legitimate sincere question we'll be
[45:27] glad to answer it
[45:28] but i don't have time for that we're way
[45:30] too far down the road
[45:34] praise the lord so god was tired of the
[45:38] complaining in one
[45:39] now he has two men that's fine he's
[45:41] hearing what he wants to hear he's
[45:43] hearing
[45:44] this is what i needed to hear for 40
[45:45] years i can work with that
[45:47] i can take a people in i can help
[45:49] destroy their enemies
[45:50] i can give them what by that faith i can
[45:53] work with that faith
[45:55] can you say man you know what god's
[45:58] looking for in our lives
[46:00] not anything earth shattering
[46:04] amen a lot of you think what i've got to
[46:08] do this you're thinking about what you
[46:09] got to do
[46:10] i got to do this i got to do that and i
[46:12] got to get this and i got
[46:14] to do this and really what god needs is
[46:16] you to believe
[46:19] and have faith that's what he needs is
[46:22] where you need to start
[46:23] you need to believe and get all the
[46:24] doubt brushed away
[46:26] say lord give me a new birth give me a
[46:29] and give me more
[46:29] faith what's the man in the bible of
[46:32] jesus he said
[46:33] i believe but help thou my unbelief so
[46:36] if you believe already and you got some
[46:38] unbelief say lord
[46:39] purge out the unbelief purge all
[46:42] unbelievable
[46:43] burn it from my mind and my thinking to
[46:46] where i say i believe
[46:48] this gospel with all of my heart
[46:52] no if ands or but i don't know what to
[46:54] do yet i may not figure all this
[46:56] and i've got some bad seeds that i
[46:57] planted i got all that but right now i
[46:59] want to let the lord know
[47:01] whose side i'm on like the little lady
[47:05] old lady that stood in the line with all
[47:06] the soldiers with her guns and she had
[47:08] her broom
[47:09] in her hand standing with the soldiers
[47:10] and the general came down until he got
[47:12] down to this old lady
[47:14] and he said you can't fight in this army
[47:15] you're just an old lady
[47:17] i know i can't sir but i just wanted to
[47:19] let everybody know
[47:20] whose side i'm on
[47:27] i hope i can live a life that you know
[47:29] whose side i'm on
[47:31] but i want you to be there can you say
[47:33] amen and many of you are
[47:36] make you stand for jesus
[47:41] so the scripture i'm not getting very
[47:43] far today
[47:45] and yet we're making leaps and bounds
[47:50] so i'm still on point four that a
[47:52] hardness of heart can get in between you
[47:54] and the promises
[47:56] if you deal with god that way friends
[47:59] then your heart is gonna become hard
[48:01] over time
[48:05] god did his part but they didn't do
[48:06] theirs to believe no matter what happens
[48:08] whether god did miracles or not it
[48:10] reveals
[48:12] why here in texas the only one at his
[48:13] works he only knew his works they saw my
[48:15] works for 40 years
[48:16] but not his way knowing his works but
[48:19] not his ways that was the problem
[48:20] knowing the heart of god knowing the
[48:23] promised land is for you personally
[48:24] seeking the heart of god in his ways not
[48:27] just his works
[48:28] but his ways what are the ways of god
[48:30] god give us a heart that seeks his ways
[48:33] seeks his character seeks his nature not
[48:36] just one part of god can you say man
[48:38] we need people to seek the very heart of
[48:40] god not just one part of him
[48:42] if a person only wants to know god in
[48:44] one aspect
[48:45] then you will not always understand and
[48:48] you will be disappointed
[48:51] your heart will harden today people many
[48:55] many people choose what parts of the
[48:57] message they want they micromanage god
[48:59] they narrow him down to
[49:01] just a loving god that never corrects
[49:03] sin
[49:06] i just need god to be where i have him
[49:10] and when i need him and i need the parts
[49:13] that i need but the other parts i just
[49:15] i'm going to leave alone
[49:17] and when god does not come through in
[49:19] their eyes
[49:21] he becomes a disappointing god each time
[49:24] and i s am i speaking to anybody's heart
[49:26] here today
[49:28] you can't stay there you cannot stay
[49:30] there
[49:32] each time the heart is hardened more and
[49:34] more and there was there was always an
[49:36] underlying thing with the children of
[49:37] israel
[49:37] god do you love us how did the children
[49:41] of israel tempt god
[49:42] by saying is the lord among us or not
[49:47] god do you love us and if you loved us
[49:51] you see this is the mentality
[49:54] it's love at a level of just meeting
[49:57] needs
[49:59] god if you loved us you do this
[50:05] if you loved us if you loved me
[50:09] why did you take my loved one away from
[50:11] me
[50:14] why did they die how can i love you back
[50:19] when you didn't do it exactly the way
[50:21] that i wanted
[50:24] but in the children of israel it didn't
[50:25] help even when god gave them certain
[50:27] things that they asked for
[50:28] it didn't help because they still showed
[50:30] no faith
[50:32] when god did prove himself they needed
[50:35] another thing
[50:36] for him to prove his love there's no
[50:38] guarantee if god would have given you
[50:39] the answer you wanted
[50:41] for what you ask maybe god sees your
[50:44] heart and your lack of commitment
[50:46] and that wouldn't guarantee you're
[50:48] serving god with all your heart
[50:52] maybe god knows that that would be the
[50:55] guarantee
[50:55] that would be it do this lord and i'll
[50:58] serve you the rest of my life maybe god
[51:00] knows
[51:00] you're not speaking the truth he senses
[51:04] an unfaithful spirit no matter what god
[51:06] would do
[51:13] over time if you look at the message
[51:15] this way and god this way your heart
[51:17] would become hard
[51:18] how hard can you get how hard can you
[51:20] get one fella said
[51:23] to brother branham i don't believe in
[51:25] divine healing
[51:27] i don't believe it's true
[51:30] and why don't you prove it smite me
[51:33] blind right now
[51:36] he said do like the apostles smite me
[51:38] blind right now and if you smoke me
[51:40] blind
[51:41] i still wouldn't believe in divine
[51:43] healing or that you're of god
[51:46] that's how hard you can become
[51:49] the person who comes doesn't matter what
[51:51] proof there is it's not going to do any
[51:52] good
[51:53] because i'm still not going to believe
[51:54] you know what brother brahm said to him
[51:56] i'm not going to smite you blaine you're
[51:57] already blind
[52:00] you're already blind
[52:04] and you say well who's this meant to be
[52:06] he says it's meant for
[52:07] believers that believe it it's not meant
[52:10] for the unbeliever
[52:13] i should say this promised land the
[52:15] promises are for believers predestined
[52:17] for believers
[52:18] not taking the salvation away from
[52:20] anyone but we're going
[52:21] just beyond salvation to take in our
[52:23] promises
[52:25] can you say amen there'll be a lot of
[52:27] those that go through tribulation that
[52:28] are saved
[52:29] they're saved truly saved amen
[52:34] but my position here is to minister to
[52:37] the bride
[52:38] who wants rapturing faith and it's
[52:41] beyond
[52:42] just believing for salvation but it's a
[52:45] believe to take all your promises
[52:47] brothers you can do it sisters
[52:51] you can do it it's yours
[52:55] amen you don't know me brother paul well
[52:58] god does and he chose you anyway
[53:03] oh my what do i do now i'm only i'm
[53:06] number four
[53:08] and i have 10 of them to go so that
[53:11] leads hardness to heart leads to more
[53:12] doubt and unbelief
[53:14] tempting god saying is the lord among us
[53:16] or not that's what israel said
[53:18] is the lord lord or not they disbelieve
[53:20] everything
[53:21] they take a spirit against the truth
[53:23] even put it on trial like some are doing
[53:24] today
[53:25] i always knew that the message would be
[53:27] put on trial i just never believed it
[53:29] was put on trial but by people
[53:31] who used to believe it you're gonna go
[53:34] on trial
[53:35] but to go on trial what people who used
[53:36] to believe it it astounds me friends
[53:40] you put the wrong thing on trial that's
[53:42] all i can say
[53:46] it's pretty arrogant to say to god
[53:47] unless all my questions are answered
[53:51] i want all my questions answered unless
[53:55] there's perfection
[53:56] in the prophet and everything he says
[54:00] why are you requiring that of the
[54:02] prophet and you don't require it of
[54:04] yourself
[54:06] why does he have to say everything just
[54:08] right in order for you to believe
[54:11] and every prophet of the bible i can
[54:13] show
[54:15] were flawed men that made mistakes
[54:20] but why this one you deified so much
[54:23] idea fight him
[54:24] yeah you basically deify him because
[54:26] he's got to be perfect in everything he
[54:28] says
[54:29] why are you doing that for him and not
[54:31] yourself
[54:33] require that of yourself you're flawed
[54:34] you're a human being just like william
[54:36] branham was
[54:38] but unless i get all my questions unless
[54:40] it's perfection there are things
[54:41] difficult to understand
[54:43] let me just say a personal testimony
[54:44] there are things difficult for me to
[54:45] understand in this bible
[54:47] still to today there are things that are
[54:50] difficult in the message for me to
[54:51] understand still to this day
[54:53] okay it shouldn't be earth shattering
[54:57] there's things i still don't understand
[55:00] but i want to ask what right do i have
[55:03] to tempt god and say unless i get
[55:06] all the answers to all those things i
[55:09] won't believe
[55:12] i'm out of here
[55:16] what right what right do i have to say
[55:18] that i'm the guy that needed
[55:21] the cross i'm just the guy that needed
[55:24] salvation
[55:25] i was a sinner can you say amen why do i
[55:28] get so arrogant that i'm requiring god
[55:31] to answer all my questions let me tell
[55:33] you friends if it weren't for the
[55:35] merciful grace of god on a cross
[55:37] none of us would have a desire to even
[55:39] serve the lord
[55:41] that's where we stand can you say man we
[55:44] don't lift ourselves as
[55:45] theologians that we're going gonna
[55:47] question everything and god has to
[55:49] do it all before we believe listen we're
[55:52] sinners
[55:52] saved by his grace and we need to keep
[55:55] that humility
[55:56] god does not owe me anything
[56:00] god's already given me enough that if
[56:03] he'd never did another miracle
[56:05] i owe the rest of my life to him if he
[56:08] never answered another question
[56:10] i owe my life to him
[56:15] and if he sends me to hell at the end of
[56:17] this 33 years of ministry
[56:19] and serving him since i was 16 years old
[56:21] if god
[56:22] should send me and say that's your lot
[56:24] and sends me to hell i would still
[56:26] serve him with all of my heart if he
[56:28] came and spoke to me threw a bad soul or
[56:30] told me he says
[56:30] your end is to go to hell i would still
[56:32] serve them this way
[56:34] you know what my dad used to say he used
[56:35] to say
[56:37] if you think this message isn't true he
[56:39] says i would raise my family this way
[56:41] anyway if i found out it's not gonna be
[56:42] true in the end i'd raise my family
[56:43] because he said this is the best way to
[56:45] raise my family
[56:46] this message is the best way to raise a
[56:48] family
[56:51] and i said i said if he were to send me
[56:55] to hell
[56:57] i'm going to still do this
[57:00] because god doesn't owe me anything
[57:02] friends david said let my sentence come
[57:05] forth from the lord did you know david
[57:08] said that
[57:08] let my sentence come forth from the lord
[57:11] and whatever that
[57:11] sentence is i accept it
[57:16] doomed finished all right that's what
[57:19] god said
[57:20] thankfully for the bride of jesus christ
[57:24] the true
[57:25] holy ghost filled believers the sentence
[57:27] has come forth
[57:31] that we have passed from death and to
[57:33] life
[57:34] and because of calvary we stand
[57:36] guiltless before
[57:37] the lord the sentence has already come
[57:41] i don't deserve that can you say man but
[57:43] there's one thing about our friends he
[57:44] doesn't deserve
[57:45] i don't deserve for him to come he he
[57:48] doesn't have to come
[57:49] and just bow to my every little wish in
[57:52] order for me to keep serving him
[57:54] i was the one in need
[58:01] i was the reason that
[58:04] one earthly reason
[58:08] help me out he was
[58:12] huh i was the guilty
[58:18] he was the sacrifice
[58:24] i was
[58:27] beggar he was the giver
[58:36] dying while i go free
[58:39] that one earthly reason was me
[58:44] that's where we stand die to all your
[58:47] high
[58:47] falutin intellectual figuring things out
[58:50] and just look at yourself
[58:51] as a sinner saved by grace
[58:56] can you say men friends that's where we
[58:59] stand and that's the humility we need
[59:02] thanks brother dave you can sing that
