========================================

have the scripture there so you don't have to turn on it if you don't want to but it's good for you to bring your bible to the house of the lord amen when you have it you can say amen all right it says for we have not unhide priests which we which cannot be touched uh with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin let us therefore come baldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need amen another scripture here on second corinthians chapter second chapter verse 11 and paul writing to the corinthians he tells them least satan shall get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices amen if we can bow our heads tonight heavenly father once again we're we're so grateful or we're so glad to be in your house lord thank you for this opportunity that you have given us for us that we can be here lord and hear from your word lord if there is a desire in the heart of your children and if there is a desire in my heart lord is that you speak to us tonight lord that may i be able to step out of the way so that you can use me lord for your glory not for me to be just here and and and give a speech lord but that that wouldn't bring anything good lord but if you are here as we were hearing on sunday just one word from you lord that will be sufficient that will be enough for us tonight father we love and give you thanks we commend our lives and everything from this uh moment onward in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray and we can say amen you may have your seats it's kind of interesting for me because it's the first time that i have to um i i would say preach in this specific facility so it's a little bit kind of intimidating you know it's like you see well it's a good thing it's not on a sunday but anyway the lord is good amen so again uh is it's good to be in the house of the lord so um good so if we can put here the first quote that we have here is in uh i would like to title tonight tempted in all points yet without sin tempted in all points yet without sin so as we were singing there is nobody like you lord certainly there is no one like him amen he was tempted in all points yet without sin so i want to bring it in from a different perspective maybe this what i would like to talk to you tonight so uh the prophet of god uh he says god always deals he kind of he god is kind of you know the numerology of god is beautiful he he talks about 3 4 5 6 7 8 10 12 24 40 50. i hope you you know all of those uh so tonight we're gonna be focusing on this what what is number three he says like there's three things god always deals in trees we know the third pole and we know all those things in always in three men we know that he is perfected in three so we can say that three is a number of perfection amen remember in the days of noah they went in the ark and in the days of of sodom jesus was speaking of these two days of sodom they went out they went in in noah's time they went out in sodom's time and then we are going up in this time yes go you go in you go out but now we're going up amen that's what we need now we need a going up affair amen we need a going up from these things and worldly things that's got us bound down here amen so again number three as i said is a number of uh perfection number of uh that god will always deal like father son and holy ghost is only one amen a god in three offices amen and then when when when god came through the fro through the prophet it was uh the first second and third pool amen and then uh when when when we're talking about the work of grace we're talking about justification sanctification and then we need to have the baptism of the holy spirit amen so you see god works in three all the time and if you're in number two you need to have a number three amen if you are living under sanctification that is not enough if you're if you're living under justification that is not enough you need to get to a third except which is being filled with the holy ghost amen that's why his word is perfect god never fails amen there was one bible that was written where was it written in the skies and then there was one bible written where in the the pyramids and then now we have this bible and even greater now the same bible is being made flesh in our hearts amen so now praise the lord that feels good amen amen so now if we think a little bit and we're going to if you have your bibles we're going to put it here as well but uh we're gonna be going to the book of uh luke chapter four and and then we're gonna be focusing our evening amen if we we may take 45 minutes 40 minutes i don't know five minutes when god was with moses he did with him five minutes and he took away everything that he learned in 40 years so if it is five minutes tonight praise the lord if it is 40 minutes praise the lord but somebody said we should be we it should be an hour because we are in the message of the hour get that brother paul it's not a doctrine sorry we cannot take it amen so now luke chapter 4. so and then it says in jesus being filled of the holy ghost he returned from jordan and was led by the spirit into the wilderness that's where we want to start there first of all so every single time the enemy wanted to deal with people he will always stay take them to the wilderness or god will take them to the wilderness for them to be tested number one if you think about the children of israel in in the in the wilderness when they were out in the wilderness we don't have the scripture here but if you want to take note is in exodus 17 chapter uh chapter 17 verse one through three and it says that the the people they were um they were thirsting for water and they were moses gave us water so they failed the task because they could just say speak to the rocket and moses was was angry and what did he do he he smote the rock amen so in the wilderness they failed the test amen and then in lukas 8 in luke 8 29 it says for he commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man for oftentimes it had caught him and he was kept bound with chains and in fair in feathers and he break the bands and was driven of the devil into where the wilderness children of israel they failed the tests in the wilderness this demon possessed man was always taken by the devil into the wilderness and then if you read david he was in the wilderness when he was uh was facing saul and then when he was there then he was got the opportunity to kill that anointed of the lord but what did he do he's like no i saved me lord or forbid me lord to kill the anointed of the lord in the wilderness so as we we have heard you know it's like um christ there is a antitype the old testament was the antitype but then christ was he came to fulfill all those types of the old testament he he came now to tell us that even though he will go to the wilderness but he was going to have to prove something so as we see here luke chapter 4 he was taken into the wilderness but one thing he was filled with the holy spirit so if there is a wilderness in your life tonight make sure that the holy spirit is with you and not just with you within you amen and then luke chapter 4 verse 2 it says being 40 days tempted of the devil and in those days he did he did nothing and when they were ended he afterward afterward hunger number is a number of judgment is an is a number of that the lord has to to try someone you know 40 days 40 nights was was raining when when uh uh noah was was in the ark and now we see jesus 40 days he was fasting and then he was praying and then all of a sudden filled with the holy spirit now the lord take him to the wilderness and there satan was waiting for him so i was reading this scripture and never had seen this before because we always hear that you know the first attempt second attempt third attempt but i've never noticed that he was he was in the wilderness 40 days tempted by the devil and then if you think about your about your life how many days have you been tempted by the devil if it is one then you are defeated but as we read he was tempted in all things without sin in other words he was able to prove that even though you can have a a a constant test or trial or tribulation but out of all of those the lord will deliver you amen amen amen the devil will always always come to challenge you in all the areas of your life when you're tired when you're hungry when you feel defeated when you feel sad where are you drawing your strength from when you are feeling defeated where are you drawing your strength from when when you are feeling feeling tempted are you are you drawing it from the word of god or are you yielding to that temptation and simple you know how many people have we heard that they were feeling sad and they committed suicide or committed murder why because they gave the enemy opportunity to work through them but look before jesus was tempted he was filled with the holy spirit he was filled with the holy ghost and that was the only way he could overcome his enemy so tonight if you don't have the holy ghost it is time for you to say lord give me of that that in the time in the day of my temptation i can be an overcomer [Music] same things for us tonight we have to be filled with the holy spirit to be able to overcome the enemy as paul says i die daily how many can say tonight lord i want to die daily to my desires i want to die daily to to my cravings to do the things that i love to watch lord i want to lie daily to those amen and then this is beautiful because do you know that god also made us intrigue amen body spirit and soul in the youth i talked to them about it like a few fridays ago but we added more so please don't don't fall asleep on me these three these three bodies spirit and soul these three they have senses that if they are not controlled by the spirit of god there is where the enemy is going to get ahold of it and make us fall what's in the in our body we have five senses that see you you know you see you taste you feel you smell and you hear and then in your spirit you have five you have memory you know how beautiful it is when we remember the things that the lord has done for us but how bad it is when the enemy tries to remind us the the mistakes or or our past sins memory imagination conscience conscious conscience affections and reasoning that's my car memory imagination conscious affections and reasonings then we have the soul in your soul you either have faith or you have doubt amen so god made us in three parts as well but he wants to dwell in the soul because if he dwells in the soul then there's gonna be faith and it won't be just any type of faith but it will be perfect faith and the perfect god now is dwelling in a perfect people amen so body spirit in the soul in this first challenge the enemy came in how jesus was feeling so now we go to the first challenge it was like how do you feel jesus and the bible says that he was feeling hungry imagine that he haven't had a a piece of bread in 40 days how many days do we fast if we fast one day they were feeling tired and hungry and that we're to die but jesus was 40 days can you imagine that god being in a human form how hungry he must he must have been but there was a time to eat there was a time to fast and but this is not when in in this specific challenge is not when the the enemy wanted him to eat is when he was feeling that it was his time to eat amen but but he's when when jesus wanted to eat and and and in other words as brother has said before you have been called to control things and not letting things to control you if we can say those things could be the enemy trying to attack you every day but you have the power of god that you can say hey hey this is this this prop this is this belongs to jesus so guess what i have to control it i have to control my emotions i have to control my my spirit and all i know and all the senses that are there that need to have some control so the enemy first he came through how jesus was feeling and then he says and the devil said unto him if thou be the son of god command this this stone that it be made bread and jesus answered saying it is written that men shall not live by bread alone but by every word of god god has always equipped us with something that will always defeat the enemy and this is what the prophet of god said he said in the in the quran he says satan take him up on the temple and and and white watch the scriptures for him he says as it is written again he taking him up on the mountain show him all the kingdoms and jesus said it is written that was his answer and and he and he defeated the the devil by the word amen he defeated the devil by the word of god he never used any power at all he was bringing every divine blessing down to to the rich of the humblest and weakest of christians so what is it that you can answer back to the devil and say it is written it is written amen as long as you believe that that is the word of god as it is written you will defeat satan anywhere anytime and on any condition so tonight it doesn't matter the condition that you may find yourself the word of god will defeat it if it is something that is coming against his work against his work he will be defeated because the word of god will defeat the devil anywhere anytime in under any condition or any circumstance and that is the word of god that's what we were saying that jesus was filled with the holy ghost is what we're looking for that we have to read the book we have to read our bible we have to come to church [Applause] people want want to live victorious lives but then you you look at their prayer life you look you look at how consecrated they are and then there is nothing then that's why they feel defeated all the time but it is time for us to be serious with god and say lord if there is something that i am lacking tonight may you help me to recognize it because once you recognize that he is willing to give you what you're looking for amen amen feels good now listen brother branham says listen to this closely any divine promise of god then he says the right mental attitude towards any divine promise of god will bring it to pass what's your attitude towards the world what is your attitude when you the pastor is preaching here what is your attitude when the pastor says that they're going to be special meetings and people set up trips and everything knowing that there were going to be special meetings i get it when you have vacation fine but when you know in advance just letting you know that's what they say at work you know you have already set a vacation before and then they set up a meeting then we understand but if if you set up a meeting or you said something that you don't want to be in the house of the lord there is not the right mental attitude towards the promises of god because many times when when a person you know people is living defeated lives and then when they need god then they come and they are the first that are asking for prayer but when you ask them where is your prayer life when you're where is your reading life and there is nothing so how how do you want to overcome if we're saying here that the only way that can overcome the devil or that can defeat the devil is the word of god there's nothing else there is not a five step a 10 step 100 step to to to to be saved no it is the word of god if you look at the word of god right and believe it and that's the way it is written say god it is your word and take the right mental attitude towards that divine promise it will bring it to pass i was thinking lord if you have given a promise then i am a carrier of that promise now you have to bring the promise to pass in my life if whether it is your children where is it whether it is a new job where whatever it is if i'm taking the right attitude it will bring it to pass then you say god it is your word and take the right mental attitude towards that divine promise it will bring it to pass because there is no defeat faith cannot be defeated there is no defeat to faith amen there is no defeat to faith amen now that was the first challenge for him coming to how he was feeling coming to his outer outer feelings that he was feeling hungry he was coming to his body and saying he was like hey you're hungry you haven't had a chick-fil-a for 40 days to bring it to our days you know the lord's chicken amen making some commercial there i hope they break they they edit it amen you know you haven't had a meal for 40 days now you can have it but it's like it's not when you want it said it's when i want it because i i am now in control of all things that's the promise for us today amen we are not here to be defeated the children of god are overcomers amen and that was the first challenge amen he was coming to him through the outside amen and the second challenge in in luke chapter 4 chapter four i mean yeah chapter four verse five and the and then it says and the devil taking him up into an high mountain show him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time and then the devil said unto him all this power will i give thee and the glory of them for that is delivered unto me and to whosoever i will give it if thou therefore will worship me and shall be dying all shall be dying and jesus answered and said unto him get thee behind me satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god in him only shall thou serve it is written it is written it is written now look what was the second challenge it was it was about power it was about authority what we have been hearing from our pastor amen it was about worshiping something we know by the word of god that worship is not about just raising our hands or singing or or or or or things like that that is the result of worship but worship is about submitting to something as the enemy is telling hear jesus i can give them to you but you have to worship me or you have to submit yourself to me amen that's how the enemy sometimes comes against us every day you know if you worship me i can give you more popularity i can give you more kingdoms i can give you whatever you want you just have to submit yourself to my bondage because that is what the enemy gives he gives depression anxiety anxiety loneliness sadness bitterness but when we submit ourselves to the right kingdom and jesus said that there was a kingdom coming and then he says the kingdom of the kingdom of god is among us he was referring about what the holy spirit that can live in the heart of a person and that can can that can control the body the spirit and the soul because that's a result when you receive the holy spirit now you're under under a headship now you are under a new 30 and that that is the authority of the lord jesus christ what can that submission bring to you it will always bring good things even when we pray and we don't get what we desire but but as we are submitted to him we will be content with the results [Applause] lord i want this red car well what if door gives you a black car that's okay you should be content with the results this is this second challenge was about submitting what's about who is my authority so if i ask you tonight who is your authority jesus says jesus said they shall be known by their fruits i i'm like i'm going to take this off sorry i don't like it i always tell my tell my wife this is like my like the uniform you know when you go up there you have to just stay in your your coat on this worm here it was like just make sure that your ties it's okay it's long enough and the shirt is nice and everything forget about it and let's speak about the word of god my question to you is would you like to give him give god control over everything you have or over everything you are lord all that anxiety all that depression all everything lord i just bring it to you amen that was the second challenge first challenged the outer man second challenge was authority the third challenge and it was luke 4 chapter verse 9 and he said he brought him to jerusalem and he said set him on a pinnacle of the temple and said unto him if thou be the son of god cast itself down from hands for it is written he shall give his angels church over thee to keep thee how beautiful that sounds right and in their hands they shall be verdi up lest list that any time that thou dash thy foot against a stone oh wow that's beautiful because we were saying that jesus was saying it is written and it is written and all of a sudden now the enemy is like it is written how interesting look when the enemy cannot get you through your feelings when he cannot get you through your your submission to god he will try to get you by using god's word partially because then that is what brings confusion what satan was quoting jesus he was quoting it sounded very good however in this third challenge satan was just quoting psalms 91 chapter 11 um i mean chapter 91 verse 11 and verse 12. contrasting because the enemy didn't quote the rest of the chapter and if you read psalms 91 13 in the amplified version it says like this you shall tread upon the lion in adir and the young lion and the serpent show shall you trample under your feet on their foot or oh you will gonna you're gonna put the serpent under your feet why didn't satan quoted that to do to jesus because he was talking about him and that's the beauty of the word of god that we have to take it from cover to cover there was this guy brother branham says he says sure i do believe it this his name was musee and he says i believe it from giver to giver and i will leave and i believe the keyword also because it says holy bible how many can say tonight i believe the bible from keeper to giver because if it says something here those 66 books cannot contradict themselves at all and that is what satan wanted to bring to jesus he was tasting the water he was testing the waters and he wanted to see who was he but he was just answering with the word as we just read that he didn't have to use any power because he had it all but he was just saying you know what satan it is written satan it is written this is my position tonight i believe this bible from kiever to giver or from cover to cover even the first giver that says holy bible amen and when the people is doubting god's word it will always be because they are not reading the entire book when somebody comes with a question brother branham says that if there is a biblical question there will always be a biblical answer but you have to come with a humble heart you have to come you you have to come home humble and say i don't understand this amen so satan cannot if he cannot get you through your feelings he will try to get you through your authority or he will try to get you through what through the word of god and some people say well it's because i was in the old testament what do we say do we read the the old testament and say that was that was kind of it is it is kind of obsolete by any means amen jesus came to fulfill the law and he also came to what to magnify the law amen so that's why we believe the bible that's that's the purpose of the messenger of revelations 10 7 malachi 4 5 that is a purpose to restore us back to everything of the word of god not just one verse of the bible not just the new testament but to every word that cometh out of the word of god so that when we are when you are facing the enemy now you can say it is written it is written satan you are not gonna get me through my feelings satan you're not gonna get me get get me through who am i worshiping satan you're gonna get me through just a portion of the word because i am the word are you the word tonight amen listen the last answer that jesus gave him and jesus answered and said unto him it is said thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god and when the devil had ended all the temptation he departed from him for a season when you have had a a a huge bottle then the enemy is going to leave for a season be ready for that because when when there was a conflict between god and satan he says where where do you want to dwell and he says jesus was like jesus christ was i'm gonna dwell in the heart and he's like well i'm gonna do it in the mind guess what's gonna happen you will still have to fight in every day with your thoughts that's a great that is the greatest conflict that we're gonna face every day of our lives because now the conflict is do i go to church do i serve the lord do i commit my life to god or do i go to in the world and then jesus helping you you're like i'm gonna go to church even though i feel tired i i feel like not worshiping i feel that not not submitted not submitting to the lord but i will go anyway and guess what you have made the right choice and then look what happened in jesus returning the power of the spirit into galilee and there went out of it went out of fame of him through all the regions round about and he thought he thought in their synagogues being glorified of all that was jesus amen look after all the challenges challenges he faced there was victory as you can see there was power of the spirit that brought him to galilee after we face challenges in our lives when the challenge is over and we want through jesus christ we get more power of the spirit every you know every youth meeting we go every time we go to church the lord is preparing us you know as as we read that we are not ignorant of satan's devices anymore because now guess what that's what's gonna happen every time that satan come against you now you can you can respond with the word the enemy can take advantage of us if we are ignorant but we can be satisfied tonight that the lord has cast us not ignorant anymore because now we know how the enemy is going to come because that's the same way the same way he came to jesus 40 days and then these three major challenges saying i'm gonna challenge you in your body i'm gonna challenge you in your spirit and i'm gonna question your faith are you gonna respond to that satan it is written i am a child of god satan it is written that everything works for good to them the law of the lore amen why are we saying this that god always works in three in in three satan was doing the same because he's always imitating what god is doing brother and i was listening brother branham was like if there is always a bogus dollar there have to be a real one a real dollar if there is a a a challenge from the enemy and if he's trying to use the number three if he's starting to use the number four or whatever there is always a real one amen and we can say that david also had the same challenges before he faced goliath amen he fought he fought against the bear he fought against a lion and then goliath but guess what he was always ready to fight goliath didn't make any difference why because to god it doesn't matter if your trial if you think that your trial is small or your trial is big is big for god everything is the same we're fighting against listen to these we're fighting already against a defeated satan how should we leave tonight how should we leave tonight the prophet of god says if god who can give me victory over myself and i highlighted that in red because god can give you victory over yourself and guess what this is the prophet of god talking the people the the guy that was almost like god here on earth but he sinned he was a man but if god who can give me victory over myself how many can say amen can surely give me victory over the disease that is trying to take me from him the god that can save me and make me something when i i was not a christian he can make me a christian out of me by believing his word but now we have come to a point that he's not just believing he's putting that belief in action because i was thinking he's like the enemies and the devils the demons they also believe and they tremble but now the children of god have a greater promise that when this world is being materialized it is becoming flesh in their lives now it is not just by believing it is by acting on god's word and guess what it won't be hard why because now i have a prayer a a life of prayer now i have a life consecrated that every time he asks me something i'm gonna do it because it is written amen amen and we who are dead in christ are abraham's seed the other quote please and we are more than conquerors through him who conquer everything for what for me no reason for us to have for us to have to overcome anything because it is already conquered the last enemy sickness death temptation amen temptation what else we have here sorry the prophet of god says temptation all things are put under his feet and we are the seed of abraham being dead in christ we are abraham's seat marching on to victory to victory to victory isn't that interesting that the prophet of god had to say it three times i don't know don't want to make a doctrine out of it but it sounds good holding god's promise out before us and going on abraham's seat with a sworn promise by jehovah god that you will possess the gate of every enemy and that you are gonna put your feet under that serpent if i can tell you something write down that thing that bothers you every day and put it under your foot under your shoe and every day you walk you're saying i am possessing what is mine [Applause] we start by being a mechanic but then the dynamic we'll have to we have to uh make that confession we'll have to quicken that confession amen that feels good you will possess the gates of your enemy the prophet of god says this is not an option you will you are you are possessing the gates of your enemy every day sorry that was my note it's not the prophet of god but it's the same thing not that i'm the prophet but he doesn't receive a prophet there they will receive the prophet's reward amen however you want to call it people call it my depression my lust my anxiety my my my mind you know in the world now they talk about an inclusive language so what if the children of god will use an inclusive language and we start changing our language instead of saying my sickness we send it back to its owner and say the sickness the depression the anxiety the anxiety they don't belong to the temple of god on earth that's me what is his where is his temple or what is in his temple in his term in his temple there is my peace there is my joy there is my forgiveness it's not my sickness it's not my cancer it's not my headache it's not my stomach cake or my cake or whatever it's not my hair ache no it is the enemies and i take it back to him and i and i declare myself tonight he is my joy he is my peace he is my healer he is my healing [Applause] that's a very inclusive language no you can possess all things through christ i was thinking what does it mean to possess the gates of your enemy jesus possessed them he because there was a promise abraham was given a promise and your seed will possess the gates of his enemies in the old day whenever they will go to war against another kingdom that they had gates that nobody could come in or go out of that specific specific city you know if we go back to the to the book of um when they they were in jericho when the people of israel was about to possess jericho and amen it was what was the gates it was a way to protect their city or kingdom from the enemy's attacks when abraham was given a promise that his seat was going to possess the gates of his enemies these enemies this is what the lord was referring to that every time they will face a challenge they will possess and overcome the challenge who is the seed of abraham here tonight amen as soon as the gates were removed from the city then the conquerors were able to get in that city and possess all what was in that city many times the devil will come against against you with gates of identity crisis so that you doubt who you are but let me tell you as you as as soon as you possess that gate then you can see who you are in christ because now you can see what's in the city he wants you to miss out on what god has in store for your life amen but his seed has been called to possess all things all things can you say with me all things amen this is not just a little something a little victory here a little victory over here no all victory victory victory is for the children of god amen the end of the book says revelations 19 verse 7 it says let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife had made herself ready in other words he is already saying that there is going to be a group of people that is going to be ready keep quitting or keep thinking that you are not part of that that's elected once when his word says that his wife has already made herself ready she is already ready i'm part of that people when something is ready that means that it is not lacking anything is ready that's you and i in the eyes of god we are we already already made it if we can live with something tonight it's like lord i've i already made it i'm not gonna look at the circumstances what's kind of what's going around me lord but i just want to live a consecrated life i just want to say and respond back to the enemy it is written satan it is written that i am the lord that healeth me from all thy diseases that's it amen and then prophet of god says the royal seed was born he was tempted in every manner like we are just as you have to be tempted so was he the devil quickly have taken him when he received the holy spirit into the wilderness for 40 days and nights to be tempted and then he come out and at his death they drove nails in his hands and spinning his face and then listened to this and he went through every sickness when we when he was here on earth he proved that he could conquer sickness when peter's wife's mother laid sick of fell off of a pail of a pulse pelcy he touched her hand and the fever left her and then when the leper cried at the gate unclean unclean then then he said if you will you can make me whole he said if i will be the whole amen he conquered and took the gate of leprosy he took the gate of fevers he took the gate of covet the famous one these days he made every nature obey him in the beginning was the word you know and was the creator but now when this unclean unclean now he's telling the creator come and kill me it was something more real it was not just now the father above us now it was emmanuel god with us but now we're in a in a greater step or in a greater level he's not here emmanuel with us is now christ in you that hope of glory so now all nature will have to obey to your confession whatever your confession is tonight we'll have to obey to the to that he was the seed of abraham the royal seed the one the promise was given to through him abraham and all the seed that follow him up to the royal seed and all the seed after him god's promise it is true he conquers sickness he conquered temptation when the enemy spit in his face and smote his jaw he turned he turned the other side when they jerk when they jerk beard from his face and spit on him he never reel back he conquered the gate of temptation and took it and then you say my temper won't let me do it if you are the seed of abraham yes sir he conquered your temper for you [Applause] amen talks about these he he he explains these men his name was peter godwright he was a very very skinny and very small guy and the lord told him to have a fellowship at a specific a you know city and location and and everything but then when he was there there was this you know the the bully of the city that came you all you cannot have a revival here who told you he said well the lord told me to have a revival and then he is like well no you can you cannot have a revival if you want it you have to with me first he says well if that is my next job that's all right he took off his coat he bit him big beat him up and then got on top of him and and beat him in his face guys it's not that you're gonna do it right and he says i must fight if i shall reign increase my courage lord he beat the guy up and he said you got enough he says yeah he shook his hand and he come back and got saved but then he says that's what we need you got to do some fighting not with your fists but with the power of god and with what else with your testimony and then he says that's how you overcome by the blood of the lamb and your testimony there the devil he's got no strings tied to you you put these diseases on me but jesus christ delivered me from this disease he promised it to me tonight so how i was thinking so then how can i overcome i can the only way that i can overcome is by my testimony because that's what the bible says amen in closing i really love this you know when you're reading the scripture and i was telling my wife every time i'm reading my notes then i add more and then i add more and i was like this is gonna be i hope it's not long for you but notice this i want you to look at here after jesus was tempted in all ways he went straight to preach at the synagogue in the same chapter maybe the day after and look the book was given to him he read from an open book only the people of god can partake of the open book in other words only the overcomers can partake of the open book if jesus hadn't overcome the temptation during those 40 days he wouldn't have come to open the book the ministry of reconciliation the ministry of restoration to the people he was able to cry with a loud voice this day this scripture was has been fulfilled in your ears why he said it why your ears because faith cometh by hearing and hearing what the word of god because he just had an encounter because he said it is written satan it is written satan now i can tell to the people this day this scripture is being fulfilled can you tell that to satan today you can tell him satan this day this scripture is being fulfilled in your ears what is scripture that i am an overcomer that i am within that i am restored that my family is restored that my children are coming back [Applause] this day this scripture has been fulfilled but he had to go through the wilderness with the holy spirit in him if you're going through your wilderness ask him lord fill me more with you holy spirit every day more and more every day luke 4 17-21 it says and there and there was deliver unto him the book of the prophet isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the lord is upon me and then there were six things that he was sent to the he because he had anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted why is he saying these words because maybe during those 40 days he was going through those situations in his life he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted he has sent me to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord and this is six things that he was sent to do and then where's the seven he was the seven i am the i am moses that's the i am this day this scripture is being fulfilled this day i am opening the book so that you can partake and you can see what's inside of the book amen and number seven is a number of completion number three is a number of perfection number four is a number of deliverance number five is a number of grace number six is a number of of men number seven is the number of completion number eight is a number of eternity number ten is a number of worldliness that's what raven says in them in the message countdown number 12 is a number of foundations number 24 is a number of of worship adoration number 40 is a number of judgment number 50 is the year of jubilee amen amen and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and he sat down after he dropped that bomb to satan after he opened the book after he revealed what was his mission there then he just sat down and the eyes of all of them that were in the synagogue they were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears amen and amen i want to finish with this the ego does not fight the snake on the ground it picks it up into the sky and changes the battleground and then it releases the snake into the sky the snake has no stamina no power and no balance in the air it is useless weak and vulnerable unlike on the ground where it is powerful wise and deadly and i in this is what i learned take your fight into the spiritual real realm by praying and when you are in that spiritual realm god takes over your battles don't fight the enemy listen don't fight the enemy in his comfort zone that's why james said nobody said that he has been tempted by god because what we are tempted by our own lust because you are in the in the wrong battleground but why aren't you tempted when you're in church why aren't you tempted when you're reading your bible because you're in the right battleground don't fight the enemy in his comfort zone change the battleground like the ego and let god take charge through your earnest prayer and you'll be assured of a clean victory that's why the prophet of god says that even when the weakest of christians kneel down and pray the enemy is trembling the devil is shaking why because somebody is taking a step and saying i am possessing the gates of my enemies i am possessing the gate of my temptation not my temptation of his temptation that i am sending back this is not just an emotion but this is just an excitement to see what the word of god can do in our lives that you can live a victorious life every day you haven't been called to be defeated just take the enemy on the right battleground confess it to the lord and say lord i am coming to you tonight if there is something that needs to be forgiven lord forgive me lord i'm just bringing it to the right battleground and i'm just bringing taking all my burdens all my my trials or my temptations i'm just bringing them them bringing them to you tonight how many can say that tonight lord i bring my life to you i surrender all that i have if the musician saying come i'll surrender all my life all that i have all my desires lord if there is anything lord that i am not overcoming may i bring the enemy to the right battleground and as we read what's gonna happen you are assured a clean victory yes sir because that's his promise you have been given promises in the scriptures and in in the scripture says that his promises are in him they are yay and they are amen and what is amen is thus said the lord that's that's for us tonight this is not something that is coming in the future this is something that is in present tense the word of god will defeat the enemy and anytime anywhere in under any any circumstance and he was tempted in all areas of his life in all points yet without sin and now we're his children and now we can enjoy that promise of the hour amen izbar hits you want to stand up let's pray if you have something in your heart there build an altar in your where you're standing you say lord whatever it is you have given us promises lord you have you have given us your word that we can respond back to the enemy it's not my my sickness the devil it's not my temptation devil it's not my lost the devil this belongs to you it doesn't belong to me tonight because it is written that i am a child of god it is written that i have made myself ready and i am at the end of the book lord we love you and give you thanks for your word tonight lord thank you thank you for your children that have been receptive to receive your word lord is not the man that is talking here lord but it is you using the vessel lord for the benefit of your children lord jesus thank you father we just want to consecrate our lives more tonight lord bless us father and if there is a heart here that they may not know you lord or that they want to have a closer relationship or closer walk with you lord may you grant it to them tonight and if somebody is seeking for a refilling of your holy spirit father may you give it to them tonight because that's your promise that's your desire for us father that we live over overcomers like overcomers lord every day overcoming lives overcoming marriages lord overcoming children that's what you want for us jesus we love you father we commend these words into into your into your kingdom father for the benefit of your children in the name of jesus christ we love and give you thanks amen [Music] we
