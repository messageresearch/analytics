forward to it and so um that'll be as we said in October 19th I think is when registration opens so y'all come come one come on and man we love the young people love to see the Lord move upon the hearts of our youth amen well God bless you if you have your Bible turned to John chapter 16. amen John chapter 16. good to see amen all the youth that are here amen those that came amen and there's brother Elliot McGeary God bless you good to see you amen your dad told me you'd be here tonight and so good to see him and amen it's certainly been a privilege to be here with you I trust that something was said for those of you that were here this morning that was a blessing Amen to your heart and we have more that's upon our heart that we just want to say knowing that this service would be here tonight and that we'd be speaking and I just was seeking the direction of the Holy Spirit you know you can say it the the the well that we draw from is just a bottomless well the word that we have is so rich it wouldn't almost matter what scripture or what thought I would take there'd be something good you can say but I believe that the Holy Spirit doesn't the Holy Spirit doesn't just generically bring something you know across the pulpit but I believe that there's a specific word for a specific time for a specific group of people and I want to say Lord I just want to tune into your mind how many young people would say Lord let me harmonize my spirit with your Holy Spirit tonight and let me hear what the spirit of God is saying to the church here tonight I've got very uh just caught great confidence that the Lord has has me in the direction that he wants me to go and oftentimes that's not the direction that a preacher wants to go you want to go a certain way and preach a certain thing then the Lord has a will and you just have to surrender to that so I'd ask for your help how many believers do we have here raise your hand say I'm a believer of the word of God Amen so you know preaching the gospel of spiritual warfare praying every time you bow your head and you close your eyes and you pray you're entering into spiritual warfare and you know it's it's you're fighting demon Spirits you're the brother Branham said in this room right now as Angels trying to energize people's Faith there's demons trying to get people to doubt the word of God into question but in all of that I just want to say Lord would you just pull us up to your table tonight would you let your Holy Spirit just come and speak exactly what you want to say Lord I've got an open heart here how many would raise the hand and say Lord I've got an open heart to hear what your word has to say amen I believe that amen the Lord can really honor that amen John chapter 16 I'm going to just going to preach to you here tonight and I'm just going to title this message what is truth what is truth how be it this is John chapter 16 very familiar scripture let's just begin reading it here in verse 13. I'm sorry verse 12. I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now pretty powerful that the prophet of God would actually say that's why this revelation of the Seven Seals had to be opened because Christ had more that he wanted to say I'm glad I've got an ear that has heard what the Lord wanted to say and he says I have more that I want to say but you cannot bear them now how be it when he not what not it but he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all truth somebody say all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you all things that the father hath are mine therefore said I that he shall take of mine and shall show it unto you a little while and you shall not see me and again a little while and you shall see me because I go to the father Lord Jesus we just bow our heads here tonight Lord all together Lord so Desiring now God just to move ourself out of the way Lord I feel just such an unction of your Holy Spirit and Lord I just stand here right now God and say I surrender myself I Surrender my mind I Surrender Lord you know my heart God you know father is that even the weak leading up before this meeting God I would be praying and be meditated and asking you Lord what direction would you have me go for tonight this Tri-State meeting and what would you want me to say Lord I waited all Lord through the weekend and even this afternoon Lord and you came and showed up and gave me such Supernatural Vindication Lord that just showed me a such a clear path in what direction Lord I believe that you work on both ends and that I'm preaching to your children here tonight Lord and there's needs and hearts and father then I pray God that those that are here tonight who this service Lord would speak to I pray God that they would just say Lord let it fall into the fertile betting ground of my heart and let me receive my portion tonight God I Just Surrender my vessel Lord now to you may you come and take your word Lord and make it real to your children we ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the church said and the church said amen you can be seated truth is an absolute standard we could say you could use this word standard or Plumb line truth is the absolute where in which everything is measured I believe that there's nothing more vital and nothing more Paramount and important in our lives that we have than truth and pilate comes to Jesus and he asks a very famous question and he asks him this mess this this question and says who is truth or what is truth and it's amazing because it's the same question that man has asked from the beginning of time really what is really truth and I could say that truth is God's view on any subject care what it is subject you want to bring here tonight and what topic we could talk about truth is God's view on any situation on any question and on any idea let me say that truth is not what a scholar a theologian a preacher or anyone says that it is truth is what it is uh the message if I could say it this way the message of the hour is not what brother Matt says it is it's not what brother Paul says it is it's not what uh any preacher anybody makes it or has made it uh it's not what any person preaches it because no matter how dogmatic a person is or how they sound uh as they sound that they are the end-all people can sometimes be the end all to all truth and that they are the orator or the Arbiter of truth but let me say this that you know and people would say I'm I'm preaching the truth and it's the end and my interpretation of what the Bible says is the truth and my interpretation of what the prophet said is the end and it's the solution it's the all-in-one and and the one all finality of everything and that's just carnal man that's how he has a tendency to be in his mind just to say that I have all the truth as if he's has the rights to all the truth but let me say just because a man says that it's true doesn't make it true hello somebody I need your help here tonight just because that my man says that it's true and just because Google says that it's true doesn't make it true let me say it this way the truth speaks for himself and it doesn't need a preacher it doesn't need an interpreter to give it its meaning it doesn't need a theology degree it doesn't need an intellect it doesn't need anything it the truth speaks for itself I'll go further and say the message of the hour it is what it is it's not the message of brother Branham either letting people has confused the message of the hours brother branham's message and people have misunderstood this and it's caused me much trouble among people but let me say he was the messenger but it wasn't his message he was only the mailman of the message that's why brother Brandon would say it wasn't me who appeared there on the Ohio River I was only standing there when he appeared it's not me who does these signs and wonders amongst you brother Branham says I just happened to be close by as he begins to discern thoughts and begin to discern Hearts it wasn't his message it's a message from the throne listen it wasn't Jeremiah's message when Jeremiah would come with the thought of God he wasn't preaching his own Revelation or his own message when Mike hail would preach the word of God it wasn't my chaos message it was a message from Jehovah he was simply the anointed vessel that God had used to and to translate or be a conduit for that message from God so when when you rejected Jeremiah you weren't rejecting Jeremiah and when you rejected Micaiah you weren't actually rejecting you could mock Isaiah but you would never you actually weren't mocking Isaiah or rejecting Jeremiah you were rejecting Jehovah because it wasn't Jeremiah's thought it was the thought from the throne room of God sent down to a prophet messenger and he would speak and you either have a choice to believe it or to reject it and so the Book of Revelation was not the book hey we could say it that way that even the Book of Revelation was not John's book John was not the author of the book of Revelations hello somebody John was just the Scribe he was just the person writing it down the author the Bible says was written by Jesus Christ himself oh come on don't we have some Believers here Revelation the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto us his servants that were the things which must certainly come that was the message of Jesus Christ and John says he bore record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he that he saw unless it was uncomfortable for you it was really nice up here till you changed it but if it's bad out there I'd rather me suffer than them suffer so the prophet was listen the prophet wasn't the author of the message he just was the mailman who was Vindicated by God and what was the purpose of his Vindication to give you Faith to believe that what he spoke was not his own thought it was in his own mind so that your faith would not be anchored in a man but that you would have faith in that message that the message the man brought was from the throne room of God brother Branham was not who I say he was it's not who any man says that he is he was who he was he was who the word said that he was and so you say what is truth brother Matt it's the word which is the thought of God expressed and it's communicated the truth of the Gospel is communicated not by a human dialect or an articulation even though God uses men and it's important how we communicate but let me say this the truth by Revelation is a language that a human being cannot speak but it's a language that only the soul can understand true Revelation as brother Branham could say you could even have all of the doctrine of the godhead and miss the revelation of the godhead you could have him put it on a chalkboard and be able to lay out serpent seed with Biblical Doctrine you don't think that the devil understands what the serpent seat is you don't think the devil understands predestination and and the and the and the godhead listen the the the the understanding the intellectual academic knowledge is not the Revelation you could get all of the information and miss the revelation I could try to get you to understand it we could try to to teach it you could intellectually say aha I get it one plus one equals two two plus two equals four and and listen a lot of people have this kind of understanding it and it starts there that's perfectly fine it's good that we understand it's good that we we believe listen friends it's good for us to have knowledge it's important what you believe I said it's important what you believe what you believe will determine how you live what you believe will determine how you dress what you believe will determine how you how where you go and what you do it's important what we believe right so you can understand it you can understand it intellectually but no man has the ability to reveal it to you only God can do that himself that's why Peter says Jesus said who do men say that I am some say you are crying some say you're Jeremiah others say you're Isaiah and Jesus says but Peter who do you say and he says I say that you are the Christ the son of the Living God I know this is Elementary but friends I'm just going to be honest with you here tonight sometimes I believe that we glaze over some of these things and it's important for our young people especially to go back to some of the fundamental original truths and go over them again to make sure we don't just gloss over them as brother random says we're getting people to church but are we getting them to Christ the word we're getting them to a Doctrine or a theory but are we really getting them to the message and so that's why brother Brandon says above all else you should pray for revelation for with true Revelation in your life the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it but we will prevail against them so God is a god of Truth let me just say the Bible says the spirit of God is the spirit of Truth when you have the Holy Ghost you have the spirit of Truth when you have the Holy Ghost you have the spirit of wisdom when you have the Holy Ghost you have the spirit of understanding when you have the Holy Ghost you have the spirit of God it's the Holy Ghost the person the tutor the Redeemer the Savior the brother the Healer the forgiver he's all of the above and to deny one part of him you excuse and reject all of him let me say that again to deny one part and you miss out on the whole and so the spiritual battle God only functions in a realm of Truth whereas evil or the evil one our enemy is the father of Lies the Bible calls him and so God only functions in a realm of Truth whereas the evil when our enemy is the father of Lies so the spiritual battle that we face is a battle between lies and Truth so if you want to see victory in your life you got to start with God's view of the matter is that good and so many times in our spiritual life we get everyone else's view but we bypass God's view many times we get everybody else's opinion and we bypass the word of God what the word of God has to say to say about it so let me say this you can many times you can get everyone even our own understanding our own intellect our own knowledge and we can think we have all the facts but you can have the facts and not know the truth and let me say the facts can't set you free you can have all the information but not have the truth and I can say you can have all the emotions you can have all the feelings you can have all the sensations I'm not preaching against any of that you can have all the intellect and all the understanding and all the knowledge and all the feelings and all the emotion and all the sensation and miss the person you can completely miss the person let me say friends we need it all you don't just need a part of it you say brother Matt do you believe in do you believe in teaching I absolutely believe in teaching of the word of God do you believe we ought to study our Bibles I absolutely believe that every believer should be picking up his Bible and studying his Bible do you believe that the believer should study the message I believe that not just preachers but I believe Believers young people old people should be listening to the prophet of God the voice of vindication for this generation do you believe we shouldn't speak in tongues I absolutely do you believe we should dance in the spirit I absolutely I believe that's part of maybe not all not everyone will not everyone has to you need all of it friends I'm just going to stop here and preach for a moment I felt that and I'm just gonna I'm just gonna confront it right now let me just say this there are two ditches always there's always a ditch brother would deal with it of armenianism and Calvinism and and he said this cold start uh starts you formal church and then the hysterical fanatical Church and he said there's always two ditches to both sides and he said yeah he said it this way some people make Church a frolic and he said others make it a funeral and brother Branham says but it's neither a follicle nor a funeral it's a feast hallelujah oh glory to God I love that and he says and the bride goes through the middle and then he says that this way Pauline from both sides so what is the truth that's made up of both the left and the right ditch oh friends I've seen some cut out emotion I've seen others cut out teaching of the word of God I've seen some cut out dancing others cut out brotherly love I see some cut out the tapes others cut out the preachers some cut out the message others say we don't need the Bible some cut out repentance some cut out Grace it's the tactic of the devil to push us into ditches you say brother Matt then what do we need all of it we need every part of it I say God give me every part of what you have for me Lord don't let me sell myself short of anything you want to give me you say do you need the gifts of the Spirit you do do you need the fruits of the spirit you do you need it all the first church had the knowledge and revelation of the word of God and they told it and they preached it you think that the Bible doesn't tell the early church didn't teach the word they taught the word the Bible says they continued steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine they understood the word they believed the word they preached the word they live the word I'm almost the first church had maybe I'm the only one I maybe I'll be greedy and just take it all for myself how many would say I want what the first church had that's the revelation of the message of what God was going to send us back to not to owe six Azusa Street but to 80 33 the original Pentecostal experience the original Pentecostal message the original Pentecostal word I say God give us it all the first church had the knowledge and revelation of the word of God the first church had the demonstration of the Holy Spirit by the manifestation of gifts in the entire body not just the preachers they were participators the first church had the divine nature of Christ in dwelling in them on a daily basis they were kindly affectionate one towards another with brotherly love the first church had the gifts the first church had Faith wisdom knowledge speaking in tongues interpretation of tongues Gifts of healing the working of Miracles can I get somebody to help me preach her tonight the gift of Prophecy the Discerning of spirits they also had the fruits of the spirit love and joy and peace along suffering gentleness goodness godliness meekness temperance do you realize if we major on any one thing and leave out any one thing we miss the whole thing are you with me here tonight he says I have many things that I want to say unto you but you cannot bear them now you cannot you cannot you cannot understand them now you cannot bear them now I'm just going to take a little turn here just for a moment I have many things yet to say unto you but you cannot bear them now how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he'll guide you into all truth so brother Bannon says that the the Bible Jesus actually said it this way he that loveth the world now that word world is actually the word Cosmos it's the opposite of the word chaos now remember that just here for a moment he that loveth the cosmos which is the structure or the world system or the world order you say brother Matt do they mean the world has an odor oh yeah they certainly do you think education systems cultural systems social systems political systems you might think that they're separate they're all operating under the same orchestra that is playing a different instrument but they're all being led by the same exact Spirit you mean Republicans didn't put Donald Trump in the White House no they sure didn't you mean that Democrats didn't put doesn't matter if it's Joe Biden Donald Trump it doesn't matter who it is there's only one spirit that is controlling there's only one prop book of Prophecy that is controlling the whole world now brother Brandon would say you're either under one or two spirits you're influenced by one or two things not not three not four not five brother random said everything in your life you're either controlled from above or from beneath everything the clothes you wear the things that you put on your body the things that you listen to you get in your car and you make a decision to turn on a certain type of music let me tell you something friends you're controlled and influenced by either what's from above or what's from beneath I say oh God let my life be subjected only to what's from above let Angels influence me not demon Spirits oh God how many are with me here tonight to say Lord let me be influenced let my decisions and my lifestyle be up be a be a representation of an influence from above oh God [Music] so there's only one or two Spirits he said that are controlling you only one you're you're being influenced by one or the other and so the carnal mind Jesus says is enmity how many knows the Bible the carnal mind is enmity against God that means it's like oil and water this is Romans actually Romans chapter 8 the Bible Paul speaks it and says that the the carnal mind you say brother Matt what I don't what's a what's a column who has a carnal mind every person that's a human please raise your hand those of you that aren't humans and you're aliens or whatever you are here tonight you can keep your hand up do you know that every person in this building that just raised their hands has a carnal mind all of you you were born with you mean the Holy Ghost doesn't take that away from me no you get the mind of Jesus but brother random says you'll have this this rotten flesh will bother you until the day that you die a cockle burn nature he said the inside is a seed of God but the outside has a sticky nature to be carnally minded the Bible says is death but to be spiritually minded is life is that what the Bible says it says to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against God for it's not subject to the law of God nor indeed can be that means you can't train it you can't discipline it you can't force it you can't make it it is in its own nature and efforts of essence brother by Adam says and why I'm against organized religion 1962 the wisdom that man can accumulate to prove and to show all these things why man should do this and man should do that it's contrary and enmity the carnal mind to God so what did the prophet say after enmity meant it meant to be contrary brother random says it means it means Romans 8 it means it's contrary to the word of God let me just stop here for a minute and just say that the Apostle Paul was saying that the carnal mind was the the Apostle Paul did not say that the carnal mind is at enmity with God but he said it's enmity it's self he put it even stronger than that and said the carnal mind is enmity against God it's not black but Blackness it's not at enmity but it's enmity itself it's not corrupt it's corruption it's not rebellious it's Rebellion I'm going to preach I'm just going to keep on preaching this is the carnamine the human mind it's not rebellious it's it's self-rebellion it's not Wicked it's wickedness the heart though it be deceitful is positively deceit it is evil in the concrete sin in the essence it's not envy envious against God it's in the itself it's not at enmity it's actually enmity brother Adam says here then they bound the church with another Court as Delilah did and they begin instead of having God called men who were called by the Holy Spirit maybe didn't know their ABCs but they knowed Christ then the church got stylish and fashioned after the political speakers and they had to give their preachers doctors degrees and everybody had to be a doctorate of divinity that was another Court to bind the church men go off and study each Seminary tries to produce a better scholar so that their churches can brag our pastor is the doctor of divinity and what they what what did they do one would try to have more knowledge than the other well that doesn't mean anything in the sight of God there's no for no need for any man to try to take his worldly knowledge and ever please God with it it's an abomination in the sight of God you'll never please God with the worldly Ambitions of knowledge because it's enmity to God it's sort of like we read this morning when Peter says Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give I unto you know what the modern church can say today power of God Have I None but silver and gold give I to you the very opposite a church that was rich increased with Goods would have need of nothing listen what the prophet says here there's no need for any man to try to take his worldly knowledge he says and each one tries to have all the knowledge they know just what to do the words to say and it becomes just a political speech in the stead of a powerly demonstrated Holy Spirit message that sinks to the heart of a man and discovers his sins I say God give us a powerful message that sinks to the very heart of man and Pricks him in his heart and he says what must I do to be saved I'm just going to keep reading him this is so good I don't want to skip over brother random says we don't need that Paul said the word come to us not only are the gospel in word only but through the power and the manifestation of the Holy Ghost that brought the gospel demonstrating the power of the Holy Ghost but all these men go off to seminaries and they learn great education how they must stand before the people and how they must prevent present themselves how they must stand before and he says and how they must stress and how they must act and they should never use the wrong grammar now that's all right for a political speech but we're not after the enchanted words of man I say Amen brother Adam Paul said the gospel that I preached I didn't come like that but it came through the renewing of the Holy Ghost and the power and demonstrations does it come by a right form of speech that your wisdom would be or your trust would be in the wisdom of a man but it come through the demonstrations of the power of the Risen Christ that's the gospel to know him in the power of his resurrection and so brother Madam says this this is a this is this is so powerful here I'm just gonna stop here just for a moment and maybe take a a little turn but it was so so amazing to me as I was seeing a video of a man a pastor of a massive mega church and he's got thousands of people there uh in his in his assembly and he's just a modern day uh uh Church theorem and he's up there talking and he's gonna try to address the the trans community and the homosexual and lgbt2 uh well I'm not even going to try to say it uh Community any any and he's and he's gonna this is good man I'm not not criticizing him but I just thought how pitiful it was you see I watch him as he gets up there and he says we just want to give a message to our trans Community we want to give them something that just to say something and he says him he says I just want to show the community that we love you and we understand you and and and and we just want you to know that trans people are welcome here and I just sat there and watched this man as you can tell every word was so measured and so careful and he was just tiptoeing on everything he could say you imagine the amount of pressure I can't even imagine the amount of pressure that a man's under with thousands of people and got a big congregation and all the expectations that that that were under him and I watched that man as he tried so carefully to dance around it and to be careful over the words that he spoke and be careful of how he worded and be careful of how to set it to make sure that he said it just right and and said it in just the just the right way and and you know we're going to teach you the word and they were just walking on eggshells trying so hard not to offend anybody let me just say this you will never help a demon spirit by petting him oh I should get a loud amen from that you will never help a person like that because you're not dealing with a person you're dealing with a spirit and until you're willing to call it what it is because the spirit loves to be better just pet me more walk around me more I love to hear it that way they love to be Patty caked but let me just say it here today it's a spirit and let me just say men have become if we're not careful we become afraid and let Spirits back us into Corners I'm just going to stop praying be real simple and say more than ever before we need to preach the word of God preach it without fear preach it on a shame preach it boldly my brother and my sister well we need more than ever before and I believe that there are believers and young people here tonight they don't say preach the word of God brother Matt preach it straight preach at Gun Barrel straight don't hold back for my feelings brother Matt preach me the word of God you will never change a disbelieving heart by playing around with it let me quote the words of my good friend feelings are overrated put that on a T-shirt and wear it I said feelings are overrated what we need is the bare knuckle gospel it's the only thing that will set you free I say the bear-knuckled gospel of the truth of the Living God is the only thing that brings power over the kingdom of darkness we have become so afraid to offend people but let me just say this the true gospel the true gospel I'm not talking about a Jesus that's just preached the nominal churches I'm preaching the true word of God the truth of the word of the Gospel has always been and will always be a bold declaration that doesn't care about your feelings and I say give me the word how many Believers would just identify with that and say God give me the word don't dance around with it give me the true unadulterated word of God give me the bare-knuckled gospel that will change my heart it's the only thing that'll set people free listen friends what did Jesus's gospel get him crowds people popularity it got him hung on a cross what about Peter what about Paul got his head chopped off what did the true gospel where Peter would say I am not ashamed or Paul of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and we live in a culture that doesn't want to hear the truth we live in a culture even the carnal mind and listen friends I'm just going to go out and preach it we deal with it right in message churches we deal with spirits of rebellion that wants to hold back or or wants to sit there and resist the word of God and resist the truth of the Gospel but I say more than ever before preach the word of God preach it be instant in season and out of season it's the only thing that'll set you free this is what Paul told Timothy and he warned Timothy I love this so much listen the the the spirit of this age listen I'm so glad to say this we've got a message that we shouldn't be ashamed of we've got a message that we don't have to dance around or move around or be careful with or try not to hurt anybody's feelings we've got a message that came from the throne room of God and I say we are To Boldly declare it we ought to boldly stand for it as we sing the song Take Your stand for the word of God take your stand for the message of the hour it doesn't matter what it costs you it's the only thing that'll bring freedom do you realize what you have is the rapture message do we realize Church what you have is the body change message excites you here tonight what you have is the coming of the Lord message it's the spirit of truth it's the guide it's the things that are to be it's the fullness of the revelation how do we think how do we believe that we will take a Rapture if we're not hearing the Rapture message well I would say I'm going to hide behind this Pulpit but everybody can see me anyway I'm just going to preach the truth come on Church how do we think that we're going to receive a body change when we're not listening to the message that changes your body you say brother Matt you believe the message I believe that Faith cometh by hearing and hearing comes by the word of God and there's no possible way you say how are we going to take a body change you won't how you going to take a Rapture if you're not hearing a Rapture message you won't why did Jesus say over and over again I think it's a spirit in this day and I'm just going to preach it here for a moment and disobeying the Lord you know there's a spirit that Creeps in our churches that say we shouldn't quote the prophet anymore well I knew that'd go over pretty sour so it's all right I was expecting it there's a spirit that says don't quote brother Brandon anymore you know the same exact time there's also a spirit that says preachers don't not ought to preach you ought to this play tapes isn't it amazing that the devil always tries to put a scarecrow up to keep God's family away from the real truth of the animal and we don't believe in playing only playing tapes push play and Obey we don't we we don't believe in that but let me just say here today I push play every day and you better be pushing play every day don't you realize Satan would take something that's so valuable to the family of God and put a scarecrow up to try to back you off of something and push you over into a corner into a ditch and then others say you shouldn't well we shouldn't quote brother Brandon we we can we can we can preach it but we don't have to say brother Branham said let me just tell you Jesus over and over again would say that it might be fulfilled by the words of the prophet you think Jesus didn't quote a prophet Jesus lived and preached the message of prophets all right somebody I said Jesus lived and preached the message of prophets Luke Chapter 18. you don't don't believe me let me give you some scriptures then he took unto him the twelve and said unto them behold we go up to Jerusalem and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the son of man shall be accomplished Luke 24 then he said unto them all fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken Paul says in Acts chapter 3 yea and all the prophets from Samuel and all those that follow after as many as have spoken have likewise foretold of these days John the Baptist in John Matthew chapter 3. now in those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness saying repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand for this is the one referred to by Isaiah the prophet I'll just go ahead and say it if Jesus would quote prophets and Paul would quote prophets and John the Baptist quoted prophets I think it's high time we're not ashamed to quote the prophet of God [Applause] don't you realize it was this is the same exact spirit that would come in Acts chapter 2 and try to tell them not to preach from Jesus not to quote from Jesus this is exactly what he says he says no don't you know in Matthew chapter 12 it says that they tried to warn them not to preach in the name of Jesus because he's scared of the name he's scared of what you speak and what you confess and what you say but let me just say this what did Peter say when the word was being fulfilled in Acts 2 the Bible says others mocking said these men are full of new wine uh Peter standing up with 11 lifted up his voice I already said it like this for the matter he was real quiet when he said it and it is real quietly just very calmly oh no he wasn't like he was a very monotone very monotone when he spoke it and he spoke it just like this no he said by the man you believe that we always got to raise a voice no not all the time but I believe when you're declaring the word of God it should be cleared by inspiration and boldness the Bible says that he lifted his voice and said you men of Judea and all the men that dwell at Jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words for these are not drunken as you suppose seeing it's the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel so what was he doing he was prophecy he was relating and resaying what a prophet said because the words of the Prophet were not the words of the Prophet they were the words from the throne room of God and I say today we ought to be unashamed to declare the full counsel of God let me say that Satan doesn't hate preachers nope Satan doesn't hate preachers in fact he's got quite a big crew of them what he hates is what's being preached preach in fact do you realize in this end time the day and age that you're speaking of and I'm talking about 20 23. the day and age you're speaking of in fact the Bible says that it would be Satan who would anoint people's hearts to Heap unto themselves teachers having itching ears this is what it says in second Timothy chapter four I love this so much Timothy I charge thee II Timothy 4 verse 1. I charge thee notice the soberness tough pause the words to Timothy Timothy charge you in other words this isn't a recommendation I'm not just going to give you good free advice and good to Sound Advice Timothy you know what you know it'd probably be a good idea no no no this was important Timothy I charge you in other words I command you I command you Timothy before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead and his appearing what was he doing he scanned Timothy I want you to know how important this is I want you to know how essential this is I'm going to command you not just by the Lord Jesus Christ but Paul goes on and he says by the judge who shall judge the quick and the dead preach preach the word the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all along suffering and Doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine all my friends if you are ever living in the Fulfillment of sex of second Timothy chapter four it's right now for the time will come when they don't want to hear it they want to hear something they don't want to hear the word you know that's what separates and always makes the difference as we said this morning they came for the fishes and lobes but when Jesus began to teach the word oh the Bible says many of them that walked with him walked with they said this is a hard Saiyan who can bear it who can bear the Saiyan did it rationalize it didn't fit with their carnal mind it didn't sound right he says preach the word reprove rebuke exhort for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after notice after their own lusts shall Heap unto themselves barstools bar rooms drugs no that's not what we're talking about here don't you realize friends one of the worst Spirits the one of the most binding Spirits a person can receive as a demon Spirit of religion that'll make you more spiritual than you ever were when you sat on a church pew it'll make you more religious because the religion is no longer the Bible or the unfallible word of God the infallible word suddenly now the new denomination a new religion that they're following is the religion of themself because they believe what they think more than anything that is written or said or prophesied this is the day and age that you're living in It's A Dark Day an evil day where men's thoughts the Bible said men would become lovers of their own self I know we've preached on this here before but I'm just going to go over it again it doesn't mean you stand in the mirror and go oh boy I just look so good my goodness look at my look at myself oh boy I'm just such a good looking guy I just look so that's not what it means to love yourself oh no no no it's much more closer than that To Love Yourself is simply to exalt what you think over what's been revealed men shall be lovers of their own self posters proud indignant and they will become lovers of their own self of what they think Paul said Timothy the time will come when they don't want to hear sound Doctrine but after their own lusts they shall Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away from the truth and shall be turned unto Fables I'm going to read you this from the message translation this is Eugene Peterson not the message of the hour but I'm thankful for this translation called the message you're going to find that there will be times when people will have no stomach for solid teaching but will fill up their bellies on religious junk food and opinions that tickle their fancy they'll turn their backs on the truth and Chase mirages do you realize this is prophesied in the day and age that you live in for instance or people are more content by just rationaling and out well I've got a relationship for God you don't have to tell me I've got my own relationship with the Lord I no doubt that you have a relationship with the Jesus that is not so Church the Jesus of the Bible well you don't have to tell me how to live I got my own relationship and people listen we live in an age where people will just sit in a message Church no matter what's being preached and they'll open their Bible they'll start studying their Bible they'll start writing notes why are the preachers preaching be right on their phone doing their own little thing doing their own little in their own little world disconnected hearing uh no doubt but people have developed the ability to tune out the preaching of the word of God we live in this kind of age where man's mind has been so exalted but do you know what the real truth you know what the real evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost is it's not a dance it's not a shout it's not an emotion it's not a sensation it's what are you doing with the word for your age that's the evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost what are you doing with the word that's been revealed to you oh come on friends I even think to myself and say what am I doing when the word of God comes and confronts my life and confronts my lifestyle and can trench my thinking how am I reacting to that do I humble myself am I able do I have the ability to humble myself and say Lord I humble myself to the word of God render myself to the world or is there something in me that raises up against that and thinks I don't like that too much and if we're not careful we become disclippers of the Bible and we like this part but this part we just clip that out flip I don't like that part over there you might not physically clip it out but I promise you you'll ignore those scriptures you do the same exact thing people do the same thing with the message of the hour that's just the opinion of brother Bannerman I don't really think you know brother man I yeah that was an opinion over here in opinion listen friends it's time we start questioning the word of God and start believing the word of God let me just say this until you believe the word of the hour it can't do you any good anyways if you hold it with a 10-foot pole and question a part over here and question a part over there it can't do you any good Jesus said he that cometh to me must first believe that I am amen [Music] that's the truth brother Matt amen though turn their hearts and Chase mirages listen what he says here but you keep your eye on what you're doing except the hard times along with the good isn't this amazing this is actually what the message translation says from Eugene Peterson keep the message alive praise God do a thorough job as God's what is truth can we go a little bit further is everybody's still here tonight what is truth for the man let me just say if you want victory in your life you have to identify the truth from the lies because all the while the devil is speaking all the while the truth is speaking the devil's speaking right there with it and the devil will be on one side trying to cause you to reason and rationalize and let me say this our in reality your scope of knowledge I don't care what subject it is is very limited I don't care how academically you acquire it all you see is what you can see and what you understand and let me say that if all we see is what we see we really don't see all there is to be seen since this is a spiritual battle it's an invisible War go through our PowerPoint if you could brother Matt brother uh the brother there in the back who's ever controlling that I just want to come to something here and then we'll close Pilots therefore this is John 18 verse 37. pilate therefore said unto him art thou a king then Jesus answered thou sayest that I am a king to the Ascend would to this end was I born and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness of the unto the truth everyone that uh everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice so this is a question that philosophers and researchers and Men even today ask the same question I haven't been asking for centuries the same question pilate asks it's the same question what is real what am I what is this do I just think that I'm here am I actually here is this really taking place what is real brother man what is what is this the same question we ask about religion because our religion claims that there's only one God another religion claims that there's 30 million gods so which one's right another one claims there's no God at all you see the LIE right mixed in with the truth of the devil oh boy it's quiet in here that's all right the real question is not what we believe the real question it doesn't matter listen it's not what you think or what you rationalize as pilate had this skepticism that many people would have today to say what is truth how do you know how do you find out how can you know the answer to pilate's question was standing ten feet in front of him because Jesus said I am aha so truth is a person I said truth is a person he's the person of Jesus Christ oh listen to me friends uh you you want to talk about some of these things that we face today the first is this rationalism I want you to skip on down if you could to the slide that says what is truth you know if you would have asked the apostles and the days of Jesus and if we could come there and somehow use a time machine and travel back in time and be there in the book of Acts and you were to ask any of the Apostles and you were to ask that simple question that's asked today and you were to say what is uh the truth they would have one simple answer this is truth well anyways I believe it I hope somebody online believes it too come on can I get an amen here anybody here y'all still awake if you would ask them they would say God's word is truth because no one questioned what the word of God was no one questioned what truth was because they knew truth was a person it was in the Reformation that people rose up and said truth isn't what the church says it is but truth is the word this is rationalism this is what it means but then a few hundred years ago there was a great shift in our world whether you're aware of that young people here tonight there was a great shift in our world of what truth was we call this the enlightenment I think it's more of an indarkenment but the enlightenment it was the shift was truth is no longer what God tells us it is but it's what we find out for ourself to put it simply human reasoning has replaced divine revelation you can no longer accept what the word teaches but you thought of it you think of it for yourself you use your own critical thinking you use your own rationale or let me say what others say you just use common sense God gave us common sense and Common Sense will lead us to the truth truth is what I think it is let me say that's the heart of rationalism it makes man his own God whether he would ever admit that listen you think a lying demon Spirit would ever tell that man that you're your own God no no no he would hide that from that man but let me say the worst Spirit and the most binding Spirit you could ever get is a religious spirit and it's so blinding to the person that don't realize they've exalted what they think it makes man his own God because now he can discover Truth for himself he didn't need God to help him do it he can Discover it with the use of the mind and the human faculties and intellect through his own five senses which of course opened up the field to science let me say this here for a moment to young people all the original scientists most of the most of the original scientists were not atheists they believed in God come on that's the truth you can look at that historically most scientists believed in God you could look at men like Galileo and Isaac Newton and and and bacon and Copernicus these were men who believed in God they believed in a higher power but that Revelation that that rationalism led to the next ISM in our age called deism deism is simply the belief in the existence of a Supreme Being specifically of a Creator who doesn't intervene in the universe at all he's just a Creator somewhere up way up there in the in the Milky Way somewhere in the misty blue but he's not intimately acquainted nor does he care about the Affairs of mankind this term used uh chiefly I'm pulling some of this straight from uh you know some different sources so I can give you some of the sources later if you want them I just thought it was really good really powerful and so the this this rational or This deism this term is chiefly of an intellectual movement of the 17th and 18th century that accepted the existence of a Creator on the basis of reason but be rejected the belief in a supernatural deity who interacts with mankind it simply means that God created the world but he's no longer in control of the world sort of like a clock that you just wind up and God just wound up the clock of time sort of like a timer and it is put it down and it just sort of unwinds and whines and whines and wines that sort of wind itself out and eventually it'll stop and it's just wound up and you know many of these scientists believe many of these scientists even even themselves believe that God himself couldn't change the order of nature so they gave their minds over to discover the laws of nature and to become very proud in their discoveries very proud of what the human reasoning and so by reasoning we became the people in charge of our universe the same place where you go globalist and global warming and we're we're in control of our destiny and the worlds eventually they believe in a in a apocalyptic age in the end of the world in the end of time but but but but people we can control that if we just make the right changes in the right steps listen friend I don't care how much you think you can control it you can't I don't care how much you could control climate you can't control it I don't care how much you think you can control listen to me friends uh Putin is not in control of the end of the world Putin to me say he has a hand over that that button and oh my goodness if one person listen Putin's finger's not on that button I'm going to tell you whose fingers on it Jehovah Jireh that's his fingers on the button and when he says the end is the end that's when it's all over and it won't happen a day before God says that it's over can you say Amen and so this introduced the age and by reason and we become the people in charge of our universe in other words the authority of human reason took over from the authority of divine revelation and this introduced us into the age of skepticism that's prophesied in the Bible actually prophesied in the in the book of Jude prophesied in other places that that that men would creep in unawares and men who were foreign ordained of this condemnation and so people no longer would believe a thing just because they're told a thing but they want to find out for themselves that whether it appeals to their logic or whether it appeals to their rationale whether they can understand it or not all friends you sell yourself so short if you only believe in what you can understand we sell ourselves so short if we'll only let our faith reach to the border of our own understanding Peter couldn't walk on water until he stopped under believing only what he could understand he had to get out of the boat and leave his own think and stink and thinking behind and say if God said it I believe it that settles it in fact what happens notice this here it have what happens is the result of rationalism is that we become with the creation we we we worship the creation but we forget the Creator because science can tell you nothing about the Creator it can only tell you about the creation which has changed our vision from heaven to Earth do you know this is what the devil wants to get you to do to change your vision that should always be upward and get you to look downward and when Satan can get your head from looking from the things above and the things that are beyond your own understanding it can get you down to look at only what you see in the here and now he's really got you then and this great shift in humanity moved from there and it moved from divine revelation to human reasoning I can't understand it so it must not be true or you've got to explain that to me before I can believe that it's true the reaction of rationalism is what's called a movement of Romanticism it's called the romantic era and Romanticism it was an artistic uh literary Musical and it was an intellectual movement but not just intellectual it was started to stir the intellect and move into the emotional Realm and it originated in Europe towards the end of the 18th century in most areas it was at its peak and maybe around 1800 to 1850 and some of the main characteristics of romantic literature they include a focus on the writer or the narrator's emotions and inner world and it's the celebration of Nature and beauty and Imagination the rejection of into of organized religion and rationalism and social convention it's as humans aren't just thinking creatures they're also feeling creatures and so I'm not going to believe it unless I feel it okay you see some people only believe it if they understand it others believe it only it's only true if I can feel it and so it says humans they're they're in reality they they need to music should be felt and it should art should be felt and what is true is what I feel is true and so there came not just a desire for a scientific explanation of things but a desire to experience things because people want to feel something they don't feel it's re they don't feel it's real unless they felt it hello that's even sometimes the test some people apply to worship well only if I feel that I'm really worshiping you know friends some of the most powerful worship you could ever do is when you don't feel like it at all when you feel complete a million miles away from God but something in you raises your hands anyways and you clap your hands anyways sometimes you don't want to say Amen to the word of God but just say Amen anyways sometimes God could do more out of that kind of Praise than he could ever do out of an emotional feel a worked up praise but it comes from the very inner core of your being and you say God you're worthy of my praise whether I can feel you or not you're worthy of my adoration whether I consent you or not because what is true is it's only what I feel it hasn't been good a good church service unless we felt it well sometimes you do feel it just sometimes you don't feel good sometimes you leave church and you feel bad because you feel convicted you feel beat up you know sometimes the word of God does that to us and we ought to be able to receive it as children when the word of God comes for correction that's just as powerful as when it comes for encouragement foreign and so Romanticism said I've got to fill it so you had the cold clinical academic intellectual rationalism which led to the field of science and then we had Romanticism which led to the field of arts and painting and music and these were to help us fill our reality of what was around us and so people look to the world around us and they want to feel it they want to they want to absorb it we need to feel the music and and it's powerful it's true music touches you at a very emotional level rather than an intellectual level and and it's just like artwork as we were saying on on Saturday night you know Modern Art uh uh you should I've even heard it said you can't understand Modern Art and if you misunderstand it that's when you've understood it I said that you know to someone and they were they was at their house and they had a painting and I was sitting there going brother can I be honest with you I don't get it and he said that means you got it okay if you don't get it that means you understand it all right I guess I got it then you keep it but what it's saying is is that the world doesn't make sense and I look at it and it's crazy and it's nonsensical and the world doesn't make sense and you don't have to understand you don't have to understand it because you can feel it so you have these approaches these are all the approaches to what is truth rationalism says truth is what I can learn or understand Romanticism says it's what I can feel then Jesus steps and walks right through the middle of both of them and says no I am the truth I am the way I am the person and I contradict both of these the only truth is and revealed in one person and it's not what you understand and it's not necessarily what you feel it's what Revelation says of the word of God of who he said that he was and something inside of me that goes beyond my feeling and goes beyond my intellect says amen Lord I believe the word of God yes Lord I can't explain it I might not feel it but I know it's true I know that I know that I know that it's true because I know the person of Truth when Jesus comes to Peter and he comes to Andrew and here's these fishermen fishing and they're casting their Nets on the water the Bible doesn't say hey hey you know Jesus walked up to these guys and said hey uh hey uh excuse me uh excuse me sorry not to bother you and Peter sort of looked over there you know well he wasn't doing this I guess he was more doing this with his net you know hey guys uh I I sorry to bother you and and what what do you got to say bud what's on your mind well I just want to I want to show you if I could show you this scroll over here uh you know could you just take a minute just to read it just hear from look over here in Isaiah I want you to read over here in the book of Isaiah you see all it says over here that behold the uh you know a prince of peace a governor a child shall be born and and he'll be the prince of he'll be the prince of peace and the government will be upon his shoulders and you'll see how yeah I see that Jesus yeah yeah I see all that over there yeah you know over here Jeremiah and even David begins to prophesy can you turn to the psalm Jesus pulls out a scroll of the psalm and starts to get him to read the Simon and then Jesus says you see it now look over here if I compare Isaiah and then I compare Jeremiah and then you bring the psalm over here or where David said this and and then Isaiah said this guys guys do you see it do you do you see it it's me it's me and then Peter it goes yeah you know maybe maybe that might you know what let me get back to you let me go home and pull out my my book of the law and let me begin to study it and I'm gonna I think if I read me you know me you know me does the bible say that that's how Jesus revealed himself to his children no the Bible says he simply spoke their names and said come follow me and the Bible says immediately they dropped their Nets they left everything that they thought before and they followed Jesus why my sheep know my voice and a stranger they will not follow I said my sheep know my voice and a stranger they will not follow because when truth revealed to you no devil can take it from you no devil not an opinion not of what somebody thinks but brother Branham says it's got to be in something that's revealed to you something that transforms you something that changes your very nature something that takes you from the creature that you were and you can say I may not be what I ought to be but I know I ain't what I used to be I know there's been a real change down inside of my heart because I met the person of Truth God transform us today by your power this is slide four by the renewing of her mind to turn from the meager elements of this world now unto the word of God and may we be renewed by the transforming power oh how many want to raise a hand and say Lord that's my prayer let me be renewed by transforming power upon the seed that's in our heart that we believe under creatures called Sons and Daughters of God this is my prayer to you father for the people in Jesus name amen listen to what he says now to you that's out in the broadcast wherever you are I want you to receive Christ out there as your personal savior and stop there come on somebody help me preach receive him as your personal Savior and stop there oh no brother in fact if you stop there you're in one of the most dangerous places you can ever be because God didn't just want you to accept him to be justified and just accept him and say I accept Jesus in my heart and what does that mean I've repeated a sinner's prayer and you know what you do you get a person the Bible says one of the most dangerous places you can be is cleaned but empty one of the most dangerous places you can be it's cleaned but empty that's why even in the book of uh of Matthew and the Bible speaks of a Matthew chapter 12 it says when an unclean spirit is gone out of a man he goes through Dry places seeking rest and when he findeth cometh back and he findeth none he finds a house that's clean swept clean sanctified but nobody in the house oh friends what we need more than ever before is not just a cleaning we need a filling of the baptism of the Holy Ghost something that's more than a Doctrine something that's more than an emotion something that's more than just an intellectual understanding but that thing that comes on the inside and changes your very nature I want you to accept him receive him as your personal Savior and be filled with his spirit that's the only way you'll ever know truth be filled with his Spirit the words that's been said this morning I'm closing as brother Diggs says don't get scared I'm about to close may they drop into your heart and may there you receive Jesus and you watch your life and you see what you live afterwards not what you might receive initially that's a wonderful thing but watch what fruit it produces in your life if you think you've received truth and it produces corruption you've never received truth watch what you live afterwards and take the thinking man's filter you see yourself doing something that's contrary to this word move from it right quick because there's a filter that keeps death away from you and that's God's words his words are life and they will keep you from death what we need to convince them then concern 1962 what we need is a candle lighting time the power of the Holy Ghost instead of so much of this man-made Dogma theological training I'm convinced that's what the people needs whether he knows his ABCs or not whether he knows beans from split coffee if he will just let that candle get lit God will take care of the rest of it you say what do I got to do brother Matt just let that candle get lit God will take care of the rest of it what do I got to do to know the Lord just let that candle get lit say God I want to get my candle lit here tonight I want to be filled with all the fullness of God that I may know him as Paul said in the power of his resurrection and then God will take care of the rest of it friend God will take care of the rest of the blind man that Jesus healed he couldn't argue them pre-theology they come up all them preached around and said you know here's Dr so and so you belong to a certain church he couldn't argue their theology they said well we know this man's a sinner we know he is he don't who are they calling a sinner Jesus we know this man's a sinner he don't agree with our teaching what does he do he deceives our people he leads them astray we know he's a sinner brother he couldn't argue theology but he was sure convinced he could see I said he couldn't argue theology but he was sure convinced where once he was blind now he can see I may not have all the answers I may not have all the questions right I may not be able to line it all up and cross all my T's and Dot all my eyes but here's what I know that I know that I know I was once blind but now I see I say thank God that God has given me eyes to see ears to understand ears to hear the word of God I say I'll trade it for any education I'll trade it for any college degree it's more important than anything you could ever do in your life young person it's greater than any degree that you can get to know him is life not to know his word to know him and the power of his resurrection musicians could you come brother random says he couldn't argue theology but he was sure convinced he could see I think that's the main thing today I can't tell you where I ought to be and whether you have to be this or be that but we're certainly convinced that we got something oh Hallelujah amen Lord I'm so convinced I may not be able to understand it all but here's what I know you say brother Matt what do you know I know I'm not who I used to be I know something's got a hold of my life and it won't let me go I know something changed my nature it changed my desires it changed what I was thirsting for it's a real Risen Savior how many Believers can identify and say it's real it really happened to me the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's a real thing that you can receive and it changes everything in your life like the old color lady said brother I I want to give a testimony said I hate what I ought to be and I ain't what I you what I want to be but she said one thing I sure know I ain't what I used to be I think that's good I'm not what I want to be I'm not what I ought to be how many Believers would stand young person and raise your hand and say I I come on stand to your feet and say I'm not what I ought to be but here's what I know I ain't what I used to be at least my candles oh Lord Jesus we bow our heads here before you today God in total reverence and total obedience wanting to be obedient to your word Lord more than anything else oh God I pray that you would give us a heart that could say Lord I may not understand it in fact I may not even feel it but I believe it with all that's within me I believe the word of God I may not be able to always live it I may not be always able to line up to it in fact I've got a life that's full of faults and full of failures and and I don't always do what's right but here's what I know Lord down inside the inside of my innermost being I've got a desire to say Lord I want to serve you I want to throw aside my thinking I want to throw aside what I think and what I thought maybe even as Paul said I forget everything that I've learned to know Jesus I want to say tonight Lord I love you with all of my heart I want to serve you with all of my heart Lord I want to be obedient to the word that's been revealed in this end time [Music] do you know that's a powerful thing if you can really do that tonight and you can really by faith I'm not talking about a workup or just because a preacher said it but if you can really by faith say Lord I want to come subject to the Vindicated word of the hour that's been revealed in this end time I don't want to question it I don't want to doubt it I don't want to look out I don't just want to wonder about it God but I want to get in it I want to get under it I want that token to be applied to My Heart All Hands going up everywhere God bless you for those hands to say Lord I want to surrender myself I want to throw aside all of my thinking I want to throw it on us outside all my rationalism all my understanding all of my emotionalism everything that I felt previous everything that I I've learned before I always want to say God I want to make sure that I'm I'm subservient I'm humbled to the word I want the word of God I want the truth I want the whole truth and nothing but the truth I want the truth how many hands would raise up and say I
