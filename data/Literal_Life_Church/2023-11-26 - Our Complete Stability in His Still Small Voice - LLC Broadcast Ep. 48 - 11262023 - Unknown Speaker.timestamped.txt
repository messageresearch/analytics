[2:52] [Music]
[2:55] eyes he slips into a p

[3:33] broken for
[3:36] [Music]

[4:19] common
[4:24] cup we
[4:28] remember and we live lift
[4:31] it
[4:34] [Music]
[4:37] up this is my
[4:41] body
[4:43] broken just for
[4:49] you for all you've
[4:54] been and all you've been
[4:58] through
[5:01] this is my
[5:04] blood and when you reach the

[5:15] again the
[5:18] body and
[5:20] [Music]
[5:22] blood this is my
[5:26] blood and when you you've reach the
[5:33] end I offer you
[5:38] again the
[5:41] body
[5:44] and
[5:50] [Music]
[5:54] blood First Kings 19 and we'll start
[5:57] reading at verse 9 we're picking up for
[5:59] Elijah here in the third phase of how
[6:02] the Lord dealt with him here and he came
[6:04] thither thither unto a cave and lodged
[6:07] there and behold the word of the Lord
[6:10] came to him and he said unto him what
[6:12] doest thou here Elijah and he said I
[6:15] have been very jealous for the Lord God
[6:17] of hosts for the children of Israel have
[6:19] forsaken thy Covenant thrown down thine
[6:21] altars and slain thy prophets with the
[6:24] sword and I even I only am left and they
[6:27] seek my life to take it and he said go
[6:30] forth and stand upon the mount before
[6:33] the Lord and behold the Lord passed by
[6:36] and a great and strong wind rent the
[6:40] mountains and break in pieces the Rocks
[6:43] before the Lord but the Lord was not in
[6:46] the wind and after the wind an
[6:49] earthquake but the Lord was not in the
[6:52] earthquake now this is extremely
[6:55] important what's being said here because
[6:57] God is going to show what he is going to
[7:00] be
[7:02] in and he's also going to show what he's
[7:05] not
[7:06] in that's important especially when you
[7:09] have people who are thirsty to find God
[7:13] and thirsty to find more of God they're
[7:15] in a vulnerable state because we must
[7:17] not just seek it anywhere but we must
[7:19] find what God is in and what he's
[7:21] speaking
[7:23] through we could be very deceived into
[7:25] thinking God is in something but he must
[7:28] make it clear to the prophet here where
[7:30] God is in where God is in and he said he
[7:32] wasn't in the wind he was not in the
[7:34] earthquake and after the earthquake a
[7:36] fire all these real extravagant uh
[7:40] flamboyant things very extreme things
[7:43] but he's making it clear uh I'm not in
[7:45] any of those and after the earthquake a
[7:47] fire but the Lord was not in the fire
[7:51] and after the fire a still Small Voice
[7:55] and I can finish it and God is saying
[7:57] that's where you'll find me
[8:01] that's where you'll find me strange
[8:03] isn't it we look for big things but God
[8:05] says at the end this is where you're
[8:07] going to find me but just the capping
[8:09] off that I didn't get to last Sunday of
[8:11] this subject and we'll see where the
[8:13] Lord will leave from here but we want to
[8:15] finish this and last week I had preached
[8:17] on the cure for emotional and mental
[8:21] instability I know that seems like a
[8:23] strange title but uh it's very important
[8:26] under the the current uh climate of the
[8:30] hour God has chosen us to live in uh
[8:33] it's very important to talk about
[8:35] emotional
[8:36] instability and mental instability you
[8:39] say well why do I need to preach to
[8:41] Believers about that well uh we're the
[8:44] only ones I believe that we have a place
[8:46] that we can go to bring any instability
[8:49] can you say Amen we're the ones that
[8:52] have a place to go praise the Lord
[8:54] aren't you glad you raise your hand this
[8:55] morning we have a place to go for all of
[8:57] that and that's what I'm trying to point
[8:59] you to but to say we don't need to talk
[9:01] about it well that would be denying us
[9:03] as a human being because we are affected
[9:06] emotionally by things we are affected
[9:08] sometimes mentally by things but God has
[9:11] promised in his word that he'll give us
[9:13] uh mental stability he says I wish above
[9:16] all things you prosper and be in health
[9:18] as your soul prospers and that he would
[9:20] give you a sound
[9:23] mind he would give us a sound mind and
[9:26] so uh Calvary did not just provide a
[9:29] saving of of from sin but it also
[9:32] provided all things that we need to
[9:34] bring to him and so now in the age that
[9:37] we live in and I I elaborated on it last
[9:39] Sunday so I don't need to talk about but
[9:41] we explored a little bit of the cultural
[9:43] plague of addiction the cultural plague
[9:46] of addiction how many knows that we're
[9:47] in an age of
[9:48] addiction and and the addiction is
[9:51] usually from a lack of the reality of
[9:53] God in man's Soul people people are
[9:56] turning to addictions and come to that
[9:58] because they don't have God they don't
[9:59] have the availability or at least
[10:01] they're not seeking God because God is
[10:04] the source for our soul God is the
[10:06] source for our
[10:07] emotions and and so now we have a whole
[10:10] uh nation and World addicted uh by many
[10:14] many things they're addicted to and it's
[10:16] because that they have not turned to the
[10:19] to the answer that God has given and uh
[10:22] there's no sense in preaching about
[10:23] other people but sometimes Christians in
[10:26] a hard time in their life don't turn to
[10:28] the answer that they know is the answer
[10:30] they'll turn to other things to calm
[10:33] their nerves they'll turn to other
[10:34] things to kind of settle them down and
[10:37] they go through mental times as I read
[10:39] last Sunday about Elijah when he was
[10:40] under the juniper tree he was going
[10:42] through a real mental strain he was
[10:44] going through a depression so let's not
[10:46] deny who we are we can have juniper
[10:49] trees in our lives we can have low times
[10:51] in our lives and uh and so this is a
[10:55] reality in the hour we live in and I
[10:56] won't speak uh much more on those things
[10:59] because we we covered it last Sunday but
[11:02] we realize there's a thirst because we
[11:04] are a three-part being and because we
[11:07] are emotional because we have our minds
[11:09] and not just our souls but we have our
[11:12] emotions that there are things that
[11:14] deplete us in our spirit uh sort of if
[11:17] we could call it this way constant
[11:19] withdrawals from our emotional bank
[11:22] accounts and we live in a world that
[11:24] constantly drains
[11:26] us emotionally drains us mentally can
[11:30] you say amen and I mentioned three
[11:33] things that causes that and that is it
[11:35] can be family or domestic
[11:38] trouble uh it can be number two a severe
[11:41] trauma that's happened in your life you
[11:43] lose a loved one or you have something
[11:46] happen or someone treats you in a wrong
[11:48] way there's some trauma that happens to
[11:50] your spirit that's the second reason
[11:52] sometimes your spirit gets there's a
[11:55] withdrawal from your emotional bank and
[11:57] then there's family and domestic trouble
[11:58] well that's number one but then there's
[12:00] the third thing of the Demonic forces
[12:02] just in the next Dimension that is an
[12:05] increased pressure against the Bride of
[12:07] Jesus Christ every day in the other
[12:10] dimension there is forces against you as
[12:13] a son and daughter of God that that are
[12:15] always trying to and I'm going to get to
[12:17] it today always trying to Mis mislead
[12:21] you or pull you away from or cause you
[12:23] to lose the value of the fountain and
[12:26] the source for emotional stability to
[12:29] turn you to something else to accuse the
[12:32] Brethren can you say Amen most of the
[12:34] Christians that's in this room and
[12:36] Believers understand the battle that you
[12:38] face and it doesn't get any lighter it's
[12:41] stronger demonic forces are against the
[12:44] Bride of Jesus Christ to drain you try
[12:47] to drain you spiritually and even though
[12:49] your soul would be sealed into the
[12:52] kingdom of God Satan with what he's left
[12:55] to try to drain you emotionally to drain
[12:57] you mentally to to drain you spiritually
[13:00] can you say
[13:02] amen and and then we get weak and and
[13:05] then when we get weak we're emotionally
[13:08] uh uh just instable sometimes but the
[13:11] worst part of it is is when we turn to
[13:13] hundreds of other remedies for this
[13:16] instability that we
[13:20] feel the worst part of it is is we turn
[13:22] to other things to calm our nerves
[13:25] sometimes and there can be even within
[13:27] the circle of Believers and I could talk
[13:29] about many things I did last Sunday
[13:31] about things we even would turn to
[13:33] sometimes but we must be careful even
[13:35] something that is wholesome we must be
[13:37] careful that there's not a replacement
[13:40] in our lives for the true stability
[13:43] that's in the word of God my theme today
[13:45] is he's provided a voice within his word
[13:48] and that still Small Voice is our full
[13:51] stability in our lives that voice that
[13:54] word is our stability for emotional pain
[13:57] that word provides Ides all things
[13:59] needed for for mentally not feeling
[14:01] right can you say am man and so there's
[14:04] a place that God has given no matter
[14:06] what we've gone through and then and
[14:09] then I didn't get a lot of time on it
[14:10] last Sunday but within the circle of
[14:12] Believers there's one sometimes that
[14:14] will seek signs and they will seek
[14:16] Miracles and they will seek wonders and
[14:19] they will seek emotional highs to try to
[14:22] satisy their nervousness and
[14:26] instability I didn't figure I'd get too
[14:28] many amens on that one right there but
[14:31] you might as well talk about it is that
[14:33] people will turn to some emotional
[14:36] High even in a service and think that's
[14:40] the final answer but I've been serving
[14:42] the lord long enough to know that I can
[14:44] be in the greatest Sunday services and
[14:46] the greatest conventions can you say
[14:48] amen and feel so good can you say Amen
[14:51] but when I go home the question is is
[14:54] did he bring stability in your life to
[14:56] face the enemy the next day
[15:00] if it doesn't bring stability and
[15:02] emotional stability then we realize that
[15:04] it stays shallow it stays a bubble dance
[15:07] Christians in this hour cannot live on
[15:09] casual bubble dances with the Lord our
[15:12] experience has to be deep with the Lord
[15:15] our our River has to run deep can you
[15:17] say amen and I believe God is calling us
[15:20] to be a stable people a faithful
[15:24] people that we found the source in God
[15:27] to bring emotional stability mental
[15:30] stability can you say am man We crave
[15:32] the approval of others to be
[15:33] acknowledged you know I could go on all
[15:35] day talking about the emotional
[15:37] sometimes we meet it because we're
[15:38] thinking we're getting something
[15:39] spiritual but sometimes we're so
[15:41] obsessed with with image and appearance
[15:43] before others people in the
[15:46] message all this is try to fill a void
[15:49] of some somehow emotional void and
[15:52] sometimes the person has to have a
[15:55] position in a church or they'll just
[15:57] leave
[16:00] they have to be
[16:02] seen but you see you should never take a
[16:05] gift and you should never try to be seen
[16:08] to fill an emotional void in your life
[16:11] am I speaking the truth this morning I
[16:13] know this is right down where we're
[16:15] living but we've got to grow into stable
[16:17] people can you say Amen we can't lean to
[16:20] the approval of others and we can't live
[16:22] on our appearance if I can just keep my
[16:24] appearance in right in front of
[16:26] everybody then that feels no we must
[16:28] fill it with God's approval and God's
[16:31] love in our
[16:34] lives because I guarantee you if you
[16:36] keep trying to fill it with other things
[16:38] from Hollywood movies all the way to the
[16:40] approval of preachers if you're trying
[16:42] to fill some need in your life you will
[16:44] be
[16:45] disappointed that's Satan's kingdom can
[16:47] you say Amen every alternative he has is
[16:51] a
[16:52] disappointment but in God there's no
[16:54] disappointment there's only
[16:57] satisfaction
[16:59] there's only satisfaction and may may
[17:01] look sometimes it may look sometimes
[17:03] like God he didn't answer oh it didn't
[17:06] it may look like God's disappointed but
[17:08] God never disappoints
[17:10] us God will never disappoint you God
[17:14] will fill your needs can you say
[17:16] amen God will establish you God will
[17:20] stabilize you God will even you out can
[17:23] you say
[17:25] amen God can take whatever you brought
[17:28] to church this morning and God can give
[17:30] you a stable peaceful mind and heart to
[17:33] say Satan I'm going through this by the
[17:36] grace of
[17:38] God
[17:40] hallelujah when we find all of it we're
[17:44] not we are not here to fill our thirst
[17:47] for stability with all this with
[17:49] something else but we'll find all of it
[17:51] in the Lord in his voice and that's my
[17:53] theme so now I believe God's calling us
[17:56] to be a stable people to Express
[17:58] stability and consistency in an
[18:00] inconsistent
[18:02] World confidence the Bible says in
[18:05] Proverbs metal not with those people who
[18:07] are given to
[18:09] change don't Fellowship a lot with
[18:12] people that are given to
[18:14] change in other words from one week to
[18:17] the next you don't know where they
[18:20] stand you look at their post it's like
[18:23] one week they're posting something
[18:25] that's completely contrary to a
[18:27] Christian testimony
[18:29] and the next week they're quoting a
[18:30] scripture as if they're so close to God
[18:33] it's an age of instability don't meddle
[18:36] with them that are given to change and
[18:39] instability don't depend on the
[18:41] government don't depend on anybody else
[18:43] can you say m find your stability in the
[18:46] word of God and in his
[18:49] voice I believe it's a people that God
[18:51] is Raising to be confident not
[18:55] arrogant but
[18:57] confident
[18:59] now I'll say this when you're not a
[19:00] sinner because you get nervous sometimes
[19:02] you're a human being you're not a sinner
[19:05] because you get anger
[19:07] angry just be angry and sin not God made
[19:11] us who we are we get angry it's an
[19:13] emotion we we we get nervous we have
[19:16] nerves God put them in our body we just
[19:18] got to find something to keep them calm
[19:19] we got to find the Lord but we will get
[19:22] nervous Elijah got nervous we can't deny
[19:26] how God made us but it's what we choose
[19:29] temporal things constantly and I'm
[19:31] speaking to the social media generation
[19:34] I'm speaking to all of us who have
[19:36] millions of alternatives to calm our
[19:38] nerves excuse me from medicine all the
[19:41] way to the entertainments of the
[19:44] world we're in we're in Satan's Eden
[19:47] here and if I could describe it he's the
[19:49] God of this world and because he's the
[19:51] God of this world he presents things to
[19:55] Believers even that would be an
[19:57] alternative to calm our nerves and I'm
[20:00] not against any of it as I said last
[20:02] Sunday I'm not against if a medicine is
[20:04] helping we give God glory but give God
[20:07] glory and don't ever think that's your
[20:09] ultimate
[20:11] end God helps you through that then say
[20:14] I give God glory he's helping me because
[20:16] he heals through
[20:17] medicine he heals through music he heals
[20:20] through a little bit of love he heals
[20:22] through a little bit of caring for
[20:23] somebody don't you put in a box how God
[20:26] heals it's not just a healing life
[20:28] it's just not a healing God's bigger
[20:30] than that God can heal you right now
[20:33] while I'm ministering this word you're
[20:35] not a sinner because you get nervous but
[20:36] it's when we choose temporal things
[20:38] constantly and we never stabilize into a
[20:40] more faithful consistent walk with God
[20:43] how many want raise your hand I want a
[20:45] consistent walk with God I want a
[20:46] relationship with him that doesn't go
[20:49] from c meeting to c
[20:52] meeting consistency can you say amen God
[20:55] has called you for something more can
[20:57] you say Amen
[20:59] that's right it reminds me of the the
[21:01] pilot was in a one seat plane and he was
[21:04] going and flying at a certain level and
[21:06] he hears something in the back and he
[21:07] looks at the back and there's this
[21:09] little mouse in the back just chitter
[21:11] chattering and the mouse actually as he
[21:13] was flying and he only had one seat
[21:15] there he couldn't get back to the mouse
[21:17] he just starts to eat at some of the
[21:19] wiring that's running the plane he's
[21:21] eating it and he's he's going at and so
[21:23] this guy starts to sweat and get nervous
[21:25] he's wondering what am I going to do now
[21:27] I can't get to that m and if he keeps
[21:29] eating of this we're going
[21:31] down and he thought and I thought and
[21:33] that thing is still eating at those
[21:35] wires and all of a sudden he has this
[21:37] thought hey I can fly higher than that
[21:42] Mouse I'm built to fly
[21:45] higher than any little creature like
[21:48] that can I get an amen you know what he
[21:51] did he just went way up high until he
[21:54] seen that Mouse just disintegrate and
[21:55] fall over
[21:57] dead I'm here to tell you this morning
[21:59] as a Believer you're not called to live
[22:01] like the rest of the world you're not
[22:03] called to addictions you're not called
[22:06] to any addiction you need to fly higher
[22:09] than
[22:12] that God's called you to something
[22:15] higher not because you deserve it but
[22:17] because he gave it to
[22:19] you say you're talking about everybody
[22:21] else in this room I'm sorry brother and
[22:23] sister I'm not talking about everybody
[22:24] else in this room I'm talking about
[22:26] you
[22:29] you're called to something higher
[22:31] loneliness and feeling
[22:33] alone is so prevalent
[22:37] today especially in our
[22:41] teenagers can I say something about it
[22:43] it's not in my notes but can I say the
[22:45] devil taking our teenagers in their
[22:48] loneliness and telling them lies in
[22:51] their minds you don't have a friend in
[22:53] the world you're a part of something

[24:03] because we have an enemy that I'm facing
[24:05] even this morning in this service that
[24:07] is distracting the young people and
[24:09] distracting even bride members to cause
[24:12] us to lose value of where God is in the
[24:14] still Small Voice to cause us to fill
[24:17] our lives and make it busy to we don't
[24:19] have time we don't sit still amen and
[24:23] shut out all the noise so we can hear
[24:27] this still Small
[24:30] Voice every young person every person

[25:18] 21 he says there will be distress of
[25:20] Nations there will be men's Hearts
[25:22] failing for fear there'll be wars and
[25:24] rumors of wars there'll be all this
[25:26] distress all this pressure come on you
[25:28] and Jesus describes our age perfectly
[25:31] and then he says Heaven and Earth will
[25:33] pass away he says you'll watch
[25:36] everything pass away you watch
