bro [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] Godly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper I'd like to read verse 1 again but because that's probably what I'll mostly get to tonight blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful so I I just want to speak a little bit tonight about walking sitting and standing in the wrong places walking and sitting and standing in the wrong places you don't want to be standing or sitting or walking in the wrong places but you want to be positioned in your position in the times we're living in now walking and sitting and standing in the wrong places and I'm going to make this just as simple as possible tonight and uh and go back into this a little bit and I'm just rehearsing a little bit from Sunday but we'll just elaborate a little bit more because uh Sunday we talked about out of perfect Faith the believer's position and what perfect faith is and how we get into that Jesus was in perfect Faith because he knew who he was he had the confidence not human confidence but a real confidence in his position and who he was in God and what he was there to do what his purpose was on Earth and when we begin to have a revelation of that that it creates confidence and Faith love was another thing love works in coordination with faith and when we know how much God loves us truly loves us then our love reaches back to him and our love for one another and this creates this atmosphere of perfect faith and Reliance and confidence that we're not so susceptible to all the fears of this world and the anxiety that's of this world you're not a sinner because you have anxiety today but we have to be reminded there is a resting place for our souls our minds our Spirits we have a resting place tonight and if we'll learn as a Christian how to move ourselves out of the nervousness of the world and into that position of perfect faith and try to even learn to stay in there every day how many raise your hand I'd like to stay in there all every hour that's all of our challenge but we have so many things to try to pull us out of it but we've got to learn that nobody else is interested in this except Believers no the message didn't come to everybody but except to Believers that perfect faith is for believers nobody else wants that kind of life but we want it and so now we have to learn and be and move into an adoption maturity that we recognize the devil in every one of his tricks we recognize the fear of the world we recognize what triggers us what makes us upset what makes us unhappy what draws us down as soon as we begin to notice it we can quickly change our thoughts and say no no we're not going there I'm staying right here in this at realm of perfect Faith amen and so this is something we learn it doesn't happen overnight I don't believe that a Believer I believe a Believer has everything he needs when he gets the Holy Ghost to be able to overcome but I don't believe he knows how to overcome overnight I believe we learned this I'm I'm 55 years old and I've been serving the lord for 30 something years and I'll tell you I'm still learning every day I read my devotional the last three or four days that I gave as a gift and we had and I'll tell you I'm inspired by the word of God it encourages me can you say amen and I learn things every day from him so I'm like a child when it comes to the word and I just think I'm thankful that we can be teachable can you say Amen we're growing into a life of perfect faith and so now why is this man in Psalms 1 why is he so blessed and and favored by God because he said blessed is the man he's blessed he's favored he's thriving and he's prospering because it ends saying because he's planted in the right place everything he touches prospers everything he does prosper and so why why is these this way the the simplest answer is he's living this way because it is where he has positioned himself self because it says he plants himself besides the rivers of water so it's all about positioning it's all about where you plant yourself spiritually I know where you're planted tonight uh physically some of you are here in uh Petersburg some are in your homes somewhere on the couch uh I'm having to stand tonight you're on your couch but anyway I know where you're planted tonight every in every other place but I'm talking about spiritually where are you planted because where your position and how your thought life is and how you think every day that's the position that shows whether you're going to live a thriving spiritual life and we have to stay there we have to work we have to walk in that place and so it's where this man positions himself and it's in that world of perfect faith that Jesus talked about I read it on Sunday that Jesus lived in it he lived in a realm of perfect Faith uh the Devil Couldn't get to him there and it's a place that it was a world to himself that nobody else knew anything about and incidentally how many knows that Jesus said that where I am they may be also everywhere that Jesus goes he's bringing the rest of the brother and Brethren with him he's the firstborn among many brother he says he's leading many into victory in other words it's not just Jesus that goes there but wherever Jesus goes he's bringing every son and daughter of God with him and if he lived in perfect Faith now it's time for us to live in perfect Faith it's not that we're not going to be physically sick it's not that we're going to have not gonna have trials we're not going to get sicknesses cancers uh deaths all these things to deal with can't promise that whatsoever but I can promise you from the word of God he gave us an escape he gave us a promise he gave us a place to live that perfect Faith Can Master every circumstances and he can give you things that you know that you can control because there are things you can't control but I can tell you there are things the believer controls through the faith of God amen I told someone the other day you you know you can't you can't control what happens on the outside but you can control your thought life there's a lot of people who's giving up if thoughts are bombarding me and so I have no control no no you do have control the Bible talks about it you have control to redirect your thought life so you ought to take that as a victory tonight to say Satan can only go so far because there's a domain of my thought life that I can be in control by the Holy Spirit I can redirect my thoughts and he wants us to do that so he lived in a realm perfect a perfect Faith perfect Faith Masters every circumstance and so it's about your spiritual position it's it and when it uses the words the man that walketh not in the Council of the ungodies standeth in the way of Sinner sinneth all these words sinneth standeth walketh are all about position I know that's real that's as simple as dirt sitting standing walking is all about position and we think of it physically but he's speaking about a spiritual all these positions that we're in and place ourselves and expose ourselves to it can be the right thing or it can be the wrong thing and this this brother as an example this Godly blessed man is chosen to position himself not in these positions of standing and and sitting amongst the scornful or standing and watching The Way of the Sinners or or walking with the Council of the ungodly he distanced himself from that he intentionally positions himself spiritually that he's not going to be under those influences every one of you can do that every one of you can position yourself away from those things and so swalking standing sitting that's what I want to speak on walking sitting and standing in the wrong places I want to elaborate on it tonight because this is real this is the place sometimes that we get where we don't realize spiritually people don't know where they're at but if they stand back and look and they can they can see they've positioned themselves too close to a wrong relationship too close to feeding on something that's not right that can be from something very evil on the internet to always somebody hanging around a Jonah you can position you cannot be involved in Internet dirtiness but you can be always buddy and buddy with a Jonah A backslidden or a person that's running away from the Lord and you're staying close to them maybe you're trying to help them but you're staying so close that they're actually bringing you down and the guys on the boat with Jonah eventually realize hey bud get off of my vote when they realized and Jonah realized why the storm was happening and why all these incidents which is listen bud we're giving you a kick whatever God wants to do with you but get off of my boat because you're causing storms in my life be loving be kind be gentle but don't let a Jonah continue to be so close to you that it keeps bringing you down so now if this position this place this uh positioning that he places a Christian is is away from these things you you need to kick a Joan off your boat because he's he's in a sometimes they're not backstudding but they're in a place of running from God so you're talking to him maybe you're trying to help him give a word of encouragement but if you got yourself positioned close enough to them it may influence you so it's all about positioning yourself and so we're going to get into that a little bit more tonight that that uh when you were talking about walking standing sitting that about covers it wherever we are spiritually and none of those are in the Council of the ungodly he chooses I'm not going to be around the Council of the ungodly around the path of Sinners or in the sea of scornful so the first thing in his mind is not to be open to just any influence that's around too many Believers position themselves too vulnerable and too influenced by many many voices and then wonder why they have no faith and then wonder what's going on in my life why why do I feel so defeated there doesn't seem to be enough Victory and they if they're not looking at the voices they're listening to they're not looking at where they're positioned they're not willing to pull away from something maybe they're not willing to cut maybe cut off some influences in their life they're not willing to do it and so now there's the defeat there's the thing that places you you can't live where you need to live there might need to be some real prayer to say Lord what is it that I'm positioning my life too close to in order that's keeping me weakened that I couldn't be the full potential of what I should be so the first thing he says is that this man walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly so to break this down this brother this sister has given a deaf ear to hear the advice and counsel of anyone ungodly he has chosen to give a deaf ear to advice or should I say screening the advice and counsel of everybody because everybody some most people have good intentions but not all counsel will do your life good and so this brother this sister is saying I'm not I don't want to listen to the counsel of the ungodly uh he's not going to follow the advice their advice or their example and you should know friends that in our world you can receive counsel and counseling with not even going to pay and sit on a couch with a counselor in our world and in our environment I don't know if Paul would have had to spoke about this as much as I do in his day or even back in Luther's day but in our day people are receiving counsel and advice and guidance all the time but most of it's not good so you have to sit down on a couch at a psychologist and and pay him 300 bucks an hour to get counseling every day you're getting guidance and counseling by what we read by the news we're being guided a certain way can you say Amen that the news intentionally guides a certain way and so now everybody else may swallow that everybody else may say you know I'm fine with that but but not us because listen now we had a screen the council that we get we got to watch the council that we get we got to know the source that it comes from and and we got to know what we trust can you say amen and you can get counsel of what to do and you didn't even ask for that counsel but you're getting counseled some people go and find the counselor that they want to find they only pick the people that's going to agree with them or they're only going to go visit places they can feel better about the guilt that they feel so they're going to hang around and get the advice of ones that's going to tell them what they want to do I don't think that's wisdom can you say Amen so now you can you you can get counsel of what to do and you didn't even ask for it sometimes and you can sit right in your home with your phone and receive all kinds of influence within just minutes counsel is counsel is advice given whether formal or informal so it can be a formal counsel somebody's telling you I'm going to give you some advice or it can just be informal and that means you can receive counsel but it it wouldn't be the right Council it can mean guidance it can mean Direction so you can get guidance by many things in this life and we must screen and we must be holy ghost filled to say I do not want I want to make sure that I'm not receiving the counsel of the ungodly we have to be prayerful we have to be praying we have to be guided by the word and the Holy Ghost in our lives or we will swing certain ways and not even realize that we're taking the counsel of the world or the Council of the ungodly just because it sounds right doesn't mean it's always right he gave me a hiding place to live in he gave me a hiding place he gave me an atonement and that atonement was good from Calvary all the way to 2022. if I get sick if I'm gonna die I have an atonement to go to my God I have healing in the blood of the Lamb let's not forget that though God heals through medicine God heals through different things God uses vaccines and all these other things let's not forget our atonement that God has for us we are believers we are Christians can you say Amen this word is our absolute this is what we should be clinging to this is what we salute Lord where's my guidance in the word of God you as with the Holy Ghost can be influenced by the wrong spirit amen you could ever end a spirit of anger or something you act out of place and you got to make that right right away can you say amen and you're going what's in here well strong Spirit came in the home between you and your wife or whatever and so you may have all the holy ghost in the world but sometimes you got to repent and say God I see that's the wrong Spirit that's working in me a Believer should not be living on Google for information for the decisions they make all the time not following the dating habits of the worldly shows said that Sunday don't live on the advice of people who have left the message and form their own life with what they want of the Bible don't don't be under the vice of people like that the fruits show that that's not headed in the right direction so you're not taking scriptures and advice from them they're teaching the scriptures but but watch where their life is going so that's the Council of someone that has not got the pattern of a life can you say amen and so now if this is some of the influences in your life you will never grow to more faith this uh blessed believer in Psalms 1 is not influenced by those things he don't walk in the Council of the ungodly he's not planted near the Council of the ungodly he's not opening his Spirit to just anything being said can you say Amen we better make sure the council mostly comes if not all from the Lord and a holy ghost-filled person don't underestimate someone that you know has the Holy Ghost to get advice from them don't underestimate what God can speak through them to help you and I'd rather go to a person maybe a little sister in the church sister yeah a sister she's got the Holy Ghost like a brother and your young sister should go to the sisters that show that they have the Holy Spirit in their life and ask advice we don't do that a lot today young people don't ask for advice from the older ones but I'm not just saying the older ones they have some wisdom but I'm saying I know this person has the holy spirit in their life they've proved it for years so I can trust I'd rather listen to what they have to say been through it been there done that been through their trials and there's that consistent life now just living for the Lord I ought to have my ears open to somebody like that instead of some Google or some scallywag or someone that's left the message I ought to be clinging to a holy ghost believer the next thing he does is that okay now that's the first part is that don't he doesn't he doesn't walk with walk with Council of the ungodly now he doesn't stand in the path of Sinners that's an obvious thing that we shouldn't stand in the path of sinners but standing in the path of them doesn't mean you're going down their path it means you're you're standing in the path watching them in the path they're going down you're around them you're watching what they're doing you're standing in the path not necessarily following them but just standing and watching what they do all day you're feeding on what they do and maybe how exciting their life is oh I would never do some of the things that they're doing but it's just fun just to get on and watch them in the path that they're on so you're going to stand on the path of somebody oh I'm not on the path I'm not heading that direction I'm a message believer but you stand all day on the internet and you're standing there watching the path that they're going down this believer says listen I'm not going to stand and position myself watching the path they're going on I could be watching something else so it's all day feeding on what they do and how exciting their life is how many know the Sciences if you sit there all day and listen to that stuff somebody else's life is everybody's life is more exciting than yours their vacations are better than yours your life is a miserable failure you're nothing you're sitting there in your little three-bedroom house and you'll never reach up to where they're at you'll never make a cobbler as good as that person on the internet that's what the whole thing is about and now that's where depression comes from I'll never look like them I'll never have the beauty of them I'll never this is what our world has become Christians should not be taking their cues and watching the way and the path of Sinners are going down we've got a word to look at can you say man we've got the glory of Christ Among Us God's doing things and we can be looking at something else besides the path they're going down and we can we've got another path because the Bible says that we can walk in the path in the light of the word Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path that's the path I want to be on and so this is I'm going to elaborate sitting around people who complain being around people who are critical being on the internet with somebody who's constantly critical somebody who mops all the time somebody is moping all the time now you might try to encourage a person like that and and that's great if you can do that I find with people it's hard to pull them out of that stuff and so you can give all your efforts to it but if they keep staying in there they're moping then you just say I'm gonna pray for you they got to encourage you you got to be careful how much you hang around moping critical people trying to find the fault in everything all the time because we're we're to call to be positive we're called to give a positive word we're called to talk about our victories not our defeats can you say amen and I don't mean be phony like we don't have defeats we do but but when David was called before Goliath or Goliath and all the children of Israel and saw when he got up in front of them and he gave his testimony he told of his victories with the bear and with the lion he didn't share his defeats he shared his victories thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information please contact us by visiting
