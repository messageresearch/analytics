[10:00] mountains stand by
[10:03] me. The earth all around me is sinking
[10:07] sand. On Christ the side rock I s when I
[10:13] need a shelter. When I need a friend I
[10:16] go to rock. Ask yourself tonight, where
[10:20] do where do I
[10:23] go? Oh, when there's no one left to turn
[10:28] to, who can I talk

[11:31] threatening, who do I turn to? Oh, yes.
[11:36] When those winds of sorrow blowing and
[11:40] there is a
[11:43] refuge in the time of
[11:46] tribulation, I go to the rock. I know he
[11:50] is able. I go to the

[12:53] Amen. He is our rock. When everything
[12:56] else fails us in life, the stock market
[12:58] goes up and down. We can watch it all
[13:01] day long and it's just going to
[13:03] disappoint and disappoint and but we
[13:06] have something steady. Not only steady,
[13:08] but it's steadily going up. See, the
[13:11] stock market goes

[24:33] And this is what we read a couple weeks
[24:34] ago. Um, and we're going to continue
[24:37] with our little series here. 1 Peter
[24:39] chapter 5. And uh, if I've forgot Miriam
[24:43] or anyone any other specific
[24:44] announcements for Sunday that we need to
[24:46] make, get them up to me by the end of
[24:47] the service and we'll make those. We
[24:49] want to be ready uh, for this special
[24:51] day coming up on this Sunday,
[24:52] strengthening the families and those who
[24:55] are listening online as well. would just
[24:57] uh welcome you, those of our
[24:58] congregation to be able to come and
[25:00] enjoy that. And we'll have another one
[25:02] coming up in September as well. So,
[25:05] we're looking forward forward to it.
[25:06] There'll be some flyers coming out for
[25:08] the other meetings for the summer. Uh
[25:10] just one special meeting in June, uh
[25:12] fourth weekend in June. We'll have
[25:14] brother uh Diggs with us for Saturday
[25:16] and then brother Homer Langori u here on
[25:20] Sunday morning with us as well. So,
[25:22] we're looking forward to those special
[25:23] meetings. 1 Peter chapter 5 and verse 5.
[25:27] And likewise, ye younger, submit
[25:29] yourself unto the elder. Yay, all of you
[25:31] be subject one to another. Be clothed
[25:34] with humility. For God resisteth the
[25:36] proud, and giveth grace to the humble.
[25:40] Humble yourselves, therefore, under the
[25:41] mighty hand of God, that he may exalt
[25:45] you in due time, casting all your care
[25:48] upon him, for he carth for you. Father,
[25:53] we just pray that you'll remember as we
[25:56] keep bringing these names before you,
[25:58] Lord, of the different ones who are
[25:59] sick. And Lord, just uh remembering
[26:03] sister Randy there and her relative Lord
[26:05] is uh not doing well. I don't know if he
[26:07] was mentioned tonight, but just be with
[26:09] the Brent Brent's family tonight and the
[26:12] Benes, Lord, that you will strengthen
[26:14] them, I pray. And Lord, also the Snow
[26:17] family and the different ones we're
[26:19] remembering. Father, remember them again
[26:20] tonight. And God, we just pray as that
[26:24] uh girl, young girl that's my barber,
[26:27] Lord, today she just begin to be so
[26:30] broken down. And I ask her why she lost
[26:32] her dad here last week, just 59 years
[26:35] old. Remember Bailey, Lord, and be a
[26:38] comfort to her. I pray in the name of
[26:40] Jesus Christ, Lord. And my heart just
[26:42] goes out to her, Father. I said I'd
[26:44] pray. And so I just want to remember her
[26:46] name before your throne. Would you bless
[26:48] and anoint your word tonight, Father?
[26:51] And may we leave here Lord burning in
[26:52] our hearts from your word. We pray in
[26:55] Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. You can
[26:57] take your seats
[26:59] tonight. Praise the
[27:03] Lord. Casting all your cares upon him
[27:07] for he carth for you. So I've opened up
[27:10] a little series here on Wednesday
[27:12] nights. At least when I'm speaking, we
[27:14] have wonderful other ministries here
[27:16] that we try to use and let God use their
[27:19] gift. Uh, but if if as as as long as I'm
[27:23] doing it here, what Wednesday nights I
[27:25] take, we'll just stay on this because
[27:27] it's really deep in my heart. And the
[27:29] series is the key in he cares, do you
[27:32] care? That's a service that brother
[27:34] Brand preached. And I won't go back to
[27:36] some of the things that we brought out
[27:38] in the last service about it. Uh, but it
[27:40] is certainly something that's a key
[27:42] message. is not so much doctrinal, but
[27:45] it's kind of an entrance for people uh
[27:48] people of God to be able to know the
[27:50] entrance into God. The entrance to get
[27:52] God's attention, the entrance to have a
[27:54] caring God step into our situation. And
[27:58] so, I think there's some really key
[27:59] elements here. And in uh another week or
[28:02] so, we'll uh be having a pastor's
[28:04] getaway, my wife and I, brother Sam and
[28:06] his wife hosting uh next week a pastor's
[28:09] getaway in Amish country for a few days.
[28:11] And I I think I might share some of
[28:13] these with the brothers and just as an
[28:15] encouragement to them. But the the key
[28:17] and he cares, do you care? And I laid
[28:20] some foundations last time. And so I
[28:22] just ask you tonight for your uh careful
[28:24] attention to this subject. The key is
[28:28] bringing a God who cares to connect with
[28:31] a person who cares so that they can
[28:34] really be delivered. When brother
[28:36] Brandham titles it he cares. All of us
[28:39] know that and say know that we have a
[28:40] God that cares about every detail of our
[28:43] lives. But then it he didn't leave it
[28:45] just that God cares. He said he cares.
[28:47] Do you care? So the key that I'm talking
[28:50] about is when we can bring those two
[28:53] things together. You have a God who
[28:55] cares. You have a God who wants to step
[28:57] into the situation. You have a God who
[29:00] wants to be the supernatural God and
[29:02] lift you out. As we were speaking of
[29:05] Sunday of the ascension and the power of
[29:06] God to lift, you have a God who cares,
[29:09] but then you've got to connect that with
[29:11] the person who really cares. So, he
[29:13] cares. Do you care? People can say they
[29:16] care, but their actions and their life
[29:18] show if they really want to get help, if
[29:21] they really want to be delivered. So, he
[29:24] cares, but but it's only half of the
[29:27] thing. In other words, God can care and
[29:29] God can step in and God can
[29:31] supernaturally move. But if he doesn't
[29:33] have that other side working with you,
[29:35] they really want deliverance, you can't
[29:37] bring that together. And actually, when
[29:39] you bring those two elements together,
[29:41] God can do something
[29:43] supernatural. God can step in and do
[29:46] something uh that's beyond human. Can
[29:48] you say amen? So if that then if that's
[29:51] true, if those two elements come
[29:52] together and something supernatural can
[29:54] happen, if it's true, then we know that
[29:57] our enemy would work really hard uh at
[30:01] making a person hesitant to turn
[30:03] everything over to him. He does not want
[30:06] to see that connection take place. Satan
[30:09] does not want to see this type of
[30:11] oneness between someone who has a need
[30:13] and a God who's a supernatural God. He
[30:16] would like to see that connection stop.
[30:18] And one of the things in this series is
[30:20] I want to get to is all the things that
[30:22] would make a person hesitant in their
[30:25] heart to embrace. And there's actually a
[30:27] word here casting all your cares. I
[30:29] don't know if you know what that means,
[30:30] but I want to break it down in the next
[30:32] services of even what casting our cares.
[30:36] We got to know what that means cuz
[30:37] that's what he asks us to do. to take
[30:39] all of our worries and all of our fears
[30:42] and our anxiety and our depression and
[30:45] our things that we don't understand.
[30:47] He's asking for all of the when he says
[30:50] casting all your cares, it means all of
[30:53] our cares. It we don't just handle some
[30:56] things on our own. He's actually saying
[30:58] cast all of our cares upon him. And I
[31:01] want to know what that meaning cast
[31:03] means. And it it has a deeper meaning.
[31:05] And we got to understand because that's
[31:07] what he's asked us to do is we've got to
[31:09] trust him to cast all of our cares upon
[31:12] him because he cares for those things.
[31:15] But you see now I want to explore all
[31:18] the ways the enemy tries to hold back a
[31:21] heart from trusting the Lord to cast
[31:25] everything on him because that's where
[31:27] the enemy works. That's where he's and
[31:29] uh the it's the kind of trust and guess
[31:32] what uh that kind of trust today in the
[31:35] Lord is rare. That kind of trust to cast
[31:39] all your cares upon him is rare. And why
[31:44] is that? Well, I think a lot of it is
[31:46] people don't trust and people's image of
[31:49] God has been hurt. People's image of
[31:52] spiritual things has been hurt. And so
[31:54] now they're they they love God, but they
[31:57] hold their heart back. They don't fully
[31:59] trust. People don't trust ministry
[32:00] today. People don't trust the
[32:02] government. Of course, today they don't
[32:04] trust. But but when it comes to God, the
[32:06] real God, what a shame when Satan makes
[32:08] people mistrust God. I mean, we can
[32:11] mistrust government. We can not trust
[32:13] those other things. And you might even
[32:15] have an issue with people and people
[32:17] hurt you so much. But there comes a
[32:19] point where Satan, you have to draw a
[32:21] line with the enemy when he's causing
[32:23] you to hold back your heart from
[32:25] trusting in a God who cares. Can you say
[32:27] amen? And I want to explore all the ways
[32:30] the heart can hold back because that's
[32:32] where we run into trouble. God cannot
[32:36] fully step in when the heart is with
[32:38] withheld from him. So Satan has
[32:42] certainly uh done his best to keep this
[32:44] connection from happening of he cares.
[32:47] do you care? And that that making that
[32:49] connection and we will just get into all
[32:51] the ways that Satan would uh try to uh
[32:54] keep somebody from fully trusting God
[32:56] and all the hindrances to God uh
[32:59] stepping into your situation. Remember,
[33:01] he does not say, "I care." God doesn't
[33:04] just say, "I care." And this is what I
[33:06] dealt with. It's his caring is doing
[33:08] something about it. God cares enough to
[33:11] step in and change things. He doesn't
[33:14] stand back and say, "I care." He wants
[33:16] to step in with his power and change
[33:19] things. Always remember that when you're
[33:21] praying, God's just saying, "I really
[33:23] care for that. Oh, I care for that
[33:25] need." No, he's ready and willing when
[33:27] the situation's right. When the
[33:28] atmosphere is right, he's wanting to
[33:30] step in and change the whole thing.
[33:32] Amen. Because he's a God that doesn't
[33:34] just say, "I care." He's a God that
[33:36] wants to step in and show that he cares.
[33:39] His caring has emotion and an action to
[33:42] it.
[33:44] And so our
[33:46] caring, he cares. Do you care? Our
[33:49] caring must have emotion and an action
[33:52] to it, not just words. Can you say
[33:57] amen? You know, um I was thinking today
[34:00] we ministers uh um have a kind of an
[34:04] interesting position and um just
[34:07] standing between God and the people and
[34:10] uh that's a that can be a wonderful
[34:13] thing. It is a privilege. It's a
[34:14] wonderful thing to kind of be uh a
[34:16] ministry of reconciliation. What you're
[34:18] reconciling is take a God that's real
[34:20] and reconcile with the hearts of men.
[34:22] And so we stand in between that. You
[34:24] stand in the gap for people as a
[34:26] minister. We stand here in the pulpit.
[34:28] And we don't do this for money. We
[34:30] shouldn't do it for money. We don't do
[34:31] it for our health. Uh we don't do it
[34:33] because there's not something else to do
[34:35] it. We we do it because there's a
[34:37] calling in our hearts to stand in
[34:39] between and try to connect people with
[34:41] this supernatural God and bring the
[34:44] people together with their needs that
[34:45] they have. And it's it's quite an
[34:47] interesting thing and I I won't
[34:48] elaborate on that, but it's sometimes
[34:50] it's good, sometimes it's rough,
[34:52] sometimes you want to put up your hands
[34:54] and uh retire. I don't think ministers
[34:57] probably can do that, but anyway. Uh you
[34:59] know, sometimes you want to because but
[35:01] really what we're what we do this for,
[35:03] we want to help people. We want to help
[35:05] people be saved. We want to help people
[35:07] find their way to the foot of Calvary.
[35:10] We And but the thing is is that we we
[35:13] have no power of our own to help people.
[35:19] We have no power of our own. We're not
[35:21] serving in this capacity thinking that
[35:24] we can change people. And if we do,
[35:26] we've got the wrong motive. We've got
[35:28] the wrong energy. Can you say amen? We
[35:30] really need the humility to say I can't
[35:32] do anything but I can be a conduit to
[35:35] point the people to the right thing to
[35:36] bring the presence of God. Can you say
[35:38] amen? And connect the people. It has to
[35:41] be a connection with him and the people
[35:43] that happens and we cannot help people.
[35:46] We cannot uh we cannot change people. U
[35:50] matter of fact it's today it's a
[35:52] supernatural thing when people change
[35:54] because people change but not much. Bill
[35:58] Gaither's father said that. He said it
[36:00] was some wisdom. People change but not
[36:03] much. And uh that's it seems like a
[36:06] negative statement. And all of us in the
[36:08] kingdom of God realize it's possible for
[36:10] God to change people. But if you're
[36:12] looking at it without of God, without
[36:14] God, people change, but not much.
[36:17] There's not much change that takes
[36:18] place. Once something's ingrained in
[36:20] their mind, once something's ingrained
[36:22] by their upbringing, once it's ingrained
[36:24] in their spirit, they pretty much stay
[36:26] that same way. It takes a supernatural
[36:28] God to change the heart and change
[36:31] thinking. Can you say amen? To be
[36:33] transformed by the renewing of our mind.
[36:35] But we ministers and if you've served
[36:38] for a long time, then you are extremely
[36:40] sensitive to your lack of your part in
[36:44] this. And also, you're sensitive to
[36:46] waiting for God to show up.
[36:51] Can you say amen?
[36:53] When you're young in the ministry, you
[36:56] think you can do it, but then God knocks
[36:58] the props out from underneath you and
[37:00] you realize you can't do anything. He
[37:02] did it to Paul. He did it to every other
[37:03] minister. And Paul finally said, "When
[37:05] I'm weak," uh, I love there's one
[37:08] chapter where he goes and starts
[37:09] boasting of all the things he's been
[37:11] through and all his weakness because
[37:13] there was some apostles or some
[37:14] preachers that were bragging. They were
[37:16] bragging. We're like Paul. We're doing
[37:18] this. We're doing that. He says, "And
[37:20] they're boasting of what they can do."
[37:22] And Paul's basically saying, "You guys
[37:24] don't have a clue what ministry is all
[37:25] about. You know, I've I've been beaten
[37:27] three times." He goes into his biography
[37:30] and he say, "This is what ministry is
[37:32] really all. You sure you want to be a
[37:33] part of this? You sure you want to do
[37:34] all this?" Shipwrecked. You know, all
[37:36] these other things happened to him. And
[37:38] he says, "If I'll boast of anything,
[37:40] I'll boast of my weakness because when
[37:42] I'm weak, he becomes strong. And the
[37:44] only fruit that's come out of his
[37:46] ministry that's supernatural, it's
[37:47] because he became weaker and weaker and
[37:50] weaker. And it was not any of Paul who
[37:52] did it. It's not any minister who does
[37:54] it. It's God who does it.
[37:57] When we're young, we think we can do it.
[37:59] But when God knocks the props out, then
[38:01] we realize we're very dependent. Reminds
[38:03] me of something similar to what the
[38:05] prophet would say just as he was coming
[38:08] to the ends of the end of the service
[38:10] and that gift and thing would come where
[38:12] he'd discern. You know how many times he
[38:15] said, I don't know how many times, but
[38:16] he said this sometimes. He said, he said
[38:19] he'd be talking and he'd be giving
[38:21] testimonies and he'd be going on then he
[38:23] said now you know I'm waiting on
[38:24] something.
[38:27] That's how dependent he was. And one
[38:29] place I read it today. He says I'm
[38:31] completely helpless unless he comes. Now
[38:35] there's an honest man. Can you say amen?
[38:37] He's not going to jump into trying to
[38:39] make it happen. But he because he cares
[38:41] for the sheep enough and their trust
[38:43] that he says you know I'm waiting for
[38:45] something. you know, I'm waiting for him
[38:47] to come and then you just hear that
[38:49] sometimes you think now he's here and he
[38:52] step back and God start giving him
[38:54] discernment. He wasn't going to trust in
[38:56] just himself to make it happen. He said
[38:58] I'm waiting on him. And basically that's
[39:01] ministry as well is that we preach we we
[39:04] we we stay uh we we stay disciplined to
[39:08] the call. We do everything that we can,
[39:10] but we realize what we're waiting for as
[39:12] ministers is that moment when somebody
[39:16] connects that needs something and
[39:17] connects with a supernatural God. We're
[39:20] preaching, we're preaching, and we're
[39:22] we're doing and we're serving, but it's
[39:25] really those God moments. It's those
[39:27] moments there's a connection. Can you
[39:29] say amen? It's there's it's the moments
[39:31] and it only takes one moment. Can you
[39:33] say amen? It only takes just one
[39:36] connection and it's over. Amen. That's
[39:39] how big God is. But you see now uh and
[39:43] and and so we don't preach. We're
[39:45] helpless unless he comes. 1 Corinthians
[39:47] 2:4, there's a power of God in the
[39:49] gospel. We're waiting on the power of
[39:50] God to change people's lives. Paul said,
[39:52] "My speech and my preaching was not with
[39:54] enticing words of man's wisdom, but in
[39:57] demonstration of the spirit and of the
[39:59] power." Paul believed that it's not to
[40:01] get up here and preach a sermon. It's
[40:03] not to dazzle people with all the
[40:05] things, you know. Uh, may we as
[40:07] ministers, if you're listening tonight,
[40:09] may we ditch all this pride and bragging
[40:11] and all this stuff we can do, and may we
[40:14] get to what Paul said is that we're
[40:16] going to bring an atmosphere that
[40:17] there's a demonstration of the spirit
[40:19] and the power of God that people can
[40:21] connect with a supernatural God. Unless
[40:24] we have that, it's a waste of time. It's
[40:27] a waste of a sermon. Can you say amen?
[40:30] And I believe in teaching, but I believe
[40:31] in teaching by the Holy Ghost. I believe
[40:34] the Holy Ghost teach not just preach.
[40:36] I'm going to do a little teaching
[40:37] tonight. But you see, it has to be by
[40:39] his power, not just intellect. And so
[40:43] the church for too many years have has
[40:46] been a powerless religion. And then the
[40:48] deception, you know, all these years of
[40:51] 2,000 years, it's been a powerless
[40:52] religion because of the dark ages. But
[40:55] we we need something more than a
[40:57] powerless religion. And we need to
[40:59] preach something more than that. We need
[41:01] the God uh who is the creator to come
[41:04] and connect and to change people's
[41:07] lives. Can you say amen? So we've had
[41:09] years of powerless religion and then the
[41:12] deception into the Pentecostal move
[41:14] after the original Zuza Street. The
[41:18] deception that came in the Pentecostal
[41:20] move was that it began to believe that
[41:23] all the emotion in the services was his
[41:26] power. That's a deception because it
[41:29] proved that all the motion and pushing
[41:31] for emotion didn't necessarily mean the
[41:34] power of God was there.
[41:37] That's a huge deception. And and and so
[41:39] you misinterpret power. There's too many
[41:42] uh temporarily worked up uh the work the
[41:46] people temporarily working them up into
[41:48] a frenzy of emotion and not really power
[41:50] for a real change in their life. So
[41:53] that's our last church age and we borrow
[41:56] from that too much because brother
[41:57] Brandham corrected them over and over
[41:59] again. You're losing the meaning of what
[42:01] the anointing is. You're saying the
[42:03] anointing is somebody who dances all
[42:05] over the church. But he says the
[42:07] greatest anointing that was ever won on
[42:10] a human being was on Jesus Christ and he
[42:12] sat and precious words proceeded from
[42:15] his mouth. A completely anointed man.
[42:18] So, uh, Pentecost misinterprets all
[42:20] that, misdirects young people,
[42:22] misdirects people into thinking there's
[42:24] the power of God because somebody's
[42:26] dancing. There's the anointing of God,
[42:27] and it misinterprets it all. Listen, if
[42:30] God himself, the creator, is not coming
[42:33] into that life and changing them, then
[42:35] it's just emotion. But if he's changing
[42:38] them, there's going to be some emotion.
[42:41] There's going to be some shouting.
[42:42] There's going to be some When you get
[42:44] deliverance, true deliverance, you're
[42:46] going to shout about it. You're going to
[42:48] dance about it and maybe you won't
[42:49] dance. Maybe you'll just lift your hands
[42:51] and just weep in appreciation for the
[42:54] Lord. But whatever emotion, we never
[42:56] judge the power of God by the emotion.
[42:59] It's wrong for ministers to push that.
[43:01] It's wrong for ministers to to make that
[43:03] the main thing and then label it the
[43:05] power of God. It's wrong for you to do
[43:07] that. The message corrects that.
[43:10] Praise the Lord. But we don't but that
[43:13] being said, we don't want a powerless
[43:15] religion. Can you say amen? Does anybody
[43:18] here want a powerless religion? Does
[43:20] anybody here m want to make it just
[43:21] sermons and just coming to church and
[43:24] clocking in time? No. When we come, we
[43:26] want to meet with God. We we want to
[43:28] connect with God. We want him to
[43:30] personally speak some revelation to us.
[43:33] We don't want a powerless religion. This
[43:36] isn't books and tapes and doctrine and
[43:38] head knowledge. This is deeper than
[43:40] that. Can you say amen? This is
[43:42] connecting with the creator himself.
[43:46] This is access to the very God who
[43:49] created the heavens and the earth. What
[43:52] is church when we come? What is serving
[43:54] the Lord? It's connecting with the
[43:56] creator of heavens and earth. The one
[43:59] who spoke this world into existence,
[44:02] spoke the stars into existence is the
[44:04] same one who's speaking to you tonight.
[44:07] We're dealing with a creator. And a
[44:09] creator wants to create something new.
[44:12] Amen.
[44:14] A creator doesn't polish up and put a
[44:17] band-aid on the old. He creates
[44:20] something new.
[44:22] I'm glad that I can preach and point to
[44:24] people and welcome the creator of
[44:28] heavens and earth that can create
[44:30] something in the people. Come on, praise
[44:32] the Lord tonight. Praise the Lord. This
[44:35] isn't just church. This is the creator
[44:37] of heavens and earth showing up and we
[44:39] want him to show up every service. We
[44:42] need this in our life. Can you say amen?
[44:44] So it's access to the creator himself.
[44:46] So as ministers that's what we're
[44:48] looking for to really help the people
[44:50] God. So now let me say let's move on
[44:53] now. And you know and you you have to
[44:55] know that there is so much to this
[44:57] series. I'm just going to slow down and
[45:00] even though I'm yelling already and
[45:02] excited, I'm going to slow down and take
[45:04] it piece by piece because this has to be
[45:06] taken piece by piece. So the next point
[45:08] I want to make, God cares by creating.
[45:16] God cares, shows he cares by creating
[45:19] something new.
[45:22] Never can we underestimate what a
[45:25] creative God can do. in the beginning.
[45:29] Uh, and that's where you hear the word
[45:31] create a lot is in Genesis. He created
[45:34] this. God created the heavens and the
[45:36] earth. God created. And so, you know,
[45:38] brother Steven would be a good one to
[45:40] talk to and and to to explore into these
[45:43] things. But as he took this the 6,000
[45:45] years there and and he created and he,
[45:48] you know, he he he brought all these
[45:51] things and he created them. And you know
[45:54] uh before he started creating the Bible
[45:57] says the earth was without form and
[46:01] void. That means it was empty. It was
[46:03] without form. It was what we would call
[46:06] today a chaos. There was no order to it.
[46:09] But the creative power of God by the
[46:12] spoken word took chaos.
[46:17] Took chaos and created something new.
[46:20] That's right. Why are you saying that,
[46:21] brother? Because tonight we serve the
[46:23] same God. He doesn't want to patch up
[46:25] human beings. The creator wants to
[46:28] create something new. He wants to start
[46:30] over. Can you say amen? And he wants to
[46:33] take chaos. And so that's when you go to
[46:36] prayer for for even some trial or lack
[46:38] of something in your life. When you go
[46:40] to prayer, it's not just asking for a
[46:43] caring God to be mindful of your
[46:44] situation. You're talking to the
[46:46] creator. And the creator can change and
[46:49] create something new. Amen. Now,
[46:52] friends, you're I don't want you to just
[46:54] just say amen tonight. I want you to
[46:56] really get this in your heart. When we
[46:58] go to pray, when what we're dealing with
[47:00] is not another sermon or not another
[47:02] movement here. We've tapped into and
[47:05] connected to the very creator of heavens
[47:07] and earth. That can create squirrels.
[47:09] Can you say amen? That can speak to the
[47:11] storm and it would go away.
[47:14] A man spoke the words because the
[47:16] creator told him to speak the word and
[47:19] he changed and created something new,
[47:22] something that wasn't there. You know,
[47:24] the prophet brought out that, you know,
[47:26] when Jesus multiplied and created the
[47:28] fish and loaves, he took fishes and
[47:30] loaves that were there and he blessed
[47:33] them and they multiplied. When you're
[47:35] talking about a squirrel that wasn't
[47:37] there, he took some that wasn't there.
[47:39] So now it's increasing and it's it's
[47:42] elevating. Can you say amen? Something
[47:44] that's not there. Something in a
[47:46] person's life that it doesn't look like
[47:48] there's any hope. It's chaos. There's
[47:50] nothing there. The creator says, "I'll
[47:52] create it in there."
[47:55] We're dealing with a creator and he
[47:57] cares by creating. He doesn't want to
[48:00] patch up something. He doesn't want to
[48:03] just make it. So, God can start
[48:05] creating. When man fell and he needed
[48:08] redemption 4,000 years
[48:11] later,
[48:13] redemption is not a different work than
[48:16] creating. Redemption is bringing
[48:18] something back, but he still does it by
[48:21] creative power.
[48:26] God doesn't say, "Well, I created things
[48:27] in the beginning, but now that man has
[48:29] fallen and I've got to bring him back
[48:31] now, I'll just patch him up or I got to
[48:33] use a different way." The same creator
[48:34] that created the heavens and the earth
[48:36] now comes on the day of Pentecost. And
[48:38] he's the same creator. What's he
[48:40] creating now? Not the heavens and the
[48:42] earth, but now he's taken a fallen man.
[48:44] And he's by his creative word speaks his
[48:48] spirit into that man. And Paul says he
[48:52] becomes a new creature, created a new in
[48:57] Jesus Christ. He didn't patch up human
[49:00] beings.
[49:02] He stood there and blew in that upper
[49:05] room like he did at the beginning
[49:07] speaking the stars. Brother Brandham,
[49:11] one service, you know, you go here and
[49:14] you go here
[49:15] and well that's what happened on the day
[49:17] of Pentecost that m rushing mighty wind
[49:19] came in and now it's the same creator
[49:22] who's creating the moon and the stars
[49:24] now is creating a new creature in Christ
[49:26] Jesus.
[49:31] So hold on now because it's easy to say
[49:33] amen to he's a creator but now we we'll
[49:38] move it on in just a minute. So the the
[49:40] chaos redemption is still the creator.
[49:43] New creatures in Christ, old things pass
[49:45] away. All things become new. All things
[49:48] become new. Can you say amen? 7,000
[49:52] years to create everything in the
[49:54] beginning. And I just want to say if you
[49:56] took 7,000 years
[49:58] to make everything new, then uh you
[50:01] ought to have patience for some people.
[50:05] Can you say amen?
[50:07] Because he's not working just to patch
[50:09] it up. He's a
[50:11] creator. David caught the revelation of
[50:14] it after he had sinned with
[50:17] Basheba and after he went through losing
[50:20] the child, after he'd went through
[50:22] because you always reap what you sow.
[50:24] after he'd went through his rebuke from
[50:27] the prophet, he lost the child.
[50:29] Everything was a mess. Probably lost the
[50:31] respect of the men in his army if they
[50:33] heard about I'm sure they heard about
[50:34] it. So, but but you see in his
[50:37] repentance in in in Psalms, somebody
[50:40] help me out. It's in Psalms there.
[50:42] Psalms he repents and part of his
[50:45] repentant prayer as he didn't pray, I
[50:49] made a mistake, Lord, make me better.
[50:53] He got a revelation. He said, "Lord, not
[50:56] make me better. Lord, create."
[51:01] Create in me.
[51:04] He He's catching it. That God, I don't
[51:08] want you to just patch me up. I don't
[51:10] want to just just make me better. You're
[51:13] the creator. Create in me a clean heart.
[51:17] And he's speaking of the blood of
[51:18] redemption because the cross, the blood
[51:20] wasn't on the cross yet. So he's
[51:22] speaking ahead because he couldn't even
[51:24] receive the blood at that level of the
[51:26] cross yet. But he's speaking by
[51:27] revelation that the creator would have
[51:30] the creative power to create a clean
[51:32] heart, a completely clean soul before
[51:35] God. Create in me a clean heart and
[51:38] renew a right spirit with me in me. Can
[51:40] you say amen? Here's a quote that I've
[51:42] always enjoyed in 1952. I just want to
[51:45] say there's so many people passing. Do
[51:48] you I don't know if you got those
[51:49] quotes. Thank you. Thank you, brother
[51:51] Ian. I think most of the time he does it
[51:53] for me and I'm so disorganized. I
[51:55] sometimes send it to him 10 minutes
[51:57] before the service and he still has it
[51:58] up here. So, God bless you, Brother Yen,
[52:00] for your work for the Lord there and all
[52:02] of our help up there. I've always loved
[52:05] this quote. Look at this. I just want to
[52:07] say there's so many people passing
[52:09] through here through the prayer line
[52:10] that's suffering with mental oppression,
[52:13] demon manifestation, but oppression.
[52:16] Satan, I've seen a vision break before
[52:19] me of a young lady. She went back there
[52:21] and sat down a few minutes ago and she
[52:24] thinks that she's crossed the separating
[52:27] line. Now, from what I gather, she had
[52:29] come up into the prayer line. She headed
[52:32] back to her seat and Satan's putting
[52:34] thoughts that you can't get help because
[52:36] you've crossed the separating line. He
[52:38] says, "Don't let Satan tell you that. As
[52:41] long as you love God, God still loves
[52:44] you." Look at the next thing he says. It
[52:47] has to be a creator to create that
[52:51] creation in your heart to make you love
[52:54] God.
[52:58] Don't believe that. Say, go believing
[52:59] with all your heart that Christ loves
[53:01] you. But look how powerful that is.
[53:02] That's all the way back 1952. It has to
[53:05] be a creator to create. Even the love of
[53:08] God that's within you had to be the work
[53:11] of the creator. Now you talk about
[53:13] putting that in the face of the devil
[53:15] that's trying to tell you you've crossed
[53:16] the line. She should have stood up. I
[53:18] know she did. She should have stood
[53:21] stood up and told the devil say listen
[53:23] whatever I know I love God and I didn't
[53:25] get that by myself. I didn't come to an
[53:27] altar and get that myself. God created
[53:31] this love for me. Love for him.
[53:34] Hallelujah. This is a create I'm a
[53:36] creation of God. Whatever good is in me,
[53:39] God has created it. Amen. Now listen
[53:42] friends, that's pretty powerful because
[53:46] Satan can't create. He can only pervert
[53:50] what God's created.
[53:53] Well, brother Paul, I got saved one day
[53:55] and I got the Holy Ghost and that's and
[53:57] my life was different. Praise the Lord.
[53:59] But you know what it was? The creative
[54:02] the creator of heavens and earth
[54:05] connected with you and created something
[54:08] within you. Or like we as believers
[54:11] know, he anointed or he put his spirit
[54:13] on something laying dormant within you.
[54:16] Can you say amen? Brought it to life.
[54:19] Hallelujah. I love that quote. Praise
[54:22] the Lord. So, as
[54:26] ministers and all of you ministers that
[54:29] are listening tonight are all in a
[54:30] certain
[54:32] way. All of us in a certain way. We
[54:35] pray, but we look to this create great
[54:37] creator who cares to step in to make
[54:40] this connection. The creator looking for
[54:42] that. We're looking for that God moment.
[54:45] And when he does, when he steps in, when
[54:49] the right conditions are met and there's
[54:50] a connection, it's over.
[54:54] It's over. Or should I say, it's just
[54:56] begun.
[54:58] Once that happens, it can be just a
[55:01] moment. But dealing with people
[55:04] sometimes it may make it take many years
[55:06] for that moment to happen. Do you know
[55:09] that? And but once it does it's over.
[55:12] But sometimes it can take years before
[55:14] it happens. I was thinking of the men on
[55:16] the road to Emmas who had been with
[55:18] Jesus watched all the miracles. So Jesus
[55:21] steps in in another form and he and
[55:24] uh they're all troubled about it and
[55:27] they said that the the women had just
[55:29] went to the tomb and come back and
[55:31] reported that he wasn't there and
[55:33] they're just all trying to and and Jesus
[55:35] said this. Oh
[55:37] fools and slow of heart to believe all
[55:41] that the prophets have said. And from
[55:43] that moment, he begins to open the
[55:45] scriptures to them to show them this was
[55:48] this has happened exactly the way he
[55:50] said. But see, they are only looking at
[55:51] the flesh of what happened. Now they're
[55:53] disappointed he's gone. But they're not
[55:55] looking at the word. This is exactly
[55:56] what was supposed to happen. You see,
[55:58] but look what he said. Oh fools and slow
[56:02] of what? Slow of heart to believe. Now,
[56:04] I just thought of it today that if back
[56:07] then Jesus is telling them, "You're very
[56:10] slow at coming along to believing after
[56:12] they'd been with Jesus physically for
[56:14] three and a half years, then how slow
[56:17] are people today to
[56:21] catch this
[56:27] thing." And that can be a real
[56:29] frustration for a minister. And a
[56:32] minister can become impatient really
[56:35] quick with people. But impatience with
[56:38] the people of God will never work.
[56:41] Fear tactics will never work.
[56:45] Force is never a good motive. Fear is
[56:48] never a good
[56:50] motive. Be in shape. They should be way
[56:53] further along than they should. You see
[56:56] what a a minister deals with? Because as
[56:58] I say to pastors, I say we hold the
[57:00] vision of where this word can take the
[57:03] people. And then as a pastor, we look at
[57:06] the saints every week and some are
[57:07] moving along, some are slow. So, and you
[57:10] can get frustrated. They're supposed to
[57:12] be over here and they're way back
[57:15] here. I'm not talking about any of you,
[57:17] of
[57:19] course, but you're caught in the middle
[57:21] saying, "How they can they not see the
[57:23] vision of where this word can take
[57:25] them?" When you got that vision, you
[57:27] say, "My, they should be much further
[57:28] along. Maybe I should be much further
[57:30] along." And you get frustrated with, but
[57:32] you can't because why? They're slow of
[57:34] heart to believe. But all it takes is
[57:37] one moment in a connection to God, the
[57:40] creator, and that's it.
[57:44] What did Michael say today in a post he
[57:46] put in the youth chat, the men of truth?
[57:49] He said, "I pray." He said because God
[57:53] can do in one moment
[57:56] what I couldn't do for years and can't
[57:58] even do and that's why I pray. Can you
[58:02] say praise the Lord? So now let's move
[58:04] to the next step here. Now God cares by
[58:07] stepping in and creating
[58:09] listening. We show we care by creating
[58:13] the right atmosphere for him to step
[58:16] into. Amen.
[58:20] He shows he cares by bringing the
[58:22] creative power of God to create
[58:24] something new and start a
[58:26] fresh. Remember this now. We can't just
[58:28] have a God who cares. Do you care? Well,
[58:32] I want to get into how do we show we
[58:34] care? Well, we're we're creators. How
[58:36] many know Brother said we're creators?
[58:38] And the biggest thing that we create, we
[58:40] can't uh the biggest thing we start by
[58:43] creating is creating the right
[58:44] atmosphere. We're atmosphere creators.
[58:46] How many enjoyed sister um uh sister
[58:50] Rebecca Duff's song last couple Sundays
[58:52] ago? Uh somebody help me. What was the
[58:55] name of it?
[58:56] Atmosphere. We can change the
[58:58] atmosphere, man. Listen to it again.
[59:00] It's
[59:01] powerful. And uh that's what brother
[59:04] Bram said. We can change. We're little
[59:06] creators and we can change the
[59:08] atmosphere.
[59:09] But what do we do it for? Not just for
[59:11] ourselves. We're doing it so that if you
[59:14] change the atmosphere, you open the door
[59:17] for a creative God to come in. So I want
[59:20] I want you to learn now this he cares.
[59:22] Do you care? It's God the creator on one
[59:25] side. It's a creator of the right
[59:26] atmosphere on the other side creating an
[59:29] atmosphere for God to step in and do
[59:31] something supernatural. It's creating on
[59:35] both sides. It's creating on both sides.
[59:37] You by your attitude and your humility
[59:41] create a different atmosphere that
[59:43] welcomes a creator who cares to step
[59:46] into the room and make
[59:48] changes. Let me say that again. You by
[59:51] your attitude, your humility uh create a
[59:54] different atmosphere. You change the
[59:56] atmosphere and it makes it welcome for a
[59:59] creator to step in. Right
[1:00:02] now, that opens us to the next section
[1:00:04] here to just begin exploring ways that
[1:00:07] we can approach and come to him to show
[1:00:09] we really care. Some of this that you're
[1:00:11] going to know, some of that you some of
[1:00:13] this you may not know, but we want to
[1:00:15] explore. We've probably heard enough
[1:00:16] preaching about how God cares. He's a
[1:00:19] supernatural God. He's a creative God. I
[1:00:21] wanted to deal with that tonight. But we
[1:00:23] really want to begin to break down how
[1:00:26] we can create an atmosphere and offer up
[1:00:28] our hearts. so that we can create the
[1:00:31] right atmosphere so that for the creator
[1:00:33] to step in. He cares but do you care?
[1:00:36] How do we show we care? So we want to
[1:00:38] explore this approach. We want to
[1:00:40] explore this and we can come to him and
[1:00:43] show we really care and create the right
[1:00:46] atmosphere and and we want to break down
[1:00:48] the approach to it and those who are
[1:00:51] interested in a caring God to step in
[1:00:53] will be interested in these things. So
[1:00:55] now the first thing brother Brandham
[1:00:57] says in the message he cares do you care
[1:01:00] after he reads the scriptures and we
[1:01:02] will be breaking down both of his texts
[1:01:04] too because there's much to be said
[1:01:06] right in his scriptural texts but the
[1:01:08] first thing he says right out of right
[1:01:10] out of the gate with after his
[1:01:12] scriptures is first to approach this and
[1:01:15] I emphasize that to approach this he's
[1:01:17] just beginning this service he cares do
[1:01:19] you care the audience must be anointed
[1:01:22] with faith if you do not have faith
[1:01:24] there's There's no need of even coming
[1:01:26] to be prayed for. Now, that's something
[1:01:28] interesting to say. He's saying what
[1:01:30] he's going to say this whole sermon. God
[1:01:32] cares. He cares. But do you care? And if
[1:01:36] the faith isn't right, can you say amen?
[1:01:38] If the atmosphere isn't right, then he
[1:01:41] says there's no need of even coming to
[1:01:43] be prayed for. Well, well, that's
[1:01:45] interesting. That's saying that we are
[1:01:47] bringing something that it's the right
[1:01:50] thing so that he can come in and answer
[1:01:53] the prayer.
[1:01:55] There's no need of even coming to be
[1:01:56] prayed for because it's going to take
[1:01:58] your faith and my faith together, my
[1:02:00] faith to believe in him, your faith to
[1:02:01] believe him so we don't forget this now
[1:02:04] as I go along. He's saying throughout
[1:02:06] the sermon, don't forget this is a
[1:02:08] foundation. This is what he's laying
[1:02:09] down. It's going to take faith and and
[1:02:11] and
[1:02:13] uh so let me just leave it. It's going
[1:02:14] to take faith. Don't forget this now as
[1:02:16] we go along. We've got to have something
[1:02:18] evidently with evidence. I mean that we
[1:02:21] can base our faith upon that we're
[1:02:23] trying to do. Because if a man
[1:02:24] approaches anything that he wants to do
[1:02:27] without sufficient faith, he's bound to
[1:02:30] be a failure. But if he can approach it
[1:02:32] with sufficient faith, then he's bound
[1:02:36] to succeed. If it is according to God's
[1:02:39] will and purpose to do it, that is the
[1:02:42] foundational paragraph there for the
[1:02:45] entire theme. He cares. Do you care? And
[1:02:48] that is the place to start. And that is
[1:02:50] our faith. Can you say amen?
[1:02:55] So can faith have hindrances? Can your
[1:02:57] faith have hindrances?
[1:02:59] Yes. So to be mature about it, we be
[1:03:02] saying, "What's my
[1:03:05] hindrances? God, help me see my
[1:03:07] hindrances to my faith." Because what he
[1:03:10] said in many places, if there's no
[1:03:12] hindrances to my faith, then there's
[1:03:14] nothing stopping from God to step in.
[1:03:18] You see? So just to elaborate on this.
[1:03:22] So the approach is faith, real true
[1:03:25] faith, no walls, nothing hindering. That
[1:03:28] is the foundation to start. But notice
[1:03:30] something here back in another quote in
[1:03:32] enticing spirits. Notice this. Um, and I
[1:03:36] wanted to bring this out because this
[1:03:38] will be a I I can't get through a series
[1:03:41] like this with going back and talking
[1:03:44] about the many places brother
[1:03:47] Brandham emphasizes your conscience and
[1:03:50] subconscious
[1:04:01] [Music]
[1:04:05] which is really tells the truth can have
[1:04:07] unbelief in it. The heart can have
[1:04:10] trouble with it and it can have unbelief
[1:04:13] there. So is no matter how much you said
[1:04:15] it, there's not going to be a connection
[1:04:18] with God if you don't deal with the
[1:04:20] subconscious is what and what's laying
[1:04:22] there. This isn't anything outside the
[1:04:24] message. It's not psychology. Brother
[1:04:26] Brandham talked about it. And why was he
[1:04:28] talking about it? because he knew that
[1:04:30] human beings could not come and seek
[1:04:33] healing which is mostly what they were
[1:04:34] seeking is physical healing in those
[1:04:36] days. Of course, you got the quote I
[1:04:38] read a few minutes ago about depression,
[1:04:39] oppression, the demons work of that. We
[1:04:42] have a lot more of oppression and
[1:04:43] depression today. So, you see that's
[1:04:45] even more significant. But most of it
[1:04:47] was physical healing. You can't come and
[1:04:49] approach that the right way if you've
[1:04:51] got a subconscience that's got something
[1:04:54] laying there that Satan is using to hold
[1:04:58] you back.
[1:05:00] So a person really interested and really
[1:05:03] caring would have to look what's laying
[1:05:06] in the
[1:05:07] subconscious. Can you say amen? Watch
[1:05:09] this a few minutes on the physical. He
[1:05:11] says we have many times for many years
[1:05:13] we got what we call a lie detector. You
[1:05:16] can put it on your wrist, see it across
[1:05:18] their head, and you can get in there and
[1:05:19] try to your best to make a lie sound
[1:05:21] like the truth, and it'll register
[1:05:22] negative every time. I don't know what
[1:05:24] they use today, but this was back in the
[1:05:26] 50s, and they had a lie detector, and
[1:05:28] you did a test. Criminals were put on a
[1:05:30] lie detector test. And that's that's the
[1:05:33] reason is is because they use that is
[1:05:35] because you could say with your mouth
[1:05:37] all day long, I didn't do it. I didn't
[1:05:39] murder that person. I did. and all the
[1:05:42] vibes of your body will will tell the
[1:05:46] truth and that you did do it. So they
[1:05:49] could detect by your bodily cellular
[1:05:52] system it's holding it's trying to hold
[1:05:54] back a lie. You see it's trying to hold
[1:05:57] a lie and you're lying with your lips
[1:05:59] but the subconscious tells the real
[1:06:01] truth. And so everything is going crazy
[1:06:03] and they can say you're lying because
[1:06:05] this the the it's registering negative
[1:06:08] every time because the human was not
[1:06:09] made to lie. Lying is a deceitful hard
[1:06:12] thing, evil thing. I'd rather have a
[1:06:14] drunkard with me any day than a
[1:06:16] liar. See a liar. And your body wasn't
[1:06:19] made to lie, no matter how sinful you
[1:06:21] are. And and if you think we're going to
[1:06:24] just talk about when you stole a cookie
[1:06:27] when you were young from the cookie jar
[1:06:28] and told your mom that you didn't steal
[1:06:31] it, if you think that's the only lies
[1:06:34] that rest in your spirit, you're missing
[1:06:37] what the devil can
[1:06:38] do. Because lies is this vast subject
[1:06:42] that people sometimes can hold a lie
[1:06:45] that they believe their whole life about
[1:06:48] themselves and they can't fully get
[1:06:52] victory or make a connection with a
[1:06:55] creative God because in their cellular
[1:06:58] system in their whole body there's a
[1:07:00] stress and it's because there's a lie
[1:07:02] about yourself being
[1:07:06] believed. Amen.
[1:07:09] So the most, no matter how sinful you
[1:07:13] are, you're still a fallen son of God.
[1:07:15] The most sinful person in this city
[1:07:16] today, God didn't intend you to be
[1:07:18] sinful. He wanted you to be a son or a
[1:07:20] daughter of his. You're made up of his
[1:07:22] own makeup. But sin has caused you to do
[1:07:24] that. And no matter how much you try to
[1:07:26] impersonate and try to make a lie seem
[1:07:28] right, you got a a scientific instrument
[1:07:31] that proves that it's wrong. You can
[1:07:33] tell it with all the innocence you want
[1:07:35] to, but it'll still register negative
[1:07:37] because there's a subconscious down in a
[1:07:39] human being. And that subconscious knows
[1:07:42] what's truth. And no matter what you're
[1:07:44] saying out here, that subconscious knows
[1:07:47] that it's a lie. And it'll register off
[1:07:49] the subconscious. Therefore, if a man or
[1:07:52] a woman could ever get their thoughts
[1:07:54] and their testimony and their lives so
[1:07:58] lined up with God, Amen. until the
[1:08:00] channel of the Holy Spirit would be
[1:08:02] perfectly one with God, what would take
[1:08:05] place?
[1:08:07] Did you see that alignment with your uh
[1:08:10] your confession, your thoughts, your
[1:08:13] subconscious, your conscience when you
[1:08:16] get it lined up? What did he say? My
[1:08:18] what would take place if a man and a
[1:08:21] woman could ever get lined up where
[1:08:23] they're with the freedom from their
[1:08:26] heart with faith from the innermost. Oh
[1:08:31] my, those are powerful words. Freedom
[1:08:33] from their heart. That means that if
[1:08:36] they don't have freedom in their heart,
[1:08:39] then uh they can't completely be open
[1:08:42] with God and come connect with God. They
[1:08:45] need faith from the uppermost with faith
[1:08:47] from the innermost. Many people come to
[1:08:50] the altar to be prayed for. They have an
[1:08:52] intellectual faith. They confess their
[1:08:53] sins. They join a church by intellectual
[1:08:56] faith. They believe it in their mind.
[1:08:58] They believe it because they've heard
[1:08:59] it. They believe it because they know
[1:09:01] it's the best
[1:09:03] policy. But that's not what God looks
[1:09:05] at. He don't look at your intellectual
[1:09:07] faith. He looks on the heart. where are
[1:09:09] where on the inside God and when it
[1:09:12] comes from the heart all things are
[1:09:14] possible then your confession meets up
[1:09:18] with your life your life speaks as loud
[1:09:21] as your confession do confession does
[1:09:24] but when your confession says one thing
[1:09:26] and your life lives another there's
[1:09:27] something wrong somewhere that's because
[1:09:29] you've got an intellectual faith and not
[1:09:31] a faith from your heart and that shows
[1:09:33] that outside here is the knowledge of
[1:09:35] God he's probably pointing to his head
[1:09:38] Outside is the knowledge of God, but
[1:09:40] inside there's a demon, a doubt of uh
[1:09:43] doubting. I believe in divine healing,
[1:09:46] but it's not for me. You see? Oh, it
[1:09:48] could be. So, but I don't believe it.
[1:09:51] Get it? Outside you say yes. Inside your
[1:09:55] conscience says no. That same scientific
[1:09:58] thing would prove that that wasn't
[1:10:03] right. Prove it.
[1:10:06] So
[1:10:08] God has built us the way that we are.
[1:10:11] He's built us not to lie. Can you say
[1:10:15] amen? And when there's lies being
[1:10:17] believed
[1:10:19] subconsciously, then you can't fully
[1:10:23] connect. And so what are you saying,
[1:10:24] brother? I'm saying that the one of the
[1:10:27] things that we do to show that we care
[1:10:29] and that we want to get help and that we
[1:10:32] want to connect with God is that you're
[1:10:34] willing to say,
[1:10:36] "Lord, line my subconscious. Line my
[1:10:40] heart completely up." Not talking about
[1:10:41] the soul now. I'm using it as the
[1:10:43] subconscious the way brother Ram did.
[1:10:46] Line up my
[1:10:47] heart with your word and my confession
[1:10:52] because why? It it it creates the right
[1:10:55] heart and atmosphere for God to step in.
[1:10:59] And you can't ignore
[1:11:01] it and get something greater from God.
[1:11:04] You can't. You're showing if you're
[1:11:07] hiding things, you're showing it you
[1:11:09] don't really care. Can I be real?
[1:11:13] If you're still hiding things or you're
[1:11:15] not still not being honest about things,
[1:11:18] you're showing God that you really don't
[1:11:21] care to get freedom that you're asking
[1:11:25] for. So, in uh I'm going to close this
[1:11:28] tonight because I never get into all
[1:11:30] this this evening. I want to take it
[1:11:32] piece by piece and I probably
[1:11:35] um hopefully you're picking up what I'm
[1:11:37] laying down because I'm going to take it
[1:11:39] in pieces. Okay. Amen. But let me show
[1:11:43] you where we're going with some of these
[1:11:44] points of how we show we care. Okay? And
[1:11:47] there'll be more to these, but I just
[1:11:49] wrote seven down tonight. This is where
[1:11:50] we're going. If you have that slide,
[1:11:55] um, showing some points about where
[1:11:57] we're going and how we show we care. How
[1:11:59] we show we care. Because that's what we
[1:12:01] want to know. If he says he cares, do
[1:12:04] you care? How do we show we care? The
[1:12:05] first one is what he talked about in the
[1:12:07] first quote. real true unclouded faith
[1:12:11] from the
[1:12:13] heart. When that's clear, then we're
[1:12:15] showing we really care. If it's left
[1:12:17] hidden, if it's you're hiding things, if
[1:12:20] the devil's put unbelief there, this
[1:12:22] isn't for me. I don't believe it because
[1:12:24] I believe it's for the person sitting
[1:12:26] next to me, but I don't believe it's for
[1:12:27] me. Any kind of cloud like that over
[1:12:29] your heart, uh, is not going to give you
[1:12:32] the faith that you need to step out. It
[1:12:34] has to be a foundation of faith. So
[1:12:36] we'll talk about that real true
[1:12:37] unclouded faith from the heart. Number
[1:12:39] two, true submission from the heart.
[1:12:41] Where do I get that from? I get it from
[1:12:43] the scripture in the text that reads,
[1:12:45] "Submit yourself one to another." So
[1:12:49] submission, true, and as I say, true
[1:12:52] submission from the heart. Last week,
[1:12:54] brother U. Jack Duff a couple weeks ago,
[1:12:56] brother Jack Duff talked to the couples
[1:12:59] and he dealt with the word submission
[1:13:02] because before it says husbands, uh
[1:13:04] before it says wives, submit yourselves
[1:13:06] to your own husbands, the scripture
[1:13:08] before that doesn't get read is you're
[1:13:10] supposed to submit yourself one to
[1:13:12] another.
[1:13:13] And he broke down what Webster says
[1:13:16] about submission, which is not the true
[1:13:18] picture of it and the biblical form. I
[1:13:20] wish I would have brought it with me
[1:13:21] tonight. But it's it's to employ
[1:13:25] yourself to give your life for that
[1:13:28] other person to lay down to submit. So
[1:13:30] this submission let me just say it
[1:13:32] submission to something number one has
[1:13:34] been twisted by the world to people will
[1:13:37] say I'm not submitting to anybody
[1:13:40] including God.
[1:13:42] The other reason they don't is because
[1:13:43] they don't trust God. They don't trust
[1:13:45] people. So it ruins the true submission.
[1:13:48] But you're not going to show your care
[1:13:50] unless you show truly show I'm imploring
[1:13:53] I'm giving myself because I trust God to
[1:13:56] come on the scene. So I'm submitting to
[1:13:58] the way that he's going to speak to me.
[1:14:00] I'm submitting to whatever he exposes in
[1:14:03] my life. Though I don't like to hear it,
[1:14:05] I'm submitting to it because I trust
[1:14:07] him. You're never going to show you care
[1:14:09] to God by an unsubmissive spirit.
[1:14:13] So that's the second one. We'll we'll
[1:14:15] talk a little bit more about that.
[1:14:16] Number three, real true humility from
[1:14:19] the heart. That's in our text. He said,
[1:14:21] "Humble yourselves under the mighty hand
[1:14:23] of God." And that's the entrance to to
[1:14:26] showing you care. You've got to really
[1:14:28] humble yourself. And I want to elaborate
[1:14:31] what humility is because it's not just
[1:14:33] the word. It comes across in our actions
[1:14:35] and our words and our heart towards God
[1:14:37] that you're really humble. You don't
[1:14:38] think you got it all figured out, but
[1:14:40] God has it figured out. and you uh uh
[1:14:44] you are saying Lord I come before you
[1:14:48] and the whole thing of bowing down
[1:14:50] before the Lord uh we don't do that a
[1:14:53] lot but what it means in the Old
[1:14:55] Testament is it means humility it means
[1:14:57] bowing before him means okay I give up
[1:15:00] I'm humbling myself I can't I don't want
[1:15:03] to turn to any other source and so I'm
[1:15:06] not going to keep fighting and saying
[1:15:07] I'll figure this out I want my own way I
[1:15:10] want to make a deal with God. Come on
[1:15:13] now. People want to make a deal with
[1:15:14] God. You take care of this and I'll take
[1:15:17] care of this. Humility says, "Lord, I
[1:15:20] I'm helpless. I don't know. And I and I
[1:15:24] don't know all the answers. You might be
[1:15:26] 60 years old and you still got to be
[1:15:28] humble." I appreciate that about Brother
[1:15:30] Lonnie. He has he was a teacher, which
[1:15:33] many times he explore into great
[1:15:35] revelation things. But he would tell me,
[1:15:38] he's saying, "Yeah, I always thought
[1:15:39] that way the other day, but then God
[1:15:40] corrected me. I always thought that way,
[1:15:42] but God corrected me." That's humility
[1:15:45] at 60 years old, at 50 years old.
[1:15:47] Whatever it is is saying, "I'm still
[1:15:49] learning and I'm still correctable as a
[1:15:51] son." Humility says, "I'm correctable."
[1:15:54] Humility says, "I thought I had it
[1:15:56] figured out all these years, but Lord,
[1:15:58] I'm realizing I don't have it. I don't
[1:16:00] have me figured out yet.
[1:16:03] I thought I knew myself, but I don't
[1:16:06] really know myself. But I know a God who
[1:16:08] knows my insides and out. So now I'm
[1:16:11] coming humbled to saying, you know me,
[1:16:14] Lord, you know all my good. You know all
[1:16:16] my bad. Show me, Lord. Now I'm humility
[1:16:19] says that. So you can't show you care
[1:16:21] without true humility from the heart.
[1:16:23] Truly casting stress, anxiety, worries,
[1:16:27] and fears on him. Truly casting stress.
[1:16:30] And I'm bringing all these words because
[1:16:32] he says, "Cast your cares." And cares is
[1:16:35] related to stress, anxiety, worries, and
[1:16:38] fears. It says, "Truly come and cast all
[1:16:41] those fears upon me." Do you care about
[1:16:44] getting deliverance? If you care, you're
[1:16:46] ready to cast all those things on him.
[1:16:48] Your humility says, "I'm taking it and
[1:16:51] I'm casting it all on him. I'm throwing
[1:16:53] it all on him. I'm I'm giving it to
[1:16:56] him."
[1:16:58] You can go to other sources for your uh
[1:17:00] for your stress, but if the Lord's
[1:17:04] saying, "Bring it to me and cast it on
[1:17:06] me," then I think we ought to trust him.
[1:17:09] I think he provides a refreshment that
[1:17:11] he can relieve depression and relieve
[1:17:14] worries and relieve fears and maybe even
[1:17:18] God the creator can change your whole
[1:17:20] situation and completely relieve those
[1:17:22] worries. Is he able to do it? Amen. So
[1:17:26] it's another way we show we care by
[1:17:28] truly casting stress. Cast your all your
[1:17:30] cares upon him for he carth for you.
[1:17:32] Number
[1:17:33] five, giving more attention to him that
[1:17:37] is speaking. So the next text that
[1:17:39] brother Brandham takes is in Hebrews
[1:17:42] where it says, "See that you refuse not
[1:17:45] him that speaketh. For if the angel
[1:17:48] spoke and people rebelled against it and
[1:17:50] there was a there was a repayment for
[1:17:52] that. There was a recompense for that."
[1:17:54] Okay. He says, "How much more when the
[1:17:58] Lord speaks and his servants after him,
[1:18:00] it's the Lord speaking and you resist
[1:18:03] it." So, here's what thing you got to
[1:18:05] have if you show your care. You've got
[1:18:06] to have trust. You've got to have
[1:18:08] reverence. Giving more attention. Give
[1:18:10] more earnest heed. He says later in it,
[1:18:13] he says, uh, "Don't refuse him that
[1:18:15] speaketh." You need to give more earnest
[1:18:18] heed to who's speaking.
[1:18:21] Okay? You can look up here and say,
[1:18:23] "Well, you know, here's this minister,
[1:18:25] you know, and you can but but you see
[1:18:27] now who's speaking."
[1:18:30] And to give more attention to who it is
[1:18:33] who's speaking. You ever had a kid
[1:18:35] that's just has selective hearing? You
[1:18:37] ever give sit them down, look in the
[1:18:39] face, and give them instruction, and
[1:18:40] they look like a deer looking at
[1:18:42] headlights of your car, and they didn't
[1:18:44] get any of it. None of your kids were
[1:18:46] that way. It's just mine. But anyway,
[1:18:48] you know, it happens. And so now, can we
[1:18:50] be that way with God where we're hearing
[1:18:52] all the stuff, but we're not valuing,
[1:18:54] hey, sit still. The Lord's speaking. I
[1:18:57] think in services sometimes people would
[1:19:00] need sometimes a lot less counsel if
[1:19:02] they were really listening to what's
[1:19:04] being said by the Lord in a service and
[1:19:06] they would find answer after answer
[1:19:09] after answer to their things in life
[1:19:12] because they need a reverence. I thank
[1:19:14] God that he put a reverence in my heart
[1:19:16] and a fear of the Lord for him speaking.
[1:19:20] I thank God for it. I I you know I was
[1:19:22] thinking about this message. I said I
[1:19:24] don't I I don't want to say anything
[1:19:26] ever like some of these people were
[1:19:27] saying against the prophet and all that
[1:19:29] trying to decipher what's the human
[1:19:31] side. What's thus sayith the Lord. I
[1:19:33] just by by God's grace I just reverence
[1:19:36] all of it. Even if I may not understand
[1:19:38] all of it I reverence it. I and my mom
[1:19:40] my mom and dad taught me a lot of that
[1:19:42] too. just respect and honor and and and
[1:19:45] reverence. And even if you disagree with
[1:19:46] something, maintain your level of your
[1:19:48] fear of God, your respect of God, your
[1:19:51] reverence. You have to reverence his
[1:19:52] voice. I appreciate my mom. She's
[1:19:54] listening tonight. May God continue to
[1:19:56] heal her. But she taught me a lot of
[1:19:58] that courtesy, you know, and just right
[1:19:59] down to, you know, I don't know, if you
[1:20:02] burp, you should say, "Excuse me." You
[1:20:03] know, people don't, young generation
[1:20:05] don't do that. And I was I was riding my
[1:20:07] bike today and and that thought came to
[1:20:09] me cuz I let out a big burp while I was
[1:20:12] biking and I said, "Excuse
[1:20:15] me." And there wasn't anybody around.
[1:20:17] And I laughed at myself. You don't have
[1:20:19] to say, "Excuse me, but it's just so
[1:20:22] routine for me." Now, I've been around
[1:20:24] some of I won't say I won't say who they
[1:20:27] are, but this generation, they just let
[1:20:28] out a big thing. And the girls let it
[1:20:31] out and there's no excuse me, there's no
[1:20:33] pardon me, there's nothing.
[1:20:35] And girls can do it better than boys
[1:20:38] sometimes. It's incredible. It's like,
[1:20:40] wow, where did that come from? But
[1:20:42] anyway, I was taught a little bit of
[1:20:44] say, you know, I'm sorry, excuse me. And
[1:20:46] I was saying it on the bike today and
[1:20:48] there wasn't anybody around and I
[1:20:49] realized, well, my mommy taught me
[1:20:53] well. I think there needs to be a
[1:20:56] reverence and give more attention.
[1:21:00] This is how how we show we
[1:21:03] care. You write down to a service like
[1:21:05] this. I'm closing in a minute. I've only
[1:21:06] been an hour. Right down to a service, a
[1:21:08] Wednesday night service is just us here
[1:21:10] tonight and those who are listening. But
[1:21:12] you know what? I know you're tired and
[1:21:15] body, but sometimes we can let our minds
[1:21:18] just travel
[1:21:20] uh what we're going to do tomorrow and
[1:21:22] the pressures of life. I think we should
[1:21:24] give a more earnest attention to who it
[1:21:28] is speaking when he's speaking. Now, I'm
[1:21:30] not talking about myself. I'm talking
[1:21:31] about the Lord. The Lord of heaven is
[1:21:34] speaking something. And we should give
[1:21:37] reverence and attention to that. That
[1:21:39] shows we care. How many want to show you
[1:21:42] care before God? Number six,
[1:21:45] perseverance that will not run away or
[1:21:48] hide. A real perseverance. You're
[1:21:50] showing God you care by a perseverance
[1:21:53] that's not running away or hiding, but
[1:21:56] you're coming towards I'm going to read
[1:21:58] you the first two quotes and he cares do
[1:22:00] you care before he starts preaching a
[1:22:02] sermon he gives two incidences the first
[1:22:04] one I don't have time to read them
[1:22:05] tonight the first one shows a couple
[1:22:07] young couple just married their
[1:22:09] perseverance drove all the way to New
[1:22:12] York and something happened the devil
[1:22:15] jumped on him they turned around and
[1:22:17] drove all the way back not even knowing
[1:22:20] if they can meet get with the prophet
[1:22:21] had a
[1:22:23] motel and you know it it showed they
[1:22:26] were willing to do whatever whatever it
[1:22:27] took. They weren't hiding and say,
[1:22:29] "Well, we'll get over this." They wanted
[1:22:30] to get to to a minister of God. And that
[1:22:34] shows perseverance that they were not
[1:22:36] running away from it. They weren't
[1:22:37] hiding from it. Their perseverance,
[1:22:40] we've got to get to the bottom of this.
[1:22:42] That shows you care. Okay. Number seven,
[1:22:45] similar desperation that won't give up.
[1:22:48] And that's another story of a woman who
[1:22:50] waited nine years to get an interview
[1:22:52] with brother Brandham. Nine years. and
[1:22:54] finally got to talk to him, I think, in
[1:22:57] the parking lot. Desperation that won't
[1:23:00] give up shows that we care. After 9
[1:23:03] years, she's waiting to make a
[1:23:06] connection with the Lord to speak to her
[1:23:08] and she's willing to wait that long and
[1:23:10] she's going to stay with it. She's going
[1:23:12] to be desperate until she Listen, these
[1:23:16] are ways that we show we care. How many
[1:23:18] raise your hand say, "I know God cares."
[1:23:21] But these are ways that we create the
[1:23:23] right atmosphere for a God creator to
[1:23:26] step into your situation. It welcomes
[1:23:28] him. If God can see, we're going to get
[1:23:30] some more, but if God can see these,
[1:23:32] there's more and he cares. Do you care
[1:23:34] if God can see this? Brother Brandham
[1:23:36] gets into the middle of the message. He
[1:23:38] said, "We don't have honest confession
[1:23:40] today. We don't have sincere confession
[1:23:44] and that's why God can't come on the
[1:23:45] scene." Amen. So there are elements here
[1:23:48] that we show we care and also we're
[1:23:51] creating an atmosphere so the creator
[1:23:56] can feel welcome to come and change the
[1:23:58] situation. Praise the Lord. God bless
[1:24:01] you. Let's stand
[1:24:03] together.
[1:24:05] Amen. Trust you enjoyed the word
[1:24:07] tonight. Praise the Lord. Many, many
[1:24:10] rich things the Lord has blessed us
[1:24:12] with. Can you say amen? Praise the Lord.
[1:24:15] I just love
[1:24:17] it. Okay, so just before we pray, just
[1:24:20] remember to bring your lunch Sunday with
[1:24:22] you. Um the fridge space will be
[1:24:25] limited, so please plan accordingly and
[1:24:28] bring a cooler if needed. We will only
[1:24:30] have one hour for lunch. So that's after
[1:24:34] the second session. Uh just please trust
[1:24:38] me on this. I know it sounds strange and
[1:24:40] out of the box to make Sunday morning
[1:24:42] sessions, for lack of a better term.
[1:24:44] Please don't join the maybe some of the
[1:24:47] criticism I would get said what in the
[1:24:49] world is he doing sessions for on a
[1:24:50] Sunday morning this is out of the box
[1:24:52] understand just trust me on this I
[1:24:54] believe it'll be some good teaching
[1:24:57] so just do this do this this day but
[1:24:59] bring your lunch Sunday and then after
[1:25:01] the second session but we will provide
[1:25:03] some I think some coffee and snacks for
[1:25:06] the breaks in between the sessions that
[1:25:08] we can refresh ourselves that way in
[1:25:10] between them. Amen. We will only have
[1:25:13] one hour for lunch. Praise the Lord.
[1:25:16] Amen. Well, saints, let's pray together
[1:25:18] tonight before we close and go home. And
[1:25:22] I trust that the Lord has spoke to you
[1:25:24] tonight. I know he's spoken to me. I I
[1:25:27] know that I know I serve a God who cares
[1:25:29] for your needs. I know I serve a God
[1:25:32] that is a creator of heavens and earth.
[1:25:35] Amen. And how many would desire say help
[1:25:37] me to create the right atmosphere that
[1:25:40] God can step in? That is our desire Lord
[1:25:43] Jesus. We are grateful Lord for these
[1:25:47] truths and to take these things right
[1:25:49] from your very word Lord the scriptures
[1:25:52] and to be able to understand the
[1:25:54] approach to God. How you want us to
[1:25:56] approach you. Even the priest in the Old
[1:25:58] Testament had to come before that Holy
[1:26:00] of Holies a certain way, dressed a
[1:26:02] certain way, acting a certain way. And
[1:26:04] Lord, if everything was just right that
[1:26:06] way, then your your shana came down. And
[1:26:10] Lord God, we learn the approach now
[1:26:11] today from a a little message the
[1:26:14] prophet gave, but yet it's not little.
[1:26:15] It's a real key to approach, a key to
[1:26:19] our lives. He cares, but do you care? Oh
[1:26:23] God, may we show we care. May we show
[1:26:25] you with our life, with our words, with
[1:26:28] our heart. May we show you everything,
[1:26:31] Lord, that would say to you. We care
[1:26:34] about being a people of deliverance and
[1:26:36] freedom. We we we care that we want to
[1:26:39] be free in our minds and free in our
[1:26:41] hearts. We care for our children. We
[1:26:43] care for our lives, Lord. We care that
[1:26:47] you would come and create in us
[1:26:49] everything that's needed, Lord. and even
[1:26:51] rapturing faith. We want to create an
[1:26:53] atmosphere to receive more of that
[1:26:56] revelation. We commit the service to you
[1:26:58] now, Lord. And may you bless hearts and
[1:27:01] all that would hear that it have a
[1:27:02] trickle down effect like just a ripple,
[1:27:05] Lord, on an ocean on the waves. May it
[1:27:08] keep going and keep going. And Lord,
[1:27:10] your word will not return void. Let it
[1:27:13] do its work. We pray in Jesus name we
[1:27:16] ask it. Amen. Praise the Lord. He carth
[1:27:19] for you.
[1:27:24] He
[1:27:26] carth for
[1:27:28] [Music]
[1:27:30] you
[1:27:32] through
[1:27:34] sunshine or shadows.
[1:27:40] Oh,
[1:27:41] he
[1:27:43] carth for
[1:27:45] [Music]
[1:27:49] you.
[1:27:51] He
[1:27:53] car for you.
[1:28:01] He
[1:28:03] carth for
[1:28:05] [Music]
[1:28:08] you all
[1:28:11] through
[1:28:13] sunshine or
[1:28:18] shadow.
[1:28:21] He
[1:28:23] careth for you.
[1:28:27] Jesus loves me. This I
[1:28:32] know. For the
[1:28:36] Bible tells me so. Oh, they're so ones
[1:28:44] to him

[1:29:41] wash away my
[1:29:45] sin. Let his

[1:30:15] Bible tells me so.
[1:30:20] Amen.
[1:30:23] Jesus loves me. Loves me
[1:30:28] still. Though I'm
[1:30:31] very weak and
[1:30:35] it from his
[1:30:39] shine thrown on
[1:30:42] high comes to watch me. Yes.
[1:30:49] Hallelujah. He loves you tonight. If
[1:30:51] you're
[1:30:51] homesick, remember that he loves you
[1:30:53] tonight. Loves me. He really loves me.
