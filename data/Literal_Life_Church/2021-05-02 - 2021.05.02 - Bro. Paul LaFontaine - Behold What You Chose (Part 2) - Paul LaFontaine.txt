========================================

lord and we believe the lord is with us in guiding us and giving us leadership uh one of the last services full services actually the last full service that brother branham preached was leadership i think it's very significant that that's the last thing he said because if we live here just another as we're living here another 40 50 60 years which we didn't expect the one thing that we need more than ever is holy ghost leadership we need it every day can you say man and uh if you turn with me to first samuel we're going to continue to talk about leadership a little bit again and i'd like to continue on a little bit in talking about saul today and the people's choice for leadership in their lives we're going to turn to first samuel chapter 12 and we'll just read from a couple verses there and you might want to keep your bibles handy we're going to just refer to several scriptures if you didn't want to do that i'm sure they'll be able to put it up if they keep up with me upstairs there and put the scriptures up so you can read them on the screen first samuel chapter 12 and we read this a couple weeks ago because just talking about god telling the people to behold the king they've chosen verse 12 says and when you saw that nahash the king of the children of ammon came against you you said unto me nay but a king shall reign over us when the lord your god was your kin the lord your god was your king now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen behold the king you have chosen and whom ye have desired and behold the lord hath set a king over you so we're taking that now the the prophet saying here's your king you've chosen behold the king whom you have chosen and whom ye have desired so this was their desire to have a king like this that resembled the other nations this is all their desire this is all their choosing and god told them that therefore behold the king whom you have chosen and the one that you have desired let's pray heavenly father we pray that you help us lord to stand firm upon the word of god today heavens and earth will pass away but your word is eternal lord god it is the stability it is the strength it is the lord the the the stronghold against the enemy and father i pray that you'll use your word as it's thus saith the lord spoken by the prophets lord it is thus saith the lord and thus it has the power in it to be able to transform to be able to change to be able to stabilize families to be able to bring the holy ghost and bring salvation whatever we need is in the word of god so i trust every age group here this morning would give attention to it in our busy lives that we have lord we we don't give enough attention all of us lord would say we don't give enough attention to the word of god so when we have these moments we want to seize the opportunity lord and just sit quietly at your feet and hear what you want to tell us this morning bless every heart we thank you for healing our brother lord and to for his report that's come back clean we thank you for answering prayer lord and all the other things that you're doing answering prayer left and right just so many things we don't want to overlook it but we want to lord give the devil a black eye and show him that the power of god is working in the people of god the faith of god is working in the people and lord we can go to your atonement and trust in your blood and your healing through calvary we're thankful for it lord and we just pray you'll give us boldness and the spirit of god today to minister your word and we ask it in jesus name amen god bless you each one as you're seated this morning now we want to speak this is part two of behold the king that you chose behold the king that you chose part two and we realized that israel desired something and i'm going to have them pull up a quote it'd be the only quote that i have today but i was listening to a service yesterday called the rejected king and this incidentally is when the prophet introduces that whole picture of israel rejecting the king and it wasn't just the prophet because the prophet samuel said to the people to tell the people god said you have not rejected me because the prophet was saying they've they want a king and they've rejected me as god's prophet but god said you have not rej they have not rejected you samuel they've rejected me so in choosing their own king they actually rejected the king of kings that's that's quite a choice in choosing their own choosing they rejected and so listen to it if you can and rejected king but i'm going to read a few things from it as he says it was a time that is in all times that people has never wanted god to lead them they want their own way of leadership and this story this morning and when you go to your home it would be good for you to read it all the way through it was during the time of the days of samuel the man of god the prophet and he had been a just man a good man honorable reputable true and honest with the people never deceiving them telling them nothing but straight thus saith the lord but the people had come to a place where they wanted to change this program they had looked upon the philistines and the amalekites and amorites and hittites and the other nations of the world and they had seen that they had kings that ruled them and governed them and guided them and fought their battles and so forth and this seemed to be that israel wanted to pattern themselves like these kings and like these people but it has never been in any age god's intention for his people to act like the people of the world or to be governed or controlled like the people of the world god's people as always has been a peculiar people a different people a called out a separated and all together different in their action in their ways in their manner of living than what the peoples of the world has so let's make it real clear this morning is that this is the lesson out of this is that israel wanted to be like the other nations but as christians we're not to be like other nations we're to be different in our manner of life our home should be different our dress should be different our conversation should be different can you say man and we're just like israel if we start to get on the internet and start to copy what the world is doing and still want to be a christian you need to know god has blessed us to be a peculiar people a different people we don't take our cues from what everybody else is saying and doing we take our cues from the word of god you know a lot sometimes especially young people but a lot of people they don't get out of that mode that childish mode that they don't want to be different they don't want to look different they don't want that word peculiar they want to fit in with the world but once you go into revelation you realize it's a blessing to be called to be a christian to be different in this world i don't want to be a statistic i don't want to be like them be somebody different dare to be different young person i dare you to be different than the world i dare you to give your life to christ and be different than the world it doesn't take very much for you to fit in with what they're doing everybody's doing that the crowd's doing it but what it takes is the holy ghost chris field christian to say listen i don't mind being different for the lord i don't mind expressing the image of god can i get a bigger amen than that and so he finishes he says god's people has always been a peculiar people different people are called out separated all together different in their action in their ways in their manner of living than what the peoples of the world has their appetites for things and all that their makeup is has always been it has been always contrary to the things of the people of the world and he goes on later to say the people said after samuel said if if you get this king he's going to do this he's going to do he's going to take your daughters he's going to take your sons and put them in the war he said all the stuff that's going to happen and the people said but we still want to be like the rest of the people there's something about men and women that they long to be like one another now that's a profound statement and we don't know all the reasons why but we got six thousand years of history to see that human beings have something in them that they want to be like somebody else like another human being and then we come along in the lord and and the prophet says jesus was the perfect example if you're going to pattern your life after somebody pattern it after jesus christ i want to be like him but there's something in our nature and i wish i had just another time to talk about comparisons to talk about this thing in our human nature to want to be like everybody else it starts when we're young we're disappointed with the way we look how god made us and so we do all these things to try to copy some sports star some movie star or someone even that we're we like in the church that dresses better than us and we start copying because there's something in us that wants to be somebody else other than ourselves and then we get older and we think we get out of it but we don't get out of it because the neighbor will get something the neighbor get a nice new deck and all of a sudden you'll see the next neighbor get a nice new deck ain't that right my daughter's smiling at me because once she started to do all of her stuff in the backyard her neighbor's doing more in her backyard ever since ryan started to do it and it's just this brother brown called it comparisons he says we're always trying to copy we're always trying to be like someone else someone gets a swimming pool and all the rest of the in the neighborhood everybody's got to get one and so there's something in human nature and god has to deal with this in our lives because even as christians we can strive and have such a drive in our lives but we better check our motives for what we do because if our motive is rooted to be like the world and to be accepted and to be praised and and to do it for that reason it's the wrong motive we would be just as wrong as israel to say we want a king like other nations we want our church to be like other churches we want to have all this modern stuff going on and we want all this stuff listen we're not interested in copying any other church i remember when i was a when we just started the church being a young man and just learning and different things and by the way i'm still learning actually sometimes i feel like i don't have a clue what i'm doing the more we grow we realize what we don't know and we we know less and less but when i started i wanted to be like and i was invited certain places you know and brother biscuits and brother donny reagan's in different places you know and it seems like that they were had the things and they had a nice function there and all that so as a young man you know you try to copy yourself just we're going to do this we're going to do that we're going to make it just like then i'll tell you the lord corrected me in such a such a straight way one time after a few years of that and he just spoke to my heart says i haven't called you to do what they're doing i haven't called you to copy yourself after what you think is the right way to do it in the message i've got a vision for you what to do with the people in this area and how to teach the people in this area can you say amen and boy the lord corrected me you don't compare you don't copy well there's church this message church this is doing this that's the way this preacher does it and i've shared with you before you got to remember when i was married my wife came for brother donnie reagan's church and because i'm his friend i can say this publicly my wife came from brother donnie reagan's church and so she moved to mine and i became her pastor but i was kind of just jokingly saying she had two pastors for a very long time it was me and brother donnie even though she was here because i was always compared with how brother donnie does things anybody got a wife like that anybody got a husband that's always comparing you with the other how clean the other houses are in the church i hope not oh and and all of a sudden you can't it's just as quiet as ever nothing worse than being you being compared with somebody but you know that took that was a little while and then i think after a while she just had my wife just had one pastor which is a blessing but i would sometimes i just say to her you know i just say but you know he he did it this way well i'm not brother donnie and he's doing what he's called to do and look man is the lord blessed it but if i try to copy someone else it will be blessed if you try to copy somebody else it won't be blessed because god hasn't called you to do that can you say amen god has gifts within you god has things within you and we live our lives this is such a profound statement he says there's something about men and women they long to be like one another but when we get the holy ghost we say god i want to be like the nature of christ i want to be like the lord i want to follow what is your example and your identity can be found in the word your identity in jesus christ so you don't live your whole life trying to be some other brother some other sister can i get an amen this morning praise the lord so we have to do something brother brad says check our motives for what we do check your mode everybody say that check your motives that's a quote check your motives we should always be doing it notice he doesn't say check your actions not check your actions motives are deeper than actions what you do and what you say is your actions but there's a motive for what you do there's a motive for what you choose there's a motive for what you wear so when he says check your motives it's not checking your actions it's checking what's your motive for doing it and are you copying somebody can you say that everyone has a personal responsibility to say lord i want to check my motive for doing this what's my motive and if it's tainted a little bit with i want to be like somebody else i'm trying to be praised from the people i'm trying to look good in the world standards you ought to ask the lord to purge that motive because it's the wrong motive you want your character to be expressed sisters be pretty be pretty but don't emphasize the outward so much that the n-word is smothered out god is featured in character and when you when you are have the character of the holy ghost in christ it will reflect in what you wear can you say amen so it's choices we make and i'm about to move swiftly along along today because i there's a point at the end i want to get to but we got to talk a little bit about this i'd like to delve deeper into saul's life and quickly because many of you read this and if you haven't read all this this section of the bible brother brahm says it in the quote you should take some time and read it all the way through when saul's anointed read what happened afterwards and watch in the two or three years that he's king watch things come out of him that become the fruit that become the the actions of their choice and and it's why god's saying behold your choice behold this is what you choose and they started to watch characteristics come out of saul they realize we have made the biggest mistake what have we done because they realized they wanted a king to go with them in battle they wanted a leader they want somebody to leave their lives but they didn't realize they didn't judge it by the character that was in him and if we're not judging things in our decisions by character we're going to get in trouble i said we're going to get in trouble and i talked a few weeks ago about marriage and choosing of a bride such a significant message brother brown preached the choosing of a bride because christ is choosing a bride at the last days the kind of bride he's choosing but it goes down to couples and young ones that would choose that's a second most important decision in your life you better pray you better have the holy ghost both of you can you and i'm not threatening you saying that i said that's what you need to do you need to say lord help me to choose the character of the word in my mate then brother branson if she's pretty fine but choose character first how does she relate to the word of god how does she respond to the word of god brother brad says a pretty spirit will come here in meetings like this and sit and listen to the word of god and respond to it and give her life to god that's a pretty spirit and then if she's pretty naturally well you get a double bonus praise the lord so i want to talk about saul a little bit and i hope you have a lot of time because i'd like to i'd like to talk about him behold your choice it reveals so much when we see over time what saul manifested and there's a principle here that we we also learn it's actually a law and that's the law that you're familiar with the law of soul reaping and sowing sowing and reaping we reap what we sow and what we sow is decisions many times we sow decisions we make decisions every day and all of those decisions we will reap a harvest from those decisions whether good or whether bad how many believes in the law of sowing and reaping how many has lived out the law of sowing and reaping amen so it's a law you can't get around it that's thinking about the laws of god and the laws of nature you can't change these laws they work whether you get a good harvest or you get a bad harvest everybody's under the same laws you're a 16 year old boy you're under the same law of sowing and reaping your dad is i'm under the same law everybody's the same so you make decisions as a 16 year old boy you're going to reap from what you sowed in those years oh he's sowing his wild oats give him time he's sowing his wild oats well every wild oats that he sows he's going to reap a harvest from it so it'd be good to catch this law when you're young about 14 13 even 12 it'd be good to catch this law this applies to you if you sold the wrong seeds in your life you're going to have a harvest from it you're going to reap what you saw oh you might embarrass your parents and every other thing but you're the one that sold the wrong seed you're going to reap a harvest but it goes both ways the law works when we sow good things in our lives the law still works we sow the right principles and we stay close to the word of god we're going to reap a harvest from that we're going to reap a good holy ghost-filled mate from that we're going to reap a good marriage from that we're going to reap a good family from that the decisions you make now when you're young so now you reap what you sow you will you will eventually see the fruit i'd like you guys to turn up proverbs chapter 1 if you would verse 24. you will eventually see the fruit of your choices god this is how it is now listen god will let you see clearly over time the fruit of your own choices and he says here turn you go back to 23 if you would turn you at my reproof a reproof is a rebuke a reproof is a a correction and he's saying you should listen to my correction you should listen to my rebuke turn you at my reproof behold i will pour out my spirit unto you i will make known my words unto you next because i have called and ye refused i have stretched out my hand and no man regarded so this is someone who's rejecting the reproof and the counsel of god i've i've stretched out my hand to you i've given counsel but ye have said it not all my counsel you you won't listen to my counsel and with none of my reproof and i i also will laugh at your calamity so when calamity comes and you eat of that i will laugh your calamity i will mock when your fear cometh when your fear cometh that's desolation and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind when distress and anguish cometh upon you then shall they call upon me but i will not answer they shall seek me early but they shall not find me this is why this is a serious thing because you can reach a point where where you so push god's counsel off that that i know god is always listening but it appear to you now god says go back to the other one if you would go back to what then shall they call people but i will not answer they shall seek me early but they shall not find me that's a serious state to be in you can cross the line where you turn down counsel enough that all of a sudden god withdraws a little bit so the next one says for they that hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the lord the next one they would none of my counsel they despised all my reproof next one therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way first person i heard preach on this was brother lonnie jenkins and so open up the word to me therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way they're going to not just see the fruit of their own way and their own choice but they're going to eat the fruit of it not the fruit of the lord not the fruits of the spirit you're going to eat of your own fruit therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way and be filled with their own devices is this this this is a scripture to really ponder you're going to eat of your own devices the cell phone the internet you feed on the wrong things you might eat of your own devices devices can get us into trouble all the new devices can get us into trouble but you keep feeding on certain things you eat of your own devices your own plans your own way israel wanted their own king eventually there's a principle that if you keep going that direction you're over time you're going to see the fruit of your decisions and you're going to eat of the fruit of your own way there's another scripture brother lonnie brought up and this is an extreme one but it's the truth in romans chapter one if you guys would bring up romans 1 but this is the same principle and he brought it up i thought it was amazing romans 1 verse 21 romans 1 verse 21 if you had that because that when they knew god they glorified not as god neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened professing themselves to be wise they became fools and changed the glory of the incorrupted god into an image made like unto corruptable man and to birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things wherefore god also gave them up to uncleanness now catch that that's what brother lonnie read after a while god gave them up to what they wanted god gave them up to their uncleanness through the lust of their own hearts to dishonor their own bodies between themselves so we have it happen in a day people turn so far away from god the only thing left of this lust and women lust towards women men lust towards men you know why they do that because god has removed anything from them to keep them from doing it because they wanted it so bad god just gave them up to it i don't want to be in that state who change the truth of god into a lie and worship and serve the creature more than creator who is blessed forever amen for this cause god gave them up unto vile affections for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature so this is the second time he says god gave them up god gave them up and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the women burned in their lust one toward another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompense of their heir which was meat and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge god gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient listen there's something being said in this scripture is that there's certain protections and certain things that god can keep you from through his counsel and through his word but if you keep fighting for your own way and going in this case towards lust lust lust turning god's reproof down there's a place god gives you up god gives you up and god gives you over even to a reprobate mind now that's an extreme case i pray none of us would reach there but the potential is there god just says you're going to eat of your own fruit of your own way now you just go right ahead it's very uh jolting for me to hear brother lonnie speak on these things it helped me as a young christian man to realize this is the world without god and turns god down doesn't want god in their knowledge you don't do that without fruits coming from it sin debauchery lust and then all that comes from the homosexual lesbian and all these other things but where did it start somebody turned down the reproof and corrections of god and finally god said i have tried my best to keep warning you over and over again and don't forget god can warn you through a donkey if he has to i said god can warn you through anything but it's mostly the word of god but if he's giving you a reproof that's god's protection you better listen to it because if you keep turning it down i'm going to take my own choice my own way then this is the type of things that comes from it can you say amen that closes that part now let's move to saul if you turn with me in the bible to first samuel chapter 10. i want you to notice something here and we're studying the word together i may not get to preach this as much as just teach just a little bit here because i want to see just a few things i pulled out first samuel chapter 10 and verse 6. it says here a couple things that were interesting and the spirit of the lord will come upon these talking to saul and thou shalt prophesy with them with the other prophets and shalt be turned into another man and then if you go down to verse 9 and it was so that when he had turned his back to go from samuel god gave saul another heart and all those signs came to pass that day now i thought this was interesting because the people chose saul to be the king for them they did not choose on character they did not choose on the heart like david was saul was not a man after god's own heart but the people wanted him because remember we talked about it he was head and shoulders above the rest he was tall dark and handsome and david was small fair freckleheaded and ruddy so the people chose by looks remember that and so so then they chose him because of his looks but there was no heart and look what god has to look at all god has to do to this guy just to make it work for israel he's got a he's got to turn he shall turn he shall be turned into another man and god gave him another heart he didn't even have in his heart what was needed to lead the people correctly he didn't have none of it and god somehow said because it's your choice i'm going to change this man's heart and make him another man on the inside because he has nothing that i need on the inside to lead god's people and sometimes friends it reminds me of not just the lesson of choosing the wrong leadership and choosing something wrong to lead you but it reminds us to say this statement you can be you can put on on the outside the message you can turn yourself into another man and wear all the right clothes and say all the right things if you grew up in the message you know how to act but how terrible it is when you have to be changed from what you really are in the inside the seed laying on the inside for david he had something within him already and if you work off of that you got a seed on the inside you don't transform yourself into some putting something on the outside you let that seed grow on the inside by the holy ghost and you will by nature be who you are i'm not going to spend more time on that but it's something for you to look at and study that god actually had to go so far as to take their choice he looked at that and looked at his heart and said he has nothing within him that i can use to lead my people but because you chose him i'm gonna have to change the man that he is i'm gonna have to change his heart to make this work for you it's incredible and so they wanted this though so bad they they turned god turned him into another man gave him another heart then we never see those scriptures in david where god had to change his heart or change him into another man he was the man god had for the job he was all he already had what he needed anything god doesn't choose in your life are you listening you must be because it's quiet don't forget i got a i got a real good part at the end end of this this might be convicting here but i got a real good ending to this sermon and i hope you all stay for it you're hanging on aren't you this is going to end really good but i got to just really plow here a while to show us we can see the decisions we make and we can learn from them and god lets us behold and learn from them david didn't need to change himself he already had what he needed anything god doesn't choose in your life becomes put on it becomes phony can i make that point out of that scripture if it's not god's choice and it's your own you have to make it work and even god's making it work and it becomes phony it becomes put on you had to make saul into a different guy and you have to keep being phony but with god if you get a hold of what god wants in your life it's real it's genuine it's the seed weighing within you how many want something real this is literal life church the real life it's the reality it's not anything put on it's the real deal god when he does something and his choice in your life it's not he doesn't have to put on anything it's real from the very core of what it is i want to be a real christian i want to be real can you when i make a mistake i want to be real say god i've made a mistake i want to read a genuine holy ghost-filled christian i don't want to be phony and put everything on in front of everybody to try to meet all the other things and what people want in my life i want it to be from my heart i want to love this message from my heart and i want it to be real nothing put on can you say it because my god is real my god is real he's really real in my soul my god is real for he has washed and made me whole his blood for me is like pure gold my god is real for i can feel him in my soul god is real his people are real what they have within him is not phony it's the real seed of god it's the real holy ghost you don't have to put on anything somebody say praise the lord say god i want the real thing god i don't want you to have to work around all my decisions and make it work and make it look holy change somebody no god shouldn't have to do that if it's the real heart of christ the heart of david it will do the right thing because it is what it is so we look at saul now real quickly what did he produce over time even though he was anointed what did he produce in his life you don't see it in the first year of his life everything was going good he was winning battles he seemed to be a good captain of the army he seen me going but it was over time you begin to see things pop up in saul brother samuel browning brought him out friday night here while he was preaching but over time you see the character of saul pop out and start to manifest itself i'm just going to summarize because most of you probably in sunday school heard the stories of saul and what he did one significant one is he disobeyed god with what the prophet told him to to do but there's a couple other things here that show his character and so why am i saying them and let me just summarize this by saying israel chose someone because this is what i found yesterday when i was studying this in the summary of what saul really was and what he was doing israel chose someone to lead them that slowly moved away from god's true prophet and now we can preach on that israel chose leadership in their life that they didn't recognize would slowly move them away from god's prophet and obey god's prophet now don't we have a world full of influences and leadership like that never mind denominations in our own ranks we have people become leaders and if you choose their leadership they seem like such a fine christian and all that be careful because the agenda is to lead you away from the authority of the prophet of god i didn't discover that till last night until i was studying i said my look at this and here here's what happens first samuel 9 9. just let me lay in a principle here okay let me say any other leadership you choose besides the holy ghost in your life will lead you away from the word of god that a prophet brought i'm going to say this again any other leadership you choose in your life to lead your life if it's not the holy ghost it will lead you away from the word of a true prophet that's its main agenda to disqualify it to discredit it to disrespect it now how important was the prophet back in saul's day for samuel 9 9 do you have that brother first samuel 9 9 says before time in israel when a man went to inquire of god thus he spake come and let us go to the seer for he that is now called a prophet was before time called a seer so those that who went to inquire the lord and listen now we're still human beings we have questions and so once you have a question about anything in life you're going to inquire if you're smart you should inquiring minds want to know you're going to inquire and when the people in israel wanted to inquire they went to a man called the seer it was now called a prophet now it switched over to a prophet but because he could see he was used of the lord to see things we can't see they depended i said can i set up an interview with the seer they called him a seer because i have some questions i'd like to know some things and it was so important that's the source that you went to if you had a question and wanted to inquire about something back in that day you set up an interview with the seer or the prophet you said this is what i need to know can the lord show you anything because god could bless that man where he could see and get the right answer this is what you should do this is where you should go this is where you should move this is what should take place it was a blessing to have that can you say amen and so that was the spirit so this is a principle that's established is that we should live our lives we should live our lives as they did and that is we should consult the lord and his word about things that we're inquiring about i would do everything you can in your decisions financial decisions family decisions decisions about who to marry whatever it is i would use this principle that you're looking for the word of god from the prophet that has eyesight to see beyond what you can see the counsel of the lord consulting the lord millions of decisions are made every day without the counsel of the lord but this is what israel did when we got to inquire about something let me be basic about it we still do it but when there was a question in our family about something should we do this should we have this should we do and just counseling other families say if they ask me what should i do research the word get your bible and get the message search program and search everything that the prophet said about it and every scripture you can find and after you've done all that pray about it and then make a decision for your family but don't you dare make a decision without reading everything that you can in the word about about it because why the word is still a seer the word has discernment that's the z say well we don't have a prophet living today but listen we've got a bible that's full of the prophets and god blessed us with the prophet in the end time and preserved it that we can find out what he said about thee you'd be surprised what the prophet of this hour says about a lot of things somebody one time was trying to justify a social drink i don't think it's wrong to have a social drinking now now again every once in a while i think that's our personal liberty and paul did it and they always bring the scriptures up and all these other things and so i don't think it's wrong to do that what do you think so i just went back to the house and me and becca said well we need to find out and all the way back early on he just makes a little comment he says some of you christians think that you can take a little social drink i mean it was the exact words the person asked me about it's getting quiet in here and there it was now for us i don't know what that person did i gave them the quote it's up to them it's their own choice but for our family that's all we needed just a little hint i'm not going to try to get into what paul drank and there was no water back then that was good so they had to drink wine and all these other things for social i'm not going to get into that discussion god sent to me a prophet in this hour and the way that he leaned us towards that's what i want to do drinking any kind of alcohol today has no good connotation for your testimony can you say amen and that's why the prophet probably said we stay away from it as christians because of what it represents it's not so much the alcohol because when you take nyquil you're pretty pumped up with it but if i order a drink in front of everybody or try to do it privately just with a few people i've got the whole testimony of everything that represents and i value my testimony so i'm not going to get into this discussion about what paul drank back in the bible i got a prophet at this hour that lead me in the right direction and i'm comfortable with it people struggle with that oh you're giving him too much authority i don't struggle with it at all i'm thankful to have a word from a prophet i'm thankful to have some type of absolute to tie me back to the absolute of the word god and most the time he's quoting a scripture to tie us back to avoid the very appearance of evil man this isn't in my notes this is free this morning avoid the very appearance of evil so i could give a hundred more examples of stuff like that that people ask me about this that even like the bedroom you know and i'm not going to talk about that but just like the bedroom and the privacy of the bedroom and you know what this and what to wear and all this stuff listen you have to pray but don't you dare make a decision based upon what the world does or what you see in magazines or what the leaders of the world said this is okay to do get your bible get in a spirit of prayer with your wife your husband and your family and get into that message every one of you can have it on an app now and do a search within seconds on every subject and every word it's a pitiful shame when people won't search they don't want to know what the prophet says probably but i encourage you as families and heads of your home if you're going to base your life on the word of god you grab your bible you grab that message and say we're going to base this home on what the word of god says we're going to consult the lord in the old time when people inquired of the lord they sought out the seer to get answers everybody understand we're blessed today to have the word preserved for us that we can search and find out what he said about it so first samuel chapter 11 says 11 7 first samuel 11 7 and you took a oak of oxen and hewed them in pieces and sent them throughout the coast of israel by the hands of messengers saying whosoever cometh not forth after saul and after samuel so shall it be done unto his auction and the fear of the lord fell on the people and they came out of one consent brother brahm commented on this scripture this is the first little sign you see of saul and he's actually been told of the lord to speak because there's an army coming against them and they're going to do all this stuff but he saw in his own there's a there's a tad of arrogance showing here because he cuts up an oxen hewed them in pieces sent them throughout all the coaster of israel by the hands of messages saying whosoever cometh not forth after saul and after samuel so shall it be done unto his oxen and the fear of the lord fought on the people did anybody notice that early on he's using his name first before the prophet now that might not seem very much and we might be getting technical here but to me it says something about the way he's thinking i'm the leader now and so i'm going to put a fear over the people but it's not just going to be the fear of the prophet's word i'm going to put my name in there you need to fear me too you need to fear me and he actually puts his name before the prophet might not be a big thing but it's the start of him going all the way over one or two years later where he just basically disobeys what the prophet said how many knows he did that where does it start well here he is putting himself in front of him and putting his self before the people he was self-centered as brother sam browning preached he was self-centered he only cared about himself his own kingdom he started to build up his own kingdom and so it's very subtle here but it showed his character coming out first samuel 13 8-11 i'm moving through these quickly first samuel 13 8-11 and he carried seven days according to the set time that sammy had appointed but samuel came not to gilgal and the people were scattered from him and saul said bring hither a burnt offering to me and peace offerings and he burnt the offer and he offered the burnt offering and it came to pass that as soon as he made the end of the offering the burnt offering behold samuel came and saul went out to meet him that he might salute him and samuel said what hast thou done so we stop right there we understand from whatever we have read in the scripture in sunday school whatever here's what samuel did the second thing that shows that something's wrong is that is when he got impatient and when samuel didn't show up quick enough there was an army coming on him he felt the pressure to make a decision quickly and so now in in patience he don't wait for the prophet to get there to bring the sacrifice he says bring it and i'll do it myself it's pretty serious he's stepping out of his position prophet was supposed to do that so once again it's this disrespect i don't need the prophet i can do this on my own now friends be careful of the leadership that you choose in your life that's saying the same thing subtly you know you can function just fine there's a message the minister who left the message the other day said something to one of our people here i just said grieve my heart it's a typical message believer he was slamming them for putting brother branham what brother brahman said just slamming him for a typical message believer i felt like saying to him okay i'm a typical message believer and i'm not ashamed of it but that little subtle thing says you know what he said i'm functioning fine believing in the blood of jesus christ i'm functioning fine and i don't have to acknowledge what he said that's fine you have a it's a free country you have liberty to do it but a man that used to preach this message and i guarantee you he knows more than that on the inside he's just taken another spirit slamming the sisters for quoting the prophet of god that we love and we believe that led us in this hour and the holy ghost is still leading us through the word that he spoke and the ministers are speaking for him to belittle that that's pretty sad it all stayed respectful i i watched it it was respectful but those little subtle things there to to throw out you know you can do this and ditch the whole idea of this prophet that's what saul's doing give me that sacrifice i can't wait you know what else it speaks of everybody listening an unaccountable relationship an unaccountable life if i get in a jam i can go do it myself and once again not consult the lord not wait on the lord don't make decisions too hastily without consulting the lord and this is what saul did the last one moving quickly the last one he outright disobeyed the prophet's word as we turn to first samuel 15 15 verse 2. final stage of saul's life israel's looking at what america israel is saying by now what in the world have we chosen what in the world is this man doing he's disrespecting the prophet and we chose him slowly away from the prophets first samuel 15 2 and 3 says thus say the lord of hosts i remember that's what ambulance did to israel how he laid weight for him in the way when he came up from egypt now go and smite amalek and utterly destroy all that they have spare them not but slay both man and women infant and suckling ox and sheep camel and ass stop right there that's the word that's the word from the prophet go slay them amla kites and don't spare slay both man women infant suckling ox sheep camel and ass that's the word from a prophet but you know the story he goes and then the prophet comes up to him and he says what have you done he says i have done the word of the lord. and the prophet says why is there bleeding of sheep in my ear so now he goes this process this prophet explaining i love when kids are just listening to me because they've been taught these things he's explaining himself saying that i've done the word he's actually come to self-deception because he's deceived into thinking i did the word of the lord but you didn't do it according to the prophet's word what meaneth this bleeding in the sheep in my ear what are all these spoils from the what is all this thing what is all this so verse 9 please first samuel 15 verse 9 but the saul and the people but saul and the people spared a gag spirit in the best of the sheep and the oxen the fatlings and the lambs and all that was good and would not utterly destroy them but everything that was vile and refuge that they destroyed utterly verse 20 please then came the world understandable and sam saul said and said yeah i have obeyed the voice of the lord and have gone the way which the lord sent me and have brought back agag the king wait stop he's going on i have did the word of the lord i have gone the way the lord sent me and i have brought back to in this prophecy stop right there what you brought back the king i didn't tell you to do that so he's proclaiming what the prophet said but he gets off track listen friends we need leadership that stays with what the word of god says so much could be said about people getting under leadership even sometimes in our own ranks that they do what saul did they start injecting their own way to do things we need leadership that has the balance of the word but we need leadership that gives the full counsel of the word and not holds back anything and we don't need brothers interpreting what brother branham said and trying to add to it and trying to make out all these things after the seals brother braham says don't interpret anything leave this alone if god wants you to know anything he'll bring it to pass why is brother ryan saying that because men will mess it up trying to interpret themselves trying to take the lamb and he steps forth he leaves the mercy seat all these other things be careful how you handle it and for years in this message we have people taking that and it gets off track and we see the fruit of it now then you'll have ministers pick it up again and go down the same path and you're like saying no no we know what that produces don't go there been there done that got the t-shirt no we see the fruit that that produces don't mess with that leave it alone preach it the way the prophet said it but don't try to add to it or or make up some mysterious thing that people walk out of the surface and they can't even understand what's being said i had a dear sister telling me that just the other night saying we just couldn't do it because i'd walk out and i couldn't he's preaching quotes but i didn't understand what he was saying i said sister that's the tragedy is that if you don't understand what's being said then what good is it to be there god help me as a minister god help me that even the smallest child can get something out of the sermon we're not here to preach up here so nobody has a clue and just as long as you come here you're in the elite god help us friends that's a soul spirit for a man to lift himself up above brother branham was never that way he wanted the people to understand and if you don't understand it trust it believe it and god he says will open your eyes to things you know what it'll produce it'll produce more of the life of christ the difference is how people view the message some people reveal is just some movement but i view it as the revealing of jesus christ if it doesn't bring more of christ to you then we're missing something somebody ought to clap their hands and say praise the lord because that's needs to be said [Applause] god hastened the day when he gives us more true leadership in this message to lead the people properly can you say man there's been way too many people get off track injecting their own thing in their assault type leadership god raise up more davids that have the heart of god for the people and then verse 22 he deceived himself did i get verse 20 yet brother verse 20 and saul said unto samuel yeah i obeyed the voice of the lord gone away brought gay and have utterly destroyed the americans it's just subtle in there but the people took the spa sheep and oxen the chief of things which should have been utterly destroyed to sacrifice of the lord thy god in gilgal verse 22 and samuel said hath the lord as great delight and burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams we find the principle to obey is better than sacrifice see saul thought he would get credit because of all the sacrifice and all the things he did do but when he got off the word that's where he messed up god doesn't judge us by our sacrifices that we make can you say amen i love this little part here if you guys have it there i didn't put it on my notes but look what he says here it's so interesting chapter 13 and verse 12 when he's still in his explanation therefore said i the philistines will come down and upon me to gilgo and i have not made supplication of the lord i forced myself therefore and offered a burnt offering that's going back when he offered the sacrifice i forced myself i didn't want to do it but i was in a hurry and you didn't show up samuel and i forced myself it sounds the devil made me do it i was in a hurry and i had to do it now i know i didn't weigh to the lord but i i forced myself how do you do that self-deception self-glorification it's all in the character of saul and don't forget this isn't a worldly man this is the man leading the children of israel anointed by god's prophet see we're coming down to a razor blade edge can you say man and we have to say lord give me the right leadership in my life because it's so easy it can just get off track anybody learning anything this morning let's change this whole thing now as i promised because none of us like to talk about all the bad decisions we've made in our lives i trust that you have behold and like israel behold your king look what he's doing look at his disobedience look at him taking you away from the prophet till he disobeyed look at and and behold i trust that you've done that and i always i always desire for you to apply it to your own life lord help me in my decisions that i make help me and my choices i make let me choose you let me have your choice can you say amen but we don't want to go all day here saying beholding our bad choices and beholding the fruits of them and we're eating the fruit of our own choices let's change this around let's talk about behold let's behold a little bit the grace of almighty god because god never leaves us there hanging with just our choices as a matter of fact brother barry said one time the way that we can reverse a bad harvest of bad seeds that you have sown wrong seeds you've sown is to stop there you're still going to reap some of that harvest but to start planting the right seeds you can't change things there's some things you're never going to be able to change friends but you can start getting into the word and planting the right seeds and just a few years from now sometimes it takes a while talking with brother rap in the office sometimes it takes time for people to be purged of the wrong seed in their life they've been under the wrong preacher been under the wrong thing it doesn't happen overnight but if you start planting the right seeds you're going to see a harvest from it in your family in your marriage in your lives can you say man thank god for the law of harvest works the other way for us and i can apply the word of god and plant the right seeds if i was a rough man with my children i can start being nice to my children start being good to them start planting and praising themselves always criticizing them i can change and start planting the right seed and get a harvest from that it may take a long time but the law of harvest still works can you say amen and so here's what i wanted to say to be positive this morning to talk about let's behold not just ch let's change this beholding our choices let's behold his grace as if you would turn to first samuel chapter 12 and then we'll wrap up with this but i know you're gonna love this you're gonna i promise you we're gonna get to something here that's really good and then we're gonna close the service but listen first samuel chapter 12 and verse 14 now here is is god speaking through his prophet now to israel if you will fear the lord and serve him and obey his voice and not rebel against the commandment of the lord then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the lord your god this is after they had chosen saul but if you will not obey the voice of the lord but rebel against the commandment of the lord then shall the hand of the lord be against you as it was against your fathers now therefore stand and see this great thing which the lord will do before your eyes is it not weed harvest today i will call unto the lord and he shall send thunder and rain that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness is great which you have done in the sight of the lord and asking you a king so here samuel says i'm just going to go the extra here and i'm going to prove to the people to show them how bad your choice was for saul and he says i'm going to call for thunder right now and reign right now and you're going to see how evil your choice was boy i tell you god can really show you the message you got yourself in and you just want to take a moment and capitalize on it and say i'm going to see show you what great wickedness this was in the king you've chosen and guess what happened verse 18 so samuel called him the lord and the lord set the thunder and rain that day and all the people greatly feared the lord and samuel right then crimp rain thunder i don't know how to make the thunder sound don't laugh at me grace it's hard to make a thunder sound i'm big enough but i don't have the voice to do it right at that moment christ you know just everything's stunning and israel's going ah and it just takes it even deeper kind of how we feel this morning he's like lord have mercy god i have really messed up see god has to take us to real true conviction of what we've done or we'll justify it we'll smooth it over it wasn't that bad things are no it was bad so they're they're seeing this thunder and rain and here's what they say verse 19 and all the people said unto samuel pray for us thy servants unto the lord thy god that we will not die for we have added unto all the sins this evil to ask a king they were really convicted and they said samuel after this thunder listen would you just pray for us because besides all of our sins now we've done this chosen saul would you pray for us please we're basically finished here the only hope we got is your prayers would you pray for us boy he's really got him in a spot here of conviction this is what i love next and samuel said unto the people fear not ye have done all this wickedness yet turn not aside from following the lord but serve the lord with all your heart and turn ye not aside for then should ye go after vain things which cannot profit nor deliver for they are vain you know what he's saying you get all these choices and you got saul and all this but he's still in his grace instructing them don't let this go any further you can start planting the right seeds right now for the lord read verse 22 with me loud for the lord will not forsake his people say it again for the lord will not forsake his people for his great namesake because it hath pleased the lord to make you his people if you don't get anything else today get this god in all your bad choices god will never forsake his own people i had fellowship the other night uh with some families and you know i just i know that the lord blessed me to be here to to see healing come because there's been so many past situations just and sometimes they share the stories and but this is where this message come this morning this last part of it is listening to their stories saying you know what these people have been through so many things so many ups and downs within our own ranks it's terrible some of the things that they've been through some of the things that's been said about him some of the wrong leadership that they've been underground and yet i'm sitting here and see they have the greatest love for the lord they have a great love for the message can you say amen you know what it is god will not forsake his people [Applause] he forsook saul can you say amen he got rid of saul he'll get rid of the wrong leadership but he'll never forsake his people i said how in the world these people sitting here still just with joy in their heart feeding on the word of god saying something is happening yes praise be to god i'm feeding on the word of god and they don't have to be there it's a choice they don't even have to be around the message anymore they don't have to go to another church some people come that way i don't want to darken another church door especially a messenger i'm not going to darken the door ever again and yet and yet god's grace as we behold his grace if we're god's people he's not going to forsake him somebody say praise the lord god will not forsake his people he'll forsake the wrong leadership he'll some churches i'm not talking about church i'm talking about his people he will not forsake his people some of you ought to raise your hand said i'm still here devil go ahead and say i'm still here no matter what's happened to me wrong leadership oh i'm still here i don't care what people think of me devil i'm still here because why god doesn't forsake his people you may pull out of churches and do this and ups and downs are the same but god doesn't forsake his people and i like this library it has pleased the lord to make you his people you got to go home with that today god is pleased that he made me his his people god's pleased with me any of you ever read in jeremiah when he says i no longer call you forsaken he says it looked like i forsake you for many years 70 years in captivity to babylon you know what all they rebelled against god saviour's captivity it looked like god forsaken i don't think god forsakes his people he just withdrew himself but he had a promise he's going to commit he said you used to be the forsaken can you can you pull up can you give me just two minutes and that was enough response to go ahead and go there i'm having a good time god won't forsake his people friends all the bad decisions all the choices and how many once or he said i've got a lot of them i'll raise mine i've got a lot of them sometimes i think the only good ones i made is the lord and my wife i know i made a good choice in my wife and i have to grab onto that sometime lord but this was a good choice i prayed about it this was a great choice he's a beautiful lady and beautiful character who praise the lord what did i say oh okay isaiah 49 i got caught up there in how beautiful that choice was that i made of my wife and how beautiful she is all right isaiah chapter 49. isn't that right some of you got a good mate say i messed up i made some bad choices but i i made a good choice with that so if the devil's beating you up over your choices look at some of the right ones you made one is to choose the lord for this hour can you say man some of you for sick your whole family and your old family turned you out back then but it was the right choice praise the lord all right it's hard to stop preaching today isaiah chapter 49 i'm going to give you the verse here brothers up there in a minute if you read through the book of isaiah it's wonderful because it just really talks about god's redemption and when you come back into the joy of the lord after he is forsaking you and he says here oh boy i didn't write the verse down oh boy you know what i'm gonna have to i can't find that oh verse 14. but zion said verse 13 single heavens and be joyful old earth and break forth into singing oh mountains for the lord had committed his people and will have mercy upon his vixen but zion said the lord hath forsaken me and my lord hath forgotten me and the lord says can a woman forget her suckling child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb yea they may forget it's a possibility they may forget it's a hard thing for a mother to forget her child being born they may forget yet will i not forget thee you've been birthed by him you're in his family and then isaiah 54 i wish i wrote these down okay yes verse 5 for thy maker is thine husband the lord of hosts is his name and thy redeemer the holy one of israel the god of whole earth shall he be called for the lord hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit and a wife of youth when thou was refused saith thy god for a moment have i forsaken thee but with great mercies will i gather thee i say praise the lord for a moment and i don't even believe you for some reason for a moment i forsake thee i don't think he did but in our eyes he does but he says i'll gather you with great mercies why he won't forsake his people he'll withdraw himself from churches who will draw himself from denominations when they shut him out he'll withdraw himself saul tried his hardest friends after god rejected him he tried his hardest to get under the anointing and keep the keep the kingdom going and once he was done he was done god may remove leadership god may change church situations god may deal with men that you feel have abused you god will deal with those men but he won't ever forsake his people amen let's stand together i have a maker he for my heart before even time began my life was in his hands he knows my name he knows my head every thought and he sees each tear that falls and hears second verse [Music] i have a father think about it now he calls me his own oh yes he'll never leave me no matter where i go sing it now oh he knows my name [Music] he sees each tear that falls and hears me when i call you bow your heads just a minute and think about the leadership that you were under one day some of you are sitting here maybe thinking of the fathers that you were under and it wasn't a godly man maybe the mom wasn't a godly woman and so you endured loving them as a father and mother and yet at the same trying to work through all the confusion of being under that wrong type of leadership but look how you hear today by god's grace you can tell the devil i'm still here because god will not forsake his own god didn't forsake you under the wrong ministers under the wrong influence but god didn't forsake you you're still here this morning and how we can raise your hand and say i have something within me that has a pure love for god and love for his word and love for this prophet and satan can never take that away i'm gonna raise your anger i got that within me right now satan can never take that away no matter what i've been through god placed that within me he created that right heart within me and that's real it's original it's god before the foundation of the word put something within me no matter what churches do he'll never forsake his own people you ought to raise your hand and say thank you lord for your grace thank you lord that i'm still here standing today i don't know how i am but by god's grace i'm still standing loving this word and this christ you see it's not just the bible it's christ he's a person and i love him more than i've ever loved him before how many could say that this morning i love him more than i've ever loved him before i just i fall in love deeper with him all the time he's so real he's so blessed he blesses me so much and i never i never want to leave him again i never want to first i don't ever want to i don't want my own choices anymore lord i don't the sons of god no longer want their own choice they want your choice sons of god are led by the spirit of god and lord in this day of the manifestation of the sons of god all creation is groaning for the manifestations the sons of god all creation and we groan without ourselves to see at the adam the race be restored back to by the second adam and come back into eden again into relationship with you into no condemnation no fear and now we're seeing it lord it's not just the rapture i'm seeing families and couples and single people come into a deeper relationship with you like i've never seen before i stand in all lord what your word is doing and i even prayed it last night in this building i said lord even if some have walls up just god woo them i pray and draw
