[0:00] the second chapter of the
[0:02] church age book we'll try to go through
[0:03] that some this evening
[0:05] and i'm kind of hitting highlights so
[0:07] there's there's a lot in there so i
[0:08] really do encourage you if you haven't
[0:10] uh
[0:11] if you made it through chapter one uh
[0:13] try to get into chapter two there's a
[0:14] lot more there than what i have
[0:16] here and just really encourage you to
[0:18] get in yourselves
[0:20] um
[0:22] let's see revelation 1 and verse nine
[0:27] i john who also am your brother and
[0:30] companion in tribulation and in the
[0:32] kingdom and patience of jesus christ
[0:35] was in the isle that is called patmos
[0:38] for the word of god and for the
[0:40] testimony of jesus christ
[0:42] i was in the spirit on the lord's day
[0:44] and heard behind me a great voice as of
[0:47] a trumpet saying i am alpha and omega
[0:50] the first and the last
[0:52] and what thou seest write in the book
[0:54] and send it unto the seven churches
[0:56] which are in asia and ephesus under
[0:58] smyrna and to pergamos and thyatira and
[1:01] to sardis and to philadelphia
[1:04] and unto
[1:05] laodicea
[1:06] and then i turned to see the voice that
[1:08] spake with me and being turned i saw
[1:12] seven golden candle sticks
[1:14] and then the rest of the chapter goes
[1:16] into the vision that he sees or the path
[1:18] of his vision but we'll go into that uh
[1:20] here as we go into the service let's
[1:22] just bow our heads and ask the lord's
[1:23] blessing here
[1:24] heavenly father we thank you very much
[1:26] for your goodness and grace to us lord i
[1:28] thank you for your presence here with us
[1:30] lord
[1:31] father we just ask your your blessing as
[1:33] we go through the service father just
[1:35] pray for your inspiration lord and
[1:37] clarity in jesus name amen amen
[1:40] all right
[1:42] you may be seated
[1:46] as we look at chapter
[1:48] 1 i just
[1:50] kind of want to think of it in the way
[1:51] that john is giving us here jesus christ
[1:55] is giving us here at the very beginning
[1:56] of revelation
[1:58] the setting of the entire story that
[2:01] we're getting ready to have and it's
[2:03] kind of like
[2:05] some of us might be
[2:06] readers get this set up here
[2:10] wonderful well we might be readers i
[2:12] enjoy a a good mystery and
[2:15] you can be reading it can be a page
[2:17] turner it can be late at night and then
[2:20] you're tired you know you really should
[2:21] be going to bed but you is he going to
[2:24] is the guy going to survive the night or
[2:26] not it's the point of utmost suspense
[2:29] so that you can get a good night's sleep
[2:31] and still make to work on time the next
[2:33] morning you might peek back at the very
[2:35] last page of the book and see oh okay
[2:38] the hero is all right in the end anyhow
[2:40] and that's the kind of effect that we
[2:43] have here in this path vision it's the
[2:46] very beginning of
[2:48] this great drama that's going to be
[2:49] playing out in the church ages where i
[2:52] mean all the devil's throwing everything
[2:54] he has
[2:56] at this new church from the day of
[2:58] pentecost so he's throwing everything
[3:00] we're going to be seeing
[3:01] beasts coming out of the closet just
[3:02] he's just throwing everything of the
[3:04] horse riders everything like is this
[3:06] little church going to make it or not at
[3:08] the very beginning we have a very
[3:11] large dose of foreshadowing we see the
[3:13] victorious christ coming back with eyes
[3:16] of fire with hit with with his with his
[3:18] white wool with his feet like brass he's
[3:20] coming back as a victorious judge
[3:23] so we can set off on this journey
[3:25] through the church ages
[3:27] knowing that in the end we're going to
[3:29] win so we can read the story
[3:32] relaxed and enjoy it because there's an
[3:34] assurance we're going to make it
[3:36] and as we look at the vision this
[3:38] evening pray the lord will help us to
[3:39] look at it not just on the level of
[3:42] what's happening in the church ages
[3:45] but what's happening there also is
[3:47] happening in our own lives
[3:50] because we can look in the bible and say
[3:52] yes there's a lot the devil's going to
[3:54] be throwing everything he has at us
[3:55] we'll be going through times of turmoil
[3:57] times of stress short times of
[3:59] tribulation but we can
[4:01] sit back and enjoy the journey because
[4:03] we have an assurance
[4:05] that we're going to win
[4:07] with jesus christ kind of like the like
[4:08] we heard sunday as long as he's in your
[4:10] boat you're going to make it that's the
[4:12] important thing and that's what we kind
[4:13] of see here
[4:14] with the patmos vision
[4:18] so we read our text and just by way of
[4:20] review the uh the seven churches are
[4:22] located historically there in what's uh
[4:25] present-day turkey and there they are
[4:28] john ministered especially in the at the
[4:30] church of ephesus for quite some time
[4:33] but in the uh i think the at the end of
[4:36] the first century um the emperor do
[4:38] mission um
[4:40] it launched a fresh assault of
[4:42] persecutions against the church and he
[4:45] uh took john himself
[4:47] and the isle of patmos is uh let's see
[4:50] if i can find it can you see my mouse up
[4:51] there no you can't i can probably put
[4:53] this on there
[4:56] that will we won't get too techy the
[4:58] iron of patmos is right there to the
[5:00] south east to the southwest of ephesus
[5:03] and it was not a vacation destination if
[5:06] you read about it in the uh church age
[5:08] book um brother branham describes it but
[5:11] the greek word itself means
[5:13] my killing and you can my maybe you know
[5:16] pathos has to do with with great feeling
[5:18] where he's sent to the isle of patmos
[5:20] and that's my killing i just thought
[5:22] that there's there's a little message in
[5:24] there
[5:25] because don't times of personal
[5:27] suffering and distress
[5:29] come before outpourings of god's
[5:31] revelation it certainly did in john's
[5:33] life we can look back at our own lives
[5:35] and we've gone through times of great
[5:36] difficulty oh man when we look back we
[5:39] wouldn't trade them for the world
[5:40] because of what came after them
[5:43] and the and the trick is to have that
[5:47] same attitude as we're going through
[5:49] them
[5:49] that yes god is with us i wouldn't trade
[5:52] this for the world because of what he's
[5:53] building in me
[5:55] now
[5:56] it was a
[5:57] it was a volcanic island very
[5:59] rocky treeless landscape lifeless
[6:02] landscape there wasn't much there except
[6:05] brother branham says it was rocky
[6:07] infested with snakes
[6:08] lizards and scorpions it had very little
[6:11] commercial value the romans used it as a
[6:14] penal colony where they would send all
[6:15] the troublemakers over there kind of
[6:17] like we the british sent all the
[6:19] troublemakers to georgia or to australia
[6:22] all the unwanted send them far away
[6:24] where they can't cause any trouble that
[6:26] is where john was sent
[6:28] and when john opens up this verse 9 he
[6:31] says i john who also am your brother and
[6:34] companion tribulation all christians at
[6:37] this time were going through great trial
[6:39] and great stress
[6:40] and john's saying i am your brother in
[6:42] this i'm going through the very kind of
[6:44] same things that you are going through
[6:46] as well and he's he's doing this in the
[6:49] patience of jesus christ and
[6:51] if you look at the very beginning of the
[6:53] chapter brother branham relates the
[6:55] story
[6:56] how at this time the early church was
[6:58] going through great persecutions
[7:00] their religion was not only everywhere
[7:02] spoken against but the people themselves
[7:04] were imprisoned and killed
[7:06] john like multitudes of others was now
[7:09] suffering imprisonment for the word of
[7:12] god and the testimony of jesus christ it
[7:14] says when arrested they tried in vain to
[7:17] kill john
[7:18] by boiling him in oil for 24 hours
[7:22] and the enraged and powerless officials
[7:24] then sentenced him to patmos
[7:26] as a witch
[7:28] but he says but god was with him and he
[7:29] was spared to leave the island and
[7:31] returned to ephesus where he again
[7:32] continued to pastor until the time of
[7:35] his death and brother braham says this
[7:37] this the time period he's here on patmos
[7:39] was a couple years so it wasn't that he
[7:41] just saw all these visions and one
[7:43] afternoon and then wrote them down but i
[7:46] don't know how it went exactly but it
[7:48] was a period of time with angel meeting
[7:50] him messengers meeting him and sharing
[7:52] more and more
[7:54] with him
[7:56] and
[7:57] the last last time i felt kind of bad
[7:58] after we had their uh session over to
[8:00] god that i felt like i had to rush and
[8:02] get through it all i'm gonna try to take
[8:04] a little easier so if you have a
[8:05] question to draw it down or you just
[8:07] raise your hand that's not going to be a
[8:08] violation of any church order if you
[8:10] have a question i'm happy to put the
[8:12] brake on
[8:13] we'll just kind of go where we go
[8:16] but i want to think about the very same
[8:19] demonic power
[8:21] that was persecuting john that day
[8:24] it's the same demonic power
[8:27] that's still behind
[8:29] persecution of christians the
[8:30] persecution of the bride today
[8:33] why is that well you can look in the
[8:35] book of daniel
[8:37] the demonic power behind john's
[8:39] persecution was the very one that's
[8:40] behind ours the book of daniel
[8:42] nebuchadnezzar
[8:44] gives it receives a dream in daniel
[8:46] chapter 2 where he sees this this great
[8:48] image
[8:50] and
[8:51] daniel interprets this dream for
[8:53] nebuchadnezzar and what this is this
[8:55] great image with a head of gold daniel
[8:57] says nebuchadnezzar you are that head of
[9:00] gold but after you is going to come
[9:02] another kingdom not quite as great as
[9:03] you are but it'll be the medes and
[9:05] persians and after them they'll come
[9:07] another kingdom and this is the
[9:09] belly of brass and just the metals are
[9:11] getting less and less valuable and at
[9:13] the very bottom after them will become a
[9:15] very different kingdom legs of iron feet
[9:18] of iron and clay and this kingdom is
[9:20] going to be different than all the rest
[9:22] and at the bottom of our notes
[9:25] we see daniel describing on page one how
[9:28] the fourth kingdom is going to be strong
[9:29] as iron for as much as iron breaks in
[9:32] pieces and subdues all things there's
[9:34] iron that breaketh all these shall it
[9:36] break in pieces and brews
[9:39] and whereas thou sawest the feet and the
[9:41] toes part of potter's clay part of iron
[9:44] this kingdom shall be divided
[9:47] but if there shall be in it of the
[9:48] strength of the iron for as much as you
[9:50] saw the iron mixed with miry clay
[9:53] and the toes of the feet were part iron
[9:56] part of clay so the kingdom shall be
[9:57] partly strong and partly broken this
[10:01] kingdom is different than the others it
[10:03] doesn't end in the same way the others
[10:05] do where another kingdom comes and just
[10:06] replaces it it's different this kingdom
[10:09] is a mystery kingdom it just continues
[10:12] into the future past
[10:14] past daniel's lifetime past this time
[10:16] passed all the way into the future until
[10:19] finally jesus christ kingdom comes back
[10:21] and with a stone out of a mountain
[10:22] without coming out hands it smites all
[10:24] this image and
[10:26] destroys world systems
[10:28] well daniel chapter 7
[10:31] daniel sees another vision
[10:33] that that's different the same different
[10:35] symbols but they're representing the
[10:37] same thing
[10:38] he sees four beasts again first one's a
[10:41] lion and that runs parallel with the
[10:44] image that nebuchadnezzar had seen that
[10:45] lion is going to be babylon just like
[10:47] the head of gold was babylon
[10:49] and then after he sees this great bear
[10:51] and the bear that's going to be the one
[10:53] that defeats the lion this is the king
[10:55] of the medial persians just like the
[10:56] silver
[10:57] was the next kingdom in the first vision
[11:00] daniel two and after that
[11:01] comes this leopard this this fast fast
[11:04] beast fast just like this is uh
[11:06] representing alexander the greats empire
[11:08] who is able to conquer the known world
[11:10] in such a short time
[11:12] and then finally there's this uh fourth
[11:14] kingdom that's different than all the
[11:16] rest again
[11:17] and on the top of page two in the notes
[11:20] we see um daniel's talking about this
[11:22] this fourth kingdom
[11:24] after this i saw on the night visions
[11:26] and behold a fourth beast
[11:28] dreadful and terrible and strong
[11:30] exceedingly and it had great iron teeth
[11:32] it devoured break in pieces stamped the
[11:36] residue at the feet of it and it was
[11:38] diverse it was different
[11:40] from all the beasts that were before
[11:41] this fourth kingdom is different the
[11:43] other ones are defeated in our time and
[11:46] they're replaced by something else this
[11:47] fourth kingdom it goes on and on until
[11:50] god himself calls it into it and it's
[11:52] this fourth kingdom
[11:54] that's actually this kingdom it started
[11:57] out as a pagan rome
[11:59] and it was partly strong and partly
[12:01] broken and then pagan rome is replaced
[12:04] by by papal rome and we see a couple and
[12:07] we see this this fourth kingdom it goes
[12:09] on and on on in and into the future and
[12:12] that's actually where we would put the
[12:15] church ages all of this all the time
[12:18] it's in in the book of revelation the
[12:20] time period that we know as the church
[12:21] ages that takes place under the worldly
[12:24] domination
[12:26] of
[12:26] this fourth mystery beast
[12:29] and then in revelation chapter 13 verse
[12:32] three this is on page two of the notes
[12:34] talks about
[12:35] john is now seeing revelation 13
[12:38] and daniel 7 kind of run in parallel
[12:40] revelation 13 if you describes that same
[12:43] fourth beast
[12:45] in daniel 7 that the seven heads the ten
[12:48] horns there's a lot of similarities
[12:49] there because they're the same beast in
[12:52] revelation 13 3 it says i saw one of his
[12:55] heads of this beast as it were wounded
[12:57] to death and this deadly wound was
[12:59] healed this is when pagan roam it seems
[13:02] to be wounded to death we've got them
[13:03] but no it resurrects
[13:06] itself as papal rome
[13:08] and the same thing in revelation 17 8
[13:11] this beast is called the beast that was
[13:13] and is not and yet is
[13:16] pagan rome is there
[13:18] pagan rome falls but yet it's
[13:20] resurrected in papal rome it's still
[13:23] there it was is not and yet is and
[13:25] brother branham talks about this in many
[13:28] places here's a real succinct quote from
[13:29] the 70th week of daniel we know beyond
[13:31] any shadow of doubt who that beast was
[13:35] that power that had the deadly wound but
[13:37] did live it was when pagan rome was
[13:39] killed and papal rome took its place
[13:42] when pagan rome was killed
[13:44] and papal power took its place
[13:47] that very same spirit that had john on
[13:50] patmos
[13:52] might be the same is the same spirit
[13:53] that's persecuting us in different ways
[13:56] now um in the 20th century there's um
[14:00] they saw the rise of totalitarian
[14:02] governments they're trying to control
[14:04] their people and persecute their people
[14:06] there were books written about soviet
[14:07] russia and stalinism and one was like
[14:10] 1984 where big brother razir trying to
[14:12] persecute and control the population so
[14:14] much and you said this is kind of the
[14:16] strategy of
[14:18] of pagan rome for a long time we just
[14:20] persecute those christians beat the
[14:22] torah out of them so they'll stop being
[14:23] christians
[14:24] that's how one uh one book was written
[14:27] about totalitarian societies controlling
[14:30] there's another book that was written i
[14:32] forget the name of it now but
[14:34] the point of the book was that if we can
[14:36] just get the people love
[14:38] entertaining themselves and pursuing the
[14:40] next pleasure getting their next great
[14:42] kick then we will be able to control
[14:44] them anyway because they won't care
[14:45] about anything
[14:46] except more and more pleasure
[14:49] and i think
[14:51] pagan roman papal rome were not being
[14:53] persecuted like john was being boiled in
[14:55] oil
[14:56] what about the things that we get
[14:57] plugged into and are submersing
[14:59] ourselves we might not be immersing
[15:01] ourselves in boiling oil
[15:03] we might be immersing ourselves in ah
[15:05] the wonderful most wonderful bubble bath
[15:07] there is it's a very pleasant experience
[15:09] it's distracting us and keeping
[15:11] ourselves from what's most important and
[15:13] that's a different kind of persecution
[15:15] because we don't experience it that way
[15:17] but pagan power papal power doing
[15:21] it's achieving the same effect that
[15:23] persecution might be experienced
[15:25] differently by us in the moment that
[15:27] makes sense
[15:32] so um
[15:33] john says he is um he was in the spirit
[15:36] on the lord's day
[15:38] and he he brother brandon emphasizes
[15:40] here in the second chapter of the church
[15:41] age book that john is taken out of the
[15:44] day of man and he's transported someday
[15:48] into the future into the day of the lord
[15:51] and he emphasizes here multiple times
[15:54] this day our day right now this is a
[15:56] man's day it's man's doings man's work
[15:59] man's church man's ideas
[16:02] but the day of the lord is coming we
[16:04] live in the time period where our own
[16:06] personal efforts are emphasized
[16:08] to achieve all kinds of things i think
[16:10] brother paul's quoted watchmen knee how
[16:12] great the american church is and they
[16:14] accomplish so much without praying
[16:17] because it's a day of man we do so much
[16:19] in trying to do it in our own experience
[16:21] and i would say our challenge today
[16:23] is to walk in the spirit
[16:26] even while we're living in the day of
[16:27] man
[16:29] we have to walk in the spirit
[16:31] even though our tendency is to do so
[16:32] much by ourselves to do to improve
[16:35] ourselves etc
[16:38] the day we're living in brother branham
[16:39] says the god of this evil age it's
[16:41] called in the bible the day of man this
[16:43] is not god's day
[16:46] he says this is choosing day either live
[16:48] for today and die
[16:50] or choose god
[16:52] and live
[16:53] what day are we going to going going to
[16:55] live for
[16:57] so this is the day of man um we're
[17:00] waiting for the day of the lord to come
[17:01] and at this
[17:03] place in the message brother branham
[17:06] stops and talks a little bit about uh
[17:08] the sabbath being the um being
[17:11] being the day of rest and he talks about
[17:14] the sacharidarians or i think he's
[17:16] speaking at large about seventh day
[17:17] adventists and other groups who look at
[17:19] look at saturday as being the sabbath
[17:21] and if you keep the sabbath
[17:23] that is that is the day of rest and that
[17:25] is what you're supposed to be doing and
[17:27] brother branham stops here i'm not going
[17:28] to stop a real long time on it but he
[17:30] makes a good point evan read those
[17:31] couple pages 42 to 44 in the
[17:34] church age book that keeping a certain
[17:36] day keeping anything of a certain law
[17:38] that doesn't give us rest
[17:41] we can do all kinds of things on our own
[17:44] thinking we're going to achieve a
[17:45] certain
[17:46] feeling a certain rest but that's not it
[17:49] if that were the case it's all by our
[17:52] own works anyhow
[17:54] but
[17:55] the sabbath isn't in keeping a certain
[17:56] holy day brother brahm talks about that
[17:58] quote in colossians 2 16 the best
[18:01] sabbath observers that were around on
[18:03] jesus day
[18:04] jesus said come unto me and i will give
[18:06] you rest
[18:08] he was the source of rest then he talks
[18:10] about in isaiah chapter 28 where is the
[18:12] rest going to come from it says with
[18:14] stammering lips another tongue
[18:16] i i will speak to you this is the rest
[18:19] that was spoken of and that was that
[18:21] rest was given and was accompanied by
[18:23] stammering lips and another tongue on
[18:25] the day of pentecost and that was a
[18:27] vindication that the holy ghost that's
[18:29] the rest
[18:30] so brother branham emphasizes in this
[18:32] day of man
[18:34] keeping a certain holy day anything else
[18:36] that we do that's not the rest that we
[18:39] can be really good things but that's not
[18:40] the rest the rest is ceasing from our
[18:43] works and resting in god's works
[18:48] the day of man does put our focus on on
[18:51] man's works and if you go into book
[18:53] shops like like i do from time to time
[18:54] it's amazing how
[18:56] huge the self-help section is it's just
[18:59] expansive and there's self-help titles
[19:02] on on everything there's even self-help
[19:04] books on how to write self-help books
[19:07] because it's the day of man we want to
[19:10] improve ourselves by our own strength
[19:12] because we want to be able to have a
[19:13] certain to to achieve a certain standard
[19:16] we want to do it on our own i was
[19:18] looking at this last night i mean
[19:20] six books to read during burnout when
[19:22] you feel exhausted 25 book street if
[19:24] you're feeling stuck and unmotivated i
[19:26] can imagine how would you feel if i came
[19:28] to you and here you're feeling stuck
[19:30] read these books i mean that's that's
[19:32] not going to help at all but that's the
[19:34] day of man we kind of buy into this we
[19:36] got all these oh yeah i'll take this i
[19:38] want to help i want help why help when
[19:39] we come home crashing exhausted by this
[19:42] the burden of all these self-help books
[19:43] because we can't help ourselves
[19:47] we need god to do it
[19:49] so we need to get out of the spirit of
[19:52] the day of marriage i got to do this
[19:54] i've got to do this the keys in this
[19:56] book the keys in this book we've got to
[19:57] get out of that spirit
[19:59] and we have to get in the holy spirit
[20:01] because notice when john got in this
[20:03] spirit says i was in the spirit fine
[20:05] just imagine john is on this penal
[20:07] colony this island with snakes and
[20:10] lizards and everything like that now
[20:12] and all these he probably wasn't the
[20:14] only one on there
[20:16] it probably wasn't a really encouraging
[20:18] holy ghost revival atmosphere on that
[20:20] island
[20:21] and it would be very easy to get in
[20:23] another spirit besides god's spirit on
[20:25] the island
[20:26] but think it's the very same spirit that
[20:28] was oppressing him that oppresses you
[20:30] and me do we have a heart of getting in
[20:32] the holy spirit sometimes yes we do it
[20:34] might not be because of all the
[20:36] terrible experiences we have we have all
[20:38] these other distractions but those
[20:40] distractions are the very same
[20:41] persecuting spirit
[20:44] trying to fool us not make us hurt it
[20:46] not make them hurt us so we keep on
[20:48] doing it's the same spirit
[20:50] but john had to make a choice there i'm
[20:53] going to get in the spirit i want to be
[20:55] in this spirit he opened himself up for
[20:57] that
[20:58] and as soon as he gets in the spirit he
[20:59] gets in the spirit on the lord's day
[21:02] and
[21:03] the voice is behind him
[21:07] what does this show us when we're in our
[21:09] own spirit when everything around us we
[21:11] get all turned around and we're finally
[21:13] in the spirit like lord
[21:15] and he turns i'm back here
[21:18] it's when we're in the spirit we realize
[21:20] how turned around we really are
[21:23] and is it
[21:24] isn't it so easy to get involved in the
[21:26] rat race of all our different priorities
[21:28] and we think this is important we think
[21:30] that's important we think that's
[21:31] important and then we get into a
[21:33] wonderful church service the holy spirit
[21:36] just comes down we just enjoy his
[21:38] presence we're just immersed in his
[21:39] presence and we leave and like wow
[21:42] nothing to what i was so worried about
[21:43] being so important none of that's really
[21:45] important after all lord i just want one
[21:47] thing if i can just dwell on your courts
[21:49] that's the most wonderful thing there is
[21:52] when we get in the spirit we realize how
[21:55] turned around we are
[21:56] when i was uh when i was a teenager we
[21:59] played little flight simulator games and
[22:01] in those days we had joysticks didn't we
[22:04] ever play a game with a joystick yeah
[22:06] okay very good well after a while you're
[22:08] playing the game with the joystick and
[22:10] all of a sudden you're doing this thing
[22:11] and your plane's not doing what it's
[22:12] supposed to do and you realize you have
[22:14] to recalibrate the joystick
[22:17] so you have to like tell the joystick
[22:18] again where the middle point is
[22:21] and once it does that then you can fly
[22:22] good again
[22:24] that's like what getting in the spirit
[22:26] is
[22:27] it has to you have to recalibrate this
[22:29] is this is the middle
[22:31] this is the middle if you get the middle
[22:33] right you can fly straight but if you
[22:35] don't get the middle right you're going
[22:37] to be your plans will do all kinds of
[22:38] things you'll be work trying to get that
[22:40] joystick you'll break the joystick
[22:41] eventually you have to get recalibrated
[22:44] we get recalibrated by getting in the
[22:46] spirit and when we get in the spirit god
[22:48] turned us around
[22:50] so we see him and not our circumstances
[22:53] and brother branham says that you can't
[22:56] do any good
[22:58] until you first get in the spirit
[23:00] you can't do any good until you get
[23:03] first get in the spirit god can't use
[23:06] you
[23:06] we do all we try to do all kinds of
[23:09] things for god
[23:10] in our own spirit a lot of times
[23:13] we train we do it the best of intentions
[23:16] but oh my it's so much better to hold
[23:18] our tongue sometimes and get out of our
[23:20] spirit and get his spirit in my some
[23:21] things a lot of things to be done more
[23:23] quickly if we do that
[23:27] until we're in the spirit
[23:28] we really can't see our circumstances
[23:32] as they truly are
[23:35] and until we're in the spirit we can't
[23:36] see ourselves as we truly are either
[23:39] we have to get in the spirit and when
[23:41] john finally got in the spirit
[23:44] the spirit of god points him in the
[23:46] right direction again
[23:49] i wonder how long john had to be
[23:51] on the isle of patmos before he got in
[23:54] the spirit
[23:56] it could have been he was there for a
[23:57] year and a half before he finally said
[23:59] okay well i'm going to stop fighting
[24:00] this i'm going to get in the spirit it
[24:02] takes if patentness means my killing it
[24:05] takes a while to give up
[24:07] if i say look i'm going to stop fighting
[24:09] this thing
[24:10] have your way lord it takes a while so
[24:12] maybe he maybe he wasn't getting visions
[24:14] for two years i don't know this can take
[24:16] a while for us to finally die and say
[24:18] lord have your way
[24:21] but john's trial wasn't worthless he was
[24:24] boiled in oil had this terrible
[24:26] experience on patents we can see now it
[24:29] wasn't worthless we have a great book of
[24:31] the bible because of what he went
[24:33] through
[24:34] i'd say also
[24:35] neither are our trials worthless
[24:38] his words
[24:40] ours aren't
[24:41] either
[24:42] in first peter 1 6
[24:45] peter says that we can rejoice in god's
[24:47] salvation
[24:49] though now for a season if need be we're
[24:53] in heaviness through manifold
[24:54] temptations
[24:56] so now for a season
[24:58] if need be
[25:00] we're in heaviness from through manifold
[25:02] temptation so if we're going through
[25:04] something
[25:06] somebody above our pay grade decided it
[25:09] was needed because we go through them
[25:11] only if need be god doesn't waste
[25:16] pain and suffering he's not a
[25:18] masochistic sadistic god he doesn't
[25:21] waste that if we're going through
[25:22] something
[25:23] we can lord give up and to have your way
[25:26] on my heart because god's doing it for
[25:29] for a reason and we can be assured that
[25:31] he will be speaking to us in these times
[25:36] because somebody opened up to matthew 10
[25:38] 27
[25:40] i can remember when my um well my dad's
[25:42] mother
[25:43] um passed away um her name was uh kit i
[25:47] we called her mama um so if i say mama
[25:49] i'm talking about my grandmother but she
[25:52] she passed away and my dad asked me to
[25:55] um
[25:57] to minister at her her graveside service
[26:00] or her little funeral
[26:01] and
[26:03] sure i do that and before um
[26:06] before i i was able to find a old
[26:08] devotion book that she had it was my
[26:11] utmost for his highest
[26:12] and this is a book she had read this i i
[26:15] was looking at it that evening going
[26:17] through it
[26:17] and the very front page she had like 13
[26:20] different colored lines
[26:22] with years beside him each year that she
[26:24] would read the book she would use a
[26:25] different colored marker
[26:27] to make her her comments and her
[26:29] underlines
[26:30] and as she was going through it she
[26:32] would make a make a 1981
[26:35] october 20th rap was born or these
[26:38] different important dates or there's
[26:40] different you can go through there and
[26:41] see the different
[26:43] difficulties that she went through she
[26:45] had the she had a son who passed away at
[26:47] age 16
[26:49] do a drowning accident notes those kind
[26:51] and that kind of then there was a
[26:52] divorce that that she went through and
[26:54] then she talks about how um
[26:57] um
[26:59] she she she
[27:01] got saved how she got baptized all those
[27:03] things are in there i'm just kind of
[27:05] going through this and seeing
[27:07] wow
[27:08] she had a walk with the lord and i knew
[27:11] that but you see how it's chronicled
[27:13] this is a it's a precious book
[27:15] well one of the one of the devotions
[27:17] that was in there was
[27:19] oswald chambers was commenting on
[27:22] matthew 10 27.
[27:26] could someone read that for you
[27:28] gotta volunteer
[27:32] go for abby i wait for anybody to show
[27:34] anything yeah go for it matthew 10 27.
[27:45] thank you
[27:46] and oswald chambers just writes about
[27:48] this particular verse and i'd never seen
[27:50] it until i read it in my grandmother's
[27:52] devotional book but he says when you go
[27:54] through a dark time
[27:56] god is speaking to you he wants you to
[27:58] get so quiet so that you can what that
[28:00] which i speak in the ear if he's
[28:02] speaking in your ear he's speaking
[28:04] quietly he's sharing something special
[28:06] to you that which i speak in it tells
[28:09] you those things in darkness but that's
[28:11] just the first part of the verse the
[28:13] second part of the verse
[28:14] what you hear in the ear that preach you
[28:17] on the housetops so that time of
[28:19] darkness where you're just hearing it in
[28:21] the voice of god faintly but so
[28:22] preciously still
[28:24] that's going to end because there'll be
[28:26] a time when you come out of that
[28:27] darkness and you're going to be
[28:28] preaching that on the housetops
[28:31] that happened with with john he had very
[28:33] personal time with god during the isle
[28:35] of patentness but that time ended and
[28:38] there was a time when he went back
[28:39] tempest he was preaching from the
[28:41] housetops and we can go through night
[28:43] seasons ourselves but we're just long
[28:46] lords i want that soft quiet voice to
[28:48] speak into my ear it's that assurance
[28:50] that you're right there beside me you're
[28:51] with me
[28:52] and you'll go through that time and
[28:54] you'll finish that time and you'll be
[28:56] able to preach it from the housetops and
[28:58] share it boldly it'll be a bold
[29:00] testimony
[29:02] c.s lewis said god whispers to us and
[29:04] our pleasure speaks in our consciences
[29:06] but shouts in our pains
[29:09] it's his megaphone to rouse a deaf world
[29:12] when god wants to speak to us
[29:14] he wants to speak to us so badly he's
[29:17] willing to do anything to get us to hear
[29:19] his message to hear his voice he's even
[29:22] willing to put us into a little bit of
[29:24] pain
[29:25] maybe a lot do we go with the easy way
[29:27] or go the hard way he's going to put us
[29:29] through a lot so that because he values
[29:31] that relationship with us so much
[29:34] that he's willing to do that
[29:36] he wants us to get in his spirit
[29:42] so john turns around after he gets in
[29:45] the spirit
[29:46] and he sees this vision of seven golden
[29:51] candle sticks
[29:52] and
[29:53] brother branham shares on page 47 in the
[29:56] church age book here
[29:58] says we we have candlesticks in our
[30:01] king james bible but he says what he's
[30:03] he says actually they were lamp stands
[30:07] to represent the churches they could
[30:08] hardly be candles a candle burns but a
[30:10] while then is burned out and it dies
[30:12] there would be no more of it
[30:14] but lampstands possess a lasting quality
[30:18] not found in candles so it's it's a lamp
[30:21] stand
[30:22] that we're looking at and it's kind of
[30:24] interesting what why is this imagery
[30:27] used why is this symbolism used well
[30:29] when do we use
[30:30] a lamp stand when might we use a candle
[30:33] we don't use it
[30:35] they're there at noon in the bright
[30:36] daylight we'll use it at night and he
[30:38] said all the all these symbols that
[30:40] we're seeing in revelation chapter one
[30:42] he talks about stars candlesticks lamps
[30:44] what's it mean it means
[30:46] the dispensation that we're living in
[30:49] is a nighttime dispensation
[30:52] but that which we hear in darkness that
[30:54] which we hear in the night time we're
[30:55] gonna we're gonna we're gonna treasure
[30:57] it and we'll that night time will end
[30:59] we'll be able to shout it from the
[31:00] housetops but this is the dispensation
[31:02] we're living in it's a it's a it's a
[31:04] time of
[31:05] it's a time of night
[31:08] now when john talks about um these lamp
[31:11] stands
[31:12] and and brother brandon emphasizes it's
[31:14] not a candle because a candle is going
[31:16] to be exhausted very quickly but the
[31:18] lampstand has such an everlast
[31:20] is going to have an everlasting quality
[31:22] to it
[31:23] and to emphasize that brother graham
[31:26] branham goes to another place here in
[31:28] the old testament now where lamp stands
[31:30] are referred to again this emphasizes
[31:33] that this is a these lamp stands this
[31:35] light in this nighttime it's enduring if
[31:38] you've got just a little bit of light
[31:39] and the power has gone out or if you're
[31:42] if you're if you're
[31:44] if you're stranded somewhere and all you
[31:45] have is one little lamp you want to keep
[31:48] that lamp that fire lit as long as you
[31:49] can you don't want to lose it because
[31:51] you're desperate to preserve your fire
[31:54] well as a church
[31:55] going through this night cycle we can we
[31:57] don't have to worry about the fire going
[31:59] out
[32:00] because the source of fire it's being
[32:03] fed by the oil of the holy spirit and
[32:05] that never goes out we don't have to
[32:07] worry about that we can just rest
[32:10] and then zechariah chapter 4
[32:12] zechariah sees a vision
[32:15] an angel shows him something and this
[32:17] angel asks him and verse 2 what do you
[32:21] see and zechariah said i have looked and
[32:24] behold a candlestick all of gold
[32:27] with a ball upon the top of it and his
[32:30] seven lamps thereon
[32:31] and seven pipes to the seven lamps which
[32:33] are up on the top there zachariah must
[32:36] have been a real detailed person
[32:38] because he describes this very good
[32:40] detail you could draw this based on this
[32:42] description
[32:44] and the two olive trees buy it one upon
[32:46] the right side of the bowl and the other
[32:49] upon the left side of the bowl
[32:51] so i answered
[32:53] and spoke to the angel who talked with
[32:55] me saying what are these my lord then
[32:57] the angel that talked to me answered and
[32:59] said unto me you don't know what these
[33:01] be
[33:01] and i said no lord
[33:03] then he answered and spake unto me this
[33:05] is the word of the lord unto zerubbabel
[33:08] saying not by might
[33:10] not by power but by my spirit saith the
[33:14] lord of hosts this is an illustration
[33:17] that we can't live
[33:19] by our own power
[33:20] we can't live by our own spirit
[33:25] brother branham talks about this on page
[33:27] 48 of the church age but quote on the
[33:28] bottom of page four
[33:30] it's commenting upon this vision that
[33:32] zachariah saw he says here is another
[33:34] lamp
[33:35] of pure gold it's burning brightly
[33:38] because it has plenty of oil which it's
[33:40] getting from the two olive trees which
[33:42] stand on either side
[33:44] the two trees represent the old and new
[33:47] testament
[33:49] so where are we anchored i mean this
[33:50] this this lamp is anchored right in the
[33:53] scriptures
[33:54] and of course the oil typifies the holy
[33:56] ghost who alone can give the light of
[33:58] god to the people
[34:00] the angel who spoke to zechariah was as
[34:02] much as saying
[34:04] this what you see means the church
[34:06] cannot accomplish anything
[34:08] by its own might or power but by the
[34:11] holy ghost
[34:13] this is what we have need of and we can
[34:16] look at we have we have full assurance
[34:19] that olive trees that's the source of
[34:21] the oil this lamp is connected directly
[34:23] to the olive trees it's impossible this
[34:26] lamp could ever run out of wood it's
[34:27] connected to the source wall itself
[34:29] these olive trees and you talk about the
[34:31] old new testaments we want to be
[34:33] grounded in both of them drawing the
[34:34] holy spirit from both of them because
[34:36] it's not by our might or by our power
[34:38] but only by our but only by his spirit
[34:42] so the source of our light
[34:44] and its oil is inexhaustible we don't
[34:47] have to worry
[34:48] about about that
[34:54] in jesus christ
[34:56] if we look
[35:00] we'll take a look now at um revelation 1
[35:03] verse 12. i don't have this on the uh
[35:05] there on the slides we'll take a look at
[35:06] the rest of his
[35:08] that the rest of his vision
[35:11] revelation 1 12 and in the midst of the
[35:13] seven golden candle sticks so he sees
[35:15] this he turns he's in the spirit he
[35:17] turns
[35:18] he sees this these seven golden
[35:19] candlesticks and in the midst of the
[35:22] seven candlesticks
[35:24] one like unto the son of man
[35:26] close the garment down to the foot and
[35:29] gert about the paps with a golden girdle
[35:33] now the illustration that we have here
[35:35] on the screen this is the
[35:37] illustration of the candlesticks that
[35:40] was in the first that was in the edition
[35:42] of the church age book when it was
[35:44] printed i think in 1965
[35:47] and the
[35:48] little bit maybe even an odd picture if
[35:51] you're not acquainted with it but each
[35:53] of those little
[35:55] circles above the candlesticks look at
[35:57] the varying degrees of light and
[35:59] darkness
[36:01] they match a set of um
[36:05] which year it was but there was
[36:07] a an eclipse
[36:10] i think when the pope went to jerusalem
[36:12] if i recall right this i wasn't prepared
[36:13] for this part and there was pictures six
[36:16] pictures taken that match um
[36:19] pictures that brother branham had drawn
[36:21] on the wall um there in jeffersonville
[36:24] when he preaches on on the church ages
[36:27] as brother branham draws this out behind
[36:30] him the spirit of the lord came down
[36:32] and drew those all those very same
[36:34] things with with a light
[36:36] and i i work for
[36:38] for a school supported by
[36:40] um
[36:42] the dow foundation sister gladys dao who
[36:45] helped start the foundation she was in
[36:47] those meetings
[36:48] i never met her but brother jeff told
[36:52] the story when he was uh when he was
[36:54] still pastoring about how he was talking
[36:56] to he says yes i was there and you can
[36:58] hear me scream and are there on the tape
[37:00] when that when that fire came down and
[37:02] started illustrating that
[37:04] so it happened what it is
[37:06] light's good darkness is bad so at the
[37:10] first church age ephesus there's a lot
[37:12] of light because
[37:14] the the apostles are just proclaiming
[37:16] everything and the devil's the
[37:18] antichrist spirits just starting to ride
[37:20] just a little bit of darkness there but
[37:22] as you see
[37:23] darkness increases with every age to the
[37:26] smyrna and age to the pergamian age the
[37:28] dark ages the thyatiran age it's really
[37:31] dark there's just a little bit of light
[37:33] to see by
[37:34] you've got sardis here you've got the
[37:36] where martin when the reformation began
[37:39] a
[37:40] little bit of light not much in the
[37:42] philadelphian age when you get all the
[37:44] missionary age do what john wesley
[37:46] george whitfield another you see a
[37:48] little more
[37:49] light coming up there but then finally
[37:51] with laodicea if you were to take a um i
[37:54] don't know if i can do this certainly if
[37:55] you take a timeline here
[37:58] yeah i can draw this or not yeah
[38:01] okay if you take a timeline there you
[38:03] see that timeline
[38:06] if we were to take a time onto to the
[38:08] side of it as you're going through time
[38:10] it's getting darker and darker and
[38:12] darker as you end that circle of
[38:14] laodicea
[38:16] as you walk along the bottom of that of
[38:17] that last circle of laodicea that that
[38:20] dark that that light tapers off then
[38:23] there's still a bit of that circle
[38:24] that's left with all darkness
[38:27] and that's the end of this church age
[38:29] there's not much light out there at all
[38:31] it's just darkness brother branham has
[38:33] these
[38:34] had these visions because after 1977 i'd
[38:37] look for i all i see is just total
[38:39] darkness
[38:40] the time that we live in it's nighttime
[38:43] total
[38:44] darkness but john is seeing this vision
[38:47] at the very at the very beginning of
[38:49] this whole drama of this whole plot line
[38:52] john's seeing this vision
[38:54] and he sees this candlestick
[38:56] and who is in the middle of it all
[39:00] jesus is there in the middle
[39:02] as all this darkness seems to be
[39:04] prevailing the dark forces seem to be
[39:06] winning jesus is there and john and
[39:10] jesus tells tells john i'm alpha omega
[39:13] the first and the last what you see
[39:15] right in the book sent to the seven
[39:17] churches that it gets published so all
[39:19] the churches from here on out will know
[39:21] when it's dark when it's bad i'm right
[39:24] there with you you're not alone jesus
[39:27] wanted all the believers throughout
[39:29] history throughout the future to know
[39:31] it'll get bad but i'm right there with
[39:34] you you're not alone he said john write
[39:37] this down and tell this because we're
[39:38] really important they're going to think
[39:40] they're by themselves but they're not
[39:42] i'm right there with them
[39:44] it was really important to him he does
[39:46] that in the midst of the seven golden
[39:48] candlesticks there was one like the son
[39:50] of man we see that kind of phrasing
[39:52] another time when the it was really bad
[39:55] time nebuchadnezzar's through the three
[39:57] hebrew children of the fiery furnace
[39:59] nebuchadnezzar opens up his icy one
[40:01] light gun to the son of man the same
[40:03] person was there with them brought them
[40:05] out of their fiery trial is with us who
[40:08] will bring us out of our very dark trial
[40:12] he's right there with us and how is he
[40:13] clothed he's clothed the garment
[40:16] down to the foot
[40:17] gertie about the pabst the golden girdle
[40:19] his head and his hairs were white like
[40:21] wool and all these characteristics are
[40:24] going to be telling us about
[40:26] christ
[40:28] we'll look through the brother branham
[40:30] talks about this as his sevenfold glory
[40:32] they revealed him as
[40:34] coming as a judge a victorious judge his
[40:37] hair is white as snow like
[40:39] like like the wig a british judge would
[40:41] wear his eyes
[40:44] were as a flame of fire
[40:47] and
[40:48] these are all metaphors i was looking
[40:50] for a really nice image online to put on
[40:52] here and i finally stopped trying
[40:54] i was finding uh finding images where
[40:57] fire was little flames of fire were
[40:59] coming out of his eyes is where his
[41:01] mouth is a two-edged sword there's a
[41:03] sword coming out of his mouth and you
[41:04] can't take this literally these are
[41:06] these these are metaphors his eyes are
[41:08] flaming with fire because he's angry
[41:11] about what what what the devil has done
[41:13] to his world
[41:14] he's gonna judge him
[41:16] his feet like undefined brass as if they
[41:18] burned in the furnace and brass that's a
[41:20] metal that's connected to judgment there
[41:23] in the bible and the book deuteronomy
[41:25] talks about
[41:26] when the skies are his brass when it's
[41:28] time of time of drought
[41:31] the sin was
[41:33] when
[41:35] when the children of israel were being
[41:37] plagued by um by poisonous serpents
[41:40] moses put this brazen serpent upon a
[41:42] stick of wood so people could look and
[41:44] live in a serpent it was made of breath
[41:46] he was already judged
[41:48] so they could look it's like we look on
[41:50] christ because he took our judgment for
[41:52] us sin is already judged they're on the
[41:53] cross brass is symbolizing judgment
[41:57] that's why in the tabernacle you don't
[42:00] see brass in the holy of holies brass is
[42:02] where sin is being judged it's in the
[42:04] outer court you're offering sin
[42:05] offerings upon a brass altar but after
[42:08] their sin has been judged you can go off
[42:09] for prayer things like that i'll have a
[42:11] golden altar because gold speaks of god
[42:14] his voice is as the sound of many
[42:16] wanters and many wanters
[42:19] to be talking about brother branham
[42:21] explains is uh
[42:23] more depth than i i will we talked about
[42:25] many many people and the voices of many
[42:27] waters these are voices of gospel
[42:29] ministers giving words of warning
[42:31] throughout the ages
[42:33] the seven stars are in his right hand
[42:36] and the seven stars this is going to be
[42:39] extra special attention is going to be
[42:40] brought to these seven stars at the end
[42:42] of this chapter but these seven stars
[42:45] are the messenger of the seven churches
[42:47] brother branham doesn't come up with
[42:49] that the bible says that that the
[42:51] seventh stars are the messengers of the
[42:52] seven churches and there's a two-edged
[42:54] sword coming out of his mouth that's a
[42:56] metaphor for the word of god that's how
[42:59] god fights his battles with his word
[43:02] and then his face is shining like the
[43:04] sun
[43:04] and brother branham refers to malachi
[43:07] chapter four when after the millennium
[43:09] the sun of righteousness will rise with
[43:11] healing in his wings it's going to make
[43:13] all things
[43:14] new and good again so this seventh this
[43:17] vision of christ sevenfold glory show
[43:20] him coming as a judge show him that he's
[43:23] gonna make all things new and all things
[43:25] right
[43:26] i just want to say that we we we can
[43:28] look at this
[43:29] patentless vision on on a church age
[43:32] level that god is with his bride with
[43:33] his church with this special group
[43:35] throughout the whole throughout all of
[43:37] time
[43:38] we can take on a personal level also
[43:41] he's with us all of our dark times and
[43:43] all of our trials and i like this little
[43:46] little picture we have our after we get
[43:48] saved we have our picture we have our
[43:50] image in our mind
[43:51] how the how our walk with god is going
[43:53] to be like there's heaven i just got to
[43:54] make my one little sprint to the finish
[43:56] line i'm there it'll be easy but god's
[43:58] got a different plan
[44:00] and that's kind of what it looks like
[44:02] for the church ages up and down all
[44:03] kinds of difficulties but we can be
[44:06] assured through the whole thing
[44:09] he's right there with us he'll never
[44:11] leave us he'll never forsake us he's
[44:13] right there he's in our boat he's not
[44:16] going to forsake us we can stick right
[44:17] with him he'll be walking
[44:20] i love that he's he's uh his plan is is
[44:24] perfect
[44:26] and when john sees him
[44:28] john i mean
[44:29] john
[44:30] gets in the spirit he turns around he
[44:33] sees this vision of the seven golden
[44:34] candlesticks he describes
[44:36] in multiple verses the glory of what of
[44:39] of what he's seeing of this one like the
[44:41] son of man of jesus christ
[44:43] and when he saw him i it's amazing and
[44:46] john sees him he immediately falls his
[44:48] feet as dead but in that one moment that
[44:50] he saw he saw so much he could describe
[44:52] so beautifully in those three or four
[44:54] verses but he just had a glimpse but he
[44:56] falls on his face as dead
[44:59] and he laid his right hand upon me
[45:01] saying
[45:02] fear not and to make that's what
[45:05] whenever god comes to us every angel
[45:07] comes to us his first words are fear not
[45:11] fear not
[45:12] i am the first and the last
[45:15] i am he that liveth and was dead and
[45:17] behold i am alive forevermore
[45:21] they couldn't kill me
[45:23] they couldn't get me
[45:24] they can't get you either because you've
[45:26] got my spirit in there i'm the living
[45:28] proof john you have nothing to fear
[45:32] i am alive forevermore amen
[45:37] and i like that name of god he is the
[45:40] amen that's one of god's titles he is
[45:43] the amen and why is that important
[45:46] because god always has the last word in
[45:50] our trials he's the amen amen means last
[45:54] word
[45:55] he has the amen the devil does not ever
[45:58] have the last word over us ever he
[46:01] always tries to throw something in there
[46:03] to get us all messed up says no
[46:05] god's got the last word i'm going to
[46:07] wait for his last room not getting
[46:08] myself into this but the devil said
[46:10] because god's got the last word he's the
[46:12] god of the amen so we wait on his word
[46:15] and we hold on to it because he is the
[46:17] god of the amen
[46:20] he's the lord over all history the
[46:22] present the past the future and he's
[46:24] telling john he's telling him john make
[46:26] sure the churches know that difficult
[46:28] times are coming but they'll never be
[46:31] alone this emperor domitian who thinks
[46:34] he's god who can persecute you and they
[46:36] do whatever he thinks he's he's he's on
[46:37] a power trip he's not i am the amen i
[46:41] have the last word
[46:44] he says don't fear john
[46:46] this is brother brandon's paraphrase
[46:48] here don't fear john don't fear little
[46:50] flock
[46:51] all that i am you are heir to all my
[46:55] power is yours my omnipotence is yours
[46:58] as i stand in your midst i have not come
[47:01] to bring fear and failure
[47:04] when god brings a trial in their lives
[47:06] it's not a gotcha moment ah
[47:09] i knew you didn't know the right answer
[47:10] now you got to write sentences and stay
[47:12] after class that's not why god brings a
[47:14] trial to us god doesn't come to show us
[47:17] what we can't do
[47:19] god's not he does not come to bring fear
[47:21] and failure but love and courage and
[47:24] ability because in our trials we get
[47:26] drawn so close to him we know what's in
[47:29] him we know what's in us and we get
[47:31] drawn so much closer we have confidence
[47:34] because we've spent that personal
[47:35] special time
[47:37] with him
[47:38] i've not come to bring fear and failure
[47:40] but love and courage and ability all
[47:43] power is given unto me and it is yours
[47:45] to use you speak the word i'll perform
[47:48] it this is my
[47:50] covenant
[47:51] and it can never fail
[47:56] so he says write the things that you've
[47:58] seen the things which are the things
[47:59] that shall be you're after
[48:01] the mystery of the seven stars which you
[48:03] saw on my right hand and the seven
[48:05] golden candlesticks write all of this
[48:07] it's important
[48:08] the seven stars of the angels of the
[48:10] seven churches the seven candlesticks
[48:12] which you saw
[48:13] are
[48:14] the seven churches
[48:16] and i think the important question here
[48:19] for us on the personal level then
[48:22] is
[48:23] where
[48:24] do we have
[48:25] our wick
[48:27] that's the important question because
[48:29] it's a lamp stand
[48:31] that's connected to like in zechariah's
[48:34] visions these olive trees with an
[48:36] inexhaustible supply of the holy spirit
[48:38] inexhaustible if we want to burn
[48:41] brightly all we have to do is put our
[48:44] wick in god's oil and we will burn
[48:46] brightly we don't have to do anything
[48:48] except put our wick and that we have to
[48:49] do anything except
[48:51] just relax in god's spirit and he's
[48:53] going to make us burn brightly we'll be
[48:55] we'll have that
[48:58] i was going to try to do a little
[49:00] science demonstration here at the very
[49:02] end but it would take way too long to
[49:04] achieve the results i wanted to achieve
[49:07] so i just got pictures
[49:08] but there's a science administration
[49:11] that's often an elementary classroom
[49:12] some of you might have done it before
[49:14] with your children but you can take a
[49:17] piece of celery
[49:18] cut the bottoms of them off
[49:20] and put them into into different
[49:23] cups with colored water with with food
[49:26] coloring
[49:27] and you'll see if you look closely at
[49:29] the leaves of the cellar this takes a
[49:31] couple maybe a day or two to actually
[49:32] get this result and i didn't want
[49:33] service to go that long on the wednesday
[49:35] night but you can see that the leaves
[49:38] are of the cellar are starting to color
[49:41] why is that it's because if you look at
[49:43] the bottom of the cell to take it out
[49:46] the capillaries in the cellular drawing
[49:49] up that water this is how plants take
[49:52] the water out of the earth and get them
[49:54] into themselves
[49:56] this is what happens when we immerse
[49:58] ourselves
[50:00] whether it be in the holy spirit whether
[50:02] it be it's not some worldly thing it's
[50:04] good it's osmosis is a spiritual
[50:07] principle too
[50:09] whenever we put ourselves in
[50:11] we're going to absorb we're going to
[50:13] absorb what we're going to put our wick
[50:15] into and this is amazing if you peel
[50:17] back the celery
[50:18] you can peel it back and you see oh
[50:20] those capillaries draw that color all
[50:24] through the plant all the way through it
[50:26] works
[50:27] and if you were to do a spiritual um
[50:31] a spiritual dissection of of a believer
[50:33] just really in the spirit of god you'll
[50:36] be able to look and see ah
[50:37] all their spiritual blood vessels all
[50:40] all their spiritual veins and all just
[50:42] absorbing god's spirit you'd be able to
[50:44] see that just like you see it there in
[50:45] the plant
[50:47] what are we putting ourselves what kind
[50:49] of spirit are we exposing ourselves
[50:51] putting ourselves into because there's
[50:54] an amazing promise that's given here to
[50:57] the overcomer if you immerse yourselves
[50:59] in god's oil
[51:00] what riches of blessings
[51:03] i really love the uh the quote here that
[51:05] brother branham kind of closes with says
[51:07] how thrilling it is to think of those
[51:09] seven lamps drawing life and light from
[51:12] the resources of that main bull because
[51:15] they had their lit their wicks
[51:18] dipped therein
[51:19] each church age messenger is depicted
[51:22] here his life is on fire with the holy
[51:24] ghost his wick his life has been
[51:27] immersed in christ
[51:29] through that wick he's drawing the very
[51:31] life of christ and by it he gives out
[51:34] light to the church
[51:36] what a beautiful blessing
[51:39] but jesus tells his disciples and us in
[51:41] matthew chapter 10 that if you receive
[51:44] him
[51:45] sorry he says he that receiveth you
[51:46] receiveth me he that receiveth me
[51:50] receiveth him that sent me he receives a
[51:52] prophet the name of a prophet receives a
[51:54] prophet's reward if this is the promise
[51:56] through the church age messenger
[51:59] we can do the same thing because we can
[52:00] receive him we get that reward as well
[52:03] he received the righteous man in the
[52:04] name of a righteous man receive a
[52:05] righteous man's reward so he says he
[52:08] goes on to say not only can we speak
[52:10] this way of the messengers but every
[52:12] true believer is dramatically depicted
[52:15] here these lamp stands are a beautiful
[52:17] portrayal of what it means to be in the
[52:20] spirit just that we're just we just let
[52:23] our wicked abs absorb that oil and as
[52:26] soon as the fire of god's spirit comes
[52:27] down it just burns brightly
[52:30] this is where the life with christ is
[52:31] about
[52:33] but isn't this isn't just for the
[52:34] messengers this is for every true
[52:36] believer they're all drawing from the
[52:38] same source they've all been dipped into
[52:41] the same bowl they're dead to themselves
[52:44] their lives are hid with christ in god
[52:48] they're sealed in by the holy ghost
[52:50] their lives cannot be tampered with what
[52:53] is security the devil cannot hack your
[52:55] life the devil cannot get in there he
[52:58] can't
[52:59] if you're sealed by the holy spirit
[53:00] brother branham says in the breach the
[53:01] only way he could get in is by is by
[53:04] getting the holy spirit too and brother
[53:05] ramsey and then he'd be your brother
[53:08] you're completely secure you can't be
[53:11] tampered with he's a bluff
[53:13] the visible life is burning and shining
[53:16] giving light and manifestation of the
[53:18] holy ghost the inner invisible life is
[53:21] hidden in god and fed by the lord's word
[53:24] and it will never run out
[53:27] ever
[53:28] this is what it means
[53:30] the point for me the point of the patmos
[53:32] vision is this reassurance he'll never
[53:34] leave us or forsake us he never has the
[53:37] the church as a whole the bride as a
[53:39] whole can go through very difficult
[53:40] times but jesus is right there within
[53:42] the spirit of god's right through with
[53:44] him we can go through difficult times
[53:46] but we get in the spirit we turn around
[53:48] and say oh there he is i thought he i
[53:50] was looking at all the wrong things when
[53:53] we get in the wrong spirit we don't see
[53:55] him we have to get in the spirit and
[53:58] then we see and that peace comes back
[54:01] and that's
[54:02] i think the key question for me as we
[54:05] kind of close is just the question is
[54:07] where do we have our wick that's right
[54:11] john it took it might have taken him a
[54:12] while there on patmos to realize oh yeah
[54:14] i wanted i
[54:16] it took him all to get in the spirit but
[54:17] once he got there all he saw what god
[54:19] was his
[54:20] revelation outpoured like it never had
[54:23] before
[54:25] then um as we just closed missions can
[54:28] come
[54:28] brother brandon closes this this chapter
[54:31] saying this country talk about the seven
[54:33] stars that are in his right hand what a
[54:34] comforting place to be in there
[54:37] it's on page 59
[54:45] he says when you think of that little
[54:47] group
[54:48] whose members were sawn asunder fed the
[54:50] lions persecuted and driven from pillar
[54:53] to post and yet stayed true to the word
[54:56] now definitely that would have to be god
[55:00] not by might by power but my spirit
[55:02] saith the lord how they survived their
[55:04] battle of faith and carried on still
[55:06] that is a miracle
[55:09] and this comfort is not for the seven
[55:12] church age messengers only this cumber
[55:14] you're going to make it that's not for
[55:16] the seven church age messengers only
[55:18] every true believer is in the hand of
[55:20] god
[55:21] and can draw from his love and power and
[55:24] receive the full benefit
[55:26] of all that god is to the believer
[55:29] what god gives the messenger how he
[55:31] blesses and uses the messenger
[55:34] is an example to all believers of his
[55:37] goodness and care to
[55:39] all members of his body
[55:42] what an assurance that is
[55:45] all we have to do have access to it is
[55:48] put our life in his hands
[55:50] put our wick there in his hands
[55:53] amen
[55:55] do the song he has all in control
[56:01] if we can just um
[56:04] pray
[56:05] and ask the lord to
[56:07] help us to get in the spirit more
[56:09] as well it can be so easy um
[56:13] to lose track of where we are just like
[56:14] our we can get busy on their little on
[56:16] our simula this life is a simulation
[56:20] is the example of a joystick and a
[56:22] flight simulator
[56:23] our our our life's a simulation the
[56:25] things we're doing here at work
[56:27] or walk with god that's the real thing
[56:30] on our simulation we can get out of the
[56:32] spirit we need to recalibrate it and
[56:34] then we can fly straight again
[56:36] amen let's pray
[56:38] heavenly father we thank you very much
[56:40] for your goodness and grace lord

[57:29] to us we would have given up how many
[57:31] times were we different places on the
[57:33] point of giving up but there was
[57:35] something that that held us and it
[57:36] wasn't us
