[6:40] son
[6:41] First Peter chapter 3 and verse 7
[6:44] likewise ye husbands
[6:46] dwell with them according to knowledge
[6:49] giving honor unto the wife as unto the
[6:53] weaker vessel and as being heirs
[6:56] together of the grace of life that your
[6:59] prayers be not hindered so there's a
[7:02] certain violation of respect that can
[7:06] take place when a husband does not view
[7:10] his wife correctly
[7:12] there's a certain violation of respect
[7:14] and so the scripture deals with it very
[7:17] clearly and this will coincide with my
[7:20] subject Sunday on Oneness in my series
[7:22] on Oneness and I want to get into
[7:23] particulars here a little bit but in the
[7:26] marriage relationship and in the husband
[7:27] and wife relationship a Godly husband or
[7:31] a God man must with respect and honor
[7:34] look at the wife properly as being the
[7:36] Waker vessel but at the same time
[7:37] realizing that your heirs together of
[7:41] the grace of life that your prayers may
[7:43] be not hindered so there is a violation
[7:45] something that a husband can do by
[7:47] simply not looking at his wife with the
[7:50] right balance and thus brings dishonor
[7:53] because he uses the word honor excuse me
[7:56] use the word dwelling with him according
[7:58] to knowledge honoring of the way he uses
[8:00] the word honor and us under the weaker
[8:03] vessel as being ears together so there's
[8:04] a Oneness with God and there's a Oneness
[8:07] with one another and that never changes
[8:10] even though her vessel is the weaker
[8:13] vessel so if a man does not look at that
[8:15] right he will not respect her right and
[8:18] thus his prayers to God will be hindered
[8:23] I'm not hearing any echoing amens in
[8:25] here
[8:26] but it's the truth nonetheless
[8:28] and so if we apply that to all
[8:30] relationships and that's what I'm
[8:32] speaking on relationships if we apply
[8:34] that now then we have to have an
[8:36] understanding of who each member in the
[8:39] body of Christ is in order for the
[8:41] respect level to stay very high because
[8:44] if we lose respect then we've lost
[8:47] something in the sense of how we view
[8:49] that person everybody understand
[8:51] so then it goes on to say finally be of
[8:55] all one mind be ye of all one mind
[8:57] having compassion one of Another Love is
[9:00] Brethren be pitiful be courteous not
[9:03] rendering evil for evil somebody did me
[9:05] wrong I'm going to do them wrong back no
[9:07] no that's not what we do or railing for
[9:10] railing but contrary wise blessings so
[9:12] somebody does you bad we send them back
[9:14] a blessing wow
[9:16] knowing that ye there there unto called
[9:20] You're they're into called that ye
[9:22] should inherit a blessing for he that
[9:25] will love life and see good days let him
[9:28] refrain his tongue from evil and his
[9:32] lips that speak no guile let him assure
[9:35] evil and do good let him seek in peace
[9:40] and ensue it it's about relationships
[9:44] it's about relationships it's all about
[9:47] relationship we say well who with
[9:48] everybody
[9:50] this is how we Christians view things
[9:52] and when he says things like he that
[9:53] will love life how many how many love
[9:55] life I want to have a good life
[9:58] all right a few of us for he that will
[10:00] love life and see good days let him
[10:02] refrain his tongue from evil what you
[10:05] say
[10:07] can be tied to the quality of life for
[10:11] what that he will love life and see good
[10:13] days let him refrain his tongue from
[10:14] evil so what we say is important and his
[10:16] lips from that they speak no guy let him
[10:20] assure evil run From Evil and do good
[10:22] let him seek peace if you want
[10:25] relationships we're the one that's
[10:26] always seeking peace reconciliation
[10:30] whatever we have to do can you say Amen
[10:32] so I'm going to Echo so I feel better so
[10:35] I'm gonna Echo a little bit a couple of
[10:36] points that I preach Sunday so that we
[10:38] understand
[10:40] when first of all when Jesus gave his
[10:43] final words of what the church will do I
[10:46] talked about three or four of them when
[10:47] he left this Earth at least in his
[10:49] physical body he gave instructions to
[10:51] the church he gave where the church will
[10:53] go and one of them was the Great
[10:55] Commission and I was I wanted to make
[10:57] the Clear Point that the commission was
[11:00] not just to certain Believers it wasn't
[11:01] just to Apostles the Great Commission of
[11:04] go into the world and preach the gospel
[11:06] and cast out devils and they shall lay
[11:08] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[11:10] that commission is to every holy
[11:12] ghost-filled believer there's no
[11:14] exceptions to it can you say Amen so I
[11:17] wanted to make the point that another
[11:19] con another prophecy he gave for the
[11:21] church is what I'm preaching on is that
[11:23] when he said that they will receive my
[11:26] glory and they will become one with one
[11:29] another as we are one the father and the
[11:32] son they will become one with us excuse
[11:36] me not with us but with Christ and they
[11:39] will become one with one another another
[11:40] that's a prophecy but that's Jesus
[11:42] prophesying this Jesus saying this is
[11:44] what the church will become my point
[11:46] just like the Great Commission it's not
[11:49] just to certain ones to become one with
[11:51] one another it's all holy ghost filled
[11:54] Believers and whether we think it's
[11:55] going to happen or not it doesn't matter
[11:57] it's going to happen because Jesus said
[12:00] it and if Jesus said it that settles it
[12:03] so no matter how bad it looks is that I
[12:05] don't we're never going to come into
[12:06] unity in this in this message but it's
[12:09] just it seems so divided well that's
[12:10] looking in the negative side I'm looking
[12:12] at what Jesus said and I'm looking at
[12:14] the local congregation more than even a
[12:17] nationwide or worldwide let it start at
[12:20] home he said because of the glory coming
[12:23] into the church they will become one can
[12:26] you say Amen
[12:28] so there's no exceptions you can't say
[12:30] well I don't have to participate in that
[12:32] even though I want to be a Sunday
[12:33] morning Christian at the church I don't
[12:35] have to no no this is by the Holy Ghost
[12:37] and if you say you have the Holy Spirit
[12:39] and the holy spirit's number one
[12:41] evidence the evidence of the holy spirit
[12:43] is to believe the word from your heart
[12:45] forever for the age that you live in and
[12:47] if you believe that I believe every word
[12:49] then I just read to you Jesus word for
[12:52] the church especially at the end time
[12:54] when it is the day of Oneness he said at
[12:57] that day ye shall know I and the father
[12:59] I and you you and me at that day they
[13:03] will become one
[13:04] the second Echo I want to give from
[13:06] Sunday is Isaiah 53 and it was
[13:09] interesting to see uh someone has
[13:11] suggested to listen to brother Donnie
[13:13] from Sunday morning he was on the same
[13:14] scripture as I was Isaiah 53 making some
[13:17] wonderful points but here's the point I
[13:19] was making out of it is God was pleased
[13:22] and satisfied with the offering and the
[13:26] sacrifice of Christ
[13:28] he was pleased that's the word he was
[13:30] pleased to see him bruised God was
[13:33] pleased he was satisfied with that
[13:36] sacrifice and why was God satisfied with
[13:38] that sacrifice why would God even be
[13:40] happy about suffering it's not that it's
[13:43] not that we have a God that just says I
[13:45] love when people suffer I like to make
[13:47] people suffer no no that doesn't have
[13:49] anywhere where it's going but when he
[13:51] sees the sacrifice of Christ laying down
[13:54] his life by his own choice can you say
[13:56] Amen but here's why it's it is God is
[13:59] here's why he's pleased with it God is
[14:01] pleased and satisfied with the offering
[14:04] or sacrifice that dies to self in order
[14:08] to restore relationship and bring true
[14:12] Oneness because Christ in his suffering
[14:16] would bring many sons many sons to Glory
[14:20] as well so what God's satisfied because
[14:22] this decision that Christ has made I'm
[14:26] satisfied I'm breathing this in this
[14:28] suffering this pain this thorn in his uh
[14:31] Crown all these other things taking
[14:33] place God was satisfied why not just
[14:36] because of suffering this suffering
[14:37] restored relationship with God and man
[14:40] this suffering broke the middle walls of
[14:43] partition between us this suffering
[14:45] brought better relationship not just
[14:47] better but brought man back one with God
[14:50] this suffering would open a way for them
[14:54] to receive the actual holy ghost in
[14:56] their soul without Calvary you had no
[15:00] place to receive the Holy Ghost
[15:02] but because somebody suffered it would
[15:05] burn out the sin they would burn out the
[15:06] defiling serpent nature and replace it
[15:09] with what the very nature of God and
[15:12] that what happens when you have the
[15:13] nature of God in you you have the same
[15:15] nature as the author written in the word
[15:17] and he has the same nature as the other
[15:19] person sitting next to you that has the
[15:20] Holy Ghost that's how you can become one
[15:23] with them
[15:24] not because you agree on everything
[15:27] intellectually but because by the same
[15:29] nature if I have the nature of Christ
[15:32] within me I don't have any problem being
[15:34] one with him
[15:36] because by Nature I have been bonded and
[15:40] bonded is such a a just a very surface
[15:44] word to use in this this is a Oneness
[15:46] that no man can achieve this is one by
[15:50] spirit I am one with him because I have
[15:54] his Spirit within me tonight
[15:57] you talk about relationship
[15:59] that's not two Spirits trying to get
[16:01] along that's becoming one because you
[16:03] are the same Spirit that's why tonight I
[16:05] can say Amen to the word of God that's
[16:07] why since 16 years old I have no problem
[16:09] saying Amen to the world to the to the
[16:11] word I have no problem it's something
[16:13] resonates with it every time you hear
[16:14] the word and even when I'm convicted I
[16:17] have no problem responding I trust it if
[16:19] if the word takes the height off of my
[16:21] back or encourages encourages me and I'm
[16:24] on cloud nine for the week it doesn't
[16:27] matter if there's an A Matter down here
[16:29] he put it there can you say amen that's
[16:31] why I can say Amen to the Lord there's
[16:33] no resistance down here my flesh
[16:35] sometimes says
[16:37] that's probably the way it sounds but
[16:39] but my soul is always saying that's hard
[16:42] in my flesh but it's a man amen that's
[16:45] me I love that that's me yes that's my
[16:48] husband Christ I'm his wife and I say
[16:51] amen and I submit to that word there is
[16:54] no resistance in my soul
[16:57] because I've met the author and I have
[16:59] the author living in me so because God
[17:03] was satisfied with that sacrifice that
[17:05] is explained in Isaiah 53 he was pleased
[17:08] to bruise him in order to restore
[17:10] relationship then we learn something
[17:13] that there is a suffering and sacrifice
[17:16] that is made when you want to make
[17:18] relationships better
[17:21] now
[17:22] let's let's just say this if you reach
[17:26] out christ-like and you go through
[17:28] prayer I want to reconcile I want to
[17:31] restore I want to see things reconciled
[17:34] in a relationship that's wrong and bad
[17:36] someone did me wrong whatever it is I
[17:37] did them wrong
[17:39] they may not always respond right right
[17:43] away did we all respond right away
[17:46] to the Lord
[17:49] some did some right away but some of you
[17:51] man you took a long time
[17:55] and it was God's love that went to
[17:57] Calvary for you it was God's love that
[17:59] wouldn't found you it was God's love
[18:00] reaching out to you when you were
[18:02] rebuked for for your earrings and your
[18:04] short dresses and your makeup and all
[18:07] this stuff and you came in the first
[18:08] service and the preacher Just Whipped
[18:10] all that stuff when you come in there
[18:12] you didn't feel you so much you didn't
[18:14] feel so much it was the love of God but
[18:16] yet if there's something within you that
[18:19] changes you
[18:20] can you say man and that's that's my
[18:23] husband talking so in when when God's
[18:26] reaching out to restore a relationship
[18:27] he goes to Calvary and he starts to move
[18:29] on You by the Holy Spirit and you it's
[18:32] not everybody that responds to being
[18:34] reconciled by right away
[18:36] so if that applies with God dealing with
[18:38] us it applies when we bring a
[18:40] christ-like spirit to say I'm going to
[18:42] sacrifice I don't want to be so focused
[18:44] here I'm going to make right what I've
[18:46] done wrong but I want to have an open
[18:47] conversation with somebody and I want to
[18:49] talk to them I want to say to them
[18:51] listen is there anything I can do to
[18:54] make our relationship better is there
[18:55] anything I can do to to restore what's
[18:58] been lost years ago is there anything
[19:00] that can be done and when you start
[19:02] asking questions like that and you start
[19:04] being open like that you may not always
[19:07] get the response back because the Holy
[19:09] Spirit has to do it in their life too
[19:11] but nevertheless Christ reached out when
[19:13] while we were yet sinners Christ died
[19:16] for us
[19:18] praise the Lord
[19:20] so now I I want to talk about how
[19:22] Oneness Works in different vessels
[19:24] because you know we are all different
[19:26] vessels we are all different
[19:28] personalities your personality is not
[19:31] sin it's before I get into sin in
[19:33] person's life because sin when you cross
[19:35] over after the garden everything comes
[19:38] into relationships all relationships are
[19:40] broken down they don't have the
[19:41] potential anymore to be what they were
[19:43] in the Garden of Eden before jealousy
[19:46] comes in hatred comes in blaming comes
[19:49] in
[19:50] the glory of God departs from them
[19:52] there's nothing there to work off of as
[19:54] far as Oneness with other people and
[19:56] your husband and wife it's gone it's
[19:57] gone that's why today without god
[19:59] without the glory of God it's difficult
[20:02] to hold a marriage together
[20:04] because he's the one that created
[20:06] marriage right and we don't have an
[20:08] understanding have the glory of God
[20:09] we're just working off an intellect and
[20:11] surviving basically but you see now
[20:13] there's something greater than surviving
[20:15] there's overcoming there's the glory of
[20:17] God and when it comes into our life then
[20:19] we have something getting us back so I'm
[20:22] not getting in the next few weeks I'll
[20:24] get into the sin part because there are
[20:26] normal things that are happening still
[20:29] today in relationships that we're still
[20:31] calling normal but they're normal under
[20:34] after the fall and after sin and we're
[20:38] still doing some of those things because
[20:40] we've been taught that's normal but
[20:42] we've been taught by Hollywood the
[20:44] movies you watched whatever you were
[20:46] taught and so it's ingrained in your
[20:48] system this is normal this is how I
[20:49] treat another person this is how I act
[20:51] this is how I respond but there were
[20:53] things that happened under the fall like
[20:56] blaming one another like jealousy like
[20:58] sin like like all those things came from
[21:00] the fall they didn't come from before
[21:02] the fall they came after and so now we
[21:04] need to to look at whatever's happening
[21:06] under sin we need to at least say if I'm
[21:08] doing that wait a minute God you're
[21:10] teaching me this isn't normal this is an
[21:12] order to normal to be a rage of anger in
[21:16] front of my children and in a rage of
[21:18] anger just yelling in their face and
[21:20] anger and belittling them and and and
[21:23] and belittling their character let me
[21:25] tell you brother whoever you are or
[21:27] sister that's not normal
[21:30] that's not normal that's not normal
[21:32] behavior for a Christian
[21:34] if you make a mistake bring it under the
[21:36] Crossman when that's a pattern and it's
[21:38] broken relationships your whole your
[21:40] whole life your whole life
[21:43] you need to really look at your
[21:44] experience with God
[21:46] because the glory of the Lord would be
[21:48] changing that
[21:49] that's under the fall that's treatment
[21:52] of other relationships under the fall
[21:54] that's not when the glory of God comes
[21:57] in it begins to change
[22:00] I may remember that from Sunday from
[22:03] glory to glory he's changing me
[22:06] so what's it changing the nature of the
[22:09] Fall was the serpent nature all that
[22:10] came with it uh just all the separations
[22:13] all the breakup all the broken
[22:15] relationship with God everything come
[22:17] from the fall now because of coward the
[22:19] glory of God comes back to his church
[22:21] comes in by the Holy Ghost and now we
[22:23] come into a process now of by Nature
[22:26] saying I'm reversing God's saying I'm
[22:28] reversing all these patterns that broke
[22:31] relationship and you've got something
[22:33] within you that builds strong
[22:35] Relationships by the Holy Ghost
[22:39] Hallelujah
[22:40] you got something that reconciles
[22:42] relationship that's you you got
[22:43] something what do I do I look to the
[22:45] word this is what I need to do in this
[22:46] situation when I do this person that
[22:47] hates me the word tells you what to do
[22:50] you get rebellious say I'm going to do
[22:51] it my own way you know I'm gonna no no
[22:53] no no no
[22:54] we're under the glory of God here
[22:56] and from glory and Glory he's changing
[22:58] us can you say Amen
[23:00] so now you know
[23:03] we're living in the day
[23:05] at that day you shall know I and the
[23:08] father
[23:09] I knew you and me them and one another
[23:11] Oneness we're living in the day of
[23:14] Oneness
[23:15] and intimacy with the Lord
[23:17] please don't read that word intimacy
[23:19] wrong the world has made it a sexual
[23:21] experience or whatever intimacy is a a
[23:24] complete open relationship without walls
[23:26] there's no hindrances there's no walls
[23:29] we're living in the day being restored
[23:31] back to True Oneness with God and one
[23:33] another and true intimacy with God and
[23:37] with one another
[23:39] no walls a relationship without walls
[23:41] people talk about Revival take we got
[23:44] this that and I rejoice in any rejoicing
[23:47] of the word of God I mean if God
[23:50] whatever God can change the atmosphere
[23:52] in any service and do whatever he wants
[23:54] to do
[23:55] but if you want to know your pastor what
[23:57] kind of Revival he's looking for I'm
[23:59] looking for a Revival
[24:01] and to come to the true Oneness it's a
[24:04] Revival to me when someone truly
[24:06] forgives another Christian when
[24:08] Believers come into Oneness and die to
[24:10] themselves I'm wondering after Sunday's
[24:12] service
[24:13] I wonder how many brothers went down and
[24:16] sat with their families this week and
[24:18] said after what was preached
[24:20] I'd like to sit down and talk with you
[24:22] and I'd like to have an open
[24:23] relationship how many brothers did it to
[24:25] their wives I'm not saying you had to do
[24:27] it I'm just wondering what effect this
[24:28] has happened because we can not in
[24:31] church all we want to
[24:32] but if we were serious with God then we
[24:35] say now I'm going to be open with my
[24:38] family with my wife and I'm going to say
[24:39] what can I do to make the relationship
[24:42] better what have I done is there any
[24:44] walls up here that we can tear down so
[24:46] Satan quits getting the glory
[24:50] I'm not saying that to be because
[24:52] probably most didn't do it and I'm not
[24:54] putting you down because but I'm asking
[24:56] you is that what are we taking from this
[24:58] series in relationships to go ahead and
[25:00] go the way of Calvary and the cross and
[25:03] say I'm going to go the suffering and
[25:04] the hard way a way that God's pleased
[25:07] with because if there is a reconciling a
[25:09] relationship at the end of it God is
[25:10] satisfied
[25:12] if that's a suffering thing to do God is
[25:14] satisfied I think it's a Revival when
[25:16] someone forgives someone when Believers
[25:18] come into Oneness and die to themselves
[25:20] for a greater Oneness in their marriage
[25:21] and family and others that's also what
[25:24] Jesus said the church would come to not
[25:26] just the Great Commission not just
[25:28] casting out devils not just if they
[25:31] drink any deadly thing not just they
[25:33] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[25:35] shall recover he said they will become
[25:38] one as we are one that's part of the end
[25:42] time revival can I get an amen tonight
[25:44] don't forget Oneness is a part of the
[25:47] end time Revival it's not just laying on
[25:50] hands it's not just healing lines that's
[25:52] all part of it the supernatural needs to
[25:55] show himself in the Church of God a book
[25:58] of Acts Church repeat it again
[26:01] can you say Amen friends
[26:03] but don't forget the book of Acts Church
[26:05] it wasn't just all miracles when someone
[26:08] lied to the Holy Ghost they got in
[26:09] trouble for it
[26:11] don't forget the book of Acts Church
[26:13] they sold all their goods because they
[26:15] were trying to meet the need in someone
[26:17] else there was other things working in
[26:19] the book of Acts church and Jesus said
[26:20] at the end they will become one as we
[26:23] are one that's the Revival that I am
[26:26] looking for and this word I believe will
[26:28] produce it can you say Amen now I wanted
[26:31] to say here that God created us a
[26:33] relational being
[26:36] in the beginning God created you a
[26:39] relational being what do you believe
[26:40] what do you where'd you get that
[26:43] it is not good for man to be alone and I
[26:46] use man not just in the sense of the
[26:47] brothers but the sisters because
[26:49] remember they were together as one
[26:51] Spirit masculine and feminine right
[26:54] so then he says it is not good to then
[26:57] he puts them in two vessels then then he
[26:59] has Adam there it is not good for man to
[27:01] be alone so he begins the process of
[27:03] taking the feminine part out they've
[27:06] never lost their one not Oneness because
[27:08] when he took her out he said and they
[27:10] too
[27:11] shall a man leave his father and mother
[27:13] and cleave unto his wife and the two
[27:16] shall be one so the Oneness hasn't been
[27:18] broken there's still one in spirit
[27:21] but now their vessels are different
[27:23] okay and so God has created us a
[27:27] relational being it is not good for man
[27:30] to be alone
[27:32] if man is detached from relationship
[27:35] with others of his kind it's not good
[27:38] and it's not of God
[27:40] if someone would say I don't need
[27:42] anybody I don't need friends all friends
[27:45] have hurt me I don't need any friends
[27:48] anymore
[27:49] I don't need people
[27:51] I had a fellow tell me one time years
[27:53] ago he says I want to come to your
[27:55] church but he says I really don't want
[27:57] to be around the people I want to come
[27:58] and hear the preaching and get in my car
[28:00] and head home I don't need people and uh
[28:03] he's already off track and doesn't know
[28:05] his Bible because Christ is living in
[28:07] his people thank you for watching our
