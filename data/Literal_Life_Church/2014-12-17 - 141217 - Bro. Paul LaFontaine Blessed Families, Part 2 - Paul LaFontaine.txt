TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I am I am blessed I am blessed I am blessed every day that I live when I wake up in the morning till I lay my head to rest I am blessed Hallelujah I amess one more time and you're blessed tonight I am blessed I am blessed every day that I live I am blessed amen when I wake up in the morning till I lay my head I am blessed Hallelujah I am blessed amen let's give the Lord a hand clap of praise tonight Abraham seed tonight then we're blessed amen how many believe you're Abraham seed amen and we're a blessed group of people because of that because of his faith and that Faith passed down from generation to generation that same family God certainly blesses those families and that's what we were speaking on last Wednesday night we want to pick it up again if you want to turn with me to Genesis 12 in mentioning uh the prayer request I don't know if one of my family members wrote in but Gabriel is sick tonight home with um some type of sickness she came home from school early today so remember her in prayer and also continue to remember brother Ed's son there is very serious condition if you would we certainly appreciate it we're truly blessed tonight and uh we've had about I think $4,200 towards the furnace from the church here raised and our total is going to be 6,500 for both the units which as we said Sunday is a very uh I'll say as brother John said it's a miracle to have both units put in for the labor and everything for that so you just remember that if the Lord puts it on your heart to give towards that we're almost reached our goal to pay that off so we won't have to use any money out of the building fund if we raise it in the church here so we thank God for that amen praise the Lord we're going to we're speaking out about blessed families that's what it says here in Genesis 12:3 so we're going to continue this little series I might just go back a little bit over it from last Wednesday night so we can kind of check the uh channel that we're going in and uh we just pray that it'll be a blessing to you tonight as we just teach these things Genesis 12:1 the Lord had said unto Abraham get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House unto a land that I will show thee and I will make thee a great nation and I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and I will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed amen heavenly father thank you for your promise that Lord through this Faith line that you could bless families Lord with the honor and the privilege of being able to serve you in each generation so we pray tonight Lord your open the word to us we've taken the time lord the beginning of the service to express our heart to you in worship Lord we heard the people expressing their hearts through singing and through their hands and lifting up holy hands and we pray that you it would be a sweet smelling Savor to you tonight we pray it would go up to you Lord that that is perfected praise in your ears and your heart Lord and father you just come back now and speak those things that are solid those foundations those stones of Revelation those rocks Lord that we build our life upon I just pray Lord that you come forth and do that Lord and just meet every need that's in the house tonight those who are listening on the internet we just pray that you'll break through every barrier and Lord that you'll be able to bring freedom to our hearts through the word of God we just commit it wholly to you now we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord you may be seated tonight God bless each one for coming out certainly had a wonderful service Sunday and a wonderful spirit here we appreciate the the uh reception that the freedom that we felt in the service and it's good to have our visitors here tonight as well Wednesday night the townsin and all the visitors coming in for retreat and uh just God bless you all uh the gray family it's nice to have you we're looking for I seen your names on the I knew you were coming but I seen your names on the registration last night as we were working on the retreat stuff and so just good to have you all here praise the Lord are you glad to be in the house of the Lord amen you want to be a blessed family well the word of God says that you can be a family that's blessed and that blessing is passed down from our Father Abraham because of his obedience because of his faith because of the Revelation that he held because of holding steud to that then not only is it say that what he said I will bless them that bless the curse them that curseth thee and that is because not not because Abraham is a a a uh different person himself in the sense of his own personality but God chose Abraham and he made a a covenant with Abraham and that gave the distinction that he would be blessed and those that cursed him got cursed those that blessed him were blessed but this is the one I was looking at is that all the families of the Earth being blessed through this and that's quite a powerful trickle down effect from a man of Faith there is a trickle down effect from a man of faith and I want to apply this to our families because if we have a family of faith and we have a man of Faith uh leading the family even sometimes when we don't have that cuz there are many situations today where we don't have that man of Faith leading the family nonetheless the blessing can still come on a family if they're a family of faith if they're a family that holds the sword and we'll get to that towards the end of the service tonight Lord willing and that is you got to have you you may have the word but it takes a strong hand of Faith to take the word to the heart of the enemy and you can have all the message tapes and all the books and you can know about brother brand know all the stories you can have your Bible you can read it all the time but it takes something more than just the word it takes Faith with the word and Faith steps out and believes the word can you say amen and somebody in that family if not the best thing all of that family needs to have the same faith of Abraham to step out upon the word and uh bring things to the heart of the enemy because the enemy what he tries to do is is he tries to cover up God's promises to you and keep you from God's promises and His blessings for your family and all kinds of things of the world try to creep in and unbelief Creeps in and all these and that'll never stop until the Rapture but a blessed family that has a man of Faith or people of faith can take the sword of the word take it to the heart of the enemy and as brother Bram says that he says he says you just cut back until you can get to the promise of God we have to cut sometimes we have to use the hand of Faith to with the word of God to be able to get through and cut through what the enemy is trying to destroy and as I said last Wednesday night this is a good thing to talk about because Satan wants to bring a curse on families right Satan is out to curse families God is out to bless families Satan is out to divide families God is out to bring Oneness in families and uh we need to be on our toes all the time as Believers to realize his attack so much towards the families and uh we just are praising the Lord that he's bringing us back around to talk about this just to kind of go back over a little bit we realize that Abraham uh here in his Blessing God wanted to bless the families and uh he mentions it doesn't it doesn't mention your job as we said last Wednesday night doesn't mention a blessed business or a blessed job but he said families here and that's because in the mystery of God we find that God in the beginning had his desire to have a family on Earth of his own the original desire and the the Capstone of God as it were or the or or or the ultimate achievement of God was to fill his loneliness to make a family a family of sons and daughters of God for himself so that's why God doesn't see much in blessing a business he may bless your business or blessing a job or blessing some worldly thing what God really wants to bless is families what God had in his mind in a mystery before the foundation of the world was to express himself first and that he and man could become one and that he could have fellowship with his sons and daughters he could have preeminence in a family to express his character in a family and so in the very beginning that is the mystery of God is God created a family we're going to read from that tonight and go back to the beginnings because that's where we learn God's heart is to see what he began this for so in God's loneliness he wanted a family and we find that when God brings a family that's what God uh that's what God wanted to bring the beginning and that's what God wants to bless now is the families even in the last days here in Satan's Eden the thing that he want because if you have blessed families and and strong families you have strong churches right if you have families that are one with God and one with one another you can have Oneness in the church but when Satan breaks up the marriages and breaks up the families and breaks Divi brings division there then it's a trickle down effect to the church as well and uh that that that has happened and we see that uh many times happening and we have to really get aggressive with the Enemy that's in this day that's trying to destroy Oneness can you say Amen so so now that is God's crowning achievement when he created male and female and and his IM man and His Image in the beginning when he had him there in Genesis 1 they weren't even separated yet as far as in body but they were one in spirit both male and female that was God's crowning achievement that's why he rested the seventh day because he couldn't go on creating he couldn't cap that that was his top Capstone it was his crowning achievement is to have the potential there for family God God's crowning achievement was that marriage and that family that he was making for himself and for his son on earth when he says now I'm going to give you Dominion but it wasn't just the Dominion he says I want you to be fruitful and multiply God was wanting to create more children of his own God was wanting to fellowship with more of the children that was in his in his mind before the foundation of the world and so now you can ra imagine why God rested the seventh day his true peace his true Sabbath was this after to this crowning achievement this beautiful creation all that God did and yet he ended all ended it all with creating someone in His image a being in His image that had the potential for a family coming into Oneness and that just moved the heart of God I really believe it did it moved God's heart and until he said when he was finished with all he says it's good it's good of course then when he he formed Adam Out of the Dust and then he then he took a rib and made the wife then we realize after that that then uh Adam is there and the reason he made the wife is because after all this was good good good good then he says he looked at Adam says it's not good because he's alone he doesn't have a helpmate he doesn't have fellowship and he could relate to that because he was alone with his attributes he was alone by himself he wanted to fellowship with his attributes and so God in his multiplication in his multiplying he was creating a whole earth that he could put man on and bring his sons to and daughters into manifestation so that he could fellowship with them and so when all the creation had a counterpart but Adam God said this is not go good notice Adam he could create he had the power to create he had the power to he name in The Animals he had dominion over the entire Earth he had everything and yet God said it's not good now Believers through faith and the authority of the word have power to do do things can you say Amen but let's always remember what God's achievement is Faith can do a lot of things faith can create faith can lay hands on the sick and they shall recover faith can cause you to step out on God's promises for many things can you say amen and Adam was standing there with that power to create and yet God said it's still not good showing us that family and relationship and God bringing two that could Fellowship together was more important even the power to create somebody say praise the Lord that's good God showing because Adam had all of that he stood there with all the power and yet said when I look at you Adam it's still not good the crowning achievement is that there would be a fellowship and a Oneness expressed in fellowship with a husband and wife and a family can you say amen God was Desiring that himself and so now with all that power it still wasn't good until God created someone as a helpmate with him that he could have fellowship with he could have relationship with always remember that that you can achieve a lot of things in life you young people remember you can achieve a lot of things in life but always remember you serve a god that relationship is more important than anything else you can have all the money of the world and all the possessions of the world but if you don't have good relationships you don't have anything especially with God when the relationships are broken because of money when relationships are broken because overworking yourself to get money when relationships are broken because you're in debt up to your ear loads God is not pleased because God to God everything is about relationships and anything that breaks relationship the whole kingdom is destroyed because the relationship's not there can you say amen and so now just refreshing your mind from last Wednesday night that was a summary um that didn't cost you anything that was free that was just some summary if you weren't here just to bring you into the channel That We're In to realize how important this is how many wants to be a blessed family amen so now you know it's been a little while since we did a little series on the family I don't know how long this will go but it's been quite a while since we talked about the family and you know but even though I haven't talked about it it's been the greatest dominant thing as a Christian as a father it's been the the the dominant thing in my mind the last few years uh many years now I've been pondering these things and I think I've backed off a little bit from preaching on it a lot because uh I have wanted to just learn uh by working on it and implying things rather than preaching on it a lot um I wanted to be a little bit humble like that because you can talk a lot about it and then all of a sudden but you're not really living it and you're not really applying the things that's in the word and I just wanted to learn I wanted to observe and I I've been right in the thick of it I've been right in the trenes of raising teenagers man and uh when you're when you're when you're first married you think you're going to um you you got that Pride that you're going to you have the perfect kids and you think you've got the you know you were raised in a good family so and and I was thank the Lord so I thought well it's going to be real easy here and so this is going to be easy to do and so you start speaking yeah you do this and you do that and you do this and you do that well it's a big humbling thing you eat a lot of Humble Pie because some of those kids may not just conform the way you want them to conform I'm not going to mention any names tonight but I'll tell you it gets to be a a difficult thing but you see now maybe that's why I backed off a little bit is because rather than preaching on it I I just wanted to think through things and and I think like many things that we look at you you think you know so much and oh I got this this will be good I'll have a good family because I had a good family and it'll be easy now but once you're into it you realize it's a challenge to raise a Godly family in the last days didn't hear many amens on that but nevertheless it's the truth it's a challenge to raise a Godly family in this age all right let me say it this way it's a challenge to raise a normal family in the age we live in all right got a little bit more out of that it's a challenge just to have a normal family with normal relationships because there's so many guns trained on us there's so many things that divide the family there's so much uh spirits that come up in the family that try to divide us and uh we just want to come out the other side of our families and raising our children uh balanced uh and and normal kids and balanced kids and most of all filled with the Holy Ghost I can't think of a greater desire than to see my children walk in truth because of the Holy Ghost that is my desire and it's been a dominant thing in my mind to be able to see my children it wouldn't do any good to preach for 30 years over this pulpit and not see your children see the reality of it that they embrace the same thing that is I take no joy in that whatsoever because friends our children are credentials we can talk a lot about the word but how we live the word in front of them it there's it's it's more what's caught than what's taught right right and I want to be so in love with Jesus Christ that my children see that it's a love affair and not a duty as such that they are crave crave this same joyful experience it's not an easy experience but it's a joyful experience and there is no other life to live there is no Greater Life to Live I want my children to be able to fall in love with Jesus that way amen amen that's my desire and that's why it's been such a a thing that I've so prayed about and and looked over and and once you start getting humble and you realize you don't know it all then you start giving less advice and just start shutting up and start praying more and taking it one day at a time how many can you say Amen to that amen yeah you humble yourself a little bit I know some people uh still go around and think that they uh are in their pride feel that the way the way they're raising their kids or raising them is the best way and it's above everybody else and like the Bible says every man is right in his own eyes uh we still sometimes have that and families that feel that way but I I think we should be confident in what we're doing but not proud in what we're doing I think we should be confident parents that we lead them in the things of the Lord but not proud and ready to repent when we do wrong you know w r o n g wrong when you're wrong admit you're wrong can you say amen amen that's one of the greatest things I think as a characteristic of my dad that I can say besides the fact I knew that he sat and read read the Bible to us and the devotions and things he times he spent with us in the evenings and taking the prayer requests and such but there was another thing about him that when he made a mistake he repented of it openly in front of us he owned up to what he did wrong he didn't make a lot of mistakes but when he did it he did it in front of us and he owned up to it and that spoke volumes to me of a man that can humble himself and say I may not get it right every day but I know the goal that I'm shooting for is to raise a family with the token applied to the home and to see my children filled with the Holy Ghost that's the ultimate goal remember Sunday I was preaching on the destiny God looks at the destiny God doesn't look at the current problem or mistake you made God's looking at your destiny amen and when when God corrects you he's even looking at your destiny and when we as parents correct we should be looking at more than the the thing that they've done wrong but look at the destiny where we want to lead them towards can you say Amen praise the Lord so now we don't have it all figured out can you say Amen we don't know all the answers we we have to make adjustments and I think that's one of the uh the big things is to be able to be humble not proud and stay flexible and make adjustments when I say make changes and adjustments I don't mean to compromise on standards I don't believe in doing that but to just I feel like I've told people I feel like the last few years I've had to make adjustments uh the goal is to lead them and and to live in front of them God's kingdom ways that's what I want to do and to and to have their hearts and their trust is what I need to be able to lead them right because you can be leading them but you don't have their hearts and you don't have their trust so my first goal is to have their hearts to have their trust so that when I go to lead them they have some trust in me they have they they have trust me to lead them and you have to live a life and that's where you make the adjustment sometimes you make adjustments to keep their hearts and to have their hearts because you can go right along teaching teaching teaching this is what you need to do this is what you need to do and all the while you're losing their heart can you say amen yeah and having your their hearts to follow you is more important than just drilling principles into them and that wasn't as important as when they were little kids I didn't recognize that but I'll tell you when they start to get older having their hearts and having their attention and connecting with them is so extremely important to me and that's that's a challenge I feel like I make adjustments every day sometimes not compromises but adjustments because why I don't want to go in get to a place that our hearts are no longer on the same page you understand everybody understand that so you know it's more what's caught than uh than what is taught it's more powerful than what is taught whatever is taught must be backed up and here's another thing I've learned whatever is taught must be backed up with images that they're looking at whatever you're teaching whatever you're preaching they have to see images of what you're preaching at the church in the atmosphere you live in in the home now this world they not going to see images but there has to be enough places in atmosphere that they see images of what's being preached Sons and Daughters of God that are moving in that direction of what's being preached because I've learned learn images can be more powerful to young people than what is taught they'll tend to follow the images over what's being taught sometimes but if they have enough images and atmosphere and that's why brother says brother somebody asked brother Bram what should I do with my young teens what things should I allow them to participate in he said get them around good Christian Fellowship as often as you can if they're going to choose a boyfriend get them around some good boys if they're going to choose a girlfriend get them around some good girls and keep them in the atmosph spere so that they can see good images can you say amen and choose out of those images Right image is more important even than what's taught yeah oh I have another sermon on that but I'll tell you you could say so much about how powerful imag is not just to your teenagers but to you a lot of us are functioning by the images that we look at and the images that we get images from what we read we get images from what we see we get images of the people that are around us a mindset a thought set in other words a a mentality an approach to life that's an image that's an image too and so we take that and if we're not careful we'll buy into the wrong image and we're start to living start living something out because we bow at the images God has made us as a human being everybody with me here tonight amen God has designed our bodies that we are they were we're designed to worship we're designed to worship and because of that that's why man falls so quickly to Idols cuz we're made that way uh and animals aren't made that way humans are made that way and so we're so susceptible to Idols that's why in the Old Testament Israel fell to idols and a lot of those idols and the idol worship that went with it was more fleshly and sensual than the worship of Jehovah God that's why it became more appealing to the children of Israel to worship idols they were built to worship God made them that way but yet they leaned towards a more sensual fleshly thing to follow because it was just more fun right right but we're go you can't get around the way God built you but you have to pick and choose the right images to follow because whatever image we're looking at is what we're changed into that's and doesn't the bible say that about looking into the face of Christ as that we as we continually behold the face of Christ we are changed into that same image images have the most powerful effect on human beings what we're looking at what we read what we feed on forms the images of our thinking and that forms us into who we are and so when you're raising children that it's not just them you teaching the right things which you have a mandate from the scripture in Deuteronomy is that talk about these things when you get up talk about these things when you go to bed put them on the doorpost of your house put them everywhere talk about the word just it doesn't have to be a a long uh uh uh exhortation on the Seven Seals on Monday morning before they go to school please don't do that but it's talking about what God's doing in your life it's talking about what God taught you and then teach that to them what you've seen in the word teach it to them read the word with them it's not complicated but we as parents have a mandate to teach the word to our children and if you feel like you've waited too long to do that you still have a chance start teaching it to them now praise the Lord so we have a mandate to do that but I'm here to tell you teaching is not enough in this age because there's so many images of other things there's even images of Christians today and I'm not going to dechristianize them but there's Christians out there that are lovely people I know some of them I'm friends with some of them even in this area I'm very good friends with people I would never dechristianize their life but yet you have sometimes the definition of a Christian of a person that lives a a quite a worldly life in comparison to what the Bible Way is right right and that image of a person saying I'm a Christian can have an effect on a young person sometimes because they see that now wait a minute we're Christians and they're Christians what's wrong here Dad you see you know what that is that's image right right that's image and if they're not careful it'll Trump everything in the scripture and say I'm going with the image I want to go be a Christian like that they're allowed to wear pants they're allowed to do those things because they don't honor certain parts of the scripture so they're allowed to do all these other things and still be a Christian I can do that like the woman that who had those real high-held shoes on in the in the dream brother brah said and you know what she said to him I'm going to prove to you I can make it up that Holy Highway to Heaven with these heels on I can still be a Christian and have these heels on and she started to walk up and then she didn't go up she actually fell off the road and fell in another Direction but don't is her attitude I can still be a Christian and have these high heels and that's the attitude I'm laughing because I better uh I better keep going here because I'm getting myself in trouble but it's the truth nonetheless that's the attitude many times I can be a Christian and still do this you better check that through the filter of God's word you can't bring caked on makeup through the filter of God's word you can't ring real high spiked high heel shoes through the filter of God's word it won't come through there it may become come through your filter but not through the filter of the word so we can't have the attitude of that image that says they can still do this not when it's in a direct contradiction to the word no matter how good it looks but sometimes in our weakness we'll choose an image and turn down parts of the word because image can be more more powerful in our lives than what's said praise the Lord so you need to make sure that the images you're following are lined up with the word of God Amen and the images that you're putting before your children what you're letting them part participate in the atmospheres that you allow them to be around you're directing the atmospheres that they're around I'm directing my children until I'm uh they they are off on their own I have the authority as a dad and I have the the Mandate from God as a dad to direct who they're around what they're feeding on in my home what kind of music they're listening to I have to direct that in the right way but I've got to give direction to that because I know how the heart works I know how it can be distracted to the wrong thing I know how the flesh works trust me yeah because I'm flesh too right yes and sometimes in their young years they don't fully understand how powerful images are on their flesh so I have to be the Holy Ghost for them I have to help lead them so yeah I'm weighing in on who they stay overnight with I'm weighing in on uh they often ask about the kids at school there and all that and said I just say listen if I don't know the family and I I don't know what they stand for is that we're not going to have a big p pajama party with them you know say hi to them at school be friends with them all you want to but spending the night's another story ah Dad yeah you're so rough and all these other things all right but I'm the dad and I've got to walk watch over this thing and I don't feel one well I do feel bad sometimes but but I'm trying to look two years down the road and where it goes I'm trying to have a a a multigenerational vision for my kids I hope you're getting something out of this tonight I'm just sharing from my heart most of this but I I just want to uh realize and cause you to realize how important images are to them the images will have more an effect on them than what is said another thing is I watch other families I learned from that but maybe I've not said too much about it but the word has many good things to say about it in relation to the family and its families that he wanted to bless and to be a blessing on Abraham and his seed can you say amen that's the point is God wants to bless your family and God wants to bless the families of Abraham's seed a matter of fact he said all the families of the Earth Earth will be blessed that's a pretty powerful trickle down effect from Abraham's faith is that there's God's doing something so special in him it'll have an effect on the blessings of the families and I want my family to be blessed and so I shared with you is that maybe that's why I haven't said much because I want to learn but I want to take this little series on the family you just be praying with me we'll take it on some Wednesday nights here Lord willing in in January after the retreat hopefully the Lord will allow me to continue on and speak about it and some specifics uh about fathers and mothers and and children and all these other things and relationships and uh what to not do and what to do and you know what to say what to not say what breaks up uh uh breaks the brings Division and what doesn't bring Division and some specifics and I just pray that it will be a blessing to you in some way so we've been praying a little bit where do we start then if we're going to talk about the families where do we start and I was listening to Oneness last week the message that was preached called Oneness from 1962 and I was listening to that and God just LED my heart and said that's the place to start is Oneness because when he had his original family they had perfect Oneness and when he wants to create a family you you you really in reality you don't really have a family unless you'd address the subject of Oneness you don't have a family because you physically had kids right right a definition of family to God is Oneness right God wanted to have Oneness on Earth between people that live in the same house every day yeah in the same tent in the Old Testament in the same house every day around each other different personalities different natures and it's like this and then it gets harder and harder and and and so God wanted to take out of that family unit but he wanted the definition of a family he wanted to be in a reflection of Oneness and that should be our goal that's a great goal for our family if you want to write it down let's start there what's the goal for my family to make a million dollars no what's the goal for my family to go to Cedar Point every year no that's not it go to Cedar Point whatever you want to do what what is the what is the first thing that should be a goal we want to do this this year our family has goals we sit down and we talk about our goals I've got a family Covenant that I made years ago it's it's in the file there and it's a long-term family lifetime vision for my family with specifics on it where we want to go in natural things and spiritual things it's a covenant for my family and made all the kids sign it and all that and so but what is what's the beginning there's a lot of different goals you can have but what's the first goal for a family Oneness with God and Oneness with one another now you tell me is that a good place to start if we're going to talk about how to build the foundation of a good of a blessed family let's start there with a goal Oneness with God and Oneness with one another because that's what Co God really looks at as a real family you start on real Oneness if you don't have that you don't really have the family that God could bless you to be you might still be in the same house but there's no connection there's no Oneness it's the same as saying there is a true definition of a father and there's just a just the world's definition of a father and it's come down to a father is just somebody that was with someone sexually and the woman conceived seed and he had a son and daughter by that woman and so now he's technically called the father but that doesn't mean that he's a real father right God's definition is you go back to Abraham a father of many nations a father he says I know he'll said about about Moses I'll he'll command his house well that's the definition of a real father that He commands his house well that he has a multigenerational vision which Abraham had that he has these things that the reasons why he's teaching his kids so a father could be just someone who actually just has a child walks away never wants to see the child again let the woman keep him that's why a lot of women are dependent on the government there because there's so many fathers uh back when I was managing my properties most of my tenants were single women with lots of children sometimes by different fathers every one of them I couldn't believe it almost every one of them my tenants came in were in that situation and I don't know the reasons maybe they each child they get government help for each one I don't know but the father was not in the picture at all and if he ever was she was out doing all the work and he was at home with the video games right cuz I'd go collect my rent and that's where daddy was yeah oh he was supposed to be watching the kids right but he's there playing videos for hours and she's the one that's got a full-time job yeah that's how twisted we're we are right that's how twisted we are but he's not a real father he's just technically he had a child same with mothers can you say Amen there's a definition of a real nurturing mother that wants to be with those children that's a real calling of a mother The Fifth Gospel brother Braham says to make that connection with don't don't let anybody else make those connections with the kid that mother should make the connection with that kid but you see then you got mothers today that soon as as soon as they have it within a few weeks they want to drop it off at the daycare they want to give it and stay away from that child as much as they can the bare minimum with that kid or it's going to make me crazy and go I can't take it I need to go work and all these other things that's a detriment to the age we live in that's for sure it's a terrible thing but it's another definition of somebody that calls that a mother and I would never not call her a mom but I'm just saying that there's deeper there's deeper things to being a mother than just having a child so if that's true about fathers true about mothers then it's true about families you don't have a family just simply because you have kids running around the house we have a family because we're praying for Oneness in that family right Oneness in that family so you raise you raise them you you you nourish them and uh in the en of the Lord but when there's disconnections then we realize something's wrong in the family unit the longing to be connected in the heart is what is needed so that is what what is needed in a blessed family of God not just that you have kids in the same house not just you have a husband or wife uh but you have Oneness there is an anchor that you all agree on and now we're going to get into Oneness there's an anchor among yourself that you all agree on that's what brings Oneness there is a standard there is a there is not not only a standard but there's a spirit that dominates to make those standards lived in the home and everybody agrees with that standard now you're talking Oneness so let's get into it the message Oneness he says uh at the beginning here he says now this Oneness means to be one with it means to be United and now this is quite a subject this Oneness subject and it deserves a lot more attention than I'm able to give it and more than most any person on the earth could be able to give it I say it's pretty important he said it deserves more attention than him and more attention than I guess any person on the earth could ever give it so you imagine where I stand here tonight this subject of Oneness is uh uh extremely important if you've never taken the time to study Oneness in the Bible and study what it means I'd say by that comment we should make it a priority to say Lord help me to understand it better because it deserves a lot of attention it means he says to be one with and he says I will I I would like to express to you my opinion of it and with what God has given us now it's in this teaching do in this is a teaching Doctrine and to the Brethren who may hear this tape I trust that you will not take be uh an offense but but it will be to to cause you to take this very considerably under consideration rather that you would study it prayerfully carefully and weigh it out in the back balance of God's word to see whether it's of God or not that's the prophet encouraging you to take what he preaches and study it prayerfully carefully and weigh it out in the balance of God's word so any kind of voices that saying that we're just supposed to just take this and just accept it no here's the prophet saying take an important message like this get your Bible and prayerfully study it carefully weigh it out with the balance of God's word can you say amen amen it's good advice for I believe that that's the way we should always do weigh things with the word because the word is the only thing that will be able to remain that's God's program he goes on to say later that's God's program listen friends this is God's program God has a program it's not of the world but he has a program and so as we study it and prayerfully look at these things we come back to God's way God's program God's B Bible Way God's path for our lives God's PA God's answers to things they're written in the word of God you will be surprised how many answers you think that there's not answers to if you stay prayerfully there's answers in the word about it that's right God's not going to leave his people hanging at the last days that there's a bunch of questions we don't know answers to God's Not that kind of God he's not the author of confusion he gave his word for his people but people don't take the time many times to be prayerful about it and take time with it until God speaks the answer out of the word of God but the answers are there it's written in the word of God Amen praise the Lord so now here's the first thing he says about it first man the first man and woman in the Garden of Eden was in perfect harmony with God so much that God could come down at any time he desired and talk lip to ear with Adam and Eve now that is perfect Oneness God and His creation God speaking lip to ear with Adam and Eve and they were so perfect in harmony with God till they were one with God God and his family was one that's the first thing he says and the first word he mentions is harmony Harmony's not here tonight is she Harmony what is harmony that's the first thing he says about Oneness is that God and his his son and daughter were in perfect harmony with one another and they were in perfect Oneness with one another so much so God could come down in the cool of the day and fellowship with them and there was no walls there was no hindrances there was no sin there was nothing there that made God back off from fellowship with them which probably which would have been sin right would have been condemnation would have been a lot of things that would it nothing there to cause that he couldn't have complete openness with them and there was nothing there in their hearts to make them afraid of God or that they couldn't be open with God there were no walls there was nothing between them there was no things to resolve it had all been resolved right well there wasn't anything to resolve yet can you say Amen what a perfect harmony all the walls were down the intimacy was there the closeness the Oneness was there that's what true intimacy is the world often misinterprets that but the true meaning to intimacy is Oneness and closeness where there a relationship without any walls without any I wonder oh without any guilt I wonder what he's thinking what he's thinking there was never any of that God came down he felt comfortable and brother Brandon describes it two or three different places you know uh he just at night is he kissed them good night he laid his hand on them is there any needs that you have and that the Lions would gather around and the Tigers and he just lay their head brother BR says on the on the tiger there let them use the tiger or the lion for a pillow and you know and and so brother Bram describes he just came down and spoke to them they could hear his voice uh rustling there in the in the bushes and the voice of the Lord came and communed with them and brother Bram says here it was perfect harmony with God so much God could come down at any time he desired Li to talk lip to ear with Adam and Eve now that is perfect Oneness God in his creation God speaking and so they were in this Oneness because of their Harmony Harmony means a pleasing Arrangement or combination of things we would first think of notes all right when you're playing notes should have Roger do this but you know if if you have a song uh you have the melody to the song but the harmony is what Co what colors it that's the melody of the song All You music people know that some of you people that are non-music people didn't know that and I just gave you a piano lesson music lesson but then Harmony go Harmony aligns itself with the melody okay and and you'll be able to tell and I can tell you that non-music people can tell if something's in harmony or not they may not be able to sing harmony my dad can't sing harmony I I don't know why he just he just we when we were kids we just say he'd try it we say dad you know just leave it alone you know stick to the Melody I think I can sing bass here I think I do no it just you know I think one time he got it on and that was it but that's the melody by itself it's not very colored it's nice matter of fact the the people in Lutheran's Day from the Catholic Church on that's when they one thing they kept probably Roger knows this and Isaac is that and Sharon as well is that they they felt Harmony was of the devil and so they could only play The Melody that's why you have the the chants and all those things going on it's just the melody was sung because they felt Harmony was worldly well Harmony is not worldly Harmony comes from God and so we then soon as you take that simple Melody and you start to color it notice now all but all there's a lot of keys on this but the the harmony has to be lined up with the melody the melody is the absolute in order for there to be Harmony it has to to line itself up with the melody now see some of you non-m music people knew I got off track besides my face turning the way it did but but it's it it just becomes more colored it just becomes but I could play that same song and get off like I did several times and it would become irritating to you and even non-music people could tell I don't know what's wrong but something's wrong right if somebody doesn't play something right you see somebody mess up on a special or something they don't know how to play the song and so they're hitting all kinds of chords that don't match the song at all usually most people can tell there's something wrong they don't know what's wrong but something is wrong and the meaning to this harmony thing is is an arrangement and a combination of things notes and music a pleasing in arrangement in other words it's pleasing to the years it's pleasing because it's arranged right so now we find there's there's Harmony has some other meanings here of course Harmony is in in agreement it complements the melody if not it clashes all right so if har if if the notes are not in harmony then they clash with the melody and that's where you have clashes and so now here's another mean an orderly an orderly or Harmony means an an orderly or pleasing combination of elements in a whole color Harmony and that here the the order and Harmony of the universe that's an example it also it means a relationship Harmony means a relationship in which various components exist together without destroying one another various components uh I want to read that again that's good it's uh a relationship in which various components exist together without destroying one another examples different kinds of fish living in harmony number three it means a relationship characterized by a lack of conflict or by agreement as of opinion or interest and that's family Harmony a f a relationship characterized by a lack of conflict or by agreement and it's going to be the same word brother Brown uses here in a minute that word agreement there's a lack of conflict there's an agreement as a point of interest that in their terms is family har Harmony so he came down in the cool of the day there was Fellowship there was no walls God felt comfortable and so and and all they felt comfortable and thus you had harmony with God you had Oneness Oneness with God is't that wonderful praise the Lord so that's the first thing he says there was perfect Oneness because there was Harmony between God and man in the Garden of Eden we should desire that we should desire to have that uh Harmony where it lines up with the melody notice there has to be a Melody there has to be an absolute there has to be something to agree with right because you got all these different fish you got all these different opinions so there has in order to be Oneness there has to be something to agree with and everybody comes in agreement with that and then you start to have the harmony for a Godly family his next comment he says is any man and his family I feel like I'm getting late here am I all right quarter after eight all right any man in his family a correct good Noble obedient family is one with one another any family and if there's something in that family that moves them apart then it's not right the family is broken somewhere they should all be one father with Mother Mother with father children with parent parent with children all in agreement and when you see that you'll see one lovely picture that's God's purpose so he's he's laying down what Oneness is true Oneness between God and man but you can't hardly talk about Oneness between God and man without talking about the Oneness of a family right a Oneness of father and mother a Oneness with children with the father children with the mother you have to talk about and so I'm glad he gave a whole paragraph to say a correct good Noble obedient family is one with one another and uh notice he says you I don't think you can use I don't think you can teach this of a good family without using the word obedient and he uses the term good Noble obedient family obedience has to be a part of it but I ask you obedience to what obedience to what all have to be all have to have something to be obedient to to have a solid family and I'm including the dad any dads who are thinking yeah that's right if they'd all just agree with me and be obedient to me that's how the family works that's not what he's saying right he's saying the whole family has to OB be obedient to something right and you can't have a family of Oneness without obedience don't you ever try to have a family that just goes and build on the foundation of rebellion and teach your children that you question all authority and you question your employer you question all decisions that were made you're going to have a rough life and your children are going to have a rough life he's saying that this is a correct Noble obedient family they have learned not by mental but by Spirit to be obedient to something right can't have a you cannot have a correct family unless you teach obedience unless you live obedience unless the daddy lives obedience can you say Amen it's it's obedience so none of it can be without obedience Disobedience from Daddy down will break Oneness Disobedience from Daddy all the way down will break the Oneness you can have an obedient family and a daddy who's disobedient to what to what he's just disobedient that's his manner you'll never have Oneness in that family all the kids and all the wife is in obedience but the daddy's not obedient OB to God the daddy's not obedient to Authority daddy does what he want that family will break up can't have true Oneness without that you can't have it without obedience so it's and it's we'll use another word submission to be submissive in spirit you have to have a submissive spirit in everybody for a family to work if family is taught to question and buck the system the Oneness will break and you can't uh teach children to Buck the system and expect them to obey you just doesn't work that way you can't run against the authority of God's word or the authorities God's placed in in in place and expect your children to follow that image because you got to have an image of disobedience in daddy can't have it something will have to break something will have to split up because you can't have that image and then he demands obedience from the family it doesn't work that way how many men sometimes Brothers have I had to tell that you can't demand obedience for you can't demand obedience from your family God doesn't demand it from you it's the spirit of obedience that starts with Daddy first and then you will see your family learn and catch the image of obedience it's the way it works and so a submissive family if a family is taught to question about the system it'll break Oneness we still ask what is it that they are first obedient to not just to one another it has to be by Spirit it has to be a reverence that family has to have a reverence everyone from Daddy down has to have a reverence for another being that's around or another Spirit they're accountable to besides their own spirits that whole family has to have a reverence of God that there's another being around there's another spirit that is welcome in the home that they are all obedient to can you say amen amen they have to be all obedient to something one thing can you say amen and so if that's not there you can't have Oneness and so it's not just obedience to one another it has to be by the spirit it has to be a reverence for and an accountability to uh something greater than themselves that's there Christ and I'll call it what it is Christ and his word because we establish our families upon the word but it's not just the written word it's the spirit with the word it's the spirit that wrote the word Christ is the spirit that wrote the word Christ is the presence we need in our lives Christ is the presence we need in our homes right Christ should be the dominant president that leads he should be the Shepherd that leads our homes amen and that's the reverent spirit that we offer to that that submissive Spirit to that submissive Spirit to his holy spirit that begins to form that obedience that begins to form the Oneness that we're talking about in the Garden of Eden praise the Lord so I got to move on here so submit yourselves and and it does say in Ephesians 5 to submit yourself one to another how many knows it says that husbands wives the body of Christ submit yourselves one to another in the fear of God Amen so there is a submitting to one another but there is no way that that works in a church I guarantee to you unless those people are submissive to the Holy Ghost in their lives it's only you have submission to one another true submission to one another when you have people that are submissive to the Holy Ghost and have the Holy Ghost in their lives you have a lack of the Holy Ghost and a l lack of submission to it don't you ever try to micromanage people submitting to one another because they in their nature I ain't in my nature I ain't submitting to nobody and you ain't going to submit to nobody especially the person sitting next to me they're not going to tell me what to do that's why I asked the question and if First Corinthians 1 Paul said that we all there to be no divisions among us and that we all speak the same thing I brought it up to the brothers a few months ago heard a lot of good things from the brothers but I I tell you I I'll give you my answer to it there is no way that you can all be on the same page and all speak the same thing and I said to somebody a few weeks ago that is the goal of the Holy Ghost fi church that we eventually all speak the same thing seems impossible in the world we live in seems impossible with people feeding on the internet and the wisdom of the world so much on now and if you feed on that you're headed in the other direction of a goal of a Holy Ghost Church to all speak the same thing it's when we all speak the same thing and I'll tell you it comes by one thing and that's by the Holy Ghost God if that's the goal of the Holy Ghost and that's the goal of the church then the Holy Ghost will bring it to pass and if you still think it's impossible you just need to begin to believe it's possible not by human beings putting it together but by the Holy Ghost bringing people and people submitting to the Holy Ghost under the fear of God that they all speak the same thing amen it's our goal so now here's the next thing he says I didn't realize this would take so long tonight I'm going to have to finish this another Wednesday here I was hoping to be done with the Oneness part but he says here now a good obedient family so we covered obedience you need to write that down you need to remember that in your heart we're talking about Oneness being the goal of a family a blessed family and part of that Oneness number one is obedience obedience to some to to Christ and the word in the home that's an agreement can you say amen and so then he says and if there's something in the family that moves them apart no notice how General that is something that comes in the family that moves them apart now I could expand on that so many ways because you all have learned as Christians the something that little something or big something whatever influence it is you discover it's moving the family apart it could be an uncle it could be an aunt it could be that the husband has been influenced by the things of the world the husband becomes addicted to pornography and now all of a sudden something has moved to move the family apart and the family's going what's going on the wife's going on what's going wrong what's going wrong it's because something has moved in to tear the family apart and that's what brother Brown's saying and a lot of times the rest of the family has to feel the guilt about it if a wife messes up she commits adultery or something like that then the rest of the family has to feel the feel the guilty feel guilty about it but a lot of times it's Satan that's worked on that one person to break up the family right and the rest of the family has to feel guilt about it what a shame that's that that's how the devil works but you see now something moves in there it may not be an adultery it might be just an addiction to pornography it might be somebody started to ring the read the wrong books and those wrong books brought a wrong spirit in the home you don't tell it for two three weeks down the road but all of a sudden now you're dealing with spirits in the homes yeah he says something something moves in to move the family apart and see that's if he says it that way then that's if we're shooting for Oneness we all have to stay prayed up we have to stay in the spirit and stay prayed up teenagers and parents alike stay in tune with God to keep the Oneness going right because all of us are susceptible to let something come into us that would break up the family if something in the family moves them apart then it's not right and that family's broken somewhere at some level the family unit and Oneness becomes broken it may be at a very very light level and you can't even recognize it but you better pray because the smallest little things these days it seems like has the agenda to break up marriages to break up families to break children from their parents children are to be one with their parents parents are to be one with their children right and anything something that comes into your life young person that breaks the Oneness I told one young girl that that was getting ready to get married I said she was kind of not as close to her mom during the last few months of the marriage and I said do you really want that I said and I I gave it to her straight I said listen how can you really come into was Oneness with your husband when you're going to leave a household when you weren't in Oneness with your parents some situations you're not able to be fully one because they're not Believers but in this it wasn't the case is that how are you going to go in to Oneness with your husband perfectly when you're not one with your mom when there's walls up between you and your mom deal with that first and take care this is your this is the best time to deal with it get as close to your mom as you can yeah because that's practice for getting close to this guy people think if I can just get away if I can just get out of this house I can just get married get married get married I'll be one with my husband and all my troubles will be all over my problem is my parents and if I can get out of the house it'll solve all the problems not if you've got a problem with obedience right and Oneness it's going to be bad oh not the first two years it'll be glorious the first two years but then all that that that's laying there dormant will come back up again and the image that you left on of your parents you'll transmit as being the image of how you look at your husband and you look at your wife because image is more powerful than what's taught you were in church all your life and knew the right way to be a wife and husband but if the image is wrong in your heart you're going to do the wrong thing so what do we do we do like Josiah said Lord let me stomp on the idols and images that are wrong in my life my life you know that's what Josiah did he went into the temple and destroyed all the false images and idols and stomped them to dust that's what Christians need to do Lord deliver me from all the false images in my mind and how I think about things that's wrong not going to get through this here tonight I'm looking for a place to end but we realize that there's something that comes in that breaks up the family somewhere something foreign to what is the standard comes in here's the standard but something foreign and sneaks its way in and that thing moves that family apart slowly but surely moves that thing I'm going to say to you as a pastor a few months ago or last year when we had some of these influences on the internet believe the sign and these different things coming on and playing into um the uh Factor here I'm going to say to you as a pastor the lord gave me instruction what to say that the CH to the church about it and what to do and how to handle it and how to keep yourself from the tents of those and those websites and that's what I gave as as uh the what God told me to tell this church on how to deal with it you of course have a choice that what what you want to do but I'm I'm here to tell you those things are more potent than what you realize right and I'm telling you if you give into those images it's starting to destroy families and Destroy marriages yes isn't that interesting something doctrinal something that that's just a a just a question could actually have that eventual effect we're starting to see that so I just encourage you that if God sends a a word through the local Ministry of how we handle it I encourage you to be obedient to it right right because that's that's no longer Paul of Fontaine that's the Lord trying to protect you from something that can destroy your marriages and Families amen didn't intend on saying that but I just wanted to encourage you in that because we're we're Ser we're anything anything foreign that comes in that doesn't end up being the word of God that's why I emphasize and brother B says he says take what I'm preaching to you take what I'm preaching and sit down and prayerfully and consider it with the Bible and prayerfully consider these things and see if it balances out with the word of God he's challenging you to do that because why in this day we better make sure it's word based we better make sure that it doesn't come from the mind of some someone that's not word-based and something that's not shooting from from that source that is for sure so we must be in agreement with it and that's the key we would think that we'd all be in agreement with one another but the only way we can be in agreement with one another in a family it's not that our minds agree on everything but there's a spirit and there's a word that we follow in the family that we all agree with there's something greater than ourselves in this family unit daddy sets up the home as to what the absolute is as being God's word and we're all in agreement that there is an absolute that we follow God's word and if there's a question that comes up we're going to pray about it we're going to we're going to find the answer we're going to we're going to follow God's precepts in the closest way that we can and we're all going to be in agreement with that approach to life that's a family that can be blessed because it's not that we agree with another one another on every every point it's not getting the minds to agree with a certain person it's getting our minds to agree that there is an absolute and we all follow that absolutely right daddy included yeah because I want to get to the next section which I I'm going to close now but the next section says the only way that they should be that they could be one with the family or with God was because God's nature was in them talking about Adam and Eve the only way they could be one with the family or with God was God's nature was in them so that made them with God's nature in them then with each other and God they became one isn't that a beautiful picture God in the family father overall Supreme no death no sorrow no heartaches no nothing just joy unspeakable never to be sick never have a heartache just one with God what a picture because the very nature of God was in these people people and therefore what they did they followed just in line with God and God with them made them one so now you see how difficult it is with just trying to have a family with no Holy Ghost there no nature of God there trying to be one with a things of the word without the nature of the word without having the same nature he said the only way they could be one is to have the same nature of God in of God in them so you can struggle all you want to try to to do things to have a family and we will talk about some other elements of the family that get lost sometimes and that's laughing together being able to have a good time connecting emotionally all those things are are very important but if you had all of that you don't have a structured Solid Rock Family unit unless you have Oneness with God and Oneness comes because you're the same nature with God you have the same Holy Spirit living in you and you're praying for that same Holy Spirit in your children because we all agree that nature Made Them agree agree with him and agree with his word can you say Amen so he's saying it's it's almost it he's saying it's not possible to have it any other way it's not possible to have a people without his nature living in them and to be able to come in full Oneness as a family in agreement with what with God's word there's no way to properly do it unless we pray and say Lord put your nature within me that's a tough thing because we got our own nature that's right there too got our own personality but when the Holy Ghost comes in there's something stronger within you that agrees with the word of God when that young person gets the whole picture changes when that young person really gets the holy spirit in their life because even though they still got their own personality and even though sometimes they're still young and might be a little immature just a tad they've got the Holy Ghost and they live by that it'll be stronger and it'll agree with God's word and you'll have more Oneness that way than trying to do it mechanically through the head it takes his nature within us that's why we pray for our children to get the Holy Ghost that's why we pray that we receive the Holy Ghost right because that's the answer to True Oneness yes never can fully have it now as I've said in the past if somebody will respect the Holy Ghost and respect God's ways even if they disagreed with it there's a blessing sometimes that goes with that I've seen families blessed just because the daddy and momy mommy or the unbeliever respects the word enough an unbeliever in uh husband can live with an unbelieving a believing husband can live with an unbelieving wife the Bible says it can happen because of his respect or her respect for the word of God it can happen but there has to be respect best Oneness is to have that whole family no matter what they are if it's a single mom raising kids whatever it is if they can come one and and their nature can be one with God and they can come in line in harmony with God's word the melody if they can come in harmony with that that even their family without all the units there they can be one with God and one with one another I do believe that with all my heart let's Stand Together God bless you a lot of young people here and I pray that these young men and young women are listening because you're going to have a family someday probably sooner than you think you're going to get married you're going to have a family you ought to pray and say Lord let me have a family that's Oneness with one with God let me have have a family that's blessed of God not just another family but someone that really reflects what true Oneness is and how how many of us that have families you want to come in Oneness with God that way amen I want to reflect in my family we're certainly not perfect not the perfect family I can tell you that right away but I'll tell you we have a token we have the Holy Spirit through that we can be the family that God wants us to be and you can be the family that God wants you to be can you say Amen praise the lord we have a family song Raj I don't think we do we need to write one amen let's pray first and he'll think of something to sing there just humble our hearts just now just bow your heads and just speak to the Lord and often when we preach these things we think of the elements that are missing in our family where it could be better and so all all we can do is Lay those things before the Throne of God tonight say Lord I I lay them before you if I'm not being the person that's agreeable with your word and I'm being the problem Lord help me not to be the problem help me not to be a part of the problem help me to be a part of the solution help me to be so submissive to your spirit that I would give my
