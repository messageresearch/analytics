[Music] [Music] yes [Music] [Music] thank you what is important the ways [Music] thank you [Music] oh that's the story right now it's time [Music] Genesis Chapter 3 The Serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God hath made and he said unto the woman yea hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God hath said ye shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest ye die and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for God doth know that in that day ye thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as Gods knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of both of them were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sold fig leaves together and made themselves aprons and their heard the voice of the Lord God Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God Among the Trees of the garden so as as they have fallen from the word and believing the word eve has I want you to notice now what begins to unravel because Eve has fallen from the word she's taken Satan's interpretation of the word how many know that everything this whole world come under a curse everything unraveled when she left the word and so this is the transition and so they're hiding and now the voice comes in the garden and they never had to hide before never felt guilt before never had any of this happen but everything has lost now their their Glory their their holy Veil their Fellowship their Oneness everything unravels and they're hiding from God hiding from the presence of the Lord verse 9 said in the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him where art thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid he'd never been afraid before never been afraid of God I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself and he said who told me that thou was naked hast thou eaten of the tree where have I commanded that thou shouldest not eat and the man said now the normal answer would have been yes I Vader that tree look at his answer and the man said the woman whom thou gave us to be with me she gave me of the tree and I did eat and what should have been an honest answer and owning up to what he had done he passes the buck to his wife Fallen condition when you're blaming everybody else man said the woman thou gave us to me she gave me of the tree and I did eat and the Lord God said unto the woman what is this thou Hast done and her response was not normal either the woman said the serpent beguiled me and I did I would like to title this this morning relationships after the fall a few weeks ago we talked about relationships before the fall and now I'd like to begin to talk about relationships after the fall because relationships changed after the fall everything changed after the fall and in some ways we have lived out our lives dealing with relationships after the fall and after everything happened we've dealt with a lot of that in our lives until Christ comes in our lives and Redemption power begins to affect us and we realize when we get the Holy Spirit In Our Lives the Holy Ghost In Our Lives it begins to change everything and redeem us back to what we lost before the fall in the garden but all of us have lived with what it means to live with families and to live in situations and live in schools and go to schools and we've all lived with broken relationships we have all lived in families that have been broken it amazes me what family situations some of you have come from and as I hear it I just say that person is a miracle that they're even standing that's a miracle that the grace of God has them even have any desire for God it's a miracle that they know that their true fathers on the face of the Earth because of what their fathers did to them and I stand amazed and that's the Redemption power of God to show you it doesn't matter how broken the relationships are God through his holy spirit is out to restore relationships that have been broken the blood of Calvary is the Redemption to bring us back to what has been lost in the garden when God moves upon the people of God who are who are not in Oneness with God he sends a prophet and he does two things the first thing he has to do is separate the people from The False Oneness that they're in first thing he has to do is speak boldly through the prophets and say you're going to have to leave first thing he said to Abraham he says leave your Kindred leave the people that are around you and he separated them and why was he separated him from unbelief because he wanted to bring him to True Oneness you cannot come to True Oneness with God as an individual until you're willing to separate from the things that are a false Union if you're not willing to separate from friends in the world if you're not willing to take that step and trust me the Holy Spirit while he's wooing you back we'll speak to you about separating from all the things that are keeping you from God there must be a separation from wrong things for you to be properly in Union for with God so now even though true Oneness was brought after Calvary through the baptism of the Holy Ghost how many believe that's when true Oneness came back whatever was lost in the garden was restored on the day of Pentecost and that promise is unto you and your children as many of God should call throughout Generations this is how we would come back to a union like in the Garden of Eden is that he would fill his people with his spirit and he would come and live in the heart that's where we come back to Eden again that's the that's how Redemption takes place he went to Calvary poured out his Spirit on the people and now we come back into what we lost in the garden everything that was lost we now receive the power of redemption to begin to rise above the fall and come out of the fall but the thing is after Calvary and after the baptism of the Holy Ghost after 2 000 years then we needed Malachi 4 and this is great that I'm talking about Malachi 4 and Elijah because it says in the Bible this in case the young people don't know it says the last scriptures of the Old Testament Malachi the prophet prophesies and says in Malachi 4 he says verse 5 the last two scriptures of the Old Testament behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord that was not John the Baptist it was at the just before um Judgment Day and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse so now this is the prophecy of Elijah coming but I want you to notice now what he does all right this prophet first part of it is to turn the hearts of the fathers the Mosaic fathers that were in Israel during Jesus time to the children of Pentecost who would receive the Holy Ghost so that's one part of it but then he says that he'll turn the hearts now there's a second part he'll turn the hearts of the children back to the father so now after 2000 years they would they would have to be restored back to the Pentecostal fathers and the original thing of what happened the original Oneness that happened on the day of Pentecost in that time so we would here's the subject I want to make it as simple as possible that scripture shows us if we needed someone to tie our hearts back to the Pentecostal fathers in in the day of Pentecost that means we have become disconnected from the fathers if we weren't disconnected with that Holy Ghost Oneness and that original Pentecost if we weren't disconnected he'd never have to send a prophet because we'd be fine after 2000 years we've got the same Holy Ghost we're filled with it everything's good but everything isn't good because even after Calvary and even after the Holy Ghost fell on the ability to bring us back into Eden again after two thousand years of Creeds and dogmas and worldliness and laodicea and all this stuff we are not in Union with God anymore we lost it and the children are disconnected from the faith of the Pentecostal fathers so he said I'll send Elijah and I'm going to reconnect you back to True Oneness again I'm going to take the children the Christians the children of the generation and I'm going to speak something to reconnect him to the Pentecostal fathers and they're going to get the same Holy Ghost the same faith oh it ought to make us rejoice friends there's no hope without without what God sends us we are disconnected from the Pentecostal fathers we're disconnected from a true baptism of the Holy Spirit we're disconnected and by the way I'll let you know without that you don't have any overcoming power to live in laodicea but God said I'll restore you back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers so did you ever notice the wording the hearts of the children to the fathers when you talk about children and fathers that's a that's a relationship thing that's a that's a word picture you know he could have used anything there he could have said he shall turn the theologians back to the correct Doctrine Elijah shall come and turn all the theologians back to True Doctrine he didn't word it that way Elijah shall come in the end time and restore Christians of this generation back to the true Christians of the original he could have worded that though but look with the way he worded it he shall turn this is about relationship this is about Oneness this is about family when you talk about children fathers mothers dads Sons daughters it's about relationship he said I'll restore the faith of the children back to the faith of the fathers in other words I'll bring them back to the word back to the true baptism the Holy Ghost back to Bible Faith back to holy living back to relationship and back to living Holy by relationship I'll get to that in a minute Elijah will call us back to holy living but by relationship the children will be turned back he could have said turn back theologians to correct Doctrine and all these things but it's worded children and fathers and that puts an image in our minds that this is about relationship a disconnection from the children of today to our fathers in the Pentecost spiritually it's a spiritual connection first in other words the children were disconnected from the fathers everybody in our generation the children spiritually were disconnected from the Pentecostal fathers and Elijah is going to come and restore us back to the father and the Pentecostal fathers so a disconnection from the children of today to our fathers in Pentecost spiritually and it says did you catch it he shall turn their hearts back to the fathers not their heads not their intellect he shall turn their hearts I can't see anything else but a relationship in this it's relationship it's fathers it's children it's Sons it's daughters and it's hearts it's not about the mind it's not about the father just just providing for you but it's about the father coming into relationship with you the worst problem we have today is there's broken Fellowship between Mankind and the heavenly father there's no connection to the original faith of Oneness of God connection with God and the sons of men but the word brings us back to that relationship now because of that disconnect because of that disconnect spiritually people are not getting the true relationship of the Holy Ghost they're getting a religion and because of that because of that now you have another problem that to me is the second most problem in our world natural disconnections from fathers and children brother Rapp sent me one uh something last week and he also sent me something here of a film documentary that's just been recently done I haven't seen it yet but I do want to see it and it comes from it comes from the Kendrick brothers and I thank God for the Kendrick Brothers some Baptist men from brothers from from Georgia who have put so many films together with strong biblical themes they don't care about what people think they just say it and I I love the films because guess what there's like a very small percentage of movies to watch today there's a very small percentage that Christians can watch and it not affect the Holy Ghost that's in them I praise the Lord but the Kindred brothers did this and I'm anxious to watch it but brother Rapp said it's it's titled uh show show me the father and it's this whole subject that has people are begin to pin down what's the problems come from most problems come from in our generation disconnect fathers that don't know how to be fathers fathers who provide for their kids but they don't need there's no relationship with their children and that breakdown in relationship with fathers is actually the cause of so many problems I've said it before if you talk to most men on Death Row in the prisons you'll narrow it down most of them confess I hated my father I had no relationship with my father murderers rapists and you tie it back now you never justify that as being the problem if someone's murdered somebody but but you got to look at the core of where it come from it's a breakdown in fathers and children we got parents in this generation that's disengaged clocked out timed out of parenting and besides that besides that if they don't have the word to hold them and to instruct their sons and they're just functioning then they buy into everything's okay well yeah go do that go out and be with a girl at 14 years old go out with 17 years old go out with somebody and so and and we're taught that if you tell them they can't do that you're not allowed to tell them that you're too strict of a parent even in the message of saying you're too strict of a parent you're a legalist I am not a legalist if I tell my daughters you're not going out with that boy I don't know why I don't have more amens here I am not a legalist I'm in charge of my home and I have a right to tell them right and wrong this is a Timeless truth and if we'll live by it God says I'll bless your home I'll bless your marriage I'll bless your family I'll have a relationship with you somebody say Amen this morning Satan has devalued all this stuff and made it a religion but the message is not relented it's relationship with God God was saying I want a relationship with you and when you get that you will have a relationship with your children you won't be afraid of your children you won't be afraid to speak up you'll love them gently gently love them you won't be a dictator to them I don't believe in that but love is corrective if you love them you'll correct them love is corrective now not all correction is love but because not all correction is love it doesn't dump out the fact that love is corrective how many know that Eve left the word and because she left the word that's when the fellowship was broke with God so leaving the word is the thing that unraveled everything okay but I thought of it last night in the Garden of Eden it wasn't just the word it wasn't just that God spoke and said don't even don't eat of that tree they didn't have a Bible they just God spoke to them that you can eat of all the trees but stay away from that one don't eat of that or that day you eat that die and that's the only word they had from God but guess what it wasn't just the word that God spoke to him to live by and if you stay by this you'll have life you'll live but it wasn't just the word his presence who was the Tree of Life a person so even though he spoke the word his presence was there as a person coming down every day in the cool of the evening and fellowshipping with them Eden was not this thing of rules without relationship they had relationships and because they stayed with the word it kept that relationship intact when they left the word then the relationship was broken with God you see and so you know you have uh rules for a home I'm going to get into that you have rules for a home we try to base it upon we tried to base upon the message and different things so you got these rules but the rules as it says rules without relationship breeds Rebellion relationship without rules breeds rowdiness I've seen it parents want whole relationship I want to be a buddy to my teenager my friend to him but I can't tell them what's right and wrong I just want to be a buddy to them we'll see how that goes rules without relationship breeds Rebellion but relationship without rules brings rowdiness so Eden was not a place of rules without relationship they were fellowshipping with a with the Lord every day it's wonderful wasn't it there was a there was a person there it was the tree of life and they fellowship with the Lord they were with them it wasn't this this thing and in my home how would it be if I had rules to my home the the nice thing about the rules of my home is that it's not just the rules I've set for my home and you're going to abide by these if you're going to live here but I'm a person they can come and talk to me about the rules I think they can come and talk to me they can come and fellowship with me they can come and talk it out can you say Amen and and Adam and Eve the word that they were given to obey yes they obeyed it but it was a relationship it was beyond just the word it was the word brought relationship and so as I have rules to my whole whole sold household I'm a person as well and so I'm I'm a person who sets the rule but the person who sets the rules is present he's available can you see what I'm preaching if I preach the word to you I'm not preaching the word there's a person here Jesus Christ and the person who wrote the rules is present and wants a relationship with you but isn't it interesting when it all begins to unravel and they broke the word they broke the word and when they broke the word they hindered the relationship isn't it interesting that the person the Lord is still trying to find them so they broke the word they'd lost the word they lost the glory of God it's a mess can you say Amen but I can tell you when they're hiding in the bushes he the Lord come after them to try to find them this message this word is not just about the word and the Commandments and doing them this is about a person can you say amen and I don't care how far you try to leave the word if the person loves you he's going to come and find you Adam where are you who told you you was naked what's going on here I've said it many times but I think it was brother Ron Spencer has said it when when when when Lucifer drew a third part of the Stars God never went after him to try to bring him back but when one son when one son Falls he comes down and he's looking for that son trying to find a relationship again thank for watching our message today if you would like more information please contact us by visiting our website
