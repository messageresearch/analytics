Brethren unto the coming of the Lord behold the husbandman waited for the precious fruit of the Earth the husbandman is the farmer the farmer waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth and hath long patience for it until he reive the early and latter Reign be ye also patient establish your hearts for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh amen Matthew 13 and: 37 and he answered and said unto them he he that Seth The Good Seed is the son of man I'm going to read that again verse 37 and he answered and said unto them he that sth the good seed is the son of man I think it's an appropriate scripture and appropriate thing to apply to mothers and that is that he that Seth to the spirit because basically that's really what moms do is they're in the sewing years and they have the ability uh to so many many good things into the child can you say Amen she truly is that she's a swer mom and God must have trusted her uh to set her in life because he God set this up God created human beings he created the family and created how many years and all those things and then he set up mothers and fathers and so in his plan for some reason God set it up that the mom would have the child in its first formative years in other words mom would have the baby and the child first before anybody else I think God's mind was for that God was thinking and he must have trusted that if it was uh the right kind of mom that the best person that could be with that child in its most formable years is the mom right there close to them to the to embrace them to teach them to live something in front of them but also to speak to them and most words that are spoken uh the in the early years of our life are spoken by the mom and how many know that words have a powerful effect on us how many know that words are so powerful that you can remember something that was said about you even from your childhood you can remember what was said about you and those words can have still today a powerful effect upon your life how many would raise your hand and say my mother had a powerful effect upon my life and God set it up that way and it was mostly not just her actions but the word words that were because you see words are seeds words are something that you plant can you say amen and and so you could live the life in front of them but it's getting across something to that child to that baby and then they as they come in as toddlers mom is the one that's with him the most and and those words are seeds being sown and when seeds are sown then later you look and see what results come from the seeds that are sown because the law of harvest and the law of planting it it applies to everything in our lives and that is whatever is sown there's going to be a harvest from what's being sown you just don't get to see it till many years later but I can tell you whatever is sown there will be a harvest from that in our lives the principle works and especially with words that are spoken over us and moms do this uh uh uh in the early years of Our Lives those words from her lips will such great power over our lives and that spoken word from mom is kind of the uh Original Seed the spoken word is the Original Seed and those spoken words from mom is kind of the original seed for our lives on Earth can you say Amen building who we are your hair is so shiny and pretty today you have such nice handwriting of course my mom never said that about my handwriting you're brave to go out there and and and and play basketball I think you are kind I'm proud of you for trying harder in school I'm glad you're my daughter I'm glad you're my son I'm proud of you I love your dimples they're just so cute these is practical things that are words that are spoken but guess what she's the first one that says those things and hopefully she's a mom that doesn't always point out to all the flaws in US you have to do correction or you're not a good mom either you have to get a hold of that will or that will will get a hold of you so you have to kind of uh just break it a little bit but if all that is there without some words about the good can you say Amen then then it's going to be detrimental so this is the kind of I'm just giving simple examples of things that are said that can have a lifelong effect upon us and uh and mothers say that mothers say these things things and uh they give us things in those early years and we may not remember everything although some things you can remember we may not remember everything but there's something in us that gets embedded in US embedded in our minds and we can go back to something that was said over us personally now Mom can compliment other things mom can compliment dad mom can speak of other things that she enjoys but when she brings a direct a direct compliment to you and your personality and God made you and that you're fearfully and one and I love you the way that you are that's a direct personal thing to us and let me say friends if that has a much that much effect upon us a mother's word spoken to us how much does the word of God have power over us and what he says about us how much the more what he says is true and will have an effect on our spiritual life can you say Amen so having moms with their uh with their babies of course is the best thing and today we praise that and we praise a man who's able to keep her home uh that's where she should be is at home with the kids if you can if you can accomplish that so we we are thankful for that because that's best for the kid and it's such a powerful impact uh can I say if a mom can I say it again if a mom can have that by her words and life how much more can God's word affect us for our lives Jesus said my word that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are alive my word will have an effect on you the most powerful thing is when uh he speaks something over our lives the most powerful thing is when God speaks and he's spoken many things but when he speaks personally over our lives can you say Amen it's such a powerful thing everything changed in Abraham's life when God spoke his word for Abraham and guess what when God called Abraham and spoke to him it was a personal word for Abraham and it changed his complete life he was an idolator he had a certain identity and probably would have been an idolator the rest of his life until God came and spoke to him and said no you're you're not you're not an idolator L notice God saying a different identity you're not Idol because God's going to be speaking from the Lamb's Book of Life can I get an amen here this morning God will be speaking not from the identity you know but God will be speaking from the Lamb's Book of Life and he said to Abraham you're not an idolator I'm going to make you he said who are you he said well I'm baren my wife can't have a child I can't have a child I'm Abraham that's my that's my name that's my identity I'm Barren and I'm also an idolator and God says no I'm going to change your name from Abraham Abram to Abraham and no longer a Barren uh idolator but you're going to be guess what look at this I'll make a Barren person the father of many nations when God speaks over your life it changes everything Isaiah 558 for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways sayith the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for as the rain cometh and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but WTH the Earth and maketh it to bring forth and to Bud that it may give seed to the S and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth so he's talking about the sewing he's talking about the former and latter rain which by the way is throughout prophecies in scripture of our day a former and a latter rain coming together but how's he going to bring it by the words spoken from his mouth and guess what they are it's my thoughts it's my words it's what I think about you somebody say praise the Lord you can believe whatever you want about yourself but one day God's going to come and say this is what I think about you this is my thoughts and guess what my thoughts are higher than your thoughts there's something that trumps everything that the devil tells about you and that's what God's word says about you you go ahead and believe your whole life if you want you what the devil has told you what your your family has told you you go ahead and believe it but I'm you want to start believing because those thoughts are not as high as God's thoughts and he says I'll bring the rain I'll bring the former latter rain and he says it will begin to Bud something else so shall my word goth forth out of my mouth and by the way if you know your Bible what is the mouth of God how does he speak it does everybody know what the mouth of it it's a prophet the scripture says it the the mouthpiece of God is a prophet that's what he brings his word to seow the seed is through a prophet I want you to hold on to that because that's what we'll get to today so shall my word be go forth as a my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing where unto I sin it for ye shall go out you know what that's saying if it's my thought and I spoke it and it's planting the seed there is nothing there is no devil in hell there's nothing going to stop that from bu and coming forth for ye shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace the mountains and the hills shall Break Forth before you into singing and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands sounds like a Revival sounds like a pretty happy time sounds like a good thing what when God's thoughts are revealed to you about yourself and he plants that seed of his word and it shall not return void it will bring forth can you say Amen that that makes even the trees clap their hands that makes everything break into singing that's the thing that brings Joy that's the thing that brings peace nothing in this world will bring peace but what he said about you is a seed that's been sown now there's an element in when God speaks his word and I think it's with Mom too and I want to stress it just a little bit there comes a time when Mom has invested so many words and so many things and the father does as well but there is a comes a time when you have put all in and you invested so much teaching and training and you said this what they've done wrong what they've done right all these other things there actually comes a time when you you have to and it naturally happens you have to back off a little bit because they will eventually go I remember when Solomon just went here recently and I told him you know he needed to move out before at the first of the year I gave him a deadline he said you're kicking me out I said well you can word it that way that's not really what I said I think you need to go out and get used to things before you get married and the expenses and get you a place of your own I think you should do that before and not the day of the wedding that's just my advice to him and so uh I think he still views it as kicking him out but anyway the night before I went down and helped him pack and I started to get emotional so then I said okay I'm done with this and I went to bed and I stayed up till 3:00 in the morning and I'm late I'm over there in the bed just balling crying said to my I she said would you please go to sleep she said you wanted him to go and now you're crying I said I don't want him to go now I can't do this you know so she said get out of here and go down and tell him so I went downstairs I woke him up I just want you to know I love you and you don't have to go if you don't want to and and of course he's looking at me like I'm crazy you wanted this and I'm doing this but when it hits so it's mixed emotions but the day comes the day comes and so now and there's another natural thing that happens is that there's a certain backing off for several reasons of weighing in on all this glorious wisdom that you have for their life you think that you they're going to be welcome to hear that for the rest of their life uh but you know there's several reasons but there's a certain backing off to rest in what you've taught them what what you've invested in them and you've done enough and you've said enough and and you give that but there's a certain natural okay now let's see let's see how all this is done instead of because sometimes they're they say okay you know you you've said that already the last 20 years of my life all right so I don't need to hear it again that's not really what they have but it's just more okay I got it Dad you know okay so there's a certain um after the seeds been planted and after you've invested there's a certain amount of Separation that has to happen and then you kind of get to see and watch What the Lord Has Done in their life but watch what you've dispensed and done everything you could and there's some things that you there's no perfect parent did you know that if you are please come and tell me I'd like to get your manual there's only one perfect parent and that's God our Father he's the perfect parent but if I can take my image from him and and borrow from him and use what he used and learn from him then I can be a better parent but there is no perfect parent and so you look you step back and mothers kind of have to do that uh it's a bit scary but if she's in invested the right things into her children then you step back and you you invested the right things especially the word of God you ought to rest in that and say okay now let's see the Harvest that comes from it and guess what parents have a promise even how they lead their children if you'll set them in the right direction Direction and invest those things you moms have a promise step back because if it's the right things you have a promise they'll it it'll never depart from them can you say Amen they might try to depart from it but what seed has been sown it'll never depart from them a lot of parents have to go through that when there's a season oh Lord what have I done wrong what is going on in that girl's life what is going on in that guy life my son my daughter there are some parents that have to go through it but you know what you need to rest in you need to rest in the Lord but this husband he waits and the thing about the waiting is it's you know people act different to when they have to wait for something Americans are not very good waiters we get everything quick you know we got uh we got drive-throughs which they're not as quick as they used to be but we got drive-throughs we've got instant potatoes and we've got poof this and put that and microwave and bang right bang bang bang bang and it it it conditions us we want stuff right now I want that loan right now I want that new truck or that car right now and it it we're conditioned by America and then we come over to God and we say God I want it right now you probably shouldn't say that just pray with faith let God bring it when he wants to bring it even if it's 20 years later because you spoke it he it's before our high priest he acknowledges what you've spoken let him do the work but we get impatient we and even though the scripture says to be still and know God you forget that when you want a prayer answered right now we forget the scripture says they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength there's a renewing of your strength by waiting and being patient on God like Abraham and Sarah when Sarah said it's not happening it's not happening take Hagar have relations with her maybe that's what God man is Hagar nothing but a mess every time we get ahead of God we produce ishmael's in our lives when Jesus said in Matthew here the about the parable of the sewing when he says the son of man is the one who plants and sews the good seed and then the same Jesus you listening the same Jesus said so shall it be in the coming of the son of man as in the days of Sodom as in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man he would come you say well yeah he's going to come and meet us in the sky no no first of all what's he do he comes with The Good Seed he places it in the generation and now the bride just says Lord you I'm I'm having long patience for this because it's not my own righteousness it's not me trying to put something on I'm not going to try to make something work I'm going to enjoy worship and enjoy what you give me in the word because I know you're continuing to mold me into an adopted son and daughter of God I'm going to continue that but the final result and the climax to all this I cannot make this happen you've pled to the seed you're sending the former latter rain I don't want to touch it and produce an in Ismail I don't want to do anything to it and I'm certainly not bailing out does anybody see in the scripture where the farmer is saying I've waited long enough I'm out of here you can't find it in the elect in the end time the elect are saying he's planted the seed the son of man has come and done it in the end time and I'm staying until I see this good seed bring forth what God said it would bring forth I'm here to stay can you say Amen can't find that farmer running off cuz he know it's the good seed and he knows who's planted it he didn't plant it himself but it's good seed and it's going to bring this Harvest oh hasten that day Lord but he said the son of man so the son of man's going to repeat himself again if anybody doesn't understand the repeat process of scriptures you're not going to understand the Bible because you're what you're going to do say I believe everything here but I don't believe God can do it again in our day you don't understand the repeat process cuz what he did in the past he can repeat it again if he raised the dead in the past he can raise the dead this morning if he opened up blind eyes back then he can do it this morning something should be said about this impatience and this nervousness further because even John the Baptist himself who was the for Runner of the first coming of Christ once he spoke it once he said behold Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world and then he says when he proclaimed here he is then he said I must decrease he must increase the office of John with the spirit of Elijah was fulfilled at that day and he stepped back you could no longer just follow his office you had to follow Christ that's the transition and so he said Behold the Lamb of God but look what happened to John he gets in prison he gets depressed sends his disciples he's wondering is he the one got his eagle eyes filmed over what can happen during the delay Satan can bring you a bunch of doubts so we're not talking just see Jesus said there's not a man risen greater than John the Baptist and the greatest one of the greatest prophets to initiate this this Covenant with Christ to coming in one of the greatest prophets sat in the prison and doubted he had already said this is the Lamb so our human minds and the nervousness is it's not happening quick enough when's he going to set up his kingdom this is the Messiah this is the Lamb of God when's it all going to happen and it wasn't happening quick enough and he begin to wonder is this the one but he didn't have this principle I'm preaching to you this morning and that is that if you know who's planted the seed and you know you've spoken the word of God by saying behold this is the Lamb of God then you you you rest in the word of God why did God Rest the seventh day does anybody know because the other six days he had spoken the spoken word of God and spoke all things of existence even his own son creative power and on the seventh day after he created it all he stepped back and rested and what did he rest in he rested in his spoken word now that this is spoken there isn't any devil in hell that's going to stop it can I get an amen if God spoke it no devil in hell is going to stop it if God's got a hold of your wayward child there's nothing going to stop and there's no devil in hell that's going to keep them from coming back to God if God's got their number and they're predestinated seat of God they're going to come back no matter how long it takes if God's involved he doesn't say something in the oh I shouldn't have said that we do that sometimes we say I shouldn't have said that God God's never said I shouldn't have said God has never said I shouldn't have said that when he speaks it the first time it's done it'll go out it'll bring a crop and it will not return without a prospering can you say Amen a harvest everything he said it would happen it's going to come back just the same if the Lord comes tomorrow where is your heart right now are you saved have you received the Lord and for those who are going to rapture we know that it will be the ones that go in because the B Jesus said there'll be wise virgins and foolish virgins some who are left behind they're virgins they're very dedicated Christians but Jesus separated two crowds and said the one who have oil oil is the Holy Spirit the ones who go in the Rapture are the ones who have this holy spirit it's what Jesus said it's what Jesus said I didn't separate him he separated I tell you I ask you are you ready to go do you have the true Holy Spirit in your life and the identification of the response
