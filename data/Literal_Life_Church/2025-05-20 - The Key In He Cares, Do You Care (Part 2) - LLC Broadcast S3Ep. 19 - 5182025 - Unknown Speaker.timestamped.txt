[0:00] Hello everyone. Pastor Paula Fontaine

[0:26] [Music]
[0:28] with you now. And you never walked away.
[0:32] Been through a few trials and
[0:35] somehow I bent but did not break. You've
[0:39] never failed me and you never will. It's
[0:43] true. Might sound crazy, but I'll sing
[0:47] it still. I count it all joy when I run
[0:50] into trouble. I count it all good when
[0:52] the bad days come. Cuz I know that
[0:55] you're always working. And I know that
[0:57] you're still not done. So I'm going to
[0:59] lift your praise through the trial.
[1:02] Ain't no storm going to stop my voice.
[1:04] Cuz I live some life and I've learned
[1:07] that I can always count it all grace.
[1:10] Count it all
[1:15] joy. And I gave you my heart in
[1:18] pieces and it healed inside your hands.
[1:22] The more I learn I can trust you, Jesus.
[1:25] Oh, the more I understand. You never
[1:29] failed me and you never will. And you
[1:33] prove it on the daily. So I'll say it
[1:36] still. I count it all joy when I run
[1:39] into trouble. Count it all good when the
[1:41] bad days come. Cuz I know that you're
[1:44] always working. And I know that you're
[1:47] still not done. So I'm going to lift
[1:49] your praise through the trial. Ain't no
[1:51] storm going to stop my voice. Cuz I've
[1:54] lived some life and I've learned that I
[1:56] can always count it all grace. Count it
[1:59] all
[2:02] joy.
[2:04] Oh, I'm counting all my blessings. I'm
[2:08] naming them one by one. And that number
[2:11] keeps getting higher. And I've only just
[2:15] begun. I'm counting all my blessings.
[2:18] I'm naming them one by one. That number
[2:22] keeps getting higher. And I've only just
[2:25] begun. Count it all joy when I run into
[2:28] trouble. Count it all good when the bad
[2:30] days come. Cuz I know that you're always
[2:34] working. And I know that you're still
[2:36] not done. So I'm going to live your
[2:38] praise to the trial. Ain't no stop. Got
[2:41] to stop my voice. Cuz I miss the life.
[2:44] And I've learned that I can always count
[2:46] it all. Count it
[2:49] all doo doo doo
[2:51] doo.
[2:53] Oh doo doo doo doo doo doo doo. We do
[2:57] the chorus again. Got it all joy when I
[3:00] run into trouble. Got it all good when
[3:02] the bad days come. Cuz I know that
[3:05] you're always working and I know that
[3:08] you're still not done. So I'm going to
[3:10] lift your praise to the trial. Ain't no
[3:12] song going to stop my voice cuz I've
[3:15] lived some life and I've learned that I
[3:17] can always count it all. Count it all
[3:24] [Music]
[3:33] do. Count it all. Count it all joy.
[3:37] First Peter chapter 5 and verse 5.
[3:41] Likewise, ye younger, submit yourself
[3:42] unto the elder. Yay, all of you be
[3:44] subject one to another. Be clothed with
[3:47] humility, for God resisteth the p proud,
[3:51] and giveth grace to the humble. Humble
[3:53] yourselves, therefore, under the mighty
[3:55] hand of God, that he may exalt you in
[3:58] due time. Casting all your care upon
[4:02] him, for he carth for you. Casting all
[4:06] your cares upon him, for he carth for
[4:09] you. So, I've opened up a little series
[4:12] here. The series is the key in He Cares,
[4:15] Do You Care? That's a service that
[4:17] Brother Bran preached, and I won't go
[4:19] back to some of the things that we
[4:21] brought out in the last service about
[4:22] it. Uh, but it is certainly something
[4:25] that's a key message. is not so much
[4:27] doctrinal, but it's kind of an entrance
[4:30] for people uh people of God to be able
[4:33] to know the entrance into God, the
[4:35] entrance to get God's attention, the
[4:37] entrance to have a caring God step into
[4:39] our situation. And so, I think there's
[4:42] some really key elements here. And the
[4:44] key is bringing a God who cares to
[4:48] connect with a person who cares so that
[4:51] they can really be delivered. When
[4:53] brother Brandon titles it he cares, all
[4:56] of us know that and say know that we
[4:57] have a God that cares about every detail
[5:00] of our lives. But then he didn't leave
[5:02] it just that God cares. He said he
[5:04] cares. Do you care? So the key that I'm
[5:07] talking about is when we can bring those
[5:10] two things together. You have a God who
[5:12] cares. You have a God who wants to step
[5:15] into the situation. You have a God who
[5:18] wants to be the supernatural God and
[5:20] lift you out. As we were speaking of
[5:22] Sunday of the ascension and the power of
[5:24] God to lift, you have a God who cares,
[5:26] but then you've got to connect that with
[5:28] the person who really cares. So, he
[5:30] cares. Do you care? People can say they
[5:33] care, but their actions and their life
[5:36] show if they really want to get help, if
[5:38] they really want to be delivered. So, he
[5:41] cares, but but it's only half of the
[5:44] thing. In other words, God can care and
[5:46] God can step in and God can
[5:48] supernaturally move. But if he doesn't
[5:50] have that other side working with you,
[5:52] they really want deliverance, you can't
[5:54] bring that together. And actually, when
[5:56] you bring those two elements together,
[5:58] God can do something
[6:00] supernatural. God can step in and do
[6:03] something uh that's beyond human. Can
[6:05] you say amen? So if that then if that's
[6:08] true, if those two elements come
[6:09] together and something supernatural can
[6:12] happen, if it's true, then we know that
[6:14] our enemy would work really hard uh at
[6:18] making a person hesitant to turn
[6:21] everything over to him. He does not want
[6:23] to see that connection take place. Satan
[6:26] does not want to see this type of
[6:28] oneness between someone who has a need
[6:31] and a God who's a supernatural God. He
[6:33] would like to see that connection stop.
[6:35] And one of the things in this series is
[6:37] I want to get to is all the things that
[6:40] would make a person hesitant in their
[6:42] heart to embrace. And there's actually a
[6:44] word here casting all your cares. I
[6:46] don't know if you know what that means,
[6:47] but I want to break it down in the next
[6:50] services of even what casting our cares.
[6:53] We got to know what that means because
[6:55] that's what he asks us to do. to take
[6:57] all of our worries and all of our fears
[6:59] and our anxiety and our depression and
[7:02] our things that we don't understand.
[7:04] He's asking for all of the when he says
[7:07] casting all your cares, it means all of
[7:10] our cares. It we don't just handle some
[7:13] things on our own. He's actually saying
[7:16] cast all of our cares upon him. And I
[7:18] want to know what that meaning cast
[7:20] means. And it it has a deeper meaning.
[7:22] And we got to understand because that's
[7:24] what he's asked us to do is we've got to
[7:26] trust him to cast all of our cares upon
[7:29] him because he cares for those things.
[7:32] But you see now I want to explore all
[7:35] the ways the enemy tries to hold back a
[7:39] heart from trusting the Lord to cast
[7:42] everything on him because that's where
[7:44] the enemy works. That's where he's and
[7:47] uh the it's the kind of trust and guess
[7:49] what uh that kind of trust today in the
[7:53] Lord is rare. That kind of trust to cast
[7:57] all your cares upon him is rare. And why
[8:01] is that? Well, I think a lot of it is
[8:04] people don't trust. And people's image
[8:06] of God has been hurt. People's image of
[8:09] spiritual things has been hurt. And so
[8:11] now they're they they love God, but they
[8:14] hold their heart back. They don't fully
[8:16] trust. People don't trust ministry
[8:18] today. People don't trust the
[8:20] government. Of course, today they don't
[8:21] trust. But but when it comes to God, the
[8:23] real God, what a shame when Satan makes
[8:26] people mistrust God. I mean, we can
[8:29] mistrust government. We can not trust
[8:31] those other things. And you might even
[8:33] have an issue with people and people
[8:34] hurt you so much. But there comes a
[8:36] point where Satan, you have to draw a
[8:38] line with the enemy when he's causing
[8:40] you to hold back your heart from
[8:42] trusting in a God who cares. Can you say
[8:44] amen? And I want to explore all the ways
[8:47] the heart can hold back because that's
[8:50] where we run into trouble. God cannot
[8:53] fully step in when the heart is with
[8:56] withheld from him. That's right. So,
[8:58] Satan has certainly uh done his best to
[9:01] keep this connection from happening of
[9:03] he cares, do you care? And that that
[9:06] making that connection and we will just
[9:08] get into all the ways that Satan would
[9:10] uh try to uh keep somebody from fully
[9:13] trusting God and all the hindrances to
[9:15] God uh stepping into your situation.
[9:18] Remember, he does not say, "I care." God
[9:22] doesn't just say, "I care." And this is
[9:23] what I dealt with. It's his caring is
[9:26] doing something about it. God cares
[9:28] enough to step in and change things. He
[9:31] doesn't stand back and say, "I care." He
[9:34] wants to step in with his power and
[9:36] change things. Always remember that when
[9:39] you're praying, God's just saying, "I
[9:40] really care for that. Oh, I care for
[9:42] that need." No, he's ready and willing
[9:44] when the situation's right. When the
[9:46] atmosphere is right, he's wanting to
[9:48] step in and change the whole thing.
[9:49] Amen. Because he's a God that doesn't
[9:52] just say, "I care." He's a God that
[9:54] wants to step in and show that he cares.
[9:56] His caring has emotion and an action to
[10:00] it.
[10:02] And so our
[10:04] caring, he cares. Do you care? Our
[10:06] caring must have emotion and an action
[10:10] to it, not just words. Can you say amen?
[10:15] you know, um I was thinking today we
[10:18] ministers uh um have a kind of an
[10:21] interesting position and um just
[10:25] standing between God and the people and
[10:28] uh that's a that can be a wonderful
[10:30] thing. It is a privilege. It's a
[10:32] wonderful thing to kind of be uh a
[10:34] ministry of reconciliation. What you're
[10:36] reconciling is take a god that's real
[10:38] and reconcile with the hearts of men.
[10:40] And so we stand in between that. You
[10:42] stand in the gap for people as a
[10:44] minister. We stand here in the pulpit
[10:45] and we don't do this for money. We
[10:48] shouldn't do it for money. We don't do
[10:49] it for our health. Uh we don't do it
[10:51] because there's not something else to do
[10:52] it. We do it because there's a calling
[10:55] in our hearts to stand in between and
[10:58] try to connect people with this
[10:59] supernatural God and bring the people
[11:01] together with their needs that they
[11:03] have. And it's it's quite an interesting
[11:05] thing and I I won't elaborate on that,
[11:07] but it's sometimes it's good, sometimes
[11:09] it's rough, sometimes you want to put up
[11:11] your hands and uh retire. I don't think
[11:14] ministers probably can do that, but
[11:15] anyway, uh you know, sometimes you want
[11:18] to because but really what we're what we
[11:20] do this for, we want to help people. We
[11:22] want to help people be saved. We want to
[11:24] help people find their way to the foot
[11:26] of Calvary. We we and but the thing is
[11:29] is that we we have no power of our own
[11:33] to help people.
[11:36] We have no power of our own. We're not
[11:38] serving in this capacity thinking that
[11:41] we can change people. And if we do,
[11:44] we've got the wrong motive. We've got
[11:45] the wrong energy. Can you say amen? We
[11:48] really need the humility to say, "I
[11:50] can't do anything, but I can be a
[11:51] conduit to point the people to the right
[11:53] thing to bring the presence of God." Can
[11:55] you say amen? And connect the people. It
[11:58] has to be a connection with him and the
[12:00] people that happens. And we cannot help
[12:03] people. We cannot uh we cannot change
[12:06] people. Um, a matter of fact, it's today
[12:09] it's a supernatural thing when people
[12:11] change because people change but not
[12:14] much. Bill Gaither's father said that.
[12:17] He said it was some wisdom. People
[12:19] change but not much. And uh that's it
[12:23] seems like a negative statement and all
[12:25] of us in the kingdom of God realize it's
[12:27] possible for God to change people. But
[12:30] if you're looking at it without of God,
[12:32] without God, people change but not much.
[12:34] There's not much change that takes
[12:36] place. Once something's ingrained in
[12:38] their mind, once something's ingrained
[12:39] by their upbringing, once it's ingrained
[12:41] in their spirit, they pretty much stay
[12:43] that same way. It takes a supernatural
[12:46] God to change the heart and change
[12:49] thinking. Can you say amen? To be
[12:50] transformed by the renewing of our mind.
[12:53] But we ministers, and if you've served
[12:55] for a long time, then you are extremely
[12:58] sensitive to your lack of your part in
[13:02] this. And also you're sensitive to
[13:04] waiting for God to show up. Amen. Can
[13:09] you say amen? When you're young in the
[13:13] ministry, you think you can do it, but
[13:15] then God knocks the props out from
[13:17] underneath you and you realize you can't
[13:18] do anything. He did it to Paul. He did
[13:20] it to every other minister. And Paul
[13:22] finally said, "When I'm weak," uh, I
[13:25] love there's one chapter where he goes
[13:26] and starts boasting of all the things
[13:29] he's been through and all his weakness.
[13:30] Because there was some apostles or some
[13:32] preachers that were bragging. They were
[13:34] bragging. We're like Paul. We're doing
[13:36] this. We're doing that. He says, "And
[13:37] they're boasting of what they can do."
[13:39] And Paul's basically saying, "You guys
[13:42] don't have a clue what ministry is all
[13:43] about. You know, I've I've been beaten
[13:45] three times." He goes into his biography
[13:48] and he say, "This is what ministry is
[13:50] really all about. sure you want to be a
[13:51] part of this? You sure you want to do
[13:52] all this? Shipwrecked, you know, all
[13:54] these other things happen to him. And he
[13:56] says, "If I'll boast of anything, I'll
[13:58] boast of my weakness because when I'm
[14:00] weak, he becomes strong." And the only
[14:02] fruit that's come out of his ministry
[14:04] that's supernatural, it's because he
[14:06] became weaker and weaker and weaker. And
[14:08] it was not any of Paul who did it. It's
[14:11] not any ministry who does it. It's God
[14:13] who does it. We we stay disciplined to
[14:15] the call. We do everything that we can,
[14:18] but we realize what we're waiting for as
[14:20] ministers is that moment when somebody
[14:23] connects that needs something and
[14:25] connects with the supernatural God.
[14:28] We're preaching, we're preaching, and
[14:29] we're we're doing, and we're serving,
[14:32] but it's really those God moments. It's
[14:35] those moments there's a connection. Can
[14:36] you say amen? It's there's it's the
[14:38] moments, and it only takes one moment.
[14:41] Can you say amen? It only takes just one
[14:44] connection and it's over. Amen. That's
[14:47] how big God is. But you see now uh and
[14:51] and and so we don't preach. We're
[14:53] helpless unless he comes. 1 Corinthians
[14:54] 2:4, there's a power of God in the
[14:56] gospel. We're waiting on the power of
[14:58] God to change people's lives. Paul said,
[15:00] "My speech and my preaching was not with
[15:02] enticing words of man's wisdom, but in
[15:05] demonstration of the spirit and of the
[15:07] power." Paul believed that it's not to
[15:09] get up here and preach a sermon. It's
[15:11] not to dazzle people with all the
[15:13] things, you know. Uh, may we as
[15:15] ministers, if you're listening tonight,
[15:17] may we ditch all this pride and bragging
[15:19] and all this stuff we can do. And may we
[15:22] get to what Paul said is that we're
[15:24] going to bring an atmosphere that
[15:25] there's a demonstration of the spirit
[15:27] and the power of God that people can
[15:29] connect with a supernatural God. Unless
[15:32] we have that, it's a waste of time. It's
[15:35] a waste of a sermon. Can you say amen?
[15:37] And I believe in teaching, but I believe
[15:39] in teaching by the Holy Ghost. I believe
[15:42] the Holy Ghost teach not just preach.
[15:44] I'm going to do a little teaching
[15:45] tonight. But you see, it has to be by
[15:47] his power, not just intellect. What is
[15:51] serving the Lord? It's connecting with
[15:53] the creator of heavens and earth. The
[15:56] one who spoke this world into existence,
[15:59] spoke the stars into existence, is the
[16:01] same one who's speaking to you tonight.
[16:04] We're dealing with a creator. And a
[16:06] creator wants to create something new.
[16:09] Amen.
[16:11] A creator doesn't polish up and put a
[16:14] band-aid on the old. He creates
[16:17] something new.
[16:19] I'm glad that I can preach and point to
[16:21] people and welcome the creator of
[16:25] heavens and earth that can create
[16:27] something in the people. Come on, praise
[16:29] the Lord tonight. Praise the Lord. This
[16:32] isn't just church. This is the creator
[16:34] of heavens and earth showing up. And we
[16:36] want him to show up every service. We
[16:39] need this in our life. Can you say amen?
[16:41] So it's access to the creator himself.
[16:43] So as ministers, that's what we're
[16:45] looking for to really help the people,
[16:47] God. So now let me say, let's move on
[16:50] now. And you know, and you you have to
[16:52] know that there is so much to this
[16:54] series. I'm just going to slow down and
[16:57] even though I'm yelling already and
[16:59] excited, I'm going to slow down and take
[17:01] it piece by piece because this has to be
[17:03] taken piece by piece. So the next point
[17:05] I want to make, God
[17:08] cares by creating. Amen.
[17:13] God cares, shows he cares by creating
[17:16] something new.
[17:19] Never can we underestimate what a
[17:22] creative God can do. In the beginning,
[17:26] uh, and that's where you hear the word
[17:28] create a lot is in Genesis. He created
[17:31] this. God created the heavens and the
[17:33] earth. God created. And so as he took
[17:35] this the 6,000 years there and and he
[17:38] created and he you know he he he brought
[17:42] all these things and he created them.
[17:44] And you know uh before he started
[17:47] creating the Bible says the earth was
[17:50] without form and void. That means it was
[17:54] empty. It was without form. It was what
[17:57] we would call today a chaos. There was
[17:59] no order to it. But the creative power
[18:02] of God by the spoken word took chaos.
[18:08] Took chaos and created something new.
[18:11] That's right. Why are you saying that,
[18:13] brother? Cuz tonight we serve the same
[18:14] God. He doesn't want to patch up human
[18:17] beings. The creator wants to create
[18:19] something new. He wants to start over.
[18:22] Can you say amen? And he wants to take
[18:25] chaos. And so that's when you go to
[18:27] prayer for for even some trial or lack
[18:30] of something in your life. When you go
[18:32] to prayer, it's not just asking for a
[18:34] caring God to be mindful of your
[18:36] situation. You're talking to the
[18:38] creator. And the creator can change and
[18:41] create something new. Now friends,
[18:44] you're I don't want you to just just say
[18:46] amen tonight. I want you to really get
[18:48] this in your heart. When we go to pray,
[18:50] when what we're dealing with is not
[18:52] another sermon or not another movement
[18:54] here. We've tapped into and connected to
[18:57] the very creator of heavens and earth
[18:59] that can create squirrels. Can you say
[19:01] amen? That can speak to the storm and it
[19:04] would go away.
[19:05] A man spoke the words because the
[19:07] creator told him to speak the word and
[19:11] he changed and created something new,
[19:13] something that wasn't there. We're
[19:15] dealing with a creator and he cares by
[19:18] creating. He doesn't want to patch up
[19:21] something. He doesn't want to just make
[19:23] it. so God can start creating. When man
[19:26] fell and he needed
[19:28] redemption 4,000 years
[19:31] later,
[19:33] redemption is not a different work than
[19:36] creating. Redemption is bringing
[19:38] something back, but he still does it by
[19:41] creative power. Amen.
[19:45] God doesn't say, "Well, I created things
[19:47] in the beginning, but now that man has
[19:49] fallen and I've got to bring them back
[19:51] now, I'll just patch him up or I got to
[19:52] use a different way." The same creator
[19:54] that created the heavens and the earth
[19:56] now comes on the day of Pentecost and
[19:58] he's the same creator. What's he
[19:59] creating now? Not the heavens and the
[20:01] earth, but now he's taken a fallen man
[20:04] and he's by his creative word speaks his
[20:08] spirit into that man. And Paul says he
[20:12] becomes a new creature created a new in
[20:17] Jesus Christ. I was thinking of the men
[20:19] on the road to Emmas who had been with
[20:21] Jesus watched all the miracles and so
[20:24] Jesus steps in in another form and he
[20:27] and
[20:27] uh they're all troubled about it and
[20:30] they said that the the women had just
[20:32] went to the tomb and come back and
[20:34] reported that he wasn't there and
[20:36] they're just all trying to and and Jesus
[20:38] said this. Oh, fools and slow of heart
[20:42] to believe all that the prophets have
[20:45] said. And from that moment, he begins to
[20:48] open the scriptures to them to show them
[20:51] this was this has happened exactly the
[20:53] way he said. But see, they only looking
[20:54] at the flesh of what happened. Now
[20:56] they're disappointed. He's gone. But
[20:58] they're not looking at the word. This is
[20:59] exactly what was supposed to happen. You
[21:01] see, but look what he said. Oh fools and
[21:04] slow of what? Slow of heart to believe.
[21:07] Now, I just thought of it today that if
[21:10] back then Jesus is telling them, "You're
[21:13] very slow at coming along to believing
[21:16] after they'd been with Jesus physically
[21:18] for three and a half years, then how
[21:20] slow are people today to
[21:25] catch this
[21:30] thing." And that can be a real
[21:32] frustration for a minister. And a
[21:35] minister can become impatient really
[21:38] quick with people. But impatience with
[21:42] the people of God will never work.
[21:45] Fear tactics will never work.
[21:48] Force is never a good motive. Fear is
[21:52] never a good
[21:53] motive. Be in shape. They should be way
[21:56] further along than they should. You see
[21:59] what a a minister deals with? Because as
[22:01] I say to pastors, I say we hold the
[22:04] vision of where this word can take the
[22:07] people. And then as a pastor, we look at
[22:09] the saints every week and some are
[22:11] moving along, some are slow. So, and you
[22:13] can get frustrated. They're supposed to
[22:15] be over here and they're way back
[22:18] here. I'm not talking about any of you,
[22:21] of
[22:22] course, but you're caught in the middle
[22:24] saying, "How can they not see the vision
[22:27] of where this word can take them?" When
[22:29] you got that vision, you say, "My, they
[22:31] should be much further along. Maybe I
[22:33] should be much further along." And you
[22:34] get frustrated with it. But you can't
[22:36] because why? They're slow of heart to
[22:38] believe. But all it takes is one moment
[22:41] in a connection to God, the creator, and
[22:45] that's it. So now, let's move to the
[22:47] next step here. Now, God cares by
[22:49] stepping in and creating. You listening?
[22:53] We show we care by creating the right
[22:56] atmosphere for him to step into.
[23:02] He shows he cares by bringing the
[23:05] creative power of God to create
[23:07] something new and start a
[23:09] fresh. Remember this now. We can't just
[23:11] have a God who cares. Do you care? Well,
[23:14] I want to get into how do we show we
[23:16] care? Well, we're we're creators. And
[23:19] the biggest thing that we create, we
[23:21] can't uh the biggest thing we start by
[23:23] creating is creating the right
[23:25] atmosphere. We're atmosphere creators.
[23:27] You change the atmosphere. You open the
[23:29] door for a creative God to come in. So I
[23:32] want I want you to learn now this. He
[23:35] cares. Do you care? It's God the creator
[23:37] on one side. It's a creator of the right
[23:40] atmosphere on the other side. Creating
[23:42] an atmosphere for God to step in and do
[23:44] something supernatural. It's creating on
[23:48] both sides. It's creating on both sides.
[23:50] You by your attitude and your humility
[23:54] create a different atmosphere that
[23:56] welcomes a creator who cares to step
[23:59] into the room and make
[24:01] changes. Let me say that again. You by
[24:04] your attitude, your humility uh create a
[24:07] different atmosphere. You change the
[24:09] atmosphere and it makes it welcome for a
[24:12] creator to step in.
[24:15] Now, that opens us to the next section
[24:17] here to just begin exploring ways that
[24:20] we can approach and come to him to show
[24:22] we really care. Some of this that you're
[24:24] going to know, some of that you some of
[24:26] this you may not know, but we want to
[24:28] explore. We've probably heard enough
[24:29] preaching about how God cares. He's a
[24:32] supernatural God. He's a creative God. I
[24:34] wanted to deal with that tonight. But we
[24:36] really want to begin to break down how
[24:39] we can create an atmosphere and offer up
[24:41] our hearts. so that we can create the
[24:44] right atmosphere so that for the creator
[24:46] to step in. He cares but do you care?
[24:49] How do we show we care? So we want to
[24:51] explore this approach. We want to
[24:53] explore this and we can come to him and
[24:56] show we really care and create the right
[24:59] atmosphere and and we want to break down
[25:01] the approach to it and those who are
[25:04] interested in a caring God to step in
[25:06] will be interested in these things. One
[25:09] of the things that we do to show that we
[25:11] care and that we want to get help and
[25:14] that we want to connect with God is that
[25:16] you're willing to say, "Lord, line up my
[25:20] heart with your word and my confession."
[25:24] Because why? It it it creates the right
[25:28] heart and atmosphere for God to step in.
[25:31] Amen. And you can't ignore
[25:34] it and get something greater from God.
[25:37] You can't. You're showing if you're
[25:39] hiding things, you're showing it you
[25:41] don't really care. Can I be
[25:44] real? If you're still hiding things or
[25:48] you're not still not being honest about
[25:50] things, you're showing God that you
[25:53] really don't care to get freedom that
[25:56] you're asking for. But let me show you
[25:57] where we're going with some of these
[25:59] points of how we show we care. Okay? And
[26:01] there'll be more to these, but I just
[26:03] wrote seven down tonight. If he says he
[26:05] cares, do you care? How do we show we
[26:07] care? The first one is real, true,
[26:10] unclouded faith from the heart. When
[26:12] that's clear, then we're showing we
[26:14] really care. If it's left hidden, if
[26:17] it's you're hiding things, if the
[26:19] devil's put unbelief there, this isn't
[26:21] for me. I don't believe it because I
[26:23] believe it's for the person sitting next
[26:24] to me, but I don't believe it's for me.
[26:26] Any kind of cloud like that over your
[26:28] heart, uh, is not going to give you the
[26:30] faith that you need to step out. It has
[26:33] to be a foundation of faith. Number two,
[26:35] true submission from the heart. Where do
[26:37] I get that from? I get it from the
[26:39] scripture in the text that reads,
[26:41] "Submit yourself one to another." So
[26:44] submission, true, and as I say, true
[26:47] submission from the heart. Number three,
[26:50] real true humility from the heart.
[26:52] That's in our text. He said, "Humble
[26:54] yourselves under the mighty hand of
[26:56] God." And that's the entrance to to
[26:58] showing you care. You've got to really
[27:01] humble yourself. And I want to elaborate
[27:03] what humility is because it's not just
[27:05] the word. It comes across in our actions
[27:08] and our words and our heart towards God
[27:10] that you're really humble. You don't
[27:11] think you got it all figured out, but
[27:13] God has it figured out truly casting
[27:16] stress, anxiety, worries, and fears on
[27:19] him. And I'm bringing all these words
[27:20] cuz he says, "Cast your cares." And
[27:23] cares is related to stress, anxiety,
[27:26] worries, and fears. It says, "Truly come
[27:29] and cast all those fears upon me." Do
[27:32] you care about getting deliverance? If
[27:34] you care, you're ready to cast all those
[27:36] things on him. Giving more attention to
[27:39] him that is speaking. You need to give
[27:42] more earnest heed to who's speaking. You
[27:45] ever had a kid that's just has selective
[27:47] hearing? You ever give sit them down,
[27:49] look in the face, and give them
[27:50] instruction, and they look like a deer
[27:52] looking at headlights of your car, and
[27:54] they didn't get any of it. Can we be
[27:56] that way with God where we're hearing
[27:58] all the stuff, but we're not valuing,
[28:00] hey, sit still. The Lord's speaking.
[28:02] Perseverance that will not run away or
[28:05] hide. Desperation that won't give up
[28:08] shows that we care for watching our
