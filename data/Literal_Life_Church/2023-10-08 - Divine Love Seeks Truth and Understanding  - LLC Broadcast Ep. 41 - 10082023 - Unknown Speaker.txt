TRANSCRIPT
========================================
hi everybody Pastor Paul LaFontaine and literal Life Church in Petersburg Michigan would like to invite you to take the next half hour and enjoy some time in the word of God if you're hungry for more of Christ we believe you can be fed and we pray that you'll be blessed visit our website for more information at literallife.church may God bless you my friend and may the music and message encourage you today [Music] I've scaled all the highest of mountains and I've stood at the edge of their peaks but I still can't see to the edge of your love for me [Music] a wildest of waters and I sunk to the deaths of the sea but I still couldn't find them their deaths of your love for me can't contain all your love for me no matter how high or far I reach there is [Music] old belief in the valley and I barely held on through the night but just when I thought it was darkest the sun began to rise cause Canyons wide Oceans Deep can't continue [Music] where can I run that you wanna run after me oh how could I fall when you already took the fall for me beyond the stars to the very breath I breathe there's nowhere to your love for me where could I run that you wanna run after me after me how could I fall when you already took the fall for me beyond the stars to the very breath I breathe [Music] can't contain all your love for me no matter how high or far I reach there's no ways to your love for me your love for me oh there's nothing like your love foreign s chapter 3 and verse 16. that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit where in the Inner Man we know we have an outer man we know we have this flesh but where we need to be strengthened is in the Inner Man and we actually need to be living every day from the inner man we need to be operating from the inner man how many would like to live that way so his theme is the inner man then he says that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love rooted how many wants to be rooted and grounded in love amen that's a good motive that's a good source where everything is is happening and your reactions to everything it's the Divine Capstone love of God that's what's rooted that's what that's at the roots of who you are in the inner man that you may be able to comprehend I want you to notice that word comprehend because that's that's understanding that's understanding of things that you may be able to understand with All Saints what is the breath and length and depth and height of what to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fullness of god notice verse 19 is what I've been preaching on a little bit and that the love of God Divine love that which is within us will pass knowledge in other words you can't let your thoughts interrupt what the love of God wants to do let me remember that from last Sunday I think I preached on when When Love is motivating you and it begins to move in your heart and it's divine love go with it what interrupts it our own thinking this proves that by scripture when he says to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge the love of God can go Way Beyond what your mind can do it's more powerful than your mind can you say man it passes all knowledge we're so uh bent in this generation to use our minds and all these other things and and God gave us a mind but you see when it interrupts the love of God and the leading of the Holy Spirit that's when we're in trouble so this love passeth knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God how many you want to be filled with the fullness of God now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ask or here we are again think this love can go beyond what you could even think about doing okay that's why we need to liver that you'll be able to unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh where it's working in us the the theme out of the four or five verses that I read is that we live from the inner man the inner man be strengthened so you have the inner man you had your life rooted and grounded in love and may we may be able to comprehend which is understanding you have the theme of understanding and then we have the love of Christ that passes knowledge and can do above whatever we ask or think so there are some elements key elements in that scripture that I'm going to pull out in some other scriptures and I want to speak as a theme this morning this is my subject Divine love seeks out truth and understanding Divine love seeks truth and understanding I want to delve into that and speak about it because a lot of times our mind and we're thinking only with our mind without the love of Christ without the Holy Ghost our minds will come to a certain place there because they're limited um they will stop at certain points and it'll only goes so far but Divine love is always seeking for more truth and seeking for a greater understanding of every situation first of all it seeks a greater understanding of God if you're understanding in Revelation of God is limited then that's going to eventually bring trouble so we should always be saying Lord increase my Revelation and understanding of you first Corinthians 10 1 moreover Brethren I would not that ye should be ignorant how that all of our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and were all baptized unto Moses the prophet in the cloud and in the sea and did all eat the same spiritual drink and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drink of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ now can anybody hear some of our history in the last days in the first four verses they have a cloud they have a prophet can you say Amen they all eat they all seen the same Miracles under the prophet they had a journey to come out of Egypt the message called them out of Egypt they got all that they got the cloud in the sky they got the pillar of fire at night they drank from the spiritual rock that was Rock was Christ they all enjoyed and this is this is our history now look at the history here now verse 5 but with many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness these things were examples to the intent that we should not lust after evil things as they lust it neither be idolaters as were some of them as it was written the people sat down to eat and drink and Rose up to play neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three and twenty thousand neither let us tempt Christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed as serpents neither murmur ye as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the destroyed this is I didn't want this to be a part of our history but I can tell you the same people that Wonder a prophet had these characteristics as well idolaters yes not the world not out the systems The People Under The Prophet to people under the cloud idolaters murmurs complaining tempting the Lord you know how they tempt the Lord they said is the Lord even among us or not that's tempting the Lord now all these things happen unto them for examples and they were unto us for examples and they were written for our admonition our rebuke upon whom the ends of the world are come so we see the history we see it it types us we see all those things happen but notice verse 12 wherefore let him that thinketh he stand take heed lest he fall the problem was in their thinking and so if you're going to take their example then it's going to go back to our thing let him a man thinketh he stand take heed lest he fall if you get lifted up in yourself and says you know I don't need this I don't need to respect this I'm better than this it was their thinking and trying to work out is God Among Us or not why does God give us all this to eat and then now we're thirsty I want to go back to Egypt it was childlessness and what the childlessness was is they were using their own thinking to process the message they were still after 40 years were using too much of their own thinking to process God and you can't use your mind to try to process God you won't figure it out you're going to be confused you can't let your mind abort the knowledge and what God's trying to do you don't think we have murmuring and complaining you don't think we have people committing a fornication well I don't live in fornication out you know fornication is a young person living with another with a girl with a mate without being married to you we don't believe in that the Bible forbids it's against fornication if they're living with a man or a woman out of wedlock they're living in sin they're living in fornication how many still believe that okay it's your Bible can you say man but these had a fornication and it isn't always just physical fornication but they committed it sometimes it's spiritual fornication sometimes it's idolatry sometimes it's a different type of idolatry we have all this but where is the problem if you're going to take an example the problem is let a man take heed in his thinking when he thinketh he stand take heed lest he fall and they all fell in the wilderness even though they were under a prophet Psalms 106 verse 7. our fathers David talking about our history the history of the Jews our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies but provoked him at the sea even at the Red Sea but that's the scripture he used as a text God being misunderstood because they misunderstood God and didn't understand the Wonders and didn't understand what God was doing this is how they got into all this trouble quick with me go with back with me to the New Testament to Colossians chapter 2 if you would and as I said I'm just laying these in as a foundation and then we can move on but I want you to catch the themes they didn't understand Colossians chapter 2 and verse 1 says for I would that that ye knew what great conflict I have for you and for them at laodicea for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh that their hearts might be comforted being knit together in love and unto all all Riches of the full Assurance of what understanding the full Assurance of understanding to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God and the father and our Christ and that is the is the uh is a more intimate understanding of the mystery of God all of us need a more intimate understanding of the mystery of God and that's when you have your hearts knitted in love in whom are all hid the treasures of wisdom uh and knowledge and they will just leave it there but here's the same thing understanding here's the same thing love knitted together in love understanding growing Divine love seeks truth and seeks understanding that's what we're growing in in this Divine love our hearts being knit together oh how we love have a greater knit together knit together by what by Divine love not separating from one another but our hearts knit together by love you'll never get everybody together in their minds there's too many opinions and and mine are probably just as bad as yours but if we can lay opinions aside and lay our thinking aside and our complexes and our reading into things and say let Divine love knit our hearts together let this Supernatural thing happen Among Us but it comes by understanding one another and God deeper and if you won't take the time to understand somebody you're going to remain trapped in what you think of them all of these are a theme of understanding love and they go together so with that scriptural basis now I'm presenting to you that Divine love when it's moving in you will always seek out the truth and true understanding it will always keep seeking more truth and understanding whether it's of God or whether it's of the other person and as the truth comes out and as more understanding comes out there's so many factors to something that happens and uh so a lot of people don't wait for the true facts to come in they just their mind concludes bang that's it that's what happened and then they categorize that person put them in a certain place you know they must be Serpentine we don't have a right to do that he must be this way he must be that way and we conclude lacking information lacking understanding of it can you say man and and so there's a lot of factors to something that takes place in your life and uh you know something something happens sometimes when people 30 40 years later in a family usually it's in family situations and something happened way back then and there was a disturbance and there was a disagreement and and so everybody Drew their lines in the sand everybody dug their heels in and I've talked to family members and say I've even talked to that person in 30 years since that incident I haven't talked to them in 30 years and not every situation is this way but some situations are is that somehow something happens where the more truth comes out and more understanding and they talk they're at a birthday party and they just talk and the other person says well I did this because of this and I was it and all of a sudden the other person goes I didn't know that I didn't know that's why you did that and now more after 30 years there's an understanding of what really took place and the facts we don't even go we're we're going to go with it when he when we don't even have all the facts in but I want to say this even when you got facts even when somebody has sinned even when you know that's the facts they did it I'm reminding you of Jesus when the Pharisees brought that woman they had facts they caught her in the ACT I'm going to say to you that the love of Christ is even greater than that it's greater than the truth there's forgiveness in it and it's greater than the facts you may stand there in your mind I got facts that's it it's truth it happened they did me wrong they sinned it's over not with the love of Christ it's never over got the facts you got scissors and then here's another thing you've got if you have all the facts you got that person's heart you you can have something happen and not know the person's heart sometimes can you say man not know where they're at not under not understand where they were coming from during that time and misread and misinterpret and misunderstand why they acted that way it's not to justify sin but we should be seeking to know the full facts and know the understanding of the person's heart this is divine love this is what divine love does because when you got a full understanding of it then you really know how to pray you really know how to act you really know how to respond correctly instead of your mind figuring it all out and you're concluding isn't it time that we're operating from Divine love isn't it time that our denominational differences end isn't it time that we quit lifting up big preachers and making little ones more little and isn't it time to grow out of all this childishness isn't this the final end operating from the inward man every individual operating including preachers operating from the Inman inward man I can tell you everything possible everything is possible when coming from that inward man all things are possible but most the time I wonder if we're not giving him a chance to operate we're all Christians this morning we all love God we're lovely people you're all lovely people I love you all of you I hope you you love me I believe you do but I wonder how many decisions every day and actions are made in our life from another source than your inward mind that's what Thrills me about the grace of God today I'm thrilled about the grace of God because we have his favor to receive preaching like this we are favored of God to hear what God wants to give us through the ministry and through what we read in our Bibles and study the word we are favored because he's going to give us instruction and he's going to lead us if we'll yield into a life of let this mind be in you which is also in Christ Jesus and that we're LED from the inward man his grace is going to lead us there if we'll submit submissions got such a bad word to it a bad connotation today it's a Biblical word no matter how many decisions so it Thrills me of the Grace today we are we have his favor and listen to this despite this overwhelming influence of our flesh the overwhelming influence of our minds the overwhelming influence of our past our fears our abuse from other people are people that have targeted us our mistakes our sins our weaknesses our inbred family sins and strains in our family our pride and if you are eliminating you from any of these I'm reading you've got too much pride all of us have this say Amen or ouch or something inbred weaknesses from family inbred strains and family Pride a family Pride a religious Pride our fleshly atmosphere we live in our laodicean age of laziness spiritually our dirty sex appeal-driven world it's a dirty sexual uh perverted world can you say man our material and money driven America that everything's about the Mighty Dollar you take all that and God's grace still comes down to us and said but I want you to live from the Imran I'm calling to you to something higher it's not your possessions it's not your businesses it's not how somebody has done you wrong that's all lesser things let's let loose of lesser things let's let it go and get to living from Divine love how many conclusions have we made about God and others that did not have the full truth to them how many years ago did it happen and there are stories like I said that go on for years and then all of a sudden there's an understanding and there's been walls up for years been hatred for years and then somehow it gets talked about and ends up that the whole thing was a complete misunderstanding no one took the time to be adults and sit down and seek the full story there's something about wants to conclude about things there's something about our thing that wants to bring a final judgment on stuff and really only God has the final say God has the final judgment on matters we should be able to judge matters Paul said that to the Corinthians you shouldn't be going to law with one another you should be judge matters amongst yourself in other words he's saying you should have the maturity to work it out the judge matters it's settled it's done we're going on with the Lord but no nobody wants to sit down and be adults about it and our mind wants to judge it wants to conclude and it wants to put people in a category I don't know why we're bent that way but we are our thinking without the love of God listens out to a status of God itself our minds are the facts the law our minds bring the facts our minds are the lawyer our minds are the jury and our minds are the judge and our minds are the sentence we got a whole Court in our imagination in our mind but it can interrupt it can judge it can sentence it can bring a final judgment on something and our minds are too limited and and not infinite they're finite and they're they're not infinite like gauze and it's quite often because God knows all things he's the infinite God he knows every hair of your head of everybody's head you don't understand infinite like that he knows everything he knew it from the beginning your mind don't know that quite often that our minds becomes the whole justice system and it becomes like the justice system in our world that is not very balanced and doesn't get to the full truth sometimes our thinking becomes a filter besides events that never get a full understanding it filters all future events through that filter did you hear what I said our thinking becomes a filter besides events that never get a full understanding it filters all future events through that filter to where there's no trust but I'm preaching to you the love of God and the love of God is not that way and it seeks truth and it seats understanding of one another can you say man this is a presence that seeks out and is mature enough to fully understand before it makes a judgment call and then it's a power to wash all sin away and wash it away to forgive and not just forgive to be reconciled because how many know if you've studied it there's a difference in forgiveness and Reconciliation you can forgive somebody but not be reconciled you say well how can I reconcile somebody who doesn't reconcile that's not your fault that's their fault but Divine love is not only seeking forgiveness and repentance it's seeking reconciliation I must bring that if I can do everything to bring that together to understand to forgive and bring the fellowship that Satan doesn't get in between us I must bring it together as best I can and if they shut it down that I've done my part to express the love of God but we should not stop at forgiveness my relationship with the Lord did not stop when he forgave me I have been reconciled in Fellowship back to my god there are no walls between us there is no guilt if I sit and make a mistake I bring it quickly under the blood and I'm right back in Fellowship again this is the three basis for relationship true repentance true forgiveness and true reconciliation and the mind even says no I'm not going to go talk to that person no I'm not going to go try to resolve this I'm not going to do it your mind says that because we're afraid of Confrontation they're not they're not going to listen anyway it's all here this isn't down here it's all here it's not worth it I don't like confrontation I just I'm an easy going fella you know just let everything just happen and there's only thing one thing I can see in the scriptures sometimes that would make us be silent and that's when Jesus was falsely accused and he opened not his mouth but most other things and sometimes even that you're seeking understanding and you're seeking reconciliation this is what the love of God does but there's not enough adulthood sometimes to sit down work it out clear it out move on the Mind stops you from doing just the brotherly love thing which I can give you several scriptures someone has ought against you someone has overtaken in a fault ye with your spiritual goal restores that to one in the spirit of meekness considering yourself lest you fall also I don't see this happening a lot we're too scared to do it our mind interrupted our mind aborts it I imagine says ever just leave it alone not always we shouldn't always leave it alone the scripture encourages us to try to resolve scripture says go to another one go to another one the mind and doctors exalts itself said I don't really need them anyway in my life or I tried I tried to do it I text them and said hello and they never reconciled with me you text them and said hello that was an effort to reconcile that's it they're done you know I tried you did no spending time to really resolve it this is something to advise to all of our Lives brothers and sisters all of our Lives there's so many examples now that I could give you in my life so that I'm not preaching at you I'm preaching it myself of misunderstandings and a lack of understanding for the heart and red things the wrong way because of not fully understanding and lack of this can damage the family thank you for watching our message
