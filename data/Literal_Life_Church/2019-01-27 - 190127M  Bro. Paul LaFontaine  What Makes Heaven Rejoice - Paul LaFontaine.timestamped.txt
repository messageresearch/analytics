[1:16] amen amen amen praise the Lord let's
[1:18] turn in our Bibles this morning if you
[1:20] would to Luke chapter 15 and of course
[1:24] we want to welcome all of you here to
[1:26] gather with us today in this warm place
[1:28] and we had to cancel last Sunday has a
[1:32] lot of churches do when we have this
[1:35] weather in the winter and we probably in
[1:37] some ways should have canceled the road
[1:38] out here wasn't good out in the country
[1:40] but I think if we to cancel this morning
[1:42] we had a revolt as we all want to get to
[1:44] church so we're glad to be here and
[1:47] we're thankful for that God's given us
[1:49] this place to be able to come sister
[1:51] Inez asked for prayer this morning I
[1:53] don't know if they mention it in the
[1:54] prayer request but she called a little
[1:56] while ago and she fell this weekend so
[1:58] she's in some pain from that fall and
[2:00] she wasn't able to make it this morning
[2:01] so remember if he would sister Inez
[2:03] before the Lord and then we just want to
[2:07] pray for brother Brandon who's speaking
[2:09] away today brother ray excuse me brother
[2:11] Sam Browning's ministering away so let's
[2:14] keep him in prayer on the third Sunday

[2:20] going to have brother ray Erickson here
[2:22] speaking for us and we're looking
[2:23] forward to that brother ray has become a
[2:26] real friend to me and also just a real
[2:28] stability I believe to the Lima area
[2:30] through the years his faithfulness is
[2:32] consistency and I appreciate him so much
[2:35] I learned a lot from him so this would
[2:37] be the first time I think in many years
[2:38] we've had them we're looking forward to
[2:40] have him speak for that Sunday let's
[2:41] pray the weather stays good for us and
[2:43] then we'll have a little couples

[2:51] couples so we're looking forward to that
[2:52] as well we'll send out a flyer on that
[2:55] here in the next couple days so you have
[2:57] all the information and we're looking
[2:59] forward to that we just pray we can be
[3:01] able to do that I just ask for your
[3:03] grace and your tolerance to the back
[3:05] area here in the next week or so
[3:07] Ike's gonna be taking out this sound
[3:09] booth area so we can have some more
[3:10] seating in the back so just have
[3:12] tolerance there in our mess that we have
[3:14] and we're just gonna try to get that
[3:16] done as soon as we can for the young
[3:17] people they're having a banquet down
[3:19] brother Nathan Erickson is having a
[3:20] banquet down in Finley I believe it is
[3:23] coming up February 9th and I think you
[3:25] got a register for that right away so
[3:27] remember that date if you would
[3:28] and we encourage you to go to that
[3:30] banquet I think it'll be a good one it's
[3:32] a lot of youth coming out so I just pray
[3:34] for that and God be with young people
[3:36] that gathered together for that brother
[3:38] Daryl Townsend has your receipts today
[3:40] for your giving from last year and I
[3:42] want to say I appreciate him for doing
[3:44] all that for me because I cannot stand
[3:45] doing anything tax related this is a
[3:48] depressing time of year when you have to
[3:50] do all that I'm sure all you just love
[3:52] it know what you love doing that stuff
[3:53] but he takes care of some of those
[3:54] things that we appreciate him taking the
[3:56] time he's in a very busy schedule
[3:57] himself taking care of the just his
[4:01] business first of all and where he works
[4:03] and then to take on the extra church
[4:04] stuff we just appreciate so much and all
[4:07] the trustees and treasures and
[4:08] everything we had a little problem this
[4:09] week with the septic we've had to get
[4:11] worked on they're gonna be working on it
[4:13] more tomorrow and you can imagine the
[4:14] cold temperatures that they have to work
[4:15] in to be able to fix that but it is
[4:17] become a problem we have to deal with
[4:19] and last last Wednesday we had some leak
[4:24] or something down in the basement and I
[4:26] want to say I appreciate brother Henry
[4:27] taking his day out of his regular work
[4:29] schedule and fixing that problem with
[4:31] the same and brother Tom out here almost
[4:32] the whole day so you don't see some of
[4:35] these things but I want to show
[4:36] appreciation to some of the office and
[4:38] the church that do things in between
[4:39] their work schedules and sacrifice and
[4:42] so we appreciate it very much we have a
[4:44] brother art with us this morning and my
[4:46] wife and I have of course up homecare
[4:48] business and one of the facilities we
[4:50] service are we do a little Bible study
[4:53] there every what is it Tuesday mornings
[4:55] and so are several people come out when
[4:58] we studied the Bible you know the art
[4:59] has a real love for the word and he's
[5:01] with us this morning this service I want
[5:02] to welcome you art to our service this
[5:04] morning god bless you good to have you
[5:07] amen real hunger for the Word of God and
[5:11] we just pray that we could encourage him
[5:13] and those things praise the Lord we're
[5:15] reading from Luke chapter 15 and we'll
[5:17] start reading in verse 1 you love the
[5:21] Lord today amen then drew near unto him
[5:25] all the publicans and sinners for to
[5:27] hear him and the Pharisees inscribed
[5:30] murmured saying this man receiveth
[5:32] sinners and eateth with them and that
[5:34] was already wrong because he didn't
[5:36] really go out to them or he didn't ask
[5:39] them they came to Jesus and they felt
[5:41] comfortable enough to
[5:42] get around Jesus all that we would live
[5:44] lives that even the sinner is
[5:46] comfortable to be around us can you say
[5:48] man that's our Lord there and they came
[5:51] to him and wanted to be around him but
[5:53] the Pharisees criticized it and they
[5:56] went on to say this man receiveth
[5:57] sinners and eateth with him and he spake
[6:00] this parable unto them saying and in the
[6:02] next chapter he gives three parables
[6:05] related to this whole subject of the
[6:08] lost sheep or the lost coin or the
[6:10] prodigal son in other words putting
[6:13] emphasis that the church world and the
[6:15] religious people putting emphasis and
[6:17] the people that were already there and
[6:18] their place that they stood but not
[6:21] reaching out to someone who's a lost
[6:23] sheep so these the first parable reread
[6:25] a few weeks ago what man of you having a
[6:27] hundred sheep if he lose one of them
[6:29] does not leave the ninety and nine in
[6:31] the wilderness and go after that which
[6:33] was lost until he find it and when he
[6:35] had found it he layeth it on his
[6:37] shoulders rejoicing and when he cometh
[6:39] home he call it together his friends and
[6:41] neighbors saying unto them rejoice with
[6:44] me for how I found my sheep which was
[6:46] lost I say unto you that likewise joy
[6:48] shall be in heaven over one sinner that
[6:51] repenteth more than over ninety and nine
[6:54] just persons which need no repentance
[7:00] so I don't even know if this is just
[7:03] believers as such but these is a
[7:06] catechist is a category of people we can
[7:08] think of the 99 is the people that are
[7:09] already saved in here but these are
[7:12] people that are just persons among to
[7:15] themselves and here's the big problem
[7:18] they don't need repentance that's a
[7:20] serious state to be in so you got to see
[7:25] the emphasis here is this this is not a
[7:27] kind of the Baptist has made this thing
[7:29] leave the ninety-nine and go out
[7:31] reaching to thee and I believe in doing
[7:32] that but you got to realize that with
[7:34] the subject use is not just the sinner
[7:35] comes but but that there's true
[7:38] repentance in that heart and heaven
[7:41] rejoices over true repentance can you
[7:44] say Amen and the other guys they're
[7:46] there but there's no repentance in their
[7:48] heart even though they themselves are
[7:50] just persons so either what and then he
[7:53] goes into this here verse eight either
[7:55] what
[7:56] having ten pieces of silver if she lose
[7:58] one piece if not light a candle and
[8:00] sweep the house and seek diligently till
[8:03] she find it and when she has found it
[8:05] she calleth her friends and neighbors
[8:07] together saying rejoice with me I want
[8:09] you to notice today the rejoicing that
[8:11] takes place when a lost sheep or lost
[8:14] coin is found there's joy
[8:17] there's rejoicing I have found the peace
[8:20] was I lost likewise I saying to you
[8:22] there is joy in the presence of angels
[8:25] of God over one sinner that repenteth
[8:30] father bless your word today and may you
[8:33] God bring the anointing upon us and we
[8:35] have prayed yesterday Lord this morning
[8:38] and just laying our lives before you and
[8:40] Father we are looking to you each of our
[8:44] lives are as we enter these times that
[8:46] we live in Lord where we know that there
[8:49] are things Lord that will take place
[8:51] more and more that God bring us to our
[8:54] knees and bring us to more of a
[8:56] dependence on you and one thing Lord we
[8:59] learned about living here in America
[9:00] that we have so many things that we can
[9:02] depend on it tends to remove our need
[9:05] for God Lord we don't want to live that
[9:07] way we're not called to be Laodiceans we
[9:10] don't want to depend on our income or
[9:12] depend on the social kiss that Social
[9:15] Security or depend on things of this
[9:17] life lord help us if the Americans Lord
[9:20] to learn to depend on you and to say to
[9:23] you Lord we need you more than we've
[9:25] ever needed you before god I pray that
[9:27] you'll inspire and anoint us today and
[9:29] we feel feeble in our own strength Lord
[9:32] we just don't feel capable of meeting
[9:35] the needs that are here and on the
[9:36] internet and the places that are
[9:38] listening but Lord there's a source this
[9:40] morning there's a fountain that we can
[9:42] drink from there's a fountain of life
[9:44] that Lord has a source of life and every
[9:48] need in every habit and everything Lord
[9:51] that we find in this life that we can't
[9:54] seem to overcome Lord you've given us a
[9:56] place to drink of your fountain and all
[9:58] we depend on that this morning we feel
[10:01] humbled to be here we pray you bless our
[10:03] time of fellowship in your word today in
[10:05] Jesus name we ask it amen does she maybe
[10:09] see
[10:10] did let me know Ike when I when you get
[10:12] this mic working you got it good okay so
[10:16] I want to speak a little bit today while
[10:17] we are here and I guess we're here
[10:21] because we don't want to be out there
[10:23] can you say man so I have kind of its
[10:27] kind of like a prison ministry I have a
[10:28] captive audience
[10:30] president ministry has a captive
[10:31] audience you know praise the Lord
[10:35] and we're thank the Lord for the heat we
[10:36] have heat this morning I want to we're
[10:39] looking at these parables here that's in
[10:41] Luke chapter 15 but I want to just stop
[10:45] for a moment and as we we want to move
[10:48] on to the other two parables in the
[10:49] chapter but over the last couple weeks
[10:52] as we've been out we have been thinking
[10:55] about these scriptures and thinking
[10:57] about what we brought the first of the
[10:58] year here concerning finding the lost
[11:00] sheep and and these different things but
[11:03] I can't seem to get over not speaking
[11:05] and taking a service or two about number
[11:08] one about repentance but also this
[11:11] rejoicing that takes place in this joy
[11:13] that takes place over when someone comes
[11:18] back to the Lord or when someone comes
[11:19] and has offers true repentance to God
[11:21] and it's been turning some thoughts
[11:24] within me as we see that the the
[11:27] rejoicing that took place was first of
[11:30] all in heaven and it's it's caused me to
[11:33] ask the question and i i've trust that
[11:37] you'll just ask it with me this morning
[11:38] and then we'll take the scriptures and
[11:40] answer this but I've been asking from
[11:42] this scripture what makes heaven rejoice
[11:46] what is it that makes heaven rejoice
[11:49] what brings joy in heaven and this
[11:51] scripture is an example of what brings
[11:53] joy in heaven but as I look this isn't
[11:56] the only thing that brings joy in heaven
[11:58] so I was asking what brings joy in
[12:01] heaven and then also asking what makes
[12:05] us rejoice what brings joy to your life
[12:10] what brings joy to a believer and I
[12:15] think that as we grow in the Lord I
[12:18] think the source of our joy and I think
[12:21] our rejoicing should
[12:23] match what they rejoice in in heaven
[12:27] because if we have a great separation in
[12:30] that that we're taking our joy in life
[12:31] out of a bunch of other things but it
[12:34] doesn't get heaven happy at all then I
[12:37] think there's a huge separation there
[12:38] and I think I would become interested
[12:40] what makes heaven rejoice what turns up
[12:43] the heart of God what what moves the
[12:45] heart of God and what makes the Angels
[12:47] rejoice and I begin to look at these
[12:49] places yesterday in the scripture to see
[12:51] what is it that makes heaven rejoice
[12:52] because I think that we should be
[12:54] growing they say Lord that's what I want
[12:56] to be as the source of my joy and what
[13:00] makes me happy in life I don't want a
[13:02] worldly view of what makes me happy I
[13:04] want to I don't want to draw my source
[13:05] from the same sources as the world but I
[13:08] want to rejoice in the same thing reject
[13:10] Heaven is rejoicing over can I get
[13:12] another Amen on that I want to have my
[13:15] life so it should be the same whatever
[13:17] makes heaven rejoice is what I want my
[13:20] life to rejoice in and to grow because
[13:23] we can take our joy from a lot of
[13:25] sources and I find in this as we've
[13:27] studied that that what gives a believer
[13:29] joy is completely different than what
[13:32] the world and I know you know this but
[13:34] I'm reminding us that what gives the
[13:37] believer joy is completely different
[13:39] than what gives the world joy in matter
[13:43] of fact some of the things that brings a
[13:44] believer joy and makes them happy and
[13:46] content and just really brings those
[13:48] feelings of on the inside of true joy
[13:51] and happiness they tend to be strange
[13:54] things to the world in other words
[13:56] strange things make a believer happy
[13:59] strange things bring joy to a believer
[14:02] where the world would laugh at you and
[14:03] mock at you and say why are you happy
[14:06] about that why is you happy where are
[14:08] you so happy since you left and you're
[14:10] it's Monday morning and you got a smile
[14:12] on your face and you're excited and you
[14:15] got to skip in your step and God has
[14:18] done something for you and got a spoke
[14:19] something to you that's really real and
[14:21] they can see it on your face they can
[14:23] see it in your life they can see it in
[14:25] your body language and they ask what
[14:27] what was that well God I would you know
[14:29] my favorite time this week you tell them
[14:31] in testimony my favorite time this week
[14:33] was when we were in the house of God
[14:35] yesterday and gods
[14:36] residence was so real they're gonna look
[14:39] at you pretty crazy because the world
[14:42] draws their source of joy from different
[14:45] sources can you say ma'am and it's
[14:47] strange to a believer where we get our
[14:49] source of joy but it's strange to the
[14:51] world what makes a believer happy I just
[14:54] want to make sure that we're drawing our
[14:56] joy from the right source because the
[14:58] the world does off for joys the world
[15:01] also offers peace jesus said i give you
[15:05] peace not as the world gives peace which
[15:08] lets us know the world has a peace it
[15:11] can give you how many know the world has
[15:13] a peace how many know the world has joys
[15:16] but you see I don't give you what they
[15:19] give you I give you an eternal peace I
[15:23] give you something that comes from
[15:24] another dimension
[15:25] I give you something that's not on the
[15:27] level at all with what the world can
[15:28] give can I just can you say Amen this
[15:31] morning so I don't want to spend too
[15:33] much time on the world's Joy's I will
[15:36] talk about them a little bit and I don't
[15:38] want to spend too much time because you
[15:39] are well you are well versed in what the
[15:43] world has to offer as far as its joy and
[15:45] things that bring you happiness we are
[15:47] well you know why we're so well-versed
[15:49] at it we know why we know it so well
[15:51] because we're the television generation
[15:53] we're the media generation where Satan
[15:55] has access to all those things to to
[15:58] manipulate the human being so much and
[16:01] manipulate even our responses now Satan
[16:05] has used them that's a social media and
[16:08] television and different things to
[16:10] manipulate the human being brother Matt
[16:13] Watkins at the retreat read an article
[16:15] that I'd like to send you a read from
[16:17] here I having a chance to send it to you
[16:19] yet but how that science has really come
[16:22] to that now that there are specific
[16:24] companies that are hired by Google and
[16:26] different ones and they admit clearly
[16:28] that the original gender this for
[16:31] advertising is to get to manipulate the
[16:34] human being to lean them a certain way
[16:35] to change their thoughts on something
[16:37] course to make them buy more things and
[16:39] so they know how you tick they know how
[16:41] you work in your mind or how you think
[16:44] they know much better than even you know
[16:46] it I guarantee you they have studied the
[16:48] human being now for hundreds of years
[16:50] and they know how you tick you know how
[16:52] that I don't know how you function and
[16:53] so now there's a clear agenda by Satan's
[16:56] tools in order to manipulate so my point
[16:59] this morning is that they have
[17:00] manipulated by TV and social media and
[17:03] have taught us the things that will give
[17:07] you real joy they have taught us the
[17:09] things to pursue that will bring you
[17:11] real happiness and so that's the type of
[17:15] world we live in that's that's that's I
[17:17] don't have to say much about that
[17:19] because you're so aware because we've
[17:21] been so taught and it's been so planted
[17:23] in our minds if you if you if watched
[17:26] television even when you're a kid most
[17:29] of the commercials if not all of them
[17:30] are meant of course to sell something
[17:32] but if you look at the majority of the
[17:34] commercials it's it's what the what
[17:36] they're putting out there and
[17:37] emphasizing most the time is what
[17:40] they're putting out this will make you
[17:41] happy this will make you joyful
[17:43] this vacation spot so you see a scene of
[17:45] a vacation spot you see a scene of cars
[17:48] new cars because that's that there's
[17:50] more commercials on cars than anything
[17:52] else they throw this out there throw
[17:54] that now they throw medicines out there
[17:56] because this is your answer to it this
[17:58] is your answer to being relieved of your
[18:00] sickness whatever it is so everything is
[18:03] to put out there is that you will be
[18:04] content you will be happy this is what
[18:06] you need to pursue to order to be happy
[18:09] so now we we're now years being filled
[18:12] with this stuff and even as believers
[18:14] you can't get around it it's around us
[18:16] all the time I just asked you to be
[18:18] careful as a believer that we don't buy
[18:19] into this whole cycle can you say man I
[18:22] don't think we need to have guards over
[18:25] our minds can you say man
[18:26] because the teaching gets into us and
[18:28] causes us to reach out for things to get
[18:31] joy out of and for a believer who has
[18:34] the Holy Ghost he gets burned every time
[18:36] because he finds emptiness in anything
[18:39] other than the presence of God in his
[18:40] word
[18:42] praise the Lord so we people will go
[18:45] through those cycles even though they've
[18:46] been hearing preachers talk about it and
[18:48] tell them about it for years they'll
[18:49] keep you know getting burnt by it until
[18:51] they have to realize you have to feed
[18:53] your soul the Word of God the Holy Ghost
[18:55] only feeds on the Word of God and you
[18:58] draw your true joy and I'm talking about
[19:00] true joy this morning there are
[19:02] of life there are natural joys of life I
[19:04] enjoy my family I enjoy being with them
[19:07] I enjoy my children someday hopefully
[19:10] I'll enjoy grandchildren hint hint
[19:14] you know you know I there are things
[19:17] that I enjoy doing you're saying I'm not
[19:19] gonna take time to meet others the
[19:20] things in life that I enjoy doing some
[19:22] of your brothers enjoy hunting but the
[19:23] brand enjoy hunting so I don't enjoy
[19:25] hunting but some of you enjoy it and and
[19:28] then I enjoy the benefit when you kill a
[19:30] deer and give it to me every way I can
[19:33] kill a deers run over it and I still
[19:35] don't know how to deal with it when I
[19:36] run over it I'm not what to do you know
[19:38] see what's blood but we have natural
[19:40] joys of life and there's not a thing
[19:42] wrong for us to enjoy those things can
[19:44] you say Matt then we have the world's
[19:46] offers for joys to run after things and
[19:49] so we've got to navigate through all
[19:50] this and say lord help us because the
[19:53] tendency is even for believers to start
[19:56] slowing you don't even recognize when
[19:57] you're getting off track where you're
[19:59] starting your joint you to take your the
[20:03] fullness of your joy or the your
[20:05] contentment you lean towards family and
[20:09] is there something wrong with that
[20:11] there's not anything wrong with it
[20:12] except for if it takes you away from the
[20:15] word and it takes you away from God's
[20:17] places where he gives us joy so you said
[20:21] you say well I haven't done that or
[20:23] maybe I'm doing that now don't make me
[20:24] feel bad about I'm not trying to make
[20:25] you feel bad I'm saying as if you're a
[20:27] believer you have to be on your toes
[20:29] because we don't we unconsciously we
[20:31] don't catch it sometimes when we're
[20:33] slowly turning towards something that
[20:35] we're drawing peace out of and
[20:37] contentment out of and all of a sudden
[20:39] at the end of it it brings emptiness if
[20:41] you draw your joy out of what people say
[20:43] about you and everybody has to like you
[20:45] or how many lights you get on social
[20:47] media you're going to be a depressed
[20:48] person eventually on depression medicine
[20:51] and there's hundreds of cases it says
[20:53] everybody's on depression now because
[20:55] they draw their source of joy of how
[20:58] many likes they get and I'm not only
[21:03] saying that we're not called to be a
[21:05] statistic we're not called to buy into
[21:09] this can you say man and possessions and
[21:12] and new clothes and new cars and
[21:16] women the pressure and women to to dress
[21:20] in a way just sexy enough for a man to
[21:22] notice you I don't want to commit
[21:24] adultery with them but I want men to
[21:26] notice me so you dress just sexy enough
[21:28] and you draw your comfort and joy from
[21:30] that you jaw draw your your joy out of
[21:33] that I'm just mentioning some things our
[21:35] joy often depends if enough people like
[21:38] us how many likes we get if we can get
[21:42] what we want in life then it makes us
[21:44] happy and a lot of the new generation to
[21:45] get what they want they they are happy
[21:48] if our team if our basketball team our
[21:52] football team makes the playoffs that
[21:53] brings a joy to people they're making
[21:55] the playoffs is to make a championship
[21:57] and beat it boy that really brings the
[21:59] joy and I'm amazed at how many
[22:01] Christians and how they act when they're
[22:04] supporting and joyful over their team
[22:06] that's winning because I'm gonna say
[22:10] that I cannot believe that that much
[22:13] emotion comes out of a person who sits
[22:16] like a bump on the log when the presence
[22:19] of the Lord is speaking revelation of
[22:22] the word there's something wrong with
[22:26] that picture
[22:27] praise the Lord amen Wow where's this
[22:32] coming from
[22:33] I didn't know they had joy they got joy
[22:35] over their team they're going crazy and
[22:38] I'm not necessarily condemning you for
[22:41] that I'm only saying there's an
[22:42] imbalance because they're your life is
[22:44] centered around looking to the
[22:46] expectation of what your team does and
[22:49] there's not much expectation for when
[22:51] the next service is coming up or when
[22:52] you're gonna read your Bible the next
[22:54] morning you're not might not even read
[22:55] your Bible but your expectations what
[22:57] can the Lord show me today and your
[22:59] hearts well with joy with what he showed
[23:00] you where is it at and I'm just saying
[23:03] when we get off track we've got to be
[23:05] the one to say now wait a minute I'm not
[23:06] a statistic I'm not like this world I
[23:09] want to draw my joy from the joy of the
[23:11] Lord because the joy of the Lord is my
[23:14] strength the rest brings weakness can
[23:17] you say Amen praise the Lord possessions
[23:20] all these other things a new album from
[23:22] your favorite group is coming out and
[23:24] new movies coming out missing the
[23:26] worldly things the new updated grand
[23:28] theft or for tonight
[23:33] obsession obsession the thing that
[23:37] churns they announced it Apple announced
[23:41] the new iPhone glory and and so it's for
[23:53] the world now and hopefully not us we
[23:55] become basically robots and they're
[23:58] putting the carrot out in front of the
[23:59] stick because we've already ended this
[24:02] story we've already played all this
[24:03] fortnight and so the only thing to keep
[24:05] us going is to put a carrot out there so
[24:07] that we can look forward to the next joy
[24:09] that's coming I want to say I don't
[24:11] think we should live that way and I've
[24:14] just died especially when it says the
[24:17] days of Noah when it promotes the worst
[24:19] violence that you can promote how can a
[24:22] believer sit there and play that and not
[24:24] be affected by it they're all being
[24:26] affected by it and you're not I say
[24:28] y'all late at the altar and lay it down
[24:30] because in the days of Noah they become
[24:33] violent and there's a reason to become
[24:34] violent today we have helped to make us
[24:36] more violent and that Satanist teaches
[24:38] that violence is normal and eventually
[24:40] people have a violent spirit the next
[24:45] fortnight to have a spa and to get a new
[24:48] color on my toenails or my fingernails
[24:51] talk about joys of life or a new color
[24:53] in my hair almost all of mankind has
[24:58] been put on this cycle of this stuff for
[25:01] the last some 80 years and I say that
[25:03] because we've always had temptations but
[25:05] we've all that in the last 80 some years
[25:08] there's been a change in manipulating
[25:10] the human being and Satan knows it and
[25:12] he's manipulated me in the sense that
[25:14] he's taught them where they get their
[25:16] next joy and that's what to look forward
[25:19] to to make you happy and we become just
[25:22] numb robots who keep following in this
[25:25] running on this treadmill or keeping
[25:28] this cyclists stuff that what's the next
[25:30] thing in what's the next thing it's
[25:32] taught us to live like they live can you
[25:35] say men and so in this part by saying I
[25:38] don't think that these are the source of
[25:41] our joy as believers and
[25:43] shame on us if it becomes our complete
[25:46] social source of joy we are not called
[25:49] to be like them the holy ghost changes a
[25:55] person
[25:56] you may be in your flesh but the Holy
[25:59] Ghost takes over your flesh can I get an
[26:06] amen the Holy Ghost is meant to lead
[26:09] your life out of these things and find
[26:11] you sources of joy that are in the Lord
[26:15] praise the Lord brother Branham says
[26:17] what makes a man to get drunk it's a
[26:19] quote what makes a man get drunk what
[26:22] makes people want to act the way they do
[26:24] the world what would a person stay home
[26:26] on Wednesday night from a prayer meeting
[26:27] to watch a certain television program
[26:30] are these good questions what would they
[26:34] do that for is because there's something
[26:36] in them that desires to be satisfied
[26:37] they want there's a little place in a
[26:39] man's heart or a woman's heart and God
[26:41] made the place for himself how dare you
[26:42] try to make this take the things of the
[26:44] world and put in there where God made
[26:46] for himself to get to sit there God is
[26:48] our joy God is our pleasure God is our
[26:52] satisfaction that's where it belongs in
[26:54] here let God in and then the other
[26:56] things are so dead you don't even care
[26:59] nothing about them no more he says in
[27:02] the token and in him is the fullness in
[27:04] him as all the sufficiency that we have
[27:06] need of he is my pleasure he is my life
[27:08] he is my joy can you say mine he is more
[27:12] not no I don't have to put I don't have
[27:15] to puff on a cigarette to get some kind
[27:17] of relief I take the lily of the valley
[27:20] he is the opium he is the thing that
[27:23] makes me walk in the clouds I say praise
[27:27] the Lord
[27:28] it's the opioid epidemic and it's all
[27:32] tied to people looking for a relief from
[27:36] life epidemic in our area Toledo is one
[27:39] of the worse than that were in the world
[27:41] people dying every day from addiction of
[27:44] it and all it goes the same as the
[27:46] cigarette brother brems already said
[27:48] somebody's looking for satisfaction and
[27:51] he has a lily of the valley he is the
[27:54] opium praise the Lord
[27:55] the true
[27:56] people of God are caught up in another
[27:59] thing and the earthly is taking on the
[28:02] heavenly and that's why I'm bringing
[28:04] this down now that whatever is whatever
[28:06] brings heaven joy is the thing that
[28:08] brings us joy should be that way
[28:11] so so the the people of God now are
[28:14] moving into a place that they're caught
[28:16] up in to another thing and that's the
[28:17] kingdom of God because the earthly is
[28:20] taken on the heavenly the kingdom of God
[28:21] has come to us in spirit form it's not
[28:24] like we're waiting for the kingdom of
[28:25] God it has come to us the kingdom of God
[28:28] is his word the kingdom of God is his
[28:30] presence it has come to us it has
[28:32] returned to us in the last days so we
[28:34] have another kingdom that we have access
[28:37] to as believers and it's coming in our
[28:39] hearts and but we live in another
[28:40] kingdom of the world and so now we have
[28:43] the earthly is taking on the heavenly
[28:45] jesus said it when he said in his prayer
[28:46] thy kingdom come Thy will be done in
[28:50] earth can you quote it with me thy
[28:52] kingdom come Thy will be done where in
[28:56] earth as it is in heaven so there's only
[28:59] one group of people that have this
[29:01] desire to pull the kingdom of God into
[29:04] our world to pull whatever's there in
[29:09] that dimension into our world the order
[29:12] of it the joy of it everything that's in
[29:14] there thy kingdom come
[29:16] that will be done in earth as it is in
[29:19] heaven to the place he said I hope I
[29:22] worship now right here as if I was
[29:24] already in that other dimension and so
[29:27] the kingdom now where we're blending
[29:29] with that for the Millennium and because
[29:32] that's when the kingdom of seta is set
[29:33] up on earth that's when we have a
[29:35] thousand years of honeymoon on the earth
[29:37] and that's where the people of God
[29:38] become a kingdom people now so that
[29:41] there's an earth created for them that
[29:43] is a millennium with Christ a thousand
[29:46] year honeymoon with Christ but I just
[29:48] want to talk about that because we're
[29:50] we're coming into that blending now
[29:53] where the kingdom has come to us to make
[29:55] for us a millennium and so that whatever
[29:57] is in the heavenly dimension is coming
[30:00] into this dimension and the bride grabs
[30:03] a hold of it and she grabs a hold of
[30:06] this book because we're taking
[30:07] the book that Adam lost in the Guardian
[30:11] do you realize today that the book the
[30:14] book of redemption the book of the title
[30:16] deed to ownership of this earth which
[30:19] was in their hands of the original owner
[30:21] after Adam lost it it was in the hands
[30:24] of the Sun can you say men Adam and then
[30:27] because the fall Adam lost the title
[30:29] deed - that went back into the hands of
[30:31] the Regent but you know you realize that
[30:33] at the end time that book is back into
[30:36] the hands of our kinsmen and being
[30:38] placed back into the hands of sons again
[30:40] and that's not happening someday that's
[30:43] happening as we're preaching that's
[30:44] happening now that the book that Adam
[30:49] loss is being handed back and we're
[30:51] taking back all that Adam lost and in
[30:54] the future home message brother Brown
[30:55] says he said God is going to purge this
[30:58] earth by fire to get it ready for the
[31:01] Millennium can you say man but the same
[31:04] fire is purging us to get us ready for a
[31:09] millennium that's paraphrasing that's my
[31:12] own words there but that's the theme
[31:13] that he brings in future home is the
[31:15] same fire that it has to purge the stars
[31:18] because I don't want to live in this
[31:18] earth if it's not purged of all the
[31:20] atmospheres and all the sin and all the
[31:23] lust can you say man you want to hear a
[31:24] good service last Sunday why we were
[31:26] cyber Saints and we couldn't come here
[31:29] we listen to brother Donnie want to hear
[31:30] good service under millennium the best
[31:31] I've ever heard talks all about what
[31:33] it's going to be like to live in the
[31:34] millennium think about it a thousand
[31:36] years with no devil he's bound for a
[31:39] thousand years think about that's the
[31:42] way we're called to live in a place with
[31:44] no devil that's why we have problems
[31:46] that's why we have people sometimes in
[31:48] the church acting sometimes as I said in
[31:50] the song acting some ways that I'm going
[31:52] to the Lord's even in their life at all
[31:53] because they shouldn't be acting that
[31:55] way but you know what is it's not the
[31:56] brother it's the devil influencing that
[31:58] brother we're dealing with the devil
[32:00] that's the accuser of the Brethren
[32:02] that's always trying to cause divisions
[32:04] that's always being getting nasty with
[32:06] one another can you say man it's the
[32:07] devil can you say man and we have the
[32:09] power to cast them out now
[32:11] but one day we won't have to cast him
[32:13] out we'll live on earth without that
[32:15] influence they're never here the accuser
[32:17] of the Brethren again but you see now
[32:20] that fire that purges to get an earth
[32:22] that way is working on us now to purge
[32:25] out can you say man from everything
[32:28] that's not of God to purge our souls to
[32:30] purge our lives growing in the going and
[32:34] the things of the Lord to become a
[32:35] kingdom people and what's happening that
[32:38] other dimension is spilling over into
[32:40] our dimension or it should be and it
[32:43] should be affecting us and that means
[32:45] that what brings joy to him brings joy
[32:48] to us what brings joy to heaven brings
[32:50] joy to us or it should you say what
[32:53] about the joys of life things that we
[32:55] desire family and nice houses is that
[32:58] wrong no that's not wrong brother and
[32:59] sister that's the right thing but but
[33:02] the promise is now is that if we delight
[33:05] in the ways of the Lord and delight in
[33:07] the Lord
[33:09] here's how this works okay we have
[33:11] desires some of them are pure desires I
[33:15] want a better home or you know I want a
[33:18] grandchild or whatever it is there's not
[33:20] a thing wrong with that intent seems
[33:27] like the only couple things I can
[33:29] mention but there's a lot of other joys
[33:30] of life stuck a lot of other joys of
[33:35] life you shouldn't feel bad for enjoying
[33:37] them but here's the Hazara God has
[33:39] taught us where do you get your delight
[33:41] delight your ways in the Lord just get
[33:45] lost in the joy of the Lord and then
[33:48] when life fails you or life doesn't give
[33:50] up what you wanted or doesn't turn out
[33:53] the way and I mean raise your hand does
[33:55] life always turn out what you want no
[34:00] there's the marriage always turn out the
[34:02] way you wanted it no it doesn't that's
[34:06] the thing about life do you always get
[34:08] what you want no we get we get what we
[34:12] need can you say man Billy Graham say
[34:17] this morning I so enjoyed a message for
[34:20] him in a few words from him while he was
[34:21] good he's anointed
[34:24] he said God said he'd supply all of our
[34:26] needs not our Greed's amen but the way
[34:33] it works is that delight your ways in
[34:35] the Lord delight and take your Joy's
[34:38] from heaven take your Joy's from the
[34:40] Lord that is your joy and he says it a
[34:43] lot your ways Lord and he shall give you
[34:45] the desires of your heart
[34:46] so we're taught that we don't pursue the
[34:49] desires of our heart and neglect the
[34:52] joys of the Lord and neglect the word
[34:54] Lord and neglect that this relationship
[34:56] with the Lord we don't do it we don't
[34:58] pursue those things in in expense of our
[35:01] our walk with the Lord we never do that
[35:03] because it won't turn out right
[35:06] I said it's not going to turn out right
[35:11] it never turns out right when someone
[35:14] makes that choice but when we're lost
[35:17] just lost in the love of the Lord and
[35:20] lost everyday in his presence and just
[35:22] Lord ah I just love you and and when
[35:25] we're at that level of relationship man
[35:27] we're drawing our Joy's from him we tend
[35:29] to be able to handle the things of life
[35:31] a lot better can you say men but we're
[35:34] all about that then our emotions are
[35:36] like a roller coaster and they go up and
[35:39] down when somebody likes me everything's
[35:42] up the next day somebody doesn't were in
[35:46] depression again life dictates your joy
[35:50] I said I got some people just not
[35:54] queuing in with me a little bit this
[35:55] morning but I'm a messenger of the Lord
[35:57] to tell you the truth and I'm talking to
[36:00] you not the person next to you you
[36:05] better listen to what I'm saying because
[36:07] you do you draw your joy and neglect the
[36:10] greatest joys of heaven and great you
[36:12] really neglect what you know is to find
[36:14] most of you know it and experience the
[36:16] joy of the Lord but with it but when
[36:18] life starts to dictate to you and to
[36:21] misdirect you to drawing it out a family
[36:24] or drawing out of this and it's all
[36:25] about that then something's going to
[36:27] happen and you're gonna feel whether
[36:30] it's a week down the road or two years
[36:33] down the road you're gonna pay for that
[36:34] some way because you're not called to
[36:36] let that be the emphasis
[36:37] now light your ways in the Lord and
[36:39] he'll give you the desires of your heart
[36:42] can you say man praise the Lord I was
[36:53] thinking of sister Rebecca read me that
[36:56] I was just thinking of giving us a
[36:58] little rebuke here this morning and I
[37:01] was thinking of John and Caressa given
[37:02] Caleb their rebuke and they put it on
[37:05] and said that help me out his response
[37:11] was so good what yeah but would they
[37:15] tell him to do I said to pick up his
[37:20] toys he says I choose taking a timeout
[37:29] these kids are smart these days
[37:31] negotiate oh boy I love it
[37:39] and so I'm trying to preach you this
[37:41] morning maybe you want to take a timeout
[37:42] in steady and give you a choice of what
[37:44] you want but I'm the one in the pulpit
[37:46] so you don't get a choice here so our
[37:50] delight is in the Lord what brings
[37:51] heaven joy first thing in our text now
[37:53] I'm gonna take a few scriptures very
[37:55] quickly now because we don't want to
[37:56] take too much time but I want you to
[37:59] learn what the scripture says brings us
[38:01] joy as Christians we learn enough of
[38:04] what the world says brings you joy but
[38:06] we want to know what brings the
[38:08] Christian joy where's our source of joy
[38:10] and and then we look at what happens
[38:13] heaven joy and rejoicing and when that
[38:15] brings joy and rejoicing on the other
[38:17] side it should affect us the same way so
[38:19] the first place is mentioned in our text
[38:21] in Luke chapter 15 where we realize that
[38:24] a sinner coming back to repentance
[38:26] brings a such a rejoicing on the other
[38:29] side one sinner that gives a true
[38:32] repentance before God all the angels of
[38:35] God and all of heaven is having a great
[38:38] time of rejoicing now that's the Bible
[38:39] can you say man that is the truth that's
[38:41] not just a story and although we can't
[38:43] see it I'm telling you when there's true
[38:45] repentance out of someone who comes from
[38:48] a heart says I've got to repent before
[38:50] God
[38:51] and you see sometimes the tears and you
[38:53] see the brokenness and say god I need
[38:55] you I'm a center I give it all to you
[38:57] I'm a sinner I'm coming to give it all
[39:00] to you I want to say there's a rejoicing
[39:02] that goes on in the other side praise be
[39:05] to God
[39:06] now notice now it's true repentance it's
[39:08] not a it's not a dry eyed and B Kanaka
[39:10] thing that we made it a formula
[39:12] sometimes in churches right now just
[39:14] confess Jesus and shake the preachers
[39:16] hand there's no repented heart there but
[39:18] we're talking about a real repented
[39:20] heart and says I'm finished I give up
[39:22] Lord I'm letting you take over my life I
[39:24] repent of what I've done
[39:25] how many can raise your hand and some
[39:27] here at a camp or sometime in your life
[39:29] you hit that point it was all over it
[39:32] was done I'm giving it all to God praise
[39:35] be to God that's when heaven rejoiced
[39:37] over your life if there's a point in
[39:40] your life that you said that's it I'm
[39:42] finished I'm not gonna fight for my own
[39:44] way I'm giving it all to God I repent
[39:46] before him and I'm telling you that's
[39:47] what he's looking for it's not that you
[39:49] have a whole head knowledge of the
[39:50] message he's looking for true repentance
[39:53] because if there's true repentance he'll
[39:56] show you all the message today even in
[39:59] the message we've become so mechanical
[40:01] that as long as you can understand the
[40:03] seals and as long as you can go to a
[40:05] message church and as long as that
[40:06] church is just preaching all the
[40:08] mysteries and you're dazzled by it
[40:09] everybody's okay if they're attending
[40:12] that message Church and I'm here to tell
[40:13] you if there's no repentance even in the
[40:16] believers you don't have anything to
[40:19] work off of for lives to be changed amen
[40:25] you don't have anything to orga so now
[40:27] that's the one you first came to the
[40:29] Lord you ought to rejoice in that
[40:30] because having to rejoice I want to tell
[40:32] you repentance doesn't end then because
[40:38] they said in the later cease labor scene
[40:39] H be zealous therefore and repent so the
[40:44] way where's Ella for the Lord is that
[40:45] there's repentance sincere repentance
[40:47] going on all the time now raise your
[40:49] hand and say I
[40:50] I still need repentance in my life this
[40:53] group they they remove repentance from
[40:56] their life going to church going to the
[40:58] synagogue and they had removed I don't
[41:00] need to repent to that brother I don't
[41:02] need to repent to God for that I've
[41:04] reached a place they have no need of
[41:06] repentance please don't ever reach that
[41:08] place in your life stay tender before
[41:11] the Lord if you do something wrong make
[41:13] it right right away whether it's God or
[41:15] a brother or sister make it right right
[41:17] away hold a grudge for years my brother
[41:20] and sister don't hold that grudge for
[41:21] years take it to the cross and repent to
[41:24] that brother
[41:24] if you've lost repentance you get numb
[41:27] can you say Amen and the heavens not
[41:29] rejoicing over your life heaven is not
[41:33] rejoicing if you've lost your ability to
[41:37] repent some weren't listening so I'm
[41:40] going to say it again heaven is not
[41:43] rejoicing over your life if you've lost
[41:45] the ability to sincerely repent let me
[41:51] say it this way based on the text we
[41:54] read there is no true joy in your life
[41:57] if you've lost the ability to sincerely
[42:01] repent you don't have true joy Dossett
[42:07] II to tell me that
[42:08] I was happy yesterday and I was happy
[42:10] about this night I was just I was
[42:12] laughing about this joke and I said I'm
[42:14] here to tell you you don't have true joy
[42:15] if you've lost repentance in your life
[42:18] because what I'm preaching is true joy
[42:20] not temporary not worldly joy not just
[42:24] from a family I'm talking about heavens
[42:27] joy in your heart and you don't have it
[42:30] if you don't know how to repent there's
[42:34] no way he's amazing how the kingdom of
[42:35] God works or something so sincere and
[42:38] sorrowful that it breaks somebody up and
[42:40] there's tears at the altar of God I'm
[42:42] broken I've done wrong forgive me Lord
[42:45] or to a brother brother I did did you
[42:48] wrong I said I did the wrong thing
[42:50] please forgive me I asked you to forgive
[42:52] me in a brokenness it isn't amazing that
[42:55] something so confrontational and
[42:57] something so hard to do brings the joy
[43:00] of heaven it's the way the kingdom works
[43:06] I want you to notice that the lost sheep
[43:10] they are the predestined predestinated
[43:12] sheep already they're already sheep it's
[43:15] a lost sheep so we've got to look at
[43:18] this parable right that they are the
[43:20] predestinated sheep already they're
[43:22] called a sheep already so they're the
[43:25] predestinated ones that haven't come to
[43:26] true repentance yet sometimes I wonder
[43:28] if we've got people sitting in message
[43:30] churches and their predestinated seed
[43:31] but they haven't repented yet heaven
[43:34] doesn't rejoice until you repent is
[43:36] anybody listening to me this morning
[43:37] heaven does not rejoice over your life
[43:40] until you've come to a true sincere
[43:41] repentance so it's not just a sinner
[43:46] coming Lord it's a sinner who needs and
[43:48] does truly repent in their heart this is
[43:49] the cause for joy and I'll tell you
[43:51] since I've read this and since I've
[43:54] looked at this a little closer I've come
[43:58] to the place in my life that when I was
[44:00] reading this last few weeks that I know
[44:02] what makes something swell within my
[44:05] heart and I was really happy to to
[44:08] acknowledge this because when I really
[44:10] realized I said that's what heaven
[44:11] rejoices over I was reading this about
[44:13] two or three months ago for the first
[44:14] time and I said notice the word
[44:17] repentance in there and the other ones
[44:18] the lack of repentance but notice it's
[44:20] not just the sinner comes back but the
[44:25] sinner sincerely repents I said Lord
[44:28] that's what makes you rejoice is true
[44:31] repentance you can have a church you can
[44:36] have a message Church I can preach a
[44:38] sermon I can preach the mysteries to
[44:41] dowser you you can come and pay your
[44:44] tithes god bless you for doing that but
[44:48] if we go and come and there's no
[44:50] repentance we don't really have a church
[44:53] I don't think there's enough repentance
[44:59] that goes on in the message in our
[45:01] message ranks because we've developed a
[45:03] pride I didn't expect to say these
[45:05] things this morning but I'm saying them
[45:07] for all of us message churches develop a
[45:10] pride that as long as we get together
[45:12] and speak about the seals and all the
[45:13] mysteries and we've had church and we
[45:15] clock in and clock out that we're going
[45:17] to make the rapture and I'm here to say
[45:19] there's enough scriptures to show
[45:20] unless there's an atmosphere of true
[45:22] repentance on our hearts the word is
[45:24] doing us no good because it's the only
[45:29] thing God has to work off of a tender
[45:32] broken heart he says that Isaiah 66 he
[45:36] says heaven is my throne and earth is my
[45:39] footstool - what man shall you look he
[45:41] says all these things that my handmaids
[45:43] to this man will I look not to him that
[45:46] brings sacrifices not to him that he
[45:48] that slew the Sioux an ox is if he slew
[45:51] a man and he goes into all the
[45:53] sacrifices Israel makes and he says
[45:55] there they don't mean anything this is
[45:56] the kind of man I'm looking for to him
[45:58] that is broken out of a contrite spirit
[46:00] and that tremble with that my word he
[46:03] pointed to the man that he needs don't
[46:05] make up you see us men we judge
[46:08] ourselves before our family and before
[46:12] God we and this is in our nature so I'm
[46:14] not knocking it we tend to judge
[46:15] ourselves and qualify ourselves and
[46:18] praise ourselves based upon the
[46:21] sacrifices that we the measure of a man
[46:23] is the sacrifices he's making for his
[46:25] family and that's Christ like Christ our
[46:28] kinsman went to Calvary he made a
[46:29] sacrifice I'm not doing away from the
[46:31] fact that a man should make sacrifices
[46:33] to feed his family to work every day in
[46:35] the cold or not in the cold but their
[46:36] feet offend you that's something of God
[46:39] in you - but he's showing in Isaiah 66
[46:41] it's not just that we make sacrifices
[46:43] because us men will tend to say to
[46:46] someone who's criticizing us maybe even
[46:48] our wife sometimes will tend to remind
[46:51] the wife of all the sacrifices were
[46:54] making for the family she's trying to
[46:56] bring up something about your character
[46:58] something that you'd said wrong or
[47:01] something like that and and we said okay
[47:04] my wife is measuring me my children my
[47:06] family or somebodies measuring my my
[47:08] manhood and my status as a godly man so
[47:12] they're measured it by this corner over
[47:13] here and then we jump to we're gonna
[47:16] give a list of all the sacrifices were
[47:18] making what are you talking about I'm
[47:22] working my finger to the bone here I'm
[47:25] out in the cold she goes to your list
[47:28] all right to bring food on this table
[47:33] why are you even criticizing me look
[47:36] what I'm doing to bring food on this day
[47:37] but all these you know statements that
[47:39] men have made through generations
[47:40] because we're judging ourselves by our
[47:43] sacrifice but he says in Isaiah - this
[47:48] man will I look not just to make
[47:50] sacrifices a matter of fact the
[47:51] sacrifice doesn't mean anything if you
[47:53] don't have a gentle broken heart one of
[47:56] my prayers the last couple years more
[47:58] than anything else - lords to make me
[47:59] more gentle true gentleness can you say
[48:04] amen amen I was pretty transparent right
[48:08] there with you we're supposed to be
[48:11] gentlemen make me gentle maybe gentle
[48:15] amen some of you what I said that you're
[48:19] thinking you heart yes lord please me
[48:23] yes I'm so glad he's praying that
[48:26] because I've been praying for him for
[48:28] years for that issue well good it's
[48:32] finally getting through your prayers are
[48:35] reaching heaven Lord make me more gentle
[48:39] Lord give me a broken spirit if I can't
[48:42] cry anymore be moved by the president of
[48:44] God something is wrong if I can't cry
[48:47] and repent and say the words please
[48:48] forgive me I'm sorry sincerely I'm
[48:51] reaching a place I don't care how much
[48:52] message I learn I don't care if I can
[48:55] preach it like an angel if I lose my
[48:58] brokenness I've lost everything I don't
[49:01] care how much you know this Bible can
[49:03] quote it to me I'm preaching to you this
[49:04] morning I don't care you can quote
[49:06] quotes our brother branham and study
[49:07] everything quote this Bible if there's
[49:09] no brokenness in your spirit God cannot
[49:12] deal with you praise the Lord so I'm
[49:21] going to read some other scriptures
[49:22] quickly now here if you would read with
[49:24] me and we're going to find if you're
[49:25] interested the sources of joy now if you
[49:27] would turn quickly with me to Matthew
[49:30] chapter 5 and verse 12 we check and
[49:36] check in the time of 1228 so we're doing
[49:39] good Matthew chapter 5 and verse 12
[49:47] so what some other sources of sources of
[49:50] joy for a believer Matthew chapter 5 and
[49:53] verse and pick it up here in verse 11
[49:59] blessed are the ye when no verse 10
[50:03] blessed are they which are persecuted
[50:05] for righteousness sake now this is the
[50:07] reading of persecuted for righteousness
[50:08] sake for theirs is the kingdom heaven
[50:10] blessed are ye when men shall revile you
[50:12] and persecute you and shall say all
[50:15] manner of evil against you falsely if it
[50:20] says that in the scripture then that's
[50:22] going to happen to our lives people
[50:24] sometimes don't want this but if you're
[50:26] gonna live a godly life you're going to
[50:28] receive persecution you're going to
[50:30] receive people saying evil things about
[50:32] you you have to get used to it and we
[50:35] have to know how to bring it to the Lord
[50:36] or it affect us so we have to realize we
[50:38] be persecuted they'll say all manner of
[50:41] evil against you falsely for my name's
[50:44] sake this one it says the new verse 12
[50:45] rejoice and be exceeding glad for great
[50:49] is your reward in heaven for so
[50:51] persecuted they the prophets which were
[50:53] before you if you're holding to the same
[50:55] word that the prophets preached they
[50:57] were persecuted
[50:58] now you're persecuted I always like to
[51:00] say it shows what team you're on
[51:02] it shows what side you're on and so you
[51:04] should rejoice I'm getting persecuted
[51:06] because of the word praise be to God
[51:10] does it seem like a reason to rejoice
[51:12] does it when you're talked about evil
[51:15] evilly against you the other reference
[51:19] in Luke - this says rejoice in that day
[51:21] and leap for joy now in my Christian
[51:26] experience I have never seen anybody
[51:30] leap for joy when they were persecuted
[51:37] when men reviled them and said all
[51:41] manner of evil against them falsely
[51:43] isn't it amazing I can say I've never
[51:46] seen a Christian leap I'd like to see it
[51:50] Jesus said to do it and I'd like to some
[51:52] said give somebody to give a big jump
[51:55] and a leap
[51:56] as soon as they're falsely accused of
[51:58] something isn't it funny
[52:02] we're laughing because Jesus said that's
[52:04] how we should respond to being
[52:07] persecuted go out there in the yard as
[52:11] soon as it's posted on the internet and
[52:14] jump over that fence and call me over
[52:19] because I want a picture of it to put on
[52:20] Facebook it'd be the first time ever
[52:24] somebody obeyed the scripture and how to
[52:27] deal with persecution see these people
[52:31] who said things about me and my family
[52:33] and my children and you're ready to go
[52:37] fight him any what Jesus said is that he
[52:43] says it's the time to rejoice and lift
[52:46] your hands say Lord they persecuted the
[52:49] prophets before us
[52:50] I know I've checked my heart and I
[52:52] believe that I've got everything under
[52:53] the blood and I don't believe in this
[52:55] incident that I contribute or did
[52:57] anything wrong if I did Lord help me but
[52:59] I don't believe I did and so now I'm
[53:01] being persecuted persecuted for
[53:02] something I didn't do
[53:03] glory be to God I give you praise and
[53:06] glory and honor and I'm gonna leap for
[53:08] joy all right next one Luke chapter 10
[53:23] Luke chapter 10 and verse 19 behold I
[53:30] give you power to tread on serpents and
[53:32] scorpions and over all the power of the
[53:33] enemy and nothing shall by any means
[53:35] hurt you
[53:35] Jesus commissioning the seventy here I
[53:38] give you power and tread on serpents and
[53:40] scorpions and over power of the enemy
[53:42] and nothing shall be any means hurt you
[53:43] not with sin notwithstanding in this
[53:46] rejoice not that the spirits are subject
[53:48] unto you but rather rejoice because your
[53:51] names are written in heaven here's the
[53:56] reason you rejoice and this is a good
[53:57] correction for Pentecostals who rejoice
[54:01] in the power that's been given them by
[54:03] God even sometimes message people
[54:06] they're rejoicing the power that they
[54:08] begin in Jesus that were not to rejoice
[54:10] in that that shouldn't be the source of
[54:13] my joy we had power over the enemy and I
[54:14] cast out three Devils this week and I
[54:16] did this and glory I'm a powerful son of
[54:18] God
[54:19] we shouldn't be rejoicing that let
[54:21] everybody else rejoice in that we
[54:22] rejoice in that our names are written in
[54:25] the book of life before the foundation
[54:29] of the world
[54:30] that should be a source of joy to us can
[54:32] you say Amen third John chapter one
[54:34] third John chapter one we're learning
[54:39] something today are we not we're
[54:42] learning something about what real joy
[54:44] but it comes to a Christian the source
[54:46] of real joy 3rd John chapter 1 the verse
[54:54] verse 3 frag rejoiced greatly when the
[54:58] Brethren came and testified of the truth
[55:00] that is in thee
[55:01] this is John's disciples here even as
[55:04] thou walkest in truth I have no greater
[55:07] joy than to hear that my children walk
[55:11] in truth now this is John and he's
[55:15] making a statement of all the joys of
[55:17] life and all the joys in the Lord I have
[55:20] no greater joy than to hear that my
[55:23] children in the gospel are walking in
[55:27] truth praise the Lord and if that gives
[55:30] them joy that should give us joy
[55:33] I'm so glad to hear that because it does
[55:35] even for your own children but but first
[55:38] of all it's for the children of God if I
[55:40] see a believer catching the word and
[55:42] latching onto it I don't care about
[55:44] their weaknesses and all these other
[55:46] things God will take care of that but I
[55:47] see him walking every week every day in
[55:50] truth brother part I didn't know that
[55:52] the Lord showed me that I'm walking in
[55:54] the word I get swelled up with joy with
[55:57] that and John said I have no greater joy
[56:00] than to see my children walking in truth
[56:02] and if you apply that to your own
[56:06] families as I've been preaching a little
[56:09] bit about it we should desire for our
[56:13] children when they come of age above all
[56:16] things that they receive the new birth
[56:20] the Holy Ghost I watch people work so
[56:26] hard to provide the very best for their
[56:29] children
[56:29] and there's not a thing in the world
[56:31] around but I'm I'm working I'm paying
[56:33] college bills are about to kill me it's
[56:36] good to do it it's good to try to help
[56:39] them but our greatest prayer is that
[56:42] they come to a new birth you can do
[56:48] everything else for your kids but I tell
[56:49] you you your you're gonna actually be
[56:51] somewhat disappointed in the end if
[56:54] they're just good people in life and
[56:57] didn't receive the Holy Ghost and I you
[57:03] know your kids are good my kids are good
[57:05] we're always gonna stand for our kids
[57:06] and they're good kids I believe they
[57:08] have a good heart I say that about my
[57:09] kids they do but a good heart and a good
[57:13] person is not all that they need can I
[57:17] get an amen so our prayer has to go
[57:19] deeper than there's just there good
[57:21] person don't you know just that they're
[57:23] doing good they're doing the best again
[57:24] yes praise the Lord but keep praying
[57:26] that they receive the new birth and so
[57:30] it says I have no greater joy to see my
[57:32] children walk in truth it doesn't mean I
[57:34] have no greater joy and see my children
[57:35] at church didn't say that
[57:40] I have no greater joy to see my kids
[57:42] show up at church I have no greater joy
[57:44] than to see my kid doing this that the
[57:48] other and giving to charity and and
[57:50] being participating good things no that
[57:52] can't be our greatest joy but to see
[57:54] them by the Holy Ghost walking in truth
[57:57] that gives joy so you keep praying until
[58:01] you see it in your kids don't you stop
[58:03] praying can you say Amen those that are
[58:05] art don't you stop praying don't stop
[58:08] praying we got to keep believing for our
[58:10] children we got to keep believing that
[58:14] they'll walking true someday that's a
[58:16] joy that I can participate in
[58:18] it's my possession can you say Matt oh
[58:21] quickly go with me over the book of
[58:23] James chapter one amen I'm looking at
[58:29] the sources of joy for a Christian maybe
[58:32] you would make this and say Lord I'm
[58:34] listing this in my heart just now God
[58:36] make these things my joy make that my
[58:38] prior Army primary joy in my life above
[58:40] all things make these things my joy this
[58:43] is what a Christian rejoiced at James
[58:45] chapter 1 and verse 2 James a servant of
[58:49] God
[58:51] verse 1 James a servant of God and the
[58:53] Lord Jesus Christ to the twelve tribes
[58:54] which are scattered abroad of greeting
[58:55] my brother and count it all joy when you
[58:59] fall into divers temptations not a lot
[59:02] of us rejoice in that not on all of us
[59:05] get joy out of that that's why it's
[59:08] strange to the world when we enter
[59:11] temptations and testings and trials they
[59:16] act a certain way but then they say
[59:18] Christians I'm gonna count it all joy
[59:20] praise the Lord in tempted being tested
[59:25] and being tried I feel it coming on I
[59:28] feel it thank you Lord count it all joy
[59:35] anybody want to raise your hand say this
[59:37] is hard to do brother Paul it's hard to
[59:39] do by the Holy Ghost we can do it
[59:42] because it's in the word counted all joy
[59:46] when you fall into divers today knowing
[59:48] this that the trying of your faith
[59:49] worketh patience but let patience have
[59:51] our perfect work that you may be perfect
[59:53] and entire
[59:54] and wanting nothing so it works to the
[59:56] good for us friends it's gonna make us
[59:58] perfect it's going to be perfect entire
[1:00:01] wanting nothing if any of you lack
[1:00:03] wisdom so it goes on to some other
[1:00:04] things let's move on to revelations
[1:00:06] chapter 12 I've got about three more
[1:00:09] here if you just give me patience
[1:00:11] revelations chapter 12 and says here
[1:00:19] back here in verse 9 and the Great
[1:00:23] Dragon was cast out that old serpent
[1:00:27] called the devil and Satan which
[1:00:29] deceiveth the whole world he was cast
[1:00:30] out into the earth and his angels were
[1:00:32] cast out with him and I heard a loud
[1:00:34] voice saying in heaven now is come
[1:00:35] salvation and strength and the Kingdom
[1:00:38] of our God and the power of his Christ
[1:00:41] for the accuser of our brethren is cast
[1:00:44] down which accused them before our God
[1:00:48] day and night so you notice what's
[1:00:50] happening here this is just before the
[1:00:51] rapture when heaven notices that the
[1:00:54] accuser Satan the accuser of the
[1:00:56] Brethren and all those who have gone in
[1:00:57] before has reached his day of being cast
[1:01:01] out and cast down and he's cast out of
[1:01:03] the heavenly atmosphere out of the
[1:01:05] atmosphere that he's in and so now that
[1:01:07] day comes and so there's there with a
[1:01:10] loud voice saying salvation is
[1:01:12] strengthened Kingdom of our God and the
[1:01:14] power of Christ it's come now because
[1:01:17] the accuser of our brothers cast down
[1:01:18] which accused them before our God day
[1:01:19] and night and they overcame by the blood
[1:01:22] of the Lamb and by the word of their
[1:01:23] testimony and they loved not their lives
[1:01:25] unto death so there we find there's a
[1:01:27] group that overcame him all these years
[1:01:29] of accusing day and night they battled
[1:01:33] the accuser of the Brethren and they won
[1:01:35] they overcame there's a group of people
[1:01:37] that overcome the accuser of the brother
[1:01:39] there's a group of people that caused
[1:01:41] him to be cast out and his day is over I
[1:01:44] want to be one of those therefore
[1:01:48] rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in
[1:01:51] them woe to the inhabiters of the earth
[1:01:53] of the sea for the devil has come down
[1:01:55] unto you having great wrath because he
[1:01:57] knoweth that he hath but a short time
[1:01:59] and that short time is three and a half
[1:02:01] years so he's cast out and he's cast
[1:02:04] into tribulation and the Bible saying
[1:02:07] woe unto
[1:02:07] them that are in habit of the earth in
[1:02:10] the sea when the devil comes down during
[1:02:12] that Tribulation
[1:02:12] he's got great wrath he's as angry as a
[1:02:15] beast has ever been before because he
[1:02:18] knows he only has a short time now to do
[1:02:20] what he needs to do but he's been cast
[1:02:22] out as the bride goes up the devil comes
[1:02:25] down he's cast out of the atmospheres of
[1:02:28] being able to whisper on ear the accuser
[1:02:30] of the Brethren that day is over and
[1:02:32] when it is heavens rejoice believers
[1:02:37] rejoice how he's looking forward to that
[1:02:39] day revelations chapter 18 and verse 16
[1:02:52] in saying alas alas that great city Rome
[1:02:56] that was clothed in fine linen and
[1:02:58] purple and scarlet and decked with gold
[1:02:59] and precious stones and pearls I was
[1:03:02] just there
[1:03:02] a few months ago this describes that
[1:03:06] city there's too many places in the
[1:03:07] scripture that points to that city the
[1:03:10] Roman Church and the Romans spirit with
[1:03:14] pagan Rome and papal Rome has been the
[1:03:16] same spirit when it passed from pagan
[1:03:18] Rome the papal Rome it's the same spirit
[1:03:20] behind it can you say man the Beast
[1:03:22] system to always come against the true
[1:03:25] Christians and the true power of God and
[1:03:27] the prophets of God she's guilty of the
[1:03:29] blood can you say man she shed blood of
[1:03:32] all those things too one day her hour is
[1:03:33] coming for in one hour so great riches
[1:03:35] has come to naught and every shipmaster
[1:03:37] and all the company and ships and
[1:03:39] sailors and many as trade by sea stood
[1:03:41] afar off and cried when they saw the
[1:03:43] smoke of her burning saying what city is
[1:03:45] like under this great city Rome what
[1:03:48] city is like this straight city what
[1:03:51] systems like that great system that
[1:03:52] Mother Church and they cast they cast
[1:03:57] dust on their heads and cried weeping
[1:03:59] and wailing saying alas alas that great
[1:04:01] city wherein were were made rich all
[1:04:03] that all had ships in the sea by reason
[1:04:05] of her costliness for in one hour is she
[1:04:08] made desolate in one hour
[1:04:10] God will drop an atomic bomb on that
[1:04:13] thing or allow a topping bomb and
[1:04:15] destroy all of that history that's there
[1:04:17] and all that it's ever done and why are
[1:04:20] the
[1:04:20] since looking and weeping about it
[1:04:22] because somehow she has become the
[1:04:25] center of the financial thing we have
[1:04:27] all sold out as the world to the one who
[1:04:31] has the Vatican millions the millions
[1:04:35] are at the Vatican and when we need to
[1:04:37] be bailed out someday the Vatican is
[1:04:39] going to bail everybody out but there
[1:04:41] come a cost with it the Antichrist
[1:04:45] so that'll go on and on and on until God
[1:04:49] says revenge on this city that's milk
[1:04:52] the people of their money that's
[1:04:53] deceived souls that you light a candle
[1:04:56] and you're okay
[1:04:57] Oh God have mercy there's a judgement
[1:05:01] coming to you and God's got a bomb with
[1:05:02] a name on it I'm gonna drop right on
[1:05:04] this city and the merchants oh look from
[1:05:05] ships and say oh my they're dreading it
[1:05:08] because that's the hub of all their
[1:05:10] financial systems now it's gone but when
[1:05:15] it happens look at this verse 20 rejoice
[1:05:17] over her thou heaven and ye holy
[1:05:19] apostles and prophets for God has two
[1:05:22] Vinge you on her heaven is rejoicing
[1:05:27] over this avenging of God finally over
[1:05:30] this system and this city who has
[1:05:33] deceived so many souls I know that don't
[1:05:36] sound good to the world but it's what
[1:05:38] the Bible says all of heaven and all the
[1:05:41] prophets and all the apostles because
[1:05:44] that system is what's caused all the
[1:05:47] spiritual issues through the years and
[1:05:51] all of heaven begins to rejoice I'm
[1:05:52] gonna be right there with them rejoicing
[1:05:54] I'm gonna bring joy whether I said
[1:05:56] praise God this is the thing that devil
[1:05:58] behind the system that's deceived
[1:06:00] millions of souls it's done it's
[1:06:03] finished
[1:06:03] God ends it and there's a rejoicing I'm
[1:06:06] gonna read one more place if you don't
[1:06:08] mind in revelations chapter 5 and this
[1:06:12] is cannot be overlooked because this has
[1:06:15] happened and is happening in our
[1:06:19] generation revelations chapter 5 you
[1:06:22] know it's when the book was there sealed
[1:06:25] up no one was worthy to get it but then
[1:06:27] all of a sudden verse 4 I wept much
[1:06:31] because no man was found worthy to open
[1:06:32] and read the book neither look there in
[1:06:34] the
[1:06:34] book of redemption the title deed their
[1:06:36] names in the book predestinated seat of
[1:06:39] God and one of the elders said weep not
[1:06:41] behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:06:42] the root of David hath prevailed to open
[1:06:44] the book and to loose the seven seals
[1:06:45] thereof and I beheld and lo in the midst
[1:06:48] of the throne and of the four beasts and
[1:06:50] in the midst of the elders stood a lamb
[1:06:51] as it been slain having seven horns and
[1:06:54] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[1:06:56] of God sent forth into all the earth and
[1:06:58] he came and took the book out of the
[1:07:01] right hand of him that sat upon the
[1:07:03] throne
[1:07:05] stop brother Branham comments that
[1:07:11] scripture and that happening of our
[1:07:13] kinsmen taking the book from the hands
[1:07:17] of the original owner and going to give
[1:07:19] it to his people taking back the
[1:07:21] possession that Adam lost that act was
[1:07:24] the mo he said the most sublime thing in
[1:07:26] the scripture the most sublime thing in
[1:07:31] the scripture because all creation was
[1:07:33] lost unless he come and took the book
[1:07:35] and if the only person to come and take
[1:07:37] the book it's because someone who was
[1:07:39] worthy all of us were unworthy all the
[1:07:41] prophets were unworthy no way was worthy
[1:07:43] only the Lamb was worthy if he didn't
[1:07:46] come and take that bill call and that's
[1:07:47] why he said John was weeping all the
[1:07:49] creation would be lost that's why John
[1:07:51] was weeping it's over I don't care all
[1:07:53] the gospel was preached for 2,000 years
[1:07:54] all that's been done all it's done done
[1:07:56] for the kingdom of God unless unless
[1:07:59] this act takes place of our kinsman
[1:08:01] redeemer who paid the price but not just
[1:08:04] paid the price he took the book of the
[1:08:07] title deed of redemption and he took it
[1:08:09] back into his hands and now is going to
[1:08:12] give it back to his people for Adam to
[1:08:14] be restored again the second Adam
[1:08:16] restoring all the all the bride back
[1:08:18] again when that act took place here's
[1:08:21] what took place when it that act took
[1:08:22] place and when he had taken the book the
[1:08:25] four beasts and four and twenty elders
[1:08:27] fell down before the lamb having every
[1:08:29] one of them harps and golden vials full
[1:08:31] of the odours which are the prayers of
[1:08:33] the saints so this obviously this is
[1:08:35] what Saints have been praying for all
[1:08:37] along this is the cry this is the burden
[1:08:39] when they died this is the prayers they
[1:08:42] set up before God unless our kinsman
[1:08:44] comes and takes us we are the possession
[1:08:47] of God unless he comes and takes that
[1:08:49] book and takes us his possession were
[1:08:52] lost they sung a new song saying thou it
[1:08:56] worthy to take the book and to open the
[1:08:58] seals thereof for thou was slain and has
[1:09:00] redeemed us to God by our blood by the
[1:09:02] blood out of every kindred tongue and
[1:09:05] people and nation and now it's made us
[1:09:07] kings and priests and we shall reign on
[1:09:09] earth and beheld I heard the voice of
[1:09:12] many angels round about the throne and
[1:09:13] the beasts and the elders and the number
[1:09:15] number of them was ten thousand times
[1:09:18] ten thousand thousands of thousands
[1:09:19] saying with a loud voice worthy is the
[1:09:21] Lamb that was slain to receive power and
[1:09:24] riches and wisdom and strength and honor
[1:09:26] and glory and blessing this is the
[1:09:28] rejoicing that's taken place in the
[1:09:31] other dimension when our kinsman takes
[1:09:33] the book there's loud voices they're
[1:09:39] shouting can you say man there's prayers
[1:09:42] going up this is the answer to prayer
[1:09:45] hallelujah there's a rejoicing going on
[1:09:48] to heaven and I've taught you this
[1:09:49] morning whatever they're rejoicing about
[1:09:51] is what we should be rejoicing about and
[1:09:55] some people haven't even read the seal
[1:09:57] book you're gonna tell me that that that
[1:10:00] that this act has taken place and that
[1:10:02] he took the book and he threw it I'm
[1:10:05] gonna read it in a minute you threw it
[1:10:06] to his prophet on earth and he spoke
[1:10:08] those things to seal it to unseal it to
[1:10:10] the people and this is what's happened
[1:10:12] in our generation and now we're looking
[1:10:15] for the tool full taking of the book
[1:10:17] because you're the book you're the words
[1:10:19] in the book you're the bride so there's
[1:10:21] a taking that's a taking to release the
[1:10:23] book of redemption but there's a taking
[1:10:24] the rapture where he comes and takes you
[1:10:26] back in a rapture people get all that
[1:10:29] confused and the taking and they say
[1:10:31] read they say that there's no blood on
[1:10:33] the mercy seat and all these other
[1:10:34] things don't get this all confused
[1:10:36] there's a taking of this book but you're
[1:10:38] the actually the literal book and he
[1:10:39] comes and takes you we're still waiting
[1:10:41] for that to happen every predestinated
[1:10:45] seed coming in and going in a rapture
[1:10:47] can you say man that might be deep for
[1:10:49] you this morning but praise be to God
[1:10:52] heaven is rejoicing because he's already
[1:10:54] taking the book
[1:10:57] hallelujah but then what happens to John
[1:10:59] the same thing I preached it the same
[1:11:01] rejoicing in heaven is happening in John
[1:11:04] when he says verse 13 every creature
[1:11:06] which is in heaven and on the earth and
[1:11:09] under the earth and such as are in the
[1:11:10] sea and all that are in them heard me
[1:11:13] shouting and saying blessed and honor
[1:11:16] and glory and power be unto him that
[1:11:18] sitteth upon the throne and unto the
[1:11:19] lamb forever and the four beasts said
[1:11:21] amen and the four and twenty elders fell
[1:11:23] down and worshiped him that liveth
[1:11:25] forever ever and ever John is being
[1:11:28] affected by the joy of this happening
[1:11:32] just like heaven is they sang a new song
[1:11:36] I'm going to read the way brother
[1:11:37] Branham said it they sung a new song
[1:11:38] saying doubt worthy to take the book and
[1:11:40] to open the seals thereof for thou was
[1:11:42] slain and has redeemed us to God by the
[1:11:45] blood out of every kindred tongue people
[1:11:47] a nation and now it's made under our God
[1:11:49] kings and priests and we shall ain't
[1:11:50] rain on the earth they wanted to come
[1:11:52] back and here they're going back to be
[1:11:55] kings and priests glory to God I feel
[1:11:58] good now listen friend someone tell you
[1:12:00] something you ought to listen and that's
[1:12:02] why I just mentioned to you ya people
[1:12:05] and I want to encourage you as a pastor
[1:12:07] if you just can I give you something to
[1:12:11] encourage you to do maybe you've already
[1:12:13] listened to it I want you to take in the
[1:12:16] next few weeks and I want you to listen
[1:12:17] to God the first two messages in the
[1:12:23] seals okay I want you to listen and I
[1:12:27] know I'm talking to people haven't even
[1:12:28] listened to the seals okay I don't know
[1:12:31] if it's too overwhelming or you'd have
[1:12:32] them take the time but I want all of you
[1:12:34] to take the time to do it I'm
[1:12:35] encouraging you not as a law or
[1:12:37] something but I want you to do it
[1:12:38] because this is an important thing that
[1:12:40] took place in our generation the Lamb
[1:12:44] not brother brand of the Lamb taking the
[1:12:47] book and revealing it so I want you to
[1:12:50] listen to God and simplicity because
[1:12:51] that's the only entrance he had to
[1:12:53] preach to entrance to come into the
[1:12:55] seals his preaching that throughout
[1:12:57] history when God did something major and
[1:13:01] came to the earth it's only ten ten to
[1:13:05] one so I'm really good on time
[1:13:07] I hold that opinion myself when when
[1:13:16] great events took place like when Jesus
[1:13:17] came in flesh and it's Christmas time we
[1:13:20] just had okay when the great events so
[1:13:22] now whenever he did it when it was a
[1:13:25] great event like that it was so simple
[1:13:28] the whole world missed it now we can't
[1:13:30] take that principle that has always been
[1:13:32] that with God in simplicity and say
[1:13:33] today it would be different when Christ
[1:13:35] comes when all this happens this great
[1:13:37] major deal if this Lamb taking the book
[1:13:39] it's going to be visible to all the
[1:13:40] Christians you gonna step out in a cloud
[1:13:42] it's gonna take the book no no no no no
[1:13:44] you know it's so this is why the
[1:13:46] entrance is to preach God in simplicity
[1:13:49] because God always revealed himself to
[1:13:52] the simple can you say man
[1:13:54] God always revealed himself to those who
[1:13:58] simply receive it revealed it to babes I
[1:14:01] thank thee father and I rejoice that
[1:14:03] you've hid these things from the wise
[1:14:05] and prudent what Jesus rejoice and say
[1:14:08] to the father I'm really happy that
[1:14:10] you've hid these things from the wise
[1:14:12] and prudent and revealed them to babes
[1:14:14] why is he happy about that because it's
[1:14:16] not based upon intellect it's not based
[1:14:20] upon IQ that the people have a higher IQ
[1:14:23] we'll catch this quicker than other ones
[1:14:25] you don't a lot of the book of Acts
[1:14:28] people couldn't even sign their own name
[1:14:29] they're not educated people
[1:14:31] it's Jesus is rejoicing I thank thee
[1:14:33] father because you've hid these things
[1:14:35] from the wise and prudent and revealed
[1:14:37] them to babes
[1:14:38] so God and simplicity was the only
[1:14:40] entrance is very significant he preaches
[1:14:41] that first I want you to listen to it
[1:14:43] because you as entering in those seals
[1:14:45] you can make things so complicated
[1:14:47] remember it's God in simplicity a humble
[1:14:49] heart looking at the word seeing what
[1:14:51] God is doing right now once you listen
[1:14:54] that I want you to listen to the next
[1:14:55] message which is the breech because this
[1:14:57] is where he comes to some of these
[1:14:58] comments I'm reading here in this whole
[1:15:00] transition of the breech where he comes
[1:15:02] the changes we've had seven church ages
[1:15:05] but now our lamb that went to Calvary
[1:15:07] 2,000 years ago our lamb how many knows
[1:15:10] our lamb Jesus Christ
[1:15:11] he died for our sins that was a great
[1:15:14] action 2,000 years ago we depend on that
[1:15:16] as him taking her sins but our lamb
[1:15:18] steps forward now after 2,000 years
[1:15:20] from the mediatorial work as being our
[1:15:23] high priest for 2,000 years he steps in
[1:15:25] another movement after 2,000 years our
[1:15:30] lamb steps in another movement and in
[1:15:32] and his movement is it's time at the end
[1:15:36] of the age to take back the title deed
[1:15:39] and the rights to this earth and the
[1:15:40] rights to redemption I've purchased them
[1:15:42] it's kind of like going into a pawn shop
[1:15:45] and paying the price for something to
[1:15:48] get them out of the pawn shop okay but
[1:15:50] you don't pick it up yet
[1:15:52] maybe you call and pay a credit card I'm
[1:15:53] paying the price I want to buy that back
[1:15:56] okay the price has been paid 2,000 years
[1:15:59] I'm coming to take my possession now can
[1:16:03] you say Matt that's a pretty huge thing
[1:16:05] and so now when that act takes place the
[1:16:09] first part of that is our lamb with that
[1:16:13] comes forward and he takes this book of
[1:16:16] redemption from the hands of the
[1:16:17] original order in symbolic form now okay
[1:16:19] you don't want to make two gods there
[1:16:21] the God the Father God the Son Holy
[1:16:23] Ghost no no it's in symbolic it's in a
[1:16:25] vision it's a symbol parable form and
[1:16:27] said our lamb steps forward because no
[1:16:29] one was found worthy to take back this
[1:16:31] book and give it back to the people
[1:16:32] again here this is happening in our
[1:16:35] generation and it's the most sublime
[1:16:40] thing in the scripture all heaven begins
[1:16:43] to rejoice John begins to rejoice and
[1:16:47] this is the way brother Brahim says I'm
[1:16:49] closing here in a minute I know I know
[1:16:51] where I'm at here in time when brother
[1:16:54] here's what I want you to listen to it
[1:16:56] because while he's preaching these
[1:16:57] things if you don't get excited about
[1:17:00] the atmosphere when he's talking about
[1:17:02] this is happening now you're just dead
[1:17:05] if you don't get excited
[1:17:06] because you could feel the anointing
[1:17:08] over that tape and things become
[1:17:11] explosive not because of a feeling
[1:17:14] worked up by the people or by some
[1:17:17] emotion it's the stimulation of
[1:17:19] Revelation of what's taking place right
[1:17:21] now heavens rejoicing and the Saints
[1:17:24] begin to really rejoice I'd like you to
[1:17:26] listen would you how many could do that
[1:17:28] and then maybe that'll encourage you to
[1:17:31] go on and listen to the rest of it I
[1:17:33] think you should
[1:17:34] to some to some leaders in the message
[1:17:36] they be very happy this morning that I'm
[1:17:39] telling you to go listen to the tapes
[1:17:41] and and write in the push play thing
[1:17:45] mode hear and obey
[1:17:46] I encourage you you know if there's a
[1:17:52] criticism that we don't push play over
[1:17:54] the pulpit very often just play the
[1:17:56] prophets voice here you know what I
[1:17:58] can't stand the criticism to eliminate
[1:17:59] us preachers we're not even hardly a
[1:18:01] preacher if we don't put a tape recorder
[1:18:04] up here and play push play that's what
[1:18:06] we needed to do to be a church and yet
[1:18:08] for 30 years this year I'll celebrate 30
[1:18:10] years for the mark 30 years you guys
[1:18:12] were with us some for 30 years I've read
[1:18:16] these quotes that's about all I've read
[1:18:17] is these quotes of the message that's
[1:18:20] all I preached but no credibility
[1:18:23] because I didn't let him speak it every
[1:18:25] time through the prophets voice it's
[1:18:27] just it's not it's not okay let's leave
[1:18:31] it alone everything I preached is this
[1:18:35] message but the voice that has come
[1:18:40] through has come through my voice came
[1:18:46] through a seventh messenger but I'm the
[1:18:48] voice is coming through now and that but
[1:18:51] yet I encourage you to listen to the
[1:18:52] seventh Angelus was sure wonderful but
[1:18:55] you know the Lord rebuke me one day said
[1:18:57] but those people may not be listening as
[1:18:59] much as tapes as they should but are
[1:19:01] they receiving the truth are they
[1:19:03] receiving the message or preaching so
[1:19:06] the Lord rebuke me says if they're
[1:19:08] receiving the truth what what does it
[1:19:11] matter what vessel that comes through if
[1:19:13] they're a vessel of the Lord they're a
[1:19:15] living voice of the Lord and it is the
[1:19:18] truth and they receive it that's what
[1:19:20] God wants to bring to is that repentance
[1:19:22] does that okay with everybody I try not
[1:19:25] to say things about all that's going on
[1:19:26] but I tried to say it tactfully to say
[1:19:30] and I would only say the only the other
[1:19:33] thing I might do some time is that I'm
[1:19:35] gonna bring a tape recorder here and I'm
[1:19:38] going to push play and I'm going to play
[1:19:41] some specific things that the Prophet
[1:19:43] said
[1:19:46] and see if people will push play and
[1:19:49] obey that for example when he says when
[1:19:53] you make me Christ
[1:19:56] you make me Antichrist for example when
[1:20:01] he says are you the only one in the
[1:20:04] fivefold ministry are you the only one
[1:20:05] where's the bride's revival is it over
[1:20:08] now and oh no no no the bride's revival
[1:20:11] is going around right now
[1:20:11] it's a powerful prophets teachers
[1:20:14] evangelists the fivefold ministry the
[1:20:16] bride's gonna so I'm gonna push play and
[1:20:19] we're gonna obey that I'll do it I don't
[1:20:23] I don't mind but listen if you're gonna
[1:20:25] push it you better listen to what he
[1:20:27] says and let me just say this let me
[1:20:32] just say this if you were pushing and
[1:20:34] playing and really obeying what he said
[1:20:37] you would conclude that brother Branham
[1:20:39] says what you need is the Holy Ghost to
[1:20:41] make it in a rapture he never says if
[1:20:44] you just push play and obey that's all
[1:20:46] you have to do never says that that's a
[1:20:48] deception he preaches that the way to
[1:20:52] make a rapture is not just to push play
[1:20:55] no way he never uses those words you
[1:20:57] need the Holy Ghost to make a rapture
[1:21:00] so go ahead and push play but make sure
[1:21:03] you obey amen
[1:21:10] preachers just love to get in trouble
[1:21:12] don't they just love to find it you just
[1:21:14] had to say it didn't you had to go there
[1:21:17] look at this now glory to God I feel
[1:21:20] enough to speak in tongues brother brems
[1:21:21] says and the atmosphere just begins to
[1:21:24] grow look watch yes it seems like I hate
[1:21:26] I haven't got enough language I could
[1:21:28] praise him him with it I need one that I
[1:21:30] don't even know so now listen this and
[1:21:32] behold I heard the voice of many angels
