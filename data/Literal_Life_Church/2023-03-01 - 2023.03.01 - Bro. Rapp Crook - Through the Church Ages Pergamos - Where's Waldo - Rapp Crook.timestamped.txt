[0:00] The Book of Revelation chapter 2.
[0:05] we were sorry to miss last Wednesday but
[0:08] it sounded like from all the ice that
[0:10] fell up here that was a pretty good call
[0:13] to make
[0:14] so yep that's uh
[0:17] we just took a rain check and we're here
[0:19] tonight
[0:21] we'll just take her text from Revelation
[0:24] Chapter 2 and verse 12.
[0:27] and to the angel of the church in
[0:29] pergamus right these things Sati which
[0:32] hath the sharp sword with two edges and
[0:36] that's what we're going to take our our
[0:38] inspiration this evening let's just
[0:39] let's just pray
[0:41] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[0:43] goodness and your grace to us this
[0:44] evening thank you for the ability and
[0:46] the freedom Lord to gather here father I
[0:49] thank you for the the good atmosphere
[0:51] Lord that's been created Lord thank you
[0:53] for the privilege Lord to worship you
[0:55] that you've called us and we've been
[0:56] able to respond to you father
[0:58] Lord I pray that you continue to pull on
[1:00] our hearts tonight Lord both here and at
[1:03] home it might be listening father may
[1:05] your spirit be present with each one we
[1:07] pray in Jesus name amen
[1:10] you may be seated
[1:14] I was uh been wrestling with it with
[1:17] some some thoughts over the last week
[1:18] and quite how to present something and
[1:20] the thought came last evening
[1:22] um
[1:23] where's Waldo I can remember waiting in
[1:27] the dentist offices for the appointment
[1:29] and you're just looking you're pouring
[1:31] over books for the entire time trying to
[1:34] find where Waldo where Waldo is until
[1:37] anybody never do Waldo
[1:40] no never do Waldo my goodness my
[1:43] goodness well Waldo is the guy uh the
[1:46] lower at the left there and you got a
[1:48] book full of all these drawings you
[1:50] gotta find where Waldo is and there are
[1:52] different guys masquerading look-alikes
[1:54] of waldoor a sister of Waldo a cousin of
[1:57] Waldo all these different variations and
[1:59] I just got to thinking
[2:01] um I'll show you where Waldo is in a
[2:04] minute so we don't have to worry about
[2:04] that
[2:06] um this got to thinking one of the
[2:08] insights where the brand name opens in
[2:10] the church age book about the about the
[2:12] church ages is that there are two seed
[2:16] lines to a false Vine and to True Vine
[2:19] going throughout the scripture and even
[2:21] in the church today and Jesus says in
[2:24] the last days the two would be so close
[2:26] together it deceived the very elect if
[2:29] it were possible this got to thinking my
[2:31] as we're going through we're looking
[2:34] through the Bible where's the real Waldo
[2:36] there are lots of different ones who are
[2:37] masquerading as this is the work of God
[2:39] for now this is the Christ but where's
[2:42] the real one and that's just where we
[2:44] had our inspiration because you can go
[2:46] on every single page you're looking for
[2:48] Waldo again and uh it's easy to look
[2:51] back on previous Pages once he's been
[2:54] found or once your your daughter or son
[2:56] who's looked at the book many times you
[2:58] can my daughters they they've looked at
[3:01] these kinds of books and they could I
[3:02] mean they can find these guys really
[3:04] really fast they have the book memorized
[3:06] but once it comes your turn and where's
[3:09] Waldo now that's kind of the question
[3:12] for us is kind of like where is Christ
[3:14] now where is Christ working now because
[3:18] that's that's the key question you don't
[3:20] want to find out you know where he was
[3:22] on the previous page that's all well and
[3:24] good but where is he now and right now
[3:27] on this page he's right there and took a
[3:29] while to find him but uh but but he's
[3:32] there
[3:32] and if we look in Revelation Chapter 2
[3:36] we did last time
[3:37] but in verse 13
[3:40] um Christ writes to the Church of
[3:42] pergamus I Know Thy works and where you
[3:45] dwell even where Satan's seat is yet you
[3:49] hold fast my name have not denied my
[3:51] faith
[3:52] even in the days where an Antipas was my
[3:54] faithful martyr
[3:55] who was slain among you where Satan
[3:58] dwelleth and like kind of like we talked
[4:00] about a couple weeks ago
[4:03] Satan wasn't dwelling there in Perkins
[4:06] with these with these uh horns on his
[4:08] head in this in this forked tale he was
[4:11] masquerading
[4:13] as a church he'd been able to take over
[4:16] churches he had access to Christ's name
[4:18] he was able to issue edicts in Christ's
[4:21] name because through Constantine Satan
[4:23] had gained access had gained leadership
[4:25] of churches which permitted Satan he's
[4:28] like this this coup d'etat he was able
[4:31] to actually act in the name of God and
[4:35] even as Paul writes and I think second
[4:38] Thessalonians he's seated in the temple
[4:40] of God receiving worship as though he
[4:43] were God
[4:44] so in this age of perkamus
[4:47] it is a question Where is Waldo where is
[4:51] the real work of Christ because there is
[4:54] so much masquerade and going on and
[4:57] Satan has been able to to take over
[4:59] churches by a nicolaitanism where he's
[5:02] ruling the laity
[5:04] um and and and and they're not following
[5:06] the rule of the Holy Spirit at all and
[5:08] he's also been able to more subtly
[5:10] influence the churches through the
[5:13] doctrine of Balaam which we had looked
[5:15] at last time and as we've seen as we've
[5:18] talked through these uh through this
[5:19] series before as Christ introduces
[5:22] himself to each Church age he introduces
[5:25] himself as Christ but he highlights
[5:27] certain attributes
[5:29] and it's those attributes that are
[5:30] really going to be important for that
[5:33] age to overcome in that age and in this
[5:37] age when they're in in and and in
[5:39] progress when there's so much deception
[5:41] abounding where Balaam is saying hey
[5:43] we're all the same Anyway come worship
[5:46] with us it's all going to be great it'll
[5:48] be just fine it's really important to
[5:50] know where's Waldo where's the real work
[5:54] of Christ and Christ identifies himself
[5:56] at the very beginning
[5:58] these things saith he which hath the
[6:00] sharp sword with two edges he identifies
[6:03] himself from the get-go from the very
[6:05] beginning is I am the word
[6:09] and if you've got questions about what's
[6:10] right or what's wrong don't go by your
[6:13] feelings don't go by perceived blessings
[6:16] of things because that's how the
[6:18] doctrine of Balaam works and practice
[6:21] God's word is just advice you get a
[6:23] second opinion of good things follow
[6:25] from it then that's probably just fine
[6:27] that's how Balaam operated but you can
[6:29] find all kinds of examples in the Bible
[6:31] I just read one in my Bible class this
[6:34] morning
[6:35] jeroboam II he's an evil King yet Jonah
[6:39] the son of a midi he makes prophecies
[6:41] that that Israel is going to expand
[6:44] their border and under jeroboam II land
[6:47] is restored but the verse before so
[6:49] jeroboam the second is an evil King but
[6:52] the next verse says he's not doing it
[6:54] because of the evil King God's doing it
[6:56] because he's merciful to his people so
[6:58] sometimes when there are blessings it's
[7:01] not because of the leader it reflects on
[7:03] God's mercy not because of the
[7:05] righteousness of any individual
[7:07] so we can't look at good things
[7:09] happening is always being a sign of what
[7:11] God's blessing is because God identifies
[7:14] himself these things Sethi which has the
[7:17] sharp sword which with two edges look to
[7:19] the word as our Compass as our Plum line
[7:23] balam's guiding principles tripped
[7:25] Israel up they'll trip us up as well
[7:28] just kind of by way of review Bill pure
[7:30] means Lord of The Gap and if we find
[7:33] folks we can be looking for the
[7:34] loopholes what can what what what's
[7:36] what's just allowable what what can I
[7:38] get away with and still be okay
[7:41] but
[7:42] he's the lord of the loophole too and
[7:45] eventually another loophole just becomes
[7:47] a noose and that can lead to our own
[7:51] spiritual death
[7:52] teaching of balaams is basically The end
[7:55] justifies the means as long as numbers
[7:58] of whatever metric is being followed as
[8:00] long as numbers are increasing no reason
[8:03] to look closely at methods but methods
[8:05] have a way of subverting the end
[8:07] eventually and that's still the case
[8:09] today so we don't look at any other
[8:12] method we don't look at uh brother
[8:13] Branham says the beauty of the church is
[8:16] the character of the people not the
[8:18] number of the people not the size of the
[8:20] building but the character of the people
[8:22] the how close we're walking with God
[8:24] that is the only metric that God cares
[8:27] about
[8:30] the teaching of Balaam says Hey the
[8:32] permissive will is fine
[8:34] it's it's the permissive will God's
[8:36] letting it happen it's going to make a
[8:38] way for his perfect will all things work
[8:41] together for good so God just to happily
[8:43] ever after kind of God that's a false
[8:46] Balaam there that's not the real Waldo
[8:48] that's the false Waldo we don't go that
[8:50] way because it's going to go it's going
[8:54] to lead to bad results
[8:56] for certain and I just like this on the
[8:59] bottom of page one this this idea of the
[9:02] permissive will being acceptable for us
[9:05] that that's that can get in our minds
[9:08] very easily and I just want to look what
[9:10] what Mordecai says to Esther
[9:13] if you hold your peace at this time
[9:15] Esther had a choice if you hold your
[9:19] peace at this time enlargement and
[9:21] deliverance will come from another way
[9:22] you hold your peace God's perfect will
[9:25] delivering the Jews will still be
[9:27] accomplished but your role in it can be
[9:30] changed
[9:31] so the permissive will makes a way for
[9:33] the perfect will in the sense that God's
[9:34] perfect will will still be accomplished
[9:36] but don't play around with the
[9:38] permissible thinking it's all going to
[9:40] work out well in the end anyway because
[9:42] that is tempting God
[9:44] but what um what I want to kind of look
[9:47] at um look further on today is we're
[9:50] kind of transition making a transition
[9:52] between the the Perkins age and the thy
[9:55] attire and age
[9:57] um and brother Branham talks about how
[9:58] the deeds and the doctrines of the
[10:00] Nicolaitans the doctrine of Balaam both
[10:03] of those are focused on In this passage
[10:05] we look at this evening but they lead up
[10:08] to the teaching of this false prophetess
[10:10] Jezebel that's who sits them thrown in
[10:12] the next Church age
[10:14] he says they are not three different
[10:16] Spirits or three different spiritual
[10:18] principles he says the these three are
[10:21] about the various manifestations of The
[10:24] Same Spirit as it goes from depth to
[10:27] depth it is just the Antichrist Spirit
[10:30] of organization
[10:32] in its three various stages
[10:35] and at the top of page two
[10:39] brother Branham continues here I didn't
[10:40] put the whole quote on here it says a
[10:43] ritual
[10:43] and ceremony was given an increasing
[10:46] part in worship and soon this whole
[10:49] system was a militant and diabolical
[10:51] power that did its best to control all
[10:53] through the persuasion of discourse or
[10:56] literal Force
[10:57] it received its energy from its own
[10:59] false prophecies and not the word of God
[11:02] it was now absolutely Antichrist though
[11:05] it came in Christ's name
[11:08] because Satan had been able to sit and
[11:10] throw and get himself in the church sit
[11:12] in the throne there and it just got me
[11:14] here it's what are we getting our energy
[11:16] from
[11:17] our spiritual energies have come from
[11:19] the word of God nothing else comes from
[11:22] him and this in this church they're on a
[11:24] completely different foundation and
[11:26] they're now receiving their he says
[11:27] their energy their virtue from its own
[11:31] false prophecies
[11:33] and the Sigh attire in age he talks
[11:35] about it says this is an age of a
[11:37] dominating female this is Mystery
[11:40] Babylon she's the great Jezebel
[11:42] the false prophetess
[11:44] and why is that we're going to see what
[11:48] actually is happening here
[11:49] the true female is submissive to God
[11:52] Christ is her head she has no word but
[11:54] his no thoughts but his no leadership
[11:57] but his but what about the false Church
[11:59] she's cast out the word she doesn't want
[12:02] she wants to be able to do her own thing
[12:04] have her Services the way she wants to
[12:07] hold them as long as we still get the
[12:09] same people happy and and blessed
[12:11] feeling that's the the age today look at
[12:14] more the Church of State teach
[12:15] moralistic
[12:16] therapeutic deism if a general idea of
[12:20] what's right and wrong therapeutic you
[12:22] give good feelings and you have deism
[12:24] this general idea of a god up there
[12:26] who's going to be your Cosmic Butler
[12:28] when you need him that's how it's taught
[12:31] today but this is this is the spirit of
[12:34] a domineering woman let me do what I
[12:36] want to do I'll call you when I need you
[12:39] that's all that it is I want my own way
[12:41] don't tell me what to do I'll ask your
[12:43] advice when I want it that's it and
[12:46] that's what's starting to sit and thrown
[12:48] there in the Church in the pergamian age
[12:53] and if we think about what what happens
[12:55] I have a couple scriptures on on page
[12:57] two here Ephesians 5 21-24 this talks
[13:02] about the submission in the in the
[13:04] marriage of wife to husband and that is
[13:08] just a picture of the submission that
[13:11] the church has to Christ
[13:14] for as the husband and wife submit
[13:16] yourselves to your own husband is unto
[13:18] the Lord for the husband is head of the
[13:20] wife is Christ of the head of the church
[13:22] the savior of the body as the church is
[13:24] subject to Christ let the wives be of
[13:27] their own husbands and everything he's
[13:28] talking not just about relationships but
[13:31] he's talking about the church the
[13:33] relationship of the church to Christ and
[13:35] then this pergamian age and Messiah
[13:37] tiring age the church really doesn't
[13:39] care what Christ says anymore the false
[13:42] church because they've they've pushed
[13:45] him out
[13:46] and that first Timothy 2 12 I suffer not
[13:49] a woman to teach nor did usurp authority
[13:52] over the man but to be in silence yet
[13:54] it's in this particular age where church
[13:57] councils are coming together and they're
[14:00] making their own pronouncements over to
[14:02] settle different questions and they
[14:04] start taking their own church councils
[14:06] as being authoritative and that is the
[14:09] spirit of a dominating woman because
[14:11] they don't care anymore what the word
[14:13] actually says we've come together we've
[14:16] solved the question that's what we're
[14:17] going to go with here
[14:19] but Paul says I suffer another woman to
[14:21] teach the church receives it doesn't
[14:24] come up with things it receives
[14:26] and this just continues to grow
[14:28] throughout the ages until finally if you
[14:30] look at the laodicean church age in
[14:32] Revelation 3 it says because thou sayest
[14:35] I'm rich I'm increased with Goods I have
[14:39] need of nothing and here this is the
[14:42] only church age that's actually
[14:44] distinguished by what they're saying
[14:46] about themselves
[14:48] this is the talking Church they're
[14:50] talking about themselves I've got this
[14:51] I've got this I'm so great I've got this
[14:54] program I've got that program they're
[14:56] talking about themselves
[14:58] and they really don't care what God says
[15:01] about them anymore they're just
[15:02] advertising what they have
[15:05] but and this is the the church then
[15:07] isn't even able to hear much less
[15:09] receive what Christ is trying to say to
[15:13] him he's standing at the door and
[15:14] knocking but they're so busy talking
[15:16] about what they are good are how good
[15:18] they are that they can't even hear him
[15:20] trying to get their attention but it
[15:24] starts back here in Perkins
[15:27] as they've as they've lost attention
[15:29] through the word they're basing their
[15:32] rightness before God on anything else
[15:33] except the word they just want to have
[15:35] it the way they want to have it
[15:38] at the um bottom of page two I have a a
[15:41] quotation from a church historian
[15:44] and he's speaking about four Church
[15:45] councils the Council of nicaea in 325
[15:48] A.D the Council of Constantinople the
[15:51] Council of Ephesus and 431 and the
[15:53] Council of calcedon in 451. Justinian
[15:57] says that these four councils which took
[16:00] place and were confirmed
[16:03] our authoritative in the Church of God
[16:05] and he added in like manner all the four
[16:08] synods of the Holy universal church we
[16:11] receive as we do the four books of the
[16:14] Holy Gospels
[16:15] this statement he's saying these Church
[16:18] councils what they say is just as valid
[16:21] as Matthew Mark Luke and John this is
[16:24] what brother Branham is saying they've
[16:26] put aside the church sorry the church
[16:28] has criticide the word and the church is
[16:30] just kind of in an echo chamber whatever
[16:32] they want to hear they're going to go
[16:34] with they don't they don't want God to
[16:37] be telling them what to do they just
[16:39] want the holy Cosmic Butler to come at
[16:41] their call but as far as leading them no
[16:43] so Paul's telling I suffer not the the
[16:46] woman to teach you serp Authority the
[16:48] church is doing that very thing when
[16:51] they're appealing to their Church
[16:52] doctrines and their books instead of the
[16:55] word of God
[16:57] amen
[16:59] I remember when we looked at one of the
[17:02] under the sessions early on I think
[17:04] chapter one or two we talked about basic
[17:06] keys and one of the the basic key one of
[17:09] the basic truth brother Branham talks
[17:10] about is that there's a false fine and
[17:12] that there's a true violence he says now
[17:14] a Revival signifies a move of God in
[17:17] power and every time God moves Satan is
[17:21] there to move also it never fails and
[17:25] then this statement caught my attention
[17:27] I hope and trust your spiritual mind
[17:30] enough to get that and capitalize on it
[17:33] this is a truth that helps us to live
[17:35] today if we can say there's a True Vine
[17:38] there's a false Vine there's a there's
[17:41] the rain falls on the just and on the
[17:43] unjust both can enjoy Revival but that
[17:47] the blessings don't mean it's true that
[17:50] it's right who is speaking to them here
[17:53] it's I am he which at the sharp sword
[17:55] which two edges God's revealing himself
[17:57] as the word that is the basis for what
[18:00] we're taking is our leadership going
[18:02] forward
[18:04] so as we as we kind of look through the
[18:07] scriptures
[18:08] um keeping this idea where's Waldo well
[18:10] the real Waldo please stand up can we
[18:13] find him and I want you to go through
[18:15] any air travel you got to go through get
[18:17] get your ID checked and you can imagine
[18:20] back in this day in the in in the church
[18:23] ages even still now when folks are
[18:25] coming they they're in they're in the
[18:27] Ephesian age the apostles coming and
[18:30] trying to minister in a church was
[18:31] commended for trying them who said they
[18:34] were Apostles but were not so the church
[18:37] is listening to the word that's coming
[18:39] forth they're doing an ID check does
[18:41] this match
[18:42] not what I feel should be right or what
[18:45] my brother said is right but what the
[18:47] word actually says is right this is
[18:48] there a match we want to have is that is
[18:50] this the real one is what we need to be
[18:53] finding
[18:54] because
[18:55] Paul says in second Corinthians 11 there
[18:58] are false Apostles deceitful workers who
[19:01] transformed themselves into the angel
[19:03] into the Apostles of Christ and no
[19:05] Marvel
[19:06] for Satan himself is transformed into an
[19:09] angel of Light so it's important when we
[19:11] see things moving can we do an ID check
[19:14] is is this according to the word of God
[19:17] or is there some is this something that
[19:19] has to do with the doctrine of the
[19:20] Nicolaitans which can sound very good
[19:22] can be very impressive produce some
[19:25] amazing I mean like brother Paul quoted
[19:28] from uh watch many it's amazing what the
[19:30] American church can do without even
[19:32] praying we can do an ID check is this a
[19:34] work of God or not is this a doctrine of
[19:37] Balaam this is a teaching of bailing
[19:39] it's important that we do an ID check
[19:42] because there are false Waldo's there
[19:44] are there's the there's there are false
[19:46] Messengers parading themselves around as
[19:49] angels of light and trying to uh to come
[19:52] across as as true
[19:54] and brother Branham teaches the Bible
[19:56] teaches they can come with an a genuine
[19:59] anointing
[20:00] Balaam had a genuine anointing he's up
[20:04] there on the hilltops and he's giving
[20:06] beautiful prophecies I see a star coming
[20:09] out of Jacob I see a scepter coming out
[20:12] of Israel it might have been these
[20:14] prophecies that let the wise men know
[20:16] who would have come from the East they
[20:18] would have been familiar with balaam's
[20:19] prophecies these gave the wise men
[20:21] grounds to be looking to the toward the
[20:23] East to be looking towards Judah to be
[20:25] making that that trip this is a this is
[20:28] a beautiful prophecy it's right on the
[20:31] word it's exactly right his anointing is
[20:34] correct the prophecy is correct think
[20:36] about Caiaphas who is high priest
[20:39] presiding over Christ's crucifixion
[20:42] and he prophesies it is needful that one
[20:45] should die for the people
[20:47] anointing was correct his prophecy was
[20:51] correct Ministries can even seem to be
[20:53] really really powerful
[20:56] yet they're teaching
[20:58] and their life
[21:00] can still be wrong
[21:03] so we live in the book we can open up
[21:06] where's Waldo there's all these guys who
[21:09] are wearing the stripes different colors
[21:11] it can be really hard to find them but
[21:13] you have to ID check everything coming
[21:16] in is this what's according to the word
[21:18] or not what is true
[21:20] just want to spend a little bit of time
[21:22] on this Matthew Chapter 13 this is where
[21:26] Jesus tells about the parable of the of
[21:28] the wheat and the tares he says the
[21:30] tares the the
[21:32] um the farmer goes out and he's planting
[21:34] a seed and he sows good seed but then
[21:37] after he's finished somebody else comes
[21:40] along an enemy comes along and sows
[21:42] weeds
[21:43] both seeds are there
[21:47] both seeds are here in the world also
[21:51] Hebrews 6 7. brother brother Bram tells
[21:55] about how he went to Mishawaka Indiana
[21:57] for uh as he's going on This fishing
[21:59] trip vacation early on he was a young
[22:01] man
[22:02] and the Jesus only Pentecostals were
[22:05] having their Revival meetings there so
[22:07] he goes and uh goes to the meetings and
[22:10] he just says there are these men who are
[22:11] just standing up and giving prophecies
[22:13] and interpretations as a Baptist he's
[22:15] just completely blown away by this is
[22:18] amazing
[22:19] there's he talks to to one of them after
[22:22] they said my this guy's got a testimony
[22:24] he's the genuine deal he he's the the
[22:26] Lord reveals that to him and he talks to
[22:28] the other man and this guy is cheating
[22:30] on his wife he's just the worst
[22:32] hypocrite of all yet he's got this
[22:36] powerful manifestation of the spirit and
[22:38] brother branham's just confused how can
[22:40] this be
[22:41] and he's praying about it and the Lord
[22:43] speaks to him from this particular verse
[22:45] in Hebrews 6 7. now the Earth with
[22:48] drinks in the rain that comes off upon
[22:51] it it brings forth herbs meat for them
[22:53] by whom it's dressed receiving blessings
[22:55] from God but that which beareth thorns
[22:58] and Briars is rejected and he thinks
[23:01] about this scripture and then also in
[23:03] Matthew 5 he God makes a son to rise on
[23:07] the evil and on the good he sends rain
[23:09] to the just and the unjust and
[23:13] brother Benham just God God chose him as
[23:16] the as the sun rises up we've all got
[23:19] Gardens where we're planting and have
[23:20] weeds in the gardens coming up but the
[23:22] weeds and the plants are all happy when
[23:24] the sun comes up they're all happy when
[23:26] the rain comes down and that's like
[23:28] everybody who's here and we've got all
[23:30] three kinds of Believers in every church
[23:32] but when the Holy Spirit falls in the
[23:34] service everybody's happy everybody
[23:35] thinks it's fantastic but that doesn't
[23:38] mean that everybody's a genuine seed
[23:40] and and every move of God it'll it'll be
[23:43] that way so it requires some discernment
[23:46] I got a kick out of this Charles Schultz
[23:48] special he's quoting there it does rain
[23:51] on the just and the unjust and Snoopy is
[23:53] yeah and in my face too
[23:55] but these these things these Ministries
[23:57] they have powerful works that are
[23:59] impressive
[24:00] Matthew 7 says many will come to me in
[24:03] that day saying have we not prophesied
[24:05] in your name we've cast out devils and
[24:08] man those Devils just fled away we've
[24:10] done many mighty wonderful works but our
[24:13] works are never a basis to identify
[24:15] ourselves by we identify ourselves based
[24:18] on what God says about us because these
[24:21] folks did wonderful works but God says I
[24:24] never knew you
[24:27] so they could have all it seems like
[24:29] they've got great manifestation
[24:32] but if you look at the life they're
[24:34] teaching and life will lead you away
[24:37] from the word even though they're
[24:39] powerful Ministries are just amazing
[24:42] unusual those powerful Ministries are
[24:44] going to attract attention to self but
[24:47] we'll be so impressed with that and
[24:48] people love to have their knight in
[24:50] shining armor to lead them forward but
[24:53] is it the word that's leading us forward
[24:56] Matthew 24 there'll be false christs
[24:59] false prophets and they will show great
[25:03] signs and wonders
[25:05] so we can look great signs into wonders
[25:08] we can be really impressed by that but
[25:10] that is not a sign of someone's being of
[25:14] God necessarily
[25:15] we have to do the ID check is this
[25:18] person a
[25:19] the real Waldo this re the real Christ
[25:23] working through here what is the
[25:25] teaching how are they telling to live my
[25:27] my life in Hebrews 11 talks about honor
[25:30] them who are serving you and leading you
[25:32] following their conversation their
[25:34] manner of life look to see how their
[25:37] work their their preaching actually
[25:39] manifests in their own life their
[25:42] family's life is that the kind of
[25:43] teaching you want to follow
[25:45] or not because anointings can be genuine
[25:48] prophecies can be correct spiritual
[25:51] manifestations can be astounding
[25:55] but watch the teaching
[25:57] what's the fruit in the everyday life
[25:59] because you can have all the others and
[26:02] not have that last and then it's not
[26:04] worth a whole lot
[26:07] Jesus doesn't deny that they did the
[26:09] mighty works that only the Holy Ghost
[26:12] can accomplish by way of men some of
[26:14] those weeds anybody I've gone weeding
[26:17] it's amazing how fast those weeds can
[26:20] spread it's amazing how much those
[26:22] Wheats can get rooted it's I mean they
[26:25] can that's weeds can really grow
[26:28] but that just and it's the blessings of
[26:31] God upon the Earth that's enabled the
[26:34] weeds to grow
[26:35] but that doesn't make the weed all of a
[26:37] sudden a welcome member of your garden
[26:40] it's the seed the word that matters the
[26:43] most
[26:47] I got to thinking about a story that's
[26:50] told in the Old Testament Elijah is
[26:53] running from Jezebel he's running for
[26:55] his life
[26:56] he's he's had this Mount Carmel Showdown
[26:59] and he's just slain personally with him
[27:03] he's tired he's been hacking heads off
[27:05] all day long over 400 prophets of Baal
[27:07] he kills he's got to be worn out
[27:10] emotionally physically drained
[27:13] and then he races ahead of Ahab to the
[27:16] Palace because the rain's coming
[27:18] everything that he's been preaching for
[27:20] for me for several years is now coming
[27:22] to pass it all happens and he hears
[27:25] Jezebel's Proclamation I'm gonna get him
[27:28] and he's just he's just drained he's
[27:32] bowled over and he runs to the desert
[27:35] and hides and God sustains him
[27:38] and then God reveals himself to him
[27:40] three ways he says this Mighty Wind
[27:44] went right in front of him and says wow
[27:46] it was powerful
[27:49] but the voice of God was not in the Wind
[27:52] then this powerful earthquake has shut
[27:55] the place rocks just falling all over
[27:57] the place
[27:58] but the voice of God was not on the
[28:01] earthquake and then this fire passes
[28:03] through
[28:06] the man that could be the pillar of fire
[28:08] was that it
[28:09] but it says the voice of God was not
[28:13] in the fire
[28:15] but after the fire
[28:18] a still small voice
[28:21] that's where the voice of God was
[28:24] what do we get most impressed by
[28:28] we'd all love to see the wind sweeping
[28:32] through and I love seeing that in
[28:33] Services we love God coming through and
[28:36] just shaking those shaking the
[28:37] foundations and people being and we love
[28:40] that
[28:41] and if people get free from that we know
[28:43] God's moving we can see the fire coming
[28:45] and that's great
[28:47] but are we hearing God speak that's the
[28:50] most important otherwise we just leave
[28:52] emotionally pepped up and feeling good
[28:55] but that's not the image that sustains
[28:57] us for the long Marathon Journey but
[29:00] after these three things come there was
[29:02] a still small voice
[29:04] and brother Branham talks about this and
[29:07] he said he he says I wonder if we're
[29:09] sufficiently impressed
[29:11] with the word in our midst
[29:14] and on page 187 the church age books
[29:17] speaking of the pergamian church Jesus
[29:19] knew there was going to be a terrible
[29:22] drift away from the word and the
[29:24] pergamian age which was as yet 200 years
[29:28] off from the patentless vision he knew
[29:30] that drift what caused them to go into
[29:33] the Dark Ages he knew the way man
[29:35] originally got away from God
[29:38] was by first leaving the word and if you
[29:40] leave that word
[29:41] you've left God you might continue to
[29:44] have amazing meetings they had amazing
[29:47] meetings in the program and they're in
[29:49] the false Church of herkimos but if you
[29:51] get away from God you the word you leave
[29:53] God
[29:54] that's why he's presenting himself to
[29:56] the church at pergamus and indeed to all
[29:58] churches of all ages I am the word if
[30:01] you want deity in your midst then
[30:03] welcome and receive the word
[30:06] don't let anyone or anything get between
[30:09] you and that word but I'm giving you the
[30:12] word as a revelation of myself I am the
[30:16] word remember that and then he says I
[30:19] wonder if we're sufficiently impressed
[30:22] with the word
[30:23] he gives us his best when he gives us
[30:27] that
[30:29] when I was a a freshman at College I can
[30:31] remember the campus Crusade for Christ
[30:33] hit up a little uh a little uh booth and
[30:37] the dining Commons and the tide level
[30:40] was who is Jesus and they have this
[30:42] magic markers inviting to come up and
[30:44] this right on there who you said who who
[30:46] you thought Jesus was people were
[30:48] writing up the Son of God a
[30:50] revolutionary a uh a good philosophy of
[30:53] all kinds of answers
[30:55] and I went up there a 19 year old guy 19
[30:58] year old kid I went up there and I wrote
[31:01] up I felt really good about myself that
[31:02] Jesus is the word
[31:05] and that is the right answer but I and
[31:07] you know I didn't really know what I was
[31:09] writing I'd heard it in the church in
[31:12] Sunday school class Jesus is the word
[31:13] that's the right answer but what's it
[31:16] mean because the word is not just a
[31:20] teaching or a Doctrine and that's what
[31:22] we can it's easy to get that impression
[31:24] that's not take it any further than that
[31:26] we can think yeah when when God sent the
[31:29] message he sent his word and we just
[31:32] have correct Doctrine the correct
[31:34] teaching but it's so much more than that
[31:37] because he identity I am this and the
[31:40] closest I could come to try to to try to
[31:43] bring it across is
[31:45] thinking back to
[31:47] when when Elise and I were were
[31:50] recording we were emailing back and
[31:52] forth and this looks much more romantic
[31:55] than an email this old-fashioned love
[31:57] letters people would would write
[31:59] and they'd be sending these back and
[32:01] forth back and forth and we emailed for
[32:05] about nine months before we got married
[32:06] and my wife she actually has all those
[32:09] emails printed out they've been saved
[32:11] and go back through there and and go
[32:13] walk through memory lane and see them
[32:15] all
[32:16] that uh weed emailed for months before
[32:20] we'd actually
[32:21] yeah we hadn't talked more than probably
[32:23] 15 or 20 minutes together we'd spend a
[32:25] lot of time emailing you go for the
[32:27] first
[32:27] face to face you know how is this going
[32:30] to work and my mother-in-law was a
[32:31] little bit nervous because what if it
[32:33] doesn't work out I've got this guy here
[32:35] for two weeks and I've got to take care
[32:37] of him if it doesn't work out what's
[32:38] going to happen
[32:39] because
[32:41] all the emails all the love letters
[32:43] that's the word
[32:46] that that those are characteristics
[32:48] there's a lot there
[32:51] and the words in the Old Testaments is
[32:52] God expressing his his his love for the
[32:56] children of Israel
[32:58] that word was made flesh and dwelt Among
[33:00] Us
[33:01] it's like the guy who wrote all the love
[33:03] letters he's coming getting off the
[33:05] plane and I'm here now we can have a
[33:09] conversation now we can get to know each
[33:11] other better for real and eventually
[33:16] the word is made fleshy he comes back
[33:18] again
[33:19] for a marriage this is getting better
[33:21] and better and that's the that's the
[33:23] sense I want us to think about that
[33:25] Christ is Christ is the word because
[33:27] God's invisible it's hard to have a
[33:29] relationship with somebody that's
[33:31] invisible
[33:32] this is the only we can have
[33:33] relationship with God is if as he
[33:36] reveals himself to us so he's giving us
[33:38] hints of who he is throughout the Old
[33:41] Testament he's telling us little bits
[33:43] about himself and that's all well and
[33:45] it's wonderful but eventually that word
[33:48] that becomes flesh and then we have a
[33:50] relation this goes further and further
[33:52] first John 1 talks about that which we
[33:55] have seen from the beginning what your
[33:57] eyes have seen our hands have handled of
[33:59] the word of life this has gotten real
[34:02] it's not just words on the page it's
[34:04] jumped off the page it's in my life it's
[34:07] in my business it's changing my life I
[34:10] love this that's when we're talking
[34:12] about when we say Christ is the word he
[34:15] wants to he wants to manifest himself to
[34:18] you personally
[34:19] the word sounds so so ah yeah so yeah
[34:24] intangible it sounds so distance but
[34:27] it's that's the only way that Christ can
[34:30] start having a relationship with us
[34:31] because he's invisible he just starts
[34:33] he's got thoughts the only way to
[34:35] express that thought is a word and then
[34:37] that thought just and that word just
[34:39] keeps materializing and materializing
[34:41] but coming flesh more and more and more
[34:43] until he was born as a baby he dies from
[34:45] the cross for us more and more material
[34:47] till he comes in the Holy Spirit in your
[34:49] life
[34:50] the and the idea of the word is his
[34:53] that's how God comes into our lives in
[34:55] this way
[34:56] the only way
[34:58] that we can really be born again is by
[35:01] receiving that word
[35:04] that's where Christ his thoughts about
[35:07] us from the beginning they become
[35:09] material in us and we believe the word
[35:13] for our day and the word which in which
[35:15] we live just claiming some manifestation
[35:18] right pray for somebody and they're
[35:20] healed right I preached an amazing
[35:22] sermon people leave so blessed those are
[35:24] great
[35:25] but are we really taking God's word into
[35:29] our hearts where it's taking on a
[35:31] physical manifestation in our own lives
[35:35] that's what he who has the sharp sword
[35:38] with two edges is saying to the
[35:40] perkamian church age he's telling them
[35:42] don't be deceived by the doctrine of
[35:44] Balaam just going in on this great
[35:47] worship Fest where it's really really
[35:48] wonderful when you have great feelings
[35:50] and you leave with great feelings that
[35:52] really cheapens the relationship because
[35:55] marriage is so much more than good
[35:57] feelings
[35:58] same that's all that it is that ah that
[36:01] makes it so little because he wants to
[36:03] come in US changes transform us that's
[36:07] what it's all about that's what he who
[36:10] has the sharp sword with two edges says
[36:15] and there are lots of uh lots of more uh
[36:18] scriptures and some quotes on page four
[36:20] talking about but I think we we get the
[36:22] idea the evidence of it evidence of a
[36:25] Spirit-filled believer is not producing
[36:27] things it's receiving the word
[36:31] because we can try to produce everything
[36:33] we want but if we don't receive that
[36:34] word we're running on our own energy and
[36:37] we're eventually going to let out
[36:38] but if we receive the word
[36:41] it's going to produce itself it's going
[36:44] to and it won't be based on our own
[36:46] energy it'll be all on him evidence has
[36:49] to do with receiving the word and a lot
[36:51] of material there on chat on on page
[36:53] four to look at
[36:57] when I am when I teach English classes
[37:00] at school I like to use a a plot diagram
[37:06] what kind of illustrate where we are in
[37:08] the book
[37:09] what's going on because if you open a
[37:11] book
[37:12] and you just open up there in the middle
[37:14] and you start reading
[37:15] it's not going to make sense
[37:18] you have to know where you are in the
[37:20] book in order for it to make sense
[37:23] and this is a simple plot diagram a lot
[37:26] of our plot diagrams will look more like
[37:27] this you've got rising action things are
[37:30] going up and up and you might think at
[37:32] that first climax oh this is the climax
[37:34] this is this is the point of the book
[37:36] this is what I've been living for but no
[37:38] this is just
[37:40] predecessor to it there'll be another
[37:42] dip and we're going to up another this
[37:44] seems like the climax this is it this is
[37:46] the great Revival before we go home but
[37:47] uh no this is we're we're we're getting
[37:50] there
[37:51] in order to make sense of the plot it
[37:54] helps know where you are in the plot and
[37:57] then the all the other events make sense
[37:59] because if we don't know where we're at
[38:02] in the plot
[38:03] we kind of get like John the Baptist
[38:06] because John the Baptist had an
[38:08] expectation I'm preaching it's going to
[38:10] come right here and Jesus is going to do
[38:11] this and it's all be over we'll have
[38:13] victory and it didn't happen the way he
[38:16] expected he lost his orientation of
[38:19] where he was in the plot so he asked you
[38:21] this are you the one who should come or
[38:24] should we look for another
[38:26] so it's important that we know where we
[38:29] are
[38:31] and brother Brandon preaches a message
[38:32] modern events are made clear by prophecy
[38:35] and when they when they saw that title
[38:38] as a young person growing up at the
[38:39] Masters ah if I want to know what's
[38:41] going on in the world I'll just pick up
[38:42] that message and he'll tell me about
[38:44] what's going to happen with Iran in this
[38:46] nuclear bomb they might try to develop
[38:47] or he's going to tell me about global
[38:49] warming they're talking about this he
[38:50] hasn't talked about any of that stuff in
[38:51] that message
[38:53] so how are modern events made clear by
[38:55] prophecy in that message
[38:57] the way I kind of
[38:59] hey that is if you don't know where
[39:01] you're where you are in the plot the
[39:03] plot's not going to make sense
[39:05] but God sends a prophet to tell us where
[39:08] we're at in the plot what's coming up
[39:11] next and he's not going to give all the
[39:14] details but he's going to give us some
[39:16] general event what the plot diagram
[39:18] looks like and then we know what to
[39:21] expect going forward
[39:24] John the Baptist kind of lost sides of
[39:27] where he was in the story we can get
[39:29] that too expectations are dangerous
[39:31] things we have to have them but we can
[39:34] think one thing's going to happen that
[39:35] doesn't think oh man is this all even
[39:37] true we have to go back not to our
[39:39] expectations but to he who holds the
[39:41] sharp sword with two edges to what the
[39:44] word actually says about it
[39:47] and one reason I wanted to take this um
[39:49] take this topic here the seeds I want to
[39:51] talk about a little um a couple of pages
[39:54] that brother Brandon includes in this
[39:57] message on the pergamian church age in
[39:59] the in the church age book
[40:01] let's come sometimes referred to as the
[40:03] pick up your pen and write a section
[40:06] and brother Brandon Mattel so he was
[40:08] studying one evening and the end of the
[40:10] Lord the spirit Lord came down and says
[40:12] pick up your pen and write and he did
[40:15] that he picked up his pin and he just
[40:17] started writing him the Lord inspired
[40:18] him and he wrote and wrote and wrote in
[40:20] several several pages long
[40:26] I kind of to me this is a special
[40:29] couple Pages because it kind of lets us
[40:32] know where we are
[40:34] in the plot diagram
[40:37] what's going on
[40:39] what we can look to going forward and
[40:42] that's kind of important to know so we
[40:44] know what's coming
[40:46] and he talks about and I've got several
[40:48] several references several quotations
[40:50] here
[40:52] um
[40:53] as he opens this section he talks about
[40:55] the law of reproduction he's talking
[40:57] about how every seed Bears forth of its
[41:00] kind
[41:01] he says and this this word has to do
[41:03] with the word and the bride and he says
[41:06] here's what I'm trying to say to you the
[41:08] law of reproduction is that each species
[41:10] brings forth after its own kind just
[41:12] like it says in Genesis 1 11
[41:14] and it says the same law applies to the
[41:17] church today
[41:18] whatever seed started the church will
[41:21] come forth and be like the Original Seed
[41:24] because it is the same seed
[41:28] it says in these last days the true
[41:30] bride Church Christ seed will come to
[41:32] the headstones she will be the Super
[41:34] Church a super racist she nears him they
[41:37] and the bride will be so much like him
[41:39] that they'll be in his very image
[41:41] they'll be United with them they'll be
[41:43] one it says denominations can't produce
[41:45] this because it's the wrong seed
[41:48] and we can go back when you when you
[41:51] plant a garden you'll be planting all
[41:52] these all these different different
[41:54] different seeds and you can look at the
[41:55] look at the picture on the package and
[41:57] this is this is the fruit that should
[41:58] come forth yet at the same time within a
[42:01] few weeks you're going to have these and
[42:04] the dandelions weren't pictured on the
[42:06] package the enemies done that to our
[42:09] Gardens but the same thing happened in
[42:12] Christ's Garden the church Christ plants
[42:15] his seed his word even after he goes off
[42:18] and and his lead and and and they're
[42:21] sold in the seed the enemy comes forth
[42:23] on the very same Garden among the very
[42:25] same people and he sows the tares
[42:29] and
[42:30] which one is which they're going to grow
[42:33] up and it can be dangerous having your
[42:36] husband help you with the weeding
[42:38] it can be dangerous having your little
[42:40] kids help you with the weeding because
[42:42] I'll just kind of you want me to weed
[42:44] you want this cleared out I'll do it
[42:45] we'll just clear this stuff out and
[42:48] before too long I've cleared out a lot
[42:50] of good seed I took the weeds up I took
[42:52] some good stuff out too
[42:54] so in Matthew 13 Jesus says you have to
[42:56] let the two grow up together my wife's
[42:59] never accepted that is there a way to
[43:01] get out of weeding but that's what Jesus
[43:03] said just let the two grow up together
[43:04] because when that Harvest drain Falls
[43:06] you'll at the end you'll see very clear
[43:09] this is a tomato that's a weed it'll be
[43:12] very clear at that point you've got to
[43:14] let them both grow up
[43:16] but brother Branham talks about
[43:18] what we can expect as we're as we're
[43:21] heading toward Harvest Time and that
[43:24] helps us see where we are and what we
[43:27] can expect
[43:28] he talks about the both the former
[43:31] Reigns and the latter rain and the role
[43:34] they play in God's restoration work I
[43:36] just want to talk a little bit about
[43:38] about that and just kind of look at what
[43:40] brother Branham well his expectations
[43:42] are for this work that he's expecting
[43:44] God to do even as his ministry is in a
[43:47] transition
[43:48] because you're going to see what what
[43:49] what what what is he looking for
[43:51] that can kind of give us some guidance
[43:53] what can we be expecting God to be doing
[43:59] in the book of Hosea where does these
[44:01] references to former and latter rain
[44:02] come from
[44:03] uh Hosea 6 after two days will he revive
[44:06] us in the third day he'll raise us up
[44:08] and we shall live in his sight
[44:11] then shall we know if we follow on to
[44:13] know the Lord his going forth has
[44:15] prepared us the morning he'll come unto
[44:17] us as the rain as the latter and former
[44:20] Reign into the Earth and the former rain
[44:23] that is the early reign of the Autumn
[44:25] shower which is the planning cycle is
[44:27] different there but that that word yora
[44:30] is connected to to other words
[44:33] he instructs Jehovah hath taught me and
[44:37] we're going to see the former rain have
[44:39] to do with teaching
[44:41] and the Book of Joel be glad then ye
[44:44] children of Zion rejoice in the Lord
[44:46] your God he hath given you the former
[44:48] Reign moderately and this form of rain
[44:51] here it's it's a different word Mora but
[44:54] again the early Reign that comes in the
[44:56] sowing season after and then it's also
[44:59] connected to being a a teacher
[45:01] and then the message the spoken word is
[45:04] the Original Seed brother Branham
[45:05] comments directly about this he says
[45:07] someone asked me to repeat that Hebrew
[45:09] word again in Joel 2 28 we just read
[45:12] he's speaking that the former and latter
[45:14] rain the word former is the Hebrew word
[45:16] which means teaching in other words
[45:18] it'll be a teaching Reign and that'll be
[45:21] the former Ray and the latter rain is
[45:22] the Harvest rain
[45:25] and talk about these
[45:26] a little bit
[45:31] the
[45:33] the latter rain is talking about this is
[45:35] going to be this the leading us up to a
[45:38] Mount Carmel kind of a showdown the
[45:40] latter end is going to come as as a as a
[45:42] climax of Ministries
[45:44] and he's talking about John the Baptist
[45:46] he planted a former Reign John the
[45:49] Baptist is teaching preaching he's
[45:51] rejected by the churches but then when
[45:53] Jesus came on the Mount of
[45:55] transfiguration and God comes down and
[45:57] says this is my son hear ye him that's
[45:59] Vindication John the Baptist said this
[46:02] is the Lamb of God he'll take away the
[46:03] sins of the world Pharisees had their
[46:05] opinions Sadducees of their opinion
[46:07] people might have other opinions but
[46:09] when God comes down and says this is my
[46:11] beloved Son hear ye him that's The
[46:14] Showdown because no Pharisees are on
[46:16] that man of transfiguration no Sadducees
[46:18] were there only Christ and God saying
[46:21] this is my son hear ye him that's the
[46:23] show Young who's going to be there at
[46:26] that mount then kind of like this
[46:27] showdown on Mount Carmel you have Baal
[46:30] of His prophets and you have Elijah and
[46:34] God vindicates Elijah he's my Prophet
[46:36] that is the Elijah had so much he taught
[46:40] and labored much but that end came it
[46:43] was Vindication what was true what was
[46:45] not
[46:47] and brother Branham says the Forerunner
[46:49] of the last days is going to sow for the
[46:53] former reign Jesus will be the showdown
[46:55] between denominations and Creeds when he
[46:58] comes The Showdown is going to be the
[47:00] Rapture of his bride there'll be many
[47:03] who say yes I'm following him I'm the
[47:05] true church I'm going to go on that
[47:07] rapture
[47:08] but like we've seen in the Book of
[47:10] Revelation there's a True Vine and
[47:12] there's a false Vine that false Vine's
[47:14] not going to go
[47:15] how do we know who the real Waldo is
[47:18] well when Christ comes that'll be The
[47:20] Showdown that will be the that'll be
[47:23] that time of that ladder rain that's
[47:25] going to show who where what the genuine
[47:27] is there was a Mount Carmel amount
[47:29] Transfiguration is going to be a Mount
[47:31] Zion
[47:32] brother Brandon says
[47:34] and when I first read these um some time
[47:38] ago you kind of go at it first thinking
[47:40] man God sends this ministry to brother
[47:42] Branham and that is just completely
[47:44] awesome that's that that that's that
[47:47] that that that that's it
[47:49] it's interesting looking how brother how
[47:50] brother Graham talks about this
[47:52] they've been talking so much about
[47:54] ladder rain and this is he's saying this
[47:55] in 1962. this is not discarding you
[47:58] ladder rain Brethren but what you're
[48:00] talking about isn't ladder rain if the
[48:02] latter rain would have been here the
[48:04] power of God would have struck the thing
[48:06] she'd swept the world that latter rains
[48:08] fixing to come but what's the matter the
[48:10] church is manufacturing herself
[48:12] something just like Eve tried to do
[48:14] remember the church doesn't manufacture
[48:17] the church being the type of the woman
[48:19] receives and here in this case the
[48:22] church is so busy trying to produce
[48:24] something but they're not sitting still
[48:27] and just receiving and waiting
[48:31] and then when brother Branham talks
[48:33] about I'm just going to take a
[48:35] um sorry take a look at the middle of
[48:37] page seven
[48:46] actually bottom of page six
[48:49] at the end time seed sign
[48:52] he says there there's a revival going on
[48:55] what is it he says it's a sowing
[48:59] you don't hear very much of Billy Graham
[49:01] the more do you what about Oral Roberts
[49:03] the rest of them you know that great
[49:04] Revival fire is not burning what is it
[49:06] it's the end time a seed sign the word
[49:08] has been sown what is a denomination a
[49:12] denomination that makes them Confederate
[49:14] themselves together but
[49:16] the word of God has been sown also when
[49:18] the spirit of God begins to fall the
[49:21] word of God will live in the people and
[49:24] that's what the real thing is you've
[49:26] received the word of God and he and he
[49:28] activated he he quickens it and then yes
[49:32] there's a there's going to be a lot of
[49:33] false things out there that's been sown
[49:35] and that's going to be coming to
[49:37] maturity also because that latter rain
[49:40] falls on just and unjust it brings all
[49:43] seeds to maturity
[49:45] so the false thing that's been out there
[49:47] it's going to get even worse but the
[49:49] true that's there that is going to be
[49:51] coming to maturity also it'll reap a
[49:54] bride of Christ as certain as I'm
[49:56] standing here
[49:57] end time signs
[49:59] and at the top of page seven
[50:02] um
[50:03] it's good for as a reminder it's good
[50:05] for us to be very careful about our
[50:07] interpretations of what God's doing
[50:11] many people fought at the Pentecostal
[50:14] revivals were the latter rain
[50:18] but brother Branham said no you got it
[50:20] backwards that's the former ring
[50:23] completely backwards and sometimes our
[50:26] interpretations can be so well-meaning
[50:28] that they can be absolutely contrary to
[50:31] what God's doing
[50:32] remember when Paul is leaving Ephesus
[50:35] and he's got on his heart to go back to
[50:37] Jerusalem
[50:38] and wherever he goes people in the
[50:40] church are saying they're even
[50:42] prophesying Paul I think agabus puts his
[50:46] His Garment around Paul Schuler said the
[50:48] wear of this garment we bound and change
[50:49] in Jerusalem the the prophecy is true
[50:53] but everybody in the room interprets the
[50:55] prophecy Paul don't go God doesn't want
[50:58] you to go the prophecy was true but
[51:01] their interpretation was wrong because
[51:03] God was leading him to Jerusalem
[51:06] so we've got to watch out for our own
[51:08] interpretations of it remember brother
[51:10] Brandon preaches the the uh the Seven
[51:12] Seals and they tell us all the brothers
[51:14] just stay right here he's interpreting
[51:16] Junior Jackson's dream
[51:18] just stay right here around this this
[51:20] rock has never seen light before just
[51:21] stay there and keep looking at it just
[51:23] keep receiving it just keep receiving it
[51:25] just keep receiving it very few did that
[51:27] they went off with all kinds of other
[51:29] things
[51:30] they didn't do what he said to do we
[51:32] need to be careful about our own
[51:34] interpretations we just receive and I
[51:37] love this uh this takes all the uh all
[51:39] the pressure off
[51:41] um they're in the middle of page seven
[51:43] whether Brandon says in Investments like
[51:45] I've said before God needs Nobody to
[51:49] interpret his word
[51:50] he does his own interpretation by
[51:53] bringing to pass the things he said he
[51:56] would do so we can just keep our hands
[51:58] off and say God will bring it to pass
[52:01] when he wants to I know God's going to
[52:03] do something I'm going to keep right on
[52:05] receiving his word and if I could try to
[52:07] interpret it one way or the other I'll
[52:09] just show confusion with my own
[52:11] interpretations I'm going to keep my
[52:12] hands off it God's gonna do something
[52:14] he's going to get me out of here and I'm
[52:16] waiting for that and I'll just leave it
[52:18] at that because if I go further than
[52:19] that
[52:20] I'll be drawing people to my
[52:22] interpretation perhaps instead of what
[52:24] God actually says himself God interprets
[52:28] his own word he doesn't need our
[52:29] interpretation our interpretation is our
[52:33] own man-made thoughts that we put with
[52:36] it just like when agubus prophesies to
[52:39] Paul
[52:40] the man who wears His Garment is gonna
[52:42] die and you're going to be uh be bound
[52:44] in Jerusalem that's God's word the
[52:46] interpretation though
[52:48] they put the wrong spin on it don't go
[52:50] Paul that's wrong gotta be careful with
[52:52] our interpretation so
[52:55] what I'm gonna share further about the
[52:57] former latter rain I'm just going to say
[52:59] what he said I'm not going to put any
[53:01] interpretation to it God's got great
[53:03] things coming and we can be excited
[53:04] about it
[53:06] well I like seeing here I put the dates
[53:09] what what brother Branham when the the
[53:12] um the data that that he makes these
[53:13] statements because you can see he's
[53:16] wondering what's going on have I planted
[53:18] all the seeds that's supposed to be
[53:20] planted it's interesting how he
[53:22] understands his ministry his ministry
[53:24] says it's a planting Ministry he's
[53:26] sowing he's sowing seed
[53:29] have I done all the things I'm supposed
[53:31] to be planting
[53:34] is the time at hand
[53:36] is this great messenger fixing a step on
[53:38] the scene right now is the coming of the
[53:40] Lord near and says oh God and the next
[53:43] the second paragraph is actually I think
[53:44] a couple Pages further let your people
[53:46] realize that soon the Angels shall set
[53:48] foot upon land and see and raise his
[53:50] hands and say time shall be no more he's
[53:53] looking this is coming
[53:56] where are we exactly I'm not sure but
[53:59] it's coming
[54:01] then he says in July 5th 1962 he's
[54:04] talking remember Malachi 4
[54:07] there's going to be he says there's a
[54:09] promise I'll restore there will come
[54:12] forth one with a message and he'll
[54:13] restore the hearts of the faith of the
[54:15] children back to the faith of the
[54:16] fathers he promised that the Malachi 4
[54:19] that he would do it
[54:21] and when I read this quote the first
[54:22] time I said wow yeah he did promise that
[54:24] and you're it brother Branham and then
[54:26] he goes and he says
[54:28] but remember Malachi 4 the message comes
[54:31] the terrible day of the Lord will come
[54:32] that never happened after John if that
[54:35] was it then the scripture is lost it's
[54:37] hold we have had two thousand years
[54:38] since sin he says but we're still
[54:41] waiting for that something that's going
[54:43] to take the faith and restore the faith
[54:45] of the children back to the original
[54:46] Pentecostal tree
[54:49] and when I read this the first time I
[54:50] said yeah brother brim you've been doing
[54:52] that well it's 1962 and he says I've
[54:55] just been sewing we're waiting for that
[54:58] I thought what what's going on why why
[55:00] is he saying this
[55:03] and then in the message uh the countdown
[55:05] he says now we're in the seventh age the
[55:07] land is cnh and we're looking for that
[55:10] great messenger of the second appearing
[55:12] of Elijah on the countdown he says we're
[55:15] we're looking for that I thought my
[55:17] brother Brandon you've been here already
[55:18] since 1947 preaching what are we looking
[55:21] for because he's been sowing sowing
[55:24] sewing but we're still waiting for this
[55:27] to come and remember we're talking about
[55:30] well the real wall though will the real
[55:32] work of God show himself so we can so we
[55:35] can see what is true and what's false
[55:37] here this is what we're talking about
[55:40] then 1963 March 20th in the ma in the in
[55:43] the third seal
[55:45] what's this now
[55:46] the reason
[55:48] um says what um the revivals that we're
[55:50] supposed to have he says we have
[55:52] denominational revivals but we haven't
[55:55] had a real stirring no no no he says
[55:59] don't think we have revivals we haven't
[56:01] he says oh they've got millions and
[56:03] millions and millions of church members
[56:06] which I bet somebody who watches the
[56:08] metrics are saying yeah we've cut a real
[56:11] Revival here
[56:12] but God's not looking for that metric
[56:15] he's looking for hearts that are
[56:17] restored that's the metric that God's
[56:19] after he says they've got millions and
[56:21] millions and millions of church members
[56:23] but not a Revival nowhere he says the
[56:27] bride hasn't had a Revival yet there's
[56:29] been no Revival there no manifestation
[56:32] of God to stir the bride yet we're
[56:35] looking for it
[56:37] it'll take those seven unknown Thunders
[56:39] back there to wake her up again he will
[56:42] send it he promised it where's the
[56:45] Revival it's not these church people
[56:47] flooding into a church necessarily
[56:50] Balaam would say that's it because this
[56:53] is the what's getting us results this is
[56:55] what's getting us huge numbers
[56:56] financially whatever number you look at
[56:58] balaam's happy with but brother bramlet
[57:01] said this isn't the Revival this isn't
[57:03] it
[57:06] and then at the uh at the end of the
[57:09] year 1963 December 29th it says so now
[57:12] I'm going to say something to you that I
[57:14] haven't said all along and that is the
[57:17] thing that we've looked forward to for
[57:20] so long at least many years four or five
[57:23] years maybe longer the third poll
[57:25] has now been Vindicated and I'm sure you
[57:28] all know what it is
[57:29] and maybe a lot of people said amen
[57:31] maybe they knew what he was talking
[57:33] about what he wasn't talking about I
[57:34] don't know but he's saying something has
[57:36] happened and we noticed in 1906 earlier
[57:39] in 1963
[57:40] 1962 he says we're waiting for something
[57:43] to happen it hasn't happened yet we're
[57:45] waiting for something all of a sudden
[57:46] end of the year in 1960s it's happened
[57:49] there's something that happened there
[57:51] that's the core of what the Revival is
[57:55] that will produce lasting results
[57:57] lasting truth
[57:59] and he says it's so sacred I mustn't say
[58:02] too much about it
[58:04] and he says this will be the one thing
[58:07] that to my opinion I don't say the Lord
[58:09] tells you this this will be a thing that
[58:11] will that will start the rapturing faith
[58:13] for the going away something happened
[58:17] and it was a revelation of that God is
[58:20] breaking forth the Seven Seals showing
[58:23] how he's been working Through the Ages
[58:24] who he is how he's working now is going
[58:27] to come and take us away this is another
[58:29] part of the word becoming flesh
[58:32] the word being the love letters
[58:35] we've we've we've known him for so long
[58:38] just by the love just by the letters but
[58:40] then when the word comes off the page
[58:42] and you go pick him up at the airport
[58:44] say wow I'm with them now we can talk we
[58:47] can talk and eventually that word
[58:48] becomes more personal when he asks me to
[58:51] marry him he slips an engagement rings
[58:53] on my finger that's what this is about
[58:55] because brother Branham is coming as a
[58:58] forerunner to prepare the way to restore
[59:00] the hearts so restore a bride to be
[59:03] ready
[59:04] so that wedding ring can be slipped upon
[59:07] her finger
[59:11] and he continues in the same message I
[59:13] want to say this
[59:14] according to what he said 30 years ago
[59:16] on the river down there in 1933
[59:19] everything's happened just exactly
[59:22] I may not do it
[59:25] but this message will introduce Jesus
[59:27] Christ to the world so we can easily get
[59:30] our attention too much on to just to the
[59:34] man brother Brown that he's got to be
[59:35] the one that does it but he's telling us
[59:37] I may not be the one that'll do it but
[59:39] the message I'm bringing that'll
[59:41] introduce Christ to the world just like
[59:44] John was sent before on the first coming
[59:45] the message will forerun the second
[59:48] coming it doesn't matter that the
[59:49] brother Branham the man isn't here
[59:51] because Jesus came to reveal himself to
[59:53] pergamus and still now I am he which
[59:56] holds the it's the sharp sword with two
[59:58] edges this is what produces the Revival
[1:00:00] this is how we can know what's true and
[1:00:03] what's false don't go by anything else
[1:00:05] but this and it's not that it's just
[1:00:07] word that we just oh yes I believe
[1:00:09] brother Brandon was a prophet I believe
[1:00:10] Malachi 4 5 and 6 no because if we have
[1:00:13] that in our lives it's like a woman's
[1:00:15] pregnant she's gonna be feeling all
[1:00:17] kinds of things there'll be kicks here
[1:00:19] kicks that she's feeling life inside of
[1:00:21] her we will have life we'll have
[1:00:23] Vindication but the one without the
[1:00:26] other is insufficient you have to have
[1:00:28] the word and life going with it and they
[1:00:31] belong together
[1:00:35] in 1964 in the message recognizing your
[1:00:37] day and its message
[1:00:43] he says everywhere now there's no
[1:00:45] Revival and I wonder if people he was
[1:00:48] with would have said the same thing I
[1:00:49] don't I'm curious about that everybody
[1:00:52] is complaining ministers crying hearing
[1:00:54] fast pray we want to have a Breaking of
[1:00:56] the day this great thing is going to
[1:00:57] happen pray pray pray for Revival we're
[1:00:59] not too late yet
[1:01:01] we have the same thing today people
[1:01:03] praying for Revival that's a great thing
[1:01:05] to pray for and God can come and do
[1:01:08] things sovereignly this is never we we
[1:01:10] we can never say this because God moves
[1:01:13] in another building that's not our
[1:01:15] building but it's not of God I was
[1:01:17] thinking about Jonah
[1:01:18] he is with he he he's a prophet of the
[1:01:22] god of Israel
[1:01:23] why doesn't God start a Revival in
[1:01:26] Bethlehem why doesn't God start a
[1:01:28] Revival in Jerusalem but for some reason
[1:01:31] that Jonah never hears an explanation
[1:01:33] for God starts a Revival in Nineveh
[1:01:37] what did Nineveh do to deserve that
[1:01:40] but what does Jonah get Jonah really
[1:01:43] gets uh
[1:01:45] spanked for his reaction to it because
[1:01:48] Jonah was an arrogant Jew
[1:01:51] he was like some of us message Believers
[1:01:53] some are saying that God can only move
[1:01:55] in my church
[1:01:56] no God will move anywhere God moved in
[1:01:59] Nineveh and the only appropriate
[1:02:01] reaction to a move of God is praise
[1:02:04] that's the only appropriate reaction and
[1:02:07] Jonah got spanked because he was mad
[1:02:10] that he couldn't see Nineveh burn
[1:02:13] he wanted to have a wiener roast there
[1:02:15] at none of his fires he wanted to
[1:02:16] celebrate that God says no I am having
[1:02:19] Mercy on these people the only way to
[1:02:22] respond to Mercy is praise you should be
[1:02:24] praising me John and that's how we
[1:02:27] should be doing it doesn't matter where
[1:02:28] God moves because we don't know what the
[1:02:30] end result of that will be so we want to
[1:02:32] praise God for whatever move he does
[1:02:35] at the same time also understanding how
[1:02:38] is God moving we have to look at the
[1:02:40] long term the word of God is the only
[1:02:44] thing that's going to be our our anchor
[1:02:46] I think about the story brother Brandon
[1:02:48] tells about the men who picked up the
[1:02:49] track where were you spend eternity
[1:02:53] and God's brother says God saved you
[1:02:56] then
[1:02:59] it was in The Message Church he hadn't
[1:03:01] been baptized he didn't even know a lot
[1:03:03] of things about the Bible yet but he
[1:03:05] responded to God and he God and he just
[1:03:08] keeps following following following
[1:03:09] following but it started in some place
[1:03:11] what's the use of putting the tract on
[1:03:14] top of the urinal
[1:03:16] this might have started just right there
[1:03:19] but God can move out every once to and
[1:03:22] when we see mercy and repentance we
[1:03:24] praise we're we're glad about that
[1:03:27] people want a Great Awakening because
[1:03:29] this world's rotten they want a Great
[1:03:31] Awakening they're praying for that just
[1:03:33] like we're praying for that
[1:03:36] but why is it why are they so crying out
[1:03:39] for it
[1:03:40] it's because they haven't recognized the
[1:03:43] awaiting of the Bride there's been a
[1:03:45] Revival and they've missed it and once
[1:03:47] you've turned that down things get dark
[1:03:50] fast it's like oh no it's getting dark
[1:03:52] Lord have mercy have mercy it's getting
[1:03:54] dark they've turned down the real
[1:03:56] Revival and by being a Christian notice
[1:03:59] he still calls them Christians that by
[1:04:02] being a Christian they feel the pull
[1:04:03] over the hour but they haven't
[1:04:05] recognized what's been done that's
[1:04:07] what's making them feel that way they're
[1:04:09] looking for it way off in the future to
[1:04:11] come
[1:04:12] when it's already happened by you that's
[1:04:15] why it's so important to know where are
[1:04:17] we in the plot diagram
[1:04:19] where are you what is God doing so we
[1:04:22] know what to be looking for and
[1:04:24] expecting there
[1:04:25] in the future
[1:04:30] and the message the rising of the sun he
[1:04:32] says what is the opening of those seals
[1:04:34] it's revealing Christ Our bridegroom has
[1:04:37] come back and part of the Rapture is not
[1:04:40] just Christ's coming but the bride going
[1:04:42] and that's what he's come back to take
[1:04:44] us home with him
[1:04:48] and on Page in my middle of page nine I
[1:04:51] don't have this one on the screen but he
[1:04:52] says in the Feast of the trumpets there
[1:04:54] will come a messenger in the last days
[1:04:56] that will guide the people back to the
[1:04:57] first fruits back to the original Faith
[1:04:59] granted Lord that that great messenger
[1:05:02] Among Us now the great Christ the Holy
[1:05:06] Spirit made Vivid
[1:05:08] that sounds like the holy spirit's
[1:05:10] taking on flesh made Vivid for us made
[1:05:13] understanding opening up the word
[1:05:15] revealing to us may he guide them back
[1:05:18] to the original Pentecostal faith
[1:05:22] and works as Faith expressed and in The
[1:05:24] Invisible Union of the church the bride
[1:05:26] to Christ that messenger is here now
[1:05:28] which is Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:05:31] and forever it's talking about a union
[1:05:34] with with him
[1:05:39] and just as we close the latter rain
[1:05:44] is that Harvest drain the Rapture how
[1:05:47] it's going to come the Dynamics of it I
[1:05:49] don't know I just believe it's going to
[1:05:50] come and we're going to be expecting and
[1:05:52] rejoicing when it comes
[1:05:54] but I just want to look at the scripture
[1:05:57] Jesus speaks of paribuses to the
[1:05:59] disciples behold the Fig Tree and all
[1:06:02] the trees I think this is a really neat
[1:06:04] illustration that when the rain falls on
[1:06:07] the just and the unjust all the trees
[1:06:09] will be brought to harvest maturity all
[1:06:12] of them
[1:06:13] and you can look around in our society
[1:06:16] today
[1:06:17] you don't have a lot of people who think
[1:06:19] differently who can work together
[1:06:23] and that's different I think than it was
[1:06:25] half a century ago or longer because
[1:06:29] ideas have come to maturity if you look
[1:06:33] at this acute triangle at the very
[1:06:36] beginning
[1:06:37] they're going different directions but
[1:06:39] the difference isn't that big between
[1:06:41] them so we can work together in more
[1:06:43] bipartisanship or we can we can do more
[1:06:46] together as time goes on these ideas are
[1:06:48] being brought to a maturity you've got
[1:06:50] you've got really woke you've got really
[1:06:52] conservative they're so far apart they
[1:06:55] can't work together and you've got that
[1:06:57] spiritually too you've got seeds that
[1:06:59] were sown denominational seeds and you
[1:07:01] just kind of see man it used to be I
[1:07:03] mean
[1:07:04] 50 years ago 100 years ago you find
[1:07:07] people who really cared on what the
[1:07:09] Bible said
[1:07:10] but you've got a lot of folks who take
[1:07:12] the name of Christ who may not ever open
[1:07:14] the Bible and for them it's just a
[1:07:16] cultural I'm an American and I'm some I
[1:07:20] like to have religious moral feelings
[1:07:22] why I identify as a Christian
[1:07:26] but if you're scratch it doesn't go much
[1:07:29] further than the skin
[1:07:31] and that the church that's based upon
[1:07:34] that seed is going to start allowing
[1:07:35] more and more things it started with
[1:07:37] letting women preach but then it goes
[1:07:40] off into letting homosexual men become
[1:07:43] ministers and letting lesbian women
[1:07:45] becoming it gets further and further all
[1:07:47] of a sudden
[1:07:48] how do we get here
[1:07:50] but that's what Jesus said would happen
[1:07:52] in the Harvest Time let those seeds grow
[1:07:55] and it'll be very clear which is which
[1:07:58] and that's the day that we're living in
[1:08:00] so in this day that we're living in what
[1:08:03] do we need to be impressed by we want to
[1:08:06] be impressed by the word because that's
[1:08:08] our anchor
[1:08:10] whenever we see that that could seem to
[1:08:12] be a move of God do an ID check does it
[1:08:15] really go back to the word or not
[1:08:17] because the wind can be wonderful it
[1:08:19] could be couldn't Quakes throughout the
[1:08:21] land fire could soon be falling
[1:08:24] but what's the teaching how is it
[1:08:27] actually affecting my life because God's
[1:08:29] Not About Numbers
[1:08:31] he's about the character that's being
[1:08:33] brought into the people and it's
[1:08:36] important for us to recognize he says I
[1:08:38] hope your spiritual mind is enough to
[1:08:41] capitalize on these things because we
[1:08:43] don't capitalize on it we're going to
[1:08:45] miss where we are in this story
[1:08:47] and we might not be ready for the next
[1:08:49] move that's going to come capitalize on
[1:08:51] it
[1:08:52] it's a personal relationship with God as
[1:08:54] he becomes flesh
[1:08:57] and he wants to become flesh become
[1:08:58] personal to you
[1:09:01] these love letters coming flesh and
[1:09:04] eventually that ring on the hand or his
[1:09:06] that's what it's all about
[1:09:10] where's Waldo where he's kind of talking
[1:09:11] about Where's God moving today that's
[1:09:14] the one to be able to identify and
[1:09:16] um listen musicians to come
[1:09:19] um getting brother Paula wants to close
[1:09:21] let's let's close with the word of
[1:09:23] Prayer
[1:09:23] heavenly father I thank you
[1:09:25] Lord for the word that you shared in
[1:09:29] these last days father through a prophet
[1:09:31] that helps us to see where we are
[1:09:34] in this story where we are and what
[1:09:36] you're doing and father as I just
[1:09:40] Lord read and I've read and have studied
[1:09:42] this just kind of think
[1:09:44] this is the
[1:09:46] quote we're coming close to a Harvest
[1:09:48] Time where where things are coming to a
[1:09:51] maturity and I and I just close with the
[1:09:54] idea what kind of seeds are we letting
[1:09:57] into our hearts because whatever we
[1:09:59] bring into our hearts
[1:10:00] we'll be blessed by that
[1:10:02] Harvest rain that will bring things to
[1:10:04] maturity but do I want every single
[1:10:07] thought that's coming into my heart
[1:10:08] to come into a maturity
[1:10:11] Lord I pray o God that you would help us
[1:10:13] to
[1:10:14] to grid up the loins of our mind Lord to
[1:10:17] to watch out what we're what we're
[1:10:20] impressed with
[1:10:23] Lord I pray that we would be
[1:10:25] impressed with
[1:10:27] or just a a simple man who who walked
[1:10:31] the shores of Galilee 2000 years ago
[1:10:34] nothing really had Isaiah 53 there's
[1:10:38] nothing in him that we could really be
[1:10:39] impressed with he's just a simple man
[1:10:41] and so many people on that day missed it
[1:10:44] just like today
[1:10:46] brother Branham comes
[1:10:48] he can't carry a tune to carry a bucket
[1:10:51] but he sings and Praises God and he's
[1:10:55] not educated he preaches a rough gospel
[1:10:57] but that's what you sent so we'd be
[1:11:00] restored to that original Faith oh God
[1:11:04] and Lord I know that it can be easy
[1:11:06] because of things we might have
[1:11:08] experienced in the past
[1:11:10] to build up complexes against the very
[1:11:13] thing that you've sinned to prepare us
[1:11:15] to leave this place and Lord I just pray
[1:11:18] that you would with your spirit go to
[1:11:20] each heart even now father and Lord you
[1:11:23] just cut those things down or any wall
[1:11:26] that we might have built up Lord I pray
[1:11:28] that you would take that down Brick by
[1:11:31] Brick Stone by Stone
[1:11:34] so Lord we can stand there and realize
[1:11:36] the one that I've tried to protect
[1:11:38] myself from is
[1:11:40] become flesh because he loves me and he
[1:11:43] wants to become flesh to me and know me
[1:11:45] personally Lord but we just yes step
[1:11:48] around our wall and Lord
[1:11:53] throw our arms around him have him throw
[1:11:55] our arms around us or just Embrace him
[1:11:57] Lord and I pray o God that this could
[1:11:59] lead to a or an embracing of Truth like
[1:12:02] never before Oh God
[1:12:04] a real Revival in our heart that anchors
[1:12:08] deep Lord that's not put on but that's
[1:12:10] completely genuine because it's your
[1:12:12] seat it's nothing that we produce
[1:12:14] nothing that we've got to be good enough
[1:12:16] do this or that or whatever we just
[1:12:18] receive your word we receive your word
[1:12:21] Lord I pray for a holy hunger Lord
[1:12:25] father we bless you Lord we love you oh
[1:12:28] God lord I pray for that Revival in our
[1:12:31] hearts father that we would hunger after
[1:12:33] you Lord father we would desire your
[1:12:36] word more than our necessary food Lord
[1:12:39] that we would see father you would also
[1:12:41] anoint our eyes with isap that we could
[1:12:43] really see Lord a week it's so easy to
[1:12:46] see I'm I'm rich increased with Goods
[1:12:48] nothing but no Lord we need you help us
[1:12:51] Lord to see how much we need you and
[1:12:53] open our arms wide our hearts wiser that
[1:12:56] we can be filled
[1:12:58] in Jesus Christ name we pray
[1:13:04] stand this thing to open our eyes
