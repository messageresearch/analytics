[6:51] [Music]
[6:54] promis Matthew 25 and
[6:56] verse1 then shall the kingdom of heaven
[6:59] be likened unto 10 virgins which took
[7:02] their lamps and went forth to meet the
[7:05] bridegroom and five of them were wise
[7:07] and five were
[7:09] foolish they that were foolish foolish
[7:12] took their lamps and took no oil with
[7:16] them but the wise took oil in their
[7:18] vessels with their lamps while the
[7:21] bridegroom carried they all slumbered
[7:23] and slept so you notice that the
[7:25] bridegroom coming there was a delay in
[7:28] his coming or there was a a a temporary
[7:30] tearing that took place I believe we
[7:33] live during that time while the
[7:34] bridegroom tarried they all slumbered
[7:36] and slept and at midnight there was a
[7:38] cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go
[7:41] ye out to meet him then all those
[7:43] virgins arose and trim their lamps so
[7:46] all the virgins arose by the Midnight
[7:49] Cry that we're getting close and the
[7:50] bridegroom is coming all of them arose
[7:52] and we're were're stirred by that and
[7:55] the foolish said unto the wise give us
[7:57] of your oil for our lamps have gone out
[8:00] but the wise answered saying not so lest
[8:02] there be not enough for us and you but
[8:06] go rather to them that sell and buy for
[8:09] yourselves and while they went to buy
[8:11] the bridegroom came and they that were
[8:14] ready went in with him to the marriage
[8:17] and the door was shut afterward came
[8:20] also the other virgin saying Lord Lord
[8:22] open to us but he answered instead
[8:25] verily I say unto you I know you not
[8:28] watch therefore for ye know neither the
[8:31] day nor the hour wherein the son of man
[8:34] cometh Matthew 24 and
[8:37] 25 in the Bible we have Jesus giving the
[8:40] prophecy of the 2,000 years after he is
[8:43] gone and particularly their prophecies
[8:46] and specifics about the end time and
[8:49] this is why these scriptures should be
[8:50] very important to us and any Christian
[8:53] really should be uh interested in
[8:55] Matthew 24 and 25 as Jesus begins to
[8:58] break really the Seven Seals uh in his
[9:01] own way in the way he did it John has
[9:03] the Seven Seals and by Vision at the
[9:06] Book of Revelations but Jesus actually
[9:08] Expresses in Matthew
[9:10] 24-25 uh all Seven Seals and you can
[9:12] take what he says and and put it place
[9:15] it right on the seals in the Book of
[9:16] Revelations and so he's he's elaborating
[9:19] and speaking Prophecy of the specifics
[9:22] of will what will happen in the end time
[9:25] and when you get to the very end though
[9:27] which is what we live in when you get
[9:29] get to the very end because he had just
[9:31] said a few scriptures earlier he said no
[9:34] man knows the day or the hour no man
[9:36] knows the day or the hour this is a
[9:38] secret that God the final end the final
[9:40] hour the final time of his coming he
[9:43] keeps it a secret only the father knows
[9:46] and so it's not something that he would
[9:48] reveal and make it plain here because
[9:51] that's something that's only going to be
[9:52] revealed in Rapture time it's only going
[9:55] to be revealed to the to the to the
[9:57] bride in other words this isn't
[9:58] something something that everybody will
[10:00] know and because they know what they can
[10:02] be a part of this will be the secret
[10:04] part and so the seventh seal will be a
[10:06] secret which is the coming of the Lord
[10:09] don't get lost in the terminology here I
[10:11] want to explain it so even a 13-year-old
[10:13] can understand this morning Jesus is
[10:15] speaking of all the end time events but
[10:17] when we get to the very end then he
[10:20] breaks in Matthew 25 he breaks into
[10:22] Parables for the seventh seal so and he
[10:25] had to do that because that's the one
[10:27] that's Secret that's the one that's
[10:30] hidden and so all the others he's being
[10:32] specific about but when he breaks into
[10:34] the seventh that's when you find Matthew
[10:36] 25 and that's when you find the seventh
[10:38] seal hidden in Parables but how many
[10:40] knows that Jesus said about Parables
[10:42] when he was asked by the disciples why
[10:44] do you speak in Parables he said because
[10:46] it's given unto you to know the
[10:48] mysteries of God it's not given to
[10:50] everybody but it's given to you so if he
[10:53] breaks into Parables for the seven seal
[10:56] I'll tell you our curiosity ought to our
[10:58] we ought to be sitting at the the edge
[10:59] of our seat saying what does this mean
[11:01] cuz this is where I live right now I'm
[11:03] at the end time God's not called me to
[11:05] Luther's day or Wesley's day he's called
[11:07] me to write at the closing seconds of
[11:09] time and I want to catch this mystery of
[11:11] what God's doing so now the first
[11:14] Parable in Matthew 25 is very revealing
[11:18] as it covers virgins starting a journey
[11:22] toward meeting the bridegroom well
[11:23] that's perfect because we know at the
[11:25] end of the book there's a marriage we
[11:27] know enough scriptures to know that
[11:29] there's a marriage between Christ and
[11:30] his bride so now in the parable it's
[11:32] perfect because you have virgins
[11:34] starting a journey toward meeting the
[11:37] bridegroom they start not the rest of
[11:38] the world but these virgins these
[11:40] sanctified people these Christians they
[11:42] say my it's time for the bridegroom to
[11:45] come and so there's a call go ye out to
[11:47] meet him and I'm going to begin this
[11:49] journey and this of course uh so the
[11:51] children understand the bridegroom is a
[11:54] type of Christ that's Christ and then
[11:57] there's not one virgin but there's 10
[11:59] virgins and why why wouldn't you say
[12:00] well there's just one because usually a
[12:02] man marries just one woman in this
[12:04] Parable there's 10 virgins because we
[12:07] are a many membered bride it's not just
[12:09] one person but we're a many membered
[12:11] bride so that's why it says 10 has many
[12:14] can you say Amen so showing it will be a
[12:17] many membered bride not one person it's
[12:19] perfect because at the end there is a
[12:22] marriage spoken of throughout the Bible
[12:24] and I'll just say these things Paul said
[12:26] I have espoused you to one husband he
[12:28] starting to use the term he said I've
[12:31] come and brought the message Paul said
[12:33] and I've espoused you there's an
[12:35] engagement and I've espouse you not to
[12:38] many husbands but to one husband so
[12:40] there's a marriage going to take place
[12:42] there's a courtship there's an
[12:43] engagement and there's a marriage in the
[12:46] end time supposed to take place and so
[12:48] then we uh then we find that Paul uh
[12:51] said I have espouse you to one husband
[12:52] he also said in Ephesians that God would
[12:55] have a glorious bride without spot
[12:58] without wrinkle he will prepare himself
[13:00] a spotless bride to Mary and she'll be
[13:04] without blemish how many's familiar with
[13:06] that scripture so that he will provide
[13:08] the atonement to sanctify this bride and
[13:12] he sanctifies her so that he can marry
[13:14] her it's almost like creating your
[13:16] virginity because we know in our flesh
[13:19] we weren't born virgins we were born
[13:20] with a sin nature but by the power of
[13:23] the word he creates our virginity and
[13:25] shows us what we were from the
[13:26] foundation of the world that before came
[13:29] in the picture I was in the mind of God
[13:31] thus I'm a virgin unto the Lord because
[13:33] he Sanctified my
[13:35] life that's power friends when you're
[13:38] creating
[13:39] virginity but he says I'll wash her I'll
[13:42] make her a spotless bride before I
[13:43] married so then he he she will be a
[13:46] virgin and then when you go to the Book
[13:49] of Revelations it says the marriage of
[13:51] the Lamb has come and the bride hath
[13:54] made herself
[13:56] ready praise be to God lay some
[13:59] foundational things that at the end it's
[14:01] about a
[14:02] marriage at the end time it's about a
[14:05] spiritual union with you and
[14:09] Christ that's what it's about that's
[14:11] what the parable speaks of and so now
[14:13] the marriage has come bride have made
[14:15] herself ready the end time is not you
[14:17] know it's about a marriage it's not
[14:18] about a it's not about a a a dating
[14:21] relationship with
[14:23] Christ when it gets to the end it's not
[14:26] this casual dating of Christ Christ or a
[14:29] part-time onag again off again
[14:32] relationship with Jesus Christ can I get
[14:35] an amen am you may be God maybe have
[14:38] winked at your ignorance in past days
[14:40] about that but not today we're not
[14:41] called to a dating relationship we're
[14:43] not called to to to come in relationship
[14:46] at at a camp meeting with them and get
[14:48] all stirred up and then we we deny them
[14:50] later while we're at school we're not
[14:52] called to a dating relationship we're
[14:54] not called to a a a clicking uh on again
[14:57] off of it I'm in a relationship you
[15:00] click the button and you're in a
[15:01] relationship two weeks later you unclick
[15:03] say I'm out of a relationship that's not
[15:05] that's this generation how they go about
[15:08] relationships might as well take a
[15:10] minute and say this generation has
[15:12] cheapened relationship has cheapened
[15:14] marriage has cheapened
[15:16] commitment friends are not committed
[15:19] anymore within a drop of the Hat
[15:20] somebody drops a friendship there's no
[15:22] loyalty can you because it's an
[15:24] adulterous generation and nobody's loyal
[15:27] to one husband or one one spouse or one
[15:29] person for life completely for life it's
[15:32] in and out if I Don't Feel Like Loving
[15:34] in you anymore I'll just drop out of the
[15:36] relationship I'll just divorce you it's
[15:38] a divorce generation and spiritually
[15:41] it's a divorce generation cuz people go
[15:43] to a camp meeting go to a meeting they
[15:45] they give themelves okay I'm all excited
[15:47] and then all of a sudden they're right
[15:48] back to the things of the world that's
[15:49] not a marriage
[15:51] relationship I'm going to preach this
[15:53] morning that's not a marriage
[15:55] relationship in the end time it's not a
[15:58] dating Rel relationship it's not an on
[16:00] again off again I kind of come and go as
[16:03] I and Comm and people approach church
[16:05] that way as well if it's convenient for
[16:08] me if it fits around all all of my
[16:10] schedule then I'll be there but no I
[16:14] this is a marriage can you say Amen this
[16:16] is not about church attendance this is a
[16:18] union between you and Christ there's two
[16:21] groups one wise and one foolish that's
[16:24] right that's what the word of God says
[16:27] but notice all the virgins all started
[16:32] out on a journey to go meet the
[16:35] bridegroom all heard the Midnight Cry
[16:40] Now friends I'm telling you this Parable
[16:42] is not talking about out
[16:45] there it's pretty
[16:48] internal because they're all hearing the
[16:51] Midnight Cry now it's time go you out to
[16:54] meet him possibly sitting in the same
[16:56] group hearing the same preaching
[17:01] all were stirred out of their sleeping
[17:04] all were stirred up by the word by the
[17:06] Midnight Cry all of them got up and were
[17:09] woke awoken by the cry all of them got
[17:12] up and all of them trimmed their
[17:16] lamps which is part of the process
[17:18] spiritually trimming the lamps you can
[17:20] have a lamp a vessel and and the vessel
[17:23] speaks of Your Vessel for the Lord this
[17:25] vessel and so you can have a vessel but
[17:28] you see you've got a a a wick in there
[17:30] if you guys want to show that picture of
[17:32] uh just so we have a visual for the
[17:34] young people and everybody else uh this
[17:36] is kind of what it looked like back in
[17:37] Jerusalem the days of Jerusalem this is
[17:38] kind of what it looked like and this is
[17:40] what he's speaking of in the parable is
[17:42] that you got a vessel you got the oil in
[17:44] the vessel and then you got something
[17:45] sticking out the wick sticking out the
[17:47] end and this is type of thing if you
[17:48] didn't uh and maybe some of you know
[17:50] this most people know this if you don't
[17:52] keep that trimmed at the end it won't
[17:54] burn bright like that and if it doesn't
[17:57] burn bright in the darkness you won't be
[18:00] able to see right so there's some
[18:02] components there and for the parable all
[18:05] the components are there as far as
[18:07] trimming the lamps they Rose it's dark
[18:09] out it's midnight it's become gross
[18:11] Darkness upon the people it's a dark
[18:13] time how many how many would say say I
[18:16] in the last two years we're living in
[18:18] darker times I'm feeling it in my
[18:21] spirit if you got any God about you you
[18:24] know this is different now we're in
[18:25] different territory this is dark dark
[18:28] times we're living in it's not like 30
[18:30] years ago when we tend to camps and went
[18:31] to meetings this is a darkness that is
[18:33] set into us people are questioning where
[18:36] they stand people are fighting mind
[18:38] battles can you say Amen we're in a
[18:40] different time which lets us know we
[18:43] need to trim our lamps we need the oil
[18:46] like we've never needed it before we
[18:49] need to be established and know that we
[18:51] have a reserve of oil back can you say
[18:54] Amen or we won't make it through this
[18:57] Darkness oh Darkness Darkness Darkness
[19:00] so much out there if you don't know it's
[19:02] really getting more more dark you better
[19:05] get on your feet and Rec
[19:07] recognize there's Darkness rights I've
[19:09] been a Christian since I was 16 years
[19:11] old and I have never since in the last
[19:14] two years watch gross Darkness take even
[19:17] some Christians
[19:18] life and they start to it's unstable
[19:22] don't know where they stand and I don't
[19:24] have a hatred towards that I'm just
[19:26] saying oh God what's the answer answer
[19:29] right I can tell you this sermon I
[19:31] preached this morning couldn't get away
[19:33] from it about a month ago I got this
[19:35] note in my Bible and it just says the
[19:38] last minute Discovery is that you don't
[19:40] have enough
[19:42] oil that's what this sermon comes this
[19:44] isn't just some concocted thing this is
[19:47] what God told me to preach on this
[19:50] morning every individual needs to be
[19:53] established and know that they have the
[19:55] reserve there's nothing more important
[19:57] than the oil your money your job your
[20:00] career your
[20:02] house anything your boyfriend nothing
[20:05] nothing is more important than God
[20:07] they're all stirred up they get up they
[20:09] trim their lamps all the same group
[20:11] doing all the same things now maybe
[20:13] wearing all the same
[20:16] things but something happens they
[20:19] started a journey towards the Lord all
[20:22] together towards the
[20:24] bridegroom but without this group was
[20:27] without
[20:28] the most important thing they began the
[20:31] journey without the most important thing
[20:34] and the discovery was I don't have
[20:36] enough to finish the journey I don't
[20:38] have enough to make it through to make
[20:41] the journey and to finish it and we
[20:43] learn from this Parable if you don't
[20:44] learn anything else the tragic end I I
[20:48] read to you the rest but the tragic end
[20:50] to starting a journey without the most
[20:53] important thing start it's better to
[20:56] start and if there's discovery that I
[20:59] don't have what I need you can start
[21:01] today you can start right now God I want
[21:03] to start this journey all over because I
[21:05] realize I didn't start it the right way
[21:07] the most important thing is for me to
[21:09] seek the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[21:11] his oil in my
[21:14] life and be honest about that because
[21:16] there's many coming to me and
[21:18] discovering discovering and I say praise
[21:20] God you're discovering this now it's
[21:22] time to lay the right foundations and
[21:24] say I'm praying for one thing in my life
[21:27] and that's the oil
[21:28] they started the journey towards the
[21:30] Lord and realized they couldn't finish
[21:32] the journey because they didn't have
[21:35] enough
[21:36] oil if you were to trying to think of an
[21:39] example an illustration and I guess it's
[21:41] any kind of Journey I guess you could
[21:43] plan a camping trip and you're going to
[21:45] go across the country and maybe meet
[21:47] someone special at the end of the trip
[21:49] maybe somebody special in California or
[21:51] Arizona I've got a lot of special
[21:53] friends in in Arizona but you're going
[21:55] to meet someone at the end but you got a
[21:56] month of and you're going to make it a
[21:58] camping trip you're going to need a lot
[21:59] of things for that camping trip
[22:01] especially if you don't have all the
[22:02] conveniences of life you're going to
[22:03] have to think it through you got to have
[22:05] what you need and you're going to be in
[22:07] the wilderness if you go across the
[22:08] country you're going to be in the
[22:09] wilderness you're going to need things
[22:10] you're going to need food with you
[22:12] because if you're going in the
[22:13] wilderness you don't have a place just
[22:15] to conveniently go buy food you're going
[22:17] to need food you're going to need snacks
[22:19] I bring a lot of snacks when I do things
[22:21] when I go overseas I can't eat the food
[22:23] very much so one of my suitcases is full
[22:25] of
[22:26] snacks you're going to need things
[22:29] you're going to need to think about this
[22:30] trip and this journey what do I need
[22:32] what's essential for this journey
[22:35] towards the
[22:37] Lord you better think it through so I
[22:40] need my food I need my I need lots of
[22:43] stuff I need snacks Twinkies whatever I
[22:45] need to you know and you're going to
[22:47] need some warm clothes because it's
[22:48] going to get cold on the
[22:50] journey
[22:54] money probably not very much hallelujah
[22:57] amen
[22:58] he caught
[23:01] it cuz you're not going to be around
[23:03] Walmart you're not going to be you're
[23:04] going to be in the wilderness you're
[23:06] going to be around lots of stuff but
[23:09] you're going to give be so your money is
[23:11] really no good and I can tell you I can
[23:13] tell you that where we're going in this
[23:15] marriage with the bridegroom your money
[23:17] doesn't really mean anything you can't
[23:19] buy your way into this your retirement
[23:22] that you have set up God bless you but
[23:24] don't you ever let that be a security
[23:26] our security has to to be in the Lord
[23:29] today and this kind of Journey Through
[23:31] the Wilderness your money is no really
[23:33] no
[23:34] good Your Nest Egg isn't really any good
[23:37] I've had Brothers come and say I had a
[23:39] nest egg for 20 years and now the
[23:41] economy now it's gone it's finished it
[23:43] can be gone just like that friends I've
[23:45] said it over and over again we cannot
[23:48] put our trust in worldly Goods or
[23:50] worldly things or houses or lands we
[23:53] can't put our trust in governments or
[23:55] any of these things we have one place
[23:58] especially right now to cling to and
[24:00] make sure we stay filled it's about the
[24:03] holy spirit it's about walking in his
[24:05] spirit it's about remaining filled with
[24:07] the spirit it's about getting of the
[24:09] Holy Spirit if we don't have it it's all
[24:11] about the oil in the last
[24:16] days it's about the oil you get your
[24:18] warm clothes you you know you get lots
[24:21] of stuff and then you think you will
[24:24] you're supposed to think you will have
[24:26] 12 hours usually out of that that day
[24:28] that it's going to be completely dark
[24:30] and so you won't have any light so you
[24:33] have to think about light you're going
[24:35] to need light you're going to need
[24:38] flashlights I'm being practical so you
[24:41] understand if you forgot the flashlights
[24:44] and you're going a month 12 hour hours
[24:47] out of your day is going to be complete
[24:48] pitch darkness is anybody catching your
[24:51] spiritual
[24:52] journey and anybody catching the
[24:54] Midnight Hour that you live in The
[24:56] Darkest Hour the midnight hour you're
[24:58] going to need light you're going to need
[25:01] flashlights and guess what what if you
[25:03] went and you had flashlights but you
[25:05] didn't bring the energy for the
[25:06] flashlight oh forgot the batteries that
[25:09] would be me on a camping
[25:12] trip but when you think about being in
[25:14] the dark for 12 hours and the Animals
[25:17] because that's another thing to think
[25:18] about the vicious animals that come out
[25:20] of the woods and you you're going to in
[25:22] and snakes and all these other things
[25:24] you got to think that you're going to
[25:25] have to have some weapon against the an
[25:27] animal you're going to have to have some
[25:29] protection can you say Amen so you're
[25:31] thinking this through of head because on
[25:33] this journey and it's so true to the
[25:36] Christian Journey it's not going to be
[25:37] at Walmart it's going to be a Wilderness
[25:40] you're going to have dark times can you
[25:41] say Amen you're going to have vicious
[25:43] animals come at you you're going to have
[25:45] vicious people come after you it's going
[25:47] to be a journey that's not
[25:50] perfect so you need the essential
[25:53] things and one of the most essential
[25:56] things you'll need in the darkness is
[25:57] light is light I want you guys to keep
[25:59] that up because I want that image to be
[26:01] in their minds today in the
[26:02] congregation's mind this is what it is
[26:04] you can trim your lamps it can be
[26:06] Burning Brightly but I can tell you if
[26:08] that vessel is depleted or that vessel
[26:11] never got oil to begin with none of this
[26:13] is going to work right and you're going
[26:15] to be traveling through the darkness
[26:17] with juice you in your own energy and
[26:19] I'm telling you you can't make it in
[26:21] this
[26:24] hour without the
[26:26] oil
[26:29] Hallelujah can't make a marriage without
[26:31] the
[26:32] oil can't have a family without the oil
[26:36] can't be a young person strong in the
[26:37] Lord without the
[26:39] oil this came to me also when I was
[26:41] speaking a few weeks ago to the young
[26:43] people about a strong young man that can
[26:46] that can stand against a weak girl a
[26:48] strong girl that can stand against a
[26:50] weak Boy or the wrong kind of boy it's
[26:52] strength God is calling for strength in
[26:54] this hour in young people God's calling
[26:56] for strength in the congregation where
[26:58] does that strength come from the oil the
[27:00] Holy
[27:01] Spirit that's where it originates from
[27:04] it's that your vessel is got a reserve
[27:06] of the oil that's where we become strong
[27:09] in the Lord so on this journey let me
[27:11] finish this monthlong trip to meet
[27:13] someone special you need batteries
[27:16] because batteries would be the essential
[27:18] thing tied to the light that's going to
[27:20] shine to keep you through the darkness
[27:22] it's energy to fuel the light and the
[27:25] Holy Ghost the holy spirit is the the
[27:27] only energy God has provided in order
[27:30] for you to have a light to make it
[27:32] through this Darkness there is no other
[27:34] psychology there is no other source to
[27:37] go to can you say Amen there is no other
[27:39] doctor God has provided it in the oil
[27:42] can you say
[27:43] Amen in this Dark Hour nothing will make
[27:47] this journey or finish this journey
[27:49] without the oil of the Holy Spirit and
[27:52] they didn't have enough because they
[27:53] didn't why didn't they have enough when
[27:55] they started they didn't make it a
[27:57] priority when they
[27:58] started and to every Christian the holy
[28:03] spirit is what we should make more
[28:06] important than anything else in our
[28:08] lives thank you for watching our message
