you today [Music] scared Oh I thought I knew scared now I'm so filled with fear that I can barely move [Music] and out I've had my share of doubt but never more than right now [Music] wondering where are you and here on the edge somehow your promises [Music] and this is the truth I'm standing on even when all my strength is gone you are faithful forever I know you'll never let me fall so right now

gone you are faithful forever Lord I know you'll never let me fall you'll never let me fall right now I'm I'm choosing to believe that someday sooner I'll look back and see all the pain had a purpose your plans be perfect all along this is the truth I'm standing on cause you are my rock my shield my firm foundation I know I will not be shaking this is where my help comes from this is the truth I'm standing on even when all my strength is gone you are faithful forever I know you'll never let me fall oh to believe someday soon I'll look back and see all the pain had a purpose your plan was perfect all alone this is the truth I'm standing on 13 verse 31 therefore when he was gone out and he's speaking of Judas when he left the room when Judas went out Jesus said now is the son of man glorified and God is glorified in him if God be glorified in him God should also God shall also glorify him in himself and shall straightway glorify him um it's a it's a couple of mysterious scriptures and for years you read these things and you try to ponder them and you look at them and as you grow in the Lord they become more and more clear but it's always been puzzling to me just how all that is worded we know we know Jesus gave glory to the father we know Jesus gave glory to God in his life he always glorified God but then now he says now the he's asking the father to come and glorify him and so he goes on if you skip over to John 17 he's speaking of the same thing when he says in John 17 and verse 1 and 2 these words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son Also may glorify thee so he's echoing this again as thou Hast given him Power Over All Flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou has given him and this is eternal life that they may Know Thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent so this glorifying of the son is related to giving eternal life to as many as outgiven him remember last Sunday eternal life is living for others and when Jesus said that Greater Works will you do he said to the church The Works that I'm doing you will do also Everything Jesus is doing he can repeat through his body but then he says greater works for you do when we found out last Sunday what's Greater Works than all the miracle signs and wonders that Jesus did he said the greater work is not somebody's healed of cancer or something the Greater Works is that you have the power to impart eternal life to someone else because having eternal life is greater than physically being healed temporarily the church has power to do that Jesus said it amen so then he's in the subject of being glorified and the last one is John 17 if you wouldn't mind in verse 21. he says that they all may be one as thou father art in me he's praying for the church here his Believers before he leaves that they all may be one as thou father art in me and I in thee that they may also may be one in us that the world may believe that the thou has sent me and the glory which thou gavest me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one so now the next step is that the Glo he had the glory of the of the of God in his life and now he says Lord the glory that we have and the Oneness that we have I want them to have that Glory too in them so now I in them verse 23 and thou and me that they may be perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them as thou has loved me when this Glory comes it will bring true Oneness when this Glory comes in the church it will bring true Oneness and remember it's not a one-night event because Paul says we are changed from glory to glory to glory and the more Glory we get the more one we should become I feel the Lord leading me to go into relationships a little bit and talk about them but I have probably more questions than I have answers right now in talking about relationships I think it's a very important subject I think that we can't talk about it enough and so when we talked about those the Betrayal that Jesus experienced then we realize that we experience betrayal as well and the effect that it has on human beings is really pretty strong sometimes when we are betrayed when we are abandoned when we are neglected sometimes it happens when we're children in fact most of the time it happens when we're children you know we can have the best of parents but no parent is perfect and parents have different issues and different things they're learning as they go along but then you have the extreme situations where a child was actually abandoned a child was neglected and these have a a long-term effect on human beings we don't deal with betrayal very well we don't do deal with abandonment very well so when we we when we come into that I wanted to learn from Jesus life as he come to the final hours of his life I was looking at Jesus and how he reacted to betrayal because as I said there's no man that's ever been betrayed like Jesus was there's no man who has lost his friends like Jesus was at the end in the time when he needed friends in the time he needed support in the time he needed commitment from his disciples in the time that he needed his friends the most that's when they all abandoned him his closest friends even Peter James and John who who trusted many times as being exclusive to bring in a room to pray for a dead man or a dead girl and raise him to life he had he had close friendships with these men and when the end when it was all said and done there was a betrayal of every one of they all forsook him they all left him and some of them screaming out in their loyalty to him I would never leave you Jesus I would never leave you and he said Peter before the crows you'll deny me three times and so human energy and human commitment wasn't enough and so the loneliness that he experienced the Betrayal I feel I feel oh Lord Is it true that you ended your life and come to the end with no one there you were completely alone is it to my heart but just rejoices in the Lord and goes out to the Lord today that he would experience that but don't forget our Lord had to experience everything that we experienced our Lord had to go through every Temptation that we're tempted by the Bible said he was tempted at all points as we are and tempted by a sexual lust tempted by all the things we think well Jesus never experienced that no in order to be a high priest he had to go through everything people say well why do you have to be born a baby and go through the teenage years why didn't why couldn't he just come as a lamb at 33 years old old and go right to Calvary because he had to be born a baby and go through every life situation go through his teenage years so that when you go to pray he understands what you're going through when a teenager is lonely and crying out to God he understands because he was a teenager as well our Lord had to be the right he was a Kinsmen Redeemer Redeemer but he had to be a right faithful high priest who had lived out every area of your life can somebody say Amen can somebody raise your hand and say my Lord went through every season of life that's why I love him so much can you say Amen but betrayal he went through betrayal and being abandoned and he went through loneliness more than any other human being has ever went through before and he didn't deserve that he didn't deserve to lose his friends but you see Jesus I'm watching him because he did not get into these mully grubs of this victim mentality he didn't close himself off he didn't say I'm finished with everybody he said he didn't say I'm not going to Calvary and he had the choice to leave it all and say I can't believe I've been abandoned I'm going to go live my own life he had the choice and yet when he was abandoned and betrayed he made the decision to head straight towards Calvary I'm learning something from his life that he didn't become a victim mentality even though he was falsely accused he said I'm not going to let this get to me because I understand why they're doing this maybe he doesn't understand all of it but he had to understand I see this I see the big picture and it's amazing to me I've got to finish in this area but he says it's amazing to me to see Jesus came into something that not only endured the mistreatment of the Betrayal and the mistreatment of Judas and the mistreatment of his own disciples but he kept walking towards the sacrifice and death that would correct the core problem in human beings all right I thought I'd need to say that one again Jesus made the choice in that betrayal to keep walking towards the sacrifice now I'm going to preach about relationships you better be listening real close Jesus when he was betrayed made the choice to walk towards sacrifice and a death to himself that would correct the core problem that's in human beings and any other choice wouldn't have been the victory and the freedom that we sang about this morning freedom to worship freedom to dance you can't even do that or sing that unless he went to Calvary for you can I get an amen this morning unless some you couldn't even come back into relationship with God to talk to him this morning unless somebody made a sacrifice for your life unless somebody said I'm headed to Calvary anyway I'm gonna do it alone but for the future of these people for the future of relationship I'm going to go the hard way I'm going to go the Via Dolorosa I'm gonna go to Calvary I'm going to go to the death because I know that will be their victory over this betraying spirit over this thing that says I'm going to deny you I'm going to put my wall up I'm going to become an island I'm going to go by myself Jesus said the only way to solve that is to go to Calvary and sacrifice so that I break down the middle wall of partition between man and God you talk about walls up people had a wall towards God and God had a wall towards them he did yeah because you and sin you're born in sin you're unacceptable to God but I did so much and I gave so much to the United Way without Calvary in the blood you're unacceptable to God it's not your good works that make you a Christian and so to break down the middle wall of partition to Break Down The Walls between God and man there had to be a sacrifice made you'll never have better relationships until sacrifices are made until humility comes in to restore the relationship with God Lost In the Garden of Eden and to restore Oneness and relationship between God and man to bring back ultimate Oneness which is what Jesus is speaking him and the father were one and he says I pray that they would become with us as we are one and then I pray that they would become one with one another now this is a prayer over the church before he left this is a prophecy how many believe that if anybody's prayer is going to be answered it could be Jesus prayer you may think God's not answering your prayer but God always answers prayer whether it's yes or no but I can tell you one thing there's no doubt Jesus prayer is going to be heard and you know what his prayer is here that they may be one as We Are One that they would come to True Oneness not through a denomination not through a mechanical legislative thing not through a World Council of churches no no no no no they're going to use that scripture by the way they're gonna the the Church systems are using this scripture that we all become one all the denominations they Nations but sure they're not allowed to use that mechanically it's God that will make us one with one another it's the holy God house glory be to God it's only by the Holy Ghost [Applause] that the church becomes one it's actually when we break down our denominational barriers that God and by the only by the Holy Ghost one Spirit do we become one it's only by the glory of God and so now questions you know there's questions about relationships that I've had I trust you're not offended by this but the things that I ask why under this great restoration message is family relationships still lacking why does someone say that they have a relationship with God and still have their walls up and their grudges to certain ones and favor others within the church am I allowed to ask questions I don't even know s but I'm asking God why is this happening why why why why does uh why is it that when someone repents The Grudge is still held against them for years why can some talk so religious and be so seemed so close to God but have years of unresolved issues with their children and their wife has everybody left the building foreign I don't mean this I don't mean this isn't in this is 33 years of pastoring and a lot of these questions I ask myself because I've seen these breakdowns in my response to relationships I'm just asking the questions I'm asking you to take take them home with you and consider it why is it someone repents and The Grudge is still held for years why can some talk show religious online on the internet close to God but have years of unresolved issues with children unforgiving Spirit why can someone preach that's one in a certain category why does that happen why do people say they are a Christian and look for reasons to separate from the body of Christ why are families sometimes completely locked up maybe because there's a secret rule in the family we don't talk about that don't talk about that children we don't talk about that we don't go there why are family is locked up because of it and a lot of times Daddy's locked them up and realize he's doing it I'm talking about relationships I'm saying that if if we have been restored in a full Back to Eden relationship unhindered because remember Oneness intimacy that Adam and Eve had with God intimacy is a relationship without walls and there's you can talk about anything because there's no walls up between you that's real intimacy so how many marriages are married having relations and you know what I'm talking about but no intimacy the walls have been up for years we don't talk about that we don't go there he's hiding something or she's hiding something or the children are hiding something and nobody's allowed to talk about it's got the family all locked up trying to come to church and raise their hands and trying to be free and there's no talk about it there's no openness there's no open honest conversations if all the walls are up listen I I'm interested in a gospel and a message that is preached that brings Deliverance not just here at church and not just to help your relationship with God but that can trickle down into our families and our relationships God please bring the reality of the blood of Jesus Christ to the people so why why why my so many wives I could go on all day with the wise I have I have a million of them but you know that's that's kind of staying on the negative we'd all be pretty depressed when I if I spent this whole service on why how do I get to the Y's I want to get to the answers I want to get to some victories you probably got a million wise you can tell me why the question is is that how come relationships aren't better if Jesus said this effect will affect marriages will affect families if this is bringing us back to Eden then where's the proof of it now not let's not be so negative because we see some families that grow and marriages will grow you're sitting amongst people that marriages were restored that was impossible they shouldn't even be sitting there together today today but by God's grace and the blood of Jesus Christ they're sitting together and their marriage has been restored Satan has of the godhead more than any other truth he has messed with it he hates Satan he hates this teaching that Christ could be the fullness Christ could be the fullness of God in flesh Satan hates this why does Satan hate this that actually the God could pour himself the completion of himself tore himself completely in a human being Jesus Christ Satan hates that he doesn't like that I'm going to tell you in a minute why he's been exposed we know why he's jealous of why he doesn't like it but he is the thought that God could dwell in humans in perfect Oneness so here's two things that God could be in Jesus Christ in his fullness but that God by Spirit could dwell in the human beings I'm not talking about a relationship where we just say I'm trying to be like Jesus and I'm trying to be like the father and I've I've I've uh I've adjusted myself to be a better person to be like Jesus and so I'm trying to be like the father and father that's not the relationship friends the relationship is by Spirit by spirit that his own spirit is living within you that is how we're one Satan is messing with relationship what's he really doing he's limiting this thing that says man and God can become one in a close relationship I'm going to make it about titles I'm going to make it about positions that's why I can't stand it where people are more about position even in coming to church they're more about what position they hold than about Christ and they'll make dishes it's based upon positions and I listen friends this is about relationship this isn't about rules this isn't about positions this is about who's who Jesus dissolved that when he washed the disciples feet when he said wash one another's feet you know what is dissolving positions because the guy that's on the top is going to wash the stinky dirty feet of the lowest guy in the congregation Jesus dissolved all positions praise the Lord I'm having a good time today even if you're hesitant of where I'm going sick messing with relationship no I'm going to limit being that close to say that I'm one with God and I'm taking on his name and I through the Holy Ghost I'm going to become one with the Lord I'm going to limit it make it titles that our attention is on the titles rather than the man you know my children I'm a father I'm a son and I'm a husband but I have a connection with my children I don't want them to be close to me just because I'm their father I want to know their hearts and I want to give my heart to them because this is the closest not because I have the title I could use my title as father I could exercise my authority even when they're not listening even when they're 30 years old I can say well I'm the father you need to do what I say well that's a real good relationship that has no relationship in it is anybody with me here this morning Satan messes with the the truth because here it is you want some more proof of it that day that Jesus said I and my father are one how many knows he said it I and my father are one it says the Jews picked up stones to throw stones at him well who's getting mad at the Oneness Satan in the people is always angry at the Oneness God's people becoming one in a relationship with the father now I'll tell you why he's resentful because what you have if you have the Holy Ghost and you're becoming one with God and you're one with God by the Holy Ghost when you're doing that you have a relationship that Satan I'm going to tell Satan this morning Satan I have something that you can never have he has been envious from the very beginning of God's children he has been jealous of God's children that's why we have little jealousies come up in the congregation sometimes we should never be jealous of one another if someone excels in the kingdom of God we should Rejoice with him but I'm here to serve Satan notice today I'm going to tell him Satan I know he's listening he comes to church more than some of you all satan I have in my Heart by the Holy Ghost a relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ that you can never have he hates my relationship with God with God unfettered no walls under the blood of Jesus Christ I've come back into Eden again what was Eden unhindered relationship with God by the Holy Spirit come down in the cool of the evening and cooed with his children Adam and Eve there was no sin they weren't afraid of God they weren't afraid to talk to God they fellowshipped in the cool of the evening and it was unhindered relationship the blood of Jesus Christ is bringing God's children back to unhindered relationships not through a priest not through a pope not through a church but you can go directly to God I'll tell you Satan's envious if you got that this morning you say praise the Lord I got a relationship with him unhindered Satan that's why he don't like you he fights to this day he fights your mind how many raise your hands death the devil fights my mind how many say the devil always tries to question you I don't I don't know if you're one of them you made a mistake the other day I don't even know if you're a child of God how many has that devil speaking to you the reason he does it is he resents he's jealous of your relationship with Christ he can't have that he wanted power Lucifer a rose tried to take the kingdom influence a third of the stars and he wanted to lift his throne above the Throne of what he wanted to be worshiped like God he's always wanted that position and then God comes down glory be to God and he hands all the creative power to his son Adam not to an angel to his son Adam on Earth and says Adam this Earth is Yours I created this one specifically for you and guess what you have all the power to change animals names to change mountains to create whatever you want you've got creative power and Satan's going but that's what I wanted I want that creative power how many know Satan can't create he only perverts what God's already done he cannot create anything but he's wanted it I want it I want it I want it I want that creative power and God comes and gives it to you Sons and Daughters of God living in You by spirit no wonder he fights against you you got the very relationship I don't care what you feel about yourself today you might have had a defeated week but you got the holy spirit in you that says Amen to the word of God you can tell Satan this week start your week different you can tell them before you leave this building Satan I may not be perfect yet but I've got a connection to God you can never have thank you for
