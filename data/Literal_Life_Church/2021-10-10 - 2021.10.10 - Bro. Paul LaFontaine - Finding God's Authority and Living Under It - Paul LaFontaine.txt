TRANSCRIPT
========================================
8 and it texts here we praise the lord for the word that's been coming forth brother diggs brother george smith and wednesday night the different brothers we're blessed to have in and we may the lord just continue to bring us revelation but we want to read a portion of scripture from matthew chapter 8 and start reading at verse 5. amen and when jesus was entered into capernaum there came unto him a centurion a roman centurion beseeching him and saying lord my servant lieth at my home sick of the palsy grievously tormented and jesus saith unto him i will come and heal him the centurion answered and said lord i'm not worthy that thou should has come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed for i am a man under authority having soldiers unto me probably a hundred if he was a centurion that's a hundred probably a hundred soldiers in in under his jurisdiction i'm a man under authority having soldiers under me and i say to this man go and he goeth and another one come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he do with it when jesus heard it he marveled and said to them that followed verily i say unto you i have not found so great faith no not in all of israel and i say unto you that many shall come from the east and west and shall sit down with abraham and isaac and jacob in the kingdom of heaven and there he is referring to the gentiles who jews didn't think gentiles could be saved here's a gentile roman soldier that act jesus said has more faith than all the jews that i've seen so far he's in another realm of faith he's saying something that it is totally at a different level and he's a roman he's saying listen there's going to be gentiles and other ones besides jews come in and he says they're going to be with sit down with abraham isaac and jacob too aren't you glad this morning that the gentiles were able to come in aren't you glad that you're going to be able to sit down with abraham and isaac too not just the jews amen i look forward to that day but verse 12 the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness he's referring to some of the jews he's referring to the the ones that should have received him and they didn't there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth why because they missed their messiah they missed who he was and once you realize you rejected him then there's going to be weeping and gnashing of teeth didn't recognize who jesus was verse 13 and jesus said unto the centurion go thy way and as thou hast believed so be it done unto thee and his servant at home was healed in the selfsame hour amen so i want to speak on finding god's authority and coming under it heavenly father bless your word today we commit it to you we pray you on anointed and as i spoke to you earlier lord and said that there's so many things that you give us that we could say but it's not about so many things it's but it's it's it's comes down to what you want to say and what's needed for these precious people and my life and my family bless us with your word today in season in jesus name amen god bless you maybe see what shake somebody's hand before you sit down say god bless you so i'm going to speak a little bit this morning on a couple things and um maybe in a couple sundays from now as well i'm going to speak about authority and submission two words that uh most people today shy away from and sometimes we shy away from authority and submission well we we shy away from them for many different reasons i suppose but um many times it's that we don't understand authority and submission the way that it should be we live in a world that um we have situations where authority and submission has got off track and it's authorities misused and of course we live in a nation that the spirit is laodicea and laodicea is people's rights exercising their own authority instead of coming under authority so when you speak about this these things it's a bit tedious because the words have been so ruined by the enemy but a lot of times it's just people don't understand the way that it should be according to god's kingdom and when we understand it then it's probably one of the greatest blessings that we can see in our lives in relation to the word of god is authority and submission to the word of god and submission to god's authority it's one of the greatest things because we can go throughout the bible and see the power that comes when god's people break find find they find where god's delegated authority is for the hour they find it first of all you have to find it is this god and is this his authority and once you find it to bring your life in order with it and bring your life under it and your family under it when that's happened i'll tell you it had a powerful effect and sometimes it had a powerful effect even when the leadership got off track as a human being god still blessed the submission to his authority so you know some of the reasons has been messed up and so you know we're heading to a climax today of a lawless society how many believe that the bible speaks of lawlessness coming uh the antichrist brings more of this spirit of lawlessness you know defund the police remove authorities we don't need this anymore so it's a lawlessness society where they want to remove all authority they want to take all the things that's telling them what to do and and you know you remember brother brown talked about the the police officer who he doesn't really have any authority himself but because he's been hired by the government to enact the laws and to he he's not so much he as a you don't look at the man but you look the man's badge can you say amen so that's how the authority of god works as well you don't look at the man but you look at what god has placed within him and so you know people have to so now defund the police def take all this waste because of the spirit of lawlessness comes in just before the antichrist comes in and becomes incarnate then we see the spirit of lawlessness takes over this entire nation and we can spend a lot of time on that but i don't need to because you can watch every day as the spirit of lawlessness takes over this country takes over this world can you say amen amen so so someone under the spirit of disobedience sometimes is blind to how the outcome will be and that's our world is when you start defunding the police when you start saying we don't want authorities we want we want to remove the christian churches and by the way it's if you don't think that there's going to be more more of a pressure on particularly christian churches you're missing something because it's coming more and more our dear brothers and sisters in canada are experiencing it already in newfoundland just i believe this week they asked for prayer because they were the the province was asking for an 80 vaccination for everyone in the country and churches included and then they moved it in one day's time and they changed it to a hundred percent vaccination and came and told the pastor and said your entire church has to be vaccinated or you can't meet together so listen it's time to wake up time to wake up i'm not on a discussion about getting the vaccine or not getting back that's up to your personal choice but if that's happening there it's coming down the pike can you say man and they have to use something like that to for control but what we have is is as a spirit that dominates the last generation and the thing is is that they want to remove all authorities and they want to be the authority and remove the authorities in your life if they want to do that someone that's under the spirit of disobedience which our dignitaries in this world is and all these other things a lot of times they're blind to how the outcome will be would you want to live in a nation to remove all police what are we going to live in can you say man if you start removing those authorities that god what kind of world are we going to live in and people will keep pushing for it because they're blinded by their disobedience and it's the same word our lives we have to look at ourselves is that sometimes we can be in direct disobedience to god and his word and by that we come blinded and we don't know what's that's going to produce in our life in 10 years in five years in our family in our children disobedience does not ever bring the right fruit in your family so this important thing and so we see many things can be said about that many things can be said about you know the world we live in and you don't want to go down a road like that but the only thing we can do is apply it spiritually this morning is we don't want to go down the road of disobedience to the word of god we don't want to see what that brings can you say amen our nation's going that way but we got to look and say lord you've sent down your headship in this hour this message and this presidency is your headship and i want to come underneath that headship with all of my life i want to teach my children to come underneath that headship praise the lord and so many things can be said about that there's many roads to the subject of authority uh even the universe functions by the powers and authority that god puts in place how many believe that god has set everything up by authority and a lot of it under his authority and he set it up the universe that way and how everything functions and we live by it we we when we when we have an injustice in our lives do you know what you do how many has ever how many's ever walked into a place a restaurant or you're on the phone with somebody and so you're not getting too many places so you yourself probably have after you get so frustrated you say can i speak to a manager come on all you holy people you know if there's an injustice being done what you're doing is asking for a higher authority you're calling for a higher authority because you're not getting anywhere with this guy or this woman who can't even speak english on the phone you can't even understand what she's saying can i talk to someone else but if you're not getting if there's an injustice someone has done you wrong you know what you do naturally you call upon a higher authority i'm telling your friends we need to learn that in the spiritual and when frustrations come we have a higher authority to call upon we have a council that we can go to we ought to be looking for the authority of god god where are you speaking and lord in that authority i want to be underneath that because i need some answers can you say that when the devil is doing me injustice i call on a higher authority [Applause] i should be his name so and to let you know that many themes in my life the last five years and some of the themes that i preach on are influenced by my observation of things that's manifesting sometimes among our ranks around the world among our ranks around those who who celebrate the light that's been sent to us and the message if we call it that i my observation is there's some fruit sometimes that come out of things that i'm going how can that kind of fruit come out of somebody who's close to the the message of the hour and you have heard me speak on some of these things because it's it's it's frustrating but it's a reality in our own ranks pride message pride rebellion not only in the people but in ministers sometimes hypocrisy living all praise be to god and live in a different life at home and and cussing and doing all kinds of other things at home hypocrisy the misuse now we'll talk about authority how many has observed the misuse of authority the misuse of the quotes when satan was quoting the word to jesus he was quoting the word to jesus and he was quoting the direct scriptures it wasn't like twisting it with the serpent with eve but satan was quoting scriptures when jesus was tempted he was quoting scriptures to jesus but it was the wrong motive it was the wrong spirit behind the scriptures you don't think the devil can do that today you don't think the devil can twist the interpretation of the bible you don't think the devil can twist the interpretation of quotes i'll tell you we need to be humble and say god let the interpretation come like the prophet taught us he interprets his word by bringing it to pass and let me be very careful to interpret those quotes to fit my own opinion we have seen the abuse of authority we have seen the influence of others to speak against authority we've to undermine authority to gossip about authority and it's it's not been a good result and then we've seen the struggle for positions and sometimes in a church you know who's going to be this and who's in charge and we've seen these struggles of positions we've seen jealousies of other people's positions we have watched these things for countless years and all this does not seem right around the wonderful message that we hold i said it doesn't seem right that those things are coming out of the message that we hold it's like paul said about sexual sin let none of those things be once named among you as become his saints we should never hear of that that was his goal we should never hear of sexual sin and all this stuff going on coming out of the true people of god it does but we should never have that but when i got to thinking about it this all happened in heaven before any any anything happened on earth these same attributes came out of lucifer all the things i just mentioned came out of lucifer and he was right in the presence of the lord he was an angel right under the presence of the lord under his subjection you couldn't get any closer to god he's an object of worship and so he had angels to worship him there was none of us yet there was no human beings but all of a sudden over who knows how much time all these attributes begin to come out of lucifer pride undermining god's authority influence of someone else talking to the other angels undermining god's authority influencing them away from god he drew a third part of the angels with him pride influencing others rebellion how many knows your bible say that's what happened before we even came to earth and that was the closest thing to you could get to the presence of the lord and you see all these things come out of lucifer so we can safely say now if that all happened in heaven and that was manifested around the presence of god rebellion to the word and a twisted authority came to earth then it then it moved to earth and influenced through the serpent to eve a twisted authority and rebellion to the word was passed to eve from the serpent and satan influencing this this vessel of the serpent to speak to eve because he was the only other one in the ana kingdom that could speak to eve he spoke and reasoned with the word of god in the original word that had the authority in it to give adam and eve the authority over this whole earth he started messing with that authority he started reasoning with it but where did it originate in a principle in lucifer to rebel against god's authority and now he's speaking to the woman eve and he he brings all that to earth and it causes man to fall but the principle started with lucifer i'd like to say that any rebellion to god and his authority is always satan-inspired praise the lord bring this out here i took this from brother george i said give me that i'm going to use that if you weren't here wednesday night you brother george used this as a visual for balance but he mostly used it when someone fell asleep you woke them up and this potentially could be a sermon that you zone out or just i don't know so i got this this morning don't worry i'll just use it just one service that's all watchmen nee a missionary to china uh has a book uh spiritual authority that i've always enjoyed and you know he refers to isaiah 14 and ezekiel were exposed as lucifer in his ways and he speaks a little bit about his rebellion to authority and he says in serving god we must not violate authorities because to do so is a principle of satan how can we preach christ according to satan's principle yet it is possible and he's he's doing some teaching to young ministers this is what this book is he said yes it is possible to work it is possible in our work to stand with christ in doctrine while at the same time stand with satan in principle that's pretty deep how very wicked for us to assume that we are doing the work of the lord please not take note that satan is not afraid of our preaching the word of christ yet how very much he is in fear of our being subject to the authority of christ he's dead on can you say man because the reason christ and all the men of god could exercise the authority of god the way that they did is because they became a man that was subject to god's authority jesus said i do nothing except my father shows me oh if we could live that way friends i don't make a move unless i pray about and get some counsel can you say amen i'm a son that's under authority and then you have that his authority flows through you that you have authority against the enemy that's how his authority works satan is not afraid of our preaching of the word yet how much very afraid he is in fear of our being subject to authority of christ and uh i remember brother branham saying it more clearly and that is that he says satan is not afraid of our dancing and shouting and and all these other things but all that sanctified life that's life that's under subjection to god that is th that's the thing that shakes the kingdom of satan he goes on later here to say the present age that we are is character characterized by lawlessness the world is full of the sin of lawlessness and soon the son of the son of lawlessness shall appear authority in the world is being increasingly undermined is 1948 friends authority in the world is being increasingly undermined until all at the end all authorities will be overthrown and lawlessness shall rule let us know that there are two principles in the universe the principle of god's authority and the principle of satan's rebellion we cannot serve god and simultaneously go the way of rebellion by having a rebellious spirit satan laughs when a rebellious person preaches the word you can't get satan to laugh any more than to have the deception of somebody who's under actually internally a rebellion to the word personally themselves and preaching the word satan laughs in that and i agree with it he laughs at it because you can't get more deceiving than that if someone could be so deceived to preach doctrine and preach the word and or try to say i'm in the messenger i'm in the word but yet internally it's a spirit of rebellion i'm not doing that i'm not doing this i'm not i'm going to pick and choose what i want out of the word of god it's the principle of satan god can never bless it satan laughs when a satan laughs when a rebellious person preaches the word for in that person is dwelling the satanic principle the principle of service must be authority are we going to obey god's authority or not we who serve god must have this basic understanding of authority anyone who has once experienced an electric shock knows thereafter that he cannot be careless with electricity likewise the person who has once been smitten by god's authority from then on has his eyes open to judge what is lawless both in himself and in others may god be gracious to us by delivering us from rebellion may god be gracious to us this morning by delivering us from all rebellion only after we have known god's authority and learned obedience can we lead his children in a straight path it's powerful friends can you say amen it's it it's powerful to see that principle may god be gracious to us he says that we'd have all this rebellion purged out of us because god may have let something work for a while and let you go on for a while but there's something huge missing and that's this you can't have both principles you can't have the authority of god working correctly and a rebellion internally on the inside and it's like the electricity once they've shot one you can tell your kids but once they've been shocked by it you're probably not going to have to tell them to get quit putting your finger in that plug i'm just going to stop right here and say that when moses who was trained in all of egypt's ways to do things he was a he was a warrior he was as an organizer he was in charge of egypt for the most part he was next in line he knew all the psychology how to deal with people how to lead people how to michael managed people and so you would have thought i think brother brahma even says one place is that you would have thought this was the man with all of his training to lead the children of israel out so he would do it by his training but god said no i don't do it that way i don't do it that way so here's a man pretty confident pretty confident and so now god says i'm going to lead you gets a hold of him takes them out the back side of the desert and brother bram says is to to teach them human weakness that god said i'm i'm not going to use any of your former teaching on authority to bring my people out of egypt and so like this electrical shock one day there's a burning bush and this moment with god and all of a sudden this confident man starts to say but he can't speak oh lord i i can't he said take your shoes off the ground you're standing outside all his life he had never been in a presence like this is something different in that bush he come into the presence of god and he was he was burnt pretty good he was he was he couldn't say he said god i'm not your man i can't even and he's stuttering and he can't even speak and god begins to tell him what he's going to do through him and so now the same man in his humility he's been shocked by this electricity now goes down and through his words he's going to call flies he's going to call this he's going to open up the red sea he's going to god's not going to do it but god's going to use his vocal cords to do all the and exercise the full authority of god but i can tell you god did not trust that until he himself had been really affected by the presence of god to where he couldn't say nothing speed ahead to paul and this great man of authority within the church had been trained by different great teachers and he actually was exercising authority i'm going to get letters and put these christians in jail he was organizing he's putting it together he was a man who knew how to get things done he knew authority can you say man and on his on his horse on the way somewhere god knocks him down the pillar of fire there and all of a sudden he comes in the midst of the pillar of fire and this this electricity can you say man this power can you say man he couldn't even speak he was blinded couldn't hardly say nothing except the words lord who art thou he knew this is different this isn't gamalie this isn't my teachers he come into the presence and to the authority of god and it had an effect on him to humble him to shut your mouth and let me speak to you you know brother diggs said last week god was saying shut up i don't say it that's extreme but god said shut up to moses but really he's saying that i need to so move upon you that you just shut up you just you can't even speak and then god's got you where he wants you you've controlled things you have done things you you've micromanaged things and i want everybody to apply this in your life if you're in a position of authority of a husband father mother over her children you can apply all this i don't have time today but i could go into all these avenues because if god's going to hand authority you need the humility to be able to handle it god got him just where he wanted him couldn't even speak couldn't hardly say nothing blind someone leads him to a little home and he has to wait there and then god sends a no-name in the body of christ nobody no position ananias no position don't even know his name don't know where he come from and god says you're going to submit to ananias in the body you're going to listen to him if you want the holy ghost he's going to lay hands on you to get the holy ghost now if paul would have said i'm not even listening to a guy like that that's not how things work bring me gamalie bring me somebody in a position who's ananias but god made him submit to somebody in the body of christ is anybody learning anything this morning i'll tell you this many many years ago by the time you're here but tom praise the lord got a great report from the doctor last friday his tests are doing good amen amen [Applause] but tom when we started the church he started some gym classes you know so i want to take my kids they were little guys and i knew i needed to work out a little bit and encourage everybody to go so i went to his gym class so i was going for a few weeks and then i wore this t-shirt to brother tom's gym class now i'm the pastor and i wrote a t-shirt that day that said this working out thing is not working out i did i i wore a t-shirt like that i thought it was funny i'm always joking about waiting stuff and it's probably because i got a problem and we always kind of laugh off things that we really got a problem with you know why i know this because my wife tells me i have a problem joking about it i thought this was so funny and brother tom was right there said don't wear that shirt again to this gym class don't ever wear it again now i'm the pastor i can take that a lot of ways but because early in my life i learned about god's delegated authorities and when the authority is there it's not about the man it's about the authority that's right so i submitted thank the lord i don't know what he had done next [Laughter] it's not how big the man is it's the authority behind him and i wanted to go to that class i really did but i submitted myself there's other cases in the church that have come up and even even uh brother branham says pastors congregations submit yourself to your pastor and then he says pastor submit yourself to your congregation there's a lot of preachers leave the other part out but paul says in ephesians brothers submit yourself one to another why is that why because god's bringing his authority and his presence in his people and it's not about the people i ain't going to submit myself to someone like that brother i'll never break you better be careful what you say because you may be bucking up against god's authority in that person wives you better be careful what you say it's not about the man all the time it's about the authority god places in him well what if he don't do the right things and him his authority is this way in that way and then i i i don't know but just be careful what you're saying because god's watching the whole thing okay well let me say this too when i see god spoke to me about the ministry it was after this first thing that happened to me and i was in college i was in the dorm at college and you know i referred to moses and paul i'm not at all on that level of course as a prophet but something happened to me and i don't share this a lot because i don't like to make a big deal out of it but something came in my room when i was napping and i had to took a lot of naps because college was rough on me i i don't like school and it was really tough you know for me to adjust to that so any chance i get i'd take a little nap so it was in the afternoon about two o'clock my roommate wasn't in there and uh i had the window open and i can tell you and i wouldn't say this before god before you unless i i knew that there was another presence in the room and a light come it come in the room it come in my window and it it woke me up i don't know about the noise of it but it was just such a presence it woke up and so i just i was laying down i looked up and there was just something hanging beside my bed and all i can tell you is i was completely paralyzed i couldn't speak i didn't want to speak to it i didn't want to say anything i didn't actually want to be there i had sets the fear of god i said this is something different and in some ways you hope if you're looking for leadership in your life you hope something speaks out of that but there's another side you say please don't speak out of that now we're talking about the fear of god we're not talking about fear scared but we're talking about the fear and reverence of god and something just happened to me and so nothing ever did was said but it was the beginnings of god getting my attention that he had a ministry for me and so just hung over there probably about a minute and i was just paralyzed and so that's why when i can read moses and difference in the bible when you come in the presence of god that way you know it's not you're shouting and jumping [Music] brother brahman says the shouting and jumping rejoicing is the blessings of god and we should do that if we're happy about the word but when his presence comes in certain ways it's not about shouting and jumping we feel very sober about where we're at with the lord we feel exposed can you say amen and he can come in this room this morning in such a way we'd all be on the ground how many we would all be on the ground there would be no word set if he came in in that kind of fullness that way and his but see god is not interested just doing that he wants us to have the reverence of his presence every day in our lives that we watch the decisions we make and we're reverent not to seek our own will but god what is your will today to let this fear of god dominate us or not dominate but to lead us that we're always like jesus i do nothing except my father my father shows me it was quite an experience and i thank god for it but i just wanted to say when you hit that electricity when you hit that presence everything changes and next time i preach i won't have time today but then i want to go into my life after and show you this reverence for the word this reverence for the message and for what the prophet said and what his ministers say it that so affect me later on the lord spoke to me in a service i've commissioned you to preach my word to the people so god showed me what i should do in life but you know what when i approached the word when i approached everything something happened after that incident that if this is god's man this is god's authority through his word i'm going to value it i'm going to respect it now i'll go into details about things that were doctrine that we know are true but other things that brother brown would say with people who dish off and say that was just brother brown's opinion i didn't approach it that way i said god has come down and expressed himself in the authority of this man or the authority in the man and i do not want to dish out or cast aside anything that's being said right now now that doesn't have to be your testimony that's just my testimony from that point on of coming into the presence of the lord that way i just would dare to not i don't want to venture see brother brown says to presume is to venture without authority i don't want to do that so that's that's what he's saying watchmen knee here the missionary was saying some powerful things that we come in context satan's principle has culminated in the systems of denomination satan's principle has culminated in the systems of denomination if you're listening today all due respect to the people christians everywhere we respect you whoever you are but you must know that according to the scripture lucifer's principle of rebellion to the word of god is culminated in the last days in systems of denomination it is a rebellion against the word of god it is to weaken the authority of god's word taking out what you want putting in what you want is satan's principle whoever takes from this book or adds to this book shall have his place taken out of the book of life the authority of god's word is is being taken by denominations but then we live in the world of the children of disobedience it's called the children of disobedience following denominations or following their own will their own will on things can you say man so this is the world we live in and it culminates it culminates in satan's principle of questioning god's word coming against god's word reinterpreting god's word messing with god's word and i just think that we've come to the places of bride let's leave this alone and believe it the way god said it can you say mine and let it do what it's supposed to do is this amen is this okay this morning this is a straightforward message that's the that's that's the end of page one of my notes does anybody want to close now and just leave it at that all right i'll go on i got enough support listen i want to tell the devil this morning i'm not called to be a child of disobedience i'm not called to be one of those children of disobedience whatever happened in heaven with lucifer is now is now being reversed by the people of god whatever happened with lucifer in this hour is being reversed by the children of god the bride of jesus christ we are not the children of disobedience can you say amen brother bradham even said this age is to prove to satan that this eve is not like the first eve where she failed in the word this eve will believe the word of god she'll come unto the authority of god i am not a child of disobedience i am not i am under the headship of jesus christ and i am holding the authority of the word of god can you say amen jesus took the name of god it was the name of the lord jesus christ and now the church has the authority because we bear the name of the lord jesus christ and there's power in the name of jesus christ we're not ashamed of the name of jesus christ we're not ashamed of the word which is jesus the word jesus is the word i'm not ashamed of any of the word i'm not a child of disobedience i'm the one that's called to reverse this whole thing see yourself as that this morning not amongst that but i'm called to reverse this whole process and i'm bearing the name of jesus christ because i'm under the authority of the power of that name there's power in the name of jesus god bless my son gideon who was asked to do the prayer at the sylvania chamber of commerce meeting with all the business leaders there he was asked to say the prayer and he was called ahead of time and said the girl was a little nervous and she said you know what uh could i could i ask maybe if you could not use the name of jesus in your prayer you could just say god and just keep it general we have all the religions there and so gideon was quick to respond you better get someone else to do the prayer because i'm going to use the name of jesus christ amen [Applause] and he did he said okay we'll just come and he went and did the prayer this week this week and he prayed a very long prayer it's what i hear it was right sherry he was milking it man he was taking his opportunity to talk about whatever he needed and do it in jesus name praise be to god hallelujah [Applause] amen [Applause] he was milking that like he melts the song service sometimes and i have to say shut her down boy i gotta preach i'm not called to be a child of disobedience this morning this age is to prove we're not like the other eve we're the second eve can you say man there was a first adam and there was a second adam the second adam was jesus christ and he started the process of reversing the fall in the garden can you say amen but there's if there's a second adam there has to be a second eve i'm that second eve this morning and through me i'm reversing all that rebellion i'm reversing the children of disobedience i'm coming under the authority of god's word if god's word said it i believe it and that settles it i don't need to debate it i don't need to question it can you say amen lord if that's your authority i bring myself underneath that word hallelujah the bride is reversing she is not working and hearing the hiss of the serpent to reason with and debate every word of the prophet you're listening to the hiss of the serpent that talked to eve when you start to reason with things that were said oh my she's not saying the bride's not saying this message is bondage she's not picking and choosing what she wants of the message she is saying i'm a man under authority isn't this what this roman general said i'm a man under authority she's saying i'm a man i'm a woman under authority and i i'm proud to say that i'm a man and a woman that's under the authority of god you see satan so so just so ruined that i'm under the authority of the word of god and and being there i'm a man under authority i've ordered my life underneath that and being there is the best place that i can be living there is no greater love or protection than being under the wings of god's authority that's the way the bride sees it being there living there hands me the authority over satan he knows who has the authority how many know in the bible that satan already knew who had the authority of god even when they walk to the room i taught this to the brothers at the at the men's meeting we don't have to rest keep reestablishing our authority by the scripture if you have it you don't have to say you have it you have it [Applause] i don't have to read all the quotes about authority my authority is a pastor my authority as a husband if you have it you have it and you'll humbly manifest leadership in your life and your children and your wife will follow but if you've got a rebellion privately don't expect them to come willingly under your authority if you're not under authority yourself i'm gonna go there i'm gonna go there don't expect the wife and children and everyone to come under your authority and read all the scriptures about your headship if they know that you don't have something under subjection to god yourself you've got a private sexual problem and you're not overcome it yet don't you dare try to re-establish your authority because you're losing your authority because you're not under the full authority of god that's why families sometimes unravel sometimes that's how families unravel it's just and i said to the brothers at camp in my history as a pastor when couples get into arguments uh married couples which i know none of you ever have that it was just me and my wife when couples get into this through the years not every time but three years it's interesting i see the husband they go right to the word of god and they think they'll solve the problem by going to ephesians and reestablishing who's the head this is the problem in this family is nobody is coming underneath my headship so i'm going to ephesians and i'm going to tell my family that i'm ahead and if everybody will knuckle down and get underneath me it would be the end of all of our family problems and i believe in ephesians and i believe the man is the ruler over the wife that happened after the fall in the garden they were co-equal and then the sin came in sex came in god had to do a different covenant now you read your bible and he places a different covenant to the woman than the man he places it under rulership say why did he do that because now because sets came in and the woman's body now he had to place a protection over that womb he had to put a woman under protection because she reasoned what the word god and failed not too many amens people think he put the woman under whole world rejects that she's not under his authority god put her there but he put her there for a good reason amen not to bring her under bondage he's bringing out these scriptures and i just want to reestablish and i just told the brothers whoever it is a pastor a husband a father an employer if you have authority you never have to come around and just flaunt it i find that if it's the right kind of authority through humility and through the boldness of the spirit to lead his family slowly that family and he's a sanctified man he's living a life that family because it's the image of god this will work if it's done the right way that family comes underneath it terrible situations where the man is not and it's difficult for the woman in some cases it it even makes a separation totally understandable but when it's working the best then you don't have to keep reestablishing your authority one guy said years ago i have to say years ago because you think it's somebody who i'm talking about it's not this is years ago he said if my wife would just clean the house and keep it clean when i get home if she would keep this house clean like this other sister in the church i said oh why did he say that in front of her boy you are messing up right now if she would just keep the house clean like this other sister we wouldn't have any marriage problems and i knew enough back then to know in my young years boy you're way off track he had a problem with my headship as a pastor he had a problem with the headship of the word he had a problem with the headship of the message he's got all that in his life and the wife could sense it and now he's trying to say that if she keeps her house clean all their problems i said i'll tell you right in front of your wife if she kept the house perfectly clean like sister so and so it would not solve your problems you've been lied to that's right there's a bigger fish here there's a bigger elephant in the room that nobody's talking about and i happen to be the guy that has to talk about it become the bad guy sometimes but i'm going to be objective i'm going to use the word of god i'm going to say lord to my desert lord help me to help people i'm not going to emotionally enter into your emotions in a situation i'm not allowed to take sides with you as a pastor but he says to bring the two families together and try to bring harmony back together again not to choose sides but to find the truth and that we forgive one another and that we go on can you say mine but i want to tell us all whatever authority that we hold we hold it not to re-establish it or try to technically enforce it by the word of god if you have it you have it jesus had the authority and never even had to say that he had it [Applause] he walked into the room and devils could recognize that before he said anything devils were already afraid can you say man that's the life that i want to live that i have something i have a substance that when i walk in the room demons are already scattering it's not something that we say we have it's something that we have and it just goes in the flow of it because jesus was asked the question oh i'm so way off my notes here today jesus was asked the question by what first of all there was a scripture that said that i brought up to the brothers and you're getting a residual of the men's meeting a little bit there was a place that they said he speaks different than the scribes when he speaks it has authority in it they're recognizing he's using the same scroll as all of the religious leaders and yet when he speaks it's got authority with it and he didn't even say now guys i'm going to read the scripture here i want to let you know i'm different than the pharisees and sadducees when i speak i've got authority never said it they recognized it when he uses the bible it's different when he speaks out of this scroll there's an authority with it but then when the pharisees started to hear this stuff from the jews they went to jesus said by what authority do you say these things questioning his authority you know why they questioned it because they didn't they didn't see his authority the other jews seen it he didn't see so by what authority do you think who gave you this authority so jesus he answered and said well i'll tell you where my authority comes from he didn't answer the question you don't have to he didn't answer he said all right i'll answer your question if you answer mine did the did john's message come from god or did it come from men that's a weighted question and so they're pondering i wish the scripture said how long they took to talk amongst themselves but they talked and they said we can't answer that because if we answer this way we're in a certain group if we answer that way we're in a certain group look what the question is you know what the question is about authority it's about authority if you can't never mind me did john come from god or did he come from men did his message to introduce the messiah come from god did it come from men we don't need to debate another moment unless you know did that man was he sent from god i don't mean the man but i mean god did he send the man with the authority to introduce the messiah and until you decide that there's no sense in us having coffee and talking for hours about my authority because you can't even get the authority of the prophet straightened out somebody sent me a few months ago they said here's this brother that's leaving the message and he says he says this is what he says and he called another man he says i just want you to you know i'm just looking at these things and i want you to watch a video of this other guy who had already left the message years ago i just want you to watch this video and when i heard that he was referring to a man like that i said i don't need to hear any more i do not need to listen to the video i don't need if he's referring to a guy like that he's already out he's already off track amen john was it of god was amen we can't answer it he says neither will i answer your question because why you don't have to establish his authority he has it amen we got an eve here on the earth that's not working and hearing the hiss of the serpent to reason and debate every word she's not saying the message is bonded she's not picking and choosing what she wants of the message she's saying i'm a man under authority and there's the best place that i can live with my family there's no greater love of protection being there hands me the authority over satan he knows who has it and he is afraid when i walk in the room she she the bride is submission and surrender her submission and surrender is a glorious place to live for her you may not have heard these things in a while or may never heard them but the bride the second eve is saying with her life submission in surrender is the most glorious place to live because she's learned that is anybody learning something this morning so i just want to spend a little more time before we bring this down about this roman centurion there's so much here and it took me so so long to get there i think that's the end of page two this gentile man was under caesar and this roman centurion seen something in jesus that most the jews didn't see two things this man has the authority of god and this man is under the authority of god he's seen that you can't have it without being under it you say well he's seen god he had authority of god in him he didn't just see that he's seen the whole picture he's he watched this man and he's seen that he was a man under the authority he's seen the humility he's seen the submission to god he's seen that but then he said that's a man that can have have authority because he's under authority and a roman centurion seen that without even any new birth over that and he's seen what the jews couldn't see an entire nation is missing the authority coming to the earth and he sees it as a roman centurion and and he's seen that you can't have it without being under it god's first begotten son jesus christ was given all authority how many of you believe that jesus was all the authority all the power of god was poured into that vessel there how many believe that that's the mystery of god all authority was poured into a son his only begotten son and he's standing there with all the authority of god but it's because this begotten son was under complete submission in his life to hold that authority we should we we never should approach anything to life unless we seek who is in charge to submit to that can you say amen that's the one the subject i want to get into i want to talk about is that just i hope i can get to that this morning is it's about our lives i'm giving a lot of examples from the scripture here but the ultimate ending to this this morning is that the best thing that we can do is seek out where god has placed his power and authority through his word to find it and many of you have found it but to bring and order our families and lives underneath that this roman centurion he's he's even coming under submission can you say man what he's seen jesus what he's seen in this whole authority jesus said he couldn't even find this kind of faith in the whole jewish group yet this man just just it was he caught something that was so advanced in something that the religious people didn't even see it and that's why i want to say it's about who's carrying god's authority this man recognized who's carrying god's authority and the reason that he was interested in it he said because i have a need at home and the doctors can't help this this servant with palsy all the doctors have shut them out i need i have a need in my home anybody this morning have a need in your home i have a need in my home and not a jew but a roman centurion caught one thing this is where god has placed his authority and i know that if i will believe just his word this man has the authority to rebuke the demon off of this palsy and my home can receive healing you're seeking healing this morning you're seeking physical healing you're seeing healing in marriages you're seeking healing in your home whatever it is healing in a marriage the best thing you can do is find the true presence and authority of god bring your life underneath it because in that word there'll be authority to drive away demons you have to put on a show it's in there it's in the word did anybody ever notice that the roman centurion humbly said jesus said i'm going to come to your house right now and he said no no no no notice this revelation it wasn't about the man the physical man coming to his home it was about the word that had authority at it he said i i'm unworthy for you to step into my house but if you say the word you have god's authority and when you speak it i believe my servant will be healed this guy is is teeter-tottering or he's he's he's branching into the faith of the third pole i said this roman centurion is is touching upon the faith of the third pole which this bride should know that's why jesus said all of israel all the religious people they believe in miracles and remember they had to have jesus come and touch them they're about touched lay hands on the sick though that's all that came but he's he's raised the level of faith no no this is in the word and if he speaks the word there's authority in the word to get the job done that's third ball that's where the bride needs to be and a roman centurion is catching it way early on there and he just basically said now wait a minute i'm a man under caesar's authority i have 100 men under me and i'm exercising his authority because i'm under caesar he wouldn't dare come out from underneath caesar's authority see that was a dictatorship and it probably was a little bit of scared fear whatever because that's man's authority right but even that the principle worked because caesar said you're in charge of these hundred men he said whatever i say to these men go here do that do that do that they got to do it because i'm holding authority here because i'm under authority he said if that's working for me i have found the man that god has poured all of his authority into and i got a need at home i got a need god is here i found god's authority through the word and i don't need to have a big feeling i don't need to have a big revival i don't need to do i don't even have to have jesus come to my own personally i humbly say i don't need to in this man is the word of authority blessed be his name praise be to god if some of us can only recognize what god has spoke through his prophet in this hour and through his fightful ministry and through vessels of the bride of jesus christ if you can only know his authority is in that word i don't need to have jesus come to my home and that's fine if you do that get a gospel minister when dear sister here had me come and pray felt like there was demons in the home you should do that bring on that's fine brother boaz has me pray over every new car that he gets that it's blessed for the kingdom of god i think that's wonderful but there's power in the word that's spoken of a prophet and if you get hung up on the man which is what all the influences on the internet and those defectors they're hung up on the man and they don't understand one thing so jesus said is he from god or is he not did god send him or didn't send him don't get hung up on the man because it's not about the man if it was about the man then we would need brother branham here to take care of our problems we would need him to come and visit our home which i would love that i'd respectfully say i'd love for him to be here i certainly wouldn't be preaching if he was here this morning defer it can you say amen but he's not here he's finished his course but god didn't leave god's authority didn't leave god's authority is still here the authority in his word we heard it last weekend with brother diggs can you say he even said i don't want a blessing i don't want just a blessing from god but i want to exercise what god has given me as a son is this okay with everybody amen so jesus so so here it's the word that's that's who can bring healing to my home here he's tap tape he's going into the third pole faith this shows us there can be a whole group around the son of man ministry and worshipping but worshiping according to their own will because they don't see the authority of this in fact this was the final conclusion of the jews you know this is the conclusion of the jews when it was all over we will not have this man rule over us so it's about authority is about subjection and most of them decided we will not have this man see that's the problem when you're looking at the man you're not seeing it right it wasn't about the man jesus is about god the god in him we will not have this man rule over it that's a pretty straight statement they chose but they didn't see it was not the man it was the authority he held the roman centurion seen it there may be a lot of people who follow even this message but i'm going to say there's a small few that catch the authority of this word and to have the fear of god to get under it with them in their family there's very few if there's few in jesus day there's few today roman centurion under something that every one of us need to understand so we learn from this roman his word carried an authority authority with it that means if the man is not there his authority would continue in the word it has an effect into the future that word when it's believed this way went back into his home and brought healing to his home even though jesus wasn't there it brought healing to this man in that very same hour the roman do you think god can meet needs in your life right now even by the word that's being spoken god can already be sent and rushing towards a need that's in your home in your life right now how many believe that because the word has power in it can you say man you can go get that lost loved one those lost children he can be working and you don't even see it bring your life under the authority of the word in humility and say god i know this is word this word is powerful enough from my home it already went out when jesus said your servant will be healed already by the time the roman got home he was already healed in that hour the authority and the word of god the roman didn't get huh up on the man he was needing he was respecting the authority in god god blessed his home for it the roman found that the man was god's authority what he did he submitted and he asked him to speak the word and he carried he carried god's jesus carried god's name he had power in that name and the bride is carrying the name of god as well it's not just we say the verbal words jesus christ the lord jesus christ we know we say that we speak it on our lips but it's not just the verbal words there's many people without the holy ghost and without the character of christ speak in the name of jesus and doing things in the name of jesus it's not just the words it's you have his name we all need to seek out god's authority those who have not found it for this hour if you're listening on the internet i know there's several who listen god bless you even who maybe have different beliefs i'm privileged that you would listen in god bless you but we all as christians need to seek out god's delegated authority for this hour and those who have not found it for this hour because it's not just your bible now it's where god places his authority to speak these things and i'm going to give you instruction if you live in this hour the first place you go to first place is malachi 4 5 and 6. if you're wanting to know you're going to go to malachi 4 5 and 6 and you're going to see a prophecy that elijah will come at the end time and he'll restore all things that's pretty powerful don't get hung up on the man but if you come and meet with me i can tell you there's enough vindication to show there's a man that came with the spirit of elijah and so now we're starting to talk about where god delegates and gives his authority for this hour that's where you start but you don't end there can you say amen you say what did jesus say jesus said in matthew 11. he said elijah will come and restore all things malachi said it matthew 11 said it revelations 10 7 says it so if you're seeking what god is doing in this hour you're going to have to start there but then you have to you can't stay there because you realize god's still got his delegated authority on earth amen and you see this word has authority in it when it's received right let me just quickly go to this so i can end on this it's not bad it's only one o'clock when you're seeking out and you find god's authority like the roman he found god's authority and he come under god's authority you don't come to my home i'm unworthy of that but i submit to your word whatever you say i submit to it and i believe it will be done he found god's authority for the hour and he brought his life under subjection to it friends if you don't get anything else here just get that this morning find it if you haven't found it yet find it bring your lives under it bring your families under it there's way too many testimonies i can tell of families that just simply said i don't know what's going on but i just bring my life under subjection to the word of god and all of a sudden the healing began see when everybody's fighting for their own will and fighting for their own opinion there's not much subjection there but when we come under the word the authority and the blessings just start to flow down and we receive the same benefits so the word has authority in it we seek it out and then when the word is received right you got to look at this about the roman it has to be received right pull up uh first thessalonians 2 13 esther first thessalonians 2 13. first thessalonians 2 13 for this cause also paul said that we thank we god without ceasing because when ye received the word of god which he heard of us ye received it not as the word of men but as it is in truth the word of god so stop right there hold it up right there the power is in how you receive it the attitude you receive in it and he's saying that his message his message now who's paul and who's and a lot of people like especially jews said what authority does he have you know what they're even questioning his authority and we give him 14 books of the new testament he must have had some authority must have been something about it but it's like how did he get all that and he said well he's just building up himself he's pointing himself no no no it was the people the elect that received it this way he said ye have received the word of god which he heard of us he received it not as the word of men they didn't stumble at the man they didn't say paul it came from man paul had his weaknesses paul had his problems can you say amen but he didn't they didn't receive it so the power is how you receive it but as it was in truth the word of god you received it as the word and the authority of god which effectually worketh also in you that believe guess what when you see it right and you receive it right you get the full benefit of the power affectionately working in your life everything in that authority starts to flow into your life and it becomes effective can you say that can i get one more scripture it's in uh uh okay i'm skipping down here it's in uh matthew chapter 10 matthew chapter 10 and then i promise we'll bring this a losing son of ya [Applause] amen all right i can tell that's irritating to everybody it's not working it's just an irritation matthew chapter 10 oh look at this now verse if you would as a verse uh 34 we'll start at verse 34. matthew 10 verse 34. look at this now we'll wrap it up with this pick it up again next week or whenever think not that i it's jesus speaking think not that i'm come to send peace on earth i came not to send peace but a sword now these scriptures that it seemed like the conflicts because we know the lord is the lord of peace and he come to he's the prince of peace and he's come to bring priests on earth and good will towards men and all of that at christmas time right let there be peace on earth and let it be all right that was my special this morning but he's you we have to understand this because this it seems like it counter dicks i'm not come to send peace on there i came to not to send peace but a sword nick we better read the next verse for i am come to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law and a man's foes shall be they of his own household stop right there now we've got to understand this because this just don't seem to fit i'm here preaching this morning about healing for the families and jesus is saying i come to set everybody at variance in the family but you have to understand it's about your life and what you're under subjection to and if you're not under subjection solely first to the word and the authority of the word then you will have you will have conflict because the emotions in a family will get involved and you'll choose a life based upon your own will or your family's will and this word will always direct you to a full surrender to the lord he says there's going to be conflict there's not going to be peace sometimes not peace like you want i wish we'd all just get along but it's not going to be because someone's not taking their lives and how we know this is we go to the next scripture he that loveth father mother more than oh now we get it he that loveth father more than me is not worthy of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy now we understand it's about priority it's about who's first it's about who's the principal theme in your life christ the mystery of god revealed he said jesus is the principal theme of every scripture if you didn't find christ in it go read it again he's the principle theme and brother brahm says if he's the principle theme of the entire bible he should be the principle theme of our lives he should be the principle theme of our thinking he should be the principal theme of our decisions the word using the authority of the word for every decision in life not emotion not family he's first he that taketh not his cross and followed after me is not worthy of me next one he that findeth his life shall lose and he that loses his life for my sake shall find it so listen stop right there he that finds his life in other words somebody's grabbing onto their life it's my life i want to do what i want i do what i want there's no submission there's no surrender there to the word of god and the authority of christ and he that loses his life but he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it so here's the channel if you say no my life is not my own i said my life are you micromanaging your life and you're micromanaging god i'm only going to have god in this certain part of my life i control my life you go right ahead but this path this path says i'm losing my life for the gospel's sake for the word's sake it's surrender it's submission but it's the right kind because there's huge blessings that follow him he defined his life shall lose it he that he that re now here's how we get into it now next one he that receiveth you receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me and he oh it's about receiving it's how you're receiving look at this look at this he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward that's not everybody on the face of the earth because not everybody accepts god's prophets i don't need that man in my life i don't need that man to rule over who's he that's just a cultist thing but there's some that receive it right yes this is god's man and it's not about the man it's where god places authority i bring my life on our net and he that receiveth the prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward everything that's there god doesn't keep back from you brother christian everything that's in there it flows right down to you even the rewards of a prophet flows down to your life i tell you that's the life that i want on this earth let me lose my life and find it in the lord let me never say it's my life i can do what i want and pick and choose out of the message god help me to die out to that say my life is not my own my life is not my own i bring it under the subjection of the word of god because he that receives a prophet isn't it interesting now let me finish and and and he that receiveth a righteous man so it's not just the prophet it's not just the prophet that we come under subjection to the authority of god sin but there's been after the prophet isn't there he that receives a righteous man in the name of righteousness shall receive a righteous man's a word this is not something that you submit yourself and then you're just a puppet and you don't get nothing and you just submit the rest of your life no it's not how this authority works this authority works that when you come under subjection like jesus did to the father now he starts to pour in everything that's of god into your life so let me ask this question if he's talking about our life and somebody says i'm retaining my life i'm not going to submit to the gospel the word and somebody says that and he's talking about our life and the one who says i'll lose my life for the gospel sake and he decides i'm giving up my my life is yours my life is my remember that song we'll sing that right now my life is in your hands however that goes i don't know all these new courses that's why we have gideon and all these guys my life is if someone does this he's talking listen friends he's talking amen hello give me two minutes and i'm done when he says lose your life or find it he's talking about your life right now who's in control of it who's micromanaging it i do what i want is it i do what i want i wear what i want i say what i want to all the employees that work on monday is it your life or is it his life okay so he's talking about your life right now your life and isn't it interesting the two scriptures later and he's talking about your life and he's talking about where to bring your life under and he brings up a prophet and a righteous man now if he didn't bring those up those things wouldn't be related to your life but in god's kingdom those vessels are very important to your life if he just said your bible he that receives the bible will see receive the bible's reward he didn't say that he that has all the message books in his closet or on his shelf will receive a reward just for that he that's early to church on time will get a sticker he that we have a bonus point program in this church and you receive certain bonus points if you scan your card we don't have that here your life is when it's connected to the word and the authority of the word in a prophet and righteous men that's god's link to be the test if your life is being lost in him or if it's being held onto otherwise he would have said your bible or anything but he said it he says a prophet and he says a righteous man my personal belief is god delegates his authority we don't like the people he delegates it to sometimes we question the man but i want to get into more in this series it's not about the man it's about what god placed him into and god will respect you when you respect the authority that's in the man this isn't a series to establish my authority i'm not done by pastors authority i'm talking about something that's a blessing for your life your life being blessed and receiving a reward is linked to god's prophets and righteous men that have god's authority isn't he is interesting he says a righteous man because that man just can't be living some sinful life and you have trust in him has to be a righteous man that you have confidence in he's in a righteous holy life then you could if god's put his authority you can trust that man to give you a word of the lord bring your life under it your home will be blessed your children will be blessed your grandchildren will be blessed healing begins to begins to work for marriages for families for attitudes for disrespect that you keep holding on to maybe you keep saying things you shouldn't say years of this stuff and just get under the word say lord let the word begin to do its work in my children and in me let it do its work because god looks and says their life is their life is under subjection to the word humbly and now i'll pour everything they're asking for i'll pour it into them and pour it into their children pour it into their family you know i can preach this friends i'm closing come on musicians i can preach this because i'm not perfect and i haven't always been as under authority as i wanted to be but i caught the principle early on and me and my wife seek i just told brother george or someone there the other day every major decision that we make in our lives we're making some now with business and different things we call somebody i remember i told a brother yesterday i said i said major decisions i believe in accountability accountability i don't do it as an alone i don't exercise my authority alone i say get a brother in christ you go we used to call brother cop he's passed away now major financial decisions we make in our life so what do you think of this here's the picture what do you think of it because i'm not afraid of counsel and when it comes to big decisions i don't want to just read my bible i want god with skin on i need god and if you're not going to go to somebody if you don't believe that god has skin on but if you know that god can speak through his body and god can speak through a righteous man you submit yourself to it say give me let me know what you think this relationship with this guy or girl give me i'm not afraid of anything tell me what you think tell me your gut feeling you're not afraid of it that's the type of people that jesus looks and says you know what just like jesus said i have not found so great of faith not in israel this man's going to get healing in his home because he understands it's not about me the pharisees are stumbling at my flesh it's always been the skin test in every age it's not been people rejecting god it's rejecting the skin he comes in it's always the skin test and you may not like the skin that's preached to you this morning but i love you anyway what was the song we were going to sing knife is in your hands let's stand and lay our hands on one another and pray thank you for your attendance thank you for your attention you have a life here this morning i'm not in control of that life no man should be but the authority of god you should put that you should bring your life completely underneath the authority of the word of god like watchmenis said we should we should want to purge ourselves we should want to say any of this principle of satan if it's still in us or take that out of me may i find the protection underneath the very glories of god underneath the wings of god how many want to just be how many know that under the wings of god is protection i want to live under his wings i don't want to be on top of his wings or no protection under his wings pray for that brother and sister next to you heavenly father we humbly ask you to make the word live to us this morning make it live in my heart make it live in these dear precious people's hearts and lord jesus i know i've been harsh and maybe straight this morning and spoken boldly but lord i don't mean it in any offense i mean it so that people can find that place that position lord is so blessed of you many things to work out many family issues and family problems but lord your word has authority in it i pray for my brother and sister i am laying my hands on my brother and sister grant strength to that person grant leadership to that person lord give them guidance lord by the holy spirit maybe they have to go with god with skin on and talk to another brother or sister in the church and get some advice and counsel maybe they need to do that whatever it is but you provide what's needed lord that we do not live our lives as islands or someone that's just exercising our own will but we're submissive to the perfect will of god we heard it wednesday night brother george saying in his permissive will or his perfect will lord we just say to you we don't want to be in your permissive will we want to live in your perfect will may we die out to this principle of satan this principle of lucifer who undermine and begin to question and debate and influence others the wrong way oh god there ought to be an altar in our heart this morning crying out for repentance forgive me lord for saying things that i shouldn't say forgive me lord for saying things are disrespectful to the men of god saying things lord the disrespect in front of my children forgive me father this morning forgive me wash me of that let me never say it again let me say nice things about one another let me say nice things about god's men lord let me say respectful encouraging things lord and you'll work it all out by the holy ghost granted father fathers we submit to you all of our lives we're not afraid of the subjection of god we're not afraid of your authority it's love lord and we're appreciative of it thank you for your prophet thank you for your righteous man thank you in my life lord that you put righteous man in my path thank you lord that i had something in me to submit and listen to them thank you for your prophet thank you for the message and the word that he spoke it's we're still feeling the effects in our families of this token that came your holy ghost in the end time we're thankful for it lord i'm thankful for the principles of god the principles of your word and that you've given us answers even answer to the devil's question lord we're thankful for it we rejoice in the word in jesus name amen amen turn to that person say i love you brother i love you sis i'll be with you encouraging you standing by you encouraging you loving you on to the coming of the lord i be with you tell them go ahead tell them next to you it's okay tell them you love them tell them i support them this isn't just warm and fuzzy this is this is real can you say man knife is not my own singing gideon
