========================================

I am here by myself my family wanted to come just didn't work out for them to come and my wife especially wanted to be here I was actually my wife just loves Brother Paul's Ministry people got have if you're allowed to have favorite preachers brother Paula Fontaine is my wife's and one of mine my favorite in fact I was supposed to get your autograph brother Paul I think I'll get that uh and a selfie also for the Paul so I'll be sure to get that I know she's streaming so she's getting a good laugh with her face red right now amen you love the Lord certainly do appreciate brother Paul and the church here and his friendship over the many years just even as a young man as Ministry at such a great profound effect on my life and I'm sure the life of many others in the ministry of this church amen those of you that Minister here amen I just pray that this weekend would just be an encouragement for you amen I know that there's any time there's any type of meetings or special services or you invite someone in there's there's a work that goes into that so I pray God would pour back into you uh twice threefold amen what you've put in and blessing and bless you amen with his word Judges chapter 13 and I just want to begin reading here we're going to just begin reading here at verse one and read a few verses I'm going to minister to you tonight on something that the Lord just quickened to my heart even right before just there in the back office and uh just wanting to wait on him and be obedient to the Holy Spirit you believe that Lord has all things in control even the little small details you know the Lord is in the small little details go read The Book of Leviticus when God tells Moses how to build the Tabernacle it wasn't generic it wasn't just build me a building build something nice build something beautiful but God was very detailed specific engineered exactly the way I've don't deviate Moses from any part of it build it exactly as you see it the colors the jewels the the vessels the how the the measurements down to the very inch to the centimeter you know what that tells me about God God's not generic and there's not just a generic way that Lit pleases the Lord but I believe that that God is very specific he's got a specific card and I believe the Lord's in the smallest details of our life even in the simple things and so tonight we just want to minister to you something very simple upon our heart and I'm going to title this the value of the spirit the value of the spirit verse 1 of Judges chapter 13. and the children of Israel did Evil again in the sight of the Lord and the Lord delivered them into the hand of the Philistines 40 years verse 3 and the angel of the Lord appeared unto the woman and said unto her behold now Thou Art Barren embarrassed not but Thou shalt conceive and bear a son now therefore beware now therefore beware I pray thee and drink not wine nor strong drink and eat not any unclean thing for the Lo Thou shalt conceive and bear a son and no razor shall come on his head for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God notice this from the womb so in other words God's purpose for your life didn't begin when you gave your heart to the Lord or when you caught the revelation of the message but God's purpose for you actually started before you ever breathed your first breath and he made a promise and he had a vision and he has a plan and long before you ever came to be or ever came to your first struggle God already charted your course from the Cradle to the Grave how many Believers we have here that would believe that for low than that the child should be a Nazareth unto God from the womb and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines the woman came and told her husband saying a man of God came unto me and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of God very terrible which is our English word and actually the word there is awesome but I asked him not when she was neither told me his name but he said unto me behold and she repeats the words but notice what this mother says here behold Thou shalt conceive and bear a son and now drink no wine nor strong drink nor eat any unclean thing for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death how powerful is the purpose of God when God purposes something in a life and so much that God's purpose never left Samson's life even though Samson left God's purpose notice here then the manoaan treated the Lord and said oh my Lord let the man of God which thou did Sin come again unto us and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born God hearken to the voice of minoan the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field but Manoa her husband was not with her let's just bow our heads together maybe if you have something upon your heart that you just want us to pray about maybe here tonight before you just want to raise the hand and say Lord come and meet my need you just want to hold that hand up to the Lord right now Lord Jesus father you see our hands Lord that are up my hands both Lord right now God I just at this moment Lord there's nothing in me Lord Jesus I think of myself standing here Lord and who am I God just nobody Lord and have nothing in myself Lord that I could give anybody Lord that would be of any kind of Eternal benefit Lord I can say like David what is man that thou art mindful of him the son of man that thou visiteth him Lord I just right now God surrender my vessel Lord the words that I've have upon my heart the thoughts Lord Jesus father and I come subservient now Lord to your spirit believing Lord that it's in this place Lord a place father that's been energized by singing and by Worship in my father a spirit of Faith Lord that is in this building God I pray Lord that you would come down reach down lord to every hand that's went up behind those hands Lord is a need that's represented and I pray God that you would come and meet the expectation of that Heart Lord you know what we have need of long before we can even ask and God I didn't even know I would be preaching this here today Lord I'm not prepared for say Lord as I would want to be but I've just obeyed you Lord and I pray God that you would come and use my vessel Lord as I would just open my mouth father I pray that you would use me Lord as a weapon of warfare to tear the devil's Kingdom down may it be Lord granted to each heart each mother and father and young person oh the light Lord that's here Grant it to us now Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you can be seated it's an amazing scripture you read here in judges and we're just going to read just a few uh more portions of scripture here and then come to a thought but I would just like to minister to you here just for a moment on the value of the spirit it's a powerful thing when you think of the life of Samson and you think of the purpose that God had placed in his life even before Samson was born God had already predetermined a purpose in his life and he had already long before he was born God had already had the gifts that he was going to pour in this man's life he comes to his mother and father and he makes them a covenant a promise and says you're going to conceive you know Israel had been in backslidden in sin and the Bible says that they were oppressed by the Philistines but the reason the Philistines were oppressing them is because a lifestyle of running from God and Disobedience to the Lord had brought the Philistines upon their life and now God was going to bring them a savior this is the word that the Bible uses for judges in fact if you read that what the Bible the Jewish Bible That's the word that it uses is that these were judges not in judicial terms of a judge who presides over a case but actually the word is savior that God would begin to save them from their oppressors it's the same word we use from for Jesus is that he would be the Savior but he wasn't just coming to deliver us from oppressors but from sin the real oppressor of humanity but Samson was a savior he was his this was the purpose of his life that God had long before he came to to be and God had already purposed something it already planned it already uh orchestrated or you could say he charted it out from the cradle all the way to the grave and God said I'm going to anoint this man's life I'm gonna I'm gonna have a special purpose for this man's life and I've already got all of the junctures and all of the crossroads and all of the decisions I've already got them all mapped out and you know long before you ever come to a decision God already has a place and has a way for you to take God already has a perfect will and a perfect plan he's not aimlessly in heaven trying to figure your life out and just up there randomly and I wonder what they'll come out to be and I wonder what kind of value I could get out of their life and I I wonder what kind of a purpose I could bring from them but I believe that God puts you in a place specifically in a state in a city and a school and a family and a church and a condition and maybe a hard circumstance that you don't even understand but let me just preach to you for a moment and say you're equipped for the job that God has in your life whether you feel equipped tonight or you feel you don't have the instructions brother Bynum said and why Christ speak God a man God puts in a man the equipment for his life he's born with the equipment already inside of him and so there's nothing that happens in our life that makes God nervous there's nothing that gives him stress or or worry or anxiety he's never second-guessing his purpose that he placed in your life you notice even all the way through Samson's life no matter where he went God never second guess the decision he made to pick Samson he never second guessed the decision to pick David he never when David Fell with Bathsheba at God never second guessed or thought I made a mistake or or there's been some catastrophe that's happening oh I've got to abort my first plan but let me just say this God already gave you the the answer to your problem the solution is already here tonight and he's not out there worried and wondering and stressful and worried about how it's happening I don't care what event you want to give me tonight world events who's in the White House who's going to be in the White House listen it's not Kim Schumann votes or people's votes that puts a leader over a country or over a nation but God said I raise up a nation and I'd bring down a nation I'll raise up a leader and I'll bring down a leader to accomplish his purposes even brother Branham in the message countdown begins to say that even Meta Even science has achieved great achievements but did you know brother random said even the all the achievements man has ever accomplished God was the one who put it in the heart of mankind to accomplish that achievement he takes the horse and buggy and he says it was a great achievement by man now I don't understand how the horse and buggy or I'm sorry not the the the the the the you know the horse and buggy with a buggy with wheels and you say my goodness you know what that's that's a that's an achievement a will is an achievement well to God it was a great achievement that man learns to transport himself and he says then God goes further and and he says and then man discovers the automobile and the combustion engine and he says but notice each time man was achieving something it was only representing that God was wanting to release something to his church and so man would understand combustion engines and man would understand a flight and and travel by air and then they would they would they would understand they would they would discover the astronaut age but brother Branham said all those were measured by something God was doing come on you know the message it was something God was doing in his church that's why the prophet says just about the time the Wright brothers were taking flight and getting up off the ground there was a little group of people in Azusa Street in California that was starting to spiritually come out of this Dimension and move up into the upper atmospheres and so you see nothing happens that takes God off guard my of that Revelation would ever drop into your heart and do you some good here tonight do you realize nothing ever happens nothing ever stresses him out for God actually it's already taken place that from the beginning to the end history is just God's story we break it up and say it's his story that's exactly what it is the prophet of God would call it a drama and so there's actors to that drama there's people that play certain parts to that drama and God already Anointed The Evil and he already anointed evil leaders he anointed Pharaoh he anoints uh evil Nations he anoints Good Men He anoints bad men they're all controlled by his purpose sorry man and so nothing happens for God that takes him off guard it's like watching a rerun it's like watching a rerun for God everything's already taken place the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world that's why God never gets discouraged when you get discouraged that's why God never loses faith when you lose Faith because he already knows in the end it doesn't matter what it looks like right now [Applause] in the end they're going to be an overcomer it's like watching a ball game you ever watched your family been with the person who's watching their favorite team you know and they get so wrapped up into a sport and wrapped up into their you know their Champion whoever it is uh you know whether it's I don't care what sport you like here in football or basketball or no matter what it is and they get so wrapped up in that team or that person or that whoever it is that they're they get so stressed out the further uh Victory and the further that team goes in the tournament the more the stress level goes up and higher if they would have lost in the first round I would be okay but now it's getting closer now we're down to the semifinals and and boy when it comes to the final I don't care what's what what it is man you know some of those people they can't even be in the room to watch the game they're so stressed out the biggest most moments that the most highest you know most what would be the most exciting crescendos and and the most excited moments and they can't even watch it I don't even want to see it just turn it off and they'll walk out of the room I've been with them before I was at a restaurant one time ordering some takeout food and man I walked in that place and it was dead silent I was like what in the world is going on there's there you know I don't know what's happening a restaurant that's usually loud and and you know shaking the walls are usually shaking and it's dead silent and I walk in there and I realize there's TV screens and everybody's just glued to this big college football game I don't even know who it was it was a big championship game and you can just feel the tension and the stress and before you know it people are getting up walking out I don't even want to see it I don't even want to watch it I just walked out of there I thought wait here's your team they've made it to the final moment here's the big game here's the big moments the fourth quarter there's only a minute left and you don't even want to watch it they're under so much stress they're under so much anxiety but you ever watch that same game with the man who's watching the rerun of the game where his team won it's a completely different atmosphere it's a completely different feeling because he already knows what's happened he already knows in the end his team won the game anyways oh friends if you could ever get a revelation of the backside of the book that in the end you've already won your team already won the game that means it doesn't matter when he fumbles the ball it doesn't matter what happens in my life God's put a purpose in my life so it done my present condition doesn't matter because in the end I'm gonna win can you say Amen tonight so Samson's Samson's life is Anointed long before he ever comes mom before he ever breathes his first breath he's already got a perfect course a perfect a perfect uh a charted course that God's already made for him you know life is an amazing thing from the Cradle to the Grave and let me say it this way life is an array of choices you have choices that are large and then you have choices that are smaller and Samson's life was a life that was made up of some big decisions and some very small decisions and ultimately it was Samson's choice on what he valued or what he considered important and that would be what he prioritized in his life you know you will always prioritize what you consider valuable can we be practical here for a moment you will always prioritize or put emphasis on the things that you consider to be valuable to you and you know if a certain person values a certain thing and maybe you don't share that same value it's sort of like art you know I don't I don't value art I don't understand art I guess Modern Art that's when you understand it is when you don't understand it I think brother Paul but I don't I don't understand art but you take a person who understands and they value that and I look at some pieces of artwork and it's shocking that the price and here's people that are bidding it at you know an auction and and the price is going from five to seven to ten thousand dollars and twenty thousand I'm thinking oh it's just a painting that a certain person painted and and it doesn't make sense it's just a blob of of colors and to me it doesn't look like nothing but do you know that a person who values that they can see the value in it and they'll give they'll give money that they'll they'll they'll go on a search they'll they they hold that place in high regard and high esteem because they value it and so Samson's priorities were controlled by his values values are such an important thing in our life and so his life starts out in Judges 13 you can read it here and and we're just going to turn if you had your Bible turn there with me and we're just going to read a couple paraphrase a few things but go through this maybe uh uh slowly so let's just read here she conceives and has a son and the woman Bears son and called his name Samson and the child grew and the Lord blessed him and the spirit of the Lord began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zora now notice so it's very evident and very clear that there was a season in Samson's life there was a a time frame where the spirit of the Lord was moving upon Samson's heart ever so there was a time in his life where he valued the spirit of God he valued the gift that God had placed in his life and he operated under that anointing that God had placed upon him so we know that they're from the scripture that and the Bible does it and judges it doesn't cover every little detail and we don't really know how many years elapsed unless the Bible tells us that we don't know the time frame of how much time elapsed between chapter 13 and chapter 14. but we do know that there came a point in Samson's life where he's he's making decisions he's making choices and from the time that you're you're very young you begin to make choices in your life and you have responsibilities and and choices are so important so important the choices that we decide the things that we decide every decision and whether it's a large one or a small one ultimately it's every choice in our life that holds a certain consequence and and whether that's a good consequence or a a bad consequence even the things that we listen to and the friends that we choose and the the things that we allow to enter into our homes or into our lives into our minds and the very little things I'm getting down just to the very small things that we choose where we choose to live what church we go to where we choose employment we have to make these decisions what we choose to do with our time you see brother Brandon says God cannot push us through some kind of little pipe and put us on the other end and and then say blessed is he that overcometh brother Adam says what kind of overcoming would that be you didn't overcome anything if it has pushed you through a little pipe on the other side and just pushed you through but the prophet says but you've got to make the decision for yourself you see there there Comes A Time in your life when God is not going to no longer push you he's no longer going to unction you he's no longer going to press you he's going to leave the decision to you to make the choice reminder of brother Brandon's Vision over his life through Danny Henry and the prophecy that's spoken out and it says because you chose the harder way and it was the path of your choosing and he says behold it's my way there's a great portion of Heaven not on Earth because sometimes the choices that we make don't bring Heaven to Earth oftentimes they bring discouragement and Torah and sometimes in our life they bring great adversity and so in the larger Grand picture what we find is after you look and you see a trajectory and you see a graft of the from the beginning to the end and and what you find when you sort of zoom out from the grand picture of life or zoom in you find rather that you see a life that was made up of a choice after Choice after Choice after Choice and then those small choices turn into a pattern and then that pattern leads to a certain trajectory maybe an ebb and flow in a life and ultimately your final destination of where you end up in life or eternity will simply be the result of choices you made and so you can look at your life now and you can understand that you've arrived at the spot where you're at now whether you whether whether you like it or you don't like it whether it's good or bad whether it's peaceful or stressful whether it's joyful or sad you've arrived at the place in your life and you're ultimately your destination and where you've arrived is based upon the choices you've made very natural I'm I'm speaking here for a moment very natural choices I'm not talking about ethereal things and spiritual things even per se but you know sometimes serving the lord is not some great ethereal kind of you know thing that's just you know overflowing all the time with Jitter sometimes serving the lord is a very natural simple it's the very little simple things that you choose to do when you don't want to do it and so Samson learns this as the Bible said God anoints his life now we know that he wasn't filled with the Holy Ghost uh in the sense of how that we're filled but he was filled very much like other men even David in Psalms 51 when he prays I pray that your Holy Spirit not depart from men you have even John who was filled with the holy ghost from uh you know his uh but but the Bible says in John chapter 7 it speaks of the spirit and it says he that believeth after me shall out of his belly flow rivers of Living Water and if you read in your your Bible in parentheses it says but he spoke of the spirit which had not yet been given so we know that the difference between a man like Samson or a man like David or a man like Noah a man like Jonah these men were Anointed with the spirit of God that there was an anointing that came over upon their life this was the Breath of God this is what the word for breath means or spirit means in the the Bible it actually means the the word is ruach which is the wind or the breath and man that God breathed into his nostrils of the breath of life and Man became a living Soul so this was the enabling power it was the enabling force it was the the spirit of God that that was going to enable them to do things that no other man could do or to be things that no other man could be that's what anointed prophets of God it was the very ruach the spirit the breath of the Living God job speaks of it and says the breath the ruach of God is in my nostrils you can you can read this and it goes all the way through the Bible it was it was the life of God or in essence it was the spirit or the anointing of God that was upon Samson you say then what was the difference between Jesus and Samson the difference was is that Samson had just a portion of that of of that Spirit where Jesus was the fullness of the godhead bodily so Jesus was going to be all that Samson and David and Jacob and Joseph and all of the Mighty Men of God he was going to be all of those in one man the Bible would say this way he had the spirit without measure but Samson we know has the spirit of God anointing his life and and so he's he's filled he's filled with the spirit of God from the very from his birth and and it is a very special thing I just saw him obeying the Holy Spirit here tonight and trying to be sensitive to his to the unction of the Holy Ghost let me just say this it's a very special thing when God fills you with the spirit it's a very special thing when God anoints your life and when God anoints the gift that he's placed in you and I don't care what capacity you serve whether it's a mother to a child let me just say that's a gift that God anoints in your life and it's a very powerful thing when God anoints don't take that for granted don't let it become common but it's a very special thing when God anoints Samson's life and then the Bible says he's going to begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of their oppressors and so we know God's people the Bible says we're under oppression and so Samson's going to come there and he's an anointed vessel he's a consecrated vessel this is what the hair the Nazarite vow spoke of that the hair was was would be called the crown of consecration and it was just an outward that what the power was not in necessarily the outward uh external substance or appearance but the outward appearance was only the representation of a heart that was dedicated or consecrated to the Lord that is what anointing is you see an anointing is not just a feeling that comes over your body an anointing actually in the Bible it is the word Schumann and and it's actually simply the very most simple definition of the word anointing is to smear or to rub with oil just what it means to smear or to rub what does it mean when you would anoint a man you were taking anointing oil and you were anointing that man they would take a king who was going to be anointed to lead a nation and a prophet like Samuel would come over David and he would pour that anointing and that anointing would then come from that the promise of that purpose and it would anoint that man's life so you say brother Matt what was the anointing the anointing was simply the transfer of God's purpose to a life let me say that again the anointing and anointing were is just a transfer of a promise of Jesus that's why we pray for you and when the Bible says in the Book of James let them let the Elders of the church they have those that are sick amongst you let them be Anointed with oil what are we doing when we anoint you with oil there's nothing special about the oil there's not so that you can get oily or have oil on your head but we are representing a promise of Jesus and that anointing is to transfer that from the mouth of Jesus to the pages of a Bible to the faith inside your heart and that promise comes into your body [Music] and so do you realize when a man was anointed he was literally baptized with the purpose from Jehovah that's why we sing the song I am not my own I'm bought with the price so God when God anoints a life he's claiming that he's taken his purpose he's taken his his anointing with his which is his purpose and he anoints that man's life and so that that anointing would come over Samson and it was a power it was it was a supernatural a supernatural strength that would come over this man's life that's why it means what it meant when he was born a Nazarite unto God in other words it wasn't going to be a vow that he took as a Nazarite vow but Jesus was born the same way John the Baptist the same they were a Nazarite unto God they were consecrated holy dedicated for the purposes of God in other words you say brother Matt what does that mean it means it's a person who says Lord I am making myself available I am making my body my vessel my mind my mouth my words I want you to know Holy Spirit I'm making myself available and so that that Nazarite was available for God to use oh I just want to say Lord I want to make myself available I want you to know Lord I'm I'm emptying myself and I want to become available to your spirit amen and when you make yourself available to the Holy Ghost you've got to completely let go of all of your preconceived ideas let go of all your Ambitions let go of all of your goals and your dreams and your plans you see when you want to be anointed of God and the spirit of God comes upon your life you've got to be annoying you've got to be available to the Holy Spirit to use and many times your plans and your dreams and your Ambitions conflict with what God is wanting and so God God visits this man and he and he's he has many victories that tonight we can read about and so God is saying to Samson I've laid out to Manoa I've laid out the blueprints for his life even before he was born I've laid out the path of charted the course and it was my plan it was his plan it was his calling it was his anointing that God seen from the beginning all the way to the end and he never lost the vision of that purpose are you hearing me or tonight Church no matter where Samson went God never lost the vision for Samson's and we know the scripture very well and I think it's a Jeremiah 29 and it says for I know the thoughts that thou has that I have for you thoughts of not of evil but thoughts of good and to bring you to and expected end this is where it expected means an anointed or consecrated in or a pre-purpose predestinated plan God is saying I know the thoughts here's the thoughts I've had towards you not of evil but to bring you to an expected end I've got a purpose for your life I've raised rose you up for such a time as this and what the Bible is saying is that God charts the course of every life with specific details purposes instructions and equipment for the job even Pharaoh was raised up for a purpose whether it was evil or whether it was good Judas was raised up for a purpose and let me just preach her and say God's family is raised up for a purpose listen to me Church there are people that fulfill the Church of lady asea that's lukewarm and cold and formal and Powerless and but let me just preach and say that's not your scripture that's not your anointing you are not the code formal Church of the end time we are the Overcomers of ladies here and there is an anointing upon the word of God to bring that to pass in your life and so he purposed it he rose him up for this purpose and anointed him and that was so powerful you would think that just the anointing of Jehovah would be enough for a man's life you would think that the anointing of the Holy Ghost that could take a man and give him some Supernatural strength that would be enough to bring Samson from the cradle all the way to the vision that God had of him surely brother Matt Samson's life was a life that was so anointed that he never deviated from the purpose or plan of God oh no but do you see even with all of that powerful purpose man is still made up of memory conscience reasoning imaginations affections and he has something so powerful that God gave him something called choice the ability to choose for your self to choose to make a decision to decide God gives man free moral agency judges 14 we'll just go through it very quickly and he says and Samson went down to Timnath saw a lot woman and Tim Nath of the daughter of the Philistines and came and told up and told his father mother said I've seen a woman and Tim nothing of the daughter of the Philistines now therefore get her for me to wife boy imagine if your children told you that Mom then his father and his mother said unto him is there never a woman among the daughters of thy Brethren are among all my people that thou goest and take a wife of the uncircumcised Felicity and Samson said unto his father get her for me for she pleasesth me well now I'm going to show you something so powerful because to any believer you would you would you would it would be no different than Manoa you'd be no different than this mother and father and to say I listen son is there not a Believer here's they're not is they're not someone here amongst your own people that you've got to go take a wife of the Philistines listen it was never God's perfect will for Samson to take a wife outside of God's chosen elected People Israel it is never God's perfect will never but notice what the Bible says here in this the Bible says word verse 4 but his father and mother knew not that it was of the Lord so you mean God takes things that makes no sense to us and God says actually I'm using this for a certain purpose in a certain special mission that you have no idea about and if I told you you wouldn't understand it anyway so I'm going to keep it from you why couldn't God have said Manoa down and said no manila listen don't say that it's actually me but God never tells him that he keeps it from him they didn't know it was of the Lord because he sought an occasion upon the Philistines so notice this we know the story that Samson goes down to this woman we know that the chaos that ensues and the collateral damage and there's men that are murdered and the whole house has destroyed him and and and we we can we can move on from that he comes from there and we come to Judges chapter 16. just turn over in your Bible just a couple of scriptures Judges chapter six and I won't belong here tonight then when Samson to Gaza and saw there a harlot and went in unto her and told it was told the Gazette sand Samson has come hither they could passed him and laid weight for him all night in the gate of the city and were quiet all the night saying in the morning when it is day we shall kill him and Samson lay till midnight and arose at midnight and took the doors of the Gate of the sitting the two posts and went with him bar and all and put them upon his shoulders and carried them up to the top of a hill that is before Hebron and it came to pass afterward that he loved a woman in the valley of sorek whose name was Delilah so you notice what you see here from the little preview of The Bible just a little bit of Samson's life you notice this pattern of of making the wrong decision and all the while there's Liars in weight ing to destroy him the whole time even you just read about it there with this woman in Gaza that there's there's liars and weight and they're just waiting for the moment they're waiting for the moment Samson moves on from there he lays to midnight we don't know what went through Samson's mind they're laying on his bed that night could maybe value and start to look at his life and start to take inventory of all of the decisions and all of the harm and all of the chaos that sin had brought him and the Bible says he rose up at midnight and he's good he has a great Victory and there's a great Victory and Triumph and then the spirit of the Lord comes upon him and and he comes from that you know that most dangerous spot you can be in that most dangerous cycle you can be in where the Holy Spirit brings such conviction to your life and he gets your attention and you begin to survey your own life and you repent and you say Lord I'm sorry but the word never really takes real effect down it moves down maybe to the conscience and the memory maybe moves to an emotional realm but it never goes down into that Soul where real Faith or doubt really the real you is down inside of that soul and so you find Samson just coming out of those tears and going right back into the lap of another harlot and he goes on this cycle of sin and repentance and sin and repentance and sin and repentance and sin and repentance just a cycle and a cycle you know it's actually very typified in Samson's life you have on a on a one single man scale of actually a representation of what the entire Book of Judges was it was just a cycle of repentance and sin and repentance and sin Penance and sin and actually if you read the Book of Judges it happens seven times and God would sin to deliver and under that deliverer they would repent and the Bible says it this way all the days the people lived holy unto the Lord all the days of the judge but when the judge died the people went back to the parasites and Hittites and jebusites the Bible would say it that way it would say as long as the as the judge was alive the people served the Lord and as long as he was there notice that you notice what's so important there's certain anchor points in certain people's life and it's amazing sometimes when you dissect and you really pull back the layers of what's really holding people to the truth you want to know where a person's anchor really is start removing some of those anchor points and watch what happens to their life and you watched it over and over again if a Grandpa or Grandma or maybe some Pastor in it the Grandpa's a pastor and they're in church from the time they're young and they're alone you know loving the Lord serving the lord believing the message believing the truth but you know if that person's never anchored if it if his anchor and his faith is resting upon that one single individual then what happens when you uproot and that Grandpa passes away or that church falls away and then you remove that Anchor Point from their life and they become like a boat floating down the tide and that Anchor Point when it's removed from his life from their life when that judge would die it seemed like as long as that judge was there the people served the Lord they came close to the Lord but then that man would die and then the Bible says Israel would slide back down into City and seven times they come to this cycle of death and Samson's life is really just typifying a representative of the condition of God's family and Samson goes and he goes further than that to Delilah and and hear the entire time the parents are there and they're pleading with Samson and and they're they're they're trying to get his attention I don't know why I'm preaching this here tonight and we're so obeying the Lord so just stay with me here I believe it's for somebody maybe someone that's here tonight that won't be here tomorrow I don't know I'll leave that up to the Lord the Lord does this does his job and he does it well and then this mother and father trying so hard to get his attention pastor's trying the deacons are trying the church is trying you know here was the problem with Samson is all Samson's scene was Mom and Dad what he couldn't see was that Mom and Dad were actually vessels of Mercy they were vessels of Mercy they were roadblocks these these were hazard signs that God had put in Samson's life turn around do not enter go the other way and flashing lights to say that you're going the wrong direction do not enter wrong way and he put barricade but all Samson could see was mom that's just mom telling me and that's just that that's just the pastor and he just leans a little bit legalistic and that's the only reason he's even saying those kind of things I got this figured out and I can go my own way and I it's all right it'll all be good and he doesn't realize that those are vessels of Mercy trying to say turn around stop thinking that way bring that thought captive to the Holy Ghost stop thinking your thoughts will eventually develop your habits and your habits will develop your character and your character would determine where you go in life and all they can see was mom and dad you didn't know it was a barricade stop don't enter Road closed you know how many people would get in their vehicle and just go through barricade after barricade after barricade him Road closed and flashing lights and do not enter and you just go barreling through all of those and busting out signs and going down the road who would do that but do you realize this is oftentimes what believers do when God sends warning after warning after warning after warning and we just go through it and through it and through it and through it and through it and his life eventually takes a turn as we know and his eyes are put out and he he's he's blind and he's shaved we we won't cover the whole life of Sampson here tonight I'm preaching to you on the value of the spirit I want you to turn to Genesis chapter 28 if you had your Bible we're just going to look at one more man let's look at Genesis chapter 28. I'm just going to read here starting at verse 13 and behold the Lord stood above it and said I am the Lord God of Abraham my father and of the god of Isaac and the land wherein thou liest to thee will I give it unto thy seed and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth and thou shalt spread abroad to the West now let's just move on down here to verse 16. uh verse 15. I'm sorry and behold notice this promise of god notice this is powerful and behold I am with thee that's a powerful thing that Jehovah is saying to Jacob behold I am with thee and I will keep thee and all the places the decisions the choices when you need to go right I'm going to tell you to go right when you need to go left I'll tell you to go left when you need to turn around notice Jacob I'm going to be with you at all the Junctions from the days of your adolescence to the days of young married life to the days of odor and your children are teenagers to the time of raising small children to the time of grandparents all the way from the Cradle to the Grave I want you to know my promise Jacob is a covenant I will be with you amen and all the places whether thou go I'm going to stay right beside you and Jacob you're going to go a lot of places the Lord never told you to go you're going to go around a lot of roads that God never told you to go down but I want you to know my promise I'm going to be with you no matter where you go I'll be with you in all the good times all the bad times the times of Sorrow the times I've laughter the times of Joy the times of pain I'm going to be right beside you this is how powerful the promise of God is in your life that no matter where you go I will be with you Jacob and we'll bring you listen to the promise again to this land I will bring you I will bring you for I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have spoken to the of Jacob a woke out of the sleep and he said this is a powerful thing the Bible says and he said surely the Lord is in this place and I knew it not and he anoints a stone and he takes oil and he begins to pour oil over this Stone and he and then Jacob Ray rose up early in the morning the Bible says and he put it had a stone for his pillows and poured oil and he called the name of the place Bethel but the name of the city was called loose so anoints this place this is a place of dedication of consecration it's a very special place in his life so vivid is the dream that Jacob wakes up out of his sleep and and he doesn't know what to do he's just beside himself and he just knows that the Lord had done something so special it takes oil he takes the stone there's nothing special about the stone per se it had been there the night before but now God had visited this place and now to that place he dedicates it he memorializes it you say oh you're just being emotional Jacob you're just getting all worked up listen to me later on in your Bible you'll read that God points back at this Stone and noticed what Jacob did to that stone when he anointed it with oil you think God doesn't see when you take a stand and make a move for God you think the Holy Spirit doesn't recognize that and Mark that down in your life and Jacob wakes up he anoints the Sony calls this name of this place Bethel and he says this is something special it's a special place it's a special Memorial no the stone could serve could it could have that anointing or that place or that atmosphere it was something remarkable to Jacob you know why because it was a reminder of something that he valued it was a reminder it was valuable to him that the Holy Spirit had had moved upon him and so he pours this oil and he says I'm going to serve you Lord I'm going to go from this moment and from this day Lord I'm going to serve you I'm going to walk with you and God you can say at this point had anointed his life but I want you to consider something though anointed though a vision though a purpose though a though a mighty experience that this man Jacob had the same man takes his family all of his children and he brings them to Rock Bottom complete shambles and chaos say how would a man under such an anointing under such a power of God and here God Appears to him at Bethel and he appears supernaturally in a dream and he sees a ladder reaching from Heaven to Earth and angels of sinning and descending him sees the Lord and the Lord speaks and says I'm With You Jacob I'm with you in all the places you go and I'll bring you again to this land that I've promised I'll again bring it to I'll bring you to this place and so God you know you notice what God was doing God was joining himself to Jacob he was attaching his promise unconditionally over his life he was adjoining listen you think God didn't know what Jacob was going to do you think God didn't know where Jacob was going to go you think God didn't know the mistakes that this man would made no God knew every single one of them but let me say his promise was greater than all of his mistakes his promise was greater than all of his difficulties I said his promise that he placed over his life it wasn't going to matter where Jacob went God said I'll bring you back to the place that I promised I know that's so simple but I think it's so powerful I will bring you back here I'm joining myself to you Jacob Jacob wakes up surely the Lord is in this place I knew it not how awesome is this place this is none other than the house of God and this is the Gate of Heaven and then we go from that moment he makes a decision I'll follow the lord we go from that moment and that experience and we go 20 long years time elapses elapses so fast time just goes by like that and they're this big and you're that small and then suddenly they're this pick and overnight it just seems how where did time go what happened but all through all of that all of those years and all of those months down to the weeks down to the days down to the hours down to the minutes there was a choice and a decision and a choice and a decision and things in life were becoming valuable and things in life were losing value and things were becoming more important than other things 20 long years of trial and years of sorrow years of grief and years of trouble you say where was God through all of those years brother Matt that Jacob was backslidden and through all of those years that it seemed like Jacob just was completely lost where was God right beside him after leaving Bethel Jacob settles down and he's forgotten completely the glory of this first experience with the Lord he'd become cold and backslitting and carnal and lustful and and so God in Genesis 31 notice this in Genesis 31 if you have your Bible just follow closely with me Genesis chapter 31 I'll give you just a minute for those that are using a Bible to give you just a minute to get to that in Genesis 31 it's powerful if you read it Genesis chapter 31 and notice here what God says to Jacob and and God says here in verse 13. now this is after all of the years 20 long years and here God comes to Jacob and he says I am the god of Bethel I am the god of Bethel but you're not in Bethel Lord he's not in Bethel he long ago long time before had left Bethel he's miles away from that experience but notice God never would identify himself with Jacob's life out of the will of God God can say I am not the god of your sin I am not the god of your backsliding I am the god of Bethel where thou anointest aha so God seem where thou anoint is the pillar where thou vow to vow unto me now arise get thee out from this land and return into the land of thy kindred what do you got to do Jacob get up go back come back to the word Jacob you don't need to make a big deal out of it don't make a big fuss out of it don't let the devil complicate it and make it so yeah complicated all you got to do is turn around and go the other way give back to the word of God Jacob go back to Bethel get up go back in other words Jacob remember you anointed a stone that was a special experience remember how I moved upon you remember how I spoke to you remember that moment don't forget it lest you forget how many times do you see that in the Bible that the children of Israel forget the ways of the Lord and God would call their mind back to remember and say say remember memories a powerful thing you'll either the devil either use it to destroy you or God will use it to reignite your faith remember remember Jacob remember where you came from that's what brother random says in the Ephesian Church age and he talks about that Ephesian church that had left their first love and brother Brandon says evidently something had left their minds they had forgotten the glory and The Wonder of their message remember Jacob go back get up remember all of your promises remember all of your vows that you vowed to me go back to the altar go back to Bethel Jacob there's no power in this there's no victory in this nothing can happen until you come back I want you to notice that powerful principle God will never do anything in your life while you're outside living outside of the will of God outside him backslid and outside of the glory of God God can never operate until you're willing to come back first you say then surely surely brother Matt Genesis 31 we're going to read the next verse chapter 34 and it's going to say Jacob packed up his family got his camels loaded him up and he went back to Bethel no I wish I could read that but that's not what it says instead Jacob in Genesis 33 settles down and shechem and shechem the word in Hebrew you know what it means it means two things going back not back to Bethel for backsliding that's what Beth that's what shechem means and it means a place of burdens do you want to know what it means when you're disobedient to the Lord and you disobey the Lord and you go somewhere he told you not to go do you know what you want to know what place we come to we come to the place of Burden and we lose blessing and we get burdened you know there's a powerful thing when you live under the blessing of God so powerful that you know when it's gone hello so powerful that you know when the blessing of God is gone and Jacob didn't have to look he could kid himself but he knew that something was gone something was missing and in shechem we know the trouble he gets into and his house is Dishonored his daughters raped and and the the the the brothers come and and there's murder in there there's just complete chaos and then God it just it becomes a place for Jacob because of the choices he makes becomes such a place of Burden for Jacob and yet do you know that not one time did he relate his trouble to being out of God's will to be in a place of of of Burden because he had disobeyed the Lord no he's very much like me very much like you the last person that we turn to the last thing we do is to look introspectively at our own life and the first thing we do is blame the pastor blame mombling Dad blame this thing that happened in her life the last thing we do is turn the light down on our soul and say maybe maybe I need to consider my ways and he blames could blame everything in life and God comes to Jacob I want you to notice this let me just say this here for a moment had I been God because I won't put you there you may not like it I'll just put myself there had I been God I can promise you when I came back after all of the times I've tried all the trouble I've went through after all of the times I've tried to get his attention after all the times I've given him mercy and give it him Grace man I would have wanted to give Jacob a real lick and a real talking to to say my goodness Jacob What's it gonna take really I mean come on Jacob What's it gonna take for you to believe what's it going to take for you to understand when's your faith ever come on you really hear again Jacob are you really here at another spot in your life at another time after all the times I've delivered you Jacob you know what Jacob we're done I mean come on man I mean really really Jacob I mean give me a break one time two times three times four times five times wasn't enough I mean really Jacob you know what I've just made my decision I you know you know I got to call it quits with you I've tried I've really put my effort into this thing and I really you know I've tried to be patient I tried to be caring I tried to be long suffering I tried to give you Mercy but you blew it this time Jacob for the last time I am so glad my heavenly father has never spoken those words to me he's never given up on me he's never lost faith in me in fact quite the opposite it seems the more I fell him the more mercy and Grace that I receive that's why their song says it's a Amazing Grace you say amazing brother Matt more amazing every day I serve him his grace becomes more amazing to me never one time does he give up or turn me turn around on me or turn his back on me but he continues to move he continues to speak he continues to preach he continues to love God never gives up on you he never gives up on me he never quits on us let me just tell you I want you to get it in your mind God is never going to give up on you you say what's it going to take for me brother Matt how many times and how many years how many youth camps and how many meetings and how many prayer lines you say what's it going to take God will not stop he will not quit he'll keep pushing he'll keep pressing he'll keep preaching [Applause] God says get it through your head I'm never going to give up on you I'm going to keep pushing and praying and pressing until you believe for yourself I'm never gonna turn around I'm never gonna give up I'm never gonna walk away I'm never gonna call it quits I'm so glad that's the Jesus I serve God instead of chastising him in Genesis 33 Genesis sorry 35. instead of chastising him look at the words of Jehovah to disobedient servant whose life was a mess God speaks to this man in Genesis 35. very first verse God said unto Jacob arise arise hold on God no no no no no no you must have not seen what I see are you surely you've got to address that you got to you got to say something about that Lord surely you're not just going to skip over all of it surely Lord Lord you've got to bring it up you got to say something no God never even makes a mention he just simply gives him the same word he's always gave him did you hear me he gives him the same word that he's always gave him he preaches the same message that he's always preached to him he gives him the same words that he's already gave listen God's word never changes it's still the same message it's still the same power it's still the same anointing arise Jacob go up to Bethel I'm going to say the same thing I've told you from the very first time you made a mistake 12 hair and make their an altar unto God that appeared unto thee when thou fledst from the face of Esau thy brother get up Jacob get up Jacob how am I gonna figure all this out what am I going to do Lord I've came to such a place of failure what have I got to do Lord to get back just get up child that's all you gotta do get up child sometimes we get in a rut in our life and that rut lasts for years and it might have started to something in her life that something happened and then you get bitter in your heart or you maybe someone hurts your do you get a pain or a hurt from something or somebody or some circumstance and then you begin to get distant then years go upon years and you forget even the reason why you're why you why you feel the apathy that you feel you can't even explain you're just in a Rutter and the devil just pours on and makes it more difficult and more complicated almost to a Chasm that you you can't even cross them it just is impossible for you to to get back to God let me just give you the simple message of of the Holy Spirit here tonight you don't have to do anything except get up on your feet and say God I'm coming back to the altar I'm coming back to Bethel I'm coming back to dedication all you got to do is come back like the little woman in the prayer line who comes up to brother Brandon is so frantic and worried about her life you know brother Brandon I've made so many mistakes and I'm so disa sister brother Brandon just begins to discern her heart he says you you want to get back to the Lord you want to get right with the lord it's not yes brother yes I just want to get back and just so worked up and brother Brandon says you're back notice just like that there's no there's no great there's no great kind of egg a thing that she has to go through you've got a desire to get back with God God never left you you might have left him you might have walked away but God stayed right beside you he was there through every decision through every Crossroad their every Junction you want to get back with God you're back right now rise Jacob come back you know what Jacob did that time he gathers up all his idols all of his family he gets where he takes all of his idols and he casts them the Bible says gets rid of all of them it cleans everything he cleans his entire house Jacob said unto his household and all that were with him put away the strange gods that are among you and be clean and change your garments God can do something so powerful with just simple repentance with just simple a real genuine true repentance to say God I Repent of my thinking I Repent of the ways I've thought before I Repent of yesterday I want to be new I want Mercy to be new to my whole family what have I got to do brother Matt cast out all of your Idols throw away all of your gar all of your dirty garments and repent unto God and come back to the Bethel come back to the altar doesn't have to be complicated only we make it complicated we allow the devil to distort and twist our mind and bring so much guilt and so much condemnation listen God never condemns you he might bring conviction on your life but he's never there condemning you and mocking your life he's always there wanting you to come back and Jacob throws it all away all of his ideas you know what that's really what real repentance really is repentance is not a prayer that you pray did you know that repentance is not a prayer come on repentance is not words that you do so many people think they've repented you know like like the man at the bull of Bethesda who had been there 38 years 37 years an invalid and he's laying there at the pool of Bethesda and the Bible says that Jesus compasses everybody as brother Adam takes us so beautifully passes everybody in that crowd and comes to this one man who had a need and he's laying there 37 years you know you say brother man that's so unfortunate this man was there for third 38 whatever it was 38 years uh they're they're in the pool of Bethesda and he's laying there on a mat and he can't walk he can't get up he has no man to pick him up and put him in the water and you know what's so what's so amazing you say that's so pitiful that that happened what bad circumstances and Miss sure no no no after Jesus heals this man he says now go and sin no more so what does it tell you what put this man in this condition sin because sin is destructive to your body your mind and your soul it doesn't just destroy your soul it destroys your mind and destroys your spirit it'll make you someone you never wanted to become and he's laying there 30 some odd years an invalid can't get up Jesus comes to him and Jesus asks him a very the man gives his story you know every time I I I you know I've come yeah there's the Jesus walks up to him and he just ask him a simple question will thou be made whole very simple just cuts right to the chase in other words this is the question do you want to be made home and the man responds and says well every year and the angel of the Lord comes to stir the waters and I have no man to pick me up and put me in the water and people get enough ahead of me and in front of me and I could never get in there and he gives this entire story this long story of all of us and Jesus just you know what Jesus never responds go read your Bible he never replies to the man's long sob story he just simply asks the same question again will you be made whole amen you say why brother Matt you see so many people hate the consequences of sin the drunk the alcoholic loves his alcohol but he hates that it joins his marriage it ruins his job he loses his license he drives a moped no one likes to drive a moped nobody and an alcohol they hate what they hate what the the the torment that sin brings to their life that drug addict he loves the drugs but he hates what drugs does to him you notice there's a very big difference between hating the consequence of sin and hating the sin and true repentance is not notice Jesus never said hey bud man does your back hurt I can imagine laying there you know buddy I mean goodness gracious you got to be in a lot of pain yeah I'm in so much pain I mean goodness I can imagine you got bed sores although oh buddy I feel so sharp notice Jesus never asks any of that you know that alcohol really ruins your life that's so terrible and really you hate that yeah I hate I hate what it's done to me listen everybody hates the consequence of sin but Jesus wasn't asking him do you want to be free of all the trouble that the sin has caused you he asked a very simple question do you want to be free from the sin and there's a big difference in wanting the symptoms and saying God I I don't just hate the trouble I want to be clean from the sin I want the addiction I'm on my mind to be pure my body to be holy I want to be this is what real repentance is when you hate sin and you say I desire Holiness a hunger for righteousness I want the Holy Ghost not because I'm tired of all the trouble in the world but because I want the righteousness of God to clothe and robe me and take my filthiness away take my take all of my dirtiness away from my mind from my mouth from my thoughts I want to be clean you ever get that way to where you just don't like you can we be honest here tonight you ever get to the place to where you look in the mirror and you say I had sometimes I just hate myself I hate who I hate who I can become I hate when I have a temper I hate when I'm angry I hate when I get a bitterness or jealous here you say what is that that's the Holy Ghost Inside of You and so Jacob says I want to throw it all away the Bible says he takes us everything and he gathers his family and he goes back to Bethel and you know what happens at Bethel Jacob's restored chicken's healed Jacob's made whole and he washes away something so powerful about repentance it washes away all of the past all of the stress all of the trouble all of the guilt all of everything behind you you leave it all behind you and Jacob washes it all away and he comes back to that place God says very powerful scripture and I'm just going to close right here just as maybe the musicians could come we're going to close it's eight o'clock something so powerful in the book of Isaiah notice what he says here can a woman forget her suckling child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb yes they may forget yet I do not forget behold I have Graven thee upon the palms of my hands and thy walls are continually before me this word for walls when he says thy walls are continually before me is the word Shoma which literally means to be joined to a wall it's the same as a brick mason who would lay a brick to another brick and it takes mortar he lays the brick to another brick and he's joined and it becomes one whole wall do you know this is what the promise of God that God makes in Isaiah and he says can a woman forget yea they may forget but I can't forget you you say how Lord why can't you forgive me because you've got to understand child I've joined myself to you I'm part of you I've interlaced when you're in prison I'm in prison in other words when you when you when you when you're crying I'm crying when you hurt I hurt let me give you the New Testament language he's a high priest who can be touched by the feelings of your infirmities I want you to stand to your feet tonight and I want you to raise a hand and say Lord God would you be touched could you buy your head with me and raise those hands and say Lord would you be touched by the filling of my infirmity here tonight you know he's a high priest who can be touched and maybe you're here tonight you've heard this sermon that the Lord just I believe gave for somebody here and I preached to you on the value of the spirit maybe you came to a place and you're here tonight and you say Lord I I can take inventory here under this little simple sermon and say Lord I've realized I've not always valued the right things in my life I've not always put enough value and I've allowed maybe the devil or maybe through circumstances or Through Time I've not been able to Value correctly the word in my life then it's my daily bread it's I've allowed things in my life like Samson maybe I've came unaligned or derailed from that purpose or that perfect will that you have for my life but tonight Lord I just want to repent and I want to say God I'm coming back to Bethel I'm coming back to that place of blessing I want to go back lord I want that I want to go back to that place of blessing in my life where I know that I know that I know that I'm serving you in the center of your will and your purpose that you've placed over my life well how many Believers hands have gone up everywhere would say God Place me in the center of that will o God Place me in the center of your purpose that perfect plan and that perfect course that you charted before the foundation of the world Lord I want to come to the center of it tonight God bless those hands up everywhere everywhere now I just want to pray now with every headbound ever I close Lord Jesus father you're the god and all times the good the bad the times of low times the High Times the seasons of our life that are Troublesome the seasons of our life that are happy God you're the God of all times Lord fathers we've ministered here tonight God [Music] you have a place you have a a will a desire a purpose for our lives I pray God that your word would find its Mark here tonight I don't know Lord why you changed me and turned my course around completely but I'm just your servant now Lord and I've spoken the words that you've placed upon my heart I pray God that your children now would become sensitive to the Holy Spirit speaking Let It Be o God I want to say Lord if I've had the wrong values in my life just want to raise my hand and say Lord I want to re-est I want to I want to evaluate everything every decision my habits My Places I go the things I watch the things I listen to the choices that I make that's friends that I choose everything Lord I want to put it all on the table right now and take inventory right now Lord Jesus that's my prayer God if there were to be anything in my life that would be unlike you I just want to repent it repent of it tonight Lord this is what it means Lord when the Bible says that let a man examine himself to make our call in an election sure that if a man would judge himself he wouldn't be judged but when his judged he's chasing of the Holy Spirit God in that chasten and is not a rod just of Correction not just a rod of Lord of us of a whipping God but it's a rod of Correction to correct our ways and to correct our paths or we went wrong bring us back lord Jesus I pray I pray tonight granted Lord granted Jesus we're going to tarry just here for a moment and I'll turn the service back over to brother Paul just let the Holy Spirit just move just for a moment why don't you just raise your hands to the Lord just give him praise here tonight say Lord we worship you father we place you in the highest place we esteem you the greatest treasure the pearl of great price we esteem your word is the greatest treasure you've ever sent to the world it takes first place takes number one God above all else above everything in our life God don't let us serve you out of a life just of of do's and don'ts and a life of rules and regulations but let it be God a relationship that's anointed a real true experience of A Life That's dedicated a spiritual Nazarite consecrated unto God as we dedicate
