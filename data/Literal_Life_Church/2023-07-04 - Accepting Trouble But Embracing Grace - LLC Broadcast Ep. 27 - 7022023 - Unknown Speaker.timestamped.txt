[0:30] there's not a mountain
[0:33] to talk
[0:39] so small
[0:43] that Jesus can resolve is
[0:49] [Music]

[7:19] [Music]
[7:25] [Music]
[7:31] Nathan said to David Thou Art the man
[7:34] thus saith the Lord God of Israel I
[7:36] anointed thee King over Israel I
[7:38] delivered thee out of the hand of Saul
[7:39] and I gave thee thy Master's house and
[7:42] thy Master's wives into thy bosom and
[7:45] gave Thee the house of Israel and of
[7:47] Judah and if that had been too little I
[7:49] would moreover have given unto these
[7:51] such and such things wherefore hast thou
[7:54] despised the Commandment of the Lord to
[7:56] do evil in his sight
[7:57] thou Hast killed Uriah the hittite with
[8:00] the sword and has taken his wife to be
[8:03] thy wife and has slain him with the
[8:05] sword of the children of Ammon and um we
[8:10] realized then that the Uriah was killed
[8:12] because you know he took his wife and
[8:14] then he had Uriah killed on the out in
[8:17] the war so you know that story you're
[8:18] familiar with that there's a God
[8:20] speaking back to him so now watch now
[8:22] the judgments come from God verse 10.
[8:24] now therefore the sword shall never
[8:27] depart from mine house David the sword
[8:29] will never depart from thine house
[8:31] because thou has despised me and has
[8:34] taken the wife of Uriah the hittite to
[8:37] be thy wife thus saith the Lord behold I
[8:39] will raise up evil again so now the
[8:42] judgments continue I will raise up evil
[8:44] against the out of thine own house and I
[8:47] will take thy wives before thine eyes
[8:49] and give them unto thy neighbor and he
[8:52] shall lie with thy wives in the sight of
[8:54] this son for thou did it secretly
[8:59] so part of the pronouncement here is
[9:01] that God was not pleased that something
[9:03] was done secretly
[9:05] you never do anything secretly God knows
[9:09] all things
[9:10] but as a king now he did something
[9:12] secret he didn't do it openly but
[9:14] whatever is done secretly if you're a
[9:16] son and daughter of God it will be
[9:18] revealed openly someday for thou this
[9:21] secretly but I will do this thing before
[9:24] all Israel and before the sun and David
[9:27] sent unto Nathan I have sinned against
[9:29] the Lord and Nathan said unto David the
[9:33] Lord also hath put away thy sin Thou
[9:37] shalt not die now here's where Grace
[9:39] comes in
[9:41] aren't you glad when Grace comes in
[9:44] because David repenteth he says I the
[9:47] Lord hath put away thy sin David and
[9:50] thou shalt not die he should have died
[9:52] he deserved to die but Thou shalt not
[9:55] die how be it because by thy deed thou
[9:58] Hast given great occasion to the enemies
[10:00] of the Lord to blaspheme the child also
[10:03] that is born unto thee shall surely die
[10:05] so Bathsheba Was Pregnant and So then
[10:08] then the next few verses then David
[10:10] starts to appeal to God even though he's
[10:12] been forgiven he starts to appeal to God
[10:15] in fasting and prayer that the child
[10:17] should live that child should live and
[10:19] then you know the story that God says no
[10:21] it would die he pronounced it so we want
[10:24] to get into this this morning and I pray
[10:26] that the Lord will give us an anointing
[10:28] and a spirit there's so many blessings
[10:31] and instruction from this the story a
[10:34] few chapters later I had been referring
[10:36] to the story of amnon a little bit in
[10:40] second Samuel chapter 13
[10:42] and we know that the story of amnon is a
[10:46] very tragic a very terrible story of
[10:49] rape in the Bible and
[10:52] um I would say that it's even more
[10:54] terrible that story is even more
[10:56] terrible to see something like this
[10:58] happen in the royal family of Israel
[11:02] it it wouldn't be expected that we would
[11:05] see a story like this in the Bible but
[11:08] we we know we would see it maybe in the
[11:10] Heathen and in the unbelieving Nations
[11:13] but when we have a story like amnon come
[11:15] up amongst the royal family of Israel
[11:18] the king of Israel that God elected
[11:20] that's kind of unexpected um that this
[11:25] would come out of the very people that
[11:27] are to be upholding the moral laws of
[11:29] God and the Commandments of God and the
[11:32] law of Moses it's just unexpected and
[11:35] yet yet it happened just the same
[11:39] the Bible didn't hide it
[11:42] and thus God did not hide the story
[11:46] God didn't hide the story God left it in
[11:49] his word they recorded it and yet it's
[11:51] here and so if God didn't hide it we
[11:54] don't hide it if God doesn't hide it we
[11:57] don't ignore it and everything God
[11:59] places in this Bible is for our
[12:02] instruction for our Revelation and for
[12:04] our good David in the Bible coming to
[12:07] his throne finally after so many years
[12:10] under Saul and all the transition
[12:12] happening within the message finally
[12:14] David who was the one that was supposed
[12:16] to be God's choice for a king finally
[12:18] David comes to his throne through the
[12:21] help of Gentile Warriors and that's all
[12:24] a mystery for our day David was placed
[12:26] on the throne through the help of
[12:28] Gentile Warriors which is a type of the
[12:30] Bride of Jesus Christ Gentile Warriors
[12:32] that said we believe in you David you're
[12:35] going to be on the throne someday and
[12:37] we're going to fight until we put you on
[12:39] the throne
[12:40] glory be to God
[12:43] but look at the story now look at this
[12:45] in this it had a change of events that
[12:47] we didn't expect David came to his
[12:50] throne through the help of Gentile
[12:51] Warriors everybody's happy he's on the
[12:54] throne
[12:55] and then uh all of his enemies were
[12:59] subdued around him he had victory over
[13:01] all of his enemies they were subdued and
[13:04] so you would think that was it it's done
[13:06] it's come to its Glory the message has
[13:09] come to its Glory but then something
[13:12] started in second Samuel chapter 11 and
[13:15] the story takes another turn for the
[13:17] next several chapters the story The
[13:20] Glory of him being on the throne the
[13:22] glory of all this coming into the place
[13:24] and God's sending a prophet and then put
[13:26] a king on the throne and all this seems
[13:29] like it's all ready to go and then the
[13:31] whole story takes a turn when David sins
[13:37] and it's just it's a it's a it's a turn
[13:39] of events that was not expected can you
[13:42] say Amen he's got victory in mind all
[13:45] the time for your life for the bride
[13:48] he's got the victory in mind at the end
[13:50] can I get an amen this morning
[13:53] so brother Gideon preached on removing
[13:55] the hindrances and so when in a
[13:56] hindrance comes like Aiken Aiken taking
[13:59] uh two things Aiken messed up the Aiken
[14:02] stopped the Battle of AI he ruined a
[14:05] battle that they should have won because
[14:07] you know what he did he stole he it was
[14:10] about money and it was about clothes
[14:18] Babylonian clothing
[14:21] come on people say amen well how did all
[14:24] of Israel start to lose their Victory
[14:26] money
[14:28] and clothes from Babylon
[14:31] is the thing that brought them down
[14:33] and they couldn't have full Victory
[14:35] which is what our brother Gideon
[14:36] preached to us God has to remove the
[14:39] hindrances you have to remove the
[14:41] hindrances you got to search it out and
[14:43] find that gold and find those things in
[14:45] your tent and bring them out and they
[14:47] stoned all of Aiken and his family
[14:49] because why Victory is important to God
[14:52] and you can't have full Victory when you
[14:55] keep the hindrances in your life I'm not
[14:57] repreaching Gideon's message he preached
[14:58] it good enough but I was so excited to
[15:01] know that God's standing there saying I
[15:03] know Israel did this and he didn't say
[15:05] Aiken sin he said all of Israel has
[15:07] sinned and he says I know this has
[15:09] happened this is little this is a glitch
[15:11] this is it I don't like it I'm angry
[15:13] about this and they can't Victory but
[15:15] listen God's saying how can I get this
[15:18] dealt with so I can get the people back
[15:21] to ahai
[15:24] in other words he says oh you blew it so
[15:27] now just try some other cities you won't
[15:29] get a no he took them right back to AI
[15:32] again when God dealt with the hindrance
[15:35] and the hindrance was gone and the sin
[15:37] was out of the camp he directed them
[15:40] right back you're gonna get the victory
[15:42] over AI
[15:44] that's the same God that I served this
[15:46] morning I don't care what happens in our
[15:48] life I don't care what hindrance is I
[15:51] don't care what pain sorrow mistakes sin
[15:55] can you say man if you're a son and
[15:57] daughter of God God has your victory in
[15:59] mind
[16:00] even when you don't have your victory in
[16:03] mind God's got your victory in mind
[16:06] and they were going to go back to ai ai
[16:10] artificial intelligence
[16:16] because why that one has got to be
[16:18] conquered
[16:19] anybody waking up this morning
[16:22] this world is full of artificial
[16:24] intelligence we're affected by it but no
[16:26] devil is going to take the social media
[16:29] and artificial intelligence and we're
[16:31] not going to back down that's something
[16:33] that's got to be conquered in a
[16:35] believer's life oh I can't get enough
[16:37] amens this morning you know it's the
[16:39] truth
[16:40] those cities speak of our victories
[16:42] today sometimes
[16:45] when we make a mistake and God comes in
[16:48] our life and begins to bring
[16:51] because we reap what we saw
[16:54] and he brings the judgments sometimes
[16:56] the judgments we want we want God to
[16:59] affect all of the situation by grace and
[17:02] I can tell you in David's situation he
[17:05] didn't he didn't I should say this in
[17:08] his eyes he didn't give every situation
[17:10] Grace but he gave David Grace
[17:15] he spared David's life
[17:17] but there were other things that he
[17:19] dealt with the rest of his life
[17:22] and we would say selfishly well that's
[17:26] not my God and I
[17:28] he should be able to get rid of all of
[17:30] this that's our perfect world that we
[17:32] want
[17:33] in a perfect world God should have done
[17:35] this and God should have done that and
[17:36] God and so we bring our own judgments to
[17:38] how God should a judge how much grace he
[17:40] should have gave me let me tell you
[17:42] something I'm preaching my final
[17:43] conclusion here is that we we don't
[17:45] deserve anything from God and any Grace
[17:48] that he gives us we don't Embrace and
[17:51] say thank God for your grace
[17:53] thank God that I'm still living this
[17:55] morning thank God that I'm still
[17:57] breathing this morning thank God that my
[17:59] family is healthy this morning thank God
[18:01] that I have a desire to serve God thank
[18:04] God that I love this message you think
[18:06] you gave yourself the love for this
[18:07] message in this word you didn't even
[18:09] give that to yourself God created that
[18:12] love within you
[18:14] people say well he didn't give Grace in
[18:16] this area he didn't give me this and he
[18:18] didn't give me that and he didn't spare
[18:20] my child when do we start navigating
[18:22] navigating God's grace we should be
[18:25] grateful
[18:26] for the grace he gives us
[18:29] and when he offers judgment in the rest
[18:31] of the situation we should be thankful
[18:33] for that too internal trouble in the
[18:37] House of David now because of his sin
[18:40] family trouble
[18:42] sexual sins
[18:45] and many other troubles came to the
[18:47] house of David not just with David's
[18:49] sexual sin but sexual sin became a part
[18:52] of the House of David
[18:55] and I'm not blaming David for that
[18:57] but it has to the commentators and the
[19:00] different ones who write about it
[19:01] they're careful sometimes to attach
[19:04] amnon's sin to David
[19:06] but and you can't do that but there's
[19:10] something to be learned about sexual sin
[19:15] that sexual sin no matter how private
[19:18] and undisclosed or it doesn't get out
[19:21] sexual sin has a way of affecting the
[19:25] household down the road
[19:28] and this scripture proves that
[19:31] so now years now years of trouble is
[19:34] going to come sexual sins in David's
[19:36] house and he started it now all these
[19:38] things you heard of the Heathen Nations
[19:40] some of the same incidences happened in
[19:43] their own camp in our own camp for years
[19:46] we heard it in the heathens but now we
[19:48] hear it in our own camp we hear David
[19:50] it's in it's in the Royal Family
[19:53] many years of trouble and David's house
[19:55] came from it
[19:56] so I don't want the story to end there
[19:58] I'm just going to quickly say and go
[19:59] back to David here but I'm going to
[20:01] quickly say to you in the story it ends
[20:03] in a victory because many years after a
[20:06] lot of trouble in David's house if it's
[20:08] a type of the Bride today and I believe
[20:09] it is then praise the Lord Jesus that
[20:13] wasn't the end because the next
[20:14] Generation raised up under Solomon
[20:16] restoration came a temple was built and
[20:19] guess what God came down and responded
[20:22] back and filled the temple so much with
[20:24] his glory that the minister couldn't
[20:26] even speak
[20:28] I'm telling you people being defeated
[20:31] people under a cloud people underneath
[20:33] uh uh habits and things God is going to
[20:36] deliver this bride from every one of
[20:38] them and God's got your victory in mind
[20:40] can you say amen and this bride God's
[20:43] Gonna Fill his temples with his glory at
[20:45] the end of this thing and take him in a
[20:47] Rapture amen after all that happened and
[20:49] they didn't deserve the glory of God
[20:51] come to they didn't deserve all after
[20:53] all the sexual sin they didn't deserve
[20:55] the glory of God coming down in
[20:56] Solomon's day they didn't deserve it
[20:57] none of us deserve any of it but God has
[21:00] victory in mind for his people and he
[21:02] will come and we know that the people
[21:05] will reap some bad Harvest because of
[21:07] decisions they make but how God says
[21:10] they're reaping because I have a law of
[21:13] sowing and reaping God says in my people
[21:16] today they're reaping there's a law of
[21:19] harvest they're reaping a harvest from
[21:21] bad decisions that they made but God
[21:23] doesn't stay there he says I know
[21:26] they're reaping a harvest but how can I
[21:28] get them to a final Victory so you can
[21:32] be in denial and you can cover up but we
[21:35] learn all this from the Bible we learn
[21:38] from all the Bible we learn from the
[21:39] whole story of David's trouble and I
[21:41] will call this David's sin the kind of
[21:44] the back story of amnon and the back
[21:46] story is events that led up to amnam
[21:49] events that let up and so we know as
[21:51] I've been speaking about amnon there are
[21:53] several reasons that he got where he was
[21:55] at that he can become so possessed of
[21:57] the enemy so possessed of devils and
[22:00] lustful demons that he actually uh raped
[22:03] a girl
[22:05] I'm talking in the Bible now
[22:07] it's amazing and so there's several
[22:09] reasons he got there I spoke about the
[22:11] mind a mind his mind must have been
[22:14] turned over to other thoughts so much he
[22:18] couldn't have got there Eminem couldn't
[22:20] have got there with his mind being
[22:22] completely uh controlled by another
[22:24] spirit
[22:25] and then there's another message I want
[22:27] to get into Lord willing he the next
[22:29] scripture in Ammon says he had a friend
[22:31] amnon had a friend it was a bad friend
[22:33] it was a bad friend so he had the wrong
[22:36] friend if you have the wrong friend it's
[22:38] going to influence your life I don't
[22:40] know why we even call some people
[22:42] friends when they keep weakening us
[22:44] spiritually that's not your friends your
[22:46] friends are the ones that draw you
[22:48] closer to God so he had the wrong friend
[22:50] if you have the wrong friend it's going
[22:53] to influence your life I don't know why
[22:55] we even call some people friends when
[22:57] they keep weakening us spiritually
[22:59] that's not your friends your friends are
[23:01] the ones that draw you closer to God
[23:04] I got this online friend and oh we have
[23:07] a nice relationship and they're a
[23:08] complete unbeliever that's really not
[23:10] your friend it might be your enemy
[23:14] but admin had a friend and that's how he
[23:16] got there too
[23:17] so all the events leading up to it but
[23:19] there's several reasons that amnon got
[23:22] there but you see now but the one I want
[23:24] to talk about today is the King's sin
[23:27] because we might not say it's it's not
[23:30] say it's not related but the dad the
[23:32] king what David did
[23:35] what David did and you can disagree with
[23:37] him that's fine but I believe what David
[23:39] did set a tone in the family and in the
[23:44] Kingdom
[23:45] because nobody knew about this before
[23:47] and now God says I'm going to blast it
[23:49] all away with that our King that our
[23:50] King took a woman that wasn't his and
[23:53] had sexual relations with her and then
[23:55] killed the husband all of this word got
[23:57] out and so if you don't think that has
[23:59] an effect on people's minds
[24:01] our King Our God called King our man
[24:04] that's in leadership our leader
[24:08] you see we think it's the sin is bad and
[24:10] the sin is terrible it was terrible but
[24:12] what Satan does with the sin
[24:14] is sometimes worth because it's a lack
[24:17] of trust in the people again
[24:19] and not only that if it's not dealt with
[24:22] then we realize it sets a precedence
[24:24] kind of like with Esther and the king
[24:27] and the the king said go tell vashti to
[24:30] I want her to come and do something in
[24:32] the banquet invest I said no I refuse to
[24:35] come and so now the king says if we let
[24:38] that go and all the rulers said if we
[24:40] let that go then all the women of the
[24:42] land are going to say say no to their
[24:45] husbands when they ask them to do
[24:46] something
[24:47] it it has a trickle-down effect
[24:54] fathers husbands young men
[24:57] listen to me today
[24:59] sometimes your little decisions
[25:02] can have a trickle-down effect
[25:05] to children for many generations now
[25:09] listen I believe God has the power to
[25:12] break curses in families
[25:15] and I can preach another sermon on that
[25:17] and you'd probably be more excited about
[25:18] it than what I'm preaching today
[25:20] but God can break curses in families
[25:24] but I can still preach if that curse
[25:26] isn't broke then little decisions that
[25:29] David made and different ones make you
[25:31] think you can do it privately but it's
[25:33] going to have an effect
[25:35] it's gonna trickle down
[25:37] it will spill over and then you look at
[25:40] your sons and daughters sometimes say
[25:41] why are they that way well you don't
[25:44] just say well it's because they don't
[25:45] have the Holy Ghost it's all on them
[25:47] it's not always on all of them it's poor
[25:50] decisions that we make
[25:53] but trust me friends you don't have to
[25:54] say Amen with all this as long as you
[25:56] chew on it that's fine it's nice to get
[25:58] amens but I know these subjects are
[26:00] tedious to talk about I'm not wanting to
[26:02] bring you Brothers down or your sisters
[26:03] down but I want to speak openly and
[26:06] honestly that we Life Is Life and when
[26:09] you make decisions privately sometimes
[26:11] sexual Temptation decisions and you fall
[26:14] and you do things like that you think
[26:16] you're hiding it but it has a
[26:18] trickle-down effect in sexual things in
[26:20] the family to see it's no service if
[26:23] there's no repentance I'd like to see
[26:25] young people go home and take the trash
[26:28] off their phones I'd like to see fathers
[26:30] that are privately sinning repent to
[26:33] their wives and say hon I've got to
[26:35] confess something to you I'd like to see
[26:37] more confession I'll tell you if we have
[26:39] confession in bringing it on the table
[26:41] no matter what the outcome bring it on
[26:43] the table I'd love to see that it
[26:44] doesn't have to be in this service but I
[26:46] pray it would be because if we have that
[26:48] kind of confession we've got the devil
[26:50] on the run and victory is on the way but
[26:53] there's certain things I learned from
[26:54] the scripture is that there's trouble
[26:55] sometimes and you reap what you sow but
[26:58] that doesn't mean God didn't give me his
[27:00] grace
[27:02] and so we shouldn't say but I thought
[27:05] his grace
[27:06] would just fix all of these things and
[27:10] sometimes he does but sometimes he
[27:13] doesn't
[27:13] but it's not our interpretation of God's
[27:16] grace
[27:17] give me this Lord and give me that and
[27:19] seal it up over here and give me that
[27:20] give me correct this and it's all your
[27:23] problems you're wanting him to correct
[27:25] do this do this and sometimes God says
[27:27] here's here's my judgment
[27:29] I'm giving you Grace and I'm leaving
[27:31] things in your life that should have
[27:33] been taken from you but I'm giving you
[27:34] those things by my grace
[27:37] but there's some other things that are
[27:38] going to always be with you how many
[27:40] knows when you get a wound you get a
[27:42] scar and the scar is there for life
[27:45] if that works physically it works
[27:47] emotionally too
[27:48] but God gives us Grace to heal our
[27:50] wounds
[27:52] even though the scars are always there
[27:55] but I want to close this by saying that
[27:58] we shouldn't interpret to God what his
[28:01] grace should be we should be satisfied
[28:04] with the what Grace he gives us
