[0:00] would like to turn this evening into the
[0:01] book of saint john the 12th chapter
[0:05] and we'll start in the 23rd
[0:08] the 23rd verse here and we'll go now to
[0:11] verse 3. god bless each one of the
[0:13] different young people and
[0:14] i see some different familiar faces as
[0:16] well trusting that the lord would bless
[0:18] each one amen god is faithful
[0:22] god is faithful saint john the 12th
[0:24] chapter and verse 23
[0:26] as you've probably noticed already i'm
[0:28] no good at public speaking so i'm just
[0:30] going to try to get out of the way and
[0:30] preach now
[0:33] saint john 12 23 the bible says and
[0:35] jesus answered them saying the hour is
[0:37] come
[0:37] that the son of man should be glorified
[0:40] verily verily i say unto you except a
[0:44] corn of wheat
[0:44] fall into the ground and die it abideth
[0:47] alone but if it die
[0:49] it bringeth forth much fruit he that
[0:52] loveth his life
[0:54] shall lose it and he that hateth his
[0:56] life in this world
[0:58] shall keep it unto life eternal if any
[1:01] man
[1:01] serve me let him follow me and where i
[1:04] am
[1:05] there shall also my servant be if any
[1:08] man serve me
[1:09] him will my father honor
[1:13] verse 27 now is my soul troubled
[1:16] and what shall i say father save me from
[1:19] this hour
[1:20] but for this cause came i unto this hour
[1:25] father glorify thy name then
[1:29] came there a voice from heaven saying i
[1:32] have both glorified it
[1:34] and will glorify it again the people
[1:37] therefore that stood by and heard it
[1:39] said that it thundered others said an
[1:41] angel
[1:42] spake to him jesus answered said this
[1:45] voice
[1:46] came not because of me but for your
[1:50] sakes may the lord bless the reading of
[1:52] his word as you're seated
[1:54] i'd like to take a thought from my text
[1:56] this evening and i'd like to preach on
[1:58] the defining moment amen the defining
[2:01] moment
[2:02] and i think this scripture is a timely
[2:04] scripture
[2:05] for the hour that we live in god the
[2:07] father here speaking out of heaven
[2:09] he responds to the the uh the cry of
[2:12] jesus here
[2:14] uh you know father uh would i would i
[2:16] cry that he would save me from this hour
[2:18] he says but i came forth this our father
[2:20] glorify the name so god
[2:22] responds and he says i have both
[2:24] glorified my name
[2:26] and he said i'm gonna do it again and i
[2:27] believe it's relevant to us because i
[2:29] believe
[2:30] we are living in the hour when he has
[2:32] come and spoken by a voice to us
[2:35] the voice that we've heard in this day
[2:37] it's not just the voice of another man
[2:39] speaking
[2:39] but god has spoken unto us through a
[2:42] vindicated prophet in this generation
[2:45] and what has he declared he's declared
[2:46] the name of jesus christ
[2:48] that he would glorify his name once
[2:50] again amen
[2:51] i believe the name of god is glorified
[2:54] again today
[2:55] in the bride of jesus christ because the
[2:57] true
[2:58] nature of god has been revealed to us in
[3:01] his fullness amen there is a people
[3:03] on the face of the earth today i believe
[3:04] i'm looking at some of them tonight
[3:06] there's a people in the face of the
[3:08] earth today and they are
[3:09] the place that he has put his name they
[3:12] are
[3:12] his provided place of worship amen
[3:16] and just like in that day when god spoke
[3:18] some people said that
[3:19] they thought they heard the sound of
[3:20] thunder and they just preached the
[3:21] thunders of some sort of a carnal
[3:23] doctrine well
[3:24] we heard thunder somebody said well well
[3:25] the angels spoke we've had an angel
[3:28] speak to us in this day it's true but
[3:30] what we've heard is more
[3:31] than just the voice of a messenger amen
[3:34] we've got a vindicated thus
[3:36] saith the lord that has come and spoken
[3:38] to us from heaven amen
[3:40] i believe the words that we're feeding
[3:42] on tonight it's not the words of the man
[3:44] william branham
[3:46] it's more than just the angel that's
[3:47] spoken to us amen because the words of a
[3:50] man will
[3:51] fail us listen i was just saying a few
[3:54] moments ago i thank god
[3:55] for godly father's words as a man will
[3:58] fail my children my words as a man would
[4:01] fail you tonight but we're not
[4:02] feeding tonight on the words of a man we
[4:05] are feeding tonight on the unfailing
[4:08] body word of the son of man the same god
[4:10] that spoke back there in saint john 12
[4:13] he has spoken to us in this generation i
[4:16] believe he's come to speak to us tonight
[4:19] because he wants to glorify his name in
[4:21] you and i
[4:23] amen and i'll remind you what jesus told
[4:25] him he said
[4:26] the voice that we've heard in this day
[4:28] it did not come from mike listen god's
[4:30] not confused about who he is
[4:32] god knows exactly who he is god sent the
[4:35] voice
[4:36] for your sakes so many young people
[4:39] raised around this message
[4:40] they hear the quotes they hear the tapes
[4:43] they hear the preaching
[4:44] and sometimes it's presented to them in
[4:46] a way where they think god's up to get
[4:48] him
[4:50] brother brandon was a young man he
[4:51] thought god was up he said god hated me
[4:53] but jesus loved me
[4:54] didn't realize it was the same person
[4:56] sometimes we look at the message we
[4:58] think it's a bunch of rules
[4:59] and ideas and quotes but i want to
[5:02] testify to you tonight
[5:04] as a young man that got saved through
[5:06] this message
[5:07] this message comes from my sake it's
[5:10] here for you
[5:11] he's not against you he's for you
[5:14] tonight
[5:15] if you're sitting here tonight hearing
[5:17] the message of the hour
[5:19] believing what god has said it's because
[5:21] it's for you
[5:22] you've got every reason to rejoice if
[5:24] god is for you tonight
[5:26] who can be against you
[5:29] hallelujah he knows who he is
[5:33] he's not saying it for himself he knows
[5:34] who he is he wants you to recognize who
[5:36] he is
[5:37] because who he is is who we are
[5:40] that's where we can have a boldness and
[5:42] stand and preach
[5:44] because as he is so are we
[5:47] in this world not just the world to come
[5:51] not 50 years in the future not in the
[5:53] days some by and by somewhere
[5:56] right now as a christian the word that
[5:59] spoke of the bridegroom spirits of this
[6:01] bride
[6:03] well praise the lord that'll make you
[6:05] feel pretty good i feel pretty good
[6:06] about that
[6:07] i was talking to brother the other day i
[6:08] said you know what god has said so many
[6:10] things about my life
[6:11] i would have never dared to say about
[6:13] myself how many
[6:15] even in our own lives sometimes we look
[6:17] at it and we question we look in the
[6:18] mirror
[6:18] god has said so many good things about
[6:20] you you couldn't presume to say about
[6:22] yourself
[6:24] when you think about the magnitude of
[6:25] what god has spoken over your life
[6:28] it astounds me he's given us every
[6:30] reason to succeed
[6:32] in the midst of satan's eating despite
[6:34] darkness
[6:35] despite confusion despite wickedness
[6:40] and listen you young people brother
[6:41] branham talked about it when he was
[6:43] an older man in the 50s and the 60s he
[6:46] said my children got so much more to
[6:47] deal with
[6:48] today than i had to deal with if it was
[6:51] that way 60 years ago
[6:53] what about today you see what are you
[6:56] getting at brother listen
[6:57] jesus had to make a decision amen he
[7:00] come to an hour and he said
[7:02] my desire i could look at it and say why
[7:05] am i in this hour
[7:06] you might look at it and say why am i in
[7:08] the midst of the darkest most perverse
[7:10] age there's ever been
[7:12] jesus looked at his own hour and listen
[7:14] maybe you're the same way tonight maybe
[7:15] you feel the same way
[7:16] you look at the day you live in you look
[7:19] at the hour that we're in
[7:20] and it troubles your soul it troubled
[7:22] jesus
[7:23] see the devil come along sometime to use
[7:25] a young person to say
[7:26] you know if you really believe this if
[7:28] you really believe the word you won't
[7:30] let all this stuff
[7:31] bother you but i want you to understand
[7:33] and even bother
[7:34] jesus jesus was troubled by the
[7:38] hour that he lived in sin what he saw
[7:41] witnessing the things that he saw don't
[7:43] let the devil discourage you about that
[7:45] because listen
[7:46] jesus was troubled about it but what did
[7:48] he say
[7:50] amen what'd he say should i should i ask
[7:53] for a deliverance
[7:55] from this hour but listen he said this
[7:57] is the hour i come there
[7:59] this hour that you're so troubled about
[8:01] this day and age which seems so
[8:03] filled with darkness and discouragement
[8:06] god
[8:07] put you here in this hour and he didn't
[8:10] just put you here because he had nowhere
[8:11] else to put you
[8:13] he didn't put you here because he ran
[8:15] out of somebody to come and work for him
[8:17] or do something
[8:18] and said well i guess i this is all i
[8:20] got left i got the reserve
[8:21] now he saved the best for last
[8:24] he said i'm going to put them in the
[8:26] midst of the darkest hour there's ever
[8:28] been
[8:29] on the face of the earth in the midst of
[8:31] satan's
[8:32] eden and they will not only just
[8:34] overcome they will thrive
[8:36] they will overcome every adversary they
[8:39] will choose my way which is the harder
[8:41] way
[8:42] not because of but despite satan's
[8:45] heathen
[8:46] they will choose to follow me they will
[8:48] overcome
[8:49] by the blood of the lamb and by the word
[8:52] of their testimony
[8:54] your young people don't be content
[8:56] tonight to rest on just brother
[8:58] branham's testimony or
[9:00] daddy's testimony or the pastor's
[9:02] testimony god wants you to have a
[9:04] testimony
[9:05] they stood the test of time they fought
[9:08] the good fight
[9:09] they pressed the battle when everybody
[9:11] else walked away
[9:12] when the orange sounded retreat they
[9:15] threw themselves into the battle
[9:19] who threw themselves about 13 year olds
[9:22] 14 year olds
[9:24] little davids and grown men when grown
[9:27] men don't want to fight
[9:29] when grown men don't want to stand for
[9:31] god anymore god's got some teenagers
[9:36] got some young people say i believe god
[9:40] david had a testimony i know what god
[9:42] can do
[9:43] i've watched him fight
[9:45] [Music]
[9:48] hallelujah jesus had to make a decision
[9:51] amen here's what i'm getting to with
[9:53] this amen i want you to think about this
[9:55] look think we we we rehearse the
[9:58] different miracles in jesus ministry we
[10:00] look at all the different testimonies
[10:02] and the things that he done we look at
[10:03] the healings and the prophecy and the
[10:05] miracles
[10:06] but i want you to understand jesus came
[10:08] to a place
[10:09] a defining moment amen where he had to
[10:12] surrender his will to the father
[10:14] every healing every miracle every
[10:17] prophecy
[10:18] it would have meant nothing if he didn't
[10:21] go to calvary
[10:23] amen we thank god for the healings we
[10:25] thank god for the miracles
[10:27] we we we embrace and expect those things
[10:31] because they're precious to us but
[10:32] unless this lamb of god went
[10:35] and he died at calvary it would have
[10:37] meant nothing
[10:39] those things testified of who he was he
[10:41] was defined
[10:43] when he embraced he took the stinger of
[10:45] death into him
[10:46] and rose again on the third day that
[10:49] showed once and for all
[10:50] this is that messiah that had been
[10:52] prophesied
[10:54] amen no death where is i sting
[10:57] a grave where is thy victory we've got
[11:00] one
[11:01] he rose from the dead on the third day
[11:04] death has lost its sting satan's lost
[11:07] his power
[11:08] he's defeated tonight
[11:11] we've got one he didn't just raise from
[11:13] the grave
[11:14] the grave but he ascended far above
[11:18] everything that's trying to beset you
[11:19] tonight every principality
[11:22] every power every every mind battle
[11:25] every temptation
[11:27] every addiction every little thing that
[11:29] the devil wants to send your way
[11:30] every time you walk through walmart
[11:33] every time you go to school
[11:34] every little stumbling block satan puts
[11:37] in your way
[11:38] he's got more stumbling blocks he's got
[11:40] more temptations than ever
[11:42] but god is not defeated he defeated it 2
[11:46] 000 years ago we've got one that's
[11:50] clear past the moon tonight amen we're
[11:52] not just trying to get out of our event
[11:54] we've done plum on into the unfailing
[11:56] realities of god tonight amen
[12:00] now think about this jesus this whole
[12:03] time he's been preaching to his
[12:04] disciples he said i'm the bread of life
[12:06] amen i am the true bread which has come
[12:09] down to the heaven
[12:10] but now he's speaking and saying except
[12:12] the corn of wheat
[12:14] and except the corn or wheat would die
[12:15] and go to the ground it would abide
[12:17] alone in other words he's preached about
[12:18] the bread
[12:19] but now he's preaching about the seed
[12:20] life because the seed life that was
[12:23] going to go on the ground
[12:24] was going to determine who you and i
[12:25] were amen the bible says in isaiah 55
[12:29] that his word is bred to the eater but
[12:31] it's seed to the sower
[12:33] you say what are you getting at brother
[12:34] listen this is what i'm getting at god
[12:36] was going to sow a seed that day at
[12:37] calvary
[12:38] amen he took a seed of a son of god and
[12:41] he sowed that seed
[12:43] in confidence because he knew listen
[12:46] jesus had confidence
[12:48] in the word about him
[12:51] what brother ma'am say it was one
[12:52] prophecy by a man that was
[12:55] backslid when i get it you destroy this
[12:59] temple
[13:00] i will raise it up again
[13:03] if he had that much confidence about
[13:05] what the word said about him
[13:07] listen god knew when he put that seed in
[13:09] the ground amen look at farmer he don't
[13:11] i'm not a farmer now i don't have a
[13:14] green thumb or whatever
[13:15] i didn't get that from adam i guess hey
[13:17] man
[13:18] listen but i know one thing a farmer
[13:20] don't go out there and put a hundred
[13:21] thousand seeds or whatever in the field
[13:23] because he thinks they're not going to
[13:24] come back up he has an expectation
[13:27] that seed is going to come back up and
[13:29] when god put that sun on calvary
[13:31] and he was planted in the ground planted
[13:34] a borrowed tomb
[13:35] he had confidence that that seed would
[13:37] come up on the third day
[13:39] you say what are you getting abroad
[13:40] listen every seed must bring forth
[13:42] after its own kind
[13:46] listen god did not put a seed of a son
[13:48] of god in the ground with power
[13:50] and authority and righteousness and
[13:53] sinlessness and virtue
[13:54] he put that in the ground just to get a
[13:56] bunch of church members back
[13:58] listen god paid a great price he put a
[14:01] seat in the ground
[14:02] not to get a bunch of formal
[14:03] denominational people back
[14:05] that believe half the word amen he
[14:07] didn't put some hybrid in the ground
[14:10] he didn't put us on the ground just to
[14:11] get a bunch of cirrets under the butt of
[14:14] bulls and girls help me out somebody
[14:16] he put a son of god in the ground
[14:18] because he wanted sons of god
[14:20] and the same power the same likeness
[14:23] the same life the same ability
[14:28] he did not ordain anything less for you
[14:31] than the full manifestation of the son
[14:33] of god
[14:36] hallelujah that's why we're gonna have
[14:39] boldness
[14:40] as he is amen why it's the same seed yes
[14:43] it's the same life
[14:44] the prophet says many times you hear
[14:46] this on tape he says we live a million
[14:48] miles below our privileges
[14:50] amen i want to ask you not how far are
[14:52] you living below yours
[14:53] hey man half a half a million miles
[14:55] quarter somewhere we live below our
[14:57] privileges
[14:58] amen and why do we do it we do it
[15:00] because we choose to
[15:02] whether we realize it or not
[15:05] amen i was studying this on the way here
[15:09] and
[15:09] it's great because we come on samaria
[15:11] wrote i'm like yes it's a sign it was
[15:12] literally a science of samaria
[15:15] but i always loved this story because
[15:17] the bible tells us about a man
[15:19] by the name of jehu in the bible and the
[15:21] prophet elijah he'd given a prophecy
[15:23] about jezebel that she was going to be
[15:25] thrown down and the dogs would eat her
[15:27] up
[15:28] and she wouldn't even be buried and one
[15:30] day the prophet elijah come to a man
[15:32] a man by the name of jehu this man
[15:34] wasn't a royalty he wasn't a
[15:36] whatever just a guy but an anointed
[15:39] servant of god
[15:41] because of the prophecy of elijah came
[15:43] to him
[15:44] and he anointed him to be king amen and
[15:47] he anointed him to be king
[15:48] for a purpose listen god has called you
[15:52] to this life this kingdom for a purpose
[15:56] he said i'm going to call you for a
[15:58] purpose god has anointed you
[16:00] to destroy desert jezebel to fulfill the
[16:03] prophecy of the prophet elijah
[16:06] i'll tell you what i i just always love
[16:08] the story of jehu amen i tell you what
[16:10] they they take him and say he's going to
[16:12] be king and he hops in his chariot i
[16:14] don't know what he was driving that day
[16:15] amen maybe a mustang or something hey
[16:17] man
[16:17] and he hops in his chair and he gets his
[16:20] guys together
[16:21] and they're riding amen praise the lord
[16:23] somebody they start running down there
[16:25] towards jezebel where she's at and
[16:26] you've got joram the
[16:28] the king of uh of king of israel or no

[16:43] coming this way so they said we need to
[16:46] find out what this is about
[16:47] is he coming for peace is he coming for
[16:49] war so he goes and grabs a message and

[16:54] i want you to go over here
[16:56] and i want you to go and see are they
[16:58] coming for peace or war
[16:59] and so he runs over there and jay who's
[17:02] waiting on him

[19:24] christians amen
[19:26] to destroy the works of that spirit of
[19:28] jezebel
[19:29] in the world today that's why a prophet

[19:34] preached against it because there was
[19:36] going to be a bribe
[19:38] come on the earth she's ordained to
[19:41] overcome every antichrist system
[19:43] every distraction every difficulty every
[19:46] trial

[20:13] inheritance they wanted his what god
[20:15] gave him
[20:16] they wanted to take it from him and they
[20:18] murdered that man to take
[20:20] it but jay who says we've not forgotten

[20:41] it's like to be under the hand
[20:43] of a taskmaster like the devil but i

[20:46] to be set free by the power of jesus
[20:50] christ
[20:50] i can walk in newness of life tonight
[20:53] because he's made away from me
[20:55] i've got no desire to go back under the
[20:57] bondage of israel

[21:00] jezebel's tribute tonight
[21:02] listen i'm not content tonight to get
[21:04] one victory
[21:06] how many ass i mean jehu was not content

[21:32] the earth today anointed through the
[21:33] prophet elijah's ministry
[21:35] anointed to be called for this hour

[21:41] the devil
[21:41] once and for all that there's nothing he
[21:43] can do
[21:45] there's nothing satan can do to stop the

[22:20] building tonight you could speak a world
[22:22] in existence if god wanted to do it
[22:26] hey man tell you what

[22:41] he ain't nothing before jehu
[22:44] he is just an enemy ordained to be
[22:47] defeated amen listen i tell you what
[22:50] they saw jehu come and said
[22:51] he drives his chariot furiously it must
[22:54] be jehu
[22:55] i told you you've got a reputation when
[22:57] people know who you are
[22:58] when you're driving down the road they
[23:00] can't even see the call of your car
[23:02] they don't know who's coming say well he
[23:03] drives like a maniac i must be jehu
[23:06] i've driven like that before you young
[23:07] people don't do that by the way
[23:09] amen listen he had a reputation his
[23:12] reputation was so strong
[23:13] they didn't want nothing to do with him
[23:15] amen
[23:17] praise the lord we remember what he's
[23:20] done
[23:20] that's why we're here tonight listen i
[23:22] was just talking to some
[23:24] the young people about this earlier
[23:25] today at our church you you look at the
[23:27] men of god throughout history
[23:28] you look at women watching their little
[23:31] kids tortured
[23:32] you read a fox's book of martyrs you
[23:34] look through the bible you look through
[23:36] history
[23:37] listen men and women they suffered and
[23:39] they bled
[23:40] and they died so we could be here
[23:42] tonight and preach this bible
[23:44] and believe this message uncompromising
[23:47] unflinching we're not backing up we're
[23:50] not walking away
[23:51] these men spilled their blood to seal
[23:54] their testimony
[23:56] and one day i've planned to meet every
[23:58] one of them and shake their hand and say
[24:00] i fought my good fight too
[24:03] i didn't back down because it was
[24:04] inconvenient i didn't walk away because
[24:07] it was hard to serve god
[24:09] i doubled down and i put my shoulder to
[24:11] the wheel and i hopped on my chair
[24:13] and i rode out i remember what the
[24:16] antichrist system
[24:17] didn't do those people i know what that
[24:20] power has done
[24:21] throughout the ages of god's people
[24:23] trying to steal your inheritance
[24:26] listen why does the devil fight your
[24:27] inheritance so much because it belongs
[24:30] to you
[24:32] it does not belong to him it will never
[24:35] belong to him
[24:36] and he knows it he knows it that's why
[24:39] he fights it so much amen
[24:41] but we have not forgotten the price that
[24:43] was paid
[24:45] we're here tonight because people pay
[24:46] the price
[24:50] even this prophet you think of all the
[24:51] friends he lost you think of all the
[24:52] things that was done to him
[24:54] the things that were spoken about him

[24:57] lost a daughter lost a wife
[25:01] this man paid a price to bring this
[25:04] message to
[25:04] us and god forbid that i should sit at
[25:07] home
[25:08] and fold my hands and let let some
[25:10] jezebel spirit
[25:12] run over my family and run over my
[25:14] testimony
[25:15] and run over my church and run over my

[37:50] moment that defined the fate of kingdoms

[38:23] brother brown tells a story this is in
[38:25] the sermon
[38:27] come let us reason together in 1955.
[38:30] he gives his testimony he said there's a
[38:32] man in the meeting he was sitting there
[38:33] and he had hardening his arteries and he
[38:36] says
[38:37] he wants god to make him well and he
[38:39] asked me you think god would heal you
[38:40] sir do you think that would do that
[38:42] and he said the man got healed there he
[38:43] said i want to ask you something he said
[38:45] i was talking to this woman right next
[38:47] to you think about this sit right next
[38:48] to each other in church
[38:50] there's a woman sitting right next to my
[38:51] church and here's this man he said when
[38:53] i asked you something i was talking to
[38:54] that woman
[38:55] and when i was talking to you you felt
[38:57] something move over from her to you he
[38:58] said
[39:00] he said just then the sovereign grace
[39:01] that went over to you a real strange
[39:03] feeling swept over you didn't it
[39:05] and you wondered why that woman didn't
[39:06] raise up didn't you see
[39:08] she missed it because the angel was
[39:11] leaving her
[39:12] and going to you isn't that right he
[39:16] says if it is wave your hand real funny
[39:17] feeling
[39:18] that's right he says it ended with you
[39:20] brother
[39:21] your faith got the vision
[39:26] now i we don't like to think about these
[39:28] but these things but
[39:29] i that's just how i am i begin to think
[39:31] about it can you imagine being that
[39:32] woman
[39:33] sitting that meeting and you you you
[39:35] drove all the way to church you fought
[39:37] your way through sickness
[39:38] fought your way through all these things
[39:40] and you dealt with all these problems
[39:41] and you come to church but because your
[39:44] faith's not in the right place
[39:46] you listen the angel was there the power
[39:49] of god was present to heal
[39:50] the prophet was right there say i wish
[39:53] brother brown was here tonight
[39:54] listen the angel of the lord is here but
[39:57] can your faith catch the vision
[40:00] that woman missed it and a few feet away
[40:03] some other man got it
[40:07] don't miss what god's doing amen
[40:12] you get older i do anyway i guess you
[40:15] are too
[40:17] i'm not old man as some would say but
[40:19] i'm older than many of you but
[40:20] let me say this people that get older
[40:23] they tend to look back on things and
[40:25] put the rose tinted glasses on and we
[40:27] remember things that the way we want
[40:30] we we we begin to think about things we
[40:33] wish we did differently
[40:34] and you know we are warned from an early
[40:36] age to avoid certain pitfalls and
[40:38] different troubles in life and that's
[40:39] good that's fine
[40:41] but what i find the most with people
[40:42] when they get older amen
[40:45] your mileage may vary hey man it's not
[40:48] usually our regrets aren't usually what
[40:50] we did do or didn't do wrong or whatever
[40:52] it's usually the things that we left
[40:54] undone
[40:57] we we wanted to pursue a certain career
[40:59] we want to do this and we do that but we
[41:01] let fear we let things get in the way
[41:03] with the cares of life distract
[41:06] us before you know it you're you're
[41:08] older and you look back said i wish i
[41:10] had done this with my life
[41:11] i wish i wouldn't miss we miss so many
[41:14] opportunities
[41:16] and the very things we miss sometimes
[41:18] that's the defining moment in our life
[41:21] if i just went this way if i'd done one
[41:23] thing different
[41:25] amen listen and maybe tonight we've got
[41:28] many young people here
[41:29] maybe you're concerned tonight you don't
[41:31] want to miss out on certain friends or
[41:33] certain things in your youth or
[41:34] maybe there's this special someone in
[41:36] your life and you're interested in them
[41:37] we don't want to miss those things or
[41:38] or maybe it's school a career whatever
[41:40] it is friends let me say this whatever
[41:42] you do don't miss on out on the kingdom
[41:44] of god
[41:46] it's so easy to get caught up in leo to
[41:49] see it
[41:49] it's so easy to look around and be
[41:51] troubled by this hour
[41:53] it's so easy to be distracted and caught
[41:55] up with the cares of this world
[41:56] and you can sit in church and the holy
[41:58] ghost can come
[41:59] and ruin the service and bless one
[42:02] person and you can sit there and scratch
[42:03] your head and say
[42:04] what's going on i don't understand
[42:06] you're missing what god's doing
[42:08] friends whatever you do you might you
[42:09] might miss work you might miss
[42:11] whatever it is don't miss this kingdom
[42:15] don't miss this thing this rapture this
[42:17] event it's more than an event it's going
[42:19] on right now
[42:21] god's doing something tonight right now
[42:23] he's quickening us from death into life
[42:25] he's even bringing these mortal bodies
[42:28] subject to the word
[42:32] and i think can you imagine sitting in
[42:33] william branham's meeting
[42:35] and missing that well you know she might
[42:38] have missed her young but think of all
[42:39] the thousands of people that missed what

[42:45] branstad they missed
[42:47] the awake don't miss it now they miss
[42:49] the awakening of the bride

[42:53] it my faith caught the vision
[42:57] god allowed me by his sovereign grace to
[42:59] recognize
[43:00] the move is on for the bride
[43:03] we're in our chariot we're going down
[43:05] the road we're not going back
[43:07] this way we're not walking back to the
[43:09] powers of darkness

[43:12] road

[43:16] victories under our belt tonight

[43:23] world it's on for you and i
[43:28] listen i i made this statement years ago
[43:29] and i want to make the same statements

[43:33] churches i hear this idea you know we
[43:35] need to take care of the youth and have
[43:36] youth meetings they're the church of
[43:38] tomorrow the youth of the church
[43:39] tomorrow

[44:10] moment that defined the rest of his life
[44:14] he thought he was just going down to
[44:15] give his brother some food and he hears
[44:17] this big old goliath boston
[44:19] and his brothers are even going on all
[44:21] of david you're just getting all worked

[48:25] god's not trying to keep nothing from
[48:27] you
[48:28] listen he revealed it to this day that's
[48:30] why he gave him the message
[48:31] he revealed everything god's not holding
[48:33] nothing back from you
[48:35] we let things get in the way we let
[48:38] things distract
[48:39] us
[48:43] and they're not always even things that
[48:44] are what we would say inherently sinful

[49:07] your life if you give it preeminence

[1:02:12] next day i went home that night i was
[1:02:14] driving back home on the highway
[1:02:15] and satan satan come and spoke to me in
[1:02:17] that vehicle and i tell you what it's
[1:02:19] like i was saying earlier i don't know

[1:02:41] those things nowadays you don't really
[1:02:43] believe that people were healed you're
[1:02:45] just saying all that you're just getting
[1:02:46] people worked up you don't believe that
[1:02:48] at all

[1:02:52] that i said what i said was this i said
[1:02:54] even if that's true satan
[1:02:55] i know one person that was there that
[1:02:57] night that believed it
[1:02:58] you do
[1:03:03] i said satan if there's one person that
[1:03:05] believes that this is still the same
[1:03:07] thing today
[1:03:08] it's you that's why you fight it that's
[1:03:11] why you're against it
[1:03:12] that's why you're here talking to me now
[1:03:14] you fight it because you know
[1:03:16] what it's done to you night after night
[1:03:18] after night
[1:03:19] in the prophet's meetings you saw what
[1:03:21] the power of god did to you
[1:03:23] you believe it even if i don't that's
[1:03:26] why you're afraid that's why he's afraid
[1:03:27] right now
[1:03:29] oh i can feel him shaking right now he's
[1:03:30] afraid some young person
[1:03:32] is going to believe it the way he does

[1:03:46] amen we bow our heads
[1:03:50] heavenly father i thank you for these
[1:03:53] precious

[1:04:32] lord they don't have to be distracted
