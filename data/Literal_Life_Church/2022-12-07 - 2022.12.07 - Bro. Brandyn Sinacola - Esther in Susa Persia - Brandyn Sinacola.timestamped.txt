[0:00] just something in my study of Esther
[0:03] that I've
[0:05] really caught my attention and I felt
[0:07] like is is
[0:09] important to set the scene for where I
[0:13] want to go with Esther So Daniel chapter
[0:17] 10
[0:18] and I just pray the Lord will help us
[0:20] tie in everything and if you're in the
[0:24] back I don't know if you guys I'll let
[0:25] you decide if you want to put the
[0:27] scripture up or if you want to put my
[0:28] first slide it's up to you
[0:31] Daniel chapter 10 and verse 10.
[0:37] are you happy to be in the house of the
[0:39] Lord tonight
[0:40] amen
[0:42] so be maybe a little bit more of a
[0:44] teaching but I'll try not to bore you
[0:46] too much and we'll just keep clipping
[0:47] along and and believe that the Lord will
[0:50] will feed you tonight
[0:52] Daniel 10 10. and this is starting as as
[0:57] I believe Daniel's in a vision and
[1:00] behold a hand touched me which set me
[1:02] upon my knees and upon the palms of my
[1:04] hands and he said unto me o Daniel a man
[1:08] greatly beloved understand the words
[1:10] that I speak unto thee and stand upright
[1:12] For unto thee and my now sin and when he
[1:15] had spoken this word unto me I stood
[1:17] trembling
[1:19] then said he unto me fear not Daniel
[1:22] for from the first day that thou did a
[1:24] set thine heart to understand and to
[1:26] chasten thyself before thy God thy words
[1:29] were heard and I am come for thy words
[1:32] so if you remember I think this is 21
[1:34] days and I thought it was 21 days and
[1:38] another spot when I read it I thought
[1:39] maybe it was 24 doesn't matter it was
[1:41] longer than a day
[1:43] and we're not used to that as Americans
[1:45] are we
[1:47] and I am come for thy words
[1:51] but the prince of the kingdom of Persia
[1:53] withstood me one in 21 in 20 days 21
[1:56] days there it is but Lo Michael one of
[1:59] the chief princes came to help me and I
[2:02] remain there with the kings of Persia
[2:04] now I want you to catch that now
[2:06] so first in verse 13 at the beginning we
[2:09] have but the prince of the kingdom of
[2:11] Persia withstood me one in 20 days
[2:14] and then he says
[2:16] uh Michael one of the chief princes came
[2:19] to help me and I remained there with the
[2:21] kings of Persia now this isn't referring
[2:24] I don't believe to physical Kings and a
[2:28] physical Prince this is a spiritual
[2:30] warfare in response to Daniel's prayer
[2:33] these these the Prince of Persia and the
[2:36] kings of Persia were withstanding the
[2:39] angels from getting to to Daniel to meet
[2:42] his need to to minister to him
[2:45] and verse 14 says now I am come to make
[2:49] thee understand what shall befall thy
[2:52] people in the latter days for yet the
[2:54] vision is for many days
[2:56] so as we start in Esther the very first
[3:00] thing you read is is the setting of The
[3:02] Story of where it's taking place and uh
[3:05] for them in the back I'm just going to
[3:07] title this tonight Esther and Sousa
[3:09] Persia
[3:10] Esther and Susa Persia
[3:13] and
[3:14] it starts describing the kingdom just a
[3:17] little bit vaguely I think there was
[3:19] some 127 different promises and uh
[3:22] provinces sorry
[3:24] and it's just this vast Kingdom and in
[3:27] the Persian Empire in it and as you as
[3:30] you read Esther 1 and it's describing
[3:32] the kingdom that she's going getting
[3:33] ready to it describes the King Xerxes
[3:37] um and and vashti and then what Esther's
[3:40] going to be queen of it describes this
[3:43] very uh illustrious and and ginormous
[3:47] Kingdom and this ginormous Palace Sousa
[3:51] is also called shushan The Palace in the
[3:54] story of Esther
[3:55] um
[3:56] so it's it's all described here and it's
[4:00] and it's in during the the the reign of
[4:03] the Persian and media uh Empire
[4:06] uh media Empire
[4:08] and um
[4:10] it's just interesting to me that before
[4:14] before
[4:15] I think Esther is actually set before
[4:18] the Book of Daniel I think if I'm I'm
[4:20] remembering right in the butt in your
[4:21] Bible but yet Daniel is give is before
[4:24] Esther
[4:25] and he's giving a vision of of the
[4:29] kingdoms that are to come and one of
[4:31] those kingdoms is the Persian median
[4:33] Empire so it's what Esther's going to go
[4:36] into and yet what I what I think is what
[4:39] is just I guess what's striking me so
[4:41] much about this is God giving Daniel a
[4:45] vision of of what's going to come before
[4:48] it happens and I know that's the way God
[4:50] works with prophets but it's just so
[4:52] astounding down to the detail to where I
[4:55] think it was Isaiah who saw also saw
[4:59] this uh unfold
[5:01] and he even names the king who's going
[5:04] to come and take it from Babylon from
[5:06] Nebuchadnezzar Isaiah sees the king and
[5:09] and names him in Prophecy and it
[5:12] happened just exactly so and when you
[5:14] start researching this so this is this
[5:17] is the Mead and Persian Empire
[5:20] um it's it gets a little confusing with
[5:22] you know the Mead and the Persian how
[5:24] they they join that's everyone
[5:26] conquering everybody and they all want a
[5:28] piece of the pie and it ends up being
[5:30] the Pete the medes and Persian Empire so
[5:33] that's about my extent of my knowledge
[5:35] of it through all the studying that I've
[5:37] done but uh actually Brother Kyle told
[5:39] me that what you see right here in this
[5:42] outline kind of the the little bit
[5:44] orange or outline is actually just
[5:46] slightly less than the size of the
[5:48] United States so
[5:50] um so we see how vast and how big this
[5:53] was and then
[5:54] I I don't know if I have the scriptures
[5:56] in here but just describing this further
[5:58] it was
[6:00] uh yeah it's next so Daniel chapter 8
[6:03] and verse 2.
[6:06] let me see what my next slide is here
[6:10] okay let's hold on to that
[6:12] Daniel chapter eight and if you want to
[6:14] keep your Bibles handy I'm going to be
[6:16] referring to a lot of scriptures tonight
[6:19] Daniel chapter 8 and verse 2. and says
[6:22] and I saw in a vision
[6:26] and it came to pass when I saw that I
[6:28] was in shushan in the palace which is in
[6:31] the province of Elam and I saw in a
[6:34] vision and I was by the river uh ulai
[6:37] and and again I maybe I'm just a nerd
[6:40] but this is fascinating he he sees this
[6:43] Vision in shushan the palace this is
[6:45] where Esther's going to be and this is
[6:48] I want to say it's about 200 years it's
[6:54] little little between 100 100 and like
[6:57] 130 years probably 140 years before that
[7:01] Daniel's seeing this
[7:03] then I lifted up my eyes verse 3 and
[7:06] Saul and behold there stood before me
[7:08] the river
[7:09] uh before the river a ram which had two
[7:12] horns and the two horns were high but
[7:15] one was higher than the other and the
[7:17] higher came up last
[7:20] I saw the ram pushing Westward and
[7:22] northward and Southward so that no Beast
[7:25] might stand before him neither was there
[7:28] any that could deliver out of his hand
[7:30] but he did according to his will and
[7:33] became great
[7:34] so what these two horns represent here
[7:36] is actually like I told you it's I
[7:38] believe it started as the medes they
[7:41] started destroying people and taking
[7:43] land and then the Persians came and said
[7:46] hey we own you now and so you have a
[7:49] little horn the Meads and then you have
[7:51] a greater horn rise up the Persians and
[7:54] it becomes the meat and Persian Empire
[7:56] so that's why there's the two horns but
[7:58] the Persian is the greater it's it just
[8:01] becomes this huge vast Kingdom
[8:04] are you following me so far okay this
[8:08] might might make sense today but if you
[8:10] come back on January 1st then it'll
[8:12] maybe I'll make more sense
[8:15] so this is a little bit of background of
[8:17] the Persian Empire and if you want to go
[8:19] ahead and stick
[8:20] um
[8:22] let's go ahead and stick those other
[8:23] slides back up though
[8:25] modern uh Persia is actually Modern Day
[8:28] Iran uh or what I guess came to be
[8:32] it was a Global Hub of culture religion
[8:39] the Global Hub of culture religion
[8:42] science art and technology for more than
[8:45] 200 years
[8:47] so the Mead's Persian Empire went about
[8:49] 200 years I believe it was if I'm you
[8:51] know everything I'm understanding and it
[8:54] became a hub and and again I want to tie
[8:57] I want to tie Esther with our day
[9:01] and as I do that as I'm reading this I'm
[9:03] seeing that this describes the United
[9:06] States
[9:07] so if you watch what Esther's going
[9:10] through this is the same thing to me as
[9:13] what is is the culture that's
[9:14] surrounding us it's it's the the nation
[9:17] that we live in
[9:18] Persia actually became the world's first
[9:20] superpower this median Persian Empire
[9:23] there wasn't a superpower they didn't
[9:25] really use that term until the Persian
[9:28] Empire
[9:30] it was the largest Empire of its time uh
[9:33] I
[9:34] largest Empire of its time I'll just
[9:36] leave it at that
[9:38] unified through introducing a standard
[9:40] currency
[9:41] they did weights and measures
[9:44] they made an official language and they
[9:47] they built a lot of big and vast roads
[9:50] it was the first people to establish uh
[9:53] regular routes of communication between
[9:55] three continents Africa Asia and Europe
[9:58] and they built many New Roads and
[10:00] developed the world's first postal
[10:02] system
[10:03] so you see how this this nation this
[10:06] Kingdom this culture is just it's just
[10:08] advancing they each King that came up in
[10:12] the Persian Empire each one made it that
[10:15] much bigger that much wealthier and and
[10:17] that much stronger
[10:20] ah
[10:21] the main religion was
[10:23] um
[10:24] it sounds like Zorro
[10:26] Zorro is as strainism one of the world's
[10:30] oldest monotheistic religions the Kings
[10:33] ruled by the uh zoroastrian law of Asha
[10:38] which means truth and righteousness he
[10:42] um and it wasn't imposed necessarily
[10:44] upon the people
[10:46] um
[10:47] they let the people keep their own
[10:50] religions
[10:51] okay so you have this one uh vast great
[10:55] superpower and they kind of have their
[10:58] own religion but everybody can have
[11:01] their own religion so you start just
[11:03] building uh you know however many
[11:07] hundreds of thousands of religions we
[11:10] have today probably let alone just in
[11:12] the United States and you see the
[11:14] Persian Empire had had the same thing it
[11:17] was just this this thing that they were
[11:19] building this this power this Beast as
[11:22] we find in Daniel
[11:24] uh
[11:26] Hebrew scripture Praises Cyrus the Great
[11:28] for freeing the Jewish people of Babylon
[11:30] from captivity and allowing them to
[11:32] return to Jerusalem again he's got his
[11:35] own religion but it was just for some
[11:37] reason the people they conquered they
[11:39] let them
[11:40] have their own ways
[11:43] one of the great beliefs of this
[11:46] religion is is fire along with water are
[11:49] seen as symbols of purity
[11:51] uh this religion uh places of worship
[11:54] are called sometimes called fire temples
[11:58] each Fire temple contains an altar with
[12:00] an eternal flame that birds continuously
[12:02] and is never extinguished now I don't
[12:05] want to offend anybody but if you go and
[12:07] you find the Catholics and the and I
[12:08] believe it's Catholic I know it's
[12:10] Lutheran they have a flame burning up at
[12:13] the behind the Altar and that flame is
[12:16] is like an eternal flame as long as that
[12:18] Flame's burning they believe that the
[12:20] holy spirit's there
[12:22] according to Legend three ancient uh
[12:25] fire temples known as the great fires
[12:27] were said to have come directly from the
[12:30] zoroastrian god
[12:32] ahura Mazda which is actually what the
[12:36] Japanese named the Mazda car after which
[12:38] is interesting
[12:39] at the beginning of time archaeologists
[12:42] have searched for these places it's
[12:44] unclear whether they ever existed but
[12:46] it's or whether it's purely uh
[12:49] mythical
[12:50] so it's just interesting because it
[12:53] starts to blend a little bit into to me
[12:56] take it for what it's worth almost into
[12:58] a Catholicism
[13:00] okay because now we have we've got three
[13:03] temples now it's monotheistic but yet
[13:07] they start introducing other gods the
[13:10] the
[13:11] uh the gentleman who founded it is is
[13:15] his name it's named after him
[13:18] um they kind of look to him as a God but
[13:20] yet and then they have Idols this Idol
[13:23] of this man with a son it just gets
[13:26] crazy but supposedly it's monotheistic
[13:30] so bear with me a little bit longer
[13:34] uh so they gave they gave their dead Sky
[13:37] burials they built a circular flat top
[13:40] Towers called uh
[13:43] I can't pronounce that or towers of
[13:45] Silence their corpses were exposed to
[13:48] the elements and local vultures until
[13:50] the bones were picked clean and bleached
[13:52] and then they placed them and and
[13:54] collected lime pits
[13:57] uh so
[13:59] this is all this Persian vast Persian
[14:02] median Empire
[14:04] and this is what Esther is thrust into
[14:07] in the story of Esther
[14:09] this is what she she enters into now
[14:12] Israel has been under bondage from
[14:15] Daniel remember Daniel's taking the
[14:17] three Hebrew children they're under
[14:19] um Babylon Rule and then the medes in
[14:22] Persian take them so if we go to this
[14:25] slide here you'll recognize this and
[14:28] this is put in I think two or three of
[14:30] the visions of Daniel together but the
[14:33] first vision is Nebuchadnezzar sees this
[14:35] remember Daniel interprets it as the the
[14:38] statue of gold and
[14:41] each of these Empires I want to get into
[14:44] the because Daniel says that the Prince
[14:47] of Persia
[14:49] and and so to me this is the spiritual
[14:51] realm this is spiritual fighting going
[14:53] on so there's Spirits upon that nation
[14:56] and their Spirits upon every nation and
[14:59] every Kingdom
[15:01] and so
[15:02] each of these
[15:04] and I'm quoting now without uh giving
[15:07] you the direct quote but each of these
[15:09] kingdoms Babylon meets Persia Greece and
[15:12] Rome each of them exhibit the nature of
[15:15] the metal that they're made out of
[15:17] okay and so gold is the softest metal
[15:21] and as you go down it becomes more and
[15:23] more Fierce more and more strength to it
[15:25] in each metal and so if you move over to
[15:28] another Vision that um Daniel sees he
[15:32] sees the the lion with the wings of an
[15:34] eagle and and that's the Babylonian
[15:37] Empire well when the medes in Persian
[15:39] come and take it Daniel sees that the
[15:41] the eagle's wings are plucked off the
[15:43] Lion's back and and uh you know the lion
[15:46] loses its power and then this bear comes
[15:48] up and he's got three ribs and this is
[15:51] just this is fascinating to me because
[15:53] when you get into the prophets of the
[15:56] Bible and how maybe they didn't know
[15:59] exactly what they were seeing but with
[16:01] Daniel each Vision he he saw he's asking
[16:06] for the interpretation and there's the
[16:07] angel giving him the interpretation
[16:10] so this bear is is a great strength and
[16:14] the three ribs in its mouth historians
[16:17] believe are the Babylonian the medes and
[16:20] the Persian Empires that you know they
[16:23] everyone fighting taking everybody's
[16:24] power
[16:25] so you just see the the accuracy of the
[16:28] vision of a prophet
[16:30] amen
[16:31] and then so on and so forth and and of
[16:34] course the last Beast uh the Roman is is
[16:37] the you know great a Great Dragon and
[16:39] it's it's uh Daniel describes it as a
[16:42] troubling Beast because it's the power
[16:44] is so great and it's so diverse
[16:46] then you have the the RAM and as we read
[16:49] the the two horns on the ram the one
[16:51] smaller the one larger
[16:55] so but the natures of these kingdoms
[16:57] coming down is is the nature of of the
[17:00] metal they're made out of and so silver
[17:03] is obviously not the the hardest metal
[17:05] but it's a stronger metal
[17:08] and so Esther's being raised up in this
[17:10] and she's being raised up in this this
[17:13] uh so-called religious and and diverse
[17:17] and and uh ever expanding wealthy
[17:21] Kingdom and this is what Esther's
[17:23] growing up in so as as I was reading
[17:26] Esther I started thinking well what's
[17:28] the what's the spirit of what's the
[17:30] spirit of that Nation what would the
[17:32] what would the spirit of that Nation
[17:33] look like
[17:35] there was a hierarchy of Elites who hold
[17:38] the power
[17:39] it was it was a a a king or uh yeah a
[17:44] king and under that King there was
[17:47] nobleman and princes set up over all of
[17:49] these vast provinces uh so it'd be like
[17:52] the United States we got the president
[17:54] and then you got all the governors of
[17:56] all the states and they they were the
[17:59] elites
[18:00] they held the power they hold the wealth
[18:04] and it sounds just like today
[18:06] it was a very rich and glorious Kingdom
[18:09] there was a spirit on this Kingdom of
[18:12] expensive party
[18:13] the king wasn't just saying you know hey
[18:16] let's party he was bringing out the best
[18:18] of everything he got
[18:20] everything just the drapery the the fine
[18:23] Linens the the the gold and silver was
[18:26] just beautiful
[18:29] and and artistic and and uh you know the
[18:33] craftsmanship
[18:34] there was a spirit of great pride that
[18:36] we see on the Persian Empire
[18:39] there was a spirit of excess
[18:42] and what I'm going to say what I'm going
[18:44] to label as addiction and and
[18:48] drunkardness because the king says hey
[18:50] whatever these guys want give them
[18:53] absolutely everything they want to drink
[18:55] Don't Force It on them but don't
[18:57] withhold it from them
[18:59] and it actually says according to the
[19:01] state of the king so this guy must have
[19:03] been drunk off as rocker
[19:07] a spirit of uh heathenism even though it
[19:11] was mono uh you know believed in one God
[19:14] yet you see something very very similar
[19:18] to
[19:19] um you know the Greeks with all of their
[19:21] gods and and dare I say that you know
[19:24] the Catholic church with their Saints
[19:26] and and you know it becomes blurred and
[19:29] yeah we believe in one God but yet he's
[19:32] he's three different persons well no
[19:35] he's not and you know so you get into
[19:37] this Hedonism and and that's what's
[19:39] being described in their religion
[19:44] and it's actually as as uh the words we
[19:48] use today inclusive and and you know
[19:51] people have their freedoms and things
[19:53] yet the medes and Persians held to their
[19:56] laws so tightly that that not even the
[19:59] king when a law was enacted not even the
[20:02] king could change it
[20:04] not even the king could change the law
[20:05] so they were forcing laws and as you see
[20:08] in the story of Esther they actually
[20:10] used those laws force it on others
[20:13] but you see it particularly forced on on
[20:16] God's people
[20:18] and it's trying to control them into
[20:21] ungodly ways and and to the end is
[20:24] destruction because you remember Haman
[20:26] wrote and enacted a law uh tricked the
[20:29] king actually enacted a law and said you
[20:32] know this people we need to wipe them
[20:34] off the face of the Earth
[20:36] they're not they're they're they're
[20:37] trying to overthrow you they have their
[20:40] own government
[20:42] and and so it's trying they're writing
[20:45] laws to try to control the people and
[20:48] and force them into against their
[20:51] religion and force them into destruction
[20:54] it was an age from what I can gather of
[20:57] of beautiful women
[20:58] in a spirit of immodesty I imagine they
[21:01] said you know when in Esther when the
[21:03] the uh the all the women that they take
[21:06] all the young virgins and they're
[21:07] presenting them before the king they do
[21:10] their purification time and then before
[21:12] they go into the king they say you can
[21:14] pick whatever you want to go in well
[21:16] keep in mind that this is the this is
[21:18] they're trying to please the king they
[21:20] want to be Queen
[21:21] so I imagine that they're not dressing
[21:25] the most modest they're dressing to
[21:27] appeal
[21:29] there's a spirit of anger and rage and
[21:32] murder in the Persian Empire the King
[21:35] has a short temper it seems like all the
[21:38] time he's getting mad and he's getting
[21:40] so mad that he has to you know run out
[21:43] of the room because he's so mad
[21:45] uh Haman when Haman gets uh you know he
[21:49] he's he's Mordecai won't bow to him and
[21:52] he gets so angry he comes into his
[21:54] household and he's just he's he's a
[21:56] raging lunatic and you know and what are
[22:00] we gonna do how are we going to fix this
[22:01] what are we going to do to get rid of
[22:02] Mordecai all the way to you know what
[22:05] let's just let's just murder him just
[22:07] murder all the Jews and start building
[22:09] The Gallows for Mordecai it's a spirit
[22:12] of rage and anger and murder
[22:15] it's a spirit of compromise
[22:17] when you look at the history and things
[22:20] the the the the temple is is
[22:24] during
[22:25] um from what I can tell there's a
[22:28] certain part of Queen Esther being there
[22:30] on the throne that the temple is
[22:32] actually being um I think I think it was
[22:35] the wall at the beginning and then the
[22:37] temple at the end and they rebuilding
[22:39] the temple well once the Temple's
[22:40] rebuilt the walls are repaired the city
[22:42] of Jerusalem hey guys it's time to go
[22:44] home we're free to go some of the Jews a
[22:47] lot of the Jews stayed back because they
[22:50] enjoyed the I'm going to call it the
[22:52] laodicean lifestyle
[22:54] the the lukewarm the blending well you
[22:57] know these guys believe in one God
[22:58] anyway so it's not really that bad
[23:01] you know when they when they had the
[23:03] freedom they had the promises that that
[23:05] God said hey you're going home I I I'm
[23:08] giving it back to you you're gonna
[23:10] rebuild this thing and yet they said
[23:12] well you know what we're we're good
[23:14] just just let us stay here
[23:18] so I think these are my last two slides
[23:20] now this this hurt my eyes to look at
[23:22] but I just I just wanted to show you
[23:24] that you have uh Daniel down here at the
[23:28] bottom and just the again
[23:31] my my nerdiness I don't know but you
[23:34] watch how these start overlapping and
[23:37] and I don't know if if these different
[23:40] ones you know heard of each other but I
[23:42] could imagine that if they would have
[23:44] they would have been thrilled to know
[23:46] that there was other believers who
[23:47] believed like them in in such a time as
[23:50] this
[23:51] so you have Daniel here Ezra comes in
[23:55] um the the building of the Temple
[23:59] um let's see Esther's right a little
[24:01] over offset to the middle
[24:03] then you have the rest of the book of
[24:05] Ezra right into Nehemiah and and the
[24:08] return to Jerusalem under Nehemiah so
[24:10] it's it's to me it's just remarkable to
[24:13] see the the prophecy the Fulfillment of
[24:16] Prophecy the the timeline how this stuff
[24:19] starts overlapping and you know if you
[24:22] know your your church ages and your
[24:24] seals you start seeing the you know
[24:26] brother Branham will talk about how they
[24:28] they overlap one with the other a little
[24:30] bit and everything so I I mean to me
[24:34] when I look at this I just see it
[24:35] perfectly I'm not be able to understand
[24:38] it fully and explain it maybe I'm making
[24:41] you confused but it's just maybe the
[24:45] visual and then this scrunches it down
[24:46] just a little bit they don't put Daniel
[24:48] in here I wish they would have but
[24:51] um you know you can see a little bit
[24:54] more zoomed in I guess on the Temple
[24:56] completed the decree of Cyrus and all
[25:00] through that is just amazing I've
[25:01] mentioned it here before how uh you know
[25:05] um
[25:06] Ezra would would raise up and these guys
[25:09] I and I don't know why this is but
[25:11] they're all it's all people who are
[25:13] close to a King
[25:15] it's all people close to a King maybe
[25:17] it's because it's it's types and shadows
[25:19] of our position in Christ we're close to
[25:21] the king and so uh Ezra Nehemiah Esther
[25:25] being Queen
[25:27] um Daniel uh you know it's just again
[25:31] it's just amazing to me but you have men
[25:34] if you go read Ezra you have men coming
[25:37] to the king you know the king says oh
[25:39] yeah you know what you go and go do
[25:41] what's in your heart you know this is
[25:43] the Persian Empire and and they're
[25:45] saying you know you believe that way go
[25:47] ahead go go do it some Kings even saying
[25:50] hey write it write it in the law give
[25:53] them everything they need to fulfill
[25:55] this thing and then somebody raises up
[25:57] to you know uh two two little spiritual
[26:02] you know demons and they say you know
[26:05] hey King these guys are doing bad and so
[26:07] the king says well stop them
[26:09] and then God gives favor again and it
[26:11] rises up and so it's just this back and
[26:14] forth and if and if I can say it without
[26:16] it losing the the importance and and the
[26:19] spiritual aspect of it it's just a
[26:20] battle constantly of Good and Evil
[26:23] and we see that so
[26:25] that's the last slide I have to control
[26:27] up here guys
[26:30] so Esther this is what Esther grew up in
[26:33] this is what Esther becomes queen of
[26:37] and so I just as I was as I was studying
[26:42] this and and just this
[26:44] and I'll just be honest it's pressing on
[26:47] my heart and I don't even know fully how
[26:49] to explain what it is that's pressing
[26:51] but
[26:52] I got to thinking about the spirit of
[26:54] America
[26:56] and I didn't get to go through uh as
[26:58] extensively as I wanted to but again
[27:01] here we find similar traits we find
[27:05] um
[27:06] a spirit of access
[27:08] or of well you have access to you have
[27:11] access to a lot of things that you don't
[27:13] want to have access to or shouldn't but
[27:16] excess you have a spirit of excess of of
[27:20] of drunkenness
[27:22] everybody drinks
[27:24] every you know you go out to a a company
[27:27] lunch and hey guys boss says everyone
[27:30] can have a drink
[27:34] it's like that's the thing that you live
[27:36] for that's the thing that you want to do
[27:38] how much can you drink I've had people
[27:40] say man I great time it was a great time
[27:43] well what what'd you do oh we got drunk
[27:46] I don't even remember the evening
[27:48] sounds like a great time
[27:51] but you know not I I I don't mean to
[27:54] poke fun I shouldn't poke fun because
[27:56] that's that's what they have that's what
[27:58] they have that brings them pleasure
[28:00] they're they're they're actually we've
[28:02] heard it before they're they're missing
[28:04] something they're they're craving
[28:05] something and
[28:07] somehow the the alcohol is what fulfills
[28:10] it or they think fulfills it temporarily
[28:13] the spirit of America is
[28:16] is a spirit of lust and immorality and
[28:19] sexuality
[28:21] it's it's a it's a we we have a spirit
[28:24] of uh you know women worship
[28:28] and we have
[28:30] um a want a spirit of want for
[28:33] entertainment
[28:34] and entertainment not the gospel
[28:37] you know if if you're gonna have me come
[28:39] to church then give me a show not the
[28:41] gospel
[28:47] are you with me tonight
[28:49] are you picking up what I'm laying down
[28:53] we have a spirit of scoffing at the word
[28:56] of God
[28:57] of of scoffing at religion and and you
[29:00] know it it's it's having compassion for
[29:03] these people because
[29:05] there's there's lots of people who have
[29:07] been hurt by religion or who don't
[29:10] understand religion and we don't want
[29:12] religion here it's not religion that
[29:15] we're after we're after we're after
[29:17] Faith we're after Jesus Christ we're
[29:19] after a person not a religion
[29:22] we don't we don't want we don't want
[29:24] members we don't need numbers we want
[29:27] the quality of the spirit of Jesus
[29:29] Christ we want spirit and Truth
[29:32] but the world the spirit of America they
[29:35] don't want that they don't want the
[29:36] truth they don't want you to tell them
[29:38] who they are or or what they are they
[29:42] want to tell that they want to make it
[29:44] up for themselves
[29:46] they we have a spirit of of uh of
[29:51] comfort
[29:52] we have a spirit of comfort in that we
[29:55] have
[29:56] um extravagances we have that excess
[29:59] access we have the Comforts of of living
[30:03] and we become soft from it
[30:05] and then we get comfortable and
[30:07] satisfied with sin it's a spirit of
[30:10] comfortable and satisfaction with sin
[30:12] well that that don't really bother me I
[30:14] can handle that everybody else is doing
[30:16] it
[30:17] it's comfort with extravagance and
[30:19] convenience we have a spirit of
[30:21] self-seeking seeking after temporal
[30:24] fleeting things that have no lasting Joy
[30:27] what what what pleases me right now what
[30:30] makes me happy now
[30:34] we have a spirit of pride and arrogance
[30:36] in this country
[30:38] we have a spirit of
[30:41] uh
[30:42] don't turn me off
[30:46] we have a spirit of insanity and uh
[30:49] mentally unstable
[30:51] it's it's a spirit it's it's a it's a
[30:53] there's an anxiety there's a spirit of
[30:55] anxiety
[30:56] in in the culture around us and listen
[30:59] we have a spirit of irreverence but what
[31:02] I want you to catch is I don't want you
[31:04] to I don't want you to say boy brother
[31:06] Brandon you're making me feel really bad
[31:08] I want you to go back to Daniel and I
[31:11] want you to realize that if Persia had a
[31:13] prince then the United States has a
[31:15] prince
[31:16] and Europe has a prince and France has a
[31:19] prince
[31:20] amen you see the spiritual warfare
[31:23] there's there's There Were King
[31:25] spiritual Kings in Persia that were
[31:27] warring against the spirit and yet in
[31:30] all of that that just a beautiful
[31:32] picture of us there's the beautiful
[31:34] there's there's a there's a Remnant
[31:37] there there's a there's a there's a
[31:39] light in the midst of Darkness that's
[31:40] there and you have these spirits that
[31:43] are fighting but they have to be
[31:44] fighting something and they're fighting
[31:46] against their warring against you
[31:47] they're warring against the spirit of
[31:50] Christ trying to get to you you cry out
[31:53] and you say you know father I'm I'm I'm
[31:56] drowning in the spirit of of excess uh
[32:00] father I'm dealing I feel that Spirit of
[32:02] lust I I feel the doubt sometimes in the
[32:06] word of God I feel that but I know it's
[32:08] not me but yet it's pressing on my mind
[32:11] I I I feel uh Pride I feel arrogance
[32:15] father help me deliver me from that help
[32:18] me out of this thing Lord I Need you and
[32:21] you're crying out and remember that the
[32:23] spirit says I heard you from the first
[32:26] day you lifted your voice
[32:28] I heard you the very moment that you
[32:30] cried out but I got caught up fighting
[32:33] against the spirit of America I got
[32:35] caught up fighting against the prince
[32:37] and power of the air which is the devil
[32:40] in the scripture
[32:42] and yet we have this
[32:45] and I'm clipping along real good so I
[32:47] promise I might even be done in 45
[32:49] minutes not from now total
[32:54] so you have this Spirit of America you
[32:56] have the spirit of Persia you have you
[32:59] have the spirit that that Esther but if
[33:01] you look at Esther what a beautiful
[33:04] image of the bride of Christ
[33:06] what a beautiful depiction
[33:09] it says that that God is is is not
[33:13] mentioned his name is not mentioned
[33:16] they're not I imagine in the Jewish it
[33:19] would be Yahweh it would be it would be
[33:21] Jehovah and it's not mentioned once in
[33:24] the Book of Esther but yet it's it's one
[33:26] of the most
[33:27] it's one of the most beautiful and
[33:30] moving love stories I've ever seen
[33:32] and if you catch it from the spiritual
[33:34] side it's it's the most beautiful one of
[33:37] the most beautiful depictions of Jesus
[33:39] Christ and his bride
[33:41] a king and a bride
[33:43] an enemy good versus evil you have all
[33:47] of these playing out
[33:49] and yet you have Esther
[33:51] with with a
[33:54] with an atmosphere around her
[33:57] something that when she gets she gets
[33:59] she's it says that even before she's
[34:01] taken she's she's loved she's beautiful
[34:05] she's loved by everybody around her and
[34:07] then she gets taken and and immediately
[34:10] the the the one set above her I believe
[34:14] it's uh pronounced hagai or Hagee eye
[34:18] um the over the concubines and he's in
[34:20] charge of prepping these young virgins
[34:22] for the king and immediately she finds
[34:24] favor with him
[34:26] and we said it before she she says you
[34:28] know what give her seven servants
[34:31] seven Church age Messengers
[34:34] and and and and let them Let The
[34:37] Messengers dress her
[34:39] let them be the ones who get her
[34:41] prepared for the king
[34:43] and she's just she's catching everyone's
[34:46] attention and then she goes before the
[34:48] king and she's she's the fairest she's
[34:50] the chosen just he's just
[34:54] so caught by her beauty but it says when
[34:57] all of these other women they're they're
[34:58] picking what they want to take in before
[35:00] the king and you know I told you they're
[35:02] probably you know dressing down instead
[35:04] of dressing up but you know give me all
[35:06] the gold because if I can keep it when
[35:08] I'm done we're loaded for bear
[35:11] just in case I don't get chosen but but
[35:14] you know she's she's she expresses to to
[35:18] who I I'm calling the prophet in the
[35:21] story hagiai the one who's dressing her
[35:23] the one who knows the king and she says
[35:26] no you pick what I wear
[35:29] you pick what I take with me you know
[35:32] him more than I do you tell me what
[35:35] should I take before the king and she
[35:37] relies on his word and she does it and
[35:40] it catches the king's attention and this
[35:43] is in the midst of this Persian Empire
[35:45] this is in the midst of this this this
[35:48] Prince of Persia of these Kings of
[35:51] Persia of this this Spirit on this
[35:54] nation of Persia
[35:57] but I just I didn't want to leave you
[35:59] with that and and end right there
[36:02] I
[36:04] I was I was searching a message and you
[36:07] know trying to find where brother
[36:08] Branham talked about the the spirit of
[36:10] America the spirit on a nation
[36:14] and I found something and it was I only
[36:16] got through one message and not even the
[36:18] whole thing it was just
[36:20] you know sometimes in in study that you
[36:23] know the Lord will just start firing
[36:24] things and so
[36:27] we have the spirit of Persia we have the
[36:30] spirit of America and how they link so
[36:32] closely together
[36:34] but then there's this Spirit from above
[36:37] in the midst of this there's a spirit
[36:39] from above
[36:41] it's a spirit of of of judgment and
[36:44] warning
[36:46] and the scripture says judgment begins
[36:48] at the house of God
[36:50] it's a spirit of righteousness
[36:53] Spirit of above it's of righteousness
[36:56] not of our own but of his
[36:59] it's a spirit of of the power of the
[37:02] Holy Ghost and Resurrection
[37:04] that you have access to a spirit from
[37:07] above
[37:08] it's a spirit where comes into you and
[37:11] you're born from above this world is not
[37:14] our home we're just passing through
[37:16] we're pilgrims and strangers in this
[37:19] land just like Esther was a pilgrim and
[37:21] Stranger in Persia
[37:24] uh we're seeking a land to come not
[37:27] seeking worldly pleasures
[37:31] the spirit from above is a new creature
[37:33] in Christ it's a changed nature
[37:37] it's so that you don't have to be bound
[37:39] by the nature of America
[37:42] you can be bound by the spirit of above
[37:45] you could be become a love slave from
[37:47] above
[37:48] it's a spirit of morality and modesty
[37:53] it's a spirit that cannot fail though
[37:56] you may fail from time to time this
[37:59] Spirit can never fail and if the spirit
[38:01] can never fail and the spirit is in you
[38:04] you cannot fail
[38:08] it's a spirit of of
[38:11] not fear but it's a spirit of power and
[38:15] of love and of a sound mind
[38:18] in a nation that's going and saying
[38:20] that's gone it's gone it's insane
[38:23] in the nation that's full of anxiety and
[38:27] things that feed anxiety
[38:29] in a nation that that you know it's just
[38:33] it's become
[38:34] coveted to me was such a turning point
[38:37] for everything
[38:39] supply chain
[38:41] uh people's attitudes
[38:44] patience
[38:47] a a temper
[38:49] and yet in the midst of all that
[38:52] you can have a spirit above that says
[38:54] peace I give unto you
[38:57] not as the world give us gives peace but
[38:59] peace I give unto you that passes all
[39:02] understanding
[39:04] power Love A sound mind
[39:07] peace and a calm in the midst of the
[39:09] storm a calm in the midst of the spirit
[39:12] of America
[39:14] that's what you have access to tonight
[39:17] you have absolute access to it
[39:20] can you put up my uh
[39:23] my first slide
[39:28] Brother Kyle said this when he mentioned
[39:30] that the the size of this was just a
[39:33] little bit smaller than
[39:35] than the United States you remember
[39:39] he said this a given credit I guess
[39:43] you remember the king says Esther what
[39:45] do you want I'll give you up to half of
[39:47] my kingdom
[39:49] so take the United States split it in
[39:51] half
[39:53] take the kingdom of God that has no
[39:55] boundaries
[39:56] there are no borders to the kingdom of
[39:58] God
[39:59] and and Esther is not put in the Bible
[40:02] just as as some story
[40:05] a fairy tale to make you give you
[40:07] reading pleasure at night to help you
[40:09] fall asleep
[40:11] if this if this was a natural King
[40:14] offering Esther half of his kingdom
[40:17] then we're given we're we're offered
[40:21] half of the kingdom of Jesus Christ that
[40:23] doesn't have any borders can you imagine
[40:25] if you're offered now that doesn't even
[40:28] make good math you're offered a kingdom
[40:31] that doesn't have borders and boundaries
[40:32] and you're offered half of it you know
[40:34] what you get eternity
[40:36] you get eternity if there is no
[40:38] beginning and end of this Kingdom and
[40:40] you're offered half of it then you get
[40:42] eternity you have full access to
[40:44] everything from above you have full
[40:46] access in a in a
[40:49] I want to drive it home if you have
[40:52] access in a nation and in a spirit that
[40:55] that's warring against your your flesh
[40:59] is constantly before you you flesh your
[41:01] spirit is constantly oppressing you
[41:03] because Satan has access to that but yet
[41:06] in your soul you have the spirit of God
[41:08] you have full access to Everything Jesus
[41:11] Christ died for
[41:13] you have full Redemptive rights that
[41:15] have been given to you take up to half
[41:18] of the Kingdom if you want it
[41:23] go to Daniel 7 with me
[41:29] Daniel 7 and verse 13.
[41:38] I'm going to read you a couple more
[41:39] scriptures that we're closing on this
[41:43] Daniel 7 13.
[41:46] I'm going to read it off my notes so I
[41:48] don't read too much but you you watch it
[41:49] in your Bible
[41:50] I saw in the night visions and behold
[41:53] one like the son of man came with the
[41:55] clouds of heaven and came to the Ancient
[41:57] of Days
[41:58] and they brought him near before him and
[42:01] there was given him Dominion so this is
[42:03] talking about one of the beasts the the
[42:05] the worst Beast of all of them
[42:07] uh
[42:10] no I'm sorry this is talking about Jesus
[42:12] Christ here and there was giving him
[42:14] dominion and glory and a kingdom that
[42:16] all people Nations and tongues should
[42:18] serve him his Dominion is an everlasting
[42:21] Dominion see what I just told you
[42:23] Without Borders it's an everlasting
[42:25] Dominion which shall not pass away he
[42:28] can't fail and his kingdom uh and his
[42:32] kingdom that which shall not be
[42:33] destroyed
[42:36] good go to versa 17.
[42:40] these great beasts which are four are
[42:43] Four Kings which shall rise out of the
[42:45] Earth but the Saints of the most high
[42:48] shall take the kingdom and possess the
[42:50] kingdom forever even forever and ever
[42:55] so if forever wasn't good enough you get
[42:57] it forever and ever and ever and ever
[43:00] and ever and ever
[43:03] you possess the kingdom it's not just
[43:05] his he's offering you full Redemptive
[43:08] rights verse 19 then I would know the
[43:11] truth of the four beasts which was
[43:13] diverse from all the others exceeding
[43:15] Dreadful whose teeth were of iron and
[43:17] his nails of brass which devoured
[43:20] breaking pieces and stamped the residue
[43:22] with his feet and of the ten horns that
[43:24] were in his head and of the others which
[43:27] came up and before whom three fell even
[43:30] of the horn that had eyes and a mouth
[43:32] that spake very great things whose look
[43:34] was more Stout than his fellows I beheld
[43:37] that the same horde made war with the
[43:39] Saints uh oh
[43:41] and prevailed against them
[43:43] until the Ancient of Days came and
[43:47] judgment was given to the Saints of the
[43:49] most high and the time came that the
[43:51] Saints possessed the kingdom
[43:54] verse 25 and he shall speak great words
[43:56] against the most high this beast and
[43:58] shall wear out the Saints boy if you
[44:01] ain't wore out I sure am
[44:03] he's going to wear out the Saints of the
[44:05] most high and think to change times and
[44:07] laws
[44:10] and they shall be given into his hand
[44:12] until a time and times and the dividing
[44:14] of times but the Judgment shall sit and
[44:18] they shall take away his Dominion to
[44:21] consume and destroy it unto the end and
[44:24] the kingdom and the Dominion and the
[44:26] greatness of the Kingdom Under the whole
[44:27] Heaven shall be given to who
[44:30] shall be given to the people of the
[44:33] Saints of the most high whose kingdom is
[44:35] an everlasting Kingdom and all Dominion
[44:38] Shall Serve and Obey him you're given
[44:41] that Dominion you're given the kingdom
[44:44] Daniel 10 and verse 20.
[44:49] Daniel 10 and verse 20.
[44:51] this is the end of where we started
[44:54] the Prince of Persia that that he was
[44:57] fighting against Daniel 10 verse 20.
[45:01] then said he knowest thou wherefore I
[45:04] came unto thee and now I will return to
[45:06] fight with the Prince of Persia
[45:09] and when I am gone forth Lo the prince
[45:11] of Grisha shall come but I will show
[45:15] thee that which is noted in the
[45:16] scripture of Truth and there is none
[45:19] that holdeth with me in these things but
[45:21] Michael your prince
[45:24] not only do you get the kingdom and not
[45:27] only are there Spirits fighting us but
