Overcome

Lyrics:
You say, “Hold every thought captive”
But my thoughts have chains on me
You say, “Faith can move the mountains”
God, help my unbelief
Every doubt keeps pulling me under
Every fear keeps dragging me down
How long, oh Lord, till You pull me out?

Then I see You reach for me
In valleys dark and oceans deep
I’m overwhelmed
I’m overrun
But it’s not over
If the night should carry on
Remind me where my strength is from
I’m overwhelmed
I’m overrun
But I’m holding on
‘Cause soon I’ll overcome

I can hear a million voices that arе filling up my mind
All the lies I keep beliеving are the fears I try to hide
Every doubt keeps pulling me under
Every fear keeps dragging me down
How long (how long)
Oh Lord (oh Lord) till You pull me out?

Then I see You reach for me
In valleys dark and oceans deep
I’m overwhelmed
I’m overrun
But it’s not over
If the night should carry on
Remind me where my strength is from
I’m overwhelmed
I’m overrun
But I’m holding on
‘Cause soon I’ll overcome

You are the rock of my salvation
You are the hope on which I stand
And when the waters rise around me
I lift my hands (I lift my hands)

Then I see You reach for me
In valleys dark and oceans deep
I’m overwhelmed
I’m overrun
But it’s not over
If the night should carry on
Remind me where my strength is from
I’m overwhelmed
I’m overrun
But I’m holding on
‘Cause soon I’ll overcome
Soon I’ll overcome
I’ll overcome
I’ll overcome
I’ll overcome
