[0:00] a subject um it might seem strange
[0:03] uh you know just the the subject matter
[0:06] or the title this morning but i want to
[0:08] call it uh this storm in a teacup
[0:11] a storm in a teacup now it's kind of a
[0:13] phrase that people use out there and
[0:15] it's it's generally means you know is to
[0:18] make something bigger than what it
[0:19] really is
[0:20] and today we want to look at the storms
[0:22] in our lives and to recognize you know
[0:25] it's not something to ignore those
[0:27] things you know we don't want to ignore
[0:29] troubles and trials and things like that
[0:30] they come for a reason and so we want to
[0:32] look at these things and and right we'd
[0:34] rather want to recognize them and see
[0:36] how best to deal with those storms so
[0:39] that's kind of the approach we want to
[0:41] take this morning is is to recognize we
[0:43] have storms and that our trials are
[0:46] are something that we face
[0:48] and and how do we face those trials why
[0:50] do they happen to us what is the
[0:52] intention behind these things and do we
[0:54] need to be afraid of them you know
[0:55] there's there's a lot of things
[0:57] happening out there the world is
[0:58] changing and
[0:59] and there's all kinds of things are
[1:01] changing around us but but there's god
[1:04] always has the answer for those things
[1:06] so we're going to turn to the word and
[1:07] we're going to ask the lord to give us
[1:09] an answer this morning amen
[1:13] amen
[1:14] in first john 4 and 4 if you'll turn
[1:16] with me there
[1:19] and well known scripture
[1:22] it says you are of god little children
[1:24] and have overcome them because greater
[1:26] is he that is in you than he that is in
[1:29] the world amen
[1:31] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:33] that is in the world
[1:36] and in john 18 and 11 i'll just read
[1:38] that for you
[1:39] then said jesus unto peter put up thy
[1:42] sword into the sheath the cup which my
[1:44] father hath given me shall i not drink
[1:47] it
[1:47] amen we're going to bow our heads just
[1:49] for a moment once more
[1:51] gracious heavenly father we want to just
[1:52] give you thanks from our hearts this
[1:55] morning we give you praise
[1:57] lord we love you we so appreciate you
[1:59] this morning
[2:01] your presence in this place lord you are
[2:03] awesome
[2:04] you are wonderful lord and you are
[2:06] faithful
[2:07] lord so we just want to step aside lord
[2:09] let your holy spirit have full
[2:11] preeminence this morning
[2:13] you would take control of every thought
[2:14] every word that would be spoken
[2:16] lord i humble myself before you this
[2:19] morning
[2:20] lord i don't know these people lord but
[2:22] you know them father better than anybody
[2:24] you know our needs this morning you know
[2:27] what is going on in the deep recesses of
[2:29] our hearts and our souls oh god but lord
[2:32] you know lord because you're the
[2:33] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[2:35] the heart you know how to speak lord you
[2:37] know how to answer you know how to
[2:38] change you know how to deliver so lord
[2:41] we turn to you this morning father we
[2:43] ask for you to come we invite you lord
[2:45] take control of the service just now
[2:47] and we'll be quick to give you all the
[2:49] praise and all the glory we thank you
[2:50] for the reading of your word this
[2:52] morning may it encourage us let it bless
[2:54] us and give us nourishment for the
[2:55] journey that we face
[2:57] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[3:00] you may be seated
[3:02] so i think we can all agree this morning
[3:04] that there are storms all around us
[3:07] and we face things and trials and and we
[3:09] don't want to have a pity party this
[3:11] morning so don't get me wrong today we
[3:14] want to look at these things with a
[3:15] sober mind
[3:16] we don't want to approach it in the
[3:18] sense of i'm so weak and and it's such a
[3:20] weary and a dreadful land and and i
[3:23] can't just wait to get out of here know
[3:24] this we have a purpose in all these
[3:26] things and god has custom built us for
[3:29] this age he made us with the intent of
[3:32] facing these things with the intent of
[3:34] us overcoming and i feel like god wants
[3:37] to tell us his secret concerning us amen
[3:40] like he said in in the old testament he
[3:42] said shall i come and tell them the
[3:44] secret concerning them what what what my
[3:46] thoughts are concerning them in this day
[3:48] what my purpose is
[3:50] for all these things and i feel like the
[3:52] lord wants to tell us this morning i
[3:53] have a purpose in all these things
[3:56] amen don't think that kova took god by
[3:58] surprise don't think that all our
[4:00] families and church issues and all these
[4:02] kinds of things to god by surprise he
[4:04] knew these things would happen amen and
[4:06] we look at them as a great storm we look
[4:08] at them as great trials but we we must
[4:11] not forget that those things have a
[4:13] purpose in our life that there's a
[4:15] blessing in those things
[4:18] amen
[4:19] and we see even here jesus
[4:21] saying unto peter because sometimes we
[4:23] want to fight against those trials we
[4:25] try to try to avoid those storms we try
[4:28] to go around it or try to think that as
[4:30] a christian now you know our life will
[4:32] be a bit of ease and you know we'll just
[4:34] coast through here and go into eternity
[4:36] that's not how it happens i just want to
[4:38] put a disclaimer out there this morning
[4:41] amen but look at even jesus even as as
[4:43] his disciple uh peter there you know
[4:46] with his zealous heart and and he wanted
[4:48] to defend jesus from what was happening
[4:50] there but jesus knew the blessing that
[4:52] was waiting in the drinking of that cup
[4:55] amen and and to peter this looked like
[4:58] everything was falling apart and the
[5:00] whole world has turned against this the
[5:02] this jesus and and their teacher their
[5:05] this messiah that has come and and you
[5:08] know they thought maybe everything was
[5:10] you know was falling apart and why is it
[5:12] happening the way it's happening and we
[5:14] didn't think that we would uh find
[5:16] ourself in this kind of a situation or
[5:18] this kind of a scenario what's happening
[5:21] and out of his flesh he reaches for his
[5:23] sword and he tries to defend the gospel
[5:26] he tries to defend the truth for the day
[5:28] not recognizing that in the storm was a
[5:31] blessing coming
[5:33] oh my my brother and sister we don't
[5:35] have to fear the storms in our life we
[5:36] don't have to worry about the things
[5:38] that are happening god has made us for
[5:40] this day
[5:41] god has given us an anointing god has
[5:44] given us a spirit to overcome amen i
[5:46] think of joshua and caleb amen they had
[5:49] a special anointing that's why they
[5:51] could withstand the trials of their day
[5:53] that's why they could walk into the
[5:54] promised land because god had put a
[5:56] spirit a special spirit upon them
[5:59] hallelujah
[6:01] amen i feel good this morning
[6:03] so we recognize we live in a time of a
[6:06] great shaking
[6:07] a great trouble and great storms and
[6:09] things but the key this morning and i
[6:12] want to reiterate that once more is not
[6:14] to run from the storms
[6:16] we don't hide and cower from these
[6:19] things my brother and sister and i want
[6:20] to encourage you young people if you go
[6:22] to a public school or if you get a
[6:24] career and you go to work one day you
[6:26] don't have to kind of you know go into
[6:28] work and kind of hide from everything
[6:29] and try to you know just be really
[6:31] tender and careful my brother sister you
[6:34] are the light of the world
[6:36] a man greater is he that is in you than
[6:38] he that is in the world you don't have
[6:40] to be ashamed you don't have to be
[6:42] afraid you can stand and be accounted
[6:44] for amen
[6:46] god will take care of the rest
[6:48] the key is not to run from our storms
[6:51] and our challenges and our trials but
[6:52] rather recognize that he that is in you
[6:55] is greater than he that is in the world
[6:57] it is to recognize that you are more
[6:59] than able to overcome the storm because
[7:02] there is a blessing that god has waiting
[7:04] for you in the center of that storm
[7:07] amen there's a blessing i remember and
[7:09] sometimes it just comes as little things
[7:12] but you know i remember going through a
[7:13] great trial in my life not knowing which
[7:16] way to turn and not knowing what
[7:18] tomorrow holds and you know you just
[7:20] everything seems like just a big
[7:22] fog you know you just don't know which
[7:23] way to go and i remember going to work i
[7:26] was an electrician and
[7:27] i had to go this up this really long
[7:30] walkway up to this log home that we were
[7:32] doing work in and and i'm walking up the
[7:34] uh up this little trail and i remember
[7:36] going up there and just the weight of of
[7:39] the burden i was feeling it was crushing
[7:41] me you know you just feel like it's just
[7:42] too much to bear sometimes and and i
[7:45] just said that name of jesus i can't
[7:47] believe he sang that song this morning
[7:49] and i just said jesus i'm walking with
[7:51] you this morning and and i felt that it
[7:53] was just in the
[7:54] in the very early hours of the morning
[7:56] and you know what it wasn't an audible
[7:58] voice that came it wasn't god didn't
[8:00] send an angel or anything like that it
[8:02] wasn't like that it's just you know it
[8:04] was like a love touch from god i was
[8:06] just walking up that walkway and i can
[8:08] still remember the the feel of the the
[8:10] wooden rail on my hand
[8:12] but god just came by just like a cool
[8:13] breeze and he just to let me know it's
[8:15] okay i'm with you
[8:18] and it's enough to put push you through
[8:19] that day and then tomorrow he knows how
[8:21] to supply for that day and you know and
[8:23] you look back through your life and and
[8:25] my brother sister i think we would have
[8:26] to agree that god was there at every
[8:28] turn
[8:29] he knows just how to push us just enough
[8:31] he knows how to give us just enough
[8:33] strength for the next step
[8:35] amen
[8:36] we were driving down to phoenix
[8:38] one year this is a little while ago now
[8:41] and we were coming down this big hill
[8:44] and as you come down this this hill you
[8:46] can see the other side there's a valley
[8:48] and then there's a the you can see where
[8:50] the road comes up again on the other
[8:52] side and as we come over this hill
[8:55] there's a great big sandstorm blowing
[8:57] through this valley i don't know how
[8:59] many here have seen a sandstorm before
[9:01] but you know this this sandstorm you
[9:03] can't see anything you know so but i
[9:04] could see the road coming up on the
[9:06] other side and i don't know what that is
[9:08] about me but i thought well if i can see
[9:09] the road on the other side we'll just
[9:11] gotta keep the string real straight and
[9:13] just push on through
[9:16] everything should work out right
[9:18] anyway i found out later you're not
[9:19] supposed to drive through a sandstorm
[9:21] it's not good for you or your or your
[9:23] family or anybody
[9:25] but you know something told me that if i
[9:27] can see the the destination
[9:29] if i can just keep my eyes fixed on the
[9:32] destination
[9:33] and keep the wheels straight stay in the
[9:35] middle of the road i don't have to veer
[9:37] off this way don't have to go after this
[9:39] i just stay right in the middle of the
[9:40] road i should be able to make it all the
[9:42] way through and i remember coming down
[9:44] into the into that
[9:46] that area where the sandstorm was
[9:48] blowing through and and it was getting a
[9:50] little bit eerie you know i think once i
[9:52] started hitting the outskirts of the
[9:54] sandstorm you know you start to realize
[9:56] this is not a joke
[9:58] right this is not a something to be
[9:59] playing around with you know there was
[10:01] cars slowing down drastically and and
[10:04] you have to watch for that because
[10:05] because you can't see very far in front
[10:07] of you so in the in the time of the
[10:09] storm you know there's there's many
[10:11] hazards things happen
[10:13] you know and so you've got to be careful
[10:14] things slow down
[10:16] you know everything becomes slower and
[10:17] you and everything becomes really
[10:19] personal and very close up in the time
[10:21] of a storm amen you know what i'm
[10:23] talking about this morning and so you
[10:25] know you start to face things that you
[10:26] wouldn't face on just an open road
[10:29] and you have to be careful and you know
[10:31] maybe maybe even though you feel
[10:33] confident about something and and and
[10:35] maybe i felt confident about just
[10:37] plowing through and just keeping my eyes
[10:38] on the road and just keep it straight
[10:40] and just keep pulling through you know
[10:42] there's people that are not as confident
[10:44] and so they slow down and you got to
[10:45] watch out for that
[10:47] they become a hazard on the on the on
[10:48] the road and so you know all these
[10:50] little things start to happen and and we
[10:52] started to pull through and then there's
[10:54] vehicles that just you know they
[10:55] couldn't take it anymore what do they do
[10:57] they stop
[10:58] they just stop right in the middle of
[11:00] the road they they they it's too much
[11:02] the storm is is overwhelming they can't
[11:04] see where they're going they don't have
[11:06] any confidence in their vehicle or their
[11:08] what what they have with them or or
[11:10] where they're going so what happens is
[11:12] they just stop they they're paralyzed
[11:14] because of the storm
[11:16] and and they don't just put me in a
[11:18] awkward position or in a dangerous
[11:20] position but they put themselves in a
[11:22] very dangerous position
[11:24] amen
[11:25] so we don't want to stop in the middle
[11:27] of a storm we don't want to get
[11:29] paralyzed in our storms
[11:31] when we're going through a storm we've
[11:32] got to keep our eyes on jesus christ
[11:35] remember that this storm will pass
[11:38] that there is a destination that he's
[11:39] bringing us to that the road continues
[11:41] the road does not end in the storm
[11:46] it continues all the way through to the
[11:48] destination
[11:50] amen this storm even though everything
[11:52] seemed to slow down it seemed like an
[11:54] eternity in there it was only about five
[11:57] minutes actually
[12:02] and it's amazing you know when we
[12:03] finally reached our destination
[12:07] you know people ask you about your trip
[12:08] how was your trip how's the drive down
[12:10] and you know it's about a 24-hour drive
[12:13] from vancouver to phoenix
[12:15] and uh you know so it's a lot of time
[12:17] there and this little storm was about
[12:19] five minutes worth
[12:20] but you know the thing that you tend to
[12:22] talk about is the storm you talk about
[12:24] those five minutes you don't talk about
[12:26] the beautiful open roads and the
[12:28] sunshine and the blessings and how well
[12:31] everybody was driving and everything
[12:32] around you know you focus in on that one
[12:34] thing and during the season my brother
[12:36] and sister where we have coven and our
[12:38] governments and all this stuff i won't
[12:40] get into any details today but you know
[12:42] as we as we see all these things is we
[12:45] have to be careful we don't become
[12:46] distracted during this time
[12:48] because we can tend to focus on on you
[12:51] know this has been taken away from me or
[12:52] this has become harder or or life isn't
[12:55] what it used to be or is this a new
[12:56] normal and we start to focus on these
[12:58] things and then we start to make rash
[13:00] decisions based on those feelings
[13:04] and that's a very dangerous thing to be
[13:06] doing
[13:06] in the time of storm we need to keep our
[13:08] eyes fixed on the prize we need to stay
[13:10] in the middle of the road the storm will
[13:12] pass
[13:13] amen god will bring us through greater
[13:15] is he that is in us than he that is in
[13:17] the world
[13:21] storm in a teacup
[13:23] those storms can be very distracting
[13:25] let's be honest
[13:26] and i think that social media my brother
[13:28] and sister now i'm not here to preach
[13:31] anything specific forgive me brother
[13:32] paul but you know i personally don't
[13:34] have social media i leave that up to my
[13:36] wife i'm not i am not smart enough to
[13:38] handle all that stuff i find it way too
[13:41] distracting
[13:43] right and you see what social media has
[13:44] done today it how it distracts people
[13:47] right we we should have more time to
[13:50] read the message and to listen to tapes
[13:52] and to and to feed on the word and to
[13:54] pray but suddenly we have no time but we
[13:56] have time for social media and social
[13:59] media can be my brother and sister it
[14:00] can be a very great distraction
[14:05] we have to be careful
[14:07] keep our eyes
[14:09] fixed on the prize
[14:12] some people look at the storms and they
[14:14] refuse to go and they say you know what
[14:16] this is too big for me i'll just skip it
[14:19] maybe go back to vancouver i just
[14:21] you know this is too much i wasn't
[14:23] expecting the storm
[14:25] wasn't expecting it to get this hard
[14:28] wasn't expecting it to get this
[14:29] complicated or confusing or whatever it
[14:32] may be
[14:33] so just forget it i'm just i'm just
[14:35] gonna pull out and go home
[14:41] people get bogged down in storms you see
[14:44] a relationship where you see a young
[14:46] person they they were happy coming to
[14:48] church and they were you know excited
[14:50] and he saw the joy of the lord in their
[14:52] lives and and then suddenly all
[14:54] something changed
[14:56] something changes
[14:58] right they got bogged down in something
[15:00] and they need to break out of that
[15:03] now the bible tells us that we are
[15:07] if we are children that we are heirs
[15:09] heirs of god and joint heirs with christ
[15:11] so be that we suffer with him that we
[15:14] may also glorify
[15:16] be go also glorified together for i
[15:19] reckon that the sufferings of this
[15:21] present time are not worthy to be
[15:22] compared with the glory which shall be
[15:25] revealed in us
[15:27] and that's a very important part there
[15:28] that revealed in us
[15:30] it's not an outside thing but god wants
[15:33] to reveal there's there's a there's a
[15:35] sharing of the sufferings of god there's
[15:37] a fellowship of the sufferings of god
[15:39] that we share in but it's not so that we
[15:41] can see who can endure the most or who
[15:44] who is strongest it's not about that
[15:46] it's god wants to reveal something
[15:48] that's in us
[15:49] he wants to prove you he wants to show
[15:52] something that's of value that he put
[15:54] there that's inside of you
[15:58] so we need to have the right attitude
[16:00] because god has a purpose in what we're
[16:03] going through
[16:05] the amplified bible in romans 5 3 it
[16:08] says moreover let us also be full of joy
[16:11] now
[16:12] now it doesn't matter what circumstance
[16:14] you're facing what you're going through
[16:16] we need to be full of joy now
[16:18] let us exalt and triumph in our troubles
[16:21] and rejoice in our sufferings
[16:25] how many here is so excited about their
[16:28] trial that they're going through
[16:30] can i see your hand this morning
[16:33] i mean i am just ecstatic i can't tell
[16:36] you how happy i am
[16:40] this is what the bible's telling us
[16:42] you know the prophet said we have things
[16:43] backwards right
[16:45] in the time of trial we should be
[16:46] excited we should exalt we should we
[16:49] should triumph in these things
[16:51] why because god is revealing something
[16:54] it's it's a moment where you're going to
[16:56] have a encounter with god that you
[16:58] cannot have otherwise
[17:01] god wants to have a fellowship he wants
[17:03] to have a communion he wants to share
[17:05] something with you he wants to tell you
[17:07] something about himself and who you are
[17:11] see it's
[17:12] we are to exalt and triumph in our
[17:14] troubles and rejoice in our sufferings
[17:16] knowing that pressure and affliction and
[17:18] hardship produce patient and unswerving
[17:21] endurance
[17:23] goes on and says and endurance
[17:26] fortitude develops the maturity of
[17:29] character
[17:30] how many wants to be mature
[17:32] well there's only one way to that
[17:34] maturity
[17:35] amen approve faith and tried integrity
[17:38] and character of this sort produces the
[17:41] habit of joyful and confident hope of
[17:44] eternal salvation you ever seen someone
[17:46] who's just quiet and you know they have
[17:48] that confidence about them you know they
[17:50] don't get too excited about this and
[17:52] that they just you know they're they're
[17:54] entered into a rest
[17:56] because they know what this is all about
[17:58] they know god's on the scene greater is
[18:00] he that is in me there's a rest they
[18:02] know who they are
[18:04] amen
[18:07] so i'm going to ask you a question this
[18:09] morning
[18:10] will you refuse to drink from the cup
[18:13] that god has given you
[18:15] think of jesus
[18:17] he had a cup that had been offered him
[18:20] a cup to drink from
[18:23] think of what every what what what all
[18:26] was in that cup the full wrath of god
[18:29] was poured out upon christ he had to
[18:31] drink the full wrath of god for us
[18:35] all of our sins all the all the judgment
[18:37] everything that we should have gotten he
[18:39] drank it for us
[18:42] and he was handed that cup to drink he
[18:43] had a decision to make
[18:45] will he drink from that cup
[18:48] what will you do
[18:51] we saw how peter tried to prevent jesus
[18:53] from drinking of that cup
[18:55] and drinking the cup was the scripture
[18:57] being played out and being fulfilled and
[18:59] peter wasn't watching that he was
[19:00] looking at the circumstances
[19:03] but in the meantime the word needed to
[19:05] be fulfilled
[19:06] something beautiful was happening the
[19:08] incredible part is what was happening
[19:10] was for peter's benefit
[19:12] and he was trying to stop it
[19:18] and read that to you once more the cup
[19:20] which my father hath given me shall i
[19:23] not drink it
[19:25] so we see that we are called to drink of
[19:26] the cup that is allotted to us
[19:29] each and every one of us we have a cup
[19:31] that's been given to us
[19:33] like jesus was and he set an example for
[19:36] us
[19:36] because if he can drink from that cup
[19:38] can we not drink from our cup
[19:41] so don't pass the cup off to someone
[19:43] else
[19:44] jesus recognized that the cup was his to
[19:46] drink that was his allotted portion
[19:49] no one else could drink of it no one
[19:51] else was going to do it no one else was
[19:54] able to drink from that cup but god
[19:56] knows what you can handle
[19:58] god had poured the full wrath
[20:01] his full wrath into this cup so we would
[20:03] never have been able to drink of that
[20:05] cup like that
[20:06] he had to do it for us
[20:08] but we must drink the cup that has been
[20:10] given to us
[20:11] we must and my brother sister whatever
[20:14] trial or or suffering or whatever you're
[20:17] going through sickness this morning i
[20:19] want you to put that all in front of you
[20:21] like a vision this morning put all those
[20:23] things out there and i don't want you to
[20:25] be afraid of it if it's a complex
[20:27] depression
[20:28] whatever it may be if you're looking for
[20:30] answers whatever is happening in your
[20:33] life right now i want you to face it
[20:35] put it out there there's a cup that you
[20:37] can't drink this morning
[20:41] we must drink it
[20:44] the sooner you drink it the better
[20:46] don't put it off to another day
[20:51] mark 10 and 38 says but jesus said unto
[20:53] them you know not what you ask
[20:55] can you drink of the cup that i drink of
[20:59] and be baptized with the baptism that i
[21:01] am baptized with
[21:07] well i need i need uh brother brandon if
[21:09] he can come up at this time he's been
[21:11] given a cup to drink from
[21:15] i i believe he's the assistant pastor
[21:17] here so he's going to assist this
[21:18] morning
[21:20] now i want you to watch carefully this
[21:21] is very very tricky stuff
[21:25] very tricky and very dangerous
[21:28] but here's a storm brother okay
[21:30] and it's been made just for you
[21:33] because we love you
[21:35] appreciate you
[21:37] now careful

[21:53] oh thank you very much well done brother
[21:55] good job brother all right thank you
[21:56] very much
[22:01] brother brandon was invited this morning
[22:04] to bring his cup
[22:06] something
[22:08] that he had to drink from
[22:10] and the storm was poured into his cup
[22:13] and our brother drank the cup
[22:15] and uh how are you feeling brother
[22:18] feeling okay
[22:19] okay that was just water just in case
[22:21] anybody's wondering
[22:24] but i think our brother looks pretty
[22:26] good still we'll we'll take a we'll
[22:28] check on him in another 10 minutes right
[22:30] we've got our brother deacon brother dan
[22:32] over there brother paul just keep an eye
[22:34] on her brother make sure he's doing okay
[22:35] but he looks he's smiling i mean he
[22:37] looks happy
[22:39] right and this is really how simple this
[22:41] drinking from the cup is
[22:43] i want you to notice something if i can
[22:45] just put it like this this this storm in
[22:47] the teacup is an expression where we
[22:50] make something bigger than what it
[22:51] really is
[22:53] we make it so much bigger we we see a
[22:55] storm like it's out there
[22:57] right and it's great thundering and you
[23:00] know in south africa man we used to get
[23:02] some awesome thunderstorms you know it
[23:04] would shake the very ground you know i
[23:06] mean but it's out there and you feel so
[23:08] fragile in a storm right you feel so
[23:11] like insignificant so tiny and you see
[23:14] those ships that get rocked in in the
[23:16] big waves and you know the storm we
[23:18] always put storms all the way around us
[23:20] but the storms god gives us he puts in a
[23:23] cup
[23:25] and it's for us to have a different
[23:27] impression different perspective on the
[23:29] storms god has allotted to us the the
[23:32] cup that he's asked us to drink from
[23:34] it's not all out there and and
[23:36] unreachable and and unattainable it's
[23:38] not like that it's poured into a cup
[23:41] now i didn't see our brother brandon
[23:43] when he when he was drinking from that
[23:45] cup he didn't look like he was
[23:46] struggling very much i mean that looked
[23:48] really easy
[23:49] in other words all the strength he
[23:51] needed to drink that cup
[23:54] was already in him
[23:56] i didn't touch him right brother brandon
[23:58] no there was no tricks here right
[24:00] i'm just showing you how simple this is
[24:02] it's not very deep just follow me this
[24:04] morning right but all the strength he
[24:06] had needed off he had complete control
[24:10] over that storm he had complete
[24:13] say
[24:14] it was his decision he he had complete
[24:17] power over everything in that cup
[24:21] he lifted that cup to his own lips he
[24:23] drank from he consumed everything that
[24:26] was in that cup
[24:27] he had the strength to do that
[24:30] and that is what god has done for us
[24:31] greater is he that is in us than he is
[24:34] in the world you have the strength to
[24:36] overcome
[24:38] you have the power you can say this
[24:39] morning lord this storm looked so big
[24:42] before i came to church this morning
[24:43] this looks so impossible but lord i see
[24:45] now that you've poured it into a cup for
[24:47] me and i can consume the storm
[24:53] you have the power to overcome
[24:56] everything you have need of is already
[24:58] inside of you you don't have to fear for
[25:01] nothing
[25:03] amen it's just every time when a trial
[25:05] comes and where you see a storm arise in
[25:07] your life remember that kappa brother
[25:09] brandon
[25:10] lifted this morning
[25:12] it was easy it really was
[25:17] that's why we can rejoice in our trials
[25:20] we can triumph
[25:21] because god has given us the strength to
[25:24] overcome
[25:26] amen thank god for his great grace amen
[25:29] the difference in the storm in the
[25:30] storms that we face is god puts them in
[25:32] a cup
[25:33] they are catered for our needs to bring
[25:36] something out out that is in us god's
[25:38] showing the value or the strength he has
[25:40] placed in us in our weaknesses he is
[25:43] made strong
[25:45] amen
[25:46] now let's look at the commission here
[25:48] that god gave us you'll find this once
[25:50] you start understanding this principle
[25:52] you're going to find it all throughout
[25:53] the scriptures
[25:56] mark 16 and 18 tells us in our
[25:58] commission he says they shall take up
[26:00] serpents and if they drink any deadly
[26:02] thing it shall not hurt them they shall
[26:04] lay hands on the sick they shall recover
[26:07] this is part of our promise if you drink
[26:09] any deadly thing it can't hurt you
[26:13] amen
[26:14] praise the lord amen that word drink
[26:17] there it means to absorb
[26:21] to receive to to to absorb
[26:24] to become part of
[26:26] anything you absorb
[26:29] you think of their thoughts or anything
[26:31] like that or things that have happened
[26:33] in your life the things that you absorb
[26:37] it can't hurt you
[26:40] that is even in ideas or concepts or
[26:42] knowledge
[26:43] things that you have taken on that that
[26:45] may affect your mind that may cause
[26:47] doubt or or may do something to alter
[26:50] your opinion or things like that all
[26:51] those things you have absorbed
[26:53] it can't hurt you
[26:55] if you recognize what's inside of you
[26:58] you know some people will make an excuse
[27:00] and say well my family is this way so so
[27:02] i can be this way you know my there's an
[27:04] anger problem in my family so you know i
[27:06] just inherited that so i'm just gonna
[27:08] you know this is the new norm for me i'm
[27:10] sorry you're a new creature in christ
[27:12] jesus he's made all things new amen
[27:16] okay
[27:18] amen
[27:19] we have been called to drink of the cup
[27:20] we are made for this very moment in time
[27:25] we were placed here specifically because
[27:27] of the challenges that are here god has
[27:29] raised up a standard
[27:31] and it's in you
[27:33] god has provided the strength that we
[27:35] may drink and overcome and consume the
[27:37] storm of our day even death
[27:42] when the floods arise god raises the
[27:44] standard
[27:45] the bible tells us in isaiah 59 and 19
[27:48] so shall they fear the name of the lord
[27:50] from the west and his glory from the
[27:52] rising of the sun when the enemy shall
[27:54] come in like a flood the spirit of the
[27:56] lord shall lift up a standard against
[27:59] him
[28:00] amen don't fear the floods my brother
[28:02] and sister wasn't it jesus christ who
[28:04] walked on the water
[28:06] think of it this morning you know we we
[28:08] need to start reading our bibles amen
[28:10] the one that walked on waters is here
[28:12] with us we don't have to fear floods
[28:17] psalms 93 and 1.
[28:19] just give you some scriptures here
[28:21] you can take home with you
[28:23] the lord reigneth he is clothed with
[28:25] majesty the lord is clothed with
[28:28] strength
[28:29] wherewith he hath girded himself the
[28:31] world also established
[28:33] that it cannot be moved
[28:36] he says my throne is established of all
[28:38] thou art from everlasting
[28:41] the floods have lifted up o lord the
[28:43] floods have lifted up their voice the
[28:45] floods lift up their waves the lord on
[28:47] high is mightier than the noise of many
[28:51] waters yea
[28:52] then the mighty waves of the sea
[28:58] psalms 107 28 then they cry unto the
[29:01] lord in their trouble and he bringeth
[29:03] them out of their distresses he maketh
[29:06] the storm a calm
[29:09] so that the waves thereof are still.
[29:15] then are
[29:17] they glad because they be quiet so he
[29:20] bringeth them unto their desired haven
[29:24] he brings us he doesn't just take care
[29:26] of the storm but he takes us all the way
[29:28] to the destination
[29:29] brings us to their desired haven
[29:34] oh there's some good scriptures here
[29:36] the lord is good a stronghold in the day
[29:39] of trouble and he knoweth them that
[29:41] trust in him
[29:42] here's another one the lord shall fight
[29:44] for you and he shall hold your peace
[29:50] and the lord he it is that doth go
[29:52] before thee he will be with thee he will
[29:55] not fail thee
[29:57] neither for safety fear not neither be
[30:00] dismayed
[30:04] we are troubled on every side yet not
[30:06] distressed we are perplexed but not in
[30:08] despair
[30:10] persecuted but not forsaken cast down
[30:13] but not destroyed
[30:14] always bearing about in the body the
[30:16] dying of the lord jesus that the life
[30:18] also of jesus might be made manifest in
[30:22] our body
[30:25] paul had a great attitude when it came
[30:27] to these things
[30:30] in labors you said i was more abundant
[30:32] in stripes above measure
[30:34] in prisons more frequent i think he knew
[30:37] something about storms
[30:39] in deaths often
[30:42] of the jews five times received i 40
[30:45] stripes save one
[30:46] thrice was i beaten with rods once was i
[30:49] stoned thrice i suffered a shipwreck
[30:52] a night and a day have i slept in the
[30:54] deep
[30:55] in journeyings often in perils of waters
[30:58] in perils of robbers in perils by my own
[31:01] countrymen
[31:03] in perils by the heathen in perils in
[31:05] the city in perils in the wilderness in
[31:08] perils in the sea
[31:09] in perils among false brethren
[31:12] in weariness and painfulness in
[31:15] watchings often in hunger and thirst in
[31:19] fastings often in cold and nakedness
[31:23] in the care of all the churches
[31:26] he says but if i needs to glory
[31:29] i will glory in the things
[31:31] that which concern mine infirmities
[31:38] what is god trying to tell us today
[31:41] greater is he that is in you
[31:43] than he that is in the world
[31:45] who is in you this morning it's the same
[31:48] one that created the heavens and the
[31:50] earth
[31:52] the bible says teaching them to observe
[31:54] all things
[31:56] whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i
[31:58] am with you always even unto the end of
[32:00] the world amen prophet says in the
[32:02] message he that is in you
[32:05] he says then if he is in you it's not
[32:07] you any more living it's him living in
[32:10] you
[32:11] see it's not your thinking what you
[32:13] think about it it's what he said about
[32:16] this
[32:17] now we've read some scriptures but there
[32:19] are hundreds of scriptures pertaining to
[32:21] you
[32:25] the winds now remember god created the
[32:27] winds it's air god created the waves
[32:30] it's water
[32:32] he made all these things
[32:34] amen he knows all about the the water
[32:36] and the winds and all these things he's
[32:37] made them
[32:40] he says but now that was the devil that
[32:42] got into the winds that sent that storm
[32:46] but it notices here he says couldn't the
[32:48] creator that created the wind say go
[32:50] back there where i created you
[32:55] so god created all these things
[32:56] everything we see around us is is
[32:58] because of god because of the word of
[33:00] god
[33:01] amen the worlds were framed by the word
[33:03] of god
[33:04] right everything we see out there is a
[33:05] testimony of its creator you see it's
[33:08] god's signature on everything amen but
[33:11] then the devil gets involved right he
[33:13] likes to he comes and he perverts he he
[33:15] can't
[33:16] create anything but he'll use what god
[33:18] has created and he'll get in there and
[33:19] pervert it and change it up but remember
[33:21] can't doesn't the creator of those
[33:24] things stand more powerful than than the
[33:26] devil
[33:28] can't he tell what he has created to go
[33:30] back to its original condition
[33:32] that's what he's saying here
[33:36] greater is he
[33:38] just carrying on in the quote here
[33:40] greater is he
[33:41] it's god the creator the winds and the
[33:43] waves have to obey him demons become
[33:46] paralyzed all nature obey him because he
[33:49] was the creator of nature oh when when
[33:52] we think of that he says it takes the
[33:54] bite out of it see then we understand
[33:57] these things you see what is it it isn't
[33:58] man
[33:59] man cannot do that man is part of the
[34:01] creation see but it's the winds and the
[34:03] waves that obey the creator see
[34:06] he says
[34:08] he that's in you
[34:10] is the creator who made the winds he can
[34:13] rebuke the devil out of the winds and
[34:15] there is a calm
[34:17] he can rebuke the devil out of the storm
[34:19] and there's no storm he's the creator
[34:22] and greater is he that's in you than he
[34:24] that is in the world
[34:27] starting to get a picture here of
[34:29] what's inside of us
[34:31] what you carry with you through your
[34:32] trials
[34:36] greater is he that is that wasn't joshua
[34:38] than the son
[34:42] joshua was a man
[34:44] sin born like you and i and greater was
[34:47] he that was in joshua and in the sun
[34:50] that was running by the commandment of
[34:52] god
[34:53] that is a striking thing my brother and
[34:55] sister
[34:58] god commanded
[35:01] that sun to shine and turn itself around
[35:04] and it's governed and controlled by the
[35:06] laws of god
[35:09] but greater was he that was in joshua
[35:12] than the laws of god was
[35:15] because the creator himself was in
[35:18] joshua
[35:20] that's powerful
[35:22] when joshua looked up to the sun and he
[35:23] said
[35:24] you stand there where you are at
[35:27] and moon you hang there where you are at
[35:30] till i finish this battle
[35:32] and the sun and the moon obeyed him for
[35:35] he that was in joshua was greater than
[35:37] the sun and the moon he that was in
[35:40] joshua
[35:42] what about god in the bride at the end
[35:44] time
[35:45] amen my brother and sister don't
[35:47] underestimate who you are and what's
[35:49] inside of you greater is he that's in
[35:50] you
[35:51] it doesn't matter you know sometimes we
[35:53] have this little box of you know of of
[35:56] how we try to put god you know in this
[35:58] little category and we try to put
[36:00] ourselves in a category of trying to be
[36:01] humble and timid and the meek you know
[36:04] and that kind of
[36:05] approach and and we're careful you know
[36:07] because if we pray for something maybe
[36:09] it's not the will of god or my brother
[36:11] and sister we don't have to be timid
[36:12] like that if you feel inspired and god's
[36:15] moving on your heart and you are facing
[36:17] a storm just speak the word of god
[36:20] speak the word and go forth the creator
[36:22] is living inside of you
[36:28] we don't have to be afraid anymore
[36:33] he's not giving us a spirit of fear but
[36:38] sound mind
[36:39] sober sound mind what does the bible
[36:41] tell us that it's given us a
[36:43] mind for life and peace
[36:46] amen
[36:48] he that was in moses was greater than
[36:51] all of egypt
[36:53] hmm
[36:54] he that is in
[36:56] you is greater than all of the united
[36:58] states
[37:01] greater is he that was in daniel than he
[37:04] than than the lions
[37:06] greater is he that was in david than
[37:09] the bear that stole his sheep
[37:11] greater is he that was in david than the
[37:13] lion that came in and took one of his
[37:15] lambs greater is he that was in david
[37:17] than the enemy goliath
[37:21] we can go through a lot of bible
[37:22] characters today
[37:24] i think we get the point
[37:26] but the thing to this morning is what
[37:29] about you
[37:30] greater is he that is in you than he
[37:32] that is in your trial
[37:34] then your sickness then your temptations
[37:37] in your habits
[37:39] in your complexes
[37:41] then your hardship
[37:42] then your loneliness
[37:44] greater is he that is in you
[37:51] greater is he that is in you than that
[37:53] wheelchair greater is he that is in you
[37:55] than that stretcher greater is he
[37:58] that's in you than that cancer
[38:01] greater is he that is in you
[38:03] then that affliction greater is he than
[38:05] anything that there is the devil could
[38:07] put on you
[38:08] greater is he that is in you than he
[38:10] that's in the world greater is he yes
[38:14] amen
[38:17] he is in us that's the christ he was the
[38:20] conqueror of every enemy for us when he
[38:22] was here on earth he conquered sin he
[38:24] conquered sickness he conquered death he
[38:27] conquered hell he conquered the grave
[38:29] and now he lives in us as the conqueror
[38:33] the champion the conqueror my brother
[38:35] and sister is living inside of us and do
[38:37] you think there's anything new for him
[38:39] he knows how to defeat that devil
[38:41] amen he's the same yesterday today and
[38:43] forever he's not afraid to be hung on a
[38:46] cross
[38:47] to take the stinger of death into him he
[38:49] knows what he's made of
[38:52] he's living in us today
[38:58] if christ lives in you
[39:00] will we not do the same things as he did
[39:04] like the nature of an artist amen
[39:10] john 14 12 just as a reminder he that
[39:12] believeth on me the works that i do
[39:14] shall he do also
[39:16] and greater works than these shall he do
[39:18] because i go unto my
[39:27] the father that's living inside of us is
[39:29] the same one that drank the full wrath
[39:31] of god
[39:34] and remember when he was drinking from
[39:35] that cup it was also a great storm there
[39:37] was an earthquake that took place
[39:40] on a cross
[39:42] jesus is the calmer of the storms
[39:45] he's not afraid of the storms
[39:47] amen
[39:49] that same one lives in you this morning
[39:52] i guess this afternoon
[39:54] i'm just getting warmed up i just woke
[39:55] up about three hours ago amen
[39:59] mark 4 and 37 says and there arose a
[40:01] great storm of wind
[40:03] and the waves beat into the ship so that
[40:06] it was now full
[40:07] and he arose and rebuked the wind and
[40:10] said unto the sea peace be still
[40:14] and the wind ceased and there was a
[40:16] great calm
[40:18] i always found that interesting that it
[40:20] wasn't just a calm but when god does
[40:22] something it's not just a calm he's not
[40:24] just going to take care of his situation
[40:26] he's going to do something great
[40:28] it was a great calm that took place
[40:32] something special happened
[40:34] so much so that the scribe that wrote
[40:35] this my brother and sister he made sure
[40:38] to note he was a great calm
[40:47] sorry
[40:48] and he said unto them why are you so
[40:50] fearful how is it that you have no faith
[40:54] and they feared exceedingly and said one
[40:56] to another what matter of man is this
[40:59] that even the wind and the sea obey
[41:02] what manner of man is this
[41:06] what manner of god what manner of of a
[41:09] holy spirit do we have
[41:11] that even the nature you know nature is
[41:14] waiting for us
[41:15] nature is groaning and and travailing
[41:19] it's an it's in such great anticipation
[41:22] that it's it's breaking forth and it's
[41:24] in pain have you ever desired something
[41:26] that much
[41:27] we had a couple's uh banquet last night
[41:29] you desire to to be with your your
[41:32] spouse you know there's a there's a
[41:33] hunger there's a there's a pain
[41:36] maybe it's just me
[41:38] right
[41:39] but there's a desire that needs to be
[41:42] filled and earth is waiting for the
[41:44] manifestation of the sons of
[41:46] god it's waiting on you
[41:55] how many points do you think that those
[41:57] disciples got for worrying about the
[41:59] storm
[42:02] you know
[42:04] how many you know if they had to have a
[42:05] little meeting in the boat
[42:07] and say you know the storm is this big
[42:08] or or it's a category this or whatever
[42:12] you know we're getting coming up with
[42:13] some pretty fancy words up there in
[42:14] vancouver now for storms we've had some
[42:17] very interesting weather
[42:19] and now they don't just call it rain
[42:21] anymore it's called an atmospheric river
[42:24] right
[42:26] i mean do we get any points for that
[42:27] it's just rain
[42:30] right but this is what it's coming to
[42:32] right we we can take science and we can
[42:34] analyze it and we can look at churches
[42:36] and we analyze or criticize or we look
[42:38] at families and analyze and criticize or
[42:41] we look at individuals we analyze and we
[42:43] criticize it and we need to be careful
[42:45] because all that is is a distraction
[42:48] because when jesus comes on the scene
[42:49] he's not looking at any of the little
[42:51] pointers you want to give to how great
[42:53] the storm is or or how smart the devil
[42:56] has become or you know how bad this
[42:58] individual is he's not looking at any of
[43:00] that
[43:01] amen he's there for your benefit he
[43:03] wants to show you something
[43:05] he's not looking at the storms he made
[43:07] those things
[43:08] he's holding the cup in his hand
[43:13] praise the lord
[43:15] you know god has a way of
[43:17] comforting people
[43:19] you believe that
[43:21] we go through trials and we go through
[43:23] things in our lives and god knows how to
[43:25] how to come by and get your attention
[43:27] let you know i'm with you
[43:29] it's going to be okay
[43:31] it's going to work out
[43:34] i know i've needed that
[43:35] amen he just knows how to speak you know
[43:38] something will happen and or the dates
[43:40] or something lines up or you know
[43:42] somebody calls you or says something you
[43:44] know those things mean a lot
[43:48] god has a way of comforting his people i
[43:50] think
[43:51] when we look at the prophet's life
[43:53] brother branham
[43:54] look at the challenges he faced the
[43:56] storms that he faced
[43:59] the issues the the the people and the
[44:02] questions and you know all the things
[44:04] that he faced in his day
[44:06] you know
[44:08] look at how god tended to him
[44:11] in his storm i want to show you
[44:13] something because i believe that god
[44:14] allowed him to go through things for our
[44:16] example so we can see who's on the scene
[44:19] for the bride
[44:20] who's here for you and i
[44:25] look at this here i want to just kind of
[44:27] change the
[44:28] the direction here a little bit and just
[44:30] show you how god comes on the scene
[44:32] during in the middle of a storm and i
[44:34] want you to ask yourself the question as
[44:35] we go through this little story
[44:37] ask yourself the question do you think
[44:39] brother branham would ever regretted
[44:42] that moment in his life do you think he
[44:45] would trade the storm with anything in
[44:48] his life
[44:51] watch this here
[44:52] think about your storm are you willing
[44:54] to
[44:55] forego that cup
[44:58] he knows
[45:00] about the things brother branham was
[45:02] going through he knew what was in the
[45:04] heart of brother branham
[45:06] and i want you to look at the detail in
[45:08] which he takes care of of this with
[45:10] brother branham in this message
[45:13] he that is in you i think it's
[45:15] appropriate even the message title he
[45:17] that is in you 1963
[45:20] at the end of the year
[45:22] brother branham in the beginning of the
[45:23] service he's dedicating two kids
[45:27] now he's had some incredible storms in
[45:29] his life you know what happened early on
[45:31] in his life and so forth and god was
[45:34] gently trying to comfort him
[45:36] trying to lift him up a little bit
[45:39] and in this dedication there's this one
[45:40] boy and then a girl
[45:43] look at this here he says
[45:45] my here's the first one i'm quoting
[45:47] right from the from the message here
[45:49] my here's the first one a little pair of
[45:51] brown eyes looking at me
[45:53] with a big cute smile now remember i
[45:55] want you i want you to put yourself in
[45:56] the scene
[45:57] he's going through tremendous trials
[46:01] tremendous storms and all kinds of
[46:03] things and here he is just a regular
[46:05] sunday service whatever the service was
[46:07] an evening service
[46:10] and and he's got and he's got to preach
[46:12] the word and he's going to preach on the
[46:13] subject he that is in you and and watch
[46:16] what god is doing in the middle of all
[46:18] of this god is orchestrating something
[46:23] this brown little eye is looking at me a
[46:25] big cute smile a little girl he says
[46:28] what's her name the mother says that
[46:30] sharon
[46:31] rose
[46:32] sharon rose
[46:34] god is doing something for this man
[46:37] he knows about the storm he knows about
[46:39] the questions he knows about the the
[46:41] things he has dealt with in his life and
[46:44] here he's dedicating this little girl
[46:45] and the mother says it's sharon rose
[46:47] sharon rose he says sharon rose that's a
[46:50] great name to me
[46:52] we named her brother branham after your
[46:56] child
[46:59] after my little girl that's gone on
[47:01] we named her before she was even born
[47:04] brother branham we named it before she
[47:06] was born
[47:08] if it had to be a little girl he was
[47:10] going to we was he was going to name it
[47:12] sharon rose we were sure she was going
[47:14] to be a girl she had to be
[47:17] prophet says had to be
[47:18] she's sharon rose goodman
[47:22] you know what i don't know
[47:25] that you know it or not
[47:27] if my wife was standing here she would
[47:30] probably almost faint
[47:32] this is the same kind of dress that my
[47:34] little girl had at the
[47:36] dedication little sharon rose this one
[47:40] maybe maybe
[47:41] may this one live where god has taken
[47:44] mine
[47:46] you know my little sharon rose looked
[47:48] just like that i guess there's anybody
[47:51] here remembers her by how she looked she
[47:53] had little brown eyes like that like her
[47:56] mother real sweet little girl with dark
[47:58] hair
[47:59] he says dear god as i hold this little
[48:01] treasure a little sharon rose you know
[48:03] in my heart lord what i'm thinking
[48:06] so i don't have to express it
[48:10] he recognized god was doing something
[48:12] you remember the service says he that is
[48:14] in you
[48:17] you know my heart lord i don't even have
[48:19] to say it lord i know you know about me
[48:21] this morning
[48:23] you're speaking write to me lord i'm
[48:25] listening i hear you
[48:28] in the middle of this trial
[48:35] how do you do brother he says
[48:38] let's see
[48:39] arnett the father says yes arnot
[48:42] arnett that's right
[48:43] he says we named our boy after you is
[48:46] that right
[48:47] william
[48:48] william arnett james william arnett
[48:51] that's a fine boy
[48:54] then he starts into the sermon at about
[48:57] paragraph 86 you can go read this
[48:59] whole message
[49:00] if you like
[49:02] he says well i said to the brother and
[49:04] that morning he was he was
[49:06] hunting and so forth he says now the
[49:08] first drop of rain starts to fall the
[49:10] first snow the first sleet anything take
[49:13] for the camp just as hard as you can
[49:15] because within 15 minutes you can see
[49:18] you can't see your hand before you and
[49:20] it will just twist and blow and i don't
[49:23] care how well you know the country he
[49:25] says you're going to stay right there
[49:27] and you'll perish he says because
[49:29] sometimes you can't even breathe the
[49:31] sleep is blowing so and you would die
[49:34] right there so here they're in the
[49:36] mountains and and he's warning these
[49:38] brothers when the storm comes get out of
[49:40] here okay he's a woodsman he knows what
[49:42] he's talking about he knows these places
[49:45] and he knows that when this storm comes
[49:47] you won't survive it
[49:50] they're anticipating a storm
[49:54] sure enough the forecast
[49:56] forecasted storm arrives
[49:59] he couldn't even see the bottom
[50:01] of the mountain anymore he couldn't see
[50:04] any more from where he was sitting he
[50:05] said and then he goes on and talks about
[50:07] there it was that blizzard that has been
[50:10] forecasted
[50:11] the storm that you knew was coming
[50:14] it was there
[50:16] now in his mind he knows he needs to get
[50:18] out of there because
[50:20] if he stayed there he would die
[50:23] you see sometimes storm comes where we
[50:25] know we feel get this feeling in our
[50:27] heart lord i can't handle this
[50:30] i can't take this
[50:32] this is bigger than me
[50:39] so what does he do he starts making his
[50:40] way back to camp he knows what to do
[50:43] now i want you to watch something
[50:45] remember god has a cup allotted to each
[50:49] and every one of us
[50:51] and remember what i said in the
[50:52] beginning there's a blessing
[50:54] in that cup
[50:56] sometimes all we see is is just the
[50:58] storm
[50:59] but there's something there god wants to
[51:01] reveal something in us
[51:03] and if and if we
[51:05] excuse ourselves from drinking that cup
[51:07] you'll never see what that blessing was
[51:11] watch what happens here now
[51:16] it says and so
[51:22] then i started down he's making his way
[51:24] away from the storm and i got about
[51:26] halfway down there and something said to
[51:27] me just as plain as you hear me
[51:30] stop
[51:31] and go back
[51:34] i want you to think of those words
[51:35] here's a woodsman
[51:37] well acquainted with the mountains he
[51:38] knows what that storm he's already told
[51:40] his other brothers don't stay here
[51:42] because you'll die
[51:43] now a voice comes to him
[51:46] sometimes we feel like god does this to
[51:48] us
[51:49] why am i so special why do i have to go
[51:51] through this can't you pick on somebody
[51:53] else
[51:54] but he what is he doing god is giving an
[51:56] invitation to brother branham
[51:59] an invitation stop
[52:01] stop what you're doing and go back
[52:03] go back where to the storm
[52:06] that storm that you know that if you go
[52:08] in there you're gonna die but i'm giving
[52:10] you an invitation now don't ask me to
[52:12] explain that my brother and sister but
[52:14] god wants to reveal something that's in
[52:16] brother branham he wants to show him
[52:18] something
[52:20] stop and go back don't fear the storm
[52:23] don't worry about those things i'll i'll
[52:24] be with you
[52:26] i will fight your battles for you
[52:28] turn around and go back
[52:35] he says go back through that storm
[52:38] half mile or more back up the mountain
[52:40] into that dark place
[52:42] that dark timber forest
[52:45] when he can hardly see
[52:47] as far as that organ is
[52:50] what an invitation
[52:53] how many of us would accept an
[52:55] invitation like that you know it's easy
[52:57] to accept an invitation to a wedding or
[52:59] something like that but can you imagine
[53:00] an invitation like this
[53:02] i have a cup for you to drink from maybe
[53:05] you'll wake up tomorrow morning
[53:07] and god has got a cup waiting for you to
[53:09] drink from
[53:11] it's an invitation my brother and sister
[53:16] don't fear it
[53:19] you know that's why we don't have to
[53:20] fear a doctor's diagnosis
[53:22] we don't have to fear these things my
[53:24] brother and sister it's an invitation
[53:26] from god
[53:32] he says but i'm
[53:34] he says i'm getting old now i've been a
[53:36] christian for 33 years and i know that
[53:38] no matter what how ridiculous it might
[53:40] seem
[53:41] mind the lord do what the lord says
[53:44] so he goes up he says
[53:47] i was the one who made the winds this is
[53:49] god speaking to brother branham now he
[53:51] says i'm the one who made the winds to
[53:53] cease upon the sea
[53:54] i was the one who made the waves to go
[53:57] down i created the heavens and the earth
[54:00] was i not the one that told you to speak
[54:02] to those squirrels
[54:05] and they come into existence he says i
[54:07] am god
[54:10] he said speak to those winds and that
[54:12] storm and it will go away now the bible
[54:14] lays before me which i lay where which
[54:16] my life is in that he says i raised up i
[54:19] said i do not doubt your voice lord
[54:22] i said clouds and snow and rain and
[54:24] sleet i resent your coming in the name
[54:28] of jesus christ go to your places i say
[54:30] that the sun must come out come
[54:32] immediately and shine for four days till
[54:35] our hunting trip is over and i leave
[54:37] with my brethren
[54:39] and you know the rest it happened
[54:40] exactly that way
[54:43] now you might say that's amazing what a
[54:44] beautiful testimony
[54:47] there's more
[54:49] okay there's more because sometimes we
[54:50] look at the signs and we go wow that was
[54:52] amazing and we stopped there
[54:54] okay but there's more to this
[54:58] what was happening watch
[55:00] this is now after the storm remember now
[55:02] he has consumed the storm
[55:05] now just what just right after this now
[55:07] watch what happens here he says i
[55:08] thought
[55:10] the very god of creation
[55:12] it's all in his hands what is he telling
[55:15] me
[55:16] this is really what i want to drive home
[55:18] today
[55:19] what is god telling me
[55:25] he says i picked up my gun i wiped off
[55:27] the scope started to walk back and go
[55:29] down the hill and something said to me
[55:31] why don't you stroll with me through the
[55:33] wilderness
[55:35] walk with me
[55:37] i said yes lord with all my heart it
[55:39] would be one of the greatest things i
[55:41] could do
[55:42] was walk with you so i put my gun over
[55:44] my shoulder
[55:47] you know enoch walked with god like that
[55:49] once
[55:51] it's the same invitation to us today
[55:53] an invitation to walk with him
[55:58] now watch he keeps walking with god and
[56:00] he speaks about the place where he would
[56:02] remember meda and their wedding
[56:04] anniversary on the mountain there
[56:05] thought of how old he was getting and
[56:07] you know he was just talking back and
[56:09] forth with the lord kind of reminiscing
[56:10] over his life and the things the lord
[56:12] has done for him
[56:14] and he says and so as i went along like
[56:17] that
[56:18] something took place
[56:20] all of a sudden in every motion
[56:22] principle i was a boy
[56:26] i thought as a boy
[56:28] what was happening
[56:31] i want you to really
[56:33] pay attention what's happening here
[56:36] because one day it's going to happen to
[56:38] us
[56:41] after the storm is over there's a
[56:43] communion that takes place
[56:46] and we can't
[56:48] we can't have one without the other
[56:54] he was going young
[56:57] like almost a body change
[57:00] and i had my head down and i looked up
[57:02] and just as plain as i ever saw her
[57:03] there she stood before me with her arms
[57:06] out and i stopped rubbed my face i
[57:08] looked and i said mita is that you honey
[57:12] i looked here i thought what now what
[57:14] has happened and i thought
[57:16] oh yes i'm walking with him
[57:19] and it changed then and i was back an
[57:20] old man again and the vision was gone
[57:23] from front of me
[57:25] then he sees those three deers now it
[57:27] keeps moving along the story it's
[57:29] beautiful he says then he sees those
[57:31] three deer and and he doesn't shoot them
[57:33] because remember he made a promise to
[57:35] god
[57:38] he says i wipe my face like that and
[57:40] just then something happened a voice
[57:41] spoke out just as clear right out of
[57:43] them blue skies not a cloud it's all
[57:45] been within just a little bit of time
[57:48] and a voice spoke out and said
[57:50] you remembered your promise didn't you
[57:54] i said yes lord he said i'll remember
[57:56] mine too
[57:57] i'll never leave you
[57:59] nor forsake you
[58:02] the burden then left my heart and it
[58:04] hasn't been there ever since may it
[58:06] never
[58:07] be again
[58:09] does the lord know how to
[58:11] move
[58:12] on our situation
[58:14] let us know that he loves us
[58:16] he's with us in our storms
[58:19] and i think if brother branham
[58:21] you think of the option he had there to
[58:23] to either go back up that hill into the
[58:25] storm or just keep going down the hill
[58:29] he had a decision to make
[58:32] will you drink from this cup
[58:35] there's something that was waiting for
[58:36] brother branham on the other side of
[58:38] that storm
[58:39] and he wouldn't have gotten there i
[58:41] don't think
[58:42] if he didn't go through the storm
[58:45] why not walk with me
[58:47] through this wilderness you know i would
[58:50] give anything to hear that
[58:53] but am i willing to drink from the cup
[58:56] that's really the question
[58:59] so the trials that we're looking at and
[59:01] the things we face in our lives my
[59:02] brother and sister it's just a storm in
[59:04] a teacup
[59:07] it's so little it's it's so small
[59:10] compared to what happens right after
[59:14] i want to walk with him
[59:18] i want to talk with him
[59:21] i want to hear him say well done my good
[59:23] and faithful servant
[59:25] but we have to be willing to drink
[59:28] now i want to just say again we don't
[59:30] have to fear the cup
[59:32] we don't have to fear those things
[59:36] because greater is he that is in you
[59:38] than he that is in the world i'm closing
[59:47] after the story brother branham goes
[59:49] into his sermon
[59:51] he that is in you
[59:53] what a setting for a sermon
[59:55] what an understanding of who god was to
[59:58] him the relationship that brother
[1:00:00] branham had with jesus christ
[1:00:03] we have the same thing
[1:00:05] you know we look at the prophet's life
[1:00:07] and we go wow that's amazing he's the
[1:00:09] first fruits of what we have yes
[1:00:12] we have that each and every one of you i
[1:00:13] don't care how old or how young
[1:00:15] you are this morning my brother sister
[1:00:17] if you've been baptized you've seen the
[1:00:19] holy ghost in your life been sealed
[1:00:22] guess what greater is he that is in you
[1:00:24] and he that is in the world
[1:00:28] um
[1:00:31] musicians can come i'm i'm finished
[1:00:34] the mighty conquerors living within us
[1:00:37] today
[1:00:38] i want you to take courage as you as as
[1:00:41] we change the order of the service and

[1:00:48] your hand on my shoulder
[1:00:50] and then give me an invitation
[1:00:52] like he gave to brother brennan
[1:00:55] i want to walk with you in this
[1:00:57] wilderness i want to talk with you i
[1:00:58] want to sit with you for a little while
[1:01:02] i want you to take me beyond the veil
[1:01:04] where i see myself young
[1:01:06] with my wife and my family take me into
[1:01:09] those heavenly places show me the the
[1:01:11] blessings that we have in heavenly
[1:01:13] places in christ jesus take me beyond
[1:01:15] this fleshly elements just for a moment
[1:01:18] oh god
[1:01:19] and encourage me and strengthen me for
[1:01:21] this journey
[1:01:26] so i asked again this afternoon
[1:01:29] are you willing to drink from your cup
[1:01:32] if god came here today and he could
[1:01:34] visibly give you and hand you a cup each
[1:01:36] and every one of you and you could see
[1:01:38] the trial that was laying in there
[1:01:41] you might not know what the blessing is
[1:01:42] in that
[1:01:43] you might not know what's going to
[1:01:44] happen you don't know those things
[1:01:47] but you know that greater is he that is
[1:01:49] in you
[1:01:50] i don't have to fear this
[1:01:52] [Music]

[1:01:56] nothing impossible with with god
[1:02:00] by stripes we were healed
[1:02:02] amen there's so many blessings we could
[1:02:04] lay on the table today
[1:02:06] you don't have to fear what's in the cup
[1:02:10] we were made for such a time as this
[1:02:14] no one else is going to drink that cup
[1:02:16] you know there's a great cloud of
[1:02:17] witnesses watching and waiting
[1:02:20] watching us they can't drink our cup
[1:02:23] we have to drink it
[1:02:25] they've already drunk their cup
[1:02:28] they've done their part they're waiting
[1:02:30] for us they're cheering us on
[1:02:33] it's going to be all right
[1:02:35] it's worth it all
[1:02:39] amen
[1:02:40] i say this morning by just a confession
[1:02:43] of faith
[1:02:44] lord
[1:02:45] because of your grace because of your
[1:02:47] strength lord i will drink from my cup
[1:02:50] let me consume
[1:02:52] my cup
[1:02:54] because i see the other side of the
[1:02:56] journey i see the other side of that
[1:02:57] storm
[1:02:58] and it comes up over the hill just just
[1:03:01] in a little while we come up on the
[1:03:02] other side of the hill
[1:03:04] and we'll reach our destination we're
[1:03:05] coming to our haven of rest
[1:03:09] let's be willing let's be bold let's be
[1:03:12] strong
[1:03:13] don't fear what people say out there
[1:03:15] don't listen to the criticisms and
[1:03:18] and the naysayers my brothers and
[1:03:19] sisters is between you and god
[1:03:22] it's your cup to drink it's not their
[1:03:23] cup to drink
[1:03:25] they can say all they want but it's for
[1:03:27] you to drink because there's a blessing
[1:03:28] hiding in there
[1:03:30] the glory that will be revealed in us
[1:03:35] amen god bless you let's stand together
[1:03:38] as we turn it over to brother paul
[1:03:42] amen god bless you brother and sister
[1:03:43] have faith in god
[1:03:45] pressing the battle
[1:03:47] amen we love you keep us in your prayers
[1:03:49] and we'll be praying for you
[1:03:50] and i want to encourage you don't leave
[1:03:52] today unless you've sorted that out with
[1:03:54] god
[1:03:55] if you want to pray we can pray but i
[1:03:57] want to encourage you don't leave until
[1:03:59] you've settled that thing with god today
[1:04:01] say lord i have a storm in my life i
[1:04:03] have something i'm dealing with but lord
[1:04:05] with this understanding today lord i i
[1:04:08] know you're with me you're in this lord
[1:04:10] i'm not alone in this thing
[1:04:12] and i can handle this i'm strong enough
[1:04:15] because of your grace because of your
[1:04:16] strength
[1:04:18] even though i might feel weak
[1:04:20] you know it's amazing and i don't mean
[1:04:22] to keep you long but it's amazing you
[1:04:24] think of hannah
[1:04:26] the bible says that god shut up her womb
[1:04:29] and here hannah is thinking you know
[1:04:31] she's sad because she wants to give a
[1:04:33] son to her husband
[1:04:35] and she wants to do the things that are
[1:04:37] expected of her to do
[1:04:39] but the bible tells us that god shut up
[1:04:41] her womb
[1:04:43] so god knew what she was going through
[1:04:45] god had a purpose god had a reason he
[1:04:48] was creating a desire in her so that
[1:04:50] when she would come to the temple and
[1:04:53] cry out to god that there would be an
[1:04:54] extra portion given to her for her need
[1:04:58] you know the bible tells us she was
[1:04:59] given a double portion
[1:05:01] in her storm in her trial god gave her
[1:05:03] an extra portion to meet the need that
[1:05:05] she had
[1:05:07] and you know that that extra portion it
[1:05:09] literally signifies that that that high
[1:05:12] priest was giving her a meal for hannah
[1:05:15] and for the unborn child that she
[1:05:17] couldn't have
[1:05:18] [Music]
[1:05:20] god provided in her hour of me
[1:05:23] and there was something revealed and a
[1:05:24] great prophet samuel was birthed out of
[1:05:27] that storm
[1:05:29] what about your trial what about your
[1:05:30] situation can god not turn it around and
[1:05:33] and make it a great blessing a great
[1:05:35] triumph
[1:05:38] i want to say this morning i wouldn't
[1:05:39] trade any of my trials
[1:05:42] for anything
[1:05:43] i have no regrets my brother and sister
[1:05:46] no regrets for the things i face
[1:05:49] because i know him
[1:05:52] he's allowed me to walk with him
[1:05:54] [Music]
[1:05:56] and nothing nothing can ever satisfy
[1:05:59] them
[1:06:01] god bless you
[1:06:10] me
[1:06:13] [Music]
[1:06:24] behind
[1:06:28] we'll follow
[1:06:33] where
[1:06:34] he
[1:06:35] lives
[1:06:36] [Music]
[1:06:43] [Music]
[1:06:49] him
[1:06:52] with
[1:06:55] [Music]
[1:06:57] all the way
