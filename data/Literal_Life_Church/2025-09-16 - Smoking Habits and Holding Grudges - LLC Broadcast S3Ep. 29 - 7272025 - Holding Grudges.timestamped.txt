[0:00] Hello everyone. Pastor Paula Fontaine
[0:02] and Literal Life Church in Petersburg,
[0:04] Michigan would like to invite you to
[0:06] take the next half hour and enjoy some
[0:08] time in the word of God. If you're
[0:11] hungry for more God, we believe you can
[0:13] be fed. And we pray that you'll be
[0:16] blessed. Visit our website for more
[0:18] information at literalife.urch.
[0:21] May God bless you, my friend. May the
[0:23] music and message encourage you today.
[0:36] You made a covenant with me. Signed by
[0:40] the blood that still speaks. Now I'm
[0:43] forgi. I'm called righteous. I'm made
[0:47] clean. Thank you, Lord. There on the
[0:50] cross at Calvary,
[0:53] you gave it all to purchase me. You are
[0:57] the savior and the god who sets me free.
[1:03] Now my heart cries. This is my redeemer.
[1:10] with my whole life. I will give you
[1:15] praise,
[1:17] all the glory
[1:20] to the one who's worthy
[1:24] because of Jesus.
[1:27] I have been changed.
[1:35] You made a way for me to enter into your
[1:39] holy place forever. And now I'm hidden.
[1:43] I am covered. I found peace.
[1:48] And into your likeness, you transform
[1:51] me, making me holy like you're holy. No
[1:56] longer I live, but Christ who lives in
[2:00] me.
[2:03] Now my heart cries. This is my redeemer.
[2:10] And with my whole life I will give you
[2:15] praise.
[2:17] All the glory
[2:20] to the one who is worthy.
[2:24] Because of Jesus
[2:28] I have been changed.
[2:31] You will bring freedom to the captives
[2:36] and good news to the poor.
[2:40] Healing to the broken
[2:43] and joy to those you mourn. You turn
[2:47] ashes into beauty.
[2:50] The ruins you restore.
[2:53] I am a testimony
[2:56] of the goodness of the Lord. You bring
[3:01] freedom to the captives,
[3:04] good news to the poor,
[3:08] healing to the broken,
[3:11] and join the mine. You turn ashes into
[3:18] the ruins you.
[3:22] I am a testimony
[3:24] of the goodness of the Lord.
[3:30] Now my heart cries, this is my redeemer
[3:37] and with my heart
[3:40] I will give you praise
[3:45] all the glory
[3:48] to the one who
[3:52] because of Jesus
[3:55] I have been changed.
[3:59] Because of Jesus,
[4:02] I have been changed
[4:09] because of Jesus.
[4:14] I have been changed.
[4:22] &gt;&gt; Leviticus 19 and verse 17 and 18. If you
[4:25] read with me, thou shalt not hate thy
[4:29] brother in thine heart. Can you say
[4:32] amen?
[4:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:33] &gt;&gt; Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine
[4:35] heart. Where? In thine heart. Thou shalt
[4:38] in any wise rebuke thy neighbor and
[4:41] suffer and not suffer sin upon him. Thou
[4:45] shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge
[4:48] against the children of thy people. But
[4:51] thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
[4:53] I am the Lord. There's another scripture
[4:56] in Proverbs 19 I will add to this is if
[4:59] I get to it to refer to it but it also
[5:01] is related to this. Proverbs 19 and
[5:04] verse 11.
[5:06] The discretion of a man defereth his
[5:09] anger and it is his glory to pass over a
[5:15] transgression. I want you to notice here
[5:17] now we we have uh we have our
[5:20] interpretation of what the glory of the
[5:22] Lord is.
[5:23] &gt;&gt; And I believe we're experiencing the
[5:25] glory of the Lord in this place this
[5:27] morning.
[5:27] &gt;&gt; I believe the glory of the Lord can do
[5:30] many things to let us know his presence
[5:32] is here. But let us not limit the glory
[5:34] of the Lord because this man when he
[5:37] when he defers his anger and when he
[5:41] passes over a transgression then there's
[5:44] a glory in that as well.
[5:47] &gt;&gt; Don't limit the glory of God.
[5:49] &gt;&gt; So when this man forgives this when when
[5:52] this man releases and he passes over a
[5:55] transgression and he lets that anger
[5:57] flow away from his heart and his heart
[5:59] is clear. There is a glory of God in
[6:02] that.
[6:03] &gt;&gt; There's a glory of God in that.
[6:06] &gt;&gt; So this morning I I'd like to speak a
[6:08] little bit on and this is a strange
[6:09] title. Smoking habits and holding
[6:12] grudges.
[6:15] I figured I would get that response.
[6:17] Smoking habits and holding grudges. And
[6:19] you don't understand why my title is
[6:22] that, but you'll understand in just a
[6:24] minute. A few weeks ago, I read Markap
[6:26] 11. When I was reading Mark 11, which is
[6:30] a well-known scripture for the authority
[6:32] of the believer, uh most of you should
[6:34] know it. If you don't know it, it's
[6:35] where Jesus refers to mountain moving
[6:38] faith. And if you say to this mountain,
[6:40] be thou removed and cast into the sea,
[6:43] whatsoever things you desire in your
[6:44] heart, that which the father will give.
[6:47] And so, it's probably one of the most
[6:49] important scriptures. This is what the
[6:51] bride is entering into more and more.
[6:53] And that is that authority and faith to
[6:56] be able to say to this mountain, "Be
[6:58] thou removed." If you believe in your
[7:00] heart, can you say amen? And and the
[7:02] heart is right. Then we realize that it
[7:04] comes into this place of perfect faith.
[7:07] If ye say to this mountain and don't
[7:10] doubt in your heart, you you you you
[7:13] know this scripture well. You know this
[7:14] section of scripture well. Many
[7:16] preachers have preached on it and as
[7:18] they should preach on it because I
[7:20] believe this is something the bride more
[7:21] and more comes into. But what what
[7:23] amazed me is the attachment of the
[7:25] scriptures and the things Jesus said
[7:27] close to it. And you can't detach it,
[7:30] but he attached the importance of
[7:32] forgiveness right next to it. And when
[7:35] you stand praying, forgive.
[7:39] &gt;&gt; Now, you can preach Mark 11 all you want
[7:42] to, but if you're leaving out the rest
[7:44] of Mark 11 on forgiveness, you're not
[7:47] preaching the whole picture.
[7:49] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[7:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you're going to preach Mark 11,
[7:52] preach the whole picture of Mark 11. Not
[7:55] just that we have the faith to speak to
[7:57] the mountain, but what is the conditions
[8:00] of our heart? What is the place we put
[8:02] ourselves in as a believer that we could
[8:04] actually come in that God could trust us
[8:07] enough to say to this mountain, "Be thou
[8:10] removed."
[8:11] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but that's my
[8:13] desire. I'll go ahead and tell you my
[8:15] desire this morning. I was praying here
[8:16] last night, praying at the church,
[8:18] praying in this little room here quietly
[8:20] with the Lord. And I'll tell you, uh,
[8:22] something happened to me because as I
[8:24] begin to see what this forgiveness
[8:25] really is. But my desire is that my
[8:28] prayer would have power behind it. My
[8:31] desire is that when I go to pray or lay
[8:33] hands on somebody that there is an
[8:35] effect. There's not too many other goals
[8:37] or desires that I have in this life. And
[8:40] this should be every believer's desire
[8:42] that we when when we pray, it is the
[8:45] prayer of faith. And our prayer is an
[8:47] effectual and a fervent prayer that
[8:50] bombards heaven and gets the job done.
[8:53] &gt;&gt; What else do we have left?
[8:55] &gt;&gt; There are situations that I hardly can't
[8:57] deal with today and all I'm left with is
[8:59] prayer. And if all I'm left with is
[9:01] prayer, I want my prayer to mean
[9:03] something. I want my prayer to get
[9:05] through. Is anybody else in agreement
[9:08] that Mark 11 should be manifesting in
[9:10] the bride? That there's meaning behind
[9:12] our prayer and it's not just saying a
[9:15] prayer, but it's the prayer of faith
[9:18] that gets the results.
[9:21] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Praise the Lord."
[9:24] &gt;&gt; That's my desire. And so now he brings
[9:26] in this this importance of forgiveness
[9:29] because this is the realms that the
[9:31] bride is called to. And we cannot ignore
[9:33] any part that gives us entrance into
[9:35] this. I want to know what's the entrance
[9:37] into me Mark chapter 11. What's the
[9:40] entrance? So you say faith comes by you
[9:42] say well faith comes by hearing and
[9:45] hearing by the word of God. How many
[9:47] knows that faith cometh by hearing and
[9:49] hearing by the word of God. But you
[9:52] cannot hear the word right unless your
[9:55] heart is right. Yeah.
[10:00] &gt;&gt; If there's something laying in your
[10:02] heart like unforgiveness,
[10:05] &gt;&gt; you're not even hearing the word right
[10:07] for it to build your faith.
[10:11] &gt;&gt; And that's why he puts this forgiveness
[10:14] at a level that is so is is just as
[10:18] important in as if you say to this
[10:20] mountain, forgiveness cannot be ignored.
[10:23] The freeing of the heart can never be
[10:26] ignored. So now the to so if you're
[10:29] going to preach Mark 11, you have to
[10:32] preach the rest of the story. Isn't that
[10:34] what Paul Harvey said? This is the rest
[10:37] of the story.
[10:38] &gt;&gt; You can't preach Mark 11 without
[10:40] preaching about forgiveness.
[10:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[10:43] You can't preach Mark 11 faith without
[10:47] preaching not having ought against
[10:49] another
[10:51] &gt;&gt; because it is the whole picture of
[10:54] everything. We we would all agree that
[10:56] the glory of the Lord would be present
[10:58] to see Mark 11 in action. We'd all agree
[11:01] that the glory of the Lord would be
[11:02] present to see Mark 11 in action. But in
[11:05] the proverb that we read, it speaks of a
[11:07] glory of a on a man that is the power of
[11:09] forgiveness. He he overlooks a matter.
[11:12] He releases a matter. He defers his
[11:14] anger towards someone. When he does
[11:17] that, there's a glory of the Lord that's
[11:18] in that. There's a power. We know
[11:20] there's glory in saying to this
[11:22] mountain, but there's a glory in the
[11:24] Lord when you forgive
[11:26] &gt;&gt; from your heart.
[11:28] &gt;&gt; We may not see the results of that. But
[11:31] nevertheless, the glory is in a man who
[11:34] defers his anger and overlooks a
[11:36] transgression.
[11:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:39] &gt;&gt; Ah, praise the Lord. I want that kind of
[11:40] glory. And so when we come into that
[11:42] truly it is it is of God. This glory is
[11:47] of God and it sets us up into a freedom
[11:49] in us that empties us out. Empties us
[11:53] out and makes more room for more of his
[11:58] glory.
[12:00] &gt;&gt; Can I say it again?
[12:02] &gt;&gt; What is Why is he teaching on
[12:04] forgiveness? Because it empties us out
[12:07] of things that are shadows in our
[12:09] hearts.
[12:10] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[12:11] So it empties us out so that more of his
[12:14] glory
[12:16] &gt;&gt; can work in our vessel. I want to remind
[12:18] you all that the power of Calvary was
[12:20] released to us when he died. The full
[12:25] power of redemption was released to us
[12:28] when he died. Can you say amen?
[12:30] &gt;&gt; He said when he died the whole earth
[12:32] shook. It was such an incident and
[12:34] redemption was finished for sons and
[12:36] daughters of God. And it pulled sons and
[12:39] daughters of God, not only Jesus but
[12:41] other sons that had died in him. It
[12:43] pulled them into the power of
[12:45] resurrection. When Jesus died, it
[12:48] triggered a resurrection and the saints
[12:50] come out of the grave. When he cried
[12:52] from the cross and says, "It is
[12:54] finished. It was completely finished."
[12:57] And now not only him but sons could
[13:00] enter into resurrection power.
[13:04] &gt;&gt; And so that was the power of
[13:05] resurrection. But moments before the
[13:09] resurrection power came, before these
[13:12] are the words that came from Jesus as he
[13:15] looked at those that were shaming him,
[13:18] gossiping at him, falsely accusing him,
[13:21] beating him, scorging him, gossiping
[13:24] against him, embarrassing him. He looked
[13:27] at those people and he said, "Father,
[13:29] forgive them.
[13:37] for they don't know what they're doing.
[13:40] &gt;&gt; They're doing this, but they don't know
[13:41] what they're doing. And so, he released
[13:43] a forgiveness.
[13:46] The power of forgiveness was released to
[13:48] them. And none of those people even
[13:49] deserved it. Can I get an amen this
[13:51] morning? They didn't deserve getting any
[13:53] forgiveness. But I'm here to say, the
[13:55] power of forgiveness was released before
[13:59] the p other powers and the power of
[14:01] resurrection came.
[14:03] There was something that was released in
[14:04] him to say, "I forgive you. Forgive
[14:07] them, Father. They don't know what
[14:09] they're doing." Forgiveness. And the
[14:10] power of forgiveness was released before
[14:13] the power of resurrection was released.
[14:16] &gt;&gt; Maybe that's why Jesus put it in Mark
[14:19] 11.
[14:20] Maybe we shouldn't look down so much and
[14:23] try to hide things, but to say, "Lord, I
[14:25] really need to release all of my aught
[14:28] in my heart
[14:32] &gt;&gt; against those who've done me wrong,
[14:35] &gt;&gt; sir." If we're really serious about more
[14:37] faith, if we're really serious about
[14:40] walking in the precepts where the bride
[14:42] should be walking, if we're going to
[14:44] preach it and we're going to say amen to
[14:46] that, then we have to say amen to say,
[14:48] "God, change my heart. Soften my heart
[14:51] that I can release this forgiveness in
[14:54] me and release this au in me and forgive
[14:57] those who have done me wrong." You may
[14:59] be there this morning and I say, "Praise
[15:01] God, you're further along than a lot of
[15:03] the rest of us. God bless you, brother
[15:05] Paul. I don't have any odd against it.
[15:07] I'm a free person. People have done me
[15:09] wrong. I've released it like the
[15:10] maturity of Joseph to say what they did
[15:12] in evil. God has turned it to my good.
[15:15] That's the only way I'm going to look at
[15:16] it. That's my predestinated trials.
[15:19] Every evil that's been done to me, every
[15:21] gossip, it's turned to my good. God
[15:24] bless you.
[15:27] But for those of the rest of us who have
[15:30] things come along that you hold there,
[15:35] &gt;&gt; I pray that you could leave this morning
[15:37] with it released. But when we leave, I
[15:39] pray that we would leave because Jesus
[15:41] released the power and the height of
[15:42] forgiveness was released and all the
[15:44] other power was released after
[15:46] resurrection. All power, in fact, he
[15:48] said the words in Matthew 28:18,
[15:51] "All power is given unto me in heaven
[15:53] and earth." Full authority was given
[15:56] when full forgiveness was given.
[15:59] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you've ever heard this
[16:01] before. You probably have, but I want to
[16:02] emphasize it over and over again that
[16:05] with Jesus, the full and complete
[16:07] authority was released until he said all
[16:10] power is given to me in heaven and
[16:13] earth. The full power was released and
[16:15] authority when all forgiveness was
[16:19] released.
[16:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[16:22] &gt;&gt; Peter's last words, excuse me, Steven's
[16:25] last words as he was stoned
[16:28] while he was being stoned, laying out
[16:29] this sin to their charge.
[16:33] &gt;&gt; And he left, but the heavens opened up
[16:34] to him.
[16:36] &gt;&gt; The glory of the Lord opened up to him.
[16:38] &gt;&gt; Are you listening this morning?
[16:40] &gt;&gt; While they were stoning him, Stephen
[16:43] said, "Lord, don't lay this sin to their
[16:46] charge." So why my title that says
[16:48] smoking habits and holding grudges? This
[16:50] is it from a quote. Brother Brand says
[16:52] in 1957, "Now while you're praying, shut
[16:55] in with God." There was those who raised
[16:58] their hands uh that wanted to walk with
[17:01] God, wanted to open their hearts to him.
[17:03] The altar is open now, my friend. I'd
[17:06] invite each one of you to come here at
[17:08] the altar and kneel down and say, "Lord
[17:11] Jesus, be merciful. I want you to come
[17:13] into my heart. Move all my fears. Move
[17:16] all my selfishness. Move everything out
[17:18] and come in. Come into my heart and be
[17:20] Lord. Oh, I believe you're my savior,
[17:23] but you haven't been my Lord.
[17:26] &gt;&gt; How many know there's a difference?
[17:29] &gt;&gt; There's a difference in just being
[17:31] savior and being lord. That means he
[17:33] takes up housekeeping and takes control
[17:36] of this vessel.
[17:37] &gt;&gt; That means if there's something that's
[17:38] odd, there's something that's wrong, it
[17:40] has to be released for him to fully set
[17:42] up housekeeping. I don't just want him
[17:44] to be my savior. I want him to be my
[17:46] lord.
[17:48] Now look at this. It's just a small
[17:50] statement. And now this is a
[17:51] discernment. He looks at this brother
[17:53] and and if you read the messages, you
[17:56] see the discernment. Uh when that ca
[17:58] came on him and he knew those things, it
[18:00] was accurate. He could see their life.
[18:02] He could see their doctor talking. He
[18:03] could tell their name. He could their
[18:05] house number, their street number. And
[18:06] and brother Brandham did not know that.
[18:08] But God knows. It tells us God knows all
[18:11] things about us.
[18:12] &gt;&gt; He knows your house number. He knows the
[18:14] trial your family's going through. He's
[18:16] completely aware. probably more than you
[18:18] are of your problems.
[18:20] &gt;&gt; And he proved this by that son of man
[18:23] gift working through a vessel like
[18:25] brother Brandham. God bless you,
[18:27] brother. This man name is Davis. He
[18:31] comes from Virginia.
[18:34] He's here to give up a habit of smoking
[18:38] and a little grudge that he's held in
[18:40] his heart against a loved one since he
[18:43] was a child.
[18:47] And when I read that, I thought, "Oh my,
[18:50] there's my sermon."
[18:52] &gt;&gt; That's what he's at the altar for this
[18:56] morning.
[18:57] &gt;&gt; This is things we come to the altar for.
[19:01] &gt;&gt; Now, first of all, I don't really have
[19:03] to preach against smoking.
[19:06] At least, I hope I don't have to. If
[19:09] you've got that filthy habit in your
[19:10] life and it's been proved over and over
[19:13] again for many many years of the damages
[19:16] to your body, I think when we come to
[19:19] smoking, there's no benefit to it. And
[19:20] yet people are so uh pretend they're so
[19:24] addicted that they'll actually know that
[19:27] it causes damage. My grandpa and Grandma
[19:29] Le Fontaine died of lung cancer and up
[19:31] until the end she's smoking those just
[19:33] smoking, smoking and smoking and she
[19:35] knew knows what it's going to do. Other
[19:36] family members died. How can a person
[19:39] know that and do it? That's how much an
[19:41] addiction can take you.
[19:43] &gt;&gt; And that's how much a person can hold
[19:46] tightly on to something
[19:50] &gt;&gt; even if it's doing them damage.
[19:54] Right.
[19:57] &gt;&gt; So my question to you is if that can
[19:59] happen with a smoking habit which
[20:01] everybody knows then this other thing
[20:04] that this man come to the altar for and
[20:06] I don't even know if he knew about the
[20:08] other thing. This is brother Brandon
[20:10] discerning this is what you're at the
[20:12] altar for. I think the other part was
[20:14] hidden since he was a child that he was
[20:17] holding a grudge. He might not have even
[20:19] known. But I want to make the point
[20:22] whether it's being released of a habit
[20:23] of smoking or whether it's being
[20:25] released of a grudge, it's the same
[20:27] thing. It's still something that holds
[20:30] on to a person.
[20:32] &gt;&gt; And this, brother, it was his whole
[20:35] life.
[20:37] &gt;&gt; What was it? Some vegetarian? No. A
[20:39] grudge
[20:41] &gt;&gt; against a family member.
[20:43] &gt;&gt; We don't know what it was, but it was a
[20:45] a grudge. And he's at the altar to pray.
[20:49] This is his need. This is his name. This
[20:51] is where he's from. And he's got two
[20:53] things. And to us, it looks like two
[20:56] very separate things. That's why I've
[20:59] said before recently in the past is that
[21:02] we have healing lines and and and prayer
[21:06] lines for deliverance of demons and
[21:09] deliverance of diseases.
[21:12] If this is true, where's the prayer
[21:14] lines to pray for grudges? Because here
[21:19] to me, I don't see it too much as being
[21:22] two things that were holding this man,
[21:24] holding him down, holding his heart
[21:26] against a loved one. And they're both
[21:28] things that binding him, and both things
[21:30] he needed to be delivered from. Can you
[21:33] say amen? He is at the altar for a
[21:35] smoking habit and a grudge. And I guess
[21:38] he needed freedom from both. It was all
[21:41] the way since he was a child that he
[21:43] held a grudge. How long can a person
[21:47] hold a grudge?
[21:50] &gt;&gt; How long can a person hold a grudge? He
[21:55] wants us to forgive and release grudges.
[21:58] Why? They are bad. And I want to safely
[22:02] say this morning, they're just as bad as
[22:04] smoking. Smoking is bad, right? We all
[22:06] agree. All the young people, everybody,
[22:09] smoking is bad. Both are dangerous.
[22:12] Smoking has years of research showing
[22:14] cancer and other things coming from it.
[22:15] And yet someone when they hold on to a
[22:17] habit, when they hold on to that, they
[22:20] think it's not doing that much damage.
[22:22] But over time, it's doing damage. People
[22:24] know the re the research and still hold
[22:27] on to it. But is the same with a grudge
[22:31] against someone, it has terrible damage
[22:34] as well. That's why they hold on. Lord,
[22:37] deliver me from this nicotine spirit.
[22:39] Sometimes they will say but nothing in
[22:42] their unforgiving spirit that they've
[22:44] had in a grudge for years in the
[22:46] science. Science says forgiveness
[22:49] reduces stress and improves health.
[22:51] Holding on to grudges causes and I you
[22:54] know you can look at this yourself. I
[22:56] don't want to read a lot of science or
[22:58] the psychology about about it but
[23:00] holding on to grudges this is clearly
[23:01] science now. This is not uh any from any
[23:04] Christian source. Holding on to grudges
[23:06] causes chronic stress, which harms your
[23:08] health and well-being. Forgiving others
[23:11] lowers stress hormones like cortisol
[23:14] decreases blood pressure and leads to a
[23:16] stronger immune system. It also lowers
[23:18] the risk of depression and anxiety.
[23:21] Studies show forgiveness even slows
[23:23] aging and increases longevity.
[23:27] &gt;&gt; Boy, do I ever need to forgive
[23:30] &gt;&gt; because I want to live a little longer.
[23:33] So you know this is science and you know
[23:35] what if you think that these inward
[23:37] heart things don't affect you physically
[23:39] go through the prayer lines and find out
[23:41] as he would say you can be healed of
[23:43] this but the real core problem was this
[23:45] thing and it wasn't a physical problem
[23:47] it became a physical why does the Bible
[23:49] say say laughter doeth good like a
[23:51] medicine
[23:54] &gt;&gt; if you're happy and you're free and
[23:57] you're laughing that is a medicine even
[23:59] for your own physical body
[24:01] &gt;&gt; that's why I miss my had he could come
[24:03] and sing the laughing song this morning.
[24:05] I watched him sing the laughing song all
[24:07] over this country and he made people
[24:09] laugh they hadn't laughed in 30 years.
[24:11] I'm telling you, they were healthier
[24:12] because they just learned how to laugh
[24:14] again. Some people need to learn how to
[24:16] laugh again.
[24:17] &gt;&gt; Some people need to learn how to smile
[24:19] again. Some people don't have the
[24:21] happiness in the Lord because the way
[24:23] they look at me in church sometimes
[24:25] while I'm preaching, I can tell
[24:26] something is wrong. I can't do anything
[24:29] to make them smile. But you need
[24:31] something in your life to release these
[24:34] whatever it is in your in in your body
[24:37] that makes you happy. And then it says
[24:39] when you forgive, science says it leads
[24:42] to changes in your brain that improve
[24:45] your ability to regulate emotions and
[24:47] reactions.
[24:49] Activity in the amdala which I hope I'm
[24:52] saying that right. Magdala which
[24:53] processes fear and anger decreases areas
[24:57] linked to empathy. Positive feelings and
[25:01] emotional control become more active.
[25:04] What? When we forgive.
[25:09] &gt;&gt; This rewiring makes you less reactive
[25:13] and more compassionate over time. This
[25:16] rewiring. How many want to be rewired
[25:19] this morning?
[25:21] &gt;&gt; Not by psychology, but by the Holy Ghost
[25:24] happiness. Amen.
[25:26] &gt;&gt; The kingdom of God is not meat and
[25:28] drink. The kingdom not is not just a
[25:30] dress code, but it's righteousness and
[25:33] peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.
[25:37] &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible says.
[25:39] &gt;&gt; This life is a life and it should be of
[25:41] joy in the Holy Ghost on Monday, on
[25:44] Tuesday. Why aren't you enjoying the joy
[25:47] of the Holy Ghost?
[25:52] But beyond that, what we're preaching on
[25:54] this morning, it's a hindrance to
[25:56] mountain moving faith. How many want
[25:58] mountainoving faith? This this lack of
[26:01] forgiveness is a hindrance to
[26:03] mountainoving faith. It is a hidden
[26:05] stronghold that limits the authority and
[26:08] the confidence of the believer. Brother
[26:11] Bram says in 1963 our number one heart
[26:15] disease the main thing that kills people
[26:17] today it's the number isn't it
[26:19] interesting he says s heart disease he
[26:22] said the number one disease I don't know
[26:24] if it's still today but it is a major
[26:26] thing heart disease isn't that the
[26:28] something that the natural types the
[26:30] spiritual man they already can prove
[26:33] that a man that holds grudges and a
[26:34] woman who fuss and stew and fight and
[26:37] argue they die it'll cause cancer
[26:40] fungus, everything else will set in.
[26:42] Ulcers is confirming what I read in
[26:44] science. All right. So, you were made to
[26:48] be happy and free. There's my sermon
[26:51] this morning.
[26:53] &gt;&gt; Smoking habits and holding grudges.
[26:56] &gt;&gt; Why do we have to get rid of them?
[26:58] Because you were made to be free and
[27:00] happy.
[27:02] &gt;&gt; And this isn't some seminar on trying to
[27:05] the 10 steps to make you happy. This is
[27:07] happiness in the Holy Ghost. This is
[27:10] happiness God purchased at Calvary.
[27:13] &gt;&gt; That the dark shadows over your life and
[27:16] the guilt over your life and the things
[27:18] that make you you can't even hardly
[27:19] fellowship with the rest of the
[27:20] believers because this dark shadow hangs
[27:22] over you. Listen, if you've done
[27:24] something in your past, bring it under
[27:26] the blood of Jesus Christ. Accept his
[27:29] forgiveness. Accept his pardon because a
[27:32] pardon isn't a pardon until it's
[27:34] accepted as a pardon. I believe the Lord
[27:36] has forgiven and washed away all of my
[27:39] sins. And today I look at one thing and
[27:41] that's my future with the Lord. The past
[27:44] is in the sea of forgetfulness.
[27:46] &gt;&gt; He does that to make us truly happy and
[27:49] joyful. He can look and see there ain't
[27:52] no shadows there.
[27:54] &gt;&gt; G.
[27:54] &gt;&gt; He has forgiven all.
[27:57] &gt;&gt; He's free.
[27:59] &gt;&gt; Now I can use him more effectively.
[28:02] Now his faith in the word takes a
[28:05] different level, a perfect faith. Can
[28:08] you say amen?
