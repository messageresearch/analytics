Description:
Trials don’t end the believer. They reveal the Word that’s been living inside them.
Through fire, flood, and silence… He stayed.
And here we stand, breathing praise.
A new year.
A living testimony.
We made it.
God is so good! 🙌

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Been a long year. Cried some hard tears on some dark nights. Tried to pray through. Nothing seemed to make the wrongs right. Oh, I can't believe the pain I've seen. But looking back to every step you never left. And I'm so thankful that I'm coming out the other side stronger. One foot in front of the other. Hands still raising. Heart still raising. I made it. I made it. I made it. I made it. Through the storms in hell and high water. I never left the hands of my father. I'm still breathing. Thank you, Jesus. I made it. I made it. I made it. I made it. Oh, it cost me, but it taught me that you won't quit. How faithful, how amazing, that your grace is. Oh, no matter what this life may bring, I know you'll bring me through. And even in my suffering, Lord, I can trust in you. I'm coming out the other side, stronger. One foot in front of the other. Hands still raising, heart still raising. I made it. I made it. I made it. I made it. Through the storms and hell and high water. I never left the hands of my father. I'm still breathing. Thank you, Jesus. I made it. I made it. I made it. I made it. I made it through more than I thought that I could. I walked through the worst, but it worked for my good. It's a miracle that I can stand here and say I made it. Oh, I made it. I made it through more than I thought that I could. I walked through the worst, but it worked for my good. It's a miracle that I can stand here and say I made it. Oh, I made it. I'm coming out the other side stronger. One foot in front of the other. Hands still raising. Heart still raising. I made it. I made it. I made it. I made it through the storms of hell and high water. I never left the hands of my father. I'm still breathing. Thank you, Jesus. I made it. I made it. I made it. I made it. Coming out the other side. Stronger. One foot in front of the other. Hands still raising, heart still raising. I made it. I made it. I made it. I made it. Through the storms and hell and high water. I never left the hands of my father. I'm still breathing. Thank you, Jesus. I made it. I made it. I made it. I made it. I made it. Praise God. I made it.
