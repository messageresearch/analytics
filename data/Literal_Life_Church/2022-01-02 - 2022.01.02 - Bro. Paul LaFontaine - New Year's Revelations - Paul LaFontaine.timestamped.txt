[4:03] know it'll be a a good time in the lord
[4:05] we're very very excited about it and uh
[4:08] the ministers we have several in our
[4:10] hearts to bring in this year um
[4:12] god has a fivefold ministry and we have
[4:15] many here in the church we're blessed
[4:17] with and we have also many around the
[4:19] world there's no way to get them all in
[4:21] but we just pray about it we feel led to
[4:23] have these brothers here coming up so we
[4:25] want to be able to
[4:27] just enjoy the good word of god from the
[4:28] different gifts god has provided for us
[4:31] god bless you let's just go to the word
[4:32] this morning and we're going to read
[4:34] three verses of scripture in psalms
[4:37] uh verse
[4:38] chapter one and verse one and you'll
[4:40] find this as the first section in your
[4:42] new devotional there
[4:44] and um i thought it was uh
[4:47] inspiring to start the year and i just
[4:50] want to speak today and preach a bit on
[4:52] the uh some new year's
[4:55] new year's revelations and i trust it'll
[4:58] be a blessing to you i trust you'll be
[4:59] encouraged and you'd be listening in i
[5:02] believe there'll be some things that'll
[5:03] be encouragement to you this morning
[5:05] and you give me your amens i'll feel
[5:07] them here and uh that would be great
[5:10] praise the lord
[5:12] so psalms chapter one and verse one
[5:15] blessed is the man blessed means that
[5:18] he's favored of god he's happy he's uh
[5:21] he's a blessed man of god blessed is the
[5:23] man
[5:24] that walketh not in the counsel of the
[5:27] ungodly
[5:28] nor standeth in the way of sinners
[5:31] nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful
[5:33] now we could say that he's not a blessed
[5:36] man if he chooses to walk in the council
[5:38] of the ungodly if he chooses to stand in
[5:41] the way of sinners nor
[5:44] if he chooses to sit in the seat of the
[5:46] scornful then we could say he's not
[5:48] really a blessed man he may be blessed
[5:49] financially or other ways but in god's
[5:52] eyes he's not blessed because he chooses
[5:54] to position himself to these influences
[5:57] so but the man who chooses and the woman
[5:59] that chooses to be away from these
[6:01] influences and under the influence of
[6:03] god then he's a blessed man goes on to
[6:06] say but his delight is in the law of the
[6:09] lord his delight his passion is in the
[6:11] word of god and in his law doth he
[6:14] meditate day and night
[6:17] day and night and he shall be like a
[6:20] tree
[6:21] planted by the rivers of water that
[6:24] bringeth forth his fruit in his season
[6:28] his leaf also shall not wither and
[6:31] whatsoever he doeth shall prosper now
[6:34] friends that's a pretty powerful
[6:36] set of scriptures here and i believe
[6:37] it's a blessing to see whatever he doeth
[6:41] shall prosper praise the lord father may
[6:43] you bless the word today may the word go
[6:46] out to every heart lord and every soul
[6:48] that's hungry for you
[6:49] and i pray that lord you'll just direct
[6:51] our words to be to give a word in season
[6:55] for these lovely group of people who are
[6:57] listening in today god bless them lord
[6:59] for just
[7:00] falling after the guidelines of the
[7:02] deacons and we're
[7:04] we don't want to have to do this but
[7:05] father we know that you can touch hearts
[7:07] and anoint this word and i pray you'll
[7:09] do so lord
[7:11] people's lives may they just be changed
[7:13] by the word of god lord may we approach
[7:15] this year with such a fervor and a
[7:17] desire
[7:18] and a revival in our hearts lord with
[7:21] such a positive confession lord that you
[7:24] are in control and lord that no outside
[7:27] circumstances lord can ever depress us
[7:30] we're too blessed to be
[7:32] depressed
[7:33] we're too anointed to be disappointed i
[7:36] pray father that you'll lift us above
[7:38] the shadows and you encourage every art
[7:40] that's listening in today and even in
[7:42] the archive we just give it to you may
[7:44] you bless your word in jesus name amen
[7:47] praise the lord amen now i i just
[7:50] believe that these three scriptures and
[7:52] three verses here this morning
[7:54] in it we find a greater revelation than
[7:57] what we realize
[7:59] and in these scriptures that we read i
[8:01] believe that there is a great revelation
[8:04] of the place
[8:05] that a christian
[8:07] can live every day
[8:09] to be an overcomer how many want to be
[8:11] an overcomer
[8:13] that's what we're called to be in
[8:14] laodicea we're called to be over every
[8:16] age had overcomers and we're called to
[8:18] be an overcomer not just a survivor but
[8:21] an overcomer in this laodicean age and
[8:24] so i believe we have some keys and
[8:26] revelations here that gives us the keys
[8:28] to christian lives living every day
[8:31] being an overcomer
[8:32] to be uh insulated
[8:35] from the world uh to be isolated from
[8:38] the influences
[8:39] that come in our minds and i want to
[8:41] elaborate on that in our thought life
[8:44] and there's some different things here
[8:45] this morning because we can be insulated
[8:47] by the holy ghost we can be isolated
[8:50] from the influences of the mind and
[8:52] letting them to lodge within our
[8:54] thinking in our thought life and so we
[8:57] are we in the scripture here are typed
[8:59] as a tree
[9:00] and if you know your bible you know that
[9:03] that trees are a type of a man and trees
[9:06] are a type of christ because in the
[9:08] beginning in the genesis we find that
[9:10] god talks about the trees that's in the
[9:12] garden but we know that not all those
[9:15] trees were literal trees some of them
[9:17] were literal trees and some of them
[9:19] represented trees which trees represent
[9:22] man but also trees represented christ
[9:25] and in the garden we have the tree of
[9:27] life in the garden we have the tree of
[9:29] knowledge of good and evil and actually
[9:31] incidentally those trees end up being
[9:34] symbolic that the tree of life in the
[9:36] garden was a person the tree of
[9:38] knowledge and good and evil was a person
[9:41] so you can't look at it just through a
[9:43] carnal eyes when you look at the book of
[9:44] genesis but we find in the beginning god
[9:47] is speaking about trees in the garden
[9:49] and they were not all literal trees
[9:52] and then if you move to the middle of
[9:54] the bible we see that the tree of life
[9:56] was a person that we eat of in the
[9:58] middle of the bible jesus was saying i
[10:01] am the bread of the life i am the way of
[10:03] life i am the tree of life in john 15 he
[10:06] refers to himself as the vine
[10:08] and you are the branches so so jesus is
[10:11] saying you are connected to this tree of
[10:14] life you are the branches to this tree
[10:16] of life i'm the vine you are the
[10:18] branches and any and we're in not
[10:21] engrafted but we're part of this tree so
[10:24] my theme is that the reason that he
[10:26] speaks about in psalms 1 is a tree a man
[10:29] is like a tree planted by the rivers of
[10:31] living water because men type trees and
[10:34] and we can even bear the fruit of
[10:36] something of the world or we can be
[10:39] connected to the tree of life and your
[10:41] life becomes a tree of life
[10:43] your life bears fruit of christ can you
[10:46] say amen praise the lord so then
[10:50] we see that at the end time then we give
[10:52] the middle of the bible the beginning of
[10:54] the bible but at the end time the
[10:55] prophet comes and preaches the bride
[10:58] tree and he says the bride tree that was
[11:00] in the in the early church got destroyed
[11:03] and the leaves fell off and uh and it
[11:06] and satan ate it down to the very almost
[11:09] to the roots but he said in the end time
[11:11] i will restore saith the lord what's god
[11:13] restoring he's restoring a bride tree
[11:16] and he has done that and he's almost
[11:18] finished with his restoration so all of
[11:21] these types type the bride and type you
[11:24] as an individual as a tree that is to
[11:27] bear the fruit not of your own life and
[11:30] your own selfish desires but to bear the
[11:33] fruit of christ in our lives how many
[11:35] want to bear the fruit of christ
[11:37] and the word that he gives us
[11:39] is there's a reason he gives this word
[11:41] not just that you intellectually accept
[11:44] it but you actually become a tree that's
[11:47] bearing the fruit in your generation in
[11:49] your season
[11:50] so now we see that the reason the
[11:52] prophet preached bride tree the bride is
[11:54] this tree collectively the bride is this
[11:57] tree but you are a tree individually and
[12:00] you're called to bear the fruit of the
[12:02] message of your day just laying some
[12:04] foundational points so we understand
[12:06] where we're going so then we see that
[12:08] when it says that
[12:11] he shall bear his fruit in his season
[12:14] it's him that we bear and when it says
[12:16] in his season his fruit in his season
[12:20] there is a fruit for a particular season
[12:23] not for another day there's a word for
[12:25] every day there's a word to manifest
[12:27] that's god's fruit for that day not the
[12:30] fruit we're not bearing the fruit of
[12:32] luther's day we're not bearing the fruit
[12:34] of wesley's day but in the season we're
[12:36] not even bearing the fruit of pentecost
[12:39] people often emphasize these different
[12:41] things and they're trying to produce the
[12:43] fruit of luther's day trying to produce
[12:45] the fruit of wesley's day and
[12:47] sanctification all that is part of the
[12:49] word but then you have people
[12:50] emphasizing that we're supposed to see
[12:52] the fruit of pentecost we're moved
[12:55] beyond that although we have all that
[12:57] restoration we're not emphasizing let me
[12:59] see the fruits of of azusa street and
[13:01] pentecost no no no we've moved beyond
[13:03] because we're in a different season
[13:05] we're in a different time
[13:07] and this scripture says this man of god
[13:10] this brother and sister of god this
[13:12] believer
[13:13] whether man or woman if they're a
[13:14] believer they'll bear his fruit
[13:18] in his season
[13:20] not their own fruit not the fruit of
[13:22] another season but the message fruits
[13:24] for this day the word of this day the
[13:26] word of this hour the fruits of the
[13:28] message i'll tell you let god see the
[13:31] fruits of this message coming from our
[13:32] lives not some type of baptist creed
[13:35] fruit not just a something like that but
[13:38] the fruit for this season god sent his
[13:40] word for this season and we are the
[13:42] trees that bear the fruit for the fruit
[13:44] for the season for the for the for the
[13:46] godliness for the word that he wanted to
[13:49] proclaim for this hour and i'm just
[13:51] excited about i believe that we're
[13:53] called to bear the fruit of the message
[13:55] of our day thank god for ones who are
[13:57] bearing the fruit that they have but
[13:59] don't get stuck in just bearing the
[14:00] fruit of pentecost
[14:02] we're beyond that we're beyond that
[14:04] people get
[14:05] get sticky when you say we're beyond
[14:06] pentecost but we are the brother brahman
[14:09] says the word that fell on the day of
[14:10] pentecost the word that fell on the day
[14:12] of pentecost will not work for this day
[14:14] we're under a different word we're
[14:16] inspired by a different word the last
[14:18] day's message so we're not just to bear
[14:20] the fruit of something back then but
[14:22] even more so today the fruit of
[14:25] spirit-filled lives personal revival in
[14:27] our lives that's what god's called us to
[14:30] it's his fruit that we bear in his
[14:33] season can you say praise the lord
[14:36] amen i can hear you saying it there
[14:38] so now to summarize just this foundation
[14:40] that i lay laying here this is a
[14:42] believer who's been planted in the right
[14:45] place
[14:46] beside the flowing rivers and waters of
[14:49] god
[14:50] this is a believer i'm summarizing now
[14:52] what i'm going to preach the rest of the
[14:53] time
[14:55] and then so but don't just hear the
[14:56] summary and then
[14:58] turn off the computer don't do that
[15:01] you should hear the rest of it but i'm
[15:03] summarizing that these three scriptures
[15:05] say
[15:06] that this is a believer
[15:09] who's been planted in the right place
[15:11] beside the flowing waters of god his
[15:14] life is planted in the right place his
[15:17] roots are going in the right place in
[15:19] the right position
[15:20] he has shut off all wrong influences
[15:24] he has one main passion in his life and
[15:26] that's the word of god
[15:28] and he is prospering both naturally and
[15:32] spiritually because it says whatsoever
[15:35] this man does is gonna prosper
[15:38] praise god i don't want the world's
[15:41] prosperity
[15:42] i don't want the success of the world
[15:44] remember he said to joshua if you'll
[15:46] follow these things joshua 1 he said
[15:48] thou shalt have good success not just
[15:51] success but you'll have good success in
[15:53] the year 2022 i want to ask you do you
[15:56] want the success of the world do you
[15:58] want the money of the world do you want
[16:00] what they call success or do you want
[16:02] good success
[16:04] and good success is when you and your
[16:06] family are following the word of god
[16:08] obedient to the word of god serving him
[16:10] with god in in the passion for the word
[16:12] and then you have not just success but
[16:14] good success
[16:16] not just prosperity but good prosperity
[16:19] god's prosperity god's blessing in your
[16:22] life hallelujah
[16:24] praise me to god so this is a believer
[16:27] that's been planted in the right place
[16:29] has shut off all wrong influences has
[16:31] one main passion in the word and is
[16:34] prospering both naturally and
[16:35] spiritually we're talking about your
[16:37] spiritual life your tree
[16:39] i asked you today where is your tree
[16:42] planted
[16:43] what influence are you under right now
[16:46] you better take a look at that for you
[16:47] for the year
[16:48] 2022 what influence is your mind under
[16:52] what influence is your thought life
[16:54] under
[16:56] where are you planted and what influence
[16:58] are you under you know planting
[17:01] and caring for plants
[17:03] and trees
[17:04] is actually an art
[17:06] and some people are actually gifted with
[17:08] it but then some people can learn i just
[17:09] bought my daughter uh some plant books
[17:13] my daughter and mariah for christmas i
[17:15] bought her because she's interested in
[17:17] learning more about planting i think
[17:18] she's really good at it good at it
[17:20] already she's really good at flowers and
[17:22] such but she wants to learn more because
[17:24] it's an actual art
[17:25] this guy i have no green thumb my thumbs
[17:28] are not green at all i do not do good at
[17:31] planning and matter of fact my wife gets
[17:34] on me because i'm usually with the
[17:35] roundup around trying to get the weeds
[17:38] around things and a few times i've
[17:41] sprayed
[17:42] some really good plants and that doesn't
[17:44] go over well with the wife
[17:46] so you know i just attack the weeds but
[17:48] if i get into the planting thing that
[17:50] thing is not going to thrive under me
[17:52] i'm just not gifted at it but we know
[17:55] the simple fact that a tree and a plant
[17:59] we know that i know this is simple today
[18:02] but i pray that you'll apply it to your
[18:03] lives
[18:05] a tree or a plant
[18:07] cannot thrive
[18:08] if it's planted in the wrong atmosphere
[18:13] your life no matter how much love of god
[18:15] you have no no matter how much you're
[18:18] lining up with the outside of the
[18:20] message no matter how much you're going
[18:22] to a message church or wherever you go
[18:24] to church
[18:25] your life is a tree and where you're
[18:28] planted every day spiritually will
[18:30] determine your thriving as a as a tree
[18:34] of the lord
[18:35] it has everything to do with it you
[18:37] can't say no that has nothing to do with
[18:39] it and what i feed on has nothing to do
[18:41] with it then you're denying what nature
[18:44] says unless a tree is planted in the
[18:46] right place it will not thrive you're
[18:48] divine denying all of nature and you're
[18:51] saying that my life doesn't apply to
[18:53] that no he's he typed your life in
[18:55] psalms 1 as a tree and a man or a
[18:58] woman's life has to be planted close to
[19:01] the rivers of water for moisture can you
[19:03] say that
[19:04] for the right atmosphere can you say
[19:06] amen and if it's not there it's not
[19:09] going to be a thriving tree the wrong
[19:11] atmosphere and if it's there if it's
[19:13] planted in the wrong place it will not
[19:15] reach its full potential and i think
[19:18] there are believers who sometimes are
[19:20] not planted
[19:22] in the right place or positioned
[19:24] just right yet now i've watched this for
[19:26] years
[19:27] um i'm going to remind you something
[19:29] that brother branham said i'm trying to
[19:31] stay
[19:33] within my range here the pulpit not walk
[19:35] around the church because
[19:37] we don't have enough camera people here
[19:39] we just have one so i don't want to make
[19:41] their job harder but so i'm trying to be
[19:43] good up here but i'm excited today
[19:47] i'm excited about the word
[19:49] but but
[19:51] let me just remind you if you never
[19:53] heard brother brahm say this but he said
[19:55] israel
[19:56] was a good vine
[19:59] but
[20:00] she was planted in the wrong place and
[20:02] when he was referring to that he met
[20:04] when they were in egypt for 400 years
[20:07] israel was a good vine
[20:10] she was just planted in the wrong place
[20:13] israel was a good vine she was a good
[20:16] plant but israel could never thrive in
[20:19] egypt
[20:22] israel no matter how good a plant no
[20:24] matter how what she had predestinated in
[20:27] her she could never reach her full
[20:29] potential she was a good vine but she
[20:32] could never reach it while she was in
[20:34] egypt and that's why god comes and said
[20:35] let my people go i've got to get them
[20:37] you're not born to be here under bondage
[20:39] you're born to live in the promised land
[20:41] and that's the same with your life
[20:43] you're not born to be in certain
[20:44] atmosphere that's why a lot of you a lot
[20:47] of you have come from other churches and
[20:49] other denominations and things because
[20:52] you were a good vine but you were
[20:54] planted in the wrong place
[20:56] no don't disrespect to the to the
[20:58] different denominations and things but
[21:00] there's a calling today that's gone out
[21:03] it comes from revelations come out of
[21:05] her my people don't partake of the
[21:07] plagues all of that is of a religious
[21:09] nature and somehow somebody feels the
[21:12] call i've got to come out of this
[21:14] limited version of christ and i've got
[21:16] to come to the full truth and so you're
[21:18] a
[21:19] miniature good vine seed of god god's
[21:22] own children comes out of that come out
[21:24] of my heart my people and the reason
[21:26] they have to come out is they can't
[21:29] thrive spiritually under that atmosphere
[21:32] israel was a good vine but she was
[21:34] planted in the wrong place
[21:37] and i find sometimes people are
[21:39] tremendous people
[21:41] tremendously love god want to grow in
[21:43] god i find teenagers they want to grow
[21:46] they they want to they want to balance
[21:48] they want guidelines they want to hear
[21:49] practical truth teach to them they want
[21:51] the right atmosphere sometimes in our
[21:53] church for years and they end up
[21:55] backsliding or they end up this because
[21:57] why
[21:58] they're a good vine but they're planted
[22:00] in the wrong church
[22:03] they're planting so there was an exodus
[22:05] to come out of
[22:07] wrong atmospheres
[22:08] to come to the right type of atmosphere
[22:11] why so i can grow so i can thrive
[22:14] can you say amen
[22:16] they were planted in the wrong place
[22:18] so there was a whole 2 million of them
[22:20] in egypt planted the wrong place but you
[22:22] do realize when they come into the
[22:24] wilderness for 40 years when they went
[22:26] into the promised land
[22:28] there were some that stayed
[22:30] in the wilderness and there were some
[22:31] that weren't called to go into the
[22:33] promised land when they went in there
[22:35] and said we're well able to take it josh
[22:36] josh and caleb but there was only two
[22:38] that went in either two million there
[22:39] was only two that went in there's only a
[22:41] few that were called and so i'm just
[22:43] saying this to say that now there
[22:46] there was only ones called some state in
[22:49] the wilderness some were just called to
[22:51] stay there they were planted fine there
[22:53] but some could not stay in the
[22:55] wilderness
[22:56] they were to go on and be planted within
[22:59] their promised land and that's where
[23:01] they begin to thrive under the joshua
[23:04] commission is where believers that's the
[23:07] only place
[23:08] they'll thrive
[23:10] those that are spiritual know what i'm
[23:12] talking about you know the word that
[23:14] changed from the moses commission to the
[23:16] joshua there's a change in this message
[23:18] from the prophet to the promise
[23:21] from the prophet to the prophecy
[23:23] amen there's been a change in this
[23:26] message to go from the prophet moses the
[23:29] prophet of this day into the prophecy
[23:31] which is our individual inheritance and
[23:33] what christ has given us and many people
[23:36] that are staying in churches that the
[23:38] emphasis is the prophet are dying
[23:41] spiritually because you haven't come
[23:43] into your promised land yet i say that
[23:45] respectfully i say that with all respect
[23:48] to this message of the hour that god has
[23:50] sent us but there are influences to try
[23:52] to send us back to listening and looking
[23:54] at those things and just looking at what
[23:56] happened in the past but we're moving on
[23:59] and people are drying up and dying
[24:00] because why you're in the wrong
[24:02] atmosphere you're planted in the wrong
[24:04] place you're meant for more you have
[24:06] more potentials praise the lord you've
[24:09] got more potentials in your life
[24:11] but it might be that you're just planted
[24:13] in the wrong place
[24:15] god bless you my christian friend i pray
[24:17] god will lead your heart that if you're
[24:20] in the wrong spot
[24:22] that you take your life and plant it in
[24:24] an atmosphere that you can grow
[24:26] glory be to god
[24:28] and then there was a small group that
[24:30] was planted in the wrong place in the
[24:31] wilderness they never could thrive but
[24:33] once caleb and joshua cru that crew were
[24:36] planted in the promised land they began
[24:38] to thrive bear the fruit of god the
[24:40] thing that god was finally looking for
[24:43] and that was faith to take the land
[24:45] under the joshua commission we're under
[24:46] the joshua commission today
[24:48] you have been you have to be planted in
[24:50] the right place to thrive even the
[24:53] church that you attend can make you grow
[24:55] and thrive in this word or shrivel up
[24:59] and die
[25:01] even the local church that you attend
[25:03] can either make you grow in the word and
[25:06] faith in the word in your position in
[25:07] the word or you can sit there and dry up
[25:11] and shrivel and
[25:12] die you better pray about
[25:15] what you need in your life
[25:17] so through the message coming in the
[25:19] last days i've been saying this last
[25:21] couple sundays we didn't just receive
[25:23] books and tapes
[25:25] we received a kingdom
[25:28] and so i want to make a couple
[25:29] statements about the kingdom we received
[25:32] a kingdom so now the word of god and
[25:34] what god sends his kingdom when he came
[25:36] 2000 years ago i said in that baby they
[25:38] didn't know what they were receiving but
[25:40] they were receiving a whole new kingdom
[25:41] the kingdom of god was coming through
[25:43] that baby it wasn't just a little baby
[25:45] but the whole kingdom of god was coming
[25:47] to earth again and so now when god sends
[25:50] his message in the last days especially
[25:53] we receive a kingdom which cannot be
[25:54] removed we received a kingdom we didn't
[25:56] receive do's and don'ts we didn't
[25:58] receive just another law we didn't
[26:00] receive a code to live by we didn't
[26:02] receive another movement to make another
[26:04] denomination and make another thing that
[26:06] i'm a part of this movement we receive
[26:08] the kingdom of god to earth
[26:10] the message is the kingdom of god
[26:12] restored to us
[26:14] and his kingdom is already here
[26:17] his kingdom is already here and supposed
[26:20] to be in our hearts
[26:22] and his kingdom it's spiritually another
[26:25] realm
[26:26] and so now i'm jumping ahead to say his
[26:28] kingdom is a spiritually another realm
[26:30] to live in and you can live in the world
[26:33] of this kingdom now
[26:35] or you can live on the outside of it
[26:37] every day
[26:39] it's a kingdom it's an atmosphere it's a
[26:42] sphere it's a it's a it's it's we can
[26:45] live in it i'm going to get to some
[26:46] quotes in a minute that'll show that but
[26:48] you see now we can live in the world of
[26:51] his kingdom or we can live outside of it
[26:53] it's your choice we can live outside of
[26:55] it influenced by ungodly people by
[26:58] sinners by critical people or influenced
[27:01] by borderline believers in the message
[27:03] even
[27:04] but
[27:05] sometimes you can be in the message but
[27:07] not positioned in the kingdom of this
[27:10] message i'm going to say that again
[27:12] sometimes you can be around the message
[27:14] but you're not positioned in the kingdom
[27:17] of this message
[27:19] sometimes you're in the movement but you
[27:21] have to be you're living in the kingdom
[27:23] because this is a kingdom
[27:26] i'm going to get to the quote in a
[27:27] minute it says jesus lived in a world to
[27:29] himself while he was walking around the
[27:31] world and sinners everything else he
[27:33] lived in a world to himself what was
[27:35] that world it was the kingdom of god
[27:38] he was living in that every day and
[27:40] that's what we're called to live in a
[27:41] kingdom to ourselves can you say amen
[27:44] praise the lord so now it's a kingdom we
[27:47] must live in position in the kingdom of
[27:49] this message not just the message but in
[27:51] the kingdom in his spiritual atmosphere
[27:54] in the inner veil can you say amen and
[27:56] in the message perfect faith without
[27:58] which i'll refer to some things here
[28:00] he brother branham is pointing us in the
[28:03] message perfectly notice the title not
[28:05] just any faith now not just a limited
[28:08] faith but perfect faith he's pointing us
[28:11] to perfect faith he's pointing us to
[28:13] more faith perfect faith so what we
[28:17] should desire is more faith how many
[28:20] raise your hands i need more faith
[28:22] yes and so it's interesting though in
[28:25] this message of perfect faith he's going
[28:28] to point us to a life of perfect faith
[28:31] but it's interesting that he did not
[28:33] point us to get that he didn't point us
[28:36] to more fasting
[28:38] he didn't point us to more prayer
[28:41] can't find it
[28:44] he didn't point us to a certain amount
[28:46] of time that we have to spend in the
[28:48] word every day
[28:49] can't find it
[28:51] now are all those things important of
[28:53] course
[28:54] because you see you have to those things
[28:56] help us to be in the atmosphere of god
[28:58] they help us to read the word we come
[29:00] into his atmosphere helps us to get
[29:01] revelation and then is it important to
[29:04] fast of course it's important to fast it
[29:06] is important to pray of course should we
[29:08] pray more of course we should but it
[29:11] never should be a thing and he never
[29:13] pointed us that this i'm gonna read to
[29:14] you what he said that brings us into
[29:17] more perfect faith and it wasn't fasting
[29:20] it wasn't more prayer i'll tell you in
[29:22] this day we can't pray enough but
[29:24] there's no rules i told a sister this
[29:26] the other day just trying to encourage
[29:28] her that we don't have any rules set to
[29:29] us to how much time every day we should
[29:31] spend in the word
[29:33] thankfully because i'd never be able to
[29:34] properly to measure up to it god doesn't
[29:37] send out a bunch of rules you have to
[29:38] send this amount of time and if we were
[29:40] to pay a tithe of our time it would be
[29:44] about two hours and 40 minutes a day
[29:47] 24-hour day how many of you are spending
[29:49] 2 hours and 40 minutes a day
[29:51] specifically in prayer or reading the
[29:54] word so we're glad that there's not some
[29:56] set of rules this is a thing that's
[29:58] built on passion i want to be with the
[30:00] lord i want to fellowship with him
[30:02] and if we get into this catholic mode of
[30:05] you have to do a certain amount of thing
[30:07] and you have to do penance we don't
[30:08] believe in penance here we don't believe
[30:10] in paying back for our sins we don't be
[30:13] of certain measures i messed up and made
[30:14] a mistake so i need to spend extra time
[30:16] in the bible today we don't believe in
[30:18] that stuff god doesn't set those rules
[30:20] so in perfect faith he doesn't point to
[30:22] more fasting and more prayer and all
[30:25] although we should do those things but
[30:27] how do we get to a more perfect faith
[30:29] how do we come to perfect faith he
[30:32] doesn't mention incidentally
[30:34] he doesn't mention in that message that
[30:37] we should push play more
[30:41] he doesn't mention that you would think
[30:43] in the message perfect faith he would
[30:46] say we need to push the tapes we need to
[30:48] push play more and that's how we'll come
[30:50] into more perfect faith he doesn't
[30:51] mention that
[30:53] even though that we know that that
[30:55] laying within the message god gave us we
[30:58] believe there's rapturing faith in there
[31:01] and that we should push play and that we
[31:03] should read the word of god but when
[31:05] he's talking about perfect faith i'm
[31:07] going to give you some of the things and
[31:09] it's not specifically what we do to push
[31:11] play these things i'll give you the
[31:13] things he talked about because in that
[31:14] message he doesn't bring that up if we
[31:16] push play all at the same time at a
[31:19] perfect hour of the day listen not once
[31:22] in this message perfect faith did he
[31:23] mention to just that that we'll come to
[31:26] more perfect faith by having house
[31:28] meetings and listening to the tapes
[31:30] together he doesn't see that
[31:33] praise the lord don't hate me
[31:35] but i'm just trying to point you if we
[31:37] have a message called perfect faith then
[31:39] why wasn't the emphasis that's how we'll
[31:41] all come to it no no i'll give you the
[31:43] things that he said that you read the
[31:44] message you listen to it what he says
[31:46] how we come to perfect faith
[31:49] gather together
[31:51] gather in fellowship for prayer
[31:53] but you could do all that and still not
[31:56] come to perfect faith
[31:58] you could do all that and not come to
[31:59] rapturing faith
[32:02] in fact
[32:04] if i jump right to the end and and uh
[32:06] you guys don't have that this particular
[32:08] quote i jumped right at the end of
[32:10] perfect faith i have some other ones but
[32:11] you don't have that one up here
[32:13] if you jump to the end of perfect faith
[32:16] you know what it comes down to at the
[32:18] end of it
[32:19] is knowing how much god loves us
[32:23] and that love reaches back to him
[32:25] he says that creates a perfect faith
[32:29] okay it wasn't our how much we spend in
[32:31] the word it was
[32:33] knowing how much that god loves us has
[32:35] an effect on us
[32:37] and that love because love produces more
[32:39] faith faith and love work together
[32:42] like faith like uh
[32:44] works and faith
[32:46] he says and when we were sinners
[32:48] alienated without god in the world in
[32:50] the muck of mud
[32:51] as i talked about this morning god come
[32:54] to us god sought you never you never saw
[32:56] god
[32:57] no man can come to me except the father
[32:58] draws him first and god came down in
[33:00] that muck what were you and you and
[33:03] sought you out and brought you out that
[33:06] ought to create a perfect love
[33:08] look what you was and look what you are
[33:13] are you listening this morning
[33:15] he's he's
[33:16] showing us the channel to be in the path
[33:20] in order to come to realizing more
[33:22] perfect faith and that is is that look
[33:25] what god look what you was
[33:27] and look what you are i shared this with
[33:29] a sister the other day
[33:31] years ago we had a new couple come in
[33:33] the church
[33:34] and god
[33:36] transformed their lives it was so
[33:38] tremendous he serves at a deacon and
[33:41] another church a faithful couple to this
[33:43] message filled with the holy spirit
[33:45] and when she first come to the lord in
[33:47] our assembly we went we attended a
[33:49] certain camp meeting and i didn't intend
[33:51] on sharing this but i trust it'll be a
[33:52] blessing to you
[33:54] but i knew as a pastor as though
[33:56] meetings went on she began to be
[33:58] troubled and never seen her try to see
[33:59] joy in her heart join her eyes
[34:01] her husband and her had been set free
[34:03] from so many things but through the week
[34:04] she started to get burdened she was
[34:06] crying she come to you she said i'm just
[34:07] so burned i just don't know if i have
[34:09] the holy ghost i don't think i have
[34:10] anything and she's going on and she and
[34:13] and i say this respectfully but through
[34:15] some of the preaching
[34:16] it actually left the impression and it
[34:18] took everything away from her
[34:21] that god had already given her
[34:23] if you if you do this you don't have the
[34:25] holy ghost if you do this
[34:27] we have to we have to make sure we're on
[34:29] the word on those things cause she
[34:30] become defeated and so god just led me
[34:33] at that very moment as a pastor to just
[34:35] share this with her i said sister i said
[34:37] look in your you and your husband's
[34:39] lives the last three months only three
[34:41] months they'd come to the lord i said
[34:42] look at the change look at the
[34:44] transformation look how you've come from
[34:46] the things of the world you've come to
[34:48] god and you've come to this end time
[34:49] message look at the transformation i
[34:52] said sis who
[34:54] did that work in the last three months
[34:56] in your life and she said it has to be
[34:58] the holy spirit
[35:00] and i said sis if you know that this
[35:02] isn't some intellectual thing that the
[35:04] holy spirit's done that much work then
[35:06] you can have confidence that if you're
[35:08] lacking something if you still need
[35:10] something holy spirit stay with what god
[35:12] is giving you be thankful and stay in
[35:14] that flow because if you do lack
[35:16] something
[35:18] god is going to provide
[35:20] everything that you're lacking
[35:23] and i would rather instruct people
[35:25] that way
[35:26] than to have people constantly living in
[35:29] a constant fear
[35:31] that somehow i just don't have it now
[35:34] there's some people of course that don't
[35:36] have it and if you look enough to the
[35:38] word of god it's going to show you you
[35:40] lack something you need to hunger for
[35:41] more of god and you don't have the new
[35:43] birth yet
[35:45] but i don't like this of taking certain
[35:48] things of sanctification different
[35:49] things and
[35:50] that brings people under bondage i think
[35:53] when you're planted by the rivers of
[35:54] living water when your life is planted
[35:57] in the right place and you stay there
[35:58] and you're away from the influences you
[36:00] set yourself as a candidate to receive
[36:03] all that god has for you and if you're
[36:05] lacking the holy ghost there's things
[36:07] you can do to obey him and stay close to
[36:09] him he's gonna give you it's god's not
[36:11] standing back saying oh i just hold it
[36:13] back from him i'll hold the holy ghost
[36:14] back i keep god's not playing games like
[36:16] that
[36:18] god's not god's looking for a hunger in
[36:20] your heart and and jesus refers to it he
[36:23] says a father when he sees his child
[36:25] needs something would he not
[36:28] give that to his child when they ever
[36:30] have a need and he said so much more is
[36:32] the father wanting to give the holy
[36:34] ghost to his children god's not trying
[36:36] to hold it back from you you set
[36:37] yourself from the right atmosphere and
[36:39] you show your hunger to god say god i
[36:41] need more of you he'll finish the work
[36:43] in you
[36:44] he'll steal you by the holy ghost
[36:48] so but look at this love
[36:50] look at this love look at the time right
[36:52] now
[36:53] 1209. no don't look at the time i got
[36:55] plenty of time
[36:57] look at the perfect love he says
[36:59] what were you i pray you're listening to
[37:02] me
[37:03] so he says that look at your life
[37:07] uh he says
[37:08] he said no man can come to me except
[37:12] the father draws him first and god came
[37:14] down in that muck what you were and
[37:16] sought you out and brought you out that
[37:17] ought to create a perfect love look what
[37:19] you was
[37:20] and then look what you are
[37:22] what did that somebody that loves you
[37:26] can't you have faith in what you are
[37:29] what did that somebody that loves you
[37:31] can't you have faith in what he's
[37:32] promised you then real genuine love will
[37:35] create a confidence in his word
[37:38] he caught me when i was nothing i'm
[37:39] still nothing but i'm in his hand you
[37:41] see he caught me he loved me when i was
[37:44] unlovable he loved you when he was
[37:46] unlovable but he changed me just like
[37:48] the colored sister that said one time in
[37:50] her testimony she said i'm not what i
[37:52] ought to be and i'm not what i want to
[37:54] be then i'm not what i used to be and
[37:56] she knowed she had come from somewhere
[37:58] something happened and that's the way it
[38:01] is if god when i was an alien from him
[38:03] so loved me till he stooped down to get
[38:05] me and pick me up that gives me
[38:07] confidence that he wants to use me he's
[38:10] got a purpose in doing it he's seen
[38:12] something in me he's seen something in
[38:14] you he had a reason to save you look at
[38:17] the people that's unsaved today look at
[38:18] the millions he could have took beside
[38:20] you but he took you amen no one can take
[38:23] your place amen you're in god's economy
[38:26] no one can do it that's his love to you
[38:29] then won't your love
[38:31] reach back to him and there's a love
[38:33] affair no matter what the situation is
[38:37] its circumstances is governed by this
[38:40] love
[38:41] that creates faith that god loves you
[38:44] listen now that the subject is perfect
[38:47] faith how do we get to it to know that
[38:49] god loves you and that you love god and
[38:52] you love one another and that
[38:56] brings faith
[38:58] he didn't say fast for 40 days
[39:01] you've got to have a revelation to know
[39:03] how much god loves you and then that
[39:05] love reaches back to him and that love
[39:08] governs every situation in life i'll
[39:10] read it later perfect faith masters
[39:13] every circumstance
[39:15] that's why we need to live in perfect
[39:17] faith but where does it come where does
[39:19] it start a perfect love a genuine love
[39:22] knowing that god loves us knowing that
[39:24] he's called us knowing that he has
[39:26] whatever we need and this governs and
[39:28] and that god loves you you love god you
[39:31] love one another and that brings faith a
[39:33] revelation of the love of god loving him
[39:36] back is the creator of this perfect
[39:39] faith in our lives it's rooted in the
[39:41] love of god not in works not in just
[39:43] wearing the right thing
[39:45] not in doing perfect things no we need a
[39:48] perfect faith and that doesn't
[39:49] necessarily necessarily mean doing
[39:51] perfect things it's a life that loves
[39:54] him
[39:55] and others more than anything
[39:58] and what he pointed to in the beginning
[40:00] of the message then is a position so now
[40:02] i'm going to the beginning of perfect
[40:03] faith with some other things he points
[40:05] to to bring this perfect faith well he
[40:06] refers to jesus and jesus jesus had
[40:10] perfect faith because he knew his
[40:12] position he was positioned right because
[40:15] he knew his position and this created
[40:17] perfect faith
[40:19] so uh
[40:20] so so now
[40:22] what he pointed to was our position
[40:24] knowing our position
[40:26] then many times in the message
[40:29] brother branham read ephesians 1
[40:31] that has the term he's blessed us
[40:34] together in heavenly places so now you
[40:37] have our text that says this man this
[40:40] blessed man this godly man is planted in
[40:44] the right place beside the rivers of
[40:45] water
[40:46] then uh
[40:48] ephesians 1 says we're we're in
[40:51] we're heavenly places
[40:54] it's our position and brother bram says
[40:56] no what is the heavenly places it's the
[40:58] believer's position in christ it's
[41:00] knowing your position that brings
[41:02] perfect faith heavenly places are not a
[41:04] feeling or a sensation even though i
[41:06] felt the feeling of god i felt his
[41:08] presence i felt it in my flesh i felt it
[41:11] in my soul my spirit but heavenly places
[41:13] is not just a feeling or that type of
[41:16] atmosphere it's the believer's place and
[41:18] position in christ
[41:20] heavenly places is your position and so
[41:23] all this is about where you're planting
[41:24] your position then in psalms 92 12 he
[41:28] said the righteous shall flourish like
[41:30] the palm tree he shall grow like a cedar
[41:32] in lebanon those that be planted in the
[41:35] house of the lord shall flourish in the
[41:38] courts of our god i don't know if they
[41:40] have that scripture but psalms 92 12 the
[41:42] righteous shall flourish like a palm
[41:44] tree he shall grow like a cedar in
[41:46] lebanon those that be planted in the
[41:48] house of the lord shall flourish in the
[41:51] courts of our god
[41:52] they shall
[41:54] shall still bring forth fruit in old age
[41:56] they shall be fat and flourishing this
[41:58] goes right with psalms 1. it's those
[42:00] that are planted you have to be planted
[42:02] in the right place you have to know your
[42:04] position heavenly places in christ so
[42:06] many scriptures point to this position
[42:08] being in the right place being planted
[42:10] in the right place that's what perfect
[42:12] faith that's the perfect faith that
[42:13] we're called to you can have your faith
[42:16] built up temporary by testimonies a
[42:19] preacher can give testimonies and build
[42:21] faith that was our faith was built by
[42:23] brother baby sharing testimonies of
[42:24] god's supernatural
[42:26] power
[42:28] you can have your faith built up
[42:30] temporary by testimonies or by hearing
[42:32] the word faith coming by hearing the
[42:34] word all those things are wonderful but
[42:36] i'm talking about staying in your
[42:37] position and not having a temporary
[42:40] faith but a perfect faith that is stable
[42:43] that is planted when you use the word
[42:45] planted that means it's planted the
[42:47] roots are down it's there it's not
[42:51] rooting it up and moving constantly
[42:55] you can't spiritually do that and thrive
[42:58] well i'm kind of tired of this so i'm
[43:00] just going to do this for a few years
[43:02] and you root yourself up and no the the
[43:05] the plant has to be in one place and
[43:07] stay in that place this is the faith
[43:09] that i'm talking about
[43:11] knowing your position being planted in
[43:13] your position staying there
[43:16] not up and down but planted perfect
[43:18] faith and it's related to your position
[43:21] he says in the message perfect faith if
[43:23] you have those quote now remember they
[43:24] had the word he's talking about the
[43:26] disciples the word was laid flesh and
[43:28] the word told them i give you power
[43:30] amen just checking is the streaming
[43:32] working better now with everybody
[43:33] everything's clear okay good praise lord
[43:36] we have this recorded correctly here so
[43:38] if you want to go back to the first part
[43:40] if it was stumbling around you can
[43:41] listen to it on the archive later
[43:43] i'm glad it's working though i can
[43:45] preach another hour right
[43:48] no just kidding we'll try to wrap it up
[43:50] we can wrap the rest of the rest up with
[43:52] wednesday night but i'm glad it's
[43:54] working for you we'll just try to find a
[43:56] few points here and and try wrapping up
[43:58] but listen i pray it's encouraging your
[44:00] heart for this coming year
[44:02] we want that perfect faith but we have
[44:04] to see what it is
[44:06] that puts us in a position to be living
[44:08] in that every day
[44:09] remember the disciples they had the word
[44:11] and the word was flesh then and the word
[44:13] told them i give you power amen i give
[44:15] you power and they had the power but the
[44:17] disciples they didn't have the faith to
[44:18] operate the word that was in them
[44:21] see what i mean but jesus had it he was
[44:23] the word he had faith that that what he
[44:25] said would happen he said oh bring him
[44:27] here how long will i suffer you he had
[44:30] faith with his power how did he he said
[44:32] i can do nothing of myself why
[44:34] jesus he relied upon what he was he
[44:36] relied in knowing that he was the word
[44:38] and he had faith in god who made him the
[44:40] word he was god and they was in him and
[44:42] that give him faith because he
[44:44] understood his huh
[44:46] what gave him faith because he
[44:48] understood his position and that
[44:50] position didn't change he lived in the
[44:53] realm of perfect faith because he knew
[44:56] where he stood
[44:58] in his position with god
[45:00] that creates faith and you stay in that
[45:03] you don't let thoughts of the enemy try
[45:05] to make you doubt that position it's not
[45:07] a movable position god calls you to it
[45:10] you're planted in it and it never
[45:12] changes that's the kind of life we got
[45:14] to live
[45:14] but you see now when he's saying the
[45:16] disciples didn't have this perfect faith
[45:18] he had it the distinction was listen he
[45:20] said the disciples had power jesus had
[45:22] given him power and they had the word he
[45:24] was their word made flesh they had the
[45:26] word made flesh and they had the power
[45:28] but they didn't have the individual
[45:30] faith to move the power
[45:31] how many message believers maybe are we
[45:34] talking about today that have the word
[45:36] have the message
[45:37] have the power available but they don't
[45:40] know their position
[45:42] they're uprooting their you know they're
[45:44] they're not planted in the right place
[45:46] they don't know their position
[45:49] i tell you i'm praying for a stability
[45:51] in the saints of god i'm praying for an
[45:54] adoption
[45:55] a stability a maturity i'm praying i'm
[45:58] looking for the character of the kingdom
[46:00] to come in the people not of this
[46:01] wishy-washy and one day you're saved and
[46:04] one day you're doubting you're saved
[46:06] let's find a stability in the word of
[46:07] god and know who we are
[46:09] that's when we can fight devils when we
[46:11] know our position
[46:12] and the disciples had power they had the
[46:14] word but they didn't have the faith to
[46:16] move the power jesus had perfect faith
[46:18] and he had it because he knew his
[46:19] position in the word and moving down the
[46:21] quote quickly and so he understood his
[46:23] position he know what he was because the
[46:25] scripture had said he was this and here
[46:28] every scripture tied in to prove that he
[46:29] was exactly what the scripture said he
[46:31] would be and he knew what he was
[46:33] therefore he relied upon what god had
[46:35] made him and if he did that then can't
[46:38] we rely upon what god has made us as
[46:40] believers these signs shall follow them
[46:42] that believe how many believe that this
[46:44] morning these signs shall follow the we
[46:46] don't follow the signs but the signs
[46:49] follow us that really truly believe this
[46:51] word
[46:52] we believe in our position in the word
[46:54] thus the signs will follow
[46:57] that's what he said about us them that
[46:59] believe that's me my name's in there
[47:01] paul lafontaine is in there them that
[47:03] believe i'm one of those
[47:05] i'm one of them
[47:07] amen
[47:09] he had faith in what he was and if you
[47:10] are a believer you have faith in what
[47:12] you are you are a believer and if you've
[47:13] got faith in god the bible says over
[47:15] here if our hearts condemn us then we
[47:17] can of faith but if our hearts don't
[47:19] condemn us then we can have faith we
[47:20] have confidence towards god i'm jumping
[47:22] ahead to the next quote now see he knew
[47:24] who he was therefore he had faith faith
[47:27] could produce when he knowed what he was
[47:29] now if he if you abide in me and my word
[47:31] in you then you know who you are ask
[47:33] what you will it'll be given to you
[47:35] wouldn't that be wonderful tonight if
[47:36] everybody come in that prayer line
[47:38] listen to this now
[47:39] because this is interesting in in this
[47:41] message perfect faith at the beginning
[47:44] he actually says
[47:45] why are you coming in the prayer line if
[47:47] you have perfect faith why don't you
[47:49] just believe in there why are you coming
[47:50] in the prayer line he actually he
[47:52] actually challenges the people that if
[47:54] you had perfect faith you wouldn't have
[47:55] to come in that prayer line i'm not
[47:57] that's not my quote that's what he said
[48:00] and yet later on the message he says if
[48:02] you come to the prayer line he's
[48:03] referring to coming through a prayer
[48:04] line okay but this is how you should
[48:07] come in the prayer line not of course
[48:10] not out of fear and not out of
[48:12] imagination because he said at the
[48:13] beginning of this message he said the
[48:15] faith i'm preaching to you tonight is
[48:16] not an imaginative to faith it's not
[48:19] just presuming something no it's an
[48:21] anchored that faith is the substance of
[48:24] things hoped for the evidence of things
[48:26] not seen god has showed me i'm going to
[48:28] be healed
[48:30] amen so now he refers so he's not
[48:33] against prayer lines but he's challenged
[48:35] and so many times people start to lean
[48:37] on prayer lines people start to lean if
[48:39] that happens if this preacher prays for
[48:40] me your faith needs to rise and elevate
[48:43] to a place that in your seat or in your
[48:45] home even right now god bless you faith
[48:48] strikes your heart through the word of
[48:49] god being praised i know who i am i know
[48:52] i'm a child of god every sin is
[48:54] underneath the blood
[48:56] and every promise in the book is mine
[48:58] you can have that right in your home
[49:00] right now you don't have to come through
[49:01] a prayer line
[49:02] and sometimes i just get concerned about
[49:05] pushing that again that that's the
[49:07] ultimate thing but here he says if you
[49:10] come he says wouldn't that be wonderful
[49:12] tonight if everybody come in that prayer
[49:14] line and say because he's got i think
[49:16] he's going to have one at the end of the
[49:17] service
[49:18] here's what you say i am a christian
[49:22] i have no condemnation
[49:25] i know that my heart condemns me not
[49:28] and something tells me that tonight's
[49:30] the end of my suffering
[49:33] that you're going to do it lord you're
[49:35] going to do it you'll go away here with
[49:37] something no matter how much
[49:38] now listen to what he says now so that's
[49:40] the way to approach it that's the faith
[49:42] to have that's how you come in a prayer
[49:44] line i know i'm a christian i know every
[49:47] sin is underneath the blood i have
[49:49] confidence there's not one thought satan
[49:50] can put in my mind that i don't deserve
[49:53] this healing
[49:55] that's not even you know there's a fella
[49:58] giglio and he just put out a book
[50:01] and he says
[50:02] he's saying what why uh remember giglio
[50:05] is the one who did the the universe some
[50:07] of the videos we watched of him doing
[50:08] the universe he just put out a book and
[50:10] he says why do you
[50:13] why do you let the enemy sit at your
[50:14] table
[50:16] and he takes the scripture in psalms 23
[50:19] the lord is my shepherd i shall not want
[50:21] and then he ends that scripture of
[50:22] course you know what it says thou
[50:25] lord the shepherd you've prepared a
[50:27] table for me
[50:29] in the presence of mine enemies
[50:32] and he said he was saying now me if i
[50:35] was preparing a table for my people i'd
[50:38] do it in the presence of the king i
[50:39] would do it in god's presence i don't
[50:41] want to be around the enemy but god says
[50:42] i'll prepare you a table in the presence
[50:45] of thine enemies
[50:47] my what a powerful thing and it relates
[50:49] back of course to the mind and he was
[50:51] saying why are you letting the enemy or
[50:54] others
[50:55] a place
[50:56] at your table
[50:58] think about it
[51:00] why are you letting the enemy a place in
[51:02] you he doesn't belong at your table
[51:05] he doesn't belong in your thought life
[51:08] his thoughts are not considered you walk
[51:10] through that prayer line and say satan
[51:12] say you don't deserve this
[51:13] your thoughts satan aren't even
[51:15] considered i'm a christian
[51:17] god has promised this
[51:19] every sin is under the blood i stand
[51:21] here with confidence and i believe
[51:23] tonight god's going to do something for
[51:24] me
[51:26] that's the way to approach it didn't he
[51:27] say boldness before the throne of god
[51:29] humility but yet boldness we know who we
[51:31] are
[51:33] thou prepares the table in the presence
[51:35] of my enemies
[51:37] i could pre i preach on that a little
[51:38] bit wednesday night
[51:41] our thought life
[51:43] is meant to be a table of fellowship and
[51:45] our souls with god and god alone but you
[51:48] let others come to the table when they
[51:50] don't belong at the table you let other
[51:52] thoughts come and they don't even belong
[51:54] you got to cast them out casting down
[51:56] imagination in every high thing that
[51:59] exalteth itself above the knowledge of
[52:01] god
[52:03] he says then you're going to do you're
[52:04] going away with something no matter how
[52:06] much you come in emote now listen no
[52:07] matter how much you come in emotion now
[52:09] he's coming you come to the prayer line
[52:11] with just emotion a lot of people do
[52:13] this
[52:14] no matter how much you come in emotion
[52:16] how much you do it it won't work until
[52:20] that perfect faith has manifested and
[52:22] identified itself in you as a substance
[52:25] and when it's there there's nothing's
[52:27] going to shake you from it
[52:29] two approaches to a prayer line coming
[52:31] emotion
[52:33] an emotion will never do any good
[52:36] it's got to come by confident faith
[52:39] and then this last part says but jesus
[52:41] lived in a world that no one knew about
[52:43] known about he was an odd person he
[52:44] lived in a world of perfect faith and a
[52:46] perfect god in which he was if he lived
[52:48] in perfect
[52:49] faith of a christian to what we are we'd
[52:51] be a mystic to the world the people
[52:53] wouldn't understand you you'd walk in
[52:55] the spirit what the spirit said you
[52:56] would do what what it forbid you would
[52:59] you would do not do then the people
[53:01] begin to say you'd be a mystic person to
[53:03] them that's the way it is to all
[53:04] believers they're a mystic the people
[53:06] don't understand because they live in a
[53:07] world to themselves jesus lived in a
[53:09] world that nobody else could touch the
[53:11] disciples couldn't understand it when he
[53:13] spoke to them they they say this and
[53:15] they said that said and they said why
[53:17] you talking riddles we don't understand
[53:19] this how can this be see they wasn't in
[53:21] the world that he lived in i'm going to
[53:23] tell you believers congregation
[53:26] that same world that jesus lived in that
[53:28] same kingdom he lived in while he was
[53:29] standing there you're called to live in
[53:31] that kingdom you're called to live in
[53:33] that world to yourself psalms 1 1-3
[53:36] expresses where that man is living where
[53:38] he's planted he's living in a world to
[53:40] himself uninfluenced
[53:42] by the council of the ungodly
[53:44] uninfluenced not in the way of sinners
[53:47] not in the seat of the scornful he's
[53:49] away from all that and he's planted by
[53:50] the rivers of living water you live in a
[53:52] world to yourself of perfect
[53:55] amen look what he says now he says
[53:59] and so when a man lives by faith and
[54:01] walks by faith i mean substance faith he
[54:04] is isolated from the entire world and
[54:08] becomes a new creature in christ
[54:11] there now you're getting into bride
[54:13] material you see you're getting into
[54:15] rapturing condition
[54:18] hallelujah
[54:19] that's what we want
[54:21] that means for each one of us not just
[54:24] the pastor
[54:25] deacons
[54:27] trustees that means for the laity every
[54:29] individual walks in a world with god
[54:33] alone
[54:34] you're baptized into his
[54:36] what into a kingdom
[54:40] and there's nobody in there but you and
[54:42] god you see he gives the orders you pack
[54:44] them out whatever he says there's not a
[54:46] shadow of doubt nowhere you walk right
[54:48] on if the lord says this there's nobody
[54:50] in the world can talk you out of it and
[54:51] that's the friends that's the the
[54:54] friends that's what psalms 1 is talking
[54:56] about he's living in a world planted by
[54:58] the rivers of water and there's no
[55:00] council of the ungolli that can talk
[55:02] them out of it
[55:03] there's no google can talk them out of
[55:05] it there's no influence by ones who've
[55:07] left the message could ever talk you out
[55:09] if you're planted in that place nobody
[55:11] can talk you out of it
[55:13] if you can be talked into something talk
[55:15] to into something you can be talked out
[55:17] of it this is deeper than that now
[55:19] you're coming into he says now nobody in
[55:22] the world can talk you out of it you go
[55:23] right on just the same you're going
[55:24] coming into perfect faith perfect
[55:26] perfection that cannot fail that fail
[55:28] faith never fails and the last quote
[55:30] says now notice another thing
[55:33] perfect faith is the master of all
[55:35] circumstances perfect faith masters i
[55:38] would ask you to lift your hand if you
[55:40] want this how many would like to live in
[55:42] a kingdom and a world every day this
[55:44] year
[55:45] that it masters every circumstance that
[55:48] comes your way
[55:50] i don't care if it's cancer i don't care
[55:52] if you don't know what's going to pay
[55:54] the bills next week i don't care if it's
[55:56] emotional i don't care if it's
[55:57] depression i don't care if it's panic
[55:59] attacks that you can live in a world
[56:01] that i know how to deal with this i've
[56:02] got a god that can deal with this
[56:04] perfect faith masters every circumstance
[56:08] how many raise your hand said i'd like
[56:10] to live in a world like that
[56:12] because i can't master every
[56:14] circumstance i can't do it in myself
[56:16] there's things that's out of my control
[56:19] but i tell you there's things that's in
[56:20] my control because i have god living in
[56:22] me but it's all about where you're
[56:24] positioned and planted
[56:27] and let me finish this when you believe
[56:29] anything do anything you've got faith in
[56:31] what you're doing no matter what the
[56:32] circumstance is that don't have one
[56:34] thing to do with it see it masters that
[56:38] circumstance
[56:40] now
[56:41] now i wanted to get into the practical
[56:43] side of our text and we might have to
[56:44] leave some of this for for wednesday
[56:46] night now what are we at
[56:48] twenty to one
[56:49] so let me try to find a place to wrap it
[56:51] up i hope this is a blessing to you i
[56:53] hope it's an encouragement how about
[56:55] build your faith i hope you set you in a
[56:57] path to come to a life of perfect faith
[56:59] why do you want to live another year in
[57:00] fear
[57:01] why do you want to live another year
[57:03] just not knowing who you are
[57:05] why do you want to continue to live on
[57:07] the fence about things
[57:09] why don't you be all in lock stock and
[57:11] barrel and i say god plant my life my
[57:14] tree plant my spiritual life right
[57:17] besides the rivers of water and lord let
[57:20] me shut out the things of the world and
[57:22] let me live there this year every day
[57:26] what a what a goal what a new year's
[57:28] revelation
[57:32] i'm just going to quickly make this
[57:33] simple as possible
[57:35] why is this man in psalms 1 blessed
[57:39] prospering
[57:40] thriving why is he thriving why is he
[57:42] prospering
[57:43] it's where he's positioned himself
[57:46] first thing
[57:47] in his mind he is not open to just any
[57:51] influence number one
[57:53] when you take the council of the ungodly
[57:55] you think this doesn't fit with social
[57:57] media and all the access we have to all
[58:00] the new wisdom of the world and all the
[58:02] thoughts that come across your mind
[58:04] every day and across your phone
[58:06] and this applies
[58:08] the counsel
[58:10] the example of the ungodly
[58:14] is set before us all the time
[58:17] advice everybody wants to give their
[58:19] advice
[58:21] and everybody's an expert
[58:23] everybody has the final word
[58:27] fauci biden
[58:29] trump
[58:31] the cdc
[58:33] act as if they have the final word
[58:36] and people get on with their opinions
[58:38] and they act as if they have the final
[58:40] word of it your opinion is not the final
[58:42] word
[58:44] my opinion is not the final word on it
[58:47] and so this whole thing of the council
[58:50] of the ungodly a believer says now wait
[58:53] a minute
[58:54] i'm going to close i'm going to have and
[58:56] this is the term brother braham says in
[58:58] perfect faith
[58:59] he he
[59:00] he gives a deaf ear a deaf ear to the
[59:03] other voices
[59:04] that's the term brother bram says a deaf
[59:07] ear you know the deaf ear is and this is
[59:09] you know children when they
[59:10] you hey johnny you know hey you know and
[59:14] they they show a deaf ear to mom and dad
[59:16] they intentionally do it
[59:18] so it can be done right
[59:20] that shows children show us that you can
[59:22] give a deaf ear and you're not really
[59:23] deaf
[59:24] but he says you give a deaf ear to the
[59:26] other voices and this believer in psalms
[59:29] 1 gives a deaf ear to the advice and
[59:31] counsel of anyone that's ungodly i'm
[59:34] getting practical now why are you given
[59:37] a place at the table to weigh in in your
[59:39] life
[59:41] from the council of the ungodly
[59:43] they have no example in their life
[59:45] they're not growing in the lord they're
[59:46] going backwards and you're giving a
[59:48] place
[59:49] at your table and your thought life to
[59:52] the council of the ungodly
[59:56] he's not following their advice he's not
[59:58] following their example he's not get
[1:00:00] living on google
[1:00:02] to google information for the decision
[1:00:04] he makes
[1:00:06] i don't make my decisions just based
[1:00:07] upon a google search
[1:00:10] i'm not following the dating habits
[1:00:15] of the
[1:00:16] the show friends that i watch all the
[1:00:18] time
[1:00:20] a believer is not looking to his cues to
[1:00:22] how to date
[1:00:24] just dirty shows that bring
[1:00:27] sex and things so dirty
[1:00:31] believers not following the dating
[1:00:32] habits of the show friends or jerry
[1:00:34] seinfeld or the big bang theory i only
[1:00:37] mention these very few things is because
[1:00:40] you say that doesn't have an influence
[1:00:42] on my life if i watch it but i'm here i
[1:00:44] already say it does have an influence
[1:00:46] and it's the council it's teaching you
[1:00:49] the counsel of the ungodly and you're
[1:00:51] watching it and listening to it
[1:00:55] say a lot more about it but he doesn't
[1:00:57] listen to the counsel of the ungodly
[1:01:00] i don't live on the advice of people who
[1:01:02] have left the message and formed their
[1:01:03] own life with what they want of the
[1:01:05] bible and what they want of the message
[1:01:07] if they want any of it i don't live on
[1:01:09] the advice of those people i don't look
[1:01:11] at the example of those people
[1:01:13] if this is some of your influence you
[1:01:15] will never grow to more faith this
[1:01:17] blessed believer is not influenced by
[1:01:19] those things he doesn't walk in the path
[1:01:21] of sinners to be in the path it's just
[1:01:24] to be around them it doesn't stand in
[1:01:26] the path of says he's standing he's
[1:01:28] around them he's watching what they're
[1:01:30] doing he's standing in the path he's not
[1:01:32] necessarily following them but he's just
[1:01:34] standing in the path watching what
[1:01:36] they're doing the path of sinners
[1:01:38] is that where your life is
[1:01:40] you're going to a message church but
[1:01:42] you're really just standing in the path
[1:01:43] of sinners on the internet and everybody
[1:01:45] else you're just standing there watching
[1:01:46] what do they do what fun are they having
[1:01:48] you're standing in the path of sinners
[1:01:50] you may not be going down the path but
[1:01:52] just standing there watching what
[1:01:53] they're doing
[1:01:56] not necessarily following but just
[1:01:57] standing watching what they do all day
[1:01:59] it's feeding on what they're doing
[1:02:03] i wonder what they're doing i wonder
[1:02:05] what's why but it's so much fun watching
[1:02:07] them do it just standing them watching
[1:02:10] them on their path which incidentally
[1:02:13] leads to a path to hell
[1:02:16] you don't want to watch people that
[1:02:17] aren't about to help
[1:02:20] nor in the seat of
[1:02:22] the scornful you know what i cannot take
[1:02:24] two minutes and talk about the seat of
[1:02:27] the scornful
[1:02:29] the mockers the scoffers the complainers
[1:02:32] the critical
[1:02:34] moping all the time finding what's wrong
[1:02:37] finding what's negative
[1:02:39] you associate yourself with people like
[1:02:40] that all the time you're not going to be
[1:02:42] positive about your walk with the lord
[1:02:44] you're not going to be positive so let's
[1:02:45] just leave this to wednesday night
[1:02:47] because i don't want to take two minutes
[1:02:49] on that part we need to talk about
[1:02:51] people that stand in the way of sinners
[1:02:53] we need to talk about people that dwell
[1:02:55] on the council of the ungodly and now
[1:02:57] you're sitting in the seat and this is
[1:02:58] you were standing in the way of sinners
[1:03:00] but now you're sitting in the seat of
[1:03:01] the scornful and if you don't think
[1:03:03] believers can sit there brother bram
[1:03:05] said himself i was sitting in the seat
[1:03:06] of the scornful one time when some
[1:03:08] pentecostals came into his church and
[1:03:10] they began to dance in his own church
[1:03:11] and he had a baptist background and that
[1:03:13] just didn't work he sat there he said i
[1:03:15] sat in the seat of the scornful
[1:03:17] criticizing these people getting out of
[1:03:20] order in church
[1:03:22] he was in the seat of the scornful so i
[1:03:25] want to elaborate on that of being
[1:03:27] around negative people and being around
[1:03:29] backsliders and being around people that
[1:03:31] are constantly negative that's not going
[1:03:33] to help you my brother that's not going
[1:03:35] to help your life they might even be in
[1:03:37] this church but it's not going to help
[1:03:38] you to stay around them if you can say
[1:03:40] an encouraging word and try to pull them
[1:03:41] out of it but most of the time you can't
[1:03:42] pull them out of it because they're just
[1:03:44] negative
[1:03:45] but you're not going to be in good shape
[1:03:46] if you hang around just those people all
[1:03:48] the time
[1:03:49] amen
[1:03:51] you're not going to be positive you're
[1:03:52] not going to have faith you're going to
[1:03:53] be confident in what god is doing you're
[1:03:55] not going to be a kingdom living in the
[1:03:57] kingdom when you're around the seat of
[1:03:59] the scornful and they just sit and
[1:04:01] criticize and they're they're constantly
[1:04:03] looking at things all the time from that
[1:04:04] perspective those people are not going
[1:04:06] to do you any good you're not going to
[1:04:08] prosper being around people like that
[1:04:10] may that be part of your new year's
[1:04:11] resolution revelation may that be part
[1:04:14] of your desire lord let me distance
[1:04:16] myself from influences that's plaguing
[1:04:18] my mind making me negative let me sit
[1:04:21] myself plant myself in the right place
[1:04:24] let's talk about that a little bit more
[1:04:26] in the next service let me jump ahead
[1:04:27] and say this blessed and happy and
[1:04:30] favored man or woman of god have
[1:04:32] intentionally positioned themselves away
[1:04:35] from people like that away from
[1:04:37] influences like that they have to in
[1:04:39] order to live in the kingdom and his
[1:04:42] passion his delight is in the word of
[1:04:44] god above anything else it's exciting to
[1:04:47] them they can't wait to get to church
[1:04:48] they can't wait to hear the word from
[1:04:50] the church they can't wait to open their
[1:04:52] bible they can't wait to read it it's
[1:04:54] not just reading it it's a passion for
[1:04:56] it this is this man in psalms 1. can you
[1:04:58] say amen and he doesn't let things get
[1:05:00] lodged in his mind it says he's not only
[1:05:03] not only does he have a passion for the
[1:05:05] law of god in the word of god but in
[1:05:07] that law
[1:05:08] he meditates day and night this is what
[1:05:11] he allows himself to think about all the
[1:05:13] time
[1:05:15] this is what he meditates about
[1:05:17] so i don't have a choice in some things
[1:05:19] i don't have control over some things
[1:05:21] but i want to tell everybody here i and
[1:05:23] you have control over our thought life
[1:05:28] see the devil's conviction you don't oh
[1:05:30] the devil is just bringing all these
[1:05:31] thoughts now you have control over
[1:05:33] you can replace good thoughts with wrong
[1:05:35] thoughts
[1:05:36] and you have to decide between what's
[1:05:37] imagination with satan's thoughts coming
[1:05:39] to you and quickly dismiss them not
[1:05:42] giving them a place at the table and say
[1:05:44] i'm going to replace it with
[1:05:46] perfect thoughts with good thoughts with
[1:05:48] wholesome thoughts think on these things
[1:05:51] and so i'm meditating on the word
[1:05:53] meditating what i heard sunday i'm not
[1:05:55] telling you what i heard wednesday night
[1:05:56] i read this yesterday in the bible just
[1:05:58] meditating on that this is the guy this
[1:06:00] is the brother this is the believer
[1:06:01] who's prospering
[1:06:03] it's a believer who's spiritually in a
[1:06:04] revival
[1:06:06] because he's not influenced by
[1:06:07] everything around him
[1:06:09] he switches out his thoughts back to the
[1:06:12] word he's thinking his thinking is
[1:06:14] directed his thought life is directed
[1:06:16] there are many things we don't have
[1:06:18] control over but he has control over
[1:06:20] what
[1:06:22] this man has control over what he thinks
[1:06:25] about
[1:06:27] praise the lord
[1:06:29] amen so much more here and i'm going to
[1:06:30] close it down
[1:06:33] you believe god
[1:06:35] has something for you this year
[1:06:37] you believe god has something deeper for
[1:06:39] you
[1:06:41] this this message is not just for a
[1:06:43] select few it's if you'll take a hold of
[1:06:45] it it's for you
[1:06:47] it's for you to live and revival it's
[1:06:48] for you to live in perfect faith brother
[1:06:50] brown wouldn't preach unless there have
[1:06:51] been a people that live in perfect faith
[1:06:53] a world to themselves
[1:06:55] unhindered by the things that's going on
[1:06:57] around him around them the world the
[1:06:59] conditions the the fear
[1:07:01] the the the pandemic
[1:07:03] the pandemic of fear
[1:07:06] the
[1:07:07] politicians who lie
[1:07:09] the lack of trust because if they're a
[1:07:11] politician ninety ninety percent of the
[1:07:13] time they're lying through their teeth
[1:07:15] they say one thing when they want a
[1:07:17] certain political agenda and the next
[1:07:18] time they say something completely
[1:07:20] opposite
[1:07:21] it angers me sometimes but listen i want
[1:07:24] to live out of that world
[1:07:27] sometimes people are so politically
[1:07:30] influenced more than what they realize
[1:07:31] because they're watching too much of the
[1:07:33] news
[1:07:34] but that's not the world we're called to
[1:07:36] live in
[1:07:37] we have a kingdom
[1:07:39] we're called to live in that kingdom
[1:07:41] we're called to keep our thoughts on
[1:07:42] that kingdom
[1:07:44] look at this fella look at your first
[1:07:46] devotion there that we sent as a gift to
[1:07:48] you gave us a gift to you if you haven't
[1:07:50] got it then we'll send it to you
[1:07:52] look at that first one and he talks
[1:07:55] about those just read that first one for
[1:07:57] the first of the year and then brother
[1:07:59] braham says in 1957
[1:08:01] i think when the church gets real cold
[1:08:03] this is on the back of your devotional
[1:08:05] we gave you and i'm closing on this
[1:08:07] i think when the church gets real cold
[1:08:09] and indifferent god's sheep ought to
[1:08:11] kindle excuse me god she's about to kind
[1:08:13] of hollow up together and pray for each
[1:08:15] other and the warmth of good christian
[1:08:17] fellowship oh it means so much david
[1:08:20] spoke of it in the first psalm blessed
[1:08:22] is the man that seth not in the seat of
[1:08:24] the scornful
[1:08:25] standeth in the way of sinners but his
[1:08:27] delight is in the law of the lord and in
[1:08:30] the law doth he meditate day and night
[1:08:33] and he shall be like a tree that's
[1:08:36] planted by the river water and his
[1:08:38] leaves shall not wither
[1:08:39] whatsoever he doeth it shall
[1:08:43] prosper i say blessed be the name of the
[1:08:45] lord that's my promise today if that's
[1:08:48] where i can live under this message that
[1:08:50] god has sent then i i want to live there
[1:08:53] i i didn't bring my goals up here and
[1:08:55] this afternoon i was supposed to talk
[1:08:56] about some goals
[1:08:59] with you and maybe we'll have a chance
[1:09:00] to do that at another time
[1:09:02] but i wish i had him to read something
[1:09:04] but i can tell you the main one that i
[1:09:06] wrote down
[1:09:07] is that i want to live in that world to
[1:09:08] myself and not be as affected
[1:09:11] by the voices and the
[1:09:14] negative
[1:09:16] the things that's around me i want to
[1:09:18] live in that inner world with the lord i
[1:09:20] want to live that perfect faith i don't
[1:09:22] want to keep losing sleep over things
[1:09:24] that really shouldn't have that much
[1:09:26] value to me
[1:09:28] i want to pray about things instead of
[1:09:29] worry about things
[1:09:31] i want to take it to the throne of god
[1:09:32] in prayer
[1:09:35] things that are emergencies we take it
[1:09:36] to god as we did today together for the
[1:09:39] needs of the congregation just got a
[1:09:41] request here christian slack that has a
[1:09:44] fever now so we're just going to pray
[1:09:46] for him
[1:09:48] and then
[1:09:50] there was another prayer request i
[1:09:51] believe that came in yeah
[1:09:53] solomon wanted to pray for lily as well
[1:09:55] who's not feeling well
[1:09:57] so if you would just stand there in your
[1:09:59] home and we'll go to prayer again and
[1:10:01] we're going to we're not going to worry
[1:10:02] we're not going to fear
[1:10:04] we have no fear i can tell you that
[1:10:06] though
[1:10:07] fear is being promoted i know that our
[1:10:09] leadership has said and i'm not afraid
[1:10:12] to say it because they've quoted
[1:10:13] themselves they said this will be a
[1:10:15] winner of death but i'm here to say to
[1:10:17] you if you lived in this place if you
[1:10:19] lived in this place in psalms 1 this
[1:10:22] will not be a winner of death it'll be a
[1:10:24] winter of life
[1:10:27] i'm here to not just predict but to tell
[1:10:29] you i can almost guarantee if you live
[1:10:30] in this place it'll be a winter of life
[1:10:34] and whatever comes my way if i get sick
[1:10:36] if i get covered if whatever happens if
[1:10:39] i should die did you know that really
[1:10:41] you're not going to die because
[1:10:43] christians don't die i'm helping some of
[1:10:45] you in your fear of death
[1:10:47] do you know that christians don't die do
[1:10:49] you know that they're anchored with the
[1:10:50] holy ghost that christians don't die
[1:10:53] did we forget that
[1:10:55] do you forget that paul says for me to
[1:10:57] live as christ and to die is actually
[1:11:00] gain
[1:11:01] if that don't deal with our fears i
[1:11:03] don't know what does you know why the
[1:11:05] world is under fear because they don't
[1:11:06] have that hope they don't have that
[1:11:08] revelation but i'm preaching to you new
[1:11:10] year's revelations and the revelations
[1:11:12] if
[1:11:13] to me
[1:11:14] to live is christ
[1:11:16] to die is gain its happiness its
[1:11:19] contentment
[1:11:20] its peace both ways

[1:11:25] isn't any sickness too big for god we'll
[1:11:28] pray you out of it but i don't have any
