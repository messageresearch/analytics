[6:23] stronger than bigger better stronger
[6:28] greater than biger better stronger
[6:35] greater better stronger greater
[6:41] thaner stronger greater
[6:48] than 2 Chronicles 29 verse
[6:52] 1 Hezekiah began to Reign when he was 5
[6:55] and 20 years old and he reigned 9 and 20
[6:58] years in Jerusalem and his mother's name
[7:00] was abah and the daughter of Zachariah
[7:03] and he did that which was right in the
[7:05] sight of the Lord according to all that
[7:07] David his father had done he in the
[7:11] first year of his reign in the first
[7:13] month opened the doors of the house of
[7:15] the Lord and repaired them now you got
[7:18] to know the reason that he had to open
[7:20] the doors and repair the temple and
[7:21] repair the doors is because they went
[7:24] through a cycle of rebellion against God
[7:26] under certain Kings and the temple got
[7:29] destroyed the temple was not taken care
[7:31] of and so the first year of his reign in
[7:34] the first month he opens the doors and
[7:36] begins to repair the temple and the
[7:38] doors and he brought in the priests and
[7:41] the Levites and gathered them together
[7:42] into the East Street and said unto them
[7:44] hear me ye Levites sanctify now
[7:48] yourselves and sanctify the house of the
[7:51] Lord God of your fathers and carry forth
[7:55] the filthiness out of the Holy place you
[7:59] see in verse 15 that they did it they
[8:02] gathered their Brethren and Sanctified
[8:04] themselves and came according to the
[8:06] Commandment of the King by the words of
[8:09] the Lord to cleanse the house of the
[8:11] Lord now we pick up just a a a similar
[8:15] theme over in the New Testament I
[8:17] believe it's 1 Corinthians chapter 6 and
[8:20] I'd like to add that in so that it's on
[8:22] our our minds as well this morning what
[8:25] know ye not that your body is the Temple
[8:28] of the Holy Ghost which which is in you
[8:30] which you have of God and ye are not
[8:32] your own for ye are bought with a price
[8:36] therefore glorify God in both your in
[8:40] your body and in your spirit which are
[8:44] Gods now there's a reason that he's
[8:46] saying uh have you forgotten to the
[8:48] Corinthians have you forgotten because
[8:50] if he says do you remember your body is
[8:53] a temple of the Holy Ghost if he's
[8:55] reminding them of what this Temple is
[8:57] for then that means we we can
[9:00] forget and he's going what don't you
[9:03] know that your body is a temple of the
[9:05] Holy Ghost and I'd say many of us forget
[9:08] sometimes what this Temple is for it's
[9:10] not for our own uses but it's to be a
[9:13] temple of the Holy Ghost and it's not
[9:15] supposed to be the glory just in our
[9:17] soul but he said glorify God in your
[9:20] body and in your spirit which are by the
[9:23] way
[9:25] Gods you're bought with a price the
[9:27] blood of Calvary you're not your own own
[9:29] can you say amen and so you can't rent
[9:32] out parts of your house for other means
[9:36] it all belongs to him it's been
[9:39] purchased by him if we forget that then
[9:42] we'll tend to allow the body to be to
[9:45] bring things in and then sometimes God
[9:47] has to remind us cleanse the house
[9:50] cleanse the body because remember it's
[9:52] for the lord it's a temple of the Holy
[9:54] Ghost we had been learning uh in some of
[9:58] the services in the
[9:59] past that there are certain things that
[10:04] we can say or certain actions that we
[10:08] can do that really please the Lord and
[10:13] uh some things that please the how many
[10:16] just would just agree together I want to
[10:18] do things that please the Lord I think
[10:20] all of us have that in common I I want
[10:22] to do things that please the Lord and so
[10:25] there's something about that but there
[10:27] are sometimes things that please the
[10:29] Lord and make him smile and make him
[10:33] very and actually moves his heart there
[10:35] are some unexpected things sometimes
[10:38] that please the Lord and uh I'm sure
[10:41] there are many people who uh uh Express
[10:44] that they want to please God and and
[10:45] that is a wonderful thing in fact
[10:47] something within us is you know there's
[10:50] something within human beings that
[10:52] hunger for approval uh we like to be
[10:54] pleasing when we grow up we like to be
[10:56] pleasing to our parents we like to be we
[10:59] we like to seek approval approval is a
[11:02] great hunger in people's lives they
[11:05] hunger to be approved of they hunger to
[11:07] be praised they they hunger to want to
[11:10] be pleasing to people matter of fact
[11:12] some people go to an extreme and they're
[11:14] called people Pleasers they hear they
[11:16] live their whole life trying to please
[11:18] people and usually at the end of the
[11:20] life if they don't change that they get
[11:22] disappointed because they're living
[11:24] their life trying to please people and
[11:26] they realize it's not possible to please
[11:28] everybody perfectly the way that you
[11:30] want to so then they need to come to the
[11:32] Lord because you see now it's not about
[11:34] pleasing people that's a nice thing but
[11:36] it's Lord what can I do to find the
[11:38] channel to be pleasing to my Lord and a
[11:40] lot of people are confident to say I if
[11:43] I know my Lord is pleased with me then I
[11:45] don't need to seek the pleasing of
[11:47] everybody else as long as I have his
[11:50] approval can you say Amen so but there's
[11:53] something that burns within us for
[11:55] approval to be Smiled On and people will
[11:58] burn themselves out sometimes their
[12:00] whole life trying to get a person's
[12:02] approval sometimes it's his parents
[12:04] sometimes it's a dad it's amazing the
[12:07] extent that people go to their whole
[12:09] life and they're doing all of this to
[12:11] seek the approval of their father seek
[12:13] the approval of their mother they live
[12:15] their whole life doing it or a boss but
[12:18] then we must be honest and say sometimes
[12:20] that can disappoint
[12:22] you sometimes that's disappointing so
[12:24] this hunger that we have to be pleasing
[12:27] and things and and and might as well say
[12:30] it that some of our social media in fact
[12:32] I could safely say a lot of our social
[12:35] media is a platform to feed people who
[12:39] are craving for
[12:41] approval they always had it but social
[12:44] media brought it to a new level because
[12:46] now they take that hunger for approval
[12:48] and they put themselves out there and
[12:50] they're trying to impress what they're
[12:51] doing with their vacations or whatever
[12:53] they're doing and so all of it is is
[12:55] feeding I've got to have more likes
[12:57] today in order to function I've got to
[12:59] have more people approving of me and man
[13:01] if you get a whole host of people behind
[13:03] you it's feeding something within you
[13:05] but but our Prophet has warned us is
[13:07] that we shouldn't take a holy hunger of
[13:09] God and try to fulfill it through other
[13:12] things we have to take our hunger first
[13:15] to the Lord can I get an amen this
[13:17] morning if we have a hunger for approval
[13:19] if we have a hunger to be loved if we
[13:22] have a a thirst within us I've got to
[13:24] have this we should go to Christ first
[13:27] for that approval we should go to Christ
[13:29] first and this young people listen to me
[13:31] because you can go to everyone you can
[13:33] try to seek it in a boyfriend or
[13:35] girlfriend you can try to seek it in a
[13:37] in a new car but that hunger has to be
[13:40] filled first in our Lord Jesus
[13:43] Christ and then everything else seek ye
[13:45] first the kingdom of God and then all
[13:47] these things will be added to it
[13:49] everything else has worth and has value
[13:51] to it because you sought the Lord
[13:54] first he has to fill that hunger for
[13:57] love can you say Amen
[13:59] it's to be liked it's to be popular it's
[14:01] to be seen and so to have that approval
[14:04] come from God would probably be the
[14:06] ultimate approval to have Christ
[14:08] approval to have his he we're pleasing
[14:10] him uh wouldn't that be the ultimate
[14:13] approval is that we have the approval of
[14:15] God and I might add to you this morning
[14:17] that the scripture says that uh speaks
[14:20] of our approval our ultimate approval
[14:22] from from God actually does not come
[14:25] from us doing things that we were
[14:28] actually ultimate approved and accepted
[14:31] in the Beloved the Bible says we have
[14:33] been accepted in the Beloved young
[14:36] people say I'm doing all this because I
[14:38] want to be accepted they don't know
[14:39] they're doing it sometimes but they want
[14:40] to be accepted but as far as God's
[14:42] concerned when Christ went to Calvary
[14:45] and he became our sacrifice when God
[14:47] said I approve of that sacrifice when he
[14:50] approved of Christ he approved of
[14:53] you I need a bigger amen than that when
[14:57] he accepted the sacrifice he accepted
[15:00] you and if you'll receive him that's the
[15:03] ultimate approval is that you're not
[15:05] trying to do things because we don't
[15:07] gain entrance into heaven we don't gain
[15:09] salvation by anything that we do we
[15:12] receive the free gift of Salvation can I
[15:15] get an amen this is a free gift and if
[15:18] it means God's approval he didn't come
[15:20] down and say I've got to check you out a
[15:21] few years before I approve of you he
[15:23] checked out our sacrifice and he said
[15:26] it's perfect and when he approved Christ
[15:29] he approved
[15:30] [Applause]
[15:31] you so where do we draw this strength
[15:34] from we draw it because we don't want to
[15:36] get into this thing of earning earning
[15:38] ourselves but there's also a scripture
[15:40] that says grieve not the Holy Spirit
[15:43] whereby you are sealed until the day of
[15:45] redemption so so how do you explain that
[15:47] you explain it by saying we are sealed
[15:49] until the day of redemption the Holy
[15:51] Ghost is a seal in other words you don't
[15:53] get saved every year at Camp you don't
[15:55] get the Holy Ghost every year at Camp
[15:57] when you receive the true Holy Ghost
[15:59] it's a seal it seals God in your soul it
[16:02] seals the devil out can you say amen and
[16:04] you're sealed until when till next
[16:07] year's Camp no you're sealed until the
[16:09] day of our Redemption it is an ultimate
[16:14] sealing but why does he say grieve not
[16:17] the holy spirit because even with a
[16:19] person with the Holy Ghost can grieve
[16:23] the Lord now that doesn't tamper with
[16:25] the approval that I talked about but but
[16:28] we we can do things to grieve him and we
[16:31] can do things to please
[16:34] him and I'd say we want to have the the
[16:38] our heart to say I want to find the
[16:40] things that please the Lord can you say
[16:43] Amen sometimes we invent our own will
[16:46] and our own idea this if I go do this
[16:48] this will please the Lord you better
[16:50] make sure you know God gets blamed for a
[16:52] lot of stuff that was his will and it
[16:54] really wasn't his will because you're
[16:56] seeking approval from the Lord so you
[16:58] lay out the point plan and say this is a
[17:00] good plan I believe this will bring
[17:01] glory to the Lord and then all of a
[17:02] sudden all of a sudden you realize at
[17:05] the end of a certain time did it really
[17:07] please the Lord look for the
[17:09] characteristics of the scripture that
[17:11] please the Lord look for the value of
[17:14] life in the Bible and in the word in the
[17:16] message of the hour what value is
[17:18] instead of making up our own ideas I
[17:20] could preach a lot more about that but
[17:22] sometimes we invent our own ideas of
[17:24] what pleases the Lord a lot of times
[17:27] it's dos and don'ts a lot of times it's
[17:28] outward things and if I do this this
[17:30] will please the Lord but we really need
[17:32] to seek the word about that so sometimes
[17:34] things that please him though are
[17:36] different than what we think it was
[17:38] quite a surprise are you still with me
[17:40] here this morning it was quite a
[17:42] surprise to Martha that day when Jesus
[17:45] actually praised Mary for choosing to
[17:48] just sit and listen to him Martha didn't
[17:51] think there was no value in what Mary
[17:54] was doing you know the story if you
[17:55] don't I better tell it cuz you can't
[17:57] assume everybody knows it they got
[17:59] together at the house Martha is running
[18:01] around oh we've got the Lord here this
[18:03] is like a great thing we've got to do
[18:05] this what meal are we going to have and
[18:06] she's in and out of the kitchen just
[18:08] running around the recent uh one of the
[18:10] recent series on chosen shows it very
[18:12] well does that very well and she's just
[18:13] nervous on running around all this and
[18:15] Mary's sitting doing absolutely nothing
[18:18] and that's frustrating to uh Go Get It
[18:21] Go Get It Done type of person and she's
[18:24] putting value in serving and doing
[18:26] something for the Lord but no value in
[18:29] sitting and listening to the
[18:32] Lord see how we get our values messed up
[18:35] just like sitting here today you know
[18:37] what this to me and it's not because
[18:39] it's Paula Fontaine but when you bring
[18:41] your family and you sit and you shut
[18:43] everything else out and you say I want
[18:45] to sit I want what the Lord has to say
[18:47] to me for an hour and a half two hours 3
[18:50] hours I'm not going to be that long but
[18:52] when you sit here and and say this has
[18:55] the most important value of the entire
[18:58] week above anything and Sunday is the
[19:01] first day of the week Sunday is only for
[19:04] worship it's only for rest it's only for
[19:07] Fellowship I set aside that day this has
[19:10] the highest value in my life what I
[19:12] could get in Revelation from the Lord
[19:13] has high value to
[19:15] it Martha didn't think so because she
[19:18] felt like doing something for the Lord
[19:20] has the greater value to it and she
[19:21] learned quite quite quick what Jesus was
[19:25] pleased with he was pleased with Mary
[19:27] thank you Martha for what you're doing I
[19:29] appreciate it but Mary has chosen the
[19:32] greater part today sometimes the
[19:34] greatest changes happen when you're
[19:36] sitting quietly obedient at his feet can
[19:39] you say
[19:41] Amen sometimes the greatest things can
[19:44] happen in quiet as you're sitting by
[19:46] yourself with your Bible and the
[19:50] message and could it be that the Lord
[19:53] after the whole week of doing everything
[19:55] else in your duties and what you have to
[19:57] do that you sit and you give the Lord an
[19:59] hour or two hours and you're praying and
[20:02] you're just it's undistracted time could
[20:04] it be the Lord smiles and is pleased
[20:06] with
[20:07] that above all the things that you're
[20:09] doing wow they're really they sent me a
[20:13] clear message that I'm first in their
[20:15] life the Lord and so now the greatest
[20:18] anointing I'm just to remind you the
[20:19] greatest anointing ever on a person was
[20:21] on Jesus and what did he do with the
[20:23] greatest anointing brother BR said he
[20:25] didn't run around the room shouting he
[20:26] sit and precious words proceeded out of
[20:28] his mouth that was a person with the
[20:30] greatest anointing on him that of ever
[20:32] any a human being Jesus had the greatest
[20:35] anointing and he sat quietly and
[20:37] precious words proceeded from his mouth
[20:39] if that's the greatest anointing we
[20:41] ought to be sitting and listening to
[20:43] that anointing we ought to see the value
[20:45] of listening to what Jesus is saying
[20:48] hallelujah so now a few months ago we
[20:51] were covering the seven things that God
[20:53] hates and even brother Steven TR is
[20:56] helping us with that uh the seven things
[20:58] that God and it was surprising to us to
[21:00] read in Proverbs the seven things that
[21:02] God hates we said well my we God hates
[21:05] this and God hates this and God hates
[21:07] smoking and drinking and drugs and God
[21:09] but you see when you come to those
[21:10] things it surprised us the things God
[21:12] really extremely hates sowing Discord
[21:15] among the
[21:16] Brethren it ended up being a lot of
[21:18] things that God hates that we didn't do
[21:20] so could it be the same way the same
[21:23] surprise as the things that please the
[21:26] Lord that they would be Sur surprises to
[21:29] in this age of adoption sons are really
[21:31] wanting to learn what pleases the Lord
[21:34] what really pleases the Lord adopted
[21:37] sons are sitting and saying Lord teach
[21:39] me what really pleases you because I
[21:41] want to live a life that pleases you in
[21:43] the adoption and the training of the son
[21:45] that's born in the family in that
[21:47] adoption process he puts him under a
[21:49] tutor all of his young years and so the
[21:52] tutor is training him and teaching him
[21:54] and then the tutor has to go back and
[21:55] give a report to the father how his son
[21:57] is doing oh he's rebellious he just
[22:00] won't listen he just he's he's got his
[22:02] own agenda and so what a terrible report
[22:04] to bring back to the father but then
[22:06] when he comes back and he can say he's
[22:08] matured he's listening he's applying the
[22:11] things he's you know what I can tell you
[22:13] in another year he's going to be trusted
[22:15] to entrust the entire Kingdom to him
[22:18] this is adoption because it's learning
[22:21] the things that please the
[22:23] Lord and when he came to Jesus adoption
[22:26] ceremony he come and what was the word
[22:28] heard from the Lord speaking there in
[22:30] the in in that mountain with Peter James
[22:32] and John what did he say this is my
[22:36] adoption now this is my son in whom I'm
[22:40] pleased that's right adoption is about
[22:43] pleasing the Lord but finding what
[22:45] really pleases him not our agenda what
[22:48] really pleases the Lord and so when we
[22:51] find out what a Grieves him then we stop
[22:54] those things and we find out what
[22:56] pleases him and there's just certain
[22:59] actions and there's just certain words
[23:02] that as we've been preaching on the
[23:03] third poll certain actions and words
[23:05] that can trigger moving the heart of God
[23:08] I want to be able to be in a position to
[23:10] say those things and do those action and
[23:13] you wouldn't even know it because God's
[23:14] invisible but sometimes then then we
[23:17] realize God was pleased with that
[23:19] decision God was pleased with one small
[23:21] things when someone takes a step towards
[23:24] the kingdom of God instead of stepping
[23:27] away from it sometimes when they take
[23:29] that step nobody hardly knows it but God
[23:31] knows it and he's pleased at every step
[23:34] you take towards the kingdom but when
[23:36] you see things in the word of God and
[23:38] they're not man's ideas but they are the
[23:40] word of God we offer up a heart God
[23:43] loves to see his children Embrace what
[23:46] they see in the word can you say
[23:49] Amen not out of Duty not out of law but
[23:54] this just because I love him and I want
[23:56] to serve him and I want to be pleased
[23:58] pleasing to my Lord so now uh you know I
[24:01] I want to take out of this 2 Chronicles
[24:03] a minute and uh it's it's something that
[24:06] I'm I'm actually doing double triple
[24:08] Duty studying here this week because we
[24:10] have the music conference coming up and
[24:12] we want to do a couple sessions there
[24:14] and we'll be talking about the purpose
[24:16] of worship and the power of worship and
[24:19] music in worship and so as I was reading
[24:22] along in the scriptures related to music
[24:23] I come across this 2 Chronicles 29 and
[24:27] and and so here it is is that when
[24:29] someone like this King becomes zealous
[24:32] to see uh that his house is defiled that
[24:36] the Lord's Temple is is defiled and they
[24:39] want to seek to cleanse it and to begin
[24:41] preparing it for the glory of God
[24:44] there's something about that in the
[24:46] scripture when a person said I see the
[24:48] house of the Lord it's not where it
[24:50] should be and I want to cleanse it and
[24:53] prepare it for God's glory this pleases
[24:57] the Lord
[24:58] but if you read your Bible if you're a
[25:00] Bible reader you read through this
[25:02] section of kings and it's it's very
[25:05] important to me because I see that God
[25:07] is making me a king and a priest through
[25:09] the word of God if we look at these
[25:11] years of Kings there were good Kings
[25:13] there were bad kings and this is outward
[25:15] worded at the very beginning of the
[25:17] scripture when he began to Reign
[25:19] whatever it was it says right away and
[25:21] he begin to rain at this age sometimes
[25:24] very young seven eight years old he
[25:26] begin to rain and then the next few
[25:28] verses say and he did that which was
[25:31] right in the sight of the Lord but then
[25:34] there was another one that says he did
[25:36] that which is evil in the sight of the
[25:38] Lord so their hearts determined what
[25:41] they would do to bring heathenism back
[25:44] in and guess what got affected more than
[25:46] anything that really displeased God when
[25:48] they begin to turn their heart and
[25:50] didn't do what David said and what
[25:51] pleased the Lord when they made that
[25:53] choice guess what got affected the
[25:56] temple right
[25:59] the temple got affected eventually the
[26:01] temple and if you're affecting the
[26:03] temple to bring wrong things in the
[26:05] temple that's everything to
[26:07] God can you say Amen you know you can
[26:10] try to do a lot of things make a lot of
[26:12] decisions but when your temple is
[26:14] affected God is
[26:17] concerned your mind is part of your
[26:20] temple so this morning don't go away
[26:22] saying it's just the soul and all this
[26:24] no your mind is a part of your temple
[26:26] your spirit your emotions are a part of
[26:28] of this Temple and so something can
[26:30] enter in if your heart becomes blocked
[26:32] towards God and you get a little
[26:34] something in there what becomes affected
[26:36] you become affected your temple becomes
[26:38] affected now you can whatever you do to
[26:41] other people but when you get affected
[26:42] and you lose this purpose of being two
[26:45] things a temple of the Holy Ghost and a
[26:48] a House of Prayer that's the purpose of
[26:50] the temple a temple of the Holy ghosts
[26:52] and a House of Prayer your prayers need
[26:55] to be affected in your temple so that
[26:57] you can get a hold of God how many times
[26:59] I've been preaching it in this hour our
[27:01] prayer is the most effective thing right
[27:02] now because we may not have the answer
[27:04] to a lot of problems but when I go to
[27:06] pray I want my prayer to make it through
[27:09] to heaven and this was the temple it was
[27:12] a house of prayer that was the purpose
[27:14] you're to be a House of Prayer you're to
[27:15] have a purpose and anything that
[27:18] squatches that freedom to pray and that
[27:20] Faith to pray and that that freedom to
[27:23] worship freely in this Temple God is not
[27:27] pleased so you can hide it all you want
[27:29] to but we've got to have people rise to
[27:31] the occasion only eight Kings out of 42
[27:34] were the ones that said I want to
[27:36] cleanse the temple I want everybody to
[27:38] sanctify themselves and I want to
[27:40] sanctify the temple we're going to begin
[27:41] going cleaning house we're going to
[27:43] clean everything else El that's wrong
[27:45] because the temple is important to me we
[27:48] need young people we need people to rise
[27:50] there are very few to say this Temple is
[27:52] important to God so it's important to me
[27:55] I don't just let everything come in my
[27:57] mind I don't just let any song come into
[27:59] my spirit I don't just watch any movie
[28:02] that's out there I am picky why because
[28:05] this is the Temple of the Holy Ghost
