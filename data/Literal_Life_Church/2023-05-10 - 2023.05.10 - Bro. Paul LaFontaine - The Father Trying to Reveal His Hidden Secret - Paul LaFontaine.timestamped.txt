[0:00] is the Lord will read a scripture couple
[0:01] scriptures tonight Luke chapter 10 and
[0:03] verse 21
[0:04] Luke chapter 10 and verse 21.
[0:07] in that hour Jesus rejoiced in his
[0:10] spirit I like reading that
[0:13] praise the Lord
[0:15] because there's another place that Jesus
[0:16] was troubled in his Spirit the night he
[0:18] was with Judas so Jesus had a spirit and
[0:21] kind of sometimes was affected his soul
[0:24] wasn't affected but his Spirit was
[0:26] affected he was troubled in his Spirit
[0:28] but here I want you to notice Jesus was
[0:31] rejoicing in his spirit makes you
[0:34] curious to know what he was rejoicing
[0:35] about in that hour Jesus rejoiced in his
[0:38] spirit and said I thank thee O Father
[0:40] Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou has
[0:42] hid these things from the wise and The
[0:44] Prudent and hath revealed them unto
[0:47] babes even so father for so it seemed
[0:51] good in thy sights so it makes the it
[0:54] made Christ rejoice and this is
[0:56] something that triggers and moves the
[0:58] heart of God and that is when he can
[1:00] reveal himself not through intellect but
[1:04] by Revelation and he can show his elect
[1:08] the hidden things
[1:10] it says it's refresh Jesus Spirit he
[1:12] said oh this is wonderful father I thank
[1:15] you that you've set it up this way and I
[1:17] always say I'm thankful he set it up
[1:18] this way because the the person with a
[1:21] higher IQ than me would be able to
[1:23] figure more of the word out than me this
[1:25] is not for the wise and prudent we don't
[1:27] figure it out here the Father the father
[1:30] brings it to your soul by Revelation and
[1:34] to his elect can you say amen and that's
[1:36] what made Jesus rejoice in his spirit
[1:39] all things he said all things are
[1:42] delivered for me of my father and no man
[1:45] uh knoweth who the son is but the father
[1:48] and who the father is but the son and he
[1:50] to whom the son will revealed now Mark 4
[1:52] is the other place that he talks about
[1:54] the hidden things and this is after the
[1:57] disciples were here asking them about
[1:58] The Parables he was talking about and
[2:00] you're familiar with this but I want you
[2:02] to look at it again tonight Mark chapter
[2:03] 4 and verse 10. he says it this way Mark
[2:07] chapter 4 verse 10.
[2:09] and when he was alone they that were
[2:13] about him with the twelve ask him of him
[2:16] the parable because he had just given a
[2:18] parable when he was alone with his
[2:20] disciples they asked him about the
[2:22] parable and he said unto them unto you
[2:25] it is given to know the mystery of the
[2:28] kingdom of God but unto them that are
[2:31] without all these things
[2:34] are done in Parables now notice the way
[2:36] he's saying it now is that is that there
[2:39] will be ones who catch the mystery the
[2:41] secret there will be ones who are called
[2:43] to catch the father's hidden Mystery of
[2:46] it and there will be ones that are
[2:49] called just to take the parable and see
[2:52] the parable and I don't know how all
[2:54] that fits as far as who's in what
[2:56] category I'm not I'm not allowed to put
[2:58] people in categories but there's a truth
[3:00] laying here that the mystery the secret
[3:03] he says it's given to the elect
[3:07] to know the secret the mystery singular
[3:10] mystery there and so he he says it that
[3:12] way in verse 10
[3:14] um excuse me verse chapter 4 and verse
[3:16] 10. and so he says it's unto you it's
[3:18] given to know the mystery of the kingdom
[3:19] of God but unto them that are without
[3:21] all these things are done in Parables
[3:25] that seeing they may see and not
[3:29] perceive and hearing they may hear and
[3:32] not understand lest at any time they
[3:35] should be converted and their sins
[3:36] should be forgiven them Father bless the
[3:39] study in the word tonight and we're
[3:41] thankful that you're a good God we're
[3:42] thankful what you're doing in our lives
[3:44] God you have just done so much and
[3:46] father you continue to do things and
[3:49] tonight we lift our voices in Praise on
[3:51] this Wednesday night we give you glory
[3:53] we give you praise we give you honor you
[3:56] are the mighty conqueror Lord you are
[3:58] you're a bigger God than any trouble
[4:00] that we would have you're bigger than
[4:02] any problem you're bigger than any
[4:04] mountain Lord and you're bigger than any
[4:06] fear that we we would have we just lay
[4:08] those things before you because you said
[4:10] cast our cares and our worries upon you
[4:13] for you careth for us Lord Minister
[4:16] through the word of God by your Holy
[4:18] Ghost tonight we pray as we commit the
[4:20] service to you in the name of Jesus
[4:22] Christ amen praise the Lord God bless
[4:25] you may be seated tonight
[4:27] God bless you each one so I want to
[4:30] speak tonight a little bit on the father
[4:32] trying to reveal his hidden secret the
[4:35] father trying to reveal his hidden
[4:37] secret and it's the mystery of the
[4:40] Kingdom that's given to the elect it's
[4:42] the singular Mysteries I'm going to pull
[4:44] out a few words here that I'll be
[4:46] speaking on but he says it's given to
[4:48] you not all the mystery now we would
[4:50] think the mystery's plural in other
[4:52] words there's Mysteries of the kingdom
[4:54] of God there's principles of the kingdom
[4:57] of God and uh and we know that Jesus had
[5:00] many things to say about the kingdom
[5:03] children and how they live uh examples
[5:06] are when he when he brought The Parables
[5:08] and The Parables expressed revelation of
[5:10] the last days The Parables expressed how
[5:13] to live in The Parables has written
[5:15] something but it has to do sometimes of
[5:17] how the children live and then you have
[5:19] the Sermon on the Mount which to me is
[5:21] preaching to the people principles of
[5:23] the Kingdom how the children of the
[5:25] Kingdom live you know what he talks
[5:27] about in sermons on the mount turn in
[5:29] the other cheek you know someone hits
[5:31] you turn the other cheek to them if if
[5:34] uh if it talks about lust and he talks
[5:37] about loving your enemies and he says be
[5:39] there for perfect as your father's
[5:41] Heaven is perfect be the chill the
[5:44] children of the Kingdom so in all of
[5:46] those things there's numerous mysteries
[5:48] about how the kingdom children live and
[5:52] how they the principles they live by and
[5:54] they're opposite of the what the world
[5:56] teaches you how many you know that
[5:57] Kingdom principles in finances in living
[6:00] in marriage every subject will be
[6:03] different than the wisdom of the world
[6:05] and so we cannot take our cues from the
[6:08] wisdom of the world but Kingdom children
[6:10] how many Raise Your Hands Say I'm a
[6:11] kingdom child of God and I'm interested
[6:14] in the things of the Kingdom so so we
[6:16] live different and Jesus taught us we
[6:18] live different so I want you to know
[6:20] this does it's not that we don't have
[6:22] Mysteries plural and principles plural
[6:25] of the kingdom of God but when he says
[6:28] it's given unto you no he says it's
[6:31] given to you know the singular the
[6:33] mystery so all of those things of living
[6:36] the principles of the Kingdom actually
[6:38] come back to one mystery that God is
[6:42] trying to get to you
[6:44] that's why to me the gospel is not
[6:46] complicated
[6:48] that's why the message is not
[6:49] complicated to me because when people
[6:52] become overwhelmed she said I got to do
[6:53] this and I got to do that and I got to
[6:55] do this and they they make it all this
[6:57] overwhelming thing I want to tell you
[6:58] tonight the father is actually trying to
[7:01] only get one main thing to you
[7:04] the father has been trying to get one
[7:07] secret one mystery to you and when that
[7:09] comes to you when the father gets it to
[7:12] you then you have something that just
[7:15] opens it all up and now the kingdom
[7:17] you're living in the kingdom and the
[7:19] kingdom principles and the Mysteries
[7:21] everything begins to open from there but
[7:24] if we go backwards and try to live just
[7:26] Kingdom principles and we block the
[7:28] father from getting the one main secret
[7:31] that we need the one mystery that we
[7:34] need then we're missing something huge
[7:36] because it's really one I know this is
[7:38] going to be strange to say this but
[7:40] there's because we we think God has so
[7:42] many things to show us and he has so
[7:45] many preachers and brother brother Paul
[7:46] has so many preachers coming in and
[7:48] there's so much that God wants us to
[7:50] know that's true but I want to tell you
[7:52] tonight God actually is trying to get
[7:54] you one main mystery and it's given for
[7:58] you to know it
[8:02] does that just help you settle down a
[8:04] little bit and feel more peaceful
[8:06] but he he's but he's trying to get a
[8:10] hidden Mystery to you and uh so uh
[8:14] there's multiple teachings
[8:16] and the message that God sent in the
[8:18] last days has multiple things of how a
[8:20] Believer lives never has there been a
[8:22] message to our generation that's so
[8:25] specific and there's so much of it there
[8:27] and yet here it's worded he's it's given
[8:31] to you to know the mystery singular of
[8:33] the Kingdom so really there's one main
[8:36] secret he's trying to get to you he's
[8:38] trying to bring the thoughts of it
[8:41] behind the mighty acts of God he's
[8:43] trying to bring the thought of God to
[8:45] you he's trying to bring his thoughts
[8:46] and brothers through was on that whether
[8:48] Stephen Sunday and what a wonderful
[8:50] message we had what a a thing that
[8:53] caused us to deep to think more deeply
[8:55] than we should because he mentioned one
[8:58] statement this is the way he said it he
[9:00] said the thought the thought is the
[9:02] father of the word he said the attribute
[9:04] and I just I went back and listened to
[9:06] just the part I had written it on my
[9:08] notes but this is the way brother
[9:09] Stephen said it the attribute of God
[9:12] that was in God before the foundation of
[9:13] the attribute you an attribute give rise
[9:17] to a thought the thought is the father
[9:19] of the word
[9:21] then it's a word so it's attribute it's
[9:24] thought it's word the thought is the
[9:27] father of the word we look in the
[9:29] scripture and say the Father the father
[9:30] and we get in our minds you know some
[9:32] some visible thing but Jesus says Jesus
[9:35] says you can't see the father
[9:38] so don't get in this thing father and
[9:40] then Solomon come up here it's a father
[9:41] and son and two separate persons you
[9:43] can't look at it that way
[9:45] I love it when he says that the
[9:47] Revelation because the thought is the
[9:48] father of the word
[9:50] Jesus said no man has seen the father
[9:52] but the son expresses them and the son
[9:55] is the word so the son expresses the
[9:57] father in every generation the son is
[10:01] the word expressed Jesus Christ and the
[10:03] father is the thought of the word and so
[10:06] he says the attribute gives ride rise to
[10:08] a thought thank you brother Stephen I
[10:10] know you're listening tonight God bless
[10:12] you the attribute gives right the rise
[10:14] to the thought the thought is the father
[10:16] of the word then it's a word the spoken
[10:19] word then becomes manifested and the
[10:21] manifestation is the image of the
[10:24] heavenly
[10:25] powerful and I like how he said it it
[10:28] loses nothing in the process
[10:33] glory be to God from the attribute to it
[10:37] passes down to it gets to the
[10:39] manifestated manifested thought to the
[10:42] the expressing the image of the Heavenly
[10:43] nothing is lost in the process and when
[10:46] it manifests in you and I brothers and
[10:48] sisters when it comes out in you and I
[10:50] it's the original thought and the
[10:52] original attribute that God said that
[10:54] you would be it loses nothing in the
[10:56] process now everything man creates it
[10:58] loses in the process it's hybrid can you
[11:01] say Amen but God's original thought of
[11:03] you you are in the mind of God in the
[11:06] process of thought can you say amen and
[11:08] then it's word can you say amen and then
[11:10] it's manifested and then it's bearing
[11:13] the image of the Heavenly it never loses
[11:15] its effect and never loses anything from
[11:17] it I say praise the Lord
[11:20] but tonight I wanted to slow down a bit
[11:22] and break things uh just a little bit
[11:24] more simple if I can and I I kept
[11:27] wanting to emphasize this quote after
[11:30] the last two or three services and I
[11:32] read it in one but I didn't put it up so
[11:34] hopefully they have it tonight I keep
[11:35] wanting to emphasize this powerful quote
[11:37] here saying the same truth that Jesus
[11:40] just said as I read to you but all this
[11:42] mystery is revealed only as he promised
[11:46] to his bride he's saying the same thing
[11:48] that Jesus said it's given to you to
[11:51] know the mystery but all this mystery is
[11:53] revealed only as he promised to his
[11:54] bride hell is against this truth of the
[11:58] revelation of this mystery not the
[12:01] Mysteries not all the Mysteries but the
[12:04] one mystery this is what Satan fights
[12:06] against
[12:07] hell is against this truth of the
[12:10] revelation of this mystery but the bride
[12:12] is standing on it that's her stand and
[12:15] then he goes into why do you hunger
[12:17] Church why do you thirst it's the father
[12:21] trying to reveal this hidden secret to
[12:25] you
[12:26] so it even goes back to our hunger and
[12:29] remember I've been preaching we try to
[12:31] replace with a hunger for God we try to
[12:33] replace it with everything else but
[12:35] there's one thing God's trying to bring
[12:36] to you and actually fills the hunger
[12:39] that you're looking for why do you
[12:40] hunger why do you thirst it's the father
[12:42] trying to reveal this hidden secret to
[12:46] you
[12:48] isn't it good to know tonight that even
[12:50] in our weakness God's not going to give
[12:52] up to bring his secret to the bride
[12:55] members
[12:56] he's going to keep trying and keep
[12:58] trying and keep trying and keep trying
[13:00] that's his agenda that's his that's the
[13:03] will for this hour
[13:04] he he says what the but you let so many
[13:07] things get it out of you you let your
[13:10] job oh nobody ever does that you let
[13:13] your wife you let your husband you let
[13:16] your children and this is a quote many
[13:18] of you know some may not know it but
[13:19] look at look at all the things you got
[13:22] the father trying to bring something to
[13:24] you
[13:25] and then you got this world we live in
[13:27] and we get distracted and that's the
[13:30] thing that holds up the process of God
[13:33] trying to get this hidden secret to you
[13:35] you let your job you let your wife you
[13:36] let your husband you let your children
[13:38] what's that saying to us there is
[13:40] nothing nothing more important than God
[13:42] in our lives can I get an amen there's
[13:45] no money there's no possession there's
[13:47] no house there's no new car there's
[13:49] nothing more important than God being
[13:51] the foundation of our lives and letting
[13:54] God bring this hidden secret to you
[13:56] people can go their whole lives and
[13:58] God's trying and trying but they they
[14:01] but they keep pushing God off or they
[14:03] keep being distracted they won't settle
[14:05] down long enough for God to get the main
[14:07] thing that he needs to get to them they
[14:09] won't settle down and but I'll tell you
[14:11] I was thinking about today I was telling
[14:12] brother Brandon in the office God has
[14:14] his time for you
[14:16] and if it's within a year of coming to
[14:19] truth if it's the very night you come to
[14:21] truth or if it's 20 years later if
[14:23] you're one of God's Sons and Daughters
[14:25] he's going to bring it to you he's going
[14:27] to keep trying that's why we can't have
[14:29] unrealistic expectations of people
[14:31] because everybody has a different time
[14:33] that they come that's why I said a few
[14:34] Sundays ago is that you got people
[14:36] realizing that they have don't have the
[14:38] new birth some people until 20 years
[14:40] later after being in this message being
[14:42] raised in this message and they're
[14:44] discovering wow I'm lacking the most
[14:47] important thing in my life but you know
[14:49] what praise the Lord praise the Lord
[14:52] and you can preach the greatest sermons
[14:54] but I can tell you that heart isn't
[14:57] coming to repentance until God leads
[15:00] them to repentance
[15:04] you can hear the best preaching in the
[15:06] world but if your heart isn't repented
[15:08] and broken and God doesn't move on you
[15:10] that you're sitting there and it's like
[15:11] water off a deck's back
[15:13] you're not getting what you need to get
[15:15] it's not the father getting that hidden
[15:17] secret to you it's all religion it's all
[15:20] put on it's all being forced how many
[15:22] people are leaving this message because
[15:23] this whole message is being forced to do
[15:25] something listen friends the father's
[15:27] trying to get his hidden secret to you
[15:30] that's what needs to happen
[15:32] but people can go for 10 years 20 years
[15:35] 30 years and all of a sudden bang
[15:36] something happens in their lives that's
[15:39] why you have to be patient with people
[15:40] pastors have to be more patient than
[15:42] anybody
[15:43] because I'm looking for everybody to be
[15:45] saved and filled with the Holy Ghost in
[15:46] one service
[15:48] I would love it
[15:51] but but I don't orchestrate this it's
[15:53] whether the father leads you to
[15:54] repentance
[15:56] see but you can open your heart more can
[15:58] you say Amen but the Bible says it's God
[16:00] that leads you to repentance you don't
[16:03] even have anything to do with that he
[16:04] has to break that heart and listen if
[16:06] you go and buck up against it for years
[16:08] God's got your number
[16:11] God's got your number God loves you
[16:14] enough and whatever time he moves on you
[16:16] he will use anything that he needs to
[16:19] use to get a hold of your heart
[16:22] and it's amazing what God uses sometimes
[16:25] to bring a person to True repentance
[16:29] but your children
[16:31] and their loved ones you're praying for
[16:32] you keep praying because they have their
[16:35] season
[16:38] they have their season
[16:40] you like most so many things get it out
[16:42] of you let your job you let your wife
[16:44] you let your husband you let your
[16:46] children you let the cares of this world
[16:47] all this is distractions and bucking up
[16:50] against or pushing away from the father
[16:53] trying to get this hidden secret to you
[16:55] and you let somebody somebody else get
[16:57] that out of you when you know that way
[17:00] down in your heart I love that friends
[17:02] you this is only a Believer now
[17:05] some a Believer that's called to this
[17:07] way down in your heart
[17:11] are you here tonight
[17:14] you know
[17:15] that way down in your heart you're
[17:18] thirsting hungry it's God trying to
[17:22] reveal it to you
[17:24] I see God's love
[17:26] I see God's love there
[17:29] it's the father trying he doesn't give
[17:31] up we give up
[17:34] it's the father trying to bring this
[17:35] hidden secret to you
[17:37] so he's got one main thing he's trying
[17:40] to get to us and there's two things I
[17:42] see in this quote Satan is fighting
[17:45] against this more than anything else
[17:48] this is the Revelation he can't stand
[17:51] this is what he fights against and the
[17:53] second thing I see in that quote is we
[17:54] let him Satan distract us from it even
[17:58] in the cares of life we let it be
[18:02] stopped of the father trying to get this
[18:04] secret to us trying to get this secret
[18:06] to us and you think you think what's in
[18:09] the news uh is is the main event that's
[18:12] not the main event
[18:13] I'm preaching the main event to you
[18:15] tonight
[18:16] it's the father trying to get this
[18:17] mystery to you
[18:19] the news is not the main event you think
[18:21] that the economy oh what are we going to
[18:23] do and you get worried about the economy
[18:25] and the housing market and all that and
[18:27] and I know it's crazy someone called me
[18:29] today about it it's I don't even
[18:31] understand any of that I understand how
[18:33] the interest rates are up so high and
[18:35] there's houses selling for 30 40 000
[18:37] more uh with four or five offers I don't
[18:40] understand any of that I'm not worried
[18:42] tonight about the economy can you say
[18:44] man I I'm worried about me being in tune
[18:48] with God
[18:49] more than the economy can you say man
[18:52] one fellow I was reading last week said
[18:54] I'm not worried about the world's
[18:56] economy I've got a hairline that's in
[18:58] recession I've got a belly that's in
[19:00] inflation and I'm in depression
[19:05] so I'm not worried about the world's
[19:06] economy
[19:07] I'm worried about me I'm concerned about
[19:10] me can you say amen I I don't want to be
[19:13] a distraction to what the Lord's trying
[19:14] to get to me can you agree tonight
[19:17] how many years we go through our life
[19:20] and we let things distract us from the
[19:22] father trying to get that secret to us
[19:24] trying to get something to us we're
[19:26] we're the culprit we're the one that
[19:28] stops it up but if I could just be
[19:30] released of all my cares and take my
[19:32] worries to the Cross can you say amen I
[19:34] see God I'm going to let you take care
[19:35] of that I'm going to work I'm going to
[19:37] try to plan my finances but I'm gonna
[19:38] let you take everything I'm not going to
[19:40] be worried about the cares of life as he
[19:42] said to cast your worries and cares upon
[19:45] Him He gave you permission to take your
[19:48] worries about this life and pray and
[19:51] cast it on him and he's going to work it
[19:53] out why because he has another Main
[19:55] Event the economy your finances is not
[19:58] the main event
[19:59] it's like that scripture that says money
[20:01] answereth all things you know what that
[20:03] means money it's in Proverbs money
[20:05] answer it means the end of every
[20:06] conversation is money
[20:08] that's the world we live in is the worry
[20:10] of money the worry of the economy the
[20:13] money answers all things and I'm here to
[20:15] tell you it doesn't answer all things
[20:16] it's not the main event it's not the
[20:19] most important thing in your life if you
[20:21] didn't have a dime and God was getting
[20:23] this secret to you then you'd be happy
[20:25] in the Lord can somebody say praise the
[20:27] Lord if you didn't have a house to live
[20:29] in if you didn't have a dime tonight if
[20:31] the father was getting that secret
[20:33] through to you and you were filled with
[20:35] the spirit of God living close to him
[20:37] you're a millionaire can you say amen
[20:39] that's the main event that's the main
[20:42] thing in our lives
[20:44] you let so many things get it out of you
[20:46] your job the money your wife your pastor
[20:49] you let so many things why because
[20:51] you're letting that be the main event
[20:55] the main event is the father trying to
[20:58] get a secret to you oh I'm glad he's
[21:00] trying to get it to me praise the Lord
[21:01] I'm glad the Lord won't give up on me
[21:04] when I give up on him amen so now I'm
[21:07] just going to take this tonight from a
[21:08] different approach in in relation to the
[21:11] father trying to get the secret to you
[21:12] and I'm interested just a bit of
[21:14] teaching here but I want you to really
[21:16] pay attention and hopefully it'll tie in
[21:18] for a Sunday and the last few services
[21:20] but I still had this leftover from a few
[21:23] Sundays ago and I want to take it from a
[21:25] different approach I want you to go to
[21:27] Exodus 19.
[21:28] and exodus 19 of course is the scripture
[21:32] after the the children of Israel had
[21:35] come out of Egypt and uh they had come
[21:38] across the desert and they had went
[21:40] through the different things and God
[21:42] performed miracles for them and many
[21:45] things happened then all of a sudden
[21:47] then when all that was uh kind of come
[21:49] to an end then there's there was an
[21:52] event here that uh in the process of the
[21:55] children of Israel several years down
[21:57] the road there's a process with the
[21:59] children of Israel that was something
[22:00] very huge that was going to happen now
[22:02] and I'll just tell you what it is Exodus
[22:04] 19 is when God begins the process of
[22:08] bringing coming descending upon a
[22:10] mountain and descending to the people
[22:12] for the purpose of bringing his word to
[22:15] them now that's the first part we know
[22:16] he's going to bring his word to the
[22:18] people now he has been a god of Miracles
[22:20] he's been a God that's put Pharaoh's
[22:22] Army in the Red Sea he's been a God
[22:24] that's spoken through his Prophet he's
[22:26] been a God that's provided bread when
[22:28] they needed food food he's been a God
[22:29] that's provided water when they needed
[22:31] water he's been a God that's provided a
[22:33] place for them to live even though they
[22:35] come across the desert he's been a God
[22:37] that they know that has many mighty acts
[22:40] but you see now friends God will not God
[22:44] has an agenda he has a purpose he wants
[22:46] to get something to us and so now in
[22:49] this process he stops and he's going to
[22:51] bring something through Moses from the
[22:54] mountain and he's going to bring his
[22:56] word to the people but tonight I'm
[22:58] hoping the Lord will help me let you see
[23:00] what the purpose of all of it was
[23:02] because it's not even that he would give
[23:04] us all of his word to live by and you
[23:07] just hold on you understand that in a
[23:08] minute so after several years let's read
[23:10] in Nexus 19 break it down after several
[23:12] years of the process with God now he
[23:15] comes to this huge moment and there have
[23:17] been public displays of God Israel has
[23:19] seen firsthand many things
[23:21] I want to say to you they have been
[23:23] keeping up the lamb since Abraham he had
[23:26] the people have been taught to keep the
[23:27] lamb up that's a quote that the prophet
[23:30] mentions in the token he said that night
[23:32] when the token came the blood the lamb
[23:35] they had always they've been keeping up
[23:36] the lamb
[23:38] but that then the Lamb's blood had to be
[23:40] applied to the door that night to pass
[23:42] death so you realize when he says that
[23:44] statement they had been keeping up the
[23:46] land he's talking about 2 000 years of
[23:49] church history that they have been
[23:51] believing in the lamb Jesus Christ
[23:54] they've been keeping up the lamb but
[23:57] this word coming from the mountain was
[24:00] something something deeper than that
[24:03] to bring us into a mystery deeper than
[24:05] that than just knowing that the lamb
[24:08] because they were bringing the lamb they
[24:09] had they had missed the Lost
[24:11] circumcision when they were in Egypt so
[24:12] when they come under uh in the land and
[24:14] come into Joshua then they brought back
[24:16] circumcision but tonight
[24:18] I want you to notice this event and
[24:20] here's let's just read it in the third
[24:22] month when the children of Israel were
[24:24] gone forth out of the land of Egypt the
[24:26] same day came they Into the Wilderness
[24:28] of Sinai Mount Sinai
[24:31] for they were departed from referendum
[24:33] and were come to the desert of Sinai and
[24:36] had pitched in the wilderness and there
[24:38] Israel camped before the mount so
[24:41] they're camping right beside Mount Sinai
[24:44] and there's a purpose in that because
[24:46] God's going to do a different event now
[24:48] okay and Moses went up unto God and the
[24:52] Lord called unto him out of the mountain
[24:54] saying thus shalt thou say to the house
[24:57] of Jacob and tell the children of Israel
[25:00] so God in the mountain tells Moses to
[25:04] tell the children children of Israel
[25:06] this
[25:07] principle
[25:09] God is going to speak to his people
[25:12] through a prophet
[25:15] don't you dare try to train to change
[25:17] that process
[25:19] he didn't change it in Jesus Christ
[25:22] Jesus was the ultimate prophet he was
[25:24] the god prophet
[25:26] but he said I'm going to speak and so
[25:28] here's what he said to the people verse
[25:29] 4 ye have seen what I did unto the
[25:32] Egyptians
[25:34] so that's a message when itself and
[25:36] there's some brothers more capable than
[25:37] me than bringing that whole thing of
[25:39] looking back and Miriam granber than
[25:42] tambourine when you see dead Egyptians
[25:45] floating in the water an entire Army
[25:47] that they were afraid and running from
[25:49] and you're looking no wonder Miriam
[25:51] grabbed the tambourine
[25:53] because you look back and see all the
[25:55] things that your habits all the things
[25:58] that are there floating in the Dead Sea
[26:01] dead can you say amen I tell you God
[26:03] knows how to deal with your enemy God
[26:05] knows how to deal with your habits
[26:07] what a rejoicing that was to look back
[26:09] and grab the tambourine and Shout a
[26:10] little bit because they can look and see
[26:12] that's all finished now and it's done
[26:15] oh my that's wonderful but he that's the
[26:17] first thing he says you have seen what I
[26:19] did under the Egyptians and how I bear
[26:22] You On Eagle's Wings and brought you
[26:25] unto who myself
[26:28] so now we're starting to get a picture
[26:30] of the mystery
[26:31] we're starting to get a picture of the
[26:33] purpose and all this God calling a
[26:35] prophet God bringing them out of Egypt
[26:37] which you know is the type of the world
[26:38] type of denominations the call in
[26:41] Revelations 19 I believe it is to come
[26:43] out of her my people to come out of
[26:45] church systems to the genuine atonement
[26:47] to the the truth to the full truth
[26:49] instead of limited Truth by
[26:50] denominations I pray every person would
[26:52] pray about that because there's a
[26:54] calling to come out to come out to full
[26:56] truth can you say Amen in the last days
[26:58] especially so so now you see then uh is
[27:02] I brought you but but what's the watch
[27:05] the mystery now I brought you unto
[27:07] myself there's a reason that God got rid
[27:11] of Israel's enemy there's a reason that
[27:15] God delivers you there's a reason that
[27:18] you take he takes you under his wings
[27:21] how many can say when you come to the
[27:22] Lord he just took me under his wings of
[27:25] protection I've been protected from
[27:27] things that I didn't even know I needed
[27:29] protection from but in the work God is
[27:31] watching over his people how many is
[27:33] under his wings tonight
[27:36] he's letting the people know it's been
[27:38] me and all this I destroyed Pharaoh's
[27:40] Army I destroyed your enemy and now
[27:43] you're under my wings and all of it had
[27:45] a reason to bring you to myself
[27:51] now therefore if you obey my voice
[27:53] indeed
[27:54] and keep my Covenant then ye shall be a
[27:58] peculiar treasure unto me above all
[28:01] people
[28:03] what is this mystery
[28:06] it's about them
[28:08] it's about who they are
[28:11] I'm setting you apart you're not like
[28:13] the world you're a peculiar people Paul
[28:16] picks it up in the in the New Testament
[28:17] he says you're a royal priesthood you're
[28:20] a holy nation A peculiar people I'm
[28:23] calling you listen there's there's
[28:25] nothing here in this mystery there's
[28:27] nothing here about God doing the
[28:30] Miracles and God displaying himself and
[28:32] God showing to the world his mightiness
[28:34] this is getting closer to what God does
[28:37] it for and that's to draw you into the
[28:39] third Bowl draw you unto himself can you
[28:42] say Amen draw you into being a peculiar
[28:45] treasure For Me Above All people for all
[28:48] the Earth is mine and ye shall be unto
[28:51] me a kingdom of priest and a holy nation
[28:54] these are the words which Thou shalt
[28:57] speak unto the children of Israel so I'm
[28:59] going to come back to that in a minute
[29:00] okay but Moses came and let me just skip
[29:03] yeah Moses came and called for the
[29:04] Elders of people laid before their faces
[29:06] all these words which the Lord commanded
[29:08] and all the people answered together and
[29:09] said all the Lord has spoken we will do
[29:11] and Moses returned the words of the
[29:13] people and the Lord and the Lord said
[29:15] unto Moses lo I come unto thee in a
[29:17] thick cloud
[29:19] the the Lord said unto Moses I'm coming
[29:22] to you in a thick Cloud that the people
[29:25] may hear when I speak with thee and
[29:27] believe thee forever and Moses told the
[29:29] words unto the people moving on you're
[29:31] still with me the and the Lord said unto
[29:34] Moses go unto the people and sanctify
[29:36] them today and tomorrow and let them
[29:38] wash their clothes and be ready against
[29:40] the third day now I want you to notice
[29:42] this I've been preaching on the third
[29:44] the three being the mystery I've been
[29:46] preaching on uh Elijah having three
[29:48] parts okay
[29:50] the the first part is Mount Carmel the
[29:53] second part was the juniper tree but the
[29:55] third part is when the really mystery
[29:57] was revealed in the third part and that
[29:58] was in the cave when he says I'm not in
[30:00] the earthquake I'm not in the wind but
[30:02] I'm in a still small voice
[30:05] he called them to the mountain in the
[30:07] third month
[30:08] and on the third day
[30:11] and he begins to do this the Lord will
[30:13] for the third day the Lord will come
[30:14] down in the sight of all the people
[30:17] upon Mount Sinai on the third day I will
[30:21] descend upon the mountain
[30:24] skip the verse 15.
[30:27] and he said unto the people be ready
[30:29] against the third day come not at your
[30:32] wives there's a third day again they
[30:33] come it'll come to pass on the third day
[30:35] in the morning that there were Thunders
[30:37] and it came to pass excuse me it came to
[30:40] pass on the third day in the morning
[30:41] that there were Thunders and Lightnings
[30:44] and a thick Cloud upon the mountain and
[30:47] a voice of the trumpet exceeding loud
[30:49] said that all the people that was in the
[30:52] camp trembled and the Moses brought
[30:55] forth the people out of the camp to meet
[30:56] with God and they stood at the nether
[30:58] part of the mount and Mount Sinai was
[31:00] all together a smoke because the Lord
[31:03] had descended
[31:07] the Lord descended upon that mountain in
[31:10] Fire and the smoke there of ascendants
[31:12] the smoke of a furnace and the whole
[31:14] Mount Quake greatly and when the voice
[31:16] of the trumpet styled along and the wax
[31:18] louder and louder Moses spake and God
[31:20] answered him by a what
[31:23] a voice now
[31:25] I I want to simplify this even for the
[31:27] children would be listening
[31:29] I want to I want to take out of this I
[31:32] want to draw out of this some elements
[31:33] simple elements of this
[31:37] uh ascending from God
[31:40] for the purpose of drawing the people to
[31:42] himself
[31:43] not that they're caught up in a miracle
[31:45] not that they're caught up in the
[31:46] Supernatural
[31:47] but now for the purpose of bringing his
[31:49] word to the people for the purpose of
[31:52] drawing and making them priests
[31:54] he knows in Revelations 5.
[31:57] they begin to worship when the book was
[31:59] opened when the lamb took the book he
[32:01] says thou has made us Kings and Priests
[32:05] so what's this mystery about this
[32:07] mystery is not about what God displays
[32:09] this is not about the public show of God
[32:12] this is what he's making the people into
[32:14] this is what this is an identity can you
[32:17] say Amen this is revealing the mystery
[32:19] of Who You Are
[32:21] and that's the most important thing to
[32:23] God that's why the father's trying to
[32:25] get this secret to you because you can
[32:27] dwell in all the supernatural things of
[32:29] God and still miss the reason why he
[32:31] sent the message
[32:35] you could be caught up in the cloud
[32:36] because you got a cloud here you got a
[32:38] cloud at the end time you could be
[32:40] caught up just with the cloud and that's
[32:42] not sure enough that's not an anchor
[32:44] enough
[32:45] that's not the full mystery of this can
[32:47] you say Amen you can stand oh I'm amazed
[32:50] at the cloud and you keep believing and
[32:52] looking at the cloud and all the while
[32:53] God's trying to draw his people near the
[32:55] Mountaineer and bring his word to the
[32:57] people and draw them to himself so that
[32:59] they can come into a kingdom of priests
[33:03] somebody say praise the Lord
[33:08] so there's elements in these this
[33:11] visitation that I want you to look at
[33:13] there's a lot of elements but I'm going
[33:15] to list some and then I'm going to go to
[33:17] our scripture for the end time and
[33:18] you'll see the same elements okay
[33:22] number one I should have put them on a
[33:24] slide but I'll just say them number one
[33:26] in this visitation of God this unique
[33:30] special visitation
[33:31] God is descending how many knows God
[33:33] descended
[33:36] there's a cloud
[33:40] something is thundering out
[33:43] and thunder in the Bible means
[33:45] something's being spoken
[33:48] so when he's thundering out God is
[33:51] saying something
[33:52] now the people hear the thunder and they
[33:54] see the shaking of the mountain but
[33:56] that's because God is saying some to his
[33:58] Prophet Prophet Moses when there's
[34:00] Thunder God's saying something
[34:03] and I tell you he's saying many things
[34:04] to Moses because he comes out of there
[34:06] with not only to the Ten Commandments he
[34:09] comes out of there with all kinds of
[34:11] things of how the people should live
[34:13] we're talking details we're talking
[34:16] everything that the law would give the
[34:18] people how to live how to live as the
[34:21] people of God it was so detailed right
[34:24] down to where the the clothes that you
[34:27] wear
[34:28] the interwoofing of certain clothes the
[34:32] distinction and the genders
[34:35] oh it was a detailed message it talked
[34:39] about what women should wear what men
[34:41] should wear it talked about how fast you
[34:43] drive on the highway the speed limit it
[34:46] talked about this giving back when you
[34:48] come through the border and all of a
[34:50] sudden you realize you've got something
[34:51] to take it back to the border and
[34:53] confess to you I mean it taught us so
[34:56] many things how a Christian should live
[35:00] you say man
[35:02] so now there's things thundering out in
[35:04] the mountain thundering out so we got
[35:07] God descending we've got a cloud we've
[35:10] got something thundering out God's
[35:12] saying something we've and then there's
[35:14] a prophet
[35:16] there's a prophet's voice there
[35:20] and
[35:23] and he's he's he's he's he's taken what
[35:26] God said unto him and he's going to
[35:27] bring it to the people he'd be God's
[35:29] voice to bring it to the people and as
[35:31] we said Sunday he'll he'll decode it
[35:35] he'll decode God
[35:38] if there's any fuzziness how to live a
[35:40] prophet will decode it
[35:43] so you got that you have multiple
[35:46] Thunders blasting out right close
[35:48] together it goes from okay it goes It
[35:52] goes from
[35:53] thundering and voices to one voice and
[35:56] one mystery one thing the father was
[35:59] trying to get to the people all right so
[36:01] here hold that right there that's the
[36:03] elements that happen in Exodus 19. okay
[36:06] now before we go to Revelations 10 and
[36:09] see the same elements I want you to
[36:10] notice something here in Hosea 6 and
[36:13] verse 2.
[36:14] okay in the middle of the Bible Hosea 6
[36:17] and verse 2 of Prophecy
[36:19] can you guys get it after two days
[36:22] will he revive us
[36:25] in the third day he will raise us up and
[36:29] we shall live in his sight now that's a
[36:31] prophecy for Israel but it's a double
[36:33] prophecy for the Bride of Jesus Christ
[36:35] after two days now a day with the Lord
[36:38] is a thousand years
[36:41] so this is the prophecy that says after
[36:44] two days after two thousand years when
[36:48] the third day come when we enter into
[36:50] the third day that's when I'll send a
[36:54] Revival that's when I'll raise you up
[36:56] that's when you shall live in his sight
[36:58] it gives us the time
[37:02] that God is going to breathe forth and
[37:05] bring forth his word to the people
[37:07] because for 2000 years now for the two
[37:10] days we are bound by Creeds and dogmas
[37:13] and all kinds of things but in the third
[37:14] day I'll revive you again I'll visit you
[37:17] again I'll descend into the generation
[37:21] so I wanted you to catch that because we
[37:23] had the third month in Exodus 19 we have
[37:25] the third day and here he prophesies it
[37:28] when he will come and do this great work
[37:30] again in the third day after 2000 years
[37:32] so look at us now in 2023 2000 years of
[37:36] church history it was during this time
[37:38] slot when God would have another not
[37:42] just another visitation like Exodus 19
[37:44] but actually the ultimate Ascension
[37:46] excuse me descending of God okay now
[37:49] we'll read it I want everybody even the
[37:51] teenagers to read it Revelations 10.
[37:57] the elements that I brought you
[38:00] listen for them
[38:02] Revelations 10 our day
[38:05] and I saw another Mighty Angel come down
[38:07] from heaven clothed with the cloud
[38:10] so you have a descending
[38:13] of the Lord
[38:15] say is that the Lord that means to the
[38:16] Lord what's the mighty Angel and he has
[38:19] a a rainbow it was about his head his
[38:22] face was actually where the sun and his
[38:23] feet is supposed to fire the description
[38:25] there is Christ the description he's the
[38:28] when you have a rainbow you have a
[38:29] covenant angel
[38:32] so it's not just another one of the
[38:33] Angels this is Christ The Mighty angel
[38:37] what's he doing
[38:38] he's descending
[38:40] at the end time okay so you have him
[38:43] descending the Lord descending you got
[38:45] the cloud there verse two and he had in
[38:47] his hand a little book open and it said
[38:49] set his foot his right foot upon the sea
[38:52] his left foot upon the Earth and cried
[38:54] with a loud voice as when a lion roared
[38:56] and when he had cried seven Thunders
[38:58] uttered their voices
[39:00] now yeah just like Exodus 19 you have
[39:03] thunders
[39:04] particularly seven Thunders
[39:06] so what does that mean
[39:08] God's going to say God's saying
[39:10] something
[39:11] God's saying something
[39:13] God descending
[39:15] there's a cloud
[39:17] and God's thundering out and he's saying
[39:19] something
[39:21] and when the seventh utters had uttered
[39:23] their voices
[39:25] I was about to write John was about to
[39:28] write him because
[39:29] if there's not something being said then
[39:32] he has nothing to write
[39:33] so this isn't this is a symbolism this
[39:36] is a this is the vision of the end time
[39:38] okay and the symbolism says Thunders but
[39:41] if it had just been Thunders he's
[39:42] hearing him my something's thundering
[39:44] out there no something's being said
[39:46] because John's saying get my note get my
[39:49] notepad
[39:51] and he starts to write this down back
[39:53] back in that time when he's on the
[39:55] island Patmos getting this Vision he
[39:57] starts to write because something's
[39:58] being said Mysteries are being said and
[40:01] the angel stuff said don't write it now
[40:05] it's not time for it right now
[40:07] but there is a time for it
[40:09] there is a time he's going to blast them
[40:11] forth he's going to have truly seven
[40:14] thunders of the voices of those Thunders
[40:16] uttering out right next to each other
[40:19] the right close to each other bang bang
[40:22] bang bang bang and there's going to be
[40:24] voices and there's going to be truths
[40:26] that come because the the the seven
[40:29] Thunders the seven Thunders are the
[40:31] Mysteries behind the Seven Seals the
[40:34] book had Seven Seals but when he
[40:35] Thunders it he's saying it can you say
[40:37] amen he sang the Mysteries behind the
[40:40] seals he's saying something
[40:43] right close together bang bang bang
[40:45] seven close together
[40:47] blessed be his name that's exactly how
[40:49] he does it in the end time so let's keep
[40:51] reading he says and they swear by him
[40:53] excuse me where am I at uh yeah verse
[40:57] four and when the seven Thunders that
[40:58] other voices I was about to write I
[40:59] Heard a Voice saying seal up those
[41:01] things that are seven Thunders utter and
[41:02] write them not and the angel which I saw
[41:05] stand upon the scene upon the Earth
[41:06] lifted up his hand to heaven so I'm
[41:07] going to skip down now to verse six well
[41:10] we read them also we'll read verse six
[41:12] and I swear by him that liveth forever
[41:14] who created heaven and the things that
[41:16] they're in our and the Earth and things
[41:18] that there and are and the Sea and the
[41:19] things which are therein that there
[41:21] should be time no longer and that's
[41:23] where the Prophet mentions no more delay
[41:25] in other words I'll come I'll reach a
[41:27] point where I will not hold this back
[41:30] anymore after 2000 years I'm gonna get
[41:33] this secret to my people somebody say
[41:37] praise the Lord
[41:38] the father trying to get his secret to
[41:40] the people
[41:41] I'm not going to hold this back anymore
[41:43] time no longer means no more delay
[41:45] that's it but you asked the question
[41:46] after he sealed it up and said don't
[41:48] write about it back in verse 4. you ask
[41:51] the question well when when one
[41:53] scripture and we read in Hosea says
[41:55] after two days after after those two
[41:57] days in the third day I'll start to do
[41:59] this I'll revive you I'll bring
[42:01] something to you this gives the time
[42:04] zone perfectly the time when he says
[42:07] when we say win verse 7 but in the days
[42:09] of the voice of the seventh angel when
[42:13] he shall begin to sound stop right there
[42:15] you've got you've got the Lord
[42:17] descending you've got a cloud can you
[42:20] say man you've got thundering out of
[42:22] voices Thunders and voices to the
[42:25] Thunders that's what it says
[42:27] you've got a voice of a seventh angel in
[42:31] those days that's going to utter what's
[42:34] being said
[42:36] but in the days of the voice of the
[42:38] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[42:41] sound
[42:42] the mystery of God should be finished as
[42:45] he had declared to his servants the
[42:47] prophets which tells me that he wrote
[42:50] this mystery in a lot of the prophets
[42:51] and what they were talking about in the
[42:53] Bible
[42:54] he's writing this because they were
[42:55] declaring it in mystery form can you say
[42:58] amen I like what brother Stephens true
[42:59] says it's it's not really a mystery when
[43:02] God when God reviews it reveals it can
[43:05] you say Amen when it's time when the
[43:07] father trying to get it to you he'll
[43:08] bring it to you
[43:09] but you see that he declared it to all
[43:11] his servants the prophets but there's a
[43:13] time through the seventh angel he's
[43:15] going to begin blasting it for us and
[43:17] when he shall begin to sound did anybody
[43:20] notice that the same wording as in Luke
[43:22] that we read at the beginning that he
[43:24] says this will be hidden from the wise
[43:26] and prudent
[43:29] and revealed to babes
[43:31] it's given to you to know singular the
[43:36] mystery
[43:39] isn't it amazing that you have seven
[43:41] Thunders you have voices with the
[43:43] Thunders you have many things being said
[43:45] but it Narrows down
[43:46] to one mystery
[43:48] Why didn't it say when the seventh angel
[43:50] speaks when he shall begin to sound all
[43:52] the mysteries of God should be finished
[43:54] and really they are but you see this is
[43:57] deeper than just a Doctrine or mystery
[43:59] being settled or the loose sins being
[44:01] tied together
[44:02] because Mysteries is the godhead and
[44:04] serpent seed and all the things that we
[44:06] got lost through the church and now God
[44:08] puts it together by the seventh angel
[44:10] can you say Amen do you think that
[44:12] brother Branham come up with it himself
[44:14] no let me make it clear God was going to
[44:17] use his seventh angel to tie the loose
[44:19] ends together he didn't have anything of
[44:21] himself and he said he studied things
[44:24] from other men's things he studied those
[44:27] things because and just because he
[44:29] studied him doesn't mean that he made
[44:31] them an authority to it God's the
[44:33] authority to it but he studied him
[44:35] because why he's called to tie the loose
[44:37] ends together now either he's the
[44:39] seventh angel or he's not the seventh
[44:41] angel but if he's the seventh angel
[44:44] then he's called to tithe together all
[44:46] the loose sins and the mysteries of God
[44:47] shall be finished the mysteries of God
[44:49] the the serpency what happened in the
[44:51] garden God all of it uh predestination
[44:54] it's got to be settled can you say Amen
[44:56] but even with all of that it's not just
[45:00] fixing Doctrine in the end time that
[45:03] God's trying to do
[45:06] and I'm gonna make a Rapture because
[45:08] I've come to all the Mysteries being
[45:10] revealed to me
[45:12] and I know them
[45:13] and so I'm going to take a Rapture I'm
[45:16] here to tell you that it all sums up all
[45:18] those voices all those things being said
[45:21] and blasted out comes to something more
[45:23] secret and that's a mystery
[45:26] being revealed to individuals
[45:29] is that okay
[45:32] because when you have a blasting forth
[45:34] when you have seven Thunders uttering
[45:36] and it's public and it's on tape and it
[45:38] goes out praise the Lord but when he
[45:41] says the third poll there's a part of it
[45:44] that's not going to be a public show
[45:49] so there's a voice within the voice
[45:51] there's a mystery within it that has
[45:54] only his bride members will catch out of
[45:57] that
[45:59] there's there's a there's a main event
[46:01] there's a main thing to happen
[46:03] just because it now is can you find it
[46:06] out can you find it by just everywhere
[46:10] no no it comes through the seventh angel
[46:12] but there's no guarantee that you have
[46:14] that personal walk with God and that you
[46:16] have that mystery revealed to you
[46:18] personally
[46:19] there's no guarantee of that just
[46:21] because you're in a message Church
[46:25] just because you read the books
[46:28] I think we should approach this so
[46:32] prayerfully when we feed on this word
[46:35] that we're saying God
[46:37] boy that's good I enjoying that but
[46:40] through these Revelations you're opening
[46:41] up to me there's one big Revelation that
[46:44] I'm looking for and that's who I am
[46:48] that's who I am
[46:50] because a lot of people have studied
[46:52] this message the wrong way is to become
[46:53] smarter than everybody else
[46:55] smarter than any other Church and their
[46:58] pride gets lifted up can you say amen I
[47:00] know more you can Peg it Peg it Peg it
[47:02] Peg I know this I know that yes and you
[47:04] can take it to scripture and tie you in
[47:06] Notch with the scripture and the quotes
[47:07] of the message praise the Lord that's
[47:09] wonderful but let me tell you there's a
[47:10] deeper mystery that needs to come to
[47:12] every bride member
[47:13] every bride member has to come to
[47:16] something deeper than that that's what
[47:17] I'm preaching on tonight the father is
[47:19] trying to reveal this hidden secret to
[47:22] you so under all of this if we'll sit
[47:24] quietly that's why I said a couple weeks
[47:26] ago and I didn't mean it to put anybody
[47:28] down but I know I have some people even
[47:30] in my own assembly hasn't even read the
[47:31] seal book hasn't even listened to it so
[47:33] this isn't a quota to reach but if I'm
[47:36] preaching to you that there was
[47:37] something blasted forth through the
[47:39] seventh angel you ought to take some
[47:42] time and sit quietly with your Bible
[47:45] and say Lord
[47:47] this is how you did it
[47:50] it's got a cloud this visitation has a
[47:53] cloud with it this has a voice with it
[47:55] it has a prophet with it the same as
[47:58] Exodus 19. you must have wanted me to
[48:01] hear something
[48:02] so my ears are wide open
[48:06] and I'm not going to go to a seminary to
[48:08] get this
[48:11] I'm not going to find this in the
[48:12] Seminary the Bible told us the channel
[48:15] that it would come through
[48:17] this is de-christianize anybody I would
[48:20] never do that someone received Christ as
[48:22] their savior praise be to God whoever
[48:24] they are I would never put them in Hell
[48:26] or anything like that that's crazy the
[48:28] prophet never did that
[48:30] but when Israel came to Mount Sinai God
[48:33] had something further to bring them can
[48:36] you say amen and after 2 000 years of
[48:38] church history and our Bible's even
[48:40] coming back to you God had something
[48:42] further to open in these Bibles to his
[48:45] people and it's the father trying to get
[48:48] his hidden secret to his people
[48:51] somebody say praise the Lord
[48:53] it's the father trying to heal so so so
[48:55] if you can go back to Exodus 19 we'll
[48:58] we'll say a few closing comments here
[49:00] tonight because this is all I want you
[49:02] to catch okay the importance
[49:04] of God the Father trying to get the
[49:07] father trying to get this hidden secret
[49:09] to you the channel he uses Exodus 19
[49:12] anybody wants to argue with the same
[49:14] pattern the same principle the same Lord
[49:16] descending
[49:18] in a cloud using a voice to do it
[49:21] thundering out something
[49:24] oh my friends God we don't have any
[49:27] right to change God's nature of doing
[49:29] something
[49:30] right so when he did it in Moses day the
[49:32] same nature he does it in today
[49:35] shouldn't this make us just hunger for
[49:37] all I know when I receive the holy ghost
[49:39] that my greatest evidence that I knew is
[49:41] this an incredible hunger for the word
[49:44] of God I just I couldn't get enough of
[49:46] it and actually it's it's my only even
[49:49] though my life has become busy it's my
[49:51] only joy and my Hunger is still there I
[49:54] want to know as I said Sunday he reads
[49:56] those little scriptures and Mike and all
[49:57] these prophets that in my early years as
[49:59] a Christian seems oh my goodness that's
[50:01] so confusing I said I I want to know I
[50:04] know what he's saying if it takes me
[50:06] weeks I'm going to keep reading it until
[50:07] the Lord shows me there's something in
[50:09] here for me this wasn't meant for the
[50:11] world this is meant for believers to
[50:13] catch the mystery of it can you say man
[50:16] now he offers salvation to anyone who
[50:18] would accept it I believe that that's
[50:19] what he said he's not willing that any
[50:21] should pair us but Jesus said it's given
[50:24] to you it's given to some to just keep
[50:26] The Parables it's given to some to just
[50:28] talk about Jesus yeah 33 years on the
[50:31] face of the Earth praise the Lord Christ
[50:33] is being preached why would we criticize
[50:35] when Christ is being preached don't
[50:38] criticize those people Christ if they
[50:40] only want to talk about the Christ from
[50:41] 2000 years old praise the Lord but
[50:43] there's some called to just The Parables
[50:45] there's some called to just the history
[50:47] but Jesus says there's a group that's
[50:49] called to catch the mystery
[50:53] and I just believe I'm one of them and
[50:56] so when I listen I'm going to listen
[50:57] closely when I turn that tape on when I
[50:59] turn that on my phone when I get that
[51:01] table on my app and I turn that on I'm
[51:03] all ears can you say Amen not to a man
[51:06] not to a man but a voice within the
[51:09] voice what do you want to tell me Lord
[51:13] not just how to live but show me who I
[51:15] am can you say Amen
[51:17] so I hope you see the parallel tonight I
[51:19] hope you see God Did It Again God
[51:20] descending again in this generation 1963
[51:23] can you say Amen but if you think it
[51:25] only happened in 1960 here you know
[51:27] that's when you begin thundering these
[51:28] out that's when he began this revival
[51:32] who are way down the road now but I
[51:34] really believe we should be coming into
[51:36] the third part
[51:41] we shouldn't be lagging behind
[51:43] and we shouldn't be going back
[51:46] we shouldn't be going back to
[51:47] Pentecostal message
[51:49] there's no rapturing faith back there
[51:52] are you listening
[51:53] to go back just to Azusa Street and
[51:56] we're not even going back just to the
[51:58] Pentecost 2000 years the original uh on
[52:00] the day of Pentecost we're only stopping
[52:02] there for a minute to get that Faith but
[52:04] we're going back into the very thoughts
[52:05] of God before the foundation of the
[52:07] world I'm not stopping just at the damn
[52:09] Pentecost we're going all the way back
[52:11] to what God thought of us before the
[52:13] foundation of the world our journey
[52:14] friend is this back to the mind of God
[52:17] it's not to go back to Azusa Street
[52:20] there's no rapturing faith there but
[52:22] it's to move into where these Thunders
[52:25] thundering out is taking us
[52:28] can you say Amen
[52:30] a little bit of teaching tonight a
[52:32] little bit of treaching actually
[52:33] preaching and teaching together
[52:36] so back to Exodus 19 and verse 4 you
[52:39] have seen what I did to the Egyptians
[52:41] and how I bear You On Eagle's Wings and
[52:44] brought you unto myself friends if I
[52:47] pray God can show it to you it's our God
[52:49] descending and saying my purpose and
[52:52] descending and bringing my word to you
[52:54] through my Prophet Moses is so that I
[52:57] can bring you to myself
[53:01] I'm bringing you to myself I don't want
[53:05] to be this distant God I'm descending to
[53:08] come near you and now I need you to come
[53:10] near me
[53:13] now therefore if you obey my voice
[53:16] oh
[53:17] that's what it is are you going to be
[53:18] his voice
[53:20] not just the voice of man not the voice
[53:21] of man but he said my voice
[53:24] are you going to be in my voice
[53:27] indeed and keep my Covenant
[53:30] if you do that ye shall be a peculiar
[53:33] treasure unto me above all people
[53:36] for all the Earth is mine and ye shall
[53:39] be unto me a kingdom of priest and a
[53:43] holy nation I said at the beginning in
[53:45] The Sermon on the Mount all those things
[53:48] teach in the Kingdom principles and the
[53:49] kingdom way to the Act and the kingdom
[53:51] how a Christian how the how the kingdom
[53:53] people act there's there's a kingdom
[53:55] marriage there's a kingdom uh a teenager
[54:00] there's a way a teenager lives in the
[54:02] kingdom of God
[54:04] so it's all the things of the kingdom
[54:06] and all that is great but he wants to
[54:09] make you a kingdom of priest yourself
[54:10] it's about identity it's about you it's
[54:13] about what he draws you inside of
[54:15] himself and shows you yourself and and
[54:18] this is what the mystery is is to make
[54:20] unto you a kingdom of priests and a holy
[54:22] nation these are the words which I spake
[54:24] unto the children of Israel so it's it's
[54:27] about the mystery is about identity the
[54:30] mystery is about drawing inside close to
[54:34] the Lord until that voice as you obey it
[54:37] and you stay close to it it draws you
[54:40] into positioning it draws you into this
[54:43] peculiar treasure unto him above all
[54:47] people it draws you into relationship
[54:50] with him it draws you into a kingdom of
[54:54] priest and remember later on in the law
[54:57] they had a priesthood they would they're
[54:58] the only ones when they come they're the
[55:00] only ones that come in the ark but this
[55:01] is foretelling what's going to come
[55:03] after the seals he have made us Kings
[55:05] and Priests he's given his mystery right
[55:07] here and yet later in the law they
[55:09] develop a whole priesthood only the
[55:11] priest could come in the Tabernacle so
[55:13] all that had to happen because it wasn't
[55:15] time yet for the for the true atonement
[55:19] so now you have preachers and ministers
[55:21] and all these you know government set up
[55:24] and rules set up for the people and
[55:26] dietary laws to live by because why you
[55:29] got to go another how many years before
[55:31] you get to the true atonement
[55:33] you know it's like the Law's got to keep
[55:34] these people in line the Law's got to
[55:37] keep their lust in mind and
[55:39] can you say Amen
[55:41] but there's something further coming he
[55:43] says it's it's a kingdom that I'm
[55:45] building a kingdom of priests where it's
[55:47] not just going to be a certain group of
[55:50] the Levites but it's going to grow into
[55:52] them recognizing and said the whole
[55:55] Kingdom of my people will be a kingdom
[55:57] of priests
[56:00] it's not going to be a select group but
[56:02] every bride member would be a kingdom of
[56:04] priests that's the mystery
[56:07] that's that's what he's trying to get
[56:09] bring us into that's the father what
[56:11] he's trying to get to you is that listen
[56:13] your identity is not in this world your
[56:17] identity brothers and sisters is not
[56:20] even what your father and mother told
[56:22] you that you were
[56:23] your identity is not in your past sins
[56:26] that was not your final say of who you
[56:29] are your identity does is not rooted in
[56:33] Psychology or what mental things can
[56:36] tell you or what the devil tells you can
[56:37] you say amount what you believe in
[56:39] yourself it's even deeper than your
[56:41] personality that God gave you
[56:44] it's deeper can you say there's a
[56:46] mystery of you being in this Kingdom a
[56:49] part of his kingdom can you say Matt and
[56:52] that attribute as brother Stephen said
[56:54] they actually what's the attributes of
[56:55] God it's you you're the attribute of God
[56:57] here I am being expressed tonight and
[57:00] you stumble over my flesh and I Stumble
[57:02] over your flesh but deep inside it's the
[57:04] attribute beginning to manifest more and
[57:06] more I'm a Son of God I was built for
[57:08] this I love this word I can worship can
[57:10] you say Matt I have no problem dressing
[57:13] the way the word says to because I'm in
[57:15] this Kingdom I'm a part I I am his
[57:17] kingdom so his kingdom principles are
[57:20] important to me because I am a priest
[57:24] unto God that's why I can witness that's
[57:26] why I can talk to people confidently not
[57:29] because I got a bunch of head knowledge
[57:31] but I that's why the other day and I can
[57:33] only tell my testimonies because I
[57:35] wasn't met too many other people this
[57:36] week I've been praying for other people
[57:38] but I grabbed what I grabbed the hand of
[57:41] Udi's mom who was weeping
[57:44] Udi's the one we've been praying that
[57:45] her sister gets the papers when was it
[57:47] on a Thursday she was at the house
[57:49] cleaning uh one of our airbnbs and I
[57:52] just grabbed her hand and her daughter's
[57:54] hand I said we're going to pray right
[57:55] now we prayed God opened the doors for
[57:58] their daughters to get here two days
[58:00] later she calls my wife and there she
[58:03] says I'm so crazy my mind they were
[58:06] excited I can't even go clean your
[58:07] houses today we're going crazy rejoicing
[58:10] because she got the papers today and
[58:12] she's coming this week
[58:15] I feel confident that I'm a life Giver
[58:18] I'm not here
[58:19] to be the image of some person of the
[58:23] world I'm here to be a kingdom priest
[58:25] for God
[58:26] I carry the name of Jesus Christ within
[58:29] me I know how to bombard heaven for
[58:31] needs I know who I am can you say amen
[58:35] that's the way he wants his people to
[58:38] live
[58:39] all that we would quit trying to measure
[58:41] ourselves by somebody on social media or
[58:45] somebody else in the church or some
[58:47] other more pretty person than you oh
[58:49] that we would stop that and look in the
[58:51] word and say God you have made me who I
[58:54] am in this Kingdom for a purpose
[58:58] who am I in the word of God
[59:02] you've made me a peculiar
[59:04] us a peculiar people unto you
[59:08] I'm not here to be a statistic I'm not
[59:10] here to manifest something else I'm not
[59:13] here to live like everybody else lives
[59:16] but I'm here to be a kingdom
[59:19] priests can you say Amen
[59:21] it's a pretty important position because
[59:23] you have access because when he broke
[59:26] the veil at Calvary and the veil was
[59:28] tore
[59:30] that means that that means that every
[59:32] child of God
[59:33] can come and approach God
[59:35] not just the Levites
[59:38] we have preachers
[59:40] you know we have a we have preachers and
[59:42] we have governments in the church we
[59:44] have trustees and all that but you know
[59:45] what that's just to keep things running
[59:48] here there's the church the church is so
[59:51] much deeper than positions and
[59:55] and we have the musicians and that's all
[59:57] important but listen the real calling is
[1:00:00] that we are a kingdom of priests we
[1:00:03] represent we hold the name of God
[1:00:07] we're different we're peculiar
[1:00:11] we're different on the inside we're
[1:00:13] different on the outside we don't do it
[1:00:15] to be proud we do it because Scott has
[1:00:17] made us different and he's drawn us unto
[1:00:19] himself you talk about the seals in 1963
[1:00:23] and all the message and I'm preaching to
[1:00:27] you tonight I'm bringing it to one main
[1:00:29] purpose that God's trying to achieve
[1:00:32] out of all that message it's the father
[1:00:35] trying to get this secret to you
[1:00:39] but you let so many things get out of
[1:00:41] you but the father is going to keep
[1:00:42] trying to get this mystery to you
[1:00:47] I love him don't you praise the Lord
[1:00:49] let's finish a few of these things on
[1:00:51] Sunday let's stand together tonight
[1:00:52] we'll finish the rest of this
[1:00:57] I just want you to catch Exodus 19
[1:00:59] tonight the parallel to the revelations
[1:01:02] 10.
[1:01:04] and see all those things in there the
[1:01:06] third month the third day the third
[1:01:08] mystery
[1:01:10] third poll
[1:01:12] God does many things many many things
[1:01:14] and then he did his mightiest thing in
[1:01:16] the third poll which is not a public
[1:01:18] show it's between you and God Alone
[1:01:22] father trying to get this mystery to you
[1:01:25] something that's happened that everybody
[1:01:28] said what's going on what's going on
[1:01:29] what's going on well God's doing a
[1:01:31] mighty thing but it's a secret thing
[1:01:33] Isaiah said who hath despised the day of
[1:01:36] small things
[1:01:38] who hath despised the day of small
[1:01:41] things when God secretly does a secret
[1:01:45] work when you get alone with him and
[1:01:47] when you're in communion with him he'll
[1:01:50] do things in you and I'll quote from God
[1:01:52] because I have some things in here as as
[1:01:54] then the message comes we'll bring it on
[1:01:56] Sunday
[1:01:57] before he would speak those seals his
[1:02:01] first message is God hiding
[1:02:06] in simplicity
[1:02:09] you know what the Lord is saying through
[1:02:10] that you know what the Lord's trying to
[1:02:11] tell us
[1:02:12] this whole thing that's going to happen
[1:02:15] it may blast forth on tapes
[1:02:17] but be careful that you don't interpret
[1:02:19] it be careful you don't over
[1:02:21] spiritualize it be careful you don't
[1:02:23] make it something that it's not
[1:02:25] because he will hide himself
[1:02:30] in these things and to find him it's not
[1:02:32] because you're going to a message
[1:02:33] convention it's because you have settled
[1:02:37] down into the word to hear his voice
[1:02:39] personally yourself
[1:02:41] when that happens in your rank
[1:02:44] ten thousand Fall by your left
[1:02:46] twenty thousand by your right it won't
[1:02:48] come nigh unto you
[1:02:50] because when all passes away you're
[1:02:53] connected to the voice of the Lord
[1:02:56] what can I say
[1:03:01] what more can I say
[1:03:03] you see why I encourage you to you
[1:03:05] personally even if your husband doesn't
[1:03:07] it you personally get in this word get
[1:03:10] in this message feed on it I'm
[1:03:12] emphasizing I've emphasized it for 35
[1:03:14] years but I'm emphasizing it more and
[1:03:17] more the end result the Practical advice
[1:03:19] that I give you at the end of all these
[1:03:21] is to try to show you the value of what
[1:03:24] God has sent us in the last days but if
[1:03:26] you're feeding on all kinds of other
[1:03:28] things on your phone your phone will
[1:03:30] bring your worst Temptation in this time
[1:03:33] right now
[1:03:34] your worst distraction
[1:03:36] lay down your phones
[1:03:39] get your Bible
[1:03:41] feed on this message and listen to the
[1:03:44] voice of God because the father's trying
[1:03:47] to get this head mystery to you
[1:03:50] that's trying to get it
[1:03:52] Heavenly Father
[1:03:53] I'm so thankful Lord that you have given
[1:03:57] me
[1:03:59] a place you know Lord how much I tell
[1:04:02] you that I don't know why you picked me
[1:04:03] to do this
[1:04:07] quite often I say it to you Lord I still
[1:04:09] don't understand why you you put me in
[1:04:12] this place
[1:04:13] or I'd rather come and be the loudest
[1:04:16] amenor and hear another brother
[1:04:18] preaching it
[1:04:21] Lord I want to stay faithful to you and
[1:04:23] I want to speak it just as honestly and
[1:04:26] encourage the people just as much as I
[1:04:28] can
[1:04:29] you have descended to our generation you
[1:04:33] have come down Among Us Lord
[1:04:35] you are revealing yourself and making
[1:04:38] yourself known
[1:04:40] help us not to be blinded
[1:04:43] by any other thing Lord
[1:04:46] open our eyes that we can see you father
[1:04:50] forgive us when we are distracted that
[1:04:53] quote that was read tonight that you let
[1:04:56] so many things get it out of you forgive
[1:04:59] us Lord help us to not have any other
[1:05:02] priority of our life that would be more
[1:05:05] important than our relationship and our
[1:05:08] fellowship
[1:05:10] with you
[1:05:11] [Music]
[1:05:13] we don't want to be in later sins we
[1:05:16] want to be a kingdom of priest unto you
[1:05:18] Lord
[1:05:19] show us who we are
[1:05:21] show us that we're A peculiar people
[1:05:23] show us that we're a holy nation unto
[1:05:25] yourself or you sent this message to
[1:05:29] draw your people close to you so you can
[1:05:32] speak to them
[1:05:34] said father whatever comes out of that
[1:05:36] Miracles and answering prayer and being
[1:05:39] a vessel used of you will give you glory
[1:05:42] for it but Lord we must stay close to
[1:05:44] you and your voice
[1:05:46] so that this world can see the final
[1:05:51] manifestation of Christ
[1:05:55] hidden in a people hidden in a people
[1:05:59] let them see Jesus in us I pray Lord
[1:06:02] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[1:06:05] ask it
[1:06:06] amen everybody said amen
[1:06:10] we're seeing a couple courses and
