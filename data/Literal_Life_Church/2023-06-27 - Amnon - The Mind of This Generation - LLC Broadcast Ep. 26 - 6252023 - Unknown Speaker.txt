you today thank you [Music] he is [Music] and I cannot whisper away what he said [Music] [Music] but [Music] when you listen ing [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music]

battle you want [Music] me [Applause] [Music] as a whole weekend [Music] [Music] like nothing [Music] foreign [Music] we go [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] never lost [Music] [Music] second Samuel chapter 13 and verse 1 and it came to pass after this that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister whose name was Tamar and amnon the son of David loved her and amnon was so vexed that as we said a couple Sundays ago this couldn't be true love because he was Vex there's no vexation in true love and the amnam was so vexed that he fell sick for his sister Tamar for she was a virgin an amnon thought now we're into amnon's thinking what's in his mind amnon thought it hard for him to do anything to her amnon thought it was hard for him to get to her it was hard for him to get to her why was it hard to get to her why was it he wanted to do this thing with her but he found it hard why did he find it hard because God had put Protections in place and if he were going to do something he was going to override all of God's boundaries and protections to do what he wanted to do and I want to talk about Ammon in this text about amnon it's kind of a strange section of the scripture to read and take a little series on it but you'll see the reasons why after a while it's a strange text to pull subjects from amnon raped Tamar he he was in the kingdom of God he was they were both from David they were they were part of the Jewish belief system and the Jewish belief system had a lot of laws and boundaries in place there and amnon would have had to override all of these boundaries and all these Jewish laws he wasn't a heathen now he was in the church he heard all these laws he knew what to do and he gets in his mind he's going to override all these things and he ends up raping Tamar you will hear a thread of the subject in these things related to sexual perversion you're going to hear that pop up and I will try to talk about it as tactfully as I can but it's something Satan does not not want us to talk about pornography is something Satan does not want us to talk about to brothers and sisters sexual temptation is something that Satan does not want to talk about but it was it's one of the undercurrents that Satan uses to defeat men and women and families and it's one of the undercurrents and where sometimes it happens where a family is exposed and it all comes out that sometimes it happens but there's there's probably a bunch of other cases where it never comes out and just Satan keeps everybody defeated because it hasn't come out yet I'm here to stand to stand against the enemy to talk about it according to the word of God so that some people will get victory over these things there's been such an onslaught of social media and the wisdom of this world and people are changing their minds on the scripture and changing their minds on the way they used to believe and changing so so so it's changing our thinking so much that that it actually changed normal biology and now biology normal biology of the of a man and woman normal biology of a man or woman has to bow to psychology that's the way he said it biology has to bow to psychology in other words something that's normal and natural now he so fills the minds that the mind overrides even normal biology and the mind says you're not a woman you're a man you're not a man you're you're a woman because of the spirit that goes with that so now you have to look at not only that where he begins to mess with the mind and then that psychology is the study of the mind and thinking and how it affects behavior and so he's messing with the minds to make it number one question and mock the word of God Satan is messing with the world's minds and guess what he's trying to mess with our minds to change our perception of the word of God and question the word and mock the word and say the word is out of date I want to say after I've said all these things this morning the word is never out of date but what is the main healing we need today I can tell you we need a healing of the Mind everybody ever suggests a healing line for for mental illness we've got a lot of mental illness on different levels I'm not talking about a person who's who's got a mental problem in the sense of a special needs I'm talking if we feed on things all these years we're not thinking sound anymore we're not thinking straight anymore there's a lot of mental illness going in that's why we have medicines for that now but I want to remind the devil this morning that our atonement was not only for physical healing not only to heal cancer but in the atomity went to Calvary for is for mental illness as well because he said I've given you I'm not giving you the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind people are not thinking straight anymore because they fed on too many things I encourage you put some of that stuff away and get into the word of God and let your mind be influenced by the word because if the balance of it is that you're feeding on social media in entertainments and a bunch of jokes and Tick Tock all these times and you're reading a little scripture with brother Paul Sunday mornings I can tell you your mind's going to be messed with your mind is going to be messed with even if it's decent stuff if that's all you feed on that's the mindset you keep and that's the way you start living time to lay some of that stuff down it's time to sanctify your life and say I'm going to give more to the word of God this mind is not a garbage can this nine is not for mush can you say Amen our bodies have become mush because of the foods we eat we're physically down because of the foods we eat how many know that but our minds have become mush too because we're what we're feeding on for amnon I want you to think deeply about admin here for amnon to carry out what he did in a rape it was a long time of his mind going unchecked and unaccountable there was a private feeding on things even if it was only his own Thoughts unchecked by the word of God it happened in his mind first now I don't think amnon in that day had they didn't have TVs they didn't have social media they didn't have pornography but something is something's going on there's no way that a boy could come to this point where his mind is going to is trying to think about ways to rape his half-sister without the mind being affected by something now the writers tell me because just two or three chapters earlier is when David himself fell in sin and if you think I'm going to talk about Adam to not go back to David because to me when you have a family some of this might have been a family situation that had taken over sexually and David's got dealt with by Nathan the prophet right but if that trickled down then it starts to go through the family and now you got a boy that's so messed up in his mind he's getting ready to find ways that he could be with his half-sister even if he has to rape her something happened and changed that boy's mind even living in a Jewish Community even being a son of David the king so listen now let's not be proud and say this stuff does not affect me I can I can click on this site I can do this I can listen to this mindset I can do this don't let's not be proud because they were in the Kingdom of David all of us would love to be in the Kingdom of David let's not get pride in the message and think this doesn't affect us I can dabble and it don't affect me it does affect us because our minds are just like everybody else's [Applause] I'm preaching to you I'm not preaching to somebody else I'm preaching to you your mind is just like their minds and if it's not submitted to God you're going to start living out what's been put in your mind in your thoughts amnon amnon here had to be unchecked and on accountable until it carried out what was there but here's the biggest deal that I want to preach today most never carry it out to that point of a rape I've seen a statistic last week that said less than one percent of sexually addicted people actually carried out to do an act it's all done in the realm of secrecy with their computer or their phone they're addicted they're Bound by it but it never goes as far as admin where he carries out a rape less than one percent carries it out you know when I read that you know what it told me that's the way the devil likes it because if it comes out then it's exposed you deal with it like David said Nathan dealt with it he lost a child over it of there's a big message but a lot of things don't come out and Satan likes that because it stays under under everything which means you stay Bound for years Satan does not like exposure sometimes it helps say oh my family we're going to be embarrassed this is going to come out sometimes it's better it comes out because sometimes there's a Deliverance but a lot of times there's not Deliverance when it's kept and nobody knows about it so he carried it out but less than one percent today carry out everything that's going on in their mind so they say completely Bound in their minds by what they fed on and they continue to do it not an act not adultery and that's why Jesus said whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after has already committed adultery in his heart already he's bringing it to a heart level amnon was vexed with a lustful eye and a heart towards Tamar but the pitiful thing is here's how I get to he seen it was hard to get to her and begin looking for ways to get around this huge protective boundary or boundaries Godly things in place normal things that would protect this virgin this generation has been changed in its mindset against the word and against the the boundaries and protections and The Godly order that's been set in place for a woman for a man for a family for marriage everything there's been some boundaries set in order and we should never let Satan mess with our minds to change those boundaries we actually should be embracing them more than we ever have we all should we we need to be getting hold of the word and saying if this hour at this closing seconds of time judgments hanging two things days of Noah days of lot we see it now we see the full manifestation of the days of Life the spirit trying to take our children you know we should be doing I'm clinging into this word and this message closer than I've ever been before I want to know it I want the preacher to preach it I want it I want to open up this message to my children and I'm not afraid of any quotes I'm going to read the quotes to my kids some of your parents are afraid to do that because somebody's planted in your mind to be leery of this that's the devil that's told you that this is the thing God said to us to be delivered how in the world could this boy that was grown up in a Jewish home and in the Kingdom of David could ever think of it's so hard to get through the way that I want her how can I tear this down this is hard what's hard is a life of sin what's hard is living in the world with no correct of love what's hard is to live a life with no corrective love that's a hard life is anybody listening this morning what's hard is dealing with consequences of lustful sin and addiction and other addictions that's what's hard that's what's really hard but this is hard to get what I want because of the protections over this girl that's what amnon thought so I did a little research and I'm going to say it real quickly now because I only gave myself 20 minutes but I'm going to say it quickly I did a little research so just to break this down there was a word a law in from Moses law because here they're in time the Ammon and David or the time of Ammon and David there was a law in the law of Moses of course that was against fornication and adultery so of course he's he's overriding the laws right he said uh do not you know she you can't have her until you marry her so I'm in his mind even though he grew up hearing the Ten Commandments he's overriding all of it that law doesn't matter anymore Anna knew that word and there were several other places his mind come to a place that he's ready to ditch all of those quotes of the Prophet to get what he wants mom but the law of Moses that said no fornication before marriage but there really doesn't wasn't anything specific about being alone with a person in other words here's the point I want to make the law said don't commit foreign don't commit adultery but there really is wasn't too many specifics in the law of Moses to protect you from setting yourself up for a fornication there wasn't anything in there or setting yourself up for adultery so as time of it and I don't know when they did it but they say the high court of David As Time moved on on the same conditions happen they realized we got to have some more laws here we got to have something else it's not an adding to the Commandments but it's advancing and and amplifying what the Ten Commandments say because we have situations that could happen and the first one they dealt with is that they made a law uh the high quarter of David and all the maid of law that was an expansion or a a amplification they made a law that was called that addressed yakud in the Hebrews yakud and yakud means uh seclusion it's to be alone so this was a law against yakud for married women and for married men in other words they said we know we're not supposed to commit adultery but if a married man or married woman they're not married to one another if they're put in a room and they're locked in there you have the potential of something happening so we're going to make a law no married woman or no man should ever be alone in a room together with the door locked it was in the Hebrew law it's going to represent the boundaries that I've been talking about that have been sent by God the protections the the laws the principles in the Old Testament there's statues there's principles there's laws there are four or five things mentioned there so this represents this this morning and so if we look at this as God's principles it's got a pointy head on it and if you leave it in this condition you only see it this way and somebody's bringing this up to you okay this is the way you're going to look at it he keeps probing and pointing at me like by that thing God's brother keeps nabbing at me this is God's principles it's God's law so that's why a lot of people start to look at it you're just being poked all the time and he's always saying something about it and he's always his ministry has always been that way poked and then but if you if you just say Lord let me change my attitude towards these principles let me change my attitude I want you to read Psalms 119 besides listening to flashing red light it was coming I want you to read the whole chapter Psalms 119 I don't have time to read it it's so wonderful because it's a man it's not amnon it's a it's David who's allowed his mind to be so changed that his attitude towards the statues towards the laws is completely positive Lord how shall a young man cleanse his way by adhering to obeying your principles and your boundaries read the whole chapter he Embraces all of them say Lord I've made mistakes I've fallen but I'm back I'm paraphrasing and I am determined to obey and follow your principles why because he didn't send him to be mean to us or to poke us and if we change our attitude the same principles change the same principles that were poking us maybe all your years in the message as a young child as soon as you change your attitude about it you'll see them all together different [Applause] yep the same quotes the same quotes that you Buck up against be careful could it be God given an awesome protection from the rains from the winds supposed to rain today maybe that's why I got this listen you say I don't need that I'll run here I'll say well you know if you do go without it you're going to be in some storms you're going to get wet you might even get pneumonia because something has been given to you for the protection of God we're all trying to serve the Lord here and you're all at different stages okay the only thing I ask for is be careful what thoughts you put in your mind and where it comes from that's all I'm asking today if you're feeding too much of that you're going to change in your mind feed on the word of God and then you'll know for yourself where this comes from Josh McDowell is the one that referred to this umbrella and he said it's always an act of Love on God's part it's always an act of Love on God's part to protect us and provide for us but when through an act of Disobedience by a decision of Our Own we ignore God's precepts we remove ourselves from the very protection and provision of those precepts there's power that comes from God's word there's power of protection that comes from his precepts it's not just laws but when we obey him power comes with it to watch over our lives let me just say this let's quit messing with the boundaries quit messing with the Bible let's quit questioning them you want to spend your whole life just questioning them you want to know more why where they come from praise the Lord research it but let's stop messing with them and letting Satan mess with our minds God give us a sound mind a clear mind God give us more of a love for his precepts thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information please contact us by visiting our website literallife.church and if
