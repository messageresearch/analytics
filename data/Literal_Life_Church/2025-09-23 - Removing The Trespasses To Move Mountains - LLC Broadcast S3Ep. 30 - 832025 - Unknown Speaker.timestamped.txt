[0:35] If my life would sing a song,
[0:40] [Music]
[0:42] if I have a testimony,
[0:50] if I have anything at all,
[0:54] [Music]
[0:59] No one ever
[1:03] like
[1:08] &gt;&gt; his faithful hand
[1:11] me all this way.
[1:15] And when I'm old and gray, all my days
[1:20] are numbered on the earth. Let it be
[1:24] known
[1:26] in you alone
[1:30] my joy was found.
[1:38] Lord, you are my joy.
[1:42] [Music]
[1:45] Let my children tell their children.
[1:50] [Music]
[1:52] And let this be their memory.
[1:58] [Music]
[1:59] That all my treasure was in heaven.
[2:04] [Music]
[2:07] Lord, you were everything
[2:10] to me.
[2:12] [Music]
[2:16] No one ever
[2:20] like
[2:25] his faithful hand
[2:28] this way.
[2:30] [Music]
[2:35] All my days are numbered on the earth.
[2:39] Let it be
[2:43] in you alone.
[2:46] My joy was found.
[2:50] [Music]
[2:54] Lord, you are my joy.
[2:58] [Music]
[3:03] Still in love.
[3:10] You're still

[3:26] You're still my everything.
[3:32] [Music]
[3:34] I'm still in love.
[3:41] You're still
[3:44] enough for me. You are
[3:49] still all I want.
[3:57] You're still my everything.
[4:04] I'm still in love.
[4:12] You're still
[4:14] enough for me. You are. You are
[4:20] still all I want.
[4:24] [Music]
[4:27] You're still my everything.
[4:34] No one ever cared for me like Jesus.
[4:43] His faithful hand has held me all this
[4:47] way.
[4:50] And when I'm old,
[4:53] all my days are numbered on the earth.
[4:57] Let it be
[5:01] in you alone.
[5:05] My joy was found.
[5:11] Matthew chapter 6. We'll just pick it
[5:13] up. There's so many good things in here,
[5:14] but we'll just have a section here. But
[5:17] thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy
[5:20] closet, and when thou hast shut thy
[5:22] door, pray to thy father which is in
[5:25] secret. and thy father which seeth in
[5:28] secret shall reward thee openly. And
[5:31] then further in prayer, when ye pray,
[5:33] use not vain repetitions as the heathen
[5:36] do, for they think they shall be heard
[5:39] for their much speaking. It's not
[5:42] quantity of words, it's the quality of
[5:44] words. It's not just that you're
[5:46] praying, but it's the faith behind your
[5:48] prayer. And this is speaking of an
[5:51] effective prayer. How many this morning
[5:53] want a effective prayer when you pray?
[5:56] And and so then he says, "Be not ye
[5:58] therefore like unto them, for your
[6:01] Father knoweth what things you have need
[6:02] of before you ask. After this manner,
[6:05] therefore pray ye. Our Father, which art
[6:08] in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy
[6:10] kingdom come, thy will be done in earth
[6:13] as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
[6:16] daily bread, and forgive us our debts as
[6:19] we forgive our debtors, and lead us not
[6:21] into temptation, but deliver us from
[6:24] evil. For thine is the kingdom and the
[6:26] power and the glory forever. Amen. And
[6:29] that's usually how we end it when we
[6:31] repeat the Lord's prayer here, but it's
[6:33] not finished yet. It says in verse 14,
[6:36] "For if you forgive men their
[6:39] trespasses, your heavenly Father will
[6:42] also forgive you." Forgiveness is part
[6:45] of the faith of your prayer. But if you
[6:48] forgive not men your trespasses, neither
[6:50] will your father forgive your
[6:52] trespasses. Mark 11 uh the mountain
[6:56] moving faith and speaking to the
[6:58] mountain in verse 11 and verse um 23.
[7:03] Verily I say unto you that whosoever
[7:05] shall say unto this mountain, be thou
[7:07] removed and be thou cast into the sea,
[7:09] and shalt not doubt in his heart, but
[7:11] shall believe that those things which he
[7:13] saith cometh to pass, he shall have
[7:16] whatsoever he saith. Therefore, I say
[7:18] unto you, what things soever ye desire
[7:21] when you pray, believe that you receive
[7:23] them, and ye shall have them. And when
[7:25] you stand praying, forgive if you have
[7:29] ought against any, that your father also
[7:32] which is in heaven may forgive you your
[7:35] trespasses. There's trespasses again
[7:38] that's mentioned. But if you do not
[7:40] forgive, neither will your father which
[7:42] is in heaven forgive your trespasses. I
[7:45] want to speak this morning on the word
[7:47] removing the trespasses to move
[7:50] mountains. Faith and the prayer of faith
[7:53] is linked in both of these texts with
[7:56] forgiveness and the word uh releasing
[7:59] trespasses and so I want to talk about
[8:01] that this morning because these two
[8:03] places link our faith with the
[8:05] forgiveness of our heart. And there are
[8:07] many other places that I want to get to
[8:09] that the scripture brings these things
[8:11] in. And whenever you're talking about
[8:13] faith, you must speak about the whole
[8:16] picture of faith so that we can be in a
[8:18] position of faith and that we can be the
[8:21] right heart for more faith to work
[8:23] through us and God to anoint our faith.
[8:26] We must position ourselves to have
[8:30] perfect faith. And we must, as the
[8:32] scriptures uh showing us, we must for
[8:34] mountainoving faith, we must acknowledge
[8:38] the things that would be in our heart,
[8:40] the aunt that we have against others or
[8:42] the trespasses either that we have done
[8:45] towards God or towards other people or
[8:48] that people have trespassed against us.
[8:51] We cannot approach faith the right way
[8:53] until we approach the the subject of
[8:57] forgiveness and releasing of trespasses.
[8:59] Can you say amen?
[9:01] &gt;&gt; And this is another scripture that shows
[9:03] this because in this particular
[9:04] scripture they they came the disciples
[9:07] as they were watching Jesus pray they
[9:10] came to him after he was done praying
[9:12] and said Lord teach us to pray. Now the
[9:14] sun the Sunday school has got the theme
[9:16] this month of prayer. So, I want to be
[9:19] working in coordination with that as
[9:21] they teach their children about prayer
[9:23] and what prayer is and that we should
[9:25] pray. What a powerful thing to teach
[9:27] children. Can you say amen? That they
[9:29] have access to God, that they can speak
[9:31] to the Lord, that they don't have to go
[9:33] through a priest, but they can utter
[9:35] things from their hearts straight to him
[9:37] and they can hear back from him. Isn't
[9:39] that a wonderful thing? This is the
[9:41] Christian journey. This is what it's all
[9:43] about. It's not about oh what we wear or
[9:46] church order and these other things but
[9:48] it's that I want to live a life that
[9:49] when I go to God I can pray a whole
[9:52] through to heaven and he can hear my
[9:53] prayer and he can answer back to me.
[9:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So now uh the word uh
[10:00] trespass is brought into these. And so
[10:02] now they came and asked Jesus, teach us
[10:05] to pray. Lord, would you teach us to
[10:08] pray? Because they had learned. Why are
[10:11] they asking Jesus to teach us to pray?
[10:13] Because they had learned his prayer got
[10:16] through to God.
[10:17] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[10:19] &gt;&gt; They had watched his life. They had
[10:21] watched this vessel. They had been
[10:23] around him. And when and when he's over
[10:26] there in the corner and he's bowed at
[10:28] his knees and he's praying maybe for an
[10:30] hour or two hours and they left him
[10:32] alone. They knew these prayers had a
[10:35] different thing. Now I want to I want
[10:36] you to notice something. I don't think
[10:38] that the disciples had never prayed
[10:40] before and that's why they were asking
[10:42] him teach us how to pray. These were
[10:44] Jews. These the Jews prayed to God. They
[10:48] prayed to Jehovah. They knew that they
[10:50] that that was part of their lives to
[10:52] pray. They went into the temple and they
[10:54] prayed and and and and so uh it's it's
[10:57] not they were asking to teach us to pray
[10:59] because they didn't pray, but they knew
[11:02] God's Jesus prayers got through.
[11:07] &gt;&gt; They knew Jesus prayers got through. And
[11:11] and you know, if you ask people in the
[11:12] world, you know, that's the thing is
[11:14] that everybody prays. And that's a good
[11:16] thing. I'm not being critical of it. But
[11:18] if you ask a sinner, sometimes they'll
[11:20] say to you, unless they're an atheist
[11:21] and don't believe in God, "Yeah, I pray
[11:23] every day. I'm always praying to God."
[11:25] And so prayer is a common thing to speak
[11:28] to the Lord and and all these other
[11:30] things. But you see now believers today,
[11:32] we have to look at it a little deeper
[11:34] than just saying a prayer. How many
[11:36] knows there's a difference in saying a
[11:37] prayer and praying?
[11:40] &gt;&gt; How many knows there's a difference in
[11:42] just saying a prayer at your meal or
[11:44] something like that? That's wonderful.
[11:46] you should do that. But there is a
[11:47] difference in saying a prayer and
[11:49] sometimes even a an orthodox prayer, a
[11:52] prayer that's a repetitive prayer and
[11:54] it's the same prayer that you repeat and
[11:56] it becomes a tradition. That's a big
[11:58] difference in somebody entering into
[12:00] real prayer.
[12:02] &gt;&gt; And praying the prayer of faith
[12:06] &gt;&gt; and I don't mean to make it something
[12:07] complicated, but we must find the prayer
[12:10] of faith
[12:12] &gt;&gt; especially in the hour that we live in.
[12:15] Amen.
[12:16] &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, I'm just going to say
[12:17] it to you. We are dealing in troublesome
[12:20] times.
[12:22] &gt;&gt; We are experiencing demon power like
[12:24] I've never seen it before.
[12:27] &gt;&gt; And if you are engaged in the battle and
[12:29] serving the Lord and believing this word
[12:32] and standing with it every day and
[12:34] trying, then you're facing things that
[12:36] you never faced before. The devil, as
[12:38] soon as you make a step, the devil's
[12:40] going to fight against it. And besides
[12:42] this, there's darkness upon the earth,
[12:44] but also on the minds of the people.
[12:47] There's an oppression. There's a
[12:49] depression. There's there's an
[12:51] oppressing uh spirits that come against
[12:54] you to bring darkness into your life
[12:56] that you can't even have joy anymore.
[12:58] You can't even enjoy moments anymore.
[13:01] We're living under an oppression. Can
[13:03] you say amen? And there is no theology,
[13:06] there is no psychology that is strong
[13:08] enough to pierce the darkness of this
[13:11] mental depression. It takes prayer of
[13:14] faith to pray a hole through to the sky.
[13:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:18] &gt;&gt; It takes getting a hold of God. Can you
[13:20] say amen?
[13:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And so they prayed
[13:25] before, but they said, "Lord, teach us
[13:27] to pray." And I believe a believer has
[13:30] hunger, especially when he sees here a
[13:32] prayer that showed results. I believe
[13:34] it's the believers that they wanted to
[13:37] say a prayer like Jesus to be able to
[13:40] get results. They they said, "Teach us
[13:42] to pray." And it didn't mean that they
[13:44] didn't mean that we haven't ever prayed
[13:46] before. Doesn't mean the world says they
[13:48] pray. No, that means they were hungry
[13:50] for this kind of results from the
[13:52] father. What's happening? Uh teach me
[13:54] what's happening, Lord, when you pray.
[13:57] What? Something happens. Your prayer is
[13:59] getting through. Uh something happens
[14:02] when you pray. Something happens when
[14:03] you speak. There's a power behind you.
[14:06] And listen now. Jesus had thousands of
[14:08] people around him watching this go on.
[14:11] And none of them desired to come and ask
[14:13] Jesus to to teach us to pray. But
[14:16] believers when they see that, they say,
[14:19] "Lord, there's something in me. Teach me
[14:22] that I can pray this way. Yes, Lord.
[14:25] &gt;&gt; Teach me, Lord.
[14:27] &gt;&gt; Teach me, Lord. I I I want to I want to
[14:30] grow. It's only believers saying that.
[14:32] The rest of the world say, "I'll just
[14:33] say my prayers and I'm fine with that."
[14:35] But believers are saying, "No, no, I
[14:37] want my prayers to get through. I want
[14:40] to hear back from God." Can I get an
[14:42] amen this morning? We need a God that
[14:44] shows up and answers back. We got too
[14:47] many young people without the Holy
[14:48] Ghost. We got too many oppressing
[14:50] spirits. We got too many mental battles.
[14:53] I'm telling you, we need a God that
[14:55] answers back. We got too many devils
[14:58] fighting against families, fighting
[15:00] against marriages. We got too much upon
[15:02] us just to have church and just to have
[15:05] a religion. We've got to have the prayer
[15:08] of faith that gets through. And I
[15:10] believe this is what we're going to
[15:11] learning to depend on as the days are
[15:14] coming.
[15:16] &gt;&gt; The economy is going to fall apart.
[15:18] We got brothers that's feeling the
[15:20] pressure in this congregation, having to
[15:22] work second and third jobs, might even
[15:24] have to put the wife to work, things
[15:26] like this. We got grocery prices up 60%.
[15:29] We've got all this damage and it's it's
[15:31] not prophesied to get any better. So, we
[15:33] got pressures that are still coming.
[15:34] We're hoping for a relief, and I pray
[15:36] there is, too. But listen now, if it if
[15:38] it if there's not a relief to some of
[15:40] the pressure and the insecurity of jobs
[15:42] and income and everything else, we're
[15:45] going to have to learn to depend on
[15:46] something.
[15:49] Come on now.
[15:50] &gt;&gt; It's easy if you got a really good job
[15:52] right now. You're making good money.
[15:53] It's easy. Okay. Yeah, I I know. But
[15:55] see, when you feel the crunch of it,
[16:00] &gt;&gt; we will be driven into a spot to depend
[16:02] on God like we've never depended on him
[16:04] before.
[16:06] &gt;&gt; And I want to be positioned that my
[16:08] prayer counts.
[16:10] &gt;&gt; Now, I know God hears our prayer, but we
[16:12] we can read that. God hears our prayer.
[16:14] But what we need a God that answers
[16:15] back.
[16:17] We need a God who answers back.
[16:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And so now uh you know
[16:25] when sons, let me just stop here a
[16:27] minute. When sons of God are coming back
[16:30] to Jesus and asking him to teach us, you
[16:34] know what that says? That shows that
[16:36] they there are sons that want to move to
[16:39] their position and to adoption.
[16:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because adoption, adopted son. And
[16:46] how many know there's a difference in a
[16:47] birth of a son and an adoption of a son.
[16:50] There's some ministers that speak it.
[16:52] When you're born again and you receive
[16:54] the Holy Ghost, you're a fully adopted
[16:56] son. I don't think there's enough
[16:57] scripture to support that or message. I
[16:59] believe you're birthed into the kingdom
[17:01] and you grow to an adopted son. The very
[17:04] reason you have the Holy Ghost is to
[17:06] bring you to maturity and adoption and
[17:08] bring you to a rapture. You won't make a
[17:10] rapture without the Holy Ghost. But when
[17:12] you receive the Holy Ghost, it is the
[17:14] spirit of adoption to take you to
[17:16] adoption. And part of the thing of
[17:19] adoption is the separation between is
[17:22] this a son who's teachable from the
[17:24] father to learn, Lord, I want to do what
[17:27] you do. Now, there's nothing wrong with
[17:29] a son saying to Jesus, I you're the son
[17:32] of God. You're the only begotten son,
[17:34] but I want to do what you're doing. I
[17:37] want the faith that you have. I want you
[17:39] to teach me how to be that kind of son.
[17:42] I want you to teach me how to pray like
[17:44] you're praying.
[17:47] &gt;&gt; And guess what? You might not feel
[17:49] worthy to ask that, but sons, God has
[17:51] made you worthy to ask the father. Can
[17:54] you say amen?
[17:56] &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm teachable.
[17:58] &gt;&gt; Adopted sons are teachable. Amen.
[18:01] &gt;&gt; Remember he brings that whole thing out
[18:02] of, you know, in the Old Testament, the
[18:04] Hebrews, the boy when he was young, he
[18:07] was a son born into a family, but then
[18:09] he's put under a tutor to train him and
[18:11] teach him the father's way, teach him
[18:12] the father's business. And if it's a son
[18:14] that was rebellious, he's still a son.
[18:17] He's still a son, but it's like he could
[18:18] rebel for years. I don't want that to I
[18:20] don't want to become like that. I want
[18:21] to do something else. But when once the
[18:23] son becomes teachable, then the tutor
[18:25] can come back and report to the father
[18:27] and say, "How's my boy? How's my boy by?
[18:30] He's so teachable. He's so He's wanting
[18:32] to learn. He's wanting to learn the
[18:34] business of the father. He's wanting to
[18:36] become like you. Can you say amen? And
[18:38] when he shows that teachable spirit,
[18:41] somewhere along the line, there's an
[18:43] adoption ceremony to say, "This son, I
[18:46] am pleased with." How many you know
[18:48] there was an adoption ceremony with
[18:50] Jesus,
[18:51] &gt;&gt; sir?
[18:52] &gt;&gt; And what was the adoption? The adoption
[18:54] wasn't just a feeling and build three
[18:56] tabernacles. In fact, God said, "Don't
[18:59] build Peter, James." No, we're not
[19:01] building tabernacles. We're not building
[19:03] a system to oursel. This is about
[19:05] adoption. I'm pleased with my son to
[19:09] fill him completely. This is my son in
[19:11] whom I'm well pleased. This is my
[19:13] desire. So, it's not a problem for you
[19:16] to come and ask the father to teach you.
[19:18] You know why the disciples could feel
[19:19] comfortable doing that? Because all
[19:22] along Jesus said, "The works that I do
[19:25] shall you do also.
[19:29] He kept dropping this in and saying,
[19:31] "Now, I'm doing this, but the works I
[19:34] need to do, all the sons will do those
[19:36] works."
[19:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, somebody say, "Praise the Lord."
[19:39] Don't get quiet on me this morning. This
[19:40] is the word of God. And I'm talking
[19:42] about you. I'm talking about you. Not
[19:44] somebody sitting next to you. I'm
[19:46] talking about you. If we're sons, we're
[19:48] in a different category. And if we're
[19:50] teachable, he'll teach us to position
[19:53] oursel in faith to bring the prayer of
[19:56] faith.
[19:57] &gt;&gt; When you lay your hands on that child
[19:59] with a fever, you pray the pray the
[20:01] prayer of faith.
[20:05] &gt;&gt; And so they could ask because Jesus kept
[20:08] hinting and saying, "Listen, what I'm
[20:11] doing, where I go, you will go also."
[20:15] He's telling the sons, "Whatever I'm
[20:17] doing." So that must have been a stir in
[20:18] their hearts to say, "I am a son. I
[20:22] believe I'm a son and I will do the
[20:24] things that he will do." And sons that
[20:27] are trainable are humble.
[20:31] They're humble to admit they're wrong.
[20:35] &gt;&gt; Adopted sons that are trainable and
[20:37] wanting to move to adoption. Their sons
[20:40] are trainable. They're humble. They
[20:42] admit they are wrong. They admit I have
[20:45] been doing things for the Lord maybe
[20:46] even for years but I want to go deeper.
[20:48] Here's another thing adopted sons do in
[20:50] their in their teachableness and that is
[20:53] uh you know they want the will of God.
[20:56] They want to be truly led by the will of
[20:57] God because they've learned in their
[20:59] immaturity. They made decisions in their
[21:03] life sometimes that they called the will
[21:06] of God but they found out it wasn't it
[21:08] was my own will. sons that come and
[21:10] sober up to say, "Wait a minute. I'm a
[21:12] son of God here. Lord, teach me how to
[21:15] mature because I have learned not only
[21:18] do I want to be taught to pray the
[21:19] prayer of faith, but I want to walk
[21:21] truly in the will of God. I want to walk
[21:24] like Jesus." He said, "I do nothing
[21:26] except my father shows me."
[21:30] &gt;&gt; I want to live that kind of life that I
[21:31] do nothing except my father shows me in
[21:33] heaven. And I know he's seen it by
[21:35] vision, but we catch the vision of what
[21:36] God wants to do for his will. We want to
[21:38] walk in his will because we've
[21:40] experienced maybe what it is to walk out
[21:42] of his will. Or sometimes the famous
[21:45] line that comes from people, I'm a good
[21:47] person. I pray uh you know how many
[21:50] sinners have justified themselves to
[21:51] say, I pray to God all the time, but
[21:53] there's no change. There's no change in
[21:55] their prayer. And then sons are
[21:56] teachable to come and say, Lord, I I I
[21:59] want to walk in your will. I want to be
[22:01] uh uh in not only pray the right prayer
[22:04] of faith, but I want to walk um it's a
[22:07] son that's saying that it's immature
[22:09] sons that that that is that is uh trying
[22:13] to always fight for their own will. Can
[22:17] you say amen? And trying to make it
[22:19] God's will, but they're saying, "I I
[22:22] truly want God's will." Can you say
[22:24] amen?
[22:26] &gt;&gt; Sons are teachable.
[22:28] sons do not no longer want to say and
[22:30] you know God gets blamed for a lot of
[22:32] things that we do wrong
[22:35] &gt;&gt; because it's God told me to do this and
[22:36] God told me to do that and God to hear a
[22:39] lot of that attaching God to it it's
[22:41] fine but you better make sure God's
[22:43] really led you to do that
[22:45] &gt;&gt; because we feel more comfortable we
[22:47] bring God in God into it and guess what
[22:49] your counselor your pastor is not going
[22:51] to come up against to try to correct you
[22:53] when you say God told you to do it
[22:56] &gt;&gt; I back off I don't want to be coming
[22:58] against God. But how many times years
[23:00] down the road we were and God gets
[23:02] blamed for a lot of stuff we did?
[23:04] &gt;&gt; Can I get a witness this morning? Can I
[23:07] get some people that admit to sometimes
[23:09] doing this?
[23:10] &gt;&gt; We attach. We better be careful that we
[23:12] don't attach so things to God. We better
[23:14] make sure. But mature sons want to say,
[23:16] "Lord, mature me that I'm not just
[23:19] always pursuing. Make me teachable."
[23:21] Especially when there's my prayer. I
[23:23] want to be like Jesus. But most of all,
[23:25] I want my prayer to shake things up. I
[23:28] want my prayer to move the heart of God.
[23:32] Can you say amen?
[23:33] &gt;&gt; There are things that we can do to
[23:35] position oursel to say and do the right
[23:37] thing that will throw God into action.
[23:40] &gt;&gt; The prayer faith shall save the sick.
[23:43] &gt;&gt; The prayer that gets through to God.
[23:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[23:46] &gt;&gt; Not just saying a prayer.
[23:49] &gt;&gt; One day the disciples prayed for an
[23:51] epileptic child and they didn't get any
[23:53] results. In Matthew 17:14, it says, "And
[23:56] when they were come to the multitude,
[23:57] there came him a certain man, kneeling
[23:59] down to him, and saying, Lord, have
[24:01] mercy on my son, for he's a lunatic and
[24:03] sorvexed, for of times he fall into the
[24:06] fire and often into the water." Matthew
[24:08] 17:16. And I brought him to thy
[24:10] disciples, and they could not cure him.
[24:13] Then Jesus answer said, "Oh faithless
[24:14] and perverse generation, how long shall
[24:16] I be with you? How long shall I suffer
[24:18] you? Bring him thither hither to me."
[24:20] And Jesus rebuked the devil, and he
[24:22] departed out of him, and the child was
[24:24] cured from that very hour. Then came the
[24:26] disciples to Jesus apart, and said, "Why
[24:28] could we not cast him out?" And Jesus
[24:31] said to them, "Because of your unbelief.
[24:33] For verily I say unto you, if you have
[24:35] faith as a grain of a mustard seed, ye
[24:38] shall say to this mountain, remove hence
[24:40] to yonder place, and it shall remove,
[24:43] and nothing shall be impossible unto
[24:45] you. How be it this kind goeth not out
[24:48] but by fasting and by prayer. So now you
[24:50] could attach yourself just to the
[24:52] fasting and prayer and say okay I need
[24:53] to do more prayer and more fasting. I
[24:56] believe that doesn't say how much you
[24:57] fast. I believe it's a dedication. It's
[24:59] a positioning yourself to be available
[25:02] to God with all things cleared up from
[25:04] your heart that you could pray the
[25:06] prayer of bringing the impossible God in
[25:09] impossible situations. The disciples
[25:12] weren't there yet.
[25:14] But he says because of your unbelief
[25:16] there's still too much in your heart.
[25:17] There's still too much there. And he
[25:19] says but when you pray you can move
[25:21] mountains.
[25:24] You know he's hinting you're going to
[25:26] come to this.
[25:28] &gt;&gt; Oh praise the Lord. You're going to come
[25:31] to this kind of faith. You're going to
[25:33] come and when you do you could say
[25:35] mountain be removed and cast into the
[25:37] sea and nothing shall be impossible.
[25:39] Nothing shall be impossible to you. They
[25:42] were not there yet. Of course, they
[25:44] needed the Holy Ghost which would bring
[25:45] them faith in their part to speak to
[25:47] mountains. But he didn't say, "Oh, you
[25:50] know, Jesus didn't say when they come to
[25:51] him and they prayed for this epileptic
[25:54] and nothing happened." Jesus did not
[25:56] say, "Oh, you guys are you're losers.
[25:59] You'll never get this. You will never
[26:01] have this." No. He said, "You don't have
[26:04] perfect faith yet, but you will get it
[26:07] if your position is right and you know
[26:09] who you are. standing with a token.
[26:12] Nothing shall stand before your prayer.
[26:15] Nothing shall be impossible to you. I'm
[26:18] I'm preaching the right kind of faith to
[26:20] you this morning. The disciples said,
[26:22] "We want this kind of faith." But they
[26:24] had they hadn't grown to it yet. But he
[26:26] didn't say, "You're a bunch of losers.
[26:28] You're never going to catch this. I'm so
[26:29] disappointed. I'm going to call call Zip
[26:32] Recruiter and get some more disciples.
[26:35] I'm getting online with Zip Recruiter
[26:37] and I've got to find 12 more disciples."
[26:39] He didn't say that.
[26:41] &gt;&gt; He said you're going to grow into this.
[26:43] Can you say amen? You're going to come
[26:45] into this faith, too. My brother and
[26:47] sister, I don't care what the devil has
[26:48] told you this week. If you're a son of
[26:50] God, you're going to come into perfect
[26:52] faith. We just know how need to know how
[26:54] to position ourselves
[26:57] &gt;&gt; for this kind of faith. You know,
[26:58] there's people that walk into this
[27:00] church sometimes and you got a lot of
[27:02] past on you and a lot of clouds and
[27:05] things and it's such a heavy load. It's
[27:08] such a it's it's a mountain. You know,
[27:10] it's interesting Jesus uses mountains
[27:12] because that's probably one of the most
[27:14] unremovable things you could remove.
[27:18] &gt;&gt; But that's what's he going to use for
[27:19] things in your life. Cuz he didn't talk
[27:20] about us moving to literal mountains. As
[27:22] I told you, my wife's from Tennessee and
[27:25] she would be have moved all the Smoky
[27:28] Mountains up here to Michigan by now if
[27:30] it was literal mountains. And I would
[27:32] have helped her with my faith. It's not
[27:34] literal mountains. But Jesus is trying
[27:36] to show you how powerful this is.
[27:38] Because the stuff you go through, it's
[27:40] it seems impossible.
[27:43] &gt;&gt; A mountain, moving a mountain and
[27:45] casting it to the sea. What are you
[27:46] talking about? He wanted you to know
[27:48] nothing is impossible with God.
[27:52] &gt;&gt; No family member has gone too far that
[27:54] the prayer of faith somewhere down the
[27:56] line is going to catch that child, catch
[27:59] that husband, catch that wife. You don't
[28:01] need to look at the circumstances. You
[28:04] need to look at what Jesus said to his
[28:05] sons. Nothing shall be impossible to
[28:08] your prayer
