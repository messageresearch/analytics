[6:53] survive the Lord has kept me
[6:56] alive the Lord has kept me alive
[7:01] these six things doth the Lord hate yay
[7:05] seven are an Abomination unto him if you
[7:07] never knew this morning what the Lord
[7:09] really hates people can have a lot of
[7:11] versions of What the Lord hates but this
[7:13] is what the Bible says it narrows it
[7:14] down to seven
[7:16] things a proud
[7:18] look a lying
[7:21] tongue hands that shed innocent
[7:25] blood a heart that deviseth Wicked
[7:29] imagin
[7:30] ations feet that be Swift in running to
[7:34] Mischief a false witness that speaketh
[7:39] lies and he that Seth Discord among
[7:45] who the
[7:47] Brethren this might be somebody closer
[7:49] than just somebody out in the
[7:51] world this is among the Brethren amen
[7:55] but these are things seven things that
[7:58] God hates but the spirit of every age is
[8:01] trying to come and work in the people
[8:03] and that's why I'm bringing it more to a
[8:05] local level because we see that
[8:08] sometimes firsthand it will try to work
[8:10] among the people it'll try to work in
[8:12] the people and these characteristics
[8:14] that are here that are things that God
[8:16] hates uh I want to get to that in just a
[8:18] minute but I just want to say but uh
[8:20] that the spirit will always try to work
[8:23] among the people on a local level uh no
[8:26] matter how small the congregation no
[8:28] matter how small the Gathering is no
[8:31] matter what they believe if they what
[8:33] whatever they believe if they believe
[8:35] the the message of restoration for the
[8:37] last days or if they believe uh certain
[8:40] uh truths of the Bible it doesn't matter
[8:42] the Gathering whenever there's truth
[8:44] being presented then we know the enemy
[8:46] is trying to work but where's he working
[8:48] he gets among the people to start some
[8:51] type of divide between one another
[8:53] that's his job that's what he's always
[8:55] done to plant the wrong seed he did it
[8:58] in the garden of Eden he told Eve the
[9:01] wrong thing which he planted the wrong
[9:02] seed not even not just physically to Eve
[9:06] but Also
[9:07] spiritually the serpent planted the
[9:10] wrong seed in Eve's mind so this is the
[9:13] work of the enemy to say to to say
[9:16] something that's not completely off the
[9:18] word but just distorted it's distorted
[9:21] can you say amen and and so take
[9:24] something distorted and plant it as a
[9:26] seed sewn in Eve's mind cuz knows if I
[9:29] can get that in there then it'll have
[9:31] fruit come from it someday this is the
[9:33] enemy's work to work amongst the people
[9:36] in the minds of the people and I want to
[9:38] say that part of our discernment as a
[9:40] Christian of all Satan's work throughout
[9:43] the ages we are living the last days so
[9:46] with the revealing of the seven Church
[9:48] ages and the revealing of the Seven
[9:50] Seals which he left until the end time
[9:53] the people of God would be able to look
[9:56] back and have discernment of how the
[9:59] devil worked from day one to try to
[10:02] divide the church we have a discernment
[10:05] of how the Antichrist Spirit Works how
[10:08] it worked then how it worked Through the
[10:10] Ages and we should know how it works
[10:14] here we need
[10:18] discernment and when John talked about
[10:20] the Antichrist Spirit which he spoke
[10:22] more about it he used the term the
[10:24] Antichrist 1 second third John he his
[10:27] theme was number one truth and lies but
[10:30] truth and then his other theme was love
[10:33] because there's only one true genuine
[10:36] response to the Antichrist spirit and by
[10:40] the way it's not debate it's not that we
[10:42] have more Doctrine it's genuine perfect
[10:46] love in response to that Antichrist
[10:49] Spirit CU I guarantee you that
[10:51] Antichrist Spirit talks about love it
[10:53] thinks it knows about love but it does
[10:55] not have the root of love Jesus Christ
[10:59] and so how do we combat an antichrist
[11:01] Spirit Divine
[11:03] love read it in your Bible 1 second
[11:06] third John Brothers love one another
[11:09] it's all about love it's all about truth
[11:11] we know that it's Antichrist spirit it's
[11:13] not dwelling in all truth that's how we
[11:15] discern it so it doesn't take a a rocket
[11:19] science here to figure this out it's in
[11:20] the Bible and part of our discernment is
[11:23] recognizing in every age of what Spirit
[11:26] he worked in what he did but to use that
[11:28] discernment we have to use our
[11:30] discernment of what how Satan works we
[11:33] have to use it
[11:35] now if we know these things we have to
[11:38] use it and apply it now can you say
[11:42] Amen part of our discernment we must
[11:44] know how it works and to properly
[11:47] withstand when it tries to work in you
[11:50] when it tries to influence you and
[11:53] locally in your own church or in your
[11:56] family that's why I want to talk about
[11:58] how Proverbs 6 plays out in the local
[12:01] church I'd like to preach on so what do
[12:04] we got here we got the church ages in
[12:06] Proverbs 6 today we're going to have the
[12:08] local church in Proverbs 6 I'd like to
[12:11] talk about the home in Proverbs 6 you
[12:14] can take these characteristics and how
[12:16] they work this is what God hates in
[12:19] every age and when these things pop up
[12:22] they are not of God a proud look a lying
[12:25] tongue hands that shed innocent blood a
[12:28] false witness speaking lies these are
[12:30] not of God and God actually hates them
[12:32] they're an Abomination to
[12:36] him so if we can see him working anyway
[12:39] anywhere we are to
[12:42] withstand these
[12:45] things God give me a church if they're
[12:48] going to stand strong in anything let
[12:49] them stand and withstand withstand these
[12:53] things when they begin to work Among Us
[12:55] amen may they put these spirits in their
[12:58] place
[12:59] and say you need to stop talking you
[13:02] need to quit bringing an accusation
[13:04] against an elder you need to quit saying
[13:06] those things because I don't know if
[13:07] that's full truth and until I know it's
[13:09] truth we need to stop talking about it
[13:12] you need to stop gossiping oh to have a
[13:14] strong Church to shut down boy we shut
[13:16] down the wrong dress we shut down the
[13:18] short skirts we shut this down and
[13:21] that's fine but how about shutting down
[13:23] the thing that God really hates how
[13:26] about shutting down gossip how about
[13:29] about shutting down a person who devises
[13:31] Wicked imaginations how about shutting
[13:34] down a false
[13:35] witness can I get any amens here this
[13:38] morning if you can't say Amen say ouch
[13:40] or something but I'm going to tell the
[13:42] truth this is the core of what God hates
[13:46] brings me to a couple of foundational
[13:48] points I want to make this morning we in
[13:51] the message got to quit putting the
[13:52] Antichrist Spirit out there it's so easy
[13:55] to do it's such a bad word it's such a
[13:57] bad thing that into Christ spirit and it
[14:00] is bad it started in the early church
[14:02] it's come to fruition today and it's
[14:05] here it's working but we need to stop
[14:08] putting it always oh yes the Antichrist
[14:11] Spirit oh the mother of harlots oh the
[14:14] systems oh it's out there it's out there
[14:17] I'm here to tell you brothers and
[14:18] sisters is that he does not stop at
[14:21] those doors he wants to come and bring
[14:24] an antichrist Spirit Among Us and
[14:26] already has
[14:29] it's all right you don't have to say
[14:30] Amen that loud but we've been around
[14:32] long enough to see that the devil
[14:34] doesn't say just by the name on the
[14:36] church on the
[14:40] door he can sneak through any door can
[14:44] you say
[14:45] Amen so the characteristics are there
[14:48] and we're not immune from it working
[14:50] Among Us I think the Lord has been
[14:53] directly warning us as a church from
[14:55] brother M Brian Naidu in his service I
[14:58] can comment on that but ever since then
[15:00] I just felt this he talked about
[15:02] discernment of where we're at now 400
[15:04] prophets anointed using quotes against
[15:08] Micah and Micah had to stand by himself
[15:10] and yet the Bible says all 400 of those
[15:13] Jewish prophets were under a a lying
[15:16] spirit so you got 400 to one one Prophet
[15:20] want 400 with a lying Spirit on him the
[15:22] percentages of lying was higher than
[15:24] what than the ministers and Prophets
[15:26] that was being preached 400 to1 and so
[15:29] now we need discernment internally how
[15:33] subtle this would start can you say Amen
[15:35] maybe Proverbs 6 is more revealing of
[15:38] the manner that the Antichrist Spirit
[15:41] starts than what we even realize in the
[15:44] garden how subtle it was to start in the
[15:47] early church it started just as a saying
[15:50] amongst the people then it became a deed
[15:53] it wasn't a Doctrine
[15:55] yet it started as a saying amongst the
[15:58] people people it's what people were
[16:00] talking
[16:01] about then it became a deed can you say
[16:05] Amen then it become a Doctrine and then
[16:08] a Spirit came on them to kill anything
[16:10] that disagreed with it where's that come
[16:13] from I don't come from God in the name
[16:17] of the church they were killing other
[16:19] Christians in the name of Doctrine in
[16:21] the name and that's how far that
[16:23] Antichrist Spirit can go from the white
[16:26] horse rider to the red horse rider to to
[16:29] the the the black horse and now the Pale
[16:31] Horse Rider riding now what's a mixture
[16:34] of them all death can you say Amen so
[16:37] this is not the true church this is the
[16:39] Antichrist spirit and so now I I just
[16:42] want to can can we just hold your finger
[16:44] there in Proverbs 6 I'll come back but
[16:46] can you just look at what I'm saying
[16:47] just as a quick example all the way back
[16:50] in the book of Acts I think it's verse
[16:52] chapter 20 yes how far can we trace the
[16:56] Antichrist Spirit back when the early
[16:58] church started
[16:59] all the way to the book of
[17:02] Acts and so this I'm just pausing on
[17:04] this CU I want everybody to know in case
[17:06] you don't know Antichrist did Spirit
[17:08] didn't start in the middle of the ages
[17:10] it didn't start uh many many years later
[17:13] it didn't start at the end time no we're
[17:16] at the fruition at the end time here's
[17:18] where it started when Paul's getting
[17:19] ready to go Jerusalem he said I go Bound
[17:22] in my spirit because the council the
[17:24] systems were going to be the one that
[17:26] put him to death Rome would put him to
[17:28] death but watch what Paul says just
[17:30] before he's taken a prisoner in the next
[17:32] few chapters watch what he's saying to
[17:34] the brothers that's around him here in
[17:37] Ephesians and the different churches he
[17:38] says verse 27 chapter 20: 27 for I have
[17:42] not shunn to declare unto you all the
[17:45] counsel of God so praise the Lord
[17:47] somebody gave us all the counsel he
[17:49] didn't held back anything verse 28 take
[17:53] heed therefore unto
[17:55] yourselves and to the flock over the
[17:57] which the Holy Ghost ghost hath made you
[18:00] overseers to feed the Church of God
[18:04] which he hath purchased with his own
[18:06] blood for I know this that after my
[18:10] departing shall Grievious wolves enter
[18:13] in where among you now he's not talking
[18:17] about the council in Rome that's getting
[18:19] ready to to take him out he's talking
[18:22] about wolves I'm prophesying that after
[18:26] I'm gone wolves will enter among you so
[18:30] here's the true prophet of God the
[18:31] Apostle the prophet for the age can you
[18:33] say Amen First Church age messenger but
[18:36] now he says it's after I'm gone right
[18:40] anybody listening pay attention after
[18:43] I'm gone so there'll be a Thrust of this
[18:46] happening to go after the Sheep after my
[18:49] departing wolves will come in among
[18:53] yourselves and uh you know feed the
[18:56] flock these are all instructions because
[18:57] that's how you're going to ward off the
[18:59] enemy is these overseers to feed the
[19:01] flock to feed the church which he has
[19:03] purchased his own blood for I know that
[19:05] after my departing shall Grievious
[19:06] wolves enter in among you not sparing
[19:09] the flock and what does that mean it's
[19:11] not in other words they're not holding
[19:13] back actually who they're going for
[19:15] they're not they're not going to say
[19:17] well I'm just going to bring this spirit
[19:18] and I'm going to try to destroy things
[19:20] no they won't spare the flock it's the
[19:22] flock who they're going for and a lot of
[19:24] times the weaker ones the ones that
[19:27] aren't established the way they should
[19:29] be but he these these wolves these
[19:31] preachers whatever they are are going
[19:33] after the
[19:34] flock God's
[19:37] flock this is happening in Acts chap 20
[19:41] Acts chapter 2 is the birth of the
[19:45] church the Antichrist spirit is going to
[19:48] already begin to work by people coming
[19:50] up among yourselves also of your own
[19:53] self shall men arise speaking perverse
[19:56] things that word perverse means
[19:59] distorted things it not necessarily
[20:01] black and white okay that's wrong this
[20:03] is right it's perverting it's distorted
[20:05] it's taking the truth and distorting it
[20:08] like the serpent did to Eve it's a
[20:10] distortion of
[20:11] Truth perverse speaking perverse things
[20:14] to draw away disciples after them
[20:18] therefore watch and remember that by the
[20:21] space of three years I cease not to warn
[20:22] everyone day and night with tears he had
[20:25] already been warning of this for three
[20:27] years before well that's pretty close to
[20:29] his conversion right after his
[20:31] conversion he's already warning his
[20:34] brothers to say when I'm gone this
[20:37] Antichrist he didn't call an antichrist
[20:39] but this Antichrist Spirit would be in
[20:41] its
[20:42] beginnings and the beginnings if we
[20:45] could have discernment for the
[20:47] beginnings then we can have what we need
[20:50] to
[20:52] withstand can you say Amen because
[20:55] that's what we're supposed to do contend
[20:57] for the faith that was once delivered
[20:59] unto the Saints to earnestly contend for
[21:01] the faith and so we don't know how to
[21:04] contend unless we know this could it be
[21:06] that some of these simple things in
[21:07] Proverbs Chapter 6 could it be that
[21:10] these are the early starts not the
[21:12] doctrine it starts with these little
[21:15] things beginning to work because if you
[21:17] have a lying tongue if you have a false
[21:20] witness if you have a proud look that's
[21:23] the character issues that are lacking
[21:26] there that false Doctrine can get in and
[21:28] I don't think it's FAL doctrine that
[21:30] splits churches I think that's the last
[21:32] result because when someone is very
[21:34] bitter towards somebody else when
[21:36] somebody is uh speaking lies against
[21:38] somebody else when they're doing these
[21:40] things already then they have to have a
[21:42] reason to leave they have to have a
[21:44] reason to split the church so I'm going
[21:45] to find some quotes that endorse what I
[21:47] think I'm going to find some scriptures
[21:49] and we're going to have a battle and so
[21:50] the split ends up looking like it's a
[21:52] doctrinal split but it's not because why
[21:56] things have to do with the heart first
[21:59] can I get an
[22:00] amen bitterness starts in the heart
[22:03] first not
[22:06] Doctrine a lying tongue can you say one
[22:09] who SWS Discord among the Brethren you
[22:11] see it doesn't start with the doctrine
[22:13] first it starts with small things
[22:16] remember this Christ in the true church
[22:19] is a continuation of the book of Acts
[22:21] but the Book of Revelation shows how the
[22:23] Antichrist Spirit would come into the
[22:25] church and defile it making it lukewarm
[22:29] formal and Powerless it exposes Satan
[22:33] revealing his Works attempting
[22:35] destruction of God's people and
[22:37] discrediting of God's word right down to
[22:40] the time he is cast into the Lake of
[22:43] Fire what is the book of rev why do we
[22:45] have the Book of Revelations the last
[22:47] book of the Bible it exposes the entire
[22:49] scheme of Satan throughout the
[22:52] ages that the people in the end time can
[22:56] look back with discernment and see I see
[22:58] them I see him I see the trail of The
[23:00] Serpent and he wasn't in a bar somewhere
[23:02] he was in the church quoting the word
[23:05] can I get an amen the serpent was
[23:08] quoting the word misquoting it and he's
[23:11] still doing it today and so he goes on
[23:13] to say this Revelation comes out of the
[23:16] Book of Revelations he cannot stand it
[23:18] he knows that if the people get the true
[23:20] revelation of the true church and what
[23:22] she is what she stands for and what she
[23:24] can do with the Greater Works look at
[23:27] all that that we get through revelation
[23:28] in the last days the true church if he
[23:31] knows that she gets a true revelation of
[23:34] the true church who the true church is
[23:36] and what she is and what she stands for
[23:39] do you know that do you know the true
[23:41] church do you know what she really
[23:43] stands for you should know that because
[23:46] that'll give you discernment to tell the
[23:48] false from the
[23:51] true when she gets a revelation she will
[23:54] be an invincible
[23:56] Army Revelation she can do do the
[23:58] Greater Works she will be an invincible
[24:00] Army if they get a true revelation of
[24:02] the two Spirits within the framework of
[24:05] the Christian church and by God's spirit
[24:08] discern and withstand the Antichrist
[24:11] Spirit get this point we are called to
[24:15] discern and withstand the Antichrist
[24:19] Spirit wherever it's trying to
[24:22] work and we do it by Revelation by Love
[24:26] by humility
[24:29] but we do with discernment and
[24:31] withstanding Satan will be powerless
[24:34] before her how many would like to live
[24:35] every day where Satan's
[24:38] powerless Satan will be powerless before
[24:41] her he will be as definitely thwarted
[24:44] today as when Christ with stood his
[24:46] every effort to gain power over him in
[24:48] the desert yes Satan hates Revelation
[24:52] but we love it with true Revelation in
[24:54] our lives the Gates of Hell cannot pre
[24:58] Prevail against us but we will prevail
[25:01] over them my second Point here as a
[25:03] foundation these seven things that God
[25:06] hates are so unlike things we would
[25:10] think God
[25:12] hates we would probably attach other
[25:15] things
[25:17] to what God hates an Abomination is a
[25:21] strong word to use for these things and
[25:23] we're talking about somebody who speaks
[25:25] a false witness and devises IM uh uh
[25:28] Wicked imaginations a proud look
[25:30] somebody's got a proud look Abomination
[25:33] that's a strong word how many know
[25:35] Abomination is a strong word it's
[25:38] stronger than just sin it's Abomination
[25:40] is a strong word to use on these things
[25:42] it's discussed it's deeper than discuss
[25:44] it's hatred it's a feeling of hatred in
[25:46] other words God hates these seven things
[25:50] now I know and you know you should know
[25:53] there are other Abominations in the
[25:55] Bible besides these seven there's other
[25:57] Abominations
[25:58] there's about 70 plus Abominations
[26:02] listed there is 667 listed sins and from
[26:07] what I read not all sins rise to the
[26:11] level of an Abomination if God has an
[26:14] Abomination and hates something then he
[26:16] still does well how do we get out of all
[26:19] that only the grace of God through the
[26:22] cross how do we meet it all only through
[26:25] the cross only through
[26:28] his
[26:30] righteousness not your own he knew we
[26:33] could fail at all 667 he knew we didn't
[26:36] have a any chance can you say amen and
[26:39] he went to Calvary he paid the price for
[26:41] our sin he opened the day door for the
[26:43] Holy Ghost he put his Spirit within us
[26:46] can you say Amen there's no way to live
[26:48] this except through the Holy Ghost
[26:49] there's only one person that can live
[26:51] this word and that's him coming and
[26:53] living in you you can't live it but he
[26:55] can live it in you so my point is why
[26:57] did Solomon in Proverbs six only lists
[27:00] six or seven of these as Abominations
[27:03] when we've talked about some other ones
[27:05] and and why did he narrow it down to
[27:08] seven and they are so what we would not
[27:11] choose the world would choose what God
[27:13] hates is smoking and drinking and
[27:15] adultery and murder and then you come
[27:17] into the Christian realm and we would
[27:19] choose Abominations like somebody's
[27:21] wearing the wrong dress or church order
[27:24] or paying your tithes or false doct
[27:30] we would say that's that's a hate God
[27:32] hates that but here's these in Proverbs
[27:36] 6 maybe we tend to choose what we decide
[27:41] what God hates if it's in our hands we
[27:43] would not choose these things that
[27:47] Solomon narrowed it down to seven we
[27:50] probably wouldn't choose these as
[27:53] Abominations but they might be dead
[27:56] on that God hates these as they are the
[28:00] beginning of a lot of sin and they are
[28:03] related to the heart and they are
[28:05] related to hurting
