TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Hello everyone. Pastor Paula Fontaine and Literal Life Church in Petersburg, Michigan would like to invite you to take the next half hour and enjoy some time in the word of God. If you're hungry for more God, we believe you can be fed. And we pray that you'll be blessed. Visit our website for more information at literalife.urch. May God bless you, my friend. May the music and message encourage you today. [Music] There's torn up pes in this book. Words that tell me I'm no good. Chapters that defined me for so long. But the hands of grace and endless love dusted off and picked me up. told my heart that hope is never gone. God is in this story. God is in the details. Even in the broken parts, he holds my heart. He never fails. When I'm at my weakest, I will trust in Jesus. Always in the highs and lows. The one who goes before me. God is in this story. So if the storm you're walking through feels like it's too much, you wonder if he even cares at all. Well, hold on tight to what you know. He's promised he won't let you go. Your song of feelings written in his scars. God is in this story. God is in the details. Even in the broken parts, he holds my heart. He never fails. When I'm at my weakest, I will trust in Jesus. Always in the highest, the one who rose before me. God is in this story. And if it like addiction, if it like disease, he's the one who frees the prisoner. He's the healer of all things. And if it like depression, if it broken home, he's the one who holds your sorrow. He won't leave you here alone. Oh, God is in this story. God is in the details. Even in the broken parts, he holds my heart. He never fails. When I have my weakest, I will trust in Jesus always in the high and lows. The one who goes before me. God is in their story. [Music] Oh, God is in my story. God is in this story. God is in this story. God is in this story. God is in your story. [Music] And so Psalms 27 and I just want to emphasize just verse four and verse five this morning. One thing David says, "One thing have I desired of the Lord and that will I seek after." I want to focus on that that little sentence there, that beginning of the sentence that David said, "One thing have I desired of the Lord." Isn't it amazing that a man of God can come down to one most important one desire? There's only one desire that I have. How many would like to say, I'd like to get my life to that. That really at the end of everything, I really have one desire. Kind of simplifies life, doesn't it? We have a lot of desires. We got a lot of things we want to do, a lot of things we want to accomplish. But this is when a man is growing in the Lord. You know, you know what? He's he's hit this spot where he says, "One thing have I desired. One thing." And there's no Calvary yet. This is before the New Testament. This is the Old. There's no Holy Ghost yet. And yet he says, "I desire this." And this is what he desires. One thing I have a desire of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his temple. That's amazing. Remember David's the one now who always talked about how much he enjoyed coming to the house of the Lord. He said one place I was glad when they said unto me, let us go to the house of the Lord. And if you're not there, you ought to pray that you get there. Amen. I was glad when they said unto me, he said, "A day in thy courts is better than a thousand." There was something about David that he loved to be at the house of God. But I want to say it wasn't because of the building. It wasn't because of the temple. He gives why he wants to be there. He said that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord. You know what? It's not about the building. It's about who's there. But we elaborated many things on the time of trouble. So that you know that without a doubt, no generation has ever seen these type of pressures. No generation has ever seen the type of trouble that we face every day. And the demonic attacks on God's people. There is no age that's ever had it quite like this. And that's why he called it the time of trouble. All generations have had trouble, but there's been no trouble like the trouble that we face every day. Every demon in hell is against the Christian standing for truth. Every devil in hell has its guns pointed at anybody. Any young person, anybody who tries to take a stand for the message of Christ for the last days, every gun is trained on you. Can you say amen? There is demonic forces and mind battles. There is depression. There is uh confusion. There's and and we elaborate on these things. The the mind and the spirit being confused and being tossed about. And it's not only unbelievers that face that. It's believers as well. There's great mind battles. There's great pressures that go with this age. And this generation has uh is seeing the type of trouble and demonic force that's never been seen before. And uh to be honest with you, I'm still pulled sometimes uh to continue to preach the subtle traps that are in our day because they're not traps that were in Luther's day or Wesley's day or during the the dark ages. They had different pressures. They had different temptations. Uh if they stood for Christ, they could have their head cut off. Uh it was different a different type of pressure. Today, they won't cut your head off, but Satan would try to confuse your mind. Satan will try to bring doubts in your mind. Satan will make you doubt your salvation. Doubt that you have the Holy Ghost. Satan will take a mistake that you've made and even though you brought it under the blood, Satan can still try to use it to keep you defeated. And this is the type of enemy we face. And so I feel pulled to continue to talk about such subtle traps that we have today to hold these last days pressures in front of you and uh and and and and to bear through uh the added pressure that's on a preacher like myself. If I hold these things in front of you, uh quite often I become the bad guy who's exposing things in our lives that the devil's using to defeat us. Quite often I become the bad guy. And I don't like being the bad to be honest with you. I don't like being the bad guy. But somebody has to speak truth. That's right. Somebody has to be willing. Sometimes people look at you as the bad guy, but you see now we have to look at it the right way. But I'm willing to do that. I actually am is am dedicated. I'm called to God not to get up here and tell you what you want to hear, but to proclaim truth whether it encourages, convicts, whatever it does. I've got to speak it all. I've got to say what God told me to say. And I have a responsibility to do that. But it doesn't make you too uh popular. Sometimes it's not a pleasant position uh pray for me. And the reason that I make it is because I have a lot of people praying for me. But it is not a pleasant position to point out all the conditions of evil of this hour and the traps that come to believers lives even. It is not a even easy place. But I'm determined to speak what God gives us to help us in this hour. And there are so many things uh that we could speak about. But you see now um as we come to this, we we we want to uh move on from those scriptures of the time of trouble. And I'm sure more things will come up. But I want to move into the scripture into the next spot here and and to be able to speak about this next part uh which speaks about what his answer is to this. uh we can have uh you know uh this he speaks of a place you know he actually gives the answer for all of this pressure and last Sunday I broke down Psalms 27 and talked about all the things similar to this age that we're going through and I trust that was a blessing to you but God's answer was not that we fight against all the uh politics or fight against things God's answer to this age was he said I'm going to hide you in my pavilion. We wouldn't think that's an answer, but that's God's answer. Often we try to find our own answers, but God's answer to the pressure, the depression, the mental instability. God's answer is that I have a place for you of rest. I have a pavilion. I have a secret. And the very reason he names it secret is that it's not for everybody, but it's for my people so they can come into a place of rest and peace. Kind of like a pre-rapture condition. Can you say amen? I have a place of protection. A pavilion is a place of protection. And as we get along studying that, we'll see a pavilion can also be a royal pavilion. And a royal pavilion is a place where the royal soldiers are given a special place to come back and re refresh themselves from battle and to be able to get in that protected pavilion. I believe God's provided provided not just a pavilion but a royal pavilion. Praise the Lord. It's a place of protection. It's a place of release and refreshment. It's a place of peace. It's a place of stability. It's a place that's insulated from us crashing like the rest of the world. Can you say amen? It's a temporary holding place above our enemies and above our fears. It's a safe bomb shelter from Satan's bombs and missiles that he shoots at us. Satan can buzz around, but he can't really completely get to you like he couldn't get to Job. He wanted to get him. He said, "You can mess with his entire life, his emotions, everything you want to, but you'll never take his soul. I've got confidence in his soul." Now, friends, if God had confidence in Job to say to Satan, "Go ahead, do what you want to to him." If he had confidence in Job before the Holy Ghost, before Calvary, then I believe he's got confidence in what he's deposited in your life, that it's going to weather the storm. Satan, go ahead. God has confidence in what he places within us. God has confidence and Satan can buzz around, but the answer is I'm going to give you a hiding place. I'm going to put you in a place of protection. In the next few weeks, the Lord willing, we'll go into what that means, that hiding place, what it means, all the wonderful things. Been listening to the messages and listen all the things leading up to that. And so, we're we're looking at some wonderful things. Uh it's so wonderful. He says, you know, a man can live so hidden in Christ that the devil doesn't know how to get to him. That's right. This a pretty powerful place to live. He doesn't know how to affect us as much as he affecting the rest of the world. We're emotional, we're going to be affected by some things, but he's got a place that the devil, he said he can be so hidden and all of his channels cleaned out. There's not a place for the devil could to get in because it's been blown out by the Holy Spirit. and all those channels are cleaned up, filled with the Holy Ghost. Can I get an amen this morning? God has a place that he's provided. But before we go into that in the next few weeks, the Lord willing, I can't skip over verse four and verse five in this rapture chapter. And that's the text we read when David said, "One thing have I desired." and that's to dwell in his house, in his presence every day of my life. And if that's the rapture chapter and that's what David gives is the answer from God, if that's David's desire, it ought to be our one desire. Not just on Sundays, but every day. And I I think it's interesting that God gives this hiding place. Listen now. God gives this place for us. But then David desires it. God gives us one place of protection to be in today. And David has one desire to be in there. I believe that it's not going to work if just God provides what we need in this hour. We have to desire it. God, help us that it' be the same testimony. One thing have I desired above money, above retirement, above that new truck. I'm hitting you, brothers. Above that new house, above all these other things. No, no, no. It all fades away. And you can't even trust family sometimes. Oh, don't put all your eggs in one basket in your family. They'll disappoint you. If I can just have my family and you hang tightly onto the family, sometimes they won't always be there for you. But I can tell you a presence that will always be there for you. You can't hang tightly onto anything in this life except what God has provided. And so now if God gives you one place and one answer and one I I want to call it a a spiritual place but I don't want to overspiritualize it but he's provided this position this place that you can come into in Christ and he's provided that one place. It's the one answer for all of the trouble of this generation. Then we ought to have one desire above all desires and that is I want to live in that place. One thing have I desired. His desires were in line with the place that God provided. It would do no good if God provided a secret place if we did not have passion to be in there. This place is mentioned, this phrase is mentioned in other places in scripture and uh it's I'll say it first. It was mentioned to the rich young ruler when he come to him for eternal life. Come to Christ and Jesus said you have you done the commandments? He said, "Yes, I've done all those things since I was a young boy. I've done all that, but I'm still I'm still hungering for something. I'm still looking for something." He was wanting the person of eternal life. And he was standing right in front of them in front of him. And he says, "Come and follow me." And he says, "I want I've done all these things right. I've been a good boy, but I'm still lacking the the the Holy Ghost in my life." You can have everything and still there's a hunger for something real in God. And you have to want that with a great passion. and I want it more than any other thing in life. And so, uh, he said to him though, he said, "One thing," he uses the same phrase, "One thing that you should do." So, now he simplifies it because we're always looking for a list of stuff to do. Yeah. How do I get from point A from point B? Because our bosses will tell us that or we're taught in class in order to get to this degree. You got this semester, this semester. And you know when I looked at that three years that four years that I have it was overwhelming for me. I felt like bailing out because everything we do we got a list in order to get to that you got this and this and you got to do this. You know what the way some people look at church and look at this message they look at as I got this whole thing to go through including what I wear in order to get to Christ. I want to tell you that's not true. God hasn't provided a list for us. God's asked for a surrender. And people don't come and they quit coming because they're going through their minds and they're figuring, I'm going to have to do this. I'm going to have to give up this. I'm going to have to give up this. And so it's just it's too overwhelming. I can't do it. I can't do it. And the very fact you're saying, I can't do it. That's a good statement. Can I get an amen? That's a good that if you really believe that, you can't do it. You can't do it by yourself. You can't measure up. Measure up. You can never be good enough on the outside to make it into the grace of God. That's not how he set this up. But we have a whole list and I have to give this up. And most of the time, people are looking more to what they have to give up than what they get. But you see now when he spoke to the rich young ruler, he honed in on one thing that would be more important than eternal life. He asked him, "Did you do the commandments?" But that wasn't the real big issue. He found and the only reason Jesus is saying, "I'm going to put my finger on the one place in your life that's more important and that's all the riches you have because he know in his heart that's more important to you than eternal life." Even though he's saying, "I want eternal life. I want eternal life." Okay. One thing you must do, go sell everything that you have and give it to the poor. I don't know how many minutes or hours he stood there and thought that through, but he turned it down. Now, a lot of people say, "That's mean. That's mean. That wasn't mean." The rich ruler is the one that's asking for eternal life. He's the one standing in front of found Jesus and asked. He asked. But you see, if we're not willing to give up sometimes the one thing, then we can't come to the simplicity of the one thing that God's going to give us. It's not complicated. It's not a sign. If I can just see a sign, it's not a sign. It's a surrender. Amen. It's just Lord, here I am. That's right. I don't know how to do all this. Amen. But I do know this. I don't want the world anymore. That's right. I don't want to play around anymore. I want you. And if you can hone in to my one desire is to be where you're at so you can change me. That's all God needs. So you have physical desires, you have emotional desires, and then of course you have spiritual desires. Every human being, I believe, has a soul and has a hunger for God, has a hunger to be filled by God. But most human beings will take even that thirst for God. And Satan will try to fill that void, that vacuum for God with other things. uh on Friday night and talking about the young people, talking to the young people about the little bit this and I was talking to them about managing their cravings because they have cravings. They have thirst. They have needs in their life and they become very prominent when they get uh into adolescence and they have these needs. They have these feelings and things going on and they're cravings and they're god-given cravings. And I I let them know my my title tonight is uh managing cravings. And I said, "This is not a little devotion on dieting. It's not what it is. It's it's more about your spiritual and emotional cravings. Uh one time we took a few weeks ago managing our time because Satan would like to us as a young person to waste our time. So we have to measure our time. We have to take a control of our time or Satan will fill our time with a bunch of junk. Can you say amen? So we need time with the Lord. We need to manage our time. Well, just like we manage our time, we manage our cravings. We must bring our cravings and our thirst under control of the Holy Ghost. And if we don't manage it, Satan will mismanage and Satan will abuse our cravings. Very true. And it and it seems like you see it seems like there's a crossover. The basic need of course is for food. But first of all, people when they need to eat, then they get hungry enough, they'll get any kind of food. They'll get in a garbage can and get anything. If they can't find food, they're going to eat out of a garbage can. Well, isn't that similar with every thirst that we have? If we don't get to the right food, the right word for our soul, we'll eat anything. We'll get on the internet and feed our soul anything. And that's not good cuz there's junk food out there. That's right. Can you say amen? there's junk food out there. And so with any need that we have when become become so desperate, we'll eat out of a garbage can. And then they cross over a bit because then you eat because uh you it's been proven that you you eat a lot or you overeat sometimes or you eat the wrong things not because you're hungry, but because you have another emotional need. Uh, don't think that I'm going to talk like an expert on this. I'm not an expert. You wouldn't listen to me anyway. I'm not an expert on the dieting thing, but I am certainly learning. I told you I'm on a journey and I'm learning. And one of the things they've said for years and we're finally listening is that sometimes it's not a food problem. It's that it's a it's a crossover. There's another emotional need that's not being fulfilled and you're trying to fill it with food. How many's heard that before? You see, so if you don't address the emotional need, you can be on 50,000 diets. You can and and I've been on a lot of them myself. You know, the uh I went on a 30-day diet one time and I lost a month. Trust me, I've seen the diets and I, you know, I've been through a lot of them and and you know, I still trying to conquer this thing and I will conquer it by the grace of God because I told the ministers that I have donelap disease. My belly done lapped over my belt and that's the problem. That's it's a disease. But when you start to look at this, you see that it can cross over into another emotional need. Let me say it this way is that when we have sometimes problems come in our lives and we look at the reason for the problem and we look for the answer for the problem. But many of the problems boil back to some emotional need that's not being met or wasn't met early in your life. And now you still have that need, appreciation, significance, a need for significance, a desire for significance, a desire for approval, a desire for praise, a desire for worth. And you have that, it wasn't fulfilled. So now you go about life trying to fill it other ways so you can fill that need. But unless you address the need and the real desire there, then you see now something else can fill its place. So people could eat because there's another emotional need. And that's true in the spiritual need for God. Satan fills other things to fill a spir spiritual need and a desire and a hunger for God. Can you say amen? I'm attracted to Twinkies. And one of the I was attracted real young to Twinkies because I I was so attracted to Twinkies when I was a a little boy that it made me steal them. It was one of my first sins. as me and the the neighborhood boys concocted a plan, as we watched a big uh hostess truck come by the back of the shopping center in Lima every day. And we begin to watch this and we watched it together. Every day it comes the same time. And and the driver goes inside for about a half hour and it was open game. Come on people, you should like me. I'm confessing one of my first sins to you. But I had never went for those Twinkies and we did. And we took a bunch of them and I we went out in the woods and I think we ate them all in one shot right out in the woods. We did it. It's out there. I stole Twinkies. But that wasn't it so much as as much as it I had to have an attraction. I had to have something craving that. So now I know this is real simple, but you look at this and you say, I'm trying to get you to look at the depths of your desires, right? That we want something, but what is it that we really need? How many times do we make choices because we we want something, but we don't really spiritually need it, but because we want it, we go get it. Now, David, come down. there's one thing I desire. He honed in as just one thing I desire. But David, remember David was a man, he had many desires. He he had many things to accomplish in his kingdom. And yet, he could come down to one desire. Matter of fact, some of David's desires were not that great. He actually made mistakes with some of his desires. That's right. And you know about his mistakes. They're not hidden in the Bible. And he went and committed adultery with Basheba out of what? starting with a desire but a desire became perverted. He wasn't happy with his own situation. And so he went to someone else. And so now we find David after going through all those things, he must have come to a place that through all that, God's forgiven me. Psalms 51 is where he repents. God forgives him. God washes it away. But through these mistakes, you learn something. And you should learn about your desires. You should learn that I better bring my desires and keep them pure under the Holy Ghost because Satan can manipulate and abuse pure desires. Thank you for watching our service today.
