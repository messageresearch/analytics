[26:10] God bless you. Good to have you. And I
[26:11] know the roads got a little slick on us,
[26:13] but we were determined. We weren't some
[26:15] We weren't gonna miss church tonight.
[26:17] Uh, Sister Jamie was just telling me

[26:28] safety and all that he is this evening.
[26:30] And it's good to be in fellowship with
[26:31] all of you. Is that brother Dan and
[26:34] Sister Elva here on a Wednesday night

[26:39] man. And just relax, enjoy the service.
[26:42] And there's not, you know, 250 people

[26:48] Praise the Lord. He had to come in and
[26:49] do some measurements here with his
[26:51] brother-in-law. Good to have you here
[26:52] tonight, sir. God bless you. Some work
[26:54] to the church. So, we appreciate it so
[26:56] much. Is that brother Eli and sister
[26:59] Lydia with us as well. Tucson, man.
[27:04] We're blessed. Praise the Lord. Good to
[27:06] have all you and all of our visitors
[27:07] tonight. God bless you. Let's turn in
[27:09] our Bibles to Psalms 71 if you would.
[27:12] And um we're remembering in prayer. Did
[27:15] did they mention my sister Sharon in the
[27:17] prayer request?
[27:18] &gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah. She just this afternoon had
[27:21] uh first treatment there. So she was in
[27:23] a lot of pain when she left and uh so it
[27:25] was a kind of a rough treatment as well
[27:27] today. So let's be in prayer for her
[27:29] tonight if you would remember her. While
[27:31] the word's being preached, I believe the
[27:32] Lord can bring healing.
[27:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Psalms 71, a couple scriptures in
[27:38] 71 verse 20 and 21. And tonight I'm
[27:42] finishing um 12-part series on the key
[27:45] to he cares do you care out of that
[27:48] message of brother Brandham. He cares do
[27:49] you care. So I'm finishing that up
[27:51] summarizing it and uh just bringing our
[27:53] last few points out of it. We've been
[27:55] enjoying so much this last year. Psalm
[27:58] 71 and verse um 20 and 21. I hope I have
[28:02] the right one here.
[28:06] Thou which hath showed me great and sore
[28:08] troubles shalt quicken me again and
[28:12] shall bring me up again from the depths
[28:14] of the earth. So many scriptures like
[28:17] this that show how far we think we can
[28:20] go where God can't reach us. But there's
[28:22] not God can reach us wherever we're at
[28:25] and deeper in the depths of it just is
[28:27] amazing. Thou shalt increase my
[28:30] greatness and comfort me on every side.
[28:34] And then let's read the original text
[28:36] that uh brother Brandon read in his
[28:38] service, He Cares, Do You Care, which
[28:40] would be 1 Peter chapter 5. And to wrap
[28:43] this up tonight, we just wanted to read
[28:44] that scripture and remind us again of
[28:47] the text for the series. 1 Peter chapter
[28:50] 5 and verse
[28:52] um six. Humble yourselves, therefore,
[28:54] under the mighty hand of God, that he
[28:57] may exalt you in due time, casting all
[29:01] your care upon him, for he carth for
[29:05] you. In other words, that means casting
[29:08] all your casting everything casting your
[29:11] worries. cares usually is worries,
[29:13] anxieties, but I believe it's saying
[29:16] here we can take everything, everything
[29:18] that we can't understand, every burden,
[29:21] every need, everything. There's nothing
[29:23] too big for God.
[29:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[29:25] &gt;&gt; And he wants us to come in humility
[29:28] because the scripture before it is about
[29:30] to humble ourselves. You have to humble
[29:32] yourself before you can say, "God, I
[29:35] need you and I'm going to turn this care
[29:37] over to you." We hold on to a lot of
[29:39] stuff. And you know why we hold on to
[29:41] some of it? because of pride.
[29:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[29:43] &gt;&gt; But when we humble ourselves before God,
[29:46] then he says, "Cast all of your cares
[29:48] upon him
[29:50] &gt;&gt; because he cares for you." And this is
[29:51] the text, he cares. Do you care? And so
[29:54] I think we can learn something very
[29:57] profound out of that for our lives. So
[29:59] we just want to finish this up tonight
[30:00] and we'll just ask the Lord to help us.
[30:02] Heavenly Father, grant to us strength in
[30:04] your word tonight. And we're thankful
[30:06] for protection and safety to be able to
[30:08] come out to the house of God. And also
[30:10] all the others, Lord, from many places
[30:12] that uh distances, Lord, that are not
[30:14] able to come. Bless each one that hears
[30:16] the sound of the word tonight. We pray
[30:18] it would go forth, Lord, with power,
[30:20] with demonstration, not just in this
[30:23] service, but in our lives, Lord. Make it
[30:25] real to us, Lord, and draw us closer as
[30:27] sons and daughters of God to that
[30:29] perfect way. We pray in Jesus name.
[30:31] Amen. God bless. You may be seated. So,
[30:35] saints of God, as we just wrap up this
[30:37] series, I I see a a final theme here
[30:41] running in this service towards the end
[30:43] of the service to the middle and towards
[30:45] the end. And I didn't want to finish
[30:47] this without uh bringing this theme that
[30:49] I'm uh seeing in here towards the end of
[30:52] it. I'm actually going to do something
[30:54] uh a bit unique in that I I'm going to
[30:56] let brother Brandon himself finish this
[30:57] service out tonight for the last 15 20
[31:00] minutes or so because once we lay in
[31:02] this theme then he uh he has some pretty
[31:05] nice things at the end of the service to
[31:06] say pretty pretty good. So I may just
[31:08] play that off of my phone and uh you can
[31:11] listen to it in the way he says it
[31:12] because it's just it's a better summing
[31:14] to everything I think than I could ever
[31:16] do. So, you know, for maybe those who
[31:19] are visiting, I approached this message
[31:21] of he cares. Do you care? I approached
[31:24] it a bit different. And we see in there
[31:26] a key to unlocking a supernatural God.
[31:30] Not now. There's some people in the
[31:32] world that are hungry for a supernatural
[31:34] God. They actually would like it. But we
[31:37] there's a people on the face of the
[31:38] earth that they don't want to just hear
[31:40] stories about it. They actually want to
[31:42] draw him into their lives. And that's a
[31:44] certain group of people. I believe I'm
[31:46] preaching to some of them tonight. I I
[31:48] desire that because I don't need a
[31:50] distant God. I don't need a God that's
[31:51] just in books and tapes. I don't need a
[31:53] God that's just in my Bible. I need a
[31:55] God every day that can be real to me
[31:57] that I can bring into life situations.
[32:00] And so, sons of God are always looking
[32:02] to those keys that that unlocks our
[32:05] faith and unlocks God and moving the
[32:07] heart of God. And there's so many keys
[32:09] the Lord's blessed us with last
[32:11] especially the last few years not just
[32:13] me and other ministry bringing those
[32:14] little keys and only sons are looking
[32:16] for those there's a key right there's
[32:18] something that unlocks the door that
[32:20] unlocks more faith and that unlocks
[32:22] moving the heart of God. None of us
[32:24] would have thought that what Haddie
[32:25] Wright said so moved the heart of God.
[32:28] The way she said it, the motive she said
[32:30] it, what she said, we would have never
[32:32] dreamed that that just moved God and
[32:33] he'd come into the room in such a
[32:34] special way. Said, "Ask anything that
[32:36] you will." So, we need to be open. Say,
[32:38] "Lord, teach us your ways as sons." Cuz
[32:41] I don't want to do the things that
[32:42] grieve you. I want to do the things that
[32:44] please him. I want to say the right
[32:46] word. I want to create the right
[32:48] atmosphere. I want to do the right
[32:51] things that God is welcome in my home.
[32:53] He's welcome in my life. He's welcome in
[32:55] my thoughts. He's welcome in my heart.
[32:57] So that any given moment, God can
[32:59] express himself as a supernatural God.
[33:01] And it's only a a special group of
[33:03] people on the face of the earth that
[33:05] really want to bring him and invite him.
[33:07] And you remember brother Brandham
[33:08] talking about uh he always comes where
[33:11] he's invited. But then one minister one
[33:13] day preached when I was a young kid. I
[33:15] remember him saying it's not just that
[33:16] you invite him, is he welcome? because
[33:18] the late because the the Pharisees
[33:20] invited him for the party, but he wasn't
[33:22] welcome.
[33:24] &gt;&gt; So, there's a group on the face of the
[33:25] earth. It's not just we're inviting you
[33:26] to come. You're welcome to come and take
[33:29] over. You're welcome to be God. Can you
[33:31] say amen? And so, so there's a key here
[33:34] to unlocking the supernatural God. And
[33:36] it's crucial that we in the times we
[33:38] live in know how and what moves the
[33:41] heart of God and that we can find access
[33:44] to him. We need him so much more than
[33:46] we've ever needed him before. I guess we
[33:49] could all agree on that tonight. We need
[33:51] his supernatural hand in our life more
[33:53] than we ever needed it before. We're
[33:55] dealing with pressures and things that
[33:56] we have never dreamed we'd ever see. And
[34:00] a lot of it, it's not you. I know the
[34:01] devil is trying to tell you it's you,
[34:03] but it's not you. It's your position in
[34:06] Christ that Satan hates so much.
[34:09] &gt;&gt; It's how close we are to the wrap-up.
[34:11] It's how angry Satan is as the bride
[34:14] becoming one with him. So a lot of times
[34:16] we look at our problems and say it's me
[34:18] or my mistakes or and sometimes it is
[34:20] but a lot of times we're taking all the
[34:22] blame when we have to realize we're
[34:24] living in the final stages of judgment
[34:26] coming. We're living in pre-tribulation.
[34:29] We're not it's not like it was a 100
[34:31] years ago. We're living in different
[34:33] times where I've quoted this scripture
[34:35] and over and over again this week to
[34:37] myself that we battle not against flesh
[34:39] and blood.
[34:41] IT'S NOT YOUR BROTHER. IT'S NOT YOUR
[34:43] SISTER. IT'S NOT YOUR WIFE. IT'S NOT
[34:45] YOUR EMPLOYER. CHRISTIANS DON'T BATTLE
[34:47] FLESH and blood, BUT AGAINST
[34:49] PRINCIPALITIES AND POWERS AND spiritual
[34:51] wickedness in high places. So, we need
[34:54] to be adults in the in the Lord to
[34:56] realize just in the other dimension,
[34:58] there's demons fighting us every day,
[35:00] whispering. They're not out there.
[35:02] They're right next to our ear.
[35:04] &gt;&gt; And we have to have the faith to respond
[35:06] to that and realize that that we need a
[35:08] God that's on the scene. We don't need a
[35:10] religion. We need a God that's real. And
[35:12] we need his presence invited into the
[35:14] chaos of our world. Maybe not this
[35:17] world, but our world. We need a
[35:18] supernatural God in it. And so the world
[35:21] and our enemy, it's the world and our
[35:23] enemy who locks our hearts so God can't
[35:26] do what he wants to do.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; It's the world and Satan that likes to
[35:30] keep our hearts locked up.
[35:33] &gt;&gt; And I have I have found something, you
[35:35] know, something about being locked. I
[35:36] was just telling a brother this the
[35:38] other day is that when you have
[35:39] something locked up and your heart can
[35:42] be locked up. You can be a Christian and
[35:44] your heart's locked up. It's locked up
[35:46] by the past. It's locked up by the devil
[35:48] beating you up. It's locked up. You
[35:50] can't you can't fully give your heart
[35:52] because it's locked up by something. And
[35:54] Satan loves that. He comes to He's a
[35:57] thief that likes to kill, steal, and
[35:59] destroy a believer's victory. And so
[36:02] your hearts can be locked up, but you
[36:04] can you can go to a lock and you can try
[36:07] to beat the lock. You can try to get
[36:10] something and and pry the lock. But the
[36:13] easiest way to get that lock open is to
[36:16] find the key.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[36:20] &gt;&gt; So if there's a heart locked up, you can
[36:22] be a preacher and just beat people over
[36:24] the head and try to knock that lock off.
[36:26] NO. IF YOU TAP INTO A SUPERNATURAL God
[36:28] and that person catches the key, that
[36:30] key unlocks that locked up heart. And
[36:32] all of a sudden, their heart's open to
[36:34] God. When I'm counseling, I'm looking
[36:36] for a supernatural God to COME IN AND
[36:38] UNLOCK THE KEY THAT THAT HEART IS LOCKED
[36:40] UP.
[36:41] &gt;&gt; As soon as that key is placed in there,
[36:43] it unlocks it. And all of a sudden, the
[36:45] devil better be on the trail because
[36:47] we're going after him.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; He cares. Do you care? I've labeled as a
[36:53] is a key to sons and daughters of God.
[36:55] It's a key. And the key was mainly is
[36:58] that he cares. Now, all of us know that.
[37:00] If I said, "Do you know that God cares?"
[37:02] Amen. He cares. All of us know that. But
[37:05] how much does he want to care? And
[37:07] brother Bram didn't just say, "Preach
[37:08] God cares." He said, "Do you care?"
[37:12] &gt;&gt; And that's the key because you can't
[37:14] bring two omnipotence together. You
[37:17] can't bring God stepping in on the scene
[37:20] to show he cares if someone doesn't
[37:22] really care. Oh, I want deliverance. I
[37:25] WANT TO GO DO THIS. And do you really
[37:26] mean it? Do you really care? God knows
[37:28] if you mean it.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; God knows if you want to repent. You
[37:31] want to confess? You want to do things
[37:33] right? You want to head towards God. You
[37:35] want to lay it all on the table. God can
[37:36] see your heart whether you do. And if
[37:38] you're not willing to do that, we've
[37:39] learned in this series, then you're
[37:41] limiting God from showing for showing
[37:43] how much he cares to change you and to
[37:45] change situations that you can't change.
[37:48] So, this is the key. If if nobody else
[37:50] was able to listen to this whole series,
[37:52] I'm giving you the summary tonight. The
[37:54] key in he cares, do you care? Is that he
[37:56] cares? But do you care? And when you
[37:59] bring those two things TOGETHER
[38:00] SINCERELY, NOW WE KNOW God's sincere,
[38:03] but we got to make sure we're sincere.
[38:04] And when you bring that together, the
[38:07] God of impossibilities,
[38:09] &gt;&gt; THE GOD, THE SUPERNATURAL GOD KNOWS
[38:13] you're you care.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; That's right. And there's not much at
[38:15] that point that can stop our Lord or
[38:18] stop the to keep the devil uh from
[38:21] stopping this from happening.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; It's a key. Can you say amen?
[38:26] &gt;&gt; So, when we really want to help and care
[38:29] by repentance and confession and action,
[38:31] that's what we were on a couple weeks
[38:32] ago. Repentance, confession. These are
[38:35] the simple things God uh gave through
[38:37] his prophet. Repentance, confession, and
[38:39] showing action and showing fruits that
[38:41] were serious and sincere. God sees that
[38:43] and then he shows he cares. But at the
[38:46] end of the sermon is this really
[38:49] powerful theme that he shows the depth
[38:53] of how much God cares. And this is it.
[38:57] The depth of how much God can care that
[39:00] even after judgment is pronounced
[39:06] &gt;&gt; and you're actually living under some of
[39:09] the results of the judgment. We could
[39:11] apply that to our life. The sewing and
[39:13] reaping principle. You sowed a lot of
[39:15] bad seeds and even though you're a
[39:17] Christian, you're still reaping a
[39:18] harvest from that. That's reality.
[39:20] Because that's a biblical principle.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; Say, "No, no, I'm a believer now." No,
[39:24] no, no. The only way you can fix some
[39:26] things is to start planting the right
[39:28] seeds
[39:29] &gt;&gt; and you'll get a good harvest. But there
[39:31] are some things that that carry on
[39:33] because it's the sewing and reaping
[39:35] principle. And so now you live under
[39:37] certain things with that. But even the
[39:39] judgments of God can be pronounced. And
[39:42] you can live under some of those results
[39:44] of jud judgment being pronounced. But
[39:47] even then, he can show he cares
[39:52] &gt;&gt; by giving a way out
[39:55] &gt;&gt; when judgment is hanging over the whole
[39:57] world.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; If if there's somebody interested
[40:00] sincerely in caring and repenting, God
[40:04] will provide a way out of it even in
[40:05] judgment.
[40:07] It's powerful, friends.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; It's powerful because it if something
[40:11] looks like it's gone too far, this is
[40:13] the way we look at things. They've gone
[40:15] too far. It's irreparable. It's
[40:18] hopeless. You know, that's that's not
[40:21] speaking God's dialect.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[40:25] &gt;&gt; You got to speak God's language. And you
[40:27] start labeling things like hopeless. Uh
[40:30] you know, it's not it's too far. It's
[40:33] gone too far. They've crossed the line.
[40:36] you know, uh, he's showed a pattern of
[40:38] up and down, of unfaithfulness his whole
[40:41] life. And and and and so we speak that
[40:44] kind of language, BUT GOD DOESN'T speak
[40:46] that kind of language because we CAN SEE
[40:49] SITUATIONS IN THE BIBLE and maybe even
[40:52] your OWN LIFE WHERE GOD HAS STEPPED IN
[40:55] WHEN WE DIDN'T EVEN DESERVE IT.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; WHEN WE DIDN'T DESERVE IT. AND THE
[41:00] UNFAITHFULNESS IS THERE. And and and IT
[41:03] LOOKS LIKE THAT'S GO IT'S GONE TOO FAR.
[41:05] AND HE CAN SHOW HE cares by giving a way
[41:08] out. I think that's a loving God. We
[41:10] ought to thank him tonight. Thank you,
[41:12] Lord.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; Because if something looks too far, it's
[41:16] a pattern of up and down. We tend to
[41:18] label it ah, you know, that's a pattern
[41:21] through the years of up and down, in and
[41:23] out, you know, saying sorry and, you
[41:26] know, then going back to something. And
[41:28] so when we know this principle that God
[41:31] can step in, God God the depths of he
[41:34] cares. This builds faith that even after
[41:37] he should have given up or it looks like
[41:40] he even g it looks like sometimes he
[41:42] even gave up. You look at this in God's
[41:44] people Israel is that it looks like in
[41:47] God's language sometimes the way he
[41:49] talks to them it looks like he's giving
[41:51] up. And yet you can find the threat of
[41:53] redemption even though it appears God
[41:55] said that's just get stand out of the
[41:58] way. I'm just going to wipe them off the
[42:00] face of the earth.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; And even in that
[42:05] &gt;&gt; David he's tapping into his tender
[42:08] mercies he called them.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; And sometimes those tender mercies is to
[42:14] a people that didn't even deserve it.
[42:16] And yet if if one person will turn and
[42:18] say God I am sorry. Forgive me. Is there
[42:21] any way out of this? our Lord reaches us
[42:24] out his hand
[42:26] &gt;&gt; and even the whole na the whole nation
[42:28] that's why you know we we brought this
[42:30] up uh with Josiah the last few months
[42:32] pre preaching about him a few services
[42:34] and the last thing I was bringing is
[42:36] that when he went to that prophetus and
[42:38] asked I'm reading the book I want to
[42:40] start a revival I want to clean the
[42:42] temple I want to do all this and she
[42:44] said because your heart was tender
[42:45] towards the Lord because you felt that
[42:48] that that you wanted to change things
[42:50] and the book has been open to you God
[42:52] will bless whatever you do in the
[42:54] people, but the judgments over Israel
[42:56] still stands.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; That's what she said. So now that showed
[43:01] us that you can have a personal
[43:04] cleansing.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; REVIVAL
[43:08] EVEN THOUGH YOU LIVE in a nation that's
[43:09] already doomed.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Let's be honest.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; This the world and this nation has been
[43:17] pronounced by God's prophet. It's under
[43:19] God's judgment. It's not if, it's when.
[43:21] It's headed to tribulation. It's sooner
[43:24] than we think. Can you say amen? There's
[43:26] no redemption for it. It's it's it's
[43:28] it's over. Can you say amen?
[43:31] &gt;&gt; Well, I shouldn't say there's no
[43:32] redemption because God's going to
[43:33] cleanse the whole thing and bring a new
[43:35] millennium for his people. So, there's
[43:36] redemption for the earth. But right now,
[43:38] we're on the verge of all that. And so,
[43:40] we live under those judgments. This
[43:42] whole world's been judged. The prince of
[43:45] and power of the air has already been
[43:47] judged.
[43:48] uh the denominational system has been
[43:51] indicted,
[43:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[43:54] &gt;&gt; Not the people, but let's pray because
[43:57] the whole denominational system received
[44:00] an indictment from God. You've crucified
[44:02] him. Aresh,
[44:03] &gt;&gt; it's already done. Been pronounced by
[44:06] his prophet. So now if you live in a
[44:08] time like that, um I just wanted to say
[44:13] that's a pretty troublesome time to live
[44:15] in as a believer because everything
[44:20] around us has been in a state of just
[44:24] basically barely surviving
[44:26] &gt;&gt; because the judgments of God are
[44:28] looming.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; And there's no trump that's going to fix
[44:31] it.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; There's no, you know, no, all due
[44:37] respect, but no, it's it's been
[44:40] prophesied in the Bible, but Josiah had
[44:44] that promise is that it's Israel's still
[44:46] going to go into captivity. My judgment
[44:48] still stand, but you have found
[44:52] &gt;&gt; grace like Noah, he found grace in the
[44:54] eyes of the Lord. God pronounced
[44:56] judgment over that whole thing. The rain
[44:58] is coming. He said, "But Noah found
[45:00] grace in the eyes of the Lord." How many
[45:02] needs his grace tonight to make it out
[45:03] of this in a rapture?
[45:06] &gt;&gt; And th to those who WANT TO THOSE WHO
[45:08] ARE LOOKING FOR HIS COMING TO THOSE WHO
[45:11] ARE LOOKING FOR IT AND PRAYING FOR IT
[45:12] SAY GOD GET ME OUT OF HERE.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; HE has a grace for those people.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So he builds our faith.
[45:19] And so Josiah was that way. He he had a
[45:22] temporary thing there. So and I also
[45:24] want you to read uh in Nehemiah chapter
[45:26] 9. And I won't have time to read it
[45:28] tonight. Maybe I'll pull one scripture
[45:30] out of it because it was such a blessing
[45:31] today to see. And this is the people.
[45:35] Let me just make one comment about it
[45:36] and and read Nehemiah 9 is so beautiful.
[45:40] And you remember now this whole chapter
[45:43] gives the history of e Israel from Abram
[45:45] all the way on. And it clearly shows the
[45:48] history. It's honest about all the
[45:51] things God did. Abraham, the promise,
[45:54] they went into the land, then they went
[45:56] into Egypt in bondage. So it gives the
[45:58] whole history and these are the people
[46:00] that's reading the book and the history
[46:02] in Nehemiah 9. These are the people who
[46:05] had lived through the whole process of
[46:08] being under God's judgments in Babylon
[46:12] for 70 years. And guess what God said?
[46:15] After 70 years, I'll bring you out.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; Here's the people in Nehemiah 9 that's
[46:20] standing back in their land rebuilding
[46:22] the temple.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; Absolutely amazing. And so these are the
[46:27] people that have come back. Now they're
[46:29] reading their history. They've been the
[46:31] hope through a process of being under
[46:33] God's judgments, having to live in
[46:35] Babylon, not their own land. And now
[46:36] they're generations later now. Now
[46:38] they're back seeing their temple
[46:40] restored. And they're reading the
[46:42] history. And you'll find, you're going
[46:44] to have to read it at home. How many
[46:45] promised to read um Nehemiah 9?
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Isabelle. Appreciate that.
[46:54] There's always homework that goes with
[46:55] these Wednesday nights, you know.
[46:57] There's always homework. So, Nehemiah 9,
[47:00] congratulations on your new job, by the
[47:02] way, Isabelle. Praise the Lord. God
[47:04] bless you there. Uh, see if they need
[47:07] any help. I might need a job after a
[47:09] while there, Isabelle. But you see now
[47:11] uh they're reading the history and and
[47:13] even they say in in in not so many words
[47:17] but just even when you did this even
[47:20] when Israel did this even when they
[47:22] rejected God in the wilderness it keeps
[47:24] giving the history we rebelled we were
[47:26] stiff necked we were it kept saying it
[47:28] but your tender mercies your mercies
[47:31] your mercies came to God's people and he
[47:34] says in one verse here in Nehemiah 9 I
[47:37] think let me just pick it up here in
[47:39] verse
[47:40] He goes through the whole history. Oh
[47:41] yes. He says verse 29,
[47:46] "And testified against them that thou
[47:48] mightest bring them again into thy unto
[47:49] thy law. Yet they dealt proudly and
[47:52] hearkened not under thy commandments,
[47:53] but sinned against thy judgments, which
[47:55] if a man do, he shall live in them, and
[47:57] withdrew the shoulder, and hardened
[47:58] their neck, and would not hear. Yet yet
[48:01] many years dust thou forebear them and
[48:04] testifies against them by thy spirit in
[48:08] your prophets. Yet would they not hear.
[48:11] Therefore gavest thou them into the land
[48:13] of the people of the lands.
[48:15] Nevertheless, for thy great mercy's
[48:18] sake, thou dost not utterly consume
[48:22] them,
[48:23] &gt;&gt; nor forsake them, for thou art a
[48:26] gracious and merciful God. They didn't
[48:30] even deserve it. And you find that all
[48:32] through the history is that they did it
[48:34] again. They failed again. You're talking
[48:37] about a people under Moses that seen the
[48:38] pillar of fire and seen the supernatural
[48:41] and they still were immatured and
[48:43] rebelled against God. You think that's
[48:45] it? We're writing them off. No. No. God
[48:48] said there's there's a there's a measure
[48:50] of grace. I got a quote to you read
[48:51] Sunday. It's just powerful. Uh I'm not
[48:54] going to let it out tonight. That way
[48:55] you'll come back Sunday.
[48:58] So, so now you know uh in all these
[49:02] examples including Josiah
[49:04] as we've been preaching on him to
[49:06] conclude now he shows God cares even
[49:11] when God shouldn't care. This is the
[49:14] theme he ends this with. Things can go
[49:16] pretty low stages of pretty low uh and
[49:20] then yet how no matter how low they get,
[49:22] there's a lifeline thrown out when the
[49:24] people of God want it. when you care,
[49:26] then he'll show he cares.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Why do we need to know this? Because we
[49:31] need to be mature.
[49:33] Let me say it this way. Why do we need
[49:35] to know this? Because we need to be
[49:37] mature and not write something or
[49:40] someone off too quickly.
[49:48] We need to be mature and not write
[49:50] someone or some church or some preacher
[49:54] or your brother or sister
[49:58] &gt;&gt; or they left.
[50:00] You know, I gave you the scripture
[50:01] Sunday afternoon there. Saul breathing
[50:03] out threatenings against the people of
[50:06] God. Just breathing out hatred. And you
[50:09] get that on the internet. people who
[50:11] have been in this message just breathing
[50:13] out just all kinds of venom and
[50:15] bitterness back towards it to get back.
[50:18] Some people I wonder why and they were
[50:19] some of them when are in our church and
[50:22] sometimes why don't you just we're not
[50:23] bothering you. Go live the way you want
[50:25] to live and God bless you. I'll shake
[50:26] your hand. Call your brother or sister.
[50:28] That's not good enough.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; And Paul he's breathing out just just
[50:32] venom and I'm taking these people. I've
[50:34] got letters. I've got endorsement for
[50:36] all the priests to go put these people
[50:38] in jail. And you know he's voted least
[50:41] likely to succeed in the kingdom of God.
[50:44] He would not get any votes from any
[50:47] Christians in that day as being the next
[50:49] guy to take the message to the Gentiles.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; What about what do you think about Saul?
[50:54] &gt;&gt; What are you crazy?
[50:56] &gt;&gt; Let's vote ON SAUL. I AIN'T VOTING for
[50:58] him.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; You hear what he SAID IN THE PAPER THE
[51:01] OTHER DAY? YOU HE SAID you you did you
[51:04] see the Facebook? DID YOU SEE WHAT HE
[51:06] WROTE ABOUT US? YOU SEE WHAT HE'S TRYING
[51:08] TO DO? WE WOULDN'T have given him any
[51:11] hope whatsoever. And yet God had his
[51:14] number.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; And so that's why we can't write anybody
[51:20] off.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; That's why we can't judge how much
[51:24] judgment they need to receive and they
[51:26] need to work their way back in penance
[51:28] or whatever else. We don't decide that.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, in a moment's time, the
[51:34] light CAME TO PAUL. IT WAS JESUS. And
[51:36] this man who was breathing OUT THREATEN
[51:38] IT GOT THE LIGHT AND WAS TAKEN OFF HIS
[51:41] HIGH HORSE. HE WAS BLINDED. CAN YOU SAY
[51:44] AMEN? Then he sent this man to pray for
[51:46] him and it was over. IT WAS DONE. THAT
[51:49] WAS IT. HE NOW WAS POSITIONED.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; To do completely the opposite of what he
[51:55] was doing.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; Why? Because God cares.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; And God's ways are higher than our ways.
[52:04] Hallelujah.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; We need to m be mature and not write
[52:07] somebody off or someone off too quickly.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; We need to be careful with the sword of
[52:15] this word that we have in this message.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Everybody listening?
[52:20] &gt;&gt; Because there's some preachers using
[52:21] this sword to slice up other preachers.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; And that's not what the sword is for.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; That's not what this message is for. to
[52:31] prove how better we are in doctrine.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; It's my church so I can be open tonight
[52:36] on this Wednesday night. This message
[52:38] was not given us to debate or to slice
[52:40] up everybody else or even to slice up
[52:43] the denominational people. We don't have
[52:45] a right to do that. That's not the
[52:47] spirit even brother Brandham WAS IN.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T FIND THAT. EVEN THOUGH HE
[52:52] BLASTED THE SYSTEMS, he had a respect
[52:55] level for the men he was preaching to
[52:57] and and COMPLIMENTED THEM OF HOW MUCH
[52:59] THEY knew Christ and what they did FOR
[53:01] THE LORD. THAT'S THE ATTITUDE we need.
[53:03] Can you say amen?
[53:04] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW THAT THEY COULD BE
[53:06] A SAW AND TAKE THIS MESSAGE SOMEDAY
[53:08] FURTHER THAN WHAT WE TOOK IT. THAT'S WHY
[53:10] WE NEED TO QUIT TRASHING EVERYBODY ELSE.
[53:14] QUIT SPEAKING IT WITH EVERYBODY ELSE.
[53:15] QUIT USING THE WORD AS A SWORD on one
[53:17] another and use it on the devil. The
[53:19] sword was meant to drive to the heart of
[53:22] the enemy, not your brother and sister.
[53:24] I can't get enough amens tonight. I know
[53:26] that's THE TRUTH. I KNOW that's the
[53:28] truth.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; But we have used it. It's kind of like
[53:32] uh James and John there getting so
[53:34] excited and they're just said, "Well,"
[53:36] they said, "Let's go, Jesus, and we'll
[53:38] just," they rejected. They said, "No,
[53:40] we'll burn the whole city up.
[53:44] WE'LL WE'LL CALL FIRE LIKE Elijah and
[53:47] we'll just burn, you know, we'll be like
[53:49] brother Brandham Elijah and we're just
[53:51] gonna They rejected this message. WE'LL
[53:53] BURN THE WHOLE city up. And those who
[53:55] know your Bible, that's what they were
[53:56] saying.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "You don't even know
[53:59] what spirit you're of."
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Bless God, we got the word. We're going
[54:05] to burn and fry them and be JUST LIKE
[54:08] PRO. GOD DIDN'T CALL YOU TO BE just
[54:10] like, brother Brandham. God didn't call
[54:12] you to be ELIJAH PASTOR. HE DIDN'T CALL
[54:15] YOU TO BE A PROPHET TO THE PEOPLE. HE
[54:17] CALLED you to be a pastor to the people.
[54:19] AND A PASTOR IS DIFFERENT than a
[54:20] prophet.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Lord.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; So, I'll say it again. Who would agree?
[54:28] We need to mature and not write
[54:30] something off or someone off too quickly
[54:36] &gt;&gt; because a person can go pretty low and
[54:39] we're going,
[54:41] I think they've crossed the line, but
[54:44] it's not up to us to make that decision.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; It is not up to you. Who died and made
[54:50] you boss?
[54:54] &gt;&gt; Who died and made you the complete
[54:56] judgment of all?
[54:59] Let's be careful. Can you say amen?
[55:01] &gt;&gt; So, this is how he brings in the theme
[55:02] and then I'll play the rest to you. But
[55:04] this is how he lays in. He says, and uh
[55:07] he cares. Do you care? Now, I'm coming
[55:08] to my text. I have a funny way of
[55:10] bringing I like to build up a lot of
[55:12] things and then hit my text. And now
[55:14] he's coming after talking about all
[55:15] these things that we've talked about the
[55:17] last uh 11 parts in this series. Now we
[55:20] find that in the days of Noah when God
[55:23] was going to judge the world when it
[55:25] come just like it is now because Jesus
[55:28] said it was he did he care? Did he care?
[55:32] He certainly he cared. He cared for
[55:34] what? Now after he had all listen this
[55:38] is the theme. After he had already know
[55:41] judgment was coming and had pronounced
[55:44] judgment he cared for those who cared.
[55:49] That's an incredible truth.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; After judgment was pronounced,
[55:54] &gt;&gt; there was so there was grace
[55:57] &gt;&gt; for those who cared.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Judgment had been pronounced. He cared
[56:04] for those who cared. And that's the same
[56:06] as it is today. He cared for those who
[56:09] were willing to care. And we find that
[56:11] he sent them a prophet to direct them to
[56:14] direct his elected people to its
[56:17] provided way for their escape. That was
[56:19] the ark. That was Noah's ark. He said,
[56:21] "How does how are they going to find
[56:22] grace?" God sent a prophet. The prophet
[56:24] pointed them to the ark for the hour.
[56:26] That was God's grace, too. How many
[56:27] knows God's when God sends a true
[56:29] prophet, it's his grace.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; And then he sends an ark, which is a
[56:33] type of the word to come into the ark.
[56:35] And so he pointed and so we find that he
[56:37] sent them a prophet to direct them to
[56:39] direct his elected people to its
[56:41] provided way for their escape. He's the
[56:43] same yesterday, today, and forever. You
[56:45] see, we find that God cared for his
[56:48] people. We're at the end. And we see
[56:51] we're at the end. There's not no way to
[56:54] build upon that corruption. Now, he's
[56:56] given the state of this world. There's
[56:58] nothing to build on. You can't build on
[56:59] this corruption. How can we build a city
[57:01] upon the charred ruins of Sodom and
[57:03] Gomorrah? How can we do it? I like that
[57:06] because he's given the conditions. We're
[57:08] in Sodom and Gomorrah.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; It's knocking at our doors. We have to
[57:12] put the token of protection around our
[57:14] children
[57:16] &gt;&gt; all the time.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; We are in Sodom and Gomorrah
[57:20] &gt;&gt; and the spirits of it around us. And
[57:22] there's no way to to correct it as the
[57:25] world. That's where how can we do it?
[57:28] There's only one phoenix left and that's
[57:31] the coming of the Lord Jesus.
[57:34] Praise the Lord. And that'll be his
[57:37] grace. So even after judgment,
[57:42] God sends his grace. I'm going to play
[57:44] the last part of this now, and you will
[57:47] find that he takes some extreme things
[57:49] to show us that God still cared. Notice
[57:53] the people's names that are mentioned
[57:54] from Noah all the way through. This is
[57:57] important because we are here under a
[57:59] world and a nation that has judgment has
[58:02] already been pronounced. As I just said,
[58:04] the denominational system has been
[58:06] indicted by God's prophet. The prince,
[58:09] Satan, has been judged already. And
[58:12] guess what? I believe Satan knows it. I
[58:16] know he knows he's been judged.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; And he knows he can't stop the
[58:21] revelation coming to this bride.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; He's trying. Christ the mystery God
[58:26] revealed. This is the revelation. Satan
[58:28] howls at it.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; He howls. He hates it. He doesn't hate
[58:32] you personally. This isn't a personal
[58:35] thing. He hates that you're becoming one
[58:38] with Christ. And guess what? You are
[58:40] becoming one with Christ.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; You're embracing this word. Who is it?
[58:43] This is Christ. You're becoming one with
[58:45] him. That's why you battle the devil so
[58:47] much.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; It's not your boss. And it's not it's
[58:50] not it's not flesh and blood. Can you
[58:52] say amen? It's principalities and powers
[58:54] that hate your position, hate your
[58:57] ONENESS WITH CHRIST. DESPITE YOUR
[58:59] MISTAKES AND ALL THAT YOU'VE DONE,
[59:01] THERE'S A ONENESS happening with you and
[59:03] your soul and God. And Satan hates that.
[59:05] He's howling at it. HE CAN'T STOP THIS
[59:08] REVELATION. It's in your ear all day.
[59:10] He's in your ear all day. How many would
[59:12] testify, "HE'S IN MY EAR ALL DAY LONG."
[59:15] Conditions we live in are results of
[59:17] being under God's judgment and
[59:18] pre-tribulation. Right now, we live on
[59:20] that under that. And yet, we can find
[59:23] grace and a God who cares in the middle
[59:26] of all that. We will need to know that
[59:28] especially in the coming days. I think
[59:30] it's going to get more pressure before
[59:32] the rapture as we just squeeze out of
[59:34] here.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; It's not going to light lighten up. Can
[59:38] you say amen? Satan's got not going to
[59:40] lighten up. He hates it. He'll fight any
[59:42] way he can. He's pronounced doomed. He's
[59:44] got pronounced he's got condemnation on
[59:47] him and he's going to he's like a he's
[59:49] like a mean angry wolf at the bride of
[59:52] Jesus Christ. He's just he's just
[59:54] venomous.
[59:57] at what we believe and what we stand
[59:59] for. Can you say amen?
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; He still is in our ear. And we need to
[1:00:04] know how to call on God.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; We need to know that God still responds
[1:00:12] to his elect when they truly repent.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; You need to know that because the devil
[1:00:17] says, "You you've gone too far. You
[1:00:19] don't have a right to talk to God." Now,
[1:00:22] we need to know we can talk to God. Can
[1:00:24] I get an amen tonight? We need to know
[1:00:26] this. When the devil's in our ear, YOU
[1:00:28] SAY, "WAIT A MINUTE. I GOT A RIGHT TO
[1:00:30] TALK TO MY GOD. I GOT A RIGHT. STEP
[1:00:32] BACK, SATAN."
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE A RIGHT TO CAST OUT DEVILS.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; DON'T FORGET THAT. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? WE
[1:00:39] BRING THE RIGHT ATMOSPHERE. WE REBRANDS
[1:00:43] IN OUR HOME. WE PUT IT IN FRONT OF OUR
[1:00:45] CHILDREN ALL THE TIME. WE HAVE A RIGHT
[1:00:47] TO THESE THINGS. WE HAVE A RIGHT TO CAST
[1:00:49] OUT THE DEVILS THAT ARE TALKING IN OUR
[1:00:51] EARS.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:00:53] HALLELUJAH.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; I talked to brother Diggs today. He
[1:00:56] says, "Let me know if you NEED TO COME
[1:00:57] UP THERE. I'LL DRIVE SOME DEMONS AWAY
[1:00:59] FOR YOU."
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT HE DOES. LET ME KNOW. HE
[1:01:03] SAID, I SAID, "WELL, CAN YOU COME THE
[1:01:04] 14TH?" I CAN'T COME THEN. I said, "We'll
[1:01:06] get you up because listen, we want
[1:01:08] anybody who's going to run the devils
[1:01:09] away,
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; but you don't need Brother Diggs to do
[1:01:11] that. YOU CAN DO THAT YOURSELF." AND
[1:01:13] THAT'S WHY YOU NEED TO KNOW YOU GOT A
[1:01:15] GOD WHO CARES.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; YOU REPENT TO HIM. AND HE'S RIGHT THERE
[1:01:21] to show he cares and ready to step in.
[1:01:24] And don't forget, he's a million times
[1:01:27] more powerful than anything the devil
[1:01:29] can put in your face.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Isn't God good?
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; God is good all the time.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Feel like preaching
[1:01:37] tonight for sure.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; So I want you to listen now to the
[1:01:44] extreme
[1:01:46] situations and the extreme he brother
[1:01:49] Brandham just seems to give the extreme
[1:01:50] extreme conditions Noah's day and all
[1:01:52] the way through. You're going to hear
[1:01:54] him talk about uh mostly about judgment
[1:01:57] being pronounced and people finding
[1:01:59] grace underneath that.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Noah found grace. He talks about
[1:02:03] Hezekiah was pronounced you got only so
[1:02:06] many days to live. That was it. We
[1:02:09] thought that was it. And then he comes
[1:02:10] back and he repents and said God God
[1:02:12] gave them more days.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; The Ninevites,
[1:02:16] God forgave the Ninevites when they
[1:02:18] repented.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; The judgments were over them. And even
[1:02:21] Jonah is surprised that God forgave him
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; and he's supposed to be the prophet of
[1:02:25] the day.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Judgments coming down on Egypt. And when
[1:02:30] the judgments are coming in the death
[1:02:31] angel, he gave a token for his people.
[1:02:34] Amen.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; He talks about outsiders. Brother Bram
[1:02:37] does not accepted in the people of God.
[1:02:40] Rahab, outsiders.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Don't you don't you label an outsider.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Don't you put them in a category.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; People that stood for the word and stood
[1:02:50] alone and ended up poor because of it
[1:02:53] and ended up depressed because of it.
[1:02:55] Elijah was one example. He stood for the
[1:02:57] word against Jezebel and then he stood
[1:02:59] alone by himself with the word. Became
[1:03:02] depressed. Became down. Had no money.
[1:03:04] Had no food.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; Rejected. Talks about a secret believer.
[1:03:10] Don't Don't write off the secret
[1:03:12] believers
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; because that might be a son of God and
[1:03:16] they're a secret believer. They'll come
[1:03:18] out of their closet someday.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Secret believers, ones who didn't get in
[1:03:25] the prayer line. He talks about
[1:03:28] you be listening talks about a neurotic
[1:03:32] talks about a harlot cast out by her
[1:03:36] parents. That's what I'm saying because
[1:03:37] he said it other places when she was
[1:03:39] just a little girl became a harlot
[1:03:41] living with all kinds of men selling
[1:03:44] herself.
[1:03:46] But
[1:03:47] God cared.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; God stepped in and show he cared.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; I love him tonight saints. God bless you
[1:03:54] as you listen to I'll let brother
[1:03:56] Brandham find finish this series
[1:04:00] of God and live by his word. Notice he
[1:04:04] cared for those who cared to escape in
[1:04:08] the days of NOAH AND HE SENT HIM A
[1:04:10] PROPHET AND THIS PROPHET DIRECTED THEM
[1:04:13] TO GOD'S PROVIDED WAY.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; NOW THAT'S GOD'S WAY OF DOING THINGS.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; SEE
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; GOD spoke to Noah which was the word. It
[1:04:21] wasn't the written word then and told
[1:04:23] Noah to prepare an audit for the saving
[1:04:25] of the people and to WARN ALL THE PEOPLE
[1:04:28] THAT HE HAD ONE WAY OF SALVATION.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; AND THIS MAN WAS A VINDICATED PROPHET
[1:04:34] THAT PROVED them the way of escape.
[1:04:38] NOTICE THE HUMBLE AND SINCERE HEARD THIS
[1:04:42] MAN AND believed him
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; and they escaped. They escaped what? the
[1:04:47] death of the world of sin that was being
[1:04:52] destroyed in that day. THEY ESCAPED THE
[1:04:55] DEATH ROUTE THAT WAS LAYING UPON THE
[1:04:57] WHOLE WORLD.
[1:05:00] GOD SO CARED.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; OH, GOD HELP US TO GO DOWN DEEP NOW
[1:05:06] before the prayer line.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; God cared.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Yes. HE LOOKS UPON THE WORLD NOW TODAY
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; AND HE'S CALLED AND HE'S CALLED AND HE'S
[1:05:17] SPURNED AND TURNED DOWN.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS A CHANCE OF repentance
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; at the beginning WHEN GOD TOLD ISAIAH TO
[1:05:26] GO UP AND PUT TELL HEZEKIAH HE'S GOING
[1:05:29] TO DIE. HEZEKIAH REPENTED.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; AND THERE WAS MERCY.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD TOLD JONAH TO GO TO NINEVE AND
[1:05:37] CRY OUT CUZ IN 40 DAYS HE DESTROYED A
[1:05:40] CITY. THEY CRIED OUT FOR MERCY AND THERE
[1:05:42] WAS REPENTANCE.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; But when they reject it, THERE'S NOTHING
[1:05:47] LEFT BUT JUDGMENT.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; AND THE NATION HAS REJECTED CHRIST.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; They failed to heed the call.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; So there's nothing left. But we're
[1:06:01] facing judgment.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; NOW, DOES GOD CARE ABOUT THOSE WHO HAVE
[1:06:07] REPENTED? AMEN.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; HAS HE MADE A WAY FOR THEM?
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; NOW, WE'RE GOING TO see what he did in
[1:06:13] times past. Noah's time. He cared. He
[1:06:16] sent the prophet and he he brought the
[1:06:18] way and he showed them the way and he
[1:06:21] made THEM A WAY OF ESCAPE AND THEY
[1:06:23] ESCAPED THE JUDGMENT. HE ALSO cared for
[1:06:27] them. Uh we find OUT THAT HE BRINGS THEM
[1:06:30] TO A PLACE WHERE HE IN THE LAST DAYS THE
[1:06:34] WORD OF ALL BEFORE THE GREAT JUDGMENT
[1:06:36] COME HE SO CARED FOR THEM UNTIL HE
[1:06:39] PREPARED a way THAT THEY COULD COME INTO
[1:06:41] and would be FREE FROM ALL THE JUDGMENTS
[1:06:44] THAT was coming.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; Now he did that to the the elected. Now
[1:06:49] we know that he did THAT TO THE ONLY TO
[1:06:52] THE ELECTED. NOW
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; they was the ONE WHO HAD ACCEPTED THIS
[1:06:56] JOURNEY OF LIFE.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE THE ONE WHO WERE PREDESTINATED
[1:07:00] TO SEE HIM. THEY WERE THE ONE WE ALL IF
[1:07:04] WE BELIEVE THE BIBLE, WE HAVE TO BELIEVE
[1:07:05] in predestination.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; That's right. Not God willing that any
[1:07:10] should suffer, but he know who would
[1:07:12] receive it and who wouldn't.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; HE ALSO CARED FOR HIS ELECTED PEOPLE in
[1:07:19] the days of the destruction of Egypt.
[1:07:23] They have down there in Egypt and become
[1:07:25] slaves. The days of Moses, he cared for
[1:07:29] THE PEOPLE. HE SENT THEM WHAT? A prophet
[1:07:32] again.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; AND HE SEPARATED HIS PEOPLE FROM THE
[1:07:38] UNBELIEVING WORLD FROM THE COMING
[1:07:40] JUDGMENT OF THAT DAY. Did he do it? HE
[1:07:43] CARRIED ON EGYPT AND HEAPED THEIR SIN SO
[1:07:46] HIGH UNTIL GOD HAD TO SEND JUDGMENT
[1:07:48] because he had already told Abraham and
[1:07:50] I WILL DEAL WITH THAT NATION.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; SO INSTEAD OF POURING OUT HIS WRATH UPON
[1:07:57] ALL OF THEM, he sent his care to them.
[1:08:01] HE SENT HIS COMFORTER TO THEM.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; HE SENT HIS WORD TO THEM.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; AND HE ALWAYS SENDS HIS WORD BY HIS
[1:08:08] PROPHET AS HE DID IN NOAH'S TIME. He did
[1:08:11] the same thing in the days of Noah
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; in the days of Eli of Moses. WE FIND OUT
[1:08:16] HE done the same thing. He sent THEM HIS
[1:08:19] PROPHET AND THEY SEPARATED themselves
[1:08:23] from unbelief.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Now that's the kind that come out.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; That's the kind that believed it.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; They believe Moses that he was a he to
[1:08:33] the EYES OF PHARAOH. HE WAS A FANATIC.
[1:08:36] HE WAS A MAGICIAN. HE WAS A HYPOCRITE.
[1:08:39] HE WAS SOMETHING HORRIBLE. BUT TO THE
[1:08:41] PEOPLE THAT WAS ELECTED TO COME OUT
[1:08:43] ACCORDING TO GOD'S WORD, I WILL BRING
[1:08:45] THEM OUT.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; He was a prophet
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; to them. IT WAS GOD'S PROVIDED WAY. AND
[1:08:54] HE ALSO, NOTICE, they uh believed HIM
[1:08:59] AND ESCAPED FROM THE JUDGMENT OF THAT
[1:09:01] DAY. They believed Moses AND HIS HE ALSO
[1:09:05] CARED FOR them to bring them out. And he
[1:09:08] cared FOR THEM IN THE JOURNEY AFTER THEY
[1:09:10] COME OUT.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS IN THE PHYSICAL. THIS IS IN THE
[1:09:19] SPIRITUAL REALM.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; HE CARED. WHY? HE PROVIDED EVERYTHING
[1:09:25] THEY HAD NEED of while they were in the
[1:09:27] journey.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; He healed THEM WHEN THEY WERE SICK.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; He provided healing.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE PROVIDED A WAY FOR THEIR
[1:09:38] SICKNESS. HE PROVIDED A A BRASH SERPENT.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; THAT THEY COULD LOOK UPON THAT BRASS
[1:09:45] SERPENT, A SYMBOL OF SIN,
[1:09:49] and be healed.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; HE FED THEM WHILE THEY WERE IN THE WAY.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; WHERE THERE WAS NO BREAD, HE RAINED
[1:09:56] BREAD OUT OF HEAVEN.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; HE FED THEM. NOT ONLY THAT, BUT HE
[1:10:00] CALLED THEM.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; SHOWING HE CARES FOR THOSE WHO CARE.
[1:10:05] AMEN.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; IF THEY'RE READY TO CONFESS AND REPENT
[1:10:10] AND BELIEVE AND ACCEPT, God cares.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU GOT TO CARE FIRST.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO ACCEPT WHAT HE SENT YOU.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; HE SO CARED FOR THEM THAT THEY'D BE SURE
[1:10:26] THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MISTAKE. HE HAVE
[1:10:28] VINDICATED HIS PROPHET BY A SIGH OF A
[1:10:31] PURE FIRE.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT LET THE PEOPLE SEE THAT IT
[1:10:34] WASN'T JUST THIS MAN WALKING ON HERE.
[1:10:36] THAT WAS GOD RIGHT ABOUT HIM.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; HE was the one THAT WAS LEADING THE WAY.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; GOD CARES FOR PEOPLE WHO CARES.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; GOD CARES FOR THOSE WHO CARE FOR HIM.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; SO HE HAVE VINDICATED this man AND
[1:10:55] PROVED THAT HE WAS UH GOD'S SERVANT BY
[1:10:58] SENDING THEM A PILLAR OF FIRE TO LEAD
[1:11:00] THEM TO THE very land. And they KNOW AS
[1:11:03] LONG AS THIS SIGN OF THIS FIRE, A PILLAR
[1:11:06] OF CLOUD AND FIRE WAS FOLLOWING THEM, HE
[1:11:08] SAID HE TOOK NOT AWAY the pillar of fire
[1:11:12] and cloud.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; HE WAS WITH THEM FOR YEARS and years in
[1:11:16] THE WILDERNESS. 40 YEARS. IS THAT RIGHT?
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; THE PILLAR OF FIRE WITH THEM.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; WE'RE IN OUR 33RD YEAR LEAVING SEVEN
[1:11:27] YEARS LONGER.
[1:11:30] They would tithe the same.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; All right. A PILLAR OF FIRE LED THEM. HE
[1:11:35] cared for them.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; AND HE CARED SO MUCH FOR THEM TO HE LET
[1:11:41] THEM KNOW THAT THAT IT WASN'T SOME
[1:11:43] SCIENTIFIC THING. IT WASN'T SOME SLIP
[1:11:45] UP, BUT HE HAD VINDICATED THE MESSAGE,
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; proven it. He so cared even for a woman
[1:11:52] THAT WAS AN OUTSIDER. NOT AN ISRAELITE.
[1:11:56] SHE DIDN'T BELONG to the group. BUT SHE
[1:11:58] WAS AN OUTSIDER, PRESBYTERIAN, Methodist
[1:12:01] or something. SHE IS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
[1:12:04] BUT WHEN SHE HEARD,
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; HER NAME WAS RAHAB.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; SHE'S LIVING, SHE'S A HARLOT. BUT WHEN
[1:12:10] SHE HEARD HOW GOD
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; WAS IN A PILLAR OF FIRE
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; AND WAS LEADING THEM,
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; LORD,
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; SHE SAID, "LET CALLED OUT TO GOD." AND
[1:12:21] SHE SHOWED MERCY TO THE SPIES THAT HAD
[1:12:23] COME TO LOOK OUT THE LAND. AND BECAUSE
[1:12:25] SHE CARED FOR HER AND HER PEOPLE, GOD
[1:12:28] CARED FOR her
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; in so MUCH TO THIS HARLOT
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; THAT WOULD GIVE HER LIFE TO CHRIST TO
[1:12:35] THE CAUSE BECAUSE SHE'D SEEN THE SIGN OF
[1:12:38] A SUPERNATURAL GOD. AND SHE SERVED HER
[1:12:40] GODS right in her own denomination.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN SHE SEEN THIS GREAT
[1:12:45] SUPERNATURAL SIGN, SHE CRIED OUT AND
[1:12:48] ASKED for mercy and for mercy FOR HER
[1:12:50] FAMILY. AND GOD SO CARED FOR HER THAT
[1:12:53] THE WHOLE CITY LAPPED DOWN, ONE ON TOP
[1:12:56] OF THE OTHER. BUT THERE WASN'T ONE ROCK
[1:12:58] MOVED ON HER HOUSE.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; He cared.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Though her be an outsider.
[1:13:06] She wasn't in the group at that time.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; But he cared. HE ALWAYS CARED.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; HE CARED FOR ELIJAH
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; WHEN HE AND HE CARED FOR GOD.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; BLESS THE LORD.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:13:20] THAT'S WHERE IT COMES TO.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; CAST YOUR CARES UPON HIM FOR HE CARTH
[1:13:25] FOR YOU.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; PETER SPEAKING TO THE ELECT ELDERS.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; THE ELDERS AND THEM IN THE CHURCH. HE
[1:13:30] SAID, "PUT YOUR CARES ON HIM BECAUSE HE
[1:13:32] CARES FOR YOU.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; PUT EVERYTHING THERE BECAUSE YOU'RE
[1:13:35] CLEAN BEFORE GOD. YOU'RE YOU'RE WALKING
[1:13:38] AS SERVANTS OF GOD."
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; GOD CARED FOR ELIJAH BECAUSE ELIJAH
[1:13:43] CARED FOR GOD. ALL THE OTHER PREACHERS
[1:13:45] HAD LOST THE VISION OF THAT DAY, HAD
[1:13:48] LOST THE WILL OF GOD AND THE LOVE OF HIS
[1:13:50] WORD, AND IT ALL WENT MODERN.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; BUT NO MATTER HOW MODERN JEZEBEL HAD
[1:13:56] HIM,
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; the first lady OF THE LAND,
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; NO MATTER HOW MUCH THEM OTHER PREACHERS,
[1:14:01] LET THEM WOMEN ACT AND DO, ELIJAH CALLED
[1:14:04] OUT AGAINST IT IN THE NAME OF THE LORD.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; HE CARED FOR WHAT GOD SAID.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; GOD CARED FOR WHAT ELIJAH SAID THEN.
[1:14:14] BECAUSE HE SAID the word of the Lord.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; God cares when you care.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; But you got to care first.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; NOTICE HE CARED WHEN HE CALLED ELIJAH BY
[1:14:26] HIS WORD OFF FROM AMONGST the
[1:14:28] denominations.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; LOOKED LIKE HE'D HAVE TO STARVE TO DEATH
[1:14:32] CAUSE THERE'D BE NO TITHE AND OFFERINGS
[1:14:34] COMING TO HIM. BUT HE SO CARED FOR
[1:14:36] ELIJAH. HE DIDN'T LET HIM STARVE DURING
[1:14:38] THE TIME HE WAS OBEYING THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. He commanded the ravens to
[1:14:44] feed him.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; HE CARED FOR ELIJAH BECAUSE ELIJAH CARED
[1:14:48] FOR HIM AND he is the word.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; HE CARED FOR DANIEL. WHEN DANIEL CARED
[1:14:53] FOR GOD'S WORD ENOUGH TO PRAY SINCERELY.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; NO MATTER WHAT THE KING SAID, I DON'T
[1:14:58] WANT NO MORE OF THAT DONE. ELIJAH JUST
[1:14:59] THREW OPEN THE SHUTTERS AND LOOKED
[1:15:01] TOWARDS JERUSALEM AND PRAYED.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; ELIJAH CARED FOR GOD AND GOD CARED FOR
[1:15:08] ELIJAH. DANIEL CARED FOR GOD'S WORD AND
[1:15:11] GOD CARED FOR ELIJAH. HE SET A PILLAR OF
[1:15:14] FIRE THAT SCARED THAT LION OFF OF HIM
[1:15:16] AND STAYED DOWN THERE ALL NIGHT LONG.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; God cared BECAUSE DANIEL CARED.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; SINCERELY PRAYED KNOWING THAT IT GO TO
[1:15:29] MEAN THROW IT INTO THE LION'S DEN. IF HE
[1:15:32] DISOBEYED THE DENOMINATIONAL ORDERS. But
[1:15:34] he knelt DOWN BY THE WINDOW, NOT FEARING
[1:15:37] WHAT MAN SAID.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; HE THREW OPEN THE WINDOWS BECAUSE IT WAS
[1:15:41] A COMMANDMENT OF GOD.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; AND HE PRAYED SINCERELY AND HONESTLY TO
[1:15:46] HIS GOD EVERY DAY.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; He cared FOR GOD AND HIS COMMANDMENT.
[1:15:50] AND GOD TURNED AROUND AND CARED FOR
[1:15:51] DANIEL AND HIS COMMAND his stand.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; DANIEL CARED FOR GOD AND HIS WORD. AND
[1:15:57] GOD CARED FOR DANIEL AND HIS STAND FOR
[1:15:59] THE WORD. He'll do it every time.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; He cared for the Hebrew children
[1:16:09] WHEN THEY RESPECTED SINCERELY AND CARED
[1:16:13] FOR THE FAITH THAT WAS ONCE DELIVERED to
[1:16:15] them.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; The word of God.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; HE SO CARED FOR THEM THAT WHEN THEY BLOW
[1:16:21] THE TRUMPET, THEY HAD A COMMANDMENT FROM
[1:16:22] GOD. DON'T BOW BEFORE ANY HEATHEN GOD,
[1:16:26] ANY STATUES. DON'T BOW. DON'T WORSHIP
[1:16:28] HIM. THAT WAS THE COMMANDMENT. AND WHEN
[1:16:31] THEY SOUNDED THE TRUMPET AND SAID,
[1:16:32] "WE'LL THROW INTO THE FURNACE THOSE WHO
[1:16:34] DON'T," THEY SO CARED TILL THEY TURNED
[1:16:36] THEIR BACK UPON THE STATUE.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; GOD SO CARED FOR THEM THAT WHEN THE HEAT
[1:16:43] COME ON, HE SENT THE FOURTH MAN DOWN
[1:16:45] THERE IN THE FIRE FURNACE
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; and kept them cool. HE CARED BECAUSE
[1:16:49] THEY CARED.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; If you want TO HOLD ON TO SOME CREED,
[1:16:53] GOD DON'T CARE WHAT YOU DO. IF YOU WANT
[1:16:55] TO DO THAT, HE'LL NEVER CARE FOR YOU
[1:16:56] BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING WHAT MAN SAID. BUT
[1:16:58] IF YOU HOLD A GOD'S WORD, YOUR TRUE
[1:17:00] SINCERE CONFESSION AND BELIEF, GOD IS A
[1:17:03] HEALER. THE SAME YESTERDAY, DAD FOREVER,
[1:17:05] HE'LL care for you.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; He cared that. He cared for the Hebrew
[1:17:09] children.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; And he sent them the fourth man to
[1:17:13] deliver him, which was Christ. We know
[1:17:14] that.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE LEPER CRIED, LORD, 10 LEPERS
[1:17:20] COME OUT AND CRIED SINCERELY, LORD, AND
[1:17:22] MERCY ON US. THEY HAD ENOUGH TO CARE FOR
[1:17:25] THEIR OWN WANTS. HE HAD A POWER TO CARE
[1:17:27] FOR THEM. HE CARED FOR THE LEOPARD
[1:17:30] BECAUSE THE LEPER CARED TO MAKE THEIR
[1:17:32] CONFESSION. CALL HIM LORD.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; HE CARED WHEN THE CENTURION CARED ENOUGH
[1:17:37] ABOUT HIMSELF TO SEND FOR HELP FROM
[1:17:40] JESUS.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; When the centurion pro SHOWED BY HIS
[1:17:46] FAITH DENOUNCED HIS IDOLS OF ROME AND
[1:17:50] CARED ENOUGH BUT PUBLIC WITNESS TO SEND
[1:17:52] FOR HIM TO COME HEAL HIS SON. JESUS
[1:17:54] CARED ENOUGH TO GO HEAL YOU.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; He cares when you care.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; You got to care first, don't
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; he? He cared. HE CARED WHEN JAS CARED
[1:18:05] ENOUGH ABOUT JESUS. HE WAS A SECRET
[1:18:08] BELIEVER. He believed HE WAS RIGHT. BUT
[1:18:11] BECAUSE OF HIS DENOMINATIONAL STAND, HE
[1:18:13] COULDN'T COME OUT AND CONFESS IT. BUT
[1:18:15] WHEN HIS LITTLE DAUGHTER GOT SICK AND
[1:18:17] DIED, JERAS KNOW THE DEATH OF HIS
[1:18:20] DAUGHTER OR TO EXPRESS HIS CARE. HE
[1:18:23] CARED ENOUGH TO DENOUNCE THE UNBELIEVERS
[1:18:25] THAT WAS AROUND HIM AND PUT ON HIS
[1:18:26] LITTLE MINISTERIAL HAT AND WENT AND
[1:18:28] FOUND JESUS. WHEN DRY SHOWED, HE CARED
[1:18:31] JESUS SHOWED. HE CARED ENOUGH TO COME
[1:18:32] AND RAISE HER UP from the dead.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Cast your cares on him or he cares. No
[1:18:38] matter what it is, he cared.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; HE CARED ENOUGH WHEN THERE WAS NOT EVEN
[1:18:42] A COMMANDMENT. SO, THERE WAS NOTHING
[1:18:45] SAID SO. HE HAD NEVER MADE MENTION OF
[1:18:47] IT. BUT HE CARED BECAUSE THE LITTLE
[1:18:49] WOMAN COULDN'T GET IN THE PRAYER LINE.
[1:18:52] AND SHE SAID, "IF I COULD TOUCH THE
[1:18:54] BORDER OF HIS GARMENT, I BELIEVE HIM."
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; HE CARED FOR HER FAITH IN THAT IN SO
[1:19:00] MUCH THAT HE TURNED AND CALLED HER OUT
[1:19:02] IN THE AUDIENCE AND TOLD HER HER FAITH
[1:19:04] HAD MADE HER WELL.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; He cared because the woman cared.
[1:19:10] He cared WHEN AN EROTIC CALLED LEGION
[1:19:13] CARED ENOUGH UNDER OPPOSITION TO WIGGLE
[1:19:16] OUT FROM UNDER THOSE TOMBSTONES OF
[1:19:17] DEVILS AND GO OUT TO MEET JESUS AND
[1:19:19] THROW HIMSELF PROSTRATE.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; When Legion them devils would never come
[1:19:25] if LEGION HAD TO PUSH HIS way out there
[1:19:27] TO MEET HIM. AND WHEN HE CARED ENOUGH TO
[1:19:30] MAKE THAT EFFORT, THAT STAND IN HIS
[1:19:32] BELIEF, JESUS CARED ENOUGH TO CAST OUT
[1:19:35] THIS LEGION OF DEVILS FROM HIM.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; And his neotic condition was gone.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; He cared when you care. Yes, sir.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; He cares when you care. NOW, WHEN THE
[1:19:48] BLIND MAN CRIED AT THE JERICHO GATE,
[1:19:52] "OH, JESUS BEING A JEW ORTHODOX, GOOD
[1:19:55] STANDING IN THEIR SYNAGOGUE." BUT WHEN
[1:19:57] HE SAID, "WHAT'S THAT NOISE GOES BY?"
[1:19:59] THEY SAID, "JESUS OF NAZARETH HAS A
[1:20:01] PROPHET." SAID, "JESUS, THOU SON OF
[1:20:04] DAVID." OH, WHAT A REBUKE THAT WAS TO
[1:20:07] HIS PASTOR AND PRIEST
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; THAT STOOD BY. BUT HE DIDN'T CARE WHAT
[1:20:11] PASTOR, PRIEST, OR NOTHING ELSE SAID. HE
[1:20:13] WAS INTERESTED AND HE CARED ENOUGH TO
[1:20:15] GET HIS SIGHT. SO, HE CALLED OUT.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN THAT BLIND MAN WAS READY AND
[1:20:19] CARED ENOUGH TO CALL OUT, JESUS CARED
[1:20:21] ENOUGH TO HEAL HIM.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:20:25] forever.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:27] He cares when you care. But you got to
[1:20:30] care first. You got to prove that you
[1:20:33] care.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; HE CARES SO MUCH THAT WHEN A WOMAN
[1:20:37] LIVING WITH SIX MEN,
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; IDENTIFIED
[1:20:43] AND KNOWED AND RECOGNIZED HIS MESSIAH
[1:20:46] SIGN OF DISCERNMENT.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE CARED ENOUGH
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; TILL HE FORGIVE EVERY SIN
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; AND GIVE HER WATERS THAT SHE DIDN'T COME
[1:20:55] THERE TO DRAW
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SHE RECOGNIZED
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; SHE SAID SIR
[1:21:02] I PERCEIVE THAT YOU ARE A PROPHET WHEN
[1:21:04] HE TOLD HER WHAT WAS WRONG WITH HER
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; AND THEY SHE'S LOOKING FOR THAT DAY TO
[1:21:08] COME ONLY SHE'D BEEN ALL CHURCH GROUPED
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; she didn't have A CHANCE TO DO IT BUT
[1:21:13] WHEN SHE SEEN A MAN WHO COULD TELL HER
[1:21:15] WHAT WAS WRONG WITH HER SHE SAID SIR I
[1:21:17] PERCEIVE THAT THOU ART A PROPHET.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; I KNOW WHEN THE MESSIAH COMETH, HE'LL DO
[1:21:22] THESE THINGS. HE SAID, "I'M HE." THAT'S
[1:21:24] ENOUGH.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; SHE CARED. SHE LEFT HER WATER POT AND
[1:21:27] INTO THE CITY SHE WENT.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; AND SHE SAID, "COME SEE A MAN WHO'S TOLD
[1:21:32] ME THE THINGS I'VE DONE." ISN'T THIS THE
[1:21:34] VERY MESSIAH?
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; She was something like Rahab. She cared
[1:21:39] until she alarmed the whole city.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; SHE CARED BECAUSE SOMETHING HAD BEEN
[1:21:45] DONE. WOULDN'T HAVE VINDICATED.
[1:21:47] SCRIPTURE HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO PASS AND
[1:21:49] MADE POSITIVE SURE. AND SHE CARED.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; SHE DIDN'T CARE WHAT THE MAN SAID OR
[1:21:53] SOMEBODY ELSE SAID. SHE SEEN IT.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; SHE was there when it happened.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; She cared.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; AND SHE CARED FOR HER PEOPLE CUZ SHE
[1:22:02] TOLD EVERY ONE OF THEM. AND IT CAUSED
[1:22:04] THE WHOLE CITY TO BELIEVE ON JESUS
[1:22:06] CHRIST.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; She cared
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; and he cared.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; Certainly it didn't. Jesus cared enough
[1:22:13] for the message of the day to bring
[1:22:15] these same things to pass as he said.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Till he died and rose again to send him
[1:22:20] by the Holy Spirit, the comforter to
[1:22:22] show his ministry today that he's still
[1:22:24] alive.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; He cared enough.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Won't we care? That's the thing. Won't
[1:22:30] we care? He died for this ministry. He
[1:22:33] died in order THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT COULD
[1:22:35] be here in this day to show these
[1:22:36] things. He cared for you. He cared to
[1:22:40] bring it here. HE CARED TO MAKE THE
[1:22:41] STATEMENT. HE CARED BECAUSE HE LOVED
[1:22:44] YOU.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; He cared enough to do it to send the
[1:22:47] Holy Spirit to this make THIS MINISTRY
[1:22:50] TODAY. THAT'S HOW HE PROVED HE CARED IN
[1:22:53] THAT DAY BECAUSE HE COME TO VINDICATE
[1:22:56] WHAT GOD SAID HE WOULD BE. THAT'S THE
[1:22:57] REASON THE WOMAN RECOGNIZED HIM.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; She said, "I know when Messiah cometh,
[1:23:01] he's a prophet.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; WHEN MESSIAH COMETH, HE'LL TELL us these
[1:23:04] things." SEE, HE CARED ENOUGH ABOUT THE
[1:23:07] WORD OF GOD TO VINDICATE IT TO HER.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; NOW, HE SENT THE HOLY GHOST THAT IN THIS
[1:23:14] DAY OF INTELLECTUAL CONCEPTION THAT HE
[1:23:16] MIGHT BY THE SAME HOLY SPIRIT PROVE
[1:23:19] THROUGH US THAT HE'S STILL THE MESSIAH.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Prove in the same way he's the same
[1:23:27] yesterday, TODAY, AND FOREVER.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; NOW, THE QUESTION IS, do you care?
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; What do you think about it?
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; It's here. It's been proven over and
[1:23:36] over. DO YOU CARE ENOUGH TO believe it?
[1:23:38] DO YOU CARE ENOUGH TO CONFESS YOUR SINS
[1:23:41] THAT YOU'RE WRONG?
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; CONFESS YOUR UNBELIEF
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; AND ACCEPT IT.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; DO YOU CARE ENOUGH TO ACCEPT IT? HE
[1:23:49] CARED ENOUGH TO DIE AND RISE AGAIN TO
[1:23:51] BRING IT TO YOU.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Do you care enough to accept it?
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S PROVEN ALL THROUGH FROM
[1:23:56] NOAH'S TIME ALL THE WAY BACK FROM
[1:23:58] GENESIS ALL THE WAY THROUGH. WE AIN'T
[1:24:00] GOT TIME TO GET TO IT ALL. BUT YOU SEE
[1:24:02] THAT HE CARES
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; AND HE DIED THAT YOU MIGHT CARE THAT YOU
[1:24:06] MIGHT HAVE A WAY. AND HE'S BROUGHT THAT
[1:24:08] WAY. HE SAID EXACTLY WHAT THAT WAY WOULD
[1:24:10] DONE WOULD DO. AND NOW HERE HE IS TODAY
[1:24:13] SHOWING IT'S A TRUTH.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; NOW IN THIS EVIL HOUR THAT WE'RE LIVING
[1:24:17] IN, DO YOU CARE ENOUGH ABOUT IT
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; TO WITH ALL YOUR HEART BELIEVE IT?
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; WHETHER YOU STRIKE A PRAYER LINE OR
[1:24:26] WHATEVER IT IS THAT ISN'T IT? DO YOU
[1:24:28] CARE?
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Cast your cares upon him.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; He cares for you. Amen.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; BE SINCERE ABOUT IT. YOU CARE ENOUGH TO
[1:24:39] BE SINCERE.
[1:24:40] FOR HE HAS PROVEN BY HIS AICATED WORD
[1:24:44] THAT HE CARES.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; HE PROMISED TO SEND IT. HE'S DONE IT. HE
[1:24:48] PROMISED IN THE WORD. HERE IT IS.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; He cares. NOW, WHAT ABOUT YOU? YOU
[1:24:53] ALREADY CARING THIS.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; He cared enough.
[1:24:57] He cared enough to conquer every enemy
[1:24:59] for you that all you have to do is to be
[1:25:02] sincere and believe it.
[1:25:04] He conquered death.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; DEATH AIN'T nothing for me to conquer.
[1:25:08] It's already conquered.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Sickness ain't for me to conquer.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; IT AIN'T FOR CHRIST TO CONQUER. IT'S
[1:25:13] ALREADY CONQUERED.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; I just have to care enough to believe
[1:25:17] it.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Are you afraid of what somebody else has
[1:25:21] told you?
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU AFRAID OF THE DOCTOR'S
[1:25:23] DIAGNOSIS?
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Are you afraid of what the church will
[1:25:26] say to you?
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Are you afraid to stand a told to THE
[1:25:30] DEVIL SAY, "I'LL CONFESS MY SINS. I'LL
[1:25:32] LAID ASIDE EVERYTHING. I BELIEVED EVERY
[1:25:34] WORD.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; I AM LORD
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; CREATED me a care.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; I You cared for me. I care for you.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; I think of that gracious old song. He
[1:25:44] carth for you
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; through sunshines or shadows.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; He cares for you.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads now. We just can't
[1:25:53] go any further.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; He
[1:25:59] carth for you.
[1:26:03] He
[1:26:05] careth for you
[1:26:09] through
[1:26:11] sunshine or shadows.
[1:26:16] He
[1:26:18] cares
[1:26:20] for you.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Let's sing it to him with our heads
[1:26:24] bowed on our heart. He
[1:26:27] carth for you. Let's look what all he's
[1:26:30] done.
[1:26:32] He
[1:26:34] car
[1:26:35] for you.
[1:26:39] Oh through
[1:26:42] sunshine
[1:26:43] or shadows,
[1:26:48] he
[1:26:50] carth for you. Can we raise our hands
[1:26:53] and surrender him tonight? He
[1:26:58] carth for you.
[1:27:02] Thank you Lord. He
[1:27:07] for you
[1:27:11] through
[1:27:13] sunshine or shadows
[1:27:18] he
[1:27:21] carth for you. Heavenly father Lord we
[1:27:26] want to thank you tonight for this word.
[1:27:28] We want to thank you, Lord, for caring
[1:27:30] enough for this generation to send a
[1:27:33] prophet and to send a message and to
[1:27:36] send a message that would unite us with
[1:27:38] you. Lord, we needed to be united. There
[1:27:41] was no way we could find you in this
[1:27:43] Leodysian age. Lord, we were caught in
[1:27:46] in a we were locked up, Lord, in this
[1:27:49] age. And Lord, you showed yourself so
[1:27:52] wonderfully, Father. Made yourself real,
[1:27:55] vindicated yourself, Lord. You just need
[1:27:58] a people who care. You need a people,
[1:28:00] Lord, who reach out and repent with
[1:28:02] sincerity. Lord, that's all you need to
[1:28:05] work with. And Lord, we've learned this
[1:28:06] through this service that you gave us.
[1:28:08] Lord, it's more than a service. It's a
[1:28:11] key. Father, help us, Lord God, in our
[1:28:14] time when we leave this place in our
[1:28:16] everyday life. Help us, Lord Jesus, to
[1:28:19] take this key and unlock the things that
[1:28:21] are locked up. Lord God, we've seen it
[1:28:24] throughout the Bible in the worst
[1:28:26] conditions, in the worst state, uh Lord,
[1:28:29] things demon-possessed people,
[1:28:30] neurotics,
[1:28:32] depressed people, Lord, and a whole
[1:28:35] nations that had rejected you. Lord, how
[1:28:38] wonderful to see your grace, that thread
[1:28:41] of grace coming through there, Lord,
[1:28:43] even in the days of Noah. Lord, we need
[1:28:46] you. We need you more than we've ever
[1:28:47] needed you. We wanted to say it again to
[1:28:49] you tonight. We need you more than we've
[1:28:52] ever needed you before. We depend on
[1:28:55] you, Father. You are only hope. You're
[1:28:58] there's nothing, Lord, hopeless with
[1:28:59] you. So, Lord, our hope is in you,
[1:29:02] Father. We're thankful for the service
[1:29:04] tonight to be able to share in the word
[1:29:06] of God, to be able to learn these
[1:29:07] things. May the Holy Ghost become more
[1:29:10] and more real to every individual. We
[1:29:12] pray. Lord, we'll sing of your goodness.
[1:29:15] We'll sing of what you've done for our
[1:29:17] lives. Lord, we're thankful tonight as
[1:29:19] we bring the service to a close. We
[1:29:22] pray, Father, that you've deposited
[1:29:24] something within us that we could use
[1:29:26] every day against the enemy. We thank
[1:29:28] you, Father, we lift our hands and
[1:29:30] surrender to you and believe, Father,
[1:29:32] that all things are possible to the God
[1:29:35] that we believe in. May you come into
[1:29:38] our lives and come into our situations,
[1:29:41] Lord Jesus. May we humbly, as Peter has
[1:29:44] taught us in the Bible, that Lord, we
[1:29:46] humble ourselves under the mighty hand
[1:29:48] of God. And that humility would make us
[1:29:51] cast all of our cares, our burdens, our
[1:29:55] sins, everything. May we cast it on you
[1:29:59] because you care so much for us. Thank
[1:30:01] you, Father. Bless us and protect the
[1:30:04] people as they go home tonight on the
[1:30:05] roads and in their homes. Lord, until we
[1:30:08] meet and gathered together again, we
[1:30:10] commit the service now to you in Jesus
[1:30:13] name. Amen. Amen. Have you enjoyed being
[1:30:17] in the house of God tonight? Praise be
[1:30:19] to God. It's been a joy to fellowship
[1:30:22] around the word of God. Amen. God bless
[1:30:25] you. those who have to be dismissed. I
[1:30:27] know the children have to get in school
[1:30:29] and such and we try to be respectful,
[1:30:31] but we wouldn't want to hurry. If
[1:30:33] someone wants to give their heart to the
[1:30:35] Lord or wants to special prayer, you
[1:30:38] come forward. We'll be glad to pray
[1:30:39] tonight. I've got confidence in my God.
[1:30:42] I don't have confidence in me or you,
[1:30:43] but I got confidence in my God. He can
[1:30:46] meet every need. Praise the Lord. You
[1:30:48] love the Lord tonight. God bless you
[1:30:50] each one. Just say happy birthday to
[1:30:52] Brother Frank or Francis I call him. uh
[1:30:55] next week is his birthday. So if we
[1:30:57] don't get a chance, God bless you and
[1:30:59] each one in the fellowship of the Lord.
[1:31:00] Amen. God bless you tonight as you're
[1:31:02] dismissed in Jesus name. Praise the
[1:31:04] Lord. Amen. Let's sing that. I will sing
[1:31:07] of the goodness. I will sing of the
[1:31:09] goodness of God. All my life you've been
[1:31:11] faithful. All my life you have been
[1:31:15] faithful.

[1:31:39] of God. All my life. All my life. How
[1:31:42] many can testify to?
[1:31:44] All my life you have been faithful.
[1:31:51] Yes. All my life you have been so so
[1:31:57] good
[1:32:00] with every breath that I am able.

[1:32:39] I will sing yes of the goodness
[1:32:43] of God.

[1:33:03] with every breath.

[1:33:14] of God.
[1:33:16] And I love your Lord. Don't you love his
[1:33:19] voice? Hallelujah. You have led me
[1:33:22] through the fire
[1:33:26] in darkest nights.

[1:34:33] So good.
[1:34:37] every
[1:34:43] sing
[1:34:48] hallelujah.
[1:34:50] He never promised that the cross would
[1:34:54] not get weary and
[1:34:58] not be hard to climb.
[1:35:04] He never offered
[1:35:08] victories without fighting. But he said
[1:35:11] help would always come in time.
[1:35:18] Just remember when you're standing
[1:35:21] in the valley of decision
[1:35:25] and the adversary says give
[1:35:31] just
[1:35:35] our Lord your Oh yes
[1:35:40] take you to the fire again. He never
[1:35:44] promised. Come on, sing it now.
[1:35:48] He never promised that the cross will
[1:35:51] not get heavy and he will not be hard to
[1:35:58] find.
[1:36:02] He never offer
[1:36:12] right on time.
[1:36:15] Just remember the way you're standing in
[1:36:19] the valley of decision.
[1:36:26] Give
[1:36:28] just
[1:36:32] our Lord will show up again.
[1:36:36] He will take you. Oh, hallelujah. He
[1:36:40] cares. Do you care? He never promised.
[1:36:43] No,
[1:36:44] he never promised that the cross would
[1:36:48] not Hallelujah
[1:36:51] and that he will not be hard to climb.
[1:36:57] No,
[1:36:59] he never offered
[1:37:02] victory without fighting. But he said
[1:37:05] the word would always come up.
[1:37:09] He's right on time.
[1:37:12] Just remember when you're standing in
[1:37:16] the valley of decision
[1:37:19] and the advers
[1:37:21] says just give in.
[1:37:25] Just hold on.
[1:37:29] Our Lord will show up.
[1:37:34] make us new
[1:37:36] again.
[1:37:39] Amen.
[1:37:41] Hallelujah.
[1:37:45] I'm not giving up. No, no, no. I'm not
[1:37:50] turning around.
[1:37:53] By the grace of God, I'm going to wear
[1:37:57] shining crown someday.
[1:38:01] And I'll keep holding on, holding on to
[1:38:05] the NASCA.
[1:38:08] I'm not giving up. No, I'll keep going.
[1:38:13] No, no, no, no. I'm not giving up. No,
[1:38:19] I'm not turning around.

[1:38:34] the nail hand.
[1:38:38] I'm not giving up. No, I'll keep going
[1:38:42] on.
[1:38:45] I've been walking through the valley
[1:38:50] through this veil of tears and at times
[1:38:54] I've even questioned even if my Lord was
[1:38:58] near and many times that old tempter
[1:39:04] says why not turn around cuz you can't
[1:39:08] get it any further because you're just a
[1:39:12] losing ground but I'm not giving up. No,
[1:39:16] no, no. I'm not turning around.
[1:39:21] By the grace of God, I'm going to wear a
[1:39:25] shining crown. Someday that I'll keep
[1:39:29] holding on, holding on to the nail head.
[1:39:36] I'm not giving up. No, I'm going on.
[1:39:44] Would you mind to tell me there's been
[1:39:47] something bothering me?
[1:39:50] Why is it that old devil, he just won't
[1:39:54] let God's children be? You see, he's
[1:39:58] purposed and determined
[1:40:01] to get right in the way. Try to turn us
[1:40:06] from the way of life and lead. But
[1:40:09] everybody's going to tell them tonight,
[1:40:11] I'm not giving up. No, no. Tell the
[1:40:14] devil tonight, I'm not turning around.
[1:40:17] No, no, no. By the grace of God, I'm
[1:40:21] going to wear shining crown someday. And
[1:40:25] I'll keep holding on, holding on to the
[1:40:30] nail head.
[1:40:32] I'm not giving up. So I'm going home.
[1:40:40] Amen.
[1:40:42] Glory be to God. Amen.
[1:40:47] Hallelujah. He's an on time God.
[1:40:52] Yes, he is.

[1:41:53] want to go. in the right sea
[1:41:56] by that mean Pharaoh
[1:42:00] and his army.
[1:42:03] They had water all around them. And they
