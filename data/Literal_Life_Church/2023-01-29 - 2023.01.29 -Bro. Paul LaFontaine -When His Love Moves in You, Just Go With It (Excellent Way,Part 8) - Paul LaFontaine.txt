========================================
praise be to God the story is not over the story's not finished amen especially for the people of God praise the Lord I'm broken this morning because if you knew the testimony of my daughter singing Under such anointing [Music] if you knew what she's been through alas four or five months you'll see why she sings that way [Music] completely healed thank you [Applause] I heard yesterday she's completely completely off of all of her medicines and those things can help but we give glory to God completely Hallelujah amen we're grateful to the Lord this morning I'm glad he's he's the one that makes it worth the trip to come to church and you've invited them you've worshiped and you've invited him and so that it's not churches as usual but that he's here and he's he's aware and he knows every every detail what's happening in your life he's aware of every detail so we trust him this morning for his grace praise the Lord amen well we I just um not to interrupt anything here but I just wanted to make a few announcements we thank you to the people who have given to the money that we're raising to the HVAC project I think we've raised some more funds keep giving to that we certainly appreciate it want to announce the Israel trip that brother Barry's making I think in November and I want to encourage some of the whoever can go there's a few slots left and we encourage you my wife and I took this trip and it is a wonderful trip of a lifetime and so I think the announcements up here and the secretary can get to that information I asked for the bird the other day if there's some places left that's filling up but they have some places sure like the same some of the particularly older retired couples in the church if you can go in certainly encourage you to go it would be a great trip amen I want to mention with the deacons that we ask you to keep the talking in the other places minimal before the service just a handshake and a greeting and keep the talking down and there's two places that you should be in here in the church church and preparing for the service so there's an adult Sunday school class that you can be a part of that's a great class so either of those two places where your children in Sunday school would be great rather than other places please download the family site that was sent to you so we can run all of our announcements for the church to do that if you can download that take the time and I can't be critical because I haven't even downloaded it myself so I need to do that and all the all of us need to do that so we can have those announcements there's a couple's Fellowship here the 25th of February brother Mike walls will begin to speak from Pastor from Washington D.C and a great friend and he's going to come in and speak for the couples Fellowship in Sunday morning uh if you haven't met sister Olivia from New York yet you have the opportunity today to meet her Gideon's girlfriend and she is here and so we want to welcome

amen last Sunday we had a wonderful time at brother Chris Moritz in Vancouver and I won't say much about it but we just had a lovely time there and a wonderful group of people and Saints there we appreciate it and then yesterday we were at a luncheon with the local pastors and ministers and I'll just say it was a sweet time of unity and fellowship we really enjoyed it and we're just still basking in that from yesterday it was a wonderful time with some of the pastors and ministers we need to see that Unity amongst us and the churches it's not a time to divide it's a time to come together can you say amen and we want to do that and encourage Fellowship we may not see completely eye to eye but we want to encourage fellowship and kind of keep down the devil's work constantly to divide us we want to keep that at Bay and work against that with Divine love amen praise the Lord God bless you this morning if you get your Bibles or read a portion of scripture with me we welcome all who are here all the visitors God bless you we pray that you'll meet somebody there in the back and give them your name if you're a visitor would sure like to shake your hand we have a woman coming here the last few weeks and I don't even know her name but we appreciate you coming so I just went over and grabbed your hand today because I don't usually get to get it but God bless you hopefully we can get to know you more we welcome you you've been enjoying the word together with us so God bless you and any of the rest of visitors have come God bless you we're going to read this morning from Matthew chapter 18. Matthew chapter 18. it's good to have brother Dan and sister Jane back from vacation the snowbirds that they are and uh the Sprint family in with us this morning God bless you praise the Lord Matthew chapter 18 also brother Jared was gone for a few weeks there so God bless you brother Jared and sister Betsy back with us Matthew chapter 18 God is good isn't he just feel uh you know I almost feel like that in the temple when the glory of the Lord came down that the minister couldn't stand to speak I actually just feel like just lifting my hands he's here this morning and so the Bible says that could the minister couldn't even speak because it was such a presence there the glory of the Lord that means everything to me but we know his glory can be in his word as well and so we just work off of his presence being here and ask him to speak to us this morning the things that are needful in our lives praise the lord we want to see more of his presence and His glory we need to get more and more used to that because that's what we're going to in glory can you say Amen we should feel comfortable in his presence never condemnation never conviction yes but not condemnation we should worship here as if we're already there amen that's so how free we should be worshiping the Lord Matthew 18 and verse 21 and then came Peter to him and said Lord how often should shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him uh till seven times and Jesus saith unto him I say it not unto thee until seven times but until Seventy Times Seven so you just put that math together get your calculator and uh total all that up and you see um a picture of the Divine love of God picture of the Forgiveness of God there's no restraints on it can you say Amen so in his in his response to Peter then he goes into this Parable that says therefore is the Kingdom of Heaven likened unto a certain King which would take in account of his servants and when he had begun to reckon one was brought unto him which owed him ten thousand talents now the scripture here has given a pretty large amount and I looked at it yesterday you translate that into our money today and it's about 34 billion dollars so it's almost almost an exaggeration and you're going to see why in just a minute because it's almost if the king knew in this sermon there really was in a way probably to pay that back it was so huge it reminds us of our debt to the Lord can you say man we owe him everything and so when he had begun to wreck and one was brought into him which owed him ten thousand talents for but for as much as he had not to pay his Lord commanded him to be sold and his wife and children and all that he had and payment to be made because cause that's what they did the Old Testament they they would sell the family they had to sell their children they had to sell their land if they got in debt the servant therefore fell down and worshiped him saying Lord have patience with me and I will pay and I will pay the all then the Lord of that servant was moved with compassion and loosed him and forgave him the debt so I want you to notice the action was to forgive all of the debt but first he was moved by something he was moved this King was moved by something and he was moved with compassion and his move being moved with compassion uh he was able to then take an action of losing this man and forgiving forgiving his debt and if you don't know the rest of the parable we'll finish it but the same servant went out and found one of his fellow servants which owed him a hundred Pence and he laid hands on him and took him by the throat saying pay me that thou oldest and his fellow servant fell down at his feet and besought him saying have patience with me and I will pay the all and he would not but went and cast them into prison till he should pay the debt so when his fellow servants saw that it was done they were very sorry and came and told their lord all that was done then his Lord after he had called him said unto him oh thou Wicked servant I forgave thee all that debt because thou desirest me should us not thou also have had compassion on the fellow servant even as I had pity on thee and his Lord was Wrath and delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all that was due unto him so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you if you from your hearts forgive not everyone his brother their trespass amen I'd like to title this this morning when his love Moves In You Just Go With It heavenly father bless your word and Lord we are grateful for your presence here this morning we're grateful for the healing for the deliverance and when you're around Lord Supernatural things take place we pray that you take this word now and bring it to the people's hearts the way that you want to as we commit it to you we're humbly your servant this morning and we commit our words to you in Jesus name amen why don't you shake somebody's hand before you're seated once again and God bless you as you take your seats as we see in the parable that something moved in the heart of this ruler and once again I say I want to speak on when his love when his Divine love begins to move in you Just Go With It Just go with it and something was moved in the heart of this ruler and he was moved with compassion and when he was moved a certain way he acted on that and he forgave so he acted upon what his heart was being moved to do it's important that we not only are moved but that we act upon the way that we are moved um it's important that if the Lord leads us and calls us and we feel that and particularly this morning I'm going to get into his his Divine love and I'm I'm reminded of the examples um in the brother branham's life is that when something happened to him that he said something come over him and when he was challenged by demon Spirits then something come over him he said he said I wish I could have that all the time but something was able to come over him that was different than his human love different than his thinking different than his mind because some of the situations with demanding power you would normally be afraid of it you would be thinking what do I do do I run what do I do so your mind is always trying to think what do I do in this situation then something greater greater begin to move his heart and all that thinking was washed away and he reacted according to the love of God which by the way the love of God is a stronger Force than any demon power and so when it moved on him he chose to act upon what was moved moving in his heart and thus he forgave he he had Power Authority in the name of Jesus Christ and all that became the power to break the power of the enemy so now when God moves on us when this love moves on us then we should move with that and act upon that and this is what this ruler did when he was moved with something he acted on it in this case he forgave when he was when he was moved with with this uh spirit of compassion then we realized that it would not it would be contrary to our thinking uh it wouldn't be normal for us to to react this way to forgive in other words the normal thinking would just be to respond that that we think it through and he's got all of this debt making maybe he can set up a payment plan our mind maybe or the worst case scenario scenario is to basically say no no no you've done this you're finished you're done we're putting you into prison this is a lot of debt that's what our normal because I'm not helping the guy by forgiving them and so you've got all this and so the Mind thinks to think when this ruler in the parable was moved with compassion he acted on the compassion but he didn't act upon what he had thought because he would if we would have thought he would have talked himself out of forgiving him I'm going to preach this morning and I'm going to give you the opportunity if you need to go go ahead and go but put your seat belt on because I'm going to get into some things about forgiveness that maybe you've never heard the mind if it was given time to reason with this it would possibly override this compassion that he felt the mind would override if you're thinking sensibly it would not be to forgive this debt but to teach this guy a lesson the mind will override this so now I've been pondering a little bit this Divine love that we've been preaching about and I've been thinking about it and deeply in in working in the people of God and particularly working in me this Divine Capstone love working in me and thinking about as we went over its characteristics and we went over its actions and all the points in First Corinthians 13 of the excellent way we've gone over those things now and hopefully I can spend time and put it together in a little booklet or something to get you all the quotes and the scriptures pretty soon but so so now we've learned that it was a when when God comes in and we act this way it's a different course than human love it's a different action than human love it's something greater it's a force it's a presence Divine love is not a teaching it's not mind over matter it's not a mind over matter exercise it's a presence it's a force it's his presence he's the source of divine love so when he shows up that is the best of his love can you say that is his love so it's more than a teaching it's not mind over matter and some exercise in our mind it moves deep and if it moves deep it comes out and it wants to express that Divine love and then when it's a person is moved by it and and when somebody acts upon that Divine love then something different happens every time than the expected outcome somebody say praise the Lord something Supernatural can happen something great can happen when love projects Sovereign Grace takes over the situation and there's no demon greater than that Divine love the problem is is when it moves upon us we've got to let it we got to go with it we gotta trust it we can't let this mind interrupt the moving of the spirit of God because our minds will it'll reason it'll analyze it and it'll actually abort you know some new births are aborted because of somebody's thinking the conviction of the holy spirit moves Upon a Child or a teenager or a person to move them to a new birth and there's many abortions because their mind steps in the way I'm not ready I'm not doing that I'm not ready to give up and the mind aborts the whole situation I say to you this morning when the Lord is moving on you when his love is calling you I say go with it right away go with it right then [Applause] praise the Lord so so now we can we can start at a very basic Point here this morning with the scripture John 3 16. which is quoted probably more than any other scripture in the world in Christian Realms but in the world everybody knows John 3 16. and so I I'm uh there's it's quoted more than any other and yet the question is how many people really understand John 3 16. so it says for God so loved the world that he gave so that's what I'm preaching this morning God himself was moved as he looked at humanity and looked at the humanity that has fallen and as soon as they had fallen God was moved by something God in himself in the core of himself was moved by love his own love that he had within him but he was moved by it God so loved the world he could have had a lot of responses to the condition of the world he has judgment he could have responded first with judgment but he wasn't moved by judgment first he wasn't moved by his law first he wasn't moved by the thought I told them not to do that and they did it anyway he was not moved by all the other characteristics that's in God the first thing that God was moved in his heart with for this world in its condition is he was moved with his love and I'm saying to you on the the video land and whoever's listening and you hear this morning you were including that because the entire world is included in it you ought to raise your hand and say thank God that the heart of God was moved in love for me it was moved for you because I would safely say if God's heart wasn't moved to love you you wouldn't even be here this morning you wouldn't have salvation this morning you wouldn't have a desire to serve God but God so loved the world that that now he has he's moved by this but his love was not just moved he took action God so loved that he gave his only begotten son that we could have salvation his love he activated he acted upon it John 3 16 is is something that we know but look at look at what it says here he's seen the condition of the world and man it was fallen and something moved within him something moved within God for you he was moved with compassion he was moved God's first reaction was not judgment what a bunch of losers man I created them and I did all these things what a bunch as first responses my goodness what in the world is you know what a bunch of sad losers that's not what we have coming out of God love moved him can you say Amen and in his thought that love moved him to think in his thoughts his love moved him to start thinking thoughts and you know one of the thoughts he's seen and thought in his mind a lamb slain yeah this is all in God's thoughts because if you know your Bible he said that there was there's ones written in the Lamb's Book of Life who was slain before the foundation of the world so in these great movement of God's love and something in him just churned and stirring in his heart with love then his thoughts began to come to what when what am I going to provide what am I going to provide for them so in his thoughts all this happened before you were even born before sin came into the picture God went through all this in his thoughts and he's seen a lamb slain before the foundation of the war before you sinned before you did anything wrong God thought it's true and his love moved to provide a lamb for your sin somebody ought to shout praise the Lord this morning [Applause] it's all happening in God's thoughts and he's moved by love a lamb slain this is what they would need to be saved oh they need a way out they need an answer all this was going on in the back part of God's mind before the foundation of the world it's scriptural he's seen you he's seen your Fallen condition he was moved with love he was thinking of you he thought through the whole scenario of a lamb being slain for you his love was moving him in these kind of thoughts oh God help me to get this across this morning if love starts to churn in your heart stay with it go with it and let thoughts come from that [Music] what can I do to forgive that person what can I do to love that person how can I point them to the way out everybody's going to criticize them everybody's going to judge them but Lord you have put Divine love Within Me [Applause] so my thoughts are directed how can I get out of this how can we get out of this because I tell you if you're churning and moving with the love of God you're going to find the way out it's not the end of the story I'm gonna have him come and sing it again at the end of the service because the song already preached us the sermon this morning his love was moving and these kind of thoughts but then those thoughts were materialized and they weren't just thoughts that became reality he acted out of his love God God was moved by love and he gave his only begotten son his love moved in him so much that he acted on it he went with it even before he could give his son though he was already moved in the Garden of Eden when man fell he was already moved with love and compassion and Reconciliation and looking for a way to find Fellowship again it wasn't Adam running back to God saying God forgive me I'm at the altar I have sinned no he did what a lot of us do we go hide with our sin we hide in our shame we hide in our gift so it wasn't Adam and Eve running after God let me tell you something when I was 12 years old I came to the Altar and I did this and I did that and I did no no no no no no no if you come it's because God's already calling you to come and he loves you enough to call your heart if you've got something laying there is I want more of God it's because he put that there [Applause] and so before the sun could come because it would be a matter of time before he could bring his but his only begotten son and send him to Calvary before that could happen man's already fun and God is rushing down man Adam wasn't looking for God God came looking for Adam because what his love was moving within him he wanted reconciliation comes over they're hiding behind the bushes somewhere and so God says Adam where are you and he says you know we're back here uh we're naked we're hiding ourselves who told you you were naked you know the scenario but God is running after uh I'll repeat it again our dear brother Ron Spencer who who said that a third of the Angels fell in heaven and God never moved on it but one son and daughter fall and God's rushing to make reconciliation what is man that thou art mindful of him it's better than the angels you have a position of the love of God being towards you that's better than the angels don't you feel love this morning go so mayor reach your back say God I lift my hands no one's loved me like you've loved me Lord we're living in a world that nobody loves anybody and the Love Has Gone cold and that's why people act the way they do because they're not love right from a child they're not love right but I can tell you I don't care what family you come from there's a God that's churning in his heart his heart is stirring because he loves you so much said what are you doing behind the bushes there come out here and and when he did he threw some skins flying some animals the blood was on the Skins he said he threw these over put these on you I'll take care of this and what is he doing his blood is finding a place for Fellowship even before he sent his only begotten son he's trying his love is trying to find a place of reconciliation I just need some fellowship again with you I'm not going to leave you out there by yourself come out of those bushes I say you this morning whoever is listening come out of those bushes come out of your shame come out of your guilt come out from other bushes and by the way get rid of your covering of religion because religion is a covering to hide your sin religion is recovery and they had they had sown fig leaves together to cover their private parts God said take those off it's only blood that's a crop recovery put these lambskins on you but you dare stay in the bushes with your religious covering come out here and I'll give you a covering I'll give you blood somebody say praise the Lord so even before he could give his son his calling I want you I want your fellowship I want you back it was love moving in him to say that you threw some skins to him from a killed lamb around their bodies and he found a place to begin reconciliation his love Found A Door of Hope found a place it wasn't his son yet but he found a place to start for reconciliation brother Graham said God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son God's love to the world and God is love and when God projected himself to the world to save the world there could be nothing else but Sovereign Grace to produce a savior when God loves something has to operate when God loves something has to operate I want to live in that operation I want to live in that flow because when God loves because where's it move now God's love doesn't move in in a Bible or in a cloud where is his love in his people and it begins to Churn it begins to move excuse me for using churn I don't even know what that means it's a lack of a better term but it just begins to move and stir you up I say when the love of God stirs you it's going to be better than what your mind can do and when it stirs you up you don't get anything else that's more where the love of God stirs you go with it watch what it'll do I love this he says it's love and he says when God's love comes something has to operate and God so loved the world that a divine Savior appeared his grace provided that savior it was because of his love that brought forth his savior the world is dying for love the church is dying for love Jesus said you're the salt of the earth but if the salt has lost its savior it is henceforth good for nothing but to be Trot unto the feet of men and the church has lost its divine revelation of the love of God I'm going to read it again the church has lost its divine revelation of divine love so this is a revelation and it's more than just a revelation of the Seven Seals it's more than just a revelation of the godhead it's more than just a revelation of the prophet of the hour it's it's a revelation of what divine love is and hopefully as a minister I'm just a small portion to preach to you so your Revelation can break open more of what the Divine love of God is we're going around it we're we're taking Pride we're we're glory in how much we know in the message we glory in how much we know we glory and how much we're better than everybody else Christians we're better than everybody else in the world we glory in all these other things and we don't need to be glorious any of that we need to be glory in what God glory is in change lives the love of God's power effect upon people said uh if the church has lost its divine revelation of love love if the church has lost its divine revelation of the love of God it becomes a mock a stalk a stumbling block to the world there's only one thing the church has to do if you want somebody to come to Christ you be salty salt makes a thirst you be salty and the world will get thirsty that's right for in a man he is in the one he in one sense a man is a miniature Creator that's what Adam was created to be he was a miter God he was a creator he was a controller of this Earth instead of the earth controlling him instead of the sin of the world and the debauchery of the world controlling him which is what most of humanity is controlled you know yeah they're controlled we're like robots today with the AI and all the other things that's taken place they're controlling human beings by movies by media they're on your phone they're everywhere well listen we're not a part of that we're not robots we're Sons and Daughters of God this Earth and this temptation and its sexual debauchery doesn't control me as a man I by the Holy Ghost control what Satan brings to me in a man is this miniature Creator if he's a child of God because the spirit of God is in him who controls him who operates him and I'd like to let you just in a few minutes I'll let you know the truth if I had just a little more voice tonight I'd like to preach on that tonight but I'd like to let you in on some things about Divine love Paul said where there's tongues they shall cease where there's prophecies it'll fail where there's all these signs the Antichrist can produce any sign that's in the Bible fridge that's why we don't follow signs that's why we we don't depend on probably just prophecies because they can be imitated the Antichrist can produce any sign that's in the Bible but he cannot love he can't have this love that's why in The Book of John first John as John exposes the Antichrist spirit and what it is to to know when you have the Antichrist spirit and in the midst of all exposing the Antichrist spirit his theme is love Brothers love one another I'll read one scripture a minute whatever God had churning in him whatever God had moving in him now needs to be moving us because let me tell you it is the only correct response to the Antichrist spirit don't you try to go against this Antichrist spirit with your mind don't try to get online and debate with them I'm gonna go to a quote battle I'm going to by Biblical quote battle I'm going to quote the message don't you try to go with your intellect that Antichrist spirit is too strong it's going to win over you we're not approaching this combat in this battle coming against it with intellect and with quotes there's only one thing John said Brothers just love one another love one another the response to the Antichrist spirit and by the way I'll just tell you it's working right Among Us right here it's not out there in some denominational system the Antichrist spirit is working right among us all the time if you had discernment you could tell trying to divide trying to bring disharmony trying to lift up our opinions oh it's all kinds of things but there's only one correct response to the Antichrist spirit and that's this Capstone Divine love and that's why they brought all crippled John to every service because he never missed Church you know he a little crippled John and brought him up did the whole service he's praised to the Lord and that they had said John you're a you're a sage you're a patriarch here stand up and say something to the people and every time he would just stand up and say brothers just love one another and then he would sit down and his the the the the story is is the disciples eventually said can't you say something else don't you have another sermon they said no this is this is all we need somebody say praise the Lord this is the response to the Antichrist that we've got the real core the real substance of divine love and he don't praise the Lord I'm having a I'm having more fun than a human being should be allowed to have it's the way Rush Limbaugh says it and I don't think he knew my Christ like I know him this morning I can shout and rejoice can you say man not because I'm anything perfect but because I know that this love is resonating down in my heart I just need to act upon it when it starts to move me praise the Lord so what moved in God now moved in Jesus Christ of course because Jesus Christ was the fullness of God all that God was and he was a being that to be worshiped he had no physical uh presence as such unless he come down into the theophany he met Melchizedek and so so there's different ways he would come down but then he come in the body of Jesus Christ and all that God was he poured into that so you're going to have Jesus being moved with this same love that God was moved by because it's him it's him and Jesus was moved the scriptures that say uh and I'm going to quickly quote him to you I wouldn't try to get him up back there because I'm gonna you'll be going too fast for you Rebecca if that's who's up there Matthew 9 36 but when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no Shepherd Matthew 14 14 and Jesus went forth and saw a great multitude and multitude and was moved with compassion toward them and he healed their are sick he was moved and he healed their sick Matthew 1 21 41 and Jesus moved with compassion put forth his hand and touched people excuse me put forth and saith unto the man I will be thou clean Mark 6 34 and Jesus when he came out saw much people and was moved with compassion toward them because they were as sheep not having a shepherd and he began to teach them many things notice the different reaction to being moved by The Compassion of God within him there was always an action he went with it I moved with compassion but he didn't just stand back and say I'm really moved today by these people having no Shepherd I'm really moved I feel in my spirit very moved no there was an action to it he healed the sick he grabbed the lame man's hand can you say man he taught them because that's God's love too these are sheep without a Shepherd so I'm going to teach them my love I was thinking last night why have I studied uh so hard the last why have I given my Saturdays and my Wednesdays to study for the last 35 years for the people of God sacrifice my family doing things and I and I'm I'm giving this and I'm not bragging but I'll try to say why did why would I do all this because I know it's the motive of the love of God for the people of God teach them the things of God exhort them encourage them rebuke them if necessary where's the motivation the love of God because I guarantee you I wouldn't be doing this you know I'd take up sailing or something it's you know it's it makes me brother Mark Johnson a friend of mine up here in Ann Arbor he works for Delta and one time they asked him to move out of the the baggage and throwing baggage on the planes and they ask him to move up to take a position behind the desk so he tried it out for about three months and he said no no no I'm going back to the baggage I said Well why'd you do that there's more money I think and all the other thing he says he says because bags don't talk back is take them you know throw them on the plane and there's no response but the people at the counter they deal with that I wouldn't be doing this job unless it was the love of God motivating me to do it and the Divine calling from the Lord you'd break down if you didn't have a calling what move God now was moving to Jesus and it caused an action he did this Same Love or let me ask it did he have the same love moving in the people in the book of Acts Church yes in Acts chapter 3 right away in Acts chapter 3 if you read your Bible there was a lame man Peter and John Peter James John I believe went into the City and they go to the temple in Jerusalem and so the Bible says that this lame man he was begging for money wanted money wanted money and so Peter stopped and the Bible says that he fixed His Eyes Upon This lame man normal if he didn't have any money which Peter didn't because he said that later he didn't have any money normally what the man wants is some money so he would stop and drop something in his little can and that would be over if that's normal thinking but because he didn't do anything he would be headed forward but now something begins to move Peter and he goes with what he's been moved by and he stops and he fixes his eyes on this man you don't do that unless you're being moved by something you just pass them on by you know drive by them but he was moved with something because he fixed his eyes on him and the guy thought okay he's going to give me something no he said Silver and Gold Have I None but whatever I have I give you in the name of the Lord and that wasn't it he grabbed his hand like Jesus did he grabbed his hand and said stand up and he was healed of being a lame man I'm saying to you Peter acted upon the love that was moving him let me give you another example that's different the same Peter who could raise up the lame man showing that it's not only just physical Miracles he's moved by something later on in um uh later on in Acts I forgot to write down scripture I think it's in Acts 10 or 11. he he uh he he has a whole different dimension of the love of God when he was up in the roof of the house and he was praying and fasting and a vision came to him that he was to sit down and eat food that was unclean he didn't do that so at the end of it something says to him eat that food he said never I you know I don't eat anything unclean Lord and he said don't call unclean what I have cleansed and he didn't understand it all but he's going to see the story someone was working on cornelius's house sent a man go get Peter to preach to the Gentiles but that was a problem because Peter with the Holy Ghost and it already grabbed the lame man have the love of God but now he's going to find another dimension alone because there's there's a couple things in Peter still Pride and Prejudice so Peter had before the movie came out Peter thinks he's going along fine everything's a good minded It's a powerful Church praise be to God Miracles are happening and God looks at us but wait a minute you're selective with your love a little bit oh that's right you still got to get into a deeper dimension of divine love because when push comes to shove you're going to stay amongst your own people and you're not going to give this message and this love to the Gentiles and nobody could recognize that Peter was the hero Peter was the man of Faith Peter's my get around Peter this is it but God looks at him and says he's got Prejudice in there and I'm gonna have to take that man to a deeper to deepen his ministry to deepen his walk with me to deepen his Effectiveness I've got to get rid of that prejudice somebody just raised their hand said oh lord it's speaking to me this morning I'm the only one with my hands up oh my only God sees what we have within us even some of us with the Holy Ghost but I like this song that says take me deeper don't you dare sing that unless you're ready this week for the Lord to do something in your life to challenge I was on this series of excellent way and I've been challenged in my Divine love like I've never been challenged before I will give the examples with my family with different ones and I've been challenged all right you're going to take the more excellent way are you going to take your brain on this Peter says Peter says Lord I've never I'm you know I wouldn't anything whatever I've cleansed don't you dare call it unclean the guy knocks on the door is Peter is there a guy named Peter here yes Cornelius wants you to come and now it all comes together in Peter's heart and he realizes and so now unless he was moved with the love of God he would have never stepped out that door and made the trip to the Gentiles but when he did he gets up to him and says tells him the whole story God is in this this is a God thing this is beyond me and the you know the biggest lesson in all this you the house of Cornelius I guess that's what they call them this house you know what the biggest lesson you know who got the biggest lesson I did because I'm proclaiming to you today that God is Not only a god of the Jews but he's a god of the Gentiles as well he had to learn that and he had to act upon what he was being moved by he had to go with it that's what I'm preaching to you today when it moves your heart you better go with it go with it right then in second Corinthians chapter 2 Paul was moved to tell the church to forgive a really bad brother in the church bad man because in First Corinthians the Corinthian Church this guy was having sexual relations with his um stepmother I believe it was and uh it was in the church he was coming to church he was having communities doing all this stuff and they weren't rebuking it they was like oh he's a brother and then everybody's kind of hiding it and he rebuked that church you don't hide that thing you call that thing out that's the love of God too and so but then when they called it out and and and and rebuked him and dealt with it because Paul said you got to deal with this there's sin in the camp and a A little leaven leavens the whole lump you wonder why preachers preachers have to correct things well it's the holy spirit because if you let sin go on in the camp it'll start affecting the rest of the young people and the rest of the church so he told them what to do and they did it and then he wrote him another letter in second Corinthians chapter two and he he's moved in his heart he senses in his spirit that this voice changed his ways and he's he's asked for forgiveness he's asked for repentance in the church now he's coming he's obviously a changed man something is happening in his life and he tells the church it's time to forgive him it's time to so that he doesn't get discouraged we Embrace him reinstate him in the church [Music] what's moving right the same love that moved in the heart of God for you is now moving in Paul and moving in the church it's time to reinstate this brother it's time to forgive him somebody say praise the Lord so by Paul's letter they were moved brought him brother you're reinstated to the church you have repented and will you restore you so he says so he doesn't get discouraged and the devil doesn't get advantage of this situation that's where he says we're not ignorant of Satan's devices I could read these two you read them on yourself that's your homework read this is all in the Bible we're not ignorant of Satan because what can happen if forgiveness doesn't come Satan wreaks havoc and creates I shouldn't say creates but makes more problems because there's no forgiveness there's no restoring Fellowship now the devil really takes that life if there's just judgment and no mercy if there's no love moving in the congregation then the devil actually makes it worse for that person is anybody hearing what I'm saying it's time to be a mature Church it's time to know that we're the ones that hold We're The Mercy Seat The Mercy Seat is in the heart of the Bride we're the ones that hold the Divine love if somebody can't find forgiveness they ought to be able to find it within the love of God and the body of Christ because they're not going to find this anywhere else their life will just end up in just in sham wasn't a mess out there you read the scripture Paul says to reinstate him first John chapter 2 I was referring to John first John chapter 2 and verse uh yep I'm sorry it's John chapter 2. first John chapter 2. if you if you would just go with me it's actually first John chapter 3 now verse 7 let us love one another for lovers of God and everyone that loveth born of God he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love in this was manifested the love of God towards because that God sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him herein is love not that we love God but that he loved us and sent his son where's this thing come from well he better love me first I wasn't the love of God for you they better respond first they better does it say that here go ahead I have one duty that's expressed the love of God to them and see what it does that we love God that he loved us and sent his son beloved if God so love us we ought to also love one another it's he's saying what I'm preaching this morning whatever was moving in the heart of God before the foundation of the world whatever was moving in Jesus and the compassion for the people whatever is in the book of act the book of Acts church is to be moving in us because he said if God so loved us we are also to let that love move within us and act upon it no matter seeing God at any time if we love one another God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in US hereby know we that we dwell in him and he and us because he hath given us his spirit and we have seen and do testified that the father sent the son to be the savior of the world whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the son of God God dwelleth in him and he and God and we have known and believed the love that God hath to us God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him that's pretty deep it's not just we say I I love God you know this this comment I love God you know my uh my uh my family they love God praise the Lord but do they love his word just a question praise the Lord they love God but if they're in Rebellion to the word Jesus said if you love me keep my Commandments that love has got to go deeper I'm going to live any way I want to live and I love God that's a deception Jesus help me hearing is our love made perfect that we may have boldness no that his God is love and he that dwelled verse 16. he that dwelleth in he that dwelleth in love so it's a dwelling it's a it's it's not just an intellectual thing I want to dwell in his love and if you're dwelling is love you're dwelling in God it's a place to live it's a dwelling could we move to the present day and give examples of this love moving on a prophet a man of God when he was faced with demonic power when he was faced with a killer Bowl when he was faced with bees swarming all around him when he was faced with a maniac at the platform who wanted to break every bone in his body and he was moved by something and then he acted on that and when he acted on it power stepped in in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ before today you before this audience you'll fall before my feet a demon possessed man and he says his love I talked about a couple Wednesdays ago he says something come over him he said I wish I could stay on me all the time I wish it could come in this congregation all the time he said if that would stay on us if we could motivate by that Miracles would happen and he said at the end of that service when that man did fall to his feet demon possessed man come to the platform and and I don't have time to tell the whole story I can get it to you but he he something come over him and he began to transmit past the demon power ready to take him he spit in his face hopped up in his throat spit right in his face any thinking says fight or flight any normal thinking says I'm going back after this guy he just hawked up and spit a bunch in my face any man in this place that hello Brothers thinking about it something moved and Beyond his thinking and he transmitted past into that man's heart and he says that man don't want to be that way he loves his children he might have a family at home he'd like to come home normal and have his babies play on his knee and just be a normal man but some Spirit has taken him that's not that man that's the spirit speaking the love of God moved him past the scare of the demon power our friends we've got to start acting upon that instead of this got it all figured out you know it there's only there's only one mind that has had a perfect thought as soon as that as soon as they thought of it it was perfect when you first thought it and that's not you that's not me that's God every thought he fought the first time was a perfect thought but that's not you your thoughts aren't perfect it's flawed it's tainted you can't trust it but I can tell you you can trust this love motivating within you can I say it again you can trust this to do the right thing you reached over there and that then the spirit of boldness come out and says today in the name of Jesus Christ you'll fall at my feet and something broke that Spirit he was delivered and fell right on top of his feet and the prophet said there was people getting out of wheelchairs there was healings taking place around the whole building when they just observe the love of God in action yeah praise God if you're sick this morning what I'm preaching is beyond Paul LaFontaine if you're sick raise your hand right now if you're sick on the video raise your hand right now you can be healed right now because he's here in the name of Jesus Christ may you receive your healing this isn't a show this isn't a television preacher put on this is reality of the love of God resident with his people and I'm not afraid of it you know what I'm afraid of I'm afraid of when my own mind talks me out of it you ought to be more afraid see you've come to trust your mind so much that at your default thing and that's why it aborts and interrupts the love of God that's starting to judge and the Forgiveness of God and your mind interrupts it all and it talks itself out of the love of God no no no no no no and you go through the whole list and off true I'm more afraid of my thoughts on it than what that love is turning Within Me I'm going to help me Lord to start trusting that more and more help me to go with it and release this let me release forgiveness I don't have a right to hold it from anybody whatever God was moved with the prophet now was moved Beyond himself Beyond his thinking the next stage of this is to talk about that whole mind thing in our thinking um many of you are here today because the love of God moved into your life and not just that it moved on you but many of you responded some of you haven't responded yet you know God loves you and you know and you're here and you know it's good to be in church on Sunday mornings but there's so much of this still and I'm going to call it stinking thinking that's what my dad called it stinking thinking and so you have not come where you need to come yet because it's being preached to you the love of God is present you know where it's wanting to take you but you leave this service all the time but interrupted by this you're too scared you won't let go so you're going to walk back into your car and back to your house with the same fears the same Hangouts the same scares because you're thinking talk to you out of responding to the Lord and becoming broken some people can't even cry and I'm not saying crying is everything but everybody worships their everybody's response different but some people haven't cried for years except for a cat dying or something like that but but crying because of the conviction of the Holy Spirit I'm cried I'm moved by the Lord and I'm going with it I don't care what happens tomorrow I don't care how embarrassed I am to be at the altar bawling my eyes out I don't care anymore I'm going with it that's what we got to do we've got to respond that way we've got to quit letting our mind talk us out of the moving of the love of God we've got to quit let our minds talking out of worshiping God freely we've got to quit quenching the spirit of God when it's trying to move Among Us it's it's but many of you are here today and responded one day in your life to the love of God I say praise the Lord you're where you're at because you you you didn't weren't just moved you responded you repented and that action moved you and you if something moved in your life and you acted on it and that's why I say when he does if you're listening to me on the broadcast today or anywhere wherever you're at in the world when the Lord moves on you Just go with it trust me go with it don't be afraid of it [Applause] go with it so why don't most people go with it the problem is right between their ears stinking thinking and in each of these examples I gave this morning if the love of God moved that it was acted upon usually very quickly before they had time to think see that's not going to work in our generation because we're supposed to think about everything don't you dare be gullible and don't you dare to swallow anything and I think God gives us a brain I understand that and I think God gives us a sound mind and a conscience and all of that and I don't think you just dump your brain out all I know is there's two minds there's your mind and there's the mind of Christ and this body of Christ is to be functioning by the mind of Christ which is in the soul and there's something tragic about when the mind of Christ is working in you and you know what you're being led to do and your thinking interrupts it and lifts itself above the thoughts of the Lord is anybody listening you thought it through and it interrupted the true leading of the Holy Spirit and his love so it's stinking thinking and why is it now because most of the time we have to think stuff through our thinking talks us out of it sometimes many people don't leave changed when they come to a service or when God moves upon them because you're thinking talks you out of a deeper surrender your fears your past hurts worldliness in your life rebellion in your life a lack of trust your formal religious your former religious training that's like a concrete thing in your brain your indoctrination of your former religious training even in Christian Realms sometimes can be blocking you from the moving of the spirit and the moving the love of God it aborts a new birth many times stinking thinking the mind gets in the way and I say what he moves with in the love of God is something totally different than your thinking it's the mind of Christ Living by the spirit is completely different than living by your flesh don't blend it together don't because I thought it that it must be true don't do that that the word correct seek truth the love of God rejoices in the truth wait till you have the truth wait till you have the facts and then sometimes with facts you still need the forgiveness and love of God he did it she did it and I have proof and it's the facts and I live on facts no we don't we live on the love and forgiveness of God the facts was condemning that woman so she'd be stoned by the Pharisees they had facts but there was something greater than the facts [Applause] I've got proof he did wrong I'm going to correct him I've got facts for it great that's wonderful seek the truth but there's something greater than just having the facts and acting on facts you know my Uncle Jim uh he's he's went on now and I pray for his soul I believe that he made restitution with God but when as kids when we go visit Uncle Jim my dad has um two brothers uh Jim and Jerry and they live up here in Joanne sometimes Joanne listens in God bless you Aunt Joanne Jim you know he had a drinking problem and he when we go camping with those guys Jim would change when he got drunk and uh I don't mean this disrespectful because everybody does this drinking and becoming drunk numbs your normal thinking it's real simple and it you're not thinking properly and you're not thinking in your regular reasoning mind so we would go camping when he'd get real drunk then we realized that that's when he get he began to talk about the Lord he began to talk about his need for the Lord he began to compliment my dad for how he was raising his children I should have done that John you have done a perfect job with your kids my that's great he never said this stuff before he was critical of us you know and never wanted to come to Christ never wanted to respond and that was all in his normal thinking reasoning process because he had been taught against the gospel wow but once you numb all that reasoning then something I and I don't know the psychology all I know he started to talk about the Lord and my dad enjoyed it and he tried to get in what he could but more than likely well it did happen every time he'd come back sober again he was against it I thought you said you were going to come to church no I ain't coming he's ever had family members like that and we still love them and I believe he came to the Lord I love him to death and that that's that's what we have to do but is there something about that we can laugh about Uncle Jim but there's something about our thinking that has so much concrete stuff in it that when something else comes along besides our own thinking it can interrupt our thinking can dismantle the love of God and what's being said even conviction hello conviction is a good thing someone's broken to tears and feels bad for their sin and feel there's a they're a sinner and the Holy Spirit is convicted them they're weeping don't you dare touch that go with it go with it because that's something you don't deal with emotions and affection that's something deeper than condemnation the reason people don't leave different is whatever is being said is quickly talked out of by their minds they they're talked out of it the word corrects all the filthy cussing television and movies that you're feeding on that cause you to kick it out of your life and you feel conviction but what stops it when you leave here is your thinking you're not going to leave it you're not going to let it go you like those television shows way too much that's true the word tells you what modesty truly is by the word of God and by the message and his brother Michael brought out so simply if God would have wanted you to have longer nails or black nails or purple nails he would have made you that way I'd like that brother Michael I say Amen why are we trying to make something different than the way God made us God Gave You eyebrows but you want to extend them out or whatever they do with them well God didn't extend your eyelashes God didn't emphasize your eyelashes what'd you do you're feeding on too much on the internet and you're looking at Angelina Jolie and all the movie stars and Keeping Up with the Kardashians don't tell me people aren't feeding on them you can see it in your life you want to cake the makeup on you want to get the tight dresses you want to dress I have to wear a dress but I'm going to wear a tight one because I want to kind of look I don't want to look like an Amish out there and so it's a thinking process that you bought into the world okay and you make it and we make you make it like well I'm a legalist we're a legalist I'm not the one that legalized sin you turn it around the preacher's the problem and no no wait a minute wait a minute if the holy spirit moves with the love of God upon you and presents it something what interrupts it you're thinking I'm not doing that I'm not laying it down you can't find any place in the Bible where God says it's okay for a woman to wear britches you can't find it you actually find otherwise but if I preach that and I do it's not accepted by this entire world because the thinking has been developed against the thoughts of God and what he says modesty is not my problem it's a problem in the thinking of the people praise God for some Souls around this world that's saying I'm no longer interested in bearing the wisdom of this world in my mind and thinking the world's thoughts what does God's word say about it there's a few people left like that in this world and they actually researched it and they're hungry for it very few people the word says get your children away from worldly Associates that you're not going to do it because your thinking is placed Above All That if that's what the word says get them around good Fellowship get them around good wholesome things I just I'm just going to take a drink of water because it's real quiet right now it's a good time to do it trade you stinking thinking word speaks about forgiveness and to let it go and the Holy Spirit conviction plus the word leads us that way moves by the love of God and your mind is given power you gave it power to have a better way to deal with it and it stops just simple forgiveness of God stops the process what did it you're thinking the word says for young people not to sexually touch one another don't have sex before marriage don't even kiss before marriage because that's potentially committing adultery that's what the word says and you leave here with your thinking that says that does that's not really relevant anymore that doesn't fit it's not reality a little social drink is okay and your thinking decides what to do above the word of God I can't help but ask myself the question through all this since I've been preaching on all of us and preaching on you can't help but ask myself how much of my Christian Journey the serving the lord for these 40 45 years now that's why I gave my heart to the Lord and was baptized real young receive the Holy Ghost when I was 16. but I can't I can't help but ask an honest question to myself is how much of my whole Christian Journey has functioned by my own thinking and not walking in the spirit I don't even know if I want to see that it'd be too embarrassing for me that I thought it was the thoughts of God and I acted on my own thinking all I can tell you is at 57 coming up in April 57 years old I'm tired of doing that and I'm asking the Lord where do you God get me Lord that I could truly walk in the spirit every day function by the mind of Christ Watchman need the Chinese missionary said over there in China watching the success of the American church he said I'm amazed at what the American Christian Church can accomplish without the leadership of the Holy Ghost build big churches and do great things in schools and and he was direct he said I'm amazed what I can do without the spirit he said it it's time that the church functions by the love of God thank you I'm saying if it moves you go with it why don't we we don't trust we we trust our minds more than is leading can you say Amen but when you trust his love and his mind you're not trusting man you're not trusting me can you say man you're not being stupid by following the mind of Christ and the love of God we're really getting bad if we're using our own thoughts and we feel more safe we default to our own thoughts and default back to our habits because we feel safer there really we feel safer with our own thoughts leading us that's not safe that's you've resorted to that I'm going to protect myself I'm gonna I'm gonna I've got to do it my way too many people have hurt me I say if the love of God moves you go with it let him lead you where it wants to go because you're going to be Unbound by where you're at now Galatians chapter 5 verse 17. I know 12 40. I know the time Galatians chapter 5. now I can finish this next Sunday or I can finish it now so um for four four people's enough for me I'm I'm going I'm going with it I'm going with it hey come on you guys drove three three and a half hours three hours from Dayton praise the Lord hour and a half from Lima you know they've got the whole day right brother Joe praise the Lord I appreciate all you coming we had some good Fellowship Friday night with some of the Saints in Lima and and uh whenever I drive that long thing I would say to my wife God bless these people for driving that whole way I don't know if I could do it but they're doing it and praise the Lord faithful to the house of God God bless you I think there's an extra special blessing with it with the sacrifice amen I know you come to see the Lord it certainly isn't me you come to see the Lord what did I say Galatians chapter 5. Galatians chapter 5. can I speak a couple more scriptures all right Galatians chapter 5 and verse 17 says for the flesh no verse 16. this I say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh that's how powerful it is for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the Flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that you cannot do the things that you would in other words the love of God the spirit of God is trying to lead you to do the things that he wants to lead you to do but it's always contrary to what our mind says and what our flesh says it'll never be in harmony it'll never be agreeing and because of that we can't trust we must live by the spirit can you say man how many wants to live by the spirit but if you be led of the spirit ye are not under the law and then he gives those into the works of the flesh but I just want to say they're contrary your mind and God's mind is contrary to one another always the leading of the spirit and leading your flesh is contrary to one another it never agrees second Corinthians chapter 10 and I'm going to ask Solomon if you would so I'm going to go back there and get that ladder tall ladder and bring it out here second Corinthians chapter 10 don't look at Solomon look at the scripture I'm going to give an illustration before we are finished today second Corinthians chapter 10 yes look at this now second Corinthians chapter 10 verse 1. I Paul myself beseech you the me by the meekness and gentleness of Christ who in presents and base among you but being absent and bold towards you but I beseech you that I may not be bold um uh but I visit you that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence wherewith I think to be bold against some which think of us as we walk it's going to the flesh verse 3 for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal don't look at them look at me look in your Bible look at the scripture for the weapons of our wherefore are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds how many believe that our weapons are Mighty to the pulling down of strongholds well what's the strongholds in our life what's the strong line I don't have any strong loads oh yes you do and there's a power that pulls them down casting down all imaginations it's in our thinking the strongholds are in our thinking process casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ our thoughts can lift itself and I want to word it the way Paul says it here he says every thought that exalted itself above the knowledge of God your thoughts and Satan's thoughts lift himself above the knowledge of God so I'm here preaching God's thoughts I'm preaching the knowledge of God all right and then we got uh we got Solomon which would be Satan's thoughts sorry about that bud and we got Jonathan that would be my thoughts because you got Satan thoughts and you got my thoughts and uh you look pretty good by the way my thoughts look pretty good today Satan's dressed up this morning too his thoughts so so this is my thoughts this is Satan's thoughts and they they intertwine quite often if we let them right and and they actually become buddies sometimes Satan's thoughts and my thoughts get Blended together and become buddies but the real tragedy is in our lives when the knowledge of God is coming here then they lift themselves and exalt themselves above the knowledge of God so you guys go ahead and do that buddies Buddies now this is really juvenile to you but I want the children to catch this is what the scripture says that our thoughts just don't say that they have a power to exalt themselves above the knowledge of God left themselves their imaginations in our imagination realm is we thought it so it must be truth we've imagined all of it no facts or truth of God but they the thoughts our bodies many times and they lift themselves it's teeter-tottering so it's dangerous up there it's scary up there and but but this is my thoughts and the devil's thoughts and this is what they do all the time if they can lift themselves as a prominence in my life over the knowledge of God and that's her I'm standing here preaching and my thoughts and Satan thoughts are listed themselves now you can laugh at Solomon and Jonathan all you want to you can laugh at this illustration all you want to but let's be real this morning say how much does this happen when you leave every service how much does this happen that you go back to your thoughts lifting itself above the knowledge of God your past hurts your past pains all that gets filtered through it and it's all between your ears so the moving of the spirit happens the love of God moves everything moves but there's something dominant that's happening above the knowledge of God I don't want to live that way I want to live where the knowledge of God is the prominent thoughts in my life they dominate my thoughts did not the Bible say let this mind be in you which is also in Christ Jesus did not the bible say that you be transformed by the renewing of your mind did not our prophets say now that you've been born now that you've been saved now that you have the Holy Ghost now he said let the mind of Christ change your thoughts and renew your mind that you're thinking like God is thinking can I get an amen so you cast down imagination you say boys get down from there right now quickly get down from there I'm not going to let this happen any more in my life and matter of fact you guys come down here because I've got the power in the name of Jesus over my thoughts can you say it stay right here you you take the ladder because I'm going to remove the latter in my life you take it back there because you're the latter guy let's give a hand to the latter guy he's a good one and now come here come here now I can be here I could live here and probably be a little confused all the time and always in a battle all the time but I could go further and say I'm going to tell you guys where to be in my life because I can't get rid of all my thoughts and I can't stop the devil from putting thoughts in my hair or my head because that's you you can you're going to have that but I can stop having them have a dominance I can cast down imagination and I can live a life where I say in the name of Jesus you my thoughts Satan's thoughts you are down here I said you are in the name of Jesus you're down there see how stubborn it is trying to stay there and I told him in the name of Jesus to get down I can't get a right of Satan's thoughts coming I can't get around my mouth but I can live that the knowledge of God is always going to Trump and they're going to be under subjection to me and the thoughts of God and I'm going to be moved by the love of God I'm going to be moved by the spirit of God can you say Amen that's how I want to live let's give a hand for my thoughts don't give a hand to Satan's thoughts [Applause] God bless you I hope you got something out of this this morning stinking thinking maybe on Wednesday night or next Sunday we'll pick it up because I didn't realize that psychology has they took the term stinking thinking and there's actually some characteristics of people who have stinking thinking and when I read all of them I realized yeah this is way we think sometimes and it actually interrupts any moving of the spirit it interrupts the love of God and my message to you this morning is just simply if you're a born-again Believer you have the potential for the love of God to move you with compassion and in that love is the power of God to change and make the impossible possible so I'm saying when it moves on you in a moment Just Go With It see what it'll do and live life that your thoughts and Satan's thoughts are under the control of the Holy Spirit I've heard it said by people you can't control a lot of things in life but you can control your thinking can you say man there's certain things you can control by the Holy Ghost you can direct your thoughts you can start the morning right and read the word first instead of magazines and instead of filling in for the politics of the world I catch myself and you know what's going on in the world no no wait a minute let me open up find out what's going on in God's world it's Direct in your mind the way God's made us you say why do yeah I can't give up those things I there's a party who just keeps attaching why don't you just think about it no don't think about it just just realize that you can keep feeding on those things and stay where you are see somebody has taught us in our thinking that we become a religious zealot or a bible thumper or a legalist because we choose in a day to feed more on the word than on the things of this the wisdom of this world or the films of this world or the someone has taught us that and so I would venture to say I safe to say that a lot of our young people and adults as well we we have all those little things that spend most of our time and there's a very small slot that they're receiving the knowledge of God what if your vessel switched that around my wife and I were reading something an article about this fellow wrote a book about tithes and he says we always have on our mind ten percent and so we make it like a rule and that is what God gave us ten percent of our increase should go to God it belongs to him doesn't belong to us but he says if we think about it it's about the giving part so they had decided I'm increasing the amount it's not 10 for me he raises to something else but I'm not telling you do that I'm saying that we think about it as soon as you just get by with just the minimum and you make it a law but it's not a law it's about giving that one Christian writer writes book he started he switched around God blessed him and see Switzerland he paid 90 tithes and him and his wife lived on 10 percent most of us don't have that kind of income but he felt to do that so I'm just saying it's it's it's not letting our Common Sense thinking interrupt what the spirit is leading us to do it's about the heart in God it's about connecting with God not the mechanical thing I need to do this it's a checklist do this do this do this the message says do this so you got the Bible now you made the message a checklist and his brother rap was saying a few weeks ago in the New Birth message is that we often even take the new birth and it's a checklist check check check check now I have the new birth and God God never gave checklist he just said be led by my spirit and I'll take you into all truth I will lead you and guide you into all truth forgive repent when you need to forgive people when that you're being moved by the love of God let it be released to them no matter what they've done don't hold back what you're being moved on by the holy spirit because it's different than your mind don't let your mind talk you out of living a greater spiritual life don't let your thinking talk you out of where the holy spirit is taking this church and taking the church around the world your thinking can interrupt it don't let it abort don't let it talk you out of the next blessing in your life because it will your past hurts your fears I've been down that path before and it's hurt me you may not be able to trust a lot of things maybe even preachers I don't know I don't know but the spirit and the love of God if we can't trust that moving us we can't trust anything I say when it's moving and it'll usually be moving you to do something different than your mind's telling to do I see when it does Just Go With It Just go with it and see what happens you might come around and say well I really like this living by the spirit that's really good this is better his holy spirit can do further things than what we'd ever dreamed Come and sing again Raya Tina Gideon Come and sing it again to us what's the first words again Gideon what's the first words of the course lift your head mourning is coming what beautiful words you could stand I've kept you a long time maybe we'll pray first before they sing lay your hands on brothers and brothers sisters and sisters husbands and wives families feel the conviction of the precious Lord here this morning to not let that pass you by don't let your mind interrupt it I've been extremely convicted during this series myself and I pray that I could live a closer life to the Lord that's what my desire is that the only response response you're gonna going to get out of this boy is divine love that's where I want to live the only response you're ever going to hear or see is divine love that's what I want and I want to go in a Rapture too how many wants to go into rapture amen let this Faith Faith Works by love so if the love was being manifest not human love but this do I love then it creates faith rapturing faith in the word in this love might be the key to get out of here father thank you Lord for the mercy that you've extended to us from God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son for God so loved in compassion he grabbed the lame man and picked him up it says Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give I unto you in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk oh Lord Jesus may we see our position fully the way that we should see and I pray may your thoughts become our thoughts may we cast down imagination and every High thing that exalted itself above the knowledge of God may we live lead truly LED by the spirit of almighty God that's our desire forgive us Lord as we forgive others and that the ruler in the prayerable Lord may we learn from the parable that he was moved with compassion he acted upon it and Lord then that story ends very sad because the same fellow that received 35 billion dollars in our money released of the dead he didn't owe it he was forgiven of it turns around and requires the debt from another person forgive us Lord [Music] that's why you could answer to Peter not seven times but 70 times 7. oh God help us I pray with your love in Jesus name
