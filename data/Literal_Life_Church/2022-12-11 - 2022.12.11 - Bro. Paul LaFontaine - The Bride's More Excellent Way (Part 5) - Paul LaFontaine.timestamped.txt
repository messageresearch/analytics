[0:00] scripture with you this morning if you
[0:01] would turn in your Bibles to Proverbs
[0:03] Chapter 19 and verse 11 we'll read the
[0:06] scripture and study the word together
[0:08] and we pray that this will be a blessing
[0:10] to you this morning we thank God for his
[0:12] grace we thank God for all of our
[0:14] musicians helping us today
[0:16] and all the different components and
[0:19] Gifts within the church working to make
[0:21] a service possible and just to create
[0:24] the right atmosphere through the songs
[0:25] and through your worship that the Lord
[0:27] can be welcome and it's not just that
[0:29] he's invited but he's welcome there's a
[0:31] difference in in just inviting the lord
[0:33] it's if he feels welcome your worship
[0:36] makes him feel welcome when you open up
[0:38] your hearts and sing and praise and
[0:40] express your heart to him Lord prepare
[0:42] my heart and someone sings a special We
[0:45] join in with them we're never just
[0:47] Spectators but we have a responsibility
[0:50] and a love for the Lord that we want to
[0:53] make sure that his presence is welcome
[0:55] among us and that he can do his good
[0:57] work in each of Our Lives
[1:00] Proverbs Chapter 19 and verse 11. I'm
[1:02] just reading this one scripture and
[1:05] we're going to preach off of this this
[1:06] morning in our series the bride's more
[1:08] excellent way and this says Proverbs 19
[1:11] and verse 11 says the discretion of a
[1:15] man defareth his anger and it is his
[1:19] glory to pass over a transgression
[1:23] the discretion of a man defereth his
[1:25] anger and it is his glory to pass over a
[1:29] transgression and I might reword that
[1:31] there are many different translations
[1:33] but I'll just reword it so we might
[1:35] understand it a bit better and that is
[1:37] the discernment of a man the the caution
[1:40] of a man would defer make him not react
[1:43] so quickly and anger would defer his
[1:46] anger and it is his glory to cover a
[1:49] multitude of sins there's a glory in
[1:52] that there's a christ-likeness in that
[1:55] and that is when you not only forgive
[1:57] but you pass over
[1:59] transgressions can you say Amen
[2:02] Lord bless your word today anoint it we
[2:05] pray that you'll bless the whole day
[2:07] Lord of fellowship and as we come
[2:09] together Lord for the Christmas play
[2:11] tonight that you would bless everyone
[2:13] who comes bless the children help them
[2:15] to remember their parts help them Father
[2:17] to be anointed in their presentation of
[2:20] Christ and Lord if there's any hearts
[2:22] here they're hungry for more of you I
[2:24] pray father as they come that you would
[2:26] just put them in your presence that they
[2:28] could hear from you today and that you
[2:30] can fulfill that hunger that's in their
[2:32] hearts we look to you father the author
[2:34] and finisher of our faith the originator
[2:36] the Perfecter of our faith and we look
[2:39] to your word that you've blessed us with
[2:40] to be able to bless us we just commit
[2:43] our hearts to you for the day and we ask
[2:45] it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:47] amen and amen God bless you you're
[2:49] seated today
[2:52] this verse in Proverbs 19 and verse 11
[2:55] has just been
[2:57] intriguing to me the last few days as
[3:00] we've been studying over and this verse
[3:03] actually in one verse covers both of my
[3:07] new points as we cover them today and
[3:10] the bride's more excellent way just so
[3:12] you know if you haven't been a part of
[3:14] the series that we're out of First
[3:16] Corinthians 12 the last scripture in
[3:17] verse Corinthians 12 says covet
[3:20] earnestly the best gifts but yet I show
[3:22] unto you a more excellent way and then
[3:24] Paul goes into all the attributes of
[3:27] love divine Love In First Corinthians 13
[3:30] and so we've been taking those things
[3:32] little by little and we're going to take
[3:34] two more of those things today what the
[3:37] excellent way is and what divine love is
[3:39] and how that translates into Holy Ghost
[3:41] love being expressed in this hour from
[3:45] our vessels not just a shallow love but
[3:48] holy ghost Divine love expressed through
[3:50] us and we know that it's been taught us
[3:52] us that when when uh saw when Divine
[3:55] love projects then Sovereign Grace takes
[3:58] over so it's not just that we say I love
[4:02] God it's not just everybody matter of
[4:04] fact this Christmas season there'll be a
[4:06] lot of people say they know Christ and
[4:08] they love God but it's not just that we
[4:11] love God but that we have the love of
[4:13] God by the Holy Ghost and that we
[4:15] project that love in everyday situations
[4:18] and then he said if then it's been said
[4:21] that you when you project love when
[4:24] Divine love is projected not just I got
[4:27] it but when it's projected and
[4:29] manifested then Sovereign Grace can take
[4:31] over situations that we cannot handle
[4:34] that we cannot do something steps in how
[4:38] many would love it if the Lord would
[4:39] step into situations
[4:41] so when love is projected there's so
[4:44] there's a power that works in love love
[4:46] is the most powerful force in the world
[4:48] I shouldn't say love is because there's
[4:50] a lot of different versions of love that
[4:52] the world has given but Divine love Holy
[4:54] Ghost love is the most powerful force in
[4:58] the world can you say Amen there is
[5:00] nothing greater there is no demon there
[5:02] is no political power there is no
[5:04] government there is nothing more
[5:06] powerful than Divine love there's no
[5:09] church there's no system there's no
[5:11] religion that can be as powerful as
[5:13] Divine love and so this is what we want
[5:16] it to project we want it to project on
[5:18] our lives and so I'm going to cover two
[5:21] two more points of divine love and that
[5:23] is love is not easily provoked to anger
[5:26] number one love is not easily provoked
[5:29] to anger and love does not keep a record
[5:32] of others wrongs so that's the two we'll
[5:34] be looking into today love is not easily
[5:37] provoked uh to anger and love does not
[5:39] keep a record of others wrongs so
[5:42] there's just something intriguing about
[5:44] this particular verse and it's amazing
[5:46] that this one verse can say so much even
[5:51] about the points that I'm on today uh
[5:53] for uh and and to look at a man that
[5:57] could come to a place and and in God
[5:59] that it says here there's such wisdom
[6:02] behind it because it says the discretion
[6:03] of a man this isn't some worldly man
[6:06] this is a Godly Man the discretion of a
[6:09] man defareth his anger and it is his
[6:12] glory to pass over a transgression
[6:16] that is not the glory of the world that
[6:19] is not the way of the world that is not
[6:21] a man of the world this Glory has to be
[6:24] a glory that that has come in that man
[6:26] from God from God because the glory of
[6:30] the world and the way the world is is
[6:31] that we do keep record of wrong we don't
[6:35] cover transgression we remember
[6:37] transgressions we don't defer our anger
[6:40] we usually react in Anger that's the
[6:42] world's way but when the glory of the
[6:45] Lord comes in a man or a woman then it's
[6:47] going to be manifesting more of these
[6:49] things and that is a a deference because
[6:51] of discernment you step back and look
[6:54] and before you react in our number one
[6:56] default thing and that's anger before
[6:58] you react in Anger you defer it with
[7:01] wisdom and with discernment to say now
[7:03] wait a minute what is the what is the
[7:06] whole picture can you say Amen what is
[7:08] going on here before I just just respond
[7:11] in anger and then it is the glory of a
[7:14] man to pass over or to cover all over a
[7:18] transgression that's been done to him or
[7:20] any transgression it's the glory I can
[7:22] say safely it's the glory of God to pass
[7:26] over a transgression of somebody else
[7:30] so this is something to say that this
[7:32] amazing this this amazing verse can say
[7:34] so much for a man to come into this kind
[7:38] of reaction and the covering another
[7:41] man's sins he would be entering into
[7:43] another Glory than a regular man
[7:45] reacting in anger and vengeance quickly
[7:49] and keeping tabs on others wrongs is the
[7:53] glory of a worldly man
[7:56] in fact he's praised for it
[8:00] have you ever watched that the men of
[8:03] the world and our stars and our sports
[8:05] stars
[8:06] and our movie stars and the people that
[8:09] are everybody's looking to have you ever
[8:11] noticed how much they get a free pass
[8:13] from manifesting any character
[8:18] because that's the glory of the world
[8:20] so they get free passes all the time
[8:22] they we overlooked that because of their
[8:24] gift because they're good at football or
[8:26] whatever else and they live all kinds of
[8:27] lives and do all kinds of things and yet
[8:30] that glory is the glory of the world
[8:32] because we're still going to praise them
[8:33] we're still going to glorify them we're
[8:36] still going to build them up as a being
[8:38] a mighty Superstar and movie star and
[8:41] singer and all these other things no
[8:43] matter how they live how much they cuss
[8:45] how much they they evade their taxes how
[8:49] much the the the the dirtiness of their
[8:51] life how many marriages they have it
[8:53] doesn't matter what they do we will
[8:55] still glory and praise them for their
[8:58] gift
[8:59] but that and and that is the that's all
[9:02] the further the glory of man goes but
[9:04] this man in the scripture has to be a
[9:07] man of God because a man of the world is
[9:09] praised a man of the world is actually
[9:11] praised for getting back at someone to
[9:14] even the score with somebody to cuss and
[9:16] to think he has he has won the battle by
[9:19] cussing someone else that's the type of
[9:22] people we glorify and to think that he
[9:24] he is a man because in a movie or a
[9:27] video video game this man mowed down
[9:30] hundreds of people with his AK-47 or
[9:33] some machine gun and to think that that
[9:35] he's a real man and he's considered a
[9:37] man because he learned how to to deal
[9:40] with things this way and and that he
[9:42] actually dies holding hateful grudges
[9:45] towards people this is what the the
[9:47] world glorifies but when the glory of
[9:50] the Lord comes on a man he doesn't hold
[9:53] grudges he doesn't hold on to the past
[9:55] and he can cover the sin of another can
[9:58] you say Amen
[9:59] praise the Lord
[10:01] but man from the beginning
[10:04] that's the world but man for the
[10:06] beginning how many know has been made to
[10:09] come into another Glory
[10:12] the glory of the Lord was upon Adam
[10:15] he was in he was a he was a Son of God
[10:19] and he acts like God
[10:21] and when a Son of God comes into that
[10:23] place of Glory again through Redemption
[10:25] he acts like God and he reacts like God
[10:30] I said he acts like God
[10:33] and he reacts like God
[10:36] and we first begin to see this we seated
[10:38] a little bit through the Old Testament
[10:39] but we first begin to see that the glory
[10:42] of God had come back and a man that had
[10:44] fallen from Adam because he was in that
[10:47] Glory Now That Glory completely fills
[10:49] the vessel of Jesus Christ and we see a
[10:52] man with the glory of God act like God
[10:54] do Miracles like God do do signs like
[10:58] God can do right in his vessel but it
[11:00] wasn't just that Jesus acted like God In
[11:03] Miracles and signs and wonders he
[11:05] reacted to situations like God would
[11:09] so it's not just that you act like God
[11:11] but that you react to life situations
[11:15] like God because it's God living in you
[11:19] is everybody awake this morning
[11:21] I was just checking
[11:23] he acts like God he reacts like God and
[11:26] we seated in Jesus Christ we love to
[11:29] hear the Miracles because that was the
[11:31] glory of God upon him that was part of
[11:33] the glory of God he's he's doing
[11:34] Miracles he's able to raise the dead
[11:36] he's able to multiply the fishes and
[11:39] Loaves and so this is the part that gets
[11:41] emphasized many times about Christ
[11:42] Christ is the Miracles we know that the
[11:45] glory of God had returned into the
[11:48] second Adam we call Jesus the second
[11:50] Adam because the first Adam had that he
[11:52] fell away from it and now we have the
[11:54] second Adam Jesus Christ acting like the
[11:58] original Adam who was in rulership and
[12:01] had the authority of God Jesus had all
[12:04] of the authority of God can you say amen
[12:07] he could do anything he wants through
[12:09] the spirit of God that was within him he
[12:12] acted like God but also there's many
[12:14] situations in the four gospels that
[12:17] shows that he reacted like God when
[12:20] demons were coming against him when he
[12:22] was being accused when he is being even
[12:24] beaten the the deeper part of the glory
[12:27] of God was that when Jesus was reviled
[12:30] reviled the Bible says he reviled not
[12:33] again
[12:35] so we know the Miracles but what about
[12:37] the reactions to being reviled
[12:41] the Bible says he reviled not again
[12:44] when anger came at him he didn't react
[12:47] with more anger
[12:49] unless it was holy anger who was
[12:51] correcting religious spirits
[12:54] the boldness you see Jesus was both
[12:57] lying and lamb and with Lion he was the
[13:00] king and he had the boldness and most
[13:02] the time his correction was to religious
[13:04] people so he could call them out of
[13:06] their religion and out of denomination
[13:08] and out of all that phoniness can you
[13:10] say Amen that the systems bring to the
[13:13] people Jesus was bold with religious
[13:15] people to tell it like it was to say you
[13:17] need to come out of that so he was lying
[13:20] but he also was lamb he was sacrificing
[13:23] he had the gentleness can you say amen
[13:25] and so now I just want to quickly get to
[13:28] this because I could preach quite a
[13:29] while right here on Christ I love to
[13:31] preach about the other side to him
[13:33] that's not preached that often but you
[13:36] see now the deeper was is when he was
[13:38] reviled he reviled not again we've seen
[13:41] him when he even had a right to speak
[13:44] Jesus he had a right to speak he was
[13:47] been accused being accused of being
[13:49] wrong he was right they were wrong and
[13:52] he had a right to speak about it and we
[13:54] see him shut his mouth and did not take
[13:56] his right to react
[14:00] this is the glory of God
[14:03] the glory of a man is to cover a
[14:06] transgression
[14:07] and to defer his anger
[14:10] and to hold back
[14:13] and get a discernment of the situation
[14:18] he was falsely accused
[14:20] and he let it go
[14:22] we've seen him boldly correct religious
[14:24] Spirits holding nothing back but then we
[14:28] see him with the woman caught in into in
[14:30] adultery and from the situation with the
[14:33] woman caught in adultery and I don't
[14:35] have to read this you know the story if
[14:36] you don't you can read it in your Bible
[14:38] we find in the situation when the
[14:40] religious leaders brought a woman caught
[14:42] in adultery caught in the very act
[14:43] obviously the situation is they were
[14:46] very angry at her they were very upset
[14:48] because like we caught this woman she's
[14:51] living this way they bring her before
[14:53] Jesus to test Jesus what are you going
[14:55] to do with her knowing that what the law
[14:57] said to do with her and so so it's
[14:59] whenever you have situations like that
[15:02] when someone's going to bring a court
[15:04] case and this is why we have a world
[15:06] full of people suing one another because
[15:09] people get angry and the only way to
[15:11] settle it is to bring them into court
[15:12] I'll see you in court buddy
[15:15] I'll settle this in court I'll see you
[15:17] I'm I'm going to lawyer up you lawyer up
[15:20] we'll see who wins and so we bring it
[15:22] into court and there are some things
[15:23] that will only be settled in court but
[15:25] I'll tell you where it starts it starts
[15:26] with somebody getting angry with
[15:28] somebody
[15:28] there was an injustice done but the
[15:31] Injustice listen now the Injustice is
[15:34] one thing and we have injustices and we
[15:37] have to seek them to make him right
[15:38] sometimes but the anger about it and
[15:41] what you do about it in your humanness
[15:43] is the flaw of man
[15:47] because this life you will have
[15:50] injustices
[15:51] in this life you will have people speak
[15:53] against you
[15:55] in this life people will wrong you
[16:00] I can't guarantee that's not going to
[16:01] happen even this week
[16:04] it's going to happen
[16:05] it's not that it's not going to happen
[16:07] it's what we do with it
[16:10] so now anger became a part of this
[16:12] situation they found her now we're going
[16:14] to test Jesus and so now when you have
[16:17] ten situations come and they're dragging
[16:19] this woman out and they throw her right
[16:21] in front of Jesus and they're all
[16:23] standing around and they're going to
[16:24] their their anger is going to test Jesus
[16:27] because they're already angry at him
[16:28] angry at his ministry they don't like
[16:30] him so we're going to bring them to a
[16:31] test now we find somebody we're going to
[16:33] pull this and this is a very very tense
[16:36] situation and everybody in the whole
[16:38] atmosphere is tense except one person
[16:44] good only one person is keeping their
[16:47] cool
[16:48] only one person is not joining in as I
[16:52] said last Sunday some people want to
[16:54] draw you in the ring with them and have
[16:55] a have a few rounds
[16:58] don't be drawn in the ring with them
[17:00] I had a sister tell me I my family oh my
[17:03] family Lord have mercy they're trying to
[17:04] draw me I will not after what you
[17:06] preached this morning brother I will not
[17:08] I refuse to be draw brought in the ring
[17:10] with them
[17:11] praise the Lord
[17:13] okay and they hate they get madder at
[17:15] you if you won't get in the ring with
[17:16] them it's like I'm not a boxer I'm a
[17:18] Christian
[17:21] right I'm not I don't I don't function
[17:24] that way I'm looking to the word for my
[17:26] reactions and that's not going to do any
[17:28] good to have a 10-minute argument and
[17:30] drop a bunch of bombs and now now the
[17:33] relationship's worse it's not going to
[17:35] do any good so you see Jesus this whole
[17:37] situation it's all tense but he's not
[17:40] tense he's relaxed he's at peace he's
[17:43] standing there and I guarantee you he is
[17:46] not going to join in with their anger
[17:48] with their judgment their accusations
[17:50] with all of their their view of the word
[17:53] of God that he's not joining in with any
[17:56] of that the glory of the Lord is upon
[17:59] him and that is we learn from the
[18:02] prophet perfect Faith how many believe
[18:04] Jesus was living in perfect faith
[18:06] perfect Faith Masters every circumstance
[18:12] now the glory of the world is it's the
[18:15] other way around is that circumstances
[18:18] Master us
[18:20] circumstances Master our emotions
[18:23] circumstances Master how we react but
[18:27] this is a man with perfect faith and
[18:30] perfect faith and perfect love Masters
[18:33] every circumstance and he's standing
[18:35] there completely calm like he was in the
[18:37] boat when the storm came up some
[18:39] Minister was here a few weeks ago
[18:41] brought a great message on the storm and
[18:43] he's calm he's actually sleeping in the
[18:45] boat Jesus is actually sleeping while
[18:47] there's a big storm up and the disciples
[18:49] are scared to death and Jesus is taking
[18:52] a nap during the storm talk about a
[18:55] peaceful man
[18:56] talk about a man that's at peace can you
[18:59] say Amen there is in any storm there it
[19:01] is in any anger there isn't any
[19:03] accusations there isn't any Spirit of
[19:06] people there isn't anything that's going
[19:07] to move him from his peace
[19:11] Hallelujah
[19:15] he's sleeping in the storm
[19:18] Lord don't you care
[19:20] that we're about ready to get destroyed
[19:22] here
[19:23] don't you even care
[19:25] he's sleeping during the storm
[19:27] peace in the midst of the storm
[19:31] can I get an amen this morning are you
[19:33] seeing the vision
[19:34] peace in the midst of the storm he's
[19:36] sleeping during the storm and he gets up
[19:38] and the first thing he does he has the
[19:42] power to address the storm and he does
[19:45] but before he speaks to the storm he
[19:48] speaks to the disciples fear
[19:55] they play this on wlmb when I spoke
[19:57] about it taught about it wlmb
[20:00] Jesus had power to speak to the storm
[20:02] he's got power to speak to your storm
[20:04] today all he has to do is wave his hand
[20:06] and speak to your storm in your life and
[20:08] it would be finished
[20:10] but before he spoke to their storm he
[20:13] spoke about their fear
[20:16] Jesus would rather cast out your fear
[20:18] than cast out your storms
[20:21] can I get an amen this morning
[20:23] because you see now if he's dealing with
[20:25] your fear he's dealing with something
[20:27] probably that's greater than the storm
[20:29] you're making the storm the storm I'm
[20:32] going to die I don't think I'm going to
[20:33] survive this Lord don't you care this
[20:36] storm in my life this divorce in my life
[20:38] that all this thing is happening and you
[20:40] got your mind on the storm and you want
[20:42] Jesus to get his mind on your storm
[20:44] trust me Jesus knows about the storm
[20:47] Jesus knew there was storms going to be
[20:49] in your life he knew about this storm in
[20:50] the boat can you say Amen but he would
[20:52] rather cast out your fear because
[20:55] perfect love cast out
[20:58] all fear
[21:01] what's the greater victory that Jesus
[21:03] speaks to your fear he said why are you
[21:06] so fearful to the disciples why are you
[21:11] in the and can you imagine the storm
[21:13] it's getting ready to knock the boat
[21:15] over it's just it's just and he's
[21:18] wanting to have a conversation about
[21:19] what's internally inside them
[21:22] it's like Jesus hello
[21:27] can we take care of this first
[21:30] no
[21:32] why are you so fearful
[21:35] that's worse
[21:37] I got to get my disciples
[21:40] out of human Faith to perfect faith
[21:43] I got to bring him to a Pentecost I
[21:45] gotta fill them with the Holy Ghost I
[21:47] got to get ready to make him rise as
[21:48] Sons and Daughters of God
[21:52] and so a storm a storm you're scared
[21:55] you're afraid about your life you're
[21:56] afraid things are going to be over here
[21:58] you're afraid this is the the last of it
[22:00] we we tend to set our storms in life
[22:05] huge mammoth
[22:07] bigger than our internal problems
[22:12] praise the Lord
[22:17] so Jesus was
[22:18] in this situation and I got to finish up
[22:21] this but when
[22:23] they the the the the the the the
[22:26] Pharisees
[22:29] had kept a tally of her adulteries they
[22:32] were keeping record
[22:35] and they had it all there
[22:37] had it all written down they had it this
[22:39] is this and this man and this man and
[22:42] besides this whole record of wrongs and
[22:44] adultery we've caught her today in the
[22:47] act and so we got a situation here so
[22:50] we're just wondering how you're going to
[22:51] deal with it and here's this man with
[22:54] the glory of God the discretion of a man
[22:57] deferth his anger first of all he didn't
[22:58] get angry about it and His glory to pass
[23:01] over a transgression and he steps back
[23:03] and he looks much deeper than any of us
[23:07] are looking
[23:09] he steps back
[23:11] and he first he says let him that's
[23:14] without sin cast the first stone they
[23:16] begin to drop their stones
[23:19] but he that day looked at her
[23:21] and and he
[23:24] I'll say it in my own words he says
[23:28] you are free
[23:31] it's washed away
[23:34] he did not remind her of the record of
[23:36] her life because in that moment the
[23:39] record of her life was washed away
[23:43] and he of all people there was not angry
[23:45] was not reacting the situation he looked
[23:48] with discretion at the whole situation
[23:50] and we know he looked in the with the
[23:52] eyes of predestination and he's seen
[23:54] this was a daughter of God but she had
[23:57] this whole record of stuff
[23:59] but in a moment's time he was able to
[24:01] wash all that away and said go and be
[24:04] free and today you are free to start
[24:06] with a clean slate today today you can
[24:11] start with a clean slate
[24:14] and that was the glory of God in Jesus
[24:18] Christ
[24:20] because it's the glory of man a God man
[24:24] to pass over a transgression it's the
[24:27] it's the flaw of the world to keep
[24:29] records of somebody's wrongs
[24:33] is everybody okay with this this morning
[24:34] sure are quiet this morning I hope
[24:37] you're listening really intently
[24:40] and I hope there's amens in the soul
[24:43] because I'm not getting a lot in the
[24:45] lips this morning
[24:47] operation
[24:49] and just just to say it further the
[24:51] glory this Glory this Glory that was in
[24:54] Jesus was to come in Sons and Daughters
[24:56] of God can you say Amen John 1 says but
[25:00] as many as received him to them gave he
[25:03] power to become the sons of God and this
[25:06] Glory was to come in all Sons not just
[25:09] some Sons but all his sons look at this
[25:11] term the sons of God in the New
[25:12] Testament to as many as received him to
[25:15] them gave you power to become the sons
[25:17] of God even to them that believe on his
[25:20] name Romans 8 for as many as are led by
[25:22] the spirit of God they are the sons of
[25:25] God plural the sons of God all creation
[25:28] later on it says all creation is waiting
[25:31] for the manifestation of the sons of God
[25:35] Hebrews 2 for it became him Christ for
[25:38] whom are all things and by whom all
[25:40] things are all things in bringing many
[25:43] sons unto glory to make the captain of
[25:47] their salvation perfect through
[25:49] sufferings he came not just for himself
[25:52] but to bring many sons to the same glory
[25:56] and if it is the glory Glory of man to
[25:59] to defer his anger and to say I'll step
[26:02] back and wait for the leadership of the
[26:04] Lord in every situation and then I'm
[26:06] willing to cover a transgression I'm not
[26:09] I'm willing to to release the record of
[26:12] wrong in somebody's life and see them
[26:14] forgiven that is the glory of God
[26:17] and it won't just be in Jesus it'll be
[26:20] in the sons of God
[26:22] praise the Lord anybody wonder and I'm
[26:25] speaking to all who's listening online
[26:27] as well anybody wonder why these terms
[26:31] of sons of God are in the New Testament
[26:33] the revelation of Jesus Christ and the
[26:37] mystery of Christ is not just in the Son
[26:40] of God but in the sons of God otherwise
[26:45] this term sons of God wouldn't have been
[26:47] mentioned so much in the New Testament
[26:49] it is in the New Testament
[26:51] can you say man
[26:54] it's sons of God coming to the same
[26:56] Glory my Christian friends let me ask
[26:59] you today how many sermons have you
[27:01] heard at your church about the sons of
[27:04] God I guarantee you've heard hundreds of
[27:07] thousands of sermons your whole life
[27:09] about the Son of God you'll hear a lot
[27:12] of them this Christmas the Son of God
[27:14] was born and that's wonderful but I'm
[27:16] here to tell you that's only part of the
[27:18] mystery that's only part of the
[27:20] Revelation you're ignoring the whole
[27:23] other part it's not just the Son of God
[27:25] but it's the sons of God coming to the
[27:29] same Glory that was in Jesus Christ you
[27:32] better find a church that's preaching
[27:34] the full counsel of the word of God not
[27:36] just the Son of God but what that son
[27:39] comes and live in Sons in his glory
[27:42] that's the full mystery of God
[27:45] somebody say praise the Lord this
[27:47] morning
[27:47] hey how many sermons you heard about the
[27:49] sons of God I just read a few to you the
[27:53] manifestation all creation is waiting
[27:55] for the manifestation of the sons of God
[27:58] not the Son of God the sons of God
[28:02] praise the Lord
[28:05] at the end of 2000 years the church
[28:07] history there was a turning point
[28:10] let me just bring this out while I'm on
[28:12] this subject at the end of two thousand
[28:14] years of church history hope you're
[28:16] listening at the end of two thousand
[28:18] years of church history there was a
[28:20] turning point that happened in
[28:22] Revelations 5 Revelations 5 is a turning
[28:25] point you had seven Church ages seven
[28:29] churches they were in Asia Minor but
[28:31] they were types of seven Church ages of
[28:33] two thousand years of church history
[28:35] we're in the laodicean age the final age
[28:38] and so it was Seven Ages and then there
[28:40] was a missing part and Calvary had paid
[28:44] the price how many believe this morning
[28:46] that Calvary had paid the full price of
[28:48] redemption
[28:50] but yet even Calvary and I've been
[28:52] thinking about this this week with
[28:54] Calvary and even Jesus said at the cross
[28:57] it is finished well that's because in
[28:59] the mind of God the work of redemption
[29:01] was finished but you weren't even born
[29:03] yet you weren't redeemed yet so even
[29:05] though he proclaimed it is finished
[29:07] it'll be a complete Redemption
[29:10] but you hadn't come on the scene so now
[29:12] 2 000 years of predestinated sons of God
[29:15] come forth and be redeemed redeemed
[29:18] redeemed and then we get to the last one
[29:20] and we realize there's still a missing
[29:22] part he went to Calvary but there's
[29:24] still a missing part of redemption what
[29:26] was it the book of redemption that had
[29:28] your name in it was sealed up
[29:34] um write in your Bible revelations 5.
[29:38] so there was even though Christ went to
[29:41] Calvary the Son of God there was a
[29:43] barrier
[29:44] keeping sons from the full
[29:49] complete Redemption as Sons
[29:52] there was a barrier
[29:56] so all the glory of what the son could
[29:59] be was held back to the sons
[30:03] there was a breach between the church
[30:05] ages and the seals that's the way it's
[30:07] termed the breach between the church
[30:10] ages and the seals a breach
[30:12] a breach is a gap or a breakthrough to a
[30:17] wall or a barrier
[30:19] he termed it the breach between the
[30:22] church ages and the seals Revelations 5
[30:24] is the breach between the churches and
[30:26] Zeals and the breach is a gap everybody
[30:28] listening
[30:30] a breach is a gap or a breakthrough to a
[30:34] wall or a barrier there was still a
[30:36] barrier to get to and Revelations 5 is
[30:39] the book of redemption in other words
[30:40] there was a barrier we couldn't get
[30:42] fully to our names in the book and full
[30:44] Redemption until he he made a gap he
[30:47] made a breach and the breach that he
[30:49] broke the berry was seven Zeals on it
[30:52] that was the bear you couldn't look at
[30:53] it nobody could look at it nobody was
[30:55] worthy to look at it and even John cried
[30:58] and wept why was John weeping in
[31:00] Revelations 5 because nobody was found
[31:03] worthy to look or take the book or take
[31:05] the seals off and if nobody took this
[31:08] book all of creation would be lost there
[31:11] was a barrier
[31:12] but I'm here to tell you by the grace of
[31:14] God in the last days he breaks he
[31:17] breaches that he makes a gap and he
[31:19] tears the seals off of that book so
[31:22] finally sons of God not just the Son of
[31:25] God but sons of God and guess what it
[31:27] was the lamb who did that as well it was
[31:30] the lamb that was worthy tore the seals
[31:32] off in this last days
[31:35] so sons of God begin to look and see
[31:38] their position in the word so that they
[31:41] can come
[31:42] to his final Glory
[31:46] I know this is going to translate into
[31:48] how we act every day that's the way I
[31:50] always lean but I want you to know the
[31:52] mystery of it the breach the Gap has
[31:55] been made
[31:57] the seals have been taken off the book
[32:00] of redemption somebody say praise the
[32:02] Lord
[32:03] that's the hour you live in if you don't
[32:05] know it my friend if you're listening
[32:06] you're here you don't know I would be
[32:08] glad to share with you the scriptures to
[32:10] show it's time the time is now he even
[32:13] gave us the exact day when he would do
[32:16] it the time exact season that he would
[32:19] do it when he said in Revelations 10 7
[32:21] because in Revelations 5 it was closed
[32:24] then the lamb takes it in Revelation 10
[32:26] it's open and what did he say he gave
[32:28] when is it when is it when is it going
[32:30] to happen in the days of the voice of
[32:33] the seventh angel when Isha begins to
[32:34] sound the mystery of God should be
[32:36] finished he gave the season it's in the
[32:39] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[32:41] when he will break this Gap
[32:44] he'll make a gap he'll break the barrier
[32:47] can you say Amen that Sons can begin to
[32:49] walk into and step into that position as
[32:52] a Son of God and all the glory of God
[32:55] can pour upon
[32:57] the sons of God again
[33:00] Hallelujah
[33:06] this is why Solomon could word this this
[33:09] way and say the discretion of a man
[33:11] defer his anger and it is his glory to
[33:13] pass over a transgression this is why
[33:16] because with discernment and caution
[33:19] with discernment in the sons of God
[33:22] there's discretion before they react and
[33:25] being led by the spirit of God as sons
[33:26] of God we don't react in our anger and a
[33:30] son of God has the ability to cover a
[33:33] multitude of sins instead of keeping
[33:36] account of them in everybody's life
[33:38] it is the glory of God to do so
[33:42] so this week you can choose
[33:44] you can live like everybody else or you
[33:47] can submit yourself instead let the
[33:49] glory of God fill this Temple
[33:52] that I stopped keeping a record of
[33:54] everybody's wrong
[33:58] praise the Lord
[33:59] this discretion is showing good judgment
[34:02] in situations before reacting looking
[34:04] deeper into it before we react in Anger
[34:07] you know police are example policemen
[34:09] are example of having to use discretion
[34:11] in every situation I thought of them a
[34:14] policeman let's first of all say the
[34:17] policeman has has to use discretion in
[34:20] every situation that changes every day
[34:21] with every situation and we know there's
[34:24] a few cases there's very few cases where
[34:27] a policeman fails in his discretion and
[34:30] sometimes he has to react very quickly
[34:32] you know he's armed and he's not only
[34:34] are but he's got the authority to use
[34:36] the the uh he's that he's armed and so
[34:39] now he walks into domestic situations he
[34:41] walks into people with guns then he
[34:44] walks into uh all all kinds of
[34:47] situations I wouldn't want to be a
[34:48] policeman but you see now he has the
[34:50] authority from the city or from the
[34:52] state to to act can you say man but he
[34:56] has to act with discretion and some
[34:58] decisions have to be made quickly and
[35:00] it's difficult and some of our law
[35:02] enforcement there's been few cases where
[35:04] they have failed and they didn't use the
[35:06] right discretion and they fail miserably
[35:08] they either get fired they go to prison
[35:10] for it we understand that because of
[35:11] their humanness we understand it because
[35:13] we're human can you say Amen but you see
[35:16] now there's more cases and I say if you
[35:18] got the statistics there's thousands
[35:21] more cases than the ones where they
[35:22] failed what police been acted with with
[35:25] with with caution and they acted with
[35:27] discretion and they was trying to to
[35:29] weigh the whole situation as best they
[35:31] can so they don't react the wrong way
[35:34] with their Authority now the rest of us
[35:36] don't have that Authority but policemen
[35:39] have that Authority so their discretion
[35:41] in every situation is important to us
[35:44] that we have a trust in those men that
[35:46] they will act at every situation with
[35:48] discretion
[35:50] with discernment can you say Amen but
[35:52] guess what police have the authority
[35:54] they've got that armor with them they're
[35:56] to react quickly but but but they
[35:59] they're sometimes even acting quickly
[36:00] they got to have discretion they got to
[36:02] have caution they can't let themselves
[36:04] become irritated too irritated with
[36:07] people because if they let them their
[36:09] own anger and their own irritation it
[36:11] would take over them and all of a sudden
[36:12] they're they're grabbing their gun and
[36:14] they're using it for the wrong reason
[36:16] they have the authority to use that
[36:19] but you have to have discernment with it
[36:24] they can't let themselves become
[36:25] irritated
[36:27] people get mad at police all the time
[36:29] and I think they get mad at uh
[36:32] I think they get mad at Authority in
[36:34] general
[36:36] they don't like anybody in Authority we
[36:38] have a generation that don't like
[36:40] anybody in Authority they don't like to
[36:42] uh
[36:44] come under any Authority
[36:46] they want to get rid of the cops they
[36:49] want to defund the police system what
[36:51] kind of word would we have then
[36:53] we elect them and we give them Authority
[36:56] so that we're protected but we would
[36:58] love to have a force that uses
[37:01] discretion we don't want someone's going
[37:03] to snap right and so now this is I I
[37:06] know it's strange to type sons of God
[37:08] with policemen but you know what sons of
[37:11] God have the authority of God to use any
[37:16] way they want
[37:18] sons of God have the authority of God
[37:21] like a policeman a pastor has certain
[37:23] authorities that's been given him to God
[37:25] a husband has Authority uh and so
[37:28] there's god-given authorities but you
[37:30] can abuse that or you can use it in the
[37:32] right way it's your discernment but
[37:35] there are certain people in Authority
[37:36] they get the authority whether they use
[37:38] it right or not they get it and then
[37:40] they'll lose that Authority if they use
[37:41] it wrong can you say Amen pastors and
[37:43] all you keep abusing the authority of
[37:45] God God's going to remove you or the
[37:47] congregation is going to remove you and
[37:49] so but but listen now every believer
[37:52] every believer in Christ has the
[37:54] authority of God we have Jesus name we
[37:58] not only say Jesus name but we have the
[38:01] power of His name
[38:02] and so we hold that Authority and hear
[38:05] the policeman he carries Authority he
[38:07] carries heat he has to have discernment
[38:09] and all kinds of situations if if Bob is
[38:12] traveling for lack of a better term Bob
[38:15] is traveling at 75 miles per hour in his
[38:18] 60s uh miles an hour speed limit then
[38:21] the police officer pulls Bob over and he
[38:24] has a he has this is all to bring out
[38:27] what discretion is it has he has a
[38:29] decision of either giving Bob a warning
[38:32] or giving Bob a ticket how many is glad
[38:34] when you get a warning
[38:36] all right
[38:38] because you know even if you're guilty
[38:41] sometimes
[38:42] you know your heart
[38:47] you know I I've tried to it's not like I
[38:49] got a million tickets but I have tried
[38:51] to use with my tickets
[38:52] everything in the book and whenever I
[38:55] try to use something intentionally I'm a
[38:57] pastor
[39:01] it's always backfired on me
[39:03] it gets worse after I say that
[39:06] well if you're a pastor why are you
[39:07] speeding
[39:09] I'm a Christian
[39:11] I was on my way to church
[39:14] just it's better not to say nothing
[39:19] Bob has the authority to make the
[39:21] decision doesn't matter you know is he
[39:23] and and so Bob uh Bob is going to get a
[39:28] warning but the policeman has the
[39:29] authority over Bob he's going to make
[39:31] the call
[39:32] and when you get pulled over and when
[39:34] like here bobby gets pulled over for a
[39:36] ticket here and he's speeding both sides
[39:39] it can be a pretty tense situation
[39:43] the police can be mad at him speeding
[39:46] I've had policemen very mad they're very
[39:48] mad they're very upset and that you know
[39:51] to me oh my if this guy's walking up
[39:53] this mad I have no mercy whatsoever just
[39:56] because he's mad
[39:58] and he's he's mad plus he has the
[40:00] authority so I'm not going to get out of
[40:02] that ticket and sometimes I don't want
[40:04] to get out because I'm guilty if I'm not
[40:06] guilty I say it but if if I'm if I'm
[40:08] guilty I say yes sir I was doing that
[40:10] and I find that works better I had I had
[40:13] one just the other day like I said I
[40:14] don't have a million of these pullovers

[40:20] now for the videos and more and more I
[40:23] have to edit things out
[40:26] but
[40:28] you know I had on the other day I just
[40:30] thought right I said sir I am guilty I
[40:33] uh I pulled over on a highway in the
[40:35] traffic I pulled to the right side
[40:38] and uh you're not supposed to go you're
[40:39] supposed to stay in the lane if you even
[40:41] if you're backed up for two hours you
[40:43] stay in that I did it boy he got me and
[40:45] he walks up just saying I said listen I
[40:47] am I did it I'm guilty I know I wasn't
[40:49] supposed to do that he said well at
[40:50] least you're honest about it and I got
[40:53] off the hook
[40:55] found that's better than saying I'm a
[40:58] pastor
[41:01] no and don't get you off
[41:04] but but that policeman has to make a
[41:08] judgment call because he has Authority
[41:10] but if he walks over there like a lot of
[41:13] them in Anger he's if he's going to stay
[41:15] in his anger about it he needs to be
[41:17] calm-headed because he's going to come
[41:19] into a lot of situations but if he stays
[41:21] he's just angry and he takes his
[41:23] authority is anybody listening to what
[41:25] I'm preaching this morning
[41:27] if he has Authority and he takes his
[41:29] anger with his authority it's not going
[41:32] to be good
[41:34] it's probably not going to be a good
[41:36] judgment in this situation
[41:38] you see so that's Christians we have
[41:41] authority but we we don't have a right
[41:43] to react in our anger we might be upset
[41:46] about it but we have to be careful we're
[41:48] not drawn into the situation and so now
[41:51] the the policeman's mad Bob's mad
[41:54] because he's being pulled over Bob's mad
[41:57] the police this is a tense situation
[41:59] Bob's upset why did I get pulled over I
[42:02] wasn't speeding most the people defend
[42:03] themselves even though we're when
[42:04] they're wrong they're saying I didn't do
[42:06] nothing I've got to get to work all
[42:07] these other so everybody's angry
[42:09] everybody's angry Bob's angry the
[42:12] policeman's angry Bob's wife is really
[42:15] angry sitting next to him
[42:17] she's mad too which which doubles the
[42:20] anger and everything's tense and then if
[42:22] you got kids in the back your kids are
[42:25] scared to death that they're all going
[42:26] to go to jail
[42:28] my kids when they were little it's just
[42:30] like we got pulled over a couple times
[42:32] and it's like they were scared of
[42:35] Solomon's big eyes and Gideon's sad face
[42:40] and dead are we going to go to jail
[42:45] and I said I said one time and this was
[42:48] a real lesson for me that I had not been
[42:50] teaching my kids right I said kids
[42:54] okay kids why do you wear seat belts
[42:59] why do you wear seat belts
[43:02] so we don't get caught by the police is
[43:04] what they said
[43:06] and I realized I was a failure as a
[43:08] parent
[43:09] if I teach him the word of God that way
[43:11] I'm doing wrong
[43:13] why do we follow the word God because we
[43:14] don't get caught
[43:17] no no no no no I didn't teach you that
[43:20] it's not so we get caught go to jail
[43:22] that's not it it's to protect us it's
[43:24] for safety
[43:26] idiot
[43:31] this can be these can be tense
[43:33] situations and if not you're the cop
[43:35] life offers some tense situation where
[43:38] everybody is starting to get really
[43:40] close to blowing a fuse
[43:43] Lord make us manifest the Divine love of
[43:47] God of Jesus to settle down
[43:50] grab some discernment
[43:52] from the Lord and react
[43:56] the decision is up to that policeman
[43:59] and he decides not to give Bob a ticket
[44:03] because Bob when he looked at it Bob has
[44:07] a perfect driving record
[44:09] he has used the cop has used his
[44:12] discretion in it all he's looking at the
[44:16] whole thing and he chooses to give him a
[44:18] warning because he looked at his record
[44:19] and this is the first time he's had this
[44:21] so he's not weighing just I'm mad at him
[44:23] I'm going to give him the ticket no he's
[44:26] weighing the whole picture isn't that
[44:28] what Jesus did when the woman was caught
[44:31] in adultery
[44:33] I said isn't that what he did
[44:36] so there's a bit of a glory in that
[44:37] there's a cop holding his authority but
[44:39] all the more with sons and daughters of
[44:41] God who has Christ in them we realize
[44:44] that we must act in our Authority with
[44:47] discretion now that's a foundation to
[44:49] finish up these two points today and to
[44:52] break down these other two
[44:53] manifestations of divine love is
[44:55] everybody ready everybody got this
[44:57] scripture and I spent the last uh hour
[44:59] on the discretion of a man defareth his
[45:02] anger the discernment the caution of a
[45:05] man in every situation will defer his
[45:07] anger that's not the default thing that
[45:09] he acts with is anger something triggers
[45:12] him and he just reacts with anger that's
[45:14] not the glory of the that's not the
[45:15] right glory and and it is his glory to
[45:19] pass over a transgression he's not
[45:21] keeping records of wrong so this next
[45:24] point of divine love is love is not
[45:25] easily provoked to anger Ecclesiastes 7
[45:28] 9 says be not Hasty in thy Spirit to be
[45:32] angry for anger resteth in the bosom of
[45:37] force
[45:38] in this version of cab the same
[45:41] scripture says don't be quick to get
[45:44] angry for Only Fools nurse anger
[45:49] so that's that's a further
[45:50] interpretation if you have something in
[45:52] the bosom of foods fools it actually
[45:55] goes back to a woman who has a baby in
[45:57] her bosom and she's going to feed that
[45:59] and nurse that baby and she holds it she
[46:01] protects it she nurses it and do you
[46:04] know that you got somebody nursing like
[46:06] a baby nursing their anger and holding
[46:09] it close to them their whole life
[46:12] no wonder if they're nursing their anger
[46:15] they're coddling their anger they're
[46:17] protecting their anger and they're
[46:19] holding it there instead of doing what
[46:20] Brother Kyle said a few ways a night you
[46:22] got to let it go
[46:24] real simple message you just got to let
[46:26] it go
[46:27] you got to let things go
[46:28] but this guy's not letting us go he's
[46:30] actually coddling and holding and
[46:32] nursing his anger
[46:35] holding it close to him for Life he's
[46:37] not letting go at all don't be quick to
[46:40] angry because if you're nursing only the
[46:42] full nurse is anger and if if you're
[46:45] quick to anger all it's going to do is
[46:48] keep festering and keep festering and
[46:50] nurse the anger further it has to come
[46:53] an end to your anger
[46:56] brothers and sisters listen to me
[46:58] we're always going to have the emotion
[47:00] of anger but if you're nursing it for
[47:03] life you'll see destruction in your path
[47:07] and you don't even recognize it because
[47:09] you have old anger and you're nursing it
[47:12] and anybody who tees you off just with
[47:14] one thing it brings back all the past
[47:16] memories and you're quick the reason
[47:18] you're quick to get angry is you're
[47:20] nursing your anger
[47:23] wow
[47:26] amen James 1 says wherefore my beloved
[47:30] brother let every man be swift to hear
[47:33] we need to be more listeners than
[47:35] talkers
[47:38] be swift here be more willing to listen
[47:43] than just react quickly
[47:46] Swift to hear
[47:48] slow to speak
[47:51] slow to anger slow to Wrath
[47:56] why because the wrath of man not God now
[48:00] because Ami knows God has a Wrath yes
[48:03] it's a holy wrath but the wrath of man
[48:05] will never work the righteousness of God
[48:09] and that's a good reason not to nurse
[48:12] your anger anymore too it will never
[48:14] produce the righteousness of God well
[48:16] I'm a Christian I've been in the message
[48:17] for 20 years I've been messaged for 50
[48:19] years I'm I'm a Believer I believe this
[48:22] I believe the message I believe the end
[48:24] times I believe all these things I go to
[48:26] a message church but if you're nursing
[48:27] your anger your whole life you've got a
[48:29] whole track record of all kinds of
[48:31] things going on and you can't it can't
[48:33] work the righteousness of God it can't
[48:35] it never brings the fruit of that any
[48:39] further you're stuck right there with
[48:41] your anger at your bosom
[48:45] you still love me
[48:49] get to an altar lay down your anger
[48:52] before the Lord Lord let me die and let
[48:55] me hand back this anger to you Lord
[48:57] that's what he says cast all your cares
[48:59] everything on him
[49:01] Lord I've got to die to this now I'm 50
[49:04] years old I'm 40 years old
[49:06] I'm five years old
[49:10] it's best to get rid of that anger now
[49:13] and release it to the Lord
[49:15] now can you say Amen
[49:19] give it back to God so
[49:23] so this is after
[49:25] that the prophet is saying we should
[49:28] live a life to the world they can tell
[49:30] when it's real that we live a real
[49:32] Christian Life okay and this is somebody
[49:34] responding saying if I'm ever a
[49:36] Christian so it's something the world
[49:37] says if I ever become a Christian
[49:40] I want to be like that man or that woman
[49:42] so they're looking at our lives so
[49:43] that's the way they'll be if I ever do I
[49:46] see something in them that's different
[49:47] it's a change they act different than
[49:49] the world they react different to
[49:51] situations how many want to say that's
[49:53] how I want the world to see my life
[49:55] but when you're when you blow off and
[49:58] you cuss and you're reacting all the
[50:01] same way as any other employer or any
[50:03] other person did when you're boiling
[50:06] with this anger and doing it you're not
[50:09] acting much different than their last
[50:11] boss
[50:12] and yet you're claiming Christianity
[50:16] if I ever was a Christian I'd want to be
[50:18] like that man or the wonderful they have
[50:19] love joy peace long-suffering goodness
[50:21] gentleness patience meekness and so
[50:24] forth the nine fruits of the spirit
[50:25] dwells within them they're not easily
[50:28] provoked you can't make them mad at you
[50:34] laughs
[50:37] oh it's so quiet in here it's so quiet
[50:42] somebody give me a pin
[50:44] and I'm gonna drop it
[50:47] it's gonna be
[50:52] they're not easily provoked you can't
[50:54] make them mad at you
[50:56] they will not become angry
[50:58] they're so loving that in their very
[51:00] presence you feel Christ
[51:03] help me Lord
[51:05] I'm looking at that image Lord
[51:09] I'm not what I want to be but I'm not
[51:10] what I used to be
[51:12] but I'm not the image of what I should
[51:14] be until I die to myself
[51:18] and lay my anger
[51:20] this uh not easily provoked to anger
[51:25] there are regular irritations in life
[51:28] are we going to give me just a little
[51:29] more time this morning
[51:31] there are regular irritations in life
[51:33] that that cause it's not just somebody
[51:35] being angry at you there are things that
[51:37] trigger us trigger us and they make us
[51:41] irritated at something okay and so we of
[51:45] course our our goal and our spirit
[51:47] should say Lord I want to get to this
[51:49] place that I'm even the regular
[51:51] irritations in life that we're more
[51:54] patient with it that we're more more
[51:57] restful with it and not to react and I
[52:00] encourage people pre-marital counseling
[52:04] um if you want to go through it with the
[52:07] the leadership here uh before you get
[52:09] married I encourage it and it's it's not
[52:11] ever to discourage somebody falling in
[52:13] love it's so that you research a little
[52:16] bit of your life and your spirit and
[52:18] your heart and the girls and you
[52:20] research it together in a very nice way
[52:23] but you're trying to see if there's any
[52:27] triggers in your life that that mate
[52:30] might not realize that they're stepping
[52:32] on something and they irritate it and
[52:35] you have unresolved anger unresolved
[52:37] triggers there because now if you get in
[52:40] marriage and that spouse does not know
[52:43] what your past is then they're going to
[52:45] trigger and step on your pain and
[52:47] there's going to be a reaction and your
[52:49] spouse is going why in the world did you
[52:51] react that extreme because you really
[52:54] didn't lay your triggers and lay your
[52:56] pain before the Lord
[52:59] you didn't really discover it I love for
[53:01] young people to start laying these
[53:03] things before God now what's in me Lord
[53:04] that needs to come out Lord you're not
[53:06] going to get everything but at least
[53:08] you're working at it and the reason the
[53:10] one reason I tell couples to do it is
[53:12] because the devil has less grounds to
[53:14] try to divide your Oneness in your
[53:16] mercies he's got less grounds to be on
[53:17] if you're aware of what triggers one
[53:20] another
[53:21] if you're aware of it it's half the half
[53:22] the battle
[53:24] right
[53:27] so there's regular irritations I mean we
[53:29] we had it we went out for a few days and
[53:31] at the airport on Sunday night it was
[53:34] like there was this couple and there
[53:36] were a Nigerian couple brother Michael
[53:38] and they had their baby with them in a
[53:41] stroller and we're going through
[53:42] security and they're going to Nigeria
[53:45] obviously and I found that out later and
[53:47] I think they had half of their house
[53:50] they were taking with them through the
[53:52] security they had everything with them
[53:55] and I don't know what they checked in
[53:58] but this was half their house here and
[54:01] the stroller was huge and somehow we got
[54:03] behind them and I realized I'm getting a
[54:06] little irritated because we're running a
[54:09] little late and it's like okay we need
[54:11] to get through security you know even if
[54:13] I'm not running late uh Securities
[54:15] irritate me anyway might as well admit
[54:16] it
[54:18] foreign
[54:20] went with me to the Philippines
[54:24] and I I hope I want I think he had a
[54:27] wonderful trip but his biggest struggle
[54:29] was being with me in the airport
[54:34] I don't know if he'll ever go back with
[54:35] me again you could go with some other
[54:37] missionary
[54:38] but we were in in irritation yeah it was
[54:41] I mean we come back to Hong Kong from
[54:43] the Philippines and realize my flight
[54:45] going back home was 12 hours later than
[54:47] what we expected so we had to spend 12
[54:49] hours in the Hong Kong airport and it
[54:51] was overnight so we couldn't go uh to
[54:56] Hong Kong Disney or we couldn't go any
[54:58] of that it was the night time and we
[54:59] couldn't go out so we had to spend the
[55:01] entire night in the airport so you know
[55:03] this and he could fill my tenseness and
[55:06] it's just like wow I didn't want to
[55:07] spend 12 hours in the Hong Kong airport
[55:09] and so then to make a long short we made
[55:12] it I went to that was the first
[55:14] McDonald's I had seen so I satisfied
[55:17] myself at McDonald's for a few hours
[55:21] and then uh we found a place that you
[55:24] could sleep for a while like they had
[55:26] some beds you could rent them and we
[55:28] slept so it ended up working out but
[55:30] anyway he got an idea so I get tents in
[55:32] airports anyway I get tents since we're
[55:36] all I'm just given all my confessions to
[55:38] you this morning
[55:41] I'll continue and then I'll let my wife
[55:42] up to give about 50 more
[55:45] drive-throughs drive me through the wall
[55:48] drive-throughs aren't drive-throughs
[55:49] they drive me crazy
[55:52] so anyway this nice couple and they
[55:55] weren't nice at that time because they
[55:57] were they had everything and then the
[55:59] guy the security guard had to get that
[56:02] stroller through the machine you
[56:04] couldn't just drive it through the
[56:05] scanner it had to fit and they were
[56:08] crunching and I know they spent 20
[56:10] minutes trying to Crunch this thing down
[56:12] and push it through the machine
[56:15] it's like just drive it through just
[56:18] leave it here buy one in Africa
[56:22] don't take any huge bags and just and
[56:26] stuffing this stuff through that scanner
[56:28] and it took forever and then as I come
[56:31] to the other side and it's taken us
[56:33] about a good over a half hour I would it
[56:37] seemed like
[56:39] I'm reminded of what I was preaching
[56:42] that Sunday morning
[56:44] by the Lord usually that reminder comes
[56:46] from my wife but this came from the Lord
[56:51] and I wasn't even on this subject yet
[56:53] it's just all this subject of divine
[56:55] love and I'll tell you I have been
[56:57] tested in my home life domestic life
[57:00] family I have been tested to the very
[57:03] core Myself by these if this series
[57:05] isn't for anybody else it's for me
[57:08] to look at my life and say Lord I'm
[57:11] struggling but I want this more
[57:14] excellent way
[57:16] I Gotta Have It
[57:20] and so then we come through the other
[57:22] side and I start I said all right
[57:23] because of what I preached this morning
[57:25] I'm going to start talking to this
[57:27] couple ask where they're going going
[57:28] three months Nigeria ah we got Nigerian
[57:30] people in our church and I asked if they
[57:33] knew your names and I was just
[57:35] hi
[57:36] I connected I connected and I found them
[57:40] to be the nicest couple both of them so
[57:43] nice cute baby I changed my whole
[57:46] attitude towards those people and they
[57:47] were very open they started talking I
[57:49] started to talk about the church and and
[57:50] they lived close enough and I got I got
[57:53] the new card out
[57:55] and the people that I was so irritated
[57:58] at
[57:59] a hand of card and invited him to church
[58:01] he says we'll get home we're going to
[58:03] come and visit
[58:05] now if I'd have stayed in my former
[58:07] attitude
[58:09] do you think they'd come and hear me
[58:10] preach
[58:13] I destroyed it I didn't even get a
[58:15] chance to preach anything to him yet and
[58:18] I destroyed the chances why why because
[58:21] my first discernment wasn't good of the
[58:23] situation and I was irritated so that's
[58:25] normal irritations but what about what
[58:28] about when
[58:30] what about when a pastor gets going so
[58:32] you don't preach all day what about
[58:35] what this provoking means the Greek word
[58:38] for provoke means to sharpen to
[58:40] stimulate to Rouse to anger that's that
[58:44] provoking pushing another's buttons okay
[58:48] and this is love is not easily easily
[58:51] provoked to anger but that's what it
[58:53] does sharp and stimulate Rouse to anger
[58:55] the Phillips Bible
[58:58] paraphrases this love it is not touchy
[59:02] love does not have a hair trigger temper
[59:05] some people make everyone around them
[59:08] walk on eggshells because they're always
[59:11] their feelings are on their shoulders
[59:12] and they don't know how to act because
[59:14] they walk to eggshells because because
[59:16] maybe it's you you keep everyone in
[59:18] eggshells because you're you're touchy
[59:20] and you're you're just you could blow up
[59:24] at any time
[59:27] it is not touchy love does not have a
[59:29] hair triggered temper
[59:31] some people make everyone around them
[59:32] walk on eggshells they're easily
[59:34] offended one little thing that doesn't
[59:37] go their way and kaboom
[59:40] and they use their temper to intimidate
[59:45] and to punish
[59:50] now there's there's something to preach
[59:52] about
[59:53] they actually use their anger as a
[59:56] weapon
[59:57] to intimidate
[59:59] to push back
[1:00:01] to punish someone to get back at them
[1:00:05] and when you confront them many times
[1:00:07] they say sure I have a bad temper
[1:00:11] but a lot of people has problems
[1:00:14] I know I got that temper but you know
[1:00:16] what at least I just get it all out and
[1:00:19] it's over in a few minutes
[1:00:23] you know what that's like
[1:00:25] that's like a bomb
[1:00:29] it's like a bomb
[1:00:31] I just get it out there and you're
[1:00:33] actually Justified and it's over a few
[1:00:35] that's a bomb
[1:00:37] you drop a bomb and it's over in a few
[1:00:40] minutes but look at the devastation it
[1:00:43] leaves behind
[1:00:46] you think it's over you went back to
[1:00:48] work or you went back to your bedroom
[1:00:49] and you went back to kaboom
[1:00:52] explosion
[1:00:54] it's over I said it I said my piece it's
[1:00:57] done it's not over because you drop the
[1:00:59] bomb and look at all the devastation
[1:01:01] from the bomb
[1:01:06] when you're angry usually
[1:01:09] you're not loving
[1:01:12] the King James version these are the
[1:01:14] scriptures I've given to you be not
[1:01:16] Hasty in thy Spirit to be angry for
[1:01:18] anger resteth in the bosom of fools
[1:01:21] let me move real quickly now to the next
[1:01:23] point
[1:01:25] and this quote wasn't finished I guess
[1:01:27] okay
[1:01:29] there there you are that's what the
[1:01:30] church needs not because you could argue
[1:01:32] your religious standpoint that doesn't
[1:01:34] mean it's your life that proves what you
[1:01:36] are amen everybody's still with me one
[1:01:39] more Point love does not keep a record
[1:01:41] of others wrongs love does not keep a
[1:01:44] record of others wrongs and the
[1:01:47] scripture says love thinketh no evil so
[1:01:50] it's it's tied to our thinking love does
[1:01:53] not keep a record of others wrongs it
[1:01:56] thinketh no evil so it's tied to our
[1:01:59] thoughts a lot of times we're not
[1:02:01] keeping a record of others wrongs
[1:02:04] in a in a log somewhere or in QuickBooks
[1:02:09] but we're keeping it in our thinking
[1:02:11] that's why you it think of Love thinketh
[1:02:13] no evil because it's this thought
[1:02:15] process as you look at that person and
[1:02:18] you've got the log in your mind and so
[1:02:20] you're looking you're thinking evil
[1:02:22] thoughts of of them instead of
[1:02:25] positive thoughts
[1:02:28] instead of right thoughts
[1:02:30] you're thinking already and you're
[1:02:33] standing there talking trying to be
[1:02:34] polite if you're been doing that and
[1:02:36] you're shaking their hand God bless you
[1:02:38] and you're you give a cold handshake
[1:02:43] you know
[1:02:45] because you've seen him from across the
[1:02:48] room and you think you're you're
[1:02:49] thinking you've got the whole record
[1:02:51] going over of what Dan has done wrong to
[1:02:53] you and his life and what he's done
[1:02:55] wrong to everybody and you're thinking
[1:02:57] all that through so now you give him the
[1:02:59] cold shoulder but it's all in your
[1:03:01] thoughts
[1:03:02] you keep it a record in your thoughts
[1:03:05] this is our text the discretion of man
[1:03:07] defer this anger and His glory is a
[1:03:08] Passover transgression first Peter 48
[1:03:10] when above all things have fervent
[1:03:12] charity among yourselves for charity
[1:03:15] shall cover a multitude of sins it
[1:03:19] doesn't keep record Divine love but it
[1:03:21] actually actually releases the record of
[1:03:24] somebody and it forgives can you say
[1:03:27] Amen
[1:03:29] so it's in the thinking really that we
[1:03:31] hold this account now this word when it
[1:03:33] talks about accounting it thinketh no
[1:03:36] evil and it's tied to the Greek here
[1:03:38] that's why we get the conclusion love
[1:03:39] does not keep a record of others wrong
[1:03:42] this is a counting word it's used of
[1:03:45] numerical calculation it is used the
[1:03:48] same word in the Greek is used of God
[1:03:50] that does not impute our guilt to us he
[1:03:53] does not impute sin to us which means he
[1:03:55] doesn't he he doesn't keep it on our
[1:03:57] account he releases it from our account
[1:03:59] but instead of imputing the
[1:04:01] righteousness of Christ to instead God
[1:04:05] imputes the righteousness of Christ to
[1:04:07] our account and does not impute our
[1:04:09] guilt or our sin Romans 4 6-8 that's
[1:04:12] what it says so love doesn't keep a
[1:04:16] tally of wrongs and bear a grudge until
[1:04:19] everyone has has it paid for
[1:04:23] can I get an amen
[1:04:25] love does not keep a tally of wrongs and
[1:04:28] bear a grudge until everyone is paid for
[1:04:30] it doesn't try to gain the upper hand by
[1:04:33] reminding the other person of the past
[1:04:36] wrongs love
[1:04:37] forgives can you say Amen
[1:04:40] love forgives and it tries to even
[1:04:43] forget
[1:04:44] it's that's harder
[1:04:46] but for sure love forgives
[1:04:50] love forgives love forgives love love
[1:04:53] doesn't keep a record of others wrong
[1:04:56] how much do we do that how much record
[1:04:58] are we keeping of another person's wrong
[1:05:02] you know we are taught so hard to keep
[1:05:05] records in in the world we live in if
[1:05:08] you're in business you got to keep Good
[1:05:10] Records or you're going to have bad
[1:05:11] business you keep receipts I uh my
[1:05:14] secretaries pull their hair out because
[1:05:16] I'm not good at I keep the receipt but I
[1:05:18] can't remember where it is and if I
[1:05:21] remember where it is I don't know
[1:05:22] remember what expense it's for and so
[1:05:25] now I'm really bad at that but we're in
[1:05:27] if we keep good business we've got to
[1:05:28] keep records of things so we're in it
[1:05:30] and some people are good at keeping Good
[1:05:32] Records financially some people are not
[1:05:34] but some people are good accountants
[1:05:36] some are not but now I'm looking at a
[1:05:38] live keeping records of people's wrongs
[1:05:40] that they do us in our lives and and so
[1:05:42] we're taught accounting be have a good
[1:05:44] accountant if you're going to have a
[1:05:45] business you got to have a good account
[1:05:47] at keeping up with those things how many
[1:05:49] know that's true and uh maybe you have
[1:05:52] some program like QuickBooks and you
[1:05:55] keep up with all the expenses and all
[1:05:57] that goes out all that comes in and
[1:06:00] those things help you uh to keep good
[1:06:02] books but you know brother Brown says
[1:06:04] that God keeps good books too
[1:06:07] let me know God keeps good books
[1:06:11] God is the perfect accountant
[1:06:13] God has the perfect QuickBooks
[1:06:16] and brother Brown refers to your giving
[1:06:18] he says the littlest giving he even said
[1:06:20] now when you you when you send money
[1:06:22] money and you give money and you send me
[1:06:24] overseas he said you'll get credit to
[1:06:27] that God keeps good books too he said
[1:06:29] you'll get credit because you sent me
[1:06:30] over there to preach the gospel and
[1:06:32] souls got saved and that will be
[1:06:34] credited to your account for that Soul
[1:06:35] being saved for you given to missions
[1:06:37] and he says God keeps good books too
[1:06:40] can you say Amen so God's the perfect
[1:06:42] accountant every little act will will
[1:06:45] not be forgotten can you say Amen every
[1:06:48] little thing that the whole world didn't
[1:06:49] see but you did somehow some selfish act
[1:06:51] you gave and you did something and God
[1:06:54] is the perfect accountant and how many
[1:06:56] believe God keeps perfect records
[1:07:01] except
[1:07:03] for one thing
[1:07:05] our sin
[1:07:09] this is why he's a perfect accountant
[1:07:11] too
[1:07:13] except for our sin
[1:07:16] in God's Great Quick Books
[1:07:20] perfect QuickBooks God can go over and
[1:07:24] take all the things that we've done
[1:07:26] wrong and click on it and scroll down
[1:07:29] the whole list of our whole life and he
[1:07:32] Scrolls down and Scrolls down he Shades
[1:07:34] it all what do they call that shading it
[1:07:35] or clicking on it he Scrolls down
[1:07:37] Scrolls down Scrolls down
[1:07:40] gets to the very end of all your stuff
[1:07:41] in QuickBooks that you did wrong
[1:07:44] he's got it all blocked shaded and then
[1:07:47] he reaches over
[1:07:48] and he clicks the delete button
[1:07:53] somebody shout praise the Lord
[1:07:56] he clicks delete and you know how that
[1:07:58] happens with you
[1:08:00] even when you accidentally do it it's
[1:08:02] gone
[1:08:04] it's in Oblivion you can't find it and
[1:08:07] all your sin was cast in the sea of
[1:08:09] forgetfulness and God cannot remember it
[1:08:11] no more he deletes it
[1:08:14] he deletes it
[1:08:16] we understand justification just as if
[1:08:19] you never did in the place first place
[1:08:20] God I'm sorry I keep asking apology for
[1:08:23] that God I'm sorry I'm sorry and God's
[1:08:25] looking it up in his QuickBooks and he
[1:08:27] can't find it because he deleted it when
[1:08:28] he went to Calvary he deleted all of it
[1:08:31] he can't find that account Jesus dropped
[1:08:35] the charges can you say Amen
[1:08:38] Jesus dropped the charges and it's all
[1:08:40] gone and so I'm telling you this now to
[1:08:43] to just get it across as I'm closing to
[1:08:46] say in this point here if we're in this
[1:08:48] glory of God and in this Kingdom that it
[1:08:51] is that we don't our God does not keep a
[1:08:54] record of wrong if he says when you're
[1:08:57] praying oh God this sin he says what sin
[1:09:00] it's like he lets you start from scratch
[1:09:02] can you say Amen you're reminding him
[1:09:04] because the devil remind you of
[1:09:06] something back there but it's under the
[1:09:07] blood and he can't remember it can you
[1:09:09] say amen and that is that if something
[1:09:11] new has happened then we ask forgiveness
[1:09:13] but don't attach it to all the past
[1:09:15] things
[1:09:16] because God cannot remember anymore if
[1:09:19] God is this way why don't we have a
[1:09:23] delete button on the things people have
[1:09:25] done wrong to us
[1:09:29] because they didn't apologize
[1:09:33] or you're going to live bound your whole
[1:09:34] life
[1:09:36] because they may not ever apologize
[1:09:41] but you can find the glory of the Lord
[1:09:43] to forgive
[1:09:44] say for me
[1:09:46] that's between them and God
[1:09:48] I'm a free man I'm a free woman my
[1:09:51] forgiveness never gives up
[1:09:55] it's been some questions about
[1:09:58] boundaries with that and there certainly
[1:10:00] are boundaries we don't let someone to
[1:10:03] continue to just abuse us
[1:10:07] but that doesn't have to do with
[1:10:08] forgiveness
[1:10:10] forgiveness is in our heart
[1:10:13] 70 times 7 Jesus says blew the disciples
[1:10:16] mind away or what are you talking about
[1:10:18] 70 times 7 because forgiveness doesn't
[1:10:20] give up we continue to forgive and yet
[1:10:23] there's boundaries sometimes to realize
[1:10:25] that person can't continue to abuse
[1:10:28] but we can continue to forgive
[1:10:33] we're taught so much to keep records and
[1:10:34] look what brother Bram says here love
[1:10:36] covers a multitude of sin I'm bringing
[1:10:38] it down to a close
[1:10:40] if I don't see some of you no more
[1:10:42] remember this that's my theme is love
[1:10:44] covers it all I believe in the redeeming
[1:10:46] love of the Lord Jesus listen just a
[1:10:48] moment I would rather have a church that
[1:10:50] knows nothing about any spiritual gift
[1:10:53] and just to be so in love with each
[1:10:55] other and with Christ I'd rather have
[1:10:57] that than every spiritual gift operating
[1:11:00] in the church
[1:11:05] you see you see my vision
[1:11:09] not at all I want I want the spiritual
[1:11:12] gifts working there but he's showing the
[1:11:13] more excellent way
[1:11:15] I would rather have a church that knows
[1:11:17] nothing about any spiritual gift and
[1:11:19] just be so in love with each other and
[1:11:20] with Christ I'd rather have that than
[1:11:22] every spiritual gift operating in my
[1:11:23] church now that might seem sound hard in
[1:11:28] a Pentecostal group
[1:11:30] interesting
[1:11:32] but I would rather have it
[1:11:34] where there's gifts they'll fail whether
[1:11:37] it's gifts they'll be they'll bring
[1:11:39] confusion where there's gifts they can
[1:11:41] be questioned but where there is love it
[1:11:44] is perfect that's right and if you had
[1:11:46] perfect love you'd have perfect gifts
[1:11:51] that's right so work first with love
[1:11:54] that brings fellowship and fellowship
[1:11:57] brings gifts
[1:12:01] let me say that's powerful
[1:12:03] amen
[1:12:05] I think there's nothing greater than
[1:12:07] love and love if we can't express it now
[1:12:09] we can say that we have love we're just
[1:12:11] saying that but when we can really
[1:12:12] Express what we've said that we have
[1:12:14] then we show it in ourselves and now
[1:12:16] we're not a perfect people we make our
[1:12:18] mistakes we do things that's wrong but
[1:12:20] you see love covers all of that we're
[1:12:24] willing when we see our mistakes to come
[1:12:27] back and apologize to one another yeah
[1:12:29] that's Warriors that is really men and
[1:12:33] women that's Gallant love covers a
[1:12:38] multitude of sins can you say Amen
[1:12:41] praise the Lord and so this glory of God
[1:12:50] moves in man
[1:12:54] and in woman
[1:12:56] and it makes them cover a multitude of
[1:12:58] sins in others
[1:13:00] sons of God under the power of
[1:13:02] redemption and this open book will come
[1:13:06] to levels of forgiveness never seen
[1:13:08] before in men
[1:13:12] I'm making some closing statements here
[1:13:14] and hopefully it'll just it'll seal
[1:13:16] things up how many want more of the love
[1:13:18] of God
[1:13:19] at least more of it manifesting in our
[1:13:21] lives this sons of God under the power
[1:13:24] of redemption and this open book in the
[1:13:26] last days will come to new levels I
[1:13:29] could say new levels of gifts new levels
[1:13:31] of prophesying that's fine I'm not
[1:13:34] saying that I believe this open book
[1:13:36] will bring new levels because we know
[1:13:39] our position as Sons will bring new
[1:13:41] levels of forgiveness never seen before
[1:13:43] in men it makes us Revelations 5 he said
[1:13:48] as they worship makes us Kings and
[1:13:50] Priests how many know the Bible says and
[1:13:53] he hath made us Kings and Priests
[1:13:54] looking in this book of redemption
[1:13:56] that's been opened makes us Kings and
[1:13:59] Priests not just Christians Kings and
[1:14:02] Priests what does that mean that means
[1:14:04] that were as kings in worship we have
[1:14:07] authority as kings
[1:14:09] King means you have authority
[1:14:11] but we also have an understanding of
[1:14:14] Grace to intercede and feel the pain of
[1:14:18] others because that's what a priest does
[1:14:19] he intercedes he feels the pain of
[1:14:22] others because he's been through it
[1:14:24] before so not only we have the authority
[1:14:26] as kings but we have the priesthood to
[1:14:29] understand and give Grace and intercede
[1:14:32] for someone because we know it would
[1:14:34] have a discernment what they're going
[1:14:35] through
[1:14:37] I have one more scripture
[1:14:39] in Hebrews 5 1-4 and I want you to read
[1:14:43] it so touched me this morning as I
[1:14:44] pulled it up Hebrews 5 talking about
[1:14:46] this priesthood for every priest I don't
[1:14:49] know if you guys want to pull it up
[1:14:50] there for every priest Hebrews 5 if you
[1:14:53] give me two minutes I'll be done
[1:14:55] are you getting anything out of this
[1:14:57] this morning
[1:15:00] this is a lot to chew on but we'll take
[1:15:02] it it's Eagle food can you say amen for
[1:15:04] every high priest taken from among men
[1:15:07] is ordained for men in things pertaining
[1:15:09] to god notice how he words that now
[1:15:12] every priest he's talking about Old
[1:15:13] Testament priesthood but every priest
[1:15:15] this is the purpose of a priest every
[1:15:17] priest is taking from among men is
[1:15:20] ordained for men in things pertaining to
[1:15:23] God so he is the goal between between
[1:15:26] God and Men he's taken from men he's
[1:15:30] ordained four men can you say Amen in
[1:15:34] things pertaining to God so horizontally
[1:15:37] it's coming from other men and then
[1:15:40] vertically he has he has a uh he has a
[1:15:44] how should I say it he's got he's
[1:15:45] attached to God or he has access to God
[1:15:48] the priest has access to God to bring
[1:15:50] the right sacrifices and but yet he's
[1:15:52] been in tune with man because he's a man
[1:15:54] himself so he's this in between priests
[1:15:56] and so now he says who he says things
[1:16:00] that pertain to God that he may offer
[1:16:02] both gifts and sacrifices for sins who
[1:16:05] can have compassion on the ignorant and
[1:16:09] on them that are out of the way for that
[1:16:11] he himself also is compassed with
[1:16:13] infirmity this is a great priest can you
[1:16:16] say amen and this priest can have
[1:16:18] compassion on others and on ignorant men
[1:16:21] and those that are out of the way listen
[1:16:23] we come in contact every day with people
[1:16:26] that are out of the way we have people
[1:16:27] in this assembly that are out of the way
[1:16:29] they're they're they're not what they
[1:16:31] should be yet but you see a high priest
[1:16:33] he doesn't judge that he says Lord I'm
[1:16:35] going to get a hold of you I'm going to
[1:16:37] stand because I've been out of the way I
[1:16:39] can understand what it is to be weak and
[1:16:41] not be strong and so I'm going to be a
[1:16:43] faithful high priest here can you say
[1:16:45] Amen this book makes us priests with
[1:16:48] compassion on the ignorant
[1:16:52] see we the world says you're ignorant
[1:16:55] you should know better than that and so
[1:16:57] we get angry at the ignorant but this
[1:16:59] priest says I can understand what a
[1:17:01] person is ignorant of what they're doing
[1:17:03] because I've been there and brother
[1:17:05] Branham came to that at the end of his
[1:17:07] life when he says I had to quit
[1:17:08] criticizing I was saying you rickettas
[1:17:11] and you Ricky's out there and he says
[1:17:13] God corrected me on that my attitude was
[1:17:15] wrong he says some of those are souls
[1:17:17] that would give their hearts to God if
[1:17:19] they only knew the way back to God you
[1:17:23] can't stand there and criticize somebody
[1:17:25] who's never heard truth before
[1:17:29] when you go out there you don't know if
[1:17:31] they've heard the truth she's she's
[1:17:33] bobbed her hair she's wearing britches
[1:17:35] like a man she's got tattoos all of
[1:17:38] herself and so now you put them in hell
[1:17:40] because you can't do that because if
[1:17:43] they haven't heard the truth
[1:17:45] if they don't know the Bible truth on it
[1:17:48] you can't accuse them
[1:17:51] they are ignorant
[1:17:54] and so I can have compassion
[1:17:56] I can stand in the Gap see that's our
[1:17:59] problem in the ranks of the message is
[1:18:02] that predestination becomes prejudiced
[1:18:06] go ahead
[1:18:08] Oh I thought I was done I thought I was
[1:18:11] done preaching but I'm not done here for
[1:18:13] a minute
[1:18:15] our teaching on predestining is the
[1:18:17] greatest teaching that's ever come back
[1:18:18] to the church
[1:18:20] but in some ranks our predestination
[1:18:23] gets so proud that it becomes prejudiced
[1:18:27] that we choose what group everybody is
[1:18:30] in
[1:18:31] serpent seed foolish virgin wise virgin
[1:18:35] no Holy Ghost Holy Ghost and we start to
[1:18:39] choose and we become selective we become
[1:18:42] selective and we become exclusive we
[1:18:46] have a monopoly on the truth
[1:18:49] only those who come from through us
[1:18:54] and we become prejudiced now Prejudice
[1:18:56] is a problem it's in this country people
[1:18:58] still fight against it if you go to a
[1:19:01] junior high you're going to have
[1:19:01] Prejudice they're going to make fun of
[1:19:03] you for you know your ears or whatever's
[1:19:05] you know weird they think you're gonna
[1:19:06] get made fun of prejudice but now we
[1:19:10] shouldn't let Prejudice come in our
[1:19:12] ranks
[1:19:13] that we're actually prejudiced against
[1:19:16] denominational people
[1:19:20] Prejudice means I am in a higher class
[1:19:23] I'm of a better race
[1:19:27] you're below us
[1:19:29] where did we get that out of
[1:19:33] our great teachings
[1:19:38] we don't have a right
[1:19:40] to judge anybody if you don't know
[1:19:42] because if they're ignorant this
[1:19:45] kingship and priesthood comes to the
[1:19:46] place
[1:19:48] it says
[1:19:49] I can have compassion
[1:19:52] on somebody
[1:19:54] who's ignorant
[1:20:01] I can speak the same words from my life
[1:20:03] that Jesus spoke from the father from
[1:20:06] the cross that said this cross he said
[1:20:08] forgive them Father because they're
[1:20:11] ignorant
[1:20:12] they don't know what they're doing right
[1:20:14] now
[1:20:15] so forgiveness didn't hold back and say
[1:20:18] say look at the tragedy they're doing
[1:20:19] they're putting me on a cross but they
[1:20:22] didn't know what they were doing
[1:20:25] right so forgiveness was not held back
[1:20:27] from somebody it was released to those
[1:20:30] people at the cross that were putting
[1:20:31] their Roman soldiers Jews
[1:20:35] everybody standing around the cross the
[1:20:37] most tragic event in history
[1:20:40] and forgiveness was released to those
[1:20:42] people even the other man on the cross
[1:20:44] somebody brought out car somebody
[1:20:46] brought out so wonderful we have all
[1:20:49] their things people need to go through
[1:20:50] before we accept them
[1:20:56] and he just said Lord remember me when I
[1:20:58] cut when you come into your kingdom
[1:21:00] that's all he said didn't get baptized
[1:21:05] and forgiveness was released
[1:21:08] to him
[1:21:10] at that moment
[1:21:12] we don't have a right to withhold
[1:21:14] forgiveness from anybody
[1:21:17] priesthood and Kings is what this book
[1:21:20] of redemption
[1:21:21] oh I've heard ministers that can
[1:21:23] elaborate on the book of redemption and
[1:21:25] the opening of the seals I if you're a
[1:21:28] preacher some of these ministers can
[1:21:29] break it down It's So Glorious and what
[1:21:31] God has done I love it I absolutely love
[1:21:34] it but let me remind you each one if I
[1:21:38] don't see the fruits of it making you a
[1:21:41] king and a priest something's missing in
[1:21:44] what you see in this book of redemption
[1:21:47] if it makes you prejudice
[1:21:50] you got the wrong result
[1:21:53] because that's not the glory of the Lord
[1:22:00] the son of God
[1:22:02] a Son of God has Authority
[1:22:05] to have compassion on the ignorant on
[1:22:07] them that are out of the way for he for
[1:22:09] that he himself also is compassed with
[1:22:10] infirmity and by reason thereof he ought
[1:22:12] ask for the people so also for himself
[1:22:15] to offer for sin and no man taketh this
[1:22:18] honor unto himself you didn't give it to
[1:22:20] yourself
[1:22:21] but he that is called of God as was
[1:22:25] Aaron and I can tell you you are called
[1:22:28] of God as Sons and Daughters of God you
[1:22:31] have a calling from this book and he is
[1:22:34] making us Kings in rulership with the
[1:22:38] authority like a policeman
[1:22:40] but with the compassion to defer your
[1:22:44] anger until you know the whole situation
[1:22:48] and to cover a multitude of sins Sons
[1:22:52] and Daughters of God are holding the
[1:22:53] token
[1:22:54] they're carrying the atonement with them
[1:22:57] and the atonement is forgiveness of sins
[1:23:00] it's a washing away of sins if you're
[1:23:02] carrying the token
[1:23:04] then you can have Graces the prophet
[1:23:06] said in the token message he says he
[1:23:08] said when you go to apply the token how
[1:23:09] many believe in applying the token you
[1:23:11] get this Holy Ghost token it's the
[1:23:13] atonement to wash away the sin in your
[1:23:15] life to clean your home up with all the
[1:23:17] trash he said the dirty magazines the
[1:23:20] dirty television all these other things
[1:23:21] you applied the token and you know for
[1:23:24] years people said apply the token kick
[1:23:26] this out kick out the short skirts kick
[1:23:29] this out apply the Holy Ghost to your
[1:23:30] home like Moses did he applied the blood
[1:23:32] to his house that's what we're doing
[1:23:34] right now apply it before the death
[1:23:36] angel comes these are all real things
[1:23:37] friends you got to get the token you got
[1:23:39] to apply it apply it kick this out kick
[1:23:42] that out and they forgot to read just a
[1:23:45] about a page later when he says now when
[1:23:47] you go to apply it
[1:23:49] apply it with such love
[1:23:55] people forgot to read that part
[1:23:58] because when they went to apply it
[1:24:01] they applied it like a tyrant
[1:24:04] what are you doing honey I'm applying
[1:24:07] that talking around here
[1:24:13] forgot to read just a few pages later
[1:24:15] when he says no when you go to that wife
[1:24:17] and that family and you apply it to your
[1:24:19] family members he said apply it with
[1:24:22] such love that shall see the results
[1:24:28] boy how many homes for the last 60 years
[1:24:31] have applied it the wrong way without
[1:24:34] love
[1:24:36] and the children grow to hate
[1:24:39] the very precious stones and precious
[1:24:42] message
[1:24:45] and token
[1:24:48] because it wasn't they resisted
[1:24:51] the token or the message
[1:24:53] they resisted the way
[1:24:56] it was applied
[1:24:59] can you see my vision as a pastor
[1:25:02] can you see where I'm going
[1:25:04] can you see the pastures that I want you
[1:25:06] all to feed on right now as sheep let's
[1:25:09] stay right here and say Lord deal with
[1:25:11] me
[1:25:12] change me
[1:25:14] burn out the selfishness and pride and
[1:25:18] irritability and impatience and keeping
[1:25:22] records of people's wrongs
[1:25:25] if God has a sea of forgiveness
[1:25:29] why don't you have a sea of
[1:25:32] forgetfulness
[1:25:34] this week create one of your own
[1:25:38] God has one say God I'm going to pray
[1:25:40] now and I'm going to have my own sea of
[1:25:42] forgiveness and I'm going to take the
[1:25:44] record of what I have of people have
[1:25:47] done me wrong and I'm going to take it
[1:25:49] and I'm going to gather it up and then
[1:25:51] this sea of forgiveness I'm going to
[1:25:53] throw this in my sea of forgiveness
[1:25:55] because Lord you had one for me you
[1:25:57] can't even remember my sin anymore
[1:26:00] you kept no record of it
[1:26:03] you can't remember it anymore
