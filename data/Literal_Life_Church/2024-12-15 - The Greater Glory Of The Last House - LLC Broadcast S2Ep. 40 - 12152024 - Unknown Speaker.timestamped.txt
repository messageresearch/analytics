[5:11] for hegi chapter 2 if you would in verse
[5:17] two speak now to excuse me verse three
[5:21] who is left among you that saw this
[5:23] house in her first Glory who is left
[5:26] among you that saw this house in her
[5:28] first Glory and how do you see it now is
[5:31] it not in your eyes in comparison of it
[5:35] as nothing so now the temple was
[5:37] destroyed and there were some there that
[5:40] not just heard about but maybe even were
[5:43] there when the original Glory came into
[5:45] Solomon's Temple and he's asking who
[5:48] among you that are left that were there
[5:50] and who has heard of it and now look at
[5:52] how it's been destroyed and there is no
[5:55] glory in it it has been destroyed and
[5:58] then in this restoration he says yet now
[6:00] be strong o zerubabel sayeth the Lord
[6:03] and be strong o Joshua son of Jo josec
[6:07] the high priest and be strong all ye
[6:10] people of the land sayeth the Lord and
[6:12] work for I Am With You sayith the Lord
[6:14] of hosts according to the word that I
[6:17] covenanted with you uh covenanted with
[6:20] you when you came out of Egypt so my
[6:23] spirit remaineth among you fear ye not
[6:27] isn't it a joy to know that we those
[6:29] that come out of Egypt under a prophet's
[6:31] message and now many years later the
[6:34] Lord's saying I am still with you I will
[6:36] be with you I will be with you in this
[6:38] full restoration I was with you in Egypt
[6:41] I brought you out I was with you in the
[6:43] temple when the glory came down and I'm
[6:45] still with you today notice the prophecy
[6:47] now for thus say the Lord of hosts yet
[6:50] once it is a little while and I will
[6:52] shake the heavens and the earth and the
[6:54] Sea and the dry land and I will shake
[6:56] All Nations and the desire of all
[6:59] Nations shall come and I will fill this
[7:03] house with Glory saith the Lord of hosts
[7:06] all of us that are Bible readers know
[7:08] this is a prophecy literally for Israel
[7:11] as well when the temple is restored to
[7:13] them then God promises that not only
[7:15] will they rebuild it but he said I'll
[7:17] fill it with my glory again but it's not
[7:20] just a prophecy physically it's a
[7:22] spiritual prophecy for the Bride of
[7:24] Jesus Christ I filled it 2,000 years ago
[7:28] with my glory and I'm I'm going to come
[7:30] now and fill it
[7:31] again Hallelujah so he says and it
[7:34] doesn't stop there he says he says I
[7:36] will fill this house with glory sayith
[7:38] the lord the silver is mine and the gold
[7:41] is mine sayeth the Lord of hosts the
[7:43] glory look how it goes further now the
[7:46] glory of this latter house shall be
[7:49] greater than the former
[7:52] glory saith the Lord of hosts and in
[7:55] this place will I give peace saith the
[7:59] Lord of hosts the first house of the
[8:01] Lord was filled with his glory it wasn't
[8:05] just that it was a building but when you
[8:07] read your Bibles you see that that day
[8:10] of dedication it was filled with his
[8:13] glory and then in hegi he says the last
[8:16] house the glory in the last house will
[8:19] be even greater I want to speak on the
[8:22] greater glory of the last house this
[8:25] prophecy can't just apply to the literal
[8:27] Temple for Israel but it must speak of
[8:30] the filling of the true temples that
[8:33] happened on the day of Pentecost when
[8:35] God did just that in human beings and an
[8:39] unexpected moment when they were praying
[8:42] and they were emptying out and they were
[8:44] giving themselves and they knew there
[8:46] was a promise laying there and they
[8:48] talked about it for 10 days and they
[8:50] Fellowship together and then they begin
[8:52] to just pray and empty out and something
[8:54] unique happened that the the Bible said
[8:56] would happen and that is now the true
[8:59] Temple would be filled with the glory of
[9:01] God filled with the Holy Ghost and it
[9:03] was a powerful moment friends until they
[9:06] actually drunk in the spirit and come
[9:08] down and speaking things that were they
[9:10] were glorifying God and every nation was
[9:12] hearing it is in their own language it
[9:15] was a very unique moment of the the
[9:17] glory of God coming and filling the true
[9:20] temples of God they seen it in Jesus
[9:22] Christ they said how could God be fill
[9:25] his glory with so much in a vessel like
[9:27] Jesus Christ but now Jesus was not sin
[9:31] born but now sin born vessels could
[9:34] actually have this Glory living in their
[9:37] temples praise the Lord and so now uh
[9:40] that's when he filled the true House of
[9:42] God the glory of the Lord himself the
[9:46] glory is the beauty of himself the
[9:48] Majesty of himself it's his own life
[9:51] filling on that day 120 Believers in the
[9:54] upper room it was his own character his
[9:56] own Beauty the very uh I hate to said
[9:59] the best of his of himself but because
[10:02] he's all the best but the but the His
[10:04] True Glory was coming in its beauty its
[10:06] majesty and it was not in a church and
[10:09] it was not in in in in in in a scroll it
[10:12] was not in now now that Glory was being
[10:17] filled and put in the temples of the
[10:19] Living God it was being put in people
[10:21] can you say am man something must have
[10:23] happened at Calvary for God to be able
[10:26] to say now there's opened a way that I
[10:28] can do what what I wanted from the
[10:30] beginning and that's I can bring my
[10:32] glory down and fill the human beings
[10:34] fill the Believers
[10:36] [Music]
[10:37] am and let me just say to you and those
[10:40] that are listening on the broadcast If
[10:42] You Preach Christianity any other way or
[10:45] anything less than what I'm saying today
[10:47] you're not preaching the full Council of
[10:50] God because what Christianity really is
[10:53] is God's glory filling the temples of
[10:56] human beings that's what he did that's
[10:58] what he went to Calvary before that's
[11:00] why he gave us his word that's why we
[11:02] have the Old and New Testament that's
[11:04] why we have our Bibles it's not just to
[11:06] say on that the ultimate goal of
[11:08] Christianity is that human beings be
[11:11] filled with the glory of God and if
[11:13] you're not preaching that or anything
[11:15] less than that you're not given the
[11:17] whole counsel because this is what
[11:19] Christianity is all about maybe I need
[11:22] to tell some of you today that you might
[11:24] have Christianity as just some dos and
[11:26] don'ts or some law to live by let me
[11:29] tell you it's not that friends that's
[11:31] religion can you say Amen this has to do
[11:34] with the glory of almighty God coming
[11:37] and descending into your
[11:40] life and if we stop short of that then
[11:44] we just have a religion how is that
[11:46] possible well because of the enemy
[11:48] making it a religion stopping short of
[11:52] the glory of God Bible says all of us
[11:55] have come short of the glory of God
[11:58] remember that scripture yeah all men all
[12:01] of us have sto short well that's a
[12:03] pretty big thing to stop short of
[12:04] because man can be full of religion they
[12:07] can live right they can wear the right
[12:08] clothes do everything to try to to try
[12:11] to do something for God in their own
[12:13] will but the ultimate thing is not that
[12:15] you try to do it on your own but that
[12:17] you don't and that you don't stop short
[12:19] of the glory of God he wants to fill you
[12:22] with his
[12:23] glory and today I'm teaching that it's
[12:26] not just filling you initially but we're
[12:29] to move from glory to glory to glory to
[12:35] glory until it becomes greater in your
[12:37] life that's a you know that's a
[12:40] scripture I'm going to read it in a
[12:41] minute but that's a journey to me that's
[12:42] not an instant moment at the altar that
[12:45] you completely get full of the glory of
[12:47] God your soul does but I can tell you
[12:49] this is a journey going from glory to
[12:51] glory to
[12:53] glory praise the Lord and so now we have
[12:55] to preach true Christianity it was after
[12:58] the early church church and I just say
[13:00] this as well it was after the early
[13:02] church that God filled his temples with
[13:04] the glory that the Antichrist Spirit
[13:06] replaced the glory coming in for a
[13:09] formula or a ritual it was the
[13:11] Antichrist spirit that did that but it's
[13:13] a transforming of You by God's power his
[13:16] life descends upon the individual you
[13:20] are changed don't ever forget this that
[13:23] this is one one of the main
[13:25] characteristics even today in preaching
[13:27] this one of the main charactera
[13:29] characteristics of the glory of God is
[13:31] change we sing the song from glory to
[13:35] glory he's changing me and if there's no
[13:39] change if you're staying then then it's
[13:42] less of the glory of God but when he
[13:45] moves in it's not just that you get a
[13:47] feeling and shout all over the room no
[13:49] no it's change it's changing you it's
[13:51] changing your mind it's changing your
[13:53] heart it's changing the way you thought
[13:55] of things before it's changing all the
[13:58] time this morning morning in the service
[13:59] if you will surrender God can change
[14:02] what you thought of God before he can
[14:04] change you this morning when the glory
[14:06] of God comes it doesn't come just to
[14:08] give us a feeling it comes to change
[14:11] us every time it came in the Bible it
[14:14] came to change
[14:17] things amen the characteristics is to
[14:20] change and it changes everything it
[14:22] never leaves anything the same the glory
[14:25] of God never leaves anything the same
[14:27] there's more glory and when there's more
[14:29] more Glory there's more
[14:31] change and that is why last Sunday in
[14:33] the many Sundays in the past I've
[14:35] labored uh last few Sundays on the
[14:37] subject of our heart when the heart
[14:39] lines up with the word that's in the
[14:41] soul it opens the way for more of the
[14:43] glory of God to come in why is that that
[14:46] our whole vessel can be more filled and
[14:50] not just our
[14:52] souls that our whole
[14:55] vessel could be filled with the glory of
[14:57] God Amen that he could take over our
[15:00] minds that he could take over our bodies
[15:03] that he could take over our
[15:05] will that he could take over every part
[15:08] of us that he could take over our memory
[15:10] you're so bound sometimes by your memory
[15:12] in the past memories that he could take
[15:14] that over and the glory of God could
[15:16] change it and so now then every once in
[15:18] a while when a memory comes back from
[15:19] the past the glory of God refills it and
[15:22] it ditches that past memory and now you
[15:24] only got the memories that God has given
[15:26] you he FS the memory he feels the
[15:28] conscience can you say man he fills your
[15:31] spirit Hallelujah testimonies are
[15:34] happening in the church now from since
[15:36] we've been preaching on the heart the
[15:38] the testimonies are coming in of the
[15:40] hearts becoming Unshackled by the years
[15:43] of things that held them back they were
[15:46] Christians they were Believers but what
[15:47] I've been preaching is yet your heart
[15:49] has to be clean and clear and lined up
[15:52] with what's in your soul and we're
[15:54] hearing testimonies coming in of
[15:56] Unshackled people being Unshackled for
[15:59] years of things what happened they moved
[16:01] to a greater glory they moved to a
[16:04] greater glory more things are opening up
[16:07] to me in this subject and I just like to
[16:09] explore some of it this morning there's
[16:11] a there's a difference here's one thing
[16:13] there's a difference in seeing the
[16:15] manifestation of God's
[16:18] glory and then it filling you we can
[16:23] observe God's glory how many believe we
[16:25] can observe God's glory in nature yeah
[16:28] and but you can do that that the world
[16:29] can do that if they got a little bit of
[16:31] belief in them then they believe and
[16:33] this is the crazy thing people can enjoy
[16:35] the creation and not believe in a
[16:38] Creator try to figure that one
[16:41] out oh what's such a beautiful creation
[16:43] well who created it and His glory was so
[16:47] manifested and we can see it all in the
[16:49] woods and in the mountains and whatever
[16:50] the glory of God you see it in there had
[16:52] to be a Creator to create that and so
[16:54] they look at that glory and they're just
[16:56] kind of AED by it and yet they won't
[16:58] they won't uh uh they enjoy the glory of
[17:02] its
[17:02] manifestation and yet they don't seek
[17:05] the god of that glory for what his
[17:08] purpose
[17:09] was his his his Bibles he wrote the
[17:11] first Bible in the heavens the the the
[17:14] constellation the beauty the Stars we
[17:16] see God's glory in it and we see God's
[17:19] uh his Supernatural power in it it had
[17:22] to be a Creator to create it and we can
[17:24] observe listen now we can observe the
[17:27] glory of God but not seek to be filled
[17:30] with it there's this there's this funny
[17:32] little story joke I don't mean to tell
[17:33] jokes but there's an atheist out in the
[17:35] woods and enjoying the woods he didn't
[17:37] believe in God and so comes Upon A bear
[17:40] and the bear starts chasing him and he's
[17:42] running for his life I'm telling you and
[17:44] finally the bear caught up with him and
[17:46] he got down and the bear was right on
[17:48] top of him just about ready to devour
[17:49] him and the guy The Atheist cries out to
[17:52] God God save me from this save me God
[17:55] responds and says hey you know what you
[17:57] haven't served me your whole life you
[17:59] haven't repented you haven't asked me to
[18:01] come into your heart at all and now at
[18:03] this moment where you're getting ready
[18:04] to get devoured by the spirit now you
[18:06] call out to me you don't believe in me
[18:08] remember he said I know I know I know
[18:10] and God says would you give me your
[18:12] heart no no no I I don't think I'm going
[18:15] to become a Christian but look could I
[18:17] just ask for this could you make the
[18:19] bear a
[18:21] Christian at this moment can you change
[18:25] it they don't want God's glory fors but
[18:28] they want want to see it in
[18:30] nature they want to see God move in
[18:34] their situations that are getting ready
[18:36] to die come on now can I preach a little
[18:38] bit people only want the glory of God
[18:41] when they're in an emergency people only
[18:43] want the glory of God when they're
[18:45] having somebody die God I need you right
[18:47] now and they never address God in other
[18:49] areas of their life I don't care what
[18:51] God says about what I wear I don't care
[18:53] what God says about what I do every day
[18:55] I don't care about all that but in this
[18:57] moment of an emergency see I really need
[18:59] his glory to come down
[19:02] right and in a moment's time God changed
[19:05] the bear to a Christian and the bear got
[19:07] off the side of the man he he put his
[19:09] paws together to pray he said Lord I
[19:11] Thank you you've made me a Christian and
[19:13] now I pray you'll bless this meal that
[19:15] you've given me to
[19:16] [Laughter]
[19:19] eat that's the end of the
[19:22] story and of course not a true story but
[19:25] I'm using it to show the example people
[19:27] they don't want to come to to all the
[19:29] glory of God they just want to pick and
[19:31] choose like a buffet can you say Amen
[19:35] this is not a buffet that you pick and
[19:36] choose of the message what you want God
[19:39] wants surrender Hearts to say I take all
[19:41] of this word into my life because when I
[19:44] take all of the word his glory will fill
[19:47] my life more for more of his glory more
[19:50] of his power more of his love you can
[19:54] cap out if you want to because a lot of
[19:56] times people do because they want to
[19:58] pick and choose choose we shouldn't pick
[20:00] and choose like that can I get an amen
[20:01] this morning there there's there's more
[20:03] glory in here there's more of you
[20:05] there's more of God for you it's moving
[20:07] on but we can hold him back and our
[20:09] hearts being restricted because we said
[20:12] we we we we we don't want to identify
[20:14] him and come closer to him and say Lord
[20:17] some of these things that I have in my
[20:19] life you want to get in that too and
[20:20] fill it with your glory there's a
[20:22] scripture in numbers and this brings
[20:24] this example numbers 14:22 says I'm
[20:27] moving along now because all those men
[20:30] which have seen my glory and my Miracles
[20:33] this is in the Old Testament with Moses
[20:36] all those men which have seen my glory
[20:38] and my Miracles which I did in Egypt and
[20:41] in the wilderness and have tempted me
[20:44] now these 10 times and have not
[20:46] hearkened unto my voice now we have a
[20:49] whole generation that come out under a
[20:51] prophet two million of them they come
[20:53] out and God says you've seen my glory
[20:56] you've seen my miracles you you you you
[20:59] you've you've come out of Egypt by a
[21:01] mighty hand now you've been in the
[21:03] wilderness you've seen my glory and my
[21:06] Miracles but they observe it I'm just
[21:08] going to say now and look what his glory
[21:10] was his glory was in the cloud his glory
[21:13] was in the pillar of fire these were
[21:15] signs in the Heaven A Cloud by day a
[21:18] pillar of Fire by Night a sign in the
[21:20] heavens I'm not anchored to the sign but
[21:23] God sent a sign and that was his glory
[21:26] in that and in in Egypt when they look
[21:28] in Egypt and also in the wilderness when
[21:30] they looked up and seen a cloud a cloud
[21:32] that was leading them and a pillar of
[21:34] Fire by Night the glory of God was in
[21:36] that but seeing that Glory did not
[21:41] change their hearts just because they
[21:44] seen the cloud and the pillar of Fire
[21:48] doesn't mean their hearts have been
[21:50] changed because when he sends that glory
[21:54] and he gives a sign of it and he shows
[21:56] it around the world he does it because
[21:59] he's headed somewhere and he's headed to
[22:01] fill his temples with more of his glory
[22:04] and he said you have seen my glory and
[22:06] my Miracles but seeing all that Glory
[22:08] did not change them they stayed the same
[22:11] for 40 years they did not mature at all
[22:14] into more of God's glory just because
[22:18] they seen that glory and then later now
[22:20] notice now I'm taking you along later on
[22:23] the glory of the Lord came when the word
[22:26] came to Moses on the mountain the Ten
[22:28] Commandments and the glory of the Lord
[22:31] came and it came in just a little
[22:32] greater way because when the mount when
[22:35] the they carved the Ten Commandments in
[22:37] the mountain and Moses brings it down
[22:39] and I don't know how many days he was up
[22:41] there and the people were waiting for
[22:42] him but you see now this is God's
[22:44] Prophet bringing the word to his people
[22:47] such a significant thing and there was
[22:49] so much glory in God bringing his word
[22:52] to his people that now we see just a
[22:55] little window of what it would do
[22:57] because what happened was is when he
[22:59] came out of the mountain in that
[23:02] presence with the word coming to the
[23:04] people because my uh I I must just say
[23:06] this all all the glories of God come out
[23:11] of his
[23:12] word that's true it's when we're
[23:14] becoming one with this word and in the
[23:16] word let me just say in the word do you
[23:18] read your Bibles do you listen to it if
[23:22] you if you're not then listen you're not
[23:25] interested in more of the glory of God
[23:27] all the glories come out of his word and
[23:30] so now here's one little window that
[23:32] shows us the change now because he's
[23:34] been in nature he's he's uh given them
[23:38] water when they need water he's done all
[23:39] these things you understand all the
[23:40] Miracles in the waters he's created
[23:42] flies and the creative Powers working
[23:44] what great Glory was working on moses'
[23:46] lips what kind of power and Glory was
[23:49] this but now after all that Glory they
[23:52] seen it didn't come to them and so now
[23:53] when he comes from the mountain with
[23:56] this word coming from the mountain there
[23:58] was so much Glory over Moses and his
[24:01] vessel that they had to Veil Moses face
[24:05] because it what did it do it
[24:08] changed his
[24:10] countenance and the glory of the Lord so
[24:13] filled him now this is not the temple
[24:16] this is not the Tabernacle yet this is
[24:19] foretelling of this Glory coming on a
[24:22] human being now I always make the point
[24:25] the glory of the Lord could not come in
[24:27] the so level of Moses or anyone yet it
[24:30] could not come in the soul level because
[24:33] Calvary couldn't come
[24:35] yet so it could not change the desire
[24:39] from a serpent nature to God's nature it
[24:42] didn't it couldn't get there because he
[24:44] hadn't went to Calvary yet to to die for
[24:47] our sins and take care of the sin
[24:49] problem but I can tell you now that the
[24:52] sin problem was taken care of after
[24:54] Calvary Now That Glory now it could come
[24:57] to a soul level amen but look at it so
[25:01] powerful that he had to Veil his face
[25:03] they couldn't even look at his face
[25:05] there was so much Glory upon him yes sir
[25:08] it so changed his countenance and it
[25:11] just speaks of this Glory with a power
[25:15] to change things that you don't think
[25:17] can be
[25:18] changed to change you to change and uh
[25:23] here is his countenance changed so much
[25:26] and it was when the word came came and
[25:29] it starts to have the glory in it that
[25:31] can change men change not the soul yet
[25:34] but can begin to change men not just
[25:37] their countenance so go with me to 2
[25:40] Corinthians 3 and we'll take this to the
[25:42] next step but if the ministration of
[25:44] death written and engraven in Stones
[25:46] that's Moses was glorious so that the
[25:50] children of Israel could not steadfastly
[25:52] behold the face of Moses for the glory
[25:56] of his countenance which Glory was to be
[25:59] done away and so he goes on to say how
[26:01] shall the not the ministration of the
[26:03] spirit be rather glorious for the
[26:05] ministration of condemnation if the
[26:08] ministration of condemnation be glory
[26:10] and condemnation is the law without the
[26:12] spirit is condemnation it tells you what
[26:14] you did wrong but and it stops there so
[26:16] it's condemnation and there was still
[26:18] glory in it much more do the
[26:20] ministration of the righteousness exceed
[26:23] in glory for even that which was made
[26:26] glorious had no glory in this Respect by
[26:30] reason of the glory that excelth the
[26:33] glory that excelth for if that which is
[26:36] done away was glorious much more that
[26:39] which remaineth is glorious seeing then
[26:42] that we have such hope we use great
[26:45] plainness of speech in other words
[26:47] there's an openness to this there's a
[26:50] there's a transparency to this I'm not
[26:53] holding anything back Paul says under
[26:56] this Glory nothing's hidden from us and
[26:58] so we just say it plainly we speak the
[27:01] word plainly and not Moses which put a
[27:04] veil over his face that the children of
[27:07] Israel could not steadfastly look at the
[27:09] end of that which is
[27:11] abolished look what he says here in
[27:13] verse 14 but their minds which uh their
[27:16] minds were blinded for until this day
[27:20] remaineth the same Veil untaken away in
[27:23] the reading of the Old Testament which
[27:24] Veil is done away in Christ but even
[27:28] unto this day when Moses has read the
[27:30] veil is upon where where their heart
[27:34] nevertheless when it shall turn to the
[27:37] Lord the veil shall be taken away it's
[27:40] just that
[27:41] simple you need to turn to the Lord and
[27:45] then you'll read your Bible right now
[27:47] the Lord is that spirit and where the
[27:48] spirit of the Lord is there's liberty
[27:50] but we all with open face beholding as
[27:52] in the glass the glory of the Lord are
[27:53] changed into the same image from say it
[27:56] with me Glory to Glory even as by the
[28:01] spirit of God how is this happening
