========================================

romans chapter 6 i'm sorry open up to romans chapter 8 first romans 8 26 you can keep your bible handy tonight we'll just read a set of scriptures and then let you be seated and then just like to go through romans a little bit together and if you would keep me in prayer next week i've got a little sinus surgery that they're gonna do to um i kind of laugh because as big as my nose is um i don't breathe too well out of it so they're gonna go in and try to help that so just pray for me and and uh i i don't plan on staying away i will have to miss a couple services there at the beginning but um they tell me i look like i got busted in the face so if you see me just question tiff romans 8 26 it says likewise the spirit also help helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of god and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and them who he justified them he also glorified lord bless his word tonight you can be seated and if you want to turn back to uh chapter six i'm going to skip around a little bit but um something that just caught my attention here in the scripture was was how much the just kind of in that thought i get so impressed and and it's just so overwhelming to think about how much the lord loves you and i and and the fact that he would leave glory and come down to have fellowship with us and to and to go to the cross for for you and me to endure that pain and that suffering and and all all all for me and for you and and you know if we think about our lives we think how poorly we've treated him in response to that um but he knew that we would be sinners he knew that that would be that way and so it wasn't just enough to go to the cross and die for us but he wanted to send his spirit and here in romans chapter 8 he's talking about it's he says the spirit helps our infirmities it's the spirit that makes intercession for the saints it's the spirit that does these things it's the spirit it's the spirit and so i want you to catch that as we go tonight but just stepping back a little bit if you want to sometime read romans 6 7 and 8 i just think it's a real good thing but you know especially for the young ones if they're considering baptism young or old if you haven't ever been baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ um read chapter 6 verse 1 through 11. it's a good it's a good uh picture of what water baptism signifies in in the believer's life and and i just think it's real good talking about you know how we we die to sin how christ died for us and we rise again in newness of life and you know i always say he got the short end of the stick really um but i guess to him he got the better end because he got us so amen so let's just pick it up in verse 12. and paul writes here let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lust thereof neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin but yield yourself unto god as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instrument of righteousness unto god so paul's actually saying you have a part to play in this and it's just simply who you yield to what do you yield yourself to what are you what are you allowing yourself to partake in god god made these bodies brother paul was saying it on sunday god god is is the absolute principle theme of the scripture so he should be the principal theme of our life and and the scripture talks about everything was made by him and for him and if we were made by him and for him to me just common sense would say we should be giving ourselves back to him yield yourself yield your vessel and and you know oftentimes you know it's it's we make yielding a lot more difficult than what it is yielding is just giving giving over what are yourself what are you giving yourself to that's it's just that simple and we can complicate it and we can make it as as you know all kinds of things but it's just what are you giving yourself to for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but you're under grace what then shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace god forbid the prophet said one time he said if you could be given a chance to have one night and just go out and do whatever you want and it wouldn't be held to your account he said if you say i will i would go out and i would tear up the town he said you got the wrong spirit even if you had the absolute freedom to go and do whatever you want to do and that thing would not be held against you in the eyes of god i would still want to live for him amen and that should be the desire in the believer's heart because when you realize what god did for you it's it's all you can do to give back to him the best you can we fail absolutely we absolutely fail we're in these bodies of flesh we're going to find this out here as we read but god forbid know ye not that to whom you yield yourself servant to obey his servant ye are to whom ye obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness so if you want to know are you of god who are you who are you yielding your vessel to who are you choosing to obey amen so let's jump ahead here to chapter seven and verse seven and like i said i'm gonna be skipping around so just just hang with me i'm hoping after that surgery i don't sound so nasally when i talk too what shall we say then is the law sin god forbid nay i had not known sin but by the law for i had not known lust except the law had said thou shalt not covet but sin taking occasion by the commandment rotten me all manner of concupit concupiscence however you say that basically it means lust for without the law sin was dead now let's go to verse 11. we're just laying a foundation here for sin taking occasion by the commandment deceived me and by it slew me so sin will actually take what's right and use it against you it'll cause you to sin so all through romans 6 and 7 here paul's paul's laying out basically to me as i read it it was it was a war within himself and he writes how knowing the law brought that war and i believe that the war is present with us today this this war doesn't change it actually at some point in our lives i feel like each of us have this war within us different seasons of our lives with and without the holy ghost this war is is is ever present with us because we're bodies of flesh so paul is actually saying there was no knowledge of sin without the law so before the law he actually says there was basically he says there was no sin because there was no mind of sin there was there was nothing to say hey this is sinful there's nothing to say hey this is right and this is wrong it was just i i just love what what that that revelation that brother paul brought on sunday that you know adam and eve didn't need to know right and wrong that was all in god and that took care of it all but then man wanted a part to play and so god gave us the law and then comes the the the sin the the good and evil so before that there was no knowledge of it which is why the law is what condemns us to death and yet exposes sin as the death-causing life-ruining attribute of the devil that it is so it's almost like a double-edged sword to it you know there's there's it seems like well there's a good side to the law and then it seems like well there's a bad side to the law so you know really you know you could in your mind say well then let's do away with the law well that's not the right answer either you get in trouble paul writes that the law has no power in and of itself and is what makes us miserable when we know it by letter but without the spirit so many sit in churches for years including message churches i had even messaged churches and i thought i'm not trying to sound snobby you know we're not well even message churches no any church doesn't matter who you are you're sin born flesh i don't care what church you sit in i don't care what the name is on the door i don't care what preach what's preached in that church your sin born flesh so we can sit in the churches and and often times as young people we do we sit in church we hear the word we hear the the pure revealed word of the hour and we sit there and and it makes us miserable because we're hearing the word and you start you start hearing the things it's it's it's just a letter that contends and tells you what you can't do you shouldn't do the things you're doing and you should be doing the things you're not doing and when you're when you're living in that state that state and you're sitting there in that state you're just you're of men most miserable because you haven't yet received the holy ghost his spirit to live it out through you so it's this constant war within yourself that within ourselves that you know it's it's just you want to do right but you find yourself doing wrong and and that's going to continue but when you get the holy ghost it gives you the power to live it and it gives you it gives you understanding of all these things it it's not easy but it makes more sense amen when you have just the law just the letter of the law it's it's just the the blood of bulls and goats and it it could never actually take away that guilt of sin and so you have that hunger and you have that desire for sin and to to do the things that you ought not to do and and often times you're yielding your vessel to it but when you get the holy ghost it says no it's it's not the letter that's saying it's wrong it's the spirit of god that's saying it's wrong and it's it's the spirit of god that'll say hey don't go there don't do that don't touch that thing because that's gonna burn you that's gonna hurt you the difference between the two groups is the people you know you you you'll sit there and you'll watch and you'll you'll hear testimonies of people living a victorious life and and sometimes as you sit there you're god's dealing with your heart and you're desiring that victory that victory you you want to see that victory in your life and what's the difference it's the spirit of god it's the spirit of christ you know it's i was thinking uh i i was thinking about just a visual of this you know don't don't touch that and what that is and we built some uh flower boxes at the house and the neighbor has a horse and and uh i i'll just step out from behind the pulpit i hope it's okay to say poop but we went over and we got the got the horse manure and we we brought it back and you know you can't say manure to the kids because they don't quite understand that so you know joey's right there and he's helping me and and i'm shoveling it out and things and one just kind of rolls off to the side and joey's looking at it and i said don't touch that son and he's looking at it i said joey don't that's yucky don't touch it you know and he looks at it and he says that's the poop and i said yeah that's that's the poop don't touch it and so he bends down like this i said joey don't touch that that's yucky he's looking at it he's looking at me and i turn my back for two seconds and i turn around and what's joey doing he said joey now you gotta go wash your hands but it's you know it's it's like the holy spirit does for us he says that's that's don't touch that don't pick that up don't touch that that buddy that that stove it's hot don't touch the hot stove you're gonna get burned and it it's like it's like the poo you gotta touch it you got to find out for yourself and then you get burned but you know we we take that as a as a child but you know we all we've all done it we all do it you know that that warning that it's such a sweet warning of the holy spirit that says don't go there don't do that you know and it's and it's like and i've said this before here so i don't mean to sound like a broken record but you know i've had it in my life when when even before temptation comes the holy spirit's there to warn you and you know so you're sitting there and all of a sudden something feels different and you think you know you just make sure your your spiritual senses start tingling you know and and then all of a sudden the temptation hits and ah okay so now i know what that was the holy spirit was warning me that this was coming you know really it's it's kind of cheating it's like it's like giving you the the answer to the question before the question comes right the holy spirit does that for us oh how he loves us amen but this is but this is what the devil does is he he entices and he tempts you until you sin and then he'll he'll use the word of god and he'll condemn you to hell by it so he's the one telling you do this do this do this putting that temptation on you and then you do it and then he's right there to say oh buddy you know you're going to go to church tomorrow you just did that last night and you're going to go to church you're going to sit there and try to worship and and pray you're going to pray to god and god's the one saying that he said ask confess it and i'm faithful and just to forgive you it's he's given us all the answers already he's he he set this up so beautifully that you have to win he's so determined and that and that's why he sent his spirit it wasn't good enough just to have the law but he sends the spirit of the law so that we can live it and you know as i said we don't do away with the law just well just forget it then that's not the answer if i go as far as i can away from it i'll feel better but that's not it that's not the right approach paul actually goes on to say that the law is good because like we said you wouldn't know that that was wrong unless there was the law so i don't want to keep beating this but hopefully i'm laying the foundation the problem of it lies in the old sinful nature so paul paul writes about this and he gives us a key and verse chapter 7 verse 14. you got your bibles with you all right we're gonna we're gonna be turning looking at him quite a bit why is there such a battle in ourselves what is it paul writes for we know that the law is spiritual but i am carnal sold under sin born in sin shaped in iniquity we come into the world speaking lies you were you were sold into sin adam gave up his rights that's the fault came through adam and eve and that was that was selling the birthright so to speak so now we we know that the law is actually spiritual but we're the problem it's not the law paul says we're the problem it's this old sinful carnal nature verse 16 if then i do that which i would not i consent unto the law that it is good so the war within me paul says is caused by the law and sin proves the word is good and right because i want to do good yet i find myself doing the things i hate it was the word that showed me i was doing wrong to begin with verse 18 for i know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me and how to perform that which is good i find not paul says i'm no good and guess what if paul was no good you're no good either i know i'm not good so maybe if some of you don't know you're no good just let the preacher tell you tonight you're no good we're no good i'm no good there's nothing good within me in and of myself i want to do right but i just can't find the know-how to do it right and it's and it just it's this war you can see how it just it tears us up sometimes amen anyone else been there anyone else been there even with the holy ghost amen now we come to an important separation here though and why we shouldn't walk away from the word because of this war we feel let's read uh verse 20 to the end chapter 7 verse 20. now if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me paul just separated it for us yeah you're carnal yeah the law is requiring this of us but paul paul says but i'm desiring to do good i i want to live the word of god i want to live this thing i want this ex i want jesus christ expressed through my life and even as much as i fail and as much as i'm just oh he says oh wretched man that i am he he he draws a line in the sand here if if that's in your heart then it's not you that does it it's the sin that dwells in you 21 i find then a law that when i would do good evil is present with me for i delight in the law of god after the inward man it's that inward but i see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death but then watch as he as as our picture changes from from a war and what feels like defeat within us to victory i thank god through jesus christ our lord so then that with with the mind i find uh i'm sorry so then with the mind i myself serve the law of god but with the flesh the law of sin there's these two laws working within you the law of god the law of the spirit and the law of sin and death they're ever present with you brother branham said it's a cockleburn nature and it's with you until we get out of here until this body changes amen but i just love that it's not me doing the wrong anymore it's the sin that i'm stuck with in this flesh and god has grace for that like we said is that law to sin absolutely not is it law to yield your vessel to whatever you whatever you want whatever you desire absolutely not we shouldn't make grace a disgrace amen we shouldn't trample over the blood of jesus christ we we should use it to war amen use the blood of jesus christ to war so let's go to chapter eight now and watch how beautiful this is this this is just this is i i know i keep saying this but it's just it's a beautiful setup there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit no condemnation how because the desire on the inside is to do right to do the will of god by living out the word of god our opening scripture said he that searches the heart if he searches the heart then he sees the desires to do right according to his word and that's what he's looking at it's like it's like he just says i have an understanding i understand what you're going through but i'm i'm not going to look at that i'm going to look at this i'm going to look at your desire blessed are they who hunger and thirst for they shall be filled what's a thirst it's a desire the young people laughed at me because one time i was talking about courtship and things and i said you know you get a young girl or a young guy and and you know they're thirsting for something they're thirsting for a mate and they all just thought that was hilarious because thirsting after a man or a woman it just sounds funny so it's a desire verse 2 for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death so these laws are warring within us and yet there's a law in jesus christ that jesus brought by going to the cross by dying on the cross and giving his spirit back to us that really i want to say it overrides the law of sin and death does that override your will no it doesn't it gives you power to override the law of sin it gives you power to override the temptation in your life amen it gives us victory so verse 3 for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh god took care of it that's how we're victorious that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit so this is this is what grabbed my attention when i was reading the scriptures are you okay with a bible study tonight is this this term that paul keeps using of walking after the spirit he he keeps saying it walk after the spirit walk after the spirit don't walk after the flesh you know it's i need to come up with a better example i can't say poo during the whole sermon but but it's like it's it's like the it's like the horse manure you know quit you know joey quit walking towards the manure walk away from it get get you know what that's it's sin it's it's the flesh it's like manure right i mean that's what it is you know sin is just it's it's an abomination before the lord it's it's the stink it's it's just that putrifying smell that takes your breath away that's what sin is like so quit walking towards it you say i'm i'm tired of living this way well stop walking towards that walk the other way instead of going to this you know when when the temptation comes stop going towards it go the opposite direction change change your focus change your atmosphere that you're in change the scenery i love what brother boaz said take it to a different dimension go fight on your ground not the devil's ground when you when you walk towards the manure pile you're on satan's ground amen walk towards god so the law was still only dealing with the flesh we needed something to go deeper into the soul where the nature of sin was and deal with that nature the law of the spirit of life that was in christ jesus christ gives us overcoming prevailing power against the law of sin and death so paul keeps emphasizing this walk after the spirit so let's read 15 we're going to read a little read on through here excuse me for they that are after the flesh do mine the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit it's exactly what we're saying when you walk after when you walk towards that temptation you're minding that temptation you're being obedient to it you're giving yourself to it but he says walk after the spirit when you're when you're not i'm not talking about you know that that saying you're so heavenly minded you're no earthly good i'm not talking about something like that but i'm talking about an overcoming prevailing power walk after the spirit you know think on the scripture get into the word you know do those things that you know to do it's it's it's not as complicated as we make it amen usually when we make it complicated it's because we're wanting to go play in the manure right this is a terrible sermon for to be carnally minded is death this is why to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace so we got this war that's within us and paul is saying are you tired of warring you want peace you want life then walk after the spirit because the carnal mind is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god you want to please god but we get into the flesh and and listen i i don't wan i'm not preaching uh absolute perfection here okay we repent we make it right we get it under the blood and we go on we go on to the spirit the spirit's over here we go on walking after the spirit amen but you know i thought of this today too sometimes we give ourselves permission to get into the flesh well they treated me wrong so i'm going to fly off the handle at them i'm justified by it bless god because they treated me bad well this just says that when you walk after the flesh you're not pleasing god so you know i think as much as it ah you know you fight against it i think anyone would admit when you get in the flesh okay yeah i got in the flesh right and that's not pleasing to god but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his so how do you get into the body of christ you're baptized into it i'm not talking about water baptism but baptism of the spirit amen but don't throw out water baptism now see you gotta you gotta bring the balance on these things because if someone's struggling with it they'll say oh well preacher gave me permission no i'm not giving you permission repent and be baptized every one of you for remission of sin and ye shall be filled with the holy ghost verse 10 and if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised of jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal body by his spirit that dwelleth in you therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if ye live after the flesh he shall die but if he through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live see i want to go to verse 17. for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear there's no bondage in jesus christ and you know go out go away and say this was bondage but that's because you were still living after the law of the flesh you wanted the things of the flesh and so that war was in you and so that's why you fell in bondage and that's why you feel free out there you get the spirit and you realize that this is freedom amen but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god i love the scripture because when the minister is preaching regardless of how sinful you feel your heart something that the minister is saying is connecting with your heart it's resonating on the inside that this is truth this is how i want to live this is how i want to be right here he says the spirit itself bears witness that's the spirit bearing witness that you are jesus christ you belong to him you might not be where you want to be you might not be living like like the next brother sitting next to you yet but we're all at different stages we're all growing into maturity amen so keep keep walking after the spirit attend to the things of the spirit because as you attend to it as you as you feed on the things that are spiritual you gain spiritual strength you start growing in the spirit amen and if children then heirs did i miss 16 the spirit itself beareth witness okay that we are the children of god and if children then heirs heirs of god joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together your your that that spirit that's connecting with your spirit the spirit of god that's you it it opens you up it's saying you have availability to everything that jesus christ had you have availability to the power that he had to the authority that he had as brother paul's been preaching you have authority you have complete the the checkbook is is blank it's signed and the funds are in the bank all you have to do is write out the check that's it you have access to everything that jesus christ had access for so i started to go into this a little bit more walking after the spirit and i realized you know it was really all preached on sunday so i'm going to say insert sunday sermon here so go back and catch it if you didn't or if you just want to hear a good sermon again amen because it's it's coming under the headship of of the word coming under that headship of the spirit is what he was talking about amen and that's that's it's it's walking after the spirit it's doing the things that that turn you towards the spirit but i just thought of a little bit of a picture here walking after the spirit is about how you position yourself what direction you place the opening of your tent and i'm going to change that to say the opening of your senses not just not just these but your mind your imagination what what direction are you pitching your senses towards lot pitched his tent to the door so that the door opened towards sodom and gomorrah so when abraham and lot split up there was war between them right one was carnal one was spiritual so they had to divide they had to split let's not war between us abraham said lot you go choose what direction you want to go and i'll take the other one and lot said well i want to go down towards sodom and gomorrah and it wasn't just that he went down this is the manure pile it just wasn't that he went down and he he put his tent there but he actually said it so that the opening of it was facing the city so you can imagine that every morning when lot got up and his wife got up and they went out on the porch of the tent to have their coffee what did they walk out and see first thing in the morning with sodom and gomorrah it was the direction that all their senses it wasn't just the tent door it was all their senses were opening up to that first thing in the morning abraham on the other hand pitched his tent in the direction that god was going to come amen he pitched his tent think about this so i need i need more stage abraham pitched his tent so that the opening was the direction that god was going to come walking because if you remember the scripture when he stepped out and he was drinking coffee in the morning in the door of his tent it was from that direction that he was facing that god actually was walking towards him amen lot with the direction that his tent was facing wouldn't have known that the destruction was coming because it was coming from behind him he was facing the manure pile and being drawn towards the flesh being drawn towards the the law of the flesh the things that would would cause the fleshly desires to be enticed he was facing it but what he didn't realize is the same direction that abraham's tent was facing god was coming from this direction and yet that's the same direction that destruction was coming from so we really it's it's it's i want you to take away tonight that it's very important what direction you're pitching your tent what direction you're allowing your senses what are you feeding on what are you allowing yourself to intake first thing in the morning when you when you get out of bed and you get out of your tent and you go to drink your coffee what are you looking at amen what's your mind going to what are you what are you watching what are you listening to what are you allowing your thoughts to dwell on i don't know about you but i thought that was really good abraham pitched his tent the direction god was going to come sometimes it's just as simple as putting a filter on your phone well that's childish brother a man quit acting like a boy right quit acting like a boy put the filter on your phone if you need a filter give somebody access to go through your phone if you're struggling put it put the filter on the tablet or the computer maybe maybe it's as simple as deleting an app or deleting the game or throwing away the book or the magazine or the cds or the movies say well boy all those are on my phone nowadays i ain't throwing that away we'll get rid of them get rid of them it's it's it's that simple you're you're setting yourself up for failure every day if you leave it there maybe it's deleting accounts or it's unsubscribing you know you can block websites from your internet browser you can do that and i know that you can go in and shut them off too but it it might make you think twice right maybe if you're if you turned your direction towards the things of god you'd see jesus christ running after you you'd see him wanting to fill you with your spirit more than even you want it you know i think of the prodigal son it wasn't just that the father saw him afar off and he started walking to him it was the father was you know girding up the loins and taking off he was he was high tailing it to the sun and if we just turn our focus to that direction we would realize that christ that's what we're talking about tonight that's what i'm trying to that's that's the beauty that i keep saying if i could just i just see it as a beautiful picture of god dropping everything that he had everything that he could call glorious and that made him god from the very beginning he dropped it all to run after you and i and if you just turn your focus to god you'd see him running after you you know you're you're going this way you're running hightailing it towards the floodings of the flesh but you you if you just look over your shoulder at least you'd see jesus christ running after you trying to catch you trying to pull you back and say no no no there's something better over here it's a lot less stinky over there so let's open up go to james 1 and verse 5. because i want to make this as simple as i believe that it is if i can find james james 1 and verse 5 if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of god that giveth to all men say it with me liberally and abradeth not and it shall be given him you have need of something in your life you want the spirit of god you want more of the spirit of god ask him because this says he gives it liberally not not just not just you know i ain't got nothing to give you gideon here [Laughter] it's not just here gideon you're gideon god says no you're gideon spend all you want won't get you too far but you can spend all you want but with god it'll take you far it'll take you it'll just ask him and he gives it liberally gives you liberally the spirit he's wanting to give it to you more than you want it brother paul said sunday he said we bring our lives under the word position yourself to receive it it's as simple as reading your bible and praying don't make that listen that's not a law men men can take that and make it a law that oh my goodness i gotta i gotta read i gotta read the whole book of james today and tomorrow it's gotta be the book of matthew and and the next day and the next day what if it's one scripture just take one scripture and ponder on it amen just it's it's not complicated just read your bible and pray and you say well why do i got to do that well if i wrote you a letter or i sent someone to tell you a secret that would change your life i gave gideon my wallet and i said get in there's only so much on that card but i'm going to i'm going to send you a secret and i write it down on a piece of paper that there's a million dollars that he can deposit into the same account that that card draws from and i give him the piece of paper if gideon stuffed that in his pocket and he never read it it'd do him no good if i wrote you a letter that would change your life or if i sent a messenger to give you a message and tell you this very secret you would have to listen to that messenger or read that letter in order to get the benefit of what i was telling you amen so it's not a law there's a benefit in doing it just get into it just ask him just talk to him just just love him and accept his love for you amen we're almost done let's go to galatians 5. there's a glare on the clock back there so i really can't tell what time it is so we'll just keep going oh why can't i find it here we go galatians 5 verse 16. read to 18 this i say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh paul just makes this easier and easier you don't want if you want to get away from the law of the flesh walk in the spirit for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that ye cannot do the things that you would but if you be led of the spirit ye are not under the law how beautiful let's skip to 24. and they that are christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit so you can say you live in the spirit all you want but if you live in the spirit really live in it you walk in the spirit every day amen you got those quotes up there just a couple of quotes i'm coming down to a close did you have you gotten something out of tonight amen i'm just gonna start reading and you catch me if you can did you say what all right i'm just going to start reading now to restore back his kinship to bring back now he had to let them get lost you understand it he had to let them sin put them on free moral now i had a jehovah witness one time come to the house and normally i try to avoid him but i thought i'm going to step out and talk to him this time i just curious and so they they somehow we got on the fall and i can't remember exactly what i said but they gasped and they said you mean to tell me that you believe god knew that they would fall god wouldn't do that and he can't be god and i'm thinking if god didn't know that they would do that he's not god right i mean if he's god he's got to know it but but watch us now so don't don't let this stumble you that that god had to let them get lost but watch how he did it he had to let them sin put them on free moral he could not make them sin and remain god and then punish them for something he had them made them do but when he put man on partnership with him now i love this because brother paul brought it out that adam and eve satan when he came to eve he said but if if you take of this tree he said you shall be gods brother paul said they were already gods and this is god god made man partners with him not not less not more partners equal partners they were gods but when he put man on partnership with him then let man act as a free moral agent see the same thing he's got you on today c c you act any way you want to you're a free moral agent so therefore if he put the first like that he has to put the second like that he has to put everyone like that or he acted wrong in the first place see but everybody is on the same basis do you have that next one and the very thing that man fell and become lost he become the savior so you have this fall because of free moral agency but then this is saying he does he's going to do the exact same thing and the very thing that man fell and become lost he become the savior of that taking his own law and he could not do it as that great jehovah that covered all space time see he couldn't do it and he had to become a man and he took kinship with the man that was lost amen and become a man god made flesh god became god became from god to become me to take to take my sin upon him that he might make me him amen back to his great purpose of sons and daughters of god for he is the eternal father he became me that i might become him amen let's do that last one it's not expressions of some church that we should express something it's a life that you don't live yourself it takes the pressure off of you but he comes in you and lives by a self how by the spirit and you become a prisoner to any human intellectual being at all you're led by the spirit and how do you know than skipping down but if you have the mind of christ christ christ expresses himself through you shows that it's him and not and it's not you you've not lost your mind and then he he talks about that a little bit but he says but a real man is to lose his own thoughts and his own thinking not come up blindly so he's trying to he's trying to explain this so don't let this confuse you it's not just that you become a robot it's not just you you lose your mind completely and you know we're all insane but he says it's not something you come blindly you lose your thoughts as in you lay your thoughts down and you take his thoughts up no sir you come up with your right senses and christ takes you over and expresses itself and now to the world you're an insane person but when christ takes you over he'll express that word right through you because it's him he is the word see and then you can see the expression of christ not some illusion of some sort but a real genuine christ expressing himself right through you how beautiful amen you can stand to your feet this this war that's within us and it's warring and we feel it we feel it at times and seasons in our life we feel it when temptation comes what is it it's that law of sin trying to come back and cause you to war within yourself but if you just give over to the word and you take god's thoughts what's god's thoughts his word you take god's thoughts and it just does away with that it it if if you'll just pitch your tent towards jesus christ towards the spirit walk after the spirit then then it does away with it and then christ expresses himself through you amen amen giddy and i as much as i want to try to sing i just can't let's let's bow our heads and pray and i'll turn it over to these guys and grow heavenly father we we just love you tonight and lord i just pray god that the people could see father how how you set up this plan of redemption and and how you just said it lord so that your spirit just completely does everything not everything in the sense of pushing us through a pipe and pulling us out the other side but all the tools are there and all we have to do is yield to it so father i i pray it's it's simple and yet lord it's it truly is a war at times because because we are carnal lord in our in our own flesh because we still have that flesh nature these flesh bodies born in sin lord that war is ever present with us as paul said but i'm so glad that paul didn't just leave it there but lord your word says that the word of god was written by inspiration of the holy ghost so that same spirit that wants to indwell us and help us to make it to help us to to be victorious lives and to let you express yourself through us that same spirit moved upon paul to write these things that even going back to our opening scripture when we don't even know what to pray sometimes lord i've i've been in prayer and and all's that i know lord is that i need i need help i don't know exactly what that looks like i don't know what that is but i just know that i need i need you and i need the help and the strength of your spirit father even when we don't know your word says that the spirit will intercede for us [Music] i think lord maybe we'll sing it later is i think listen to our hearts father because we lack words so many times god even when i say i love you lord it just doesn't feel it just doesn't feel right it doesn't feel like enough if somebody's struggling here tonight god then lord i just pray father let your spirit come on the scene fill that person lord maybe they just lift it lift their hands to you now to let them know that they need you lord my hand's lifted lord i need you i want to live lord like christ lived i want to i want to walk after the spirit i want the spirit to lead me i want the spirit to take my vocal cords and and speak i i want to lord i hope it's not wrong to say i want to see visions lord i want to i want to lay hands on the sick and then be recovered but lord even more than that i want to live an overcoming life [Music] those things are good but father what is it without a life to back it up i pray god that tonight it would be the power and demonstration that was preached and that you would just take control now of every vessel we love you lord help us god when temptation comes on your word promised you'd give you gave a way of escape let us turn to your way lord help us to just simply yield to you we love you bless our pastor and his family as they're out resting i just pray that they would come home refreshed and just have blessed memories together and and i pray god watch over the flock lord while the shepherd's away lord i know brother paul would say it's the holy ghost that leads the church so that same holy ghost that leads the shepherd father i pray you'd lead us now watch over us lord keep us safe naturally and spiritually until we can meet again we love you lord let your people be encouraged i pray they're encouraged tonight in jesus christ's name amen
