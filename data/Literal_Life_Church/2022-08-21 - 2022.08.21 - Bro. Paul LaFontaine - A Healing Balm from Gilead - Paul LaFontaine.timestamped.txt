[0:00] if you'd like to read with me
[0:02] and go to the word of god
[0:04] and we're thankful
[0:05] just to be here be his presence we had a
[0:10] very small crowd on wednesday night
[0:12] because some of them had already we're
[0:13] getting ready for camp and stuff and so
[0:16] but i just said hey i was glad to be
[0:18] here wherever he shows up it's church so
[0:20] i was glad to be in his presence
[0:22] amen just takes two or three and i trust
[0:25] the lord will bless you this morning we
[0:26] can enter into the word of god i don't
[0:29] think i have any other announcements we
[0:30] appreciate
[0:32] your giving
[0:33] to me mindful that for the
[0:35] the church and also the missions things
[0:38] that we're overseeing and is that i'd
[0:40] stopped in chick-fil-a last night and
[0:42] you know they're always trying to ask
[0:43] you questions they get personable with
[0:45] you and the one boy actually said if you
[0:47] had a million dollars right now and i
[0:48] handed you a million dollars
[0:50] he said what would you do with it and i
[0:51] said i'd send it overseas to build a
[0:53] bunch of churches we're building some
[0:55] now but i built a bunch more so it kind
[0:57] of took him by surprise you know that we
[0:59] would spend that money i think he was
[1:01] expecting another answer you know
[1:03] but that's my heart it's only the
[1:05] kingdom that counts now
[1:07] it's only the kingdom of what we do for
[1:09] his kingdom that's the only thing that
[1:10] counts and we're happy for that we have
[1:13] a little we had a trustee meeting
[1:14] yesterday and i'm going to make a need
[1:16] known to the congregation
[1:18] we've had a couple things come up that
[1:20] we need to take care of as the building
[1:21] is old and
[1:23] and i'm going to announce this one first
[1:25] for us to help out with um and join
[1:28] together
[1:29] as and i'm announcing this one because
[1:31] this is very recent that you felt the
[1:33] effects of it when we had 300 people in
[1:35] here and it was a hot day like it was a
[1:38] couple sundays ago
[1:39] our air conditioners we found out are
[1:41] not
[1:42] capable of keeping up with the entire
[1:44] building so we were sweating pretty bad
[1:46] all weekend and we want to be able in
[1:48] the future to have
[1:49] meetings like that periodically and so
[1:52] we didn't know that they were not
[1:53] capable we've done a lot of research on
[1:55] them and tried to do and we're thankful
[1:57] to have brother garrett frame in our
[1:59] church now who's very good at air
[2:01] conditioners and
[2:03] furnaces and just about everything else
[2:05] and he's been so good to give us advice
[2:07] on the different things we're glad to
[2:09] have him and now that i've announced it
[2:10] you'll announce that you'll be calling
[2:12] him when your furnace is down no doubt
[2:14] and you should he'd be glad to do help
[2:16] out he's good at it but we after
[2:19] calculating we need to put a couple
[2:21] extra units in the wall here to
[2:22] supplement and in the gym and the back
[2:24] area and with the electrical and with
[2:27] the units and also the um
[2:29] the labor it's going to be close to 50
[2:32] 000 to do that to supplement we we can't
[2:35] redo the units we have we have to just
[2:37] supplement the air so i'm making that
[2:39] need known to you whatever the lord lays
[2:41] on your heart to help out with it i told
[2:43] the trustees at the end yesterday the
[2:44] lord knows the need and we just put it
[2:46] before the lord and i believe he can do
[2:48] it praise the lord
[2:50] jeremiah chapter 8 and verse 18
[2:53] jeremiah chapter 8
[2:56] and verse 18.
[2:57] when i would comfort myself against
[2:59] sorrow
[3:01] my heart
[3:02] is faint in me this is the prophet
[3:04] jeremiah when i would comfort myself
[3:07] against sorrow my heart is faint in me
[3:10] behold the cry the voice of the cry of
[3:13] the daughter of my people because of
[3:15] them that dwell in a far country is not
[3:17] the lord in zion is not her king in her
[3:21] why have they provoked me to anger with
[3:23] their graven images and with their
[3:26] strange vanities this is the the
[3:27] children of israel and this is the the
[3:29] people of god living within their city
[3:31] but they'd slowly slowly turn to graven
[3:34] images and different idols
[3:36] and begin to provoke the lord by doing
[3:38] that because they knew that was wrong
[3:40] and so god says you're provoking me to
[3:43] anger and god's prophet said with all
[3:45] this going on
[3:46] is it the lord still in zion is not the
[3:49] king still among her and the answer to
[3:51] that was that question was yes the lord
[3:54] is still among us the king is still in
[3:56] her nothing's changed the lord is
[3:58] available can you say amen
[4:01] so despite our weaknesses and despite
[4:03] our mistakes the lord is still with us
[4:06] and the lord is still near us can you
[4:08] say amen
[4:09] the harvest has passed the summer has
[4:11] ended and we are not saved for the hurt
[4:13] of the daughter of my people am i hurt i
[4:15] am black astonishment hath taken hold on
[4:18] me and then this is familiar scripture
[4:20] to you is there no bomb
[4:22] in gilead is there no physician there
[4:25] why then is not the health of the
[4:28] daughter of my people recovered and i
[4:31] was going to read verse 22 again
[4:34] is there no balm in gilead is there no
[4:36] physician there and the answer to that
[4:38] question of course was yes there is a
[4:41] balm in gilead there is a physician
[4:43] there to be able to heal the people why
[4:46] then is not the health of the daughter
[4:48] of my people recovered and of course
[4:49] he's not speaking of a physical
[4:52] sickness here he's speaking of a
[4:54] spiritual sickness in the people
[4:56] aren't you glad to know that when
[4:58] there's spiritual sickness god's already
[5:00] provided the balm and gilead god's
[5:02] already provided the help and the
[5:04] physician and how many believe the great
[5:06] physician now is here this morning the
[5:09] sympathizing jesus we believe that
[5:11] heavenly father bless and anoint
[5:13] encourage us in your word today we pray
[5:15] you'll bless those that are listening at
[5:17] the camp as well and the word of god
[5:19] going forth and i pray your kingdom
[5:21] would be furthered in satan's kingdom
[5:24] lord would be destroyed and lord the the
[5:26] effect of satan's kingdom would lose its
[5:29] power as young people and all of us lord
[5:31] get closer to you we commit this service
[5:34] to you and i pray your blessed and
[5:35] anointed this morning in the name of the
[5:37] lord jesus christ we ask him amen amen
[5:40] once you shake somebody's hand before
[5:42] you seated god bless you wanted to say
[5:45] thank you so much to the
[5:48] we had
[5:49] a few musicians and song leaders out
[5:51] this morning and so we kind of got a
[5:54] second string but we didn't suffer at
[5:56] all this morning in our instruments and
[5:58] leading a worship we did not suffer at
[6:00] all
[6:01] it was good let's give them a hand thank
[6:03] you brothers and sisters for health
[6:05] helping us we had
[6:07] very very good we're so blessed in the
[6:09] gifts the lord jesus put on our heart
[6:13] a couple of scriptures this week after
[6:15] last sunday and it was just brought to
[6:17] my attention a couple things and so i
[6:19] looked them up couple was early in the
[6:20] morning i just looked them up on my
[6:22] phone
[6:23] and uh the one that came to my heart one
[6:25] was this is there no balm and gilead and
[6:28] i started to research a little bit early
[6:30] in the morning what that meant when he
[6:32] said the balm and gilead and why did he
[6:35] referred against the first time in
[6:36] scripture
[6:37] that a prophet refers to a balm
[6:40] but it particularly in gilead and why
[6:43] was that tied back to the city or the
[6:45] mountain of gilead and so i begin to
[6:47] look at it and and so then another
[6:49] scripture that came to my heart last
[6:52] week and we won't be preaching on this
[6:54] as such but that's found in isaiah 1 and
[6:57] verse 9.
[6:58] and there's an interesting scripture
[7:00] there from the prophet isaiah and he
[7:02] said except the lord of hosts had left
[7:05] us a very
[7:06] small remnant we should have become or
[7:10] been as sodom and we should have been
[7:13] like unto gomorrah and i was very
[7:16] encouraged by that this week to realize
[7:19] that it's god's grace that we've been
[7:22] left his grace we've been left a remnant
[7:24] and we've been left a word
[7:26] and if god had not provided that word
[7:29] for us
[7:30] we too would become
[7:32] succumbed can you say amen by sodom and
[7:35] gomorrah
[7:36] it's just his grace can you say amen and
[7:38] if we were not left something from the
[7:41] lord in this generation
[7:43] we would be overwhelmed we would be
[7:45] outnumbered can you say amen the demonic
[7:48] power that is in a flood this this uh
[7:51] generation in this last hour before the
[7:54] coming of the lord
[7:56] with that dynamic dynamic realm just
[8:00] increasing that we would become
[8:02] outnumbered we would become overwhelmed
[8:04] by it our children would not have a
[8:06] protection of that at all we would not
[8:08] be able to go up against it we are
[8:11] caught we would be caught in the webs of
[8:13] the mindset of the world and the wisdom
[8:15] of this world and what we see what we
[8:19] would observe unless we had the word and
[8:21] the holy spirit to deal with us we would
[8:24] we would follow what we see we would
[8:26] follow the norm and by following that we
[8:29] would open ourselves up to the spirits
[8:31] that are in this generation and i like
[8:33] this scripture it says except for the
[8:35] grace of the lord except he left us
[8:38] something we would have become as sodom
[8:41] and gomorrah but i want to proclaim to
[8:43] us this morning he gave us grace so that
[8:45] we had something a token that we would
[8:48] not be left to the spirits of sodom and
[8:50] gomorrah i preach against it almost
[8:53] every service because it's becoming so
[8:55] manifested and so prevalent and it wants
[8:57] to come and and and take the atmosphere
[9:00] that we have but we have a word we have
[9:03] a word from god can you say amen and we
[9:06] have availability of the holy ghost for
[9:08] our children something to hold that
[9:10] spirit back can you say a man we have it
[9:13] we ought to raise our hands and rejoice
[9:15] this morning that we have a token that
[9:17] would hold off the death angel that
[9:19] would hold off the spirit
[9:21] of sodom and gomorrah except the lord
[9:24] had left a very tiny small remnant we
[9:27] would have become like sodom and
[9:29] gomorrah
[9:31] i just raised my hand and said thank god
[9:33] that he left us a little remnant can you
[9:35] say man
[9:36] we would wear out over time
[9:38] we would give in over time it's the
[9:41] nature of our time and the nature of our
[9:42] time is not not a hose of water not a
[9:45] light rain as i read a few weeks ago
[9:47] when the enemy rushes in like a flood
[9:49] it's not a light rain it's not a trickle
[9:52] of a hose it's not even a hose it's a
[9:54] flood in this generation
[9:57] and when you are completely but when you
[10:00] are completely conscious
[10:02] of how brutal
[10:04] the denomic realm is against you against
[10:08] your family against your marriage
[10:10] against your spirit against your mind
[10:13] when you're conscious because you see we
[10:15] have to be by the holy spirit conscious
[10:17] of the time we're living in we wrestle
[10:19] not against flesh and blood
[10:22] our battle is not with one another
[10:25] but we wrestle against principalities
[10:27] and powers and spiritual wickedness in
[10:30] high places and trust me they're not
[10:32] they're not dormant they're not just
[10:34] sitting there they're active demons can
[10:37] you say amen they're against you they're
[10:39] against what you believe they're against
[10:41] your proclamation of the message they're
[10:43] against your children if they can't get
[10:45] you they're trying to go for your
[10:46] children these are relentless brutal
[10:50] enemies and demons against you and
[10:52] against this word
[10:54] and we have to be conscious that it's
[10:56] just that real as a christian we cannot
[10:59] be dormant ourself we can't be numb to
[11:01] it ourself we can't be numb like the
[11:03] rest of the world
[11:04] brother lonnie jacob said this to me one
[11:06] time the world has no concept of spirit
[11:10] the world has no concept of spirit so
[11:12] when they see bad in the world they see
[11:15] rape and they see murder and they see
[11:16] all these things they just well that's
[11:18] just bad people but it's demon power
[11:21] that has no restriction
[11:24] on a life that has no holy ghost
[11:27] and so it's the world has no concept of
[11:30] spirit and a lot of the church world now
[11:32] has no concept they don't want to talk
[11:33] about demons they don't want to talk
[11:35] about the demon in just in the other
[11:37] dimension there's a denominator realm
[11:39] that's against believers and against the
[11:41] word of god they don't want to they get
[11:43] a little scared talking about demons so
[11:45] that's spooky that's we but it's real
[11:47] and to a believer it's real
[11:51] and we can't be like then we must be
[11:52] conscious that this other realm is
[11:55] brutal against believers and children
[11:57] and families and churches in this hour
[12:00] and it's become worse
[12:02] i mentioned this scripture to you jesus
[12:04] said since the time of john the baptist
[12:07] until now the kingdom of heaven
[12:10] suffereth violence
[12:14] and just stop right there since the time
[12:17] john introduced the messiah he said
[12:20] there's an increase
[12:22] and the kingdom of heaven is suffering a
[12:24] violent attack
[12:26] from the demonic realm
[12:29] isn't an interesting sense the message
[12:30] of john the baptist came who had the
[12:32] spirit of elijah
[12:34] we always had demons but when the word
[12:36] goes forth from elijah the dynamic
[12:39] forces
[12:40] increase
[12:43] so now we've had this word
[12:46] for some 50 60 years now restored word
[12:49] we've had our bibles for 2000 years but
[12:51] the restoration of the bible the
[12:53] restoration of truths we had it for 50
[12:55] 60 years and ever since it came forth
[12:58] the devil has been hopping mad
[13:01] he's been angry how can i stop this
[13:03] thing how can i put seeds of doubt how
[13:05] can i do it how can i get the people to
[13:07] backslide against it
[13:10] how can i get their children
[13:12] since the time that the message came
[13:14] forth that's when the demonic realm
[13:16] increased against us now we're in 2022
[13:20] so i ask you has it decreased
[13:23] has satan backed off
[13:25] has satan got tired has his demonic
[13:28] realm got tired and said you know what
[13:30] i've been trying to wear these people
[13:32] out for some 30 40 50 years and i'm just
[13:35] going to take a few years break no it
[13:38] keeps increasing and the bible says
[13:41] since the time of john the baptist until
[13:44] now the kingdom of god suffereth
[13:47] violence violence
[13:48] but
[13:49] the violet
[13:50] take it by force
[13:56] so we need to have an aggressive
[13:58] response a
[13:59] violent response how do we do it through
[14:02] prayer
[14:04] through saying lord fill me with the
[14:05] holy ghost
[14:07] lord this i'm conscious
[14:09] demons are fighting against me but lord
[14:11] increase my prayer life increase my
[14:14] hunger for the word of god let me lay
[14:16] aside my phone and all the other
[14:18] entertainments let me grab my bible let
[14:20] me grab this message let me be in it
[14:23] more than i ever have because it needs a
[14:25] violent response it needs an extreme
[14:28] response that's why last sunday when i
[14:30] talked about dress and things like that
[14:32] i got to think i thought
[14:33] can can i possibly be too extreme in
[14:36] talking about dress when the when the
[14:39] world is the way it is
[14:41] i don't want to bring a religion about
[14:42] it but listen could i be too extreme
[14:44] about convictions and standards and how
[14:47] young people should conduct themselves
[14:49] i'm not sure if i could be too extreme
[14:52] when we know the devil is so extreme to
[14:54] take their lives
[14:56] and i'm thankful that i had amens from
[14:58] most of you last sunday i'm thankful for
[15:01] the text and the response i received
[15:03] this week i have been so overwhelmed
[15:06] to the support to say preach it say it
[15:09] like it is let's not mess with these
[15:12] standards preach it brother paul
[15:18] thank you
[15:21] sometimes you feel like you stand alone
[15:23] today and sometimes that thing says
[15:25] don't talk about that period preach the
[15:26] rest of the message but don't talk about
[15:28] that
[15:29] that's legalism that's not legalism it's
[15:31] god's standard
[15:34] praise the lord and i appreciate it you
[15:36] know
[15:37] just i appreciate the response and just
[15:40] just the support and some of us that
[15:42] weren't here to see it so brother ian's
[15:44] working on that and i'll send it out
[15:46] again to you
[15:47] and i might send it with a few comments
[15:49] but i i said it from my heart just as
[15:52] reminders
[15:53] and i think we'll send all the quotes
[15:55] with it because you said there was
[15:56] quotes and scriptures with it but what i
[15:58] got to thinking is that
[16:00] quotes if you use quotes and you're
[16:02] trying to convince somebody sometimes
[16:05] even if quotes it's not going to
[16:06] convince somebody to change their ways
[16:09] you know how it would as if they have a
[16:10] value for god's profit and what he said
[16:14] but if they don't have a value for it
[16:16] they're not going to change their ways
[16:17] anyway i could read a million quotes
[16:20] because this isn't just about a quote
[16:22] this is about a life in jesus christ
[16:24] that has holiness in it
[16:27] oh praise the lord i'm not on that
[16:29] subject but i want to say thank you all
[16:31] for your response and you know i think
[16:34] god
[16:35] uh god wants us to talk about these
[16:37] things to combat
[16:39] these these spirits of immodesty and
[16:41] these spirits of homosexuality can you
[16:43] say amen
[16:45] when you are completely conscious of how
[16:47] brutal this demonic realm is right now
[16:49] 2022 then you start praying you start
[16:53] clinging to what god has given us
[16:56] you don't get further away from it you
[16:57] cling to it
[16:59] you say lord i'm all in can you say man
[17:01] like i said wednesday night we're not
[17:02] looking for ways around the word but
[17:04] david said i love thy law i love thy
[17:07] precepts
[17:09] i love the word how did he come there he
[17:11] made a mistake he stepped on god's word
[17:13] he committed adultery but after that he
[17:16] had a full repentance and he said lord
[17:19] i'm no longer for looking for ways for
[17:21] around your quotes
[17:23] i'm not looking for ways around the
[17:25] quotes i'm embracing it i love it
[17:27] because i know it's your love that sent
[17:29] it to me somebody say amen this morning
[17:32] when we look at the word the right way
[17:34] we know it comes from god and we love it
[17:37] we don't detest it it's not bondage to
[17:39] us
[17:41] somebody say praise the lord
[17:43] sodom has come to its full manifestation
[17:46] i want to correct something i said
[17:47] wednesday night
[17:48] and i thought that biden had elected
[17:50] this uh trans
[17:52] uh last sunday when i was speaking but
[17:55] it was the picture was sent to me last
[17:56] sunday in the article it was in january
[17:58] that he that he appointed
[18:00] and i was right in that in his
[18:02] administration he's appointed over 200
[18:05] gays more than any other president ever
[18:07] in history and uh and also it was in
[18:10] january it seems president joe biden
[18:12] made history last month that's when sam
[18:14] britain i can't show you the picture i
[18:16] can't show the picture in church but
[18:18] it's it's it's it's an amazing picture
[18:20] to see this
[18:21] man woman whatever he is
[18:23] and he announced that when that's when
[18:25] sam britton announced the administration
[18:26] had hired them him as a deputy assistant
[18:29] secretary of spent fuel and waste uh
[18:33] disposition in the office of nuclear
[18:35] energy for the department of energy
[18:37] britain like many of the people quoted
[18:39] in this article uses the pronouns they
[18:41] and them and may be the first openly
[18:44] gender fluid person in federal
[18:47] government leadership first time january
[18:50] of this year if you can't see that the
[18:52] sodom spirit and the mixing of genders
[18:54] has come to the full manifestation and
[18:57] that ought to tell us one thing first of
[18:59] all i want my children and my life and
[19:01] my home protected from that spirit
[19:03] second of all hey it's the coming of the
[19:05] lord
[19:06] we're close to the coming of the lord
[19:10] we're just about wrapped up
[19:14] it's just about over
[19:16] every morning i wake up now this morning
[19:18] i say lord i've been singing that song
[19:20] sister debbie lately all i've got is
[19:24] leaving on my mind
[19:27] the windows and the shutters it all
[19:29] needs help and
[19:30] attention and repair but rusty goodman
[19:33] wrote the song it says i know i need to
[19:34] do all this work on the house and i got
[19:36] this honey-do list and i got everything
[19:38] but lately all i've got is leaving on my
[19:42] mind
[19:43] i want to get out of here
[19:45] i'm ready to go i don't want to be
[19:47] earthbound can you say man
[19:49] tired of this world tired of its
[19:51] pressure
[19:52] tired of the demonic force and i'm gonna
[19:54] keep fighting to the very last day but i
[19:57] know when this sodom spirit is at the
[19:59] manifestation that it is i know we're
[20:01] very close to the coming of the lord
[20:05] hallelujah
[20:07] and that shouldn't scare us that should
[20:09] make us rejoice
[20:10] if you're in the place you should be you
[20:12] say lord bring it on i am ready by the
[20:14] grace of god i am ready to go
[20:18] you should go to the altar in your heart
[20:20] if you're not ready to say i'm ready
[20:23] i'm ready to go
[20:26] accept a very small tiny remnant
[20:30] accept grace
[20:31] except god provided something in our
[20:34] time we would have all become as sodom
[20:37] and gomorrah or slowly accepting that
[20:41] the strict call for a dress code was not
[20:44] was was linked to where gender dressing
[20:47] demons would come and take over so he
[20:50] gave us the word and i wanted to say you
[20:52] can't there's something last sunday that
[20:54] kind of kind of
[20:56] dropped in my heart you can't
[20:58] acknowledge that we're in sodom
[21:01] and then make the quotes undress
[21:03] irrelevant today
[21:06] oh yeah i'm going to say it again
[21:07] you can't have it both ways
[21:10] yes amen brother paul we're in the full
[21:12] manifestation biden has elected these
[21:14] people we're in the full sodom and
[21:16] gomorrah and then you're going to back
[21:18] off from the quotes that set a modesty
[21:20] standard and separate the genders you're
[21:23] going to back off you can't have both
[21:25] worlds because it's that word that's
[21:27] been played put in place as protections
[21:30] against demon power
[21:33] i should get a greater amen than that
[21:35] he gave his word because he knew in 2022
[21:40] this spirit would dominate our
[21:42] government our schools
[21:44] every institution
[21:48] all of them starbucks all the places we
[21:50] frequent all the places we go also come
[21:54] by that spirit and giving it room
[21:58] ymca the ymca young men's christian
[22:01] association it was set up as a young
[22:03] men's christian association
[22:05] and here in a city the other day an 80
[22:07] year old woman was in the locker room
[22:09] the women's locker room and a trans came
[22:11] in standing in the corner watching young
[22:14] girls get undressed and she spoke up
[22:17] against it and said that's wrong i'm
[22:18] standing against it she they took away
[22:20] her membership they're blasting her
[22:23] that's the ymca
[22:25] every institution no matter how good it
[22:27] was at the beginning is being succumbed
[22:30] by this spirit
[22:32] but we don't want it here in our midst
[22:34] we don't want it here in our atmosphere
[22:37] [Applause]
[22:39] be conscious of where we're at
[22:42] be conscious of the word
[22:44] and what the holy spirit is speaking to
[22:46] us
[22:47] for the salvation
[22:49] of my children
[22:52] for the preservation
[22:54] until we leave here of my home my home's
[22:57] a sacred place thankfully i still have
[22:58] the choice
[23:00] of what i allow and what i don't allow
[23:01] in my home
[23:03] every day it's a choice
[23:05] thankfully i still have that choice
[23:06] because i can't choose you know even
[23:08] when i'm on hold on the phone zack
[23:11] i have to listen to music
[23:14] that i didn't choose
[23:16] now how many rights are being taken away
[23:17] from us
[23:21] i have to go in a restaurant and i if i
[23:23] were to ask they could switch it to the
[23:25] lafontaines they'd look at me like an
[23:28] idiot
[23:29] and they'd say who's the lafontaines
[23:32] but i am forced to listen to their music
[23:35] i'm forced in walmart to see immodest
[23:37] stressing i i i pay taxes i go to those
[23:40] places i pay to keep them in business
[23:43] but i don't have any rights as far as
[23:44] the atmosphere there's no place left
[23:47] that's holy anymore there's no place
[23:50] left hardly at all in this world so
[23:52] let's stand on our own two feet with god
[23:55] with the banner of the token of god and
[23:57] say we will hold to the token for our
[24:00] homes for our minds for our families
[24:04] because god gave us the token at the
[24:07] evening time
[24:08] and if he hadn't we would have become as
[24:11] sodom and gomorrah how many can say
[24:13] praise the lord
[24:15] amen so now in jeremy jeremiah
[24:18] 8 it's not the
[24:20] it's not the world that's slowly turning
[24:22] away from god it's god's people in
[24:24] jerusalem jeremiah's standing there as a
[24:26] prophet i don't know why i'm losing my
[24:27] voice but i'll preach to it's gone
[24:31] jeremiah the prophet is standing there
[24:33] at the gates of jerusalem it's not the
[24:35] world that's compromising it's the
[24:37] people of god that are turning to idols
[24:40] and he's saying why
[24:42] why
[24:43] why are you turning this way is there no
[24:45] lord still here is there no king still
[24:48] here why is there no healing and he's
[24:50] saying that you're you're in a condition
[24:53] of sickness spiritual sickness why is
[24:55] the daughter my people not being healed
[24:58] because the bomb is there no bomb and
[25:00] gilead available is there a physician
[25:03] here and israel if they had responded
[25:06] jeremiah they would have to admit no our
[25:09] king is still here our physician is
[25:11] still in our midst he is here hallelujah
[25:15] he is here amen he's still here
[25:20] they would have to say jeremiah no
[25:22] there's a physician here there's a bomb
[25:23] in gilead there's if we're sick
[25:26] spiritually there's something that we
[25:27] have here
[25:32] why is there not spiritual
[25:34] healthy
[25:35] strong
[25:36] people sometimes i ask myself
[25:39] why
[25:40] with all that we have
[25:43] that god has provided for us
[25:48] why
[25:49] is there not more spiritually
[25:52] healthy
[25:53] strong
[25:54] people in the lord
[25:58] i don't mean that as a to belittle
[25:59] anybody personally this morning
[26:01] but i i asked the same question in
[26:03] jeremiah
[26:04] because we
[26:05] they don't have
[26:07] a physician unless they turn to him we
[26:10] have a physician
[26:13] we have an answer
[26:15] we have the word
[26:17] we have the holy ghost like brother
[26:19] andrew down there at the camps i was
[26:20] listening a little bit he said he said
[26:22] that the demonic realm would be poured
[26:24] out in the last days the prophet said
[26:26] poured out more than it ever has but he
[26:28] also said the holy spirit at the same
[26:30] time would be poured out upon his people
[26:32] it's a good thing can you say a man in
[26:34] the last days i'll pour out my spirit
[26:38] and we're going to need that to go go up
[26:40] against the spirits that are coming
[26:44] in the last days he'll pour it out and
[26:46] then this holy spirit was bound for
[26:49] almost 2 000 years but by by the door of
[26:52] creeds and dogmas but he said it's to be
[26:54] released in the evening time by the
[26:57] evening time messenger what was released
[26:59] not quotes not a doctrine not a new
[27:02] religion not a a message movement no
[27:06] what's released to us the holy spirit is
[27:09] to be released in the evening time by
[27:12] the evening time message
[27:15] there's no limitations to the holy ghost
[27:17] there's no limitations to this holy
[27:19] spirit we just got to pray get in the
[27:21] word say lord i submit myself fill me
[27:23] with your spirit keep my lamps trending
[27:25] and burning
[27:27] i can't do that for your brothers and
[27:28] sisters you can live halfway all you
[27:30] want to borderline hashtag borderline
[27:33] believers you can do it all you want to
[27:34] i can't do it for you but i can preach
[27:36] it and tell you there's a holy ghost
[27:38] there's there's a life that can stay
[27:40] filled with the spirit of god and it is
[27:42] the only combat for our children and our
[27:44] families
[27:47] us we come like sodom and gomorrah
[27:50] i go ahead and say it you start
[27:52] compromising on standards
[27:54] you have your children marrying some
[27:56] unbeliever
[27:58] do you really want that
[28:00] who they associate with they're going to
[28:02] end up marrying
[28:04] because you haven't taught the standard
[28:06] first of all
[28:08] first of all teach them
[28:09] to become a believer you need to be born
[28:12] again
[28:13] by the
[28:14] spirit and then when you do
[28:17] then you will according to the word be
[28:19] looking for somebody who has that
[28:21] born-again experience as well
[28:24] that's what we teach our children
[28:26] if you if you're silent about it i
[28:28] guarantee you which direction they'll go
[28:34] and then you'll be wondering what what's
[28:36] going on
[28:37] there's a standard there's a word
[28:38] there's a holy spirit here
[28:41] and you can't mock it you can't minimize
[28:43] it you can't you can't compromise it
[28:45] with it you can't say you can't pick and
[28:47] choose what you want what you don't want
[28:49] you can't mess with it can i get an amen
[28:51] this morning i was i say lord help me
[28:53] not to be hard this morning last sunday
[28:54] was hard enough lord help me to not be
[28:56] that way but there's something i don't
[28:58] know what it is it's just churning
[28:59] within me maybe we're close but god is
[29:02] calling people that don't have the holy
[29:05] spirit completely in the born-again
[29:06] experience it's time now if it ever was
[29:09] time it's time to run towards god you
[29:13] heard the song that says he's running
[29:15] towards you how about you running
[29:17] towards him
[29:23] say well i've been in the message for 30
[29:24] years i grew up in the i don't care
[29:26] about that now
[29:28] do you have the board and get experience
[29:30] forget about the drama forget about the
[29:32] politics and the message forget about
[29:34] what's going on in there in jefferson
[29:36] forget about that there's only one thing
[29:38] you need to know am i filled with the
[29:40] spirit of god and am i feeding on the
[29:42] word
[29:44] that's it it's not any more complicated
[29:46] than that
[29:49] god help my spirit never to cross over
[29:51] into an arrogance or a pride or
[29:53] something to be mean to you i don't want
[29:54] to be mean to you but there's just
[29:56] something churning my spirit spreads
[29:59] i will not stand by and not preach
[30:02] the power of this word
[30:04] for the people's lives
[30:09] see what about my children i'll pray
[30:11] with you for your children because the
[30:13] hours late say god bring them in now
[30:17] put conviction in their heart
[30:20] help them get over all the walls that
[30:22] have been put up towards the message and
[30:25] towards the pastor and towards the
[30:27] church god it's time break those well
[30:30] let them not think that anymore let them
[30:32] only think one thing i need god
[30:35] where can i find the reality of god
[30:44] yes
[30:59] i'm praying for a revival i'm praying
[31:01] for individual revivals
[31:05] will you join with me would you join
[31:07] with me thursday mornings at 7 30 at
[31:09] prayer
[31:10] would you join with me
[31:25] so
[31:26] it can be the worst of times
[31:29] which i believe it is it can be there
[31:31] can be many problems
[31:33] we could be fighting against a lot of
[31:35] demons
[31:36] mental
[31:38] mental illness mental sickness
[31:42] but the worst thing above all the
[31:44] problems and the mental illness above
[31:46] all the worst thing is when the people
[31:48] of god forget that he's never left us
[31:51] without a medicine
[31:53] to heal us
[31:55] it's here
[31:58] there is a bomb in gilead
[32:02] there is a token
[32:04] to put over our children in our lives
[32:08] he's not left us in this mess of satan's
[32:10] eden without uh without what was needed
[32:14] to be provided for us to escape and us
[32:16] to make it and us to stay protected he
[32:19] has provided it for us i said some
[32:21] things last sunday on the on the trust
[32:24] in the last 50 years
[32:26] in other words the the the thrust gives
[32:28] me the thrust of the enemy in the last
[32:30] 50 years of taking over the mind
[32:33] and that is not only the
[32:35] so so now it's not just the physical
[32:37] healing that we need today it's not just
[32:39] physical hand because remember in the
[32:42] the prophet's message and whenever god
[32:44] rose he rose with healing in his wings
[32:46] so a lot of it was healing lines prayer
[32:48] lines with physical sicknesses cancers
[32:51] and diseases and tuberculosis and my
[32:54] thousands of people healed under that
[32:56] healing revival
[32:57] that started with the with uh
[33:00] william branham and then trickled to
[33:02] oral roberts and different ones my what
[33:04] a sweep in this country of specific
[33:06] meetings just to heal the sick and god
[33:08] is still doing that and still able to do
[33:11] it but then you watch how satan gets
[33:13] into starting with the the the
[33:16] the fourth dimension he gets into
[33:19] television and then he gets into this
[33:21] and he gets into this and this is the
[33:23] way satan says if i can get closer to
[33:26] influence through the channel from the
[33:28] fourth dimension if i can use the fourth
[33:30] dimension i have a channel to bring more
[33:34] demonic power into lives and thus bring
[33:37] not only physical sicknesses but mental
[33:41] sicknesses
[33:45] mental
[33:47] anxiety
[33:49] not preaching you down because you have
[33:51] that i'm just saying satan knew what he
[33:53] was doing
[33:54] to make us busy to cloud our minds
[33:58] to make us scared to make us worried and
[34:01] now it's so shallow that we can't keep
[34:03] up with the joneses we can't have the
[34:04] vacation that they have we can't wear
[34:06] the and so now it just becomes this
[34:08] thing it's all taken our minds and it's
[34:11] not just the minds but he found a
[34:13] channel satan knew he could transmit
[34:15] demon power through the fourth dimension
[34:17] and incidentally friends from television
[34:20] to social media to our phones
[34:26] it's influence from the fourth dimension
[34:30] that is the fourth dimension
[34:33] so there's seven dimensions
[34:36] the first three are time light and
[34:37] matter right
[34:41] the fourth dimension is television which
[34:43] the prophet said is with us
[34:45] we just have channels now to pick it up
[34:47] bring it in our phones
[34:49] the fifth dimension is where people go
[34:51] that are unsaved
[34:52] it's hell as you could call it it's the
[34:54] place of the lost
[34:57] the sixth dimension is where the saints
[34:59] go
[35:00] that have served the lord and have the
[35:01] holy spirit to wait until the
[35:03] resurrection time they're in the sixth
[35:05] dimension and the seventh dimension is
[35:07] where god dwells
[35:11] this is truth
[35:14] so
[35:14] now satan takes access to the only
[35:18] really the one he has and he spills over
[35:21] from his demonic power from the fifth
[35:23] dimension it spills over into the fourth
[35:26] dimension and that's why brother brahman
[35:28] says the television would have been a
[35:29] great tool for the kingdom of god but
[35:32] satan got a hold of it so most of the
[35:34] ownership of it is satan so he poured
[35:36] his fifth dimension into the fourth
[35:39] dimension and now we live over here in
[35:41] time light and matter and so we start
[35:44] feeding on more and more the fourth
[35:46] dimension
[35:48] the problem is is we didn't know only
[35:49] satan knew the more that we fed on that
[35:51] how many were five ten years old and
[35:53] that's all you fed on was television
[35:55] that's all you did when you got home
[35:56] from school
[35:58] and were you affected by it oh yeah you
[35:59] were affected by it not just what you
[36:02] seen but what you couldn't see
[36:10] all those sitcoms that you watch
[36:13] even today
[36:15] funny sitcoms but full of sex and full
[36:18] of dirty jokes
[36:21] friends
[36:22] modern family
[36:25] all those symptoms that you feed on
[36:28] the devil knew about that si kim before
[36:31] you did and he filled it with powers of
[36:34] the enemy that when you feed on it you
[36:36] say well
[36:37] i'm different i i shield from all that
[36:39] stuff come on man
[36:47] i wasn't gonna preach hard
[36:54] satan knew he could transmit demon power
[36:56] through the fourth dimension he's still
[36:57] doing it and that's why the minds are
[36:59] going crazy the minds are affected he
[37:01] knew the mind is everything because it
[37:02] can transmit
[37:04] all these things and bring a spirit and
[37:05] so and bring physical illness from it
[37:07] i'm going to read an article in a minute
[37:09] a pastor heard my sermon last sunday he
[37:10] sent me an article from harvard medical
[37:12] university and says now they have they
[37:14] have proof now that there is
[37:17] sicknesses and symptoms of physical
[37:19] sicknesses that are directly tied to
[37:21] social media
[37:22] that's not a christian organization
[37:24] that's harvard medical university
[37:26] now they discover people with symptoms
[37:29] of this i'll read it to you in a minute
[37:30] but you know
[37:31] i just say this we would all be better
[37:34] off
[37:35] without any of this
[37:38] that's going to be extreme to you
[37:39] because
[37:40] you can't live without your phone
[37:44] i was sitting on my porch this morning
[37:45] holding my phone
[37:48] you know you do this you check the news
[37:50] you check your emails you know and i
[37:52] just looked at i said you
[37:54] you devil
[37:58] and then i started to think about going
[37:59] in a rapture and i and i thought this is
[38:02] a great thought
[38:03] when i leave
[38:04] i'm leaving this phone
[38:07] and that was a great joy in my heart
[38:10] i'm leaving it all i'm leaving that
[38:12] beautiful home and i thank god for it
[38:14] i'm leaving it all and the only thing
[38:15] that goes is the character that he's
[38:17] created in me by the holy ghost that's
[38:19] the only thing that's going up
[38:21] all of it stan including my phone
[38:24] including my rental properties including
[38:27] the businesses
[38:28] including it all sister jane praise the
[38:31] lord brother dana
[38:33] even my phone is staying
[38:37] does that make you a little nervous
[38:40] i don't know about leaving that
[38:43] we're leaving it friends it's done it's
[38:45] finished
[38:46] never have to look at it again
[38:49] [Applause]
[38:52] never have to use it as my alarm to get
[38:54] up in the morning again no alarms can
[38:56] you say amen some of you brothers ought
[38:58] to praise the lord for that
[39:02] trying to get you on board
[39:03] you know i'd like to preach we should
[39:05] we'd be better off without it i'm just
[39:06] taking my time here now we would be
[39:08] better off without any of it can you say
[39:10] amen
[39:12] i'd like to preach a sermon i've been
[39:14] thinking about later i'd like to preach
[39:15] a sermon
[39:16] don't you ever criticize the amish
[39:22] that would be the title of my sermon
[39:25] we go over to amish country ship shawana
[39:26] mostly we like it over there one of the
[39:28] things i've noticed the last few months
[39:30] when we go over took my mom the other
[39:32] day
[39:33] but it's it's i'm not going to
[39:36] christianize or de-christianize these
[39:37] people i don't know what the amish have
[39:39] but all i know is when we go over there
[39:40] we took brandon and tiffany
[39:42] we notice a peacefulness once we just
[39:45] come into the entire area
[39:47] you go try it
[39:48] when you get out of the city and get
[39:50] away with all this demon power and you
[39:52] have an atmosphere of a people who for
[39:54] the most part don't feed on these things
[39:57] don't allow their children to feed on
[39:58] them most of them they are allowed to
[40:00] have phones
[40:03] and they got business they're
[40:04] functioning just fine and you have
[40:06] criticized the image amish in their
[40:08] dress and
[40:09] oh i could never live that way without
[40:11] electricity and without all my makeup
[40:14] and all this i could never live that way
[40:15] you know you're right you probably
[40:16] couldn't live that way
[40:19] but don't you dare criticize them no
[40:21] matter what you think they are as
[40:22] christians because just the fact that
[40:24] they've applied
[40:26] some
[40:26] holiness standards has helped
[40:29] the atmosphere
[40:31] and i said it to a couple of them that
[40:33] were in the stores i said
[40:35] what i notice over here is the
[40:36] atmosphere and she said well thank you
[40:37] very much
[40:39] a lot of people say that that it's just
[40:41] different it's peaceful we drive out
[40:43] there we see the horses it's just
[40:45] different
[40:47] pull that quote up sister genie
[40:50] just so you know that
[40:51] we got something to back it up no wonder
[40:53] the voice of god is a rare thing today
[40:55] it's smothered out by so many different
[40:57] voices so many things that dim and take
[40:58] away it's got to be a place until it
[41:00] dulls our senses until we can hear the
[41:02] voice of god our senses of where we
[41:04] ought to shake ourselves and realize
[41:06] that you are men and women and you are
[41:07] the creation of god
[41:09] and you were put here to serve him but
[41:11] satan's voice and false prophets oh be
[41:13] modern as i was speaking a few days ago
[41:15] i was coming to a church and i turned my
[41:17] radio on and i heard a program out of
[41:19] louisville that said that they were
[41:20] teaching their children in churches to
[41:22] just drink moderately making them modern
[41:24] so that they won't go to the excess
[41:26] we're going to teach our children to
[41:27] drink moderation so that you don't don't
[41:30] drink in excess that's that's stupid all
[41:33] right
[41:34] man that waits upon god comes into his
[41:37] prayer oh wait i didn't finish it how
[41:38] could the voice oh i didn't finish it
[41:40] back
[41:41] please okay how could the
[41:45] as i was speaking a few days ago okay
[41:47] teaching the children
[41:48] making them moderate so they won't go to
[41:50] excess okay i was done oh they need to
[41:52] teach them christ not drinking and that
[41:55] will wreck and room and damn any home
[41:57] how could the voice of god speak among a
[41:59] family that's half sauce with whiskey
[42:01] and their minds paralyzed with smoking
[42:04] and drinking and all night long
[42:06] carousing men that waits upon god comes
[42:08] into his presence
[42:10] and to come into the presence of god is
[42:12] just like going out early in the morning
[42:14] when the dew and the honeysuckles are
[42:15] all sweet when you come in the presence
[42:17] of a person like that you know they've
[42:19] been with god my wife said to me coming
[42:21] down this morning she said billy i don't
[42:23] mean to say this to flower at anybody
[42:25] but she said
[42:26] last night i believe in one of the
[42:28] nights she said i sat by one of the
[42:30] little amish women and a little lady
[42:32] with a little cap on her head and she
[42:34] said and you could tell
[42:36] that woman had been with jesus for she
[42:39] was sweet her soul was mellow her eyes
[42:43] were clear
[42:44] there's not no sin or nothing to hide
[42:47] behind or anything she had been in the
[42:50] presence of god
[42:52] don't you dare mock holiness don't you
[42:55] dare mock the standards that they have
[42:57] because it can have a result can you say
[42:59] man
[43:01] her senses was not dull by whiskey and
[43:04] tobacco and all kinds of things of the
[43:07] world she was refreshed from the
[43:09] presence of god reading her bible and
[43:12] studying god's word we need more message
[43:15] people to have that kind of sweetness
[43:17] and that kind of not a dull of our
[43:19] senses
[43:21] that's why we're tired sometimes on
[43:23] sunday morning because we've been on up
[43:24] all night watching movies
[43:27] and our senses are dull to spiritual
[43:28] things but once you come out of that
[43:30] world
[43:31] and get into his world
[43:33] you'll really start enjoying the
[43:35] services more
[43:40] when am i going to preach that don't you
[43:42] dare criticize the amish
[43:44] would you dare do that you know what i
[43:47] read a book over there
[43:49] every one of their teenagers
[43:53] every one of them have a choice to
[43:55] choose whether to remain an amish
[43:57] or whether to go to the world
[44:00] every one of them are given a choice
[44:02] you know they have a retention rate of
[44:04] about 91 percent
[44:08] i read that i said
[44:09] wow
[44:11] maybe some of them without even the holy
[44:13] ghost i'm not going to de-christianize
[44:14] but without a real birth but just just a
[44:16] standard of of keeping from the things
[44:19] of the world just with that
[44:21] and 91
[44:23] choose on their own i want this
[44:27] lifestyle of an amish
[44:30] what do we as americans even within our
[44:32] church sometimes
[44:34] young people i want the world i want to
[44:36] go after it i would
[44:38] something is wrong
[44:43] don't you dare criticize the amish
[44:47] don't dare criticize someone else and
[44:49] say they're legalists maybe some of them
[44:51] are but i'll tell you when we apply the
[44:54] word of god
[44:55] there are results that come from it that
[44:58] are benefits
[45:02] oh you understand that i'm not a
[45:04] legalist preacher
[45:05] and then you can make a religion out of
[45:07] your dress
[45:10] and not have the real thing you
[45:12] understand that
[45:13] but let's not swing that way and say
[45:15] there's not benefits to the spirit of
[45:17] modesty being talked to our children
[45:22] that if you if you if you stop feeding
[45:25] on
[45:26] these
[45:27] worldly things and you back off from it
[45:29] like i tell my children you do that
[45:31] you're going to pay for it you're going
[45:32] to you get certain age okay you go ahead
[45:34] and do it but you're going to pay for it
[45:36] because it only has one result clouding
[45:38] your mind with all kinds of junk
[45:41] and spiritually numb
[45:42] they have to make their own choice
[45:44] but i'm not going to quit saying it
[45:46] because i'm not a legalist
[45:52] people used to call tim pruitt a
[45:53] legalist
[45:55] and he said
[45:56] listen
[45:57] i'm not the one that legalized sin
[46:02] and that's just the way he'd say it
[46:05] bless god i'm not a legalist i'm not the
[46:07] one that legalized sin it's satan that
[46:10] legalized sin
[46:18] what we fill our minds with
[46:21] stuff can slip through
[46:23] it's the new problem in the world more
[46:25] than ever more medicine we have more
[46:26] medicines than ever
[46:28] and in itself
[46:30] it brings we have illnesses brother ed
[46:32] hememeister the pastor in edmonton sent
[46:35] me this article after last sunday you
[46:37] can look it up i don't have time to read
[46:38] it all harvard medical school ticks and
[46:40] tick tock can social media trigger
[46:42] illness
[46:43] just just came out i believe a student
[46:46] suddenly develops leg pain and paralysis
[46:48] soon hundreds of schoolmates have
[46:49] similar symptoms nuns begin biting each
[46:52] other and soon the same thing is
[46:53] happening at other nearby convents three
[46:56] school girls began laughing
[46:57] uncontrollably sometimes going on for
[46:59] days when nearly 100 classmates
[47:01] developed the same problem the school
[47:03] was forced to close down yet in each
[47:05] case no medical explanation was ever
[47:07] found eventually they came to be
[47:09] considered examples of mass sociogenic
[47:12] illness which many of us know by
[47:13] different names mass hysteria
[47:16] epidemic hysteria or mass psychogenic
[47:19] illness over the years many possible
[47:22] sources for these illnesses have emerged
[47:24] and today tick tock and other social
[47:28] media sites may be providing fertile
[47:31] ground
[47:34] just to confirm this next quote just to
[47:36] confirm all the way back in 1955
[47:40] our prophet says just recently even
[47:42] cancer has been declared to be a fourth
[47:46] dimension disease
[47:50] that it's in another dimension
[47:52] sure it's demonology every disease is a
[47:56] fourth dimension disease
[47:59] the beginning of it
[48:03] so you got an illness you got a sickness
[48:05] and it doesn't always come this way
[48:06] sometimes you get an illness for other
[48:08] reasons but sometimes it begins
[48:12] in the fourth dimension what you're
[48:14] feeding on and then you develop a
[48:16] sickness from it
[48:20] and that's why i was saying
[48:23] we not only need prayer lines for
[48:25] physical healing but we need prayer
[48:27] lines for mental healing
[48:30] mental illness
[48:31] to bring back a sound mind to ones that
[48:34] have lost their sound thinking
[48:37] through social media
[48:39] i'm glad today to be a son of god
[48:41] i'm glad today to have the soundness of
[48:43] the word of god
[48:45] i wouldn't be right i wouldn't be right
[48:47] and i still make mistakes but i wouldn't
[48:49] be this right in my thinking unless it
[48:51] was the grace of god to give me to some
[48:53] something to feed on other than all the
[48:55] things of the world
[48:57] let me raise that i'm thankful for the
[48:59] word of god that i can feed on
[49:01] my mind is not a garbage can my mind is
[49:04] not a channel satan can use to bring
[49:06] more illnesses to my body my mind
[49:08] belongs to the lord my body belongs to
[49:10] the lord this is a temple of the holy
[49:12] ghost a lot of people yield themselves
[49:14] to wear the right dress and the right
[49:16] clothes and the right things and and
[49:19] have the right things in their home but
[49:20] their mind is privately feeding on
[49:23] things that are bringing in sicknesses
[49:24] and illnesses and mental illness and i'm
[49:27] encouraging you in the name of the lord
[49:29] let's let's
[49:31] be
[49:32] standing and filled with the spirit
[49:37] this is unbelievable
[49:39] to realize that these social media
[49:41] things can have the possibility of
[49:43] actually a channel to bring physical
[49:45] illness to our children and anyone else
[49:49] should read this next sunday when all
[49:50] the young people are back
[49:52] not to be mean but we better have our
[49:55] guard or the holy spirit up
[49:59] it's unbelievable go ahead and read the
[50:01] article
[50:04] but there is a bomb in gilead
[50:08] if we don't feed on and take the
[50:10] medicine he has given us
[50:12] our minds can't make it
[50:15] blair park a christian writer wrote this
[50:18] he said a healing balm as i begin to
[50:20] talk about this and
[50:21] draw it down to a close i'm only at 12
[50:23] 24 got lots of time praise the lord i
[50:27] got lots of time left
[50:33] blair park wrote this a healing balm was
[50:35] used as medicinal solution
[50:38] in ancient times which was probably
[50:41] administered by a medical man or wise
[50:43] woman in a village to help cure many
[50:45] types of ailments these early
[50:47] investments into bombs allowed present
[50:50] day doctors and nurses to reach new
[50:51] depths of healing for several illnesses
[50:53] and diseases over the course of time it
[50:55] is safe to assume that there were
[50:56] healing bombs used in bible times as
[50:59] they are used today
[51:01] so in the book of jeremiah
[51:03] there was one balm in particular
[51:05] mentioned by jeremiah here at the bomb
[51:07] of gilead of which the prophet jeremiah
[51:09] asked god why he hadn't supplied this
[51:12] treasured bomb to help the healing of
[51:14] his people and their ways as we learn
[51:16] more about the bomb of gilead in the
[51:18] multiple ways it's discussed in the
[51:19] bible we will start to realize that the
[51:22] balm is also a metaphor for the only one
[51:26] who can save us from a disastrous fate
[51:29] jesus
[51:30] christ
[51:36] the bomb
[51:38] in gilead becomes the type
[51:40] of the blood
[51:42] our atonement
[51:43] what our lord did for us
[51:46] and when he provided the blood the
[51:48] atonement
[51:49] it provided for everything
[51:58] you got this term now marijuana is legal
[52:01] it's for medicinal purposes
[52:07] but then people run away from the holy
[52:08] ghost
[52:10] right they run away from the presence of
[52:12] god
[52:14] but you see it's
[52:15] the presence of the lord his blood his
[52:17] word
[52:18] is for medicinal purposes
[52:23] you come to church because of medicinal
[52:25] purposes
[52:28] you need medicine
[52:30] you need the balm
[52:34] so they have it in these things and they
[52:36] have a cream and all these different
[52:37] things this i just grabbed at home today
[52:39] coco
[52:40] because this is what i use
[52:42] this is when i get a sunburn
[52:44] and it slews the sunburn just puts it on
[52:47] there and
[52:48] you know
[52:48] it feels really good and it comes from
[52:51] some cocoa and plants and they put it
[52:53] all together and put it on there and i
[52:55] hurt my elbow yesterday bro bob and
[52:58] that's the kind of stuff i'll grab some
[53:00] of those bombs sometimes and or anchors
[53:02] that's a big one my father-in-law
[53:05] sells this is unkers and it's just for
[53:06] pain you know and it'll be the older
[53:08] people in here right that understand the
[53:11] little pains that comes you get a bomb
[53:13] or you get even if you get a cut there's
[53:15] stuff that you put on it that helps with
[53:18] the healing it helps soothe it can you
[53:20] say man
[53:21] for medicinal purposes
[53:23] amen and you can put it for whatever is
[53:26] aching in joints so he put it anywhere i
[53:28] just this is a simple illustration but
[53:30] i'm just saying that god did not leave
[53:32] anything out for spiritual sicknesses
[53:35] for mental sicknesses
[53:38] i'm going to take that off because
[53:39] you're not listening to me
[53:46] today we have it all for every part of
[53:48] the body for everything
[53:50] isn't that say something
[53:53] that the bomb and gilead the blood what
[53:55] god provided is still good today and
[53:57] it's provided for everything
[53:59] including mental illness
[54:02] including anxiety
[54:04] including depression
[54:06] including loneliness
[54:08] including the spirits and i mean it's
[54:10] got it all in it
[54:13] the blood of jesus christ didn't just
[54:14] cleanse you from your sins
[54:17] but there's power in the blood of the
[54:19] lamb
[54:20] for victory can you say amen there's
[54:23] power in the blood for protection
[54:29] why are you going to church well it's
[54:31] for medicinal purposes
[54:35] but it seems like you're just so bent on
[54:37] that you're so you're obsessed with
[54:39] going to church yes i am i'm obsessed
[54:41] with being in the word of god i'm
[54:43] obsessed with being in this presence
[54:45] i need the balm and gillian to heal me
[54:50] do you know how many texts i get and i
[54:52] say this not
[54:53] boasting but i thank god for the texts i
[54:55] get got one last night get them all the
[54:58] time people listening in and saying this
[55:01] the bride they're so let me just say
[55:03] this the balm in gilead
[55:05] was for people that were sick
[55:08] and however remember what jesus said
[55:11] when the pharisees criticized
[55:14] his disciples and criticized them he
[55:16] said to them i haven't come
[55:19] to
[55:20] for the whole the people that are well
[55:23] i've come for the sick.
[55:28] i've given my i'm going to give my
[55:29] atonement for the ones who are broken
[55:32] the ones who make mistakes the ones who
[55:34] come from a life of sin
[55:36] i've come for the ones who have mental
[55:38] illness i've come with the healing bomb
[55:41] for the ones who are having anxiety i
[55:43] didn't come for the ones the
[55:45] self-righteous pharisees that got it all
[55:47] together and they're perfect i didn't
[55:49] come for those this message is not for
[55:52] the perfect people it's for imperfect
[55:54] people
[55:57] and i get texts all the time last night
[55:59] thank you brother i wouldn't mention the
[56:01] name but thank you brother we've been
[56:02] watching for six months and he said my
[56:04] wife and i needed such healing we needed
[56:07] healing i think they had lost a son and
[56:09] and and so your ministry has provided
[56:12] such healing and when i hear that word i
[56:14] wrote i'm so grateful because it's not
[56:16] me it's god has provided healing for
[56:20] every disease
[56:22] healing for the wounded heart
[56:25] healing for damaged message people
[56:29] why are you using that term because
[56:30] there's a lot of damaged messes people
[56:32] that have tired of politics tired of the
[56:35] legalism tired of this and they're
[56:37] listening in because why they just want
[56:40] to hear this message without any strings
[56:43] attached to it no agendas just preach it
[56:47] the way god brought it can you say man
[56:49] let it do its work in your life
[56:55] healing can you say man
[56:58] healing
[56:59] let me find this one part of what why he
[57:02] said gilead and then we'll we'll be
[57:04] bringing it down here
[57:07] he goes on to say this writer blair park
[57:11] he says i'm reading this christian
[57:13] writer here because it inspired me it
[57:15] was wonderful
[57:16] he said some good things
[57:21] he said
[57:22] as we learn more about the bomb of
[57:24] gilead
[57:26] and the multiple ways it's discussed in
[57:28] the bible we will start to realize that
[57:30] the bomb is also a metaphor for the only
[57:33] one that could save us from a disastrous
[57:34] fate jesus christ the place of gilead is
[57:37] recognized in the bible for being listen
[57:40] to this now and you're believers so
[57:42] you'll catch this the origin of it
[57:43] because to me
[57:45] you won't value the balm and the message
[57:48] and whatever we call it you won't value
[57:50] it unless you know the source of it so
[57:54] when jeremiah says is there an obama and
[57:56] gilead there was a bomb in gilead but
[57:58] why did he that's the first time in the
[57:59] bible that he mentions a bomb for
[58:01] israel's spiritual healing and he
[58:02] mentions the mountain of gilead the city
[58:04] of gilead why did he attach the bomb to
[58:06] gilead and that's why i started to
[58:08] research why why gilead what's so
[58:11] special about gilead you see you have to
[58:13] recognize the source of where our bomb
[58:15] comes from and when you know the source
[58:18] the source of it then you have value for
[58:21] it to listen to it to feed on it to to
[58:24] get in the presence of it to expose
[58:26] yourself to it whatever you can do
[58:28] you're going to be doing that more
[58:30] because you see the value this is the
[58:32] source this is where it comes from and
[58:34] the bomb of gilead is used multiple
[58:36] times but he said the place is
[58:39] he says it's it's it's
[58:41] the place of gilead is recognized in the
[58:44] bible
[58:45] for being number one the birthplace of
[58:48] elijah
[58:54] the balm of gilead
[58:56] the first place
[58:58] first reason it was which it's the
[58:59] birthplace of elijah
[59:03] amen
[59:04] the second reason gileads mentioned
[59:06] second thing that happened there is the
[59:08] place that jacob and laban met
[59:12] so if you don't know the story quickly
[59:13] jacob jacob he you know the lord calls
[59:16] him abraham isaac jacob he's got the
[59:19] promise over his life the same promise
[59:21] as abraham so jacob goes out he's going
[59:24] to find a wife and so he's he's laban
[59:27] has these two daughters
[59:28] he
[59:29] laban ends up deceiving him
[59:31] and then jacob's the deceiver so he
[59:33] deceives his father-in-law a bit he ends
[59:35] up with
[59:36] leah
[59:37] he wanted the racist they worked another
[59:38] seven years you know the story of god
[59:40] goes so then when everything prospers
[59:42] under jacob because the son of god the
[59:44] sheep and everything prospered that he
[59:45] decides i'm going to get out of here i'm
[59:47] going to go back to my home country so
[59:48] he grabs his wives his children his
[59:50] cattle everything and he sneaks out
[59:52] without telling laban his father-in-law
[59:54] and he sneaks out and heads and gets all
[59:57] the way down the road here and laban
[59:59] finds out about it he says i'm going
[1:00:01] after him get you get your things boys
[1:00:03] we're going to go after him we're going
[1:00:04] to we're going to do him in
[1:00:06] i'm going to be real quick with this he
[1:00:08] gets there
[1:00:09] to gilead
[1:00:11] and he's getting ready to take jacob out
[1:00:14] and god comes to laban in a dream
[1:00:18] and says
[1:00:19] don't
[1:00:20] say anything good or bad
[1:00:23] to jacob
[1:00:25] in other words
[1:00:26] keep your hands off of him
[1:00:28] don't touch him
[1:00:30] you remember that happened with
[1:00:32] abraham and isaac when they went down
[1:00:34] into when he went down into gorier and
[1:00:36] the king's going to marry his wife
[1:00:38] and god comes to the dream and said if
[1:00:40] you touch that woman you're a dead man
[1:00:45] but lord he lied to me he said it was
[1:00:48] his sister
[1:00:50] so i'm free i know what he said
[1:00:52] i know abraham lied
[1:00:54] i'll take care of him
[1:00:56] but he's my son and he's under a promise
[1:01:00] you touch his life you're a dead man
[1:01:02] you're finished
[1:01:03] i want you to notice now
[1:01:06] the protection
[1:01:08] that goes with the balm and gilead
[1:01:13] friends i'm here to tell you
[1:01:15] that there are times
[1:01:17] when you're clinging to this word
[1:01:19] that you do not know
[1:01:21] the protections god has watched over you
[1:01:24] and your family
[1:01:26] you do not know some incidences where
[1:01:29] things could have happened and god
[1:01:31] stepped in and protected you from it
[1:01:34] why because it's the bauman gilead and
[1:01:36] he said to laban he said you don't talk
[1:01:39] to him so the next day he just basically
[1:01:40] approaches it
[1:01:42] why'd you take my daughter's why jesus
[1:01:43] he's asking the question but he wasn't
[1:01:45] going to kill him because god had talked
[1:01:46] to him so all i'm saying is that when
[1:01:48] there's a promised son of god and he's
[1:01:50] under the promise that the covenant with
[1:01:52] god in other words he didn't make it was
[1:01:54] an unconditional covenant that was
[1:01:56] holding over jacob's life abraham's life
[1:01:58] isaac's life and when you have that
[1:02:00] covenant over your life there's a
[1:02:02] protection that goes there's a bomb in
[1:02:05] gilead and it's not just about elijah's
[1:02:08] message or elijah it's about a
[1:02:10] protection from demon powers that are
[1:02:12] hounding you laban was hounding and
[1:02:15] going after him and god steps in and
[1:02:18] says you're not gonna take him keep your
[1:02:20] hands off of him how many times when
[1:02:22] you're struggling
[1:02:24] in your mind and demons are coming and
[1:02:26] affecting your mind and you just pray
[1:02:28] and say god help me i feel too weak to
[1:02:30] handle this
[1:02:31] how many times has god stepped in it
[1:02:33] could have went further and god steps
[1:02:35] into the demon power and says that's
[1:02:37] enough
[1:02:40] you know why you know he does this
[1:02:42] you know why i know
[1:02:43] because i just preached it in the word
[1:02:45] god will do it for a son and daughter of
[1:02:46] god what does this bomb have in it
[1:02:51] what kind of power does it have in it
[1:02:53] that even sometimes we can't see
[1:02:57] the protections that's been put in place
[1:03:01] and god steps in for us
[1:03:05] all right the last thing
[1:03:08] that's in gilead
[1:03:11] prophet elijah's birthplace
[1:03:14] jacob and laban meet which means the
[1:03:16] protection of the lord from demons that
[1:03:18] we don't have power over the demons that
[1:03:20] we cannot they're hounding us and coming
[1:03:23] after us how many raise your hand says
[1:03:24] sometimes if he likes demons are
[1:03:26] hounding me
[1:03:28] there's a bomb in gilead
[1:03:30] there's a protection in the token
[1:03:34] hallelujah
[1:03:35] the last thing
[1:03:38] that happened in gideon is it was the
[1:03:40] battlefield
[1:03:43] in gibby in in
[1:03:46] gilead
[1:03:48] it was the battlefield of gideon and the
[1:03:50] midianites
[1:03:52] where gideon was named
[1:03:54] the victor
[1:03:57] so in our bomb
[1:03:59] in our atonement is not just forgiveness
[1:04:02] of sins
[1:04:04] but it's protection from demon power
[1:04:07] and you know what else
[1:04:09] it's victory for the believer
[1:04:12] there's victory in it
[1:04:15] there's victory in it
[1:04:18] why did jeremiah call for it the first
[1:04:20] time a balm and gillian
[1:04:22] well he just makes the secrets known
[1:04:25] to his prophets and there what he said
[1:04:28] in the bomb and gilead if the israelites
[1:04:30] or the people in jerusalem would have
[1:04:32] taken their bibles
[1:04:33] and they would have researched it when
[1:04:35] he said bomb and gilead kind of what i
[1:04:37] did the other night most people said
[1:04:38] okay bauman gilead no i want to say why
[1:04:40] did he call it the bomb gillian and he'd
[1:04:41] get there if they'd got their bibles out
[1:04:43] if they'd got their scrolls out whatever
[1:04:45] it was and they had to research it they
[1:04:47] would have seen wow
[1:04:49] this bomb
[1:04:51] for him to heal us has power behind it
[1:04:54] it has elijah behind it
[1:04:57] it's got a lot of stuff in it it's got
[1:04:59] protection from demons in it we ought to
[1:05:01] be interested in that
[1:05:04] but it's got victory in it
[1:05:06] and the thing about gideon i'd like to
[1:05:07] preach on him another hour because
[1:05:09] gideon was the underdog gideon was the
[1:05:11] guy with complexes gideon was the guy
[1:05:13] when god said you're a mighty man of
[1:05:14] valor and you're going to go up and give
[1:05:15] the midianites yourself he wasn't even
[1:05:17] anybody great nobody knew him and he
[1:05:19] said lord you've got the wrong gideon
[1:05:21] it's not me it's who are you talking to
[1:05:24] if i am not a mighty man of valor and
[1:05:27] and god said yes you are and gideon said
[1:05:29] no i am not i'm the least among my
[1:05:32] family i don't have any money and he
[1:05:34] kept bringing up excuses and excuses and
[1:05:37] excuses constantly his complexes i'm not
[1:05:40] strong enough to handle the midianites
[1:05:42] myself you got the wrong guy and god
[1:05:44] kept saying no i got the right guy
[1:05:48] and every time he would be bring up an
[1:05:49] excuse i'm not strong enough for this
[1:05:51] i'm not the guy i must not be like the
[1:05:53] other believers i'm not strong enough to
[1:05:56] to overcome these things every time he
[1:05:58] brought up god never sympathized with
[1:06:00] him god never had a pity party with him
[1:06:02] god just had the book of life right in
[1:06:04] front of him and the only thing he could
[1:06:06] read in the book of life was
[1:06:08] gideon
[1:06:09] here's your name bud
[1:06:12] i wish gideon was here get in listen up
[1:06:15] here's your name in the book of life
[1:06:17] gideon
[1:06:19] semicolon
[1:06:23] mighty man of valor
[1:06:28] but that's not me
[1:06:30] i don't have any money and my i'm the
[1:06:32] least of my brother and i don't have any
[1:06:35] strength to be able to do this
[1:06:37] and god didn't go say really oh okay
[1:06:40] maybe i better choose somebody else
[1:06:44] god does not have a pity party with you
[1:06:47] with your complexes and all your excuses
[1:06:50] for not serving god he's looking at one
[1:06:52] thing and that's the book of life
[1:06:55] your name in the book of life and if
[1:06:58] you're in there whatever it says you
[1:07:01] will be victorious
[1:07:05] but lord i'm not mighty man of hour but
[1:07:07] lord this mighty man of valor
[1:07:10] it's the only thing it says it doesn't
[1:07:12] read anything else your complexes aren't
[1:07:14] even in here gideon
[1:07:16] come on saints
[1:07:18] your mistakes aren't in here
[1:07:20] you're feeling the least of your
[1:07:21] families not in here your complexes
[1:07:24] aren't even mentioned in the book of
[1:07:26] life
[1:07:31] why are you giving so much time to them
[1:07:35] those things aren't in the book of life
[1:07:37] that's your other life that's your
[1:07:38] former life my new book can you say amen
[1:07:41] the new book of life your new marriage
[1:07:44] certificate brother adam says
[1:07:48] that old husband is dead that old life
[1:07:50] is dead
[1:07:51] amen
[1:07:53] it's none of your accomplice that's why
[1:07:55] all abraham's mistakes are in the old
[1:07:57] testament
[1:07:58] and none of them are mentioned in the
[1:07:59] new testament
[1:08:01] oh he says he was a man of faith he
[1:08:03] staggered not at the promises of god
[1:08:06] did you know that none of his mistakes
[1:08:08] none of going to career none of lying
[1:08:11] none of
[1:08:13] all the stuff that he did
[1:08:15] david all the it's it's gone it's gone
[1:08:19] and if it's gone for them it's gone for
[1:08:21] me
[1:08:24] talking about what's in the bomb this
[1:08:25] morning
[1:08:26] and i think you've got it
[1:08:29] i'm going to have prayer for you this
[1:08:30] way anyone who wants prayer you know
[1:08:32] what i'm going to do i'm going to apply
[1:08:33] the bomb
[1:08:38] i have a bomb here this morning for your
[1:08:41] healing
[1:08:43] what do we do when we have bomb we apply
[1:08:45] it
[1:08:46] what do we do have when we have the
[1:08:48] token we apply it
[1:08:50] don't come to church together praise the
[1:08:52] lord we got the token no you got to go
[1:08:54] home and apply it
[1:08:55] read the token
[1:08:56] it's not just having the token it's the
[1:08:58] application of the token i kicked this
[1:09:00] out and i kicked that out and i apply
[1:09:02] these things i'm applying the blood to
[1:09:04] my home
[1:09:05] so if you've got a a bomb you've got a
[1:09:08] soothing sauce salve
[1:09:11] it's not going to do you any good until
[1:09:13] you apply it
[1:09:15] in the balm
[1:09:17] first coming of christ and i'm closing
[1:09:20] first coming of christ what did it start
[1:09:21] with
[1:09:23] elijah
[1:09:30] i didn't finish on gideon
[1:09:32] he finally got the strength man i tell
[1:09:34] you i gotta finish stuff he got the
[1:09:36] strength
[1:09:38] and he went
[1:09:39] and there was
[1:09:41] he had 32 000 soldiers with him
[1:09:45] and they were getting ready to take the
[1:09:47] many nights and he felt pretty
[1:09:48] comfortable with doing it
[1:09:50] he still was a guy who liked fleeces i'm
[1:09:52] going to put out a fleece and god got
[1:09:54] anger in him god get angry at him
[1:09:56] because he's asking for these please i
[1:09:57] just need a little more confirmation i
[1:09:59] know i'm the one i'm in the book of life
[1:10:01] but could you just confirm it one more
[1:10:03] time a lot of people are fleece oriented
[1:10:05] like gideon was that's fine i can't find
[1:10:08] too much of it in the bible because when
[1:10:10] god tells you to do something his word
[1:10:11] you should just go do it
[1:10:13] but if i just get a i'm going to put a
[1:10:15] fleece out before the lord
[1:10:17] and guess what god gave it to him said
[1:10:19] keep encouraging him
[1:10:21] so he gets asked for a fleece but then
[1:10:22] he's got 32 000 men and he's getting
[1:10:24] ready to go take the minionites and god
[1:10:26] says you got too many because if you go
[1:10:29] with 32 000 some of your soldiers are
[1:10:31] going to say we did this we did it and
[1:10:34] i'm not going to let anybody say we did
[1:10:36] it
[1:10:36] i want the glory to go to me to god
[1:10:40] under your leadership gideon i want him
[1:10:42] to give glory so so he knocks down
[1:10:44] knocks it down
[1:10:46] to takes away ten thousand now he's got
[1:10:48] twenty two thousand hope i'm writing
[1:10:50] these numbers i'm sure some people
[1:10:51] correct me out
[1:10:52] but you see now
[1:10:54] then
[1:10:55] he's ready to go with twenty two
[1:10:56] thousand god says you still have too
[1:10:57] many people
[1:10:59] and gets them down on the water those
[1:11:00] that lapped up the water you know the
[1:11:02] story those loud and he's left with
[1:11:04] brother bob he's left with 300 men out
[1:11:06] of 32 000.
[1:11:10] this
[1:11:11] this is the bomb and gilead this is what
[1:11:12] happened in gilead this is the teaching
[1:11:14] in gilead is that my bomb my victory for
[1:11:18] you
[1:11:19] my victory
[1:11:20] is not going to be something that you
[1:11:23] had to do with
[1:11:26] i'm going to eliminate
[1:11:28] all the chances for you to say i did
[1:11:31] this
[1:11:32] but you're going to have a victory
[1:11:34] you're going to
[1:11:36] end with a victory in this
[1:11:37] runs in there with 300 men and overcome
[1:11:39] them won the battle
[1:11:41] gideon became a great hero and that all
[1:11:44] happened
[1:11:45] in gilead the mount gilead and so the
[1:11:49] last day's message excuse me
[1:11:52] second first coming of christ
[1:11:57] i gotta end
[1:11:59] first coming of christ started with
[1:12:00] elijah can you say amen
[1:12:03] start with elijah
[1:12:09] and then
[1:12:12] i was just looking here for a couple
[1:12:14] quotes and looking for something here
[1:12:15] that
[1:12:16] that was related because you see the
[1:12:17] same
[1:12:19] elements within the first coming of
[1:12:21] christ
[1:12:23] and that is it started with elijah so in
[1:12:26] the bomb is elijah in his message to
[1:12:28] introduce the messiah
[1:12:31] and then
[1:12:35] we find that
[1:12:36] jesus was protected
[1:12:41] from the demonic power even though they
[1:12:43] were out to get him
[1:12:46] jesus went in a boat
[1:12:48] and satan got in the winds is we're
[1:12:49] gonna i'm gonna destroy him brother says
[1:12:51] i'm gonna destroy that because he's in
[1:12:52] the boat i'm gonna destroy that vessel
[1:12:54] trying to kill jesus and all the time
[1:12:57] god god just uses him he stands up and
[1:12:59] says peace be still he had control of
[1:13:01] the demons but he couldn't take jesus
[1:13:04] because he was protected
[1:13:07] same elements can you say amen
[1:13:09] and then christ in the first coming goes
[1:13:11] to calvary goes to a resurrection
[1:13:14] and i like that song they saying the
[1:13:15] other week that choir said
[1:13:18] god has the final say
[1:13:23] god has the final say
[1:13:26] god
[1:13:27] got the final victory
[1:13:29] in jesus in the first coming who got the
[1:13:32] final victory it looked like calvary
[1:13:33] looked like satan did and then the
[1:13:34] resurrection proved
[1:13:36] he got the final victory
[1:13:39] you may go through anxiety
[1:13:41] you may go through hard times
[1:13:43] you may go through your mind it's not
[1:13:45] straightened out you may go through
[1:13:46] sicknesses cancer disease you may go
[1:13:48] through a lot of things
[1:13:50] but guess what
[1:13:51] you stay feeding on this balm and this
[1:13:54] this
[1:13:55] salve and this atonement
[1:13:57] i could i can tell you safely you're
[1:14:00] going to get the final victory
[1:14:03] because in this bomb you get the final
[1:14:05] victory
[1:14:08] the message of the last days
[1:14:10] the second coming of christ opens with
[1:14:12] elijah again
[1:14:15] introducing the elijah spirit comes with
[1:14:16] a great message it's part of our
[1:14:18] atonement it's part of the word that he
[1:14:20] brought and then
[1:14:23] there's a protection over elijah there's
[1:14:25] a quote and go away
[1:14:26] jesus he says in the angel the man with
[1:14:29] his back to the tent why did sarah laugh
[1:14:31] and she said she ran out and confessed i
[1:14:33] didn't say that she lie but you did now
[1:14:35] god could have took sarah sarah's life
[1:14:38] right there but he couldn't hurt her for
[1:14:40] she was part of abraham oh we'd be gone
[1:14:43] long ago if it wasn't part of christ all
[1:14:45] the things that he's done and we went
[1:14:47] around and said it's telepathy it's this
[1:14:49] that the other the message is this the
[1:14:51] message is occult all these other things
[1:14:53] you see
[1:14:54] sometimes people say things but don't
[1:14:56] give up hope to them
[1:14:58] something people get under an influence
[1:15:00] of somebody else
[1:15:04] you can say a lot of things
[1:15:06] it's telepathy it's this out there but
[1:15:08] he can't touch you see wrath can't touch
[1:15:11] you because you're part of christ when
[1:15:13] you're born again you see he couldn't do
[1:15:15] it it's because it hurt abraham i'm
[1:15:17] saying this for when the devil tells you
[1:15:20] they're hounding you they're after you
[1:15:21] and you're going to be overwhelmed and
[1:15:23] you're going to be overcome and you're
[1:15:24] going to be outnumbered but i'm telling
[1:15:25] you in our atonement when we're
[1:15:27] outnumbered we're not outnumbered god
[1:15:30] has a spirit there holding back the
[1:15:32] demons
[1:15:35] he couldn't do it because it hurt
[1:15:36] abraham his promise was to abraham and
[1:15:39] sarah was a part of abraham and the
[1:15:40] church is a part of christ the bride see
[1:15:43] he couldn't do it although her unbelief
[1:15:46] she had unbelief she made mistakes but
[1:15:48] because she was part of the covenant
[1:15:50] with abraham judgment
[1:15:52] even the judgment of god couldn't touch
[1:15:54] her the judgments of the world demons
[1:15:56] couldn't touch you i'm here to tell you
[1:15:58] if you haven't understood it yet that in
[1:15:59] our bomb in our atonement is not just
[1:16:02] the word of elijah but there's a
[1:16:04] protection for our children for our
[1:16:07] families from demonic power to be able
[1:16:10] to come in and take over
[1:16:12] because we're under the covenant and the
[1:16:14] last thing is victory in the bride at
[1:16:17] the last days we're going to get a
[1:16:19] victory and the thing about jesus the
[1:16:21] thing about gideon he was the underdog
[1:16:23] but he got the victory anyway
[1:16:26] the thing about jesus at calvary he went
[1:16:28] to calvary alone it looked like he was
[1:16:30] the underdog but he got the victory
[1:16:31] anyway
[1:16:33] so in the last days the bride the bride
[1:16:37] is going to get the final say
[1:16:41] out of satan's eden there's going to be
[1:16:42] a bride and god's going to get the final
[1:16:44] victory through that bride there's going
[1:16:46] to be a victory because in our atonement
[1:16:48] it's the final say the final victory
[1:16:50] last quote sister genie if you have it
[1:16:52] there and then you can come to a church
[1:16:54] where they're trying to preach the
[1:16:55] gospel and to demonstrate the power of
[1:16:57] the holy ghost they call us holy rotors
[1:17:00] and write them up and all kinds of
[1:17:01] things that they can say about them
[1:17:03] shows the devils on the rampage but
[1:17:05] god's church will never fail she'll move
[1:17:09] from victory unto victory until jesus
[1:17:12] comes for his bride hallelujah i'm going
[1:17:15] to read that again god's church will
[1:17:18] never fail
[1:17:22] i said god's church
[1:17:24] will never fail
[1:17:26] gideon you can't fail
[1:17:29] you will beat the midianites because
[1:17:30] that's what the book of life says you'll
[1:17:32] do and i don't care if the hounds or
[1:17:34] hell are speaking to your mind god's
[1:17:36] church will never fail and she'll move
[1:17:39] from victory unto victory until jesus
[1:17:43] comes for his bride and the rapture will
