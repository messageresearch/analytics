it's time to move my God is B better stronger greater than better strong Gater than bigger better stronger greater than biger better stronger greater thaner better stronger greater than bigger better stronger biger than you Matthew chapter 6 we'll just pick it up there's so many good things in here but we'll just have a section here yes verse six would be good but thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou has shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly and then further in prayer when you pray use not vain repetitions as the Heathen do for they think they shall be heard for their much speaking it's not quantity of words it's the quality of words it's not just that you're praying but it's the faith behind your prayer and this is speaking of an effective prayer how many this morning want a effective prayer when you pray and and so then he says be not ye therefore like unto them for your father knoweth what things you have need of before you ask after this manner there pray ye Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen and that's usually how we end it when we repeat the Lord's Prayer here but it's not finished yet it's says in verse 14 for if you forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you forgiveness is part of the faith of your prayer but if you forgive not men your trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses and then we move to Mark 11 that we read uh last Sunday Mark 11 uh the Mountain Moving faith and speaking to the mountain in verse of chapter 11 and verse uh um 23 ver I say to you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shalt not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith cometh to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you what things soever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and ye shall have them and when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses there's trespasses again that's mentioned but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses I want to speak this morning on the word removing the trespasses to move mountains so brothers and sisters we have another place here that I'd like to teach and preach out of this morning another place in the scripture from what we Le read last Sunday in the Mountain Moving scri scripture and that we speak to the mountain and that type of faith that we could come to to speak to the mountains and they would be removed that's what we desire in our hearts but we have another place in this that this is mentioned our faith is mentioned with the word forgiveness and the theme of forgiveness faith and the prayer of faith is linked in both of these texts with forgiveness and the word uh releasing trespasses and so I want to talk about that this morning because these two places link our faith with the Forgiveness of our heart and there are many other places that I want to get to that the scripture bring these things in and whenever you're talking about faith you must speak about the whole picture of Faith so that we can be in a position of faith and that we can be the right heart for more faith to work through us and God to anoint our faith we must position ourselves to have perfect faith and we must as the scripture is uh showing us we must for Mountain Moving faith we must acknowledge the things that would be in our heart the a that we have against others or the trespasses either that we have done towards God or towards other people or that people have trespassed against us we cannot approach Faith the right way until we approach the the subject of forgiveness and releasing of trespasses can you say amen and this is another scripture that show us because in this particular scripture they they came the disciples as they were watching Jesus pray they came to him after he was done praying and said Lord teach us to pray now the Sun the Sunday school has got the theme this month of prayer so I want to be working in coordination with that as they teach our children about prayer and what prayer is and that we should pray what a powerful thing to teach children can you say Amen that they have access to God that they can speak to the Lord that they don't have to go through a priest but they can utter things from their hearts straight to him and they can hear back from him isn't that a wonderful thing this is the Christian Journey this is what it's all about it's not about all what we wear or church order and these other things but it's that I want to live a life that when I go to God I can pray a whole through to heaven and he can hear my prayer and he can answer back to me amen praise the Lord so now uh the word uh trespasses brought into these and so now they came and asked Jesus teach us to pray Lord would you teach us to pray because they had learned why are they asking Jesus to teach us to pray because they had learned his prayer got through to God can you say Amen they had watched his life they had watched this vessel they had been around him and when and when he's over there in the corner and he's bowed at his knees and he's praying maybe for an hour or two hours and they left him alone they knew these prayers had a different thing now I want I want you to notice something I don't think that the disciples had never prayed before and that's why they were asking him teach us how to pray these were Jews these the Jews prayed to God they prayed to Jehovah they knew that they that that was part of their lives to pray they went into the temple and they prayed and and and and so uh it's it's not they were asking to teach us to pray because they didn't pray but they knew God's Jesus prayers got through they knew Jesus prayers got through and and you know if you ask people in the world you know that's the thing is that everybody prays and that's a good thing I'm not being critical of it but if you ask a sinner sometimes they'll say to you unless they're an atheist and don't believe in God yeah I pray every day I'm always praying to God and so prayer is a common thing to speak to the Lord and and all these other things but you see now Believers today we have to to look at it a little deeper than just saying a prayer how many knows there's a difference in saying a prayer and praying how many knows there's a difference in just saying a prayer at your meal something like that that's wonderful you should do that but there is a difference in saying a prayer and sometimes even a an orthodox prayer a prayer that's a repetitive prayer and it's the same prayer that you repeat and it becomes a tradition that's a big difference in somebody entering into real prayer and praying the prayer of faith and I don't mean to make it something complicated but we must find the prayer of faith especially in the hour that we live in listen friends I'm just going to say it to you we are dealing in Troublesome times we are experiencing demon power like I've never seen it before and if you are engaged in the battle and serving the lord and believing this word and standing ING with it every day and trying then you're facing things that you never faced before the devil as soon as you make a step the devil's going to fight against it and besides this there's Darkness upon the Earth but also on the minds of the people there's an oppression there's a depression there's there's an an oppressing uh spirits that come against you to bring Darkness into your life that you can't even have joy anymore you can't even enjoy moments anymore we're living under an oppression can you say amen and there is no theology there is no psychology that is strong enough to pierce the darkness of this mental depression it takes prayer of faith to pray a whole through to the sky amen it takes getting a hold of God can you say Amen praise the Lord and so they prayed before but they said Lord teach us to pray and I believe a Believer has hunger especially when he sees here prayer that showed results I believe it's the Believers that they wanted to say a prayer like Jesus to be able to get results they they said teach us to pray and it didn't mean that they never didn't mean that we haven't ever prayed before doesn't mean the world says they pray no that means they were hungry for this kind of results from the father what's happening uh teach me what's happening Lord When you pray what something happens your prayer is getting through uh something happens when you pray something happens when you speak there's a power behind you and listen now Jesus had thousands of people around him watching this go on and none of them desired to come and ask Jesus to to teach us to pray but Believers when they see that they say Lord there's something in me teach me that I can pray this way teach me Lord teach me Lord I I I want to I want to grow it's only Believers saying that the the rest of the world say I'll just say my prayers and I'm fine with that but Believers are saying no no I want my prayers to get through I want to hear back from God can I get an amen this morning we need a God that shows up and answers back we got too many young people without the Holy Ghost we got too many oppressing spirits we got too many mental battles I'm telling you we need a God that answers back we got too many Devils fighting against families fighting against marriages we got too much upon us just to have church and just to have a religion we've got to have the prayer of faith that gets through and no wonder people text us brother Brandon and I and the brothers and say put this request on let the people know let the people pray for us because we got confidence somebody in that congregation is going to get through to [Applause] God and I believe this is what we're going to be learning to depend on as the days are coming the economy is going to fall apart we got brothers that's feeling the pressure in this congregation having to work second and third jobs might even have to put the wife to work things like this we got gra grocery prices up 60% we've got all this damage and it's it's not prophesied to get any better so we got pressures that are still coming we're hoping for a relief and I pray there is too but listen now if it if it if there's not a relief to some of the pressure and the insecurity of jobs and income and everything else we're going to have to learn to depend on something come on now it's easy if you got a really good job right now you're making good money it's easy okay yeah I I know but see when you feel the crunch of it we will be driven into a spot to depend on God like we've never depended on him before and I want to be positioned that my prayer counts now I know God hears our prayer but we can read that God hears our prayer but what we need a God that answers back we need a God who answers back praise the Lord and so now uh you know when Sons let me just stop here a minute when sons of God are coming back to Jesus and asking him to teach us you know what that says that shows that they there are sons that want to move to their position and to adoption because adoption adoped said and how many know there's a difference in a birth of a son and an adoption of a son there's some ministers that speak it when you're born again and you receive the Holy Ghost you're a fully adopted son I don't think there's enough scripture to support that or message I believe you're birthed into the kingdom and you grow to an adopted son the very reason you have the Holy Ghost is to bring you to maturity and adoption and bring you to a Rapture you won't make a Rapture without the Holy Ghost but when you receive the Holy Ghost it is the spirit of adoption to take you to adoption and part of the thing of adoption is the separation between is this a son who's teachable from the father to learn Lord I want to do what you do now there's nothing wrong with the son saying to Jesus I you're the Son of God you're the only begotten son but I want to do what you're doing I want the faith that you have I want you to teach me how to be that kind of son I want you to teach me how to pray like you're praying come on and guess what you might not feel worthy to ask that but Sons God has made you worthy to ask the father can you say Amen Lord I'm teachable adopted sons are teachable remember he brings that whole thing out of you know in the Old Testament the Hebrews that the boy when he was young he was a son born into a family but then he's put under a tutor to train him and teach him the father's way teach him the father's business and if it's a son that was rebellious he's still son he's still a son but it's like he could Rebel for years I don't want that I don't want to become like that I want to do something else but when Once the son becomes teachable then the tutor can come back and report to the father and say how's my boy how's my boy by he's so teachable he's he's wanting to learn he's wanting to learn the business of the father he's wanting to become like you can you say amen and when he shows that teachable Spirit somewhere along the line there's an adoption ceremony to say this son I am pleased with how many know there was an adoption ceremony with Jesus sir and what was the adoption the adoption wasn't just a feeling and build three Tabernacles in fact God said don't build Peter James no we're not building Tabernacles we're not building a system to oursel this is about adoption I'm pleased with my son to fill him completely this is my son in whom I'm well pleased this is my desire so it's not a problem for you to come and ask the father to teach you you know why the disciples could feel comfortable doing that because all along Jesus said the works that I do shall you do also right he kept dropping this in and saying now I'm doing this but the works I to do all the sons will do those works oh somebody say praise the Lord don't get quiet on me this morning this is the word of God and I'm talking about you I'm talking about you not somebody sitting next to you I'm talking about you if we're Sons we're in a different category and if we're teachable he'll teach us to position oursel in faith to bring the prayer of faith when you lay your hands on that child with a fever you pray the pray the prayer of faith and so they could ask because Jesus kept hinting and saying listen what I'm doing where I go you will go also he's telling the sons whatever I'm doing so that must have been a stir in their hearts to say I am a son I believe I'm a son and I will do the things that he will do and Sons that are trainable are humble they're humble to admit they're wrong adopted sons that are trainable and wanting to move to adoption their sons are trainable they're humble they admit they are wrong they admit I have been doing things for the Lord maybe even for years but I want to go deeper here's another thing adopted Sons do in their in their teachableness and that is uh you know they want the will of God they want to be truly led by the will of God because they've learned in their immaturity they made decisions in their life sometimes that they called the will of God but they found out it wasn't it was my own will right and so sons that come sober up to say wait a minute I'm a Son of God here Lord teach me how mature because I have learned not only do I want to be taught to pray the prayer of faith but I want to walk truly in the will of God I want to walk like Jesus he said I do nothing except my father shows me and I know he's seen it by Vision but we catch the vision of what God wants to do for his will we want to walk in his will because we've experienced maybe what it is to walk out of his will or sometimes the famous line that comes from people I'm a good person I pray uh you know how many Sinners have Justified self to say I pray to God all the time but there's no change there's no change in their prayer and then sons are teachable to come and say Lord I I I want to walk in your will I want to be uh uh in not only pray the right prayer Faith but I want to walk um it's a son that's saying that it's immature sons that that that is that is uh trying to always fight for their own will can you say amen and trying to make it God's will but they're saying I I truly want God's will can you say Amen sons are teachable Sons do not no longer want to say and you know God gets blamed for a lot of things that we do wrong right because it's God told me to do this and God told me to that and God to if I hear a lot of that attaching God to it it's fine but you better make sure God's really LED you to do that because we feel more comfortable we bring God in God into it and guess what your counselor your pastor is not going to come up against to try to correct you when you say God told you to do it I back off I don't want to be coming against God but how many times years down the road we were and God gets blamed for a lot of stuff we did can I get a witness this morning can I get some people that admit to sometimes doing this we attach we better be careful that we don't attach so things to God we better make sure but mature Sons want to say Lord mature me that I'm not just always pursuing make me teachable especially when there's my prayer I want to be like Jesus but most of all I want my prayer to shake things up I want my prayer to move the heart of God can you say Amen one day the disciples prayed for an epileptic child and they didn't get into results in Matthew 17:14 it says and when they were come to the multitude there came him a certain man kneeling down to him and saying Lord have mercy on my son for he's a lunatic and sore vexed for oftimes he falleth Into the Fire and of into the water Matthew 17:16 and I brought him to thy disciples and they could not cure him then Jesus answered said oh faithless and perverse generation how long shall I be with you how long shall I suffer you bring him th hither to me and Jesus rebuked the devil and he departed out of him and the child was cured from that very hour then came the disciples to Jesus apart and said why could we not cast him out and Jesus said to them because of your unbelief for verily I say unto you if you have faith as a grain of a Mustard Seed ye shall say to this mountain remove hint To Yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you how be it this kind goeth not out but by fasting and by prayer so now you could attach yourself just to the fasting and prayer you say okay I need to do more prayer and more fasting I believe that doesn't say how much you fast I believe it's a dedication it's a positioning yourself to be available to God with all things cleared up from your heart that you could pray the prayer of bringing the impossible God in impossible situations the disciples weren't there yet but he says because of your unbelief there's still too much in your heart there's still too much there and he says but when you pray you can move mountains you know he's hinting you're going to come to this oh praise the Lord you're going to come to this kind of Faith you're going to come and when you do you could say Mountain be removed and cast into the sea and nothing shall be impossible nothing shall be impossible to you they were not there yet of course they needed the Holy Ghost which would bring them faith in their part to speak to mountains but he didn't say oh you know Jesus didn't say when they come to him and they prayed for this epileptic and nothing happened Jesus did not say oh you guys are you're losers you'll never get this you will never have this no he said you don't have perfect faith yet but you will get it if if your position is right and you know who you are standing with the token nothing shall stand before your prayer nothing shall be impossible to you thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information please contact us by visiting our website literall life. church and if you would like to
