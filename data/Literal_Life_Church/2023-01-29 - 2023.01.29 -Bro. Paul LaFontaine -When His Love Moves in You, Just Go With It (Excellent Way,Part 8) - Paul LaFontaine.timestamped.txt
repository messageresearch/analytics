[0:06] amen especially for the people of God
[0:09] praise the Lord I'm broken this morning
[0:11] because if you knew the testimony of my

[1:12] so that it's not churches as usual but
[1:14] that he's here and he's he's aware and

[2:09] of the particularly older retired
[2:11] couples in the church if you can go in
[2:13] certainly encourage you to go it would
[2:15] be a great trip amen I want to mention
[2:18] with the deacons that we ask you to keep
[2:20] the talking in the other places minimal
[2:22] before the service just a handshake and
[2:24] a greeting and keep the talking down and
[2:27] there's two places that you should be in
[2:29] here in the church church and preparing
[2:30] for the service so there's an adult
[2:32] Sunday school class that you can be a
[2:34] part of that's a great class so either
[2:36] of those two places where your children
[2:38] in Sunday school would be great rather

[4:27] a lovely time there and a wonderful
[4:28] group of people and Saints there we
[4:30] appreciate it and then yesterday we were
[4:32] at a luncheon with the local pastors and
[4:35] ministers and I'll just say it was a
[4:37] sweet time of unity and fellowship we
[4:39] really enjoyed it and we're just still
[4:42] basking in that from yesterday it was a
[4:43] wonderful time with some of the pastors
[4:45] and ministers we need to see that Unity
[4:47] amongst us and the churches it's not a
[4:50] time to divide it's a time to come
[4:52] together can you say amen and we want to
[4:54] do that and encourage Fellowship we may

[5:12] portion of scripture with me we welcome
[5:14] all who are here all the visitors God
[5:17] bless you we pray that you'll meet
[5:19] somebody there in the back and give them
[5:20] your name if you're a visitor would sure
[5:22] like to shake your hand we have a woman
[5:25] coming here the last few weeks and I
[5:26] don't even know her name but we
[5:27] appreciate you coming so I just went
[5:29] over and grabbed your hand today because
[5:30] I don't usually get to get it but God
[5:32] bless you hopefully we can get to know
[5:34] you more we welcome you you've been
[5:36] enjoying the word together with us so
[5:37] God bless you and any of the rest of
[5:39] visitors have come God bless you we're
[5:41] going to read this morning from Matthew
[5:43] chapter 18.
[5:45] Matthew chapter 18.
[5:47] it's good to have brother Dan and sister
[5:50] Jane back from vacation the snowbirds
[5:52] that they are and uh the Sprint family
[5:55] in with us this morning God bless you
[5:57] praise the Lord
[5:59] Matthew chapter 18 also brother Jared
[6:02] was gone for
[6:03] a few weeks there so God bless you
[6:05] brother Jared and sister Betsy back with
[6:07] us Matthew chapter 18 God is good isn't
[6:10] he
[6:11] just feel uh you know I almost feel like
[6:14] that in the temple when the glory of the
[6:16] Lord came down that the minister
[6:17] couldn't stand to speak
[6:19] I actually just feel like just lifting
[6:21] my hands
[6:23] he's here this morning
[6:26] and so the Bible says that could the
[6:28] minister couldn't even speak because it
[6:29] was such a presence there the glory of
[6:31] the Lord that means everything to me
[6:33] but we know his glory can be in his word
[6:35] as well and so we just work off of his
[6:38] presence being here and ask him to speak
[6:40] to us this morning the things that are
[6:42] needful in our lives praise the lord we
[6:45] want to see more of his presence and His
[6:46] glory we need to get more and more used
[6:49] to that because that's what we're going
[6:51] to in glory can you say Amen we should
[6:53] feel comfortable in his presence never
[6:55] condemnation never conviction yes but
[6:57] not condemnation we should worship here
[7:00] as if we're already there
[7:02] amen that's so how free we should be
[7:05] worshiping the Lord Matthew 18 and verse
[7:07] 21 and then came Peter to him and said
[7:11] Lord how often should shall my brother
[7:15] sin against me and I forgive him
[7:19] uh till seven times and Jesus saith unto
[7:22] him I say it not unto thee until seven
[7:24] times but until Seventy Times Seven
[7:28] so you just put that math together get
[7:31] your calculator and uh total all that up
[7:34] and you see
[7:36] um a picture of the Divine love of God
[7:40] picture of the Forgiveness of God
[7:42] there's no restraints on it
[7:44] can you say Amen so in his in his
[7:48] response to Peter then he goes into this
[7:50] Parable that says therefore is the
[7:52] Kingdom of Heaven likened unto a certain
[7:54] King which would take in account of his
[7:56] servants and when he had begun to reckon
[7:58] one was brought unto him which owed him
[8:01] ten thousand talents now the scripture
[8:04] here has given a pretty large amount and
[8:07] I looked at it yesterday you translate
[8:09] that into our money today and it's about
[8:12] 34 billion dollars so it's almost almost
[8:15] an exaggeration and you're going to see
[8:17] why in just a minute because it's almost
[8:19] if the king knew in this sermon there
[8:21] really was in a way probably to pay that
[8:24] back it was so huge it reminds us of our
[8:27] debt to the Lord can you say man we owe
[8:30] him everything and so when he had begun
[8:32] to wreck and one was brought into him
[8:33] which owed him ten thousand talents for
[8:36] but for as much as he had not to pay his
[8:38] Lord commanded him to be sold and his
[8:41] wife and children and all that he had
[8:44] and payment to be made because cause
[8:46] that's what they did the Old Testament
[8:48] they they would sell the family they had
[8:50] to sell their children they had to sell
[8:52] their land if they got in debt the
[8:55] servant therefore fell down and
[8:57] worshiped him saying Lord have patience
[9:00] with me and I will pay and I will pay
[9:02] the all then the Lord of that servant
[9:05] was moved with compassion and loosed him
[9:09] and forgave him the debt
[9:12] so I want you to notice the action was
[9:14] to forgive all of the debt but first he
[9:17] was moved by something
[9:19] he was moved this King was moved by
[9:22] something and he was moved with
[9:24] compassion
[9:26] and his move being moved with compassion
[9:29] uh he was able to then take an action of
[9:32] losing this man and forgiving forgiving
[9:34] his debt and if you don't know the rest
[9:37] of the parable we'll finish it but the
[9:38] same servant went out and found one of
[9:41] his fellow servants which owed him a
[9:43] hundred Pence and he laid hands on him
[9:45] and took him by the throat saying pay me
[9:48] that thou oldest and his fellow servant
[9:50] fell down at his feet and besought him
[9:52] saying have patience with me and I will
[9:55] pay the all and he would not but went
[9:57] and cast them into prison till he should
[9:59] pay the debt so when his fellow servants
[10:01] saw that it was done they were very
[10:03] sorry and came and told their lord all
[10:06] that was done then his Lord after he had
[10:08] called him said unto him oh thou Wicked
[10:10] servant I forgave thee all that debt
[10:12] because thou desirest me should us not
[10:14] thou also have had compassion on the
[10:17] fellow servant even as I had pity on
[10:20] thee and his Lord was Wrath and
[10:21] delivered him to the tormentors till he
[10:24] should pay all that was due unto him so
[10:26] likewise shall my heavenly father do
[10:28] also unto you if you from your hearts
[10:32] forgive not everyone his brother their
[10:35] trespass amen I'd like to title this
[10:38] this morning when his love Moves In You
[10:41] Just Go With It
[10:46] heavenly father bless your word and Lord
[10:48] we are grateful for your presence here
[10:51] this morning we're grateful for the
[10:53] healing for the deliverance and when
[10:55] you're around Lord Supernatural things
[10:57] take place we pray that you take this
[10:59] word now and bring it to the people's
[11:01] hearts the way that you want to as we
[11:03] commit it to you we're humbly your
[11:05] servant this morning and we commit our
[11:07] words to you in Jesus name amen why
[11:09] don't you shake somebody's hand before
[11:10] you're seated once again and God bless
[11:13] you as you take your seats
[11:16] as we see in the parable that something
[11:19] moved in the heart of this ruler and
[11:21] once again I say I want to speak on when
[11:24] his love when his Divine love begins to
[11:27] move in you Just Go With It Just go with
[11:30] it and something was moved in the heart
[11:33] of this ruler and he was moved with
[11:35] compassion and when he was moved a
[11:38] certain way he acted on that and he
[11:40] forgave so he acted upon what his heart
[11:44] was being moved to do it's important
[11:47] that we not only are moved but that we
[11:50] act upon the way that we are moved
[11:53] um it's important that if the Lord leads
[11:55] us and calls us and we feel that and
[11:57] particularly this morning I'm going to
[11:59] get into his his Divine love and I'm I'm
[12:02] reminded of the examples
[12:04] um in the brother branham's life is that
[12:06] when something happened to him that he
[12:08] said something come over him and when he
[12:11] was challenged by demon Spirits then
[12:13] something come over him he said he said
[12:15] I wish I could have that all the time
[12:17] but something was able to come over him
[12:19] that was different than his human love
[12:21] different than his thinking different
[12:22] than his mind because some of the
[12:24] situations with demanding power you
[12:27] would normally be afraid of it you would
[12:28] be thinking what do I do do I run what
[12:30] do I do so your mind is always trying to
[12:32] think what do I do in this situation
[12:33] then something greater greater begin to
[12:36] move his heart and all that thinking was
[12:38] washed away and he reacted according to
[12:41] the love of God which by the way the
[12:43] love of God is a stronger Force than any
[12:46] demon power and so when it moved on him
[12:49] he chose to act upon what was moved
[12:52] moving in his heart and thus he forgave
[12:55] he he had Power Authority in the name of
[12:58] Jesus Christ and all that became the
[13:00] power to break the power of the enemy so
[13:02] now when God moves on us when this love
[13:04] moves on us then we should move with
[13:07] that and act upon that and this is what
[13:09] this ruler did when he was moved with
[13:11] something he acted on it in this case he
[13:14] forgave when he was when he was moved
[13:17] with with this uh spirit of compassion
[13:20] then we realized that it would not it
[13:23] would be contrary to our thinking uh it
[13:26] wouldn't be normal for us to to react
[13:29] this way to forgive in other words the
[13:31] normal thinking would just be to respond
[13:33] that that we think it through and he's
[13:36] got all of this debt making maybe he can
[13:38] set up a payment plan our mind maybe or
[13:41] the worst case scenario scenario is to
[13:44] basically say no no no you've done this
[13:46] you're finished you're done we're
[13:48] putting you into prison this is a lot of
[13:50] debt that's what our normal because I'm
[13:52] not helping the guy by forgiving them
[13:53] and so you've got all this and so the
[13:55] Mind thinks to think when this ruler in
[13:58] the parable was moved with compassion he
[14:01] acted on the compassion but he didn't
[14:04] act upon what he had thought because he
[14:05] would if we would have thought he would
[14:07] have talked himself out of forgiving him
[14:11] I'm going to preach this morning and I'm
[14:13] going to give you the opportunity if you
[14:15] need to go go ahead and go but put your
[14:16] seat belt on because I'm going to get
[14:18] into some things about forgiveness that
[14:19] maybe you've never heard
[14:22] the mind if it was given time to reason
[14:24] with this it would possibly override
[14:28] this compassion that he felt the mind
[14:30] would override if you're thinking
[14:32] sensibly it would not be to forgive this
[14:35] debt but to teach this guy a lesson
[14:38] the mind will override this so now I've
[14:41] been pondering a little bit this Divine
[14:43] love that we've been preaching about and
[14:45] I've been thinking about it and deeply
[14:47] in in working in the people of God and
[14:51] particularly working in me this Divine
[14:53] Capstone love working in me and thinking
[14:56] about as we went over its
[14:57] characteristics and we went over its
[14:59] actions and all the points in First
[15:01] Corinthians 13 of the excellent way
[15:03] we've gone over those things now and
[15:06] hopefully I can spend time and put it
[15:07] together in a little booklet or
[15:09] something to get you all the quotes and
[15:10] the scriptures pretty soon but so so now
[15:13] we've learned that it was a when when
[15:15] God comes in and we act this way it's a
[15:17] different course than human love it's a
[15:19] different action than human love it's
[15:21] something greater it's a force it's a
[15:24] presence Divine love is not a teaching
[15:27] it's not mind over matter it's not a
[15:29] mind over matter exercise it's a
[15:32] presence it's a force it's his presence
[15:34] he's the source of divine love so when
[15:37] he shows up that is the best of his love
[15:39] can you say that is his love so it's
[15:42] more than a teaching it's not mind over
[15:44] matter and some exercise in our mind it
[15:47] moves deep and if it moves deep it comes
[15:50] out and it wants to express that Divine
[15:52] love and then when it's a person is
[15:55] moved by it and and when somebody acts
[15:59] upon that Divine love then something
[16:01] different happens every time than the
[16:04] expected outcome
[16:06] somebody say praise the Lord something
[16:08] Supernatural can happen something great
[16:10] can happen when love projects Sovereign
[16:13] Grace takes over the situation and
[16:16] there's no demon greater than that
[16:17] Divine love the problem is is when it
[16:19] moves upon us we've got to let it we got
[16:22] to go with it
[16:24] we gotta trust it
[16:26] we can't let this mind interrupt the
[16:28] moving of the spirit of God
[16:33] because our minds will it'll reason
[16:35] it'll analyze it
[16:37] and it'll actually abort you know some
[16:40] new births are aborted because of
[16:43] somebody's thinking
[16:45] the conviction of the holy spirit moves
[16:47] Upon a Child or a teenager or a person
[16:49] to move them to a new birth and there's
[16:52] many abortions because their mind steps
[16:55] in the way I'm not ready I'm not doing
[16:57] that I'm not ready to give up and the
[16:59] mind aborts the whole situation I say to
[17:02] you this morning when the Lord is moving
[17:04] on you when his love is calling you I
[17:06] say go with it right away go with it
[17:08] right then
[17:09] [Applause]
[17:11] praise the Lord so so now we can we can
[17:15] start at a very basic Point here this
[17:17] morning with the scripture John 3 16.
[17:21] which is quoted probably more than any
[17:24] other scripture in the world in
[17:26] Christian Realms but in the world
[17:28] everybody knows John 3 16. and so I I'm
[17:31] uh there's it's quoted more than any
[17:33] other and yet the question is how many
[17:36] people really understand John 3 16.
[17:40] so it says for God so loved the world
[17:46] that he gave
[17:48] so that's what I'm preaching this
[17:49] morning God himself was moved as he
[17:53] looked at humanity and looked at the
[17:55] humanity that has fallen and as soon as
[17:57] they had fallen God was moved by
[18:00] something God in himself in the core of
[18:03] himself was moved by love his own love
[18:07] that he had within him but he was moved
[18:09] by it God so loved the world he could
[18:12] have had a lot of responses to the
[18:13] condition of the world
[18:17] he has judgment he could have responded
[18:20] first with judgment
[18:22] but he wasn't moved by judgment first he
[18:25] wasn't moved by his law first he wasn't
[18:28] moved by the thought I told them not to
[18:30] do that and they did it anyway
[18:32] he was not moved by all the other
[18:34] characteristics that's in God the first
[18:37] thing that God was moved in his heart
[18:39] with for this world in its condition is
[18:42] he was moved with his love
[18:48] and I'm saying to you on the the video
[18:51] land and whoever's listening and you
[18:53] hear this morning you were including
[18:55] that because the entire world is
[18:57] included in it you ought to raise your
[18:59] hand and say thank God that the heart of
[19:01] God was moved in love for me
[19:04] it was moved for you
[19:09] because I would safely say if God's
[19:12] heart wasn't moved to love you you
[19:14] wouldn't even be here this morning you
[19:16] wouldn't have salvation this morning you
[19:18] wouldn't have a desire to serve God but
[19:20] God so loved the world that that now he
[19:24] has he's moved by this but his love was
[19:26] not just moved he took action God so
[19:31] loved that he gave his only begotten son
[19:35] that we could have salvation his love he
[19:39] activated he acted upon it
[19:43] John 3 16 is is something that we know
[19:46] but look at look at what it says here
[19:48] he's seen the condition of the world and
[19:50] man it was fallen and something moved
[19:52] within him something moved within God
[19:55] for you he was moved with compassion he
[19:58] was moved God's first reaction was not
[20:00] judgment what a bunch of losers man I
[20:03] created them and I did all these things
[20:05] what a bunch as first responses my
[20:07] goodness what in the world is you know
[20:10] what a bunch of sad losers that's not
[20:13] what we have coming out of God
[20:18] love moved him
[20:20] can you say Amen
[20:21] and in his thought that love moved him
[20:24] to think in his thoughts
[20:27] his love moved him to start thinking
[20:30] thoughts and you know one of the
[20:31] thoughts he's seen and thought in his
[20:33] mind a lamb slain
[20:37] yeah this is all in God's thoughts
[20:39] because if you know your Bible he said
[20:41] that there was there's ones written in
[20:43] the Lamb's Book of Life who was slain
[20:45] before the foundation of the world
[20:49] so in these great movement of God's love
[20:52] and something in him just churned and
[20:54] stirring in his heart with love then his
[20:57] thoughts began to come to what when what
[20:59] am I going to provide what am I going to
[21:01] provide for them so in his thoughts all
[21:03] this happened before you were even born
[21:05] before sin came into the picture God
[21:08] went through all this in his thoughts
[21:09] and he's seen a lamb slain before the
[21:12] foundation of the war before you sinned
[21:15] before you did anything wrong God
[21:17] thought it's true and his love moved to
[21:20] provide a lamb for your sin somebody
[21:22] ought to shout praise the Lord this
[21:23] morning
[21:24] [Applause]
[21:25] it's all happening in God's thoughts
[21:28] and he's moved by love a lamb slain this
[21:31] is what they would need to be saved oh
[21:33] they need a way out they need an answer
[21:35] all this was going on in the back part
[21:37] of God's mind before the foundation of
[21:40] the world it's scriptural
[21:42] he's seen you he's seen your Fallen
[21:45] condition he was moved with love he was
[21:48] thinking of you he thought through the
[21:50] whole scenario of a lamb being slain for
[21:54] you his love was moving him in these
[21:57] kind of thoughts oh God help me to get
[22:00] this across this morning if love starts
[22:03] to churn in your heart stay with it go
[22:06] with it and let thoughts come from that
[22:10] [Music]
[22:12] what can I do to forgive that person
[22:14] what can I do to love that person how
[22:17] can I point them to the way out
[22:19] everybody's going to criticize them
[22:21] everybody's going to judge them but Lord
[22:24] you have put Divine love Within Me
[22:26] [Applause]
[22:29] so my thoughts are directed
[22:32] how can I get out of this how can we get
[22:34] out of this
[22:36] because I tell you if you're churning
[22:38] and moving with the love of God
[22:40] you're going to find the way out
[22:44] it's not the end of the story
[22:47] I'm gonna have him come and sing it
[22:49] again at the end of the service because
[22:50] the song already preached us the sermon
[22:52] this morning
[22:58] his love was moving and these kind of
[23:00] thoughts but then those thoughts were
[23:01] materialized and they weren't just
[23:03] thoughts that became reality he acted
[23:05] out of his love God God was moved by
[23:08] love and he gave his only begotten son
[23:10] his love moved in him so much that he
[23:13] acted on it he went with it
[23:17] even before he could give his son though
[23:19] he was already moved in the Garden of
[23:22] Eden when man fell
[23:24] he was already moved with love and
[23:26] compassion and Reconciliation and
[23:28] looking for a way to find Fellowship
[23:29] again it wasn't Adam running back to God
[23:32] saying God forgive me I'm at the altar I
[23:35] have sinned no he did what a lot of us
[23:37] do we go hide with our sin we hide in
[23:41] our shame we hide in our gift so it
[23:44] wasn't Adam and Eve running after God
[23:46] let me tell you something when I was 12
[23:49] years old I came to the Altar and I did
[23:51] this and I did that and I did no no no
[23:52] no no no no if you come it's because
[23:55] God's already calling you to come and he
[23:58] loves you enough to call your heart if
[24:00] you've got something laying there is I
[24:02] want more of God it's because he put
[24:03] that there
[24:07] [Applause]
[24:09] and so before the sun could come because
[24:12] it would be a matter of time before he
[24:13] could bring his but his only begotten
[24:15] son and send him to Calvary before that
[24:17] could happen man's already fun and God
[24:20] is rushing down man Adam wasn't looking
[24:22] for God God came looking for Adam
[24:24] because what his love was moving within
[24:26] him he wanted reconciliation comes over
[24:30] they're hiding behind the bushes
[24:31] somewhere and so God says Adam where are
[24:34] you and he says you know we're back here
[24:37] uh we're naked we're hiding ourselves
[24:39] who told you you were naked you know the
[24:41] scenario but God is running after uh
[24:45] I'll repeat it again our dear brother
[24:46] Ron Spencer who who said that a third of
[24:51] the Angels fell in heaven and God never
[24:53] moved on it but one son and daughter
[24:56] fall and God's rushing to make
[24:58] reconciliation
[25:01] what is man that thou art mindful of him
[25:04] it's better than the angels
[25:07] you have a position of the love of God
[25:09] being towards you that's better than the
[25:11] angels
[25:12] don't you feel love this morning go so
[25:15] mayor reach your back say God I lift my
[25:16] hands no one's loved me like you've
[25:19] loved me Lord we're living in a world
[25:21] that nobody loves anybody and the Love
[25:22] Has Gone cold and that's why people act
[25:25] the way they do because they're not love
[25:26] right from a child they're not love
[25:27] right but I can tell you I don't care
[25:29] what family you come from there's a God
[25:31] that's churning in his heart his heart
[25:33] is stirring because he loves you so much
[25:38] said what are you doing behind the
[25:40] bushes there come out here and and when
[25:43] he did he threw some skins flying some
[25:46] animals the blood was on the Skins he
[25:48] said he threw these over put these on
[25:50] you I'll take care of this and what is
[25:51] he doing his blood is finding a place
[25:54] for Fellowship even before he sent his
[25:56] only begotten son he's trying his love
[25:59] is trying to find a place of
[26:00] reconciliation I just need some
[26:03] fellowship again with you I'm not going
[26:05] to leave you out there by yourself come
[26:06] out of those bushes I say you this
[26:09] morning whoever is listening come out of
[26:10] those bushes come out of your shame come
[26:13] out of your guilt come out from other
[26:15] bushes and by the way get rid of your
[26:18] covering of religion because religion is
[26:20] a covering
[26:21] to hide your sin religion is recovery
[26:24] and they had they had sown fig leaves
[26:27] together to cover their private parts
[26:29] God said take those off it's only blood
[26:32] that's a crop recovery put these
[26:34] lambskins on you
[26:37] but you dare stay in the bushes with
[26:39] your religious covering come out here
[26:41] and I'll give you a covering I'll give
[26:44] you blood
[26:46] somebody say praise the Lord
[26:49] so even before he could give his son his
[26:51] calling I want you I want your
[26:53] fellowship I want you back it was love
[26:55] moving in him to say that you threw some
[26:57] skins to him from a killed lamb around
[27:00] their bodies and he found a place to
[27:02] begin reconciliation his love Found A
[27:06] Door of Hope found a place it wasn't his
[27:10] son yet but he found a place to start
[27:19] for reconciliation
[27:23] brother Graham said God so loved the
[27:25] world that he gave his only begotten son
[27:27] God's love to the world and God is love
[27:29] and when God projected himself to the
[27:31] world to save the world there could be
[27:33] nothing else but Sovereign Grace to
[27:34] produce a savior when God loves
[27:36] something has to operate
[27:41] when God loves something has to operate
[27:47] I want to live in that operation
[27:49] I want to live in that flow
[27:52] because when God loves because where's
[27:54] it move now God's love doesn't move in
[27:56] in a Bible or in a cloud
[27:59] where is his love in his people
[28:02] and it begins to Churn it begins to move
[28:04] excuse me for using churn I don't even
[28:06] know what that means it's a lack of a
[28:07] better term but it just begins to move
[28:09] and stir you up
[28:11] I say when the love of God stirs you
[28:14] it's going to be better than what your
[28:16] mind can do
[28:17] and when it stirs you up you don't get
[28:20] anything else that's more where the love
[28:21] of God stirs you
[28:23] go with it
[28:27] watch what it'll do I love this he says
[28:29] it's love
[28:30] and he says when God's love comes
[28:33] something has to operate and God so
[28:35] loved the world that a divine Savior
[28:38] appeared his grace provided that savior
[28:40] it was because of his love that brought
[28:41] forth his savior the world is dying for
[28:44] love the church is dying for love Jesus
[28:48] said you're the salt of the earth but if
[28:49] the salt has lost its savior it is
[28:51] henceforth good for nothing but to be
[28:53] Trot unto the feet of men and the church
[28:55] has lost its divine revelation of the
[28:57] love of God I'm going to read it again
[28:58] the church has lost its divine
[29:01] revelation of divine love
[29:04] so this is a revelation
[29:07] and it's more than just a revelation of
[29:09] the Seven Seals it's more than just a
[29:11] revelation of the godhead it's more than
[29:13] just a revelation of the prophet of the
[29:15] hour it's it's a revelation of what
[29:17] divine love is
[29:21] and hopefully as a minister I'm just a
[29:22] small portion to preach to you so your
[29:26] Revelation can break open more of what
[29:28] the Divine love of God is
[29:30] we're going around it we're we're taking
[29:33] Pride we're we're
[29:35] glory in how much we know in the message
[29:40] we glory in how much we know we glory
[29:43] and how much we're better than everybody
[29:44] else Christians we're better than
[29:46] everybody else in the world we glory in
[29:48] all these other things and we don't need
[29:49] to be glorious any of that we need to be
[29:51] glory in what God glory is in change
[29:54] lives
[29:55] the love of God's power effect upon
[29:58] people
[30:02] said uh
[30:03] if the church has lost its divine
[30:06] revelation of love love if the church
[30:08] has lost its divine revelation of the
[30:10] love of God it becomes a mock a stalk a
[30:12] stumbling block to the world there's
[30:13] only one thing the church has to do if
[30:15] you want somebody to come to Christ you
[30:17] be salty salt makes a thirst you be
[30:20] salty and the world will get thirsty
[30:22] that's right for in a man he is in the
[30:24] one he in one sense a man is a miniature
[30:26] Creator that's what Adam was created to
[30:29] be he was a miter God he was a creator
[30:32] he was a controller of this Earth
[30:33] instead of the earth controlling him
[30:35] instead of the sin of the world and the
[30:37] debauchery of the world controlling him
[30:39] which is what most of humanity is
[30:41] controlled you know yeah they're
[30:44] controlled we're like robots today
[30:47] with the AI and all the other things
[30:49] that's taken place they're controlling
[30:51] human beings
[30:53] by movies by media
[30:56] they're on your phone they're everywhere
[30:58] well listen we're not a part of that
[31:00] we're not robots we're Sons and
[31:02] Daughters of God this Earth and this
[31:04] temptation and its sexual debauchery
[31:06] doesn't control me as a man I by the
[31:09] Holy Ghost control what Satan brings to
[31:11] me
[31:15] in a man is this miniature Creator if
[31:18] he's a child of God because the spirit
[31:19] of God is in him who controls him who
[31:22] operates him and I'd like to let you
[31:24] just in a few minutes I'll let you know
[31:25] the truth if I had just a little more
[31:26] voice tonight I'd like to preach on that
[31:29] tonight but I'd like to let you in on
[31:30] some things about Divine love Paul said
[31:33] where there's tongues they shall cease
[31:35] where there's prophecies it'll fail
[31:37] where there's all these signs the
[31:40] Antichrist can produce any sign that's
[31:43] in the Bible
[31:46] fridge that's why we don't follow signs
[31:50] that's why we we don't depend on
[31:52] probably just prophecies
[31:54] because they can be imitated the
[31:56] Antichrist can produce any sign that's
[31:58] in the Bible but he cannot love
[32:05] he can't have this love
[32:07] that's why in The Book of John first
[32:10] John as John exposes the Antichrist
[32:13] spirit and what it is to to know when
[32:16] you have the Antichrist spirit and in
[32:18] the midst of all
[32:19] exposing the Antichrist spirit
[32:22] his theme is love
[32:25] Brothers love one another I'll read one
[32:27] scripture a minute whatever God had
[32:29] churning in him whatever God had moving
[32:31] in him now needs to be moving us because
[32:33] let me tell you it is the only correct
[32:35] response to the Antichrist spirit
[32:42] don't you try to go against this
[32:43] Antichrist spirit with your mind
[32:45] don't try to get online and debate with
[32:47] them
[32:48] I'm gonna go to a quote battle I'm going
[32:51] to by Biblical quote battle I'm going to
[32:53] quote the message don't you try to go
[32:55] with your intellect that Antichrist
[32:57] spirit is too strong it's going to win
[32:58] over you
[33:00] we're not approaching this combat in
[33:02] this battle coming against it with
[33:04] intellect and with quotes there's only
[33:07] one thing John said Brothers just love
[33:09] one another love one another the
[33:11] response to the Antichrist spirit and by
[33:13] the way I'll just tell you it's working
[33:15] right Among Us right here it's not out
[33:17] there in some denominational system the
[33:19] Antichrist spirit is working right among
[33:21] us all the time if you had discernment
[33:23] you could tell
[33:24] trying to divide trying to bring
[33:26] disharmony trying to lift up our
[33:28] opinions oh it's all kinds of things but
[33:30] there's only one correct response to the
[33:33] Antichrist spirit and that's this
[33:35] Capstone Divine love
[33:39] and that's why they brought all crippled
[33:41] John to every service because he never
[33:43] missed Church you know he a little
[33:44] crippled John and brought him up did the
[33:46] whole service he's praised to the Lord
[33:48] and that they had said John you're a
[33:49] you're a sage you're a patriarch here
[33:51] stand up and say something to the people
[33:53] and every time he would just stand up
[33:56] and say brothers
[33:57] just love one another
[33:59] and then he would sit down
[34:03] and his the the the the story is is the
[34:06] disciples eventually said can't you say
[34:09] something else
[34:10] don't you have another sermon
[34:12] they said no
[34:14] this is this is all we need
[34:18] somebody say praise the Lord
[34:22] this is the response to the Antichrist
[34:24] that we've got the real core the real
[34:27] substance of divine love and he don't
[34:33] praise the Lord
[34:34] I'm having a I'm having more fun than a
[34:37] human being should be allowed to have
[34:38] it's the way Rush Limbaugh says it and I
[34:41] don't think he knew my Christ like I
[34:42] know him this morning I can shout and
[34:45] rejoice can you say man not because I'm
[34:47] anything perfect but because I know that
[34:50] this love is resonating down in my heart
[34:52] I just need to act upon it when it
[34:54] starts to move me
[35:00] praise the Lord so what moved in God now
[35:03] moved in Jesus Christ of course because
[35:06] Jesus Christ was the fullness of God all
[35:09] that God was and he was a being that to
[35:12] be worshiped he had no physical uh
[35:14] presence as such unless he come down
[35:17] into the theophany he met Melchizedek
[35:20] and so so there's different ways he
[35:22] would come down but then he come in the
[35:24] body of Jesus Christ and all that God
[35:25] was he poured into that so you're going
[35:27] to have Jesus being moved with this same
[35:30] love that God was moved by because it's
[35:32] him it's him and Jesus was moved the
[35:35] scriptures that say uh and I'm going to
[35:37] quickly quote him to you I wouldn't try
[35:38] to get him up back there because I'm
[35:39] gonna you'll be going too fast for you
[35:41] Rebecca if that's who's up there Matthew
[35:43] 9 36 but when he saw the multitudes he
[35:46] was moved with compassion on them
[35:48] because they fainted and were scattered
[35:51] abroad as sheep having no Shepherd
[35:52] Matthew 14 14 and Jesus went forth and
[35:55] saw a great multitude and multitude and
[35:57] was moved with compassion toward them
[35:59] and he healed their are sick he was
[36:02] moved and he healed their sick
[36:04] Matthew 1 21 41 and Jesus moved with
[36:08] compassion put forth his hand and
[36:10] touched people excuse me put forth and
[36:13] saith unto the man I will be thou clean
[36:16] Mark 6 34 and Jesus when he came out saw
[36:19] much people and was moved with
[36:22] compassion toward them because they were
[36:24] as sheep not having a shepherd and he
[36:26] began to teach them many things notice
[36:29] the different reaction to being moved by
[36:31] The Compassion of God within him there
[36:34] was always an action he went with it I
[36:36] moved with compassion but he didn't just
[36:38] stand back and say I'm really moved
[36:39] today by these people having no Shepherd
[36:41] I'm really moved I feel in my spirit
[36:43] very moved no there was an action to it
[36:46] he healed the sick he grabbed the lame
[36:49] man's hand can you say man he taught
[36:51] them because that's God's love too these
[36:54] are sheep without a Shepherd so I'm
[36:55] going to teach them my love I was
[36:57] thinking last night why have I studied
[36:59] uh so hard the last why have I given my
[37:02] Saturdays and my Wednesdays to study for
[37:04] the last 35 years for the people of God
[37:06] sacrifice my family doing things and I
[37:09] and I'm I'm giving this and I'm not
[37:11] bragging but I'll try to say why did why
[37:13] would I do all this because I know it's
[37:15] the motive of the love of God for the
[37:17] people of God
[37:19] teach them the things of God exhort them
[37:22] encourage them rebuke them if necessary
[37:25] where's the motivation the love of God
[37:27] because I guarantee you I wouldn't be
[37:28] doing this
[37:31] you know I'd take up sailing or
[37:33] something it's you know it's it makes me
[37:36] brother Mark Johnson a friend of mine up
[37:38] here in Ann Arbor he works for Delta and
[37:41] one time they asked him to move out of
[37:42] the the baggage and throwing baggage on
[37:45] the planes and they ask him to move up
[37:46] to take a position behind the desk so he
[37:49] tried it out for about three months and
[37:50] he said no no no I'm going back to the
[37:52] baggage I said Well why'd you do that
[37:54] there's more money I think and all the
[37:55] other thing he says he says because bags
[37:58] don't talk back
[38:01] is take them you know throw them on the
[38:03] plane and there's no response
[38:05] but the people at the counter they deal
[38:08] with that
[38:10] I wouldn't be doing this job unless it
[38:12] was the love of God motivating me to do
[38:14] it and the Divine calling from the Lord
[38:16] you'd break down if you didn't have a
[38:18] calling
[38:21] what move God now was moving to Jesus
[38:24] and it caused an action he did this Same
[38:26] Love
[38:28] or let me ask it did he have the same
[38:30] love moving in the people in the book of
[38:32] Acts Church
[38:35] yes in Acts chapter 3 right away in Acts
[38:37] chapter 3 if you read your Bible there
[38:39] was a lame man
[38:41] Peter and John Peter James John I
[38:44] believe went into the City and they go
[38:46] to the temple in Jerusalem and so the
[38:48] Bible says that this lame man he was
[38:50] begging for money wanted money wanted
[38:51] money and so Peter stopped and the Bible
[38:54] says that he fixed His Eyes Upon This
[38:58] lame man
[38:59] normal if he didn't have any money which
[39:02] Peter didn't because he said that later
[39:03] he didn't have any money normally what
[39:05] the man wants is some money so he would
[39:07] stop and drop something in his little
[39:09] can and that would be over if that's
[39:11] normal thinking but because he didn't do
[39:13] anything he would be headed forward but
[39:15] now something begins to move Peter
[39:21] and he goes with what he's been moved by
[39:23] and he stops and he fixes his eyes on
[39:26] this man
[39:28] you don't do that unless you're being
[39:31] moved by something
[39:33] you just pass them on by you know drive
[39:35] by them
[39:36] but he was moved with something because
[39:38] he fixed his eyes on him
[39:40] and the guy thought okay he's going to
[39:42] give me something no he said Silver and
[39:44] Gold Have I None but whatever I have I
[39:48] give you in the name of the Lord
[39:50] and that wasn't it he grabbed his hand
[39:53] like Jesus did he grabbed his hand and
[39:57] said stand up
[39:59] and he was healed of being a lame man
[40:03] I'm saying to you Peter acted upon the
[40:06] love that was moving him
[40:11] let me give you another example that's
[40:13] different the same Peter who could raise
[40:15] up the lame man showing that it's not
[40:17] only just physical Miracles he's moved
[40:19] by something later on in um uh later on
[40:23] in Acts I forgot to write down scripture
[40:24] I think it's in Acts 10 or 11. he he uh
[40:28] he he has a whole different dimension of
[40:31] the love of God when he was up in the
[40:33] roof of the house and he was praying and
[40:35] fasting and a vision came to him that he
[40:37] was to sit down and eat food that was
[40:39] unclean he didn't do that so at the end
[40:41] of it something says to him eat that
[40:44] food he said never I you know I don't
[40:46] eat anything unclean Lord
[40:48] and he said don't call unclean what I
[40:51] have cleansed
[40:53] and he didn't understand it all but he's
[40:55] going to see the story someone was
[40:57] working on cornelius's house sent a man
[41:00] go get Peter to preach to the Gentiles
[41:02] but that was a problem because
[41:04] Peter with the Holy Ghost and it already
[41:08] grabbed the lame man have the love of
[41:10] God but now he's going to find another
[41:11] dimension alone because there's there's
[41:13] a couple things in Peter
[41:17] still
[41:18] Pride and Prejudice
[41:23] so Peter had before the movie came out
[41:28] Peter thinks he's going along fine
[41:30] everything's a good minded It's a
[41:31] powerful Church praise be to God
[41:33] Miracles are happening and God looks at
[41:35] us but wait a minute you're selective
[41:37] with your love a little bit
[41:39] oh that's right you still got to get
[41:41] into a deeper dimension of divine love
[41:43] because when push comes to shove you're
[41:45] going to stay amongst your own people
[41:47] and you're not going to give this
[41:48] message and this love to the Gentiles
[41:51] and nobody could recognize that Peter
[41:52] was the hero Peter was the man of Faith
[41:55] Peter's my get around Peter this is it
[41:57] but God looks at him and says he's got
[41:59] Prejudice in there
[42:01] and I'm gonna have to take that man to a
[42:03] deeper to deepen his ministry to deepen
[42:05] his walk with me to deepen his
[42:07] Effectiveness I've got to get rid of
[42:09] that prejudice
[42:12] somebody just raised their hand said oh
[42:14] lord it's speaking to me this morning
[42:17] I'm the only one with my hands up oh my
[42:21] only God sees what we have within us
[42:24] even some of us with the Holy Ghost
[42:27] but I like this song that says take me
[42:30] deeper don't you dare sing that unless
[42:33] you're ready this week for the Lord to
[42:34] do something in your life to challenge
[42:39] I was on this series of excellent way
[42:40] and I've been challenged in my Divine
[42:42] love like I've never been challenged
[42:44] before I will give the examples with my
[42:46] family with different ones and I've been
[42:48] challenged all right you're going to
[42:49] take the more excellent way are you
[42:51] going to take your brain on this
[42:56] Peter says Peter says Lord I've never
[43:00] I'm you know I wouldn't anything
[43:01] whatever I've cleansed don't you dare
[43:03] call it unclean the guy knocks on the
[43:05] door
[43:06] is Peter is there a guy named Peter here
[43:08] yes Cornelius wants you to come and now
[43:10] it all comes together in Peter's heart
[43:12] and he realizes and so now unless he was
[43:15] moved with the love of God he would have
[43:17] never stepped out that door and made the
[43:19] trip to the Gentiles but when he did he
[43:22] gets up to him and says tells him the
[43:24] whole story God is in this this is a God
[43:26] thing
[43:28] this is beyond me and the you know the
[43:31] biggest lesson in all this you the house
[43:33] of Cornelius I guess that's what they
[43:35] call them this house you know what the
[43:36] biggest lesson you know who got the
[43:37] biggest lesson I did because I'm
[43:39] proclaiming to you today that God is Not
[43:43] only a god of the Jews but he's a god of
[43:45] the Gentiles as well
[43:47] he had to learn that and he had to act
[43:50] upon what he was being moved by
[43:53] he had to go with it that's what I'm
[43:55] preaching to you today when it moves
[43:56] your heart you better go with it
[43:59] go with it right then
[44:03] in second Corinthians chapter 2 Paul
[44:07] was moved to tell the church to forgive
[44:10] a really bad brother in the church bad
[44:12] man because in First Corinthians the
[44:14] Corinthian Church this guy was having
[44:17] sexual relations with his um stepmother
[44:20] I believe it was and uh it was in the
[44:23] church he was coming to church he was
[44:24] having communities doing all this stuff
[44:25] and they weren't rebuking it they was
[44:27] like oh he's a brother and then
[44:29] everybody's kind of hiding it and he
[44:30] rebuked that church you don't hide that
[44:32] thing you call that thing out that's the
[44:34] love of God too
[44:37] and so but then when they called it out
[44:39] and and and and rebuked him and dealt
[44:41] with it because Paul said you got to
[44:43] deal with this there's sin in the camp
[44:44] and a A little leaven leavens the whole
[44:47] lump you wonder why preachers preachers
[44:50] have to correct things well it's the
[44:52] holy spirit because if you let sin go on
[44:55] in the camp it'll start affecting the
[44:57] rest of the young people and the rest of
[44:59] the church so he told them what to do
[45:01] and they did it and then he wrote him
[45:03] another letter in second Corinthians
[45:04] chapter two and he he's moved in his
[45:07] heart he senses in his spirit that this
[45:09] voice changed his ways and he's he's
[45:11] asked for forgiveness he's asked for
[45:13] repentance in the church now he's coming
[45:15] he's obviously a changed man something
[45:18] is happening in his life and he tells
[45:20] the church it's time to forgive him it's
[45:23] time to so that he doesn't get
[45:25] discouraged we Embrace him reinstate him
[45:28] in the church
[45:29] [Music]
[45:31] what's moving
[45:33] right the same love that moved in the
[45:35] heart of God for you is now moving in
[45:38] Paul and moving in the church it's time
[45:41] to reinstate this brother it's time to
[45:43] forgive him somebody say praise the Lord
[45:49] so by Paul's letter they were moved
[45:50] brought him brother you're reinstated to
[45:53] the church you have repented and will
[45:55] you restore you so he says so he doesn't
[45:57] get discouraged and the devil doesn't
[46:00] get advantage of this situation that's
[46:02] where he says we're not ignorant of
[46:04] Satan's devices
[46:06] I could read these two you read them on
[46:07] yourself that's your homework read this
[46:09] is all in the Bible we're not ignorant
[46:11] of Satan because what can happen if
[46:12] forgiveness doesn't come Satan wreaks
[46:15] havoc and creates I shouldn't say
[46:17] creates but makes more problems because
[46:18] there's no forgiveness
[46:21] there's no restoring Fellowship
[46:24] now the devil really takes that life
[46:27] if there's just judgment and no mercy if
[46:29] there's no love
[46:31] moving in the congregation then the
[46:33] devil actually makes it worse for that
[46:35] person
[46:37] is anybody hearing what I'm saying
[46:40] it's time to be a mature Church
[46:43] it's time to know that we're the ones
[46:45] that hold We're The Mercy Seat The Mercy
[46:48] Seat is in the heart of the Bride we're
[46:50] the ones that hold the Divine love if
[46:52] somebody can't find forgiveness they
[46:54] ought to be able to find it within the
[46:56] love of God and the body of Christ
[47:00] because they're not going to find this
[47:01] anywhere else their life will just end
[47:03] up in just in sham wasn't a mess out
[47:04] there
[47:06] you read the scripture Paul says to
[47:07] reinstate him
[47:10] first John chapter 2
[47:12] I was referring to John
[47:15] first John chapter 2
[47:17] and verse
[47:19] uh
[47:23] yep
[47:25] I'm sorry
[47:27] it's John chapter 2. first John chapter
[47:29] 2.
[47:36] if you if you would just go with me
[47:39] it's actually first John chapter 3 now
[47:41] verse 7 let us love one another for
[47:43] lovers of God and everyone that loveth
[47:45] born of God he that loveth not knoweth
[47:47] not God for God is love
[47:49] in this was manifested the love of God
[47:51] towards because that God sent his only
[47:53] begotten son into the world that we
[47:54] might live through him herein is love
[47:57] not that we love God but that he loved
[47:59] us and sent his son where's this thing
[48:01] come from well he better love me first
[48:05] I wasn't the love of God for you
[48:08] they better respond first they better
[48:12] does it say that here
[48:14] go ahead I have one duty that's
[48:16] expressed the love of God to them and
[48:18] see what it does
[48:21] that we love God that he loved us and
[48:23] sent his son beloved if God so love us
[48:25] we ought to also love one another it's
[48:28] he's saying what I'm preaching this
[48:29] morning whatever was moving in the heart
[48:32] of God before the foundation of the
[48:33] world whatever was moving in Jesus and
[48:35] the compassion for the people whatever
[48:37] is in the book of act the book of Acts
[48:39] church is to be moving in us because he
[48:41] said if God so loved us we are also to
[48:44] let that love move within us and act
[48:47] upon it
[48:48] no matter seeing God at any time if we
[48:51] love one another God dwelleth in us and
[48:53] his love is perfected in US hereby know
[48:55] we that we dwell in him and he and us
[48:57] because he hath given us his spirit and
[48:59] we have seen and do testified that the
[49:00] father sent the son to be the savior of
[49:02] the world whosoever shall confess that
[49:04] Jesus is the son of God God dwelleth in
[49:06] him and he and God and we have known and
[49:08] believed the love that God hath to us
[49:10] God is love and he that dwelleth in love
[49:13] dwelleth in God and God in him that's
[49:17] pretty deep it's not just we say I I
[49:19] love God you know this this comment I
[49:21] love God you know my uh my uh my family
[49:25] they love God praise the Lord but do
[49:28] they love his word
[49:33] just a question praise the Lord they
[49:36] love God but if they're in Rebellion to
[49:38] the word Jesus said if you love me keep
[49:40] my Commandments that love has got to go
[49:42] deeper I'm going to live any way I want
[49:44] to live and I love God that's a
[49:46] deception
[49:53] Jesus help me
[49:55] hearing is our love made perfect that we
[49:57] may have boldness no that his God is
[49:59] love and he that dwelled verse 16. he
[50:01] that dwelleth in
[50:04] he that dwelleth
[50:06] in love so it's a dwelling it's a it's
[50:09] it's not just an intellectual thing
[50:12] I want to dwell in his love and if
[50:15] you're dwelling is love you're dwelling
[50:17] in God
[50:21] it's a place to live it's a dwelling
[50:29] could we move to the present day and
[50:31] give examples
[50:33] of this love moving
[50:36] on a prophet a man of God
[50:38] when he was faced with demonic power
[50:41] when he was faced with a killer Bowl
[50:43] when he was faced with bees swarming all
[50:46] around him when he was faced with a
[50:48] maniac at the platform who wanted to
[50:51] break every bone in his body
[50:54] and he was moved by something
[50:56] and then he acted on that and when he
[50:59] acted on it power stepped in
[51:02] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[51:04] before today you before this audience
[51:06] you'll fall before my feet a demon
[51:08] possessed man and he says his love I
[51:11] talked about a couple Wednesdays ago
[51:13] he says something come over him he said
[51:16] I wish I could stay on me all the time I
[51:18] wish it could come in this congregation
[51:20] all the time he said if that would stay
[51:22] on us if we could motivate by that
[51:24] Miracles would happen and he said at the
[51:26] end of that service when that man did
[51:27] fall to his feet demon possessed man
[51:30] come to the platform and and I don't
[51:32] have time to tell the whole story I can
[51:33] get it to you but he he something come
[51:35] over him and he began to transmit past
[51:39] the demon power ready to take him he
[51:41] spit in his face hopped up in his throat
[51:43] spit right in his face
[51:45] any thinking says fight or flight
[51:49] any normal thinking says I'm going back
[51:52] after this guy he just hawked up and
[51:55] spit a bunch in my face any man in this
[51:58] place that hello Brothers
[52:05] thinking about it
[52:07] something moved and Beyond his thinking
[52:09] and he transmitted past into that man's
[52:11] heart and he says that man don't want to
[52:13] be that way
[52:15] he loves his children he might have a
[52:16] family at home he'd like to come home
[52:18] normal and have his babies play on his
[52:20] knee and just be a normal man but some
[52:22] Spirit has taken him that's not that man
[52:24] that's the spirit speaking the love of
[52:27] God moved him past the scare of the
[52:30] demon power
[52:31] our friends we've got to start acting
[52:34] upon that instead of this
[52:39] got it all figured out you know it
[52:41] there's only there's only one mind that
[52:43] has had a perfect thought as soon as
[52:45] that as soon as they thought of it it
[52:47] was perfect when you first thought it
[52:48] and that's not you that's not me that's
[52:51] God every thought he fought the first
[52:53] time was a perfect thought but that's
[52:55] not you your thoughts aren't perfect
[52:58] it's flawed it's tainted
[53:00] you can't trust it
[53:03] but I can tell you you can trust this
[53:05] love motivating within you
[53:08] can I say it again you can trust this
[53:11] to do the right thing
[53:13] you reached over there and that then the
[53:15] spirit of boldness come out and says
[53:17] today in the name of Jesus Christ you'll
[53:19] fall at my feet and something broke that
[53:22] Spirit he was delivered and fell right
[53:24] on top of his feet and the prophet said
[53:26] there was people getting out of
[53:27] wheelchairs there was healings taking
[53:29] place around the whole building when
[53:31] they just observe the love of God in
[53:34] action
[53:36] yeah praise God
[53:40] if you're sick this morning what I'm
[53:41] preaching
[53:42] is beyond Paul LaFontaine if you're sick
[53:45] raise your hand right now if you're sick
[53:47] on the video raise your hand right now
[53:48] you can be healed right now
[53:50] because he's here in the name of Jesus
[53:52] Christ may you receive your healing
[53:57] this isn't a show
[53:59] this isn't a television preacher put on
[54:03] this is reality of the love of God
[54:05] resident with his people
[54:08] and I'm not afraid of it you know what
[54:10] I'm afraid of I'm afraid of when my own
[54:13] mind talks me out of it
[54:15] you ought to be more afraid see you've
[54:17] come to trust your mind so much that at
[54:20] your default thing and that's why it
[54:24] aborts and interrupts the love of God
[54:25] that's starting to judge and the
[54:27] Forgiveness of God and your mind
[54:28] interrupts it all and it talks itself
[54:31] out of the love of God
[54:33] no no no no no no and you go through the
[54:36] whole list and off true I'm more afraid
[54:40] of my thoughts on it than what that love
[54:42] is turning Within Me
[54:45] I'm going to help me Lord to start
[54:47] trusting that more and more help me to
[54:49] go with it and release this
[54:51] let me release forgiveness I don't have
[54:53] a right to hold it from anybody
[55:01] whatever God was moved with the prophet
[55:03] now was moved Beyond himself Beyond his
[55:06] thinking
[55:07] the next stage of this
[55:09] is to talk about
[55:14] that whole mind thing in our thinking
[55:17] um
[55:17] many of you are here today because the
[55:20] love of God moved into your life
[55:23] and not just that it moved on you but
[55:25] many of you responded
[55:29] some of you haven't responded yet you
[55:31] know God loves you and you know and
[55:33] you're here and you know it's good to be
[55:34] in church on Sunday mornings but there's
[55:37] so much of this still and I'm going to
[55:39] call it stinking thinking
[55:41] that's what my dad called it stinking
[55:43] thinking
[55:45] and so you have not come where you need
[55:47] to come yet because it's being preached
[55:49] to you the love of God is present you
[55:52] know where it's wanting to take you but
[55:53] you leave this service all the time but
[55:56] interrupted by this
[55:58] you're too scared you won't let go
[56:01] so you're going to walk back into your
[56:03] car and back to your house with the same
[56:04] fears the same Hangouts the same scares
[56:06] because you're thinking talk to you out
[56:08] of responding to the Lord and becoming
[56:11] broken some people can't even cry and
[56:12] I'm not saying crying is everything but
[56:14] everybody worships their everybody's
[56:15] response different but some people
[56:17] haven't cried for years except for a cat
[56:19] dying or something like that but but
[56:21] crying because of the conviction of the
[56:23] Holy Spirit I'm cried I'm moved by the
[56:26] Lord and I'm going with it I don't care
[56:28] what happens tomorrow I don't care how
[56:30] embarrassed I am to be at the altar
[56:31] bawling my eyes out I don't care anymore
[56:33] I'm going with it that's what we got to
[56:36] do we've got to respond that way we've
[56:39] got to quit letting our mind talk us out
[56:42] of the moving of the love of God
[56:44] we've got to quit let our minds talking
[56:46] out of worshiping God freely we've got
[56:49] to quit quenching the spirit of God when
[56:52] it's trying to move Among Us
[56:56] it's it's but many of you are here today
[57:00] and responded one day in your life to
[57:02] the love of God I say praise the Lord
[57:06] you're where you're at because you you
[57:07] you didn't weren't just moved you
[57:09] responded you repented
[57:12] and that action moved you and you if
[57:15] something moved in your life and you
[57:16] acted on it
[57:18] and that's why I say when he does if
[57:20] you're listening to me on the broadcast
[57:22] today or anywhere wherever you're at in
[57:24] the world when the Lord moves on you
[57:28] Just go with it trust me go with it
[57:33] don't be afraid of it
[57:37] [Applause]
[57:45] go with it
[57:47] so why don't most people go with it the
[57:50] problem is right between their ears
[57:51] stinking thinking
[57:54] and in each of these examples I gave
[57:56] this morning if the love of God moved
[57:58] that it was acted upon usually very
[58:01] quickly before they had time to think
[58:03] see that's not going to work in our
[58:05] generation because we're supposed to
[58:06] think about everything don't you dare be
[58:09] gullible and don't you dare to swallow
[58:11] anything and I think God gives us a
[58:14] brain I understand that and I think God
[58:17] gives us a sound mind and a conscience
[58:19] and all of that and I don't think you
[58:21] just dump your brain out
[58:24] all I know is there's two minds there's
[58:26] your mind and there's the mind of Christ
[58:29] and this body of Christ is to be
[58:31] functioning by the mind of Christ which
[58:34] is in the soul
[58:36] and there's something tragic about when
[58:38] the mind of Christ is working in you and
[58:40] you know what you're being led to do and
[58:43] your thinking interrupts it and lifts
[58:45] itself above
[58:47] the thoughts of the Lord
[58:49] is anybody listening
[58:51] you thought it through and it
[58:53] interrupted the true leading of the Holy
[58:55] Spirit
[58:55] and his love so it's stinking thinking
[58:58] and
[59:00] why is it now because most of the time
[59:02] we have to think stuff through our
[59:04] thinking talks us out of it
[59:07] sometimes many people don't leave
[59:09] changed
[59:11] when they come to a service or when God
[59:13] moves upon them because you're thinking
[59:15] talks you out of a deeper surrender
[59:17] your fears your past hurts
[59:21] worldliness in your life rebellion in
[59:23] your life a lack of trust your formal
[59:27] religious your former religious training
[59:30] that's like a concrete thing in your
[59:33] brain your indoctrination of your former
[59:35] religious training even in Christian
[59:37] Realms sometimes can be blocking you
[59:40] from the moving of the spirit and the
[59:43] moving the love of God
[59:45] it aborts a new birth many times
[59:49] stinking thinking the mind gets in the
[59:51] way
[59:51] and I say what he moves with in the love
[59:54] of God is something totally different
[59:56] than your thinking it's the mind of
[59:57] Christ Living by the spirit is
[1:00:00] completely different than living by your
[1:00:03] flesh
[1:00:06] don't blend it together don't
[1:00:10] because I thought it that it must be
[1:00:12] true
[1:00:14] don't do that that the word correct
[1:00:19] seek truth the love of God rejoices in
[1:00:22] the truth
[1:00:23] wait till you have the truth
[1:00:26] wait till you have the facts and then
[1:00:28] sometimes with facts you still need the
[1:00:32] forgiveness and love of God
[1:00:35] he did it she did it and I have proof
[1:00:38] and it's the facts and I live on facts
[1:00:40] no we don't we live on the love and
[1:00:43] forgiveness of God
[1:00:48] the facts was condemning that woman so
[1:00:50] she'd be stoned by the Pharisees they
[1:00:53] had facts but there was something
[1:00:55] greater than the facts
[1:00:57] [Applause]
[1:00:59] I've got proof he did wrong I'm going to
[1:01:02] correct him I've got facts for it great
[1:01:05] that's wonderful seek the truth but
[1:01:06] there's something greater than just
[1:01:08] having the facts and acting on facts
[1:01:14] you know my Uncle Jim uh he's he's went
[1:01:18] on now and I pray for his soul I believe
[1:01:20] that he made restitution with God but
[1:01:22] when as kids when we go visit Uncle Jim
[1:01:25] my dad has
[1:01:26] um two brothers uh Jim and Jerry and
[1:01:28] they live up here in Joanne sometimes
[1:01:30] Joanne listens in
[1:01:33] God bless you Aunt Joanne
[1:01:36] Jim you know he had a drinking problem
[1:01:38] and he when we go camping with those
[1:01:40] guys
[1:01:41] Jim would change when he got drunk and
[1:01:44] uh I don't mean this disrespectful
[1:01:46] because everybody does this drinking and
[1:01:48] becoming drunk numbs your normal
[1:01:50] thinking
[1:01:51] it's real simple and it you're not
[1:01:53] thinking properly and you're not
[1:01:55] thinking in your regular reasoning mind
[1:01:57] so we would go camping when he'd get
[1:01:59] real drunk then we realized that that's
[1:02:01] when he get he began to talk about the
[1:02:03] Lord he began to talk about his need for
[1:02:05] the Lord he began to compliment my dad
[1:02:07] for how he was raising his children I
[1:02:09] should have done that John you have done
[1:02:11] a perfect job with your kids my that's
[1:02:12] great he never said this stuff before he
[1:02:16] was critical of us you know and never
[1:02:17] wanted to come to Christ never wanted to
[1:02:19] respond and that was all in his normal
[1:02:21] thinking reasoning process because he
[1:02:24] had been taught against the gospel
[1:02:27] wow but once you numb all that reasoning
[1:02:30] then something I and I don't know the
[1:02:33] psychology all I know he started to talk
[1:02:34] about the Lord and my dad enjoyed it and
[1:02:36] he tried to get in what he could but
[1:02:38] more than likely well it did happen
[1:02:39] every time he'd come back sober again he
[1:02:42] was against it
[1:02:43] I thought you said you were going to
[1:02:44] come to church no I ain't coming
[1:02:48] he's ever had family members like that
[1:02:49] and we still love them and I believe he
[1:02:52] came to the Lord I love him to death and
[1:02:54] that that's that's what we have to do
[1:02:56] but is there something about that we can
[1:02:58] laugh about Uncle Jim but there's
[1:02:59] something about our thinking that has so
[1:03:02] much concrete stuff in it that when
[1:03:05] something else comes along besides our
[1:03:08] own thinking it can interrupt
[1:03:13] our thinking can dismantle
[1:03:17] the love of God and what's being said
[1:03:19] even conviction
[1:03:22] hello conviction is a good thing
[1:03:25] someone's broken to tears and feels bad
[1:03:27] for their sin and feel there's a they're
[1:03:29] a sinner and the Holy Spirit is
[1:03:31] convicted them they're weeping don't you
[1:03:33] dare touch that
[1:03:36] go with it
[1:03:39] go with it
[1:03:42] because that's something you don't deal
[1:03:44] with emotions and affection that's
[1:03:45] something deeper
[1:03:47] than condemnation
[1:03:52] the reason people don't leave different
[1:03:53] is whatever is being said is quickly
[1:03:56] talked out of by their minds they
[1:03:58] they're talked out of it the word
[1:04:00] corrects all the filthy cussing
[1:04:02] television and movies that you're
[1:04:03] feeding on
[1:04:06] that cause you to kick it out of your
[1:04:07] life and you feel conviction but what
[1:04:10] stops it when you leave here is your
[1:04:12] thinking
[1:04:14] you're not going to leave it you're not
[1:04:15] going to let it go you like those
[1:04:16] television shows way too much
[1:04:21] that's true
[1:04:22] the word tells you what modesty truly is
[1:04:25] by the word of God and by the message
[1:04:26] and his brother Michael brought out
[1:04:29] so simply if God would have wanted you
[1:04:31] to have longer nails or black nails or
[1:04:35] purple nails he would have made you that
[1:04:37] way I'd like that brother Michael I say
[1:04:39] Amen why are we trying to make something
[1:04:42] different than the way God made us God
[1:04:45] Gave You eyebrows but you want to extend
[1:04:47] them out
[1:04:49] or whatever they do with them well God
[1:04:51] didn't extend your eyelashes God didn't
[1:04:53] emphasize your eyelashes
[1:04:58] what'd you do you're feeding on too much
[1:05:00] on the internet and you're looking at
[1:05:02] Angelina Jolie and all the movie stars
[1:05:04] and Keeping Up with the Kardashians
[1:05:06] don't tell me people aren't feeding on
[1:05:08] them
[1:05:10] you can see it in your life you want to
[1:05:13] cake the makeup on you want to get the
[1:05:15] tight dresses you want to dress I have
[1:05:17] to wear a dress but I'm going to wear a
[1:05:18] tight one because I want to kind of look
[1:05:19] I don't want to look like an Amish out
[1:05:21] there and so it's a thinking process
[1:05:23] that you bought into the world
[1:05:26] okay and you make it and we make you
[1:05:28] make it like well I'm a legalist we're a
[1:05:29] legalist I'm not the one that legalized
[1:05:31] sin
[1:05:35] you turn it around the preacher's the
[1:05:37] problem and no no wait a minute wait a
[1:05:39] minute if the holy spirit moves with the
[1:05:41] love of God upon you and presents it
[1:05:43] something what interrupts it you're
[1:05:45] thinking I'm not doing that I'm not
[1:05:48] laying it down
[1:05:51] you can't find any place in the Bible
[1:05:53] where God says it's okay for a woman to
[1:05:55] wear britches you can't find it you
[1:05:57] actually find otherwise
[1:06:01] but if I preach that and I do it's not
[1:06:05] accepted by this entire world
[1:06:08] because the thinking has been developed
[1:06:11] against the thoughts of God and what he
[1:06:14] says modesty is
[1:06:18] not my problem
[1:06:20] it's a problem in the thinking of the
[1:06:22] people
[1:06:23] praise God for some Souls around this
[1:06:26] world that's saying I'm no longer
[1:06:29] interested in bearing the wisdom of this
[1:06:32] world in my mind and thinking the
[1:06:34] world's thoughts what does God's word
[1:06:36] say about it
[1:06:40] there's a few people left like that in
[1:06:42] this world and they actually researched
[1:06:44] it and they're hungry for it very few
[1:06:46] people
[1:06:49] the word says get your children away
[1:06:51] from worldly Associates
[1:06:55] that you're not going to do it because
[1:06:56] your thinking is placed Above All That
[1:07:00] if that's what the word says
[1:07:02] get them around good Fellowship get them
[1:07:04] around good wholesome things
[1:07:10] I just I'm just going to take a drink of
[1:07:12] water because it's real quiet right now
[1:07:13] it's a good time to do it
[1:07:16] trade you
[1:07:19] stinking thinking
[1:07:23] word speaks about forgiveness and to let
[1:07:26] it go and the Holy Spirit conviction
[1:07:28] plus the word leads us that way moves by
[1:07:32] the love of God and your mind is given
[1:07:35] power you gave it power to have a better
[1:07:38] way to deal with it
[1:07:39] and it stops just simple forgiveness of
[1:07:42] God stops the process what did it you're
[1:07:45] thinking
[1:07:48] the word says for young people not to
[1:07:50] sexually touch one another
[1:07:52] don't have sex before marriage don't
[1:07:54] even kiss before marriage because that's
[1:07:56] potentially committing adultery that's
[1:07:58] what the word says
[1:08:00] and you leave here with your thinking
[1:08:01] that says that does that's not really
[1:08:03] relevant anymore
[1:08:06] that doesn't fit
[1:08:08] it's not reality
[1:08:11] a little social drink is okay
[1:08:13] and your thinking decides what to do
[1:08:16] above
[1:08:18] the word of God
[1:08:28] I can't help but ask myself the question
[1:08:30] through all this since I've been
[1:08:32] preaching on all of us and preaching on
[1:08:33] you can't help but ask myself how much
[1:08:36] of my Christian Journey
[1:08:38] the serving the lord for
[1:08:43] these 40 45 years now
[1:08:45] that's why I gave my heart to the Lord
[1:08:47] and was baptized real young receive the
[1:08:49] Holy Ghost when I was 16. but I can't I
[1:08:52] can't help but ask an honest question to
[1:08:54] myself is how much of my whole Christian
[1:08:56] Journey has functioned by my own
[1:08:58] thinking and not walking in the spirit
[1:09:03] I don't even know if I want to see that
[1:09:06] it'd be too embarrassing for me that I
[1:09:09] thought it was the thoughts of God and I
[1:09:10] acted on my own thinking all I can tell
[1:09:13] you is at 57 coming up in April 57 years
[1:09:16] old I'm tired of doing that and I'm
[1:09:18] asking the Lord where do you God get me
[1:09:20] Lord that I could truly walk in the
[1:09:22] spirit every day
[1:09:24] function by the mind of Christ
[1:09:26] Watchman need the Chinese missionary
[1:09:29] said
[1:09:30] over there in China watching the success
[1:09:32] of the American church he said I'm
[1:09:34] amazed at what the American Christian
[1:09:36] Church can accomplish without the
[1:09:39] leadership of the Holy Ghost
[1:09:42] build big churches and do great things
[1:09:45] in schools and and he was direct he said
[1:09:48] I'm amazed what I can do without the
[1:09:50] spirit
[1:09:51] he said it
[1:09:54] it's time that the church functions by
[1:09:56] the love of God
[1:09:58] thank you
[1:09:59] I'm saying if it moves you go with it
[1:10:02] why don't we we don't trust we we trust
[1:10:05] our minds more than is leading can you
[1:10:07] say Amen but when you trust his love and
[1:10:09] his mind you're not trusting man you're
[1:10:12] not trusting me can you say man you're
[1:10:15] not being stupid by following the mind
[1:10:17] of Christ and the love of God we're
[1:10:19] really getting bad if we're using our
[1:10:21] own thoughts and we feel more safe
[1:10:24] we default to our own thoughts and
[1:10:26] default back to our habits because we
[1:10:28] feel safer there really we feel safer
[1:10:30] with our own thoughts leading us
[1:10:33] that's not safe that's you've resorted
[1:10:36] to that I'm going to protect myself I'm
[1:10:38] gonna I'm gonna I've got to do it my way
[1:10:40] too many people have hurt me I say if
[1:10:42] the love of God moves you go with it let
[1:10:44] him lead you where it wants to go
[1:10:46] because you're going to be Unbound by
[1:10:48] where you're at
[1:10:51] now
[1:10:52] Galatians chapter 5 verse 17. I know 12
[1:10:57] 40. I know the time
[1:10:59] Galatians chapter 5.
[1:11:02] now I can finish this next Sunday or I
[1:11:04] can finish it now
[1:11:06] so
[1:11:08] um for four four people's enough for me
[1:11:10] I'm I'm going I'm going with it
[1:11:13] I'm going with it hey come on you guys
[1:11:14] drove three three and a half hours
[1:11:17] three hours from Dayton praise the Lord
[1:11:20] hour and a half from Lima
[1:11:24] you know they've got the whole day right
[1:11:25] brother Joe
[1:11:27] praise the Lord
[1:11:29] I appreciate all you coming we had some
[1:11:31] good Fellowship Friday night with some
[1:11:33] of the Saints in Lima and and uh
[1:11:35] whenever I drive that long thing I would
[1:11:37] say to my wife God bless these people
[1:11:38] for driving that whole way I don't know
[1:11:40] if I could do it but they're doing it
[1:11:42] and praise the Lord faithful to the
[1:11:43] house of God God bless you I think
[1:11:46] there's an extra special blessing with
[1:11:47] it with the sacrifice
[1:11:50] amen I know you come to see the Lord it
[1:11:52] certainly isn't me you come to see the
[1:11:54] Lord what did I say Galatians chapter 5.
[1:11:57] Galatians chapter 5.
[1:11:59] can I speak a couple more scriptures
[1:12:03] all right Galatians chapter 5 and verse
[1:12:06] 17 says
[1:12:09] for the flesh no verse 16. this I say
[1:12:12] then walk in the spirit and ye shall not
[1:12:15] fulfill the lust of the flesh that's how
[1:12:16] powerful it is
[1:12:17] for the flesh lusteth against the spirit
[1:12:19] and the spirit against the Flesh and
[1:12:21] these are contrary the one to the other
[1:12:24] so that you cannot do the things that
[1:12:27] you would in other words the love of God
[1:12:29] the spirit of God is trying to lead you
[1:12:31] to do the things that he wants to lead
[1:12:33] you to do but it's always contrary to
[1:12:36] what our mind says and what our flesh
[1:12:38] says it'll never be in harmony it'll
[1:12:41] never be agreeing
[1:12:43] and because of that we can't trust we
[1:12:46] must live by the spirit can you say man
[1:12:48] how many wants to live by the spirit but
[1:12:50] if you be led of the spirit ye are not
[1:12:52] under the law and then he gives those
[1:12:54] into the works of the flesh but I just
[1:12:55] want to say they're contrary your mind
[1:12:57] and God's mind is contrary to one
[1:12:59] another always the leading of the spirit
[1:13:01] and leading your flesh is contrary to
[1:13:03] one another it never agrees
[1:13:07] second Corinthians chapter 10 and I'm
[1:13:09] going to ask Solomon if you would so I'm
[1:13:11] going to go back there and get that
[1:13:13] ladder tall ladder and bring it out here
[1:13:15] second Corinthians chapter 10 don't look
[1:13:17] at Solomon look at the scripture
[1:13:20] I'm going to give an illustration before
[1:13:22] we are finished today second Corinthians
[1:13:25] chapter 10 yes look at this now
[1:13:28] second Corinthians chapter 10 verse 1.
[1:13:31] I Paul myself beseech you the me by the
[1:13:34] meekness and gentleness of Christ who in
[1:13:36] presents and base among you but being
[1:13:38] absent and bold towards you but I
[1:13:40] beseech you that I may not be bold
[1:13:43] um
[1:13:44] uh but I visit you that I may not be
[1:13:46] bold when I am present with that
[1:13:48] confidence wherewith I think to be bold
[1:13:50] against some which think of us as we
[1:13:52] walk it's going to the flesh verse 3 for
[1:13:54] though we walk in the flesh we do not
[1:13:57] war after the flesh
[1:13:59] for the weapons of our Warfare are not
[1:14:03] carnal
[1:14:04] don't look at them look at me
[1:14:07] look in your Bible look at the scripture
[1:14:09] for the weapons of our wherefore are not
[1:14:11] carnal But Mighty through God to the
[1:14:14] pulling down of strongholds how many
[1:14:16] believe that
[1:14:17] our weapons are Mighty to the pulling
[1:14:20] down of strongholds well what's the
[1:14:22] strongholds in our life what's the
[1:14:24] strong line I don't have any strong
[1:14:25] loads oh yes you do
[1:14:27] and there's a power that pulls them down
[1:14:29] casting down all imaginations it's in
[1:14:32] our thinking
[1:14:34] the strongholds are in our thinking
[1:14:36] process casting down imaginations and
[1:14:40] every High thing that exalted itself
[1:14:43] against the knowledge of God and
[1:14:46] bringing into captivity every thought to
[1:14:49] The Obedience of Christ
[1:14:52] our thoughts can lift itself and I want
[1:14:55] to word it the way Paul says it here he
[1:14:58] says every thought that exalted itself
[1:15:02] above the knowledge of God your thoughts
[1:15:06] and Satan's thoughts lift himself above
[1:15:09] the knowledge of God
[1:15:13] so I'm here preaching God's thoughts I'm
[1:15:16] preaching the knowledge of God all right
[1:15:17] and then we got
[1:15:20] uh we got
[1:15:22] Solomon which would be Satan's thoughts
[1:15:27] sorry about that bud
[1:15:29] and we got
[1:15:31] Jonathan that would be my thoughts
[1:15:32] because you got Satan thoughts and you
[1:15:34] got my thoughts and uh you look pretty
[1:15:37] good by the way my thoughts look pretty
[1:15:38] good today
[1:15:41] Satan's dressed up this morning too his
[1:15:43] thoughts
[1:15:44] so so this is my thoughts this is
[1:15:47] Satan's thoughts and they they
[1:15:49] intertwine quite often if we let them
[1:15:52] right and and they actually become
[1:15:55] buddies sometimes
[1:15:57] Satan's thoughts and my thoughts get
[1:16:00] Blended together and become buddies but
[1:16:02] the real tragedy is in our lives when
[1:16:04] the knowledge of God is coming here then
[1:16:07] they lift themselves and exalt
[1:16:10] themselves above the knowledge of God so
[1:16:13] you guys go ahead and do that
[1:16:26] buddies Buddies
[1:16:29] now this is really juvenile to you but I
[1:16:32] want the children to catch this is what
[1:16:34] the scripture says that our thoughts
[1:16:36] just don't say that they have a power
[1:16:40] to exalt themselves above the knowledge
[1:16:44] of God
[1:16:46] left themselves
[1:16:48] their imaginations in our imagination
[1:16:51] realm is we thought it so it must be
[1:16:53] truth we've imagined all of it no facts
[1:16:56] or truth of God but they the thoughts
[1:16:58] our bodies many times and they lift
[1:17:00] themselves it's teeter-tottering so it's
[1:17:02] dangerous up there it's scary up there
[1:17:05] and but but this is my thoughts and the
[1:17:08] devil's thoughts and this is what they
[1:17:10] do all the time if they can lift
[1:17:12] themselves as a prominence in my life
[1:17:14] over the knowledge of God and that's her
[1:17:16] I'm standing here preaching and my
[1:17:19] thoughts and Satan thoughts are listed
[1:17:20] themselves now you can laugh at Solomon
[1:17:23] and Jonathan all you want to you can
[1:17:25] laugh at this illustration all you want
[1:17:26] to but let's be real this morning say
[1:17:29] how much does this happen when you leave
[1:17:31] every service
[1:17:33] how much does this happen that you go
[1:17:36] back to your thoughts lifting itself
[1:17:39] above the knowledge of God your past
[1:17:41] hurts your past pains all that gets
[1:17:43] filtered through it and it's all between
[1:17:45] your ears so the moving of the spirit
[1:17:46] happens the love of God moves everything
[1:17:49] moves but there's something dominant
[1:17:51] that's happening above the knowledge of
[1:17:52] God I don't want to live that way I want
[1:17:55] to live where the knowledge of God is
[1:17:57] the prominent thoughts in my life they
[1:17:59] dominate my thoughts did not the Bible
[1:18:00] say let this mind be in you which is
[1:18:03] also in Christ Jesus did not the bible
[1:18:05] say that you be transformed by the
[1:18:08] renewing of your mind
[1:18:10] did not our prophets say now that you've
[1:18:12] been born now that you've been saved now
[1:18:14] that you have the Holy Ghost now he said
[1:18:17] let the mind of Christ change your
[1:18:20] thoughts and renew your mind that you're
[1:18:22] thinking like God is thinking can I get
[1:18:24] an amen
[1:18:26] so you cast down imagination you say
[1:18:29] boys get down from there right now
[1:18:31] quickly get down from there I'm not
[1:18:34] going to let this happen any more in my
[1:18:37] life and matter of fact you guys come
[1:18:39] down here because I've got the power in
[1:18:41] the name of Jesus over my thoughts can
[1:18:43] you say it stay right here you you take
[1:18:46] the ladder because I'm going to remove
[1:18:47] the latter in my life you take it back
[1:18:49] there because you're the latter guy
[1:18:50] let's give a hand to the latter guy he's
[1:18:53] a good one
[1:18:56] and now come here come here now I can be
[1:18:59] here I could live here and probably be a
[1:19:02] little confused all the time and always
[1:19:04] in a battle all the time but I could go
[1:19:07] further and say I'm going to tell you
[1:19:09] guys where to be in my life because I
[1:19:11] can't get rid of all my thoughts and I
[1:19:13] can't stop the devil from putting
[1:19:16] thoughts in my hair or my head because
[1:19:18] that's you you can you're going to have
[1:19:20] that but I can stop having them have a
[1:19:23] dominance I can cast down imagination
[1:19:26] and I can live a life where I say in the
[1:19:29] name of Jesus you my thoughts Satan's
[1:19:33] thoughts you are down here
[1:19:37] I said you are in the name of Jesus
[1:19:39] you're down there
[1:19:41] see how stubborn it is
[1:19:45] trying to stay there and I told him in
[1:19:47] the name of Jesus to get down
[1:19:50] I can't get a right of Satan's thoughts
[1:19:53] coming I can't get around my mouth but I
[1:19:55] can live that the knowledge of God is
[1:19:58] always going to Trump
[1:20:02] and they're going to be under subjection
[1:20:04] to me
[1:20:06] and the thoughts of God and I'm going to
[1:20:09] be moved by the love of God I'm going to
[1:20:11] be moved by the spirit of God
[1:20:13] can you say Amen
[1:20:15] that's how I want to live
[1:20:18] let's give a hand for my thoughts
[1:20:21] don't give a hand to Satan's thoughts
[1:20:23] [Applause]
[1:20:28] God bless you
[1:20:30] I hope you got something out of this
[1:20:31] this morning
[1:20:32] stinking thinking
[1:20:35] maybe on Wednesday night or next Sunday
[1:20:36] we'll pick it up because I didn't
[1:20:39] realize that psychology has they took
[1:20:41] the term stinking thinking and there's
[1:20:42] actually some characteristics of people
[1:20:44] who have stinking thinking and when I
[1:20:46] read all of them I realized yeah this is
[1:20:48] way we think sometimes and it actually
[1:20:50] interrupts
[1:20:52] any moving of the spirit it interrupts
[1:20:54] the love of God and my message to you
[1:20:57] this morning is just simply
[1:20:59] if you're a born-again Believer you have
[1:21:01] the potential for the love of God to
[1:21:03] move you with compassion and in that
[1:21:05] love is the power of God to change and
[1:21:09] make the impossible possible
[1:21:13] so I'm saying when it moves on you in a
[1:21:15] moment
[1:21:17] Just Go With It
[1:21:20] see what it'll do
[1:21:22] and live life that your thoughts and
[1:21:24] Satan's thoughts are under the control
[1:21:26] of the Holy Spirit
[1:21:28] I've heard it said by people you can't
[1:21:30] control a lot of things in life but you
[1:21:32] can control your thinking
[1:21:35] can you say man there's certain things
[1:21:37] you can control by the Holy Ghost you
[1:21:39] can direct your thoughts you can start
[1:21:41] the morning right and read the word
[1:21:42] first
[1:21:43] instead of magazines and instead of
[1:21:45] filling in for the politics of the world
[1:21:47] I catch myself and you know what's going
[1:21:49] on in the world no no wait a minute let
[1:21:51] me open up find out what's going on in
[1:21:53] God's world
[1:21:54] it's Direct in your mind the way God's
[1:21:56] made us
[1:21:58] you say why do yeah I can't give up
[1:22:00] those things I there's a party who just
[1:22:02] keeps attaching why don't you just think
[1:22:04] about it no don't think about it just
[1:22:06] just realize that you can keep feeding
[1:22:10] on those things and stay where you are
[1:22:15] see somebody has taught us in our
[1:22:16] thinking that we become a religious
[1:22:19] zealot or a bible thumper or a legalist
[1:22:23] because we choose in a day to feed more
[1:22:26] on the word than on the things of this
[1:22:30] the wisdom of this world
[1:22:33] or the films of this world or the
[1:22:36] someone has taught us that and so I
[1:22:38] would venture to say I safe to say that
[1:22:41] a lot of our young people and adults as
[1:22:43] well
[1:22:44] we we have all those little things that
[1:22:47] spend most of our time and there's a
[1:22:49] very small slot that they're receiving
[1:22:51] the knowledge of God what if your vessel
[1:22:53] switched that around
[1:22:57] my wife and I were reading something an
[1:22:59] article about this fellow wrote a book
[1:23:01] about tithes and he says we always have
[1:23:03] on our mind ten percent and so we make
[1:23:05] it like a rule and that is what God gave
[1:23:08] us ten percent of our increase should go
[1:23:10] to God it belongs to him doesn't belong
[1:23:11] to us
[1:23:12] but he says if we think about it it's
[1:23:14] about the giving part so they had
[1:23:16] decided I'm increasing the amount it's
[1:23:18] not 10 for me he raises to something
[1:23:20] else but I'm not telling you do that I'm
[1:23:22] saying that we think about it as soon as
[1:23:24] you just get by with just the minimum
[1:23:28] and you make it a law but it's not a law
[1:23:30] it's about giving
[1:23:33] that one Christian writer writes book he
[1:23:35] started he switched around God blessed
[1:23:37] him and see Switzerland he paid 90
[1:23:38] tithes and him and his wife lived on 10
[1:23:40] percent
[1:23:41] most of us don't have that kind of
[1:23:43] income
[1:23:44] but he felt to do that so I'm just
[1:23:46] saying it's it's it's not letting our
[1:23:49] Common Sense thinking interrupt what the
[1:23:53] spirit is leading us to do
[1:23:55] it's about the heart in God it's about
[1:23:57] connecting with God
[1:23:59] not the mechanical thing I need to do
[1:24:01] this it's a checklist do this do this do
[1:24:04] this the message says do this so you got
[1:24:06] the Bible now you made the message a
[1:24:08] checklist and his brother rap was saying
[1:24:10] a few weeks ago in the New Birth message
[1:24:12] is that we often even take the new birth
[1:24:15] and it's a checklist check check check
[1:24:17] check now I have the new birth
[1:24:21] and God God never gave checklist he just
[1:24:25] said be led by my spirit and I'll take
[1:24:28] you into all truth I will lead you and
[1:24:31] guide you into all truth forgive repent
[1:24:34] when you need to forgive people when
[1:24:37] that you're being moved by the love of
[1:24:38] God let it be released to them no matter
[1:24:41] what they've done
[1:24:43] don't hold back what you're being moved
[1:24:46] on by the holy spirit because it's
[1:24:49] different than your mind
[1:24:51] don't let your mind talk you out of
[1:24:54] living a greater spiritual life
[1:24:56] don't let your thinking talk you out of
[1:24:59] where the holy spirit is taking this
[1:25:02] church and taking the church around the
[1:25:04] world your thinking can interrupt it
[1:25:05] don't let it abort don't let it talk you
[1:25:09] out of the next blessing in your life
[1:25:11] because it will
[1:25:14] your past hurts your fears
[1:25:17] I've been down that path before and it's
[1:25:19] hurt me
[1:25:21] you may not be able to trust a lot of
[1:25:22] things maybe even preachers I don't know
[1:25:25] I don't know
[1:25:27] but the spirit and the love of God if we
[1:25:30] can't trust that moving us we can't
[1:25:32] trust anything
[1:25:35] I say when it's moving and it'll usually
[1:25:38] be moving you to do something different
[1:25:40] than your mind's telling to do
[1:25:42] I see when it does
[1:25:44] Just Go With It
[1:25:46] Just go with it and see what happens
[1:25:48] you might come around and say well I
[1:25:50] really like this living by the spirit
[1:25:52] that's really good
[1:25:55] this is better
[1:25:56] his holy spirit can do further things
[1:26:00] than what we'd ever dreamed
[1:26:03] Come and sing again Raya
[1:26:05] Tina
[1:26:07] Gideon Come and sing it again to us
[1:26:09] what's the first words again Gideon
[1:26:12] what's the first words of the course
[1:26:16] lift your head
[1:26:19] mourning is coming
[1:26:21] what beautiful words you could stand
[1:26:23] I've kept you a long time
[1:26:26] maybe we'll pray first before they sing
[1:26:28] lay your hands on brothers and brothers
[1:26:30] sisters and sisters husbands and wives
[1:26:32] families
[1:26:37] feel the conviction of the precious Lord
[1:26:39] here this morning to not let that pass
[1:26:41] you by don't let your mind interrupt it
[1:26:44] I've been extremely convicted during
[1:26:46] this series myself and I pray that I
[1:26:48] could live a closer life to the Lord
[1:26:49] that's what my desire is that the only
[1:26:52] response response you're gonna going to
[1:26:54] get out of this boy
[1:26:55] is divine love that's where I want to
[1:26:57] live the only response you're ever going
[1:26:59] to hear or see is divine love
[1:27:02] that's what I want and I want to go in a
[1:27:05] Rapture too
[1:27:06] how many wants to go into rapture
[1:27:08] amen let this Faith Faith Works by love
[1:27:11] so if the love was being manifest not
[1:27:15] human love but this do I love then it
[1:27:17] creates faith rapturing faith in the
[1:27:19] word in this love
[1:27:21] might be the key to get out of here
[1:27:25] father thank you Lord for the mercy that
[1:27:28] you've extended to us from God so loved
[1:27:31] the world that he gave his only begotten
[1:27:34] son
[1:27:35] for God so loved in compassion he
[1:27:38] grabbed the lame man and picked him up
[1:27:39] it says Silver and Gold Have I None but
[1:27:42] such as I have give I unto you in the
[1:27:45] name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk oh
[1:27:49] Lord Jesus may we see our position fully
[1:27:53] the way that we should see and I pray
[1:27:55] may your thoughts become our thoughts
[1:27:59] may we cast down imagination and every
[1:28:01] High thing that exalted itself above the
[1:28:04] knowledge of God may we live lead truly
[1:28:08] LED by the spirit of almighty God that's
[1:28:12] our desire forgive us Lord as we forgive
[1:28:15] others and that the ruler in the
[1:28:17] prayerable Lord may we learn from the
[1:28:18] parable that he was moved with
[1:28:20] compassion he acted upon it and Lord
[1:28:22] then that story ends very sad because
[1:28:24] the same fellow that received 35 billion
[1:28:28] dollars in our money
[1:28:30] released of the dead he didn't owe it he
[1:28:32] was forgiven of it turns around and
[1:28:34] requires
[1:28:35] the debt from another person forgive us
[1:28:38] Lord
[1:28:38] [Music]
[1:28:40] that's why you could answer to Peter not
[1:28:43] seven times but 70 times 7.
[1:28:47] oh God help us I pray with your love in
[1:28:50] Jesus name
