[6:32] Matthew chapter 6 we'll just pick it up
[6:34] there's so many good things in here but
[6:35] we'll just have a section here yes verse
[6:38] six would be
[6:40] good but thou when thou prayest enter
[6:43] into thy closet and when thou has shut
[6:46] thy door pray to thy father which is in
[6:49] secret and thy father which seeth in
[6:52] secret shall reward thee openly and then
[6:56] further in prayer when you pray use not
[6:58] vain repetitions as the Heathen do for
[7:01] they think they shall be heard for their
[7:03] much speaking it's not quantity of words
[7:07] it's the quality of words it's not just
[7:10] that you're praying but it's the faith
[7:12] behind your prayer and this is speaking
[7:15] of an effective prayer how many this
[7:16] morning want a effective prayer when you
[7:19] pray and and so then he says be not ye
[7:22] therefore like unto them for your father
[7:25] knoweth what things you have need of
[7:26] before you ask after this manner there
[7:29] pray ye Our Father which art in heaven
[7:32] Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come
[7:35] thy will be done in earth as it is in
[7:38] heaven give us this day our daily bread
[7:41] and forgive us our debts as we forgive
[7:43] our debtors and lead us not into
[7:46] temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for
[7:49] thine is the kingdom and the power and
[7:51] the glory forever amen and that's
[7:54] usually how we end it when we repeat the
[7:56] Lord's Prayer here but it's not finished
[7:58] yet it's says in verse 14 for if you
[8:01] forgive men their trespasses your
[8:04] heavenly father will also forgive you
[8:07] forgiveness is part of the faith of your
[8:10] prayer but if you forgive not men your
[8:13] trespasses neither will your father
[8:15] forgive your trespasses and then we move
[8:18] to Mark 11 that we read uh last Sunday
[8:21] Mark 11 uh the Mountain Moving faith and
[8:25] speaking to the mountain in verse of
[8:27] chapter 11 and verse uh um 23 ver I say
[8:32] to you that whosoever shall say unto
[8:33] this mountain be thou removed and be
[8:36] thou cast into the sea and shalt not
[8:38] doubt in his heart but shall believe
[8:40] that those things which he saith cometh
[8:42] to pass he shall have whatsoever he
[8:45] saith therefore I say unto you what
[8:47] things soever you desire When you pray
[8:50] believe that you receive them and ye
[8:52] shall have them and when you stand
[8:54] praying forgive if you have ought
[8:57] against any that your father also which
[9:00] is in heaven May forgive you your
[9:03] trespasses there's trespasses again
[9:06] that's mentioned but if you do not
[9:08] forgive neither will your father which
[9:10] is in heaven forgive your trespasses I
[9:13] want to speak this morning on the word
[9:15] removing the trespasses to move
[9:18] mountains so brothers and sisters we
[9:20] have another place here that I'd like to
[9:22] teach and preach out of this morning
[9:23] another place in the scripture from what
[9:26] we Le read last Sunday in the Mountain
[9:28] Moving scri scripture and that we speak
[9:30] to the mountain and that type of faith
[9:32] that we could come to to speak to the
[9:34] mountains and they would be removed
[9:36] that's what we desire in our hearts but
[9:39] we have another place in this that this
[9:41] is mentioned our faith is mentioned with
[9:44] the word forgiveness and the theme of
[9:46] forgiveness faith and the prayer of
[9:49] faith is linked in both of these texts
[9:52] with forgiveness and the word uh
[9:54] releasing trespasses and so I want to
[9:57] talk about that this morning because
[9:59] these two places link our faith with the
[10:01] Forgiveness of our heart and there are
[10:03] many other places that I want to get to
[10:06] that the scripture bring these things in
[10:08] and whenever you're talking about faith
[10:10] you must speak about the whole picture
[10:13] of Faith so that we can be in a position
[10:15] of faith and that we can be the right
[10:18] heart for more faith to work through us
[10:20] and God to anoint our faith we must
[10:24] position ourselves to have perfect faith
[10:27] and we must as the scripture is uh
[10:29] showing us we must for Mountain Moving
[10:32] faith we must acknowledge the things
[10:35] that would be in our heart the a that we
[10:37] have against others or the trespasses
[10:40] either that we have done towards God or
[10:42] towards other people or that people have
[10:45] trespassed against us we cannot approach
[10:49] Faith the right way until we approach
[10:52] the the subject of forgiveness and
[10:54] releasing of trespasses can you say amen
[10:57] and this is another scripture that show
[10:59] us because in this particular scripture
[11:02] they they came the disciples as they
[11:04] were watching Jesus pray they came to
[11:07] him after he was done praying and said
[11:09] Lord teach us to pray now the Sun the
[11:11] Sunday school has got the theme this
[11:13] month of prayer so I want to be working
[11:15] in coordination with that as they teach
[11:18] our children about prayer and what
[11:19] prayer is and that we should pray what a
[11:22] powerful thing to teach children can you
[11:24] say Amen that they have access to God
[11:26] that they can speak to the Lord that
[11:28] they don't have to go through a priest
[11:30] but they can utter things from their
[11:32] hearts straight to him and they can hear
[11:34] back from him isn't that a wonderful
[11:36] thing this is the Christian Journey this
[11:38] is what it's all about it's not about
[11:40] all what we wear or church order and
[11:43] these other things but it's that I want
[11:45] to live a life that when I go to God I
[11:47] can pray a whole through to heaven and
[11:49] he can hear my prayer and he can answer
[11:51] back to me amen praise the Lord so now
[11:56] uh the word uh trespasses brought into
[11:58] these and so now they came and asked
[12:00] Jesus teach us to pray Lord would you
[12:03] teach us to pray because they had
[12:06] learned why are they asking Jesus to
[12:09] teach us to pray because they had
[12:10] learned his prayer got through to God
[12:14] can you say Amen they had watched his
[12:17] life they had watched this vessel they
[12:19] had been around him and when and when
[12:22] he's over there in the corner and he's
[12:24] bowed at his knees and he's praying
[12:26] maybe for an hour or two hours and they
[12:28] left him alone they knew these prayers
[12:31] had a different thing now I want I want
[12:32] you to notice something I don't think
[12:34] that the disciples had never prayed
[12:36] before and that's why they were asking
[12:39] him teach us how to pray these were Jews
[12:42] these the Jews prayed to God they prayed
[12:44] to Jehovah they knew that they that that
[12:47] was part of their lives to pray they
[12:49] went into the temple and they prayed and
[12:51] and and and so uh it's it's not they
[12:53] were asking to teach us to pray because
[12:56] they didn't pray but they knew God's
[12:59] Jesus prayers got
[13:03] through they knew Jesus prayers got
[13:06] through and and you know if you ask
[13:08] people in the world you know that's the
[13:10] thing is that everybody prays and that's
[13:12] a good thing I'm not being critical of
[13:14] it but if you ask a sinner sometimes
[13:16] they'll say to you unless they're an
[13:17] atheist and don't believe in God yeah I
[13:19] pray every day I'm always praying to God
[13:22] and so prayer is a common thing to speak
[13:24] to the Lord and and all these other
[13:26] things but you see now Believers today
[13:28] we have to to look at it a little deeper
[13:31] than just saying a prayer how many knows
[13:32] there's a difference in saying a prayer
[13:35] and
[13:36] praying how many knows there's a
[13:38] difference in just saying a prayer at
[13:39] your meal something like that that's
[13:42] wonderful you should do that but there
[13:43] is a difference in saying a prayer and
[13:46] sometimes even a an orthodox prayer a
[13:48] prayer that's a repetitive prayer and
[13:50] it's the same prayer that you repeat and
[13:52] it becomes a tradition that's a big
[13:54] difference in somebody entering into
[13:56] real
[13:57] prayer and praying the prayer of
[14:01] faith and I don't mean to make it
[14:03] something complicated but we must find
[14:06] the prayer of
[14:07] faith especially in the hour that we
[14:10] live
[14:11] in listen friends I'm just going to say
[14:14] it to you we are dealing in Troublesome
[14:17] times we are experiencing demon power
[14:21] like I've never seen it before and if
[14:23] you are engaged in the battle and
[14:25] serving the lord and believing this word
[14:28] and standing ING with it every day and
[14:30] trying then you're facing things that
[14:32] you never faced before the devil as soon
[14:34] as you make a step the devil's going to
[14:37] fight against it and besides this
[14:39] there's Darkness upon the Earth but also
[14:41] on the minds of the people there's an
[14:43] oppression there's a depression there's
[14:47] there's an an oppressing uh spirits that
[14:49] come against you to bring Darkness into
[14:52] your life that you can't even have joy
[14:54] anymore you can't even enjoy moments
[14:56] anymore we're living under an oppression
[14:59] can you say amen and there is no
[15:01] theology there is no psychology that is
[15:04] strong enough to pierce the darkness of
[15:07] this mental depression it takes prayer
[15:11] of faith to pray a whole through to the
[15:13] sky amen it takes getting a hold of God
[15:17] can you say
[15:18] Amen praise the Lord and so they prayed
[15:22] before but they said Lord teach us to
[15:23] pray and I believe a Believer has hunger
[15:27] especially when he sees here prayer that
[15:29] showed results I believe it's the
[15:31] Believers that they wanted to say a
[15:34] prayer like Jesus to be able to get
[15:36] results they they said teach us to pray
[15:39] and it didn't mean that they never
[15:40] didn't mean that we haven't ever prayed
[15:42] before doesn't mean the world says they
[15:44] pray no that means they were hungry for
[15:46] this kind of results from the father
[15:49] what's happening uh teach me what's
[15:51] happening Lord When you pray what
[15:53] something happens your prayer is getting
[15:56] through uh something happens when you
[15:58] pray something happens when you speak
[16:01] there's a power behind you and listen
[16:03] now Jesus had thousands of people around
[16:06] him watching this go on and none of them
[16:08] desired to come and ask Jesus to to
[16:11] teach us to pray but Believers when they
[16:14] see that they say Lord there's something
[16:16] in me teach me that I can pray this
[16:21] way teach me Lord teach me Lord I I I
[16:25] want to I want to grow it's only
[16:27] Believers saying that the the rest of
[16:29] the world say I'll just say my prayers
[16:30] and I'm fine with that but Believers are
[16:32] saying no no I want my prayers to get
[16:35] through I want to hear back from God can
[16:38] I get an amen this morning we need a God
[16:40] that shows up and answers back we got
[16:43] too many young people without the Holy
[16:45] Ghost we got too many oppressing spirits
[16:47] we got too many mental battles I'm
[16:49] telling you we need a God that answers
[16:52] back we got too many Devils fighting
[16:55] against families fighting against
[16:57] marriages we got too much upon us just
[17:00] to have church and just to have a
[17:02] religion we've got to have the prayer of
[17:05] faith that gets through and no wonder
[17:07] people text us brother Brandon and I and
[17:09] the brothers and say put this request on
[17:12] let the people know let the people pray
[17:14] for us because we got confidence
[17:16] somebody in that congregation is going
[17:19] to get through to
[17:20] [Applause]
[17:21] God and I believe this is what we're
[17:23] going to be learning to depend on as the
[17:26] days are
[17:27] coming the economy is going to fall
[17:30] apart we got brothers that's feeling the
[17:32] pressure in this congregation having to
[17:34] work second and third jobs might even
[17:36] have to put the wife to work things like
[17:38] this we got gra grocery prices up 60%
[17:41] we've got all this damage and it's it's
[17:43] not prophesied to get any better so we
[17:45] got pressures that are still coming
[17:47] we're hoping for a relief and I pray
[17:48] there is too but listen now if it if it
[17:51] if there's not a relief to some of the
[17:53] pressure and the insecurity of jobs and
[17:55] income and everything else we're going
[17:57] to have to learn to depend on
[18:00] something come on now it's easy if you
[18:03] got a really good job right now you're
[18:05] making good money it's easy okay yeah I
[18:07] I know but see when you feel the crunch
[18:09] of
[18:11] it we will be driven into a spot to
[18:14] depend on God like we've never depended
[18:16] on him before and I want to be
[18:19] positioned that my prayer
[18:22] counts now I know God hears our prayer
[18:24] but we can read that God hears our
[18:25] prayer but what we need a God that
[18:27] answers back
[18:29] we need a God who answers
[18:33] back praise the Lord and so now uh you
[18:37] know when Sons let me just stop here a
[18:39] minute when sons of God are coming back
[18:43] to Jesus and asking him to teach us you
[18:46] know what that says that shows that they
[18:49] there are sons that want to move to
[18:52] their position and to
[18:54] adoption because adoption adoped said
[18:58] and how many know there's a difference
[18:59] in a birth of a son and an adoption of a
[19:01] son there's some ministers that speak it
[19:04] when you're born again and you receive
[19:06] the Holy Ghost you're a fully adopted
[19:08] son I don't think there's enough
[19:09] scripture to support that or message I
[19:11] believe you're birthed into the kingdom
[19:13] and you grow to an adopted son the very
[19:16] reason you have the Holy Ghost is to
[19:18] bring you to maturity and adoption and
[19:20] bring you to a Rapture you won't make a
[19:22] Rapture without the Holy Ghost but when
[19:24] you receive the Holy Ghost it is the
[19:26] spirit of adoption to take you to
[19:29] adoption and part of the thing of
[19:31] adoption is the separation between is
[19:34] this a son who's teachable from the
[19:36] father to learn Lord I want to do what
[19:39] you do now there's nothing wrong with
[19:42] the son saying to Jesus I you're the Son
[19:44] of God you're the only begotten son but
[19:47] I want to do what you're doing I want
[19:49] the faith that you have I want you to
[19:51] teach me how to be that kind of son I
[19:54] want you to teach me how to pray like
[19:56] you're praying
[19:58] come on and guess what you might not
[20:01] feel worthy to ask that but Sons God has
[20:04] made you worthy to ask the father can
[20:06] you say
[20:07] Amen Lord I'm
[20:09] teachable adopted sons are
[20:12] teachable remember he brings that whole
[20:14] thing out of you know in the Old
[20:16] Testament the Hebrews that the boy when
[20:18] he was young he was a son born into a
[20:20] family but then he's put under a tutor
[20:22] to train him and teach him the father's
[20:24] way teach him the father's business and
[20:26] if it's a son that was rebellious he's
[20:28] still son he's still a son but it's like
[20:30] he could Rebel for years I don't want
[20:32] that I don't want to become like that I
[20:33] want to do something else but when Once
[20:35] the son becomes teachable then the tutor
[20:37] can come back and report to the father
[20:39] and say how's my boy how's my boy by
[20:42] he's so teachable he's he's wanting to
[20:45] learn he's wanting to learn the business
[20:47] of the father he's wanting to become
[20:49] like you can you say amen and when he
[20:51] shows that teachable Spirit somewhere
[20:54] along the line there's an adoption
[20:56] ceremony to say this son I am pleased
[20:59] with how many know there was an adoption
[21:01] ceremony with Jesus sir and what was the
[21:05] adoption the adoption wasn't just a
[21:07] feeling and build three Tabernacles in
[21:10] fact God said don't build Peter James no
[21:13] we're not building Tabernacles we're not
[21:15] building a system to oursel this is
[21:17] about adoption I'm pleased with my son
[21:21] to fill him completely this is my son in
[21:24] whom I'm well pleased this is my desire
[21:26] so it's not a problem for you to come
[21:28] and ask the father to teach you you know
[21:30] why the disciples could feel comfortable
[21:32] doing that because all along Jesus said
[21:36] the works that I do shall you do
[21:39] also right he kept dropping this in and
[21:43] saying now I'm doing this but the works
[21:46] I to do all the sons will do those works
[21:49] oh somebody say praise the Lord don't
[21:51] get quiet on me this morning this is the
[21:53] word of God and I'm talking about you
[21:55] I'm talking about you not somebody
[21:57] sitting next to you I'm talking about
[21:59] you if we're Sons we're in a different
[22:01] category and if we're teachable he'll
[22:03] teach us to position oursel in faith to
[22:07] bring the prayer of faith when you lay
[22:10] your hands on that child with a fever
[22:12] you pray the pray the prayer of
[22:17] faith and so they could ask because
[22:19] Jesus kept hinting and saying listen
[22:23] what I'm doing where I go you will go
[22:26] also he's telling the sons whatever I'm
[22:29] doing so that must have been a stir in
[22:30] their hearts to say I am a son I believe
[22:34] I'm a son and I will do the things that
[22:37] he will do and Sons that are trainable
[22:41] are
[22:42] humble they're humble to admit they're
[22:46] wrong adopted sons that are trainable
[22:49] and wanting to move to adoption their
[22:52] sons are trainable they're humble they
[22:54] admit they are wrong they admit I have
[22:57] been doing things for the Lord maybe
[22:58] even for years but I want to go deeper
[23:01] here's another thing adopted Sons do in
[23:03] their in their teachableness and that is
[23:05] uh you know they want the will of God
[23:08] they want to be truly led by the will of
[23:10] God because they've learned in their
[23:12] immaturity they made decisions in their
[23:15] life sometimes that they called the will
[23:18] of God but they found out it wasn't it
[23:20] was my own will right and so sons that
[23:23] come sober up to say wait a minute I'm a
[23:25] Son of God here Lord teach me how mature
[23:29] because I have learned not only do I
[23:31] want to be taught to pray the prayer of
[23:33] faith but I want to walk truly in the
[23:36] will of God I want to walk like Jesus he
[23:38] said I do nothing except my father shows
[23:40] me and I know he's seen it by Vision but
[23:43] we catch the vision of what God wants to
[23:44] do for his will we want to walk in his
[23:46] will because we've experienced maybe
[23:48] what it is to walk out of his will or
[23:51] sometimes the famous line that comes
[23:52] from people I'm a good person I pray uh
[23:56] you know how many Sinners have Justified
[23:58] self to say I pray to God all the time
[24:00] but there's no change there's no change
[24:02] in their prayer and then sons are
[24:03] teachable to come and say Lord I I I
[24:06] want to walk in your will I want to be
[24:08] uh uh in not only pray the right prayer
[24:11] Faith but I want to walk um it's a son
[24:14] that's saying that it's immature sons
[24:17] that that that is that is uh trying to
[24:20] always fight for their own will can you
[24:24] say amen and trying to make it God's
[24:27] will but they're saying I I truly want
[24:30] God's will can you say
[24:32] Amen sons are
[24:34] teachable Sons do not no longer want to
[24:37] say and you know God gets blamed for a
[24:38] lot of things that we do wrong right
[24:42] because it's God told me to do this and
[24:44] God told me to that and God to if I hear
[24:46] a lot of that attaching God to it it's
[24:48] fine but you better make sure God's
[24:50] really LED you to do that because we
[24:53] feel more comfortable we bring God in
[24:55] God into it and guess what your
[24:56] counselor your pastor is not going to
[24:58] come up against to try to correct you
[25:00] when you say God told you to do
[25:02] it I back off I don't want to be coming
[25:05] against God but how many times years
[25:07] down the road we were and God gets
[25:09] blamed for a lot of stuff we
[25:11] did can I get a witness this morning can
[25:14] I get some people that admit to
[25:16] sometimes doing this we attach we better
[25:18] be careful that we don't attach so
[25:20] things to God we better make sure but
[25:22] mature Sons want to say Lord mature me
[25:25] that I'm not just always pursuing make
[25:27] me teachable especially when there's my
[25:29] prayer I want to be like Jesus but most
[25:32] of all I want my prayer to shake things
[25:35] up I want my prayer to move the heart of
[25:38] God can you say Amen one day the
[25:41] disciples prayed for an epileptic child
[25:43] and they didn't get into results in
[25:45] Matthew 17:14 it says and when they were
[25:47] come to the multitude there came him a
[25:49] certain man kneeling down to him and
[25:51] saying Lord have mercy on my son for
[25:53] he's a lunatic and sore vexed for
[25:55] oftimes he falleth Into the Fire and of
[25:57] into the water
[25:59] Matthew 17:16 and I brought him to thy
[26:01] disciples and they could not cure him
[26:04] then Jesus answered said oh faithless
[26:05] and perverse generation how long shall I
[26:07] be with you how long shall I suffer you
[26:09] bring him th hither to me and Jesus
[26:12] rebuked the devil and he departed out of
[26:14] him and the child was cured from that
[26:15] very hour then came the disciples to
[26:18] Jesus apart and said why could we not
[26:21] cast him out and Jesus said to them
[26:23] because of your unbelief for verily I
[26:25] say unto you if you have faith as a
[26:27] grain of a Mustard Seed ye shall say to
[26:30] this mountain remove hint To Yonder
[26:32] place and it shall remove and nothing
[26:34] shall be impossible unto you how be it
[26:37] this kind goeth not out but by fasting
[26:40] and by prayer so now you could attach
[26:42] yourself just to the fasting and prayer
[26:44] you say okay I need to do more prayer
[26:45] and more fasting I believe that doesn't
[26:47] say how much you fast I believe it's a
[26:50] dedication it's a positioning yourself
[26:52] to be available to God with all things
[26:55] cleared up from your heart that you
[26:56] could pray the prayer of bringing the
[26:59] impossible God in impossible situations
[27:02] the disciples weren't there
[27:04] yet but he says because of your unbelief
[27:07] there's still too much in your heart
[27:08] there's still too much there and he says
[27:11] but when you pray you can move
[27:15] mountains you know he's hinting you're
[27:17] going to come to
[27:18] this oh praise the Lord you're going to
[27:21] come to this kind of Faith you're going
[27:23] to come and when you do you could say
[27:26] Mountain be removed and cast into the
[27:28] sea and nothing shall be impossible
[27:30] nothing shall be impossible to you they
[27:32] were not there yet of course they needed
[27:35] the Holy Ghost which would bring them
[27:37] faith in their part to speak to
[27:38] mountains but he didn't say oh you know
[27:41] Jesus didn't say when they come to him
[27:43] and they prayed for this epileptic and
[27:45] nothing happened Jesus did not say oh
[27:48] you guys are you're losers you'll never
[27:51] get this you will never have this no he
[27:54] said you don't have perfect faith yet
[27:56] but you will get it if if your position
[27:58] is right and you know who you are
[28:01] standing with the token nothing shall
[28:04] stand before your prayer nothing shall
[28:07] be impossible to you thank you for
