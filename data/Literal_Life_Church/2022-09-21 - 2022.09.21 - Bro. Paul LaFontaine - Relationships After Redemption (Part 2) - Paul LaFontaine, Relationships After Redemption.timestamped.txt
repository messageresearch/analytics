[0:11] Amen we can pull on the word of God and
[0:14] enjoy the word of God and join in
[0:17] together with his spirit and we just
[0:20] love you and appreciate you and brother
[0:21] Ken sister Anita enjoyed the fellowship
[0:23] last night within catching up and also
[0:25] just the good history that we have with
[0:28] them and helping us with the church many
[0:30] years ago and to see God's grace in
[0:32] their life we're still here brother Ken
[0:34] we're still here by the gods of grace
[0:36] and the devil don't like it but we're
[0:38] still here
[0:39] we're not going to go away amen
[0:42] praise the Lord still fighting the
[0:43] battle praise the Lord Acts chapter 2
[0:45] and I'm just going back into a few
[0:48] things out of the scripture from a
[0:51] couple weeks ago but also just picking
[0:52] it up where we left off and so we'll
[0:54] just remind you of these um references
[0:57] or I called them windows of the
[0:59] relationship I'm going to call this
[1:00] tonight relationships after Redemption
[1:03] part two and talk a little bit about it
[1:06] here Acts chapter 2 and verse 41 it says
[1:10] then they that gladly received his word
[1:13] were baptized and the same day they were
[1:16] added unto them three thousand souls and
[1:18] they continued steadfastly in the
[1:19] apostles Doctrine and fellowship and in
[1:22] Breaking of bread and in prayers and
[1:24] fear Came Upon every soul and Many
[1:26] Wonders and signs were done by the
[1:29] apostles and all that believe were
[1:31] together and had all things common and
[1:34] sold their possessions and goods and
[1:36] parted them to all men as every man had
[1:40] need notice the the Holy Ghost working
[1:43] in the church one of the things that
[1:45] brought out is they became very
[1:47] sensitive and aware of another man's
[1:49] needs in other words the selfishness had
[1:51] gone away and they became become aware
[1:54] of the needs within their own body and
[1:55] other needs and begin to do things to
[1:58] try to help in those needs whatever they
[2:00] could
[2:00] and they continuing daily with one
[2:02] Accord in the temple and breaking bread
[2:04] from house to house because there was no
[2:06] church buildings at that time for the
[2:08] Believers they broke bread from house to
[2:11] house and did eat their meat with
[2:12] gladness and singleness of heart
[2:14] praising God having favor with all the
[2:17] people in the Lord added to the church
[2:19] daily such it should be saved sounds all
[2:22] positive to me can you say mom and then
[2:24] Acts chapter 4 I think I was reading as
[2:27] well Acts chapter 4 and verse 32 verses
[2:31] 31 and when they had prayed the place
[2:33] was shaken where they were assembled
[2:35] together and they were all filled with
[2:36] the Holy Ghost and they spake with the
[2:38] word the word of God with boldness and
[2:40] The Malt of the multitude of them that
[2:42] believed were of one heart and of one
[2:45] Soul neither said any of them that all
[2:47] the things which he possessed was his
[2:48] own but they had all things common and
[2:51] with great power gave the apostles
[2:53] witness of the resurrection of the Lord
[2:56] Jesus and great grace was upon them all
[2:59] can you say men tonight may God add the
[3:02] blessing to the reading of his word you
[3:04] may be seated we'll just go on tonight a
[3:06] little bit in a study together and
[3:08] ministering and teaching and preaching
[3:10] and whatever the Lord has for us tonight
[3:12] to encourage you in the faith of God and
[3:14] we certainly heard a good message on
[3:16] Sunday about the altar of offenses and
[3:19] the altar of faith and if I have any
[3:21] altar of the fences in my life I don't I
[3:23] want to destroy those altars and I want
[3:25] to have an altar of faith that I worship
[3:27] at before God I really really enjoyed
[3:30] the word Sunday and just that approach
[3:32] to it never quite heard it that way and
[3:34] so we appreciate brother Timothy and his
[3:36] uh just yielding to the Lord that way it
[3:38] was very helpful to me personally and I
[3:40] know it was many to many others and I
[3:42] just encourage the rest of you maybe
[3:43] that didn't respond too much that it's
[3:47] time to gave up those offenses it's time
[3:49] to take that mountain of fences in your
[3:51] life and and destroy that altar it's
[3:53] time to move on with faith praise the
[3:55] Lord
[3:55] so this as we look at these things in
[3:58] the book of Acts we see the first
[4:00] account of uh relationships not not only
[4:04] with God relationship with God and with
[4:06] others and you know from the series that
[4:08] everything that um that was lost in the
[4:11] Garden of Eden now has been restored and
[4:14] man has been restored back that
[4:15] everything he lost besides his new body
[4:17] he's received everything back again and
[4:21] so now we have this Oneness with God now
[4:24] that they hadn't had for all these
[4:26] thousands of years now they've come back
[4:28] into it by the Holy Spirit coming in
[4:30] them they've become one it wasn't a
[4:33] religion it wasn't rules it wasn't a
[4:36] duty it wasn't some new religion that
[4:39] come along it was completely separate
[4:40] than religion it was an internal work of
[4:43] the Holy Spirit coming in the soul the
[4:45] control tower and he himself came in so
[4:48] that by one Spirit they became one with
[4:51] God again so that's totally different
[4:53] than a mental exercise or deny
[4:55] domination or a Duty or a code of ethics
[4:58] to live by it goes beyond any of that
[5:01] and should never be associated with that
[5:03] it's the power of God coming into the
[5:05] vigil and he at that moment comes in
[5:08] Oneness with God and there's no man can
[5:10] take that away
[5:12] and so I want to emphasize tonight
[5:14] relationship over rules relationship
[5:17] over uh religion of course and so they
[5:21] had come after being redeemed into a
[5:23] real relationship with God here that
[5:25] they hadn't experienced since the Garden
[5:26] of Eden quite this way people have been
[5:28] anointed prophets had come the people
[5:31] had been blessed well there's some
[5:32] healed there's many powerful things that
[5:35] took place but they had never had
[5:37] relationship like this with God for
[5:39] thousands of years until this Upper Room
[5:42] when all of a sudden everything that was
[5:44] lost from Adam and Eve come back again
[5:46] that's a pretty powerful thing so in the
[5:49] book of Acts that we read here this kind
[5:51] of the first window that we have of the
[5:53] book of Acts church and what it looked
[5:55] like and I'm emphasizing the
[5:57] relationship part but there are many
[5:58] things that God did in the book of Acts
[6:01] and all of them none of them are to be
[6:03] cast aside we're we're we should have
[6:07] the word working in our lives and the
[6:09] spirit work in our lives that even
[6:10] personally we should be able to write a
[6:12] book of Acts in our lives it may not be
[6:16] as big as this book maybe yours is but
[6:18] nevertheless there should be acts of God
[6:20] in your life that you can write a story
[6:22] at the end of all this and if there was
[6:25] a future if there was a future
[6:27] generation they could read your story
[6:29] and and have a book of Acts from your
[6:31] life
[6:32] praise the Lord so now the we see this
[6:35] power in a redeemed people back to
[6:37] everything Eden lost except for the new
[6:39] body brother Brown says in purpose in
[6:42] life in spirit and envision everything
[6:46] had been restored back from Eden again
[6:48] except a new body they were in every way
[6:51] purpose Vision life and spirit they were
[6:54] every way restored back to the Garden of
[6:56] Eden again in spirit and so it's the
[6:59] same today and we should know then that
[7:02] it did not take very long
[7:04] uh until the Antichrist Spirit began to
[7:08] come into those days of the book of Acts
[7:10] and that shouldn't surprise us because
[7:13] Satan entered the Oneness with Adam and
[7:16] Eve right away and destroyed their
[7:18] Oneness so now when you have the same
[7:20] Oneness it shouldn't be a surprise that
[7:23] Satan comes in in the early church and
[7:25] begins to bring that Antichrist spirit
[7:27] and begins to do and one way we know
[7:29] it's the Antichrist spirit it's just
[7:31] working against what's happening in the
[7:34] church it's doing something opposite can
[7:36] you say Amen it's presenting a different
[7:38] a different way to God than coming
[7:40] through the Holy Ghost
[7:42] and that's how we know that the
[7:44] Antichrist spirit is working is that
[7:46] when you see this love when you see this
[7:48] Fellowship when you see this coronia
[7:51] when you see this this pureness this
[7:54] this guileless atmosphere going on with
[7:57] this this uh speaking in uh tongues that
[8:01] uh they heard him in their own language
[8:02] when you see the spirit making them like
[8:04] drunk men when you see all of this going
[8:07] on then then Satan is coming on the
[8:10] scene because his agenda is to stop this
[8:13] and present another gospel so we know if
[8:16] you have good things going on in church
[8:18] and the spirit is moving and God's doing
[8:20] things and there's Harmony and Oneness
[8:22] and love get ready for the Antichrist
[8:25] spirit
[8:27] amen you're going to fight it can you
[8:29] say Amen you're going to fight this it's
[8:30] going to be a battle I like what brother
[8:32] landline said is that when they come
[8:34] into the promised land that's when their
[8:35] battles began and people say it's not
[8:38] fair it's not fair that all these things
[8:39] are happening to me and all this battle
[8:41] but you what you should say is if you're
[8:43] having all these trials then you're
[8:45] probably possessing some land
[8:48] you're probably gaining ground because
[8:51] as you gain more ground the battle
[8:53] intensifies from your enemy more trials
[8:57] no more pressures because he can't stand
[8:59] Oneness and here in the early church he
[9:01] starts to turn against it and starts to
[9:03] come in an antichrist Spirit we're not
[9:05] going to talk a lot about that but it is
[9:07] relevant to say this that when you see
[9:10] the good things of God coming like they
[9:12] did at the book of Acts get ready for
[9:14] the Antichrist Spirit to come real close
[9:16] and to work against it even in the
[9:19] message
[9:21] even in the message
[9:23] so when it manifests
[9:26] everything contrary to this new
[9:29] relationship the Antichrist spirit will
[9:30] manifest everything contrary to this new
[9:32] relationship they had this new Oneness
[9:34] with God is what was produced in not
[9:36] only Miracles and signs and wonders but
[9:39] it produced the right relationship with
[9:41] God the right relationship with
[9:43] Believers the right relationship with
[9:45] families the relationship with God is
[9:48] what they had first it was a perfect
[9:50] relation Jack relationship back with him
[9:52] again and I want to just say now this
[9:55] relationship in the book of Acts that
[9:57] had had not been there for thousands of
[10:00] years and now they come out of the upper
[10:02] room with this this this my spirit this
[10:05] connection with God that they never had
[10:08] since the book of Eden when this began
[10:10] this relationship was before they had a
[10:15] church to Worship in
[10:18] can I say it relationship is before
[10:21] attending church
[10:24] because these guys didn't have a church
[10:26] to go to you
[10:27] ought to praise the Lord tonight you
[10:28] have a church to go to
[10:29] you ought to go to it can you say mine
[10:32] but you see now this this relationship
[10:35] didn't require to have a church building
[10:41] this relationship in the book of Acts
[10:43] was before Worship in church it was
[10:46] before church order came
[10:48] Paul brought Church order later so they
[10:51] had relationship before they had Church
[10:53] order oh can I get an amen tonight I'm
[10:56] not dumping out Church order I'm glad
[10:58] for it but I'm telling you the book of
[11:00] Acts had relationship before they had
[11:02] Church order
[11:03] before they handed out the Cod books to
[11:05] everybody there was no Cod books it was
[11:09] about relationship and that's it a
[11:12] simple relationship by spirit and
[11:14] Oneness with God before they had the Cod
[11:16] books
[11:17] before church order was handed out can
[11:19] you say Amen before let's say some other
[11:23] things before modesty was taught
[11:26] before modesty was taught or the woman
[11:29] should have uncut hair and the man
[11:32] should cut his hair before any of that
[11:34] was said before any of it they had a
[11:36] relationship
[11:39] before Paul broke into the mystery of
[11:42] Christ in the book of Ephesians before
[11:44] Paul broke down the Old Testament
[11:45] shadows and explored the Christ revealed
[11:48] in the Old Testament before the riches
[11:50] of the Revelation the theophany bodies
[11:52] when he said if this Earthly Tabernacle
[11:54] be destroyed we have one waiting on the
[11:56] other side before all of those
[11:58] Revelations the thing before those
[12:00] Revelations was relationship with God by
[12:03] the Holy Ghost
[12:04] so I tell you today what's more
[12:06] important what's most important all
[12:08] that's important but relationship is
[12:10] more important
[12:12] didn't Paul say though I understand all
[12:15] Mysteries
[12:17] though I understand how to give my body
[12:19] to be burned and I feed the poor and I
[12:21] give and I do all those things and I
[12:24] understand all the Mysteries and yet I
[12:26] can still be locking the main thing
[12:29] somebody say praise the Lord
[12:31] so now before uh before Paul preached
[12:35] all these things before the riches of
[12:37] the Revelation before all this had to be
[12:40] a relationship first by the Holy Ghost
[12:43] and all of that was important but never
[12:46] to be put before relationship in
[12:48] Simplicity before the book of Acts
[12:51] Church could produce anything that they
[12:54] did they each one had to come into
[12:57] relationship by the Oneness of the
[13:00] spirit as a matter of fact you could
[13:02] never produce the book of Acts church
[13:04] and what they manifested without the
[13:06] relationship first
[13:09] now how does Satan duplicate the signs
[13:13] the Wonders the Miracles which he can
[13:14] can you say amen he can work through
[13:16] their things and and and you see then
[13:18] then to me I've always viewed it this
[13:21] way is Satan is watching what's going on
[13:23] because remember this is the first time
[13:24] for thousands of years he's seen this
[13:26] type of uh spirit in the people like
[13:28] this and he's just an observer he's not
[13:31] a Creator and he always tries to
[13:33] duplicate or or or to mess up what God
[13:36] is doing or to try to give an alternate
[13:38] alternative route than the Holy Ghost so
[13:40] he's watching them come out of the room
[13:42] they're acting like drunk men I mean he
[13:44] remembered David and David got happened
[13:46] he danced and before the ark coming in
[13:48] so he knows some happy people that got
[13:51] happy about the Lord but never was it
[13:53] quite like this and then he watched them
[13:54] hearing the other nations hearing them
[13:56] in their own language as they glorified
[13:58] God so Satan every time he observes
[14:01] things and he was there observing it all
[14:03] every time he's there he's always
[14:05] thinking how can I counterfeit this
[14:10] how can I bring uh something that's
[14:15] similar to it that can distract the
[14:17] people from the real thing
[14:20] and that's why you have so many quotes
[14:23] of brother Branham talking about the
[14:25] Pentecostals able to shout dance speak
[14:29] in tongues because we got Satan that can
[14:32] can uh can duplicate and put that all
[14:35] that stuff on and still that person not
[14:38] have the Holy Ghost
[14:40] didn't brother Brown say it
[14:42] and it's only because Satan the deceiver
[14:44] is trying to counterfeit it by something
[14:46] you do on the outside now catch that now
[14:48] that's denominational because when Satan
[14:51] brings something it's to try to get you
[14:52] to do stuff on the outside without
[14:54] relationship
[14:57] Satan does not want you and Oneness with
[14:59] God he doesn't want to he's jealous of
[15:01] your relationship with God and one thing
[15:03] about it if he watched them come down he
[15:05] tried to duplicate he tried to do all
[15:07] these other things throughout the ages
[15:09] and then Azusa Street comes which is a
[15:11] genuine work of God but then you have
[15:13] people going into emphasizing the gifts
[15:16] more and more instead of The Giver
[15:20] so you had a genuine work of Pentecost
[15:22] to restore the joy to the church the
[15:25] happiness of the church the gifts in the
[15:27] church
[15:28] but you have Satan right away
[15:30] counterfeiting it
[15:31] and now you have people able to speak in
[15:34] tongues and actually give a true
[15:36] prophecy under the anointing and they
[15:38] themselves are not many of them in
[15:41] relationship by the Holy Ghost and the
[15:43] soul
[15:44] they got the Holy Ghost on their Spirit
[15:45] they prophesied correctly but they
[15:47] didn't get it in their soul so they had
[15:49] no Oneness with God
[15:50] now I don't think we should just try to
[15:53] understand that because I don't know how
[15:55] I don't know how Satan can do it but we
[15:57] know after this many years 2000 years
[15:58] he's done it
[16:00] what is it all about keeping men and
[16:03] women from the real thing
[16:07] have them dress up right or have them go
[16:10] to church or have them burn a candle all
[16:13] of religious systems Satan has been
[16:16] behind the systems not the people but
[16:18] behind systems to misdirect the people
[16:20] away from one thing the relationship of
[16:23] the Holy Ghost in the upper room
[16:27] get them away from that
[16:29] and we might as well be honest that even
[16:32] our own ranks the emphasis has come on
[16:34] other things instead of somebody getting
[16:37] a true relationship come on now I should
[16:39] get get bigger amens than that
[16:42] we might as well be honest can you say
[16:44] man it happens sometimes even in our own
[16:46] ranks we don't want to do that to the
[16:48] young people we don't want to present a
[16:49] code we don't want to say if you just do
[16:51] this if you just dress this way if you
[16:52] act this way if you just come to church
[16:54] and be here every service then you're
[16:55] okay we don't want to deceive people
[16:57] like that we want the Holy Spirit to
[16:59] come down and he makes a personal
[17:00] connection with them and they turn their
[17:02] lives over and there's a relationship
[17:04] when they walk out the door they may not
[17:06] be dressing all right yet they may
[17:08] understand everything brother Paul
[17:09] preached but they've come into a
[17:11] relationship with God he can talk to
[17:14] them he can they can talk back to him
[17:16] there's a relationship started and
[17:19] that's what we want
[17:21] not just some phony something but a real
[17:23] they've entered into I'm not just
[17:26] talking to God through my parents now or
[17:28] saying prayers when I talk to them I
[17:30] know that I'm in relationship with him
[17:32] by the Holy Ghost praise the Lord that's
[17:33] what we need
[17:35] and and so now this all come by the Holy
[17:38] Ghost and all of that was important but
[17:40] never all those other things are
[17:42] important the church order but never to
[17:45] be put before relationship never to be
[17:48] put before relationship in Simplicity
[17:51] before the book of Acts Church could
[17:53] produce anything that each one had to
[17:54] come into relationship first
[17:57] all other things came out of that
[17:59] all other things in the book of Acts
[18:02] including the Miracles and signs of
[18:04] Wonders should come out of the
[18:06] relationship first
[18:08] a redeemed son and daughter of God
[18:13] amen
[18:15] wake up
[18:17] wake up Girl Say Amen
[18:19] praise the Lord
[18:21] I'm tired too but
[18:23] you know
[18:24] I override it
[18:26] and I'm asking you to do that
[18:28] some of these guys doing exams these
[18:30] kids and young people Solomon has had an
[18:33] exam tonight and just so many things I
[18:35] always feel for him you know they're
[18:37] trying to do this but they're here
[18:38] tonight they're listening online putting
[18:40] God first you know what God bless you
[18:43] God bless you uh you're you're allowed
[18:45] to be a little tired
[18:47] amen but you're here and uh wouldn't
[18:49] mind some louder amens though
[18:54] come on brother can't help me out you're
[18:55] not tired are you
[18:59] so it should be said here now that
[19:01] whenever someone leads somebody
[19:04] to jump past to the other stuff first
[19:07] before relationship and skip the true
[19:10] connection directly with God they
[19:12] mislead that person
[19:16] you know we just had a minister here
[19:18] Sunday who was willing to admit and be
[19:20] honest enough before this congregation
[19:21] and whoever else was listening that he
[19:24] grew up in this message and he grew up
[19:25] in all this and even preached and he
[19:28] said but but I did not have the
[19:31] relationship with Christ that he needed
[19:33] even though he grew up in the message
[19:35] takes a lot for a minister to say that
[19:37] and you know a lot of our message
[19:39] ministers aren't honest enough to say
[19:40] things like that but but Wesley was
[19:43] Wesley said that he preached for I think
[19:47] for quite a few years and knew he didn't
[19:49] have what he needed
[19:51] so he just said I'm going to keep
[19:53] preaching it until I get it
[19:55] that's John Wesley he knew there was a
[19:58] greater work than justification and God
[20:00] led him into sanctification he started
[20:02] to see it in the word but he knew he
[20:04] didn't have that deeper work of the Holy
[20:05] Ghost so he said I kept preaching it and
[20:07] I think he came to the United States he
[20:09] was preaching it over here he was
[20:10] preaching it and something happened he
[20:12] had an experience with God for himself
[20:14] and he was never the same again
[20:17] we had a minister do that this Sunday I
[20:19] praise him for that I think it's a
[20:21] wonderful thing I just heard a another
[20:23] Minister this afternoon
[20:25] uh apologize and recant some of the
[20:28] things he said a couple years ago and he
[20:30] did it publicly and I'll say you know
[20:32] we're getting somewhere when we have
[20:34] that kind of humility in Ministry can
[20:36] you say man we're getting somewhere
[20:37] that's the adoption I'm looking for
[20:39] that's the humility I'm looking for is
[20:41] that we're not perfect in our flesh can
[20:43] you say Amen none of us have a perfect
[20:46] dissecting this word but we're all
[20:48] working together as a body under the
[20:50] Holy Ghost and he's going to bring us to
[20:52] everything that he promised through
[20:54] brother Bradham and through the prophets
[20:55] can you say Amen he's going to bring it
[20:57] to us but let's not get arrogant that we
[20:59] think we know everything let's be
[21:01] willing to make make mistakes and
[21:03] willing to uh to apologize for mistakes
[21:07] now when that happens I know then we're
[21:09] getting somewhere where the spirit of
[21:11] God can really move
[21:12] a genuine move of God
[21:15] I appreciate him doing it so now
[21:17] uh
[21:19] we if we skip over the relationship part
[21:22] looking at the relationship of a simple
[21:25] redeemed people in the book of Acts as I
[21:28] said before church order before all
[21:30] these things and but then we see Paul
[21:32] says later in second Corinthians 11
[21:35] verse 3 but I fear lest by any means as
[21:39] the serpent beguiled Eve through his
[21:41] septility so your mind should be
[21:44] corrupted
[21:45] from the Simplicity that is in Christ
[21:49] so now the early church comes out of the
[21:51] upper room we go through the book of
[21:53] Acts and it's early now in the second
[21:55] book of Corinthians that we see Paul
[21:57] sharing his fear and his burden as the
[22:01] Antichrist comes in what would be his
[22:03] work to complicate things to grab a hold
[22:07] of
[22:08] the do's and don'ts and for people to
[22:11] skip the relationship
[22:13] and grab a hold of the do's and don'ts
[22:16] and complicate salvation and complicate
[22:20] the Simplicity of relationship and
[22:22] companies and he said who's who will be
[22:24] doing it the same serpent that talked to
[22:27] Eve would complicate and take them from
[22:29] the Simplicity of this Oneness and this
[22:31] relationship with God men preachers
[22:34] would be used of Satan to complicate the
[22:37] Simplicity in Jesus Christ
[22:41] and did Satan do it yes he did
[22:44] yes he did messing with the people's
[22:47] minds and to me we're we're reading the
[22:51] Simplicity of a relationship with Jesus
[22:54] Christ in the early church
[22:57] it's God in Simplicity it's the
[22:59] Simplicity of Christ
[23:00] and that spoils down to a true Holy
[23:03] Ghost Oneness relationship
[23:07] with God yourself
[23:09] I fear less by any means some some Force
[23:13] begins to take you away from that
[23:16] Simplicity because it all starts with a
[23:18] relationship and it should end with
[23:20] relationship
[23:22] and now we have I heard a wonderful
[23:24] testimony last night
[23:25] we have people
[23:29] that start off
[23:31] maybe some of them don't start in a good
[23:32] way they start off maybe in a good way
[23:34] and then they're distracted by the
[23:38] movement and by things that happen and
[23:41] they get bitter and they can go
[23:43] sometimes 20 30 40 years and they go run
[23:46] away from it all I never want to darken
[23:48] another church door I never want to come
[23:49] around this and then you watch the grace
[23:51] of God just reach out and go get them
[23:56] he's a wonderful testimony I would not
[23:58] certainly wouldn't mention the name but
[24:00] it's it's uh it's someone we knew many
[24:03] years ago and all of a sudden running
[24:04] away from God and away from because what
[24:07] she was run away from was not the God of
[24:09] this message not who brother Branham was
[24:12] as a man as a Christian that's all to me
[24:15] pure
[24:17] but it was all the stuff that was
[24:20] the confusion that went around all the
[24:23] movement of it she ran from that but you
[24:25] can't run from God
[24:27] so some people go through a journey of
[24:29] sometimes even starting in a simple
[24:31] relationship and that's what above we
[24:34] should keep that
[24:35] now let me qualify in case some
[24:38] preachers criticize me on this maybe is
[24:40] that Simplicity in Christ is not dumping
[24:42] out revelation
[24:44] and further Revelation Simplicity of
[24:46] Christ is not stopping to grow to full
[24:48] knowledge of the word of God
[24:50] can you say Amen but it's knowing the
[24:53] one in me and in you that can never
[24:55] change whether I can understand it all
[24:59] or not when I'm into relationship with
[25:01] God and I know that I know that I know
[25:04] that I have it and God doesn't say
[25:06] you're going to lose it if you don't
[25:08] understand everything by next week
[25:13] I'm going to give you a year and if you
[25:15] don't catch all of these Seven Seals
[25:16] you're done in my relationship that's
[25:19] not God at all if you have a Oneness
[25:21] Holy Ghost relationship listen you the
[25:24] devil cannot take that away from you
[25:26] nothing can take that away from you you
[25:29] may sit in services and say I I don't
[25:31] have a clue what that guy is saying and
[25:33] then everyone say you catch that
[25:34] Revelation then it grows then it grows
[25:36] and it is and that's all fine but newer
[25:38] converts sometimes they may not have a
[25:40] clue but there's something deeper
[25:41] working in them and they say I don't
[25:43] know a lot but I know I come into
[25:45] relationship with God I know I got the
[25:47] Holy Spirit I know I got the amenor down
[25:50] the inside and the mind is saying I
[25:53] don't mind this thing I don't understand
[25:54] but the soul is saying Amen to the word
[25:57] of God
[25:58] because you can't be saying amen from
[26:00] the soul unless you got the amenor down
[26:02] there
[26:04] oh isn't it wonderful but God doesn't
[26:06] have all this you know and so but you
[26:09] say now he a Christian with relationship
[26:11] with the true Holy Spirit he he knows
[26:14] that the one living in him said the Holy
[26:16] Ghost will lead you and guide you into
[26:20] all truth
[26:22] so they're not nervous about how much
[26:24] they know because they know I got the
[26:26] one that knows it all
[26:27] and he's leading me and I'm not going to
[26:30] be missing out on anything I'm going to
[26:31] get everything that I need and that
[26:33] preacher that seems so Way Beyond me or
[26:35] that other brother in the church there
[26:37] Way Beyond me you're not intimidated by
[26:39] it because I've got the same author of
[26:41] what God showed them I've got him living
[26:43] in me and everything I need to know God
[26:46] is not an Indian giver first of all and
[26:48] then God is not specific at who he gives
[26:50] something else and gives another greater
[26:52] Revelation to somebody else he doesn't
[26:53] do that every son and daughter of God
[26:55] has availability to the mystery of
[26:58] Christ
[27:00] but sometimes it takes time before God
[27:03] reveals things to you it's in his time
[27:06] you'll get it all
[27:07] you might not even get it off of your
[27:09] mind we probably won't but you'll get
[27:12] just enough and you'll get so full in
[27:15] your soul that this body can't take the
[27:18] Revelation anymore
[27:20] and you'll get a new body and that's
[27:21] what it's all about anyway he's not
[27:23] going to hand out rewards on the other
[27:24] side with how many message books we read
[27:26] and how much knowledge we had and how we
[27:28] could break down the Seven Seals
[27:29] there'll be no rewards for that it's
[27:31] that we got enough full of Revelation
[27:33] that we got out of here in a body change
[27:36] ah somebody ought to shout Glory
[27:37] Hallelujah tonight amen it's about
[27:40] relationship
[27:43] it's about relation
[27:46] with a relationship
[27:48] and then everything works out of that
[27:51] I remember when I was speaking about the
[27:53] Old Testament God came down and I read
[27:55] you the scriptures I want a kingdom of
[27:57] priest he didn't he didn't want to see
[27:59] him as the children of Israel he wanted
[28:00] to see him grow mature adults and mature
[28:02] priests a people who are close to me and
[28:05] follow me and love me with all their
[28:07] heart soul mind and strength this is the
[28:08] some of the first things God come out of
[28:10] God's mind when he spoke through Moses
[28:12] he said I want a people for my name's
[28:14] sake and I want a people that love me
[28:17] with all their heart soul mind this was
[28:21] before the law this is before the codes
[28:23] this is before the dietary laws this was
[28:26] before what came out of the mountain God
[28:28] was saying his purpose I want to I want
[28:30] to be in relationship with people until
[28:33] somebody says I love you Lord with all
[28:36] of my heart so mind and strength
[28:39] and if you'll keep that then whatever I
[28:42] bring you is the word of God I know
[28:44] you'll do it because you love me I know
[28:46] you do it because you're in relationship
[28:48] with me and I know when you don't
[28:50] understand it you'll come to me and say
[28:52] God I don't understand but I still love
[28:55] you
[28:57] none of this you better show me Lord I'm
[28:59] bailing out
[29:00] that's not relationship learn something
[29:03] about relationship and marriage or
[29:04] anything else it is not a Godly
[29:06] relationship when in every moment you're
[29:08] threatening to bail out
[29:12] he better not offend me or I'll just
[29:14] bail out
[29:16] what kind of marriage would that be
[29:17] watch it Buster
[29:19] you say something to me hubby
[29:23] I'll just bail out
[29:25] that's not relationship
[29:27] relationship in God is eternal love
[29:31] you come back into a cycle you got out
[29:34] of the cycle of love but it's an eternal
[29:36] love it doesn't give up and you jump
[29:38] into that cycle and there's no getting
[29:40] saved every year at Camp there's no
[29:43] backsliding for several years you come
[29:45] into relationship it's an eternal love
[29:47] and you may not understand everything
[29:49] but there's one thing can never Satan
[29:51] can never take away this love and
[29:53] passion that I feel for God it's a
[29:55] relationship with him
[29:56] praise be to God
[29:59] amen you know I can preach that with
[30:01] fire because that's what I came into at
[30:03] 16 years old
[30:04] and I've seen a lot of stuff but when I
[30:07] can go in the morning have my devotions
[30:08] and I still have this love I've got a
[30:10] sponge God show me something in your
[30:12] word I come to you and I talk to him he
[30:14] talks back to me I may not understand a
[30:16] lot of things other ministers do but
[30:18] nobody has been able to take away what
[30:21] happened to me when I was 16 years old I
[30:23] came into relationship with Jesus Christ
[30:26] through this message
[30:28] I met the god of William Branham I met
[30:31] the Christ of William Branham
[30:34] it's not about a man to me it's about
[30:36] Christ
[30:38] I came into relationship and the devil's
[30:41] never been able to brother Ken the devil
[30:43] has never been able to take that
[30:45] relationship away
[30:47] I have failed I have made mistakes I
[30:50] have done done things but he's Satan has
[30:53] never been able to steal that
[30:55] relationship
[30:57] and when you peel back all the laters
[30:59] that's what counts anyway
[31:01] that's what counts right if you can go
[31:03] back in your life if you can't you
[31:04] better seek the Lord say Lord I need a
[31:06] relationship this is a religion to me
[31:08] I'm putting it on
[31:09] but if you get sick go back and say
[31:11] whatever age it was I know that I know
[31:15] God dealt with me and I come into
[31:16] relationship with him you ought to cling
[31:18] to that say if you got off track say I'm
[31:20] clinging that because I know God dealt
[31:21] with me then and I'm going to start
[31:23] working off of there
[31:24] is that okay
[31:26] so God come down and says I want a
[31:27] people that loves me with all their
[31:29] heart soul mind and strength that's what
[31:31] he wanted then he gave the law through
[31:32] the pro through a prophet and then I'm
[31:34] going somewhere with this then here's
[31:37] what brother Bob said they the people
[31:40] chose law
[31:42] over Grace
[31:44] and God never sent the law of Moses
[31:47] through the prophet for them to make it
[31:49] a law and choose okay now we got do's
[31:51] and don'ts we do this we don't do this
[31:54] we do this God never intended to for it
[31:57] to become a law in their lifestyle he
[31:59] intended for them to continue to walk by
[32:01] grace and relationship
[32:04] and to realize everything that he was
[32:06] bringing was to be approached through
[32:09] that relationship that he they loved him
[32:12] with all their heart because you can
[32:14] never say like denominations say the law
[32:16] that's finished we only go with the New
[32:18] Testament that's a lie that's not true
[32:19] what came from Moses was from God
[32:22] God didn't say I'm going to send them a
[32:24] law and they'll be condemned by it well
[32:25] the law does continue but Grace gets set
[32:28] you free can you say Amen but God didn't
[32:30] send those things to be mean to the
[32:32] people he sent them for a reason but he
[32:34] never intended for people to live by law
[32:37] live by that law but to live by his
[32:39] grace and relationship
[32:42] so now brother Bram says it this way one
[32:44] quote I have tonight they were baptized
[32:46] repented and were baptized and come to
[32:48] walk in New in a new life in a new land
[32:51] in a new newest newness of Journey
[32:53] amongst new people and the hand of God
[32:55] was upon them but it finally came to a
[32:57] place this this in this walk that they
[33:00] had that they was not satisfied with
[33:04] their walk of Grace they had to come to
[33:06] something that they could do themselves
[33:07] now that's where people think today of
[33:10] Divine Healing or some other work of
[33:11] grace of God that there's something you
[33:13] have to do you there's nothing that you
[33:16] have to do but believe just believe God
[33:19] and they if they would have continued on
[33:21] the promise wasn't given them under the
[33:24] law the promise was given before the law
[33:27] without any conditions to it I have
[33:30] given you this land go on over into it
[33:33] but before they got to that promise they
[33:36] decided there was something they must do
[33:39] themselves
[33:42] and that we still find that among human
[33:45] beings we're prone to be that way there
[33:48] is something we've got to do that's why
[33:51] people gravitate towards religions
[33:52] that's why people frustrated and
[33:55] reaching out to God I need to better my
[33:57] life I need to do something so they find
[33:58] a religion and that lays it all out you
[34:00] do this you don't do this you do this
[34:01] you dress this way you do this and it
[34:03] lays it all and that's a comfort to them
[34:04] says okay now if this is God that's what
[34:06] he asked me to do and I'm going to feel
[34:08] better if I just do the do's and don'ts
[34:11] it's not a walk of Grace
[34:15] because you're doing it to you're doing
[34:16] it to pay for your sins you're doing it
[34:18] to avoid hell
[34:20] and God's grace says you don't take care
[34:23] of avoiding hell yourself
[34:25] I went to the cross and I took of I took
[34:27] the place so you wouldn't have to go to
[34:29] hell
[34:31] it's either Grace or it's not Grace it's
[34:32] either all Grace can you say Amen
[34:35] or it's not
[34:36] and people jump to these religions let
[34:38] me finish the quote
[34:39] um we're prone to be that way there's
[34:41] something we've got to do we feel that
[34:43] that we've got to have something into it
[34:45] also you do have something into it
[34:49] um
[34:53] you do have something into it that's
[34:55] your surrender of your own will your own
[34:57] ideas to the will and idea of almighty
[34:59] God and it's finished that's all there
[35:01] is just take his promise don't think of
[35:03] nothing else walk by it and God does the
[35:05] rest of it then they wanted a law and
[35:07] God always gives you the desire of your
[35:09] heart he promised to but we find out
[35:11] when they turn one step from the side of
[35:13] what God originally promised then that
[35:15] was The Thorn In the Flesh until the law
[35:17] was taken away until Jesus Christ came
[35:19] as a craft was crucified to take away
[35:21] the law it was a thorn in their flesh
[35:23] and anything that you try to do within
[35:25] yourself it'll always work to your
[35:28] dishonor it'll work to your dis
[35:29] disadvantage just simply believe God and
[35:32] that settles it what God promised I'm
[35:34] the Lord thy God and heals all thy
[35:36] diseases see if there's any sick among
[35:37] you let them call for the elves of the
[35:39] church you see what brother bam says
[35:40] keep it simple
[35:42] don't complicate it
[35:44] don't make it works I got to do this I
[35:46] gotta do this just keep it Grace keep it
[35:48] simple the word says this I believe it
[35:50] I'm going to apply the word let him do
[35:52] the work
[35:53] keep it simple
[35:55] amen uh he says now why do we have to
[35:58] accept organizations before so forth
[36:01] that will right off that write that off
[36:03] the book see it becomes The Thorn In the
[36:05] Flesh and here at the end time we meet
[36:07] the thing again face to face it's up to
[36:09] the Methodist Baptists Presbyterians and
[36:11] what more you see you can't go on you've
[36:13] got to come to the entire Full Gospel it
[36:16] was made for the full Man by a complete
[36:19] God who was made flesh and dwelt among
[36:21] us and we know that those things are
[36:23] true now if we notice in their journey
[36:26] in the wilderness is where they got
[36:27] their greatest mistake that Israel ever
[36:30] made until Calvary was win in Exodus 19.
[36:33] they accepted law instead of Grace they
[36:36] had Grace and they had a prophet they
[36:39] had a sacrificial lamb they had
[36:42] Redemption they had been brought through
[36:44] the Red Sea they have been healed of
[36:46] their diseases they had water from the
[36:48] smitten Rock they had a Manna Out of
[36:51] Heaven everything they had need of had
[36:53] been supplied and still they wanted
[36:56] something else
[36:58] now when I read that I don't say that it
[37:00] was wrong for God to send the law it's
[37:02] that the people chose the law over over
[37:06] a walk of Grace
[37:07] God provided them God provided him a
[37:10] prophet a sacrificial lamb and he gave
[37:12] him a promise and all they need is I
[37:14] believe the promise I'm going to go take
[37:15] it by God's grace
[37:18] I've got a sacrificial lamb to bring for
[37:20] my bring for my sins can you say amen
[37:22] and God sent a prophet and guess what
[37:24] that's all they needed for relationship
[37:28] to go on to become Kings and Priests
[37:33] yeah you understand in the Old Testament
[37:35] we still needed Calvary for the soul but
[37:37] in that they chose law over Grace
[37:40] because we do that because we want to do
[37:41] something give me something to do
[37:45] and we do do things but we don't do it
[37:47] out of
[37:49] Duty
[37:51] it must
[37:53] come forth out of a relationship every
[37:57] day with this living being Christ
[38:04] it is the only way
[38:06] the law was of God but they chose living
[38:08] that instead of the grace relationship
[38:09] the early church now we moved to the
[38:11] early church we read today the early
[38:12] church began to fall to that themselves
[38:14] when they when we do this and we don't
[38:17] do this that's what came out we need to
[38:19] do this we need to not do that and they
[38:21] clung to that instead of relationship
[38:24] and Satan did that work he misdirected
[38:27] them he took things you need to do this
[38:29] you need to do that I'm going to read a
[38:30] scripture in a minute that's quite
[38:31] revealing about that in the early church
[38:34] so now they clung to do's and don'ts
[38:37] instead of the relationship but if you
[38:40] you stay in a close relationship of
[38:42] Grace he will produce the do's and
[38:45] don'ts by grace in you
[38:49] can I say that
[38:51] if you stay in close relationship in a
[38:55] walk of Grace he will produce the do's
[38:59] and don'ts and the signs Miracles and
[39:02] wonders
[39:04] by his grace in you living in the spirit
[39:07] the church world can't seem to get it
[39:09] right
[39:11] some message Pockets don't seem to get
[39:13] it right they dump out the church order
[39:15] you know the church world is dumped out
[39:17] Church order they dumped out modesty
[39:19] they dumped out any further Revelation
[39:21] there's not any further revelation of
[39:23] this Bible it's literally we look at it
[39:25] literally and as we found last Wednesday
[39:26] night with further rap if you look at
[39:28] the Book of Genesis or Revelations
[39:30] literally you're going to get yourself
[39:32] all messed up there's a spiritual
[39:34] symbolism there
[39:35] can you say Amen but the church says no
[39:37] we're not going there that's the
[39:38] revelation God doesn't give a personal
[39:40] revelation to somebody he doesn't he
[39:42] gave one to Peter
[39:43] where do you get that God doesn't bring
[39:45] a personal residence right from God
[39:47] straight to the person
[39:49] you're totally off the word God never
[39:51] gives something new and brings something
[39:53] to a prophet of this age oh yeah he does
[39:55] it's all in the Bible but he brings it
[39:57] back to the church again it's all laying
[39:58] there can you say Amen so the church
[40:00] dumps out Church order that's why they
[40:02] have all these meals and everything in
[40:04] the church and yelling across the church
[40:05] and parties in the church and uh
[40:08] and they dump out modesty that's not
[40:10] important anymore for the revelation we
[40:12] dump out that I just want my simple
[40:14] Jesus but I don't want all the other
[40:16] stuff that's not what we're doing
[40:18] we don't dump it out
[40:20] but we say let the Holy Ghost bring me
[40:23] into all of it if it's the word I want
[40:27] it but I want to do it out of the
[40:30] craving and love for God in my heart
[40:35] what's laying in that message Lord if
[40:38] it's the word I want it but I want to do
[40:41] it out of a craving and love for God's
[40:44] word
[40:46] is this okay with everybody
[40:50] so now you have that happen in the book
[40:51] of Acts
[40:52] I wonder if the same thing happened in
[40:54] the last days yes God brought all the
[40:57] word restored in the last days
[40:59] I was talking to a brother the other day
[41:00] and he's asking you know the whole
[41:02] history of the 60 years of this message
[41:03] since the word came to us restored to us
[41:05] again and you have to say may not be
[41:07] able to put this publicly I don't know
[41:08] but we have to be honest to say I wonder
[41:10] if the same cycle happened is that now
[41:12] we come into a relationship with God the
[41:15] holy spirit is poured out upon us in the
[41:17] last days right we come into
[41:18] relationship but then God brings Church
[41:21] order God brings things that talk about
[41:23] what a man should wear a woman should
[41:25] wear God brings all these other things
[41:27] which is all essential for us for the
[41:28] last days but people do the same thing
[41:31] they choose to jump onto those things
[41:35] and leave relationship in the dust
[41:40] could it be we've done the same thing
[41:43] with the message
[41:45] instead of it being as brother Brown
[41:47] called a message of Grace
[41:49] it becomes a message of disgrace
[41:54] and law
[41:56] and do's and don'ts until people become
[41:59] Bound by their quotes
[42:05] you didn't tell me God ever intended the
[42:07] quotes to bind us
[42:09] you think God does that no man does it
[42:12] preachers bind the people with quotes
[42:15] bind up the sisters with quotes God
[42:17] never intended for those quotes to bind
[42:19] up our sisters
[42:22] we believe the quotes
[42:24] and it's just I love that from
[42:27] the brother Sunday night talking to the
[42:29] young people and saying that
[42:31] Moses my servant is dead and he makes a
[42:34] personal connection with Joshua
[42:36] and says as I was in Moses I will be
[42:39] with you and it's a personal
[42:40] relationship with Joshua it wasn't going
[42:42] to be I'm just going to duplicate what
[42:44] Moses did that wasn't it God said I'll
[42:46] be with you like I was with Moses
[42:50] because God doesn't say I'm going to go
[42:51] through just I'm going to go through
[42:53] Moses still even though he's dead I'm
[42:55] going to keep using him and you're just
[42:57] supposed to no no no no God's about
[42:59] relationship I want a personal
[43:01] relationship with Joshua and those that
[43:03] are going in the Promised Land
[43:05] I want to tell you that every place your
[43:07] foot your foot not Moses foot every foot
[43:10] your foot shall go it'll be possession
[43:13] to you and you'll take the land somebody
[43:14] say praise the Lord
[43:17] amen look at this real quickly I noticed
[43:20] this today act the book of Acts verse
[43:22] 15. it just was just a maybe not even
[43:24] years and look what starts to happen in
[43:27] the book of Acts acts 15 verse 1.
[43:31] so now and I want to talk about the
[43:33] positive relationship in the book of
[43:35] Acts with God and with one another we're
[43:37] going to get to a lot of that but I just
[43:38] want to stop and look at this Antichrist
[43:40] spirit that enters the book of Acts
[43:42] right away through men and it says and
[43:44] certain men everybody remember that now
[43:46] certain men
[43:49] which came down from Judea taught the
[43:52] Brethren and said except you be
[43:54] circumcised after the manner of Moses
[43:56] you cannot be saved now they're coming
[43:58] to new Christians that had come to the
[44:00] message of the hour circumcision had had
[44:03] been lost because God was bringing the
[44:06] true circumcision of the soul of the
[44:08] Holy Ghost they didn't understand that
[44:10] they came from being Pharisees but they
[44:12] believed and came in to the message
[44:15] certain men it didn't come from Satan on
[44:18] a cloud somewhere it was through
[44:19] preachers that actually traveled down to
[44:22] these new converts and said you know
[44:23] what praise the Lord you came to God and
[44:26] you're feeling this uh great Revival and
[44:30] God's changed you but except you be
[44:32] circumcised after the matter of Moses
[44:34] you cannot be saved
[44:37] these are guys that come in to the
[44:39] message of the hour
[44:41] and they're bringing their past up
[44:44] and misleading these new converts
[44:48] when therefore Moses Paul and Barnabas
[44:50] had no small dissension in disputation
[44:52] with them they determined that Paul and
[44:54] Barnabas and certain other of them
[44:55] should go to Jerusalem under the
[44:57] apostles and Elders about this question
[44:58] and being brought on their way by the
[45:00] church they passed through uh fanis and
[45:02] Samaria declaring the conversion of the
[45:04] Gentiles and they caused Great Joy unto
[45:06] all the brethren and when they were come
[45:08] to Jerusalem they were received at the
[45:10] church and of the Apostles and Elders
[45:11] all the work Paul and Barnabas did was a
[45:13] great work of the Lord go into the
[45:14] Gentiles and they the church received
[45:17] them the church Elders received them
[45:18] they declared all things that God had
[45:20] done with them but there arose up
[45:22] certain of the sect of the Pharisees now
[45:26] I want you to notice this now
[45:28] certain of the sect of Pharisees which
[45:33] believed
[45:34] so already in the church you have those
[45:38] that don't have the Holy Ghost that
[45:40] carried over and it says they believed
[45:42] and that's why just believing from the
[45:44] intellect is not good enough
[45:46] believing from the heart is what you
[45:48] need and so these men come into the
[45:51] church and they were a sect of the
[45:52] Pharisees which was the religion they
[45:54] came from in the past if you come from
[45:56] Baptist you come from methodists you
[45:58] come from Catholic you come from many
[46:00] denominations and the systems of
[46:01] denominations when you come to the Lord
[46:03] you've got to be washed of all those
[46:06] former things can you say amen and say
[46:08] Lord what is your truth what is being
[46:09] what is being held back from me my
[46:12] brother and sister who may be listening
[46:14] here I don't say this to be mean but you
[46:16] better look at your life because those
[46:18] systems can hold you back like these and
[46:20] you hold on to old traditions that have
[46:23] been taught to you by a denomination and
[46:26] it may not be the truth
[46:29] and so these certain of the sect of the
[46:31] Pharisees which believed so they were
[46:33] amongst the crowd of the new message
[46:35] Believers saying that it was needful to
[46:38] circumcise them and to command them to
[46:39] keep the law of Moses and the apostles
[46:41] and Elders came together to consider
[46:42] this matter and when there had been much
[46:44] disputing Peter rose up and said unto
[46:47] them men and Brethren ye know how God
[46:49] that a good while ago God made Choice
[46:51] Among Us that the Gentiles by the mouth
[46:53] should hear the word of the gospel and
[46:54] believe and God which knoweth the hearts
[46:56] bear them witness giving them the Holy
[46:58] Ghost even as he did unto us Brothers
[47:00] You've got to admit without your help
[47:03] they received the same Holy Ghost the
[47:05] Gentiles did is what we got you know
[47:07] what he's saying
[47:09] that's the end of the story
[47:11] you don't complicate it anymore than
[47:13] that
[47:15] there's no dispute there's no arguing
[47:17] there's no putting circumcision on this
[47:19] because what's the proof they come into
[47:21] relationship without any of you
[47:28] I wonder if that's the way Peter said it
[47:29] that day probably not
[47:32] hey guys it's a settled argument they've
[47:35] got the same thing we've got
[47:37] and you didn't have to they didn't have
[47:39] to be circumcised to get it
[47:41] so what are you trying to teach these
[47:43] new converts
[47:48] and God which knows the hearts better
[47:49] than witness giving the Holy Ghost as he
[47:51] did unto us and put no difference
[47:52] between us and Them purifying their
[47:54] hearts by faith now therefore why tempt
[47:56] you God to put a yoke upon the neck of
[47:58] the disciples which neither our fathers
[47:59] nor we were able to Bear but we believe
[48:01] that through the grace of the through
[48:03] what
[48:07] through the grace of the Lord Jesus we
[48:10] shall be saved come into relationship
[48:13] then all the multitude kept silence and
[48:15] gave audience to barnos and Paul
[48:16] declaring that What miracles and wonders
[48:18] God had wrought among the Gentiles by
[48:19] them and after they held their peace
[48:21] James
[48:22] uh answered saying men and brother and
[48:24] hearken unto me and so Peter says it to
[48:26] him it wasn't Paul and bars Peter stood
[48:28] behind him uh uh uh James
[48:31] who's the Elder of the church there in
[48:33] Jerusalem he backed him up and says we
[48:35] are not going to put anything extra on
[48:38] these new converts because here listen
[48:40] if they need to come to anything they
[48:43] got the same holy ghost that we did and
[48:46] the same Holy Ghost will bring us into
[48:48] what we need
[48:50] by grace
[48:52] instead of you taking some old tradition
[48:55] and requirement
[48:59] how many knows that they did it to the
[49:01] Galatians the whole book of Galatians in
[49:03] your Bible is dedicated to men coming in
[49:06] and requiring circumcision of new
[49:09] Gentiles the Galatians they fell for it
[49:12] and Paul wrote in the Galatians says the
[49:13] brothers
[49:14] why are you listening to these men
[49:18] why are you being moved from the Liberty
[49:21] God has brought you into
[49:24] you know what he said who hath Bewitched
[49:28] you
[49:30] you Galatians who did it
[49:33] Pharisees men that came to the message
[49:36] from Pharisees but they didn't get a
[49:38] true birth so they're bringing all their
[49:39] stuff to these new converts
[49:41] and Paul said they've Bewitched you
[49:43] they've cast a spell on you
[49:46] Stand Fast in the Liberty that you once
[49:50] had
[49:53] and through Paul and through Paul's
[49:55] letters and through the word
[49:58] the Galatians finally come out and they
[50:01] probably saying I'm coming back to the
[50:05] Heart of Worship
[50:07] and it's all about you
[50:10] amen It's All About You Jesus that's
[50:15] probably what they were saying imagine I
[50:16] don't know
[50:18] we're coming back to where we started in
[50:21] the Liberty God gave us
[50:23] and we won't buy Bound by a yoke of
[50:25] bondage from other men that's injecting
[50:28] other things in the quotes
[50:32] I say this to ministers I guess I can
[50:34] say it to you that for so many years we
[50:36] heard several things that the prophet
[50:38] had said in certain quotes
[50:41] and then many of those things and it was
[50:42] preached you better do it you better do
[50:44] it
[50:45] you know don't wear a mustache
[50:48] because anybody who's wearing a mustache
[50:50] is hiding something
[50:52] That was supposed to be a quote and
[50:53] guess what none of us can find it
[50:55] it's not there
[50:57] so not only do we have to deal with
[50:59] preaching to the people the things and
[51:01] giving value of what the prophet said
[51:02] now we got additions and a lot of it
[51:04] came from old Pentecostal Holiness
[51:07] standards
[51:08] you know you have long sleeves and I got
[51:11] them tonight so I'm I'm holy but anyway
[51:12] you have lost these you don't wear a
[51:14] short sleeve shirt you don't wear a
[51:15] wedding ring all these things come from
[51:17] the Holiness that were add-ons I'm not
[51:20] interested in those things I'm
[51:20] interested what the prophet said
[51:23] but you get these quotes as they stick
[51:24] with quotes they'll go well let me look
[51:26] it up and there's probably 10 15 20
[51:28] things that he didn't say it
[51:31] so now people under bondage for years
[51:33] under under something the prophet didn't
[51:34] even say
[51:37] it's a reality and it's been bringing
[51:39] their old Pharisee system ideas with
[51:43] them into that's why we could have very
[51:47] Baptists atmospheres within our ranks
[51:51] because they don't believe in the moving
[51:52] of the spirit
[51:53] some of them
[51:56] they don't believe in letting the spirit
[51:57] do have its way and then we can have
[52:00] very Pentecostal Slants come in the
[52:02] message as well
[52:05] that go overboard sometimes
[52:08] because they're bringing all of that and
[52:10] listen you don't you don't have to bring
[52:12] any of that in with you
[52:15] let God do it his own way get in the
[52:20] spirit get free in the spirit let the
[52:22] Revelation come stimulation of
[52:25] Revelation you don't have to work it up
[52:26] you don't have to have a pep rally to
[52:28] work the people into motion preach the
[52:30] word preach the Revelation and the
[52:32] stimulation of revelation will make some
[52:35] people cry and weep make some people
[52:36] shout the aisles we actually will shout
[52:38] and scream can you say Amen some of them
[52:40] just sit and and stand in awe but it's
[52:42] the holy spirit let the Holy Spirit do
[52:44] it the way he wants to do it
[52:47] amen praise the Lord I don't know what
[52:50] time it is because the clock's not
[52:51] working back there
[52:53] so I guess I just keep going
[52:55] praise the Lord but that's quite a
[52:57] scripture hold on to that acts 15 and
[52:59] look at that in Acts 15 already
[53:02] in relationship with they'd come to in
[53:04] the upper room in Acts 15 already
[53:06] there's men that's trying to influence
[53:08] to take him from the liberty and the
[53:10] relationship that we're in to add on
[53:12] these things to where a person would say
[53:14] oh I've got to do that so they maybe
[53:16] some of them they go and be circumcised
[53:18] and they realize later you didn't need
[53:20] to go do that
[53:21] the word doesn't say to do that now
[53:23] you've already been circumcised by the
[53:26] Holy Ghost
[53:27] you see
[53:28] be careful we don't put our hands and
[53:30] add to this thing
[53:32] certain men early on they got it wrong
[53:34] the influence the new people the message
[53:37] a certain sect of Pharisees which
[53:39] believed can you say man they believed
[53:42] look at the Simplicity of the early
[53:45] church though and what they were doing
[53:46] and it says they continued steadfast
[53:49] consistent
[53:51] in fellowship and in the apostles
[53:54] doctrines and teachings
[53:57] so now we're just moving into what did
[53:59] this look like
[54:00] you know what they're saying if it says
[54:02] they continued steadfast how many want
[54:05] to be like the book of Acts Church
[54:07] they were in such a relationship that
[54:09] this is one of the first things it
[54:11] mentions that they continued consistent
[54:13] and steadfast all the time staying
[54:16] around the presence of the Lord staying
[54:19] around the fellowship staying around the
[54:21] doctrines of the Apostles basically they
[54:23] were just saying I just want to be Lord
[54:26] I just want to be where you are
[54:30] this is simplicity
[54:32] their relationship was just simple to
[54:34] say
[54:35] I don't know what all I need to do yet
[54:37] but I just want to be where the Lord is
[54:42] I'm in such a relationship with him that
[54:44] if I gather in that house if they invite
[54:47] me over I'm going to go over and I'm
[54:50] going to choose that many times over
[54:51] what else I have to do because I just
[54:54] want to be in this Fellowship I want to
[54:57] be where he is and then without churches
[54:59] I want to be there there was none of
[55:01] this church registration and church you
[55:03] know I'll give you so much if you come
[55:05] 10 times a year what a ridiculous you
[55:07] never have to do that with people that
[55:09] are hungry for God and in relationship
[55:10] with God you never have to force people
[55:13] to come to church
[55:14] it it's it works from a hunger just say
[55:17] well I'm so tired my children don't come
[55:19] to church and some of my families they
[55:20] don't come to church well I as a pastor
[55:22] get weary of that too but you see now
[55:24] you what you need to pray for don't get
[55:25] mad pray for their hunger to increase
[55:27] for God because if their hunger
[55:29] increases you don't have to tell them to
[55:31] come to church
[55:33] you don't have to tell them to listen
[55:35] online I always have to mention that
[55:36] because many of the people can't make it
[55:38] this far for Wednesday night but they're
[55:40] listening in why are they listening in
[55:41] consistently consistently staying close
[55:44] to the apostles doctrine of those why
[55:46] are they doing it consistently because
[55:47] they want to be where he is they want to
[55:50] be where he is Lord I'm in a
[55:52] relationship I want to be where you are
[55:56] and if you don't think we have today the
[55:58] same thing the prophet said that people
[56:00] are staying home now watching I Love
[56:02] Lucy on Wednesday night while prayer
[56:04] meeting is going on if you don't think
[56:05] that's happening now you're crazy it's
[56:07] happening probably even in our own
[56:09] assembly that they're watching other
[56:10] shows and doing other entertainments on
[56:13] Wednesday night where the church is
[56:14] going on it's it's where we live can you
[56:17] say Amen it's it's the culture we live
[56:19] in pray that God increases the hunger

[56:24] famine in the land you ought to pray say
[56:26] God increase my Hunger to be in
[56:27] relationship with increase my Hunger for
[56:29] More Of You show me I want to be
[56:31] wherever you are Lord I don't want to
[56:33] ever get distance come on wake up
[56:35] friends Putin just this afternoon Putin
[56:37] is making a threat to the United States
[56:39] how many heard it Biden said something
[56:41] to to ruffle him up and he says listen
[56:43] he put a warning out to the United
[56:44] States this is going this direction if
[56:46] you keep saying this you doing this he
[56:48] said this is a warning this is I'm going
[56:50] to open up this nuclear thing you don't
[56:52] think we're headed in that direction
[56:54] read what he said today read what what
[56:56] Putin said today
[56:58] and I just seen it just before church
[56:59] and I say praise the Lord I'm going to
[57:01] go worship God I'm ready to go let the
[57:04] bombs fall let the bombs fall
[57:09] I know that's where it's going and it
[57:10] may be coming sooner than you all think
[57:13] maybe come a lot sooner than you think
[57:16] it's prophesied to come
[57:19] amen it's not going to be held up for
[57:21] that much longer yeah he put out a
[57:24] warning to us this country the West he
[57:27] called it a warning to the West
[57:29] this is the direction is going if things
[57:31] don't change for him
[57:33] because Biden said today he said that he
[57:36] shamelessly has done these things that
[57:39] are off the U.N Council on how you're
[57:41] supposed to do war and he disrebuked him
[57:43] for it and Putin responded with a threat
[57:46] to the West
[57:48] praise the Lord
[57:51] they wanted to be what time is it they
[57:54] wanted to be wherever he was and
[57:57] consistently be there
[57:59] that's the relationship of the New
[58:01] Testament Church
[58:02] that's
[58:04] that's relationship of the redeemed
[58:09] they wanted to be at the Lord's supper
[58:11] and breaking bread together they wanted
[58:13] to be in prayers it says they wanted to
[58:15] be together in Fellowship they wanted to
[58:18] be identified together I want to
[58:20] identify with that people this is what
[58:22] this is relationship
[58:23] is a relationship you don't want to be
[58:25] identified with them no relationship
[58:27] from the Holy Ghost is I want to be
[58:28] identified with him and guess what there
[58:30] was no big eyes or little used or rich
[58:32] people or poor people you didn't base it
[58:34] on that I want to be with them I don't
[58:36] care if they have a million dollars I
[58:37] don't have any dollars
[58:38] if they're Holy Ghost people I want to
[58:40] be around them
[58:43] see what if you don't like their
[58:44] personality it has nothing to do with it
[58:47] [Music]
[58:48] it's hard on some people I think because
[58:50] there's some personalities you just
[58:51] don't like to be around and you might as
[58:53] well just admit I don't won't ask you to
[58:55] raise your hand
[58:56] I'll raise mine but there's some that
[58:58] get at you
[59:00] might even be your mother-in-law or your
[59:02] father-in-law I don't know
[59:05] and praise the Lord
[59:07] so and then together they had all things
[59:10] common they were all common were the
[59:12] same there's no great ones the system of
[59:15] the world of positions great and little
[59:17] and for God to present an agape love
[59:20] coming in the people and that's what
[59:21] they were living out Agape a selfless a
[59:24] Selfless Love
[59:26] was so contrary to the culture in the
[59:28] book of Acts days because the Greek
[59:30] culture was it actually mocked that kind
[59:33] of unselfish love they mocked it and God
[59:36] comes down by the Holy Ghost and brings
[59:38] such an unselfish love you got people
[59:39] selling their goods to meet the needs in
[59:42] the church
[59:43] something happened to him
[59:45] it was completely against culture you
[59:47] don't sell you don't do that who cares
[59:49] you they should make their own living
[59:51] all that's washed away
[59:54] and they cared about someone else can
[59:55] you say Amen
[59:56] they cared about someone else
[59:59] and John McArthur says the greatest
[1:00:02] virtue of the Christian Life Is Love the
[1:00:05] use of agape love was rare in Pagan
[1:00:08] Greek literature doubtless because the
[1:00:10] concept represented unselfish
[1:00:12] self-giving
[1:00:13] willful devotion was so uncommon in that
[1:00:16] culture it was even ridiculed and
[1:00:18] despised as a sign of weakness but in
[1:00:21] the New Testament it is proclaimed as
[1:00:24] the Supreme virtue The Virtue agape love
[1:00:27] the Supreme virtue The Virtue under
[1:00:29] which all others assumed Agape loved
[1:00:32] Sinners on the needs and the welfare of
[1:00:35] the one loved and will pay whatever
[1:00:37] personal price is necessary to meet
[1:00:40] those needs and Foster the welfare of
[1:00:43] that other person
[1:00:44] and it began to work because of
[1:00:47] relationship with God something began to
[1:00:50] work something Satan can never have
[1:00:52] something Satan can never understand
[1:00:55] Divine Agape Selfless Love for the body
[1:01:00] of Christ
[1:01:01] giving up our lives to God completely
[1:01:04] giving a full surrender in him he never
[1:01:06] forced me to do it I gave it up I gave
[1:01:09] everything to him and then a Selfless
[1:01:11] Love to one another that I'm not going
[1:01:13] to judge that person based upon what
[1:01:15] they wear or their degrees
[1:01:18] or if they treated me bad
[1:01:21] I will not judge them and hold a grudge
[1:01:24] because they treated me wrong and spit
[1:01:26] at me put me down
[1:01:30] Paul
[1:01:33] without the Holy Ghost
[1:01:37] persecuted the true church
[1:01:44] that's what he did
[1:01:46] so what is it when persons persecuting
[1:01:48] those among themselves and putting them
[1:01:50] down
[1:01:51] there ain't no Holy Ghost there yet
[1:01:54] but with the Holy Ghost he became a
[1:01:56] servant to the body of Christ
[1:01:59] and express the love of God he didn't he
[1:02:02] didn't have to go to preach to the
[1:02:03] generals he had to go to the whole world
[1:02:04] he didn't travel on those ships and be
[1:02:07] you know storms and
[1:02:09] washed ashore and he didn't have to do
[1:02:12] all that what was it agape love
[1:02:14] a selfless life
[1:02:17] if you want a marriage it's a selfless
[1:02:20] selfless marriage
[1:02:23] it's not about yourself it's how can I
[1:02:25] meet the needs of that other person can
[1:02:27] you say Amen
[1:02:28] this is about
[1:02:31] relationship
[1:02:35] when a couple fall in love and it's
[1:02:38] genuine love not lust
[1:02:40] because lust has a thing they want to be
[1:02:42] together too all the time but they want
[1:02:44] to be together for the wrong reasons
[1:02:47] they want to be sneaky and secret and
[1:02:49] they want to be together but they want
[1:02:51] to be together for the wrong reasons but
[1:02:53] genuine pure love for one another wants
[1:02:55] to be together that person I went
[1:02:57] through that with my wife I wanted to be
[1:03:00] with her that's why my phone bill was
[1:03:01] 900 when I got back home we didn't have
[1:03:04] cell phones
[1:03:05] am I that old
[1:03:08] when I got home from my honeymoon I they
[1:03:10] were they shut my phone off as 900.
[1:03:12] because why she lived in Tennessee and I
[1:03:15] just wanted to talk and be on the phone
[1:03:16] sometimes we were talking I just heard
[1:03:17] her breathing
[1:03:19] I was good enough for me
[1:03:23] and we have an example in a young love
[1:03:25] all of you married couples have
[1:03:26] experienced that young love that you
[1:03:28] know what it's it's a relationship and
[1:03:30] the relationships I just want to be
[1:03:33] around them
[1:03:34] I'll travel to Tennessee I'll travel to
[1:03:37] Florida wherever they're at and if you
[1:03:39] don't have to travel you'll be over
[1:03:40] their house every night you always want
[1:03:42] to be with them and if that on that
[1:03:45] level of marriage and Young Love if that
[1:03:47] relationship is about I want to be
[1:03:49] around this person shouldn't that be the
[1:03:52] core of the Christian walk is I I don't
[1:03:55] understand all the Mysteries
[1:03:58] but I I'm in a relationship and I want
[1:04:00] to stay close to my Lord

[1:04:20] I don't want to worship from afar draw
[1:04:23] me near to where you are can you
[1:04:27] understand friends this message is about
[1:04:30] relationship
[1:04:32] so much so that the last paragraph in
[1:04:34] the church age book brother Branham says
[1:04:37] not for one moment do I bring a message
[1:04:39] to start an organization or to start
[1:04:42] another denomination or build something
[1:04:44] around me I'm paraphrasing but that's
[1:04:46] that's just of it he said but I come to
[1:04:49] accomplish one thing to establish a
[1:04:52] relationship between the people and
[1:04:54] Jesus Christ
[1:04:55] this message are you listening
[1:04:58] don't ever forget this message come from
