[6:04] praise your holy
[6:06] name so worthy you are Lord Lord we you
[6:13] up Lord we live you yes Lord we lift you
[6:25] up 1 Corinthians chapter
[6:28] 5 it is reported commonly that there is
[6:31] fornication among you and such
[6:34] fornication as is not so much as named
[6:37] among the Gentiles that one should have
[6:40] his father's wife and ye are puffed up
[6:43] and have not rather mourned that he that
[6:46] hath done this deed might be taken away
[6:49] from among you so I want you to notice
[6:52] here the rebuke is not only to the ones
[6:54] who are committing fornication but it's
[6:56] also to the church and not dealing with
[6:58] it corre correctly so the rebuke is for
[7:01] both it says in verse three then for I
[7:04] verely as absent in the body but present
[7:06] in the spirit have judged already as
[7:08] though I were present concerning him
[7:10] that hath so done this deed in the name
[7:13] of our Lord Jesus Christ when ye are
[7:15] gathered together in my spirit with the
[7:17] power of our Lord Jesus Christ to
[7:20] deliver such a one unto Satan for the
[7:23] destruction of the flesh that the spirit
[7:26] might be saved in the day of the Lord
[7:29] Jesus Jesus it would certainly take a
[7:31] lot of maturity in prayer to handle a
[7:34] situation this way your glorying is not
[7:37] good now he's speaking to the Corinthian
[7:39] Believers your glorying is not good know
[7:42] ye not that A little leaven leaveneth
[7:44] the whole lump Purge out therefore the
[7:47] old leaven that ye may be a new lump as
[7:51] ye are unleavened for even Christ Our
[7:54] Passover is sacrific for us so there he
[7:58] refers ref to Christ fulfilling the
[8:01] Feast of the Passover he is the Passover
[8:04] Lamb and so he refers to that Feast but
[8:06] look what he says here verse eight
[8:08] therefore let us keep the feast let us
[8:11] keep this Feast not with old leaven
[8:14] neither with the Leen of malice and
[8:17] wickedness but with the unleavened bread
[8:20] of
[8:21] sincerity and truth so we have here Paul
[8:25] addressing a situation in the
[8:27] Corinthians Church of incest and he
[8:31] calls it fornication but it was actually
[8:33] incest and that's the same thing it's a
[8:35] sexual immoral thing going on amongst
[8:37] the congregation and so he comes and he
[8:40] deals with it in his rebuke to the
[8:43] church he deals with a different way
[8:44] because he brings in this Passover uh
[8:47] Feast that took place and he refers to
[8:50] that and then he says that we should
[8:52] keep this Feast we should keep this
[8:54] Feast so that lets us know what uh what
[8:57] I was trying to bring to you a few weeks
[8:59] ago that the the seven feasts that if he
[9:02] says we should keep this Feast so if we
[9:04] think all of these feasts are dropped
[9:07] off after the Old Testament because they
[9:09] were in the Old Testament then we're
[9:10] missing something because they G we
[9:13] don't drop them off but we know that
[9:15] they have a spiritual fulfillment in our
[9:17] lives and Jesus said it this way I come
[9:20] not to destroy the law but I come to
[9:23] fulfill the law so whatever is out there
[9:26] in the Old Testament we can't as the
[9:28] modern church just dump all that off it
[9:31] has a meeting it has a purpose and it
[9:33] translates into our spiritual walk that
[9:36] we apply these things and the Seven
[9:38] feasts are no exception there's
[9:40] something spiritual that Christ fulfills
[9:43] all those things and he's fulfilling a
[9:45] lot of those things in us so when Paul
[9:47] says we should keep the feast maybe some
[9:50] of the new Christians were saying but I
[9:51] thought we were done with that I thought
[9:52] we moved on past Calvary now we don't
[9:55] celebrate not we don't physically C
[9:57] celebrate those days but but spiritually
[9:59] they're still in place and he says we
[10:02] should keep the Feast of Passover so
[10:05] spiritually something happens at us if
[10:07] you study the Feast of Passover started
[10:09] the night in in Goan where God the death
[10:12] angel was going to come and he said
[10:14] apply the blood to the kill the lamb and
[10:18] uh dress the lamb and it's a feast of
[10:20] unleavened bread so have have bread but
[10:23] no leaven in it CU leaven means sin so
[10:25] they're doing all this stuff in the
[10:27] household and then they apply the blood
[10:29] to the door and the L the death angel
[10:32] passed over their house because they had
[10:35] the blood and they had purged Leen from
[10:37] the bread and done all things all the
[10:38] things they need to do so when you say
[10:41] keep the feast well that has a meaning
[10:42] for us because we have not only a lamb
[10:45] that has been slain for us we not only
[10:48] have applied the blood to our lives but
[10:51] Paul says part of this Passover feast is
[10:54] to purge the leaven from the lump right
[10:59] yeah he's actually dealing with an issue
[11:01] that was in the church so he's telling
[11:03] them I'm rebuking you as a church that
[11:05] you cannot A little leaven will leaven
[11:08] the whole lump it's going to eventually
[11:10] affect somebody else so grow up and be a
[11:12] mature a mature Church grow up and and
[11:15] try your best to look to the word of God
[11:18] and not ignore what's going on but to
[11:20] address it to look at it because if you
[11:22] don't Purge it how many know the holy
[11:25] spirit is also a purging nature to it it
[11:28] wants to purge something that's not
[11:30] right and so if that continues in our
[11:33] Christian walk then we find under the
[11:35] Passover feast that we believe in our
[11:37] lives this Passover this lamb that we
[11:40] celebrate is one thing the next thing is
[11:42] we realize we must say Lord Purge the
[11:46] leavon out of this bread am I'm if I'm
[11:49] to celebrate this I can't just celebrate
[11:51] the sacrificial lamb at Calvary but I've
[11:54] got to purge the leaven out of the bread
[11:56] I've got to eat this bread with the
[11:58] unleavened bread of sincerity and truth
[12:01] and that's the that's the two words I
[12:02] want to get to in just a minute but uh
[12:04] uh sufficient to say that these feast
[12:07] and Paul's saying let's keep this Feast
[12:09] there's a spiritual keeping of these
[12:10] things it's very interesting to say uh
[12:13] that we're under this Feast of
[12:15] unleavened bread it's interesting that
[12:17] he words it that's the bread of
[12:19] sincerity and Truth now these two words
[12:23] together sincerity and Truth together
[12:26] are only together in one other place in
[12:29] the Bible and that's the Book of
[12:32] Joshua sincerity and Truth are not
[12:35] mentioned anywhere else except here in
[12:37] Corinthians and back in Joshua and by
[12:40] the way at the end of the Joshua
[12:42] commission at the end of his life it's
[12:45] some of the last things that he says to
[12:48] the children of Israel after all their
[12:50] history coming out of Egypt all the
[12:51] Miracles all the signs all the Wonders
[12:54] and here he they come through all the
[12:56] history of it and then they come into
[12:57] the promised land they're taking their
[12:59] land they're taking the countries to do
[13:00] and all this after all the history of
[13:03] being in the message and all the things
[13:05] that they've been through let's go to
[13:07] Joshua if you would chapter 24 and let's
[13:10] read it because it's because it's the
[13:12] only other place in the Bible it has to
[13:14] have significance that these two words
[13:17] sincerity and Truth are mentioned
[13:20] together must be pretty important and
[13:22] the time frame must be pretty important
[13:25] as well Joshua chapter
[13:27] 24 if you read the whole chapter 24 you
[13:30] read Joshua telling the people their
[13:32] history God through speaking through
[13:34] Joshua and saying I took you out of
[13:36] Egypt he gives the whole history again
[13:38] pick it up in verse eight said and I
[13:39] brought you into the land of the
[13:40] amorites which dwelt on the other side
[13:43] of Jordan and they fought with you and I
[13:45] gave them into your hand that ye might
[13:47] possess their land I destroyed them
[13:49] before you then Balo the son of zapor
[13:52] the king of Moab arose and wared against
[13:54] Israel and sent and called The Prophet
[13:57] balum the son of bore to to curse you
[13:59] but I would not hearken unto balum
[14:01] therefore he blessed you still so I
[14:03] deliver you out of his hand the the the
[14:06] history is here is that every incident
[14:09] balum uh the false prophet come among
[14:11] among you daythan and Kora uh the Red
[14:14] Sea everything everything in their
[14:16] history that they came through God said
[14:18] I delivered you out of all those things
[14:20] you're still standing because I was
[14:22] there and delivered you out of all of
[14:25] it and then he says verse and he went
[14:27] and ye went over over Jordan and CA here
[14:30] comes the Joshua Commission Now ye went
[14:32] over Jordan and came unto Jericho and
[14:34] the men of Jericho fought against you
[14:35] the amorites the perizzites the
[14:38] Canaanites the Hittites and the
[14:40] girgashites and the hivites and the
[14:42] jebusites and I deliver them into your
[14:45] hand and I sent the Hornet before you
[14:48] which drave them out before you even the
[14:50] two kings of the amorites but not with
[14:52] thy sword nor with thy bow and I have
[14:55] given you a land for which you did not
[14:57] labor and cities which you built not and
[15:00] ye dwell in them of The Vineyards and
[15:02] the olive yards which ye planted not do
[15:05] ye eat he's saying I've brought you into
[15:08] your promise you're dwelling in it and
[15:11] we as the bride can say he's brought us
[15:13] into our Promised Land of the Holy Ghost
[15:16] when he to stood at the seals he said he
[15:18] said Joshua I've seen you two-thirds of
[15:20] the way to Jordan and when the seals
[15:22] were getting ready to be broke it's
[15:24] bringing the people into their
[15:26] inheritance can you say Amen the bride
[15:28] can say he has brought me this far and
[15:31] now we're living in these cities and
[15:32] we're living in this word and we're
[15:35] blessed but it seems like every time God
[15:38] blesses the people it always comes with
[15:41] a
[15:42] warning because we can take it for
[15:44] granted after all this he says I've done
[15:47] for you look look verse 14 now therefore
[15:50] now therefore now what do we do now
[15:53] what's the end of all this we're at the
[15:54] end Joshua's getting ready to go pass
[15:56] away it's the end of the Joshua
[15:58] commission it's the end time after all
[16:01] the history of Israel coming into their
[16:03] land now therefore what fear the
[16:07] lord serve him in sincerity and
[16:13] truth and put away the gods which your
[16:16] fathers served on the other side of the
[16:18] flood and in Egypt and serve ye the Lord
[16:22] that's our instructions now that's what
[16:25] he says yes serve him with all your
[16:28] heart but serve him with
[16:31] sincerity and Truth do you know what
[16:33] that is well the opposite would be
[16:36] insincerity being deceiving being fake
[16:39] being pretend having pretense as I said
[16:42] Sunday your lips honor be but you're far
[16:45] your heart is far from
[16:47] me sincerity take the opposite then
[16:49] you'll understand what God's saying and
[16:51] truth instead of living on lies you live
[16:55] every day in the truth you're only
[16:58] interested in one thing that's truth
[17:01] your kids come and tell you something
[17:03] don't just jump on it wait until you
[17:04] find the truth and I'll tell you
[17:07] sometimes it takes years before truth is
[17:09] manifested a person can tell a lie and
[17:11] it sounds exactly right and be careful
[17:14] believe it into it because you don't
[17:15] know sometimes it takes a while to
[17:17] manifest but we should be lovers of
[17:20] Truth can you say Amen lovers of Truth
[17:22] lovers of sincerity lovers of being real
[17:25] lovers of being real Christians wanting
[17:28] to dwell amongst people that are being
[17:29] real cuz the whole world's lying and
[17:31] deceiving and all that that shouldn't be
[17:32] in the church we should serve him in
[17:34] truth and honesty and serve him with a
[17:37] with an honesty not a deception not
[17:39] trying to give the people and and and
[17:42] and and cry crocodile tears that's
[17:44] another meaning for insincerity crying
[17:46] crocodile tears we don't believe them
[17:47] because it's not real we should be the
[17:49] most real people on the face of the
[17:51] Earth and saying Lord let me serve you
[17:53] one way with sincerity and
[17:57] Truth it's the essential elements at the
[18:00] end Joshua says they say what do we do
[18:02] now we've got the land we're rejoicing
[18:04] serve him with all your heart with
[18:06] sincerity and Truth Joshua reminds them
[18:09] of their whole history and then he says
[18:11] serve him in sincerity and Truth the
[18:13] last thing this is what we need in the
[18:15] last days this is what we need to live
[18:18] this is what we need to display if we
[18:21] have Lies We Must dispel all the lies if
[18:24] we have insincerity and deception with
[18:25] one another we must Purge that from us
[18:28] and we must be a real people of
[18:31] honesty and so his last words to the
[18:34] people before he died is to serve the
[18:36] Lord with sincerity and truth I tell you
[18:38] friends I want to say to you tonight
[18:40] this is what I'm looking for this is
[18:42] what I title this service tonight this
[18:44] little bible study looking for sincerity
[18:47] and Truth what are you looking for
[18:49] brother Paul what are you looking for
[18:51] what's next I'm looking for sincerity
[18:53] and
[18:54] Truth in the people of God Amen I'm
[18:57] looking for more sincerity and Truth in
[19:00] the people of God this is what I look
[19:03] for in my own life and in the bride this
[19:06] is not just a sermon tonight but I'm Gro
[19:08] groaning to see this I'm groaning for
[19:11] true and real Christian
[19:15] fellowship with honesty with
[19:19] sincerity not grownup games not childish
[19:23] games because there is both there's
[19:24] childish games and then there's new
[19:26] grown-up games that people play and
[19:28] politics and deceiving and saying what
[19:31] you don't mean uh but I want honesty and
[19:33] sincerity and to be amongst the people
[19:36] of
[19:37] Truth people who tell the truth brothers
[19:41] who call themselves brothers that will
[19:43] act like true Christian
[19:45] Brothers they communicate like brothers
[19:48] not like the world not like the wisdom
[19:50] of the world but they actually
[19:51] communicate in honesty like brothers in
[19:54] Christ that's a real brother when he
[19:55] acts that way not with pretense not
[19:57] hiding not fakeness not lying not lips
[20:01] that speak and support and compliments
[20:03] but their heart is far from it Lord let
[20:06] me be first tonight let me have a
[20:08] fullness of sincerity and truthfulness
[20:11] before your presence that's right it
[20:15] also says to put away the gods and this
[20:18] is in tune with First Corinthians 5 that
[20:22] we read when it says Purge out the
[20:26] leaven Joshua said says you you you must
[20:30] put away other
[20:33] gods what is that saying
[20:35] purging Purge your lives if he's saying
[20:39] that I don't know if they still had uh
[20:41] hints towards God's there but we can't
[20:43] serve God any other way but in sincerity
[20:45] and truth and put away the gods which
[20:47] your fathers served that were on the
[20:49] other side that's way he says it so
[20:50] there's a purging a lot of times people
[20:53] thinks that stops at the end the purging
[20:55] of Our Lives stops at the end it's it's
[20:58] actually a part of the end it's a it's a
[21:00] part of our lives at the end it's in
[21:03] this uh perverted world there's still a
[21:06] purging that goes on in our lives I I
[21:09] thank God when he purges my life I thank
[21:12] God when he cleanses my life I thank God
[21:15] when he washes me of something that's
[21:18] hidden there in my life I thank God I
[21:21] don't I don't get offended when he's
[21:23] correcting me can you say Amen when he's
[21:25] trying to purge the church and Purge of
[21:28] something I don't get offended at that
[21:31] that's right because I want to be washed
[21:33] without any spot or wrinkle can you say
[21:36] amen hallelujah and so it's actually
[21:39] part of it as we purge the purging is a
[21:41] part of the work of the Holy Spirit at
[21:43] the end time the challenge then he says
[21:46] to them which I feel like through the
[21:49] ministry is the challenge that's been
[21:50] coming lately choose you this day whom
[21:54] you would serve I'm in verse 15 now if
[21:56] it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord
[21:58] can you imagine that if it if it seems
[22:01] evil for you to serve the Lord in your
[22:04] heart if it seems evil to serve the Lord
[22:08] then
[22:12] choose
[22:14] choose don't be in between choose who
[22:17] you want to
[22:18] serve choose you this day whom you will
[22:21] serve whether the gods which your father
[22:23] served that were on the other side of
[22:25] the flood and the gods of the amorites
[22:26] in whose land you dwell
[22:28] and I love it how he makes it so clear
[22:31] he said as for me in my house we will
[22:34] serve the Lord Joshua said make your
[22:37] choice but I want you to let you know my
[22:39] choice as for me in my house as for me
[22:42] in this house we're going to serve the
[22:44] Lord he's challenging them even if to
[22:47] shake their hand and say hey God bless
[22:49] you whatever Direction that's What
[22:51] Abraham did to lot as his wife looked at
[22:53] the Fashions down in Sodom and they set
[22:56] their tent they didn't go to Sodom right
[22:57] away way they pitched their tent toward
[23:01] Sodom and Abraham just said God told me
[23:04] there needs to be a separation you
[23:06] choose a way and I'll choose the other
[23:09] way shook hands with his his nephew God
[23:12] bless you and I'll be praying for you
[23:15] amen you don't need to get in a fuss
[23:17] about it you don't need to influence one
[23:19] another choose who you want to serve
[23:22] choose you this day and he said to all
[23:24] of Israel Purge from the leaven Purge
[23:27] the Gods right now but you need to
[23:29] choose you this day who you will
[23:34] serve Hallelujah things the bread so and
[23:38] so when we talk about bread now uh when
[23:40] they broke bread together and often we
[23:43] talk about this at the Lord's Supper uh
[23:45] the term breaking of bread came from it
[23:48] it didn't mean that they just got
[23:49] together and they tore the bread and
[23:51] they ate it together it had a much
[23:53] deeper meaning when they broke bread
[23:55] together it meant that they come
[23:57] together together to be nourished by the
[24:00] bread of life that he has sent us
[24:02] they're eating the bread of life
[24:05] together they're breaking bread together
[24:07] like we're doing tonight breaking bread
[24:10] together eating together the bread of
[24:12] life and breaking bread also means a
[24:16] love
[24:19] Feast it's about the sweet brotherly
[24:23] Fellowship that goes on around eating of
[24:27] Christ the word in this
[24:30] hour and it can't stay sweet fellowship
[24:33] if there's leav in the lump amen it's
[24:38] why a purging has to go on a continued
[24:40] purging has to go on and so it's a it's
[24:44] the love Feast goes with it sweet
[24:46] Fellowship around eating Christ the word
[24:48] of the hour and our communion when we
[24:51] have it projects that breaking of the
[24:53] bread that it should happen all the time
[24:55] in our life always in remembrance of the
[24:58] Lamb this Passover that's what communion
[25:01] light is about is remembering what our
[25:02] lamb did for us remember that judgment
[25:05] passed over us because of the Lamb so
[25:08] now then in chapter five
[25:11] before uh Paul speaks of the Gathering
[25:15] and speaks of the feast that we're at
[25:17] now as he brings in verse 11 he talks
[25:20] about let us keep this Feast of the
[25:22] Passover let's keep this Feast but it it
[25:25] also shows how we eat this bread bre
[25:28] Christ is the unleavened bread which
[25:30] means there's no world mixed in it with
[25:32] it leaven is the world there's no world
[25:35] mixed in with it it's pure we must keep
[25:38] it that way the elements that are in it
[25:41] must also be in us and those elements he
[25:43] brought out our sincerity and truth it
[25:46] must be kept pure so that you can stay
[25:49] in a state of serving him of sincerity
[25:52] and of Truth amen whenever leban comes
[25:54] in the world comes in we tend to lose
[25:57] our sincerity it and we tend to buy into
[26:02] lies so to eat right we must keep the
[26:04] leaven out keep the insincerity out the
[26:07] lack of being real the lack of being
[26:09] honest losing depths of the meaning of
[26:12] the word of God we must keep living out
[26:15] truth instead of lies and so this this
[26:18] case what Paul addressed was an incest
[26:20] case going on in the Corinthian Church
[26:22] in other words it was a moral failure
[26:25] but it was deceit it was being sneak it
[26:28] was going around the Saints and hiding
[26:30] something and because he said at the
[26:32] beginning it is reported commonly among
[26:35] you the word started to get out of this
[26:38] incest going on and they're still coming
[26:40] to church they're still having the
[26:42] Lord's supper and so now but what was
[26:45] the incest it's moral failure but it was
[26:49] dishonesty it was insincerity it was
[26:52] being
[26:53] sneaky we don't know how these people
[26:55] were but if they were coming maybe they
[26:57] were worshiping just like everybody else
[26:59] and going on and Paul had to rebuke the
[27:01] church why are you letting this go on
[27:03] without something being said about it
[27:06] and I know God rebukes and corrects most
[27:08] of the things over the pulpit and not
[27:11] publicly calling names I understand that
[27:13] because God's a gentleman I want to
[27:15] remind everybody though a scripture and
[27:17] don't get scared I'm not going to do
[27:18] anything tonight but I want to remind
[27:20] you of a scripture that says those that
[27:22] sin rebuke before All That Others May
[27:26] fear
[27:28] every time I read stuff like that people
[27:30] forgot it's in there and people get
[27:32] nervous oh which direction is our pastor
[27:34] going what's next I will by the help of
[27:38] the holy spirit always be a gentleman
[27:40] I'm not wanting to embarrass anybody but
[27:42] I'm also not wanting let to let sin
[27:45] continue in the
[27:46] church that it begins to affect other
[27:50] people those that sin rebuke before All
[27:53] That Others May fear because it has to
[27:54] be a respect for the body of Christ
[27:57] there has to to be a respect and he's
[27:58] challenging them grow up and be real
[28:01] mature Believers and deal with this
[28:03] thing don't let them just keep coming
[28:04] and not address it and sit them down and
[28:06] and say you need to repent of this thing
