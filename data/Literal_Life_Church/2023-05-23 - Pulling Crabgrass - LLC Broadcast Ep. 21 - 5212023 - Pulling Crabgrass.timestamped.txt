[4:20] thank you
[4:27] Proverbs 24 and verse 30
[4:31] I went by the field of the slothful and
[4:35] by the vineyard of the man void of
[4:37] understanding
[4:38] and lo it was all grown over with thorns
[4:42] and nettles
[4:44] had covered the face thereof
[4:46] and the stone wall thereof was broken
[4:49] down so Solomon has went by this man who
[4:52] has this Vineyard and he's seen it grown
[4:55] over I want you to remember that term
[4:57] it's all grown over
[4:59] with thorns and nettles covered the face
[5:02] thereof and the stone thereof was broken
[5:03] down and then I saw and considered it
[5:06] well I looked upon it and received
[5:09] instruction now it's strange that you
[5:12] would look at a man's yard and Vineyard
[5:15] and garden and receive instruction
[5:17] but God can speak through anything
[5:21] I received instruction yet a little
[5:23] sleep a little Slumber a little folding
[5:26] of the hands to sleep
[5:28] so shall thy poverty come as one the
[5:31] traveleth and the and thy want as an
[5:35] armed man
[5:37] you know there are some lessons
[5:38] sometimes that we get by reading
[5:42] by hearing preaching by hearing teaching
[5:45] we not only receive lessons but we
[5:47] receive Revelation from the word of God
[5:50] and so there are there are channels that
[5:52] God has given us for us to get lessons
[5:55] from and most of the time it's from
[5:57] reading and hearing and preaching and
[5:59] teaching but then there are some lessons
[6:02] and instruction and even Revelation that
[6:04] we get in everyday life
[6:07] and that's everyday life by experience
[6:11] and a lot of that experience is not just
[6:13] going through things ourself but
[6:16] observing the life of others watching
[6:18] the life of others we can receive
[6:21] instruction by watching the life of
[6:24] others
[6:25] and we can we can receive wisdom by
[6:29] looking at the fruit of other people's
[6:31] lives and how they are acting how they
[6:35] are responding and we watch it more than
[6:37] what will give up or what more than what
[6:39] we'll admit sometimes that we're very
[6:41] observant of other people's lives and uh
[6:45] often we compare ourselves and the Bible
[6:48] says talks about comparing yourselves
[6:50] and everybody's trying to keep up with
[6:52] the Joneses and get what the next person
[6:54] has so in doing that we're always
[6:55] observing we're always looking and those
[6:58] who are on social media are always
[6:59] watching someone else and whether we
[7:02] realize that we we learn from that and
[7:04] we take instruction from that and we can
[7:06] be influenced from that and we watch how
[7:09] people act and so we can be watching
[7:11] from time sometimes and watch not just a
[7:15] day not just a moment but we can watch
[7:17] for uh many many years from a distance
[7:20] we can watch years unfold in a person's
[7:23] life and then we can see the end result
[7:26] of a person's life and we can observe
[7:28] and see that we can watch them for years
[7:30] and then we see the end result of what
[7:32] direction they went and what they did
[7:34] and we can see the fruit of that and
[7:37] sometimes when we look at a life we're
[7:40] impressed sometimes we say we conclude
[7:43] and say you know what if I would like my
[7:45] life to end I would like to in it to end
[7:48] that way
[7:49] sometimes we're attracted to a life and
[7:52] we say I would like to be more like that
[7:54] there's several mentors in my life that
[7:56] I that I look to and I've looked up to
[7:58] and many of them some of them are even
[8:00] in this church but many of them around
[8:02] the world and I'm glad that God put
[8:04] somebody there because Paul said in the
[8:06] Bible follow me as I follow Christ
[8:09] follow in other words of Christ is in
[8:11] that person and you see the fruit of
[8:13] them growing in the fruit of Christ then
[8:15] we realize that's a person to follow
[8:17] that's a person to look to and I've said
[8:19] I said I want to be I want I don't want
[8:21] to be like that person I tease preachers
[8:23] sometimes because I'll I'll say them
[8:24] even sometimes sometimes when they're
[8:26] younger but when I see something good in
[8:27] them I tell them I want to be just like
[8:29] you when I grow up
[8:30] and uh they kind of chuckle at that
[8:33] because they say the same thing back to
[8:34] me but that's that's something that we
[8:36] look at because we as we get older we
[8:38] look at and we observe things and we see
[8:41] good things and so we're sometimes we're
[8:42] impressed with watching people's lives
[8:44] but sometimes we're disappointed and
[8:47] then we learn from that and watching
[8:48] them and we conclude I don't want to be
[8:50] that way I don't want it to end up that
[8:52] way I don't want to take the same path
[8:55] that that one took I remember in the
[8:58] Bible there was one of the Patriarchs I
[9:00] believe it was Isaac or excuse me um
[9:02] Jacob and uh he had said when his sons
[9:05] went and uh took the the men of the city
[9:08] and one of them had violated their uh
[9:12] their sister and so they went all the
[9:14] brothers and they went and uh
[9:16] circumcised all the men and and and and
[9:18] killed some of them and the daddy didn't
[9:20] know they went and did it when they come
[9:22] back he said you shouldn't have done
[9:23] that and then he prayed he says Lord let
[9:25] me not come into that type of anger
[9:27] that's the way he quoted he says Lord
[9:29] let me never come into that type of
[9:30] anger so he's saying I've seen what
[9:32] they've done but oh Lord I don't want to
[9:34] take that path and sometimes you can
[9:36] look at a life and say I know I don't
[9:38] want to take that path and sometimes you
[9:39] see the path they took and you see the
[9:41] end result and when you see the end
[9:43] result then I know I don't take that
[9:45] path
[9:46] this is what Solomon did here in the
[9:49] text when we read that he got a huge
[9:51] Lesson by walking by someone's Garden
[9:53] someone's yard Solomon walked by a
[9:56] Vineyard and he's seen the garden not
[9:59] kept up seeing the garden was not kept
[10:02] up so things were falling apart and
[10:04] there was Weeds growing and there was
[10:05] Nettles growing and there was Thorns
[10:07] coming up and so he seen the vineyard
[10:10] and he's seen this Garden was not
[10:12] thriving it wasn't producing like it
[10:14] should it wasn't beautiful like it
[10:16] should be and he observed it and said
[10:18] he's seen things over growing and things
[10:21] coming out and and so and I'm sure that
[10:24] person that owned the house and Vineyard
[10:25] they started out they wanted a beautiful
[10:27] every person's one it's a beautiful
[10:29] Vineyard or beautiful yard or a
[10:32] beautiful thing but we all realized that
[10:36] if we watch all the if we if we look in
[10:38] all the magazines of The beautiful
[10:39] landscape yards it doesn't happen just
[10:43] by a picture
[10:45] yeah can I get an amen out of that
[10:47] tonight at least you know you can look
[10:49] at it all you want to but it takes a lot
[10:51] of work it takes a lot of effort and
[10:53] then once you get it in and it looks
[10:54] beautiful then it takes a lot of work
[10:56] after that to keep it thriving to keep
[10:58] it beautiful can you say Mom that's why
[11:00] I don't like Gardens I don't like to
[11:02] plant all this stuff because there's you
[11:04] know weeds that come up and things and
[11:07] so I in the family get left with weeding
[11:09] and why have a garden when it's going to
[11:11] be all suffocating with weeds and all
[11:14] that and that's just the personal little
[11:17] um trouble that I have with Gardens
[11:21] but you see now uh Solomon said it's
[11:24] evident that this person in this so
[11:27] Solomon he looked at the Garden and he
[11:29] looked at this and it was actually a
[11:31] reflection of the person a bit now that
[11:33] seems a bit critical but
[11:35] but it is your life and your your home
[11:40] and your life and your finances and
[11:42] things like that it can reflect
[11:44] something that might be lacking in your
[11:46] life and people get defensive when you
[11:48] talk about it but Solomon's doing that
[11:50] he's walking by this and I'm sure it was
[11:52] a nice person I'm sure they had a great
[11:53] goal to have a Vineyard to have a
[11:55] beautiful fruit coming from it grapes
[11:57] and all but it was evident that the
[11:58] person in the house was not willing to
[12:00] put in the time it takes to keep it
[12:03] flourishing and to keep it growing and
[12:05] there was visible outside things that
[12:07] became a reflection of the person in the
[12:10] house because he made that diagnosis he
[12:13] right away called him a sloth he said
[12:14] his this is a slothful person and he did
[12:17] it by looking at what was taking place
[12:19] outside uh and so so now the visible
[12:22] outside became a reflection of the
[12:24] person in the house and Solomon said
[12:26] he's slothful he's and slawful means
[12:28] lazy and uh a slothful also means the
[12:32] lack of Courage I thought this was
[12:34] interesting an interesting meaning into
[12:36] laziness because we look at laziness a
[12:38] certain way but in the spiritual way
[12:41] laziness is a lack of courage and Zeal
[12:45] for the great things God has in store
[12:48] for those who love him God has great
[12:50] things in store God has more fruit to
[12:53] bear from your life
[12:54] when Jesus in John 15 was speaking about
[12:57] abide in the vine you shall bring forth
[12:59] more fruit and then he goes and said
[13:01] then you'll be pruned and you'll be
[13:02] things even more fruit can you say amen
[13:05] and then he says another stage he said
[13:06] you'll bring forth much fruit more fruit
[13:09] much fruit and as God keeps pruning us
[13:11] and we keep yielding and he keeps
[13:13] cleaning the garden and all these other
[13:15] things he wants us to bring forth more
[13:17] fruit how many know that God has great
[13:19] things in store for them to love him
[13:22] we know that can you say man but we want
[13:25] we don't want to offer a slackness or a
[13:28] slothfulness or a laziness towards God
[13:31] when we know that there are weeds
[13:33] growing in our garden when we know that
[13:34] there's something that's growing within
[13:36] us and we won't address it we let it
[13:38] overgrow everything we can't ignore it
[13:41] can you say Amen we have to be willing
[13:43] to say if I want the results that God
[13:45] has promised me then I got to be willing
[13:47] to take these weeds and things in my
[13:49] life and really be serious with them
[13:51] then he says the end result will be
[13:53] poverty in an armed robber that's what
[13:56] it means there the end result of that
[13:58] person's life will be poverty so in
[13:59] other words they were getting fruit
[14:00] there from their Garden but after all
[14:02] the weeds grow up and take away he has
[14:04] no fruit he has nothing to eat and so
[14:06] now he has to go to Extreme Measures to
[14:09] steal food from someone else an armed
[14:11] robber would go steal food an armed
[14:14] robber if they're not if listen let me
[14:16] say it this way and I'm jumping quickly
[14:18] through things here if they refuse to
[14:20] make their own garden flourish to feed
[14:22] themselves so they'll start stealing
[14:25] from others or bumming off of others or
[14:27] mooching off of others
[14:30] let me say this
[14:32] if if if you don't get the Holy Spirit
[14:35] yourself then you'll mooch off the Holy
[14:37] Spirit from somebody else and you can't
[14:39] do that they said give us of your oil we
[14:42] don't have enough for ourselves going by
[14:44] and get your own oil
[14:46] amen so now we can't mooch off with
[14:48] somebody else this is your own garden
[14:50] this is your own place to flow this is
[14:52] your own spiritual walk and and guess
[14:54] what if everybody falls by the wayside
[14:57] you're not going to want to be depending
[14:58] on them can you say Amen if you have to
[15:01] stand alone you want to say Lord I'll
[15:03] stand with you and this is my garden and
[15:05] I want my garden to flourish in the name
[15:08] of the Lord so this text could be taken
[15:11] many ways it has good lessons in it that
[15:13] I could preach many ways it has good
[15:15] work ethic I could preach on that it it
[15:18] it it shows what it leads to leads to
[15:20] Poverty I could preach this text and
[15:22] preach about procrastination
[15:24] procrastination I can preach about
[15:26] business I could talk about wealth I
[15:30] could talk about good gardening
[15:32] it's all in there
[15:35] but that's not my subject tonight
[15:38] my subject is pulling crabgrass
[15:44] because I hate crabgrass I hate it
[15:47] and
[15:49] this this lesson tonight that I want to
[15:52] take from this scripture is about thorns
[15:55] and nettles and crabgrass
[15:58] and things that we need to weed out and
[16:02] they're not being weeded out
[16:05] this is a spiritual lesson in laziness
[16:07] spiritual laziness
[16:09] to not root out things
[16:12] that take over
[16:13] a good Spirit-filled life
[16:16] be not willing to address what it is
[16:19] that's starting to grow slowly
[16:22] not willing to do it and ignoring it
[16:25] and you can't Thrive spiritually things
[16:27] my subject is pulling crabgrass because
[16:30] I hate crabgrass
[16:32] crabgrass is trying to be real grass and
[16:34] it's not real grass it doesn't look like
[16:35] real grass it looks close sometimes but
[16:38] it's not real grass it's crabgrass and
[16:40] it gets right in the middle of real
[16:42] grass and it makes it look bad and this
[16:44] fella in Proverbs was not willing to see
[16:47] it and to do something about it and if
[16:50] you don't deal with it it begins to take
[16:52] over it begins to keep growing and the
[16:55] term is grown over everything else grown
[16:57] over and that's that's what you got to
[16:59] look at is that when these things are
[17:01] let go in your life then they grow over
[17:03] the other things
[17:05] grown over they're not meant to be there
[17:08] they're squelching you spiritually
[17:10] they're holding you back and they grow
[17:12] over everything else and it breaks a
[17:14] makes a real bad Journey so this thing
[17:17] of addressing our spiritual life and our
[17:19] garden started at the beginning when in
[17:22] Genesis 2 15 it says Adam and Eve he put
[17:25] them in the garden to dress it and to
[17:29] keep it he put them in the Garden of
[17:31] Eden to dress it so this is part of the
[17:33] original plan of God and I know that was
[17:35] a literal Garden of Eden but it has a
[17:37] spiritual connotation so don't leave
[17:39] this part out that God puts a man and
[17:42] woman in a garden to dress it and to
[17:45] keep it
[17:46] and the word keep of course means to
[17:49] guard it so there's a certain guard you
[17:51] put over it from animals getting in or
[17:53] whether that's why they put a wall up
[17:54] sometimes they that's why they put
[17:56] certain fake animals to scare other
[17:58] animals a scarecrow whatever but what
[18:00] are you doing you're gardening your
[18:01] garden you're guarding it when you're
[18:03] asleep you're guarding it when you're
[18:04] away because other things could get in
[18:06] and destroy your garden he put them in
[18:08] the Garden of Eden to dress it and to
[18:10] keep it to guard it and but but to dress
[18:12] it uh he said I put them there to to to
[18:15] guard it but to dress a garden means to
[18:18] preserve it to preserve it and to
[18:20] preserve a garden you have to pull
[18:23] things out that don't belong there
[18:27] that's what Adam and Eve were given as a
[18:28] commission to to dress and to guard to
[18:32] preserve to protect this is what they
[18:35] were given and we don't have those
[18:37] things literally today we have a
[18:39] spiritual inheritance we have a
[18:41] spiritual place that God is planting
[18:44] seeds
[18:45] how many knows where the the mind is the
[18:47] womb to the soul the mind is where the
[18:48] seed is planted we want it to drop from
[18:51] the mind to Revelation but it starts in
[18:54] the mind
[18:55] and when the mind is all messed up and
[18:57] the mind is too busy and the mind is
[18:59] confused or the mind is filled with
[19:01] pornography or the mind is filled with
[19:03] people that hurt you or the thinking
[19:05] life is filled with all kinds of trash
[19:08] god can't plant that seed properly and
[19:11] you because your mind's all messed up
[19:13] so where guards over our minds we're
[19:16] preserving our minds because that's the
[19:17] betting ground to plant God's seeds can
[19:19] you say Amen so this vessel is a garden
[19:22] of God this vessel is a is this Garden
[19:24] that he's given us to to dress and to
[19:26] keep and to guard over and to watch over
[19:28] our minds and to watch over our Spirits
[19:31] because God is wanting to bring forth
[19:33] more fruit from our lives crabgrass is
[19:36] actually similar to similar to that
[19:38] Nettles and that's why I use the text
[19:40] because a crabgrass is a creeping grass
[19:43] I don't even like the name already the
[19:45] meaning a creeping a creeping graph if
[19:48] you're real grass you don't need to
[19:50] creep
[19:52] it's just something devilish about that
[19:55] whole thing creep
[19:57] do you have to creep you just grow up as
[19:59] healthy grass
[20:00] but when you're creeping there's already
[20:02] something wrong with you you gotta go
[20:04] it's a creeping grass that can become a
[20:08] serious weed
[20:10] guy says crabgrass is appropriately
[20:13] named as it often grows low to the
[20:15] ground spreading outwards you're
[20:18] supposed to go upward and you're
[20:19] spreading outwards resembling a crab and
[20:23] that's where crabgrass
[20:27] and the legs just to kind of grow out
[20:30] from it
[20:32] and like this Nettles it just keeps
[20:34] growing and growing and takes over and
[20:36] it sucks the life from the good things
[20:39] and so uh I don't I won't go on but I'll
[20:42] just say it's got to be pulled up from
[20:44] the roots
[20:45] can you say Amen it's got to be pulled
[20:48] up from the roots there's no other way
[20:50] to deal with it and if we don't deal
[20:52] with I'm going to be direct if we don't
[20:53] deal with our defenses our Thorns our
[20:57] anger our resentment our crabbiness our
[21:01] victim mentality
[21:04] our negativity are complaining our
[21:07] crabbiness if we don't deal with it it
[21:11] will just keep growing in our life and I
[21:13] know this is a simple message to you
[21:15] tonight but it's where the rubber meets
[21:17] the road if you ignore the crabgrass in
[21:20] your life it'll take over the good
[21:22] that's in you
[21:24] it'll smother out living in the spirit
[21:26] of God we can't be lazy can you say Amen
[21:30] about something in our life that's
[21:31] irritating others and irritating us it
[21:34] should be irritating you
[21:36] and we can't be lazy about that it's
[21:38] going to keep growing and it's time to
[21:40] get it out and to root it out and to say
[21:43] well some people say well that wasn't
[21:44] that wasn't really me I've had a bad
[21:47] week that really wasn't me well if it
[21:49] wasn't really you then get it out of you
[21:53] because it's taken over your garden
[21:56] people said well that I acted out of
[21:59] place but that wasn't really me well if
[22:01] it wasn't you then why did you do it
[22:06] if it's not a part of your garden it's
[22:08] not a part of your plan it's not a part
[22:10] of your Vineyard doesn't fit the word
[22:12] don't be criticizing somebody else look
[22:14] at your own garden say do I have some
[22:16] crabgrass here do I have some Nettles
[22:18] here do I have some thorns in my life
[22:21] and you say man then I'm ignoring and
[22:23] it's becoming irritating to my wife or
[22:25] to my husband or to my children
[22:30] praise the Lord I used to make fun of
[22:33] people old people especially that got
[22:35] down and I'd watch them all day in their
[22:38] front yard in their Gardens and in their
[22:40] landscape down in their hands and knees
[22:42] I laughed at them for years because
[22:44] they're they're they're they're pulling
[22:46] everyone out pulling everyone out for
[22:48] hours in the Heat and I laugh because as
[22:51] a young person you say
[22:53] you know there's other things for that
[22:57] you know I was going to title this
[22:58] message tonight
[22:59] the young use a weed whacker the old
[23:03] pull it out from the roots
[23:05] I said I thought all those years I've
[23:06] been laughing at those people and I'd be
[23:08] getting the weed whacker and thinking
[23:10] that's that's solving the problem and
[23:12] you know why we choose it because it's
[23:13] the easy way
[23:15] we choose the weed whacker because it's
[23:17] a quick and now we got batteries I got
[23:19] the battery weed whackers you don't have
[23:20] to string the cord all the way out there
[23:22] it's got a good battery you can go for a
[23:24] long time and you weed whack off the top
[23:26] of the weeds but you're not pulling it
[23:28] out by the root now I'm describing many
[23:32] many Christians today that are willing
[23:34] to come into service and the weed Walker
[23:36] whacker knocks the surface things off
[23:39] and you feel good for a while but nobody
[23:41] hardly is willing to stay with it until
[23:43] God you say God I want you to root this
[23:46] out of my life
[23:49] but when you get older you don't think
[23:51] in the terms of young because you
[23:52] realize all the years I'm whacking that
[23:54] off it's not doing any good I'm going to
[23:56] have to get down as an old person even
[23:58] not even your back problems everything
[23:59] else I'm going to have to lay down there
[24:01] like they're doing and I'm gonna have to
[24:02] grab that and pull it out by the roots
[24:05] is anybody listening to what I'm
[24:06] preaching here tonight I must stay with
[24:09] if you need the Holy Ghost you're going
[24:10] to stay with it until God gives it to
[24:12] you if you need a deeper walk with God's
[24:14] going to stay with it you're going to
[24:15] keep bringing that prayer before God if
[24:17] you've got habits in your life say God
[24:18] I'm going to stay before your throne
[24:20] until you take this habit Away From Me
[24:21] Lord
[24:22] you don't quit can you say man you don't
[24:25] give up when you've got a garden and you
[24:26] want it to flourish you don't give up
[24:28] you keep working at it
[24:30] may God help us to keep working at it I
[24:33] rejoice when someone is willing to be
[24:35] honest and submit we have many in this
[24:37] congregation
[24:39] and I like the atmosphere maybe it's
[24:41] because it's the way I lean but I like
[24:43] people who will get real honest and real
[24:46] submissive to say I want to get to the
[24:49] bottom of my issues and why I'm acting
[24:52] the way I'm acting sometimes it ends up
[24:55] I need the Holy Ghost but sometimes it's
[24:57] not that sometimes that you're ignoring
[24:59] something that Satan's using
[25:01] you're given certain territory
[25:03] and when we cross into this Promised
[25:05] Land of the life of the Holy Ghost no
[25:07] territory belongs to Satan at all you've
[25:09] got to go take it
[25:11] when they stepped over Jordan and they
[25:13] had the whole land before then that new
[25:15] generation and God encouragement says I
[25:18] will be with you as I was with Moses
[25:21] what a charge that should give to your
[25:23] hearts can you say Amen to tell Joshua
[25:25] as I was with Moses I will be with you
[25:28] you go and take it every place to put
[25:31] your ghost every place your foot will
[25:33] get upon is your ground
[25:36] Satan could be ran out of there
[25:39] and then later on in Joshua as they
[25:41] conquered many of the lands he Joshua
[25:44] when he when he was old
[25:46] he said stand up he says listen
[25:48] tell the rest of the tribes of evil
[25:50] Israel how long will you be slacked

[25:56] much more land to possess you read your
