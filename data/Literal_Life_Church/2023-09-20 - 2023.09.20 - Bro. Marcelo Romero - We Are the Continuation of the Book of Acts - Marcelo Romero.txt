four years of believing watching it at action as a testimony tonight amen and then then the thoughts the thoughts devil the devil brings us give up and all these other things my way to cast those thoughts away our God is real can you say we might go through a low time but like brother daler said Sunday Samson he had made mistakes the reason he had his eyes poked out the reason he was in defeat in front of the Enemy being mocked and embarrassed and we'll get to those spots but he's type of the Bride because even in that condition he said Lord just one more time Lord just one more time and that's the bride rising from your condition rising up and saying but I'm still a Son of God God one more time and I like what brother Daryl said Sunday too he said we don't serve a God that we just go to him pray to him and we we say these he's a God that answers back that's the distinction in a denominational system and a church that would just uh teach the people to pray well we pray but we're praying for God to answer back and praise the Lord through the message through others like this through our lives we have a God that answers back now he might not answer right on time for you but he's always on time it's always on time thank you brother Marcelo David and Mr Romero as well I always forget her first name but you guys are family to us your family to us here okay you're always welcome to move up here move up to Michigan amen father we thank you for the word of life tonight I thank you for testimonies Lord and for the preaching to remind us to bring us into Faith or to step out believe that all things are possible now we take it to our situations and our trials and our things that seem impossible we apply it Lord say God is able you're able Lord to work in my situation granted father may it be something more than a sermon tonight but every heart catch it for themselves even if they're believing for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and a change in their heart that they become a miracle themselves it's not just physical healing but it's spiritual healing God I pray father you granted Lord to each one who's seeking after you bless each one that goes tonight in your protection and your love in Jesus name amen everybody said amen Sunday morning to class at 10 30 with the children also the adult class regular service at 11 o'clock God bless you all for listening
