[1:25:19] tonight amen and then then the thoughts
[1:25:23] the thoughts devil the devil brings us
[1:25:25] give up and all these other things my
[1:25:26] way to cast those thoughts away our God

[1:25:31] a low time but like brother daler said
[1:25:34] Sunday Samson he had made mistakes the
[1:25:37] reason he had his eyes poked out the
[1:25:39] reason he was in defeat in front of the
[1:25:40] Enemy being mocked and embarrassed and
[1:25:43] we'll get to those spots but he's type
[1:25:45] of the Bride because even in that
[1:25:47] condition he said Lord just one more
[1:25:49] time
[1:25:50] Lord just one more time and that's the
[1:25:52] bride rising from your condition rising
[1:25:54] up and saying but I'm still a Son of God
[1:25:57] God one more time and I like what
[1:25:59] brother Daryl said Sunday too he said we
[1:26:01] don't serve a God that we just go to him
[1:26:03] pray to him and we we say these he's a
