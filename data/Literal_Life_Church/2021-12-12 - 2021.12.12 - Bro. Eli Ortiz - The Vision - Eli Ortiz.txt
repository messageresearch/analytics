========================================

i'm a title my preaching of this sermon the vision the vision not the vision the vision because i know where there's no vision there's a division so proverbs 29 18 where there is no vision the people perish but that but he that keeps the law happy is he i'd like to see what the niv it says the new international version where there is no revelation i want that to soak in a little bit but there's no revelation people have no restraint why because if there's no vision you're blind people that don't know where they're going they go everywhere if you don't have a target to hit you can shoot anywhere you want to and you can hit everybody on the way too if you don't have a objective you don't have a goal so where you gonna go any way you like to so there's no restraint but bless is the man who he says his wisdom and instruction this is what brother branham says in the disposition of the seven eight churches he says no man knows the things of god so we're going to have revelation because nobody knows he says nobody knows the things of god save the spirit of god and he to whom the spirit of god reveals so he decides who he wants to rebuild things that is his prerogative so we need to call on god for revelation more than anything else in the world and the bride loves revelation and we need it it's not a 40 years ago but i had a revelation what about today because revelation is a vision so every day you have to be from glory to glory you're moving towards the vision but it has to be by revelation that you're moving towards the vision it is not something that we just figure out but today i'm going to do this you know this is a good day to go to church well you know that's you know humanly speaking you cannot make yourself come to church if god don't give you the revelation and the desire to come to church you won't come to church because god would not share his glory with no human being it is all him or nothing he says revelation more than anything else we have accepted the bible we have accepted the great truth but still it's not real i want you to think about those words what i'm preaching real to most people because the revelation but the spirit is not there so we have the bible says we have people that have a form of godliness you know this law a lot of churches today they have a form of godliness even in the message nothing wrong with the form the former godliness is okay it has to be because the bible says jesus said it will be so close so close that if it was possible it will deceive the very elect the form of godliness is real close so close that by your naked eye you can decide which way to go unless by the spirit of god you are led so the form of godliness is so close so therefore what's the difference the bible said the form of godliness denying the power of the what of the spirit they have are worshipping god they're praying to god they're reading the bible they're doing everything you do they're casting out demons people are getting healed miracles supernaturals that all happen in idea see the same form of godliness however they don't have the power to change they don't have the power for that word that they're preaching to change them to the world so that's why we need revelation you come to church and without revelation it becomes it becomes a verse when i was a baptist that's what i did i can't quote you all the verses they help me that they show me how to testify and what to memorize you know when i go and witness to people but that was just word that was just word it was no life into it because the word without the spirit is not life is dead in actuality the bible said the word by himself will it kill it if you the letter the word by himself will kill you so i don't want to be sitting down there it's coming out of the pulpit i don't want to be alive but it's killing me why because no spirit the spirit has to give you the revelation of that word or we come in and we go out the same way even worse because we pick up a few spirits in the way he says we have accepted the bible we have accepted the great truth but it still is not real to most people because the revelation by the spirit is not there it says the word has not been quickened see says the bible says in ii corinthians 5 21 that we have become the righteousness of god by our union with jesus christ did you get it it says that we are the very righteousness of god himself by by being in christ it says that jesus he jesus became sin for us it does not said he became sinful but becomes sin for us that by our union with him we might become the righteousness of god if we accept the fact and we must that he literally became seen for us by his substitution for us then we must also accept the fact that we by our our union with him have become the very righteousness of god you cannot have it both ways he forgave my sin yeah but you god in flesh it is his heartiness to reject one is to reject the other one to accept one is to accept the other one now we know that the bible says that it cannot be denying but the revelation it is missing the revelation is always missing the spirit that come and quicken that word in our bodies in the meantime we just sit there yeah yeah and that's fine when we are a child we are like a child and we have to grow don't be impatient with those people don't be impatient with people that are less immature they have to go through through childhood training but once they mature god will lead them the same way like you you have to tolerate you know you that 40 50 years tolerate the one that just came in because sooner or later he went up like you i'm even better i know not better but the revelation is missing it's not real to the majority of god children's whoa see how important is revelation without a revelation you can have a vision god has to show you a vision this morning it is just a good verse in the bible that's all and that's what they have at the denomination they got good word but that's all but we need to have it made what alive quicken and that takes revelation so righteousness i am the righteousness of god in a broad sense it is the state of him who is as he act to be potentially i am in his eyes what i act to be see that's what i'm looking at i'm not looking at this guy that made me fall and looking what i ought to be because that is what i am this is not what i am the vision said that's what i am because is a condition acceptable and approved god approved me already in christ i don't need your acceptance i already been accepted you cannot put me in you're going to take me out because i already been accepted and this morning i don't need your approval on this preaching because you already accepted it so do you approve it or not it has nothing to do with anything but it's good that you will accept it too if you come from him now definition kind of simple definition i don't like to get bogged down because i know i cannot get out then i don't want to get myself too deep so i keep the act of power or of anticipating that which will or may come to be the righteousness of god that's what i want that's what i got that's what i want to be but a definition of a vision is the power to anticipate see some time i asked my children and even young people what did you want to be oh ain't got no idea i said you almost graduated do you have your mind made up you have a course you have traced that do you have a desire no so how can you become something that you don't know what it is that you want to become see no anticipation that don't mean they're going to stay there on these days you know something clicks ah now you have a vision i'm anticipating to be an engineer or whatever see anticipation of what you want to become and what you and i want to become is the righteousness of god brother branham define vision this way a vision is just many people ask me this is 56408 okay but the problem it is material that you look at it says or it is just impressing your mind something that you imagine he says no no is material wow it's just as real remember about revelations rio is just as real as i am looking right now to you so i can almost touch it probably it's so tangible that i almost can't just grab it it says now now how that happened is done by the sovereign grace of god he has nothing to do with it and you and i have nothing to do with that he says his friends about the the light the hand over the room and he's been like that all the time i want to show you guys vision here so you can understand a little bit more where i'm going with this masterpiece masterpiece the perfect image that god man god man that's the perfect image that god had in his mind and morphe and you know what a morphe is it's just a form it's an impression it's a copy see it's an appearance it looked like it you know i was looking at this and it made sense when god took on a form like with abraham he took on a form a human form but that human form he created it right there it wasn't born in the belly of a woman it wasn't you know it doesn't grow ate you know from the ground fed the cells and whatever was in the ground that becomes that no right away he is a human being melchizedek when he made abraham again you know that was just the form of what jesus christ was going to be later on however that wasn't the real thing it was a form because that body was still like this body that was made up there quickly perfect boom this body was done made that way so that was the difference that was a that was a an impression that was going to be later on now think about it because that's what a vision is he has changed from the supernatural so he got his supernatural and he went to the vision see and then the vision was projected that image that he had in his mind became a vision and then it was what projected and jesus christ was born same thing with you and i you were in his mind or the supernatural but you didn't stay there you became the vision then and then once you become the vision the revelation of what god one tended to be then you are manifested in that flesh but it was already seen before the foundation of the world your beginning you had any no beginning and he saw your end he saw the vision he saw everything see and that image was meeting that the supernatural god could taste of the feeling of death you cannot kill god god is a spirit so how can god taste of that taste it he says not that he was dead see but the body could die jesus body died and he tasted in that body of the death god then in the cross jesus said it is finished and he healed the spirit that was god but the body stayed in the cross you will see him again when he comes back you will not see that body nobody die this body is going to die this is not eli that you're going to see when the change of you know body will come i have a more perfect body than this one and my wife said hallelujah upper because i told her you know that i was perfect she don't believe me but one of these says she's going to believe me i will be perfect the way that god anticipated that us was going to be a morphe so the same thing with the churches i used the scriptures in in second titles three you know five having a form of godliness is a form they're trying to copy they're trying to look like but it's not real this is not real ah that body that i have over that that's why waiting for me is more real than this you see they're having a form of godliness but it's not real because they don't have the power to make that to project it to manifest it so in hebrew uh let's see let me give you another vision that's god let me give you jesus vision hebrew 12 too because i'm trying to show you if god had to have a vision and jesus had to have a vision you have to have one you cannot escape without one you're gonna go through through life through the literally look like in the tulips picnics it just won't work because you won't get nowhere you're wasting time listen looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was said before him endure the cross for the joy that was the vision the bride for that vision of her he endured the cross when he was in the cross i was in his mind you you was in his mind that's why he endured the cross because he was in hessemania he says he was human father can can we have another way to do this can this cause cup will pass it's another way but that vision kept him on track he knew but he kept him in track to do what he needed to do because that was a revelation to him that was a vision that he could not go dva left or right but he tried he tried so he got had a vision and jesus had a vision so in matthew 26 39 i just read you this one i quoted when jesus went to pray if it's possible let this cup cup pass from me nevertheless not me but you will see that's what a vision will keep you will keep you to make the right choices without a vision you just make you got one choice whatever the devil wants to pull you through but when you have a vision you keep you on track your life keeps going moving forward the devil will try to deviate you from left to right but that vision of who you are what you are you make a decision based on that so you have to have a vision because no other way you can decide what's left or what right unless you know what's straight ahead so you stay you stay in that journey moving forward it says you know jesus could have a wife it was rightful he has right to have a family children's to have a job to have a car everything that you have he had a right to but he said i will sanctify myself for her and we're not going to sanctify ourselves for for him sanctify you mean you just leave the world alone don't conform to the world but be transformed to that image i'm kind of going ahead of me but enoch he walked and he hey brother brother paul i'm glad that he didn't run i cannot run any longer i lost my breath but the bible said he walked so don't do not to run okay you can relax and take it easy in this journey you know you know step out of time brother i remember faster than you and i passed you don't worry about it because the first kid there is not the winner it's just your mentality you're not competing against anybody that's the problem with with christians we compare ourselves with everybody you don't need to you compare yourself with god word forget where that guy is at he has to do the same you do so you don't compress you know you keep walking you know and satan throw you in the left and throw you in the right and pick you in the front on the back and everywhere and you just ignore and you just keep walking you keep walking towards that vision you can walk into a division and you know walk walk until he took his last step and he became the vision that must have been tremendous can you imagine i cannot even imagine it going from time one more step and then suddenly something changed one of these days as we continue walking you want to walk towards the vision because you need to become the vision you need to step up on that vision so it's important that you have what you know i keep thinking about that day i cannot even imagine we can't i mean this is too limited you know we are finite people we're trying to figure out infinite things that we don't even know but but we do our best with what we have so i was thinking one of these days the wife and i are going to take a straw you know and suddenly jump and i'm gonna look at her and i'm gonna say oh my goodness where were you being all these years [Laughter] i was looking for you when were you hitting ah and she's going to look at me and say well husband so we are you look better than than before that i met you and then we're going to look in the mirror and say wow my see that's what's gonna happen that's what i'm looking towards i'm looking to step into that vision i die before i get there doesn't matter if i die listen this you need to listen to this paul or his group died at throughout the seven churches everybody died but when they went down in the ground they went down with an that's anticipation paul says not that i already apprehended not that already there damn that already perfect but i'm moving towards the goal so i moved toward the goal and if i die if i fall there i die without anticipation so when the lord comes and quick me yes there's no you know upgrading or there's not trying to remember what where i was before that and after that i already know it's just my anticipation and all those that they died 2000 years ago they died with an anticipation and when they come back it's still going to be there they just can't move they're just going to become that anticipation but you have to you know if we go the way of the grave we have to have a vision and death death cannot even separate me from the love of god there's nothing not even a weapon can be created to destroy me and separate me from the my anticipation there's no weapon form satan you lost god you win you know satan is is a good enemy i mean i mean but next time he comes around you you tell them hey satan you know what i heard that everything that was created has to die wink wink so far as i know your time is near but wait wait satan how hold on this is islaming for you satan i was not created i was in the mind of god before the foundation of the world so if i got eternal life i was in god i cannot die more than god can die so you tell satan satan i'll tell you something i'm gonna give you a a little thing in what's gonna happen in the future i said i will be in the kicking team that is to kick you in that hole in that day when your days are numbered and i'm going to be there part of that he won't like that but that's right he created too many problems i need to create some from him now so you know you're the master of your choices we're gonna go to that in a minute not satan you're the master of your choices you know you want to be happy this morning it's your choice i cannot make you happy i cannot do anything for you it is your choice you want to be sad your choice you want to be happy your choice you want to be healed your choice i can pray for you all i want but it's your choice do you want the healing you have choices he has not taken away the choices but i'm glad that because we got him we can make the right choices when the time comes okay you don't have to pay for that that was free for the earnest expectation let's go about my vision we saw god we saw jesus now your vision for the earnest expectation of the creature waited waited for the manifestation of the sons of god it's getting a little warm here i'm glad i took the other one off there you you wore me but i'm not sweating i'm not sweaty so first corinthians 13 11 says when i was a child i speak like a child i understood as a child thought as a child but when i became a man i put away child distance you know that's the worst the worst you can see a 40 year old baby crying in church i mean that's kind of too far right when you're a man you grow and you leave all that stuff this is what brother brown says ladies and gents he is the true witness now this word true is the same word as we saw back there in revelation 3 7. you recall that it does not mean true as in a constant as in contrast with false it has a richer deeper by far meaning like that it says it says eat express perfect realization in contrast with partial realization we are living in a partial realization you only can see what it's going to be but it's not here yet i'm not having change i'm still moving towards my change see so what you're seeing is just partial but it would come the day that will express the perfect that what you see impartially right now it will become that see it says partial realization it says hallelujah we have been looking through a glass darkly you know he said but soon it will be face to face i will be known as he knew me right now it's kind of well i see i see you look like you must be you you talk you smell like you it must be you rely yes but there's something that is me that is going to be the realization of that word you don't see it yet i'm not there yet but just wait a little longer and this will be they realize what god had in his mind this is he says we have been looking through the glass diary but soon as you will be face to face we have been going from glory to glory you come to church because you need to grow from glory to glory what is the glory of god is character what are you doing that's growing in the character you know his character but if you don't come to church what happened well at least listen at the tape you know it won't be the same effect being in here like coming to church sorry you cannot duplicate the spirit of god in the machine that's right but you can listen another word at least i got my my meta make it real to you by revealing it to you perfect realization complete realization we have we have been looking through a glass darkly but soon it will be face to face and those times are here this is not the end time this is the end of the end time we are that close and the closer we get to the vision the closer you're going to see him face to face you're going to get a glimpse you know of him as you walk and the more you walk and the closer you walk you're going to start seeing him clear and the more clear you see his word at him the more clear you see yourself in him he says faith we have been going from glory to glory but soon you will write glory in the right glory like king not glory to glory to glory to glory until glory god we going out of here my brother asked me yesterday i think it was he says how are you feeling ah so far so good and he says well let me tell you a joke about that okay this guy went up in the building hi and he jumped and he was going down somebody yelled at him how's it going what's so far so good i said well thank you brother that's your interpretation mine is so far so good but i'm not going down and going up [Applause] and not hitting the ground heavenly places so so far so good but see there's more to come the better year has to come this is so far so good departure realization but one of these days hey i'm gonna get there and i'll be complete hallelujah [Applause] so don't lose your hope don't lose your enthusiasm for the coming of the lord again it says we have been going from glory to glory but soon it will run right into the glory see you become the vision you walk right into the vision you have to keep it always in front of you because that's what you want to become and then you can deal with the life the left and the right and all the things that come to you that are trying to pull you out no i know where i'm going and i'm gonna stay with the gates of god this is where i'm going i don't care if they were fall that's my goal it says i don't care nobody want to come with me that's my goal i don't believe sometimes and i'm not saying this i'm not criticizing not judging anybody but some people after 30 years in this message do you think they had a vision i think they had a television but not a vision because if they had a vision you would never fall jesus didn't fall he was concentrated focused on the vision so i don't think they never had a vision they had an agenda but they never had a vision we had couples in our church not not past years but you know a few years back they come to church families they sit there with us for years and years suddenly they disappear and i wonder what happened then later on i hear she divorced him kids are in the street and i said something is wrong that's not god god cannot light me he cannot like he says you know i will finish the work that i started that's what and i'm you know holding to that i committed on to him because i know that he started the work he will finish it so what happened well keep saying there was no vision and it was no revelation however they sat down there for so many years but it was words verses it was bible it was never a revelation says it says from greater glory right into the glory and his glory capital and his glory will shine now i want you to i want to stop him you know there's no way you're getting closer to him every day in this journey and you're growing towards that and you won't shine it the the you know the way i can tell that you are getting closer is the way you act because the closer you get you should be sweet tough sweeter than the day before said the sun so the closer you get to that you must shine and people will look at you saying i don't understand chaos two years called me died but you're not worried about it see the darkness is pressing in mondays and darkness but you and i we shine because the darkness cannot put the light out we can put the darkness but not the light so the closest you get there he must shine a burst that is a asaya 360 uh arise and shine yeah that your light has come the closer you get the more light you cannot be the same if you're telling me you are getting closer and closer closer something got to change if you're getting closer to that something must change because god do not lie it's wonderful my wife said get closer get closer you need to change you know sometimes i i'm sorry sometimes i just lose it sometimes you know and uh sometimes you push the wrong buttons and i and i come out and i had to apologize i'm not there yet i'm just partially but i'm i'm gonna get there because it's god is gonna have you push the button until this button don't work anymore you know when the tempo was built it was no noise it was the tools once the rock was cut out there somewhere and brought to the temple they put them together and you know how they feed them until there was no gap perfectly and that's what's happening in church [Applause] see paul paul and me we come together and we talk and you come to church and the word and your wife or your husband your brother tell you something that you didn't like and you had to either by your tone or say something but that is listen if you have never been disappointed you will as long as you display in this flesh you're going to say you're sorry but that is part of the and it's not the outside people that are going to do that it's in the temple see i'm going to rob myself and get my brother my brain against me until we can feed because we're not living here until we can feed god did not create a temple that is crooked with cracks and water go through and we don't know it is sealed completely and this body is going to be tight it will be so tight that satan cannot even enter in we want to come to the point says now everything looks good and you got a worshipping and everything fine but it's going to come today that satan will infiltrate you know he would send somebody he had to use a body he says when he do that the closest you can get to each other that's what you want to do because you don't want satan in between you and your brother so when satan comes with some gossip i don't care who we're going to use to gossip and i don't have nobody in mind but if the shoe feed just squirt it god said 17 16 i hate but the last one is an abomination those that so what discord not in church if somebody trying to fill your ear with trash tell them this is not a trash trashcan [Applause] [Music] because i know what's going to happen if i hear that stuff you know i had a brother one time i love that brother he said to me i gotta tell you something about swalson some brother at church i was new in the message anyway so he figured you know i would not know the difference but anyway he says i want to tell you what happened to that brother and i said ho ho stop let me ask you a question if that's going to affect the way i'm looking at him now probably okay i don't want to know you know why because when you hear god said you like it or not it's going to affect the way you look at that sister and that brother because when you look at her now you're thinking about what you were saw so don't accept any trash because that is the devil don't lend your ears to trash stay just honing each other when you come to surrey home home home and let all that impurity out well again free i don't know who needed that but that we are we are complete with him the truth he would not lie to us about that see but one day will be be changed are we in the same place i don't know we uh that's good enough he says it is wonderful we are completing him that is true he will not lie to us that's what i was talking about he says we will put immortality it will be a change one of these days we will be all swallow swallow up in life it says then we will realize realization whenever you realize now who you are and what you are one of these days you will realization of that but you have to keep it fresh in your mind that's why you come to church you want to keep it afresh this is what god said this is who i am this is what i was supposed to do you have to be afraid every day because satan will will try to steal it from you put immortality proverbs 29 18. i want to give you another version then the living translation he says when people do not accept divine guidance they run wow that's bad to come to church and don't listen to the word coming out of the pulpit you go out there and you wrong wow but whosoevers obey the law it's joyful let me make a quick statement here there are some people that will not to come to church they believe not coming to church and those people who are the pandemic have made it real nice now they have excuse not to come to church before the pandemic they had excuses well not excuses they had reasons why but now with the pandemic oh brother i think i have a little nose running i'm gonna stay home the reason is you need welcome to i mean if you sick stay home no that's not what i'm saying but there's some people that are using excuses the pandemic and we knew that two years ago when it started and then the preachers had to be streaming they didn't want to bro the dog didn't want to my pastor because he knew what was going to happen he already saw it he said now people get adjusted they sit in there with their pajamas and popcorn and watch them oh come on don't tell me that you don't do that don't come on you don't put your best clothes three-piece suit and sit down in your living room okay we're here anyway so you know you cannot recreate what happened in here a while ago the the presence of god fell and people scream and people yell and the atmosphere change you cannot do in the living room you know why this is god program that wasn't brother paul decided but this is what we're going to have church instead is that we're going to do this no church is god program it's not us now because every church is autonomous we don't have cookie cutters everybody got to do the same thing you know we have certain variations but this is god's program to shape you to form you to his image by taking the word and you know taking all that out that is undisturbed that god don't like on your life you know like a masterpiece cheap chip chip and when we preach the gospel you know start shaping you don't get that at home because at home something is missing it's not the same thing okay i can chase only one thousand at home watching on my streaming how many people we have here thousands so not that was gonna come to that door because there's more walls than you have in the living room so there's more power here to chase these demons and the sprays away so god can do a work on you well that's my take off anyway it says having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof a person with no vision is blind period jesus says let the blind lead the blind in this message pastors know the denomination they have no vision it's a blind lead in the blind and you know what's going to happen they fall in the hole because that's all the target they have no target so a person that is blind you know at the end of the street i see him gonna assist it they got a little you know so they walk by feelings we don't walk by feeling we walk by but they go by feeling you know i feel i feel i feel get out of the way i feel afraid you're in my way and when you do that you are prone to to me perhaps you know because you don't know what is idea you're blind you don't see the obstacles you cannot prepare prepare for what you cannot even know what to prepare for because you don't see it at war you have to know what your enemy what you see what he do how he dress how he fight in football the same thing they look at the tape they look at the tape they look at the taste so they can prepare you cannot prepare if you don't know what you're getting into you can do the best but you're going to fail because you don't know what's coming at you see so they cannot anticipate so you cannot prepare see you cannot focus on anything you're blind you can focus so a vision a lack of a lack of vision or purpose see results in people that are not prepared unprepared and we still got people in churches sitting for years and they're not prepared because they have no vision they have an agenda but they got no vision because if we all have the same vision that is the same vision for you and me for this body it's the same vision so if it's the same vision it should be not division right if it's the same vision we come to the vision and we unite together on that vision and if you're not uniting on that vision you are disuniting amen so it is important because a vision if you don't have a vision people tend to drift away that's why we have people in church one year and then they go on the next i'm not talking about those that lived because work and had to move no not talking about that see drifting alone in the christian journey and then you wonder what what happened to swansea what you know what i call them hitchhikers yeah they go from church to jersey psyche he's shocked that's why brother brown calls him i got a quote the hitchhike no i got a quote for you if you want to hitchhiking from church to church because they don't know what they want they don't even know what they look what they want so they go from church to church maybe that pastor maybe that pastor maybe that pastor no it's not the pastor it's not the church it is you because you left here with a problem and when you get there the problem goes when we do you and maybe when you got there everything was perfect no no more when you get there because you're going to start all over again the posture is greener in the other side no it's not i tried that don't work i need to move on philippians 3 1 not as i i had already attained it either were already perfect but i follow after i follow after ambition it says if that i may apprehend it that which also i am apprehended in christ see it's not you it's not you that what took hold of you jesus christ that was two whole of your heart is the same one that you're trying to get hold to you get hold to that don't let it go you don't have to he won't let you go but it's not you trying it is him pulling you through you just had to eat yourself you had to commit you had to discipline yourself it says i'm jumping ahead again it says philippians 3 13 he says brother and sister i do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it yet maybe don't look what i ought to be right now but watch your brother it might not look like i would have to be but one of these days it will he says i will surprise a lot of people one of these days rayman says you're going to be surprised that day who made it and who didn't because sometimes we like to judge by by seeing the cover of the book but you don't know who it's going to who's not you need to worry about yourself and let everyone let your light shine so somebody can follow he said brother and sister says i don't consider myself yet there yet but i'm on my way philippians 3 14 i press store that's what we need to do press store every day just press toward the mark it says the goal to win the prize for which god has called me in heaven word you see and going how it goes so far so far so good so far seemed so good so far so good i pursue i pursue that you know that's an aggressive we're pursuing you know my wife she pursued me until she got what she wanted i'll tell you the testimony one of these i'm gonna pay for this let me conclude now that i'm ahead let me conclude a vision it's a powerful anticipation yeah you know what i'm talking about kenny a vision so i won't be by myself in this this thing a vision is a powerful anticipation so if i'm out you out we all got together at least okay better stop a vision is a powerful anticipation of who you are to be a vision creates consistent discipline you know why we don't have people discipline in church and they come and they don't come and they go and they don't go no vision no vision no discipline that's right and you wonder why someone come one day don't come the other day no i understand that some people live too far i understand that i'm not getting on that but if you're in town and you're healthy come and praise the lord for because you don't even why would you stay home that's what i'm talking about you're sick you're sick i'm not talking about that so a vision creates consistent discipline and consistent discipline will lead to desire you know what people are not discharged to come to church because they are not disciplined god is not going to give you this heart if he knows that you're not going to do it if you don't discipline yourself to come and come in good when it's bad when it's ugly god will not give you an option when you come to church god will give you a desire to come to church and when you're in church they give you an auction but it depends on the choice that you make because when i was time why you want me to give you this hour when you don't want to go show me first that you want to go and that's how god works you want the holy spirit you have to desire the holy spirit how much more than than your own life because when you do that he will give it to you but how much do you care he cares but how much do we care he says discipline that lead to desire and desire becomes a devotion see once you hear once you decided when you make your mind i have decided to follow jesus snow storm call that's not gonna even stop me to be here this morning because this is the place i'd rather be see i think i was called like esther this is my time god call you this is the end time it's your time you know that god is going to do something that he had never done before and you are the one that are going to show that you're going to be raptured you're going to be changed in a twinkle you know that has not been done yet that is new and you are the generation that had to do that and those seven six edges are waiting on you see because they are not complete without you so they're counting on you that you will change so they can come back if you don't change they ain't not coming back but we are not going to disappoint them god is not going to disappoint them he's going to finish our work when you try to discipline yourself you train and you're trying to act according to your goal to your vision if i was going to go to olympics to do whatever run or run i will that's my vision to win the olympic by running this race so i will discipline myself do everything that i need to so i can fulfill my vision see so you discipline yourself you train yourself don't indulge in a lot of sweets if you're running carbons okay if you're going to burn them fine you need a lot of carbs but you stay away from the things that are not good to you when you're training you discipline yourself you sleep you rest you work you have a good attitude because you if you have an attitude like you're not going to win then why run paul says not everybody's going to win but you need to run a race like you're gonna win that's a mental attitude because i'll tell you what 80 20 of a race is physical or 50 but mentally it's the other 50 percent you can be tip top shape but your mind can make you fall you need a mind that is ready and prepared as well as your body now this is what the bible said it says work how he says work do not i got to remember that scripture later i had a senior moment later i can claim that oh work prophet leader thank you somebody was thinking about so i picked her up no you laugh but it's true proximity something about proximity you know that i can sit down in my car my wife in the other side and i'm driving and i'm thinking i want a juicy hamburger when i get to phoenix before we take the airplane or whatever and i'm thinking so hard and she says do you want to stop in babylon get a hamburger but that wasn't her proximity you know when you get next to each other you can kind of oh i didn't know you were thinking that you pick up this is you know a thought is a spirit because the bible said the word is spirit so when you get a spirit on you come on listen this is not this is not rocket science when somebody has a bad spirit you detect it right away when somebody is mean and somebody's jealous or somebody just completely wants to harm you you feel it right away in fact don't take too long she's against me i don't i don't even near her she has a bad spirit but what about a good spirit don't tell me you can send satan's spirit and you cannot send god's spirit when you get next to a nice garlic brother or sister okay i was there so anyway so discipline run the race you know with a mental attitude that you're gonna get there regardless i'm not worrying about who's in my side who behind me who's in front of me my focus is on the goal he says hebrew 12 1 therefore seeing we also are going to pass without about we saw great clout or witnesses let us lay aside every way listen this is the time we cannot be bogged down tied down we need to let go we need to tell it go and we need to let god it's not time to get conforming to the world or get tied up with anything you know we need to let go and let's move towards god if something is bothering you it doesn't matter take that weight caster paul says leave everything behind and move forward make your things right with god and move forward don't let that stop you to reach your goal laid aside sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with passion the race that is set before me that takes discipline discipline ask any musicians that takes i know because i'm just kind of a partial musician kenny's a complete one i'm a partial i pick on kenny because he's my son-in-law so i cannot pick on you i don't know you will you might get mad at me and anyway the only thing he can do just send me back to tucson anyway i'm just trying to pick on him so he can send me two to son anyway you know i'm just a partial musician but it takes a lot of discipline to be a musician to be anything it takes discipline but i don't know how people put all the energy and effort into that and maybe to become something when we had to put the same effort and energy to become what we who we are and what we are to be it takes the same or even more effort to become me not this the me that is inside me okay now then desire creates devotion once you have a desire nobody can keep you away from church not even the devil and all his demons in hell can keep you from church see i want to finish because time is of the essence my goodness one o'clock okay let me read this it's kind of lengthy but let me i won't make no comments i just read through it uh revelation chapter five now revelation chapter um i mean a quote i want you to read it with me so i don't have to explain do i missed it on my notes or something yeah i do that a lot okay i start reading now notice it was it was a lamb redeemer and lamb redeemer just like the first god never can change listen if god had a thought about you then it's staying still the same thought today and forever now you and i like a brother from germany you know brother brennan had those seven mountains up and down you might have a change of mind about things and you might go into the valleys and sometimes you're going glory glory hallelujah sometimes well me and you know but you're going through all those changes but god never change he's still the same yesterday today and forever so when you go to your changes it's because god is working on you but god never changed he says amen the first redeemer was a lamb in the garden of eden it was the lamb that got offered and here it is again plum over the revelation it is again the lamb lamb there the lamb over here to redeem what the falling condition and the fallen inheritance not only me but my inheritance to redeem what it belongs to me it says of a fallen race of people islam comes back to redeem like our like ours was at the beginning so whatever i had at the beginning that i lost it because i fell the redeemer the lamb came to redeem all that for me anything that's redeemed is something that that's been lost okay thank you brother it is it is something that being lost and then it is being brought back again so you were here in his mind he had a picture of you he took a picture of the family and that picture has never changed when he comes over here will be the same picture it doesn't matter what happened here that is so he in his mind that is vision it says and redeem what he says anything that is redeemed is something that has fallen it's something that being lost and then it is being brought back again what does he bring back to us islam everything that we had at the beginning glory to god so you haven't lost anything yet and you won't lose anything yet satan don't put one on you listen here we go it's a vision what did we have at the beginning eternal life we were heirs of the world we had life we never had to die we never had to be sick we never had to get old thank god we never had to be worried there was no funerals no grave no evil not dead no gray hairs no two shoulders no morning no crying oh man i want to get there here we suffer and we fight a lot that's your vision that's who you are eternal with the eternal it says walk about it says we had life eternal i must keep this one here 94 and now nature itself is groaning it's growing waiting for what for the manifestations of the sons of god for the sons of god to be one manifested and we have to earnest and we have the earnest of our salvation now and can take a brother that is dying with cancer now listen now so this is what gets a little bit grace for some people listen when we get there we are completely changed i'm not need no healing but do i need heal i'm complete i'm not going to need to die i don't what do i need there nothing i'm done but that don't mean that you don't need that now so what he's saying is you don't have to wait there to start practicing what you already are you say it's a brother with cancer he says and stand by that little breath of redemption and pray the prayers of faith over him and that's what the brother was preaching prayer he says prayer of faith over him that turns a shadow of a man back to what to a healthy man again what will we do when our full possession comes partially partially we can do what we supposed to do there here you know i'm i need it right now i need it right now people are depressed people are sick afflicted people are dying i don't need it there i need it right now um because the fact that it's mine and i'm walking towards is to shine as i get closer and closer those things should be happening in the congregation you know why because it's not going to be a show any longer but i say it's not going to be a show so the things that are happening day and day and day and day and there and that's why you need to testify because i don't know what's going on there until you tell me see because sometimes you come to church and you come to church why nothing is happening in church this is more than the nomination but that show to get money to build a kingdom but here because we are sons and daughters of god and we humble we don't like to let the left know what the right is doing and we don't want to give no glory to anybody but him we kind of like to keep it to ourselves like mary she kept a lot of things but you know in her but because it's not going to be a show things are happening that show that the presence of god is here but you need to testify to the rest of it so we know that god is a work and his presence is in this place he says and pray the prayer of faith over him and that shadow of man back to a healthy man again what will we do when our full possession comes but i don't want to get to my full position to pray for myself i don't need it i need it right now and if you are that close you should be shining now nature knows that nature's growing groaning and we are groaning with it nature is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god that that you are there you still hear the same partially so you are now that's what the bible said you are now the sons of god not that you are going to be you are now and all that is in you partially and one of these days is gonna bloom completely and the closer you get the better it gets it says because we're gonna see the presence of god so strong in our churches but it's not going to be a show the national file he says because the nature was cursed with his master when his master was cursed the nature of the nature fell with the master i like it says but when the kingsman even came hallelujah and reading back the man that the master you're not talking about christ or god the master he says over the nature then all nature is waiting for the main master what do we do it says in case you missed it you are the master when i was feeling you are the master of your choices satan is not the master of you it's not the boss of you but you got to be proven that you are the master of this earth god is the master of heavens on earth but you was put here to show god you see rabbi says the only place that people want to see god today is where in you in you in you see they're looking for god and you got it see and we need to manifest god it says what do we do then we take the axe and sleep our hands chop the tree down if we want to if we want to but that day we won't do that she's talking about abraham and her leader brian when he was in the garden she said i don't like that tree there adam can you move it here and he just poked it and we went so we don't have to do that anymore not there i need it here i need to speak you know let it be the will in heaven let it be done in earth god knows the will in heaven is complete we know what he wants he knows what he has calling us he knows you know the purpose you have been called but you have to voice it in this side of time he already is completed in heaven but then he needs someone to believe it and give it a voice so when you want something just voice his will that's all that's easy spoken word we do that okay all nature is waiting for the master see and the master is the sons of god here we go that was given this earth you are in control of this earth not satan i mean they got their own team going but that's 13 that's not my thing but see i got a leader world you know bravo says you have enough faith you can create a world and go on what believing it well i don't think we need to do that but what he's trying to illustrate is that you can create your own atmosphere around you your own world so anybody come in contact with your atmosphere huh you change see you create your own atmosphere brother brandon got in the house and meet on them and the kids were running and kicking them you know how it is your mother's and you're almost loosing it and then he comes in and first thing he do he gets next to her and they start doing dishes and how was your day and and he tried to change her mind you know because if she stayed in that mind you cannot change the mind has to change so she brings it from all that situation and start talking to her so she can kind of you know don't focus on that and after a while the atmosphere changes the whole thing changes why that is you you are the master of your own little world and you can change it anytime you want to you don't like the way somebody's doing something don't go and change them that won't work you're not here to change me and i'm not going to change you but if i change my arm of fear i might be able for you to walk in it when the work is finished we all we have all things again praise the lord we we restore redeem restore and complete that's the vision but i don't have to wait there to believe that i already believe that i have all things in jesus christ we have all things again what kind of a thing we have power we have eternal life we have eternal health we have eternal youth we have eternal power all all we just eternal with eternal we are coming to be eternal walking into the eternal with eternal life it says we are waiting for that time to come waiting and groaning i got one more call but i must stop here you can stand for me please musician you can come to again a vision a vision is necessary and i hope that this morning if you had one that i refreshed the vision for you the reason i feel so good when i come here because my vision is your past your vision where you think we can get along now i didn't say i agree with everything he do and he don't agree with everything i do i've been married to my wife for some years and i still don't agree with some things so how can you explain me to agree with him in all things that's not what i said i said we have the same vision we had the same vision of the spanish translation that's why we can come together and do what we do because we have a vision and we can come into that vision and you we can unite in that vision but it has to come from god and you know it comes from god when you can unite and get the work done amen a vision and if you never had a vision it's a good time to get one it is time if you never thought about it the way i brought it to you it is time to get focused to get a vision of who you are what you are what you are to be and start working towards that and like i said once you do that the rest is easy discipline yourself there will be frustrations that will be up and down but you won't give up you get up and you continue towards the vision and god will then give you the desire because you cannot make yourself dishearten anything you know that you know that you cannot even make sir desperate if god don't make you desperate you stay there so once you prove that you want to discipline this is what i want to do lord that's mary said be unto me that is it be unto me and i'm gonna do whatever i can you know physically to get there so help me lord so he will give you a desire an option to keep moving and then when you keep moving you start getting you create a devotion for god you know what i mean i don't have to beg for you to come to church and worship god you want to worship god you know that brother brown said one of these days the stores people will be making the line i haven't seen that yet so he has to come in line that is so much devotion that people will line up in the door waiting for the deacon to open the deacon is late anyway sometimes i haven't seen lines in the door have you no maybe we need more devotion maybe we need let god create more desire strong desire for the things of god and then you can become very very emerge devotion you come to church and now you want to be a church the only reason you're here is because you love god i cannot make you come to church i cannot force you i cannot push you if you don't love god that's all it is to it but a devotion for god creates a love such a great love that you want to be where he's at hallelujah let us pray father i love you and i thank you for give me the strength the strength father and to finish what you have put in my heart to deliver to the people father we sometimes with this uh word sometimes cut off chop chop he and their father but i will i will pray that you let the holy spirit today speak to their hearts because you know what is what has the need of and i know you will supply that need this morning [Music] we have many people here father i don't know their hearts and i don't know what they need and what they want but you do i just made myself available to you this morning like it's an instrument so you can play it and you can then further satisfy the need of your people and father we i know and i trust you that you have done that but now i just pray father that give us up give us a clear a clear vision for the not only for us a clear vision for the church a clear vision for the body but so we can just as brother brennan saw that that that bridal review that the division i was there in that vision and now i'm going to walk into that vision i will be there father marching in one step in one accord in one mind it has to happen we got too many great and extremely prophecies and words that god had come to pass this message has to do what he promised to do or i will be disappointed but i'm not gonna you will never disappoint me you will do exactly what you promised me you will do with me father and i'm just here and heal myself to you i surrender to you father let it be be unto me in the name of our precious lord jesus christ amen amen
