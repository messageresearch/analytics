========================================

romans chapter 6 we're going to read one verse in verse 14. for sin shall not have dominion over you for you are not under the law but under grace amen and we'll read one more before we're seated john chapter 8 and we'll read from verse 36 give you a moment to find it if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed let's bow our heads abba father lord we know you're in this place father you are here father lord and you are mighty to save you are mighty to set free father oh god and we just ask that you would bless your word to our hearts this evening father and in the name of jesus i take authority over every hindering spirit every oppressive spirit every spirit of division every spirit of confusion every spirit of pain now bind and cast it down and cast it out in the name of jesus father let your word go forth in power to set captives free today we ask this in the name of jesus and for your glory amen amen you can be seated praise god still getting used to these we don't have lights and um like this at our current church though i think we'll be having having some but it's if you're on stage if it get you get used to like looking looking lower so you can see people all right well praise god so talking about overcoming sin now let's let me read before we get into the the topic let's let's look at first john 5 and 4. for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith and we learned from this that a big part of overcoming is faith and this is something that i've uh started uh find myself doing more and more when uh we preach at the local church but hebrews 4 tells us that the word preached did not profit certain ones because it was not mixed with faith and you know sometimes we can get in a in a service and we're kind of like well we'll see if that that minister can say anything to me and we'll see if he knows how to reach me and we'll see if he can if he can preach and explain things and we can we can we can look at people and think well they don't know anything about me and how could they say something that would help me but when we come to when we come to service we always need to remind ourselves it doesn't matter who's which man is speaking what matters is the god who has spoken and who is still speaking because it's it's god's word that changes lives right and so um any minister of the gospel his words and himself are going to have no authority but it's it's the word of god that has authority and what we what we know is that we could hear the word of god for two hours we could hear for three hours we could hear it for four hours we could hear it for five hours but if it's not mixed with faith it won't do us any good right it won't it won't profit us and so instead of waiting to the end of the service for our faith to get built up in the minister to to work us up it helps us if we start at the beginning of the service and we decide that what god says i'm going to believe i'm going to believe what god says i'm i'm going to believe because the word when it's mixed with faith changes lives it subdues kingdoms it slays giants it brings the dead back to life it heals the sick the word of god changes things the word of god is is powerful the word of god discerns and one of the things when i was thinking back as a young person i remember coming to church and i remember sometimes sitting there at church thinking oh i hope they don't preach on this and anybody want to know why i was thinking i hope they don't preach on this because this was an area where i wasn't overcoming in in my life and i remember i see brother brother kenny back there but i remember we used to go to retreats and we we were we were at a at a retreat in howell michigan there's a brother it was also something brother paul would would put on and uh most of you know brother berry coffee and he was doing a session with the young man and with the young men and he picked up uh certain issues that are a real struggle for young men and i remember talking to brother kenny afterwards and and when when brother barry started tackling this issue and everybody's kind of sitting there it's like is he going to go there is he going to go there and he and he just he just hit it head on and brother kenny told me later he goes he said it was kind of like when he hit it it was almost like everybody just sighed and just like oh you know you get it get it out in the open and you know that who wants you to be in bondage the devil wants you to be in bondage the devil wants you to be miserable he wants you to be in pain he wants you to suffer day after day after day but jesus wants you to be free and he doesn't want you to be free tomorrow he wants you to be free tonight and it doesn't matter what you're going through it doesn't matter what you're done god wants you to be free tonight and i was i was a young man i still think of myself as a young man and i'll tell you when we talk about the topic of victory over sin the the the bible teaches us in first john that if we say we have no sin that we deceive ourself right we deceive ourselves so there's there's none of us that this this topic of victory over sin is not relevant to and i find i'll study it out and god will gotta give me victory but what happens is you have to renew your mind in the word of god because if you don't renew your mind in the word of god what what hardens your heart the deceitfulness of sin the trickery of of the devil and so by the grace of god uh this evening we would like to renew our minds in the word of god and i want to as we so we're talking we're talking about uh faith a bit before we get into it and when when we when we talk about faith we know the word doesn't profit us if it's not mixed with faith and so um every uh believer should be making a decision you know at the beginning when we read the word when we come into our devotions but especially when we come into a service in the words being preached under the anointing i what god says i will believe and i will i will confess it and i will i will do it and we're we're gonna and and so what does it mean to mix the word with faith we're gonna we're gonna look at that a little bit what faith is and what faith isn't so there's there's uh there's there's lots of scriptures on faith in the bible but there's a few specific ones that define exactly what faith is and i find it helpful to renew my mind continually these scriptures because what the culture tells us faith is is not faith it's not faith at all do you know that the bible teaches you that faith is evidence yes faith is evidence amen so we're going to look at look at a couple of these uh hebrews 11 and 1 we'll get into this now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen in other words how do we receive things from god we receive them by faith you receive them by faith and and so you can receive something from god right now you can receive something from god tonight and somebody might look at you and say you don't have that you're crazy where's the evidence you want to know where the evidence is it's your faith the word of god is the promise you believe it and you confess it and you receive it right there right your faith is the evidence and so it's it's not seen sometimes people pray for healing and they say well i wasn't healed why weren't you healed well i don't feel it i don't see it right but do you do you realize the bible teaches that god's word is settled in heaven first right it's settled in heaven first and then it manifests in in our life so faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen right so in other words if you see it there's no faith involved now think about that for a minute because a lot of times the devil will attack you and it'll be like i don't see that and i'm like that's right where's the proof faith faith is the proof right faith is the proof so that's it um now uh hebrews 11 6 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him what do we learn from this faith is not optional right right how what does the bible say how shall the just live somebody help me out by faith right that's that's how we live that's how we walk so our walk is not in the scene our walk is in the unseen now just take take a minute think of um we don't want to spend a lot of time on it but think think of think of some of the attacks that the devil attacked you last week and maybe today maybe this morning most of the stuff he's tackling you is he's pointing out things that are seen he's like this happened this happened that means this that means this that means this that means this where's he attacking you not in the realm of faith right not in the realm of faith and so if if we want to get out of these attacks we have to learn to live in the realm of faith right and uh romans 10 17 this is the last one uh before we get we get into this um now this this is this is simple stuff even if we're 10 and under we should not be confused by this so if i say my hand is up in the air how much faith do you need to see that my hand is up in the air 10 and under how much none who said none oh right now now if i told you to close your eyes and i said i'm not gonna lie to you i'm putting my hand up in the air okay right now if you trusted me you would know that my hand is up in the air why because i told you that right right so you don't you don't see it but but you see the minute you see something you're no longer operating in faith and so you it but it helps us understand when when we're coming to god a lot of times that the devil's antagonist is you don't see it you don't feel it and so what the the bible teaches us to have victory over um the the victory that overcomes the world is is our faith and so we will find as we as we study the word if we want victory over sin we have to learn to overcome sin with faith romans 10 and 17 so this is this is another one that defines how faith operates and this was this was talking about uh salvation and it says so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god amen and so when we when we come when when we come into uh a service and this is any service not just a youth service but we we want to come and we will come and get in an atmosphere of faith because it's in that atmosphere where we will receive from god the things that we receive from god are through faith and it reveals them to us by his spirit in first corinthians two it says now we have not received the spirit of the world but we've received the spirit of god for what reason that we would know the things that are freely given to us of god and so as as we look at these things tonight we're going to see that they're in the realm of faith now i want to i want to look at just a couple more things this is this is in romans 12. when i was a when i was a young person and i'm still a young person but i'll say when i was a younger person and i can't speak to the um to the the the young women on this particular issue but uh for for the for for the for the young men um and i don't have to say too many details but you young men know what i'm talking about whether you're single or whether whether you're married but there's there's a battle in in in the world of of of temptation and it's it's temptation and and lust and and now now i mean it's it attacks women too i'm not gonna not gonna um leave the the women out but the attack in the world is is so intense on the young men young men can often get discouraged saying god why did you put us here why did you why did you why did you make me like this and and they can they can begin to feel that that there's no hope that i'll i'll i'll never overcome and and and uh young men uh sitting there like oh is he gonna go there is he going to is he going to talk about that you know what when when we come to god you got to know that god wants you to be free when we're when we're talking about victory over sin i don't care if you're 99 if you're over a hundred or if if you're five years old just barely enough to hear what i'm saying god wants you to be free and he paid a great price for you to be free and he doesn't want you to go around getting beat up day after day after day he paid the price so you could be free and the bible says whom the son has set free is free indeed in other words it's not a sham when you're bought out of slavery you're set free where you can walk where you can hold your head up high and a lot of times sons of god get so beat down where they where they can't hold their head up because they're saying oh i'm guilty i'm guilty i'm guilty and guess what the devil's standing over the whole time whipping him and says oh yes you are oh yes you are oh yes you are you're so guilty you're so guilty and everybody there if they knew what you were doing they'd kick you out of this church but we serve a god who paid a price for that and i want to i want to um talk to you about that this this this morning or this evening rather but i remember coming to um youth meetings and maybe i can just um speak to the younger ones a little while when i first got saved this was how my my reasoning worked i um i said oh i want to ask jesus in my my heart and the bible when we get saved it doesn't really talk about asking jesus in our heart but sometimes that's all we know so like okay jesus i want you to come in my heart and then and forgive me of my sins and i i had heard preachers preach and i had listened to children's bible hour and i said okay what do i do to get saved i said okay you know you you do this you say i'm sorry for my sins and raise your hand and you come to the altar call and in my mind this is how i thought as a young child said when i got saved jesus forgave every sin that i had done up until that point but then everything after that i had to somehow you know i i was i was had to go go make it right and so i got a little bit older and i would say like oh i i was mean to this person i did this and this and you go you start going apologizing to everybody i'm sorry i did that and what he found is the mountain of sins were stacking up higher then then i could then i could make them right and so i started feeling feeling uh discouraged and then later i i heard i heard teaching on on the holy spirit i said oh that's what i need that's what i need i need the holy spirit and so i was praying and um and and and i sought the lord went went to camp meetings had brothers pray over me and i came to the point where i said i i have the assurance of the holy spirit i have the holy spirit um and we we understand when we when we get the holy spirit now now we have power and we should just want to do right but what i found out was sometimes i'd get tempted to sin and sometimes i would give into that temptation to sin and then i'd wonder did i really have the holy spirit i thought i had the holy spirit and and then i was kind of like you know you ask somebody like what happened oh when you have and some people say oh when you have the holy spirit you know you're you're full of joy and and it was just kind of like life was going to be easy and the holy spirit was going to control you how many knows god doesn't want robots god doesn't want god doesn't want robots but in in my in my um childlike mind it was so frustrating fighting against sin then i thought i'd rather be a robot god god just just control me and i'll do what you say and i mean i wasn't formulating like that i'm looking back and saying that that was what i was kind of thinking and sometimes people are praying you know god i can't do this just just do it for me well you know uh brother branham said uh something uh this this was something that that helped me as as a young man this is from the the marriage of of the lamb but he was talking about overcoming and and we we read in in um you know all through the scriptures about overcoming especially when we get to revelation to the church ages every everyone has to overcome and you're saying well well how how do i overcome you like will you get filled with the spirit you know your heart changes and and if you're predestinating you know that that that seed in you will will overcome and then you're kind of like okay well then what do i do and brother branham actually talks about this in the um in the the marriage of the lamb he says so many says if the lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking or from gambling or from lying or stealing i'll serve him but that's up to you see you've got to do something too they that overcome shall inherit all things they that overcome you have the power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down see she has made herself ready i like that word now this was the one that really this i've replayed this one over and over in my mind over years listen to this he said he said you see god could not push us through a little pipe and pull us out the other end and say blessed is he that overcome and and and some of us it's like that's what we're praying for we're like god just just push me through the pipe but i'll come out the other end praise in your name and it's like oh you know god let me die in my sleep and wake up in heaven but you know we gotta you know we we there's something if the glory of god and the power of god is manifested it at least ought to be able to undo what the devil did right and that's what it says in first john chapter four it talks about why the son of god was manifested and you you might you might know this well we won't look up all the scriptures because it's gonna take too long so i'll just tell it to you but you can look it up later it's in first john chapter 4 and it says two reasons why the son of god was manifested who's the son of god the son of god of course is jesus and john chapter 1 tells us in the beginning he was the word right right and he was with god and he was god but what did he do the word became flesh so the son of god was manifested as son of man in other words he became one of us now he did this but you say why did he do this why did he do this first john chapter 4 tells us he did this to take away our sin and to destroy the works of the devil and i tell you tonight in the name of the lord jesus was manifested to take away your sins and destroy the works of the devil in other words he wasn't just to forgive you but he was to undo the the full effect of all the damage that the devil did you know he's he said in the old testament that all that the palmer worm had eaten all did the canker the woman he would restore every bit of it and we serve a god that can restore that can undo the power of evil and so it doesn't matter how broken we feel tonight it doesn't mean matter how broken even we we are tonight sometimes we feel broken and the devils just just tricked us sometimes we truly are broken but it doesn't matter whether the devil's trying to deceive you or you're actually in really bad shape god is all-powerful and he did something big to reverse the curse amen and so so we're um and so the um brother branham taught us that when he reversed the curse it wasn't that he was just putting this this um this force in you that you go okay holy spirit okay and and you just do that but sometimes we we think that because we all would be so much easier if god just did it all but he wanted sons he didn't want robots and he didn't want slaves how many knows he wasn't sown a son to bring forth a fruit of servants a son was sown to bring forth a fruit of sons and what do sons do sons know how to make decisions they know how to choose good over evil so when god wants to give you victory over sin i don't care how young you are i don't care how old you are that that those those habits that you're fighting those those spirits that you're fighting god has victory and power over that amen amen and it's it's through his word amen and so so we were looking at at faith a bit and i'd like to um i'm gonna i'm gonna read one one more uh quote here because you know um we talked about what faith is not and i've found it helpful in the christian walk to remind yourself often what faith is not because when you're getting attacked you'll you'll see a lot of times the devil all he's doing is pointing out circumstances he's just pointing at but how how do we overcome we overcome by the word of god and so we have to learn to see what the word of god says to believe what the word of god says over what the circumstance say and brother branham said here this is in faith as a substance this is in 47 he said faith is the only direct positive sense it's the sixth sense it's more than sight it's more than feeling now listen to this you do not feel faith you do not taste faith you don't smell faith you don't see faith faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen so um how many has ever been bothered when you don't feel your faith we all have like i don't feel my faith today you know i get up maybe um no so i'm a preacher i get up i don't feel like preaching today no by the time i get to the pulpit i always feel like preaching but but but sometimes i wake up in the morning i don't feel like preaching you know we got we got uh song leaders we you know every every part of the body is important whether it's whether you're sitting in the pews or or you're up on the platform every part of the body is is is important but sometimes we just don't feel like doing that and do you know what you don't have to worry about that sometimes we get so worried about like oh i don't feel like i'm a christian today well it doesn't matter because you're not a christian by feeling right and if if you if when you learn that simple thing to cast down those feelings because your feelings you know what your feelings go up and down they go side to side they go back and forth and and one day you'll feel saved one day you'll feel forgiven and but what you'll find is is if you go to the word if you stir up that gift of the holy ghost in you you will feel your faith but feelings follow they don't lead and a lot of times we find our the devil can get us so tripped up responding to our feelings and i know as a young person that was that was a big um big hangout for me i'm kind of getting it ahead of myself i want to say a few more things about faith before before we get into it but this this is about how faith operates and let this sink into your spirit romans 12 and 1. um the apostle paul says i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service some translations read a spiritual worship your reasonable service verse 2 listen to this and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god so let's let's break that down uh what what this what this uh means he says be not conformed to this world you know what conformed means has anyone um do we have any artists here anybody art into art one is that it okay who's who's ever cast a mold before anybody ever cast cast a a mold brother matt's an engineer he can tell you about different molding processes but there's certain molding processes where what they do is is they will actually press on something and form it into into an image and what this is talking about saying this is what happens this is what the world does to you okay so so you're you're walking out in the world and the world is is pushing on you and it's it's like a mole that's saying it would look at brother paul and say you know you're a 55 year old man and you should be like this and he's going to feel about pressure from from from society from people that you meet and it is pressing on you you should be like this and you look at look at brother brandon and say you should be like this and brother bryn you should be like this and it'll look at it you know i don't know you my brother and sister but you know you're young you're a young family and this is what you should be doing and this is how you should be spending your time and it presses on you day after day and what what it's it's like it's like a mold where it's pushing you and you're kind of feeling oh maybe i should be like that maybe i should do this and you're kind of getting all all contorted up but the bible says don't be like that and say okay i'm not supposed to be like that well what do i do it says biggie transform now this this word transform it's used three times in uh in the in the in the bible it's actually actually four but but two of the instances in the gospel refer to the same place but if you can understand what what what what this is it'll really help you in in applying the word to your life now how many um let's see do we got anybody that's taking biology right now life sciences biology life sciences anybody raise it high all right can you tell me all right we got two what's your name sister lydia all right and abigail my niece okay so just uh we'll start with with uh sister lydia do you know what it's called when a caterpillar turns into a butterfly do you remember that okay abigail do you know metamorphosis has anybody ever heard the word metamorphosis okay metamorphosis so how many knows what what uh what a uh caterpillar looks like it looks like a worm right a worm with legs and some people like them and some people don't like them but they they crawl around and then that's that's what they look like now do you when when they turn to a butterfly do they look anything like um like the caterpillar like you like what what's that you know you you you put you put it in a in in a box or whatever you you come back later you're like where's my caterpillar this is butterfly butterfly uh flying around metamorphosis and that comes from a greek root um we're not going to do a greek class even if i could but i'll just tell you what this um metamorphosis it comes from a greek root metamorpho and it means to change from one form into another and this so this is what romans 12 1 tells me it says the world is going to push on you and many of us are being pressed you're being you're being pressed by things that are coming from the media you're becoming pressed from things that are coming from your your peers but god doesn't change you by pressing you he changes you by renewing your mind and he'll actually change you from one form and to another and you know how he says he changes us by renewing our mind do you know what that is it's god says something to you in his word and you believe what he said in his word and when you believe it and you confess it you will literally change from one form and to another and it will happen right now in this service why because that's what the power of god does that's what the power of god does and if you recognize that at the beginning of the service as the word is coming forth god's going to speak to your heart he's going to hit your situation he knows right where each of you are i could look at you and guess where you are but god knows where you are and he's going to speak to your heart and he's going to tell you something and what he wants the believer to do is not be pressed by this thing saying this is what you're not you may say god's word says that i can't see how it could be i can't feel how good it be it doesn't matter because that's not where the evidence is the evidence is in faith what does faith do faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of god and what do we do it says the bible says for with the heart the mouth believeth we didn't continue in romans 10 and with the mouth confession is made unto what salvation salvation how shall they believe except they hear how shall they hear except somebody preached the word to them that's what it says in romans 10 we don't have time to to go you know read all through it tonight but you can look it up later that's what the word of god says he says i will send you my word the bible says he sent his word and healed them and so it doesn't matter if you can't figure out how you can make it out of your situation how you can get victory over sin god will give you victory over sin by transforming you by the word of god right and so you want to know where the other two places are that that's used in the bible and there's metamorphosis three times in the whole bible three times so one time he's saying don't get pressed so we all are getting press but he says don't respond to that this is how i want to change you i want to change you by speaking my word over you i want to change you by speaking my word over you you know you say how could it be all right think about this you remember when moses was in the wilderness and and they had sinned what did god tell him to do he said make a brass serpent and put it on a pole now they they weren't just sick um i mean what they had was worse than kovit for covid most people recover this sickness if you got bit you are going to die so there's one thing that you could do you had to go look at a snake on a pole or somebody explain that to me i know you're in bad shape but you just go look at this snake on a pole you'll be fine trust me say what go look at a snake on a pole why could looking at a snake on a pole make you whole because god said it would make you whole and what god says he can do think about this you know how the word of god operates when god says something it happens what do you think happened when god said let there be light you think the sun was like oh let me see if i'll shine oh i don't know if i should shine and there's some people oh you won't shine but god said let there be light boom the sun was shining why it had to shine because he commanded it to shine do you realize that's the same way god speaks over your life he commandeth the word to shine on your heart out of darkness and then you're changed you're changed and this is the other when we're getting right into what the other metamorphosis is second corinthians 3 and he's talking about the word talking about when we when we read the word what happens and it talked about how the people who weren't who weren't changed they read the moses's law with a veil on their heart and picking up at the end we'll pick it at verse 17 it says now the spirit of now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty let me tell you the spirit of the lord is in this place and it doesn't matter if you don't feel the spirit the lord the spirit of the lord is here and if you'll believe it you will feel it you know what jesus said to martha before he raised lazarus he said didn't i tell you if you would believe you would see the glory of god if you would believe she had to believe first and then she would see it and what's god's what is god trying to get you to do at this part of the service he's trying to get you to make a decision that what he speaks over your life you will believe it and just like when he commanded the sun to shine your situation will change it will come into line with the word of god when when you believe the word of god and when you confess the word of god amen it changes you and so the spirit of the lord is there's liberty but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord how do we behold the glory of the lord we know we we we see him as he's revealed in his word right and and what do we see we see what was he was the firstborn among many brethren in other words he was making us like him but he says when you look at that when you look at him in the word you will be changed from one degree of glory to the other when is that to happen you're not supposed to go home and think about the service so it's good to think about the service but god wants to change you right now he wants to change you right now as he speaks to your situation what does he want you to do he wants to do what mary did it was pretty simple angel comes radical message you know you think so i mean some angels delivered some radical messages it's hard to imagine what could have been going through mary's mind when gabriel shows up and tells her uh you know she's she's gonna bear a son and no they didn't you can tell they i mean we look back and like oh she was she was gonna bear god in the flesh mary didn't really understand that because if she understood that she wouldn't ask him some of the questions that she asked him later on it was it was it was unfolding even the disciples didn't see that otherwise they would have been hanging their head on the road to emmaus and the lord saying you know you fool slow heart not to believe all that the prophets have spoken right but but he but at the same time even if she didn't know that that it was going to be god in the flesh it was still a radical message because the the whole hope of the jewish nation was that one of the women would bear the seed that would crush the head of the serpent one of one of them had had to do it and and the and the the jews learned at some point they said okay it's going to come through abraham then they learned it was going to come through david right they knew it was going to come through david even the scribes knew in herod's time that that he was to be born in bethlehem they they knew a lot about it but when he showed up they missed him by a million miles but but what what what did mary have to do he comes and says this radical message that you're going to conceive a child and she goes how's it going to happen i didn't i didn't have relations with a man he says well the holy spirit's going to overshadow you and she didn't go that didn't make any sense what she said be it unto me according to my word and what happened it began to that she she she was then then the word was was born in her and that's the same thing god wants you to do every one of us has that same responsibility you say how does faith operate it's very simple when you hear the word you believe in your heart and then you say amen to it and sometimes sometimes as young people like i'm too young to say amen you know that's that's that's the that's the the older people's job they got to say amen well guess what the bible says with the heart the mouth the with the heart the man believeth but with the mouth confession is made unto salvation so i don't care how young you are or how old you are when god gives you his word he expects you to believe in your heart and then to say you don't have to jump up like you know uh sometimes i see a brother andrew and he can he can get i remember at retreat there's there's a brother maybe he was named josh or something they would be up at the top and they're just kind of like these little things bobbing up and down they're shouting shout amen helping the you know you don't you don't have to do that that's that's all right everybody's got a way of expressing it but you you actually have to open your mouth and you say that's right that's right god wants you to do that because he says you believe with your heart you know he'll be like oh you know world that's a christianity is a private matter no no it's not if that spirit's in you it will manifest it will manifest but a lot of times people people you know god wants to set you free and when the people were getting free from the snake bites they had to go look at the at the serpent why because that's what god said do you realize that god moves things by his word that's how he does it that's the way god operates that's the way he always operated when he was creating he said let there be boom it was let there be boom it was how did he create sons of god by his word and how does he how does he change them from glory to glory by his word and when you understand that right then then you say so i'm not to be conformed but i'm to be transformed right so it starts by believing the word you have to hear the word first so that's my job i don't know how far how far it will get but we just trust the lord that he'll say what he what he wants i i usually have like this pile of notes that we get on some some some a little bit but if you can understand that as a as as as a young person that's how god wants to change your life he wants to tell you something about you in the word he's going to tell you something about you in the word and you're not going to see it you're going to look like yeah that sounds crazy i don't see how that could be because my problems are too hard i've been i've been going through this for too long i've been hurt you don't know what i did you know all of these things but god's word it transforms he doesn't need to bend you into shape he doesn't need to bandage you up he transforms you by his own creative power do you know when god speaks it it has to happen it has to happen because he has all power so he gets done what he wants but the way he does it in the life of believers is by his word so listen the two so we got two places where where people turn or from caterpillars to butterflies you think about now you can think about when you're coming into service back i want to turn to a butterfly again maybe if you're changed from glory to go i don't know what you turn into after a butterfly but but as as as believers as as as sons and daughters of god we are to be continually transformed so so um yes we should meditate on the word after it's been preached but you can be transformed right now you can be set free right now by the word of god why because he spoke it amen okay so so one was be not conformed to this world but be uh transformed by the renewing of your mind that's that's a transformation you will change from one form to another in other words you won't leave the same way you came you've heard that before right you won't leave the same way you came but did you think about how radical it was that you might walk out and people like whoa what happened to you you're like what god spoke over me and i believed it and it can happen to you too it can happen to you too when you believe in the power of god you realize that everything that god does in the life of a believer is by faith the just shall live how by faith is if you want to please god it's actually impossible to please him without faith faith is not optional it's the way of the believer it's the way that we live right that's the way that we will relate to god is is through faith in his word amen and so so one transformation romans 12 another transformation second corinthians three all right are you ready for the third one does anybody know what it is do i know what it is some so some of my home group i'm sure they know what it is we've done this a few times all right jesus is going up to a mountain he takes takes two people with him or three people what is it peter james and john yeah three people with him he takes three people with him he gets up to the mountain and then he changes he's transfigured he changes from one form to another now what happened sometimes we think on the mountain he was like oh maybe a halo came over his head what happened on the mountain was so radical and that you want to know what the disciples said when they got down on the mountain they're like why hasn't elijah showed up yet that's right that's what they said in other words when they saw jesus transformed they go why did why did the scribes say that elias must first come and the what what they when they saw jesus transform shining like that like one minute he was a man and the next minute he's in his glorified body and we hear the voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son and whom i well please he was changed from one form to another that's the three places in the bible that metamorpho is used so you think about you think about what god wants to do over your life right now god wants to change your life amen amen and so it's as simple as hearing the word of god knowing that it applies to yourself your situation and saying yes yes i believe that you say but i don't see how that could be well this is how faith works as we get into this a little bit okay romans 4 talks about how how faith works and i'm going to paraphrase because it's going to it it'll take too long to get through all the scriptures but roman four talks about how abe it's talking about how abraham was justified by faith and it talks about how he got a son everybody remember the story of abraham so god um abraham married a wife and she was a very beautiful woman apparently but she had a one flaw or something does anybody remember what that was she couldn't have kids right she could she couldn't have kids now look at what god does he goes i'm going to raise up a great nation out of these two people that can't have kids do you realize what god does and how is he going to do it by his word that's how he's going to do it by his word do and and so so what did abraham have to do so this this is what this is what um romans 4 teaches us it said he was strong in faith giving glory to god okay so um maybe we'll go there we'll we'll we'll read it i take it back sorry romans 4. again i love this portion i got a song about that one too but we'll do that another time okay let's just read romans 4 16 that it is a faith that it might be grace to the end that the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all so it it's it's showing abraham he was he was a father of the jewish nation but he's also a father of us in faith and it was it was he's showing us that the way he operated when we think about faith this is the way the way we're we're to operate now now you're gonna in in both of these situations there's there's a promised child that comes and sometimes god will do it like like like with mary where she just says yes and boom it's happening right then but sometimes god is speaking some things and they don't happen right away and you know what that's called it's called the trial of your faith right your faith is tested right and so if um has has anybody ever um you know prayed for something and you don't see it and you're like well that must not have worked you know what that's called that's called the prayer of unbelief right because when we when we pray and we believe what god said then we don't need to see it he wants us to keep believing and so this is what happened to abraham god says abraham come out of your nation and i'm going um and and follow me and i'm gonna make a mighty nation of you like okay god and he and he leaves and you know he's he's going around and god promises him he's gonna have a son you know he sees these these visions and look at the stars that's how your how many kids are gonna have look at the can you number the the sand and the seashore that's how many kids you're gonna have and he's like all right and um you know with um the he was husband and wife and they they were they were doing what they they needed to do to um produce children but wasn't any children coming and they're like maybe god meant another way now he didn't disbelieve god but he limited god and the bible actually tells us that god does exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think so when you hear that voice when god tells you something in his word and you hear that voice that says well maybe god meant this and it is some like weaker sorrier version of that believe me that's not what god meant because god does he always does better than what we think he does exceeding abundantly above what we ask your thinking it was the same with abraham but it got you know they they they had us a son through through hagar and god says no that's not what i meant and so um so he's like okay i'll keep believing and now abraham's old he's too old to conceive a child that sarah's too old to conceive a child and if there's any wonders like well maybe they weren't old enough the scripture leaves no doubt it says it was ceased to be with sarah after the matter of manner of women in other words it was physically impossible for her to bear a child and god says all right now it's time to see my power you know what he said when he showed up at the tent sarah laughs is anything too hard for the lord and that's what that's what you have to ask yourself because we're in situations that are hard for us but there's nothing too hard for the lord and what did abraham have to do this is this is what it this is what it says that it does it says who against who against hope um let's see before god whom he believed who quickeneth the dead means he makes the dead alive and calleth those things which be not as though they were who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be so look god said something to him he believes it right and now this is what he did it says and not being weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of sarah's room he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was also able to perform therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness now there's a lot there but let's just break it down what it is abra is saying every day abraham had to make a decision he got up and he said my body body's too old to have a son doesn't matter he looks at sarah sarah sarah um can't have children it's physically impossible it said he considered them not and so in other words when god tells you something there will be things staring you in your face when you get up when you turn this way when you turn that way that will say the opposite of what god told you and what does he say this is what abraham did he said nope why because there's a greater reality those are what are called facts but god's word is truth and truth is higher than facts truth will always overpower facts he is the way he is the truth he is the life and what he says comes to pass because he's able to do what he said that's what he told sarah sarah laughs she says it's impossible he says is anything too hard for god and god can set you free tonight from and i thought we were going to talk mainly about victory over sin i trust we'll get to it a little bit but it looks like most of the sermons on faith that's okay god because we gotta if we if we believe god will find our lives transformed we'll have we'll find our lives transformed but you have to recognize this is what you have to do if you want to have faith you have to learn to recognize that the thing you see has nothing to do with faith and so it's going to come to you the devil's going to bring it and do when you realize it has nothing to do with faith you'll find as as you walk in faith it actually gets easier to say that doesn't matter because he's attacking you in the area of sight right he's attacking you in the area of sight but there's a truth that's higher than that right and so abraham it was said he was strong in faith giving glory to god do you know what that means he was strong in faith giving glory to god it means he was confessing the word over him glory is associated with the tongue and and it means he was strong in faith giving glory to god he said god promised me a son god will give me a son and it will come through sarah and so what god says he's able to do amen amen so we're thinking about this as as we um we're just going to have a little bit of time uh to to get on this but so think you think you know we're thinking about faith and the bible teaches us that the word of god when he speaks it it changes things but it won't change things if it's not i mean it it won't change things in your life if it's not mixed with faith won't change it for the better i'll say that you know if god um but if you want to receive the promises of god we receive them through faith right and faith faith is the evidence in other words the proof that you have that god will do what he said is your faith so a lot of people say well that didn't happen if you believed god for it if you confessed it it's as good as if you have it and your faith is the proof your faith is the proof now think about this romans 6 this is what the word says about us and and this this is where i struggled a lot as a young person and so what would happen to me as as a young person i i i believe i was in in um in high school when the when the lord really started dealing with my life and i believe i was i was filled with the the holy spirit but i went off to to college and and facing a lot of the temptations um of of the world i had some some stumbles and here's how the devil will attack you when you stumble and i'm talking about born again people we'll we'll talk about unsaved people in in a minute but born again people what he will say to you is this if you had the holy ghost you would not have done that and he'll start he'll start bringing um bringing scripture to you and you and and he'll say he that is born of god cannot sin right you sinned he'll never quote to you the whole passage but he'll he'll um he'll come and and quote uh to you and and i'm like it would be one thing if somebody tricked you into doing that but you actually liked that you enjoyed it and you you you enjoy the sin and he's just starting to attack you and and condemn you and you're kind of like did i enjoy it i i i didn't want to do it but but i did it and i tried to confess and i try to repent maybe i don't have the holy ghost oh maybe i'll just better go back into sin and you go into this this cycle of of condemnation and repeating the bad habits the devil tells you you know why even try and then then one day one it's like one day maybe you'll come to a service and the holy spirit will move so powerfully that you won't even want to do that bad thing again sometimes that happens but actually the bible teaches us an overcoming sin that is actually the exception then than the rule even what brother branham was saying he said he said you say to god if you take this away from me if you take this away from me if you take this away from me i'll serve you he said you have to be willing to give it up so how does that work well let me say it this way i don't know the specific sin that you have that you struggle in your life some of them uh maybe different different sins that you struggle with but the only sins that you can overcome in your life are forgiven sins the only sins that you can overcome in your life are forgiven sin you know what do you mean by that well you have to understand what god does when he saves you what does god do when he saves you has anybody heard that word justification justification justification comes from the word just and what it means to be is it means to be lined up with something has anybody ever used a word processor using like microsoft word anybody ever use that or google docs or whatever anybody use that raise your hand if you use that okay there's these little um there's these little things on the word processors you can click it and it will line up everything to the right of your page or you can click the other one it'll line everything up to the left of that you know what that's called it's called left justified and right justified it means you're lined up with a standard okay now god does something when he saves you and it's called justification and so if justification means lined up what would it mean if god says you're justified well it means not that you're lined up with the right side of the page it means that you're lined up with his standard what's his standard it's his law right it's it's it's his law now what the bible teaches us that nobody could be justified by the deeds of the law right so ev the law was given to us and we're trying to do it we're trying to do it we're trying to fall and we keep falling short okay this um i've heard it said and there's a kind of strange way of saying it but if you think about it you can understand what how it works that um i think this is in scotland in the old days when people had done a terrible crime okay they did a terrible crime and the punishment of the crime what's her name on the end ethan all right say ethan killed somebody all right how old are you 17. so ethan he's a young 17 year old he's got all this wild 70 year old energy and he does something and then he gets in a rage and he kills somebody all right stand up ethan you want to be an example tonight can you help me out no all right somebody else help me out no what about you no all right you help me out all right jayden okay all right so uh so jaden um jaden went in a fit of rage and he killed somebody right what's what's the penalty for for uh for for killing somebody just broadly speaking death right penalty is death okay so jayden comes here okay and uh you know jaden jaden comes and then they say um you know do you have you have anything to to to say before the sentence is executed on you all right so if if if he was a little remorseful you go i just want to say i'm sorry to the family and everybody i heard and you say he was saying he's so sorry and they're like that's nice but the law has a requirement okay and so we would we would string him up this would be in scotland and then then he'd be hung and then he'd be dead and then he would put him down right and then now now um jaden is dead and now there will be a proclamation and so today is is may 16th and it would say on may 16th jayden was justified okay you can sit down right he's justified now okay now now you're now you're saying what in the world are you talking about he he um he killed somebody and he died and he was justified well what does it mean justified means you're lined up with the law okay so the the penalty for killing somebody was that he had to give his life so now he's at odds with the law but when he pays with his life now he's lined up with the law the law has no more requirements on him he is justified so if by some means he could come back to life guess what he'd be free to go because he already paid the penalty that's what justified means it means that there's no more requirements that the law has on you now what does the bible say in isaiah 54 we sing the song no weapon formed against me shall prosper and every tongue that rises against me in judgment i will condemn this is the heritage of the servants of the lord why he tells you the secret their righteousness is of me saith the lord in other words they are justified every requirement that the law has against them has been met okay in other words they are forgiven okay do you realize that when god wants you to overcome sin he does something for you first he justifies you he justifies you okay let's look at romans eight and and one and this this was the thing that i struggled with as a young person romans 8 1 says there is therefore now no condemnation to them who are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit and we we could we could read more but this this is what it says how many has ever felt condemned all right we've got lots of christians raising our hands here you've felt condemned and then you go to romans eight god there's no condemnation why do i feel condemned well sometimes from the context you can understand exactly what it's saying this one sometimes it's helpful if you um you can get online they have little greek dictionaries and they'll tell you the meaning behind this word but this this word condemnation the greek word we're not going to do a greek lesson but i'll just tell you this it's kataka and you know what it means it means damn to hell it means judgment is passed on you and so now what what is this saying this doesn't say you will never feel guilty it says once you are in christ jesus you will never ever ever ever ever ever ever be damned to hell in other words because sometimes you've heard it said what what what would you do in your life if you knew you couldn't fail and people talk about that for starting businesses do you realize that that's what god does with his children he starts out and he says he says when i save you this is what i'm going to do for you you don't have to worry you will never ever ever ever ever be damned to hell so what he does when we're justified when we when we put our faith in christ he says you're lined up with the law you know how can i be lined up with the law by just believing him well it's because he paid the debt he paid the debt how could he pay the debt you say how could jesus pay the debt the old testament law was an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth a life for a life you know they talked about a kinsmen redeemer if somebody killed one your family the goal he could go after and kill the person who killed them and that was so that justice would happen in the land wouldn't be polluted for blood god always wanted to execute justice he'd say well it was just one person that died so he should have been at best able to redeem one person so who got redeemed was it the thief at the cross it's like well how could he redeem everyone well the reason he could redeem everyone if if somebody could redeem everyone the worth of his life would have to be worth more than all of the lives put together right worth more than all of the lives put together and when jesus died his life was worth more than every life that was ever created every life that will be created why because the bible tells us that the builder has more honor than the building right my kids they make they make little um castles in the backyard i can kick it down but they can build another you can kick it down they can build another but if you killed them no more would be built what are we we are his workmanship what does it say john chapter 1 says there wasn't a single thing made that he didn't make every single one of you were made by jesus and so if if he died he paid the price for everything that he ever created it was paid in full and he says how does it get paid in full by you believing that it gets paid in full you believing and confessing it and so when we struggle with guilt when we say i'm not going to make it to heaven the bible tells us if you're justified filled with his spirit yes you will make it to heaven you will never be damned to hell why because god said so he said he wouldn't damn you to hell later in romans 8 it says who is it that condemns it's god that justifieth how's it going to be when you get up to the judge and he's the judge and he says i paid the debt well guess what you're going to go free right because he said you were going to go free he said you're going to go free so let's just look at a couple more things i know it's i know it's going a bit long but if you can understand what the word of god says about you it will set you free from that guilt of sin it will set you free from the power of sin so romans romans 6 6 says this knowing this that our old man is crucified with him has anybody ever tried to crucify your old man sometimes we do but what does the scripture say the scripture says this time about people are born again says your old man is crucified with him so do you think your old man is crucial do you think you should crucify your old man or you think your old man is already crucified well i think i would believe what the word of god says it says knowing this now what does he say he says that the body of sin might destroy be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is freed from sin now if we be dead with christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death hath no more dominion with him for in that he died he died unto sin once but in that they liveth he liveth unto god now verse 11 is what we want to get to likewise reckon ye also yourself to be dead unto sin but alive unto god through jesus christ our lord do we get any accountants in the building i know there's at least one is is there our accountant in here where is she we got another accountant another accountant okay reckon reckon in the king james it was the the king james english they weren't from the southern um southern us they didn't say well now you reckon god will do that you reckon uh that's that's not what reckon means in the king james sometimes you can use a different translation but it's actually an accounting term and it's an exacting term so your account your accountant brother boaz so what what do they call it when when when somebody's you know trying to trying to go through the numbers and there's some missing and they just they just kind of make it up and fill it in what's that they call it reconciliation but when they make it up they would call it fraud right or cooking the books right so what you have to recognize when when you when you uh when you balance your checkbook when you when you do accounting you you can only mark it off if it is exactly there you can't say well i hope we'll get funds here so let me count these so this is what god through the holy spirit is telling the believer to do he's saying wrecking yourself dead to sin he's he's not saying act like you're dead to sin and pretend that you're dead to sin and dream up that you're dead to sin he's saying god already did this when you were born again you are dead to sin now believe that it's done in other words the funds have been paid and you are dead to sin and he says that has consequences when you're dead to sin now think about it you've got a slave let's go back to the slave days brother brandon don't help me out come on we're we're we're winding down but you recognize this okay brother brother you you'll be the slave for this this one because otherwise we won't be able to leave the script sit down get up go give me a clean axe right he's a slave he's got to do what he says now what if i get him get angry at him and um and he said he's not bringing it fast enough and so i started beating him right and um and i beat him until he's dead and pretend you're dead all right now if i was his master guess what i'm not as master anymore there's nothing i can do to order him around because he's dead okay thank you all right so so that that that relationship is over now this is what the bible is saying he's saying there was a relationship that you were in you had a master and his name was the devil you had a master his name was sin but when you were born again you were justified and you were dead and that old master has no more rights over you and now you've got to make a decision you got to make a decision what you're going to believe and what you're going to confess now imagine let's flip the situation let's let's say that um by some way right it was just uh has anyone ever had a bad a bad boss anybody had a job where they had a really bad monkey they didn't ran in again okay so you had a bad boss and and pretend i'm the bad boss right and if you can understand because what god says in his word is exactly what he means he doesn't mean maybe he doesn't mean something sideways he doesn't mean for you to work it up what he says he does when he said let there be light he caused the light to shine when he said there would be sons of god he was the one who brought forth the light of the sons of god by speaking his word over them what was their part right their part was to respond to the word of god just like mary did you say amen to the word of god and so god is telling something to justified people today he's telling you something about your christian life about how you can overcome sin because you have somebody who's been trying to boss you around and when brother brandon had that bad boss he didn't like him but when the bad boss said do this he was like okay and he would do it and he but imagine now brother brandon gets a new job now he's got a new job and this isn't quite as extreme because the bible actually says you know you were dead that relationship is severed forever okay but now he's got it he's got a new job and brother paul's his boss he's a much better boss and brother paul's for the policy you know just treating him great but then the old boss comes hey brandon he's like yeah i need you to do something for me and he's kind of thinking he's saying it really mean what does he need to say you're not the boss of me do you realize that that's what god is telling you to do listen to this okay you understand the example he says likewise reckon yourselves dead indeed unto sin but alive unto god through jesus christ he's saying something happened when you were born again now you notice what the devil is the bible tells us that the devil was a liar he was a cheat he was a thief from the beginning in other words when he comes to you he doesn't need to use logic he doesn't play fair he'll just say stuff and see if it works right so he'll say you're not a son of god and you respond to that maybe i'm not a son of a guy he's like oh that's working he'll keep working that but if if he if he um if that's not working about well you are a son of god but if you're a son of god you should do this and he'll start trying to build up build up your pride because he doesn't care he's just throwing lies at you to see what works but what god does in his in his word is he tells us the truth and the truth sets us free and the truth concerning those who are born again is that he's not your master anymore and he says reckon yourself dead to sin and so what what it's saying is you will still be attacked you will still be attacked but now you have a choice to make he said let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body in other words sin wants to rule over you but you don't belong to sin anymore your heart's been changed and so he'll intimidate you but in first timothy it says god has not given us a spirit of fear but a spirit of power and love and a sound mind if you look up that spirit of fear you know what it is it's intimidation cowardice and do you realize a lot of times when the devil attacks you he's trying to intimidate you he's trying to back you into a corner you're like oh maybe i don't know this maybe i don't know this that's why you've got to renew your mind in the word of god because it tells you the truth about yourself it says that relationship is severed he's not the boss of you anymore you say i am dead to sin why because i put my trust in christ he died for me and he rose for me and so i every requirement that the law has of me has been met in other words there's not a single accusation that's going to come up against me that i'm not going to condemn he said you will condemn it why because your righteousness is the righteousness of god so in other words he's going to point us us and jesus is going to say his righteousness is my righteousness do you know one of the names of gods is the lord our righteousness jehovah sit canoe the lord our righteousness he would give that as one of his names do you realize in proverbs it says that the name of the lord is a strong tower the righteous run into it and are safe you can run into the lord your righteousness and be safe from the attacks of the enemy and so what one of the ways i realized as a young person the devil was beating me up and down tricking me that i was wasn't born again that he was still my master and you know what a lot of times i believed it because i was going by feeling i felt guilty you know what psalm 32 says blessed is he blessed is the man to whom the lord does not impute sin the lord you're like how could the lord not impute sin the way the lord doesn't impute sin is that he paid for our sins he paid for our sins what is the penalty for sin it's our life it's our life right the wages of sin is death that's what that's what the bible says if you know that your sins have been paid for right the bible tells us that you are right with god and so romans 8 1 says you don't have to worry about being damned to hell so now he says you have a choice to make neither yield you your members as instruments of unrighteousness but yield your selves unto god as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments as righteousness unto god for sin shall not have dominion under you in other words the power of sin has been broken you guys sing the song the anthem here the power of sin is broken jesus overcame it all you guys ever sing that that song you know that song the power of sin is broken do you know how jesus broke the power of sin well there's there's uh the first thing that he did was he justified you the second thing that he did was he gave you new life and he changes your heart and so that when when you're born again that there's a there's a change that will happen you will you the in your inner man you would desire to do the will of god but your three parts spirit soul and body the devil won't be able to make your spirit desire the things of the world but he can attack you in your soul in your flesh and a lot of times we get confused because he's he's attacking us on our flesh and we're like oh i still i still feel these things maybe i don't have the holy spirit no i do have the holy spirit but i have to walk out right the thing that god already did that's why it would tell you he's saying go balance your checkbook see what god did for you what did he do for you he saved you you passed from death into life and so when when when you're attacked by the enemy what's the answer well it's simple you're not the boss of me jesus is is the boss of me and you say well that's that sounds too easy well the the gospel is simple but but it's it's not it's not easy there's there's there's a battle right there there's there's a battle there's there's a battle that we go through but it's a choice that we make it's a choice that we make as believers just one more as as we as we close i want to cover one in in first john chapter 5. i want to talk a little bit about condemnation so we we talked about um the condom romans 8 1 is talking about being damned to hell and it says once you're in christ jesus you will never be damned to hell in other words your sins have been forgiven you're like what does that mean i don't have to confess anymore no you do you do have to confess but it means when when you've passed from death into life hebrews 10 14 says by one offering he's perfected forever them that are sanctified well how many times do you think you'd have to perfect somebody forever how many once right if they're perfected forever it's done do you know how many times you get justified one time right one time you get because the blood of christ is enough to pay for every sin that you ever did and every sin that you ever will do what you have to do is you have to believe it you have to believe it you believe it in your heart and you confess it and the bible says that's how we're justified when we believe it and so what what we're trying to do a lot of times is we're trying to feel it we're trying to feel it do you realize you don't have to feel forgiven to be forgiving this this is something i struggled with a lot as a because you feel so guilty for your sin you're like i don't feel forgiven that was so bad what does the word say it says if we confess our sin he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness and and primarily to somebody who's born again that's about fellowship that's that's that's about fellowship with god it's about it's about it's about relationship now there are people who think they're born again if you never have the fruits of righteousness then the you know we start with a little fruit but if if if your desires haven't changed and you you just you're just coming to church you know you haven't been born again you need to be born again and god god will we'll we'll save you but we serve a living god and what i just wanted to share with you tonight is that the the secret to overcoming sin number one you have to be born again if you're not born again you will not overcome sin it doesn't matter how much you try but the way god causes believers to overcome sin is he forgives them first in other words he removes that penalty of hell first first john 4 says hearing is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment you know boldness in the day of judgment is it means when you're coming to the judgment seat you're not wondering what the verdict will be has anyone ever wondered when i get to the judgment seat is god going to say guilty or justified that's not boldness but he said he said hearing is our love made perfect then it might have boldness in the way of judgment in other words the way that god brings you to maturity is he first takes away the fear of condemnation in other words he's saying you will not be judged because your righteousness is of me right and and the devil the whole time is telling you you're not worthy and you say that's right i'm not worthy that's why it's called grace right because he is worthy what he did is more than enough and if you can believe that then you receive it by faith right and then you're righteous with god not because you feel righteous but because he made you righteous and if you confess that if you believe it you'll notice that your feelings will change that what god wants you to do is believe exactly what he says in the word about you so if it says christ paid the penalty for your sin it means that he paid the penalty for your sin and i don't care how young you are or how old you are we have to renew our mind in that right that that i'm right with god that he's paid the penalty for my sin and these attacks that are coming with me they're not the boss of me god is the boss of me i'm i'm risen with christ why because i put my faith in christ amen and you'll notice so herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in the world how is he in the world he said be of good cheer i have overcome the world that's that's how that's how he is in the world it goes on there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love now a lot of times we think of this verse and we think of oh if i'm afraid then then i just got to think about love and i won't be afraid and it is true that the love of god will deal with these these fears but he's talking about that that he's actually removed the fear of being judged so he because he says here in his love made perfect that you may have boldness in the day of judgment in other words when god saves you he doesn't want you to say i think he saves gideon and he doesn't want gideon wondering is he going to make it to heaven today but tomorrow he's not going to make it because he had a bad day maybe he he struggled with some things now he's not going to make it no he said gideon i saved you and i want you to know that i saved you and be bold about it in other words what's boldness in the day of judgment can you imagine walking up to the judgment seat he's like righteous that's what that's what he's saying about you why because your righteousness is of him right and he said he says so perfect love casts without all fear when you walk in his perfect love the perfect love is the love that god had for you when he saved you and he goes that's it's from that place that you overcome sin knowing not that you're trying to earn his salvation but that he's already given it to you and he's so when he says reckon when when you're struggling with sin as a young person you have to recognize that you will not earn god's favor the galatians tells us if we actually try to earn god's favor we will actually undo what what god will that that the that that our faith will be in in vain you have to put your trust in christ and him alone you know what our righteousness is filthy rags god gives us a beautiful white robe you got this dirty rag the word used in isaiah is actually a pretty uh crude when it talks about filthy rags this is the word it's used in the scripture but it says menstrual cloth i mean that's that's that's what your righteousness is now can you imagine god giving you a white robe you know like i just got to put this on here it'll look real nice that's what our righteousness is to god you can't earn it you have to recognize that he already did it for you and why did he how did he do it it wasn't cheap god himself shed his own blood for you the one who's worth more than all of creation combined he did that it came at great cost why did he do it he did it for his love to you amen let's have the musicians come he did it because of his love for us amen and he wants us to overcome sin from that place of already being made righteous and if that was i don't know how many years it took me to understand that and i i i trust that god is speaking to some of your spirits and i trust that he's speaking to everybody but remember what we remember what we we talked about earlier in the service we talked about faith and faith is what god says about you you say so be it in other words i receive it now if god if you've put your faith in christ if you haven't put your faith in christ you can put your faith in christ tonight you can put your faith in christ tonight but if you have put your faith in christ if you've trusted him what does it mean to trust him the bible says that the devils believe and tremble believing in christ doesn't mean believing a bunch of facts about him it means staking your whole life on him the the what's the the closer word in in in what we use in modern english should be closer to trust when when you trust somebody you do something about it and you can't say you believe in christ unless your actions change because if you actually believe in what he's done for you then you'll do something about it you know what he said he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also right when we when we believe in god changes happen in our life amen keep playing we've been made more than conquerors the devil doesn't doesn't fight fair and uh for a lot of people he'll attack us and he'll just be making you feel guilty all the time so you can never do anything for god but you know what how god is glorified he's glorified in you bringing forth fruit and do you know what he says bringing forth fruit is he says if you abide in me and my words abide in you you'll bring forth much fruit in other words the things that he spoken concerning the sons of god especially as we would come into the manifestation of the sons of god god wants you healing and raising the dead who's ever sung i've got a river of life flowing out of me you know what that song says it says make the lame to walk and the blind to see but you don't feel like you could raise the dead you don't feel like you can make the blind see but god said he that believeth on me the works that i shall do shall he do also he didn't say the apostles that believe on me the works that i do shall he do also he said he they believe upon me the littlest lowliest child that believes on him to save works you'll do why because when god says something in the in the heart of the believer when you confess it the transformation happens you might have come into this place a caterpillar today god wants you to leave a butterfly different than when you came he's speaking over your life you know the devil would like to make you feel guilty and confusing about what god did but when he paid the debt he paid it in full he didn't leave part of it for us to pay he delivered us from fear so you don't have to walk in fear you don't have to wonder if you can fail that's what predestination is about he said he said i've chosen you from the foundation of the world he that began a good work in you will perform it how until the day of jesus christ psalm 37 says the steps of a good man are ordered by the lord not if he fall though he fall he will not be cast down why because underneath him the lord's hands are holding him up that's what god does when you're born again yes we fall but he says you won't be condemned because your righteousness is of me and he wants you to get that in your spirit balance some checkbooks balancing the checkbook is marking the line of what jesus did for you i was buried him with him in his death and i'm risen with him colossians chapter three and verse one if you then be risen with christ it's not saying if you feel you're risen with christ but if you're risen with christ seek those things that are above you have decisions to make i thought i couldn't make those decisions because i was pressed i was pressed by the temptations i was pressed by the things people were doing around me but he said you don't have to be pressed you can be transformed by the renewing of your mind you can believe that you're already righteous because i made you righteous and if you haven't been made righteous yet if you're still trying it's simple you want to know how you get saved two things repent and trust two things acts 2 38 how do you repent also two things you acknowledge and turn it's not enough to just acknowledge i know there's some of you who probably aren't saved here tonight and i don't want you to leave this place god wants people to be free not tomorrow he wants you to be free tonight and sometimes you know we've walked for a long time but the devil's still been beating us up with things but he said whom the son shall set free it's free indeed in other words you're not a slave any longer they'll become a tax after you they're saying do this do that you say oh no you don't i'm not a slave any longer because jesus set me free and if you're under condemnation jesus wants to set you free tonight what does it mean to repent acknowledge acknowledge that what you've done is against god you have to turn from your way and turn to something it's not repentance unless you turn the root of the word repentance means to turn in other words you're going one way but you say god god speak in his hearts tonight and some of you have not yet turned god wants you to turn tonight acknowledge i'm going the wrong way after a turn but when i turn i have to turn to something what do you turn the cross the cross was made a tree of life to us when his blood was shed his body was made a tree of life to us what do you trust in you trust jesus what did jesus do he paid the debt he was whipped so you don't have to be whipped some of us we let the devil whip us because we feel like we deserve to be whipped how many of you are going to go in a store and you paid for all your goods and you get to the thing and they say no why don't you leave them here [Music] i don't know what young people like these days maybe gadgets whatever the newest phone is what's the newest phone iphone 11 all right 12. oh man bust all right iphone 12. joshua saves up his money he likes apple stuff gets an iphone 12 he goes in the store he paid for it he gets to the gate security stops him says let me have your phone no you don't i paid for it prove it got a receipt now it could be a mean security guard i mean brother paul is pretty intimidating if he put a mean face and you know you you might you might second guess given your phone but why are you gonna take it out of the store because it's paid for do you know why jesus paid for your sins do you want to know why he paid for your healing do you know why he bore your burdens he bore him so you wouldn't have to so you don't have to leave without the things that he paid for so you don't have to wait till tomorrow do you know that in the old testament law there was a law that if somebody worked for you you could not turn them away that night without paying them if you had the money how could god put that in his own law and when he paid for your healing say oh we'll better wait till tomorrow if it's paid for now do you know in isaiah 53 it says by his stripes we are healed but in first peter 2 24 do you know what it says by his stripes we were healed in other words it's paid for we expect things that were paid for and so when we get to the gate and somebody says you ain't taking that phone out of here you say oh yes i am because it's paid for that's what faith is about it's recognizing what he has done jesus paid a great price and if you haven't trusted god tonight you can trust him trust him that he paid for your sins and he paid for you to go free and when we sing this song we've been made more than conquerors that comes from the end of romans chapter eight and romans chapter 8 talks about obstacles the end of it the beginning we read he says you're not damned to hell but he keeps going he says if the spirit is in you it'll quicken your mortal body there's so many promises in romans 8 we go through things and he says all the things that you go through god's going to work them out for good but what's the good it says his purpose that he'd actually bring you as a manifested son to glory because it said he was the firstborn among many brethren that's what god's destiny is for you tonight i don't care what you think about yourself in the in the healing revivals uh what's called the latter rain movement the the be before the time brother branham came on the scene there were there were a few pioneers before him john alexander dowie smith wigglesworth um john g lake but in um in the in the early part of the 1900s during the revivals under smith wigglesworth he was a he was called the apostle of faith in britain and i read a story as a four-year-old girl during this revival man had cancer guess who prayed for the man with cancer the four-year-old girl she laid her hands on him and he was healed god honors the faith of children god wants you to be free because he paid for it you think can you imagine how angry i would be i don't know what the fanciest restaurant in this area is but in is that area restaurant in sylvania trio is that still there there's a restaurant called trio that was the fanciest one i saw in sylvania but you can imagine if they were still open and we're wrapping up the meeting and i said you know what we're all gonna go to trio we're gonna we're gonna do it up tonight and i paid for every last person in here so you could eat a trio and you know how if i came to trio later and i didn't see any food out i didn't see anybody there and i asked the maitre d at the front and say what happened they say oh yeah everybody came here i told them told them to go away you know what i'd be mad you want to know why i'd be mad why do you think you pay for somebody to have something because you want them to have it do you think god doesn't want you to have deliverance god wants you to have deliverance it's a thief that doesn't want you to have deliverance it's a thief that doesn't want you to have healing it's a thief that wants you to have condemnation but god wants you to be free tonight he wants you to be free if you've been battling with things sometimes we've been christians for a long time but even though we've been christians for a long time we've still been facing some battles sometimes it's the spirits of condemnation spirits of fear spirits and uneasiness and what some of these things are called that we face a long time they're called strongholds but the bible says the weapons of our warfare they're not carnal but they're mighty to god to the pulling down of strongholds i believe god wants you to be free tonight stand with me as we sing this song we've been made more than conquerors do you notice it didn't say that we made ourselves conquerors but it said we've been made more than conquerors how through the blood of jesus christ we just sing this song if anybody needs prayer tonight you're welcome uh to come while we're singing this song we serve a god that sets people free we serve a god who sets people free and i'm just gonna share this testimony what the devil does is cheat and lie he works illegally and when god gives you something it belongs to you when he gives it to you do you know when he gave the children israel the promised land everybody who was in the promised land immediately became trespassers because the land belonged to them and you have to use the authority that god has given you to kick out the trespassers and we were we were in our our um home church we're teaching on trespassers and we just offered people to come up for prayer who wanted deliverance for things and um young man there some of you have heard his testimony andrew had a gluten allergy for years and he wanted deliverance from that god didn't give me the gluten allergy this stuff came in through sin but god paid for him to be free from that wasn't a fancy prayer just spoke to the trespasser and said leave him now in the name of jesus and he was free and the great part about it was a lot of the neighbors knew about it so they began telling about the neighbors but do you realize that it's not how sincerely we pray but it's the authority when god speaks that's when it's done and so what as as we sing this song you know i'm not i don't believe in twisting people's arm for prayer but if you want prayer tonight if you've been struggling with something and you need to be delivered from a stronghold that you can't be god will set you free tonight we've been made more than conquerors [Music] overcomers in this life we've been made victorious through the blood of jesus christ we've been made more than conquerors overcomers in this life we've been made victorious through the blood of jesus christ we've been made more than calm [Music] overcomers in this life [Music] we've been [Music] through the blood of jesus christ amen amen god bless you tonight i trust that god has spoken to you by by his word you know so it's so simple the devil likes to get us all twisted up but it's as simple as believing and confessing and it happens because god said it what happened amen brother paul praise the lord well i just say that jesus has provided a way for all of you and if he didn't provide that way then there's a real hell there's a real place that we go with our but we have a place to bring our sin and it's offered every young person tonight so i wouldn't leave the service or if we even close the service and and this simple message shows you the power to be able to overcome you got to begin to believe what god has done for you if you haven't personally done that it's not about your parents believing it's about you believing if you feel a pull to give your heart to god and be baptized even if it's dismissed if you want to come forward i would do that because it's the only way that provides a way that there'd be no damnation of hell for us that he provided a way for us to be saved can you say man and i
