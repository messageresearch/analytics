Lyrics
You never change
You are the God You say You are
When I'm afraid
You come and still my beating heart
You stay the same
When hope is just a distant thought
You take my pain
And You lead me to the cross

What love is this
That You gave Your life for me
And made a way for me to know You
And I confess
You're always enough for me
You're all I need

I look to You
I see the scars upon Your hands
And hold the truth
That when I can't, You always can
And standing here
Beneath the shadow of the cross
I'm overwhelmed
That I keep finding open arms

What love is this
That You gave Your life for me
And made a way for me to know You
And I confess
You're always enough for me
You're all I need

Jesus, in Your suffering
You were reaching
You thought of me
Jesus, in Your suffering
You were reaching
You thought of me

What love is this
That You gave Your life for me
And made a way for me to know You
And I confess
You're always enough for me
You're all I need

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
You never change. You are the God you say you are. When I'm afraid, you come and steal my beating heart. You stay the same. When hope is just a distant thought, you take my pain and you lead me to the cross. What love is this? That you gave your life for me and made a way for me to know you. And I confess you're always enough for me. You're all I need. I look to you. I see the scars upon your hands and hold the truth that when I can, you always can. And standing here beneath the shadow of the cross, I'm overwhelmed that I keep finding open arms. What love is this? That you gave your life for me and made a way for me to know you. And I confess you're always enough for me. You're all I need, Jesus. In your suffering. You were reaching. You thought of me. Jesus in your suffering you were reaching. You thought of me. What a love is this that you gave your life for me and made a way for me to know you. And I confess you're always enough for me. You're all I need and I confess you're always enough for me. You're all I need.
