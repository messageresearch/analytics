[0:14] you're
[0:28] yes
[0:56] you
[1:01] we need you lord we need you lord we
[1:14] need you
[1:24] lord
[1:36] right now
[1:52] oh
[2:04] in worship
[2:20] praise the lord let's read in our
[2:21] scriptures tonight if you take your
[2:22] bibles
[2:24] first chronicles chapter 13 and i had a
[2:27] couple of prayer requests that came in
[2:28] from my aunt
[2:29] that lives in michigan here and uh have
[2:32] giddy and take it off my voicemail we'll
[2:33] pray for those at the end of the service
[2:35] a couple urgent needs
[2:37] and i was just privileged that she felt
[2:39] good that she called us
[2:40] and called me to um to call upon the
[2:43] lord for those things so i want to
[2:45] take the into account and i just forgot
[2:47] to write it before so let's
[2:48] we'll get to that at the end first
[2:50] chronicles 13 there's a couple places
[2:52] this is mentioned i want to read both
[2:54] places
[2:56] of course there's the chapter where
[2:58] david
[3:00] goes and tries to take the ark takes the
[3:02] ark and
[3:03] of course he does it the wrong way it
[3:04] wasn't the season
[3:06] and uh does a few things here and we're
[3:08] familiar with this from
[3:09] the message that was preached uh doing
[3:11] god of service without his will
[3:13] but uh just a couple verses here at
[3:16] chapter 13 first chronicles 13
[3:18] and verse 13 and 14. so david brought
[3:22] not the whole
[3:22] the ark home to himself to the city of
[3:25] david
[3:26] but carried it inside into the house of
[3:28] obadi obadidam
[3:30] the gite and the ark of god remained
[3:32] with the family of obadidom in his house
[3:35] three months and the lord blessed the
[3:37] house of obaditum
[3:39] and all that he had now let's go back
[3:41] and read it in ii samuel in the same
[3:42] account
[3:43] there's just a little bit more wording
[3:45] given there so i want to read it both
[3:46] places
[3:47] second samuel chapter 6
[3:54] and should be here in verse
[3:58] 12. yes verse 11. and the ark of the
[4:01] lord and i'm second samuel 6 and verse
[4:03] 11 the ark of the lord continued in the
[4:05] house of obadidham
[4:06] the gethi three months and the lord
[4:08] blessed obadidam in all his household
[4:11] and it was told king david saying the
[4:13] lord hath blessed the house
[4:15] of obadidom and all that pertaineth unto
[4:19] him
[4:19] because of the ark of god so david went
[4:22] and brought up the ark of god from the
[4:24] house of obadidom
[4:26] into the city of david with gladness
[4:28] amen let's pray together
[4:30] our lord jesus we thank you lord for
[4:33] this time that we spend together lord
[4:35] each wednesday night
[4:36] and sunday and we cherish the times
[4:38] we're able to get together lord and
[4:40] to be able to share in your word and
[4:42] every day we want to find that
[4:44] portion that you have for us lord and
[4:46] we're thankful lord not only for the
[4:48] meat of the word that you've given
[4:50] but also the milk of the lord as well
[4:52] and father whatever is needed at the
[4:54] time you're able to
[4:55] provide it for babes in christ or those
[4:57] who've grown
[4:58] to full maturity leaving the principles
[5:00] of the doctrine of christ and moving on
[5:02] to perfection
[5:03] you provide the bread and the food
[5:04] that's needed for all
[5:06] and lord you also are so mindful of all
[5:09] the needs
[5:10] that you're able just if a minister will
[5:12] yield himself and the people will yield
[5:14] themselves
[5:15] you're able to flow the service into a
[5:17] way father that it would
[5:19] be designed to be able to meet the needs
[5:21] and answer questions
[5:23] and lord we depend on the holy ghost for
[5:25] that that isn't man that's your holy
[5:27] ghost and that's when we
[5:28] really like to see you have the
[5:29] preeminence lord because when you do
[5:31] then father needs can be mad we thank
[5:33] you for that lord we brought our
[5:34] petitions to you we've brought the
[5:37] different things and also our voices of
[5:39] praise and our hearts to you
[5:40] and lord i just pray that it would be
[5:42] received from the into the depths of
[5:44] your heart tonight
[5:45] and that we would feel close to you and
[5:47] that your presence through the word of
[5:49] god
[5:49] would speak to us lord and we just
[5:51] commit the service to you now
[5:52] and all who would be listening into your
[5:54] loving hands in jesus name
[5:56] amen amen once you shake somebody's hand
[5:59] before you seated god bless you all
[6:00] tonight for coming out
[6:01] to the house of the lord we're
[6:02] continuing our series here on the
[6:05] blessed families abraham's promise of
[6:09] in all the families under his faith all
[6:11] the families of the earth will be
[6:12] blessed
[6:14] and so we're also glad to receive
[6:17] many comments and different things of
[6:20] the application that brothers and
[6:21] sisters are taking from the things we're
[6:23] preaching here wednesday nights and
[6:24] applying them to their homes
[6:26] and just uh looking at it from the
[6:28] perspective of going through the bible
[6:29] and seeing these little nuggets in here
[6:31] for our families
[6:32] i'm learning a lot myself and i pray
[6:34] that our families will be better because
[6:35] of it
[6:37] now last week we talked took the subject
[6:40] of
[6:40] during the time of joshua and uh i felt
[6:43] like that subject about what
[6:46] the uh we had a family called the aiken
[6:48] family
[6:49] and the aiken family decided to bring a
[6:52] wrong thing
[6:53] into their home or their tent and i felt
[6:55] like that was a very important subject
[6:57] because we've seen the effect
[6:59] of not only at bringing a a curse for
[7:01] them
[7:02] but also bringing a curse on the whole
[7:05] army of israel it hindered their battle
[7:07] and so many things that came because
[7:09] they justified bringing something into
[7:10] their tent that wasn't right
[7:12] that's a great subject for family
[7:13] because we all always have to make
[7:15] choices don't we
[7:16] every day we seem to have to make
[7:18] choices and we have to pray about things
[7:20] and look at
[7:20] whether we're going to incorporate it we
[7:22] live in a world that's constantly
[7:23] upgrading and constantly bringing out
[7:24] new things and new inventions
[7:26] and some people are bent that they love
[7:29] that they love the new things that are
[7:30] coming out
[7:31] and so because of the nature of the age
[7:33] we really got to be prayerful to make
[7:35] sure
[7:36] that something that we're bringing in
[7:37] doesn't have trouble that comes with it
[7:40] because that's really what a curse is
[7:41] it's bringing there's trouble that comes
[7:43] with something
[7:44] and when trouble comes with something we
[7:45] start to see the trouble crop
[7:47] up in our children and our relationships
[7:49] with one another our relationship with
[7:51] god
[7:52] how we interact with one another our
[7:54] attitudes start changing
[7:55] so if you watch that fruit start to take
[7:57] place you realize wow
[7:59] something something's happening
[8:00] something's wrong and that's actually
[8:02] what joshua did he started to say
[8:04] what is going wrong here something's
[8:05] wrong we just fought a battle and we
[8:07] just lost
[8:07] 36 men and god said that wasn't going to
[8:10] happen
[8:11] god said if we went to battle he'd fight
[8:13] our battle and when he realized they
[8:15] lost 36 men
[8:16] innocent men he see he was saying stop
[8:18] hold wait wait a minute
[8:20] something's wrong and i pray that we
[8:21] could have parents
[8:23] moms and dads that have that kind of
[8:26] sensitivity to the lord
[8:28] that when they know trouble is happening
[8:30] to say whoa
[8:31] to be a joshua and say stop a minute
[8:33] something is wrong
[8:35] i don't know what it is but we're going
[8:36] to get to the bottom of this thing
[8:38] and that's what joshua was saying and
[8:40] boy did the holy spirit ever get to the
[8:41] bottom of it
[8:42] and so they started with the tribes and
[8:43] then they went down the heads of the
[8:45] tribes
[8:45] then they went down the families the
[8:47] heads of the families trickling it down
[8:49] to every household
[8:50] and the holy spirit just scanned in that
[8:52] whole thing to find what the trouble
[8:54] was and friends if you don't think
[8:55] that's still happening today
[8:57] in this hour i'll tell you it's still
[8:59] happening every time we get together for
[9:00] church
[9:01] because the holy spirit doesn't bring us
[9:03] together just to pass on the back all
[9:05] the time
[9:06] it's actually sniffing out those things
[9:07] and looking for those things
[9:09] that are hindrances to our lives and so
[9:11] he kind of systematically does it to our
[9:13] hearts
[9:14] as he just peels back the layers to see
[9:16] if there's anything there that's
[9:17] displeasing to the lord
[9:19] same god that was in israel the same god
[9:21] tonight can you say amen
[9:22] and so joshua said wait a minute and so
[9:24] now the aiken family
[9:26] brought something wrong into their home
[9:28] and into their tent and it brought a
[9:29] curse it brought trouble
[9:31] and if you'll notice there that's they
[9:33] when they
[9:34] killed the family and they stoned them
[9:35] after it was over then
[9:37] as a matter of fact let's just read that
[9:39] a minute joshua i want to pick that up
[9:41] and get that last verse there in joshua
[9:43] chapter 7.
[9:45] joshua 7 verse 26
[9:48] and they um yeah and they raised him
[9:51] over a great heap of stones
[9:53] unto this day so the lord turned from
[9:56] the fierceness of his anger so
[9:58] in this incident in chapter 7 it it
[10:01] angered the lord that somebody had
[10:02] disobeyed and brought something into
[10:04] their tent
[10:05] uh aching his family that was a
[10:08] a a garment that wasn't right and also
[10:11] a wedge of gold and silver and so it
[10:14] angered god god is the one that got
[10:15] angry with it
[10:16] and so when they took care of it and
[10:19] purged it from the children of israel
[10:21] and this family then was taken away then
[10:24] it says the the lord turned from the
[10:26] fierceness of his anger
[10:28] wherefore the name of that place was
[10:30] called the valley of acor
[10:31] unto this day and that acorn means
[10:35] trouble
[10:36] so the very valley that they were stoned
[10:38] in and god ended all this and ended his
[10:40] anger
[10:41] was called the valley of trouble because
[10:43] that's what israel got into
[10:44] was trouble because of someone
[10:47] incorporating something
[10:48] that affected all the all the all of the
[10:50] congregation of israel
[10:51] so listen now the valley of trouble you
[10:54] how many has been through the valley of
[10:56] trouble and how many has been through it
[10:59] and after it you
[11:00] realize that you got into the trouble by
[11:03] it wasn't god doing it it wasn't anybody
[11:05] else doing it you got into trouble
[11:06] yourself
[11:07] you've been through a valley of trouble
[11:09] there's nothing worse than being a
[11:10] valley of trouble that it seems like
[11:12] everything's cursed
[11:13] everything is nothing's blessed and
[11:15] everything's turning bad can you say
[11:16] ma'am you know life can be like that
[11:20] sometimes but if you've been in that
[11:22] valley of trouble
[11:23] uh then we realize that in that place uh
[11:26] like it was back then god got angry at
[11:29] this
[11:30] they lost the victory of the battles
[11:32] there was no victory in battle
[11:33] they lost the victory of ai they lost 36
[11:37] innocent men and god said all of israel
[11:40] has sinned
[11:41] in other words it wasn't just one family
[11:43] he when god looked at it
[11:44] all israel has sinned that's the way he
[11:46] worded it that's how serious it was
[11:48] it affected the whole congregation i
[11:51] appreciate the brokenness of some
[11:52] brothers saying that man i didn't
[11:54] realize
[11:54] this impact of what this says is that i
[11:58] i had brothers say they've scanned their
[12:00] home and prayed
[12:01] because you know why they don't want
[12:03] anything to hinder somebody getting
[12:05] healed
[12:07] they don't want anything in their lives
[12:09] that would hinder somebody in the
[12:10] congregation getting their healthy
[12:12] or getting their deliverance because
[12:13] they realize it does affect the rest of
[12:15] us
[12:16] and these things do have a a a
[12:19] significant thing to the rest of us
[12:20] so the whole the congregation was
[12:22] affected aitkin's family was affected
[12:25] and of course died
[12:26] and i i'd say that's a lot of trouble
[12:28] that come from one
[12:30] garment bringing a garment and a gold
[12:32] wedge and a silver
[12:34] piece uh that's a lot of trouble from a
[12:37] garment
[12:40] i said that's a lot of trouble that came
[12:42] from a garment
[12:44] but it does it's not about the garment
[12:46] it's a garment that had a curse with it
[12:48] it's a garment that god said anything
[12:50] that is in in jericho
[12:52] is cursed and so now once god cursed it
[12:55] then to bring it out it had a curse that
[12:56] went with it
[12:57] it traveled with it spirits travel in
[13:00] things
[13:01] spirits travel in music spirits travel
[13:04] in
[13:05] uh the intellect of the world spirits
[13:07] travel on the internet
[13:09] spirits travel in garments in clothing
[13:12] that's right if you don't know that then
[13:14] you're gonna have to read your bible
[13:16] more you're gonna have to get in tune
[13:17] with the lord
[13:17] because we find it in the bible we find
[13:19] it's true today the right spirit or the
[13:21] wrong spirit can travel in these things
[13:23] and they are important but god looks at
[13:25] the heart of course god looks at the
[13:27] heart
[13:27] he looks at the heart first but it
[13:29] doesn't get away from the essential fact
[13:31] that spirits travel in certain clothing
[13:34] and we have to be as christians mindful
[13:36] of that all the time
[13:38] look at all the trouble that came from a
[13:40] garment look at all the trouble that
[13:41] came from a gold wedge
[13:43] and aiken's family thought this will
[13:45] make it held a little bit better off for
[13:46] us in case we get into trouble
[13:47] financially
[13:48] or something and uh maybe we can use
[13:50] this garment i don't know what all they
[13:52] wanted to use it for but
[13:53] it was nice enough that they wanted to
[13:54] keep it but look at the trouble that
[13:56] came with it
[13:57] is it worth it was it worth it all the
[14:00] trouble was it worth it and that's why
[14:01] people
[14:02] is it worth it to hang on to this little
[14:03] thing i want this i want to wear this i
[14:05] want to do this
[14:06] is it worth it you better take a good
[14:09] look at that
[14:10] that's right praise the lord so so now
[14:14] it affected the whole congregation so
[14:15] now uh there's a theory in the world
[14:17] then if we would look at this principle
[14:19] there's a theory that says that
[14:20] one thing doesn't have to do with the
[14:22] other so in other words you can't tie
[14:24] the two together
[14:25] come on now all that trouble came from
[14:26] just this garment so there's a theory
[14:28] says one thing doesn't have to do with
[14:29] the other it's a very worldly point of
[14:31] view
[14:31] we can't have it as christians there's
[14:33] too much in the bible that shows us
[14:34] otherwise
[14:35] that that many times one thing can have
[14:38] to do with the other
[14:40] so it says that solomon one day because
[14:42] of all the women he began to get from
[14:44] other countries and begin to marry him
[14:46] and begin to do all these other things
[14:47] and they turned his hearts towards idols
[14:49] remember this is in a millennium
[14:50] with god's people that the queen of
[14:52] sheba when it was in its prime came
[14:54] and said this is god this is the wisdom
[14:56] of god this is
[14:57] this is the greatest you could see the
[14:59] children of israel is in that time of
[15:00] solomon but later on his heart was
[15:02] directed towards other gods
[15:04] because of the women he was getting
[15:06] involved with and two or three
[15:07] scriptures later it says because of the
[15:09] women
[15:10] god turned an enemy against solomon and
[15:12] right amongst his own kingdom he got an
[15:15] enemy against him that began to
[15:16] begin to work to tear down his kingdom
[15:19] and the two were tied together
[15:21] because he let his heart be drawn by
[15:23] these women then their enemy raises up
[15:25] to destroy his kingdom
[15:27] that's right and so we cannot believe
[15:29] this theory that says one thing is not
[15:30] tied to the other
[15:32] the aikens chose to exercise
[15:35] i'm guessing the aikens chose to
[15:37] exercise their personal
[15:38] rights i guess and their personal rights
[15:42] to have this
[15:42] and so but but but we really got to
[15:45] watch that
[15:46] because within the body of christ we
[15:48] have to really make sure
[15:50] that our personal rights don't affect
[15:52] somebody else
[15:54] and that's in the book of that's in the
[15:56] new testament too when
[15:57] paul speaks of certain rights and
[15:59] somebody has a liberty to do something
[16:00] they have faith to do something
[16:02] but if it offends your brother you
[16:03] better be sensitive to that
[16:05] then paul say it that way that's my
[16:07] that's the lafontaine standard revised
[16:09] version there of that but you're
[16:10] familiar with that scripture
[16:11] is that we're we don't know what that
[16:13] scripture says we don't live to
[16:15] ourselves
[16:16] we don't say i do my own thing brother
[16:18] and i just this is what i do and i don't
[16:20] care
[16:21] who it offends that doesn't work in the
[16:22] body of christ
[16:24] and paul says that and so he's got faith
[16:26] to do it so you may do it
[16:28] and but then the other one should not
[16:30] criticize the one that would do it
[16:31] because then he's
[16:32] he's putting him down for having that
[16:34] faith to do it
[16:36] and see all this all all the rights the
[16:38] american rights and the whole tone of
[16:40] i've got my rights
[16:42] never seems to work well in the body of
[16:44] christ
[16:48] and really when we come we become a lamb
[16:50] saints we lay down our rights
[16:53] to the great lamb can you say man it's
[16:56] not about i'm gonna
[16:57] exercise this right so i'm guessing that
[16:59] was maybe part of it because i know us
[17:01] human beings
[17:02] and the aikens just thought it doesn't
[17:04] matter what god said
[17:05] we want to take this in and so they
[17:07] exercise their personal rights
[17:09] and maybe had other reasons for doing it
[17:10] as well what we have
[17:12] in our tent won't affect everyone else
[17:15] and they found out the hard way
[17:17] that that's not true now is it true in
[17:20] the new testament yes it's true i was
[17:22] reading it there in butler on saturday
[17:24] it's true in the new testament too
[17:26] because in first corinthians we find
[17:28] there was an
[17:28] incest or there was a sexual immorality
[17:31] going on in the church the corinthian
[17:33] church
[17:33] and everybody's kind of ignoring it and
[17:35] let the guy continue to come to church
[17:36] just let him come and he was blatantly
[17:38] doing it blatantly trying to take
[17:39] communion and everything else living in
[17:41] a bad situation with his uh stepmom i
[17:44] believe it was
[17:45] and so paul rebuked the whole church he
[17:48] says
[17:48] listen uh this is going to affect all of
[17:51] you
[17:52] you can't ignore this you're going to
[17:53] deal with this you've got to be mature
[17:55] sons and daughters of god and deal with
[17:57] this thing and here's the term you use
[17:59] a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump
[18:04] is that not bible and so the same
[18:07] principle in the old testament
[18:09] applies to the new that a little leaven
[18:11] in other words a little lemon
[18:12] affects the whole body paul said you
[18:15] better deal with it
[18:17] all right so we do know that the
[18:19] principle is true
[18:20] in the bible that we we one thing
[18:23] is many times tied to the other that
[18:25] being said i thought i would offer this
[18:27] warning to
[18:28] us that we are not prophets and because
[18:31] we are not we can't see many times
[18:33] all the details of what is related to
[18:36] one another right away
[18:38] a lot of times we see it later that
[18:40] something was related or god shows us or
[18:42] something but
[18:42] but to see that because we did this then
[18:46] we start getting into this mindset
[18:47] because i did this then this is the
[18:49] outcome
[18:50] and this is god's punishment to me we
[18:51] have to be careful that because we can
[18:53] be psychoanalyzing all the time
[18:55] everything that we do and tying it
[18:56] together with something else and we
[18:58] don't
[18:58] fully know all that all i'm asking you
[19:00] tonight is always be referent to this
[19:03] principle that's true
[19:04] that our actions and what we take into
[19:06] our life
[19:07] does affect somebody else and can affect
[19:10] other things in our life how pleasing we
[19:12] are to god
[19:14] it does affect sometimes the blessing or
[19:16] the curses that comes in our life
[19:18] the principles so true but i wanted to
[19:20] warn we're not prophets so
[19:22] we don't think we could uh uh we with
[19:24] that
[19:25] we can't see exactly what's related uh
[19:28] i remember someone had said in the
[19:30] hospital to somebody hospital room to
[19:31] somebody
[19:32] years ago i had a friend in toledo and
[19:34] uh he does
[19:35] he hasn't come to the church for many
[19:37] years but he he said that his family
[19:39] quit coming to church completely
[19:41] i think they were baptist and it was
[19:43] because someone up in the hospital had
[19:45] said because you had done this
[19:46] and his sister was there in the hospital
[19:48] and she had an accident she's in
[19:50] terrible condition
[19:51] and he said the whole family because you
[19:52] did this that's why she's in this
[19:54] hospital sick well
[19:55] he there's no way for him to know that
[19:57] exactly and that family lost
[19:59] all confidence in god and church and
[20:01] never come for years
[20:02] gator gator my friend was the only one
[20:04] that had confidence to come to church
[20:05] but he says
[20:06] i constantly plead and pray for my
[20:08] family but one comment that was made
[20:10] like that
[20:11] destroyed their trust and so that's why
[20:14] we have to be careful that we don't read
[20:16] into things in our minds
[20:17] a lot of times we don't do it with
[20:18] ourselves we do it with other people
[20:20] that's right
[20:21] we got it all figured out when it comes
[20:23] to other people's lives
[20:24] you know make it really easy on
[20:26] ourselves come on can i get a witness
[20:29] tonight we make it real easy but we
[20:30] become prophets to other people's lives
[20:32] well if they hadn't done that then they
[20:34] probably wouldn't been hurt over here
[20:38] a little accent with that
[20:43] i don't think that we should live in a
[20:45] constant wondering
[20:46] which things that we did had a cause and
[20:49] effect
[20:50] in other parts of our lives because we
[20:52] can be defeated all the time trying to
[20:53] do that
[20:54] i had a thought i had a bad thought
[20:56] about somebody so that must be why the
[20:58] car got totaled today
[21:00] or my kid spilled his ice cream on my
[21:03] new suit
[21:04] and it must be because i paid my taxes
[21:06] late last week
[21:08] something like that and so now
[21:11] you know we can't figure all this out
[21:12] and i'm only saying that because people
[21:14] do that the devil gets people's mind
[21:16] in a mode that they live in constant
[21:18] defeat trying to figure everything out
[21:20] trying to figure out what god's doing
[21:22] with them
[21:23] and we just need to submit ourselves to
[21:26] the lord
[21:28] because uh whatever he allows in our
[21:30] life is going to be good for us
[21:33] is that right we do reap what we sow you
[21:35] can't change that law
[21:37] all right and so i and i'm i'm still and
[21:39] you probably you are i'm still reaping
[21:41] uh some things that i decisions that i
[21:44] made years ago i'm still reaping those
[21:45] things
[21:46] but i was i loved it when i heard
[21:47] brother barry uh teach us one time
[21:49] that the only way to change it you can't
[21:51] change the harvest you're getting from
[21:52] bad decisions you can't change it
[21:54] you're gonna reap it but you can start
[21:56] sowing good seed
[21:58] so that you can get a better harvest
[21:59] down the road and that's what i've been
[22:00] trying to do
[22:01] so i can't change this harvest but i can
[22:03] make a new harvest for the future
[22:05] because the principle still works if we
[22:07] plant good seed praise the lord
[22:10] so you know that gives us a relief to
[22:12] understand it but what i want us to see
[22:14] tonight
[22:14] is that we we need a reverence for the
[22:17] principle
[22:18] that some things are tied to the other
[22:20] can you say man
[22:21] and when we have a when we have an
[22:23] irreverence for that principle
[22:25] we tend to give ourselves our rights to
[22:28] do things too much
[22:29] and to act on things and to incorporate
[22:33] things or to take something in our life
[22:35] without prayer or without thought of how
[22:38] it would affect others
[22:40] i think that's immaturity to quickly
[22:42] take something in your life
[22:43] because you your flesh wants it but
[22:45] there's no prayer there's no thought as
[22:47] to how it would affect others
[22:50] i think you can should consider that as
[22:52] a mature christian that now
[22:54] how will this affect my family in the
[22:55] future how will this affect other people
[22:57] in the congregation
[22:58] how does this look to other people well
[23:00] i don't care what people think what you
[23:01] look like well
[23:02] that doesn't fit with the whole
[23:04] christian walk friends
[23:05] because it does matter i was just
[23:08] telling someone the other day he says we
[23:09] can't
[23:09] have the attitude to say well i don't
[23:11] really care what other people think
[23:12] especially when we're in ministry we
[23:14] can't do that we can't take that
[23:15] attitude
[23:16] it is important what we put out before
[23:18] the public because we're representing
[23:20] jesus christ and we didn't want to
[23:23] stumble somebody can you say man that
[23:25] would be the worst thing
[23:26] for somebody look at my life and they're
[23:27] stumbled at my christian testimony
[23:30] so when we have a reverence then we're
[23:32] more prayerful and
[23:34] consider what we incorporate into our
[23:35] lives that would be a bad example
[23:37] so if we know the examples in the
[23:39] message we see that we must be prayerful
[23:42] that there's many examples in the
[23:44] message that we must be prayerful about
[23:46] these things
[23:46] because it's brought out in many things
[23:48] disrespect to god's servant sometimes
[23:51] can bring something can you bring a
[23:52] disease can bring a cancer
[23:54] and brother branham's own wife uh
[23:57] experienced that one day
[24:00] he says one day i come in and from the
[24:02] house and i come in to do something i
[24:03] turned around and went out
[24:04] and i said she said my wife can you go
[24:06] downtown with me bill
[24:08] and i said not right now honey and he
[24:09] said and she said what are we going to
[24:11] do about becky a certain certain thing
[24:13] and that
[24:14] hannah i don't know what just what to do
[24:16] now
[24:17] and there is something that had come up
[24:19] and she was so
[24:20] nervous she could hardly hold herself
[24:22] together
[24:24] people at the house all night long night
[24:26] on the night before all night
[24:27] until one o'clock in the morning hear
[24:29] people in around the house around the
[24:30] windows
[24:30] and she'd become nervous and she'd
[24:32] become upset so when she was real
[24:34] nervous and she said something to me
[24:36] snappy
[24:37] that she she shouldn't she ought to have
[24:39] said but you see
[24:41] she said like then bill you're you're
[24:42] always gone and i have to take care of
[24:44] these children myself
[24:46] and she said you're never here we can't
[24:48] make decisions together
[24:49] you're either out and gone and she
[24:51] started crying and went in and shut the
[24:52] door right then i said oh
[24:53] poor little fella i said my i ought to
[24:56] and i started out and went out to talk
[24:57] to her
[24:59] and it said in second chronicles it was
[25:00] when miriam rebuked moses for marrying
[25:02] an ethiopian girl
[25:03] be better that her father had spit in
[25:04] her face and to do this and i went back
[25:06] and i said
[25:07] sweetheart you said the wrong thing and
[25:09] she was crying
[25:11] and i said you said the wrong thing
[25:12] honey god is going to make you pay for
[25:14] that you shouldn't have done that
[25:15] i'm all tore up myself uh
[25:18] oh no excuse me she said i'm all tore up
[25:20] myself you shouldn't have said that and
[25:22] she said well bill i just get so tore up
[25:24] and i'm sure she was apologizing and i i
[25:26] just turned and i
[25:28] walked back out because i know she
[25:30] wasn't in the mood to receive it
[25:34] so i went back out and the next act the
[25:36] next examination at the doctor about a
[25:38] month after that showed a tumor
[25:41] and the lord actually spoke to him says
[25:43] because she said that now this is
[25:44] friends listen now
[25:45] and this is not meant to scare anybody
[25:48] this is just to bring reverence in our
[25:49] heart
[25:50] this was a snappy remark she made to her
[25:53] husband
[25:54] and he didn't even get offended by it
[25:57] but god did now i know it's quiet right
[26:00] now but you know what
[26:01] it's a good lesson for all of us that's
[26:03] right because we may offend the lord's
[26:06] spirit
[26:07] more often than we think
[26:10] and this is the reverence that i'm
[26:12] preaching to you to be sensitive to
[26:14] is that and i'm going to get to this at
[26:15] the end the presence
[26:17] that god is not just this bible
[26:21] but he's a person christ the person
[26:25] and if we consider a person then we have
[26:27] to reverence that person's presence
[26:29] when he's around all the time that he's
[26:32] around can you say amen
[26:33] amen and so our treatment of one another
[26:36] how brother bram says how we treat one
[26:37] another is how we treat christ
[26:40] so that's why you have these examples
[26:42] and just
[26:43] reverence for a principle and gaw of god
[26:45] that still stands
[26:47] sometimes one thing is tied to the other
[26:50] and that is a principle
[26:51] that we see here so we see that through
[26:54] the bible so now the aitkin family
[26:56] experienced what to go through in this
[26:58] trouble when they decided to do this
[27:00] and let me just say this why you don't
[27:02] want to put your family
[27:04] in the valley of acor can you say man
[27:07] you won't be blessed you don't want to
[27:10] end up your family the in the valley of
[27:12] acor the valley of trouble and their end
[27:15] was not a good end that's for sure
[27:17] so but the aiken family experienced what
[27:19] it was like to do that now
[27:20] let's read deuteronomy chapter 7.
[27:23] there's a great place here that
[27:25] expounds a little bit on this um a bit
[27:29] we want to get a little bit more
[27:31] specific
[27:33] so god says in deuteronomy 7 here
[27:40] and i got a few scriptures couple
[27:41] scriptures written down that i want to
[27:43] get to but
[27:44] look at this at the beginning when the
[27:45] lord thy god shall bring thee into the
[27:46] land whether thou goes to possess it and
[27:48] hath cast out many nations before thee
[27:50] the hittites the gergashites and the
[27:52] amorites
[27:54] and the canaanites and the perizzites
[27:57] and the hivites and the jebusites
[28:02] and the websites
[28:07] seven nations greater and mightier than
[28:09] thou
[28:10] and when the lord thy god shall deliver
[28:12] them before thee thou shalt smite them
[28:15] and utterly destroy them thou shalt make
[28:17] no covenant with them nor
[28:19] show mercy unto them neither shalt thou
[28:21] make marriages with them thy daughter
[28:23] thou
[28:24] shalt not give unto his son nor his
[28:26] daughter shalt thou his daughter shalt
[28:27] thou take unto thy son so
[28:29] when you go into these places and have
[28:30] to mingle you're going to go in there to
[28:32] take your land
[28:33] but there's going to be such mingling
[28:35] sometimes god's saying i want you to
[28:37] stay separate
[28:39] i want you to stay separate i want you
[28:41] to smite them how do you destroy them
[28:42] show no mercy and don't let your
[28:46] children marry their sons or their
[28:48] daughters so the theme is separation
[28:51] for they will turn away thy son from
[28:52] following me that they may serve other
[28:54] gods
[28:55] so will they anger the lord be kindled
[28:56] against you and destroy the suddenly
[28:58] but thus shall you deal with them you
[29:00] shall destroy their altars
[29:01] break down their images cut down their
[29:03] growths burn their graven images so
[29:05] none of that stuff he wants incorporated
[29:06] into your life he wants you to destroy
[29:08] us
[29:09] all that stuff that they use all the
[29:11] stuff that he the nations use
[29:13] we don't use it
[29:16] for thou and this here's the reason for
[29:19] thou art a holy
[29:20] holy means separate holy means special
[29:23] holy means set apart
[29:25] you are a holy people under the lord thy
[29:28] god the lord thy god had chosen
[29:29] thee to be underlined it a special
[29:33] people unto himself
[29:34] now i don't know what you understand
[29:36] about god's uh
[29:37] god's word about separation but god is a
[29:41] separator
[29:42] amen the first abraham our father the
[29:45] first thing he did
[29:46] was separate him from his family and got
[29:49] him out into his land so god could speak
[29:51] to him
[29:52] amen separation is the first thing god
[29:54] is a separator
[29:56] from anything that keeps us from our
[29:57] promise amen
[29:59] if we eliminate that principle of god we
[30:01] eliminate the access even to the holy
[30:03] ghost
[30:05] because we have to lay our life down and
[30:06] die and separate
[30:08] from all things that would hinder us
[30:10] from receiving the holy spirit
[30:11] that's the first step and so now we see
[30:14] we see there's
[30:15] grave and hymns all these things
[30:16] separate but what's the purpose because
[30:18] you're a special people unto me
[30:20] above all the people that are on the
[30:21] face of the earth the lord did not set
[30:23] his love upon you nor choose you because
[30:25] you were more in number than the people
[30:27] for you were the fewest of all the
[30:28] people but because the lord
[30:30] loved you separation the purpose for it
[30:32] is because
[30:33] you're a special people unto god now
[30:36] listen
[30:37] i didn't say that we're not saying that
[30:39] about ourselves
[30:41] god says it about us you know
[30:44] if we said it too much we get proudful
[30:48] right
[30:51] we would get proud folk to say i'm
[30:53] special
[30:57] but we didn't say it about ourselves god
[31:00] said it about you
[31:01] and his reason for separation is not a
[31:04] reason to
[31:05] to that he wants to make you uh proud
[31:08] for
[31:08] his reason because he loves you and
[31:10] you're a special people that he wants
[31:11] set aside to do something through
[31:14] and because he loves you set his love
[31:16] upon you and because he'd keep his oath
[31:18] with you and all these other things
[31:20] so now the reason for separation is
[31:22] you're special
[31:23] and you're different and he wants your
[31:25] lives untainted
[31:27] by their things that they do he wants it
[31:29] that's why he calls for separation
[31:31] now when we get to this verse 26 and uh
[31:34] yeah verse 25 and 26
[31:36] the graven images of their gods shall be
[31:39] burned with fire thou shalt not desire
[31:41] the silver or gold
[31:43] remember that's what the aiken desire
[31:44] ache and family desire
[31:46] don't desire the silver or gold that is
[31:48] on them oh that is on them
[31:51] thou shalt not desire the silver or gold
[31:53] that is on them
[31:54] nor take it unto thee lest thou be
[31:57] snared therein for it is an abomination
[31:59] to the lord thy god
[32:00] continue on neither shalt thou bring an
[32:03] abomination
[32:04] into thine house lest thou be
[32:07] uh lest thou be a cursed thing like it
[32:10] now here we are in deuteronomy
[32:12] we read later in joshua where the aiken
[32:14] family did this so obviously they
[32:15] ignored
[32:16] what god said here it had already been
[32:19] said obviously
[32:20] they either hadn't read that scripture
[32:21] in a long time or they had read it and
[32:23] ignored it
[32:24] and said that doesn't count anymore that
[32:28] doesn't count in these modern times
[32:29] we're in the inheritance now brother
[32:31] we've moved on we're over in the
[32:32] promised land with joshua now that
[32:34] doesn't count anymore yes it did
[32:37] can i get an amen we're over here man
[32:39] where moses is gone
[32:41] we've moved on to the inheritance here
[32:42] we are now that doesn't count any war
[32:44] yes it does he said it back in
[32:47] deuteronomy and the principle still
[32:49] applied
[32:50] in the promised land and he says
[32:54] take the graven image and don't bring it
[32:56] in the abomination in thine house
[32:58] lest thou be a cursed thing like it but
[33:00] thou shalt utterly detest it
[33:03] and thou shalt utterly abhor it for it
[33:05] is a cursed thing
[33:08] look at that detest of you gotta
[33:10] pray that god so fills you with the holy
[33:12] ghost that you detest
[33:14] things of sin and the things of the
[33:16] world like god does
[33:18] that it actually makes us sick like it
[33:21] does god
[33:22] that's the problem today we don't have
[33:23] enough holy ghost because the things of
[33:25] the world are not making us sick we're
[33:26] actually attracted to them
[33:28] that's right there's a problem with that
[33:30] right when we get the same spirit of god
[33:32] it is his spirit living within us
[33:34] and he hates those things that's why i
[33:37] said if you love
[33:38] he said if you love the world or the the
[33:40] things that are in the world
[33:42] the love of the father is not in you
[33:44] amen the same holy ghost will hate it
[33:47] like god hates it
[33:50] praise the lord you can't have a seminar
[33:52] on hating things of the world
[33:55] you can't do that you can't legislate
[33:57] people into that you can't
[33:58] you can't have a class on that you have
[34:01] to pray for the real holy ghost in your
[34:03] life
[34:03] the baptism of the holy ghost will be
[34:06] your answer to living above sin
[34:08] can i get an amen that's your answer
[34:11] the baptism of the holy ghost anything
[34:13] other than that your life will head back
[34:16] towards the things of the world the only
[34:18] answer is the baptism of the holy ghost
[34:21] graven images means they carved images
[34:24] back then
[34:25] and so the images of curse were made of
[34:28] all their gods
[34:29] but the image brought something into
[34:30] their home that was
[34:32] visible to their eyes so that it
[34:33] reminded them constantly it was all ever
[34:36] before them
[34:37] of all their gods so they carved out
[34:39] these images or they had a molten
[34:41] carter molten image and molten was set
[34:43] it set in a certain
[34:44] you know brass thing to to mold it or
[34:47] they were carved out of wood or other
[34:49] materials
[34:50] and they made an image so that you could
[34:52] have something constantly put
[34:54] in your mind and constantly direct you
[34:57] to all the different
[34:58] gods that people serve so the children
[35:01] of israel were warned against this when
[35:02] they first
[35:03] even come around the heathen and
[35:06] for a time they kept it up but after a
[35:08] while they started to become attracted
[35:10] to these images
[35:12] and these other gods they must have been
[35:14] very i don't know they must have been
[35:16] very attractive on the outside for them
[35:18] to go on the market and say
[35:19] you know what that would look really
[35:22] good in my home
[35:24] that fits the decor
[35:27] because i can't imagine somebody in
[35:29] children of rivers are just saying
[35:30] i want to serve other gods i want to
[35:32] serve their gods i don't think it was
[35:33] always like that
[35:34] i believe that it was some attraction to
[35:36] the outward look of it this really looks
[35:38] good
[35:38] this can't possibly hinder my home but
[35:40] then you realize that's
[35:42] tied to a god can you say amen it it was
[35:44] to all their gods they served
[35:46] and so now the reason they brought it is
[35:48] because they could constantly be
[35:50] reminded they could constantly be
[35:51] looking
[35:52] at that image to remind them of the god
[35:55] that they served
[35:57] something that sat there in their living
[35:59] room
[36:00] and constantly flashed images
[36:04] of the gods people served
[36:12] images of all the gods people serve
[36:17] i wonder if we have anything
[36:22] that's close
[36:25] to something like that today
[36:28] being sarcastic of course
[36:32] i wonder if this generation then we
[36:34] could say that
[36:35] this applies that the actual one of the
[36:38] ten commandments
[36:40] applies today more than ever
[36:44] because they didn't have images like we
[36:47] have them today
[36:48] we have images flashed in front of us
[36:50] constantly
[36:51] not just in our homes but on our phones
[36:54] on our computers it's a continual
[36:58] flashing of images
[36:59] all the time and some of those images
[37:04] in fact a greater portion of them are
[37:06] meant to be there for an intent to grab
[37:08] your mind
[37:09] and draw you into the covetousness that
[37:11] sometimes lays in your heart
[37:13] to cause you to say i want that that's
[37:16] something that i want i want to
[37:17] i want to be so now we have images
[37:20] that's placed in front of us a
[37:22] constant uh uh uh
[37:25] what's the word there's imagery placed
[37:27] in front of us
[37:28] constantly and uh it's placed before us
[37:32] all the time flashing images of all the
[37:34] gods people worship today
[37:36] i wonder if we watch them long enough
[37:39] would we desire their gods too
[37:42] that's what happened to israel
[37:46] but we're different
[37:49] we are no we're the same human beings
[37:52] our heart is built the same way and i
[37:55] wonder if you looked at something long
[37:57] enough and images long enough you'd want
[37:58] it
[37:59] i think so because of the way we're
[38:01] built
[38:02] i want it i want it i want it i want it
[38:06] because why it's placed in a way that
[38:08] it's constantly flashed
[38:09] in front of you
[38:13] it works the same way and i would
[38:14] venture to say
[38:17] well let me say confidently that this
[38:19] scripture just like i said a few months
[38:21] ago about the wisdom of this world
[38:23] in first corinthians one when paul in
[38:25] two and three where paul breaks all that
[38:27] down the distinction in the mind of
[38:28] christ and the wisdom of this world
[38:30] i would say those the scriptures apply
[38:32] more today than they did in paul's day
[38:35] because of the wisdom of the world so
[38:37] being readily available
[38:38] all the time on the world wide web
[38:42] i mean it is thoughts of the wisdom of
[38:45] this world ever before us
[38:47] ever planted in our minds so evermore we
[38:51] should
[38:51] we there never was a time more than we
[38:53] should
[38:54] really value those scriptures because
[38:56] they're more significant today than they
[38:57] were even back then
[38:58] i would say this is another example
[39:00] wouldn't you
[39:02] i would say that the graven image thing
[39:04] and images in front of us that could
[39:06] possibly draw us
[39:07] into worshiping other things and
[39:09] remember an idol is something that comes
[39:11] in between you and god
[39:13] i would say this applies more than it
[39:15] ever has
[39:16] and so i wonder if we watch those things
[39:18] long enough would we desire gods too
[39:20] uh oh no not us not us i'm built
[39:23] different
[39:23] brother paul i i'm a different human
[39:25] being than those back there in the old
[39:27] testament i'm
[39:28] different than the children of israel
[39:30] and yet the images and the gods
[39:34] displayed before us immorality
[39:38] illicit sex bodies of women
[39:42] the naked bodies of women half-dressed
[39:45] women
[39:46] the gods of covetedness the gods of uh
[39:50] adultery is placed before us fornication
[39:53] fornicating situations constantly people
[39:57] sleeping with one another constantly
[39:58] and it's just presumed that's normal
[40:00] life the wisdom of the world is flashed
[40:02] before us
[40:04] and and the image of a new improved
[40:08] cool jesus is placed in those images as
[40:11] well right
[40:12] to attract somebody who's looking for
[40:13] that
[40:15] the image of a of a church that we could
[40:18] go to
[40:19] that has the image of a new improved
[40:22] cool
[40:22] jesus becomes attracted to millions of
[40:26] people that fill
[40:27] mega churches images attract him
[40:33] and it's all they're visible and it's
[40:35] constantly flashed before the people you
[40:37] want religion we've got this you want
[40:38] this
[40:40] you want you want the new status car
[40:42] it's just flashed constantly
[40:44] in car commercials to where someone goes
[40:47] and gets it and
[40:48] they have to live with constant car
[40:50] commercials again that
[40:51] a few days later they're wondering if
[40:53] they bought the right one
[40:56] because there's a new model it's a
[40:58] constant
[40:59] worship of bowing down to things
[41:02] other than our god come on now let's be
[41:06] honest the preachers
[41:09] tell it like it is tonight we don't like
[41:12] to hear it sometimes but we're like
[41:14] those human beings in the old testament
[41:16] we're not built any different when it
[41:18] comes to a human being and so these
[41:20] scriptures apply and he said the way to
[41:23] deal with that is that
[41:24] if that's one of those images set no
[41:26] evil thing before you
[41:28] and he says don't bring it into your
[41:31] place because it's a cursed thing to
[41:32] test it
[41:33] utterly abhor it for it is truly a curse
[41:36] thing
[41:36] amen so prayer
[41:40] having the thought will this affect us
[41:43] because friends we live in a time that
[41:44] and you know what there's some families
[41:46] that decide not to have any
[41:48] any uh bit of uh movies or anything in
[41:50] their home
[41:51] i respect that and i i i thank god for
[41:54] it
[41:54] i don't think we should ever criticize
[41:55] anybody who does that right that's a
[41:57] wonderful thing
[41:58] they're not uh weirdos that's right
[42:02] they might be a little stronger than you
[42:05] but i had brother tell me last year said
[42:07] you know what some of that stuff is all
[42:09] some of that stuff's hope
[42:10] wholesome is good he said but i know me
[42:12] and i know my kids
[42:13] and we're just better just to go without
[42:14] any of it
[42:16] but then you got some that make choices
[42:18] about wholesome things
[42:20] i like to have the high standard if i
[42:21] can and you know i have kids and so i
[42:23] have the pressures of stuff
[42:25] trying to creep in sometimes and uh you
[42:28] know but i i like to see
[42:30] i like something that happened like
[42:32] history or something that reflects our
[42:34] values
[42:34] something that sends a strong message of
[42:37] of
[42:38] christianity or something that's
[42:39] wholesome or something you can
[42:41] sometimes laugh with but it sends a
[42:43] strong message i like to keep the
[42:44] standard up high because i know my flesh
[42:46] too
[42:47] is that i would easily sway into things
[42:49] that are not
[42:50] not valuable things sorry
[42:53] sorry i'm just being honest with you
[42:54] tonight maybe you're you know maybe you
[43:00] have reached a plateau or something i
[43:02] don't know or
[43:03] but some people they'll incorporate
[43:06] certain things in our home
[43:07] here's the principle here's the
[43:08] principle
[43:10] you must pray and you must think about
[43:13] what effect this would have
[43:15] does this reflect what the presence of
[43:18] the lord
[43:19] uh does this does this invite the
[43:22] presence of the lord or is this going to
[43:24] send away the presence of the lord
[43:27] just that simple praise the lord
[43:32] and some of you young people will have
[43:34] to make that decision pretty soon when
[43:35] you get married yourself
[43:38] so you can't depend on the decisions of
[43:40] mom and dad you say lord say lord i want
[43:42] to be filled with your spirit
[43:44] and i want to make decisions daily that
[43:47] are pleasing in your sight
[43:51] so it says don't bring those images in
[43:54] your house constantly before your eyes
[43:56] all the time and your children's why
[43:58] it's cursed
[43:58] and we've seen what the aiken family
[44:00] weather did now let's
[44:02] switch to our text if you'd go back to
[44:05] that in first chronicles 13.
[44:08] let's switch to the obedium family we've
[44:12] talked enough about the aitkin family
[44:14] let's talk about the obaditum family say
[44:16] that with me obadidam
[44:18] you know you might not be saying it
[44:20] right because i just taught you it
[44:24] but for tonight it's the obedient family
[44:27] okay obedient i couldn't find the
[44:30] translation how to
[44:32] whatever that's called where you figure
[44:34] out each thing in the the
[44:37] the what pronunciation of it
[44:40] i can't even pronounce pronunciation
[44:42] can't even say that
[44:45] but the obadinum family is a positive
[44:48] story because here we find in first
[44:50] chronicles
[44:51] uh a great thing and that is first
[44:54] chronicles let's turn there again first
[44:56] verse 13. that is that when this ark was
[45:00] kind of here they're trying to bring the
[45:02] art back
[45:03] and uh when they're bringing it back
[45:06] david has his situation where there it
[45:08] wasn't
[45:08] the will of god for him to bring it back
[45:10] that way and we could go into that
[45:12] tonight um
[45:13] you know under the message uh there was
[45:15] the great revelation of chapter 13 of
[45:17] first chronicles was revealed in the
[45:18] last days
[45:20] by the message doing god a service
[45:21] without his will that chapter i believe
[45:23] was really brought out and light was
[45:26] shed upon it in a way that really
[45:28] applies to
[45:28] today as well so you should read that
[45:30] you should pray with that message
[45:32] because it's wonderful david wanted the
[45:34] ark
[45:34] it was a pure desire it was a sincere
[45:36] desire
[45:37] but he made some mistakes how he
[45:39] approached the ark and how he brought
[45:41] the ark
[45:42] and so the private taught us that
[45:44] something can be the right thing but
[45:45] it's got to be the will of god
[45:48] we got to work within the true will of
[45:49] god it looks like something well we need
[45:52] to do something we need to do something
[45:53] but is it the will of god
[45:54] so it teaches us that and it teaches us
[45:56] that the word and how it
[45:57] they brought it on a new cart and he
[45:59] wasn't supposed to bring it on a new car
[46:01] it teaches us that the priesthood have
[46:02] to handle the word and someone else
[46:04] reached up there in touch and an
[46:06] innocent man died because they were
[46:08] doing things outside of
[46:09] the way that god's order had for
[46:12] carrying the ark
[46:13] so all that story is there and so but
[46:14] they finish up here
[46:16] and uh what happens is that david didn't
[46:18] want to take it to his house
[46:20] so he gives it to the obadin family and
[46:23] the oba needham family take this ark
[46:25] into their home
[46:27] and they they welcomed it and the bible
[46:30] says that
[46:31] david brought not the ark home to
[46:32] himself in the city of david but carried
[46:34] aside into the house of adam the get
[46:36] diet and the ark of god remained with
[46:38] the family of obadim in his house three
[46:39] months
[46:40] and the lord blessed the house of
[46:42] obadidom in all
[46:44] that he had now the ark represents
[46:47] not only just the word of god
[46:50] but what came with that ark was the
[46:53] presence of god
[46:56] so omadeedom's house their family became
[47:00] blessed
[47:01] because this ark was in their home i say
[47:04] praise god because
[47:05] obviously here he's a gentile i believe
[47:07] he's one of the 600
[47:08] men the gentile warriors that came with
[47:10] david to make him king
[47:11] and so here is a a gentile family
[47:15] here's a family that wasn't really in
[47:17] the children of israel
[47:18] and we would think that's not going to
[47:20] work for them no that's a there's
[47:21] we got a monopoly on this thing and it
[47:23] only works in the children of israel
[47:25] well this proved that it wasn't true and
[47:27] i believe with all my heart when the
[47:28] presence of god and the word of god
[47:30] is truly welcome in a home it brings the
[47:33] presence of god in
[47:35] and that family becomes blessed
[47:38] i don't care who they are amen there's a
[47:41] blessing that goes with it
[47:44] if you welcome him and i mean really
[47:46] welcoming and i want to talk tonight
[47:48] before we close
[47:49] in a few minutes about welcoming not
[47:51] just the word because i've been
[47:52] preaching about blessed families having
[47:54] the word we went back to deuteronomy 7
[47:56] the mandate that it gives to parents
[47:57] that we're supposed to teach the
[47:58] children the word of god
[48:00] talk about what moses said talk about
[48:02] the laws of moses talk about all the
[48:03] principles you brought
[48:04] talk about them when you get up talk
[48:05] about it when you go to bed talk about
[48:07] them in the afternoon talk about them at
[48:08] work
[48:09] plant them upon the doorposts of your
[48:10] house put them everywhere put them in
[48:12] front of your kids all the time
[48:13] talk about them talk about them till
[48:15] you're out of breath
[48:17] that was the principle it's not just
[48:19] they hear it at sunday school
[48:22] but integrate the word in their life so
[48:23] we've been talking about that but this
[48:25] ark represents more than just teaching
[48:27] them the bible and the word
[48:29] this is the presence of god amen
[48:32] and this is actually even more important
[48:35] i would say more important because you
[48:36] could teach
[48:37] the word of god all the time to your
[48:39] kids and not be inviting the presence
[48:42] that goes with the word
[48:45] what our children need to see is which i
[48:47] preached on sunday
[48:48] is a manifestation of the reality of god
[48:52] not head knowledge not intellectual
[48:54] things of the word
[48:55] not a code to live by but the real jesus
[48:58] christ that they could really get a hold
[49:00] of
[49:01] his presence because it is the presence
[49:03] he is a person
[49:04] the word this is just to help us to
[49:06] introduce us to the person
[49:08] i believe the message was to help us
[49:10] introduce us to the person
[49:11] but once we meet the person can you say
[49:13] amen we want to know him more
[49:16] we want to stay in his presence so it's
[49:19] not about the bible's just being there
[49:21] up on the shelf
[49:22] and we say we believe that bible
[49:24] children and we're going to take it down
[49:25] and we're going to read it to you and
[49:26] this is what god means this is what he
[49:28] says
[49:28] but there's a heart that says god make
[49:31] that presence real to my children and
[49:33] family
[49:35] and that's what it means by bringing the
[49:36] ark and their family obedium family
[49:39] for three months was having a good time
[49:43] because they got to have the ark of the
[49:44] covenant can you imagine
[49:46] the ark of the covenant i've got a
[49:48] little one in my office back there
[49:50] i love it my wife bought it for me but
[49:52] they had the actual
[49:53] ark of the covenant in their home
[49:56] for three months and everything for
[49:59] those three months in their life
[50:01] was blessed somebody say praise the lord
[50:05] somebody give a handclap to the lord
[50:08] praise the lord and that's when we
[50:12] invite his presence into our homes
[50:14] when we make him as the person welcome
[50:16] in our homes
[50:17] when he doesn't then everything becomes
[50:19] blessed in our lives
[50:21] and we get over our troubles easier
[50:23] don't we we get through our trials
[50:25] easier because he's welcome in our home
[50:28] he's welcome now i'm going to have some
[50:30] specifics
[50:31] to what it means to bring his presence
[50:34] in our home that
[50:35] you may get a little uncomfortable with
[50:36] i probably won't have time to bring him
[50:38] tonight but
[50:38] i'd like to through this series be more
[50:40] practical
[50:41] and say what we need to do and what we
[50:44] need to say
[50:45] and what we need to not set amen
[50:49] amen to welcome the presence of god in
[50:52] our homes
[50:54] praise the lord this the fat the
[50:57] the obedient family i
[51:00] i'm jealous they got the actual
[51:05] covenant ark of the covenant to be there
[51:08] in their home
[51:09] for three months and so
[51:14] um they welcome the right thing in their
[51:16] home and this is a simple principle to
[51:18] catch
[51:18] they welcome the right thing in their
[51:19] home and it was blessed and they made a
[51:21] home for the word
[51:23] and everything pertaining to them was
[51:24] blessed you know there are choices that
[51:26] we make as a family
[51:29] choices where the word is welcome and
[51:31] his presence is welcome and choices
[51:32] where his presence is not welcome
[51:35] and his word is not taught but it's not
[51:38] just the word as i said his
[51:39] presence comes with it he is a person
[51:42] his
[51:42] ark is his presence coming
[51:46] his ark is his presence being real to us
[51:49] how many want to invite his presence
[51:51] how many want to just not just invite
[51:53] his presence into your home
[51:55] into your life but also make him feel
[51:57] welcome
[51:59] remember the pharisees that invited
[52:00] jesus to the the party there
[52:03] but they invited him but he wasn't
[52:05] welcome remember the woman went down and
[52:07] washed his feet with her hair
[52:09] she not only invited him but she made
[52:11] him feel welcome they didn't wash his
[52:13] feet
[52:14] they didn't treat him like he was
[52:15] anybody you're just you know we just
[52:16] invited you that's good enough
[52:18] but we want to make jesus welcome
[52:22] in these houses in our houses at home
[52:25] larry christianson wrote a book on the
[52:26] christian family here many many years
[52:28] ago
[52:30] and there's one paragraph here a couple
[52:32] paragraphs
[52:33] uh that i'd like to read in closing
[52:35] tonight
[52:36] and uh he brings out a really good point
[52:38] on this particular line here
[52:42] first part of his book dealt with uh
[52:45] cultivating
[52:46] the order of god because god has an
[52:48] order for everything god's a god of
[52:50] order
[52:50] god's not the author of confusion the
[52:52] first part of the book he says he talks
[52:54] about the order there's an order for a
[52:55] man a husband
[52:57] there's an order for woman it's a
[52:58] different order than man from the woman
[53:00] can you say amen
[53:01] god has an order and you'll be blessed
[53:03] in that order there's an order for a man
[53:04] there's an order for a woman
[53:06] god has an order for the children a
[53:07] divine order uh
[53:09] he has an order for the family he has an
[53:11] order for the church
[53:12] we have church order here praise the
[53:15] lord a lot of it has been set up by the
[53:17] prophet of the last days and encouraged
[53:18] us to do certain things to keep
[53:20] church order we appreciate those things
[53:22] why because god is a god of order he set
[53:24] the order for the age
[53:25] and so now we find in this divine order
[53:27] he says we set the beginning that the
[53:29] secret of a good family is simply to
[53:31] cultivate
[53:31] the family's relationship with jesus
[53:34] christ
[53:35] that's a really good statement that the
[53:37] the
[53:38] the secret of a good family life is to
[53:40] cultivate the family's relationship
[53:42] with jesus i'd say that's pretty good i
[53:44] say that's our goal
[53:47] to have a family constantly cultivating
[53:49] a relationship with jesus christ
[53:52] we begin with the consideration of
[53:53] divine order but divine order alone
[53:56] is not enough as god's order begins to
[53:58] shape the outward form of
[54:00] a family's life the presence of jesus
[54:03] must be given false way to transform
[54:05] the inner life and here's where we face
[54:07] a fundamental problem
[54:09] and friends both of those things are
[54:11] important
[54:12] we have watched through the years where
[54:14] the order of the outside was
[54:16] emphasized so much that somebody forgot
[54:20] the the the change of the inside that's
[54:24] right
[54:26] but but we can't just go it's just a
[54:29] change on the inside and that's it
[54:30] and there's no order to it that's not
[54:32] true either that's right
[54:34] they both work in harmony together
[54:36] they're both important especially for
[54:38] the family
[54:39] so as god's order begins to shape the
[54:41] outward form of family life the presence
[54:43] of jesus must be given the false way
[54:44] to transform the inner life and here's
[54:46] where we face a fundamental problem
[54:48] precisely what do we mean by the
[54:50] presence of jesus just how does a family
[54:52] live together with jesus christ
[54:54] our little niece martha was about three
[54:56] years old when she reported a simple
[54:58] and profound discovery to her
[55:00] grandmother she pointed to a picture of
[55:03] jesus on the wall and said
[55:04] that's jesus i say hi to him
[55:08] but he doesn't say hi back to me
[55:11] her sister nancy younger by a year
[55:14] picked up the thought and de
[55:15] and proclaimed at the table one day
[55:18] jesus
[55:19] jesus jesus that's all i hear about here
[55:22] but he don't say nothing that's what the
[55:24] little three-year-old said
[55:26] i can't say it like she said it jesus
[55:29] jesus
[55:30] jesus that's all i hear about but he
[55:31] don't say nothing
[55:34] with the innocent candor of childhood
[55:36] they put their finger on a deep mystery
[55:38] and paradox of christian faith
[55:40] christian faith is a personal
[55:42] relationship with jesus
[55:44] but jesus does not behave like an
[55:47] ordinary person
[55:49] we think he's a person i'm telling these
[55:50] young people who's a person here tonight
[55:52] well where is he
[55:53] some of them in their childlike way
[55:55] would say okay where is he
[55:57] if he's a person like your person
[55:58] brother paul then where is he then
[56:01] so we may not be able to interact on
[56:04] that same level when we call him a
[56:06] person like that
[56:06] but he is a person
[56:10] invisible as he may be he is a person
[56:16] he doesn't come around so i can see him
[56:17] he doesn't speak to me he doesn't write
[56:19] me any
[56:20] letters he doesn't call me up on the
[56:21] telephone a person is someone i can talk
[56:23] to
[56:23] and be with but he doesn't say nothing
[56:25] it is not that the child is a skeptic
[56:27] he is simply a realist he hears jesus
[56:31] talked about as a person
[56:32] in prayers he hears jesus addressed as a
[56:34] person so he expects jesus to behave
[56:37] like a person
[56:38] but time after time this does not take
[56:39] place so as the child grows older he
[56:42] begins to accommodate his thinking to
[56:43] the actual experience
[56:45] jesus was a person on earth long ago
[56:48] one day we will meet him in heaven as a
[56:51] person but in the meantime
[56:52] he don't say nothing
[56:56] a personal relationship with jesus
[56:58] alternates between nostalgia and hope
[57:01] but does not touch down in here and now
[57:03] in the here and now
[57:05] so if the truth were known many adults
[57:07] would confess the same sense of
[57:09] puzzlement and frustration voiced by
[57:10] children
[57:11] they know about jesus and they truly
[57:13] believe in him yet the experience of a
[57:15] distinct personal relationship
[57:17] is vague and lacking and that's because
[57:19] there's a lack of an experience with him
[57:22] why is it for instance that so a few
[57:24] christians can speak simply and
[57:25] confidently of having experienced
[57:26] clearly
[57:27] clear guidance from the lord in the
[57:28] matter of their own life many even
[57:30] protest
[57:31] piously that it is presumptuous to think
[57:33] that we can know the specific will of
[57:35] god
[57:36] you see so i could read and read more
[57:38] and more and i just want to get to the
[57:39] back here because
[57:40] our time is running out but i think it's
[57:42] a great presentation to see it from a
[57:44] child's eyes
[57:45] and a child's understanding is to
[57:48] realize if we call them a person then
[57:50] we you know they want to be able to
[57:53] experience it like a person that they
[57:54] know
[57:56] he is a person and he's so real
[58:00] that we can invite him into our lives
[58:02] and in our homes in such a way
[58:04] that i believe that we can feel his
[58:06] presence and there can be
[58:08] identifications
[58:09] to the child as they grow how god
[58:12] is real if parents are the parents of
[58:16] faith
[58:16] and they live by faith and they make the
[58:18] priority
[58:19] god in their lives not just the word but
[58:21] his presence in their life
[58:23] those children will see through
[58:25] financial troubles
[58:26] through trials through things that they
[58:29] call upon through prayers that they ask
[58:31] and god comes through they see hey
[58:34] there is a person here there is an
[58:38] there is a a presence that's present
[58:41] with us beyond just our family here
[58:44] sitting down for dinner
[58:45] we're addressing someone that is real
[58:47] can you say amen
[58:49] so it's about that's what the ark was
[58:51] about as they experience
[58:53] not just that being there but the
[58:55] presence that goes with it i think
[58:57] that's that's what that type
[58:58] speaks of that's what it shows now i
[59:01] just read a couple other things if we
[59:02] could
[59:05] ways that we can do this
[59:09] presenting god to our children through
[59:11] example
[59:12] said hear o israel the lord our god is
[59:13] one lord and you shall love the lord
[59:15] your god
[59:16] with all your heart with your soul with
[59:17] all your might if you live that in front
[59:19] of your kids that's probably enough in
[59:21] itself
[59:22] that you live so passionately that you
[59:24] love him with all your heart soul mind
[59:25] and strength
[59:27] the familiar passage of scripture is
[59:29] actually the beginning of an instruction
[59:30] to parents
[59:30] note that it begins by describing the
[59:32] attitude which the parents themselves
[59:34] have towards god
[59:35] the lord knew that without a fundamental
[59:37] love towards god
[59:38] on the part of the parents their
[59:39] teaching of the children would be hollow
[59:41] and base
[59:42] the starting point and the foundation
[59:44] for the priesthood of parents
[59:46] is the parent's own love excuse me and
[59:48] this is the parents
[59:49] their own love and their own devotion to
[59:51] god if parents do not have a living
[59:53] relationship with jesus
[59:54] they cannot hope to convey such a
[59:56] relationship to their children is the
[59:57] parents relationship to the lord one of
[59:59] dry rules and regulations
[1:00:01] a stern moralism and nothing more
[1:00:06] a dreary round of religious duties and
[1:00:08] exercises
[1:00:09] evoking little excitement and nothing of
[1:00:11] real joy
[1:00:13] a thin veneer that is tacked on the
[1:00:15] outside mainly for show
[1:00:18] children are far more perceptive in
[1:00:20] spiritual matters than adults sometimes
[1:00:22] realize
[1:00:22] they do not respond merely to words and
[1:00:25] formal beliefs of parents
[1:00:26] they sense the inner spirit of their
[1:00:28] faith
[1:00:29] and that is what they react to
[1:00:31] oftentimes young people who rebel
[1:00:32] against the christian faith
[1:00:34] are not rebelling against god at all
[1:00:35] they have never had the actual encounter
[1:00:38] with god
[1:00:38] with the living god to rebel against it
[1:00:41] so they're not rebelling against god
[1:00:42] they're revealing
[1:00:43] rebelling against how god was presented
[1:00:45] to them
[1:00:46] no do we have a lot of cases of that
[1:00:48] even going on now
[1:00:50] have a lot of grace and prayer for
[1:00:52] people that are even leaving this
[1:00:53] message
[1:00:54] because i think a lot of them they got
[1:00:56] the wrong perception of what the message
[1:00:58] is
[1:00:58] through their parents or through a
[1:01:00] church
[1:01:01] and so it's a reaction to say now the
[1:01:04] message is all wrong
[1:01:05] it's not true but you've got to pray
[1:01:07] with that and be careful that there's
[1:01:09] been people that's done that big circle
[1:01:10] where they've been under a really uh
[1:01:14] uh dict dictator type
[1:01:18] ministry in the message just just an
[1:01:20] abuse a mental abuse
[1:01:23] preaching the very message but a spirit
[1:01:25] of dictatorship the spirit of
[1:01:26] nicolaitanism
[1:01:28] and they're on that for years they've
[1:01:29] been mentally abused by it
[1:01:31] when they leave it's just like i don't
[1:01:33] want to hear the term message in my life
[1:01:35] they become vic
[1:01:35] vindictive they're just i'm out of here
[1:01:37] i'm finished with it
[1:01:38] go away and then all of a sudden
[1:01:41] something comes around and there's story
[1:01:42] after story about this friends
[1:01:44] all of a sudden now they come around and
[1:01:47] and through some
[1:01:49] some source they're able to build the
[1:01:51] value back
[1:01:52] of what god blessed us with in the last
[1:01:55] days
[1:01:55] and it's not tainted anymore by how they
[1:01:58] were raised or what church they were in
[1:02:07] and when there's a true baptism of the
[1:02:09] holy ghost i'll say it again
[1:02:11] that's the answer that's the answer
[1:02:16] they sense the inner spirit of faith and
[1:02:18] that is what they react to oftentimes
[1:02:20] young people
[1:02:21] who rebel against christian faith are
[1:02:23] not rebelling against god they have
[1:02:24] never had an actual encounter with the
[1:02:26] living god to rebel against it they are
[1:02:27] rebelling against the dead
[1:02:28] religious formalism which merely imposed
[1:02:31] upon them
[1:02:31] a certain set of rules or rituals
[1:02:34] parents who want their children to know
[1:02:35] god
[1:02:36] must cultivate their own rel their own
[1:02:38] relationship with god
[1:02:39] first and foremost this means a life of
[1:02:41] prayer
[1:02:42] because when you're praying you're
[1:02:44] saying to those children and that family
[1:02:46] daddy when you're praying all the time
[1:02:48] about things
[1:02:50] you're recognizing first of all you're
[1:02:51] under headship but you recognize your
[1:02:53] dependence on god and there's another
[1:02:55] presence i'm talking to all the time
[1:02:57] amen what a what a powerful effect that
[1:03:01] leaves
[1:03:03] and not just saying you know at the
[1:03:05] table some
[1:03:06] quick prayer and that's all the time
[1:03:08] that's the only time to hear daddy pray
[1:03:09] is to pray for the food
[1:03:11] that's the only prayer to pray for the
[1:03:12] food
[1:03:14] you know there are other things to pray
[1:03:16] about
[1:03:20] i'm having a good time tonight some of
[1:03:21] you aren't i tell that but i
[1:03:24] can't make some of you laugh for the
[1:03:25] life of me
[1:03:27] so now no amount of moral instruction
[1:03:31] firm discipline religious instruction or
[1:03:33] church going
[1:03:34] can make up for the lack of a praying
[1:03:36] parent
[1:03:37] this is well said amen for it is
[1:03:40] preeminently
[1:03:41] in and through prayer that we passed the
[1:03:42] realm of theory into the realm of
[1:03:44] reality
[1:03:45] and personal experience how can we
[1:03:48] convince our children that god is
[1:03:49] important
[1:03:50] if we never give him any of our time how
[1:03:52] can we pretend to love him when we
[1:03:54] scarcely spend a minute with him alone
[1:03:57] our children may dutifully learn our
[1:03:59] rituals and chant their meal time grace
[1:04:01] grace god is great
[1:04:02] god is good god is great let us take
[1:04:04] thank him for this foot
[1:04:07] but down in their heart where the real
[1:04:09] attitudes are formed are prayerlessness
[1:04:12] excuse me prayerless lives have taught
[1:04:15] another message
[1:04:16] god is great but he can wait
[1:04:19] gotta hurry or i'll be late
[1:04:24] god is great but he can wait i gotta
[1:04:26] hurry or i'll be late
[1:04:28] happy the child happy the child who
[1:04:31] happens in upon his parent from time to
[1:04:33] time to see him on his knees
[1:04:34] who sees mother and father rising
[1:04:36] earlier going aside regularly to keep
[1:04:38] times with the lord that child has
[1:04:40] learned
[1:04:42] a lesson no lecture could impart he has
[1:04:45] seen
[1:04:46] that god matters
[1:04:49] he's important enough to take up our
[1:04:52] time
[1:04:52] and he is personal you don't just obey
[1:04:55] his rules
[1:04:56] you actually communicate with him who's
[1:05:00] bringing the word
[1:05:02] let's stand together well said
[1:05:07] you can say amen to that end say amen to
[1:05:09] larry christensen
[1:05:15] i love the lord so much don't you
[1:05:16] tonight
