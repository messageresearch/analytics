got to trample the blood climb over the cross no it's easy to stray there is a cross in your there is a cross in your way oh all of mercy and Grace there's just one way your soul can be lost got to trample the blood climb over the [Music] cross no it's not easy to stray there is a cross in your [Music] way no it's not easy to stray there is a cross in your way 1 Corinthians 13:12 and 13 for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known and now abideth faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is Charity I want to title this the bride shall know him as she is known the bride shall know when I say shall know know it's because there's a prophecy and it'll be this time that the bride shall know Christ the bride shall know him as she is known prophecy of Paul saying that at that day he's he's saying now for we see through a glass in the first church age we see through a glass we see Christ through a glass but then face to face and so we know that that's a per prophecy also he mentions that in verse 10 if you're looking when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away so that is a prophecy there'll be a coming day when that which is perfect will come and that that which is in part shall be done away I personally believe that there's enough Vindication to show that we're in that day when that which is perfect has come we just want to Echo what we said on Sunday about this knowing him face to face and the bride coming to know him in a face to face relationship and I'll just say it this way that if our vision of Christ is limited if we have a a limited which Paul describes here as a dark glass or seeing through a glass Darkly seeing through a window that's faded or a window that doesn't give the full picture Christ is on the other side and it's not clear through the window because it's it's through a glass Darkly and that's the simplest way to explain that's how they looked through this glass Darkly to see Christ and when we're look at them that way it's it's a wonderful thing but he says there'll be come a day when we'll have a face-to-face relationship with Christ not through a glass Darkly can you say manam and so if our but here's the point if the if our vision of Christ is limited if we see through a glass Darkly then other things are limited and we have a partial revelation of Christ throughout the ages they had a partial Revelation and the the wonderful thing about the Believers in God who were had the Holy Ghost in every age they connected with what Christ was doing in that hour his word for that hour and when they connected with that they they lived it they believed it with all their heart that even though it was a partial revelation of Christ they gave their all to it some of them gave their lives to it do you know that those Believers that were beheaded and given their lives for the gospel of Christ they did all that and sacrificed their life knowing very little of the of the character of Christ knowing very little of what we enjoy today of what Christ and yet they gave their lives for it I'd say that if we know that this much of Christ in this hour and we're blessed with so much re word revealed to us then we ought to give our all to it you got brothers and sisters you're going to shake hands with when you get on the other side and I'll tell you I'm going to feel humbled to be in front of them because they gave their lives and they only had a partial revelation of Christ they didn't know them like we're blessed to know him today but they gave their lives for it they gave their all to it we should give our all to it can you say Amen a partial Revelation uh will tend to make our love partial as well as what we said Sunday a partial revelation will make our love partial and uh I want you to I want just to bring back some scriptures again related to the subject that partiality in the body of Christ shouldn't be there looking at one another and showing partiality with one another shouldn't be happening it happens in the world it happens in schools it it it happens in business can you say man there people are partial to different ones and they're they're partisan and all these other things but within the Holy Ghost kingdom of God the partiality should go away and we should look at one another Through The Eyes of Christ and we shouldn't just have favorites can you say man and look down on other ones and try to judge each other but when we're looking through this glass and see Christ then he sees us without partiality so we should see one another that way so we have when we have a limited view in the face of Christ if we have a limited view then we're going to be limited in how this love comes out from us to others and that's the uh point that I was going to bring Sunday and so as Believers we cannot be partial in judgment or in our treatment of others we can't be partial in our treatment with others if you haven't learned anything from this uh excellent Way series you I would say if you learn it you you should learn this that we are to react to everyone in the love of Christ the same way and and the treatment of other people they deserve to be treated with the love of Christ and given the love of Christ and and I'm not talking about compromising because you have to tell the truth love is rooted in truth but but when we're treating people wrong uh because we think they're less that doesn't belong in the body of Christ we should treat one you know hey everybody wants to be treated right how many raise your hand I like to be treated right I like to be treated with respect and uh you know no nobody likes to be abused whether it's mental or verbal or physical abuse uh sexual abuse that's a disrespect to the human being and so none of us like to be disrespected whe whether it's an attitude coming we we like to be treated right and if there ever is a place that you see the treatment of one another with high respect and love and you may disagree but the the the respect and the treatment of one another and and feelings and love for one another it should be resident Among Us and when it's not I would just say this safely when it's not happening somebody is not looking into the face of Christ correctly there's a there's a story that I remember a quick little story about Leonardo deiny uh d viny as he's painting the face of Christ and I've mentioned this before but there's a story that when he was painting the face of Christ on the the painting he was doing of the last supper and he was there and he was intently just working on the face of Christ and uh Leonardo he got angry at one of his servants and he lashed out at him he just lashed out he got upset they had done something wrong and so he pulled away from uh painting the face of Christ and he just got real mad and he lashed that out at him and then he went back to and he and he he says he could not he was stumbling and and struggling to go back to fa painting the face of Christ he had trouble with it and he he tried and he couldn't do it he tried he couldn't do it and there was too much evil just stirring within him and his anger and he had a lack of peace and that lack of peace made him throw down his brushes go and find that servant that boy and ask forgiveness from him just effective he could not paint the F of face of Christ and have that feeling within him now that's just a natural thing it's just a natural story but I think it says something to us of what I'm trying to minister on that there's something about when we're when we're looking into him and looking at him through the word of God and we're keeping focused on him makes it very difficult to hate one another am why because we're being changed into looking at the way Christ sees it right so we can kind of tell in our lives when we're not in the face of Christ enough we become affected so by so many other carnal things but when we're looking at him so he I just finished in the story he went and asked forgiveness and and then only through asking forgiveness and prayer did Leonardo did he did he have an inner calm and settle down enough to go back to painting the face of Christ he settled down because he asked forgiveness hello he asked forgiveness and he he he went to prayer and that's the type of things that relieves anger that's the type of things that relieves and so he did that and then he could calm down in order order to go back and paint the face of Christ First Timothy 5:19 says against it in this whole partiality thing and showing us it's not it doesn't belong Among Us within the church church people and Believers 1 Timothy 5:19 against an elder receive not an accusation but but before two or three Witnesses so it's very important that Among Us that we be careful when an accusation comes against an elder and for that matter for anybody that's a member of the body of Christ it's very important we don't just accept that and take it as truth right and and so now notice the subject of partiality notice the subject of of waiting to see the whole picture of things not judging on partiality not judging on seeing it oh somebody made an accusation somebody gos somebody put an elder down somebody put a pastor down somebody put an elder in the church down we are we are taught in the scripture we are not to receive that just like that but out of the mouth of two or three Witnesses what in other words we're waiting to see if it's the truth before we believe it that's maturity in the body of Christ you don't just accept gossip you don't just take it as the final Authority because that's being partial in your judgment right and we're not supposed to be partial in our judgment we're not supposed to take half truths about somebody no none of us like that about us being said about us so in maturity we're not taking half truths about what we hear but before two or three Witnesses it goes deeper when it says in verse 20 them that sin rebuke before all that others also May fear now that's a strong scripture and I've never heard too many uh pastors talk about it nevertheless it is in the scripture that Among Us them that sin rebuke before All That Others May fear I can't help but think it's in this same subject of partiality it's in this same subject we'll be real harsh on somebody here and somebody over here we won't be as harsh on and we have to be careful about partiality in our judgment here it says rebuke before All That Others May fear fear because all of us are under the same Holy Spirit and and the word is the same and so in that theme then he says verse 21 I charge thee before God and for the Lord J and and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect Angels is pretty serious that thou observe these things without preferring one before another doing nothing by partiality doesn't belong Among Us how many would just say that's that's good that's a good lesson for me that's the way it's supposed to function that you I say this before the elect angels and before the Lord Jesus Christ observe these things without preferring one before another without partiality and then it's echoed in again in James 2:2 if you want to bring it up James 2:2 said my brethren have not the Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ the lord of Glory with respect to persons for if there come unto your assembly a man with the gold ring in go goodly apparel and there come also a poor man in Vile rment rment so in our day you know one comes in he's got all the rich clothes clothes on he he buys the very best he's got the very best of jewelry or she does and they're dressed really great maybe they're got a position in the in the uh in the county or in this or they're a mayor or something like that they're dressed good they drive drove the Mercedes in and then you got another guy gets out of his truck in overalls and he comes in and he stinks and he doesn't look that great and so our own human nature of this world is to judge them based upon those things we shouldn't do that and ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing come on in and say unto him sit thou here in a good place and give them the best place at the potluck and sit up close to the food and be the first in line and say to the poor stand back over here and sit here under my foot stol are you th not then partial in yourselves and are become judges of evil thoughts so it's it's related to now if we do not I'm getting back to seeing the face of Christ when we're looking at him then we see him the right way and his love flows through and the partiality it is grown because why if we if we see him impartial then we'll look at one another partially as I said Sunday he doesn't look up at us with a partial Revelation aren't you glad he knows us fully and not only does he knows know our weakness and what we were born in our first birth actually uh he knows us in our new birth and he knows us they're son we're a Son of God from the foundation of the world does God see you does God know you God knows you amen God knows who you really are God knew who you really were before you knew who you really were that's true and and so now that's why he can love you with a predestinated elect of love because he knows he really knows who you really are you take people a lifetime to figure out who they are sometimes and they the identity crisis and trying to be everybody else young people do that when they're young they're trying to be everybody else and we always preach to them find your IDE identity in the word of God and actually by looking into the face of Christ and his word you find who you really are because it's a revealing it's a knowing this Christianity this this message is an identity that we get to know how God made us what he made us for why he sent us what he sent us here to do can you say this message is a revealing of our true identity and the true identity of Christ and who he really is it's a knowing relationship it's not putting something on the outside it's not changing who we are all the time it's not having complexes of who we are it's finding out solid I'm confident I know this is the way God made me I'm comfortable in my own skin and I'm going to give God glory in the way he made me because I am known of God I know God I am known of God He Knows My Name can you say am man he knows who I am and so I'm going to be who I am because I know who I am what an age of what an age of an identity crisis right down to the perversion of not even knowing whether you're a boy or girl anymore it's a it's a it's a Satan's attack on the identity even of a man and a woman what a perverted thing it's an identity crisis and yet in the word of God we are fearfully and wonderfully made who we are and individually we are known of God and when we know that we're known and he reveals to us who we are he re reveals to us who he is and we find our identity in him can you say Amen when God unveils who he is completely and we can look at him face to face then it brings this victory in Divine love flowing through you it brings this victory in Divine love looking into his face this face-to-face relationship this knowing him knowing us and US fully knowing him perfectly it brings us into this victory of divine love that's why I conclude with this tonight that Paul is concluding the same way when we come in that day when that would is perfect has come we're looking perfectly into the face of Christ through his word it's a day of knowing it's a day of knowing who he is and it's a day of knowing who we are amen it's an unveiling it's a revealing it's it it's not smearing on Christianity it's not living off the blessings of Christianity let me say it this way it's not being just interested in Christ as The Giver it's being interested in Christ himself the person this is is not a religion this is a love relationship with Christ can you say Amen this is an everyday falling deeper in love with him I'm falling in love knowing as I get to know him more I fall in love with him more that's a true relationship in marriage too they start courtship and they start dating a courtship and so you know what it's about getting to know one another and so if you get to know one another and there's no love there it's just like I'm backing off but you keep if you keep get together and you know them more you keep falling in love with who they are and they're falling in love with you that's that's the way it is with Christ the more I get to know him the more I fall in love with him and so let me just say it this way how we're living day by day comes down to what we're looking at how you react to Life's troubles depends on this one thing what are you looking at what are you beholding what are you beholding in your life what are you looking at and if it's very little of this word in your life then you will not be able to react to Life's circumstances the right way but there's a power there's a power there's a transformation it just does it cuz God said in my in the gospel is power I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ for it's the power under salvation it does something when we keep our eyes beholding the word of God we see him can you say amen and and and you don't have to work up the power you don't have to work up the transformation he just says keep beholding me keep looking at me and all the power to live to react to give love to to have wisdom in every situation it comes out of looking into his face and we look at it and it's hard to come out of prayer and come out of looking at his face it's hard to have ill feelings towards somebody when you're in that atmosphere of looking at him just like Leonardo just like it it's it was hard to stay ill in his in his heart coming to in front of the face of Christ that was just a picture I tell you when we're we got we're always looking at this there's a power that changes us we look at life different how you react to troubles depends on what you're looking at your Victory as a Christian is what you're mostly looking at in your life that's true if he is here and has appeared before us in this hour then we can see him clearly it brings the result of a constant change from glory to glory to glory we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord because the glory of God is in the word of God and I'm not just talking about just our Bible it's the word it's the word of power but it starts by reading your Bible it starts by getting into it it's staying in front of it it's staying in the message it's it's staying in the word of God it's not the technical Written Letter on here it's what we're looking at in his character and when we keep looking at and beholding it because James brings up that thing about uh someone who's not a doer of the word and just a hearer is the one that looks in a glass quickly and walks away but somebody who looks in a mirror and stays there and keeps looking and keeps looking he starts to see the flaw and becomes a doer of the word and not a hearer only right how REM how many remembers that scripture in James so we are in his appearing now we're his we're looking for his coming but we're in his appearing now he has appeared he is revealing his glory that which is perfect is come we we just need to keep looking at it and beholding it and gazing upon it and Americans and American believers stop stop being so distracted by so many things and beholding everything else if you behold the news every day you're going to be pretty weak and pretty scared if you're beholding social media most of the time you're going to be insecure you're going to be uh scared you're going to be dying into all different things of the world wisdom of this world what are you beholding uh you know right to the worst perverted things and looking at women and men on there if you're beholding that you're not going to survive it unless you pull out and say God take that from my life there's only one power I want controlling and leading my life and and guiding my life and that's the power of His Holy Spirit and his love working in me I won't be under the power of anything but so easily we get under the power of something else we get depressed by something else there's a power that goes with it and so we want to be under that so I'm going to switch down talk about this prophecy and I've been mentioning it that that when we get to the end time that which is perfect is come that which is perfect has come so Paul ends this with a prophecy that the bride of Christ of the last days shall see him and Behold Him clearly crystal clear through the word being revealed and his appearing through the word being revealed to us she this bride will Behold Him in a clear way and not through a glass Darkly let me say this respectfully dreams prophecies healings it's through a glass Darkly but it may not be knowing him this is a knowing relationship this is a knowing him relationship so dreams sometimes dreams are of the Lord sometimes they're not and if people want to follow every dream that they have I wouldn't follow hardly any of my dreams people get caught up in that this dream and this dream and they're trying to interpret it be careful be careful because unless there's someone that really has a gift there to interpret it uh you you could go way off track and guess what you're doing you you're seeing through a glass Darkly you're holding holding on to something that's it's a it's a partial trying to see what's coming and trying to see what's in your life and you know the thing is about the mystery of his will and that's what the Bible calls the mystery of his will you know his will is a mystery there's only one way to find his will is to look in his word because his word is his will amen I'm trying to find his will so you're looking maybe I'll give me I get I'll get a dream or something like that and and God does speak through but if you're only depending on a dream it's it's seeing through a glass Darkly there's a more sure word of Prophecy there's a there's a there's a a way the Lord can speak to you and drop it in your heart this is the will of God young people say well what do I do what career do I have and I don't know I wish the Lord had tell me to just be an engineer and God may do that God can do that he can impress upon your heart what to do but if if it's the details of what who do I marry and all these other things you know I say to people his will is in the word of God so get in the word stay in the word and out of that that's his will for this hour that's his achievement for this hour what does what is God's will that he wants to achieve for this hour right now right what is God's will right now what am I to be doing as a Christian in this hour and you find that in the word and you position yourself there then out of that he'll lead your heart to what job you should be having so what person to marry right amen see it all comes back to beholding his word stay in the word and you're going to be winging it if you're out of his word and you got to make big decisions in life and you're not staying in his word you're going to be winging it you found the fly it's off the cuff and I think vaguely I don't really have sure about this but I'm standing at the altar marrying this girl but I don't have full faith of it you can't do that you got to know where you stand you got to know it's his will can you say Amen to walk as solid as we can walk and there's nothing more solid in this world than beholding the word of God constantly he is revealing who you are and he's revealing who he is amen that's the hour at that day Jesus said you'll know I'm in the Father the father and me I in you and you and me you'll know what kind of Oneness is happening because I'm going to I'm going to appear to you and I'm going to reveal this whole plan to you I'm going to break open all this to you I'm not going to be partial I'm not I'm not going to be uh uh uh uh seeing you're not going to see me through a glass Darkly anymore but you're going to look at to me in a relationship that's face to face and thus you're going to know me and I'm going to know you there's nothing here and it's a relationship can you say Amen thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information please contact us by visiting our website literall life. church and if you
