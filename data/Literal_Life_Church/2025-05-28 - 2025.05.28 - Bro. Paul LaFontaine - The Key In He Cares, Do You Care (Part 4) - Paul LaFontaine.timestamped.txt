[26:39] house of the Lord tonight. God bless you
[26:41] all. And we're going to turn together to
[26:43] Hebrewsap 11. Trust you remember all the
[26:46] prayer requests that were read tonight
[26:48] before the Lord. And some put their
[26:50] name, but they and I was mentioning all
[26:52] the veterans or not the veterans but the
[26:56] wonderful heroes of faith that's come
[26:58] out of our church this person gave me
[27:01] all of them because I missed a few and
[27:04] memorial day we were remembering our
[27:07] people who went on to be with the Lord
[27:09] and their reward brother John Lefontaine
[27:11] brother Steve Johnson brother Bill
[27:13] Chandler uh Grandma Olive brother Ron
[27:16] Ball brother Gary Denman and Sister
[27:19] Janet Mills as well so I forgot a couple
[27:21] of those but I appreciate you writing
[27:23] bring those in, whoever did that. And
[27:25] we've had some heroes of faith that has
[27:27] died believing this word with all their
[27:29] heart. And so we honor them and they've
[27:32] left a good legacy for us to follow in
[27:35] their footsteps. Can you say amen?
[27:37] Praise the Lord. Good to be in the house
[27:38] of the Lord tonight. Let's he read in
[27:40] Hebrews chap 11 and um Hebrews chapter
[27:44] 11, the faith chapter. And speaking of
[27:46] heroes of faith, this is the heroes of
[27:49] faith in the scripture. And uh we are
[27:53] appreciative to have such a history of
[27:55] 6,000 years of so many uh wonderful men
[27:59] and women of God. Praise the Lord.
[28:01] Hebrews chap 11 verse one. Now faith is
[28:05] the substance of things hoped for the
[28:08] evidence of things not seen. When we
[28:11] enter into this faith uh of God, then we
[28:15] realize it's not the things that are
[28:17] visible, it's the things that are
[28:18] invisible, but they're every bit as
[28:20] real. Can you say amen? So come coming
[28:23] into this type of faith and I'm sure you
[28:26] all would desire coming into this faith
[28:29] means that our dependence is not at all
[28:32] on what we see but on what we don't see.
[28:35] So you have to remember that about the
[28:36] the approach to this faith. It's things
[28:38] the evidence of things and when it says
[28:41] evidence it's definitely there but it's
[28:43] things that are invisible. For by it the
[28:45] elders obtained a good report. Through
[28:48] faith, we understand that the worlds
[28:49] were framed by the word of God, so that
[28:52] things which are seen were made of
[28:55] things which do appear.
[28:58] Excuse me, not made of things which do
[28:59] appear. Uh, by faith, Abel offered unto
[29:02] God a more excellent sacrifice than
[29:04] Cain, by which he obtained witness that
[29:07] he was righteous. God testifying of his
[29:10] gifts, and by it he being dead, yet
[29:12] speaketh. By faith Enoch was translated
[29:16] that he should not see death and was not
[29:18] found because God had translated him.
[29:21] For before his test translation he had
[29:24] this testimony that he pleased God. But
[29:28] without faith it is impossible to please
[29:31] him. For he how many want to please God
[29:33] tonight? For without faith is impossible
[29:35] to please him. For listen to this. This
[29:37] is my text tonight. For he that cometh
[29:40] to God must believe that he is,
[29:45] not that he was,
[29:48] not that he will be, but it's a present
[29:51] day God. And your faith is rooted in it.
[29:53] He's living now. He's present now. must
[29:56] believe not that he was, not he will be,
[29:58] but he if you're coming to God with this
[30:00] kind of faith, you have to believe that
[30:02] he is and that he is a rewarder of them
[30:06] that diligently seek him. Praise the
[30:09] Lord. May God add his blessings to the
[30:11] word tonight. Heavenly Father, we're so
[30:14] grateful, Lord, for the uh the chance to
[30:16] be able to express our hearts in
[30:18] worship. We pray you'll bless anoint us
[30:20] tonight, Father. All the ears that are
[30:22] listening, may we listen with faith
[30:24] tonight. Faith cometh by hearing,
[30:26] hearing by the word. We pray that you'll
[30:28] encourage, you'll strengthen, Lord, uh
[30:31] rebuke whatever is needed to us tonight.
[30:33] We just pray that you'll bring us closer
[30:35] to that walk with you. We pray as we
[30:37] commit the service to you in all things
[30:39] said in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you.
[30:42] You may be seated. We sure enjoyed the
[30:44] worship tonight. That's my cousin there
[30:45] leading songs and he did a wonderful job
[30:48] tonight. Can you say amen? We certainly
[30:50] appreciated it. And uh yielding to the
[30:52] Lord. We appreciate all of you coming
[30:54] out to the house of God. Those all that
[30:56] are listening at home and can't make it
[30:58] so far, such a far drive. So, it's
[31:00] always good to have you. I want to
[31:02] continue tonight a little bit in part
[31:04] four of my series, the key and he cares.
[31:07] Do you care? And I wanted to use Hebrews
[31:10] 11:6 as a a basis tonight for the a
[31:14] little bit of the subject that we'll get
[31:15] into. And uh I wanted to use this faith
[31:18] chapter and specifically when it says he
[31:21] that cometh to God must believe that he
[31:24] is and that he is a rewarder of those
[31:27] that diligently seek him. This is a
[31:30] faith and an approach uh to getting to
[31:33] God and getting results from God. Uh how
[31:36] many want when we go to God, we want to
[31:38] get results. We want God to step in. We
[31:41] want to tap into the supernatural God.
[31:43] And so this is this is kind of found a
[31:45] found foundational but is it is in
[31:48] harmony with this subject that brother
[31:50] Brandon brought us that the he cares do
[31:51] you care it's a wonderful key that we're
[31:54] talking about and this scripture is in
[31:55] line with it because when we come we
[31:58] must believe that he is in other words
[32:00] it's not a god of yesterday it's not a
[32:02] god of the future but he's a god of now
[32:04] and that he is he's present his presence
[32:07] is here now and all that he is is here
[32:10] now he is not limited can you say amen
[32:13] man. He's we we cannot any of us believe
[32:16] that God is limited in any way, but that
[32:19] when he is when he's present, then he's
[32:21] all here and he's able to perform all
[32:23] things. The second part of is those that
[32:26] uh believe that he's a rewarder of those
[32:28] not just that half-hazardly come to him,
[32:30] but those that diligently seek him. So,
[32:33] this is in harmony with this. He cares.
[32:36] Do you care? A God I've been saying that
[32:38] a God that really cares. He wants to
[32:40] step in. He wants to deliver. He wants
[32:43] to change. He wants to bring answers to
[32:45] our life. And when he does that, when he
[32:47] steps in, he shows that he care. He
[32:49] doesn't say that he care. He shows that
[32:51] he cares. And then on this other side,
[32:53] do you care? It shows someone that how
[32:56] diligent they are to come towards God
[32:59] and to say, I believe that he is, and I
[33:01] believe I'm going to keep pursuing him,
[33:03] and I'm going to keep uh coming before
[33:05] his throne, and that and I'm gonna while
[33:08] I do that, I believe he's a rewarder.
[33:10] He's a deliverer. He's a God that comes
[33:12] through. He's a rewarder of those that
[33:15] diligently seek him. So, here we have
[33:18] the a revelation that he is, but also a
[33:21] revelation that he responds to those who
[33:25] are diligently seeking him. And not
[33:28] half-hazardly, not just, you know, well,
[33:30] yeah, I believe God, but those who are
[33:32] diligent about it, those who are serious
[33:34] about it, those who are sincere in the
[33:36] message, he cares. Do you care? We're
[33:38] going to get into some things later on
[33:40] in this series. And brother Bram speaks
[33:42] of our s the depth of sincerity. Uh the
[33:46] depth of our confession. I want to get
[33:48] heavy into detail with those things
[33:50] because we can say with our words that
[33:52] we care, but when we go to the depths of
[33:55] sincerity and God's looking at that s
[33:57] sincerity and he's looking at the depth
[34:00] of our confession, then that shows that
[34:03] we care. That shows that we're serious.
[34:05] Not just lip service, but something that
[34:08] comes from the devil. I really believe
[34:09] this. I really believe that he is. I
[34:12] really believe he's a rewarder of those
[34:13] that diligently seek him. I really
[34:16] believe that God is able to do that
[34:18] because he's present now and he's able
[34:19] to do it. That's the kind of faith
[34:21] that's the kind of confession that we
[34:23] offer to him. And and so um I I think
[34:26] these things are are important for us to
[34:28] look at in light of the message. He
[34:30] cares. Do you care? So, you know, we
[34:33] last service we talked about this uh we
[34:35] gave we read a couple examples of
[34:38] testimonies that Brother Brown gave at
[34:40] the beginning of the service and I read
[34:42] both of those examples. It's amazing
[34:44] that he starts this whole um message or
[34:47] sermon with a couple of examples and I I
[34:50] really enjoyed the examples and I'm
[34:51] going to bring out several reasons why
[34:53] here as a foundation tonight, but we we
[34:55] read those in the last service. So, I'm
[34:57] just going to refer to them tonight. I
[34:58] don't have them up in the quotes again,
[35:00] but uh there's two examples of
[35:02] testimonies and one of them where
[35:05] brother Brandham says they had a faith
[35:07] that would not take no would not uh take
[35:09] a no. And then the second the lady
[35:12] talked about coming after nine years and
[35:14] she kept trying. She didn't give up. So
[35:16] he's bringing out a couple examples of
[35:18] what we should be showing we care and
[35:21] that is we keep coming and we don't take
[35:23] no. In other words, we we're are going
[35:25] to continue to come till we find him.
[35:27] And the second thing is we we don't give
[35:29] up. And so we find this principle in
[35:31] Hebrews 11:6. And that is we believe
[35:34] that he is. We believe that he's that he
[35:36] cares. We believe that he's able to do
[35:39] it. But also our faith shows that we're
[35:42] diligently seeking him. And uh these two
[35:45] examples showed that they cared to
[35:47] diligently seek help and God cared
[35:50] enough to step in and move the darkness
[35:52] out. So, but there's a couple things
[35:54] that I want to bring out in these
[35:56] examples tonight. Um, neither of these
[36:00] needs that he mentioned, and I'm going
[36:01] to have to refresh your memory what they
[36:03] are, but neither of them uh are related
[36:06] to uh neither of these needs that are
[36:08] brought are related to physical healing
[36:11] that they needed. So, here we are in the
[36:14] middle of a healing uh first of all,
[36:17] healing revival. A lot of physical
[36:19] healing that took place. God rising with
[36:22] healing in his wings again and showing
[36:25] himself powerful. And there was, you
[36:27] know, I mean, we can't talk about it
[36:29] tonight. We we'd never get to all of the
[36:31] meetings with the healing revival, not
[36:33] just in Brother Brandham's ministry, but
[36:35] he spearheaded a whole healing revival
[36:38] with tents and cathedrals just opened up
[36:42] uh with thousands, literally thousands
[36:45] of people being instantly healed.
[36:47] Whether a miracle or healing, whatever
[36:49] it was, it was still a great healing
[36:51] because the Bible says he, the son of
[36:53] man, would rise with healing in his
[36:55] wings. He's showing that he can heal
[36:57] physically. In this sermon, brother
[36:59] Brandham gives a couple examples and
[37:01] they're not needs that are related to
[37:04] physical healing. Uh Satan in in the
[37:06] first one, Satan was binding a young man
[37:09] who was just married and he he was
[37:12] binding him up with a complex. They got
[37:14] married. Two couples got married,
[37:15] Brother Bram's church, and they took off
[37:18] uh to their honeymoon back to New York.
[37:21] And when they got there, I think they
[37:22] were done with their honeymoon.
[37:23] Something happened and the devil got on
[37:25] this one pre uh young preacher. And
[37:28] there's no details, but brother Bram
[37:30] called it a complex. And the devil
[37:32] overshadowed him and brought this cloud
[37:34] on him and begin to bind him up and he
[37:36] got defeated. And they had just left
[37:39] brother Bram. They went on their
[37:40] honeymoon. They were as happy as ever,
[37:41] both of these couples. and the happiness
[37:43] was gone. Satan had bound this young man
[37:45] up. I don't know if he reminded him of a
[37:47] past sin. I don't know the details. All
[37:50] I know it wasn't that he come all the
[37:52] way back to Jeffersonville for physical
[37:55] healing. He was coming back to get a
[37:58] hold of God for a complex.
[38:01] He was coming to get a hold of God
[38:03] because Satan had bound him not in a
[38:05] physical healing but with a complex.
[38:07] Now, we don't think in terms of going to
[38:09] God so much for our complex, but we need
[38:12] to. Can you say amen? Because Satan can
[38:16] use anything to bind a person up.
[38:20] Physical he physical sicknesses, it's
[38:24] obvious that Satan's getting us with
[38:25] that. We're down, we're weak. Whether
[38:27] it's a cold or cancer, whatever it is,
[38:30] Satan just reres havoc with that. makes
[38:32] us weak, makes us down, and we know
[38:34] we're being bound because we can't do
[38:36] what we normally do. So, that's obvious,
[38:38] but it's not as obvious when Satan is
[38:40] binding us up in our spirit, in our
[38:43] heart with a complex or something. And
[38:46] sometimes it goes on for years. But oh,
[38:48] how Satan likes to use other things
[38:50] besides physical sicknesses to bind us
[38:53] up. And in this case, the first example,
[38:56] like I said, I'm not reading them
[38:58] tonight, but there was a young minister
[38:59] and he he got he got over there.
[39:02] Something jumped on him. This is the
[39:04] words Brother Bram's using and and uh
[39:06] Satan was binding them up and they were
[39:09] happy and Satan reminded him of
[39:11] something and basically stole away their
[39:14] happiness of their honeymoon and feeling
[39:16] so free. Steal. Isn't that like the
[39:18] devil stealing the happiness that we
[39:22] have?
[39:23] stealing the contentment that we have,
[39:26] taking away our happiness. And I believe
[39:28] that God's people should be happy.
[39:31] I believe God intended, and I'm quoting
[39:33] from the message, Brother Bram said, God
[39:35] intended human beings to be happy, to
[39:37] make us happy. Even at the end of
[39:39] marriage and divorce, when he was
[39:41] talking about all the mess ups and
[39:43] everything, and he said, "We can't fix
[39:45] it now." He said, "Go on. Don't ever do
[39:46] it again." And then at the end in his
[39:48] prayer, he said, "God, make these
[39:51] families happy."
[39:54] God is more for your happiness than
[39:56] anything in this world. God wants people
[39:59] content. God wants people free. God
[40:01] wants people happy. Can you say amen?
[40:03] And it's the devil that steals that
[40:06] away. And that's what he did in this
[40:07] young man is just they lost their their
[40:09] joy even of their honeymoon. And brother
[40:12] Bram said when he met him, he seen a
[40:14] shadow of darkness over him and even a
[40:16] sadness over the other couple and his
[40:19] wife. They're crying. He sees him there
[40:21] at a motel. He drives in the parking
[40:23] lot. They see him there. And
[40:25] incidentally, Brother Bram says it
[40:27] showed God cared because he said he had
[40:29] been fasting and praying for days and
[40:31] then he just started driving. He was
[40:33] supposed to go somewhere and he just
[40:34] felt led to turn into this uh parking
[40:37] lot and sure enough these people had
[40:39] been waiting. no way to get a hold of
[40:41] him. But God led the two together. Why
[40:44] did God lead the two together? Because
[40:45] God cares. God knows what's going on.
[40:49] And here's a young man. Brother Brandham
[40:50] didn't even know it himself. Drove all
[40:52] the way back from New York. And he's
[40:54] sitting there hoping to get a chance to
[40:56] come back and and and meet God, God
[40:58] working through his prophet. And here he
[41:01] drives in the and he's seen a shadow of
[41:03] darkness over him. And so I just want to
[41:06] point out in this incident, there's no
[41:08] it's not physical healing. It's a
[41:09] complex and Satan's binding him through
[41:12] that. Then the lady that he talked about
[41:14] was burdened for nine years and she
[41:16] couldn't get to brother Brandham for
[41:18] nine years. She kept coming trying to
[41:19] get to him. But it was a problem not in
[41:21] physical, it was a problem, he said in
[41:23] her heart. It was some problem in her
[41:25] heart. What was it? He said something
[41:28] happened with her parents
[41:31] years ago that made something happen to
[41:35] her.
[41:36] So now we don't have a physical healing
[41:39] that's needed. We we don't have we don't
[41:42] have something that's uh by any means
[41:44] normal, but something was passed down by
[41:48] Satan and was binding her up. Some
[41:50] generational trouble. So I'm just saying
[41:52] this to show you God cares about all
[41:55] things. Can you say amen? God's not just
[41:58] concerned about healing you when you
[42:00] need healing physically, but he's
[42:02] concerned about every detail of our
[42:04] lives. And in this case, there's a
[42:06] complex and then this lady, it was
[42:08] something generational trouble passed
[42:10] down. Something her parents did years
[42:13] ago that made something happen to her.
[42:16] And she began, her heart began to be
[42:18] burdened. She had it for years. She was
[42:20] having trouble finding a job. She was a
[42:22] mess. She was nervous and tried for nine
[42:25] years and kept trying, kept trying. And
[42:29] finally at the I think it was at the end
[42:30] of a service, Brother Bram walks out the
[42:32] back and she never could get a prayer
[42:34] card or anything. And finally they
[42:36] connect there outside the service. God
[42:38] brings them together. God shows him a
[42:40] vision and right there in a moment's
[42:42] time he says he she's sitting in the
[42:44] service right now and she's starting to
[42:45] cry because she knows this is true. In a
[42:47] moment's time, the Lord revealed to her
[42:49] what her trouble was. And guess what?
[42:51] The trouble wasn't physical sickness. It
[42:53] was trouble in the heart. And then he
[42:55] says, notice that God cared for that
[42:59] woman. God cared that he didn't want to
[43:02] leave her go on. And she went a long
[43:04] time, nine years, but God cared. And
[43:07] when God cared and it was time, he
[43:09] stepped in.
[43:11] When God cares, it might be a long time,
[43:13] but when he steps in and shows he cares,
[43:16] then it's over. And Satan, he said she
[43:19] was burdened and she carried this burden
[43:21] for many years. She was troubled by it.
[43:22] It was a generational trouble. that took
[43:25] place. And so, uh, the question is
[43:29] after, uh, looking at those first
[43:31] examples, and if you're reading along in
[43:32] the message with me, which you should
[43:34] be, if you're reading along, you you you
[43:36] have to realize that, uh, that he's
[43:39] saying something in this little sermon
[43:41] of uh, he cares. Do you care? It's not
[43:43] so much a sermon, but it's a it's
[43:45] teaching sons of God. It's teaching sons
[43:48] of God that there's a channel that we
[43:50] get into. there's a a place that we can
[43:53] get in to create the right atmosphere,
[43:55] create the right attitude. And when we
[43:57] get into that channel, then God is able
[44:00] to work in that atmosphere and step in,
[44:02] show he cares in the situations in our
[44:05] lives. So, it's a teaching uh it's not
[44:07] so much a doctrinal sermon, but it's a a
[44:10] teaching thing to show us those way. My
[44:12] question is after those examples, should
[44:14] we be ignoring these type of things that
[44:17] Satan binds us with? heart issues,
[44:20] generational trouble, guilt and shame,
[44:24] condemnation that comes from the past, a
[44:26] complex. Should we be ignoring those
[44:29] things when Satan is using those things
[44:31] to bind us? Absolutely not.
[44:34] We should not be ignoring them. Do we
[44:37] only go to God when we're sick? You see,
[44:40] it's harder to detect the heart issues
[44:42] than it is a fix physical sickness. It's
[44:45] it's easy to feel and sometimes even see
[44:48] the issue. When someone's sick, they can
[44:51] see it. Sometimes if it's something
[44:52] that's uh uh visible on the outside,
[44:55] sometimes it's internal in the body, but
[44:57] the person feels it. They they they they
[44:59] feel the sickness. They feel weak. Uh we
[45:02] were praying for some tonight. Even my
[45:04] uh daughter-in-law that feels a bit
[45:05] weak, a bit sick. Lily, we're keeping
[45:08] her in prayer. But you feel that. And so
[45:10] it's it's it's more obvious that Satan
[45:12] is trying to weaken somebody. But things
[45:15] of the heart aren't as obvious. You
[45:17] don't feel them as much. At least we
[45:20] don't talk about them.
[45:22] But Satan combined just as much as he
[45:25] does with a physical sickness. And so uh
[45:29] we we just look at this these examples
[45:31] and and we realize we should never uh
[45:34] ignore anything that the devil's trying
[45:37] to bind us with darkness. This type of
[45:39] darkness in the heart is is more subtle,
[45:42] it seems like. And uh it it it can draw
[45:45] us aside. It can sometimes we keep it
[45:47] hidden for many years because it's not
[45:49] as obvious and it's more subtle. The de
[45:51] devil's using it. The the the binding up
[45:54] of a spirit and the heart is a lot more
[45:57] subtle by the enemy than it is to have a
[46:00] physical sickness. We can easily say,
[46:02] "Well, I'm sick and the devil's making
[46:04] me sick." Yeah, that's easier. But when
[46:06] Satan is binding up somebody's spirit of
[46:09] their heart or binds them for years with
[46:11] a complex and keeps that that cloud over
[46:13] them, it's harder to detect. It's harder
[46:16] to expose. Can you say amen? It's harder
[46:19] to be real about it. And that's what
[46:21] we'll find in this series is that when
[46:24] we begin to be real, when we begin to
[46:26] confess, when we start to say, "Lord, I
[46:29] really want help. I got something laying
[46:31] here that I I don't know why I've got
[46:33] this complex, but I'm willing to lay it
[46:35] before you. Show me what it is. I don't
[46:37] want to go another day and let the devil
[46:39] keep binding me with this. I don't want
[46:42] to go on and try to act like I'm
[46:44] successful and I'm not really
[46:45] spiritually successful because I know
[46:47] the enemy is trying to keep me bound by
[46:49] it. So, we we don't want to uh just hide
[46:52] it. Can you say amen? So, we look at
[46:55] this young man and his friends and
[46:56] driving all the way back and getting
[46:58] help for the trouble of uh uh Satan
[47:01] using this complex. We look at the lady
[47:03] waiting for nine years and they're
[47:04] saying, "I need to be free." And the the
[47:07] point that the prophet is making, I
[47:09] believe, been given these examples is
[47:11] God cared for that too. surrounded by
[47:15] countless years of healing lines and
[47:17] thousands healed of every manner of
[47:20] disease. Don't anyone dare to think that
[47:23] God is not wanting to care about other
[47:26] things that Satan binds people with. I
[47:28] know that seems simple tonight, but
[47:30] don't ever ignore any area that the
[47:34] devil is binding you.
[47:36] Don't ever just brush it off. Don't ever
[47:39] just say, "Well, that's that's not
[47:41] important." Any place the enemy is
[47:44] trying to overshadow your spirit, it
[47:47] needs to be addressed. It needs to be
[47:49] exposed. It needs deliverance. Can you
[47:52] say amen? So, we have to become a
[47:55] people. And I just wanted to make one
[47:56] more point from it from the examples and
[47:58] then we'll move on. The couple in the
[48:01] story and the woman believe that God
[48:03] cared for these things too. He they in
[48:06] order to make the trip that they did,
[48:08] they believe that God cared for these
[48:10] things too. Do they believe that I've
[48:12] got this complex that the devil's
[48:14] overshadowing me with? I've got this
[48:16] something happened with my parents and I
[48:18] found out about it. Now it's affecting
[48:20] me. And they believe that God cared for
[48:24] those things, too.
[48:26] And diligently seeking out a source that
[48:29] God could work through to get the bottom
[48:31] of it. Why did they do that? Because
[48:34] they believe that God is he's a present
[48:37] tense God. If they'd have believed that
[48:39] God was, they never would have pursued
[48:42] and went back and tried to find the
[48:44] source and find the prophet to try to
[48:46] get help. But they believe that I
[48:47] believe God is and he's a rewarder of
[48:49] those that diligently seek him. They
[48:52] believed in the present God. They
[48:53] believe there's some help somewhere.
[48:55] There's a source. And guess what? That
[48:57] source is still here tonight. That God
[48:59] is still here tonight. There's somebody.
[49:01] This is the body of Christ here tonight.
[49:03] And Christ is here in his body. We
[49:06] should never believe the doubt from
[49:07] Satan that there's not help somewhere.
[49:09] God has help somewhere in his body. God
[49:13] has somebody who can lay hands on you.
[49:15] God has somebody who can get through to
[49:17] God for you even when you feel like you
[49:19] don't. Can you say amen? And so this
[49:21] couple believed that God cared for these
[49:24] type of things too and diligently sought
[49:27] out the source that God could work
[49:29] through to get to the bottom. And why
[49:31] they knew that? They believe that God is
[49:33] a present tense God. And they believe he
[49:36] cared for this too. And they believed if
[49:38] they kept seeking him, he would unbind
[49:41] them and he would set them free even
[49:44] from this complex, even from this thing
[49:47] that they wouldn't normally think that,
[49:49] but they believed it. They believed, I'm
[49:51] going to keep going to God. I'm going to
[49:52] I'm going to find him because I believe
[49:54] he cares about this, too. So, I want to
[49:56] take another section of
[49:59] uh this message. He cares. Do you care?
[50:01] And I I want to look at it tonight. That
[50:03] was a bit of a foundation, but I want to
[50:05] look at this. And it's it's what this is
[50:07] doing is bringing us into a a strong
[50:10] believing that Jesus is here in every
[50:14] way that he was while he was on earth.
[50:18] And this the point brother Brand makes
[50:19] in the sermon that Christ is here in
[50:24] every way
[50:26] except his corporal body.
[50:29] See, brother Paul, I already knew that
[50:30] tonight. I didn't need to come. I
[50:32] already had that. Did you? Are we really
[50:36] standing as believers and believing that
[50:38] God is He's a rewarder of those that
[50:40] diligent, but that God is. Do we really
[50:43] believe that Christ is here tonight
[50:47] in every principle and in every form
[50:50] that he was 2,000 years ago on the
[50:52] earth?
[50:54] Praise the Lord. Because I think when we
[50:58] look at that, we look at all of life
[51:01] completely different. And I'm not
[51:02] talking about just at church coming to
[51:04] church. It'll affect the way you come to
[51:05] church because you'll walk in the doors
[51:07] and realize you're not looking at what
[51:09] somebody's wearing. You're not looking
[51:11] at who's doing this or who's playing the
[51:13] instruments. We're so carnal because
[51:16] we're always looking at people and
[51:18] looking at everything else. How much is
[51:20] of our mind time and thought time is
[51:23] spent on those things and not spent on
[51:25] realizing, wait a minute here. Wait a
[51:27] minute. God, Christ is present in every
[51:30] way. The potential for him to do
[51:33] something is here tonight.
[51:36] How much are we looking at the outward?
[51:38] You know, how many's going to be there
[51:39] at church? When I was a young pastor,
[51:41] you know, I I was always thinking about
[51:43] who was there and who wasn't there? And
[51:45] to be honest with you, I do pray for the
[51:47] ones who begin to miss a lot. But I
[51:48] don't think it's a good idea. But I
[51:50] don't keep count all the time of how
[51:52] many is there. Some people can't. Some
[51:54] people can and they're not here. But I
[51:56] don't let that worry me because wherever
[51:58] two or three are gathered. I'm going to
[52:00] preach like there's a thousand people
[52:02] because a God is there to make change.
[52:05] God is present. He said he'd be present
[52:07] with two or three being there and
[52:09] they're believing with all their heart.
[52:11] So it's not about numbers. You come to
[52:13] church because you have a hunger to come
[52:15] to church. I can't put that hunger in
[52:17] people. But everybody will be there or
[52:19] listening in when they've got a hunger
[52:21] for God. Can you say amen? So you don't
[52:23] worry about that. But I'm just using an
[52:25] example of me when I was young. You
[52:26] worried about those things. You're
[52:28] looking at those things. We need to quit
[52:30] looking at the visible and look at the
[52:32] invisible. We need to stop looking at
[52:35] our problems and look at our promise. We
[52:38] need to stop looking at what we see and
[52:40] look at what we can't see.
[52:43] Because what I see in the invisible is
[52:46] that he is here in every way that he was
[52:49] here 2,000 years ago.
[52:54] He is here. Jesus is here in every way
[52:59] that he was here while he was on earth
[53:01] in a body. Brother Bram says Jesus
[53:04] Christ is the same yesterday, today, and
[53:06] forever. And that means tonight he is
[53:08] here in every way except the corporal
[53:11] body.
[53:13] every bit of himself. Can you say amen?
[53:16] We can say that with our mouths, but he
[53:19] this needs to be so deep within us that
[53:22] we never feel something is lacking on
[53:27] God's part. Now, something may be
[53:28] lacking on our part, but God is not
[53:32] lacking in any of his. There's no
[53:34] limitations.
[53:36] He's not lacking in anything tonight.
[53:38] He's here in every way
[53:41] as he's always been. Now, do we need to
[53:44] pull into a channel of faith to draw him
[53:46] in? Do we need to create the right
[53:48] atmosphere? Do we need to say the right
[53:50] thing like Hattie Wright says? Can you
[53:51] say amen? Do we need to get in a channel
[53:53] to say, "Lord, let my attitude be
[53:55] right." The right mental attitude
[53:57] towards any promise of God will bring it
[53:59] to pass. Do we say and do things and
[54:02] sing things and worship to trigger the
[54:05] presence of God and bring it on the
[54:06] scene? Yes. But it doesn't mean that God
[54:09] is not here in every way. He's already
[54:11] here.
[54:13] Amen. But it needs to be deeper within
[54:16] us and never feel like something is
[54:18] lacking on God's part in him in him
[54:20] caring. Whatever tells you, listen to
[54:23] this now. Whatever tells you that he is
[54:25] limited,
[54:27] either the feeling of your unworthiness,
[54:31] your denominational teaching has taught
[54:33] you that he's that he's not the same and
[54:37] he doesn't do the days of miracles are
[54:39] passed. That comes from denominational
[54:40] teaching. You see the difference in
[54:43] religion and and nominal Christianity
[54:45] sometimes is that they they believe to a
[54:48] certain extent but they don't fully
[54:51] believe that Jesus Christ is the same
[54:52] yesterday, today and forever. They put
[54:54] limitations of God. All the miracles was
[54:56] with the apostles. I've heard pastors
[54:58] tell me that all that stopped with the
[55:00] apostles. They don't have a right to say
[55:02] that. There's no amen at the book of A
[55:04] at the end of the book of Acts. Anybody
[55:05] notice? A lot of the books they'll say
[55:08] amen. Book of Acts don't have amen. cuz
[55:11] it's not finished yet.
[55:15] You couldn't put an amen on the book of
[55:16] Acts cuz it's not done yet. He's doing
[55:19] things through me. He's doing things
[55:21] through you. The book of Acts don't have
[55:24] an amen on it until we're gone in a
[55:26] rapture.
[55:28] Praise the Lord. You can't put
[55:30] limitations on God. If he did it before,
[55:34] he can do it tonight. If he opened up
[55:37] the blind eyes before 2000, he can do it
[55:40] tonight.
[55:44] There are no limitations on what God can
[55:47] do.
[55:49] Only what we put on him.
[55:52] But don't you ever buy into the idea
[55:54] that uh that God is limited by your
[55:59] feeling of unworthiness.
[56:01] You may feel that and the devil's
[56:03] beating you up, but that does not limit
[56:05] God is all here.
[56:07] Can you say amen? Denominational
[56:09] teaching. I'm mention some more. The
[56:10] voices that's in your mind. The voices
[56:13] in your head or your your uh your need
[56:16] your need is somehow out of touch with
[56:19] him. Your need is a different need. And
[56:21] your need is so unique and different
[56:22] that it's out of his touch. That's a lie
[56:24] of the enemy. Amen.
[56:27] Or he does not concern himself with
[56:30] details of my life like this. These
[56:32] particular details he's not concerned.
[56:35] These are all lies. Can you say amen? He
[56:39] that comes to God must believe that he
[56:41] is
[56:43] and he is here.
[56:46] Hallelujah.
[56:48] You don't get anything else tonight.
[56:51] the revelation.
[56:53] He's here in all of his glory, in all of
[56:56] the he is there's nothing lacking in him
[56:59] tonight. Everything that he did in your
[57:03] Bible, he's here and can do it again.
[57:09] Praise the Lord.
[57:12] So, Brother Bram says in the next
[57:14] section of he cares, you care. He says,
[57:15] "When he was here on earth, as I say, I
[57:19] don't know if you guys got those quotes
[57:20] or not. When he was here on earth, as I
[57:22] say, he cared for the people so much
[57:26] till he healed their sick, comforted
[57:28] their hearts, told them about a place
[57:31] that where he would go and prepare for
[57:33] them and would come again to receive
[57:35] them unto himself. He cared for them.
[57:36] I'm going to read that again. When he
[57:38] was in earth, I I just want to watch
[57:39] want you to see what he's presenting
[57:41] now, okay? When he was here on earth,
[57:43] and we all read the four gospels and we
[57:46] read all the things that he did while he
[57:48] was on earth. Um, and when he was here
[57:52] on earth, did I forget to send those
[57:54] quotes to you? You did you get them?
[57:56] Okay, good. When he was here on earth,
[57:59] as I say, he cared for the people so
[58:02] much till he healed their sick. But
[58:05] that's not all. He comforted their
[58:07] hearts.
[58:08] He told them about a place where he
[58:11] would go and prepare for them and would
[58:13] come again and receive them unto
[58:15] himself. He cared for them. Now, most of
[58:17] us could say amen to that. We read the
[58:19] four gospel and gospels and we can say
[58:22] he cared. He cared about situations. He
[58:25] fed the hungry. He answered questions.
[58:28] Our Jesus, he answered questions. He of
[58:30] course when he answered the questions of
[58:33] the Pharisees, he usually answered it by
[58:36] asking them another question. But if
[58:38] somebody had a sincere question,
[58:39] remember brother Rat bringing in that
[58:41] time about questions are great, but
[58:44] Jesus would discern the motive of the
[58:46] question because some people, the
[58:47] Pharisees had a motive behind their
[58:49] question. They didn't want an answer to
[58:51] the question so they could believe and
[58:52] follow Christ. They were trying to catch
[58:54] him in something. So he discerned the
[58:56] motive. So Jesus would turn another
[58:58] question back to them, tie them all up
[59:00] in knots. But Jesus was available to
[59:03] answer questions to sincere questions.
[59:05] Jesus fed the hungry. He He was
[59:07] concerned about it. He took time to
[59:09] teach people. He ate with publicans and
[59:12] sinners. Can you say amen?
[59:15] Can you say amen? He ate with publicans
[59:17] and sinners. He got criticized for that.
[59:19] He spoke with prostitutes. I know that
[59:23] sounds bad, but he was bringing life to
[59:25] them. And so he had to speak to them
[59:28] sometimes. He spoke to prostitutes. He
[59:31] delivered people from the snare of
[59:33] legalistic people. Right? when they come
[59:36] legalistic people and took the law and
[59:38] was ready to stone that woman. He come
[59:41] beside that woman and he took care of
[59:43] those legalistic people and those
[59:45] Pharisees because he said, "He that's
[59:47] without sin, let him cast the first
[59:48] stone." And then he grabbed the woman's
[59:51] hand, no doubt. And said, "Listen there,
[59:53] where's your accusers?" She said, "I
[59:55] don't have any anymore." Cuz Jesus had
[59:57] run them all off. And he said, "Where's
[59:59] your accusers? I don't have any." He
[1:00:00] said, "Not I don't I don't condemn you
[1:00:03] either. Go and sin no more." He cared
[1:00:07] for that. He cared that that from that
[1:00:11] day forward, she would no longer be a
[1:00:13] prostitute.
[1:00:15] But she found her life in God. She found
[1:00:18] her life as a daughter of God. Can you
[1:00:19] say amen? He delivered people from the
[1:00:22] snare of legalistic people. He looked at
[1:00:24] the inside and not the out. He found a
[1:00:27] short businessman with a short person
[1:00:29] complex
[1:00:32] and asked him over. He asked himself
[1:00:34] over. That's what bastards do. They
[1:00:36] asked himself over to for dinner. I did
[1:00:39] it many times. But Jesus got this young
[1:00:42] Zakius shorty. Had to get in the tree to
[1:00:45] see Jesus cuz he he was short. Probably
[1:00:47] had a short person complex. Walked up
[1:00:50] Zakius. He said, "I'm inviting myself to
[1:00:52] your house tonight. I got something to
[1:00:54] share with you." Why? Because he cared.
[1:00:58] That's our Jesus.
[1:01:01] He would show up wherever he was
[1:01:03] invited.
[1:01:05] Jesus was available. Can you say amen?
[1:01:08] He sought to make people happy and free
[1:01:12] and do what it took to get them there.
[1:01:14] And this wasn't just a a fleshly carnal
[1:01:17] surface happiness. His happiness brought
[1:01:19] deliverance to the person. Deliverance
[1:01:22] from condemnation. Can you say amen?
[1:01:24] Deliverance from diseases and
[1:01:25] afflictions and all these things. His
[1:01:28] caring went beyond just saying I want to
[1:01:30] make you happy on the outside. He wanted
[1:01:32] to make them really happy. And that is
[1:01:34] deliverance, setting them free from
[1:01:37] heart problems, from from diseases. Can
[1:01:39] you say amen? That's when people are
[1:01:41] really happy and free and and do what he
[1:01:43] could to get them there. Any anybody can
[1:01:47] see a theme when they read the four
[1:01:49] gospels. He was God and Jesus was what
[1:01:52] God acted like on earth. And we could
[1:01:54] see in the four gospels, this is what
[1:01:57] God is acting like. And you know what it
[1:01:58] is? He cared about every detail of
[1:02:01] people's lives. We're blessed to have
[1:02:04] the four gospels to be able to see his
[1:02:06] life on earth. Three and a half years of
[1:02:07] ministry. And you know what we get to
[1:02:09] see? This is what God looks like on
[1:02:11] earth. This is what God acts like on
[1:02:13] earth. Otherwise, God would have been up
[1:02:15] there somewhere we would never known.
[1:02:17] But in four gospels, we can say this is
[1:02:19] what God acts like on earth. This is
[1:02:21] what God does. You know what the theme
[1:02:22] is? He cares to deliver people. He
[1:02:26] cares. He It's not just patting you on
[1:02:28] the back, but he cares to bring strength
[1:02:30] to your life. Can I get an amen tonight?
[1:02:33] He cares and he showed that he cared
[1:02:36] every deep detail of people's lives.
[1:02:38] Praise be to God. Now watch this quote
[1:02:41] take us through when Jesus was ready to
[1:02:44] leave his disciples to die and resurrect
[1:02:47] again. There was a transition here. And
[1:02:49] incidentally, the disciples didn't like
[1:02:51] it. Uh they didn't like it. The
[1:02:53] Pharisees loved it that he was leaving.
[1:02:55] But uh the the disciples because they
[1:02:58] didn't understand the transition that
[1:03:01] actually this transition of him leaving.
[1:03:03] You see when you have Christ in that
[1:03:06] form next to you and you're a disciple
[1:03:09] and you're able to be that close and
[1:03:11] have him teach you and sit beside him
[1:03:14] and hug him and just when when you have
[1:03:16] that there's something I'm sure there's
[1:03:18] something special about that. There's
[1:03:20] something wonderful about that. I've
[1:03:22] often thought many times in my Christian
[1:03:24] life what it would have been like to
[1:03:25] just be sitting there right next to him
[1:03:27] and just sit sitting there and listening
[1:03:29] and what a special thing. But listen now
[1:03:32] he had to transition into another
[1:03:35] ministry
[1:03:36] because if he didn't if he just kept it
[1:03:39] that way he could not bring something
[1:03:41] greater for you.
[1:03:44] It would have stayed limited. You said
[1:03:45] limited? I I would have loved to do
[1:03:47] that. But you see, when God has
[1:03:48] something better in mind for you, then
[1:03:50] there's a transition. He says, "I'm
[1:03:52] going to be leaving. My hour is about
[1:03:54] up." His disciples getting all nervous.
[1:03:56] No, no, no. We want to keep things the
[1:03:57] way they are. Peter takes out his sword.
[1:03:59] I'll fight this thing and knocks off a
[1:04:02] ear of a a soldier because he's going to
[1:04:05] fight. No. What was all this
[1:04:06] nervousness? We don't want to lose you.
[1:04:08] I'm going to stand for you. He's
[1:04:10] fighting the very prophecy of God
[1:04:13] because if Jesus didn't go, Peter would
[1:04:15] have never received the Holy Ghost.
[1:04:19] Can you say amen? And nobody none of the
[1:04:22] disciples knew this. And so they're
[1:04:24] they're effect I've got to hold on to
[1:04:25] this. And it reminds me of people. I got
[1:04:27] to hold on to this. I got to hold on to
[1:04:29] this. But sometimes when we have
[1:04:30] something visible to hold on to, God's
[1:04:33] trying to take us to a faith to the
[1:04:35] invisible,
[1:04:37] a deeper faith. Can you say amen? It's
[1:04:39] easy if he was standing there in flesh.
[1:04:41] I imagine people, you know, even the
[1:04:43] prophet, brother Brandham, they would
[1:04:45] have loved those days. They glorify
[1:04:46] those days. I would have loved to be
[1:04:48] there, too. But listen, God had to take
[1:04:50] him so that he could decrease and Christ
[1:04:53] could increase. If he was a hood
[1:04:55] tonight, which he'd be very old, he
[1:04:56] probably wouldn't be here. But if he
[1:04:58] was, I don't believe this message would
[1:05:00] have advanced to where it's at today in
[1:05:03] the people's lives because we'd have all
[1:05:05] had our eyes on William Brham. God knows
[1:05:09] what he's doing. God had to take his
[1:05:11] servant
[1:05:13] because there's a greater part in this
[1:05:15] message for you to find. But we get all
[1:05:20] emotionally nervous because we like the
[1:05:23] visible things.
[1:05:25] God's trying to take us to a faith
[1:05:28] that's deeper, the evidence of things
[1:05:31] hoped for, the evidence of things not
[1:05:33] seen. a realm of perfect faith that you
[1:05:36] don't see it with these eyes, but it's
[1:05:37] every bit as real. So he goes on to say
[1:05:41] after he talks about Jesus was here and
[1:05:44] he he he loved the people. So now watch
[1:05:46] him make this transition in the message
[1:05:48] and notice he cared so much when he
[1:05:51] knowed he must leave in order
[1:05:56] when he knowed he must leave in order to
[1:05:58] bring this great thing to us. Look what
[1:06:00] he says here. He had to leave. None of
[1:06:02] the disciples, nobody knew this, but he
[1:06:04] had to leave in order to bring this
[1:06:06] great thing to us. He said, "I'll not
[1:06:10] leave you comfortless." Because
[1:06:11] remember, they're all nervous and all
[1:06:13] these, but he said, "No, no, no. I'm not
[1:06:14] going to leave you comfortless, but I
[1:06:16] will send the Holy Spirit, and he shall
[1:06:19] continue my care for you until he
[1:06:24] returns."
[1:06:26] There's no one cares like Jesus. nobody
[1:06:29] that his body as a high priest knowing,
[1:06:31] excuse me, knowing that his body as a
[1:06:33] high priest in a mediatorial work that
[1:06:36] he's doing right now, that body must be
[1:06:38] in the presence of God at all times for
[1:06:41] intercession. That God cannot see the
[1:06:44] sinner's sin. He sees only the blood of
[1:06:47] his own son. And knowing that, he sent
[1:06:50] back the Holy Spirit to continue to
[1:06:54] comfort his people. I know this might be
[1:06:57] very simple tonight, but let's not
[1:06:59] overlook what brother Brand was saying.
[1:07:01] Let's not just pass it by here. That the
[1:07:03] reason that he had to go and take that
[1:07:05] and then when he died, rose again, the
[1:07:07] body was as a memorial there in the
[1:07:10] presence of God so that when God could
[1:07:13] see that body, he could only look at you
[1:07:16] through that lamb that was slain for
[1:07:18] your sins. He could never see you as a
[1:07:21] sinner anymore. God can only see you
[1:07:23] cleansed.
[1:07:26] That's not the half of it. Every part of
[1:07:29] his spirit, that's the body as a
[1:07:31] memorial. And God's looking at that
[1:07:33] sacrifice and he can never see you any
[1:07:37] in any other way but in the
[1:07:38] righteousness of God. But that's not the
[1:07:40] end of the story. Then he takes the
[1:07:41] fullness of his spirit and he pours it
[1:07:44] out on earth. Not in heaven. Everything
[1:07:47] that he was in Jesus, he pours it out
[1:07:51] where? On the earth again. On the earth
[1:07:54] again. And that's why brother BM says
[1:07:55] he's here in every way except the
[1:07:59] corporal body. He didn't take his own
[1:08:01] spirit and go up into heaven somewhere.
[1:08:03] And now for 2,000 years we just got to
[1:08:05] struggle by and we're just kind of
[1:08:07] trying to be like Jesus. Get the
[1:08:10] bracelet. What would Jesus do?
[1:08:13] Oh, no, no, no. He he, you know, we talk
[1:08:16] about he came, he went, the second
[1:08:18] coming of the Lord. And that's fine. But
[1:08:20] the problem with thinking of the second
[1:08:21] coming is that we think his spirit and
[1:08:24] everything went 2,000 years ago. No, it
[1:08:26] did not. Every form that he was came
[1:08:28] back to earth in the body of Christ in
[1:08:31] the people. So anything he did before he
[1:08:34] would do it. He could do it again. Why?
[1:08:37] Because he's present. He's here. That's
[1:08:40] right.
[1:08:41] So the disciples, you know, it's like
[1:08:44] when they got filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:08:46] and all of a sudden now things begin to
[1:08:47] happen that were so similar to Jesus,
[1:08:51] they were all questioning. Remember,
[1:08:52] they were nervous and why do he have to
[1:08:54] go? Why do you have still didn't
[1:08:55] understand even after Jesus rose again,
[1:08:57] he appeared to them and they're still
[1:08:59] struggling. They're still wondering
[1:09:01] because they don't understand the word
[1:09:03] until they receive the Holy Ghost and
[1:09:05] then they realize something's happened
[1:09:06] to me. And then they begin to see the
[1:09:09] same works as Jesus being manifested.
[1:09:13] And he's not there in a physical body
[1:09:15] anymore, but it's the same works. You
[1:09:17] know what they concluded? I wonder if
[1:09:19] they sang it in the first few nights. He
[1:09:22] is here. Hallelujah.
[1:09:26] He is here. Amen.
[1:09:29] He is here. Holy, holy. I will bless his
[1:09:34] name again.
[1:09:36] He is here. Listen closely. Hear him
[1:09:39] calling out your name. This was a
[1:09:42] revelation. He was gone in his body, but
[1:09:45] every other part of Christ was there
[1:09:49] manifesting itself. He hadn't gone
[1:09:52] anywhere.
[1:09:54] He's in the house. He's with us. He's
[1:09:58] living in us. There's no missing parts
[1:10:01] of Christ. Every bit of him is here and
[1:10:04] available to his people.
[1:10:07] I tell you friends, it's a powerful
[1:10:08] thing. And he says he did his min med
[1:10:10] minatorial work that he's doing now.
[1:10:12] That body must be in the presence of God
[1:10:14] at all times for intercession that God
[1:10:16] cannot see the sinner's sin. He you see
[1:10:19] that's why I say it's a double thing
[1:10:20] here because he's looking at that
[1:10:22] corporal body. He's looking at that lamb
[1:10:24] and he can only see the righteousness of
[1:10:26] God in your life. But beyond that, then
[1:10:29] he fills you with the Holy Ghost. So
[1:10:31] that he calls it, I'm going to send my
[1:10:33] comforter that I'm going to continue to
[1:10:36] comfort my people. I'm going to continue
[1:10:38] to address everything that comes in
[1:10:40] their life. It'll be the same Christ in
[1:10:42] the form of the Holy Ghost. And he'll
[1:10:45] care the same way that he cared when he
[1:10:48] was in his corporal body. There'll be
[1:10:50] nothing missing.
[1:10:53] Hallelujah. And knowing that, he sent
[1:10:55] back the Holy Spirit to continue to
[1:10:56] comfort his people. Does he care?
[1:10:59] Certainly, he cares. Now, he was to
[1:11:02] continue to care for his people. His
[1:11:04] people here on earth, he continues to
[1:11:08] care for his people here on earth. Next
[1:11:11] one. In the same manner that he cared
[1:11:15] for them when he was here, because he
[1:11:18] said in St. John the 15th chapter, if
[1:11:20] you want to make, I got notes laying
[1:11:21] here with these scriptures here. John
[1:11:23] 15:26-27
[1:11:25] he said when the Holy Spirit has come
[1:11:27] who the father would send in his name he
[1:11:30] would testify of him in other words he
[1:11:34] would do the same thing he did the Holy
[1:11:38] Spirit working through a tabernacle that
[1:11:41] he had sanctified would do the same
[1:11:44] thing that he did now what that ought to
[1:11:47] do for us then we know that right among
[1:11:51] us today We have the same comforting
[1:11:55] Lord Jesus in the form of the Holy
[1:11:58] Ghost, another office that God himself
[1:12:01] is working in. Amen. Praise be to God.
[1:12:05] Praise be to God.
[1:12:07] Blessed be his name. It's us that puts
[1:12:10] limitations on this. But no, he's here
[1:12:12] in every way.
[1:12:14] Everything he did in the four gospels,
[1:12:17] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:12:19] forever. And he that cometh to God, you
[1:12:22] better get rid of your denominational
[1:12:23] ideas. He that cometh to God must
[1:12:26] believe that he is.
[1:12:30] Now that's the revelation that brother
[1:12:32] Brandon brought out to us that Jesus is
[1:12:35] the revealed word of every hour
[1:12:39] when you see the word because Jesus is
[1:12:41] the word. Can you say amen? You say,
[1:12:42] "Well, no, Jesus, see, this is a this is
[1:12:45] a a nominal of main most of Christianity
[1:12:49] believes it this way. It's the Jesus in
[1:12:51] the four gospels, you see." But that's
[1:12:53] not just Jesus. Jesus is the revealed.
[1:12:56] Christ is the revealed word of every
[1:12:58] hour. So when you have the Jesus is the
[1:13:00] word, but when you have the word
[1:13:01] revealed and the Holy Ghost comes and
[1:13:04] makes that word live for your age, you
[1:13:07] have Jesus again
[1:13:09] manifesting. He's always been there, but
[1:13:11] he manifests the word for the hour. So
[1:13:14] that's why he said, "He that cometh to
[1:13:15] God," that's very general, but if you're
[1:13:17] going to come to God, you must believe
[1:13:20] that he is.
[1:13:24] Not he was.
[1:13:26] How much of Christianity believes in the
[1:13:28] Jesus that was? And that's fine. I'm not
[1:13:30] I'm not being critical of it. But the
[1:13:33] Bible says, "He that cometh to God must
[1:13:34] believe that he is." That means you
[1:13:36] believe he's the same yesterday or today
[1:13:39] and forever. He can do anything he's
[1:13:41] done before.
[1:13:43] Brother Bram says people are always
[1:13:45] praising God for what he did in the
[1:13:46] past, looking forward to what he's going
[1:13:48] to do in the future and missing what
[1:13:50] he's doing now. But what he's doing now
[1:13:52] is Jesus manifested for that hour.
[1:13:55] That's when you have the word
[1:13:57] manifesting in the same way he did 2,000
[1:14:00] years ago. You have Jesus again.
[1:14:04] Not just some figment of our imagination
[1:14:06] of the picture of the Hoffman's head.
[1:14:08] We'll see him in his body someday, but
[1:14:11] in every way he's here. Jesus is the
[1:14:13] word revealed in every hour.
[1:14:17] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Well, I'm
[1:14:19] enjoying this tonight. Praise the Lord.
[1:14:21] He said, did I finish that? Yeah. In
[1:14:23] another office that God himself is
[1:14:26] working in. So, the reaction from his
[1:14:29] disciples when he's leaving is is not
[1:14:31] good. Even when he rose again, they
[1:14:33] still disbelieved. He sighed at them
[1:14:35] because they just had a lack of
[1:14:36] believing. When you have been close to
[1:14:39] God that way and and have so much of God
[1:14:43] there in that flesh and they loved him
[1:14:45] and they like being around him, then
[1:14:48] you're going to get nervous about the
[1:14:49] life when he says he's going. The
[1:14:51] disciples showed this even after the
[1:14:53] resurrection. Their hearts were
[1:14:55] troubled. The transition had to be made.
[1:14:58] Why? To bring something better to the
[1:15:01] people. better than him being here in
[1:15:05] his corporal body in the flesh. I wonder
[1:15:09] how many of us if we had a choice, first
[1:15:12] of all, if we had a choice what hour we
[1:15:14] would live in,
[1:15:16] if if we're using our own minds, it
[1:15:18] wouldn't have been today.
[1:15:20] If we can live in all the generations
[1:15:22] that the prophets and then Jesus coming
[1:15:25] 2,000 years ago, if you had a choice,
[1:15:28] most of us would not choose today.
[1:15:31] We'd probably choose something that was
[1:15:33] more visible, like when he was Jesus of
[1:15:36] Nazareth walking the shores of Galilee.
[1:15:40] It's just safer.
[1:15:42] He's right there and I can touch him.
[1:15:46] But I'm trying to teach a faith that he
[1:15:48] was trying to teach doubting Thomas when
[1:15:49] he said, "Thomas, I'll let you touch my
[1:15:52] side if it helps you to believe, but
[1:15:53] blessed is he who has not seen and yet
[1:15:57] believes."
[1:15:59] You see, I've come to know the Jesus of
[1:16:02] the word, and he is a person. He's the
[1:16:05] same person that was here 2,000 years
[1:16:07] ago. But when he came in another form to
[1:16:09] the men on the road to Emmas after
[1:16:13] Emmas, you listening.
[1:16:16] When he came to the men on the road to
[1:16:18] Emmas, the Bible says in another form.
[1:16:22] So, I don't know what form that was, but
[1:16:24] it wasn't his normal form. And so
[1:16:26] they're talking with the men on the
[1:16:28] road. They're talking with the Jesus.
[1:16:30] They don't know who it is because he
[1:16:31] come in another form. Showing us he can
[1:16:33] come in another form. And it's all
[1:16:35] Jesus.
[1:16:37] He did it right after the resurrection.
[1:16:40] He's he's proclaiming
[1:16:43] future ways that Jesus could He was a
[1:16:46] pillar of fire in the Old Testament. He
[1:16:47] was a cloud.
[1:16:49] Christ was the one that influenced Moses
[1:16:52] to to leave Egypt. Can you say amen? and
[1:16:55] forsake all the things of Egypt. Hebrews
[1:16:58] said it was Christ for the reproach of
[1:17:00] Christ. Well, where was Christ and we
[1:17:02] know back? No, it was the living word.
[1:17:05] Moses followed the living word. Left
[1:17:07] Egypt, left all the riches for who? For
[1:17:10] Christ. So, he's the living word of
[1:17:12] every hour. And so, the men on the road
[1:17:15] to Emmas, you listen to Emmas. They're
[1:17:17] talking with him. At least I got his
[1:17:18] attention tonight. They're talking and
[1:17:20] they don't know who it is, but it's
[1:17:22] Jesus.
[1:17:25] Then they come they said did not our
[1:17:26] hearts burn within us as he walked with
[1:17:28] us by the way and while he opened to us
[1:17:30] the scripture this is the Jesus that
[1:17:32] Paul Leontaine
[1:17:34] has known for since I was 16 years old
[1:17:37] the Jesus that opens that Bible to me
[1:17:43] same Jesus with those men and the whole
[1:17:45] time how long a journey was it brother
[1:17:47] Dan two hours or three hours journey
[1:17:49] walking with them I was oh they were
[1:17:51] walking with him didn't even know who
[1:17:53] they were walking talking with didn't
[1:17:55] know it was Jesus but they were sure
[1:17:56] rejoicing in how he was opening the
[1:17:58] scripture and then they said why don't
[1:18:00] you come in have a coffee
[1:18:04] I'm paraphrasing it's the lefontaine
[1:18:06] standard revised version my dad used to
[1:18:08] say why don't you stay and have a coffee
[1:18:10] we're enjoying this and when he comes in
[1:18:13] he takes the bread they passed to him
[1:18:15] and by the breaking of the bread and the
[1:18:17] way he broke the bread their eyes were
[1:18:19] open they realized wow he's in a
[1:18:21] different form but this is Jesus
[1:18:25] It's the same Jesus in a different form.
[1:18:28] He's breaking bread. This is Jesus. I've
[1:18:30] been walking with Jesus all these years.
[1:18:33] Friends,
[1:18:35] who have you been walking with all these
[1:18:37] years in this message? It's not a man.
[1:18:40] It's not preachers. It's Christ who is
[1:18:44] opening the scriptures to you. You may
[1:18:46] be not be able to see a corporal body,
[1:18:49] but it's every bit Jesus Christ.
[1:18:53] And that's the Jesus that I know, the
[1:18:55] one who has opened the scriptures to me.
[1:18:57] I know I'll see his face someday. I look
[1:18:59] forward to seeing his face someday. I
[1:19:01] don't know all those features, but I'll
[1:19:03] look forward to him. I look forward to
[1:19:05] hugging him. I look forward to casting,
[1:19:07] if I have any crowns, casting them
[1:19:09] aside, and casting them at his feet,
[1:19:11] bowing before him. Can you say amen? I
[1:19:14] look forward to seeing him. And I
[1:19:16] believe it's going to be very soon. But
[1:19:18] I have no lack of what I know of the
[1:19:20] character of Jesus, the word of Jesus,
[1:19:23] all the works of Jesus. Everything that
[1:19:25] he has done, I have seen it. Even as a
[1:19:28] little boy, I watched the blind eyes be
[1:19:30] opened in Lima, Ohio. I've been
[1:19:32] privileged to see that. Everything he
[1:19:34] did in the Bible, I've seen him do it.
[1:19:38] That's a blessing.
[1:19:41] Praise the Lord. Will, Glory be to God.
[1:19:45] So those disciples begin to realize he
[1:19:48] it was him. He was still there living in
[1:19:51] them. That's why he could say he is
[1:19:53] here. Why is this laying in here from
[1:19:56] the prophet?
[1:20:00] What is important and he cares? Do you
[1:20:02] care? Why is it important for him to lay
[1:20:05] this truth in there that he cared for
[1:20:07] the people when he was here on earth but
[1:20:10] then he sent the Holy Ghost. I will not
[1:20:13] leave you comfortless.
[1:20:15] Let not your heart be troubled. He
[1:20:17] didn't want your heart to be troubled.
[1:20:20] You believe God, believe also in me.
[1:20:22] I'll send another comforter, the Holy
[1:20:23] Ghost. He'll continue to minister the
[1:20:26] same care through the ages as I have
[1:20:28] done while I've been here on earth. I'll
[1:20:30] do it again through the form of the Holy
[1:20:32] Ghost. Why is it important that he cares
[1:20:34] to you care? because you will never seek
[1:20:37] him with all your heart unless you know
[1:20:40] he is here. Now,
[1:20:43] can I say it again? I don't think we
[1:20:45] will diligently seek him with all of our
[1:20:48] heart unless we have a revelation he's
[1:20:50] here.
[1:20:52] He's available to us. He's He's looking
[1:20:55] to step into our needs.
[1:20:57] That's why this is important. You never
[1:21:00] seek him unless you know he's here now.
[1:21:02] No counseling time with someone works
[1:21:05] quite as good unless a person knows that
[1:21:09] he is present. Not just brother Paul,
[1:21:12] not just another counselor, but they
[1:21:14] know that Christ is listening. Christ is
[1:21:16] present and he has a direct answer and
[1:21:19] he has deliverance for you. When I'm in
[1:21:22] the counseling sessions now, I'm praying
[1:21:24] in my heart the whole time because if
[1:21:26] that atmosphere changes in a matter of
[1:21:28] just a few moments, I see the Lord step
[1:21:30] into that situation and then it's done.
[1:21:34] You could counsel intellectually for for
[1:21:37] weeks. Can you say amen? But that person
[1:21:39] first of all has to know that God is a
[1:21:42] God of now. He's a God of the present
[1:21:44] and he can deliver and he cares for your
[1:21:46] situation. Yeah, they have to know that
[1:21:50] if they walk in thinking that I'm going
[1:21:51] to help and they if they they walk in
[1:21:54] but we're looking for another presence
[1:21:56] to work through me. Can you say amen? Or
[1:21:58] come into the room or just come into
[1:22:00] that heart and all of a sudden they're
[1:22:02] broken down. Everything changes and he
[1:22:04] can give a direct answer and
[1:22:06] deliverance. No church service, no
[1:22:09] counseling would ever be as what it is
[1:22:11] unless that person knows he's present.
[1:22:13] No church service will ever be what it
[1:22:16] would be to you until you know he's in
[1:22:19] the house.
[1:22:23] I'm telling you friends, this will make
[1:22:25] us come to church different. Even on a
[1:22:27] Wednesday night when you're tired like
[1:22:28] you are tonight, you'll come to church
[1:22:30] different because it's not just another
[1:22:32] Wednesday night. He's in the house. I
[1:22:35] said he's in the house.
[1:22:38] He's present. And he that comes to God.
[1:22:40] He that comes to church must believe
[1:22:42] that he is.
[1:22:44] Hallelujah. Religion will still pray and
[1:22:47] see him as in heaven somewhere hoping he
[1:22:50] will send out a blessing. That's the way
[1:22:52] religion and a lot of Christianity, no
[1:22:54] offense, but they see it as they see
[1:22:56] Christ in heaven somewhere and hoping
[1:22:58] he'll just send out a blessing every now
[1:23:00] and then. Answer my prayer and send me a
[1:23:03] blessing. God is so distant. Jesus is so
[1:23:05] distant. We can't look at God that way.
[1:23:09] We must believe that he is. He's now.
[1:23:11] He's present. He's an ontime God. Can
[1:23:13] you say amen? He's an on-time God. He's
[1:23:16] a present God in every way. And we can
[1:23:20] do right now. What he has always done
[1:23:22] before, he can do it again. No limit, no
[1:23:25] limitations.
[1:23:27] God can do anything. We used to sing a
[1:23:30] song
[1:23:32] and I can't remember all the words right
[1:23:33] now, but it used to say, "God can do
[1:23:35] anything that he's done before."
[1:23:38] No limitations. What do I believe
[1:23:40] tonight? I believe a gospel right now
[1:23:42] and every day that has not one
[1:23:44] limitation on God to put anything in the
[1:23:47] past. Whatever he has ever done, he can
[1:23:50] do right now. Brother Paul, you're
[1:23:52] really stepping out here. Yeah, I'm
[1:23:53] stepping out in faith. Not because I
[1:23:55] have something super, but this is what
[1:23:58] the word says. Whatever he has done
[1:24:01] before tonight, he can do it again.
[1:24:04] Every part of Christ is here and
[1:24:06] available to the people. Hallelujah.
[1:24:09] It's not a different time. We haven't
[1:24:11] raised in this great intellectual time
[1:24:13] with the bride and all the quotes. No,
[1:24:14] no. It's Jesus Christ the same
[1:24:16] yesterday. And if you believe this
[1:24:18] message completely in his fullness with
[1:24:20] faith with it, you believe that Christ
[1:24:22] is here now.
[1:24:24] Last quote. And there were certain
[1:24:26] Greeks among them that came up to
[1:24:28] worship at the feast. The same came to
[1:24:30] for therefore to Philillip which was of
[1:24:32] Bethesda of Galilee. And they desired
[1:24:34] him saying sers we would see Jesus. And
[1:24:37] then for a text the regular campaign
[1:24:39] theme is Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the
[1:24:42] same yesterday today and forever. And
[1:24:43] now upon this word I would like to talk
[1:24:46] to you just a few minutes. It's a most
[1:24:48] unusual thing to think that someone or
[1:24:51] the world would question the words of
[1:24:53] the creator. But it's because it's
[1:24:56] dominated by unbelief and spirits of the
[1:25:00] enemy which make them to disbelieve. So
[1:25:04] everybody ought to be believing that if
[1:25:06] he's a creator, he's always a creator.
[1:25:09] If he created the heavens and earth, he
[1:25:12] can create tonight. But he's saying the
[1:25:15] reason most people don't believe that is
[1:25:17] we have been dominated by unbelief and
[1:25:20] spirits of the enemy which makes the
[1:25:23] people disbelieve.
[1:25:26] I don't believe that anyone ever heard
[1:25:29] that precious name of Jesus but what
[1:25:30] long to see him. I've had the privilege
[1:25:33] of preaching in many foreign nations and
[1:25:34] great crowds of people come out to hear
[1:25:36] the gospel. But I've never seen anyone
[1:25:38] in my life that ever heard of Jesus but
[1:25:41] what longed to see him. That's why he's
[1:25:44] reading this. The Greeks are saying sers
[1:25:45] we see we would see Jesus said never
[1:25:48] been in a meeting where the people they
[1:25:50] hear the name of Jesus and hear about
[1:25:51] him. They long to see him. There's just
[1:25:54] something about human beings that seems
[1:25:57] like the old Missouri slogan seeing is
[1:26:00] believing. And we rely so much upon the
[1:26:03] sense of sight
[1:26:06] as five sense senses control the body
[1:26:09] and a sense of sight is the gate to the
[1:26:11] soul. It's too bad the Protestant people
[1:26:13] don't know that the Catholic caught it
[1:26:15] long ago of little statues and monuments
[1:26:18] and so forth of saints but the eye the
[1:26:20] gate to the soul. And these Greeks had
[1:26:22] heard something about him and they came
[1:26:24] to find out who he was and what he was
[1:26:26] and they said sir we would see Jesus.
[1:26:29] Now, they didn't desire to see his
[1:26:31] works. That's an interesting quote
[1:26:32] there. They didn't desire to see his
[1:26:34] works. They only desired to see Jesus
[1:26:38] physically.
[1:26:40] And then if Hebrews 13:8, not if, but it
[1:26:45] is true, the same I'm closing right now.
[1:26:48] the the same yesterday, today, and
[1:26:51] forever is seemingly then that we would
[1:26:54] be able to see him today just like they
[1:26:58] did then if he's the same now. If the
[1:27:01] Bible said that he's the same yesterday,
[1:27:04] today, and forever, then he's got to be
[1:27:08] the same in principle, the same in
[1:27:13] power, the same in action, the same in
[1:27:18] motive
[1:27:20] and objective.
[1:27:23] Boy, that brings it to light. Jesus
[1:27:25] Christ the same yesterday, today.
[1:27:27] There's nothing lacking in Jesus
[1:27:29] tonight. He's in the house and he's not
[1:27:31] lacking anything. He can do whatever
[1:27:34] he's done before. You serve a God that
[1:27:36] way. Can you say you go to a church that
[1:27:38] believes that? How many believe that?
[1:27:40] You're around a group of people. Thank
[1:27:42] God that's not saying the days of
[1:27:43] miracles are passed. No. Jesus is the
[1:27:45] same yesterday, today, and forever. You
[1:27:48] ought to look that way when you go to
[1:27:49] work tomorrow. When you go to your
[1:27:50] pressures of life, when you go, we ought
[1:27:52] to keep this in front of us. What would
[1:27:54] we be if we keep this instead of all the
[1:27:56] thoughts of life that we keep keep this
[1:27:58] in front of us all day because you're
[1:28:01] going to hit some things. But if you
[1:28:03] hold that thought,
[1:28:05] he that comes to God believes that he
[1:28:07] is. He's present now. What's he want to
[1:28:09] do? I want to be available to you, Lord.
[1:28:12] I want to call upon you if someone needs
[1:28:14] prayer. I'm not going to get all just be
[1:28:18] jumbled, if that's a word, over
[1:28:20] something. I'm not going to let the
[1:28:22] devil make me all nervous. Whatever
[1:28:24] comes, if you got that mindset, he's
[1:28:26] here. He's present. And he's not lacking
[1:28:28] in anything.
[1:28:31] So, you're just looking for
[1:28:32] opportunities to say, "Okay, he's here.
[1:28:36] Here's a big one, Lord. Here's a big
[1:28:38] one." But you're here in every way. So,
[1:28:42] he's not afraid.
[1:28:45] So, why are we afraid?
[1:28:47] Did it ever occur to you that nothing
[1:28:49] has ever occurred to God?
[1:28:52] Amen.
[1:28:54] No surprises to him, no nervousness with
[1:28:57] him. He's in the boat and he's sleeping
[1:28:59] while the rest of them are worried about
[1:29:00] the storm. And he's sleeping, taking a
[1:29:02] nap. That's right. Gets up. They said,
[1:29:05] "Lord, don't you care that we're about
[1:29:07] ready to die here? Wake up. We're all
[1:29:10] getting ready to die."
[1:29:12] He says, "Oh, ye of little faith." Yes.
[1:29:16] Why are you so fearful? You know, I've
[1:29:19] preached this before. Jesus was more
[1:29:22] concerned about their fear than he was
[1:29:24] the storm.
[1:29:26] And I wonder if that's your life that
[1:29:29] you're calling on Jesus for your storm.
[1:29:31] But if your fear is bigger than the
[1:29:33] storm, he's more concerned about
[1:29:35] delivering you from your fear before he
[1:29:37] delivers you from your storm.
[1:29:40] That's what he addressed first. He
[1:29:42] doesn't look Lord. No, no, no. He looked
[1:29:45] at them and said, "Why are you so
[1:29:46] fearful? Why are you nervous? Why are
[1:29:49] you afraid?" And he had to work with
[1:29:51] them and work with them and finally get
[1:29:52] them to Pentecost in the upper room to
[1:29:54] get the Holy Ghost to get the faith they
[1:29:56] needed so they wouldn't have this
[1:29:57] nervousness. They learn to trust there's
[1:29:59] a God that's here. He's in the house.
[1:30:03] They didn't know that on the boat, but
[1:30:05] Jesus knew it so much that he's sleeping
[1:30:08] while the storm is going on. Oh, praise
[1:30:12] the Lord.
[1:30:14] Let's go home tonight and sleep a lot
[1:30:16] better. You've been letting the devil
[1:30:18] keep you up all night about stuff, about
[1:30:20] the storms in your life, how you're
[1:30:22] going to pay the bills, why don't you go
[1:30:24] home and get a good night's rest?
[1:30:25] Because the God that was in that boat is
[1:30:28] in your boat. Hallelujah. He's in your
[1:30:31] boat. He's in your house. He's in your
[1:30:35] soul. He's not nervous about your
[1:30:37] finances. You are. He's not nervous
[1:30:40] about your cancer.
[1:30:43] He's not afraid of that cancer. He's not
[1:30:46] afraid of your financial trouble. He's
[1:30:48] not afraid of what people said about
[1:30:49] you. He's not afraid of that. He's
[1:30:51] sitting in the boat. He's sleeping. And
[1:30:53] when he gets woke up, he wants to
[1:30:55] deliver you from your fears.
[1:30:59] I am at peace with the Lord Jesus
[1:31:02] because he's in the house.
[1:31:04] He's present. I just need to call him on
[1:31:06] the scene. I just need to bring him.
[1:31:08] He's the same. He said, "Oh, I'm trying
[1:31:11] to close." He says he's got to be the
[1:31:14] same. The last part of the quote there,
[1:31:16] he's got to be the same in every
[1:31:21] the same in principle, the same in
[1:31:23] power, the same in action, the same in
[1:31:26] motive, same in objective. He's got to
[1:31:29] be the same in every way except the
[1:31:33] corporal body.
[1:31:35] That's it. That's it. That's my service
[1:31:38] tonight. He is the same in every way
[1:31:43] tonight here.
[1:31:45] Hallelujah. Praise God. All of him. All
[1:31:49] that was in Christ, God. He poured into
[1:31:51] Christ. All that was in Christ, he
[1:31:53] poured into the church. That means all
[1:31:55] of him is here tonight. Hallelujah.
[1:31:57] There's no limitations. He's not lacking
[1:31:59] anything.
[1:32:01] It's all available by faith. It's all
[1:32:03] available to us. That's why it would be
[1:32:06] it would be up to him. But if there was
[1:32:08] a blind person here, if there's some, it
[1:32:10] doesn't matter. That's why we lay hands
[1:32:11] on the sick. We don't do the healing.
[1:32:13] But we have a promise. And what? Why are
[1:32:15] we holding such a faith? Why are we
[1:32:16] holding such We're holding that he can
[1:32:19] do what he's done before.
[1:32:21] It's not our job to do the healing. It's
[1:32:23] our job to believe that he can do what
[1:32:26] he's done before. If in his will, and
[1:32:29] brother Steven said this to me the other
[1:32:30] night, uh the other day at breakfast, I
[1:32:33] believe it was his there's only one
[1:32:34] thing that would change it. one thing
[1:32:36] that and that would be the will of God
[1:32:38] and we always accept the will of God but
[1:32:41] there's nothing there's no hindrances to
[1:32:43] faith we believe God's able to do it
[1:32:45] just like he did it before that's where
[1:32:47] we stand that's where we stand I'm not
[1:32:51] moving can you say amen what do they say
[1:32:53] in that statement say that's where
[1:32:55] that's my final stand and I'm not moving
[1:32:58] that's it I'm never moving from it he's
[1:33:01] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:33:04] he's in the house can you say amen
[1:33:06] He's in the house. Let's sing it.
[1:33:09] You believe he's in the house?
[1:33:12] He's in the house.
[1:33:14] Death had to flee.
[1:33:17] Now there is life. Where darkness used
[1:33:21] to be.

[1:33:49] move your faith. Anoint your faith
[1:33:52] tonight to believe it. Isn't just this

[1:34:06] Gideon.
[1:34:08] They just laughed at Jesus.
[1:34:11] He said she's You know this one, Brother
[1:34:15] Joseph. You know this one.
[1:34:19] Come on. I don't know this one very
[1:34:21] well.

[1:35:04] his name.

[1:36:41] she's only sleeping. Oh yes.
[1:36:45] And as he took her by the hand
[1:36:49] and she began to live again
[1:36:54] to praise the Lord. Yes. Some begin to
[1:36:59] sing

[1:45:00] and make me whole.
[1:45:06] I need you now.
[1:45:10] Pour your spirit
[1:45:12] out.
[1:45:15] How many would say, I need him now. Pour
[1:45:17] your spirit out. It's not just in
[1:45:19] church. May I be filled and take it with
[1:45:21] me tonight. And whatever need comes up,
[1:45:25] I pray you'll have a bold faith to say,
[1:45:26] "We're going to take that to the Lord
[1:45:28] right now." Don't be fearful. That's
[1:45:31] what St. Hastes when the body of Christ
[1:45:33] backs off in intimidation. I'm not
[1:45:34] worthy. Get over those things. Got some
[1:45:36] sin, bring it under the blood, confess
[1:45:38] it, but you stand there as a son and
[1:45:40] daughter of God. Whatever it is,
[1:45:42] sickness or whatever it is, you take it
[1:45:43] home with you tonight because you take
[1:45:45] him in your heart. You take him home
[1:45:47] with you as well. How many believe that
[1:45:49] tonight? Father, we thank you for the
[1:45:50] service tonight. Thank you for the
[1:45:52] healings and Lord, the faith that's been
[1:45:54] anointed, not by me, but by the word of
[1:45:57] God. Lord, may we stand boldly with him.
[1:45:59] May we stand against the ws of the
[1:46:02] enemy. Lord, when he shoots his darts,
[1:46:04] may we hold up the shield of faith. God,
[1:46:06] I pray that we'd go forth tonight as
[1:46:08] soldiers in your army. That you would,
[1:46:10] Lord, make these things real to us,
[1:46:13] Lord. whatever situation we're in, help
[1:46:15] us, Lord, that you would dissolve all
[1:46:18] fear and that we would put the future
[1:46:21] completely in your hands. May we walk in
[1:46:24] this perfect fa faith. We pray as we
[1:46:26] commit the evening to you. Those who are
[1:46:28] on the online, I pray you'd go forth and
[1:46:31] heal them tonight. Somebody maybe
[1:46:33] stretched out their hand, somebody stood
[1:46:35] up in their living room. Oh God, I pray
[1:46:38] that you'll touch them just now and
[1:46:39] bring healing to their body. whatever
[1:46:41] need they have, we know that you're
[1:46:43] mindful. We commit the service to you
[1:46:45] now in Jesus name. Amen. Can we give him
[1:46:48] praise one more time before we go and
[1:46:51] thank him for what he's done?
[1:46:55] Oh, God is so good, friends. God bless
[1:46:56] you, brother. God bless you all. God is
[1:46:59] so good. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:47:02] Hallelujah.
[1:47:05] I have a father.
[1:47:07] Well, if I have a father,
[1:47:10] I have a father.
[1:47:18] He calls me his own.
[1:47:22] [Music]
[1:47:25] He'll never
[1:47:28] leave
[1:47:30] me.
