========================================

in john 13 verse 31 therefore when he was gone out and he's speaking of judas when he left the room when judas went out jesus said now is the son of man glorified and god is glorified in him if god be glorified in him god should also god shall also glorify him in himself and shall straightway glorify him it's a it's a couple of mysterious scriptures and for years you read these things and you try to ponder them and you look at them and as you grow in the lord they become more and more clear but it's always been puzzling to me just how all that is worded we know we know jesus gave glory to the father we know jesus gave glory to god in his life he always glorified god but then now he says now the he's asking the father to come and glorify him and so he goes on if you skip over to john 17 he's speaking of the same thing when he says in john 17 and verse 1 and 2 these words spake jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son also may glorify thee so he's echoing this again as thou hast given him power over all flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou has given him and this is eternal life that they may know thee the only true god and jesus christ whom now has sent so this glorifying of the son is related to giving eternal life to as many as i've given him remember last sunday eternal life is living for others and when jesus said that greater works will you do he said to the church the works that i'm doing you will do also everything jesus is doing he can repeat through his body but then he says greater work should you do when we found out last sunday what's greater works than all the miracles signs and wonders that jesus did he said the greater work is not somebody's healed of cancer some of the greater works is that you have the power to impart eternal life to someone else because having eternal life is greater than physically being healed temporarily the church has power to do that jesus said it amen so then he's in the subject of being glorified and the last one is john 17 if you wouldn't mind in verse 21 he says that they all may be one as thou father art in me he's praying for the church here as believers before he leaves that they all may be one as thou father art in me and i in thee that they may also may be one in us that the world may believe that the thou has sent me and the glory which thou gavest me i have given them that they may be one even as we are one so now the next step is that the glo he had the glory of the of the of god in his life and now he says lord the glory that we have and the oneness that we have i want them to have that glory too in them so now i in them verse 23 and thou in me that they may be perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them as thou has loved me when this glory comes it will bring true oneness when this glory comes in the church it will bring true oneness and remember it's not a one night event because paul says we are changed from glory to glory to glory and the more glory we get the more one we should become and i got everybody on board so far amen i want to speak on the glory that makes us one father bless your word anointed father and we recognize in humility the insufficiency of man to meet needs that are crucial in other men's lives but lord we pray that you'll minister to those hearing here today and those on streaming lord that you will do something supernatural in our mess lord in our hearts and change us from glory to glory we thank you for the songs we thank you for the special we thank you lord to feel the fellowship and to feel your presence here today may it all change us and may we learn something of you as we sit at your feet and we ask it in the name of jesus christ amen and amen once you shake somebody's hand before you seated god bless you i've been thinking lately about relationships and um i heard some good feedback from a couple wednesday nights i did hear on betrayal and uh in those kind of unique services because i got pretty down rubber meets the road about relationships and about betrayal and speaking of that and i got some good feedback from it so i feel the lord leading me to go into relationships a little bit talk about them but i have probably more questions than i have answers right now in talking about relationships i think it's a very important subject i think that we can't talk about it enough and so when we talked about those the betrayal that jesus experienced then we realized that we experienced betrayal as well and the effect that it has on human beings is really pretty strong sometimes when we are betrayed when we are abandoned when we are neglected sometimes it happens when we're children in fact most the time it happens when we're children you know we can have the best of parents but no parent is perfect and parents have different issues and different things they're learning as they go along but then you have the extreme situations where a child was actually abandoned the child was neglected and these have a a long-term effect on human beings we don't deal with betrayal very well we don't do deal with abandonment very well so when we when we come into that i wanted to learn from jesus life as he come to the final hours of his life i was looking at jesus and how he reacted to betrayal because as i said there's no man that's ever been betrayed like jesus was there's no man who has lost his friends like jesus was at the end in the time when he needed friends in the time he needed support in the time he needed commitment from his disciples in the time that he needed his friends the most that's when they all abandoned him his closest friends even peter james and john who he trusted many times as being exclusive to bring in a room to pray for a dead man or dead girl and raise him to life he had he had close friendships with these men and when the end when it was all said and done there was a betrayal of every one of they all forsook them they all left him and some of them screaming out in their loyalty to him i would never leave you jesus i would never leave you and he said peter before the crows you'll deny me three times and so human energy and human commitment wasn't enough and so the loneliness that he experienced the betrayal i feel i feel oh lord is it true that you ended your life and come to the end with no one there you were completely alone is it to my heart just rejoices in the lord and goes out to the lord today that he would experience that but don't forget our lord had to experience everything that we experienced our lord had to go through every temptation that we're tempted by the bible said he was tempted at all points as we are and tempted by a sexual lust tempted by all the things we think well jesus never experienced that no in order to be a high priest he had to go through everything people say well why do you have to be born a baby and go through the teenage years why did why couldn't he just come as a lamb at 33 years old old and go right to calvary because he had to be born a baby and go through every life situation go through his teenage years so that when you go to pray he understands what you're going through when a teenager is lonely and crying out to god he understands because he was a teenager as well our lord had to be the right he was a kinsmen redeemer redeemer but he had to be a right faithful high priest who had lived out every area of your life can somebody say man can somebody raise your hand and say my lord went through every season of life that's why i love him so much can you say man but betrayal he went through betrayal and being abandoned and he went through loneliness more than any other human being has ever went through before and he didn't deserve that he didn't deserve to lose his friends but you see jesus i'm watching him because he did not get into these molly grubs of this victim mentality he didn't close himself off he didn't say i'm finished with everybody he said he didn't say i'm not going to calvary and he had the choice to leave it all and say i can't believe i've been abandoned i'm going to go live my own life he had the choice and yet when he was abandoned and betrayed he made the decision to head straight towards calvary i'm learning something from his life that he didn't become a victim mentality even though he was falsely accused he said i'm not going to let this get to me because i understand why they're doing this maybe he doesn't understand all of it but he had to understand i see this i see the big picture and it's amazing to me i've got to finish in this area but he says it's amazing to me to see jesus came into something that not only endured the mistreatment of the betrayal and the mistreatment of judas and the mistreatment of his own disciples but he kept walking towards the sacrifice and death that would correct the core problem in human beings all right i thought i'd need to say that one again jesus made the choice in that betrayal to keep walking towards the sacrifice now i'm going to preach about relationships you better be listening real close jesus when he was betrayed made the choice to walk towards sacrifice and a death to himself that would correct the core problem that's in human beings and any other choice wouldn't have been the victory and the freedom that we sang about this morning freedom to worship freedom to dance you can't even do that or sing that unless he went to calvary for you can i get an amen this morning unless some you couldn't even come back into relationship with god to talk to him this morning unless somebody made a sacrifice for your life unless somebody said i'm headed to calvary anyway i'm gonna do it alone but for the future of these people for the future of relationship i'm going to go the hard way i'm going to go the via dolorosa i'm going to go to calvary i'm going to go to the death because i know that will be their victory over this betraying spirit over this thing that says i'm going to deny you i'm going to put my wall up i'm going to become an island i'm going to go by myself jesus said the only way to solve that is to go to calvary and sacrifice so that i break down the middle wall of partition between man and god you talk about walls up people had a wall towards god and god had a wall towards them he did yeah because you in sin you're born in sin you're unacceptable to god but i did so much and i gave so much to the united way without calvary and the blood you're unacceptable to god it's not your good works that make you a christian and so to to break down the middle wall partition to break down the walls between god and man there had to be a sacrifice made you'll never have better relationships until sacrifices are made until humility comes in is that okay with everybody if it's okay with you i'll continue and if it's okay with you it's okay with me that you don't even say amen today you just listen to restore the relationship with god lost in the garden of eden and to restore oneness and relationship between god and man to bring back ultimate oneness which is what jesus is speaking him and the father were one and he says i pray that they would become with us as we are one and then i pray that they would become one with one another now this is a prayer over the church before he left this is a prophecy how many believe that if anybody's prayer is going to be answered it's going to be jesus prayer you may think god's not answering your prayer but god always answers prayer whether it's yes or no but i can tell you one thing there's no doubt jesus prayer is going to be heard and you know what his prayer is here that they may be one as we are one that they would come to true oneness not through a denomination not through a mechanical legislated thing not through a world council of churches no no no no no they're going to use that scripture by the way they're gonna the the the church systems are using this scripture that we all become one all the denominations become one but they're not allowed to take that and apply that scripture they're not allowed to use that mechanically it's god that will make us one with one another it's the holy ghost glory be to god it's only by the holy ghost that the church becomes one it's actually when we break down our denominational barriers that god and by the only by the holy ghost one spirit do we become one it's only by the glory of god and so now questions you know there's questions about relationships that i've had i trust you're not offended by this but the things that i ask why under this great restoration message is family relationships still lacking why does someone say that they have a relationship with god and still have their walls up and their grudges to certain ones and favor others within the church just some questions why do some relationships cause other relationships to break up am i allowed to ask questions i don't even know all the reasons to these but i'm asking god why is this happening why why why why does why is it that when someone repents the grudge is still held against them for years why can some talk so religious and be so seem so close to god but have years of unresolved issues with their children and their wife hello has everybody left the building i don't mean this i don't mean this isn't this is 33 years of pastoring and a lot of these questions i ask myself because i've seen these breakdowns in my response to relationships i'm just asking the questions i'm asking you to take take them home with you and consider it why is it someone repents and the grudge is still held for years why can some talk told religious online on the internet close to god but have years of unresolved issues with children unforgiving spirit why can someone preach such wonderful things across the pulpit and but they can cut you off and disown you and label you through their preaching in a certain category why does that happen why do people say they are a christian and look for reasons to separate from the body of christ why are families sometimes completely locked up maybe because there's a secret rule in the family we don't talk about that don't talk about that children we don't talk about that we don't go there why are families locked up because of it and a lot of times daddy has locked him up and doesn't realize he's doing it i'm talking about relationships i'm saying that if if we have been restored in a full back to eden relationship unhindered because remember oneness intimacy that adam and eve had with god into intimacy the world has twisted intimacy and made it sex intimacy is not sex it's part of it but in a relationship with husband and wife intimacy is a relationship without walls and there's you can talk about anything because there's no walls up between you that's real intimacy so how many marriages are married having relations and you know what i'm talking about but no intimacy the walls have been up for years we don't talk about that we don't go there he's hiding something or she's hiding something or the children are hiring something and nobody's allowed to talk about it's got the family all locked up trying to come to church and raise their hands and trying to be free and there's no talk about it there's no openness there's no alpinatus conversations if all the walls are up listen i i'm interested in a gospel and a message that is preached that brings deliverance not just here at church and not just to help your relationship with god but that can trickle down into our families and our relationships god please bring the reality of the blood of jesus christ to the people i don't want to be a big preacher i don't want to be a big church i'm really not interested in it how many is here today doesn't matter to me my whoever is here i want there to be a better relationship with god when they leave and a better relationship with the body of christ and better relationships and families and better relationship even to the people who hate you and maybe never will like you your response is everything and if we can't get there then there's something wrong with how we're preaching the message because i'm not interested in getting you built up emotionally so that you feel good today and go right back to the walls that you have praise the lord so why why why my so many y's i could go on all day with the wise i have i have a million of them but you know that's that's kind of staying on the negative we'd all be pretty depressed when i if i spent this whole service on why how do i get to the wise i want to get to the answers i want to get to some victories you probably got a million wives you can tell me why is uncle soul soul never talk to me why does aunt lou i shouldn't use that because we have we had aunt lou in the family i didn't mean aunt lou why does aunt sue i can't use that one either man i got a lot of ants a lot of uncles why does this person you probably got a lot of wise too and the question is is that how come relationships aren't better if jesus said this effect will affect marriages will affect families if this is bringing us back to eden then where's the proof of it it's good now not let's not be so negative because we see some families that grow in marriages that grow you're sitting amongst people that marriages were restored that was impossible they shouldn't even be sitting together today today but by god's grace and the blood of jesus christ they're sitting together and their marriage has been restored so let's not be all negative but but for those of us who struggle sometimes and say lord why is this day why is this way we want i've been asking these questions now on wednesday night brother rap we've seen something that brother rath was bringing in this in the study of the church ages last wednesday night of every month brother wrap i'm giving a commercial here last wednesday night of every month brother raps taking us to the seven church ages you'd be good to come get you a church age book and study it out together it's great well one thing that we found that the godhead is he studying the godhead how god was one how the father-son holy spirit that's been split up into three different personalities is actually a detriment to the church because we realize you can never split god into three personalities it's three offices father son holy ghost and so we're learning about the godhead and we're learning that he's one he can't be anything else but one jesus said when you see me you see the father okay it's not a different personality so we're learning about that but one thing that i learned wednesday night is that god has is not to be just a doctrine taught to us there's so much more to us the reason why we need to know the godhead the reason why we need to understand how god was in christ because we can understand how god was in christ we can start understanding how god is living in us so it's the revelation of it it's not a doctrine it's not as brother rap said it's not an academic study but it's something in in fact it's not meant to be understood in our minds it's another point brother rap made it's that understanding the godhead in these minds you're never going to understand it and man for 2000 years has tried to understand that tried to put it together tried to explain it try to split it up 80 325 a.d split god into three different personalities messed with the baptism did all these other things it's all men trying to figure out but yet we can't really understand it with our minds god doesn't want us to catch it in our minds he wants us to catch it by revelation oh praise the lord in fact it's not meant to be understood in our minds but beyond academic study we see as brother wrap said it's god's heart from the before the beginning and this wonderful condescension of god and what is it it's the condescension of god god coming down getting closer to us all the time and god becoming one with man his 6 000 year process since the fall of condescending condescending condescending until finally he comes in a human being like us not like us in the sense that jesus was virgin born we weren't virgin bored but he was the full human being and god said i'll pour all of myself into this human being what was he saying it's god saying i'm coming down so that i can live in my temple which is not this church in the temple of the souls of men that's the godhead [Applause] it's god's great mystery expressed to us that god in christ were one and we in christ are one it's god getting closer all the time and one thing at the end of his teaching wednesday night intrigued me satan has fought this truth of the godhead more than any other truth he has messed with it he hates satan he hates this teaching that christ could be the fullness christ could be the fullness of god in flesh satan hates this why does satan hate this that actually the god could pour himself the completion of himself pour himself completely in a human being jesus christ satan hates that he doesn't like that i'm going to tell you in a minute why he's been exposed we know why he's jealous of why he doesn't like it but he is thought that god could dwell in humans in perfect oneness so here's two things that god could be in jesus christ in his fullness but that god by spirit could dwell in the human beings i'm not talking about a relationship where we just say i'm trying to be like jesus and i'm trying to be like the father and i've i've i've uh i've adjusted myself to be a better person to be like jesus and so i'm trying to be like the father and father that's not the relationship friends the relationship is by spirit by spirit that his own spirit is living within you that is how we're one and satan can't stand that doctrine no can't be true can't that that god could dwell in humans in perfect oneness he can't stand it it could not be so and so he takes and splits god into three personalities of father son and holy spirit you've probably never heard these things before i encourage you to study your bible study the word of god the open book from the last days the restoration ministry to bring us back into the truths that were lost for 2 000 years in church history trinity is number one the trinity truth is not based in the bible it's not based you say well sure seems like it because he's talking to the father you have to understand that because if you take that and say he's a different personality than the father you take it too far and you make god too instead of one and he's only one he doesn't want worshipping three different entities that's idolatry god sold you excuse me god so if satan sold you i'm going to quote the prophet's word satan sold you the doctrine of the trinity to make an idolater out of you because if you read your bible it's idolatry that was the problem all along serve me i'm one god get rid of the other gods don't serve two or three don't serve 50. ra or egypt whatever god it is god i don't want you serving other gods i'm the one true god i want you worshipped only to me amen those who are bible readers know that i'm right on the bible so we could never fully say all of god poured himself into one best vessel and this way splits god why is he split into three personalities i got to finish with this because i got a lot of other stuff so why did he split into three personalities so we could never say all of god poured into one vessel god couldn't do that no he wasn't fully god he was just the second person of the trinity his doctrine of the trinity wants to limit that full truth that god could put himself in a man that way also to make an idolater out of you to lie and say it's not really the same as fear as same spirit in christ to say the spirit in christ was not the same spirit as god it's the father living in the son a third personality of the same spirit in fellowship with the father but not really the father that's a lie that you tell the people that it's not really the father it's just a good fellowship between in relationship between the father and son but it's not really the father living in him i'm here to tell you it was the father the fullness of the father living in jesus christ he messed with oneness he is limiting relationship to fellowship with a different personality rather than relationship based on it's the same spirit and then he messes is what brother rap said he messed with baptism as people will come to give their lives to christ now listen now people will come and make the act and step and there's a young girl i'm talking to today the young grand girl that will talk about baptism she wants to be baptized god's led her heart human beings will come and take the step for baptism and they're going to take on his name they're supposed to take on his name that means oneness when a wife gets married she should she used to take on her husband's name that's the way it was that's the way it should be it's in other words my wife became rebecca lafontaine and she was glad to do that and she's glad to take my identity and come underneath my identity i shouldn't say underneath but come to oneness with me but part of becoming one is to say i don't want to be a separate entity now i'm willing to take on your name now if that's true in human beings that's true with god can you say amen look how satan messes up the baptism and say no no let's twist this baptism you're not going to take on his name because nobody can get that close to god nobody come in that oneness with god where they actually take on his name and oneness so let's mess with the baptism when you get baptized baptize them in the name of titles so when they worship god they're just worshiping this different personality they're worshiping the father and like brother rap said the little girl's confused in in the sunday school class at a at a baptist church excuse me baptist but she's asking which which one do i worship the most the father the son or the holy spirit it brings confusion we only serve one god right and so now satan says i'll mess with the baptism because now when they come at that precious moment to take on his name that means i become one with him can you say a man let's mess that up and you don't really become one with him don't take on his name be baptized in the titles and start to worship all three in your life ah what a deception i just want you to get this point that's what i thought of wednesday night satan is messing with relationship what's he really doing he's limiting this thing that says man and god can become one in a close relationship i'm going to make it about titles i'm going to make it about positions that's why i can't stand it when people are more about position even in coming to church they're more about what position they hold than about christ and they'll make decisions based upon positions and i listen friends this is about relationship this isn't about rules this isn't about positions this is about who's who jesus dissolved that when he washed the disciples feet when he said wash one another's feet you know what he's dissolving positions because the guy that's on the top is going to wash the stinky dirty feet of the lowest guy in the congregation jesus dissolved all positions praise the lord i'm having a good time today even if you're hesitant of where i'm going look at satan messing with relationship no i'm going to limit being that close to say that i'm one with god and i'm taking on his name and through the holy ghost i'm going to become one with the lord i'm going to limit it make it titles that our our attention is on the titles rather than the man you know my children i'm a father i'm a son and i'm a husband but i have a connection with my children i don't want them to be close to me just because i'm their father i want to know their hearts and i want to give my heart to them because this is the closest not because i have the title i could use my title as father i could exercise my authority even when they're not listening even when they're 30 years old i can say well i'm the father you need to do what i say well that's a real good relationship that has no relationship in it is anybody with me here this morning satan messes with the the truth because here it is you want some more proof of it that day that jesus said i and my father are one how many knows he said it i and my father are one it says the jews picked up stones to throw stones at them well who's getting mad at the oneness satan in the people is always angry at the oneness god's people becoming one in relationship with the father now i'll tell you why he's written sinful because what you have if you have the holy ghost and you're becoming one with god and you're one with god by the holy ghost when you're doing that you have a relationship that satan i'm going to tell satan this morning satan i have something that you can never have [Applause] he has been envious from the very beginning of god's children he has been jealous of god's children that's why we have little jealousies come up in the congregation sometimes we should never be jealous of one another if someone excels in the kingdom of god we should rejoice with him but instead it's jealousy oh i want to be there i can't do oh then they put somebody down no if somebody's like brother bram said about enoch he said listen he said he said i'm not going to criticize enoch being translated walking with god so close he went into rapture he said if someone could get that close to god i'm not going to criticize him praise the lord but i'm here to serve satan notice today i'm going to tell him satan i know he's listening he comes to church more than some of you all satan i have in my heart by the holy ghost a relationship with the lord jesus christ that you can never have that's why he hates me so much it's not because he thinks that i'm a good preacher he hates my relationship with god unfettered no walls under the blood of jesus christ i've come back into eden again what was eden unhindered relationship would god by the holy spirit come down in the cool of the evening and cooed with his children adam and eve there was no sin they weren't afraid of god they weren't afraid to talk to god they fellowshipped in the cool of the evening and it was unhindered relationship the blood of jesus christ is bringing god's children back to unhindered relationship not through a priest not through a pope not through a church but you can go directly to god i'll tell you satan's envious if you got that this morning you say praise the lord i got a relationship with him unhindered satan that's why he don't like you and he's tried to stop that relationship from the very beginning including making a false baptism false teaching of the trinity he fights to this day he fights your mind how many raise your hand said the devil fights my mind how many say the devil always tries to question you i don't i don't know if you're one of them you made a mistake the other day i don't even know if you're a child of god how many has that devil speaking to you the reason he does it is he resents he's jealous of your relationship with christ he can't have that he wanted power lucifer arose tried to take the kingdom influence the third of the stars and he wanted to lift his throne above the throne of god he wanted to be worshiped like god he's always wanted that position and then god comes down glory be to god and he hands all the creative power to his son adam not to an angel to his son adam on earth and says adam this earth is yours i created this one specifically for you and guess what you have all the power to change animals names to change mountains to create whatever you want you've got creative power and satan's going but that's what i wanted i want that creative power how many know satan can't create he only perverts what god's already done he cannot create anything but he's wanted it i want it i want it i want it i want that creative power and god comes and gives it to you sons and daughters of god living in you by spirit no wonder he's jealous of you no wonder he fights against you because you've got the very relationship i don't care what you feel about yourself today you might have had a defeated week but you got the holy spirit in you that says amen to the word of god you can tell satan this week start your week different you can tell before you leave this building satan i may not be perfect yet but i've got a connection to god you can never have somebody say praise the lord [Applause] hallelujah this is a quote from brother branham when sometimes when i catch their eyes in this discernment when sometimes i catch their eyes that's how i get them in that channel you see and then it's not mind reading it's not psychology if it is then paul used it when he was looked when he looked upon the man and said i perceive you have faith to be healed i will grant you this it is psychology in this way so this is quite an explanation here brother bryan didn't believe in psychology to try to help people in the sense of being in the answer but when he and the lord used him to discern hearts he said it's that's not psychology people thought well he's reading the mind he's just like doing using psychology no no he said if that's true paul would have been using that but he says i will grant you this it is psychology in this way if psych of course means the mind and it's the mind of christ that the human being has the privilege to enter into and know the mind of christ hallelujah what a reality to dwell in the channel of christ you you think it was just jason that stood there and raised his hand he didn't know there was another brother that was watching that needed that who felt like i've got cancer in the mind you think that's him acting and he's human no no he's tapped into a channel he said i want to stand in the gap for everybody who's got cancer of the mind everybody's got cancer the mind of christ comes in and so hallelujah he says he says and that the human being has the privilege to enter in and know the mind of christ hallelujah what a reality to dwell on the channel christ we unworthy mortals have been brought in to be sons and daughters of god to be fellow citizens and oh my i get to shouting when i get noticed into that realm where even angels can't come you say angels yes sir we're sons and daughters angels are servants that's right the servants cannot go where sons and daughters will go they can't enter into that relationship for their servants and worst sons and daughters so satan can't enter this relationship and not even an angel can have this type of relationship with god not even angels can have what you have access to this morning somebody say praise the lord not even angels angels step back here i come that's the old song used to sing angels step back here i come i just got to praise him for everything he's done i want to cry holy holy i don't know if sister debbie remembers this glory glory glory angels step back here i come because it's all around the throne of god and the angels are worshiping but listen they're worshiping because he's the creator but we're worshiping because he's the redeemer and angels can't sing that song so they're all worshiping every day but then when he's declared the redeemer the angels got to step back and say what do you mean and that's when your angels step back here i come i just got to praise him for everything he's done it's a song the angels can't sing and they don't have a relationship that believers have directly to christ amen so the glory makes us one let's let's let's move on the glory according to our texts come into christ made him one with the father and then he says now my glory he says that they all may be one and the glory which thou gavest me i have given them that they may be one so now let's take this a step deeper everybody still with me the glory that makes us one jesus refers often to the glory especially mostly in the book of john at the end it's at the end he said it a couple of times but that's the end he's over over again saying to his disciples the hour has come for me to be glorified the hour has come for the father to glorify himself and me now just to be simple the glory here it means the splendor the radiance the distinguished quality and beauty of his character in other words everything that god is the splendor the radiance of god the distinguished not the miracles of god not the miracles and signs of god but the beauty of his character the splendor the highness the radiance that's the glory of god and that comes in that's beyond just having a bible and have a mechanical teaching we're not changed just because we have the intellect of the bible we're changed when the glory of god comes down it's the glory of god that changes us and so now the glory is the splendor the radiance and jesus points to the hour where he's coming where it's coming to him he says i have glorified your name on earth now is the now is the hour that the father glorifies in me i want you to notice it's at the end at the most dark time of jesus life he's forsaken he's betrayed he's alone he's scourged he's whipped and god's glory is setting in more than it ever has i think we can learn something that when we think it is our lowest darkest time that's when god gets the glory the most or he should see nobody's seen that it's going on in jesus and at his darkest time he says the hour has come betrayed alone nobody his darkest weakest hour and that's when he proclaims but the hours come that the father is going to glorify himself in me i've glorified his name i've glorified him in earth and now he's going to come and glorify me and some people think well that was when he was resurrected in his new body because the bible does say brother paul that he hadn't descended yet don't touch me because he had an ascending yet in the holy ghost the holy ghost hadn't come yet because he was not glorified yet the bible says he wasn't glorified well yeah that's that's the glorified of his glorified body that's the ending of it but i hear scriptures that show that the glory of god is already upon him and the glory of god is coming more and more at his darkest hour why is that because because god likes to get the glory and god likes to bring more glory to you as you're suffering through something that nobody else sees if your heart is obedient saying lord i yield to you i yield to you through this suffering i've been mistreated but i'm yielding myself to you that's the character in radiance that's the glory nobody sees i believe it's because the characters express because it should have been a different reaction of how people were treating him he should have reacted different he should have left he should have been finished but he has really moved into deeper oneness with god this is the expression of his glory his glory brings deeper oneness relationships his glory brings deeper oneness everybody awake here it wasn't a doctrine it wasn't just a bible it's the glory of god and is expressing i find no place there at the end where there's only one or two places that he goes into the temple and he opens the book and he reads the scroll at the last all scripture is being fulfilled but he doesn't have a bible there the glory of god is is manifesting himself through him and he's glorious he's he's glorifying the father's name he's glorifying him and god is coming that to the glory of god is there and there's no bible there there's no doctrine there it's the glory of god expressing in him and in 17 2 he said he has in 17 john 17 2 as thou has given him power over all flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou has given him it says he has power over all flesh it's not controlling him he's controlling what's happening because of the glory of god to give power to give eternal life to others listen he's the glory of god causes him to control what's going on rather than it controlling him that's where i want to live it's only by the glory of god not through psychology in the 10 steps to perfection it's when the glory of god comes is that we react different to something amen we know we he received power to raise the dead raised from the dead we all know he was crowned with glory the bible says he was crowned with glory he was given a glorified body but notice he has come into the glory before that we think of glory in different ways but at the end at rapture time that's that's we think of that it's going to be raptured that's from the glory of god that's but god likes to express his glory inside of you when you get a new body according to the scripture you'll think man that's when the glory of god is completely taken over that's when i'm going to have the glory of god but i want to let you know the glory of god expressed is expressed before that in the darkest times that's when he really expresses let me say it to this way another way to explain it to you now we have jesus come as a virgin born human being but virgin born so he didn't have any sin can you say amen so god comes to think my isn't that wonderful to see god in a in a virgin born body expressing god's fullness coming a virgin born body well we think why the glory of god in that but even greater glory is when god would come and bring his presence in a sin-born body like yours could i safely say that there could be more glory in the church than even jesus christ when he was on earth because that was the virgin born body your sin born and god's glory comes by the holy ghost changes your desires and raises you up [Applause] that's not belittling jesus christ because it's the same jesus christ in you but which has more glory in a virgin born body or in a sinborn body god likes to get glory out of broken people broken things last sunday i said the last call he said send him to the wedding feast and all the normal people got invited and they begin to make excuses saying i bought a cow i bought a wife and i haven't bought a wife i've married a wife i bought i bought a i got a piece of land and they made an excuse that i can't come i can't come i'm busy i'm busy i can't come so he said all right go go get the lame the halt the healing revival those that are sick and then when all those come he said i still have room go out on the highways and hedges and compel them to come in and the prophet comments and he says he says the good the bad and the indifferent the last call is the good the bad and the indifferent that's why i asked you last sunday what are you going to do if these seats fill up with the good the bad and the indifferent and you're looking over saying that's a lot of tattoos buddy it's interesting how people religious people sometimes will react well she needs to she needs to do this she needs to dress better she needs to do that she's not allowed to do that because i'm not allowed to do it come on you see if you're asking that question i have a problem with your experience i want to do my hair her that way if she gets to do that i want to do it you have a problem you don't understand what you're doing and what you're why we dress the way with you but when you can sit when you can sit there dressing modest like your the word says to do and you've got 300 other people that aren't dressing modest beside you now trust me i'm not going to let somebody in here is just wearing a bikini but when you can you you if you know where you stand you can sit next to and love and pray someone through the holy ghost with all of them sitting next to you that way because you know where you stand if you don't know where you stand you're going to be influenced by them oh it's okay yeah we can't you know we kind of we're kind of loose on those things no we're not right we preach it like the bible says it the word modesty came from the bible it has a meaning and this is because a lot of churches have dumped it out we don't dump it out it's in the bible but what you wear is not quite as much the emphasis is your relationship with god and i'm here to tell you that we have to come into oneness by the glory of god not by doctrine i've got to get to something here and i'm doing good at 12 30. i've got to get to something real important at the end here so then in our text he says they will have the same glory it will bring the same oneness we i pray that they will be one with us like we are one and i pray that they will be one with one another like we have oneness that's jesus prayer how many would agree with the word to say i don't know how we're gonna get there but there's gonna be oneness in the true church of god thank you for about five hands raised praise the lord amen if we can get more of you believing that that he's going to answer his prayer and god's going to break down your walls and then you're going to stop putting people into categories and stop holding grudges towards people and forgive people and realize that that person who has the holy ghost you may not like their personality but if they've got the spirit of god in him they are your true spirit brother even more than your physical family i know some people didn't like that but this this relationship is closer than your physical family oh boy i love my family i love my granddaughter back there i love my children i love my wife we are close by blood can you say man but the bible says there is a friend first of all it says he that has friends must show himself friendly and that actually it means that he that has a lot of friends he has to show himself friendly that's actually what that means and he's real popular because he's got a lot of friends then it says but there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother we've always preached that as jesus christ but what he's really saying is that there is a level of closeness and relationship in the kingdom of god by the holy ghost that goes beyond a physical blood relationship with family [Music] amen i was looking for a place to get out here go out the back door bible says there's a friend you can have a friend that would actually be closer than blood relation how does that happen through the blood and the spirit of god i got family members today i love them there's no lack of love in them whatsoever but we have there's no fellowship about there's hardly any fellowship we try to find common ground and i find it and i talk about it but because of the holy spirit in my life you can only go so far but i can sit down with a brother jason or brother kyle or i can sit down with some of you and sisters even i can sit down boy we can have some connection john 20 excuse me uh look at this one john 21 18 and 19. rarely very i say unto you i'm doing good it's only 12 37. barely i say to you when thou s young he's talking to peter at the end here and that's one though girders thyself and walk us wither thou wouldest but when thou shalt be old thou shalt stress forth thy hands and anoth another shall worthy and carry thee without wither thou wouldest not so he's saying peter you're young you still got that attitude in you i'm going to do what i want to do and that's a lot of times in young people i'm going to do my own thing and jesus is saying i know you that way now it's fine you're still my son but i'm going to beat all that out of you and someday they'll actually come and take you and take you where you don't want to go verse 19. this spake he's signifying by what death he should glorify god so he's foretelling how peter's going to die you're going to give your life for the gospel but look how he words it this speak he's thinking by what death he should glorify god really peter's death is going to glorify god we don't think about the glory of god that way but his death is going to glorify god now there's a lot of people who die but i want to die and my death glorifies god we never think of the glory of god in that here's another one uh in first no here's another one in john 9 1-3 i know it's a lot to chew on today john 9 went through the but i got to get to this one i mean two scriptures and then i got to get this one spot about the garden and then i'm going to end john i know i know that i can finish this next sunday i now have about you know 30 more sundays this year and you're probably saying he's got 30 more sundays split it up dude but it's so much funnier to get to it right now it's just better look at this john 9 1 3 and jesus passed by he saw a man that was blind from his birth and his disciples asked him saying master who did sin this man or his parents that he was born blind jesus answered neither have this man's sin nor his parents but that the works of god should be manifest in him did you hear this man was blind from his birth and they're trying to come up with reasons and blame why has this man this is unfair god's unfair there's somebody to blame jesus is it his parents is it him did he sin we always think of we're trying to look for somebody to blame and jesus is saying there's some things that happen even a kid that's blind from birth and then he gets to be 30 40 years old jesus passes his way and he's went 30 40 years completely by buying from his birth how is that fair i'll tell you how it's fair because god's waiting to bring glory to himself when he's 40 years old and that's not the way we function but that's the way god functions i might wait their whole life to heal them of that cancer i may wait years because i know the time that i'm going to get glory to my name out of that miracle we've got to look at the glory of god right that the glory of god was waiting for him to be mentioned look at that i want you to notice him they're trying to find some problem with the parents that this is caused by and i'm going to make a point to you when i talk about relationship the next few weeks if god gives me liberty we can't go our whole life we can't go our whole life holding our parents responsible not when we know about the glory of god jesus neither hath this man's sin nor his parents but that the works of god should be manifest let god do it his way you can't blame your parents the rest of your life no matter how dastardly they were you can never go on in the glory of god if you keep looking for the blame somebody say amen i'm teaching about relationships and i'm going to end this right now in the garden of eden how many believe it's a perfect oneness before the fall they were of the same image and they were the same nature of god they were made in the image of god and guess what one with him one with god because they had the same nature that's the way we see it in the bible there's only a way that could be perfectly one with god is they had to have the same nature in them of god adam and eve had it the only way to have perfect oneness is be of the same nature they were the same as nature of god one with him because of the same nature and their name the bible says was adam this is before eve was separated their name was adam he created in the image adam and eve and he he created he them so adam and eve were both in this atom they were one that's why he could say they were one that's why they were one with god but also they were so one that they were that that masculine feminine was one it was later that god separated i'm going to talk about that but notice now and i hope can you give me can you give me 10 more minutes here all right and i'll do my best we'll wrap it up but this is so crucial about relationships adam and eve were the same nature of god and they were one their name was adam they were not two separate vessels until genesis 2 where god uh takes a rib out of adam and he separates them okay and he makes them two different vessels but in spirit they have to say they're still one because they come off of god that way that they were once so even though now god separates now we know satan in genesis 3 he separates man from god he separates eve from adam satan's separation is detrimental he causes her to leave the word and when she left the word she lost everything they lost the glory of god they lost their relationship with god they lost relationship with one another they lost everything it's because satan separated them from the word and when you separate from the word you separate relationships can i get an amen when you separate from the word you separate from relationship with god and you separate in relationship with one another your relationships can never be right until your relationship with god is right and your relationship with god can never be right when you leave the word amen but before they were separated by satan god actually believe it or not now god he in his great plan he takes this adam and eve who were together and one spirit okay if you want to call it that one spirit and he puts them in vessels he breathes life into a vessel so now we can actually see something that's similar to the animal kingdom and the prophet said the reason why he made them kind of look like animal a little bit because they were going to rule over the animals before that they didn't have a bodily form so he makes a bodily form that kind of is similar to the animal kingdom although they're not they're made in the image of god still they're one with god but he make them because they're going to rule the animal king they're going to rule over the earth so now these vessels kind of look like a little bit that way and yet they're not because the difference in adam and eve is they had a soul dogs don't have a soul sherry i'm sorry god bless your dog business may god prosper it in every way don't pay tithes on it you're not allowed by scripture god bless your dog business but dogs don't have a soul they're getting rights like i've never seen before though ah they're everywhere i want to sit in a restaurant and they're sitting on my chair in the restaurant this preacher has a problem with dogs how far is this gonna go are we gonna have like our kids to protect are we gonna have dog seats in our car like we have child seats okay i just wondering so god takes and he separates all right and so they had a season there i don't know how long it was they had a season where they lived in two vessels where god took the feminine part out of man how many believe god created both the mask and feminine part and then god god separated them hello news flash to the world god created them not you and he made them masculine and feminine distinct from one another and he actually separated them into two different vessels never to be blended back again at least physically never to decide against an arrogance towards god say i don't care what god created me i don't care i'm what i choose to be what an insult to god but he took him and he separated he put the masculine in one vessel the feminine another vessel and for a season before the fall they had to go with now observing one another with the feminine side in her and the masculine side in him and yet yet they had to hold they held i'm one with her nothing's broke the oneness even though they had to start observing the difference in what that looks like with the feminine side being separate from the man and so now god put them in two vessels it's the first time we get to see two aspects feminine and masculine and they were different how many were raised around their different aspects but yet they're one still of the same spirit but different aspects that were one and the that's because the glory of god was still on them this is before the fall the glory of god's on them we're one and so this these sweethearts begin to function now not as before begin to function with two different vessels there loving one another in one with god fellowshipping with god no hindrance no walls up between one another but you gotta think you know you wonder if eve was sitting there one day and this is after god separating them and he's leaves looking over at all the gardens and she says maybe adam aren't those aren't those flowers just so beautiful and she starts to cry i'm just overwhelmed by how beautiful adam adam look adam adam look it just moves in tears how beautiful she just breaks down and she just she's a mess and maybe that's the first time adam's he's not crying yes yeah they're beautiful dear and he's kind of wondering but why is she crying about it what do you think are they honey sweetheart they are beautiful but look at that deer over there look at that buck have you counted how many and then she kind of you're looking at the deer [Music] these flowers here deer don't look at the deer deer there's no fighting there's no and and something's functioning between them as they begin to notice that those have been separated there's still this revelation and glory that says no matter how different we're still one he comes in one day and says i'm gonna go on with this for about two minutes he comes in says sweetheart she said sweetheart what'd you do today well i see i was out naming some more of the animals i found some more animals they hadn't been named yet and i was going out there and man you talk about some beautiful seen a whole herd of herd of something and i just named him elk i just said that's a herd of elk that's the way that should sound i'm naming all those animals and he said that's what i did he said sweetheart what'd you do today she said well i was out just gathering some herbs and brought them home and i was mixing them together and you know i kind of uh made something out of the herbs i made some new toothpaste that i want you to try because your breath is kind of and so i mix these herbs together it's it's a it's a new mlm that i just signed up for and i he says what's this in the room he said well that's that's some essential oils that's going in the machine we're going to breathe these in and it's not for healing because we're completely whole we never we don't know what sickness is but this is just going to make it's actually going to give us more energy and you know the man he's you know we're laughing friends and i'm i know i'm i'm out on a limb just a bit but they did have a season where there were two vessels with the masculine and feminine separated and six thousand years of history i got a list here i don't have time to read it now of about 200 differences in male and female don't sit there quiet on me one day adam says sweetie you know i love you so much i love you sweetie you're the only girl for me he says yeah that's right i am the only girl for you five months later she brings it up she said adam can i ask you a question why did you five months ago why did you say that you're that i'm the only one for you why did you say that and adam's going she remembers that because a woman's brain can remember stuff better than the masculine brain they're discovering all these things differences big time differences but but something else there is there's a love there's a glory now just go ahead and say it there's a love and there's a glory and there's a oneness that we are one that actually makes them look at one another and celebrate how god has made them amen never use it for a division never use it for divorce never use it no sel they'd have to be by the oneness and love of god celebrating the uniqueness of how god has made because i know god's made her and i know she's a part of me she's just a different aspect of me i'm talking about relationships and i wonder if we find in there a key about how we look at one another if adam and eve would have looked at the flesh they would have lost their oneness i'm not looking at your flesh today i'm not going to judge you by your flesh i want to judge you by the love of god you have a different personality than me you probably think some of my jokes today were corny and you don't have to tell me that because my wife tells me all the time my children so dad please don't tell that joke again i know my jokes are corny i know that but guess what if we've been birthed by the holy ghost true holy ghost there's a oneness there's something that makes us look beyond the flesh and to say we are one by his spirit we are one can you say amen adam and eve had to see we're never dividing we're never making fun of these things we're only celebrating this special person god has made i am still one with him in spirit she's a part of me the glory of god brought oneness to never let the flesh divide them we're not looking at the flesh we're looking at the spirit of god that makes us one. praise be to god amen let's stand together and i just asked does anybody want us to continue in this uh subject of relationships would you want me to continue amen i'm going to be helped by it i know i've been helped already and i believe it's going to help some families and help some relationships in the church just be humble before the lord be honest before the lord don't be stubborn not to talk about certain things talk about it talk about it to the lord first talk about it if you're too uncomfortable talk to somebody else talk about the lord but be honest with god then get someone close to you and say we've got to start we've got to start talking about this i remember that service brother diggs was here that last service on confession the holy spirit just swept through that place and there was such there was a few families very affected because it was such a call from the lord about being open honest confession to one another just that in itself begins to make the devil run breaks down walls we got a great message friends how many believe that and christ has broken down the middle walls of partition we have access to god and the the seals have been taken off of the book of life we are living in such wonderful times why can't it affect our love and affect our oneness and affect our relationship with others you say well that person is not responding to me i'm trying but you see now friends jesus love kept trying and kept holding steady you do your part to reach out in the greatest way you can and leave the rest up to god amen can we pray together lay your hands on one of their sisters on sisters brothers and brothers maybe husbands on wives amen and let's pray together as they just play something quietly heavenly father we pray the same prayer and echo the same prayer that you prayed here two thousand years ago that they may be one as you and the father were one lord to understand it god it's just an amazing thing lord may it drop deep in the hearts of every person here this morning may you wash away our grudges and watch away wash away our unforgiveness may you wash away understandings that may not be perfectly based on the truth may you wash away our putting people in a category may you wash away our grittiness and our harshness lord may you wash away our trying to preach and teach against others but lord may we do as brother the prophet said to draw our circle bigger when somebody draws their little circle may we draw our circle that much bigger lord and include others into our lives and to impart eternal life to others because of your power in us lord when we see adam me going through that one spot there in that season before the fall lord how amazing it must have been to see the differences in one another and yet lord nothing ever brought them to the place of dividing it wouldn't the love of god wouldn't allow them to ever divide over that because they knew that they were one in god lord may we recognize other holy ghost people that we are one with them and it's not based upon flesh or personality but it's based upon the true holy ghost saying amen and believing the word of god for this age that's the criteria thank you father bless these hearts continue to help us to know you through this series on relationships lord and we give you the glory for it may your glory come more to us and change us we pray in jesus name amen i need him more than ever [Music]
