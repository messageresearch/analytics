========================================

I'm a hot bird I'm a Southern bird and I love hot weather but I love coming here this time of year you know it's not too cold you know but it's it's cold enough you know we we always don't get to see the the seasons right on time like you guys do because you can come down south in December and it'll still be 60 degrees you know don't don't hate on us you know don't hate on us you know we like it like that but it's uh such a pleasure to be here among this nice weather nice people we thank God for all of you amen but most of all we have one thing in common and that's the Lord Jesus Christ you know and that's what gathers us together that's what brings us together so we uh certainly appreciate the song The Worship all you guys we want to get right into the word today uh how many you got to need today amen God is a God who answers prayer amen let's just bow and we'll go before the throne of grace if you have unspoken requests let's acknowledge about a uplifted hand Lord Jesus father as the song said Lord all of our hope is in you Lord father when we look at our lives Lord as it looks like it's in turmoil and going down the room way Lord we all of us can truly say God turned it around not only the situation but you turned us around you turned our hearts around Lord and that's the promise we're standing on Lord we're we're recipients of a word that brought forth and came forth Lord our changing of the hearts a turning of the hearts Lord back to the original way Lord and father we're here today Lord as the manifestation of Truth Lord not to say that we're no better than anybody else but we believe that we're the Fulfillment of end time prophecy Lord and Lord we just pray you have your way with us Lord and you will just remove anything in us that's not like you Lord and if you find anything Lord just replace it with something refreshing of thy Spirit Lord because our deepest desire is to be what you want us to be Lord Lord without complaint Lord God without any kind of murmuring Lord but give us a joyful heart when it comes to doing your will Lord father and we pray as the word is going forth Lord a little fall on good ground Lord that we'll all right not only be hearers of the word but we'll be Duels of the word father forgive us for our trespasses and sins Lord and keep that atoning blood atoning all of our Lives Lord father we pray that you will just keep your hand upon this church Lord the pastor and the different Ministries within it Lord and all those who are connected Lord Lord that we'll just continue to be molded to this this one body one mind one Spirit Lord that the Bible speaks of Lord Lord we just ask father that in this moment the Holy Ghost will have total preeminence in The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ we pray the Church Say Amen amen praise the Lord if you have your Bibles let's turn to um let's go to Job chapter one first Job chapter one then we're gonna go to Saint John chapter 15. Job chapter 1 verse let's start at verse um six you have to say man the Bible says now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them and the Lord said unto Satan once come as thou then Satan answered the Lord and said from going to and fro in the Earth and from walking up and down in it sounds like he's very desperate then Satan answered the Lord and said Duff job fear God for naught let me back up verse verse 8. and the Lord said unto Satan has thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and upright man one that feareth God and obscures Evil then Satan answered the Lord and said Duff job fear God for not has thou has not Thou made and hedge about him in about his house and about all that he had on every side thou has blessed the work of his hands and his substance is increased in the land now this is Satan testifying back to God what he sees over job's life so no matter what you might think of yourself the devil knows who you are and he knows whether the hand of God is upon your life the question is do you know it verse 11 he says put forth thine hand now and touch all that he hath and he will curse thee to thy face and the Lord said unto Satan behold all that he hath is in thy power only upon himself put not forth thy hand so Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord Saint John chapter 15. and we're going to start at verse 1. Saint John 15 and 1 the Bible says I am the True Vine and my father is the husband man every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit now ye are clean through my word which I have spoken unto you amen may the Lord bless you the reading of his word you can have your seats and if I can I want to I want to quote another scripture in Hebrews chapter 5. Hebrews chapter 5 you know in verse 8. the Bible says though he were yet a son yet he learned obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation unto all that obeyed him now we look in the scripture this this right here is talking about the Lord Jesus and it says yet he learned obedience by the things he suffered and today by the grace of God I want to I want to I want to um change the way we look at suffering you know because I think uh we always look at suffering as pain and suffering as something that we don't want to go through but suffering is a part of our growth amen and if I could use that for a subject amen growth by suffering you know all spiritual growth by suffering and you know church when we when we when we seek of growth and we we think of birth pains and all the things that the prophet has laid forward you know that there are tests and there are trials that we must go through you know in our good days our bad days there is something that God is doing for us as believers and you know when I when I look at the Book of Job And I think about what job went through first things first every trial Hallelujah doesn't mean that you've done something wrong Hallelujah sometimes you're going through something simply because it's a growth process amen you take you take a little baby and you know as that baby begins to grow and you know that that child its bones begin to get stronger and different things that baby will develop something inside of him that makes him wants to do more whether whether you like it or not that baby will start to use his strength to pull up on chairs use the strength to pull up on tables and you have to start cleaning out areas so that child will get a hold of it but that child Hallelujah is built to grow whether you like it or not there's something in it that's going to make it grow Hallelujah and even in a growing process that child will get hurt that child will get bumps and bruises and you know what you can't baby it all the time sometimes you have to let it fall because it's the falling that helps us grow Hallelujah and you know sometimes God he has to allow us to fall into things it's not Hallelujah for our detriment but it's for our benefit because the Bible comes back and it says count it all joy when you fall into Davis Temptations Hallelujah so Church falling Hallelujah now I'm not talking about falling into sin but I'm saying in your journey Hallelujah there will be bumps and bruises but these are things God has put in our pathway now all of us everybody in this room have to learn how to walk and none of us just stood up one day and said hey I'm gonna walk no it was a process hallelujah amen when you realize Hallelujah that you had enough strength and there was somebody whether it was a mom or a daddy there was somebody in your life encouraging you to walk Hallelujah and normally that person stood before you Hallelujah you're not even knowing that you got the strength to walk as far as you could walk but that person in your life said come on baby Hallelujah normally well I ain't gonna say that I was outfit I was gonna boost up the dance for a second you know how a dad is a dad Hallelujah mom is always with that child and you know sometimes the child will sneak and walk without Mama even recognizing it because she's so busy she's doing everything and you know she's in a role she's cooking she's cleaning and before you know it she looks around and that child standing up smiling at her and she's wondering when did you learn to stand up on your own Hallelujah in church just like us hallelujah there will come times they'll come certain situations Hallelujah whether you realize it or not but you're standing up on your own God had already put that in you amen and you know you take the dad he comes home from work and one day that child is standing here and Dad just can't believe it he's so overwhelmed he's like come and son come in my baby girl and he begins to encourage that child and that child takes a step what is it doing it's taking a step towards that encouragement though it may fall Hallelujah that town may fall but it's the encouragement that gets that child back up and take another step only to fall again Hallelujah but God in his great grace and his great Mercy Hallelujah he's already knowing we're going to fall but he says a word we got the week day after day to encourage us to keep walking and every step is bringing us closer to the one who's encouraging us Hallelujah ain't no church as I think about growth and the process of growth and how it hurts you know and as that child Hallelujah whether you believe it or not some children they get used to falling so it begins a place in a life where it doesn't even bother them when they fall it's just a part of the journey holy so they're not afraid to take a step and believe because there's something inside of them that says get back up again that's what the scripture says the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by God hallelujah what makes them righteous they get back up holy the Bible says a wicked man he'll dwell it right there where he's at and continue in that Mischief but those are the Righteous gets back up gets back up another day to walk towards God they don't stay in their sins Hallelujah and this is a time this is an hour of the overcomer Hallelujah Church we're going to fight battles and we're going to go through things that listen to me good we're going to go through things we have no explanation for you have no reason you don't even know why you're going through it but that's God's way Hallelujah God he puts us on a Proving Ground to show the devil that they're going to keep serving me no matter what Hallelujah because whether you realize a lot some things some trials some sufferings are no more than just a bet between God and the devil amen somebody it's just a bet and I don't know about y'all there's a lot of bets in my life hallelujah amen there's a big old table hallelujah amen and my table's not a crap table honey there's purpose in this thing Hallelujah there's something God is doing Hallelujah and in the casino of brother diggs's life Hallelujah the spiritual Casino amen sister Rebecca every table is ringed Hallelujah every game every table every everything is ringed Hallelujah that I will come out on The Winning Side Hallelujah so Satan is blessing his best but God has already rigged every table God has already rigged every card God has already rigged every dice Hallelujah that I that us that we will win my dice when the dice begin to roll in my life I know some of y'all think this brother here preaching about dice notice I said spiritual Casino hallelujah amen will not promote let's say this real good brother Paul we're not promoting the lottery we're not promoting gambling Hallelujah but life is a Gamble Hallelujah and I don't know about you guys but I got all my chips I got all my dice all my cards on the Lord Jesus Christ and my table is so rigged Hallelujah when Satan is rolling a dice Hallelujah thinking that I'm going to fall or I'm going to give up my dice they always fall on seven oh never on six because they're weighted Hallelujah they're reading Hallelujah somebody might look like six it might look like a day of judgment but they always follow completion [Music] because God is always doing something amen so let's stop looking at the things we're going through as something wrong when all God is doing is perfecting us amen see when I I read the scripture right here in Saint John he says every branch in me that bearth not fruit he taketh away how many people are in church and they are considered to be Christians but they're just here some of you may just be here today but if we're pulling something I want you to pull with me I don't want you to be in here just relying off my strength because what if something happens to me then who are you what if something happens to that person you're relying so much on then what do you have you may rely on Gideon for to lead you into worship what if Gideon can't sing one morning Are You Gonna Worship you might not rely on brother Kenny and Boaz and the different ones that are creating the music Hallelujah do you have music within you if there's no music who are you without anybody else Hallelujah are you a fruit that needed to be taken away are you a fruit that's are you a bridge that's bearing fruit Hallelujah he says if you don't bear any fruit he taketh it away put it down get it out of the way it's holding us up and the last thing we need in this hour is people in the church that are holding us up but these what do you mean Hallelujah you hear it over and over again what your life should be and you don't apply the word we go back to our little our little habits we go back to the little things that we like when God is constantly trying to purge us amen listen he says in every branch that bearth fruit he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit and that's what we want to deal with today hallelujah amen spiritual growth by suffering Hallelujah now he says even when you're bringing for a fruit can I get a man Hallelujah we are the caliber of people amen who believe this truth believe this message and we're doing everything Hallelujah to try to see the manifestation and fulfillment that God calls us to be in this day Hallelujah so then we fulfill the scripture by those who are bringing forth fruit he says even when you bring it for fruit he'll Purge you uh oh he's going to take you through something even though you pay your tithesia even though you're faithful in whatever Ministry God has given you even though you come to church like you're supposed to even though you guess what even though you got the Holy Ghost he's gonna Purge you that you breathe forth what more fruit that does not have a stagnantic church but he has a church that's growing Hallelujah growing what from glory to glory and if you're not growing Hallelujah why are you here if you're not growing you're subject to be cut down that's according to the scripture but notice those who are being purged are the ones who are already doing something for God hallelujah hallelujah and I'm not necessarily talking about physical works but what does suffering do it brings forth character you like how I spoke that character God is in the business of producing spiritual character and how do you get character through suffering suffering will show who you really are what kind of suffering suffering that you have no answer for that's why the prophet was anointed to preach messages like be certain of God amen because he says what do you do when you're praying and praying and praying and God doesn't answer can you still serve him can you still come to church and lift Your Hands In Worship can you still live a clean life holy can you still be a life of sacrifice can you still walk in with a smile as if you was on the Mountaintop and you know the sad part about the church we as Believers we know and one and others are going through things because people's attitude change when they go through a trial tell who's on your side amen when you're preaching and everything is good stay in here oh Pastor preach oh we love you so much and as soon as you start to go through a trial like oh my God I'm just not being fed oh my God the people in the church oh my God it's just too cold oh my God gas prices are too high any kind of excuse Hallelujah Hallelujah to give up Hallelujah any kind of excuse Hallelujah and this is the Clincher any kind of excuse to just relax and be normal we're not here to be normal Hallelujah and I'll be the last one to say that I'm normal Hallelujah when God created me Hallelujah he not only broke the mold but he crushed it stomped on it and did everything else to it and threw it underway there'll be a never another one like this one Hallelujah because only you can fulfill God's plan Hallelujah that he has for you but when we look at pruning and we look at the purging of the Saints Hallelujah sometimes there's no explanation it's just God rolling the dice hallelujah look the devil says hey Scott look the devil came to church that morning oh my God let me give you a direct quote he said God needs somebody to use he said the devil also needs somebody to use and the only thing I don't stop or hinder the supernatural in here this morning or the supernatural in your life is if you cater yourself to the devil he needs your mind he needs your body he needs you to fulfill his plan and think about it people even realize that you have power over the enemy Hull and just as like you can yield yourself to God and things will happen why do we see more of the reality of it when we yield ourselves to the devil so you can come and say oh this time of year throats get a little scratchy and we wake up ain't nothing happening it's just a little cold my throat feels a little raspy don't worry it's coming it's coming because you're creating an Avenue for it why can't we create avenues for God to move just that simple in my life Lord I will be out of debt Hallelujah Lord I will be healed today not tomorrow but today because your word says by your stripes I'm already healed I don't have to do anything I would have to work for it all I have to do is believe somebody needs to create an Avenue for God to move this morning Hallelujah but we create avenues for Satan to move in our lives all the time and we'll start by giving him leeway brother I will say well you know the greatest battle of fault is in the mind so you accept being fought in your mind by evil spirits remember he said the greatest battle ever fought is in the mind but there's a key word in there battle hallelujah it's a battle that means your mind doesn't just belong to the devil it's a battle God wants your mind just as much as the devil does so why did I give your thoughts to him Hallelujah but look Satan comes to church that morning and he says you know what the sons of God are going before the Lord and I'm going to will leave me out but God always sees the devil in your life Satan never surprises God there's nothing you can go through Gabby there's nothing you can go through whether where God will say oh Satan you got me on that one no he'll never catch God by surprise you say everybody I fell into sin and then God goes oh oh my God what am I going to do no for you to fall God had to allow it Hallelujah for you to go through anything God has to First signed off on it and agreement hallelujah it's just a test it's just a trial God's ruling the dice but sometimes it looks so wicked even I just got to be the devil what huh oh we're gonna look at it listen Satan comes to church and I hope we're Satan free this morning I hope the only Spirit you're carrying this morning is the spirit of God if there's any other kind of aggravation in your life there's Deliverance this morning Hallelujah one of the greatest things we need in a church is Spirit of obedience because we'll hear the word and we'll not be obedient let's just be obedient let's be the type of who we are Mary Mary says be it unto me according to Thy Word she said yes she had her own way of thinking she was like how are these things how's it going to happen and the angel of tore and say Mary don't worry about it the Holy Ghost will overshadow you why don't you let the Holy Ghost overshadow you this morning and God will take care of it don't try to do it on your own human ability because then you're subject to failure Hallelujah just wait on God but look Satan come to church and God says what's coming down Satan he's like hey I'm just walking to and from I'm going here I'm going there and then this is the Clinton he said to throughout the Earth he ain't just bothering literal life he's bothering Jesus Christ Tabernacle Holly all the other churches in this area he's the same devil he needs somebody he needs a School Hallelujah he needs somebody to work through Hallelujah and listen Church Hallelujah this is one thing you got that you got to realize Harley in order for you to do if your own you must first reject truth because God built us that way God built us with a connection of truth hallelujah and for order for us to do wrong we must First cast down the truth Hallelujah because Adam who we all come from was created how in the image of God so he always had to deal with truth before he did anything wrong and now Satan he says I'm going to and fro and all these things Hallelujah put me put me Job chapter one up put me on the street Harley Joe chapter one give me verse verse uh verse 7. and the Lord said that the same wisdom cometh thou then Satan answered the Lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it you know there's a scripture that says when your house is clean swept garnished when it's fit to be filled if you don't feel it the devil will come back Hallelujah that's his opportunity but if the house is filled that means there's no vacancies so we want our house our spiritual house our mind our spirit our soul to be filled with the things of God what do we want we want character honey next verse listen he said and the Lord said unto Satan has thou considered now God wants to give the devil something to think about oh hallelujah oh hey has not considered my servant job God is pointing the devil in the direction he wants him to go in your life maybe he says sometimes have you considered job have you considered in or or sister Joe have you considered Solomon and on and on and on you put your name in it notice the devil didn't just jump on job no God pointed him and what I want you to catch job wasn't ready for this he had no time to prepare he had no time to fast and pray the battle was just coming Hallelujah God was rolling the dice but remember the table is rigged Hallelujah but amen and just this just stirs me up Hallelujah but before he allows the battle to go God is going to testify over the life of his servant first have you considered my servant job and listen to God's testimony there is none like him in all the Earth think about that before you go through anything God has already testifying over your life God is already telling the devil that there's nothing like this person in all the Earth no matter what you take them through there's not like him there's none like her nah I know we all kind of different but if I could hear God saying about me and there's none like me in all the Earth you think I could just be in church like this God has said let's make it real clear the voice of Eternity God has put us out in the heavens the moon heard this the sun heard this all of creation heard this holy everything in my future heard this everything in my path heard this everything in my present heard the voice of God heard God ring out that there's none like him in all the Earth but then he didn't stop he didn't stop at the very end he put adjectives on my life he said that he's perfect I got to take a little praise break right quick y'all forgive me Messiah is the king of kings Messiah is the Lord of Lord Messiah is the king of King Messiah is Messiah is the king of King everybody now Messiah is Lord of lords first think about it honey it excites me to know that no matter how I look at myself God already sees me perfect and that's before I even go through the trial That Word Perfect in the Greek it means complete I'm lacking nothing I'm completing him you're complete Hallelujah it also means amen one who lacks nothing in physical strength Beauty Etc it also means sound Hallelujah that the devil can't get my mouth because I'm sound honey it also means wholesome amen oh God is testifying telling the devil the one of them to let you try Hallelujah he's sound he's complete he's wholesome [Music] Hallelujah oh Gloria God listen he says quite sort of a person complete morally innocent um so before I go through something no matter what it looks like to you in God's eyes I'm already morally innocent God doesn't even see my fault because he started with the testimonies that I'm complete Hallelujah this test this trial is just proving who I am proving who you are Hallelujah oh my listen it also means one who is morally and ethically pure so you may think that there's things I have to get rid of but God is saying no Hallelujah they're morally and ethically pure this trial is just going to purge everything else out of them earlier so that testimony can be a reality oh Hey look job didn't do anything wrong But Here Comes these end-time message believers jump you you must have had you've got to have done something to be going through this you must have did something no proof why do we let our minds wander off into places Hallelujah when we have no explanation for it I told y'all one of the greatest Ministries I've ever seen I've ever been a part of Hallelujah and I believe brother Branham had he had this locked in but it came from Jesus in the best Ministry I know of Hallelujah if you want to call this the eighth Angel the eighth Messengers or whatever you want to call it amen this is this is the greatest Ministry upon the Earth right now Hallelujah and all of you can be a part of it amen you don't even have to look it up on the internet I'm gonna give it to you for free today you'd rather look wait for some great preacher to come or somebody of renown that went up the mountain with brother Branham and all these different things no I'm gonna give it to you free the greatest Ministry that I've ever been a part of is called The Chateau Mount Ministry Sometimes the best thing to do is just to keep this thing close just let it take its course don't add nothing to it don't try to figure it out just sit back and pray just sit back and say you know the problem is a lot of times we speak on other people because we really don't believe that they believe us I told you and the worst kind of person to be oh the worst kind of person to be besides a gossiper is the person that the gossiper always calls because you have become a spiritual trash can but the gospel Hollywood can always count on you to vent can always count on you to upload their trash and you sit right there and listen to it all and just take it all in and just be like oh my God oh my Lord we really need to pray know what you ought to do as soon as they cause I ain't got time for that today I ain't got time today or just the best way to shut it down is be like maybe it's something God is doing in their life and who's going to argue with that I don't believe God I don't believe God made one Prophet walked around naked and that was a sign to the people he made another Prophet lay on his side as a sign for the people earlier God allowed one one woman to go into prostitution just so she could get to the place where she could meet the right man marry this man and the seed in the lineage of Jesus Christ and come through it who's gonna tell God what's ethically right Holly who's gonna tell God what looks right and what looks wrong all these virtuous women over here God say no I'm gonna use that prostitute Hallelujah but she had to go through something to get there but you know what she was she was complete she was sound she was wholesome she was even though she was a prostitute in God's eyes she was morally and ethically pure oh wow oh I know some of you may be analyzing what I'm saying like but that doesn't make any sense God doesn't make sense [Music] he's not in the business of making sense he's in the business of making sons and daughters Hallelujah and it may look like I shouldn't be a son hungry it don't look like it's sensible but it is you may not look like it's sensible to be a daughter of God but you are Hallelujah not only did he say everybody all right he says that you're give me pull the verse back up there he says he says he's perfect Hallelujah in an upright man meaning that this trial ain't gonna make him fall upright the word upright it means correct [Music] it means proper uprighteous righteous Hallelujah that which is upright and he's saying to Satan no matter what he'll do or go through in this trial I'm looking at him to be righteous but it's this trial that's going to bring out the best of job Hallelujah but God does he says if you're not bringing for a fruit he'll Purge you that you bring forth more fruit now if we could just see the type of purging purging is like pruning a tree if you know what pruning is hallelujah look that tree has already been growing for years so it has a testimony amen he has a testimony to be able to produce but now God wants more out of it honey and you know how long if you ask the question how long does an apple tree produce apples it's your year of the year it really shouldn't never stop and the only reason why I stopped because something internally is going on look that apple tree will produce as long as Hallelujah the branches have light and water it'll produce as long as the is experiencing the right temperature the proper Seasons that apple tree is supposed to produce apples but let's say it's 50 years later and there's no more apples that means that there's something wrong on the inside Hallelujah because it's still an apple tree let's look at it like this 50 years later Hallelujah you just got an apple off that tree earlier if you plant those seeds in that Apple you'll still get what in apple tree so there's nothing wrong with the host tree Hallelujah there's something on the inside going on so why does God Purge us he purged us to bring forth more fruit now listen what he says right here about job he says the Lord wasn't Hallelujah rebuking job he said God was purging job he said I'm gonna read it for you he says now if you ever notice how that when a disaster struck job's home listen it looked like a disaster and a lot of times when we go through things it looks like a disaster it looks like a tragedy Hood but how do you know God God uses tragedy to bring forth Glory he used something called the death of the Cross Hallelujah forever he used some it looked like a tragedy how God got whipped he got talked about he basically got murdered but he used that tragedy to set us free listen he said Jose hold his children were all killed and everything and all job had was destroyed God was a rebuking job he was only purging job amen I like that word Purge So In This Moment God used this trial for job's benefit and The Purge is a type to prune Hallelujah and you look at a church we think about the word pruning what's the purpose of pruning you take a normal tree Hallelujah that's been producing fruit year after year and then all of a sudden it's not producing anymore and I'm sure brother Paul has experienced Us in different pastors where you have people in the church and then all of a sudden they start to feel something wrong they're not eating from his hand anymore as a Shepherd that's when you know your sheep is sick because they've been eating out of your hand all this time and now all of a sudden they're not hungry same food we don't have any different amen I I have a I have a pet holy am I my my bully which is a mix of American Bulldog and a pit bull that's a bully I like the name but if I changed her food just off the smell of it she won't eat it and the only way she'll eat it is if I don't put anything before then it makes her adapt her taste to eat was presented before her Hallelujah and sometimes it feels like the ministry is giving you different food now Hallelujah he's just giving you something Hallelujah that you haven't tasted yet and sometimes that may come as a little family rebuke Hallelujah he may come that Holy a moral rebuke what he's trying to get you to do earlier to eat from this place and from that plate but all of it will make you better indeed she'll get to the place Hallelujah she'll drink the water because you can't change water but when it comes to the food that's the Holly and one thing I've come to realize as a Believer or somebody who sits under sits under a Ministry holy you have to ask yourself the question when the word comes forth and maybe it's rebuking or it comes through a passage rebuking ask yourself is this man really trying to hurt me information let's take the example from job say hey the Lord God giveth and the Lord God take it away blessed be the name of the Lord see in the midst of his pruning the midst of his he still give God glory even though he had no explanation pruning pruning can remove any portion that have a disease that's why the tree is pruned that's why Hallelujah we can't have every service that produces a Mountaintop sometimes the word has to get right down in there to where your defeat is get right down in there grind on that thing Dig It All Out Hallelujah and don't take it from you easy snatch it from you so you can feel that Deliverance Hallelujah sometimes the ministry has to come right down into the areas that you have Secret in your protecting things that you don't want to get rid of but that tree has to be proved notice the pruning doesn't happen Hallelujah to an illegitimate tree it happens to a tree that's already been producing I want you to look at this right Church Hallelujah rebukes come from those who have already been producing that's God's way and we think oh my God why am I going to listen why is this happening God's just trying to get you to grow he's just trying to get more fruit out of you because he knows that there's more in there so what that pruning does that pruning begins to get to that sickness Hallelujah get to that thing that's stopping the tree hurling and you could be Hallelujah feeling like you're in the will of God then all of a sudden a trial because there's something in you that God knows only this child can bring out listen he did it all through the course of the Bible amen are you with me church and he even did it in our prophets Ministry this man this oh oh this man seeing visions Hallelujah daily holy praying for people healing lies amen his life was just it was just so remarkable he's doing all these things Hallelujah but you know he had to go through a trial why because he had a lying spirit inside of him not my prophet he said it not me it's on tape he's on streaming listen all of a sudden the IRS comes up with this big old tax bill this man is going around the world doing the work of God he wasn't committing sin Harley he's doing look he's doing the right thing with the money he even had a record to show that he put all the money back into the ministry none of it for his own self and now he's under all his pressure from the IRS you know why I love this story because God tells me I can also deliver your IRS problems Hallelujah come on somebody I know some of us getting those those letters in the mail oh are y'all too spiritual hahaha but listen Church in this moment of his life where he's going around the world he's praying for people he's doing everything he wasn't committing sin all of a sudden he goes to a trial with the IRS and this thing is so intense what made it intense he had no explanation but now God is trying to get the prophet to grow but the hidden thing about God God knew that this trial was going to bring out something that was lying way down in there even with the Holy Ghost he was going to bring out something that you wouldn't think a prophet was able to do a man filled with the Holy Spirit a man being used by God a man traveling around the world a man looked upon the bee righteous Hallelujah and now because of trial with no explanation what is God doing he's shaking the tree he's pruning the tree Hallelujah if some of your trees are being this morning why is he shaking the tree because he can see the fruit Hallelujah and now he's shaking the tree honey in the prophet holy you know he had all these different lines that people could call the tax collector could call on every line there was no Escape every time you turn around [Music] in this one particular day he felt like he was under so much pressure immedi picks up the phone and she says bill is that IRS tax man again y'all know what else it don't even get that far because we got a call ID and I even I even heard something from my kids that you can block people foreign be careful don't get blocked I'm gonna give you I'm gonna give you a key if your child goes out and you didn't bless them with a phone you gave them a phone they go out and you trying to call him and it goes straight to voicemail that's something funny because normally it doesn't go straight to voicemail if it goes straight to voicemail either you're on do not disturb or you're blocked and some of them are so smart they put you on airplane mode that way your call can't come through and you get straight voicemail and I hope there's no Annabelle in here hi this is Annabelle and I can't get your call at this moment but if you leave a message I'll call you back that drives me crazy if I'm paying the bill and you can't answer my phone calls something wrong we're gonna have to check that that Network when you get back but anyway let me leave that off y'all know I'm good at telling young people secrets I'm such a tattletale but Church now that Prophet gets the phone call Hallelujah and immedi says it's that tax collector and he hears it he knows it he says tell him I'm not in here what was that that was a lie and God knew that that was that lying Spirit was still inside of him even though he was in the will of God even though he was a prophet even though he had the Holy Ghost even though he had healing lies and people getting healed there still was an element Hallelujah that God couldn't use inside of them and that tree had to be pruned Hallelujah and what brought it out it was the child Hallelujah but what I want you to catch about this one Hallelujah the prophet goes out and he goes into doing what he'd normally do but now God is looking at it different he goes to pray for somebody and God said get your hands off them you just told a lie he goes back even before he got there he says my wife is more moral than I am and not in those exact words but he was saying his wife said to him not bill was that just quite right uh she recognized it was a lot so you knew he had to recognize it was a lie but then he steps out Hallelujah goes Outdoors or whatever and feel like and you're after the phone was hung up back then the phones are very big so when you hang them up they go ding so he probably could hear that hung up the phone came back in and she was like Bill you know that wasn't right he was he said I told you I was outside he said yeah but you was in here when the call came often we do that we try to play religious games with God well I I I I didn't lie I just didn't speak the truth I ain't the smartest person in the world but if you didn't speak the truth that sounded like a lot of me now God deals with the prophet Hallelujah and from that point Hallelujah he has to go back see just how you know your footsteps are ordered by God that there's something inside that there's Seed Life inside because he didn't just wallow in that line and say oh well God forgive me no he said okay I'm gonna go back and make it right God he went back to the man and say sir when you called I told a liar was in the house and the man says to him he says I've always had respect for you he said but now I have even more respect what did that man see that man saw character [Music] suffering brings forth character even though Hallelujah the just of the whole thing God wanted to get the lion Spirit out in church from that point Hallelujah we've never ever heard another quote another taint Hallelujah about him telling a lie same thing with Abraham not just about that's just my sister you know it was your wife but God wanted to deal with that lying spirit so he let him come under some pressure that he couldn't explain but he spoke that into his life be careful what you speak he spoke that child into his life and then the trial comes and now he's looking like oh what am I going to do God knew about it before the foundation of the world in our church Holy Bible that comes and takes his wife and all these things and then God steps in Hallelujah God steps in to show that I'm on your side even though in your failures he's pruning the tree Hallelujah there's some things that'll happen in your life only for a testimony you say why did I just so you can have some friends of mine in Edmonton Christian Tesa so he said her friends and some of the saints were at one of the other Saints house I think it's all sisters they were around the pool with the kids just having a good Fellowship eating and enjoying themselves and they got a little son I think comrade is three somewhere like that three or two you know he talking walking the average two-year-old you know a three-year-old how old he is and he uh they was around the pool you know everybody having a good time there was one person that's supposed to be watching the kids you know they was doing pretty good watching the kids and all these different things and you know mothers were very protective so he had the little balloons on his arm the balloons on his on his legs or whatever I think he just had him on his arms this time you know what the little things that make him float somehow comrade takes his off what's that a boy being a boy and he takes them off and he jumps in the pool but nobody sees him jump in the pool nobody hears them jump in the pool all the saints all the sisters are standing there talking having a good time fellowshipping and comrades in the pool drowning nobody knows it then one sister she gets up just sporadically had to do something and actually got up when she turned her head she saw something red in the pool so it caught her attention and it was the color of comrade shorts so she went to investigate and saw him land there at the bottom of the pool basically dead and she grabs him they picks him up and you can imagine the scene Church you can imagine a scene that like oh my God his mother's standing there crying and just just Delirious you know and and and somebody begins to do CPR you know resuscitation I said begins to bring him back or whatever and they got a little bit of his heart back breathing and then the the rescue people come and they get him and take him to the hospital now you know when you die for so long it affects your brain and too much of the water intake will affect your lungs and as a two or three-year-old I want you to keep this in mind his brain knows his lungs were fully developed so there's more of a chance that something would happen to him in that stage than a grown-up in church he gets they take them to the hospital the hospital revives him Hallelujah they revise them his breath comes back amen everything about comrade comes back when he's in the hospital and now he's in the hospital he's like where am I what's up with my mama with my daddy Hallelujah with my mama with my daddy so they're running all these tests going through all the stuff that's like who are you what are your name all these things he answers every question Hallelujah Oh my he answers every question with no reservation to the point where he says take me to my mama take me to my daddy Hallelujah he's basically telling the doctors there's nothing wrong with me I'm just a testimony Hallelujah okay and now he comes they showed me the video of him coming out of the emergency room and he's just running and just having such a good time like nothing never happened and they begin to ask him they ask him questions say do you remember what happened he said yeah I was under the water he said well what were you thinking he said I would think he's talking to his mom he said to her he said he says he said what were you thinking he said I was thinking why watch you saving me and you know that just broke her heart as a mother Hallelujah so in me trying to encourage you I began to tell her things like this sometimes things happen out of your control just so you can have a testimony of God's grace so you have a testimony of God's power church and what they were really concerned about how there's some of you in here right now that are being affected by things you went through in your childhood oh Horrors and and giving things you experience that you're still carrying to this day things that happen to you you can be delivered and that was the greatest fear with comrade they were thinking that now he's going to be afraid to be around water or do anything about swimming as soon as he got home he asked Chris hey Dad can we go swimming Hallelujah what was the church it was the glory of God over his life there's no fear when it comes to the swimming pool there's no fear when it comes to anything that has to deal with water what was all that for just to give his mother a testimony and sometimes you'll go through things simply because God wants you to trust him more look church this happened God's grace this happened when all the saints their backs were turned even when your back is turning you don't know how the devil is going to come God is still your protector Hallelujah so when you think about pruning the tree there's something called a three-step method concerning the pruning a tree a lot of times now we're going to talk about church for a minute we'll get right down it's just like the way someone you look at the ministry sometimes when it comes to dealing with things in the church you may say well why is he approaching it that way why is it what we all can see the problem why don't he just rebuke them I'll tell you why because it's the ministry of a pastor and he's not telling me to speak on any of this I just feel led this morning Hallelujah but you know what Harley because we're dealing with proof and we're dealing with spiritual growth earlier and one thing you have to realize about a pastor Holly his whole job is to see you make it to heaven Hallelujah I'm glad I don't have that job I don't have that burden Hallelujah amen although I want to see you make it to Heaven my job is a little bit more fun than his because my job Hallelujah is to attack the demons that's Hanging On To You Hallelujah so I get to come in your life like Rambo Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam shooting at everything that's hating on you Hallelujah and you know sometimes I might meet the Target and hit you oh and all I say is your legs shouldn't have been in the way you shouldn't be that close to the devil ain't my problem my job is to deal with the devil that close is your fault Hallelujah I've been in church Hallelujah my sword is so sharp and I'm cutting and people don't even realize I'm cutting them till they raise their hand and their hand fall off you got me brother Diggs but Church you look that Ministry Hallelujah is to get you to a place amen well you can grow and keep going and growing keep going sometimes things will happen Hallelujah that you don't quite understand and you take that gift you take that you take that Ministry hallelujah it's it's it's direct and sometimes it's indirect and the reason why it's indirect sometimes because it's dealing with more than just one person and sometimes one person can do something in church and everybody got to get it because that's just the ministry and you you you you you may look at it like why is he picking on me no he's just pruning a tree because he sees the fruit he wants the fruit in your life Hallelujah and he wants God to just continue to cultivate the tree but what you may see Hallelujah is not cultivating you may feel like why me ask yourself the question why not you don't you want to be in the image of God Hallelujah in church even me as an evangelist I had to understand I'm not a pastor cause I've been sitting in church among my sisters and brothers my local church and things are going on and I'm like man if I was the pastor oh God have mercy on them I'll tell you a testimony church when I was a song leader I used to be a brother come in and he just messed up the whole service by singing his specials and we're good people now we're good people now but back then Sherry oh he come in he I have a special and I'm like okay and get in and different ones brother Kenny y'all know what I'm speaking on just because you have a special that don't mean it's special sometimes it's just you wanting to stand among the people so you can hear this because you wanted a little praise that's not the way to go about it you know the pastor because he's that kind of man he'll let you have your special by no way he's going to come into his sister you can't sing brother you can't see we want to be edified this morning and I know y'all think he has a horrible things that's a little too hard the Bible says Make a Joyful Noise yeah what makes it joyful the way we receive it I'm not telling you the seniors not the senior special but I'm telling I'm questioning your motives Hallelujah and his brother was put in his requested mess up everything and then we got to come back and get the service back together we got the same songs and different stuff and just get her back going you know because my job is to make it right for the preacher where he would come out and feel free where he could just preach not to where he has to frown and beat on the people to get the atmosphere right right so you think about that it's your special hindering of service or is it making better you know somebody just hit me with a stone Paul they picking up bricks in here Paul oh my God but remember I'm an evangelist I'm not connected to your feelings he is Hallelujah and you know church he get em we have to get it back right so I got to a point as the song leader I'm like he ain't no more and you think brother Diggs you wrong and I was but in that moment I didn't care because I'm looking at my duty my job to get the atmosphere right honey so we battled like two Rams he'd come and say I got a special and I say I don't care he put his best give his special to the deacons I read it Fold It Up LED on the side because in my mind I'm thinking no you're not gonna mess up the service today we went on like that for months months just battling to the place to where he knew I wasn't going to receive his request so he got smart everybody believe it or not everybody in the church is watching us [Music] you think your battle is just between you and that person no it's affecting the whole church to the point the way I'm leading songs and he says okay if the deacons ain't gonna give it to him because you know I had a dick is in my pocket the deacons was on my side oh we fight real dirty we don't fight fair so I already got them one hey when he give you a question don't you bring that up here to me y'all see what I see in our church everybody all right now Church hallelujah what he decides to do he says okay if that's how you're gonna do it I'm gonna put you on blast in front of the whole church so what he does is write his requests out while the song service is going on Gideon he gets up lays it on the pulpit while I'm conducting everybody knows it's a song request and they're looking at me like what you gonna do now the same thing I always get I don't care if y'all looking at me right there on the side I'm coming somewhere and I'm going through this major trial this major battle with my brother and then one day the man of God comes one of the brothers in the church comes and he preached on a message and the title of his message was you just never believe it the title of his message was complexes and from that Ministry from that word I realized I had a complex and I was trying to take care of something that I wasn't supposed to be trying to take care of and God just comes to me and says hey look at the pastor look what he's doing if he's not rebuking it why are you rebuking it sometimes hold your peace just sit back and just let the pastor in the long run whether it works out good or whether it works out bad he's the only one gonna get the licks you just stay quiet well I shouldn't say him I say her also because you fail to realize hallelujah amen now now I'm in here now so I'm just going to deal with it Hallelujah I feel Hallelujah that you need to recognize a lot of times these get to her before I get to him and she'll begin to carry those burdens Hallelujah so she can protect him don't do her like that [Applause] we're supposed to be helpers of one another if you got a problem take it to the Lord in prayer don't use one another for an outlet to express yourself but now Church the word comes and God shows me I got a complex and I'm like oh my God so you know what I did from that point I said Lord if the pastor ain't dealing with it I ain't gonna do nothing so I just started singing I started kept going he get in there mess up everything again I said okay let's go but I stopped trying to handle it myself and then one day he got up there like he was the Beatles my pastor came he said look I don't want you playing like that in here anymore he says better yet I don't even want you playing with other people are playing only time I want you playing is when you sing it and from that day to this day we never had to deal with it again why because God dealt with it through the correct Channel and a lot of times when you're being pruned there's a channel that God works through Hallelujah it might not look right Hallelujah it might not feel right but God is getting the sickness out of the tree I got to close but what pruning does it takes care of fungi and other types of decaying and that's stopping it from spreading to healthier branches that's what pruning does so a lot of times the pastor comes and he deals with certain things what is he doing he's stopping the spreading of diseases so the tree can continue to bring forth fruit Hallelujah he said branches can also it says removing these branches can also expose the other branches tomorrow sunlight so in the pruning process sometimes when God deals with things that are very direct what is he doing he's making sure everybody is getting the light they deserve you might say why is he going on that channel because somebody is still under the shade somebody needs a direct hit so God will use the ministry to come in to prune the tree he's not killing he's making it more healthy it's so many different Avenues of pruning we could go down but for the sake of time I'm gonna cut it off amen he said which also helps to reduce the increases of diseases it encourages fruit publishing so you ask yourself where you are right now if your tree is not being pruned and you've been saved 20 30 plus years and there's no pruning going on God really want to cut you off foreign because you're not helping the tree and we have people come in and ride off the anointing right off the anointing of a good church right of the anointing of a good worship service right off the anointing of good preaching and never put anything back into it Hallelujah think about it think about this before I close if brother Paul would take a month off take a month off don't contact nobody don't call nobody anything could this church run sufficiently it should be able to that's that's that's the real running of God why because it's not a man running the church it's God running it if your pastor can be absent and you can take everything to God hallelujah and everything runs smoothly hard what does that mean that means even when he was here you were still taking everything to God foreign Hallelujah not to say that his position is not important but when you see him you should see God that's what made David's Mighty Men Mighty Hallelujah they was just as mighty as David was they were giant Killers why did they surrender under David because they saw God in David's life you had one man jumped out in the pit of the story they killing Lions you had another one kill so many men his head was shaken afterwards why would that man surrender to David he was just as mighty he could have had his own work he could have had his own private testimony but he saw God and David and that's where we are Church spiritual growth it normally comes the way of a trial and I got some different quotes but for the sake of time I'ma stop listen to Prophet God said God could with job he said God could have just stopped the whole thing he said but why didn't he'd much rather put you in a trial and then come visit you in the trial now I don't know about y'all but that excites me because I'm going through some trials Hallelujah and it lets me know that God has promised to show in the midst of my lack in the midst of my suffering God shows up Hallelujah just so he could show me his attributes to show me he's a provider Hallelujah show me he's a Healer show me show me he's a deliverer it's my trial that brings those things out so I hope we look at things different this morning and in my closing just to give you a scope of it improving there's something called a three-cut method where the tree is cut three different times just to deal with one branch being cut off the first cut holy you would think let's cut it to the base brother Kenny and just deal with the whole thing you can't just cut it from the base because the weight of the branch it ripped the tree when it's going down didn't be parts of the tree exposed that has to heal that's why a pastor doesn't just go right at the problem sometimes because they know he goes right through them chomping Hallelujah other people are going to get hurt that shouldn't even have to go through it so what that three cup method does it goes so many inches out to where the branch is and it cuts underneath where nobody can see the cut that's what I love about a true God called Ministry the word will come and cut you in ways that nobody else knows about a pastor come and deal with situations that nobody else knows about Hallelujah now you have to be spiritual enough to understand that it's for your good Hallelujah he comes in and cut the tree Hallelujah and he cut it up underneath amen you don't cut it all the way up and did a second cut you come out on top now a little bit beyond that cut and you cut straight through and asked the trip the branch falls what stops it from ripping all the way at the base that little cut that nobody else sees and sometimes it's the way God deals with us in private that keeps us afloat sometimes it's the way that the ministry deals with us in private Hallelujah it stops us from ripping unnecessarily and then once all of that is done the branch is off then he goes to the base of the tree and cuss the whole thing off of it there's no pressure there's no unmerited weight Hallelujah there's nothing to stop it from being a smooth cut and that cut is so smooth it heals so easily to where it looks like there was never even a branch there what we want God to do we don't want to be coming to church like see look where God cut me look no we wanted to be so smooth that you don't even realize I went through this trial Hallelujah I got an analogy I'll use all the time about people who want you to know they're going through something it's like a broke down washing machine the unbalanced washing machine sisters you know when you first buy that washing machine when the floor and everything is level you can't even hear it moving even the fast cycle seems like it's humming I know some of you Brothers lost because you're gonna help your wives wash clothes and you know that washing machine when everything is balanced it's just haunted and realize what makes the clothes clean dirt coming against dirt it's the dirty clothes washing each other with the solution inside the solution is strong enough to break it free but the clothes have to touch each other and we got the word we got the anointing Hollywood what we need we need to work cohesively as a unit in church Hallelujah but those people who want everybody to know what they're going through like an unbalanced washing machine at first you could be on this part of the house can't hear nothing everything but when that thing gets some balance can't nobody sleep at night husbands be like honey why are you washing clothes at night that thing is so loud it's the same washing machine just the floors are unbalanced now it's just something tilting wrong and now it's do you have to get any hit pause maybe move the clothes around no it ain't the clothes it's the unbalance and that's why some people are when they come to church they're unbalanced washing machine we're seeing how great God is did you hear what we're singing How Great Is Our God and you your own folded and I was telling the brothers the other day I'm closing one of my favorites right now is Reckless Love and I know you're spiritual ones you can't get that because you're thinking God love is not Reckless but it is because God's love is so reckless even when you're wrong his love will come in and grab you Hallelujah his love is so reckless the Hebrew boys just for standing for truth went to fire God says I'm coming in the fire with you his love is so reckless Hallelujah Daniel say God I got to pray Hallelujah they got to stop me from praying but I got to pray and God said don't worry about it my love will be there Hallelujah and this love goes into the lion's den Hollywood crystallize his mouth Hallelujah Church even in every room everything we've done God's love is so reckless Hallelujah he made a way for us to be forgiven [Applause] come on musicians come on closing we're in a day of spiritual growth we're Beyond just having Church we're Beyond just good services but now it's about changing lives holy because it's a scripture that puts me in the mind he says God is going to reap in places he had and so on Hallelujah think about that God is going to reap in places he hasn't sown so how is he going to reap if he hadn't sown he's relying on us he's relying on us to do the soy Hallelujah Church let's go beyond just good services and let God Clean us up let God touch those areas of your life if you're in a trial right now I want you to know God is with you he wants you he wants you to recognize it he wants you to understand that his hand is upon you Hallelujah oh the old well me never any Reckless Love of God oh it chases [Music] I couldn't earn it I don't deserve it [Music] away all the other ways [Music] Reckless Love of God oh it is [Music] come on yeah
