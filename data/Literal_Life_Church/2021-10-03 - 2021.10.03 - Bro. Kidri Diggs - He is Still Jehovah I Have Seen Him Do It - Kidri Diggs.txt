TRANSCRIPT
========================================
then we want to go to um psalms 121. exodus chapter six if you haven't say man verse 1 the bible says then the lord said unto moses now shall thou see what i will do to pharaoh for with a strong hand shall he let them go and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land and god spoken to moses and said unto him i am the lord and i appeared unto abraham unto isaac and unto jacob by the name of god almighty but my name jehovah was i not known to them amen let's go to psalms 121. verse 1 the bible says i will lift up mine eyes unto the heels from whence cometh my help my help cometh from the lord which made heaven and earth he will not suffer thy foot to be moved he that keepeth thee will not slumber behold he that keepeth israel shall neither slumber nor sleep the lord is thy keeper the lord is thy shade upon thy right hand the sun shall not smite thee by day nor the moon by night the lord shall preserve thee from all evil he shall preserve thy soul the lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from the time forth and even forevermore may lord bless read of his word you can have your seats amen praise the lord this morning by the grace of god i want to encourage you amen how many loves to be encouraged but this encouragement i'm gonna i want to give out this morning it should never leave you it should stay with you forever because i'm gonna try to encourage you through the word of god and the word of god has no expiration date it doesn't change with the trials and error of life it doesn't change with the different storms that may come forward but the word of god remains the same so if you can receive any kind of encouragement out of the word it doesn't matter what you go through that word remains the same so all you got to do is pick that back up and be like david encourage yourself all over again hallelujah because one thing we have to realize when it came to the people of god when they went through things that they may have made mistakes but after the mistake was made god was still there god never changed who he was when samson was deceived and uh by delilah as soon as his hair grew back and he recognized that the strength of god was always there it was just that he got out of the way hallelujah and so was it with many other different saints in the bible whatever promise god gave he never changed it he stayed there he was just waiting for the people to recognize who he is amen and and by his grace today i want to use for a subject he is still jehovah he's still jehovah amen and you know i love the scripture right here where he says in exodus the 6th chapter i appealed to abraham unto isaac and unto jacob by the name of god almighty hallelujah but for my name jehovah was i not known now he's talking to moses he's telling moses that there are levels of me god is saying hallelujah that you can't just put me in this category there are levels of god [Laughter] but let me tell you something church if you tap into what god did for abraham he's still the same god he's tough he has no respective person but what we have to do is find out who but you know what i love about him being god almighty who was he to abraham what was he doing as god almighty before he became or before he pronounced himself as jehovah as god almighty what was he doing for abraham he was pushing abraham into his position of faith hallelujah he said i'm the mighty god and i'm gonna push you into the position of faith think about it amen abraham was just a regular ordinary person and god comes to him and he says i'm going to make you the father of faith it's going to start with you abraham and abraham is looking at himself him and his wife he said you're gonna have a son but this woman and sarah laughs holly and god is saying hallelujah why did you laugh i'm god almighty i can do anything earlier so what that your body is wrinkled so what that abraham is old so what do you guys may not be knowing he's knowing each other like that i'm god almighty oh i didn't know what i'm talking about see god knows what he's able to do capable of doing hallelujah he wants us hallelujah to try him amen he wants us hallelujah to put him in position over our lives but as god almighty what did he do amen he he pushed abraham to believe hallelujah abraham didn't know he was the father of faith but god did so what god did god kept pushing him that more and more faith would come out more and more faith would come out what was god doing ian you know what he was doing he was unlocking the mystery of faith wow hallelujah he was unlocking the mystery of faith in abraham what kind of faith was it it was perfect faith and god was going to show that there's a level of faith hallelujah that has to be a lock in the believer's life but abraham i'm going to start it with you and like i said last night hallelujah god pushed abraham to believe past his fears hallelujah even though he the the mystery is being unlocked he looks at sarah and he says hey you're very beautiful and king is gonna want you see his fears his imaginations produced something that wasn't even true he was he was god almighty he was there to protect hallelujah and abraham in his own mind he's saying they're going to take you and kill me where did that come from god never said that he produced that in his own imaginations when god had already told him i'm god almighty and what god does he always proves his word so he he allowed what abraham was thinking to happen just so he could show how great he is he let sarah get taken then god comes to the king in a dream and he says you're as good as a dead man if you don't give her back why because i'm god almighty i can do what i want to do holly i can even protect a liar wow hallelujah he don't deserve it but i'm gonna protect my liar why because i'm god almighty [Applause] church look at that our god is so great he can protect you even when you're in sin even when it's your fault the reason why you're into what you're into see other kings they couldn't do that when you go through the bible different kings and different things happen i think about esther hallelujah and when vashta wouldn't come to the king and and the different chamberlains and different ones that are around they say hey king we can't let this happen because the other women are going to hear about this and they're going to rebel not when it came to god god didn't have to use hallelujah the advice of chamberlain's hallelujah god will let your life play out knowing he's god almighty knowing hallelujah if the seed of god is in you there is nothing that can stop it from coming forward [Applause] amen we look at our life and we say why does this happen and why that happened because god is unlocking a mystery and he let hallelujah the mystery of faith be unlocked right before their eyes as he protects that seed of faith hallelujah and then he tells the man give back his wife are you a good damn he says but god you know the integrity of my heart he says yeah that's why i didn't let you sin against me because i'm god almighty i know everything about it hallelujah church let's just think about how great god is amen now amen he gave hallelujah abraham back his wife and then he told that king hallelujah who was blameless the king did no wrong but because of who abraham was whoa because of what god told him god had to protect that seed wow sarah was a part of that promise so he couldn't let her get injected by false seed and we'll be looking at our lives sometimes and we say why does this happen why does it happen god has a plan he's trying to get his best out of you and the best way for god to get his best out of you is to let you go through something you know we ought to be rejoicing because we're going through trials we're going through tribulation we ought to be rejoicing the bible says count it all joy when you fall when you fall into darwin's temptation you're supposed to say thank you lord but you look at it he told that king he said hey restore the man back his wife and let him yeah that liar let him pray for you because he's my prophet god wasn't even looking at the life oh hell yeah all god was looking at was what he told abraham you are the father of faith god's not worried about what's going on in the middle of your life he's your beginning and he's your end everything in the middle is orchestrated to make you stronger and look what he did even in abraham and you know holly they had the son amen they had the son that god promised him hallelujah and look sarah who was an unbeliever in in that first moments she laughed about it but god dealt with her in such a way she named her son isaac why does she name him isaac isaac means laughter hallelujah will you go back and read it sarah said god has made me laugh because when the doctors were saying you won't be able to have a child holy god said i'm god almighty when the doctors were saying holy that the womb is buried god said i'm god almighty when everybody was saying that abraham was too old i was saying i'm god almighty i don't care what the doctors are telling you you have to realize he's god almighty hallelujah but then i loves when he gets down to jacob hallelujah and jacob hallelujah yes he doesn't even realize he's a product of the promise god gave abraham hallelujah and his life is going to be controlled by the promise god gave abraham you know what that promise did that promise made him lose his relationship with his brothers oh you thought you was gonna just serve the lord and everything was just gonna be all right no god is proving his word hallelujah you think about a church because of the promise god almighty made abraham jacob's life was in a whirlwind hallelujah he didn't know why he was sitting at home with mama in the kitchen cooking his brother outside hunting you know they probably looked at him and said man you ain't number old he said yeah but i know how to cook say what you want when you get hungry hey man i know how to cook and you know they probably look they haven't seen her but assistant he saw got all his boys they run out of their hunting they come back with game like they game orioles hallelujah and they stand out there hey man they show all the different stuff that they captured and this and that this and that and jacob sit back stir in the pot holly you know what it is sometimes god has you all to yourself just because he wants to stir up the pot hallelujah some of you got all of the proper ingredients but it's laying on the bottom of the pot honey and you sisters know holly we just had some of the best chili hallelujah in the whole wide world but it's no good sitting at the bottom of the pot the pot had to be stirred hallelujah and the hotter it gets the more you got the story of hallelujah because if you don't it will stick hallelujah oh my and god is tired of some of you coming to church and sticking to the pot [Applause] he's going to let it get hotter and hotter and hotter what is he trying to do he's trying to set you free and you know when that pot reaches the right temperature it's hot it's boiling all the ingredients they're so free they're bubbling everybody wants to show what's in the pot you got beans in there you got bell peppers in the head you got onions in there everything that's in the pot is trying to show itself and that's why god allows the pot to get hot because god hallelujah wants to show what's in this atmosphere [Applause] hallelujah what do you think about jacob's whole life it was a mystery to him because of what god was doing on the inside he lost his relationship with his brothers he lost his confidence with his daddy because he told him a lie but you know he had on his side his mama his mama before the foundation of the world hallelujah she was ordained to help her son tell a lie that was her purpose to help trick her profit husband because he wouldn't be able to do it without his mom sisters don't sell yourself short earlier there is a purpose for you in your life hallelujah you say well i'm just a i'm just a homebody hallelujah there are qualities that you are giving out at home that will be with your children for the rest of their life jacob would have never gotten that birth right jacob would have never gotten the holy ghost without the help of his mother oh and you moms heard earlier you are put in a position over these children hallelujah because your life is an influence on them and without you some of your children will never get the holy ghost hallelujah and you know church he lost his relationship with his brother hallelujah his daddy was looking at him funny because he got tricked hallelujah and then he had to run for his life but as he's running god is unlocking another mystery hallelujah he goes down in layman's house he sees a young lady he falls in love he says i got to have a hallelujah but then when he gets married i'm going kind of fast cause i'm trying to get somewhere then when he gets married hallelujah he gets a woman that he didn't want he gets a woman that he didn't want that's why it's very important hallelujah when you pray by these things be specific to god we got all the examples in the scripture church realize this jacob did not love leah she was a product of the promise god gave abraham he was in love with rachel hallelujah but you know what jacob said hallelujah you know you think about some of some of us some of us young ladies who've been single so long or young brothers have been single so long you be like lord i just need me a good church man no amens day what y'all looking for what y'all looking for i know you ain't looking for no hip-hop gangster at least at least let that be a part of your prayer but don't let that be the whole just of it because you you can get exactly what you ask god because he's god almighty he will give you your heart's desire you say lord i just need me a good church man and he'll come to church and be faithful hallelujah but at home he'll have emotional issues at home he may not provide for his family but he'll be faithful going to church because that's what you asked for but all that other stuff he may be lacking because you didn't ask god for a complete package [Applause] say lord i want a man who's going to go to church who's going to love the word and love me like you love the church hallelujah i want a man hallelujah that's going to put you first hallelujah and then his family check it because if he put you first hungry the next thing in line is automatically you [Applause] but so many times we go to god in prayer and we're not specific and then we get what god what we ask for and we're looking at god what is this [Music] what is this you say you asked for a good church man you didn't ask for somebody who loved the lord and he'll sinner this message for years and years and years because he's a good church man but never fell in love with god and then all of a sudden he's uprooting you and the whole family bouncing for church to church because he's a good church man oh my but when you ask for a full package lord i want somebody who's in love with you he can see those gifts in the ministry of god he can see the love of god in the people of god hallelujah and god is love [Applause] and you know god showed me a lesson about this a long time ago about being specific in prayer you know we say oh lord please father i just need me a piece of car just a piece of car something to get back and forth to work a piece of car and now what you get a piece of junk every time you turn around it's in the shop every time you look something got to be done to it and be like lord i pray for a car no you pray for a piece of car and that's what you got because god always gives you what you asked for hallelujah so you know me i'm just way out there i'm i'm i'm a different kind of believer i'm a different kind of message believer hallelujah i look at things like that and i say y'all know that belong to me you know that rolls royce belongs to me hallelujah you know that maserati belongs to me you know that 3 000 square foot house with the fogar garage belongs to me hallelujah why can't we believe like that he's still hallelujah god almighty but what we do is we put on this false humility because we believe people are looking at us [Music] i can't i can't drive that to church why not god gave it to you [Music] y'all heard me say this before hallelujah i got no problem celebrating what god has blessed me hallelujah if god has did it i'm going to give him praise but you look at what god did all the way through that church jacob's life hallelujah he was a product of the promise god gave to abraham and now god is constantly locking up unlocking mysteries hallelujah that they didn't even know they were a part of now jacob goes down in the labor's house he sees one girl and he gets two of you and he says you know what i'm gonna work another seven years because i got to have a holiday and you know what hollywood leah said you know what i'm so sick of you i'm gonna stop pushing our babies and leah starts to push our babies healthier and then rachel gets mad she says i'll give her my hands made hands may stop putting out babies and leah says you know what i got a hands made too her hands may stop pushing out babies now it looks like there's four women fighting over one man hallelujah but what is it god's unlocking the mystery hallelujah what mystery the mystery of the hundred and forty four thousand hallelujah hey jacob didn't know how it was gonna come about but it was there hallelujah he had to come through four different women that didn't like each other he's got almighty they looking like he my man she's like no he i mean i got four babies hallelujah but what was god doing holy he told abraham he said your seat is going to be like the stars it's going to be like the saints holy everywhere you look hallelujah it's going to reflect the seed of abraham and jacob was a part of that so his own life didn't belong to him so as god almighty what was he doing he was unlocking the mystery in the believer's life now we get to moses he's still god almighty now but he's gonna take it to another notch he comes to moses he says moses i've heard the cry of my people and i've come down to deliver them hallelujah and then he makes it real real he he he makes it real specific about what he's about to do he says look abraham isaac and jacob they've known me as god almighty but by my name jehovah they never knew me put that first quote up hardly hallelujah look he says but in genesis when he was made when he made man he said i am yahuwah yahweh jehovah what did it mean i am the all existing one who has created something off of myself see not only now is he pushing moses he's telling moses who you are is a part of me when you look in the mirror i want you to see me holy remember he says i've heard the cry and i've come down where was god he was in moses now he's taking the revelation of the believer and he's taking it a place higher he says something off of myself to be a son of mine or a temporary or amateur little one of mine glory why he gave man jehovah means that he gave man to be an amateur god before you go up hold right there he's telling moses i'm not only going to push you into your position but in this position i want you to be a god how many are you in your position if you are in your position you're not in there hallelujah as who you think you are with your public name or your name that came down from your father from the generations but no once you realize who you are you're in that position as a part of god so i want you to look at it a little bit different if you believe you're in the right church if you believe that brother paul has been called to be your pastor you're not looking at paul preach you're looking at god talk to you [Applause] and the prophet of god say that's our greatest challenge our challenge is not believing that god hallelujah can use man but believing and seeing that god is in man because we see one another's mistakes we see one another's huff and puffing when we get mad and all these things but now he's saying when you begin to know me as jehovah hello i'm going to show you hallelujah that you are a part of me and what does he do with moses he has to change moses thinking hallelujah he tells moses he says hey you going to go deliver the people and moses lord i lord i can't do this lord i can't dad lord who am i who i'm gonna and god say shut up moses stop crying to me go back and read your bible i know it's a little bit more graphic coming out of my mouth what else he told moses he comes to moses he says who made your mouth see he won't let him settle hollywood by just the mystery being unlocked he wants him to see the total the total scope of who he is and moses is looking at himself and he's saying i'm this i'm that i'm doing some that and god says be quiet moses he says who made your mouth and all these things and now god is gonna put moses holly he's going to enlighten moses and what's really going on because he's saying you're going to know me as jehovah and he says hey you be god and let aaron be your prophet he changed the whole microscope of it he said you're not going down here as just a prophet deliverer but you're going down here as a god and as a god everything is under your control hallelujah he's still jehovah let's keep going he says because he's a father god and he made a man an amateur god so he isn't self-existing anymore he exists with his family so what i'm saying this morning the head of this church is jehovah he exists with his family hallelujah ella ella elohim now he is jehovah jehovah means the one who exists with his family [Music] but jesus why are you saying he's still jehovah well let's think about it who's the head of the family the father now for those of us who are fathers you think about it as a father and my daughter no i'm finna use her as example but you know she's at an age now where she wants to drive and all these things like that if i ever come out of my mouth and i say you know what when you turn 18 i'm gonna have a 500 mercedes benz waiting on you she ain't heard nothing as i said but 500 mercedes benz because those words are coming from her father the one who's taking care of her since she was a baby the one who's fed her the one who fight her battles all that all she sees is my father made me a promise wow she gonna come back to me and say daddy you got the money at no she's sticking with the promise she's not gonna come to me and say well daddy how you going to get it all she know is i made her a promise what about us church if he's still jehovah shouldn't we stick to what god has said [Applause] he said i'm the lord and i changed that now if he's still god the father he exists with his family that means every word he's given us is still relevant today all she knows when she ate 18 she's gonna be looking at the window she's going to watch me see if i'm going someway see if i'm going to get something cause now she has an expectation based upon the promise i gave hallelujah that's the god we serve if he steals jehovah you should have an expectation based upon the promises god has made he said i'll never leave you nor forsake you you know what i'm in a place now where i'm not just looking for blessings i'm looking for the bountiful blessing he said press down shaken together he said prove me hallelujah he said it'll be so much that you won't even be able to contain it he's still jehovah church i went to the bank because i need to move and i went there and people look at my account they look at all the stuff he said before we do anything you got to come up with 17 dollars and looking at my account the man said where you gonna get it from i'm like you just get the loan going you get the loan going my god will take care of the rest but see they don't see what we see well he's looking at his w-2 forms and tax tax returns and all these things i'm not looking at that i'm looking at the promise so what my account doesn't reflect 17 holly in the natural but it does in the spirit you say well brothers how can you how can you go into something like that because my subtitle is i've seen them do it i've seen him do it hallelujah amen i've seen god do things hallelujah that was just miraculous amen you know there's a sister that came to our church hallelujah hey man she's a good good good good friend of ours from london hey man she came to the church and she started telling a testimony about finding a job anybody need a job talk to me now i'm gonna tell you how to get it hardly remember he steal jehovah she said lord i didn't fill out a hundred applications a hundred she said all i need is just one person to call me back hallelujah and then she had one person to call and this is a very high profile job honey they called back they said come on we want you to come in for the interview she passed the interview they said okay now there are tests you have to take colleen and the first test had to deal with math and she's like i'm not that good at man not at all i'm not that good at math she said but lord i'm trusting you she said she looked at some of the questions some of the some of the different problems and stuff and she's like i don't know none of this stuff she said but that's what i'm gonna do lord i'm gonna trust you and she bowed her head and she prayed and she said lord i want you to guide my hand to every answer and from that moment after the prayer she didn't even look at the problems what was that that same fate that god gave abraham as god almighty is still in the believer's life when he reveals himself as jehovah so what she did hallelujah y'all ever did this in school she went a b c d d c a b she did that the whole test believing that god was guiding her hand she wasn't even looking at the questions she didn't even look at the problems what was she doing she was depending on jehovah one who exists with his family so you know what church what she did after the test she folded it up and sent it in harley went home and she was waiting on a call harley it was it was like four other women taking the same test when they called they called her back and they said you pass they say but you didn't just pass you made a perfect score [Applause] he's still jehovah god he's still jehovah he'll let you pass the test even when you're going into his blind [Applause] hallelujah but it wasn't done because he's the head of the family hallelujah church she had another interview for the same job now she said they said you scored higher than anybody ever scored why because god took the test where was god he was in her [Applause] all you got to do is turn it over to him church holly then the next interview was some kind of personality interview what she got there they actually all kind of questions what would you do in this situation blah blah blah so the interviewer said she said now you have questions based upon personality or whatever it was and you got to come up with the answers so the interviewer said when they ask you this question this is what you say when they ask you the next question this is what you say so for every question the interviewer gave her all the answers church when god do something he does it and she wasn't even worthy pretty much of getting a job hallelujah but god made sure she got the job amen because he's the one who exists with his family if god ever gives you a promise he's going to make it come to pass hallelujah and you think about it amen if he's a father he has to be a husband amen hallelujah and if he's a husband that means he has to be a provider hallelujah god is still a provider you know why i can believe god for seventeen thousand dollars you know why i can believe him for that because i know of another brother brother tony he may have known i'm talking about holly i i know another brother him and his wife was praying about a house and y'all may have heard this this testimony but we need to put it out then yeah honey he's believing this him and him and his wife is believing for her house and they had the deal and the deal fell through and from that moment every morning a certain time she used to get up out of the bed go into another room and pray and the husband didn't realize what was going on he said he'd wake up and she'd be gone but one morning he followed she was in the other room praying she did that for two years cause she was wondering lord why did you let this fall through she's like we were right there why would you let this fall through let me tell you if something fall through that mean god has something better in store hallelujah he got something better in store don't get discouraged he's still jehovah if he's a father he has to be a husband so harlow his her husband was a a minister and their pastor had to go overseas and preach but the pastor couldn't go so the pastor told him to go so he went to this church and he preached and had a good time this and that blah blah blah just being in his position hallelujah so when he was getting ready to leave the brother he preached for he said hey uh you got children he said yes he said he like candy he says yes he says i'm gonna put a bag of candy in your luggage so he gave him a brown paper bag full up with candy he gets home his wife in her position starts to unpack the clothes and she says honey what is this she said she said that's just a bag of candy for the children so she starts to unravel the bag and she comes back she says oh honey oh honey this ain't no candy honey this is a bag of money honey hallelujah church it wasn't just a little bit of money it was 350 000 dollars [Applause] and you want to tell me don't believe jehovah for 17. holy that brother hallelujah that gave him the candy he said lord see god is always working on both ends he said lord if you blessed me with this business deal i paid a tithing to the first brother that come and preach for us hallelujah and because god knew who he had to go to he made it where the pastor couldn't go hollywood so where the evangelist in the church could go why because he needed to build a house he was ready to move [Applause] and not only did his wife get the house she won't whoa you told my billy the house this house she built she built a house with a swimming pool indoors he's god he's still jehovah church i've seen them do it i've seen god unlock things that shouldn't be unlocked but because he's god me and a friend of mine we were going to a men's meeting one time and you know we stopped at a gas station and we were like hey i'm gonna pay for the gas he was like no i'm gonna pay for the guy i'll say i'm gonna pay for that no i'm gonna be able to get somebody's running inside the stove to pay for the gas not realizing that his doors were going to lock automatically with the keys in the ignition it's on the door lock and both was out there looking at each other like we crazy because we are going to buy who's going to pay the gas only only believers can do that only believers going to argue about who gonna pay try that with your family member they okay bless bless the lord that's right god is praise the lord you're gonna buy that thank you what about my child only believers hallelujah want to be a blessing to someone but you know what we come back to the car holidays oh man my door's locked we're about two hours away not two hours about an hour away from where we need to be on the side of the pump everything is locked up he says hey you got your keys i said yeah i got my keys he said give me your keys he took my keys he took my house key put it in the door i said what you doing my house key he said i'm gonna lock the door he tucked the key house key not the key to the ignition not the door key tucked the key put it in the door turned it unlocked we jumped in praise the lord drove to the misery now i'm telling the testimony god can unlock a dog even if it looks like you got the wrong key [Applause] hallelujah church i asked him i said bro what made you do that he said i seen him do it hallelujah see church what we have to do we have to fall back to what we've seen god do already that's what makes him jehovah he's one who exists with his family and you know if he's a father and a husband hallelujah he still has to be jehovah rapha he still has to be a healer and for those who are worried about this this pandemic and all these different things church when the pandemic first started as an evangelist i couldn't move so my finances are unlocked brother called me we stopped fellowshipping he said how are you doing i'm doing all right see i'm doing all right y'all know this brother too i ain't gonna

believe god for 17 000 i've seen him do it in the midst of a pandemic [Applause] church and it wasn't god stocking up this big old bank account for me no everything that was sent to me i needed and it was used by the grace of god hallelujah he's still one who exists with this family amen if you talk about healing amen which is the children's bread i know a sister who contracted uh covert or got sick or whatever she had just got a new job and she said oh lord i'm gonna lose my job i ain't gonna have no money i don't get paid you know what she didn't work that job for a month never went into the job but every payday she got a check [Applause] tell me what other place will that happen except for in the body of christ [Applause] never met her bosses never had a time clock never even been in the position but every week for a month she got a full 40 hour paycheck until she recovered [Music] oh what a mighty god we sir churchill have you uh uh i'm i'm getting ready to close if you're a person who's fighting sickness and disease we got a brother at our church right now uh elderly brother who got covered hallelujah and he looked like before he started coming to us he got covert and everything and he looked like he was on his deathbed but prayer brought him back holy and now if you come to our church i i'll show you he's the older brother body in his 70s and he walked around the church doing this the whole time doing the worship service and for those of you not spiritual you look at him and say he's out of order but he's right in order because god has delivered them hallelujah he is still jehovah [Applause] i've seen them do it church i've seen them open blinded eyes i've seen them heal diabetes not once but twice in me i've seen him heal cancer now there's somebody else but in me i've seen him heal a broken heart not in someone else but in me oh yeah open up deaf ears not in someone else but in me hallelujah he's god who exists with his family and as a father every word he's spoken will come to pass every word he shared hollywood you have to hold on to i'm gonna read one more and i'm gonna get out of the way listen now remember when brother brother was having a debate with brother um what was what was the old dog man the man he had debate with we wanted to fight him dr best thank you brother he was having a debate with dr best and brother branham asked him a question he actually was the redemptive names of jehovah in the covenant and dr bess couldn't ask the question well he could but if he would have said yes that means that he's jehovah rapha and we got a right to be a healer hallelujah so if he's jehovah rapha that means he's jehovah jairo if he's jehovah jairo hallelujah he's a provider and a healer amen hallelujah he's jehovah nisi amen he's a better he's a shield he's all that he's overra hallelujah he can't be one without the other so let me say it real plain to you church if god is your provider hallelujah you got the same access to healing if he's your healing help you you got the same access to him being a provider if he's your provider you got the same access as him being a protector he's jehovah and every avenue hallelujah he can't be one without being the other [Applause] but it's according to your need this morning hallelujah churchill i've seen myself what i consider to be on the short end of the stick a lot of times but it's god it's god right there holly unlocking unfolding and blessing all at the same time while we look at it and say why am i going through this why is this happening why is that happening he's still jehovah because church the children of israel the children of israel heard moses say i've come to deliver god has sent me and boy they got they got hyped they were like oh why are we gonna get out of here yeah they were ready and then they got that first opportunity god came down doing signs and wonders through moses and the people bagged up they still was ready and pharaoh said just sit down you ain't going nowhere and they were like just all the air went out of their cell and look at it he did that at least nine to ten times and the people hollering they start to lose their confidence in what moses said but what they was failing to realize they were losing their confidence in what god said holy and to the place they got to the place to where they start complaining about supernatural things god was doing can you imagine isaac they sit there eating supernatural food from hell from from from heaven and then they say our souls loathe with this light brain god told me they eating bread from heaven holly they even cook fish from heaven hallelujah and they start complaining why because god wasn't doing it the way they expected it but let me tell you something the way god does it nine times out of ten is always the best way hallelujah so you look at a church they get to a place to where they're not even believing moses anymore they're just out there they just going to church they just going to church they don't even believe that there's a real deliverance you think about how many people hallelujah because we've said that there's going to be a rapture at least a thousand years now we've been hearing by the rapture at least a thousand years and now you got people who say ah rapture man please they didn't believe in the prophet no more why because it hasn't happened in their time but you know god god is a god who loves to prove you holy he said i've led you the way of the wilderness to prove you and see what was really in your heart that's why god allows a pandemic to come to see who really loves him to see who's going to press through what all the naysayers are saying and still come back to church but not only come back to church be happy you're here and you don't have restrictions on your fellowship can't shake nobody's hand cause uh uh you know there's a pandemic foolishness oh my that's my lawn see i'm mindful but you think about it god allow these things to happen to seek who you to show you who you really are he knows who you are so he let them come out hallelujah and all these different things and just like he did us he gave us a pandemic that shut down the whole world just to see who was going to stay faithful just to see when the opportunity to present himself who was going to stay home hallelujah and be able to control brother diggs i don't like that subject oh he's talking about me honey just cut that off he put the remote in your hand to see what you gonna do with it and it's sad to say that some people have gotten so over charged with the atmosphere of the pandemic they've forgotten that this is just a test this is just the test to see who you really are hallelujah but for those hallelujah who stayed true to what moses was saying hallelujah there was a day coming hallelujah and i'm gonna end with this one what paul was saying honey moses is in the whole church because now he's jehovah man he's not just god almighty they're standing at a red sea two million of them maybe and they're wondering how are we gonna get over this hallelujah what they should have been saying god is able look at your bills and you ought to be saying god is able look at your health and you ought to be saying god is able look at your family and you ought to be saying god is able we don't live in present conditions we live by the word we don't live hallelujah in the moment we live by prophecy hallelujah we live by prophecy church the moment is only a shadow hallelujah church not until the place that the rest don't get nervous don't about the clothes now they had the red sea hallelujah and everybody's wondering what we gonna do they should have said with god and gave us food from heaven not just food from heaven but food that nobody else has ever tasted we're eating a revelation that denominations have never ever tasted earlier we got food on our plate that has never been in the stores it ain't even on the bookshelf in your best christian store because this is something earlier that you can only get from our father's table [Applause] that's what they should have been saying they should have been saying i don't know but if he gave us water out of a rock think about that they didn't have no shovels and stuff to deal with god told moses go to that rock and speak to it hallelujah see god was already grooming moses trying to get moses to speak but moses so caught up with the people he wanna hit something church hallelujah now he's standing there in the water god so faithful god lets water come forth church not just any water but they were drinking water that nobody else has ever drank we're drinking from a fountain that nobody has ever tasted he's still jehovah and now he gets to holly the red sea and moses is so worried about the people and all the stuff he said god you brought these people this and this and that and all this and and they crying and all that stuff and this and that god you know what he did again he told moses shut up moses that's all some of us do we cry a bunch of crybabies oh god i thought i was really a saint i've been serving you and why am i going through all this because he wants you to be perfect hallelujah and moses is crying and this and that god says shut up moses speak and move forward but what i love about that whole story it looked like the red sea was the problem red sea wasn't the problem the problem was what was behind them and like he said before he came up holly don't let your past put you on the run don't let your past lead you to a place hallelujah where you don't have no ouch they're running from the past of egypt and moses god tell moses to speak hallelujah moses says stand still harley and see the salvation of the lord now he's not even talking to the sea but he says the egyptians whom you see you shall see him no more forever and when moses said that the sea heard it hallelujah and the sea start moving so god has things in your place ready to open up once you deal with your past when you deal with your past god already got the doors open to your future [Applause] and in that moment to see heard god speak to the enemy knowing that hallelujah the sea was the only thing that could destroy the egyptians forever but it was already in the path of the believers the thing to deliver you is already in your path you just got to say the right thing church holy and then they go through the red sea they didn't walk through mud dry ground dry ground before i close listen god said when joseph holly i mean when joshua led the church back to the jordan he said it was the highest times for the tithe he said why would god lead that way at the highest times he said but joshua had to be confident in what god said he said yeah joshua had to check the list say lord you told me to be strong and very courageous check logic told me not to bow down to any other man check lord you told me not to have no babylonians garments check and all josh had to do is go down his checklist of everything that god told him to do and if he did that everything brother branham said now joshua looking at his checklist not as checklist but he said now joshua looking at everything god told him to do and if he had did his part holy the next step belongs to god have you done everything you're supposed to do according to what god has asked you to do the next step belongs to god holly don't you worry the next step belongs to god amen and as soon as they stepped in the water the water started to move but the key to the whole thing what you gonna do after god give you the blessing after you see that he steal jehovah how does that change your life what does it do for you what does it do for this assembly is it just a testimony hold on one day i'm gonna share it one one day when the time is right i'm gonna tell somebody what god did the day god does this the day to tell it hallelujah hallelujah church i stand here as a person hallelujah living by faith hallelujah that comes into roadblock at the roadblock but he's still jehovah he's still he's still on the scene amen he's still moving see i got it on snooze to make sure i don't keep going but look when they got to the red sea they crossed the red sea it was after they crossed every cross what was going on on the other side hallelujah on the other side hallelujah they began to sing and dance they began to worship hollywood they began to give god praise hallelujah why they were looking at all their problems they were looking at all the faith that the devil ever did to them being washed away in the sea hallelujah so they begin to give god praise they begin to sing songs of zion all the way the bible says miriam led the daughter's society to worship church and she took an instrument called the tambourine something that was created in bondage hallelujah an instrument that she created in bondage and she took that instrument and led a revival the question is what has god given you in your bondage that he's been looking for you to use now that you're free [Applause] come on musicians and they worshipped and when i say they wish they worshipped for you people like oh we can't say we need message songs we can't even i don't think that them people life ain't right the rain falls on the just and the unjust but it's the holy ghost that separates hallelujah church i don't get into all that i just like the anointing amen the anointing of god hallelujah and you think about the church you know for for for those people who who may feel that way when the inspiration of music comes hollywood you know the prophet god said he said dancing and shouting is a sign of victory so every time we sing a new song you know what it is victory hallelujah it's scripture the bible says moses sung a new song he didn't say something that he sung on the backside of the desert he didn't the children of israel didn't say something that they someone else in bondage hallelujah a new testimony required a new soul [Applause] [Music] and they worship god as they saw all their problems drown in the sea and they stood there hallelujah giving god praise singing the song of moses that moses began to sing by inspiration now the question is now that you know he's jehovah where is your inspiration [Applause] hallelujah church he's still jehovah he's still one who exists with his family he's still our father he's still our healer he's still our protector he's still our banner our shield whatever you need him to be god [Music] lord jesus father's in times like these lord where the sobbiness of the spirit comes and deals with the inward man [Music] lord we can see that your hand has been upon our life all this time lord directing and moving different obstacles and even letting certain obstacles be in our way just to prove us and show us where we are in time the lord just to know that we're not creatures of time but we're only down here for a moment if we could just tap into our future if we can tap into the prophecy of our lives to show that you have a word for every situation everything that's laying before us as your prophet will say when you're going through stuff be identified with bible characters find yourself in the scripture he said if you find yourself in the scripture it'll play out the same way as the woman down in memphis tennessee she said i'm just like that shooting my now where is my elijah daughter her faith about the plain of elijah down that brought forth a restoration to a son lord no let us find our place because you are still jehovah you're still the head of this family we don't follow a man we don't we we're not controlled by man but it's you and you alone [Music] lord we just thank you and we give you honor and glory praise we just continue to bless this church lord and all those who are here to hear let us be better christians lord and all the different things in our lives that may be in your way help us to put it aside and believe you for those things that we don't see but we believe they're there because you said it and you can't take it back in your great and holy name we pray we thank you the church say amen the church say amen god bless you church
