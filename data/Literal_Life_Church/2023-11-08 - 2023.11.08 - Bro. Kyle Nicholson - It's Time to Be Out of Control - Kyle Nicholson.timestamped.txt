[22:17] good thank you
[22:20] musicians
[22:22] amen if we want to open our Bibles to
[22:25] First Peter chapter 3
[22:29] verses 8-
[22:35] 15 it's thankful to be in the house of
[22:38] the
[22:40] Lord thankful for the grace and mercy
[22:42] the Lord has given
[22:46] us so it says and finally be ye all one
[22:50] mind having compassion one of another
[22:53] love as Brethren be pitiful be courteous
[22:57] not rendering evil evil for evil or
[22:58] railing for railing but contris blessing
[23:02] knowing that ye are there unto called
[23:05] that ye should inherit a blessing
[23:08] forther he that will love life and see
[23:10] good days let him refrain his tongue
[23:12] from evil and his lips that they speak
[23:15] no guile let him asue evil and do good
[23:20] let him seek peace and ensue it for the
[23:24] eyes of the Lord are over the righteous
[23:26] and his ears are open unto their prayers
[23:30] but the face of the Lord is against them
[23:31] that do
[23:33] evil and who is he that will harm you if
[23:36] ye be followers of that which is
[23:38] good but and if ye suffer for
[23:41] righteousness sake happy are ye and be
[23:44] not afraid of their Terror neither be
[23:48] troubled but sanctify the Lord God in
[23:51] your hearts and be ready always to give
[23:54] an answer to every man that asketh you a
[23:56] reason of the hope that is in you with
[23:59] meekness and fear let's pray Lord we
[24:02] just ask that you add the blessing to
[24:04] your word Lord Lord I pray that you just
[24:07] open our hearts Lord let us hear from
[24:09] you Lord Jesus Lord let them pull on
[24:12] this gift Lord that you've given me Lord
[24:13] let me step out of the way Lord so I can
[24:15] hear from you Lord Jesus we thank you
[24:18] for that Lord in Jesus name we pray amen
[24:21] you have your
[24:24] seats
[24:26] so I'm really terrible with
[24:29] titles and I don't like titles because I
[24:32] don't want to box up this and make it
[24:34] into something that God didn't want it
[24:35] to be but if I had a title it would be
[24:38] it's time to be out of
[24:43] control so I'm going to read this in the
[24:46] Amplified
[24:48] again and he says finally all of you be
[24:52] like-minded this is Peter speaking
[24:54] United in in spirit sympathetic
[24:57] brotherly kind-hearted courteous and
[24:59] compassionate towards each other as
[25:00] members of one household and humble in
[25:03] spirit being like-minded with your
[25:06] brothers being humble in
[25:08] spirit and never return evil for evil or
[25:11] an insult for an
[25:13] insult avoid scolding berading and any
[25:16] kind of abuse but on the contrary give a
[25:20] blessing anyone that hurts you or abuses
[25:22] you or insults you return them with a
[25:25] blessing pray for one other's well-being
[25:27] contentment and protection for you have
[25:30] been called for this very purpose that
[25:32] you might inherit a blessing from God
[25:34] that brings well-being happiness and
[25:36] protection praying for others is
[25:39] extremely
[25:41] important verse 10 say for the one who
[25:45] wants to enjoy life and see good days
[25:47] good whether it's apparent or not good
[25:49] is relative in a lot of ways we like to
[25:53] think of good in a certain way but it
[25:55] doesn't mean that's what God wants so
[25:57] whether it's apparent or not and you
[26:00] want to enjoy life keep your tongue free
[26:02] from Evil and your lips from speaking
[26:04] Gile from treachery and
[26:07] deceit he must turn away from the
[26:09] wickedness and do what is right he must
[26:11] search for peace with God with s and
[26:14] with others and pursue it eagerly
[26:16] actively not merely Desiring it pursuing
[26:19] peace with God and in yourself and peace
[26:22] with
[26:22] others Peter's got a lot of good things
[26:24] to say for eyes of the Lord are looking
[26:27] favorably upon the righteous the upright
[26:29] and his ears are attentively attentive
[26:32] to their prayers eager to answer but the
[26:35] face of the Lord is against those who
[26:37] practice
[26:38] evil Lord will hear our
[26:41] prayers when we don't practice evil now
[26:45] who is there to hurt you if you become
[26:46] enthusiastic for what is good but even
[26:49] if you should suffer for sake of
[26:51] righteousness thou it is though it is
[26:54] not certain that you will you will still
[26:57] you are still blessed happy to be
[26:58] admired and favored by God do not be
[27:00] afraid of their intimidating thoughts
[27:02] nor be troubled or dis disturbed by
[27:05] their opposition with God what do we
[27:07] have to fear we get so afraid and
[27:10] everything is about fear today
[27:12] everything we come up against every news
[27:14] article everything you hear is Fear With
[27:18] God what do we have to
[27:19] fear but in your heart set Christ apart
[27:21] as holy acknowledging him giving him
[27:23] first place in your lives as lord always
[27:26] be ready to give a logic iCal defense to
[27:28] anyone who asks you to account for the
[27:31] hope and confidence Assurance elected by
[27:34] faith that is within you yet do it with
[27:36] gentleness and
[27:38] respect you should know why you believe
[27:40] what you believe and we shouldn't be
[27:42] fighting people of what we believe we
[27:45] should be doing with gentleness and
[27:47] respect so I want to paint a picture of
[27:51] Peter for a minute so don't get ahead of
[27:52] me just stick with me for a minute so
[27:55] Peter has a lot of Godly advice a lot of
[27:57] good good thing to show us here in these
[27:59] scriptures and Peter is very bold and
[28:02] fearless and if we look in the book of
[28:04] Acts we'll see a lot of this so if you
[28:06] want to go to you don't have to but acts
[28:09] 2:14 we're going to read quite a few
[28:11] here but if you want to pull that
[28:16] up but Peter standing up with the 11
[28:19] lifted up his voice and said unto them
[28:21] ye men of Judea and all ye that dwell at
[28:24] Jerusalem be with uh be this known unto
[28:27] you and hearken to my words 15 for these
[28:31] are not drunken as you suppose see it is
[28:33] but the third hour of the
[28:36] day but this is what that which was
[28:39] spoken by the prophet
[28:41] Joel and it shall come to pass in the
[28:43] last day saith God I will pour out my
[28:45] spirit onto All Flesh and your sons and
[28:48] your daughters shall prophesy and your
[28:50] young men shall see visions and your old
[28:51] men shall dream
[28:53] dreams and on my servants and my
[28:56] handmaids I will pour out in those days
[28:58] of my spirit and they shall prophesy and
[29:01] I will show wonders in Heaven above and
[29:04] signs in Earth beneath bold and fire
[29:07] blood and fire and Vapor of
[29:09] smoke the sun shall be turned into
[29:12] darkness and the moon into blood before
[29:14] the great and notable day of the
[29:17] Lord and it shall come to pass that
[29:19] whosoever shall call in the name of the
[29:21] Lord shall be saved it doesn't matter
[29:23] who it is the Lord just has a call on
[29:25] his name they shall be saved ye men of
[29:28] Israel hear these words Jesus of
[29:30] Nazareth a man above approved of God
[29:32] among you by Miracles wonders and signs
[29:35] which God did by him in the midst of you
[29:38] as ye yourselves also know so they know
[29:41] all the Wonders and the signs that Jesus
[29:43] done they've watched it him being
[29:46] delivered by the determinate counsel and
[29:49] for knowledge of God ye have taken and
[29:51] by Wicked hands have crucified and slain
[29:54] so Peter starts to get really serious to
[29:56] them right now and whom God had raised
[29:59] up and having loose the Pains of death
[30:00] because it was not possible that he
[30:02] should be Holden of it they tried to
[30:04] kill him it didn't work for David
[30:07] speaketh concerning him I foresaw the
[30:09] lord always before my face for he is on
[30:12] my right hand that I should not be
[30:15] moved keep going therefore did my heart
[30:18] rejoice and my tongue was glad moreover
[30:20] also my flesh shall rest in
[30:23] hope I'm going to
[30:26] 38
[30:30] because thou Wist not leave my soul in
[30:32] Hell neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy
[30:34] One to see
[30:36] corruption thou Hast made known to me
[30:39] the ways of life Thou shalt make me full
[30:41] of joy with thy counter countenance men
[30:44] and Brethren let me freely speak unto
[30:46] you of the patriarch David that he is
[30:49] both dead and buried and this Seer is
[30:52] with us until this day therefore be a
[30:55] prophet and being a prophet prophet and
[30:57] knowing that God had sworn with an oath
[31:00] to him that of the fruit of his loins
[31:02] according to the flesh he would rise up
[31:04] Christ to sit on his
[31:06] throne he is seeing this before spake he
[31:09] seeing this before spake of the
[31:11] resurrection of Christ that his soul was
[31:13] not left in Hell neither his flesh did
[31:15] he see corruption this Jesus hath God
[31:18] raised up whereof we all are
[31:21] witnesses therefore being by the right
[31:23] hand of God exalted and having received
[31:26] of the Father the promise of the Holy
[31:28] Ghost he has shed forth this which ye
[31:30] now see and hear for David has not
[31:33] ascended into the heavens but he but he
[31:37] saith himself the Lord say unto my
[31:39] Lord sit thou on my right hand until I
[31:44] make thy foes thy foot stol therefore
[31:46] let all the house of Israel knowing
[31:49] assuredly that God hath made the same
[31:51] Jesus whom ye have crucified both Lord
[31:54] and Christ now when they heard this they
[31:56] were pricked in their heart and said
[31:58] unto Peter and to the rest of the
[32:01] Apostles men and Brethren what shall we
[32:03] do then Peter said unto them repent and
[32:06] be baptized every one of you in the name
[32:08] of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[32:10] remission of your sins and you shall
[32:11] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so
[32:14] Peter is really bold he calls all these
[32:17] guys out on everything they've ever
[32:20] done he literally tells them that they
[32:23] know what Jesus did they know the
[32:25] Miracles and then they crucified him
[32:27] they're the ones that killed
[32:29] Jesus Peter is not standing in front of
[32:33] two or three people when he does this
[32:34] there's 3,000 people that receive the
[32:37] Holy Ghost when this happens so Peter
[32:40] boldly goes out and speaks in front of
[32:42] all these people calls them all out on
[32:46] every terrible thing that they've
[32:47] committed on Jesus it wasn't very easy
[32:51] for him to do that this is a giant mob
[32:54] if you can imagine walking out to the to
[32:56] a giant m mob in doing that to walk out
[32:59] into somebody and tell them terrible
[33:02] things that they've done that you've
[33:03] seen that they do and you're going to
[33:05] call them out on every last bit of it
[33:07] and there's a couple of you and
[33:09] thousands of them but the Lord sent you
[33:12] to say all of the stuff that they've
[33:14] done and sent you to give this message
[33:18] the boldness it would take to do that
[33:20] how much grit you would have to have to
[33:22] stand before all those people and do
[33:24] that at any given time they can just
[33:26] beat you up
[33:27] they can rob you they can kill you they
[33:29] can do whatever they want to do there's
[33:32] nothing you're going to be able to do to
[33:33] thousands of people but Peter stood out
[33:35] there and did this because the Lord
[33:37] called him to do
[33:39] it he did it with boldness and 3,000
[33:42] people receive the Holy
[33:44] Ghost so Acts 3 1-9 says now Peter John
[33:49] went up together in the temple at The
[33:51] Hour of Prayer being the ninth hour and
[33:53] a certain man lame from his mother's
[33:55] womb was carried whom they laid daily at
[33:58] the Gate of the temple which is called
[34:00] Beautiful to ask alms of them that
[34:02] entered into the
[34:04] temple who seeing Peter and John about
[34:06] to go into the temple asked alms so this
[34:09] beggar man is just sitting there and he
[34:11] asked Peter and John for something and
[34:14] Peter fastened his eyes upon him with
[34:17] John said look unto us look on
[34:21] us and he gave heed on them expecting to
[34:23] receive something of them then Peter
[34:25] said silver and gold have Have I None So
[34:28] if you can imagine being this dude
[34:29] sitting here that needs money and Peter
[34:33] says look onto me and gets real serious
[34:35] with you and you think
[34:37] sweet this is going to work out today
[34:40] and then the guy says Silver and Gold
[34:42] Have I None well that didn't go so well
[34:46] didn't see that one coming and he says
[34:49] but such as I have give I Thee in the
[34:51] name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up
[34:53] and walk and he took him by the right
[34:56] hand and lifted him up and immediately
[34:58] his feet and ankle bones received
[34:59] strength and he leaped up stood and
[35:02] walked and entered in with them into the
[35:03] temple walking and leaping and praising
[35:05] God and all the people saw him walking
[35:07] and praising God so Peter again I mean
[35:11] this is bold so if you imagine you're at
[35:13] the Walmarts you're walking around and
[35:16] the Lord sends you to one person a
[35:18] beggar a panhandler whatever you call
[35:21] them and send you down to that person to
[35:24] tell them they're going to be healed
[35:27] this could go really bad for you you
[35:30] could come up with a thousand reasons of
[35:31] why you don't want to do this you could
[35:33] talk yourself out of it very easily to
[35:36] think what if this isn't right what if
[35:38] I'm doing it wrong what if this isn't
[35:40] what I'm supposed to say what if this is
[35:42] a wrong guy people are going to see me
[35:44] if this doesn't work this is
[35:46] embarrassing what if God isn't going to
[35:48] do it right now what if he's going to do
[35:49] it later there's a thousand things you
[35:51] could say but Peter walked right up to
[35:53] him with boldness and knew what he had
[35:55] to do and he did it and the man walked
[35:57] the man was healed in jesus' name he was
[36:01] healed you can think of the boldness it
[36:03] would take to do that how hard it would
[36:05] be for you to walk up to a random
[36:07] stranger and say that to them with such
[36:10] confidence that you know this is going
[36:11] to happen there's there's no getting
[36:14] around it verse 10 and they knew that it
[36:17] was he which sat in alms at the
[36:19] beautiful gate of the temple and they
[36:21] filled with wonder and amaz and they
[36:23] were filled with wonder and amazement
[36:25] that which had happened to him and as
[36:28] the lame man which was healed held Peter
[36:30] and John he healed held Peter and John
[36:33] all the people ran together unto them in
[36:35] the porch that is called Solomon's
[36:38] greatly
[36:40] wondering and when Peter saw it he
[36:42] answered unto the people ye men of
[36:45] Israel ye men of Israel why Marvel ye at
[36:48] this and why look ye so earnestly on us
[36:51] as though by our own power and Holiness
[36:53] we had made this man walk there
[36:56] marveling at what Peter did and Peter's
[36:59] telling them it has nothing to do with
[37:01] me I didn't do this Jesus did this I
[37:04] didn't do this the god of Abraham and of
[37:07] Isaac and of Jacob and the god of the
[37:09] fathers ha glorified his son Jesus whom
[37:11] ye delivered up and denied him in the
[37:13] presence of pilate when ye when he was
[37:17] determined to let him go they were going
[37:19] to let him go but you guys are the one
[37:21] that denied it but ye denied the Holy
[37:24] One and the just and desired a murderer
[37:27] be granted unto you the man that healed
[37:29] this man is the man you killed he's the
[37:32] man you gave up for a murderer so Peter
[37:35] Ken just starts calling everyone out
[37:38] he's not worried about
[37:40] it and killed the Prince of Life whom
[37:44] God hath raised from the dead whereof we
[37:46] Are
[37:48] Witnesses you've killed the Prince of
[37:50] death the you killed the Prince of Life
[37:52] and his name through faith in his name
[37:55] hath made his man man this man strong
[37:58] whom ye see and know ye the faith ye the
[38:03] faith yeah the faith which is by him
[38:06] hath given him his perfect soundness in
[38:08] presence of you all and now Brethren i w
[38:12] that
[38:13] thou ignorance you did this and did also
[38:17] your rulers in ignorance you killed
[38:20] Jesus so Peter starts to bring it back
[38:22] around but those things which God before
[38:25] had showed by the mouth of All His
[38:27] prophets that Christ should suffer he
[38:30] has so fulfilled repent ye therefore and
[38:33] be converted and your sins may be
[38:35] blotted out when the times of refreshing
[38:38] shall come from the presence of the Lord
[38:40] and He Shall send Jesus Christ which
[38:43] before was preached unto you he's given
[38:46] them a way out they know that you killed
[38:49] the Prince of Life but this is your way
[38:51] out repent onto the man that you
[38:54] killed and you will be forgiven
[38:57] so in Acts 3:2 24- 26 this in the
[39:01] Amplified indeed all prophets who have
[39:04] spoken from Samuel and those who came
[39:06] after him also announced these days so
[39:09] they knew it was coming you are the sons
[39:11] descendants of the prophets and HS of
[39:14] the Covenant which God made with your
[39:16] father saying to Abraham in your seed
[39:19] descendants all the families of the
[39:21] Earth shall be blessed it was for you
[39:24] first of all that God raised up his
[39:26] servant and son Jesus and sent him to
[39:29] bless you by turning everyone of you
[39:31] from your wicked ways so Peter's telling
[39:33] them they did this for you you are the
[39:36] first one that this was that Jesus was
[39:38] raised up for and then you killed
[39:41] him so Peter continues to call them out
[39:45] with this boldness Peter has this such
[39:47] boldness he can't be stopped he's just
[39:50] going to keep going along the lines of
[39:52] what God told him to
[39:53] do it's just absolute fear fear
[39:56] fearlessness to go through
[39:58] and listen to the Lord like Peter has in
[40:02] Acts
[40:03] 4 it says in verse one and as they spake
[40:07] unto people the priests and the captain
[40:09] of the temple and the Sadducees Came
[40:11] Upon them being grieved that they taught
[40:14] the people and preached through Jesus
[40:16] resurrection from dead from the dead and
[40:19] they laid hands on them and put them in
[40:21] hold onto the next day for it was now
[40:24] even tide so now Peter's called him out
[40:26] and it's not working out the same way
[40:28] he's getting arrested how be it many of
[40:30] them which heard the word believe word
[40:33] believed and the number of men was about
[40:36] 5,000 and it came to pass on the marrow
[40:38] that their rulers and elders and scribes
[40:41] and ananus and the high
[40:44] priests
[40:45] sephus and John and Alexander Caiaphas
[40:49] sorry and John and Alexander And as many
[40:51] as were of the kind Kindred of the high
[40:54] priest were gathered together at
[40:55] Jerusalem
[40:57] and they then and when they had set them
[41:00] in the midst they asked by what power or
[41:03] by what name have you done this then
[41:05] Peter filled with the Holy Ghost said
[41:07] unto them ye rulers of the people and
[41:09] Elders of Israel if we this day be
[41:12] examined of the good deed done to the
[41:14] important impotent Man by what means he
[41:17] is made whole be it known unto you all
[41:20] and to all the people of Israel that by
[41:23] the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth
[41:25] whom ye crucified
[41:26] whom God raised from the dead even by
[41:29] him do this man stand here before you
[41:31] whole as Peter just continues he just
[41:34] throws a crucifixion in there every time
[41:37] this is a stone which was said not of
[41:40] you Builders which has become the head
[41:42] of the corner neither is there salvation
[41:44] in any other for there is none other
[41:46] name under Heaven given among men
[41:49] whereby we must be
[41:51] saved so in Acts 4 do in verse 18- 21
[41:57] and they called them and commanded them
[41:59] not to speak at all nor to teach in the
[42:01] name of Jesus so as they're trying to
[42:04] get Peter to stop talking about this
[42:05] trying to get Peter and John to stop
[42:07] talking about this but Peter and John
[42:09] answered them and said unto them whether
[42:11] it be right in the sight of God to
[42:12] hearken unto you more than unto God
[42:16] judge ye for we cannot but speak the
[42:18] things which we have seen and heard we
[42:20] ain't stopping we're going to keep going
[42:23] so when they had further threatened them
[42:25] they let them go finding nothing how
[42:27] they might punish them because of the
[42:28] people for all the men glorified God for
[42:31] that which was done there was nothing
[42:34] they could do when the crowd agreed with
[42:37] Peter so Peter's boldness continues
[42:39] throughout the Book of Acts and he
[42:41] continues to be arrested and beaten for
[42:43] preaching the gospel and it's amazing
[42:46] what Peter does for the kingdom of God
[42:49] right and what he endures while doing it
[42:52] so but we know Peter's story and as you
[42:55] look at at it in all of these scriptures
[42:58] Peter is very bold he's very Fearless
[43:01] nothing can stop him he's going to do
[43:03] what the Lord has him to do nothing's
[43:05] going to stand in his way so if you
[43:08] stick with just this part of Peter and
[43:10] you don't see the whole story it makes
[43:13] it a whole lot easier to follow
[43:16] Peter he's going to be the guy that's
[43:18] going to show up he's going to be the
[43:19] guy that's going to help you through the
[43:21] hardest times he's going to be the guy
[43:24] that's right there in the fire with you
[43:25] with a smile on his face with this
[43:27] boldness he's going to just continue to
[43:29] show up for you he's going to be your
[43:31] hero he's going to be your night and
[43:32] shining
[43:33] armor he's going to be the guy with the
[43:35] answers to every question because as you
[43:39] keep in these scriptures he's done
[43:41] everything right he's just going to keep
[43:42] going he can't fail it looks like he
[43:44] just can't fail there's nothing he can
[43:46] do wrong he's so in tune with God it'
[43:49] blow your socks clean off if you had two
[43:51] pair of socks It Blow both pairs off
[43:53] it's how in tune it looks like he's in
[43:55] with God right now
[43:56] now but we don't have all the
[43:59] information and nowadays humans love
[44:02] information we have to have so much of
[44:05] it we have to have every single side we
[44:08] Google everything it's right at our
[44:11] fingertips it takes two seconds to
[44:14] figure out anything you could ever want
[44:17] so we can't handle not having the
[44:21] information I have to have the
[44:23] information to make an informed decision
[44:25] brother I have to have this stuff to
[44:27] make sure I'm doing everything right I
[44:30] have to know what's going on and
[44:33] sometimes you do sometimes you don't
[44:36] sometimes more information is helpful
[44:40] but what are you going to do if you
[44:42] don't have all the information are you
[44:44] going to keep moving or are you going to
[44:45] freeze up and stay right there and keep
[44:47] trying to find more information if the
[44:49] Lord's trying to get you to do something
[44:51] what are you going to do you only have
[44:53] partial what he wants you to do but you
[44:54] know part of it are you going to do that
[44:56] part or you just going to sit there and
[44:58] do nothing with it so and as I said in
[45:01] some in some instances more information
[45:04] is helpful and I know that so as a
[45:07] mechanic I have to figure out why things
[45:10] broke and it's helpful if you tell me
[45:13] what you
[45:14] did but it's programmed in humans that
[45:17] when you break something and a mechanic
[45:18] shows up tell them
[45:20] nothing because then they won't know
[45:23] it's you that broke it but you're
[45:25] sitting in the seat and it's broken so
[45:29] it was you that's it it's that easy
[45:32] you're the one that broke it but they
[45:34] will deny till they die they will never
[45:37] never tell you what's going on I went to
[45:39] a combine one time and it broke a belt
[45:42] so I didn't think anything of it I just
[45:43] started doing it and started getting the
[45:47] belt out of it because the belts wrap up
[45:48] and everything and so I start cutting
[45:50] the belt out of it getting everything
[45:52] apart and talking to the guy say you
[45:54] know what happened he's like I don't
[45:55] know I know it's a weirdest thing never
[45:57] broke this belt before it just broke
[45:59] have no idea what happened ain't got a
[46:00] clue like okay I didn't think anything
[46:03] of it so I got everything apart and I
[46:06] was trying to move the combine the
[46:08] internals of the combine by hand and it
[46:11] wouldn't move I'm a big boy and it does
[46:13] take a lot but I can usually get in
[46:15] budge and it would not move so couldn't
[46:17] figure it out like guess is weird and
[46:20] again I didn't pay attention because I
[46:21] was just focused on this one key area of
[46:23] what I was doing and I kept asking them
[46:25] did something happen nothing happened I
[46:28] have no idea it's the weirdest thing
[46:30] must be a faulty belt no idea what
[46:32] happened it's weird okay so I get the
[46:35] belt back on I'm like man we need to
[46:36] like look through this thing and figure
[46:37] out something's stuck in it so I get the
[46:40] belt on it can't get a move walk around
[46:42] the front of the combine there is an
[46:43] entire tree sticking out of the front of
[46:45] the
[46:46] combine it's that big around and this
[46:49] the whole bushy leaves part is sticking
[46:51] out of the front of the
[46:53] combine and I said do you think that has
[46:55] anything to do with a tree and he was as
[46:58] surprised as I was when we seen the tree
[47:01] and he looked at it and thought where
[47:03] did that come from the forest is where
[47:07] that came from it can't go in the
[47:09] combine that's why the belt broke so he
[47:13] acted like no idea it's the weirdest
[47:15] thing ever no idea where I picked up a
[47:16] tree at I don't know how you missed that
[47:18] tree so I yanked the tree out with my
[47:21] truck and I said we got to fire this
[47:23] thing up but there's still parts of the
[47:24] tree and in the combine I said so if it
[47:26] starts making a bunch of noises just
[47:28] shut the machine down we had to dig it
[47:30] out and he's an older guy and older guys
[47:32] are really stuck in their ways so he was
[47:35] like I got it I said don't idle the
[47:37] machine up whatever you do don't rev the
[47:38] machine up he says yep so he turns it on
[47:42] and it just starts hammering hammering
[47:44] hammering I'm waving stop and he looks
[47:47] down at me and smiles and revs up as
[47:50] fast as it'll go and it just starts
[47:53] destroying this tree inside the machine
[47:54] throws out chunks a tree everywhere and
[47:57] so I ran around I said hey I told you to
[47:59] stop why don't you stop like I asked you
[48:00] to stop that's going to tear the machine
[48:02] all up and he said this isn't the first
[48:04] time I ran a tree through this machine I
[48:06] knew it' chew it
[48:07] up so he knew the entire time that he
[48:11] had a tree stuck in that machine he just
[48:13] didn't want to tell me that information
[48:15] he just let me figure it out on my own
[48:18] so another story my
[48:20] grandparents my grandpa really doesn't
[48:22] like to tell both my grandpas never
[48:24] really like to tell you the whole story
[48:26] they'll tell you half of what you need
[48:27] to know so I was 11year old chubby me
[48:31] riding my bike over my grandpa's house
[48:33] we had a bill hay so my grandpa had this
[48:35] thing where he'd bail all the hay and
[48:37] lay it in the field so there's little
[48:39] round bails everywhere and he puts me on
[48:42] the tractor and he's riding on the side
[48:44] of it and he said put it in low gear and
[48:46] jump off the tractor and run around and
[48:49] throw all the bails up on the wagon and
[48:51] when you get to the end steer it around
[48:53] so you don't hit the woods I'm like okay
[48:56] that sounds kind of cool but what
[48:58] happens if I fall off and get ran over
[49:00] by the tractor and he looks at me very
[49:03] serious and says
[49:05] don't okay so hypothetically let's say
[49:09] there's an emergency what do you want me
[49:10] to do and he said don't have an
[49:14] emergency okay so I learned not to get
[49:17] run over by a tractor really
[49:19] fast just
[49:21] don't my other grandpa who also didn't
[49:24] like to tell me everything I needed
[49:25] didn't
[49:26] know needed me to help him drive
[49:28] somebody when I was 13 years old so we
[49:32] start driving cross country and he says
[49:35] get up here get in the seat and he airs
[49:36] up my seat because I'm too short and it
[49:38] looks like a little kid's driving
[49:39] somebody because little kid's driving
[49:41] somebody that's why it look like that so
[49:44] he said just steer it keep it between
[49:45] the lines don't pass nobody don't do
[49:47] anything and I said well I can't really
[49:49] reach the foot pedals because my air the
[49:51] seat so aired up so high and he said
[49:53] that's what cruise control is for and he
[49:55] turned turn the cruise control on so I'm
[49:57] like Grandpa hypothetically let's say
[49:59] there's an accident and I need to stop
[50:02] and he said
[50:04] don't
[50:06] okay so let's say there's an accident
[50:09] that I can't prevent what do I do and he
[50:12] said wake me up before you hit
[50:15] anybody okay that's good I got it don't
[50:19] hit anybody wake you up really
[50:21] fast so we continue on we get to where
[50:25] we're going and we have these they're
[50:28] like tasers for cows to get them in the
[50:30] trailer so there's a 1200lb bull up on
[50:32] the top side of the trailer and this
[50:34] little cubby and you're in a stall as
[50:36] wide as those
[50:37] chairs and so he gives me his hot shot
[50:40] and he says go up there and get that
[50:41] bull and I said what happens if he comes
[50:44] at me and he said he'll kill you okay so
[50:47] how do I prevent the action where he
[50:49] hits me and kills me and he said don't
[50:51] get run
[50:52] over okay I feel like the information
[50:55] there there is lacking of how to not get
[50:57] ran over cuz I don't really want to get
[51:00] ran over but that's all I got and the
[51:03] reason I had to ride with him at this
[51:05] time was because he got run over by a
[51:07] bull the week
[51:08] before so more information this
[51:11] sometimes very very helpful I get that I
[51:14] never got ran over by a bull though I
[51:17] learned really fast don't do that I
[51:20] don't know how I learned it I just came
[51:21] up with something so sometimes you do
[51:24] need more information this very helpful
[51:25] in certain
[51:27] situations but when does too much
[51:29] information hurt
[51:31] us right now the way you look at Peter
[51:34] you're willing to follow Peter right now
[51:37] you can see Peter as doing nothing wrong
[51:39] he's very bold very Fearless he's a man
[51:42] of God he's proven it you can't deny it
[51:46] by his actions but if you go back a
[51:49] book and look at what happens and see
[51:52] The Human Side of
[51:54] Peter then what will you do so in John
[51:58] 13:
[51:59] 34-38 a new commandment I give unto you
[52:03] that ye love one another as I have loved
[52:05] you that ye also
[52:09] love as I have loved you that ye also
[52:12] love one another but this shall all men
[52:14] know that ye are disciples if ye have
[52:17] love one to another Simon Peter said
[52:20] unto him Lord whether goest thou Jesus
[52:23] answered him whether I go thou C come
[52:27] follow me can can not follow me now but
[52:31] Thou shalt follow me
[52:32] afterwards Peter said unto him Lord why
[52:35] can I follow you these these now follow
[52:38] thee now I will lay down my life for
[52:40] thee for thy sake Peter's telling him
[52:43] I'll kill myself for you I'll do
[52:44] whatever it takes I need to follow you
[52:46] no matter what Jesus answered him will
[52:49] thou lay down thy life for my sake will
[52:52] you actually do it say verily verily I
[52:54] say un to thee the shall not Crow
[52:57] till thou has denied me
[53:00] Thrice so as you see the Bold Peter now
[53:03] he's going to deny Jesus there's no way
[53:05] he denies Jesus he loves Jesus so much
[53:08] he's willing to do whatever it takes
[53:09] he's willing to lay his die life down
[53:11] for Jesus do anything for Jesus and
[53:14] Jesus says before the crows you'll
[53:15] deny me three
[53:17] times is this the same Peter that was
[53:19] arrested and
[53:20] beaten and imprisoned for preaching the
[53:23] Gospel of Jesus there's no way that
[53:26] Peter that Peter would deny Jesus but in
[53:29] John 18 10-12 veres 10-12 then Simon
[53:33] Peter having a sword drew it and smokee
[53:35] the high priest's servant and cut off
[53:37] his right
[53:39] ear the servant's name was
[53:43] malus then said Jesus unto Peter put up
[53:45] thy sword into the sheath the cup which
[53:48] my father ha given me shall I not drink
[53:51] it then the band then the band in the
[53:54] cap aptain and officers of the Jews took
[53:57] Jesus and bound him so Jesus is saying
[53:59] what are you doing this is the plan this
[54:02] is my plan all along and now you're
[54:04] standing in the way of it so why does
[54:06] Peter start standing in the way of God
[54:08] Peter's getting nervous Peter's cutting
[54:11] off people's ears he's starting to freak
[54:13] out because he's losing control of these
[54:16] situations Peter has a plan in his head
[54:19] of how this is supposed to go and Jesus
[54:23] dying this is not how he wants it to go
[54:26] Peter's with Jesus he's all about it but
[54:29] once Jesus is gone what does Peter have
[54:31] that's how Peter sees it he's losing
[54:33] control of the situation so
[54:36] now this bold Peter now you're seeing
[54:40] where he came
[54:42] from somebody that you would think would
[54:44] never deny Christ somebody who stands in
[54:46] front of thousands of people and boldly
[54:49] proclaims that you killed Jesus and
[54:51] holds it against all these people for
[54:53] them to repent of their sins so they can
[54:54] be be saved this same Peter just verses
[54:58] later in John 18: 15-
[55:02] 27 and Simon Peter followed Jesus and so
[55:05] did another disciple that disciple was
[55:08] known unto the high priest and went in
[55:10] with Jesus into the Palace of the high
[55:13] priest that was yeah John 18: 15- 27 but
[55:18] Peter stood at the door
[55:20] without then then went out that other
[55:24] disciple which was unto the high priest
[55:26] and spake unto her that kept the door
[55:28] and brought in
[55:30] Peter then saith the damsel that kept
[55:32] the door onto Peter art not thou also
[55:35] one of the men's disciples he saith I'm
[55:38] not not me and the servants and officers
[55:41] stood there who had made a fire of coals
[55:44] for it was gold cold and they warmed
[55:46] themselves and Peter stood with them and
[55:48] warmed
[55:49] himself and the high priest then asked
[55:51] Jesus of his disciples then the high
[55:54] priest then asked Jesus of his disciples
[55:56] and of and Jesus answered him of his
[55:59] Doctrine and Jesus answered him and
[56:01] spake openly to the world I ever taught
[56:04] in the synagogues and in the temple with
[56:07] the Jews always Resort and in secret
[56:10] have I said
[56:12] nothing why ask thou me ask them which
[56:15] heard me what I have said unto them
[56:18] behold they know what I
[56:20] said and when he had thus spoken one of
[56:23] the officers which stood by
[56:25] struck Jesus with the palm of his hand
[56:27] saying answerest thou the high priest
[56:30] so Jesus answered him if I have spoken
[56:33] evil bear witness of the evil but if but
[56:37] if well why Smit us thou
[56:40] me then annus had sent him bound unto
[56:45] sephus kyus the high
[56:49] priest and Simon Peter stood war and
[56:52] warmed himself they said therefore unto
[56:54] our th art not thou also one of the
[56:56] disciples he denied and said I am
[56:59] not one of the Servants of the high
[57:01] priest being his Kinsman whose ear Peter
[57:04] cut off sayith did not I see thee in the
[57:07] garden with him so I seen you chop this
[57:10] dude's ear off in the garden are you
[57:12] sure that wasn't
[57:13] you no was not me Peter denied again and
[57:18] immediately the cop crew
[57:23] Crow
[57:27] so is this the same
[57:29] Peter this is the same bold
[57:32] Peter that wouldn't deny Jesus so in
[57:35] Luke it says that Jesus looked at Peter
[57:37] after he denied him the last time Jesus
[57:39] saw him and Peter knew what he had just
[57:41] done Peter knew that he went from flying
[57:44] high with Jesus to all of a sudden
[57:46] denying everything that he said that he
[57:48] was for all this boldness everything
[57:51] that you see him later on everything is
[57:53] gone he denies Jesus while Jesus is
[57:56] looking at
[57:59] him
[58:00] so is this the same Peter so you can say
[58:04] well he doesn't have the same he doesn't
[58:05] have the Holy Ghost yet so okay that's
[58:08] fair enough acts 10 verses 12- 15
[58:12] wherein were all manner of four-footed
[58:15] beasts of the earth and wild beasts and
[58:17] the creeping things and Falls of the air
[58:20] and there came a voice to him rise Peter
[58:23] kill and eat but Peter said not so Lord
[58:26] for I have never eaten anything that is
[58:28] common or
[58:30] unclean and the voice spake unto him
[58:32] again the second time what God hath
[58:34] cleansed that call not thou
[58:38] common and this was done Thrice and the
[58:41] vessel was received up again into
[58:46] heaven so watch Peter as he right away
[58:49] he has something to say right away he
[58:51] says no way not doing it I've never
[58:54] never eaten anything unclean instead of
[58:56] going on with What the Lord Has to tell
[58:58] him he instantly says nope I've never
[59:00] eaten unclean and the Lord says don't
[59:02] call this
[59:04] unclean so Peter instantly has
[59:06] commentary and then in verse 25 and as
[59:09] Peter was coming
[59:12] in cornelus met him and fell at his feet
[59:15] and worshiped
[59:17] him but Peter took him up saying stand
[59:19] up I myself also am a
[59:21] man and as he talked with him he went in
[59:24] and found many that were come come
[59:28] together and he said unto them ye know
[59:31] how that is that it is an unlawful thing
[59:34] for a man that is a Jew to keep company
[59:36] or come onto one of another Nation but
[59:39] God has showed me that I should not call
[59:41] any man common or
[59:43] unclean therefore came I unto you
[59:47] without gain saying as soon as I was
[59:49] sent for I asked therefore what intent
[59:52] ye have sent for me and cornelus said
[59:55] four days ago I was fasting until this
[59:56] hour and at the ninth hour I prayed in
[59:59] my house and behold a man stood Before
[1:00:01] Me In Bright clothing and said
[1:00:03] Cornelius thy prayers is heard and thy
[1:00:05] alms are had in remembrance in the sight
[1:00:09] of God send therefore to japa and call
[1:00:14] Heather Simon the surname is Peter he is
[1:00:17] lodged in the house of one Simon a
[1:00:19] Tanner by the seaside who when he cometh
[1:00:22] shall speak unto thee immediately
[1:00:24] therefore I sent to thee and thou Hast
[1:00:27] well done that thou art come now
[1:00:29] therefore are we all here present before
[1:00:32] God to hear all things that are common
[1:00:34] thee of God commanded thee of God and
[1:00:38] Peter opened his mouth and said of a
[1:00:39] truth I perceive that God is no
[1:00:41] respector of persons so it's when God
[1:00:43] starts to bring everything to the
[1:00:44] Gentiles he's using Peter to do it Peter
[1:00:48] Peter obeys and goes to corus's house
[1:00:51] which he knows is going to get him in
[1:00:52] trouble and Peter gets a revelation
[1:00:54] right there in verse 34 he realizes this
[1:00:56] is for everyone this isn't just for a
[1:00:58] certain group of people Jesus wants us
[1:01:01] to go to everyone so in verse 35 says
[1:01:04] but in every nation he that fearth him
[1:01:06] and worketh righteous is accepted with
[1:01:08] him the word which God sent on the
[1:01:10] children of Israel preaching Peace by
[1:01:12] Jesus Christ he is the Lord of
[1:01:17] all so Peter has this Revelation that
[1:01:20] the message of Jesus is for everyone
[1:01:22] like I said it's not hidden away for
[1:01:24] special person that's not hidden way
[1:01:25] just for the Jews the Lord opens this
[1:01:27] door up to everyone and he uses Peter to
[1:01:31] do it and I do like Cornelius here just
[1:01:34] as a side note this Cornelius is never
[1:01:36] mentioned again it's brought through
[1:01:38] Cornelius and he's never mentioned again
[1:01:40] in the Bible but he's used so profoundly
[1:01:44] to get everything
[1:01:46] started so we can never underestimate
[1:01:48] what God is
[1:01:50] doing so Peter boldly does all this
[1:01:54] Peter's he he goes to this house he does
[1:01:57] everything he's not supposed to do he's
[1:01:58] going to get himself in trouble but he
[1:02:00] does it because he realizes the Lord
[1:02:01] does not respect your persons but then
[1:02:04] in Galatians
[1:02:06] 2 but when Peter was come to Enoch
[1:02:08] Galatians 2:1 but when Peter was come to
[1:02:11] Antioch I withstood him to the face
[1:02:13] because he was to be blamed so Paul is
[1:02:15] calling Peter out for before that
[1:02:18] certain came that certain came from
[1:02:22] James he did eat with g Gentiles but
[1:02:25] when they were come he withdrew and
[1:02:27] separated himself fearing them which
[1:02:29] were of the circumcision and the other
[1:02:31] Jews disassembled likewise with him in
[1:02:34] so much that Barnabas also was carried
[1:02:37] away with a dis
[1:02:40] dissimulation but when I saw that they
[1:02:42] walked not uprightly according to the
[1:02:44] truth of the Gospel I said unto Peter
[1:02:47] before them all if thou being a Jew
[1:02:50] livest after the manner of Gentiles and
[1:02:52] not as do the Jews
[1:02:55] Why compell Us thou Gentiles to live as
[1:02:57] do the
[1:03:00] Jews so Paul's calling Peter out just
[1:03:04] like Peter called out everyone else
[1:03:06] later on in life Peter gets called out
[1:03:08] because he boldly comes says he's
[1:03:11] calling people out he's going to tell
[1:03:13] them that they're the ones that
[1:03:14] crucified Christ they're the ones that
[1:03:16] did all these bad things he's going to
[1:03:19] go to
[1:03:20] Cornelius and start to spread the
[1:03:22] message of Jesus to all the Gentiles but
[1:03:25] then the second pressure gets put on
[1:03:27] Peter he melts and he folds in front of
[1:03:30] all these people CU he's afraid because
[1:03:33] Peter starts to lose
[1:03:34] control and he's afraid of what can
[1:03:36] happen he loses focus on what he's
[1:03:38] supposed to be
[1:03:39] doing so this is the same Peter this is
[1:03:43] the same Peter that walked with Jesus
[1:03:44] and watched all the Miracles and then
[1:03:46] denied Jesus this is the same Peter that
[1:03:49] learned from that mistake and boldly
[1:03:51] proclaimed Jesus and was beaten for it
[1:03:53] and imprisoned for it
[1:03:55] and then even in with the Holy Ghost
[1:03:57] full of the Holy Ghost once he put
[1:03:59] pressure on him he melted and he fell
[1:04:01] apart and denied it and he even started
[1:04:03] to bring other people along with him in
[1:04:06] these false things and Paul had to come
[1:04:08] and straighten him out and that's
[1:04:13] Peter so that's a full picture of Peter
[1:04:17] so
[1:04:19] when my computer used to work better but
[1:04:22] my wife kind of broke it so so I just
[1:04:24] want to throw that part in there in John
[1:04:28] 21:
[1:04:30] 15-19 so when they had Deni dying Jesus
[1:04:33] said unto Simon Peter Simon son of Jonas
[1:04:36] lovest thou
[1:04:37] me more than these he saith unto
[1:04:42] him yay Lord thou knowest that I love
[1:04:45] thee he saith unto him feed my
[1:04:47] Lambs verse 16 and he saith unto him
[1:04:50] again the second time Simon Peter son of
[1:04:52] Jonas lovest thou me he he saith unto
[1:04:54] him y Lord thou knowest that I love thee
[1:04:57] he saith unto him feed my sheep and he
[1:05:00] saith unto him the third time Simon son
[1:05:02] of Jonas lovest thou me Peter was
[1:05:05] grieved because he had said unto him
[1:05:07] third time lovest thou me and he said
[1:05:10] unto him Lord thou knowest I love thee
[1:05:13] all things thou knowest that I love thee
[1:05:16] Jesus said unto him feed my
[1:05:20] sheep so verily verily he says verily
[1:05:23] verily I say
[1:05:24] thee when thou was young thou Gest
[1:05:28] thyself and walst wherever thou wouldest
[1:05:31] but when thou shalt be old Thou shalt
[1:05:33] stretch forth thy hands and another
[1:05:35] shall G thee and carry thee wherever
[1:05:39] thou wouldest not verse 19 this spake he
[1:05:42] signifying by what death he should
[1:05:44] glorify God and when he had spoken this
[1:05:47] he saith unto him follow
[1:05:51] me so watch what what Peter says in the
[1:05:55] very next
[1:05:56] verse then Peter turned about seeing the
[1:06:00] disciple who Jesus loved following which
[1:06:02] also leaned on his breast at supper and
[1:06:04] said Lord which is he that betrayeth
[1:06:07] thee Peter seeing him say to Jesus Lord
[1:06:10] what shall this man do Jesus saith unto
[1:06:13] him if I will that he T till I come what
[1:06:16] is that to thee follow thou me so Peter
[1:06:19] instantly it's like what about that guy
[1:06:22] I know what you just said I was supposed
[1:06:23] to do
[1:06:24] but what about that guy and Jesus says
[1:06:27] don't worry about
[1:06:28] it and the disciples come to an instant
[1:06:31] conclusion as well in verse 23 then when
[1:06:35] this saying abroad among the Brethren
[1:06:38] that the disciples should not die yet
[1:06:41] Jesus said unto him he shall not die but
[1:06:44] if I
[1:06:45] will he T till I come what is that to
[1:06:48] thee so they instantly think okay this
[1:06:50] guy's never going to die that's what
[1:06:52] he's come up with theyve completely
[1:06:54] missed Jesus's
[1:06:55] point so we've read a lot of scriptures
[1:06:58] about Peter we've learned about Peter's
[1:07:00] life so what is the point the point is
[1:07:03] Peter's life is a
[1:07:04] mess and Peter keeps trying to control
[1:07:07] different parts of his life because he
[1:07:10] doesn't like the mess he's trying to do
[1:07:13] whatever he can to regain some kinde of
[1:07:15] control in his mess of a life and our
[1:07:19] lives are the same way our lives are a
[1:07:21] mess and we continually try to just grab
[1:07:24] have control of whatever we can grasp in
[1:07:27] our lives or even in someone else's life
[1:07:29] to try to control a little bit of it
[1:07:31] because we think we can do better but
[1:07:34] the problem is we can't be distracted by
[1:07:35] the mess we can't try to control the
[1:07:39] mess we have to let go of the control
[1:07:41] because Jesus as he told Peter you're
[1:07:43] going to have no control you're going to
[1:07:45] have no control over this God has it
[1:07:48] handled God knows every step God knows
[1:07:50] every corner God created the corners
[1:07:52] he's not worried about it we're the ones
[1:07:54] that are worried about
[1:07:56] it so why wouldn't he just tell Peter
[1:07:59] right off how he's going to die why
[1:08:01] wouldn't he just tell Peter the whole
[1:08:02] story and let him know what's about to
[1:08:03] come instead of talking to him in
[1:08:05] Parables and talking around it so if you
[1:08:08] can imagine humans can't handle it if
[1:08:11] humans knew what was going to happen we
[1:08:13] could do better we always like to think
[1:08:15] we can do better whether we want to
[1:08:16] admit that or not humans love to think
[1:08:19] that we can do better than God like Lord
[1:08:21] if you just tell me your plan I've got
[1:08:23] this watch what I can do no we'll make a
[1:08:26] mess of it so if he told
[1:08:28] Peter Peter buckle up it's going to be a
[1:08:31] rough road you're going to be arrested
[1:08:33] you're going to be beaten you're going
[1:08:34] to be imprisoned you're going to be
[1:08:36] chased out of places you're going to
[1:08:38] lose everything you have you're going to
[1:08:39] be beaten again you're going to be
[1:08:41] imprisoned again you're going to lose
[1:08:42] everything you have again you're going
[1:08:44] to lose all of your friends you're going
[1:08:46] to be called out in front of everyone
[1:08:47] because you've denied God you're going
[1:08:50] to be called out in front of everyone
[1:08:51] because you've gotten away from what
[1:08:53] you're supposed to be teaching and you
[1:08:54] started leading people astray and you're
[1:08:56] going to be embarrassed in front of
[1:08:57] everyone because you're going to be
[1:08:59] called out because of the things that
[1:09:00] you've
[1:09:01] done so and God will continue with them
[1:09:05] and you will continue to make mistakes
[1:09:06] until the very end you continue to do
[1:09:09] these things you continue to get things
[1:09:10] wrong Peter in your life and in the very
[1:09:13] end of your life people will force you
[1:09:15] to go to places you don't want to go and
[1:09:17] at the very end you'll be brutally
[1:09:19] executed for living This Life of Christ
[1:09:23] if he told Peter that Peter run in the
[1:09:25] other direction anybody would run in the
[1:09:28] other direction or we would try to take
[1:09:30] control of that situation and think that
[1:09:33] we know things are coming and we can do
[1:09:35] better like God didn't see what was
[1:09:38] coming God already knew what was coming
[1:09:40] he's well aware of it he created the
[1:09:42] situation that is coming for
[1:09:45] you we could never do it better than God
[1:09:49] but we think we can we think we can do
[1:09:51] it better with other people we think we
[1:09:53] can do it better with
[1:09:55] ourselves and we just keep trying to do
[1:09:58] it so why would we want to keep trying
[1:10:02] to control our situation we want to try
[1:10:06] to maintain some kind of what we think
[1:10:09] is control we want to at some point have
[1:10:13] a say in something that we do we want at
[1:10:15] some point to say well that was my good
[1:10:18] idea but we have no control over this
[1:10:22] the faster we lose the control the
[1:10:24] faster God can come in and help us we
[1:10:26] want God to help us but we don't want
[1:10:28] God to help us in his way we want to
[1:10:30] have the control and say well this is
[1:10:32] how it probably should go we should do
[1:10:34] this this and this we want to look like
[1:10:36] our Western culture has told us that it
[1:10:38] should be we shouldn't have a mess we
[1:10:40] shouldn't have anything going on we
[1:10:41] should everything together if you got a
[1:10:43] problem deal with it in in private don't
[1:10:45] let anybody see it make it look nice
[1:10:47] don't fall apart everything is great
[1:10:50] everything's fine we're not going to
[1:10:51] talk about it even though the Bible
[1:10:53] could tells us to confess thought faults
[1:10:54] one to another we ain't doing that we
[1:10:57] ain't doing anything like that we're
[1:10:59] going to let the devil have our heads
[1:11:00] and continue to stay right inside that
[1:11:03] and we're not going to move because we
[1:11:05] continue to tell ourselves we've got
[1:11:07] this handled we've got it under control
[1:11:09] we have nothing under
[1:11:11] control we like to sing songs like can
[1:11:14] you bring up I think it's called refiner
[1:11:16] is that the song purified can you bring
[1:11:18] that lyrics up so we like to sing these
[1:11:22] songs but then I don't know that we
[1:11:24] really think about what it
[1:11:27] says so it says I want to be Tried by
[1:11:30] fire purified so Kenny and Gideon come
[1:11:35] sing this and play will you real quick
[1:11:38] so that way you get the full effect of
[1:11:39] what the song does it says I want to be
[1:11:41] Tried by fire purified take whatever you
[1:11:44] desire Lord here's my life I want to be
[1:11:47] Tried by fire and
[1:11:50] purified these guys do a lot better job
[1:12:01] [Music]
[1:12:13] I to
[1:12:17] [Music]
[1:12:21] be so we want to be by fire we want to
[1:12:25] be
[1:12:27] purified and it sounds so perfect you
[1:12:29] can keep singing the whole
[1:12:32] song
[1:12:33] [Music]
[1:12:38] yeah whatever it takes take me
[1:12:47] there you offer your life up to
[1:12:52] God I'll be a Living
[1:12:59] [Music]
[1:13:02] Sacrifice I want to be consumed consum
[1:13:06] by the fire I want to be Tri by
[1:13:12] fire
[1:13:15] purified you take whatever you
[1:13:20] desire Lord's my
[1:13:25] so you thank you guys so you say you
[1:13:27] want to be Tried by fire purified take
[1:13:30] whatever whatever it takes my life is a
[1:13:32] Living Sacrifice and your fire the
[1:13:35] refiner but the second the fire starts
[1:13:39] we don't want to do it anymore we're
[1:13:41] good we don't want to be purified we
[1:13:44] don't want the refiner we're good we
[1:13:47] don't need any of that because we don't
[1:13:49] like the way that it looks it sounds
[1:13:51] amazing in that song that's song sounds
[1:13:54] good Gideon sings it well Kenny plays it
[1:13:56] well it sounds really good and you just
[1:13:59] you can't help but worship it Lord I
[1:14:01] want to be refined I want to be Tried by
[1:14:03] fire fire hurts really bad really bad
[1:14:07] and once the fire starts we want nothing
[1:14:09] to do with it and if the fire starts for
[1:14:11] somebody else we want to think their
[1:14:14] life is falling apart everything's
[1:14:16] coming to Pieces Devil's attacking them
[1:14:18] that might be the Lord It's the Lord
[1:14:21] that allows that to happen but we want
[1:14:23] blame the devil for it every time but we
[1:14:25] want to be refined we just want to blame
[1:14:27] the devil for it instead of giving God
[1:14:28] the credit he's trying to change you
[1:14:30] into something that he needs you to be
[1:14:32] we don't like it that way at all though
[1:14:34] we want to blame it on the bad guy
[1:14:36] because there's bad people no it's the
[1:14:38] Lord trying to get you into position
[1:14:40] that he need you to be the refining fire
[1:14:43] hurts but it's worth it when you get to
[1:14:45] that
[1:14:46] point do have that quote from he cares
[1:14:49] do you
[1:14:51] care so in 63 brother R says and I hope
[1:14:54] that each of you get that especially you
[1:14:56] people that is to be paid for that's so
[1:14:59] uncomfortable this
[1:15:01] morning with many troubles that doctors
[1:15:03] cannot touch and we believe that doctors
[1:15:06] help people I believe that God heals by
[1:15:08] medicine God heals by surgery God heals
[1:15:11] by understanding God heals by love just
[1:15:14] a little love goes a long way let
[1:15:17] somebody be all upset and just show them
[1:15:19] you care for them
[1:15:22] see
[1:15:24] God heals by love God heals by prayer
[1:15:26] God heals by Miracles God heals by his
[1:15:29] word God heals whatever Source it is God
[1:15:32] heals by it it's God that's healing for
[1:15:35] he said I am the Lord that Health all
[1:15:37] these diseases so all of it should work
[1:15:40] together and men in different Ministries
[1:15:42] should work together for that see so God
[1:15:45] does the healing God is the one that
[1:15:48] does the Miracles whatever Source the
[1:15:50] person gets help from it's God's the one
[1:15:52] that's doing the healing a little bit of
[1:15:54] love goes a long way we want to perform
[1:15:56] all these Grand things and do these big
[1:15:59] marvelous acts for people and show up
[1:16:02] for people and give them money and do
[1:16:05] anything we can to help them when we're
[1:16:06] always trying to talk them into
[1:16:08] something trying to get them to do this
[1:16:09] this is going to help that's going to
[1:16:10] help have you ever tried to love them a
[1:16:12] little bit have you ever tried to
[1:16:14] compliment somebody at all we we want to
[1:16:17] love we want to move Heaven and Earth
[1:16:19] and you can't tell anybody they look
[1:16:21] nice because you're worried that they
[1:16:22] might think think something of you you
[1:16:24] can't encourage anybody with just a
[1:16:26] little thing but we want to move Heaven
[1:16:28] and Earth we're not even close to moving
[1:16:29] Heaven and Earth we can't love each
[1:16:30] other just a little bit just a little
[1:16:32] bit of love all the ministry should work
[1:16:35] together for this right we should all be
[1:16:38] working for this a little bit of love
[1:16:39] it's love that does the work we don't do
[1:16:41] this work God does the work God's the
[1:16:44] one that does the healing we can't fix
[1:16:47] anybody we'd like to think that we can
[1:16:49] but there's no one we can fix we can't
[1:16:51] fix ourselves we can't do
[1:16:54] anything we can't just love people right
[1:16:56] where they are we have to get people
[1:16:59] into a lovable spot we have to get
[1:17:01] ourselves into a lovable spot and we
[1:17:03] don't like to say that we should love
[1:17:05] ourselves because the world's perverted
[1:17:06] that the world's perverted that for a
[1:17:08] reason because you have to be
[1:17:10] comfortable with who you are if you
[1:17:11] don't possess what you other people need
[1:17:14] you can't give it to them you don't have
[1:17:16] it if you don't have the peace and you
[1:17:18] don't have the love nothing's going to
[1:17:21] happen if you don't get to where you
[1:17:23] want them to be nothing's going to
[1:17:25] happen you have nothing to give them
[1:17:27] you're going to show up and he's going
[1:17:29] to say Paul I know and Jesus I know but
[1:17:31] who are you I don't know who you are and
[1:17:33] you're not going to like what happens in
[1:17:35] that situation because you have no love
[1:17:37] to give because you don't have it for
[1:17:38] yourself so as the world continually
[1:17:41] perverts this love it's doing it on
[1:17:44] purpose so you don't realize that love
[1:17:46] is everything without it nothing else
[1:17:50] matters nothing you can't earn anything
[1:17:54] you can't fix people you can't earn
[1:17:56] people's to fix their situations you
[1:17:59] can't do anything with that so I'm going
[1:18:02] to pick on Gideon you can pick on me
[1:18:03] next time so you're going to walk the
[1:18:06] Walk of Life just walk from there to
[1:18:08] there just keep walking back and forth
[1:18:09] for me so Gideon's walking his Walk of
[1:18:12] Life and he's walking along and he falls
[1:18:15] off you don't have to fall just keep
[1:18:17] walking so he's walking he's doing fine
[1:18:20] and his life starts to fall apart he he
[1:18:23] loses his job he's getting really
[1:18:24] depressed he doesn't know what to do and
[1:18:28] now he's starting to get into things
[1:18:30] that he shouldn't get into so you want
[1:18:31] to help him so badly and I want to keep
[1:18:33] talking to him because I've done the
[1:18:35] drugs I've done the drinking I've done
[1:18:37] the bad things that you can do so I want
[1:18:39] to tell him man it's time to stop you've
[1:18:41] got to stop all this stuff you can't
[1:18:43] keep walking this life you cannot do
[1:18:46] this this is what I did this is how it
[1:18:48] worked for me you need to stop I can
[1:18:51] help you if you just stop I can help you
[1:18:53] you got to do this this and this this is
[1:18:55] a 12-step program that worked for me if
[1:18:57] you would just do this it would stop I
[1:18:59] know exactly how to help you if you
[1:19:01] would stop right now I can show you
[1:19:04] everything I know to to help you get off
[1:19:06] this track your life is falling apart
[1:19:09] you're in shambles I know you're
[1:19:11] extremely depressed I know you want to
[1:19:12] take your life if you would just listen
[1:19:14] to me I could help you but you won't
[1:19:17] stop and he's going to continue to walk
[1:19:20] this path because you want to help them
[1:19:23] in your control in your way because you
[1:19:26] don't like the mess of his life because
[1:19:28] you don't like the way that it looks and
[1:19:30] he's going to keep walking because he's
[1:19:32] not going to listen to you he's going to
[1:19:34] be stuck in what he's doing and you go
[1:19:36] through all these things and you think
[1:19:38] that's exactly what he's going through I
[1:19:40] can help him but I talk to him and
[1:19:42] nothing happens he just keeps walking
[1:19:44] God put you in that situation so you can
[1:19:47] pray for that person so God can show up
[1:19:50] for that person so you know specific
[1:19:52] ways to pray pray that's why never
[1:19:54] underestimate your prayer you are put in
[1:19:56] that situation for a specific reason
[1:19:59] that's why you know what you know so you
[1:20:01] can pray for that person specifically
[1:20:03] you know exactly what they're going
[1:20:04] through with depression with the things
[1:20:06] that they can struggle with so finally
[1:20:07] God can show them God can show up and
[1:20:09] say it's time to stop this is where it
[1:20:12] stops because God shows him this is
[1:20:15] where it stops his life is a wreck you
[1:20:17] sit down thank you buddy his life is a
[1:20:20] wreck and we tried so hard hard to get
[1:20:23] him to stop doing it and he would stop
[1:20:25] doing it because you are not in control
[1:20:28] you are not in control of your life
[1:20:30] you're not in control of other people's
[1:20:32] lives God is in control of those lives
[1:20:35] he set you in those situations that
[1:20:37] you're trying to fix so much so you can
[1:20:41] pray for those situations and if God
[1:20:44] tells you to move then move but you
[1:20:47] ignore the moves because they're not big
[1:20:49] enough they don't look right this isn't
[1:20:51] going to do anything anything it is
[1:20:53] going to do something God is telling you
[1:20:56] to move for a reason he needs you in
[1:20:59] that situation he needs you to pray your
[1:21:02] whole entire life do you understand
[1:21:04] that's how much God loves you if
[1:21:06] somebody has ever helped you that has
[1:21:09] trials they've gone through the horrible
[1:21:11] depression they've gone through their
[1:21:12] life was abusive everything that they've
[1:21:14] gone through if that person has helped
[1:21:15] you God did that to that person to help
[1:21:18] you in the future that's how much God
[1:21:21] loves you because is everything he was
[1:21:24] willing to put that person through that
[1:21:26] and he knew he was going to rescue both
[1:21:28] of you and he knew that person was going
[1:21:30] to understand and he did it on purpose
[1:21:34] so he could get you help later on for
[1:21:36] what you were going to put yourself
[1:21:38] through God didn't tell you to walk that
[1:21:39] path you wanted to walk that path these
[1:21:41] people want to walk these paths but we
[1:21:44] have no control over that and as humans
[1:21:46] we hate that we want to have that
[1:21:50] control but it's time to be out of that
[1:21:52] that control to lose that control to
[1:21:55] pray for them to actually enter in for
[1:21:57] them to actually love them the way that
[1:21:59] you're supposed to love them not try to
[1:22:01] fix their mess and cover everything up
[1:22:03] I'm not talking about making things okay
[1:22:05] people do stupid things and they know
[1:22:07] they're stupid they already know that
[1:22:09] they're very well aware of it trust me
[1:22:12] they just need you to love them right
[1:22:13] where they are they don't need you to
[1:22:15] try to get them to a lovable spot they
[1:22:17] don't need you to try to do a 12-step
[1:22:19] program to get them in the church to get
[1:22:21] them to do that they need you to pray
[1:22:23] for them specifically where they are
[1:22:26] because you know about it if you know
[1:22:27] about the depression you know about the
[1:22:30] Temptations you know about the lust you
[1:22:32] know about these different things and
[1:22:34] you see this happening that happened in
[1:22:36] your life so you could pray specifically
[1:22:38] for that person so you could actually
[1:22:40] help them not so you could try to take
[1:22:42] control of the
[1:22:44] situation we don't like our flaws we
[1:22:47] really don't like our flaws but I think
[1:22:49] I stole this from Brother Alex from last
[1:22:51] week in your flaws and your dis the way
[1:22:54] you disqualify yourself in your flaws is
[1:22:57] exactly what God qualifies you with that
[1:22:59] is what makes you qualified to do that
[1:23:01] job right when you think you cannot do
[1:23:03] anything great because you can't there's
[1:23:06] nothing that you can do that's perfect
[1:23:08] if you think I don't have what it takes
[1:23:11] I'm not the right man perfect because
[1:23:13] you're not the right man and you don't
[1:23:15] have what it takes but God does God is
[1:23:18] the same yesterday today and forever it
[1:23:19] has never changed he's always showed up
[1:23:23] for everyone he showed up for the woman
[1:23:24] at the well he showed up for the
[1:23:26] adulterous woman he showed up for the
[1:23:27] man on the cross who deserved nothing I
[1:23:30] always go back to the man on the cross
[1:23:31] because I can't get over that fact the
[1:23:33] man deserved nothing and then gets into
[1:23:37] heaven with God he deserved absolutely
[1:23:39] nothing he did nothing right everything
[1:23:43] was wrong so you can say all you care
[1:23:45] about is love you're hippie you're this
[1:23:47] that and the other and that world tries
[1:23:49] to pervert that on purpose so if you
[1:23:51] bring up 1 Corinthians 13
[1:23:53] in musicians you can come I think I'm
[1:23:55] about done so 1 Corinthians
[1:23:58] 13 to show that love is
[1:24:03] everything though I speak with tongues
[1:24:05] and Men of and Men of angels and have
[1:24:07] not charity I am become a sounding brass
[1:24:10] and of a tingling symbols and though I
[1:24:13] have the gift of Prophecy and understand
[1:24:15] all Mysteries and all the knowledge and
[1:24:18] through know I have all Faith so that I
[1:24:20] could remove mountains and have not
[1:24:23] charity I am nothing go back to that

[1:24:58] their lives if you do it without love
[1:25:00] you're nothing it says nothing it
[1:25:03] doesn't say that you're a piece of wood
[1:25:04] it doesn't say that you're drywall it
[1:25:06] doesn't say that you're dirt you're
[1:25:07] nothing you don't exist to God because
[1:25:11] you did it without love you moved Heaven
[1:25:14] and Earth for somebody but you didn't
[1:25:17] love them you did that for you so you
[1:25:20] could have a little bit of control in
[1:25:21] that sit situation so you cannot let go
[1:25:24] of that Pride where God's going to get
[1:25:26] the glory for that you did it for you
[1:25:29] you're nothing you cease to exist so you
[1:25:32] can walk up to God and he can say I
[1:25:34] never knew you you did all these Grand
[1:25:37] things I never knew you did it all
[1:25:38] without love love is everything if we
[1:25:41] cannot love nothing else happens if you
[1:25:44] love you're of God without love nothing
[1:25:48] matters you can move Heaven and Earth
[1:25:50] and nothing matters
[1:25:53] we have to love one another with
[1:25:55] everything we have we have to understand
[1:25:58] what that means not to try to get
[1:26:00] somebody into a lovable spot but love
[1:26:02] them right where they are love them
[1:26:05] enough to let them walk that path it
[1:26:07] looks like a mess and it is a mess
[1:26:11] that's why it looks like that but it's
[1:26:13] okay that's God's mess he's doing
[1:26:16] something with that don't go in there
[1:26:19] and try to sweep everything up and fix
[1:26:21] everything yourself
[1:26:22] pray for that situation God will show up
[1:26:25] for those people he's done it in my life
[1:26:27] he's done it in so many people's lives
[1:26:29] you can sing something if you
[1:26:31] want he showed up every single time
[1:26:35] every single time he's never failed
[1:26:38] anybody and if we can just find how to
[1:26:41] love those people in that situation and
[1:26:43] stop trying to change them into what we
[1:26:45] think is okay what we think is not a
[1:26:48] mess then we can know what God needs
[1:26:53] what God has for those people to do if
[1:26:55] we can just get out of the way and lose
[1:26:58] our control let God be God he's the same
[1:27:02] yesterday today and forever he knows
[1:27:05] love he is love if we do anything
[1:27:09] without love we're nothing we can change
[1:27:12] that right now we can change that any
[1:27:14] time just let go of that control let it
[1:27:16] go and let God God has an easy burden he
[1:27:20] wants to give it to you all all you have
[1:27:22] to do is turn it over to him there's
[1:27:24] nothing to worry about nothing to worry
[1:27:26] about he's got it with God before you
[1:27:29] what can stand against you what are you
[1:27:31] worried about we have God there's
[1:27:33] nothing to be worried about it might
[1:27:35] look like a mess because it is and it
[1:27:38] might be a really bad situation but God
[1:27:40] really don't care about really bad
[1:27:41] situations that don't mean anything to
[1:27:43] him God's going to show up if you let
[1:27:45] him show up let him show up in his way
