[0:00] of chapter
[0:03] 32 through the 34th verse
[0:08] it's not to say that my wife and i
[0:10] didn't has never had in this
[0:12] disagreement
[0:14] but for certain we didn't handle them
[0:15] like we were children
[0:19] god was able to
[0:21] keep us in that way
[0:24] and we thank god for it
[0:27] beginning at the 32nd verse
[0:30] fear not little flock
[0:33] for it it's your father's good pleasure
[0:37] to give you the kingdom
[0:41] we love that part don't we
[0:44] cell that you have
[0:52] and give arms
[0:55] provide yourself bags with wax which wax
[0:59] not old
[1:00] a treasure
[1:02] in the heavens that faileth not
[1:05] where no thief approaches
[1:08] neither moth corrupt
[1:11] where your treasure is
[1:15] there will your heart be also
[1:20] one more scripture
[1:21] saint john 15.
[1:26] i love
[1:27] the books of john chapters however you
[1:29] want to say it
[1:31] but john really goes straight to the
[1:33] heart
[1:36] john 15 5-6 it says i am the vine
[1:41] ye are the branches
[1:44] he that abideth in me
[1:47] and i in him
[1:49] the same bringeth forth much
[1:52] fruit for without me
[1:56] ye can do nothing
[1:58] y'all remember that
[2:01] if a man abide not in me
[2:05] he is cast forth as a branch
[2:09] and is withered
[2:12] and men gather them and cast them into
[2:16] the fire
[2:17] and they are burned
[2:20] let us pray
[2:22] heavenly father we thank you lord
[2:26] we thank you for your amazing grace
[2:30] we thank you god because we're serving a
[2:32] god that is not a million miles away
[2:36] but you promised us in this day that you
[2:39] would not only be in us with us but in
[2:41] us
[2:42] you have made this body your temple
[2:46] and we thank you god we pray father
[2:50] that you would bless this service
[2:52] in a special way
[2:55] i pray father god that you would bring
[2:57] change
[2:59] to the people
[3:01] the kind of change that we need
[3:05] to produce a rapture
[3:08] bless us now
[3:09] in your lovely name jesus christ we pray
[3:12] amen
[3:13] you may be seated
[3:15] i've got a lot to say in a short period
[3:17] of time
[3:19] but by the grace of god i like to
[3:21] entitle this message in christ
[3:25] he is shekinah
[3:30] say it again
[3:32] in christ
[3:34] he is
[3:36] shekinah
[3:38] because we often think a thought
[3:41] that the shekinah glory was something
[3:44] separate but there is only one true
[3:47] glory
[3:48] and that's the glory of god
[3:52] and it's only in his presence
[3:55] there is fullness of joy
[3:59] the one thing i loved this morning
[4:02] and understand is that we don't have to
[4:05] fear
[4:07] and the reasons why we don't have to
[4:09] fear is because
[4:11] we did not choose ourselves
[4:14] he chose us
[4:17] i always go back to election
[4:22] when the devil tries to tell me who i am
[4:27] and what i am not
[4:30] i go back
[4:32] to election
[4:34] [Applause]
[4:35] i go back to where i came from
[4:38] [Applause]
[4:39] i didn't come from the pits of hell
[4:43] but i came from god
[4:46] and i go back to god
[4:48] [Applause]
[4:52] one of the things i wanted to bring out
[4:54] is
[4:55] there's something
[4:59] that we can do
[5:02] that god himself cannot
[5:06] i heard this and i thought it was really
[5:08] good
[5:10] here in the scripture where he says i am
[5:12] the vine
[5:14] and ye are the branches
[5:19] it is the branches
[5:22] that produces the fruit
[5:24] [Applause]
[5:27] but it's the vine
[5:29] that gives life
[5:31] to the branches
[5:33] you see what i'm saying
[5:35] so i wanted to say it like this people
[5:38] of god those who call and claim yourself
[5:41] to be bride there's work to be done
[5:48] and that is
[5:49] to produce
[5:51] jesus christ
[5:53] the same
[5:55] yesterday today and forever
[5:59] god did not come
[6:01] to establish
[6:04] a church
[6:07] another organization or denomination
[6:11] he came a man to
[6:14] produce a bride
[6:17] someone or somebody
[6:20] that was with him
[6:23] from the beginning
[6:27] when the bible tells us about jesus
[6:30] coming and he being the body of god
[6:34] and the bible said he thought it not
[6:36] robbery to be equal with god
[6:40] see the problem with us
[6:43] is our mindset
[6:47] and i'm just going to work on that just
[6:48] a bit
[6:50] because right now the prince of the air
[6:54] is now working on the minds of the
[6:57] people
[6:59] is that right
[7:01] everything your youtube your facebook
[7:03] your facetime your whatever i don't know
[7:06] [Music]
[7:07] but the point is satan put those things
[7:10] out to change you
[7:14] oh come on somebody
[7:16] to desensitize you
[7:19] to make you believe that there must be
[7:22] another avenue
[7:24] for you
[7:25] outside of the world
[7:28] but there's only one way
[7:32] he changes your mind
[7:35] but he's not changing your mind in the
[7:38] sense of biology anymore
[7:41] you know of course we don't believe in
[7:43] that kind of evolution
[7:45] i trust when we don't
[7:49] but the truth of the matter is there is
[7:52] something evolving
[7:55] but it's not according to science
[7:58] it's according to the spoken word
[8:01] [Applause]
[8:05] one of the things that caught my
[8:06] attention and i wanted to throw this in
[8:09] because we're in a place we're going to
[8:10] be challenged
[8:13] challenged
[8:15] by psychology
[8:18] there was a time where when biology
[8:21] stood on our side
[8:23] is that right
[8:26] but now biology has to bow down to
[8:29] psychology
[8:32] come on somebody
[8:35] and i don't mean to step on nobody's
[8:37] toes but i was in
[8:38] walmart
[8:40] at a cash register
[8:42] i was having problems
[8:44] and this lady comes to me and she says
[8:50] my manager
[8:52] she can come and help you
[8:54] did you hear what i just said
[8:57] but when she came
[8:59] my eyes yes
[9:05] hello
[9:07] my eyes didn't declare or she
[9:11] my eyes declared are he
[9:15] y'all understand me
[9:18] and she's and listen social
[9:20] media it's using psychology
[9:24] slowly like a serpent
[9:28] huh
[9:28] to change your mind
[9:31] and your thoughts
[9:32] about the word of god
[9:35] hallelujah i don't care what you do
[9:39] to change yourself
[9:41] if you were born a man
[9:43] you're going to die a man
[9:46] if you were born a woman you're going to
[9:48] die a woman
[9:50] hallelujah
[9:52] [Applause]
[9:55] the part that they're not telling you
[9:57] is that science is lying to you
[10:04] hallelujah
[10:05] science
[10:07] is lying to you
[10:09] i don't know who showed it to me but
[10:11] somebody showed me this
[10:13] transit who was once a woman and wanted
[10:16] to be a man
[10:19] and and you know what listen i want you
[10:21] to understand this my soul cry out
[10:25] [Applause]
[10:27] i'm not condemning these people
[10:30] my soul cries out
[10:33] i always tell people i said i don't care
[10:36] if they come a man come in my church
[10:38] wearing a dress if he's searching for
[10:40] salvation
[10:42] [Applause]
[10:45] or if a woman come in my you know you
[10:47] understand repent whatever i i am a
[10:50] soul-saving station
[10:53] you are a soul-saving station
[10:57] hallelujah
[10:59] we're not here to criticize we're here
[11:02] to save hallelujah
[11:09] oh my it gets on my nerve when i see
[11:12] these self-righteous christians
[11:16] looking at people as though they're
[11:17] nasty and they're dirty that's the way
[11:20] the pharisees did it
[11:22] hallelujah
[11:23] but when jesus saw a sinner he saw a
[11:27] soul
[11:28] that was possibly that could possibly be
[11:30] saved
[11:32] hallelujah
[11:34] i don't care
[11:36] if they got tattoos from left to right
[11:40] they're searching for something
[11:42] they're trying to find an identity
[11:46] and the bride of jesus christ we have
[11:48] the answer
[11:50] [Applause]
[11:54] hallelujah jesus did not come
[11:58] to save those or to heal those that did
[12:01] not need physician
[12:03] he came to heal the sick
[12:07] hallelujah
[12:08] and this is the most sickest this is the
[12:11] sickest generation i have ever seen
[12:15] but jesus put us here
[12:18] because he knew the great physician
[12:21] hallelujah
[12:22] would be in this age
[12:25] to save whosoever will
[12:26] [Applause]
[12:32] he bypassed
[12:33] all those organizations
[12:36] is that right
[12:37] did you know brother banner ministry
[12:39] came in in at a time when he says go to
[12:42] the hedges
[12:44] go to the highways
[12:46] go to the scum of the earth
[12:48] that's where the seed of god is laying
[12:52] you want a rapture
[12:54] let's look for the last one
[12:56] [Applause]
[12:58] but not by your choice
[13:06] huh
[13:08] if some of y'all would meet jesus in the
[13:10] flesh y'all would probably score on him
[13:15] he didn't wear the fancy attire
[13:20] the bible doesn't even tell us how often
[13:22] he bathed
[13:27] because sometimes water was not
[13:28] convenient
[13:30] somebody helped me here
[13:34] but let me get back to our mind thing
[13:37] so you understand what the devil is
[13:39] slowly doing
[13:41] he's changing your mind
[13:44] my grandbaby who's 17 years old was in
[13:47] school and she made herself known to be
[13:49] a christian
[13:51] and then she had a circle of the the
[13:53] lgbt i don't even know abbreviation but
[13:56] anyway
[13:58] they
[13:59] pushed on her and and pressed her and
[14:01] tried to make her recant
[14:05] that she was a christian
[14:07] because they said you hate people like
[14:09] us she said no i don't
[14:12] i don't hate people like you
[14:14] but i do know there's an answer for you
[14:19] hallelujah
[14:21] i don't have no hatred in my heart
[14:23] toward anyone god knows that's the truth
[14:27] have people done me wrong yes do i have
[14:30] a right no
[14:35] hallelujah
[14:38] there's no bitterness
[14:41] but let me go on she stood her test
[14:46] she went to the counseling outing
[14:48] counselor to to tell what happened and
[14:50] you know what they did no thing
[14:54] she's the oddball
[14:58] let me tell you like this she doesn't
[14:59] even have the holy ghost yet
[15:02] she's seeking the holy ghost
[15:04] but she knows the word is right
[15:06] [Applause]
[15:09] hello
[15:10] it's like some of us say oh i can't quit
[15:13] smoking because i don't have the holy
[15:15] ghost you are deceived
[15:17] [Applause]
[15:19] you don't need the holy ghost
[15:21] to overcome cigarettes
[15:23] [Applause]
[15:26] you just need to quit
[15:28] [Applause]
[15:34] there's thousands maybe millions of
[15:36] people who have quit smoking
[15:39] and don't even know nothing about the
[15:41] holy ghost
[15:43] that's just your excuse
[15:46] now i don't know who that was for
[15:52] our minds is the channel that satan is
[15:55] working in
[15:57] or trying to work in he's trying to
[15:59] convince us that we are alone
[16:02] and that the lord is not with us
[16:05] of course he has always been a liar
[16:09] see because you got to understand if you
[16:12] get the holy ghost i mean the real holy
[16:14] ghost the mind of christ is in you
[16:17] oh see i can feel that
[16:22] mind of christ is in you
[16:23] [Applause]
[16:26] christ is not a secondary god
[16:31] he's not the second person in the
[16:33] trinity
[16:35] christ is god
[16:37] [Applause]
[16:39] see we use those words we think the holy
[16:41] ghost in christ is two different things
[16:46] but the anointing of god is god
[16:54] satan has always been a liar
[16:56] the truth is we were made gods
[17:02] see how y'all did that you if you're
[17:04] going to believe the message
[17:06] or you're not going to believe it
[17:10] but when you are when you get the holy
[17:13] ghost when god seals with the holy ghost
[17:16] you're no longer just a man
[17:19] you have become a messiah
[17:27] what you see in your mind
[17:29] you won't let the holy ghost change your
[17:31] mind
[17:33] see the holy ghost comes to strip you
[17:36] from your will
[17:38] and your ways
[17:40] and his mind becomes your mind
[17:45] oh come on somebody
[17:47] we're at a turning point
[17:51] many of us have married ourselves to the
[17:53] message system
[17:55] [Applause]
[17:59] you know the do's and the don'ts
[18:02] [Applause]
[18:03] you know how to be polite
[18:06] when it's convenient
[18:07] [Applause]
[18:11] but that's a system
[18:15] that's all right i was part of it
[18:18] but i'm trying my best to break out of
[18:19] that
[18:21] i don't want a system i need jesus
[18:24] christ
[18:26] and him only
[18:30] hallelujah
[18:31] you say how do you know it's a system
[18:34] because the system will always keep you
[18:36] divided
[18:39] [Applause]
[18:44] hallelujah
[18:46] the system will always make you think
[18:48] that you're better than your brother
[18:50] the sister will always make you jealous
[18:53] of your brother
[18:54] [Applause]
[18:55] but when the real holy ghost
[18:58] is in you hallelujah you will love your
[19:02] brother
[19:03] you'll die for your brother
[19:05] you'll do whatever it takes
[19:10] you've got to fight for this unit
[19:15] what you experienced this weekend that
[19:17] was god
[19:20] that was the anointing of god
[19:24] and if god comes down to consume the
[19:26] sacrifice who is the judge
[19:32] oh you don't tell me
[19:34] i know some of y'all
[19:38] you know that's a little bit too much
[19:40] [Music]
[19:43] i ain't going to go there but that's
[19:44] what you're saying
[19:49] but where the spirit of the lord is
[19:52] there's liberty
[19:53] [Applause]
[19:56] hallelujah
[19:57] you know it's so amazing
[20:00] brother branham said like this he said
[20:02] when
[20:03] when it doesn't matter what nationality
[20:05] you are
[20:06] he said but when you get the holy ghost
[20:09] he said they act the same way
[20:11] [Applause]
[20:13] i get i get i get messed up
[20:15] when i see people with the holy ghost
[20:18] and the holy spirit is falling
[20:20] and they're sitting there
[20:22] [Applause]
[20:27] see that's a systematic
[20:29] message hallelujah
[20:31] [Applause]
[20:33] say it again
[20:34] that's a systematic
[20:36] message hallelujah
[20:39] hallelujah but when the holy ghost
[20:43] get ahold of you
[20:45] it ain't nothing about a system it's
[20:48] something that gets a hold of you and
[20:50] you can't help yourself
[20:58] hallelujah
[21:00] glory to god
[21:02] and you do just like saul's daughter
[21:06] you embarrass me
[21:08] be careful
[21:10] or that's not that's not message be
[21:12] careful
[21:13] [Applause]
[21:15] because brother branham tried to tell us
[21:18] he said listen
[21:20] there's a system
[21:22] he didn't say it like this but he said
[21:23] listen
[21:24] when the music stops
[21:26] the people stop
[21:29] that's a system
[21:31] hallelujah
[21:32] because a true holy ghost feared person
[21:35] they don't care about no music
[21:37] hallelujah when god moves they move
[21:45] hallelujah we don't even care about time
[21:49] somebody help me here
[21:50] when you're in the anointing of god
[21:53] time means nothing
[21:55] [Applause]
[22:01] if you fully understood what your holy
[22:03] ghost is
[22:05] your holy ghost did not come from the
[22:07] third dimension
[22:11] we were born in this dimension
[22:13] flesh
[22:15] hallelujah but when you're born again
[22:17] you're born into another dimension
[22:22] is that right
[22:24] it has to be if the bible said we're now
[22:28] sitting in heavenly places in christ
[22:30] jesus
[22:32] he's in a different dimension
[22:35] and we need to learn how to draw from
[22:37] that dimension somebody help me
[22:43] but we want to stay here
[22:45] to give your flesh excuses
[22:50] but listen when you've been born again
[22:52] that eagle in you
[22:55] can't stay on the ground too long
[22:58] hallelujah
[22:59] there's something that's in you
[23:02] listen people i looked and i've been in
[23:04] this message a long time
[23:06] but i kept saying to myself
[23:08] god
[23:09] what i hear your prophet saying
[23:12] i don't see it
[23:13] [Applause]
[23:15] y'all understand what i mean
[23:17] let me clarify that i don't see it being
[23:20] lived
[23:21] in the people
[23:23] and what they are calling message
[23:26] there's got to be more to it
[23:28] [Applause]
[23:29] [Music]
[23:31] hallelujah
[23:33] we may have not organized it but we
[23:36] definitely have denominated it
[23:39] y'all understand me
[23:41] and as long as we think like that we're
[23:43] not going anywhere
[23:46] [Applause]
[23:47] [Music]
[23:50] lord
[23:52] see i know i'm touching on something
[23:53] that you don't totally agree with
[23:55] but that's okay
[23:57] the eagles hear what i'm saying
[24:01] the eagles hear what i'm saying listen
[24:04] when brother branham came in when god
[24:06] came in 1963 and we talked about the
[24:08] cloud how many of y'all believed that
[24:10] was god
[24:13] can i testify i'm gonna testify just a
[24:15] moment here
[24:16] when i was a boy
[24:18] i don't know what year is it was the 60s
[24:20] because kennedy and then you know uh
[24:23] different ones were doing things and i
[24:24] could remember that
[24:26] but me and some other guys we were in a
[24:29] just a little park
[24:30] and in that park
[24:33] we were playing football
[24:35] yeah real football
[24:38] football to us anyway you know back in
[24:40] the day you played football without pads
[24:48] but the truth of the matter is here was
[24:50] a white man
[24:52] i don't remember what he looked like but
[24:55] i do remember the colors he had black on
[24:57] black and white he had on a black suit
[24:59] with a black tie and a white shirt i
[25:00] remember that i thought he was an
[25:02] insurance man
[25:04] really because in my neighborhood during
[25:06] that time only the milkman
[25:09] the insurance man and the policeman
[25:14] was allowed in the neighborhood
[25:16] otherwise you had to be you're going to
[25:17] be questioned
[25:21] did i say insurance man yeah
[25:23] but the point is
[25:25] this man walked up to us with this
[25:27] magazine
[25:29] and he pulled it out
[25:31] he said come here boys i want to show
[25:32] you something he said the lord is soon
[25:34] to come
[25:36] and we were a little reluctant he says
[25:38] no no come come come so we went up to
[25:40] him he opened the magazine to the
[25:42] picture of the cloud
[25:44] and he asked can y'all see jesus in this
[25:46] cloud
[25:48] i was the only one of the boys
[25:52] i saw it
[25:53] i said i can see it you know what the
[25:56] man did he closed the book walked off
[25:59] and i never seen him again
[26:01] and i never saw this magazine or the
[26:04] picture of the cloud
[26:06] until i came to this message
[26:09] so you cannot tell me
[26:13] there is nobody in the world
[26:16] can make me deny it
[26:18] [Applause]
[26:22] but what was it
[26:24] jesus christ
[26:26] vindicating himself
[26:28] that he's the same yesterday today and
[26:31] forever
[26:31] [Applause]
[26:35] those seven
[26:36] angels they didn't come
[26:39] and form the face of christ
[26:42] in a cloud for you just put up on your
[26:44] wall
[26:49] he brought those clouds those angels
[26:51] brought a message
[26:53] [Applause]
[26:56] that was deeper
[26:58] than the seven church ages
[27:02] hallelujah
[27:04] he brought a secret
[27:06] they brought a secret
[27:09] and the secret
[27:11] is hidden
[27:13] upon the tapes in the books
[27:15] so you can listen to the message and
[27:18] still not get it
[27:20] see that's what happened to all of those
[27:22] who left
[27:23] they listened to it with an
[27:25] intellectualism they were able to preach
[27:27] it
[27:28] glory to god but they missed the very
[27:31] essence of what it came for
[27:34] it came to change you
[27:36] from glory to glory it came to change
[27:40] you
[27:41] what your mind
[27:48] it came to change your mind
[27:50] move your way from all organizations and
[27:52] denominationalism
[27:56] we still got it
[27:58] they crossed over with us
[28:01] just like they cross over with israel
[28:03] into into the wilderness
[28:06] yeah you still got the struggle for
[28:08] powers and
[28:09] you know the great ones
[28:14] you know i ran from that great one stuff
[28:19] they called me one time uh one of the
[28:22] top ten i said top ten
[28:28] i didn't even know we had a top ten
[28:33] i remember one sister when i was pastor
[28:35] in lime ohio they said why
[28:38] do you always have these no-name
[28:41] preachers
[28:45] i told her because the no-name preachers
[28:47] don't have to compete
[28:49] [Music]
[28:53] they get it from god and give it just
[28:55] like they get it from god hallelujah i'm
[28:59] not interested on how deep you are i
[29:01] just want to hear from god
[29:04] [Applause]
[29:11] let's move on eh
[29:13] so you know by the grace of god it's
[29:15] such a secret
[29:17] it's a secret feasting and that's what
[29:19] what gets me because so many people in
[29:21] the message you don't even hear the
[29:22] tapes anymore
[29:25] you go y'all remember when you first
[29:27] came to the message everybody played it
[29:31] you know you could knock on the door and
[29:32] you hear brother brandon's voice before
[29:34] you heard the person you was visiting
[29:36] now you know what happens you get a
[29:38] silence because everybody's running to
[29:40] cut the tv off
[29:46] you hear what i'm saying
[29:48] but what you don't understand in order
[29:51] for the head ship
[29:53] to settle on you
[29:55] you've got to know his mind
[29:57] you got to know how he's thinking
[30:00] [Applause]
[30:06] hallelujah is this okay
[30:08] coming from spiritual food in this
[30:10] season you see some brother adam said
[30:12] amen paragraph 135 he says truly lord
[30:16] his food was
[30:18] was to do the
[30:19] will of god
[30:21] now if his fool talk about jesus was to
[30:23] do the will of god what about the bride
[30:28] listen people aren't you tired
[30:30] of satan
[30:32] defeating us
[30:34] and don't tell me
[30:38] because what this what this devil did
[30:41] whenever it comes to the supernatural he
[30:44] put the stigma on us
[30:47] oh that's pentecostal
[30:51] now what did he do he put us back into
[30:54] bondage
[30:55] and that's what paul said you have not
[30:57] been called unto bondage to fear
[30:59] [Applause]
[31:03] don't tell me you don't fear
[31:05] the holy ghost move on you to shout and
[31:07] say amen and you look around to see if
[31:08] anybody else is doing it
[31:10] [Applause]
[31:12] that's fair
[31:16] hallelujah you're afraid amen to hold
[31:19] god at his word even if look like the
[31:21] person is dying and getting ready to
[31:23] take their last breath you still you
[31:25] just you ought to still say i know god
[31:28] sold me so
[31:30] he arrives again
[31:32] [Applause]
[31:36] satan changes your mind
[31:39] because your your body is right with
[31:41] pain and the devil told you you're going
[31:43] to die
[31:44] what that got to do with anything
[31:48] when did the did the doctors become my
[31:50] lord
[31:51] [Applause]
[31:53] hallelujah
[31:54] i know a woman who had an issue of blood
[31:58] that witnessed
[32:00] positioned at the physician
[32:02] and could not find a cure
[32:04] but there was a cure
[32:06] and the cure was jesus christ himself
[32:10] i don't care
[32:12] how many doctors you go to
[32:14] i'm the bride of jesus christ
[32:17] god said with his stripes i'm healed
[32:21] and when the doctors run out we have a
[32:24] cure
[32:25] we have a place to turn
[32:27] [Applause]
[32:30] that's my food
[32:32] [Applause]
[32:35] that's what the message taught me
[32:39] william branham had to go
[32:44] because had he not gone you would have
[32:46] never come to your position
[32:47] [Applause]
[32:47] [Music]
[32:49] is that right
[32:51] elijah had to go
[32:53] before elisha could ever come to
[32:55] position
[32:57] even though elisha followed elijah all
[33:00] those years
[33:02] he he could never take his position
[33:05] why
[33:06] because elijah was in the position that
[33:08] he was to take
[33:11] oh y'all got quiet on that
[33:13] but that's the truth
[33:15] that's why elijah said if you see me go
[33:19] you got to see him go
[33:21] in order to know where you stand
[33:24] somebody help me here
[33:26] right
[33:27] and when that same mantle would
[33:29] represent the holy ghost
[33:32] fell on eliza
[33:34] he said where is the god of elijah
[33:38] what was it it was a kind of glory it
[33:42] was the christ it was the holy ghost
[33:45] that was anointing him
[33:47] [Applause]
[33:50] listen
[33:51] the devil is trying to make you feel
[33:53] like you're a victim
[33:54] stop that nonsense
[33:57] i'm not a victim
[33:59] oh the age is bad it's so terrible
[34:03] whoa it's me oh no
[34:05] i'm not a victim
[34:07] i'm victorious
[34:09] hallelujah
[34:11] i'm victorious
[34:13] wow
[34:14] because all of this had been set and
[34:16] staged
[34:18] for
[34:18] me
[34:20] for you
[34:22] is that right
[34:23] watercolor told esther
[34:25] say this is the time you come from
[34:28] this is your time
[34:31] hallelujah
[34:33] you are in a time of pressure
[34:35] this is your time
[34:37] because the pressure is going to bring
[34:38] you to the place you ought to be
[34:41] somebody help me here
[34:43] yes sir
[34:45] and desperation struck her you see what
[34:48] i'm saying she is already in you it's
[34:51] already just waiting for the anointing
[34:53] to strike you
[34:55] hallelujah
[34:56] and when that anointing struck her she
[34:59] said listen to this
[35:00] you fast three days and nights
[35:04] don't eat or drink
[35:06] because tomorrow
[35:08] i'm going to see the king
[35:10] you hear what i'm saying and she said if
[35:13] i perish
[35:17] let me perish
[35:19] she was so desperate
[35:22] but one thing about her
[35:24] she knew the king
[35:26] chose her
[35:28] and she also knew the king loved her
[35:32] see you can't make a stand like that
[35:34] until you know the king love you
[35:35] [Applause]
[35:37] huh
[35:38] yes sir
[35:40] you know i love esther so i'm not going
[35:42] to spend too much time here because i'll
[35:43] be spending the whole rest of the
[35:44] message on her
[35:45] i can't hardly wait to meet her
[35:47] but the point is
[35:49] i love esther
[35:51] she came from nowhere
[35:53] didn't have mother father right
[35:55] raised by her uncle hallelujah a no-name
[35:58] like me
[36:00] hallelujah
[36:02] but look what god done he took a no name
[36:07] let's put it in your turn he took
[36:09] somebody who was a prostitute he took
[36:12] somebody who was a drug addict he took
[36:15] somebody a man who was a whoremonger he
[36:18] took somebody he was a liar he took
[36:21] somebody who was a drug hallelujah and
[36:24] said i choose you
[36:28] he chose me
[36:30] [Applause]
[36:33] i was a nobody
[36:36] hallelujah but thanks be to god
[36:40] he took this nobody and made him
[36:43] somebody
[36:49] hallelujah
[36:51] hallelujah
[36:52] [Applause]
[36:54] see
[36:55] many of us haven't even
[36:57] read the seals book because we
[36:59] we figure we just hear it from the
[37:00] pastors or the preachers
[37:02] you you are deceiving yourself
[37:07] you ought to be ashamed of yourself
[37:12] do you understand what that is
[37:14] that's that manner
[37:17] that was hidden
[37:20] behind the holies of holies
[37:23] [Applause]
[37:24] and god allowed that manner to be
[37:26] printed
[37:27] and the voice of it to be heard
[37:29] do you understand what i'm saying
[37:31] and that alone transform you
[37:34] when you hear the word preach it changes
[37:37] you
[37:38] you don't change it it changes you
[37:40] you are hey
[37:42] you are ordained
[37:44] you are chosen
[37:46] and the word finds the bride
[37:49] and changes her
[37:51] from glory to glory
[37:53] somebody help me here
[37:55] [Applause]
[37:58] people say oh
[38:01] he made mistakes
[38:06] but i got exactly what i needed to hear
[38:11] and i don't know who you are
[38:14] to be so grand to say that
[38:18] but i can tell you
[38:20] i can find where he's in the book of
[38:22] revelation
[38:23] [Applause]
[38:26] and i think if he made it i made it too
[38:30] right
[38:31] so if he had some errors and made it
[38:33] then i made it in on his errors
[38:35] [Applause]
[38:40] right
[38:41] [Applause]
[38:44] and most of the time people go that way
[38:46] because they want to be something
[38:49] they're not getting the glory that they
[38:50] want
[38:51] they want to build a kingdom
[38:53] and there's only one kingdom
[38:55] and that is the kingdom of the lord
[38:57] jesus christ
[39:00] listen
[39:01] we don't preach this church age we don't
[39:03] preach what they preach in pentecost
[39:06] i mean we don't cut out the good parts
[39:09] they're good things
[39:10] all of the things that they did and
[39:12] wasn't wrong
[39:13] because you can't cut off
[39:16] you understand that
[39:18] the restoration
[39:20] everything has been restored
[39:21] that's the problem with the message you
[39:23] know people coming to the message they
[39:25] don't even explain to them justification
[39:27] they don't even know sanctify what
[39:29] sanctification no no no i'm bright i can
[39:32] do what i want to do yeah you can and
[39:34] you're going straight to hell
[39:39] yeah you gonna do it go ahead and do it
[39:44] you say i want the holy ghost and you're
[39:46] still living kind of any kind of way and
[39:48] you're fooling yourself
[39:51] you've got to be sanctified
[39:57] holy ghost ain't going to feel your your
[39:59] vessel is full of trash
[40:02] [Applause]
[40:03] hello
[40:05] listen the bride is having her revival
[40:07] right now

[40:11] out of your life
[40:15] oh my god have mercy on us
[40:18] christ the shekinah
[40:21] think about it we look at this economy
[40:23] like oh i want to get there when oh he's
[40:25] already in there
[40:30] but we failed to tap into him
[40:35] let me tell you something secret about
[40:36] abraham he met elohim
[40:41] and what was the manifestation
[40:45] as they walked
[40:48] the crippled the humped over back
[40:50] however he was beginning to strengthen
[40:53] brother branham said there was a
[40:55] changing in his atoms
[40:58] that gray hair disappeared
[41:01] hallelujah
[41:03] that strong
[41:04] muscle man that he was whatever that was
[41:06] but anyway
[41:07] anyhow
[41:10] the man he was when he was old was young
[41:12] he now transformed
[41:15] did it happen overnight
[41:17] no
[41:18] as they went on
[41:20] went on
[41:22] abraham began to see
[41:26] sarah

[41:35] y'all hear what i'm saying
[41:37] and showers stood back saying honey you
[41:39] don't look so bad jose

[41:45] changing hallelujah people that was a
[41:49] shadow
[41:50] this is the real thing there is a
[41:53] changing and we're changing right now in
[41:56] the inner man from glory to glory to
[41:59] glory hallelujah and as we change
[42:04] this whole flesh
[42:06] is going to reflect
[42:07] [Applause]
[42:14] i like it when people say brother brooks

[42:43] let me read home now coming from uh
[42:46] excuse me still spiritual food and due
[42:47] season
[42:49] brother brahma says amen he says the
[42:51] mystery of it is those seals
[42:54] each one of those churches made an
[42:56] organization and got into it
[42:58] and that's one of the secrets things
[43:01] that has been wrong before god now i
[43:03] read that because if you're not you
[43:05] shouldn't say when israel came out of
[43:08] egypt egypt still was in israel
[43:12] the wilderness came to test them
[43:15] to draw them away from systematic
[43:17] worship
[43:23] and you and i know that's what we've
[43:24] come into this form now
[43:29] we've allowed laws and rules and
[43:32] regulations
[43:33] the holy ghost has fallen and you're
[43:35] looking at the clock and says oh wait
[43:36] wait a minute we gotta we gotta cut it

[44:06] let me say it like this when moses stood
[44:08] went up on the mountain and stood in the
[44:10] pill of fire right there with the
[44:12] shekinah glory then moses says god you

[48:25] denominations know nothing about it
[48:28] [Applause]
[48:30] and whether you understand it or not
[48:32] this anointing you feeling is really
[48:34] changing you
[48:35] it is the shekinah it is not some other
[48:38] anointing that is why we should always
[48:41] want the anointing because it is
[48:44] anointing that breaks and destroys the
[48:46] yokes
[48:51] when my anointing was falling when it
[48:53] was falling all over me you know what i
[48:54] was doing praising god and claiming
[48:56] everything
[48:58] you didn't see me because i was in here
[49:02] i was worshiping with him
[49:04] you understand me
[49:09] there's a secret place
[49:13] and the message has provided the secret
[49:15] place
[49:17] oh jesus y'all looking at me like is
[49:19] this man crazy
[49:20] i probably am it's okay it feels pretty
[49:23] good here
[49:25] brother brown said like this and
[49:28] and uh in a spiritual food and due
[49:30] season go listen to that message that
[49:32] whole message is wonderful 65.
[49:34] listen he says listen we we notice here
[49:36] again if the word is in us
[49:39] and has come to us
[49:41] as it did elijah in that day it'd do the
[49:45] same thing that he did
[49:51] he would feed us on the secret things of
[49:54] god
[49:55] which is hid in hid from the world oh
[49:59] again it makes the message in the
[50:01] messenger as one
[50:03] now i hear people quote that all the
[50:05] time
[50:06] but you fail to see
[50:08] we're not talking about brother branham
[50:10] right now
[50:13] because when elijah ministry was over
[50:15] elicious a lot of ministry was on
[50:21] you understand me the problem with the
[50:23] people is you want to constantly talk
[50:25] about brother branham because you want
[50:26] to give an excuse for you not doing
[50:28] anything
[50:29] [Applause]
[50:32] but when brother brandon preached a
[50:33] message he said the move is on for the
[50:35] bride
[50:37] and everybody said all the moves on the
[50:38] bride no he said the move is on for the
[50:40] bride
[50:42] that means the political realm the
[50:43] social realm and economical realm every
[50:46] realm
[50:47] is going to push the bride into her
[50:49] place
[50:50] [Applause]
[50:50] [Music]
[50:55] just like it was in esther
[50:57] she would have laid there right in that
[50:59] place but listen god moved
[51:03] he had the devil to move on haman
[51:06] and it was a decree we're going to kill
[51:09] them all
[51:12] she had to feel the pressure
[51:15] of her day in order to move into her
[51:17] position
[51:21] y'all hear what i'm saying
[51:23] the truthful is we don't see our day
[51:26] but it's later than you think
[51:29] right now god is dealing with
[51:31] individuals that will one day soon take
[51:34] a translation
[51:36] and you'll know nothing about it
[51:38] because you've been dollatory
[51:41] you can't be lazy right now
[51:44] and let me tell you something if you're
[51:45] not praying you are in trouble
[51:50] the devil gonna try his best to keep you
[51:51] from praying but that's your secret
[51:53] closet
[51:54] that's when god can talk to you and you
[51:56] can talk to god
[51:58] you hear what i'm saying
[51:59] that's where god can give you orders
[52:01] that nobody else can hear
[52:05] you've got to pray
[52:07] i'm going to say it again you must pray
[52:14] you say i don't feel it
[52:15] when i talk to people i don't feel it
[52:19] but they get the message don't they
[52:22] now if i'm in anger they'll feel it
[52:25] but the point is you can talk to people
[52:26] all day and you know oh i felt when i
[52:28] said that word i just felt it no you
[52:30] didn't
[52:35] you see what i'm saying i'm almost done
[52:37] i'm almost done i'm trying to come to
[52:38] the end of it
[52:40] but i want you to understand by the
[52:41] grace of god let me finish this quote
[52:43] it'll do the same thing that he did
[52:45] y'all understand that then there's a
[52:47] comma he would feed on the feet on he
[52:50] will feed on the secret things of god
[52:51] which is hid from the world now you talk
[52:54] about the coming of christ and all these
[52:55] things well what is he going to meet
[52:56] when he comes
[52:59] i just know what isaac did
[53:01] when he came
[53:02] he met rebecca
[53:05] he already knew eliza
[53:07] but rebecca was something different
[53:10] hello
[53:12] now you said well wait a minute wait
[53:13] then let me tell you something rebecca
[53:16] saw part of the word ella ethan never
[53:18] did
[53:33] is that right
[53:34] and she went and he went into her
[53:37] mother's tent his mother's tent
[53:40] right but you understand
[53:44] isaac
[53:46] hit nothing
[53:48] from rebecca
[53:53] i can't say too much more with that one
[53:56] but my point is
[53:59] if you're just resting on what you can
[54:01] see
[54:02] from the books and the tapes you missing
[54:04] it
[54:05] is deeper than that
[54:10] and rebecca will see it
[54:13] it's given to her to see it
[54:16] and to understand it
[54:18] oh jesus let me move
[54:21] right
[54:24] because you got to understand the bride
[54:26] and the word must become one
[54:28] if we are the messenger which we are
[54:32] is that right
[54:34] we are
[54:36] see how you're so lazy with that we are
[54:39] [Applause]
[54:41] make your flesh believe it if you don't
[54:47] right
[54:48] the spiritual food is ready
[54:51] and it's in the season now how many
[54:54] y'all ever seen that how the message you
[54:56] could read and study it all the time you
[54:58] just love it then all of a sudden
[55:00] there's a season
[55:02] the same book you read yesterday is now
[55:04] unfolding
[55:06] [Applause]
[55:07] huh
[55:08] because it's ordained to do that
[55:12] you see what i'm saying
[55:13] every time we need something when the
[55:15] devil moves god moves
[55:18] hallelujah he always give us a word to
[55:21] fight back
[55:22] [Applause]
[55:26] right now satan is working with the mind
[55:29] and god is working with your mind
[55:31] that's why he said let this mind be in
[55:34] you that was in christ jesus you've got
[55:37] to be changed your mind must be renewed
[55:42] because what the devil is still telling
[55:43] you
[55:44] bringing back all dirt and trash that
[55:46] you used to be
[55:49] oh
[55:50] my and he uses against you all the time
[55:53] but god told us through the prophets
[55:55] that when god gives a person a birth he
[55:58] don't patch him up
[56:00] he makes him a new creature
[56:04] you got to realize if the devil can
[56:07] change your mind that you've been
[56:09] changed you'll go back to doing the old
[56:11] things but when you know that god has
[56:14] brought a
[56:15] hallelujah i'm not the same man i'm not
[56:19] the same woman i don't go the same
[56:21] places i don't do the same things i have
[56:24] no desire to do it
[56:28] say that you are a liar
[56:33] i know i've been born again
[56:35] hallelujah
[56:36] and god is bringing me up to the full
[56:39] stature of christ
[56:41] little by little
[56:44] she is already in the seed
[56:46] brother said everything i need is all
[56:48] right four raptures already in there
[56:50] hallelujah
[56:52] and y'all don't even know you're hurting
[56:54] yourself when you don't need entry into
[56:55] the anointing
[56:57] you see that's a lot of carry-on you
[56:59] better carry on
[57:05] huh
[57:06] you better carry on
[57:08] well
[57:09] you know people
[57:11] this is what get me and i still don't
[57:13] fully understand it but they say well
[57:15] that's not my nature
[57:20] well you need to get rid of the one you
[57:21] got
[57:21] [Applause]
[57:23] but the one you got ain't worshiping god
[57:25] and you've been made to worship god
[57:28] hallelujah
[57:32] all that screaming and shouting y'all
[57:34] knew what y'all do it at home
[57:47] i remember a sister telling me that when
[57:49] i went back and i say too much
[57:54] i don't do all of that
[57:56] and then her daddy brought her lawnmower
[58:01] and she loves to cut the grass
[58:03] i was there
[58:07] she saw the llama
[58:10] [Music]
[58:11] i walked up and like
[58:15] i caught her in the ass you're gonna get
[58:17] sighted of a lot more
[58:19] you can't get excited about the word of
[58:21] god
[58:22] there's something wrong with that
[58:31] hallelujah
[58:33] you don't have to act like me but you
[58:36] least need to let me know that you're
[58:37] alive
[58:38] [Applause]
[58:44] hallelujah
[58:46] i'm talking about the shekinah that's
[58:48] what you're feeling that ain't brother
[58:50] brooks emotionally stirring you up
[58:51] that's it that's the shekinah hallelujah
[58:54] is that right the bible said god makes
[58:57] his ministers ministers of fire
[58:59] that's fire you really
[59:02] that is the fire of god
[59:04] [Applause]
[59:06] you don't see it but it's there
[59:09] it's coming from here
[59:19] remember
[59:24] he said each one of you have this food
[59:27] if you wish it
[59:28] if you are willing to steal away from
[59:31] all the unbelief of this hour
[59:34] if you are ready to come into christ
[59:37] come into his promise
[59:39] he said and remember his promises in
[59:41] malachi 4 luke 17 30 also in saint john
[59:44] 14 12 how many more scriptures of
[59:47] telling you joel 2 38 oh
[59:50] that he would do
[59:52] or in 2 28 rather what he would do in
[59:55] these last days and how the prophet said
[59:59] that it'll be light in these last days
[1:00:03] how it will work
[1:00:05] that's why
[1:00:07] i don't care how great a preacher is in
[1:00:09] this message
[1:00:12] none of them moved me
[1:00:15] [Applause]
[1:00:17] if you don't belong to this you ain't
[1:00:18] gonna make it
[1:00:25] who gave him that authority
[1:00:29] y'all don't even know what i'm talking
[1:00:30] about but i know what i'm talking about
[1:00:33] preachers raise up and they think
[1:00:34] because they can teach it
[1:00:38] god never said teach it
[1:00:40] preach it
[1:00:42] demonstrate it
[1:00:44] let's see that oh y'all don't got quiet
[1:00:46] on me now but it's true anyhow we need
[1:00:49] to see power behind this message we've
[1:00:51] had a teaching revival we need to see
[1:00:54] what was taught live
[1:01:00] i ain't against teaching
[1:01:03] i love teaching
[1:01:06] but i want to see it live
[1:01:08] brother brown said putting that dynamic
[1:01:10] and the mechanics together
[1:01:12] hallelujah
[1:01:14] and i can't hardly stand it when the
[1:01:16] teachers be trying to tell us how the
[1:01:17] holy ghost is supposed to act right
[1:01:19] right
[1:01:20] and i'll just tell them you know what
[1:01:21] you need to get the holy ghost and then
[1:01:22] you can tell me how it acts
[1:01:26] now i don't mean no harm but i've
[1:01:28] learned that because people can teach
[1:01:30] you real good don't mean they got it
[1:01:31] [Applause]
[1:01:33] there's a lot of great teachers who once
[1:01:35] was in the messages no longer in the
[1:01:36] message
[1:01:39] see that's i learned that
[1:01:41] i learned that this brain is so smart
[1:01:43] that you can catch the uh at least the
[1:01:44] intellectual part of it
[1:01:46] and you can bring it like you know it
[1:01:49] but let me tell you what listen i don't
[1:01:51] brag on myself it doesn't happen all the
[1:01:54] time but i've seen cancer healed i've
[1:01:56] seen the dead raised twice
[1:01:59] hallelujah i've seen all manner of
[1:02:01] diseases blood pressure you name it

[1:02:09] have spina bifida i say tell that devil
[1:02:11] he's a liar
[1:02:20] hallelujah that old same devil came to
[1:02:23] me a few years ago saying you got cancer
[1:02:25] to prostrate it's aggressive it's more
[1:02:27] than likely in your bones hallelujah i

[1:02:31] then i thought why am i crying i'm not
[1:02:33] afraid of the devil
[1:02:35] [Applause]
[1:02:36] then the lord spoke to my wife and said
[1:02:38] you don't have no cancer i said that's
[1:02:40] right
[1:02:41] i said i'm going to take your report
[1:02:43] over that report
[1:02:45] guess what

[1:03:25] hallelujah
[1:03:27] my life is not in the doctor's hands my
[1:03:30] life is in god's hand
[1:03:32] [Applause]
[1:03:41] hallelujah
[1:03:43] no it's true it's true it's true it's
[1:03:44] true and you know we look at this thing
[1:03:46] we say well all i'm trying to say is
[1:03:48] like it's time to produce what we've
[1:03:50] been preaching
[1:03:52] and you just can't live any kind of life
[1:03:54] to produce that
[1:03:56] if god told the prophet he had to be
[1:03:57] more consecrated that means you got to
[1:03:59] be more consecrated
[1:04:03] hallelujah it's true
[1:04:05] when jesus come he'll find the same
[1:04:07] material
[1:04:09] the bride
[1:04:11] doing wonders
[1:04:12] doing explorers
[1:04:15] these signs should follow them that
[1:04:17] believe all of those things the early
[1:04:19] church did when christ come or when he
[1:04:22] comes to rapture us it'll be that way
[1:04:30] i'm not trying to brag on myself i'm
[1:04:31] trying to lift up jesus
[1:04:33] so much we need to know that jesus still
[1:04:35] lives
[1:04:36] [Applause]
[1:04:38] hallelujah living in iowa we've had
[1:04:41] storms after storms and there was a real
[1:04:44] terrible storm coming our way and
[1:04:45] everybody everybody one all of us wanted
[1:04:47] to go to church so we got together and
[1:04:49] we prayed
[1:04:51] did you know the storm did this
[1:04:57] and even the news people say we don't
[1:04:59] know what happened hey
[1:05:02] but we know what happened
[1:05:05] it's a
[1:05:06] secret it's the bride's food
[1:05:09] it's what we do
[1:05:11] it's not an open show
[1:05:14] [Applause]
[1:05:17] i gotta quit
[1:05:22] uh
[1:05:24] hallelujah god is so good to us
[1:05:26] [Applause]

[1:05:29] i'm going to stop i've got to stop
[1:05:32] cause y'all have me here the next day
[1:05:33] and next day
[1:05:36] i feel the pulling i really appreciate
[1:05:38] it
[1:05:38] [Applause]
[1:05:38] [Music]
[1:05:41] [Applause]
[1:05:49] i had two strokes and they weren't
[1:05:51] really really bad but one left me with a
[1:05:53] little limp and everything and i think
[1:05:54] y'all told y'all that and i would run
[1:05:56] out i would run and that left foot would
[1:05:58] be slapping the flow
[1:06:00] like that i didn't tell my wife because
[1:06:02] you know my wife you know anybody's
[1:06:03] fighting
[1:06:04] you know
[1:06:06] so i didn't tell her what was going on
[1:06:07] and as i ran i was like with the stripes
[1:06:09] i'm here
[1:06:12] right
[1:06:13] now i could run
[1:06:15] y'all hear what i'm saying
[1:06:17] see your words creates
[1:06:20] your words creates
[1:06:23] if you really believe that you got to
[1:06:24] believe what you're speaking if you're
[1:06:27] going to speak it believe it
[1:06:29] hallelujah it will create for you god
[1:06:32] will prove to you that he's alive and
[1:06:35] well he's the same god that william
[1:06:38] branham served
[1:06:41] [Music]
[1:06:46] it's true
[1:06:48] and i really don't know where the quiet
[1:06:50] people gonna be
[1:06:54] they might have a section up there
[1:06:56] i don't know
[1:07:00] i know god asked job where were you
[1:07:04] when the sons of god
[1:07:06] shouted and jumped for joy
[1:07:09] i don't know
[1:07:13] let me hurry up
[1:07:14] i don't mean to rush but i need to i
[1:07:16] don't want to you know sometimes you can
[1:07:17] preach too long and then everybody
[1:07:18] forget everything you said
[1:07:20] so i don't want you to do that
[1:07:22] amen so this is going to be the last
[1:07:24] quote okay
[1:07:27] now when we found out that elijah could
[1:07:29] say that
[1:07:30] because the message of the hour in the
[1:07:32] word of god or the messenger the
[1:07:34] messenger and the word
[1:07:36] was exactly the same thing
[1:07:39] see you see what i'm saying you and i
[1:07:41] can't be duel
[1:07:43] we can't say what what brother brandon
[1:07:45] said or what the message said and then
[1:07:46] do something opposite
[1:07:48] it has to be what he said
[1:07:51] because what people do the revelation of
[1:07:53] of these son of man is what people fail
[1:07:55] to see they think that brother branham
[1:07:56] is like one of those denominational
[1:07:58] prophets
[1:07:59] no that was god
[1:08:03] hello
[1:08:04] that was god
[1:08:06] hiding behind human flesh
[1:08:08] [Applause]
[1:08:09] i'm not talking about the part that went
[1:08:11] hunting
[1:08:13] i'm talking about the one that was
[1:08:14] preaching
[1:08:16] and when he ever said thus saith the
[1:08:17] lord that was god
[1:08:20] you understand me
[1:08:22] hallelujah when he pointed and said
[1:08:24] squirrels and so many that was god
[1:08:28] holy see you understand what i'm saying
[1:08:31] now that same god wants to occupy your
[1:08:34] body
[1:08:42] and let me say it like this people i
[1:08:44] want to be careful because i want to
[1:08:45] keep a balance
[1:08:47] you know you can get legalistic
[1:08:49] in the sense okay i shout everybody got
[1:08:51] a child
[1:08:52] no that's not true
[1:08:54] and that's what people do when they sit
[1:08:56] still because i sit still everybody
[1:08:57] should no you're legalistic too
[1:09:00] there is a balance
[1:09:02] some shout and some don't
[1:09:04] but i always try to get those that don't
[1:09:06] do to do
[1:09:11] you know because i think you don't know
[1:09:13] what you're missing
[1:09:18] and god will give you whatever you ask
[1:09:20] for
[1:09:20] [Applause]
[1:09:22] if you want to dance for the lord ask
[1:09:23] him he'll give it
[1:09:25] that's the truth
[1:09:28] i remember the first time i danced man i
[1:09:30] was all in the flow
[1:09:34] like a top two
[1:09:35] don't you spin
[1:09:37] but the truth of the matter is you can't
[1:09:40] god do what does whatever he wants to do
[1:09:43] oh jesus have mercy is that right
[1:09:46] brother branham thought the same thing
[1:09:47] in the seat of the skull for they would
[1:09:49] and how i hadn't seen that in a long
[1:09:50] time with no shoes to be dancing in
[1:09:52] their hair just be flunk
[1:09:55] y'all got it so pinned tight
[1:10:01] but one time that was a glorious thing
[1:10:03] to see
[1:10:05] it's true i remember going to a message
[1:10:07] church and she had her hair braided up
[1:10:09] or something like that and had a ball on
[1:10:10] the side and she was just
[1:10:14] wow
[1:10:17] that's all i'm saying
[1:10:23] people of god
[1:10:25] god is good
[1:10:27] let me finish this get out the way
[1:10:30] the prophet the word of the message
[1:10:31] messenger messenger message and message
[1:10:33] was the same jesus said if i do the
[1:10:35] works that which
[1:10:37] that's written of me then don't believe
[1:10:39] me that's good any man in his message is
[1:10:42] one
[1:10:43] you see what i'm saying so how can you
[1:10:45] be a believer if you don't do what you
[1:10:47] believe
[1:10:51] jesus said it you don't believe me
[1:10:53] believe the works
[1:10:55] my works prove who i am
[1:10:58] not my preaching
[1:11:00] not my teaching
[1:11:01] my words
[1:11:04] that's why today that that they do not
[1:11:06] believe in doing the works of god
[1:11:08] because they do not accept the message
[1:11:10] of god they don't believe the message
[1:11:15] i didn't say that
[1:11:16] he said it but those who believe god's
[1:11:19] hour that we're living in these things
[1:11:22] are hidden food
[1:11:24] just think god has so hid it that they
[1:11:28] look right at it and don't see it
[1:11:31] the same way that elijah blinded the
[1:11:33] syrian army
[1:11:35] the same way that god blinded the
[1:11:37] unbeliever from the true genuine food of
[1:11:39] god
[1:11:40] the believer
[1:11:41] what they call noah a fanatic building
[1:11:44] an ark his eyes were open to the word of
[1:11:46] god and the promise they were they the
[1:11:49] very thing that their they called
[1:11:51] fanaticism saved noah and his family
[1:11:55] see the very thing the thing that people
[1:11:58] laugh at
[1:12:00] is the thing that we pray for
[1:12:03] feel me oh god
[1:12:06] hallelujah it's gotten so bad about
[1:12:09] around the message people are just
[1:12:11] afraid to get the holy ghost enough to
[1:12:13] speak in time
[1:12:17] yes
[1:12:18] i remember having you know communion one
[1:12:20] time and a brother just kind of let it
[1:12:22] slip one time he he was so full of the
[1:12:24] holy ghost he slipped speaking in
[1:12:25] tongues i had some brother come to me
[1:12:27] says nah that ain't right
[1:12:29] he needed interpreter
[1:12:32] come on
[1:12:33] it just made me know you haven't prayed
[1:12:37] cause sometimes you can pray
[1:12:39] and there ain't no interpreter
[1:12:41] but the tongues come
[1:12:47] it's sad
[1:12:49] bondage that's what i call it
[1:12:52] that's true
[1:12:53] true people are around the message don't
[1:12:55] even get it speaking in tongues no more
[1:12:57] do they do that
[1:12:59] what's wrong with that
[1:13:01] something's wrong with that
[1:13:03] if the original church received the
[1:13:06] birth now tell me
[1:13:08] when did the women change their way of
[1:13:09] having babies
[1:13:12] when they changed their way of having
[1:13:14] babies then god would change his way of
[1:13:16] having some
[1:13:18] but those acts 2 38 screaming harlem
[1:13:21] kids
[1:13:22] that's where it was in the beginning
[1:13:24] that's the way it'll be in the ending
[1:13:27] say what you want to say a lot of people
[1:13:29] are still born
[1:13:32] you mean to tell me you lived this life
[1:13:34] all these years and haven't had some
[1:13:37] kind of sensation come upon you
[1:13:41] something ought to strike you
[1:13:44] man brother am i wrong you can correct
[1:13:46] me
[1:13:47] but my point is
[1:13:48] wouldn't it be wonderful if you get this
[1:13:51] just get struck they say well we don't
[1:13:52] get the holy ghost like that and when we
[1:13:53] get it without sensation it always been
[1:13:55] that way
[1:13:58] every person from the new testament all
[1:14:00] the way up all of them got the holy
[1:14:01] ghost without sensation
[1:14:04] because in the soul
[1:14:05] there is no sensation
[1:14:07] there is no feeling
[1:14:09] and when the holy ghost down goes down
[1:14:11] to your soul
[1:14:12] and your soul right could recognize it
[1:14:14] it comes up through your spirit then
[1:14:16] your spirit catches it
[1:14:19] that's when you cry hallelujah
[1:14:22] [Applause]
[1:14:25] always been that wasn't you know brother
[1:14:27] branham just tried to tell us where the
[1:14:28] holy ghost needed to strike
[1:14:30] and in there there's no social no no but
[1:14:33] it's faith or unbelief
[1:14:35] but when that soul catches it
[1:14:37] and that thing is quicker come on
[1:14:41] he can't be a he can't be double-minded
[1:14:44] you know what i'm saying there's got to
[1:14:46] be an understanding of what he said
[1:14:48] he said because if you make him some uh
[1:14:50] emotional look what you make god do
[1:14:52] well then what did he do on the day of
[1:14:54] pentecost
[1:14:58] it always went back down to the place
[1:15:00] where the shekinah glory can dwell
[1:15:05] god help us jesus because some of y'all
[1:15:07] don't believe what i just said but
[1:15:08] nevertheless it's true
[1:15:14] look what that doctrine did to the
[1:15:15] message
[1:15:18] that's all i'm saying
[1:15:22] that's all i'm saying look what it did
[1:15:27] and look who the people who started that
[1:15:29] thing where are they
[1:15:31] they don't even believe the message
[1:15:36] that's all i'm saying
[1:15:40] i'm almost done
[1:15:49] he said if i do the works that's written
[1:15:50] to me then don't believe me that do good
[1:15:52] any man this message is one that's why
[1:15:55] today that they do not believe is in
[1:15:58] doing the works of god because they do
[1:16:00] not accept the message of god they don't
[1:16:02] believe the message
[1:16:04] to pentecostal
[1:16:08] and listen the way you say that you
[1:16:09] better be careful
[1:16:11] unless you blaspheme the holy ghost
[1:16:14] but those who believe in god hour i'm
[1:16:16] done that we live in these listen but
[1:16:18] those who believe god's hour that we're
[1:16:19] living in the
[1:16:21] the hidden food just think god has so
[1:16:23] hid in that they look right at it and
[1:16:26] don't see it see
[1:16:28] why god called noah for nazism building
[1:16:30] an ark his eyes were open to the word of
[1:16:32] god the promise the very thing that they
[1:16:35] call fanaticism save noah and his family
[1:16:38] see the very thing the thing that people
[1:16:40] is that right oh oh a boss if you want
[1:16:43] the holy ghost he said no i'll have it
[1:16:45] over here oh no no no the boss you can't
[1:16:47] get it over there you got to come get it
[1:16:49] over here

[1:16:55] yeah was the instructions wrong oh we're
[1:16:57] living in another another age we don't
[1:16:59] get it like that that's why you ain't
[1:17:00] got it
[1:17:06] i know what i'm talking about
[1:17:08] and i know god told me to preach this
[1:17:09] message
