[1:29] to me sounds good to me
[1:31] amen
[1:33] let's just read till
[1:35] verse 10.
[1:37] and I Brethren when I came to you came
[1:40] not with Excellency of speech or wisdom
[1:44] declaring unto you the testimony of God
[1:47] for I determined not to know anything
[1:50] among you
[1:51] save Jesus Christ and him crucified
[1:55] I was with you in weakness and in fear
[1:57] in much trembling it's about how I feel
[2:00] tonight
[2:01] in my speech and my preaching was not
[2:03] with enticing words of man's Wisdom but
[2:06] in demonstration of spirit and of power
[2:09] that your faith should not stand should
[2:13] not stand in the wisdom of men but in
[2:16] the power of God
[2:17] how be it we speak wisdom among that
[2:21] them that are perfect yet not the wisdom
[2:24] of this world nor the Peace of this
[2:26] world that come to not but we speak
[2:30] the wisdom of God in a mystery
[2:33] even the hidden wisdom which God
[2:36] ordained before the world
[2:38] unto our Glory which none of the princes
[2:42] of this world knew for at for had they
[2:44] known it they would not have crucified
[2:47] the Lord of Glory
[2:49] but as it is written I hath not seen
[2:53] Nor Ear heard neither have entered into
[2:56] the heart of man the things which God
[2:58] hath prepared for them that love him
[3:01] but God hath revealed them unto us by
[3:05] his spirit for the spirit searcheth all
[3:08] things yea the Deep things of God Amen
[3:12] do you believe that tonight
[3:14] amen let's just borrow heads and word
[3:16] prayer and we'll just uh just uh offer
[3:19] this word up to the Lord thank you Lord
[3:21] for this word tonight Lord Jesus God I I
[3:24] ask that you would just take control
[3:25] right now God
[3:27] uh Heather hath in here let him hear
[3:29] what the spirit says Lord Jesus so let
[3:31] me just be available to you God and just
[3:34] give up and let you take complete
[3:36] control Lord Jesus we just heard a
[3:38] wonderful testimony of Ben and Megan
[3:41] McGarry's
[3:42] um child today going home Lord Jesus
[3:45] going home Lord still on a ventilator
[3:47] Lord but he's home God what a miracle
[3:50] what a testimony it is Lord Jesus to
[3:52] hear the evidence of your goodness God
[3:54] on their life Lord just healing after
[3:56] healing of his little little feeble body
[3:58] Lord Jesus and we want to praise God
[4:00] with them Lord Jesus we thank you Lord
[4:02] for it we give you all the glory and
[4:05] honor Lord Jesus tonight in Jesus name
[4:07] amen praise God may you babysitter
[4:10] tonight
[4:13] amen first I'd like to look at the
[4:15] beginning so Genesis 2 will go back
[4:18] there we're going to look at
[4:20] Satan and his subtlety
[4:23] amen he still is subtle amen
[4:28] Genesis chapter 2.
[4:32] I got that wrong Genesis chapter 3. well
[4:35] Genesis chapter 2 you can start there
[4:37] but you see the word of God
[4:40] here this is chapter 2 and verse 17.
[4:44] I'll pull that one up first
[4:46] there it is this is the word of God but
[4:48] the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[4:50] Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day
[4:53] thou edest therefore Thou shalt surely
[4:56] die that's the word of the Lord right
[4:58] it's the word of the Lord so we turn
[5:00] over the verse three
[5:02] chapter or verse 1 chapter 3 verse 1.
[5:05] now the spirit was more subtle than any
[5:07] beast of the field which the Lord God
[5:10] hath made and he said unto the woman yea
[5:12] hath God so he asked the question first
[5:14] is starts hath God said You shall not
[5:18] eat of every tree of the garden
[5:20] and the woman said in the serpent we may
[5:22] eat of the fruit of the Trees of the
[5:24] garden but of the fruit of the tree
[5:27] which is in the midst of the garden God
[5:29] has said see Eve knowing the word he
[5:32] shall not eat of it neither shall ye
[5:34] touch it lest ye die
[5:36] and say and the serpent said unto the
[5:38] woman you shall not surely die
[5:41] one word
[5:43] one word
[5:46] for God does not
[5:48] for God does not for God doth know that
[5:53] in the day you eat thereof then your
[5:55] eyes shall be open and you shall be as
[5:57] Gods knowing Good and Evil
[6:00] that's where the reasoning comes in for
[6:03] Eve and when the woman saw that the tree
[6:06] was good for food and that was pleasant
[6:08] to the eyes and a tree to be desired to
[6:10] make this is where I want to get at and
[6:13] the tree to be desired to be to make one
[6:16] wise
[6:17] she took of the fruit thereof and did
[6:19] eat and gave unto her unto her husband
[6:22] with her and he did eat
[6:24] so you see look at the beginning you see
[6:26] God's word plain and clear do not eat of
[6:29] the tree right you see that
[6:31] Satan being subtle the one that he is he
[6:34] still is today he hasn't he hasn't
[6:36] changed much has he he's subtle amen he
[6:38] knows how to he knows how to get and see
[6:40] the the ever in the in the rooms that
[6:43] maybe you may not know of and it might
[6:45] you might not know he's working but
[6:48] knowing the devil in all of his tricks
[6:50] right that's how we're overcoming
[6:51] knowing the devil and all of his tricks
[6:53] amen same being civil he still is
[6:56] instead he injects his reasoning into
[6:59] Eve starting with the question hath God
[7:02] said You shall not eat of the tree of
[7:04] the garden
[7:06] he starts with that question he starts
[7:07] with that reasoning with with the truth
[7:10] right
[7:10] Eve has the truth she even says the
[7:13] truth to she even says she speaks it to
[7:16] Satan he's he's she says it but still
[7:19] there's the reasoning going on he starts
[7:21] asking questions he starts building that
[7:22] relationship with Eve
[7:24] Eve knowing the word responds with
[7:27] we may Eve the fruit of the tree of the
[7:29] garden but the fruit of the tree which
[7:31] is in the midst of the garden so
[7:33] he says it shall be as God's knowing
[7:36] good and evil you see that's
[7:39] see it's knowing good and evil what does
[7:42] that sound like sounds like the wisdom
[7:43] of the world right
[7:45] knowing Good and Evil
[7:47] wisdom versus faith
[7:50] this is a message
[7:52] now what is the wisdom we're talking
[7:54] about something that will not agree that
[7:57] that will not agree that all this word
[8:00] is the truth that something that will
[8:03] take away from this truth expressing
[8:05] itself is a higher knowledge more wisdom
[8:09] and if wisdom of that sort comes from
[8:11] Satan his children live by that wisdom
[8:14] and if the faith of God come through God
[8:17] and God is the word God's children lives
[8:20] on that faith
[8:22] amen the Bible says the just shall live
[8:25] by wisdom
[8:27] what does it say
[8:29] what does it say the just shall live by
[8:31] Faith amen
[8:33] it's the just shall live by faith not
[8:36] what he can learn but what he can't
[8:39] believe all right wisdom tries to take a
[8:42] better way the way a modern a way of
[8:45] popularity the easier way
[8:48] find itself it Finds Its loopholes as
[8:51] brother Rapp talked about last Wednesday
[8:52] night it finds loopholes right that
[8:55] wisdom the man's Wisdom talking about
[8:58] see this conflict between God's wisdom
[9:00] man's Wisdom right
[9:03] Satan interjecting his wisdom
[9:06] so
[9:07] just shall live by faith not what he can
[9:10] learn but what he can believe wisdom
[9:12] tries to take the better way tries to
[9:14] find loopholes wisdom says wisdom says
[9:17] man's Wisdom says we need to have a
[9:20] balance
[9:21] have you ever heard that term before but
[9:24] we gotta have a balance brother we gotta
[9:26] have a balance right I've heard that so
[9:28] many times by Believers I believe
[9:30] they're Believers but they it's that the
[9:33] excuse right we've got to have a balance
[9:36] so I can I can I can still listen to
[9:39] this music right I can still listen to
[9:41] it because we need to have a balance we
[9:43] can still we can still tamper with what
[9:46] what the devil what the devil's uh given
[9:49] us right
[9:50] so it's that wisdom of the world
[9:52] injecting itself right
[9:56] so
[9:57] we have that when the word
[10:00] wisdom says we need to have the balance
[10:02] when the word is the balance
[10:05] you believe the word is the balance amen
[10:07] wisdom may even be sincere but you can
[10:10] be sincerely wrong it must be truth amen
[10:14] praise the Lord and when and when the
[10:16] woman saw that the tree was good for
[10:18] food and that was pleasant to the eyes
[10:21] and the tree to be desired to make one
[10:23] why she took of the fruit and did eat
[10:26] and gave unto her wisdom with her and he
[10:28] did eat
[10:30] now we see the evidence of what
[10:33] reasoning with the word of God can do
[10:36] see I work in a hospital I see it I can
[10:39] witness it we can look around we don't
[10:41] have to look far to see where where
[10:43] man's Wisdom or Satan's wisdom has
[10:46] destroyed the Earth right we're
[10:49] destroying ourselves by it amen
[10:52] now we see the evidence of what
[10:53] reasoning with the word can do I work at
[10:56] a hospital I'm witnessing what that word
[10:58] added what that one word added did to
[11:02] the whole human race what reason started
[11:05] for the world it's good to go completely
[11:07] insane right without that word applied
[11:10] without that pure word nothing tainted
[11:13] nothing added to it right without that
[11:16] we're gone we're gone
[11:18] amen we need that word that pure word
[11:21] aren't you glad that word came back for
[11:23] us aren't you glad praise the Lord by
[11:26] God's grace he sent he sent
[11:29] he sent a prophet do you believe you
[11:31] believe he gave his word for this day
[11:33] amen so glad amen
[11:36] thank you Lord just his grace
[11:39] so we'll see it in every Church age of
[11:43] what reasoning what the word can do when
[11:45] the word comes Satan injects his
[11:47] perversion and man's reason and then
[11:50] comes fruit of dead religion
[11:54] we see it in the food we eat today
[11:57] we see in the food we injection on
[11:59] injection
[12:00] that everything we eat today may look so
[12:04] good tastes so good but destroys our
[12:06] bodies it's just it just happens we
[12:08] can't get avoid it we can't get around
[12:10] it it just happens but why because man
[12:12] has injection on injection on injection
[12:15] has destroyed it right
[12:18] so
[12:20] even our teeth
[12:23] even our teeth because of the things we
[12:25] eat we come out we come out with crooked
[12:28] teeth
[12:30] so we see in every Church age
[12:33] we see it in the food we eat
[12:37] um
[12:37] and what what does it all come back to
[12:39] it comes back to our stinking thinking
[12:42] right
[12:43] remember our pastor was talking about
[12:45] stinking thinking where did it start
[12:47] stinking thinking right
[12:49] amen it didn't line up with the word and
[12:51] what what like what our thoughts are
[12:53] going through that's not God's thoughts
[12:55] right
[12:56] amen
[12:58] so it goes to destroy our bodies it's
[13:00] hybrid because man's desire to know
[13:03] wisdom stink and think and look at where
[13:05] we're at today at today look around
[13:07] creation is groaning
[13:10] so no vaccine no supplement no gun no
[13:14] politician will protect or keep you from
[13:17] the pollution of this world of this
[13:19] world's wisdom but by faith in the word
[13:22] of God that's our protection that's what
[13:25] we look to do you believe that amen
[13:28] faith in the word of God it's infallible
[13:30] it can't fail right it's pure halleluia
[13:33] thank you Lord
[13:35] Jesus looking at the same temptation
[13:39] of worldly wisdom
[13:41] what is his response as it is written he
[13:44] uses the word to combat the enemy right
[13:47] you see him in the wilderness with the
[13:49] Devil he's offering all the
[13:51] organizations all the kings all all the
[13:54] all the kingdoms of the world but he
[13:56] says ad is as it is written man shall
[13:59] not live by bread alone but by every
[14:01] word that proceeds out of the mouth of
[14:02] God look at the difference by faith
[14:05] Jesus withstood the withstood the Enemy
[14:08] by the word amen
[14:10] wisdom versus faith I'm going to pull a
[14:13] lot from that tonight Satan tries to
[14:15] tempt Jesus from faith in the father's
[14:18] word here's what he did
[14:20] he tried to show him his great big
[14:22] ecclesiastic organizations of the Earth
[14:25] but he couldn't tempt him come over and
[14:28] join me I'll make the bishop over all of
[14:30] them
[14:31] but what does Jesus say it's written
[14:33] said Jesus yes yes sir Satan couldn't
[14:36] tempt him no sir he's just passed that
[14:39] but Jesus was the word his faith and the
[14:42] knowledge of himself that he was the
[14:45] word amen praise the Lord knowing who
[14:48] you are comes back to Identity right
[14:50] knowing who you are in Christ knowing
[14:53] what you have within you the word of God
[14:55] Amen as it is written we have the word
[14:57] we have the word applied amen
[14:59] praise God hallelujah
[15:02] amen
[15:04] the DVD of Christ there is a difference
[15:06] between reason and God's word God's word
[15:09] is true reason is false you can't reason
[15:12] out nothing that's right our mind is not
[15:15] see it's not good enough or never will
[15:17] be to Fathom God fathom God's Eternal
[15:20] wisdom and therefore you can't reason it
[15:23] you just got to believe amen it's in
[15:26] faith amen that's the difference that's
[15:28] the conflict it's Faith versus
[15:31] wisdom Faith versus man's Wisdom amen
[15:35] let no man deceive himself First
[15:37] Corinthians 3 18 18-21 let no man
[15:41] deceive himself if any man among you
[15:43] seemeth to be wise in this world let him
[15:45] be a fool that he may be wise
[15:50] for the wisdom of this world is
[15:51] foolishness of God for it is written he
[15:54] taketh the wise in their own craftiness
[15:57] and again the Lord knoweth the thoughts
[15:59] of the wise that they are vain
[16:02] amen back to wisdom versus faith
[16:05] if wisdom is with the word and proves to
[16:08] be with the word and the word produces
[16:11] itself I'm going to repeat this if
[16:13] wisdom is with the word this is what I'm
[16:15] trying to say tonight we've got to bring
[16:18] it back to the word all of our thoughts
[16:20] all of what we hear all the voices that
[16:23] come in it's got to be lined up exactly
[16:25] with what the word if it doesn't
[16:28] it's not right it's wrong amen if you
[16:30] can stay exactly with that word amen
[16:32] you're on the right track praise God
[16:35] if wisdom is with the word it proves to
[16:38] be with the word and the word produces
[16:41] Itself by the same thing then it is then
[16:44] it is the word but if wisdom is against
[16:46] the word
[16:48] and not with with the word but trying to
[16:51] find something to add to it or take from
[16:53] it it's the devil it's very simple it's
[16:56] almost like Black and White amen
[16:59] I love that when you can see scripture
[17:01] and it's just night and day right there
[17:03] amen praise God
[17:06] so God has true wisdom and Satan can
[17:08] only pervert right God has his wisdom
[17:11] right and all satan did was pervert that
[17:14] right he perverted it so you see the
[17:17] conflict man's Wisdom is foolish to God
[17:20] and God's Wisdom is foolish to man
[17:23] 's wisdom cannot comprehend or even
[17:26] fathom God's wisdom
[17:30] in the human fight in the human mind I
[17:33] love this and the human mind faith is
[17:35] absurd
[17:39] why would Abraham and Sarah being old
[17:42] even think they would have a son
[17:45] they're old in their A's why would they
[17:47] even think how can you even process that
[17:48] in your mind
[17:52] why
[17:53] why would Abraham and Sarah
[17:55] why would Abraham take his son as a
[17:57] sacrifice that's just absurd to think
[17:59] that you would take your own son up to a
[18:02] mountain
[18:03] put them on put them on some rocks and
[18:06] think that that's
[18:08] just crazy to the human mind right it's
[18:11] Faith though right comes back to Faith
[18:14] and the human mind faith is absurd why
[18:17] would Abraham take his son as a
[18:19] sacrifice why would Noah built build an
[18:22] ark
[18:23] why would Moses give up the pleasures of
[18:25] Egypt
[18:26] choosing to suffer the Affliction with
[18:29] the people
[18:31] how in the world because Israel passed
[18:34] through the Red Sea on dry land
[18:36] how could the walls of Jericho fall down
[18:38] when a group of people walked around it
[18:42] Hallelujah why would why was it Rahab
[18:46] spared
[18:47] the woman with a blood issue healed
[18:50] we talked about Ben Ben and Megan today
[18:53] having their son come home
[18:55] praise God it's by Faith by faith it's
[18:58] still it's still living today by Faith
[19:00] by faith we live amen praise God faith
[19:04] in the promised word amen hallelujah
[19:07] thank you God
[19:09] I love this why would God himself leave
[19:12] his throne and come down and indwell
[19:15] human flesh
[19:17] to pay the price for our sins
[19:20] why it was Faith he's had a word there
[19:23] was a sacrifice needed to be paid right
[19:25] there was a word by Faith In The Word of
[19:28] Promise God honors faith
[19:31] praise God
[19:34] praise the Lord amen I was just
[19:36] overwhelmed in my study today at that
[19:38] that thought that his faith God's faith
[19:41] coming down
[19:43] aren't you glad for it amen he saw you
[19:46] he saw you amen if it was just for one
[19:49] amen
[19:51] so he can catch what the importance of
[19:53] faith is in this conflict between man's
[19:56] Wisdom and God's wisdom
[19:59] Faith does not need to be worked up
[20:01] either it's simply taking God at his
[20:04] word amen we have his word amen take him
[20:07] at his word praise God
[20:09] back to First Corinthians
[20:11] chapter 2. if you want to turn with me
[20:21] it's Corinthians there it is
[20:32] First Corinthians chapter two
[20:37] I want to go down to
[20:39] by God hath revealed on them unto but
[20:43] verse 10 sorry but God hath revealed
[20:45] them unto us by his spirit for the
[20:48] spirit Spirit searcheth all things yea
[20:51] the Deep things of God for what man
[20:53] knoweth the things of man except or save
[20:57] the spirit of a man which is in him
[21:01] even so the things of God knoweth no man
[21:04] but the spirit of God
[21:06] so what is it now it's the spirit in the
[21:09] word over one or that connection
[21:11] now we have received not the spirit of
[21:13] the world but the spirit which of which
[21:15] is of god that we might know the things
[21:18] that are freely given us given to us of
[21:21] God
[21:22] which things also we speak not in The
[21:25] Words which man's Wisdom teaches but
[21:28] which the Holy Ghost teaches
[21:30] comparing spiritual things with
[21:32] spiritual but the natural man receiveth
[21:35] not the things of the spirit of God for
[21:37] they are foolish unto them neither can
[21:40] he know them
[21:42] but they are spiritually discerned but
[21:45] he that is spiritually judgeth all
[21:48] things yet he himself is judged of no
[21:51] man
[21:52] for who hath known the mind of the Lord
[21:56] that ye may instruct him but we have the
[21:59] mind of Christ
[22:00] we have the mind of Christ
[22:03] by a spirit we have the mind of Christ
[22:05] amen do you believe that praise the Lord
[22:09] man we have a Spirit by the mind we have
[22:12] his have the mind of Christ by the
[22:14] spirit
[22:16] my brethren could not speak unto you
[22:19] let me let me see where we're at here
[22:21] for we have for we have the mind of
[22:24] Christ but by the Spirit by the spirit
[22:27] we have access to the wisdom of God
[22:29] real wisdom
[22:31] it's not the false wisdom that I was
[22:33] talking about
[22:34] it's it's the wisdom of God we have
[22:37] access to it by that Spirit we have
[22:39] access to the mind of God by that spirit
[22:41] amen
[22:42] amen the spirit and the word are one
[22:45] will not disagree with the other so when
[22:48] tempted
[22:49] try the spirit or thought
[22:52] see if it lines up with the word if not
[22:54] then flee it resist the devil and he
[22:57] will flee
[23:01] thought comes in this is just an example
[23:03] thought comes in
[23:06] let me see here James
[23:09] let's see James 1 1 through 8 let's go
[23:12] to the scripture here
[23:27] let me just pull it up I'll just read it
[23:29] from here James the servant of God in
[23:31] the Lord Jesus Christ to the 12 tribes
[23:33] which are scattered abroad greeting
[23:36] my brother encountered all joy when you
[23:38] fall into diverse Temptation Temptations
[23:41] knowing this that the trying of your
[23:43] faith worketh patience thank you Lord
[23:45] but let patience have a perfect work
[23:47] that ye may be perfect and entire entire
[23:51] wanting nothing
[23:53] if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of
[23:56] God
[23:57] that giveth to giveth to all men
[24:00] liberally in a breadth not and it shall
[24:03] be given him
[24:05] but let him ask in faith where does it
[24:07] come back to it's Faith amen we're
[24:10] asking for God's wisdom and faith
[24:13] nothing wavering for he that wavereth is
[24:16] like a wave of seed driven With the Wind
[24:18] of tossed
[24:20] for let not that man think that he shall
[24:23] receive anything of the Lord
[24:25] a double-minded man is unstable in all
[24:28] his ways
[24:30] beloved let him ask in faith that's what
[24:32] I was getting at nothing wavering so
[24:35] wisdom
[24:36] Cometh From The Spirit right it's that
[24:39] spirit that dwells in us that gives us
[24:41] give us gives us the wisdom First
[24:43] Corinthians 2
[24:45] 1-11
[24:47] First Corinthians 12 1-11
[24:51] so we're looking back
[24:53] in First Corinthians
[24:55] 12
[24:57] which I found this
[24:59] so good today
[25:02] I'm not talking about because a lot of
[25:03] times we can
[25:05] we can uh I don't know get worked up in
[25:07] our young Christian walk about about
[25:10] Lord is is this the way is I need to
[25:13] speak in tongues or what needs to happen
[25:15] for me what's the evidence of the Holy
[25:17] Ghost what's what needs to happen right
[25:19] and we make certain things priorities in
[25:22] our mind of what needs to needs to
[25:24] happen right I remember brother Rapp
[25:26] talking about it we have this certain
[25:27] expectation we start we start um we
[25:30] start comparing our experiences with one
[25:33] another right and that's not it it's all
[25:35] the Lord's doing right you may not even
[25:37] know when the Lord started to work in
[25:39] your life amen but it was it started to
[25:42] work amen he's faithful to complete it
[25:44] do you believe that amen praise the Lord
[25:48] so it was just a first first Corinthians
[25:51] 12.
[25:52] and now concerning spiritual gifts
[25:55] rather than I would not have you
[25:57] ignorant you know that you were Gentiles
[25:59] carried away into the dumb idols
[26:03] even as you were LED wherefore I give
[26:05] you unto understanding
[26:07] that no man speaking by the spirit of
[26:10] God call us Jesus accursed and that no
[26:13] man can say that Jesus is the Lord but
[26:16] by the Holy Ghost
[26:19] now there are diversities of gifts by
[26:22] The Same Spirit and there are
[26:23] differences of administrations by the
[26:26] same Lord
[26:27] but the same Lord
[26:29] and there are diversities of operations
[26:31] but is the same God would work with in
[26:34] all in all
[26:35] but the manifestations of the spirit is
[26:37] given to every man to profit with all
[26:41] four to one so here it goes through them
[26:43] for to one is given by the spirit the
[26:46] word of wisdom to one the word of
[26:48] knowledge by The Same Spirit it's all by
[26:51] The Same Spirit here right
[26:53] to another to another Faith by The Same
[26:56] Spirit to another the gifts of healing
[26:58] by The Same Spirit to another the
[27:00] working of Miracles to another
[27:02] prophecy to another Discerning of
[27:05] spirits to another diverse kinds of
[27:06] tongues to another the interpretation of
[27:09] tongues but all these worketh the one
[27:12] and the self-same spirit
[27:15] dividing to every man severally as he
[27:18] will
[27:19] for as the body is one
[27:22] and hath many members and all the
[27:24] members of that one body being many are
[27:27] one body so also is Christ for by one
[27:31] spirit it's by one Spirit right one
[27:34] Spirit we are all baptized into one body
[27:37] whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether
[27:39] we be bound or free and have been all
[27:42] made to drink unto unto one spirit
[27:45] amen praise the Lord
[27:48] amen
[27:50] and God keeps his word talking about
[27:54] every Church getting getting every
[27:56] Church age getting it wrong after the
[27:58] word comes amen it's just the repeat of
[28:00] self of History
[28:02] and God gave them the smallest gift this
[28:04] is Pentecost God gave them the smallest
[28:06] gift this is back this is back before
[28:09] the bride age
[28:11] but God God gave them the smallest gifts
[28:14] and there were and they organized it
[28:15] says looky here the first gift in the
[28:18] line of gifts is wisdom the second is
[28:21] knowledge and if you don't have any
[28:22] wisdom how do you know what to do with
[28:25] knowledge
[28:27] seek the best thing first wisdom and if
[28:29] you got in if in it and if you ain't got
[28:32] wisdom what can you do with knowledge or
[28:35] speaking with tongues or these other
[28:37] things it takes wisdom it takes God's
[28:39] wisdom Solomon said call it your mother
[28:42] right
[28:43] amen
[28:45] so that was just exciting to me because
[28:49] it um we get so worked up with man Lord
[28:52] I got to do this I got to do this but
[28:53] with wisdom being the principal thing as
[28:56] Proverbs talks about wisdom is the
[28:59] principle of things in Proverbs first
[29:00] four and seven wisdom is the principle
[29:02] thing therefore get wisdom and with all
[29:05] thy getting get understanding but it's
[29:07] wisdom is the principle thing and we're
[29:09] not talking about man's Wisdom here
[29:11] we're talking about the wisdom of God
[29:12] Amen it's by faith we receive it
[29:16] wisdom Proverbs 1
[29:20] we'll go back to Proverbs 1 20-33
[29:30] it even please please God when when King
[29:33] Solomon asks for wisdom and this says
[29:36] the speech pleased the Lord that Solomon
[29:39] had asked these things Solomon asked for
[29:41] wisdom and it pleased the Lord that he
[29:43] asked this he didn't ask for riches he
[29:45] didn't ask for those outward things he
[29:47] didn't ask for anything else he asked
[29:49] for the wisdom of God Amen
[29:52] praise the Lord
[29:54] so we're back in Proverbs one
[29:58] hope you're catching something tonight
[30:03] Proverbs 1
[30:05] and verse
[30:08] I was one in verse 20.
[30:10] I just love how was uh Solomon puts this
[30:14] out him wisdom cryeth without she
[30:17] uttereth her voice in the streets
[30:18] streets
[30:20] she crieth in the chief place in The
[30:22] Concourse and the openings of the gates
[30:25] in the city she uttereth her words
[30:27] saying how long ye simple ones will you
[30:30] love simplicity
[30:33] it's wisdom calling out it wants you
[30:36] right it's God's wisdom calling out it
[30:38] wants you more than anything
[30:40] how long were these simple ones will you
[30:42] love Simplicity in the scorner's Delight
[30:44] in the scorning and Fool's hate
[30:45] knowledge turn you at my reproof behold
[30:48] I will pour out my spirit unto you
[30:51] I will make known my words unto you
[30:55] because I have called because I have
[30:57] called and ye refused and have stretched
[30:59] out my hand and no man regarded
[31:03] but ye have sat at night on my counsel
[31:05] and would none of my reproof I also
[31:08] laugh this is what wisdom is doing here
[31:10] I will laugh at your calamity
[31:13] I will laugh at your destruction because
[31:15] wisdom offering itself right wisdom
[31:19] and this is God speaking right it's
[31:21] God's wisdom one wanting wanting you to
[31:24] abide by the word of God right
[31:26] but
[31:27] also he will laugh he wisdom will laugh
[31:30] at your Calamity I will mock when your
[31:32] fear cometh
[31:35] we have Security in his word right
[31:38] but wisdom's laughing like it offers it
[31:40] to you but it it laughs because we're
[31:43] not we're not catching it right we're
[31:46] not latching hold of it we let
[31:47] distractions and other things take take
[31:49] take preeminence
[31:52] but it offers it
[31:55] when the 27 when you fear when your fear
[31:58] cometh as desolation your destruction
[32:00] cometh as a whirlwind when distress and
[32:02] anguish come upon you then shall thou
[32:05] call upon me
[32:06] but I will not answer thy shall seek me
[32:08] early but Thou shalt not find me
[32:11] and on
[32:13] let me see here
[32:15] where was I here 29 okay for that they
[32:19] hated knowledge and did not choose the
[32:20] fear of the Lord and what is the fear of
[32:22] the Lord it's the beginning of wisdom
[32:25] amen they would they would none of my
[32:28] counsel they despised all my reproof
[32:30] therefore shall they eat of the fruit of
[32:33] their own way and be filled with their
[32:35] own devices
[32:37] you can word that use that word
[32:39] interchangeably too filled with their
[32:41] own devices
[32:42] for the Turning Away of the simple shall
[32:45] slay them and the prosperity of fools
[32:48] shall destroy them
[32:50] but listen but whoso hearkeneth unto me
[32:53] shall dwell safely and shall be quiet
[32:57] from fear of evil there's no fear
[33:01] there's no fear when we have the word of
[33:04] God right there's no fear when we have
[33:06] that right and I believe any holy
[33:09] ghost-filled believer amen who has who
[33:11] has that within them amen he has that he
[33:15] has that and he there's no fear with
[33:17] that right he has that wisdom dwelling
[33:20] Within
[33:23] let me keep going here
[33:25] so make your decision now that it's
[33:27] going to be God's wisdom that you're
[33:29] going to trust not your own thinking if
[33:32] you'll do that you'll never go wrong
[33:35] amen that's a time of decision that's a
[33:38] quote

[34:56] from God who knows wisdom all the wisdom
[34:59] and all the schooling everything was
[35:01] laid to waste
[35:04] and bypassed by the great wisdom of God
[35:06] I keep repeating that because I want it
[35:09] to go down deep
[35:11] all laid to waste it was no good
[35:14] bypassed it all to let God's wisdom have
[35:18] the right of way that God takes the
[35:20] nothings and makes the something say

[36:20] this
[36:21] I guess I get so much in my mind as far
[36:24] as my you know my thinking and my
[36:26] reasoning right and that's what my my
[36:28] dad's been talking about is stinking
[36:30] thinking right and so many things that
[36:32] can filter what what is our filter
[36:35] what is our true filter the word of God

[36:50] thing amen

[37:12] hearing um brother rap He was talking
[37:14] about um like the security or the the
[37:16] faith we have in Christ but he was
[37:19] talking about your faith and I have got
[37:21] report after report of people just
[37:23] feeling so anchored after what he's
[37:25] preached about the Holy Ghost amen
[37:28] as we look at we look around and see
[37:29] what's happening maybe in a service of
[37:31] what's going on but amen it's just that
[37:34] security so we think brother rap and man
[37:36] and just him surrendering his word
[37:38] surrendering his his lips to his vessel
[37:40] to God Amen
[37:42] amen seven
[37:44] golden candlesticks this is from the
[37:47] fusion Church age
[37:49] um the Expedition here so the very end
[37:52] of the quote seven golden candle skits
[37:55] candlesticks and exodus 25
[37:59] 31 and it says and thou shalt make a
[38:02] Candlestick a pure gold of beaten
[38:05] work shall the Candlestick be made
[38:09] his shaft and his branches his bows his
[38:12] knobs and his flowers shall be of the
[38:14] same the true church now listen up the
[38:18] True Church of Jesus Christ the bride is
[38:21] likened to pure gold
[38:24] her righteousness is his righteousness
[38:26] her attributes is his own glorious
[38:30] attributes
[38:31] her identity is found in him
[38:34] what he is she is to reflect
[38:38] but he has what he has she is to
[38:42] manifest there is no fault in her
[38:46] she is all glorious within and without
[38:49] from beginning to end she is the work of
[38:52] the Lord hallelujah and all his works
[38:55] are perfect
[38:56] listen in fact in her is summed up and
[39:01] manifested the Eternal wisdom and
[39:03] purpose of God so that wisdom
[39:06] is already in you with this seed it's
[39:08] already in you all it needs to do is be
[39:10] expressed amen it's already in you it
[39:13] just you just gotta look in the mirror
[39:14] of his word and see it amen praise the
[39:17] Lord hallelujah
[39:19] thank you Lord
[39:21] so he says
[39:24] he says where was I here
[39:26] um in fact in her is summed up and
[39:29] manifests these Eternal wisdom and
[39:31] purpose of God how can one fathom it
[39:34] how can one understand it though we
[39:37] cannot do that we can accept it by faith
[39:40] for God hath spoken it right God has
[39:43] spoken it but not only is the
[39:46] candlestick
[39:47] of gold
[39:50] it is of beaten gold
[39:52] hand crafted of beaten gold according to
[39:55] the blueprints which is Spirit given
[39:58] outside of her Lord and Master Jesus
[40:01] Christ was ever was ever was ever a
[40:04] people so beat and encouraged as the
[40:06] Bride of Jesus Christ
[40:09] surely she is filling up she is filling
[40:12] up the sufferings that Christ has left
[40:14] behind
[40:15] her good is despoiled her life
[40:18] her life is in Jeopardy she is accounted
[40:22] as sheep for the slaughter
[40:23] she has killed all the day long
[40:26] she suffers much but it all retaliates
[40:30] not neither does she cause others to
[40:33] suffer
[40:34] worthy of the Gospel is the lovely bride
[40:37] of Christ
[40:38] and as gold is malleable whereas brass
[40:41] will break with a beating this gold of
[40:44] God will bear her suffering for the Lord
[40:48] not bowed not broken not destroyed but
[40:52] formed as a thing of beauty and of Joy
[40:55] Forever by the trials and testing of
[40:57] this life amen
[40:59] I believe the two ways two main ways we
[41:02] we get wisdom from God is this the
[41:05] building of character through testing
[41:07] and trial what is God what is God doing
[41:09] when he gives you a trial right he's
[41:11] establishing he's making that wisdom
[41:13] come out what is what what am I how do I
[41:16] react to certain situations right and by
[41:18] the word of God he gives us his word he
[41:21] gives us the word of his of of our day
[41:24] to to establish our wisdom in him right
[41:28] amen I could prove by the Bible that
[41:32] you're not in your right mind till you
[41:33] have found Christ that's right
[41:35] that's pretty strong but I can prove
[41:37] that by the scripture that's right you
[41:40] become beastly lustful in everything
[41:41] until you found Christ Jesus
[41:46] he's the lovely one
[41:49] I love this this is my last scripture
[41:51] here or this is my last quote here this
[41:53] is the questions and answers I just
[41:54] thought this was beautiful I hope it
[41:56] encourages you tonight now I'll admit
[41:58] that people study too much they think
[42:00] about it too much they tried to go as
[42:03] far ahead and try to think too hard
[42:05] sometimes have mental breakdowns at the
[42:08] things on account of studying about the
[42:10] Lord you must quit that you don't have
[42:13] to do that the only thing you have to do
[42:15] is fall in love with him
[42:18] Hallelujah
[42:20] and just go right on loving him amen
[42:24] it's not trying to push into something
[42:25] or make something make yourself
[42:28] something you're not
[42:29] just go ahead and let God use you in the
[42:32] way he wants to
[42:34] just yield yourself
[42:36] commit yourself and walk walk on Happy
[42:41] singing rejoicing that's the way amen
[42:44] fall in love with Jesus Christ amen
[42:46] that's where your wisdom wise that's the
[42:48] beginning the fear of the fear of the
[42:50] Lord is the beginning of wisdom amen if
[42:52] you love them amen you have a reverent
[42:54] storm toward them you fear Him amen
[42:57] praise God Amen that's all I have for
[43:00] you tonight it was a short message but I
[43:02] hope you were you were encouraged
[43:04] tonight amen we can't rely on the wisdom
