[0:00] bibles to first for samuel
[0:03] 17. familiar scripture reading but
[0:07] when brother brother paul had just
[0:12] spoke to me about coming here i think it
[0:15] was maybe back in january or
[0:18] somewhere when i was looking there and
[0:19] just as just getting off the phone and
[0:22] the lord just seemed to just drop
[0:24] just dropped this thought and it's just
[0:25] been been building so
[0:28] i want to just just take here in first
[0:30] samuel 17 and this is
[0:33] here where david there is coming into
[0:37] a face-off where goliath has
[0:40] is coming to against the the israel
[0:44] or the army of israel and here in verse
[0:46] 20 if we can start and read there
[0:50] the bible said david rose up early in
[0:52] the morning and left the sheep with the
[0:54] keeper
[0:55] and took and went as jesse had commanded
[0:57] him
[0:58] and he came to the trench as the host
[1:00] was going forth to the fight
[1:02] and he shouted for the battle for israel
[1:06] and the philistines had put the battle
[1:08] in a ray
[1:09] army against army and david left his
[1:12] carriage
[1:13] in the hand of the keeper of the
[1:14] carriage and ran into the army
[1:17] and came and saluted his brethren
[1:20] and as he talked with them behold there
[1:22] came up the champion
[1:24] the philistine of gath goliath by name
[1:27] out of the armies of the philistines and
[1:29] spake according to the same words
[1:32] and david heard them and all the men of
[1:35] israel
[1:36] when they saw the man fled from him and
[1:40] were sore
[1:41] afraid and the men of israel said have
[1:43] you seen this man that has come up
[1:46] surely to defy israel as he come up and
[1:49] it shall be that the man who killeth him
[1:51] the king will enrich him with great
[1:53] riches
[1:54] and will give him his daughter and make
[1:57] his father's
[1:58] house free in israel it's amazing they
[2:01] knew
[2:02] the promises that was made in
[2:05] the made in order to remove this man
[2:08] who's defying the armies
[2:10] but they lacked the courage to obtain
[2:13] those promises
[2:15] and david spake to the men and stood by
[2:17] him that stood by him saying
[2:18] what shall be done to the man that
[2:20] killeth this philistine
[2:22] and taketh away the reproach from israel
[2:25] for who is this uncircumcised philistine
[2:28] that he should defy the armies of the
[2:31] living god
[2:32] the people answered him after this
[2:34] manner saying so shall it be done to the
[2:36] man that killeth him
[2:38] and then verse 28 it speaks how his
[2:41] brother they heard when he spake unto
[2:43] the men and
[2:44] alab's anger was was kindled against
[2:46] david and said why came us down hither
[2:48] and with whom hast thou left those few
[2:51] sheep in the wilderness
[2:53] i know thy pride and the naughtiness of
[2:55] thine heart
[2:56] for thou art come down that thou mighty
[2:58] see the battle
[2:59] and david said what have i now done
[3:03] is there not a cause and he turned from
[3:06] him toward another and spake after the
[3:08] same manner and the people answered him
[3:10] again
[3:11] after the former manner may god bless
[3:13] the reading of the word as you're being
[3:15] seated tonight
[3:17] i'd like to just speak on a on a little
[3:19] thought take just a few moments and
[3:21] speak on the thought
[3:22] of run to the battle run
[3:26] to the battle when we look on a little
[3:29] further here in the same
[3:31] same chapter that we are reading here
[3:34] and we see this this engagement that has
[3:37] taken place
[3:38] we find that how that here the men they
[3:41] they bring they bring david to saul and
[3:44] saul begins to
[3:46] ask ask of david concerning what he said
[3:48] and david just
[3:49] quickly speaks out let no man's heart
[3:53] fear don't let it fail him because thy
[3:56] servant will go
[3:57] and fight this philistine they they
[3:59] needed
[4:00] courage and you know when you when you
[4:02] look at this
[4:03] they they were the the covenant people
[4:07] of god
[4:08] but they had they had gotten away from
[4:11] that
[4:11] reality of the living god and they
[4:14] needed
[4:14] courage and you know many times when we
[4:17] look at just you think of the word
[4:18] itself
[4:19] encouragement you know there's an awful
[4:21] big word stuck in the middle there
[4:23] courage and there's sometimes in order
[4:25] for that courage
[4:26] there needs to be some right
[4:29] encouragement
[4:30] and so here when as they come back in
[4:33] here
[4:34] saul begins to evaluate and look at
[4:36] david and he begins to
[4:38] just look at what he sees on the outside
[4:41] you're you know you're nothing but a
[4:42] youth and
[4:43] and this philistine he's uh you know
[4:46] you're no match for him but you see
[4:48] remember how
[4:50] saul was chosen saul was not
[4:53] chosen by by a substance of what was in
[4:56] him saul was chosen based on stature
[5:00] and so here saul was only reflecting of
[5:03] what he himself
[5:04] had had went by and been chosen by by
[5:06] what what could be
[5:08] seen on the outside but you see god
[5:11] doesn't
[5:11] choose a man based on his abilities
[5:14] if god would have had a man let's say if
[5:17] david would have been a man that was
[5:19] just as tall
[5:20] as saul or even taller it would have not
[5:23] highlighted who was
[5:25] back in the camp but god specializes
[5:29] in choosing a man choosing people
[5:33] who are not qualified for what god
[5:36] is calling them to do but when god makes
[5:39] a promise
[5:40] god has therefore he has subjects
[5:43] in mind that he is going to bring to
[5:47] himself
[5:48] and that god will fulfill that promise
[5:51] through his life you've heard it said
[5:53] before god does not
[5:54] call call the qualified but he calls
[5:58] those who are
[5:59] unqualified but he qualifies them
[6:02] with himself and to find that how that
[6:06] god
[6:07] you know david would just kind of begin
[6:09] to rehearse here
[6:10] in the presence of saul and and begin to
[6:13] speak about you know the testimony that
[6:15] had
[6:15] been upon his life and and david you
[6:18] know as he speaks about this he speaks
[6:20] of how
[6:21] that when he was you know watching the
[6:23] sheep and here was a
[6:25] lion that had come in and a bear had
[6:27] come in
[6:28] and and david speaks of how it was right
[6:31] out of the mouth
[6:32] of those lion right out of the mouth of
[6:35] the bear
[6:36] that he went and he took that you know
[6:38] it wasn't that the lamb itself
[6:40] was was out there running around in the
[6:42] line where bear was after it
[6:44] but it was actually in the mouth of that
[6:47] predator
[6:48] but david was at a place oh my
[6:51] david was testifying that he says nobody
[6:55] can say it's over or it's finished or
[6:58] you've
[6:58] passed beyond redemption god can come
[7:02] right down and he'll snatch you right
[7:04] out of the mouth of the lion
[7:06] he'll snatch you right out of the mouth
[7:08] of the bear there might be
[7:10] situations and things that can be
[7:12] present in a life that you can look at
[7:14] and say
[7:15] i don't know how i'm going to get
[7:17] through this but it's
[7:18] not beyond god there is
[7:22] nothing impossible with god and that's
[7:25] what david was testifying
[7:27] where others would have said hey it's
[7:29] already in the mouth
[7:30] let it go you know how people want to
[7:32] say hey it's already passed
[7:34] just let it go but david what was this
[7:37] this was
[7:37] more than the natural genetics of a man
[7:42] this was a pulsation of almighty god
[7:45] that even when the fall took place in
[7:48] eden
[7:48] god himself didn't throw in the towel he
[7:51] came down
[7:52] and said i will make a way
[7:56] back hallelujah
[7:59] and here there's a testimony that david
[8:02] is
[8:02] ushering in at that time he said who is
[8:05] this uncircumcised
[8:07] philistine he recognized the weakness
[8:09] where the rest of them
[8:11] were all caught up and they were talking
[8:13] about
[8:14] his size and his stature and where
[8:16] everything was but
[8:17] david looked at the vulnerability he's
[8:20] an
[8:21] uncircumcised philistine and he's
[8:23] defying the armies of the living god
[8:26] let me just say this david was a body
[8:29] ministry man
[8:30] david was looking at it if god did it
[8:33] for a lamb
[8:34] god will do it for the whole body david
[8:37] was identifying he's
[8:38] god of the entire church he's god of the
[8:41] entire body
[8:42] he's not just god in the pulpit he's god
[8:45] in the kitchen
[8:46] he's god in the factory worker he's god
[8:49] and mama
[8:50] he's god and daddy he was identifying
[8:53] that god is the same god
[8:56] oh my you see david he had an
[9:00] experience and a testimony that he could
[9:02] say
[9:03] the lord what god did there god will do
[9:06] the same thing here
[9:12] time doesn't take away from that
[9:15] situations don't take away from that i
[9:18] don't care what viruses come
[9:20] it doesn't change i'm still the lord
[9:23] that healeth all thy diseases
[9:28] we're not we don't act arrogant about it
[9:30] we don't pretend that it ain't there
[9:32] because that ain't faith
[9:33] but faith says yes it's here but god
[9:36] is greater so david wasn't ignoring the
[9:41] circumstances
[9:42] the circumstances were there but he was
[9:44] letting them know
[9:45] that god is greater than the
[9:48] circumstances
[9:51] david had an experience with god that he
[9:54] was relying on
[9:57] you see david knew
[10:00] he knew he was blessed of god before he
[10:02] was ever anointed
[10:05] david had he had this confidence
[10:08] the god's love to him it was real to him
[10:12] think of how god would let him know that
[10:14] that i brought you from the sheep coat
[10:17] god would let him know where he brought
[10:19] him from
[10:20] you know where god brought you from you
[10:23] didn't bring yourself
[10:24] i didn't bring myself god brought you
[10:27] god drew you or you might have been
[10:29] sitting on a church pill but it had to
[10:31] be the living god
[10:33] to draw your heart and begin to stir it
[10:36] and
[10:36] stimulate it and draw it to himself
[10:42] this is why when the scriptures we speak
[10:44] of this
[10:45] of a real positive experience and a
[10:47] sheer testimony
[10:48] this is why paul would express to
[10:51] examine ourselves
[10:53] whether we be in the faith to prove
[10:55] ourselves
[10:57] it's to examine with everything that we
[10:59] face
[11:00] in life even with the situation that
[11:03] arose last year
[11:05] you recognize that we appreciate
[11:07] doctrines
[11:08] but doctrines don't give you safety
[11:10] there's one place of safety and
[11:12] that's in him that's our
[11:16] anchor that's our stabilizer that's our
[11:19] whole
[11:20] that's what gives us vision beyond these
[11:22] circumstances
[11:25] david was able to draw from this and i
[11:28] think
[11:28] of the time that we're living in you
[11:30] know brother branham would say it he
[11:32] would say it in this manner
[11:34] he would say you better get into christ
[11:36] and get
[11:37] sure in your heart right now because
[11:40] there's a time
[11:40] coming where you're really going to need
[11:42] it
[11:44] there's a time to know that you know
[11:46] that you know
[11:47] that you know where you're standing
[11:51] it's not just in moments of crisis it's
[11:53] even in decisions of life that you
[11:56] have before you you have to know where
[11:58] you're standing
[11:59] and to know that god is on my side
[12:02] [Music]
[12:04] here was the spirit we think of this run
[12:07] to the battle you know paul said it like
[12:09] this
[12:11] paul said if the trumpet give an
[12:14] uncertain sound
[12:16] who shall prepare himself
[12:19] to the battle and you know
[12:22] all around us the things that we
[12:25] are witness and we see even what has
[12:29] compiled with even in
[12:30] this past year we've seen we've seen
[12:34] how god how that even in his word where
[12:37] we're standing we
[12:38] we see that even where jesus we we see
[12:40] the things taking place around us and
[12:42] jesus would say
[12:44] when you begin to see these things
[12:46] taking place lift up your head
[12:48] your redemption draws nigh we know these
[12:51] are things in
[12:52] the word that's promised to come about
[12:54] men's hearts would be failing
[12:56] for fear we see these things we see
[12:59] even how god we recognize in this
[13:02] generation how god
[13:04] would come down in this generation and
[13:07] would veil himself
[13:08] in his word how god would speak through
[13:11] his prophet
[13:12] and god would declare his promises and
[13:14] god would make that word
[13:16] real to you and i he would vindicate it
[13:19] to his children that's where we would
[13:21] draw comfort from
[13:23] in this hour we would draw encouragement
[13:26] from that
[13:26] it would stabilize you and i
[13:29] there's a lot of uncertainty in the
[13:32] world
[13:33] there's a lot of things in the world as
[13:35] brother brown would say
[13:36] so many voices and i tell you what in
[13:39] this hour that we're living in there's
[13:41] all kinds of voices
[13:42] but let me just say this for every voice
[13:45] that's out there
[13:46] god has given the bride of jesus christ
[13:49] a word
[13:49] filter there's one voice that we're to
[13:52] be locked in on and that's the voice of
[13:54] the holy ghost
[13:55] and the voice of the holy spirit will
[13:57] discern every devil
[13:59] it'll keep you from traps and getting
[14:02] sucked in
[14:03] to the things of this life and keep us
[14:05] lined up
[14:06] and ready and looking to the coming of
[14:08] the lord
[14:10] it's a certain voice it gives us
[14:12] stability
[14:13] it gives us strength because it's been a
[14:15] certain sound
[14:19] brandon would say it you know like this
[14:22] when we look at it he says
[14:23] there's only one certain sound that's
[14:26] the gospel
[14:27] prepare for the battle what battle
[14:31] the coming of the lord prepare yourself
[14:35] for battle now
[14:36] against evil when evil is besetting the
[14:39] people
[14:40] on every hand everything going wrong
[14:43] home life
[14:44] going wrong you in failing nations
[14:46] breaking
[14:47] atomic bombs around home splitting up
[14:50] motherhood going low
[14:51] immorals among the people distrust
[14:54] amongst one another
[14:55] denominations fussing and stewing what
[14:57] what what you want to do
[14:59] be certain prepare yourself for
[15:02] the battle if there's ever a time in
[15:06] an hour to be prepared for the battle
[15:09] it's right now we're not coming to a
[15:12] battle
[15:13] we're in a battle i tell you every every
[15:16] demon out of hell
[15:18] has been released it's right here
[15:21] moving and trying to approach in those
[15:24] same ecclesiastical
[15:26] spirits that were bound there at the
[15:28] river euphrates
[15:29] they've been released but that's not the
[15:31] end of the story
[15:32] the very first very first word in
[15:35] revelations 10
[15:36] and i saw another mighty
[15:40] angel that's what i want to focus on
[15:44] that's what i'm counting on right there
[15:49] hear god vindicating his word
[15:53] vindicating his word by his presence in
[15:56] our midst
[15:57] it's a sound that sounds out in our
[15:59] heart you know
[16:00] you can set and sit right in in it right
[16:04] next to somebody else
[16:05] and somebody else it just goes right by
[16:08] them
[16:08] but there's something to you it's
[16:11] different
[16:13] there's a sound to it it's just as
[16:15] though that it's just
[16:16] you and god right in this building
[16:21] you're hearing straight as god is just
[16:23] speaking to your life god is unfolding
[16:26] the things of your life and he's
[16:28] ministering so personally to your life
[16:30] let me just tell you something if you
[16:32] want to know let me tell you a young
[16:33] person
[16:34] if you want to know whether god cares
[16:35] about you or not
[16:37] look how god comes right to your pew he
[16:39] comes right to your seat
[16:41] and he deals with your life listen don't
[16:43] don't hide your head in shame
[16:45] just look to the lord and say god you're
[16:48] expressing your love what do i do
[16:50] surrender to his voice he's
[16:53] letting you know he loves you he cares
[16:56] about you
[16:59] this is why when jesus says he could say
[17:01] my
[17:02] sheep they hear my voice they know me
[17:05] and they follow me hallelujah
[17:08] you see in this hour forgive me but
[17:12] i'm just going to just kind of be myself
[17:14] if that's all right
[17:16] you see they there's a need
[17:19] and you can find that here israel
[17:22] they're in a state
[17:23] of defeat and we look at it that
[17:26] they're holding to well we still believe
[17:29] in god
[17:30] and do you believe that god is the same
[17:32] well yeah we believe that god's the same
[17:34] but do it so what's what is ironic is
[17:37] that how a person can say
[17:39] we believe that god is the same but they
[17:41] don't want him to be the same
[17:43] god he's the same god of his word
[17:47] his nature he's never changed
[17:50] what he did before he still does
[17:54] tonight he's never changed one bit
[17:57] but you see it's not a god of theology
[18:00] he is the living god of his word
[18:03] that he comes and he confirms that word
[18:06] in our midst
[18:07] he reveals himself to be the same god
[18:10] to be the living god and that's what
[18:13] calms
[18:15] and gives strength to us as believers
[18:18] that's what encourages your eye
[18:22] is when he comes and he begins to take
[18:24] that word
[18:25] and begins to speak to our hearts that's
[18:28] what the church of the living god that's
[18:30] what we look to
[18:31] because that's what's really positive
[18:34] that's what's really certain
[18:35] but you think of that we we think here
[18:38] in in the scripture
[18:39] that we're very familiar with of hebrews
[18:41] 13 8 jesus christ is the same
[18:44] yesterday today and forever i think the
[18:46] greatest thing we can do is just welcome
[18:48] him and say god you be god
[18:50] lord jesus be the same one right here do
[18:53] the same thing lord in my life same
[18:56] thing in my home
[18:57] same thing in my church be the same god
[19:00] lord
[19:03] jesus when here as we look at this of
[19:06] the certainty of the word
[19:09] you know jesus said heaven and earth
[19:12] will pass away but my words will not
[19:15] pass away
[19:17] i think of like the uh the the
[19:20] the black brother brother branham would
[19:22] refer to on that scripture he said
[19:25] the brother had said i would rather be
[19:26] standing on the word
[19:28] than on the world i'd rather be standing
[19:32] on the word
[19:33] than in heaven because the scripture has
[19:35] said heavens
[19:37] and earth will pass away but
[19:40] my word shall never fail
[19:44] amen is that right so there's there's an
[19:46] assurance upon that word
[19:49] and here even in isaiah said the grass
[19:52] withereth the flower fadeth
[19:54] but the word of our god shall stand
[19:57] forever
[19:59] hallelujah numbers 23 god is not a man
[20:02] that he should lie
[20:03] neither the son of man that he should
[20:05] repent hath he said
[20:07] and shall not he do it hath he spoken
[20:10] shall not he make good behold i have
[20:13] received commandment to bless
[20:15] and he hath blessed and i cannot reverse
[20:18] it
[20:18] david would say the testimony of the
[20:21] lord
[20:22] is sure the law of the lord is perfect
[20:25] converting the soul he would go on to
[20:28] say
[20:29] my covenant will i not break nor alter
[20:32] the thing that's gone out of my mouth
[20:34] solomon would utter every word of god is
[20:37] pure you see it's one thing
[20:42] as we can look at those promises god has
[20:45] given us
[20:46] his word when god gives his word
[20:49] that's god obligating himself
[20:53] it's god obligating himself the promise
[20:56] to
[20:56] every generation of promises here in his
[20:59] word
[21:00] god is obligating himself to his word
[21:03] and he out how the god when he speaks
[21:06] that word
[21:06] god will provide everything that's
[21:09] needed
[21:10] for you and i to come into that place to
[21:13] where
[21:13] the word and us are not two separate
[21:16] things
[21:17] but where the word and us become the
[21:19] same thing
[21:21] so the word itself it now moves from a
[21:24] letter
[21:24] till it becomes open it becomes an
[21:27] entrance
[21:27] way for you and i this is how
[21:31] we come to this in running to the battle
[21:34] coming to a place where as we're
[21:36] standing
[21:37] on god's word god's always had this
[21:40] preparation
[21:41] and the word the word is the very weapon
[21:44] that god has given his children to face
[21:47] the enemy
[21:48] to defend his attacks and to conquer him
[21:53] we're not just to be defending off his
[21:55] attacks
[21:57] we've got the sword there's times where
[22:00] we do have to defend off the tax
[22:02] but let's make sure that we're also
[22:04] standing there
[22:05] and reminding him he is a defeated
[22:09] foe it doesn't matter how we feel
[22:12] doesn't matter what we're going through
[22:14] you may not even be able to get the
[22:15] words out of here
[22:16] but you can say it from right here satan
[22:19] i don't care
[22:20] you're still defeated
[22:25] hallelujah amen
[22:28] goliath's attack on the army of the
[22:31] living god
[22:32] it was an attack on the word of god
[22:36] david was standing there you see david
[22:39] here he is standing in a place and david
[22:43] is standing upon the word
[22:45] he he already knew he was blessed before
[22:47] he was ever anointed
[22:49] but now here he is standing here within
[22:52] the word
[22:52] and david just simply believed and he
[22:55] knew
[22:56] god was the same god you didn't have to
[22:58] tell david
[22:59] hey god is the same god that parted the
[23:01] red sea he
[23:02] knew god was the same god that's what
[23:06] david was a witness of it was not
[23:08] historical facts it wasn't quotes to
[23:12] david
[23:13] david knew that god was the same god
[23:16] he knew what god had promised in his
[23:18] word and he's acting upon those promises
[23:21] god had told the people in that time if
[23:24] you will
[23:25] obey my voice i will be
[23:28] an adversary to your adversaries
[23:32] i'll be an enemy to your enemies i'll
[23:34] tell you that's somebody you want on
[23:36] your side
[23:38] we want him on our side but remember if
[23:41] we obey his voice
[23:44] god will only back up his word
[23:48] is that right you see even where
[23:52] god would speak through moses and he
[23:53] would speak and remind the children of
[23:56] israel
[23:56] that even when you're looking at a
[23:58] situation
[23:59] as he would say and and you're
[24:01] frightened at it
[24:03] but i want you to remember the lord god
[24:05] is among you
[24:07] almighty god and terrible
[24:10] he would he would david with these no
[24:12] doubt would be promises that david
[24:14] is drawing from he's rehearsing and how
[24:17] david would stand there and
[24:19] recall within his heart and within his
[24:22] mind
[24:22] god had said there shall be no man
[24:26] stand before you you see
[24:29] david standing there as god had spoke
[24:31] that there
[24:32] through moses david realizes this
[24:35] pertains to me as well
[24:37] what god said there i'm standing in the
[24:39] land and there shall not be any man
[24:42] that would stand before god's children
[24:45] god had told
[24:46] joshua the same thing and here we find
[24:49] that how
[24:49] that david standing here in the midst of
[24:52] this time you know to stand it means to
[24:54] present
[24:54] oneself to present as though
[24:58] to stand before here's an opposition
[25:01] that's coming before
[25:02] that of israel but you remember that
[25:05] israel when they came in the land
[25:09] there was a situation that arose
[25:12] where a man by the name of aiken
[25:15] he took a wedge of gold and a
[25:17] babylonious garment
[25:20] and when that came in and he hid that in
[25:23] his tent
[25:24] and when that was hidden in the tent you
[25:26] find among israel at that time
[25:29] that even though the rest of israel
[25:30] didn't know what was going on but it's
[25:32] amazing
[25:33] how sin can pervade the camp
[25:37] they come into a place of becoming very
[25:39] prideful
[25:41] we don't need to take everybody up there
[25:43] to fight this battle
[25:44] we only need to take a little bit of
[25:45] people up there to fight this battle
[25:47] but they weren't winning the battles
[25:49] because of their numbers
[25:51] it wasn't their numbers that was winning
[25:53] the battle
[25:54] it was god that was winning the battles
[25:58] god was only using them as they yielded
[26:01] themselves to god
[26:03] but there was something that had come in
[26:05] the camp and it was hindering
[26:08] victory joshua
[26:12] joshua was a scriptural man as well and
[26:15] joshua could look back and say
[26:17] is there not a cause what's going on
[26:19] here
[26:20] why is there not victory the way that it
[26:23] needs to be
[26:24] you know what he looked back to because
[26:26] god can't fail
[26:27] god's word can't fail what god has said
[26:30] god stands to back up that word
[26:32] so joshua isn't looking at that the
[26:35] problem is with god
[26:36] the problem is not with the message that
[26:38] he's given but now it's time for an
[26:40] examination
[26:41] and it has to start here
[26:46] because he's the same god so to stand
[26:49] right there you know
[26:50] that takes a mighty big man when i say
[26:53] man i'm talking about brothers and
[26:54] sisters alike to be able to stand there
[26:57] in the face and let the word examine our
[27:00] lives
[27:01] hey we're not here to put on a show we
[27:03] don't come to church to be told
[27:05] where our good places are we kind of
[27:07] know those places
[27:08] but we come that the word would bring a
[27:11] scan upon our life
[27:12] because there's a desire in our heart to
[27:15] be
[27:15] closer to god there's not one of us in
[27:19] here tonight if you are you got the
[27:20] wrong thoughts
[27:21] there's none of us can stand here
[27:23] tonight and say well i already made it
[27:25] when god has come in the depths of our
[27:28] heart there's a love for god
[27:30] there's a desire for god there's a
[27:32] pulsation for more of god
[27:34] there's a longing in our heart that god
[27:36] i don't want
[27:37] nothing between me and you
[27:40] it moves within our life
[27:44] and i think of how this weapon that god
[27:48] has given them because david he's
[27:51] knowing
[27:53] hey god has said i'll make you the head
[27:56] and not the tail
[28:00] you're the head and not the tail but god
[28:03] had told them
[28:04] if you get away from my word
[28:08] then you'll no longer be the head you'll
[28:11] be the tail
[28:13] once you leave the word and the
[28:16] authority of the word
[28:18] you leave your authority there is no
[28:21] authority outside of this word
[28:26] this this word because this word it's
[28:29] not a man's
[28:30] word it's god's word
[28:33] it's god that has spoken to us in this
[28:36] generation it's god that not only has
[28:39] spoken but it's god
[28:40] who is still speaking and vindicating
[28:44] his word in the lives and hearts of his
[28:46] children
[28:48] hallelujah that gives us courage to run
[28:50] to the battle
[28:52] i made thee to be the head
[28:56] and not the tail yes sir
[28:59] pardon me
[29:04] but you see with saul saul had come to a
[29:08] place
[29:08] when you look at the anointing here's
[29:10] saul
[29:11] is anointed here david is anointed
[29:15] saul was anointed with vile david's
[29:18] anointed with the horn
[29:20] is that right but if you notice with
[29:23] saul
[29:25] god when we look at saul's life
[29:28] i just forgive me i just have to say it
[29:30] like this it was self-willed saul
[29:34] saul did things that was convenient for
[29:37] saul
[29:39] it was not about anybody else it was not
[29:42] thinking about the rest of the body
[29:44] it was all about saul
[29:47] saul wanted all the glory when a battle
[29:50] was won
[29:51] and he didn't even win it it was
[29:53] jonathan his son that went up there
[29:56] the only reason saul wanted to associate
[29:59] with the prophet samuel because he knew
[30:02] god was with him
[30:05] he knew god was with him and he said if
[30:08] you don't follow samuel
[30:09] and i is that right
[30:13] she wanted to bind the people to him by
[30:15] fear but we know that's not how god
[30:17] works
[30:18] god does not bind his people with fear
[30:22] but where the spirit of the lord is
[30:24] there is
[30:25] liberty that word loosens you and i
[30:29] it illusions you and i to be a son and
[30:32] daughter of god
[30:34] brother where you don't have to wait
[30:36] upon your pastor
[30:37] to live in victory there is victory in
[30:40] your life
[30:41] when there's a need that comes up you
[30:43] don't have to have your pastor on speed
[30:46] dial
[30:46] jesus is right there
[30:50] amen he said i'll never leave you nor
[30:53] forsake you
[30:54] that's a certainty whether you feel it
[30:56] or not it's a certainty of god's word
[31:00] but saul when it was convenient even
[31:03] when saul
[31:04] in different times when it came down to
[31:06] repentance
[31:07] it wasn't that he really wanted to
[31:09] repent in his heart he wanted to save
[31:11] face before the people
[31:13] just you know return with me and walk
[31:15] out here samuel with me so
[31:16] you know i'll be in good standing it was
[31:19] not there was a real lacking
[31:21] of sincerity in his life that's right
[31:25] he intruded into places he shouldn't
[31:27] have been
[31:29] is that right he had no authority being
[31:31] there
[31:32] but he comes to a place where god
[31:35] identifies
[31:37] you have rejected the word of the lord
[31:42] and remember when saul laid hold on on
[31:45] samuel you know on the
[31:46] on the mantle and it rent and samuel
[31:49] expressed it to him god has removed the
[31:53] kingdom
[31:53] from you this day and given it
[31:57] to a neighbor and i want you to notice
[32:00] these words as it speaks here you're
[32:02] familiar with this
[32:03] and samuel said the lord hath rent the
[32:06] kingdom of israel from thee this day
[32:08] and hath given it to a neighbor of thine
[32:11] that is
[32:11] better than thou and also the strength
[32:16] of israel who's the strength of israel
[32:20] god the strength of israel will not lie
[32:25] nor repent for he's not a man that he
[32:28] should
[32:28] repent remember david would be the man
[32:32] that would testify of this in his life
[32:35] and david would say
[32:36] the lord is the strength of my life
[32:39] you'll never find saul speaking of god
[32:42] being his king but you'll find over and
[32:44] over
[32:44] of david in the psalm saying lord thou
[32:47] art my king
[32:49] him david knew his position and his
[32:52] position
[32:52] was under almighty god he knew it was
[32:56] god that had called him
[32:58] my my my he knew it was god that had
[33:01] elected him
[33:02] he knew it was god it had anointed him
[33:05] he simply
[33:06] knew that all about my life it's god
[33:12] my mama he was looking with that reality
[33:16] and there was a strength now that david
[33:19] is testifying
[33:20] it wasn't his stature it wasn't the
[33:23] stature of david
[33:24] it was the strength of god
[33:27] [Music]
[33:29] we're in a real contest
[33:33] we've been in a real contest
[33:37] i believe we're living in a time where
[33:40] where it's it's really time for the word
[33:43] to be living and made manifest not that
[33:46] it hadn't been
[33:48] but listen these i believe this with all
[33:50] my heart it's not going to get
[33:52] easier from here on out faith isn't
[33:55] waiting on for
[33:56] you know the next doctor to rise on the
[33:58] scene and some cure about this
[34:00] we thank god for all of those things but
[34:02] that's not
[34:03] what faith is based on
[34:06] if your faith is based on that you know
[34:09] you
[34:09] you you hear it today tomorrow you hear
[34:11] a different story
[34:12] you hear a different story over here but
[34:14] this is why that within the midst of
[34:16] this hour
[34:17] it's a time i believe it's god's grace
[34:19] and god's mercy
[34:20] that it can let you and i know if you
[34:22] don't have that assurance
[34:24] and that assurance and that stabilizer
[34:26] in your life that god can come down
[34:28] and really bring a real assurance that
[34:30] you're not worried
[34:32] you're not caring about the world you
[34:34] know where you're anchored and you're
[34:35] resting and for those that are anchored
[34:37] and resting
[34:38] oh what a comfort that it is to know
[34:41] that he
[34:42] holds the future he holds my life right
[34:45] now
[34:46] my life is in his hands and there's not
[34:48] a devil can take me
[34:50] or touch me until god is finished with
[34:52] me
[34:54] that's a comfort in this hour
[34:58] it's a contest of strength that's on
[35:01] and when god how that god would
[35:04] make his strength known is god makes his
[35:08] strength known
[35:10] by coming in his word and coming into
[35:12] his church
[35:14] brother brown would speak and bring this
[35:15] up here in the message the contest and
[35:18] he would deal with it says
[35:19] now the word you know he says we know
[35:22] who has the most power
[35:23] god does because the word is god and
[35:27] who's stronger than god
[35:29] the word is god and the word becomes our
[35:31] strength
[35:32] god in the church becomes his strength
[35:35] to pull
[35:36] satan to his own fires that he has made
[35:42] as jesus said if you abide in me
[35:45] and my words abide in you you shall ask
[35:47] what you will
[35:48] and it shall be done
[35:51] you see when we look at this and we see
[35:54] this anointing upon david's life
[35:58] you know when we many times you know
[36:02] you can look at somebody else and say my
[36:05] i i wish i wish i had what they had
[36:09] but there's nobody superheroes here
[36:14] are you with me we're talking flesh and
[36:17] blood that's right here
[36:18] we're talking lives that go through that
[36:20] go through battles and go through tests
[36:23] but when we're talking about god on the
[36:25] inside
[36:27] we're talking about a strength and a
[36:29] stabilizer
[36:30] that holds us in the midst of tests in
[36:32] the midst of trials
[36:34] even in the time when you felt like
[36:37] giving up
[36:37] you couldn't give up because you didn't
[36:41] start this work
[36:44] god started this world that's the
[36:47] strength of god
[36:49] standing there even in the midst of the
[36:51] test and of the trial
[36:52] he's holding you
[36:57] we look at this and i think we're living
[37:00] in a time
[37:01] as brother adam would speak of how and
[37:04] he would
[37:04] bring that of the message being like
[37:07] that of
[37:08] how he says you see a woman you being a
[37:10] young man and you would see a
[37:12] a young lady that you could say you know
[37:14] what she'll make
[37:15] she'd make a wonderful wife and all of
[37:18] these different qualities and all these
[37:19] different
[37:20] attributes but she's not yours
[37:24] until you start pursuing her
[37:27] you have to pursue her you have to you
[37:30] have to you have to express
[37:31] and have to go after her is that right
[37:34] it don't happen by osmosis you you have
[37:37] to move after her
[37:38] brother braham said that's the way the
[37:40] message is you can sympathize with it
[37:43] and say it's right but you've got to
[37:46] take it yourself
[37:48] to become part of it see the message
[37:51] being preached
[37:51] but you've got to reach out and you've
[37:53] got to become a part of it
[37:55] you've got to be joined with it it's not
[37:57] just enough to make eyes
[37:59] at it but it's to say i want to be one
[38:02] with that
[38:02] that's what god's desiring a real
[38:05] oneness
[38:06] and a real union but he's a gentleman he
[38:08] won't force himself
[38:11] but you've got to take it yourself to
[38:13] become part of it
[38:14] then you and the message become one then
[38:17] the anointings with you
[38:19] as it is with others
[38:22] these scriptures even that we opened up
[38:24] with
[38:26] david when he comes jumps out of the
[38:29] carriage
[38:30] he runs to the he runs to the battle
[38:32] then we find out
[38:34] even later on as he steps down to meet
[38:36] this philistine
[38:38] david himself draws near to the
[38:40] philistine
[38:41] you're not backing up the philistines
[38:45] out there
[38:46] david is going to meet him it's not
[38:49] backing up
[38:50] then we find even as it get as it got a
[38:52] little closer
[38:53] david ran now in order to run
[38:58] you know just like with with with
[39:01] children
[39:02] they don't start out running they start
[39:03] out walking
[39:05] is that right we don't all of a sudden
[39:08] start running but we got to walk you
[39:09] take certain steps
[39:11] that are first is that right this is why
[39:14] even when we're looking and we we look
[39:16] at the glory we look at the reality we
[39:19] we recognize and how that god is is
[39:22] right here among us and god speaking to
[39:24] our hearts
[39:25] and you would say brother samuel what is
[39:27] it that god is desiring
[39:29] surrender amen surrender
[39:33] it's it's it's a simple surrender and
[39:36] dying out to self we can never get
[39:38] around that
[39:40] because god will never come and unite
[39:43] with that old nature there's got to be a
[39:46] dying out
[39:48] first is that right now brother branham
[39:51] when he goes through this whole part
[39:52] here
[39:53] after the seals and then he comes in
[39:55] down through
[39:56] the messages there in june and july of
[39:58] 63.
[39:59] he's dealing with with things that he's
[40:01] seeing in the church and he
[40:02] he speaks of how he sees a lack of
[40:05] sincerity where he says
[40:06] he says i don't see people acting upon
[40:09] the word
[40:10] like they ought to he said i see he says
[40:12] well i said there's questions he said
[40:14] that seems to be in people's minds could
[40:16] it be me i wonder if i'm a part of it
[40:18] and then he says god has laid something
[40:20] on my heart
[40:21] for the next service it was he that is
[40:23] in you and brother adam takes that whole
[40:25] service on he that is in you i know
[40:27] you're familiar with it and he would
[40:29] deal with the reality of a true
[40:31] repentance he would deal with true
[40:34] confession
[40:35] you know confession is as he said
[40:37] clearing everything out
[40:39] if if you know that you've done
[40:40] something wrong to somebody
[40:42] go make it right why would brother
[40:45] samuel you don't know what that's going
[40:46] to do to me
[40:47] but think of the body think of the body
[40:51] think of your life think of inviting god
[40:54] into the camp and what it means
[40:57] so he's dealing with these things of how
[41:00] that that a lack of confession
[41:02] of where it can be among among the
[41:05] people and you know
[41:06] as we said god god is only obligated to
[41:10] his word
[41:12] god will come to his word and this is
[41:15] why
[41:15] that we we must be standing upon his
[41:18] word
[41:18] that's what gives you and i assurance to
[41:21] run to the battle
[41:22] to those things that you and i that we
[41:25] would be facing or called to face
[41:27] it takes more than just our strength it
[41:30] takes more than just our knowledge
[41:32] brother
[41:33] it takes an anchor in the midst of that
[41:35] time it takes a god
[41:37] with skin on it a god in the midst of
[41:40] the storm
[41:41] that's able to stand there and give us
[41:43] strength in that hour
[41:48] so many times here where israel is out
[41:52] and here that here's the army in a
[41:55] situation
[41:57] there's got to be a removing of the
[41:59] hindrance
[42:01] of what's over their life you see you
[42:04] can never do anything with condemnation
[42:05] over your life
[42:08] condemnation it hinders confidence
[42:14] and if there's anything between you and
[42:16] god make it right
[42:19] if the life hasn't been fully
[42:21] surrendered surrender it all to him
[42:24] lay it all down to him say say god come
[42:27] into my life
[42:28] and be fully lord in my life i think
[42:31] we're here
[42:31] in this time to dedicate this this
[42:34] building that god
[42:35] has blessed you with god has provided
[42:38] but
[42:39] what an awesome opportunity for us to
[42:42] dedicate these vessels to god
[42:45] a time to really dedicate ourselves to
[42:48] god
[42:49] and see condemnation has a way
[42:52] there can be things even the devil can
[42:54] try to hold over your head let me just
[42:55] say something here
[42:57] he'll even when it comes time for you to
[42:59] take promises
[43:00] he'll try to bring up all kinds of
[43:02] things from the past
[43:03] but let me remind you there is no
[43:06] condemnation
[43:08] to them that are in christ jesus
[43:12] who walk not after the flesh but after
[43:15] the spirit if you're standing right
[43:17] there
[43:17] you can look at that devil and say boo
[43:22] because there's no condemnation it's
[43:24] already been dealt with
[43:26] right here god has come down and dealt
[43:29] with that in your life
[43:30] the desire is not there it's flee
[43:33] your desire is for god for his word
[43:37] it's him that you love the very thought
[43:39] of sin
[43:40] haunts you
[43:41] [Applause]
[43:44] hallelujah this is how we're running to
[43:46] the battle
[43:49] i think of how when god as he came down
[43:52] and he sent
[43:53] samuel down there to anoint david
[43:57] saw you know samuel went down there and
[44:00] samuel
[44:02] he picked he picked the first one which
[44:05] would have been
[44:06] a much larger stature and everything
[44:08] surely this is the one
[44:11] but god already had his choice
[44:16] one after one after one after one went
[44:20] by
[44:21] finally
[44:24] samuel stood there he says you got
[44:28] another one
[44:31] samuel was there to anoint a king
[44:34] that god had provided for himself
[44:38] he knew god had sent him there with a
[44:41] message
[44:43] there's a reason i'm here at your house
[44:49] there's a king here there's one to
[44:51] anoint oh my
[44:52] there's a reason that god has knocked on
[44:55] your heart it's a son and daughter of
[44:57] god
[44:58] on the inside to be anointed with his
[45:01] presence
[45:02] it's not by coincidence or chance that
[45:04] this
[45:05] message came across your pathway it's
[45:07] not a coincidence
[45:09] you were born into a home you heard that
[45:12] voice
[45:12] you heard it crying out it's not a
[45:14] coincidence but what do i do
[45:16] let god anoint you
[45:20] [Applause]
[45:23] samuel wanted to know how am i going to
[45:25] get down there
[45:26] how will i get down there if saul finds
[45:29] out that i'm down there
[45:30] he's going to kill me but god said i
[45:34] want you to come down
[45:35] secretly through the sacrifice
[45:39] i want you to call them to the sacrifice
[45:42] you see in order for victory to come
[45:45] back into the camp
[45:46] we've got to come back to the original
[45:49] sacrifice
[45:50] we've got to come back to the original
[45:53] atonement
[45:53] the original baptism of the holy ghost
[45:56] we must come back to the original word
[45:59] the original grounds
[46:01] that belonged to believers
[46:04] [Music]
[46:05] call them back call them to a sacrifice
[46:09] they didn't know what was going on
[46:12] they didn't know what was taking place
[46:14] but god was moving down
[46:17] oh hallelujah glory be to god what about
[46:21] in this generation
[46:26] hallelujah god himself he came down in
[46:29] this generation
[46:31] is that right and that same god is here
[46:34] with us
[46:34] but how many would have looked upon the
[46:37] little statue of a man and said
[46:39] seventh grade education ah nothing to it
[46:42] he don't know much about this or much
[46:44] about that but god wasn't there to
[46:46] impress their intellects
[46:48] that's not what the believer is moved by
[46:51] the believer is not moved
[46:52] by deep intellectual things the believer
[46:56] is moved and stabilized by the living
[46:59] god coming down
[47:00] in their midst that gives them
[47:02] confidence and hope
[47:03] in the midst of darkness in the midst of
[47:06] trials
[47:07] in the midst of situations when god
[47:09] comes down and says
[47:11] i'm still the same god
[47:15] i haven't changed a bit
[47:18] [Music]
[47:19] anybody in here want to join with me and
[47:21] say god
[47:22] be god in my life don't change a bit
[47:28] we don't want to alter him
[47:29] [Applause]
[47:32] we haven't united with him with hopes of
[47:34] how that we can form him
[47:35] to our ways but we want to be shaped and
[47:39] molded to his
[47:40] ways
[47:45] how am i going to get this anointing on
[47:47] him call them to the sacrifice
[47:50] they got away from the sacrifice they're
[47:52] looking at other things
[47:54] but a call comes look away to jesus
[47:58] look away to him who's the author and
[48:00] finisher of your faith
[48:02] look away from all of these schisms and
[48:04] all of these
[48:05] things that are out and look away to him
[48:07] who is the living word
[48:10] aren't you glad aren't you glad a call
[48:13] has come to your life
[48:17] you may not have been setting in the
[48:19] meetings you may not have been sitting
[48:21] there
[48:21] and seen brother branham but let me just
[48:24] tell you something
[48:25] that same god that sent brother branham
[48:28] with the message that same god
[48:30] is in the building tonight that same god
[48:33] is the same god
[48:34] that reaches down and touched your life
[48:36] as a matter of fact
[48:37] you are a product of this message
[48:45] glory be to god so the strength of
[48:48] israel the strength of israel it was not
[48:50] their numbers
[48:52] it was not how tall they were how
[48:54] broad-shouldered they were
[48:56] it wasn't how eloquent they could be
[49:00] the strength of israel was god
[49:04] you take god away from israel they're
[49:06] like any other nation
[49:08] god said you want to be like any other
[49:09] nation fine i'm leaving
[49:13] because it's god who makes the
[49:15] difference
[49:16] a church is a church but god's the one
[49:19] who makes a difference
[49:20] a home can be a home but god is the one
[49:23] who makes a difference
[49:24] marriage can be a marriage but god is
[49:26] the one who makes it a real marriage
[49:31] you leave god out of the equation you're
[49:33] in trouble
[49:34] but oh with god in the midst brother all
[49:37] things are possible
[49:41] you know what david coming into the camp
[49:45] david wasn't dragging back into the camp
[49:48] you know coming in there and
[49:49] you know telling all the oh
[49:52] yeah this is terrible hey do you guys
[49:54] see what everything's going on i tell
[49:56] you
[49:56] this stuff they say we're going to have
[49:57] to do this now and we're going to have
[49:59] to wear a mask for the next 30 years and
[50:01] we're going to have to do this and i'll
[50:03] tell you that's so terrible
[50:06] david had been having fellowship with
[50:08] god
[50:11] david where you been i've been
[50:13] quarantined out there with the sheep
[50:17] but you see he had been locked away with
[50:20] god
[50:22] amen he had been having fellowship with
[50:25] god
[50:26] and when david as he comes running back
[50:28] into the camp you know what it was
[50:30] it was a reminder they needed courage
[50:33] and here came encouragement
[50:36] god had wrapped himself in the gesture
[50:40] of david
[50:41] and god was coming into the camp to
[50:43] encourage
[50:45] israel he was coming to remind
[50:48] them of who they were
[50:51] you're not a trodden down bunch of
[50:54] nothings
[50:54] you are sons and daughters of god
[50:58] he came into the camp to make an example
[51:01] of this is what god intends for each and
[51:04] every one of you to be
[51:07] that's real encouragement i say that's a
[51:10] body ministry
[51:13] think about how brother brandon would
[51:14] say oh i hope i'm alive
[51:16] to see when she puts on that robes of
[51:19] resurrection power
[51:23] this was a ministry oh my that even when
[51:25] brother branham would stand there
[51:27] at the end of perfect faith he said if
[51:29] you don't have faith for your healing
[51:31] i'm gonna put my faith and i'm gonna
[51:34] pray
[51:34] i've already spoken it and i'm gonna
[51:37] pray
[51:38] you claim it you believe it let me tell
[51:40] you something god
[51:41] has anointed this word upon a people
[51:45] and this word has already been spoken
[51:48] and what god has spoken
[51:49] he ain't gonna repent for he never told
[51:52] a lie
[51:53] he's still the same god to confirm that
[51:56] word
[51:56] and make it real
[52:04] what's happening get a little bit back
[52:06] in your step
[52:08] start walking and then you before you
[52:10] start then you start running
[52:18] here comes their champion that's what
[52:20] they called him
[52:22] champion
[52:26] evidently he'd been in fights and he had
[52:27] won fights
[52:31] what he didn't know
[52:34] he might be looking at a small little
[52:36] ruddy boy
[52:39] but there was a great big god on the
[52:44] inside
[52:46] it's amazing how israel was hearing
[52:48] these things
[52:50] and it just it brought fear to them but
[52:52] when david
[52:53] heard it david saw it for an opportunity
[52:57] you see it's just like the devil you let
[52:59] the devil try to get a hold of something
[53:01] he can take a quote he can take a
[53:02] scripture he can try to run you down
[53:05] but you let the holy ghost get a hold of
[53:07] that it'll turn the situation for
[53:10] bleakness and darkness
[53:11] it'll cast out fear it'll dismir dismiss
[53:14] worry
[53:15] and unbelief why because it's the god of
[53:17] his word
[53:22] i love this word champion it's a man of
[53:24] the space
[53:25] in between
[53:28] they had a man that was coming between
[53:30] the space of two armies
[53:31] what they didn't know is there was a man
[53:34] by the name of david
[53:36] who god had already come down in that
[53:39] boy's life
[53:42] it was god in simplicity but there was a
[53:45] god there that could feel the breach
[53:47] are you with me there's one that could
[53:49] stand a living god a living word
[53:52] that could stand right there as the
[53:53] champion in that
[53:55] hour oh my well was it it wasn't taking
[53:58] away from the word
[54:00] it was god coming back and said what i
[54:02] said back here
[54:03] that i'll make you the head and not the
[54:05] tail god was declaring that
[54:08] and said this is what i'm here to do i'm
[54:10] an enemy to your enemies
[54:12] i'm an adversary to your adversaries
[54:16] my standing right there
[54:19] that how that they in the midst of that
[54:21] time how
[54:22] that through that hour david was
[54:24] identifying himself
[54:26] with the living god he was identified by
[54:29] god
[54:32] i said moments ago i i don't understand
[54:37] when when when somebody looks at
[54:39] something and says
[54:40] we believe he's the same god but don't
[54:43] want god to act the same way
[54:46] don't want god to do the same things
[54:49] this is where true identity is true
[54:52] identity
[54:53] is not just with teaching true identity
[54:57] is with the living god of the word
[55:01] it's god himself identifying his
[55:04] presence and this what this is what
[55:06] david
[55:06] was saying how about you and i david was
[55:09] identifying
[55:10] that i was with moses when he crossed
[55:12] the red sea
[55:13] david could stand there i was with there
[55:16] with joshua
[55:17] when the rivers of jordan were partying
[55:19] i was there
[55:20] when jericho when the walls came came
[55:23] tumbling down
[55:23] what was he doing it was the presence of
[55:26] god
[55:27] coming back into the camp of israel
[55:30] how did he get back into the camp
[55:32] because there was a life
[55:34] that was surrendered and willing to
[55:37] invite
[55:38] god back into the camp without
[55:41] restraints
[55:45] it just goes to show it don't matter how
[55:46] old you are it don't matter how young
[55:48] you are
[55:52] it don't they don't matter about size or
[55:54] statute don't even matter how long
[55:56] you've been around the message god
[55:58] doesn't look at things like that
[56:00] god doesn't god doesn't do things like
[56:01] that by rank god will come where there
[56:04] are hearts
[56:04] that are longing and desiring for him to
[56:07] speak
[56:08] and design for him to move he just loves
[56:11] to come
[56:12] where he is invited and welcomed where
[56:16] there's no restraints put upon him where
[56:18] you don't say well jesus you can come
[56:20] but
[56:21] i don't want you doing this i don't want
[56:23] you acting this way
[56:24] i don't want you doing this we want
[56:26] jesus to come
[56:27] the god of the bible we want him to come
[56:30] and be
[56:31] the god of the bible to do the same
[56:34] thing that he did before
[56:36] this message never took us from that are
[56:39] you hearing me
[56:40] brother branham when he stood there and
[56:41] preached and taking sides with jesus
[56:44] and he gathered the brethren together
[56:46] and he's rehearsing how he studied
[56:48] that early church and when he preached
[56:50] restoration of the bride tree
[56:52] and he rehearses and he said brothers i
[56:54] look for
[56:55] and expect the same thing to be
[56:58] right among us and he
[57:02] challenges us in that hour he challenges
[57:05] us
[57:05] not only as pastors not only as
[57:07] evangelists he
[57:08] challenges us as husbands as daddies
[57:12] he said we have got children that's
[57:15] coming on
[57:16] and we've got to think of them he said
[57:19] we don't know the moment nor the hour
[57:21] we've got to make
[57:23] arrangements for them
[57:28] but samuel what are you saying i'm
[57:30] saying that the same lord jesus
[57:32] the same holy ghost that was poured out
[57:34] on the day of pentecost
[57:36] i'm saying the same holy ghost inside of
[57:39] my life to change me
[57:40] that's the same holy ghost for my
[57:42] children it's the same holy ghost
[57:45] for every vessel everyone that's
[57:47] ordained of god
[57:48] it don't make no difference it's never
[57:51] been diluted
[57:52] the atonement is just as real and just
[57:55] as full of glory
[57:56] and power i don't care what all demons
[58:00] out there
[58:01] have rose up you might say brother
[58:03] samuel you don't understand
[58:04] now there's phones out there and all
[58:06] these things and our children
[58:08] have access that's a lust devil and
[58:11] god's already conquered that devil
[58:13] there might be all types of devices and
[58:15] all types of things
[58:16] but there's a mighty conqueror in the
[58:19] camp
[58:21] there's a god who's already triumphed
[58:23] and he's already defeated that let me
[58:25] tell you a young person
[58:26] all you have to do is lay it down and
[58:29] receive that and say god
[58:31] i take you out your word lord jesus
[58:38] we're dealing with the defeated devil
[58:42] now he's running his mouth like he don't
[58:44] because like he don't know it but
[58:46] remember
[58:47] he's roaming to and fro seeking whom he
[58:50] may devour
[58:52] while all the things that we see coming
[58:54] up and you see all the darkness and you
[58:56] see all the voices and everything else
[58:58] he's howling is that right brother brown
[59:01] says his howling
[59:03] and all of this he said that that's
[59:04] rising up against that
[59:06] of the holy spirit in this last days
[59:08] it's setting up denominations
[59:10] what are denominations it is breakers
[59:13] against the spirit of god
[59:17] he identified it was walls it was
[59:19] denominations it was things being set up
[59:22] let it not be said among us that we've
[59:24] set up walls
[59:25] you might say i believe this message but
[59:28] don't set up a wall
[59:29] in your life always be a vessel that the
[59:32] holy ghost can come
[59:33] and move through your life and use you
[59:38] that's our inheritance
[59:42] that's a privilege david was identifying
[59:46] himself
[59:47] with the living god my my my my
[59:58] saul wanted to put some things on david
[1:00:03] david you know he thought he respected
[1:00:05] saul you know
[1:00:06] saul was his elder saul was older
[1:00:09] david i want you to see this david had a
[1:00:12] spirit of humility
[1:00:15] it was not arrogance the anointing upon
[1:00:17] his life and positioning
[1:00:19] it did not bring arrogance it did not
[1:00:22] bring pride
[1:00:24] saul was his elder saul said here you
[1:00:26] take this right here and
[1:00:28] and you go on out there remember it was
[1:00:31] because
[1:00:32] of david behaving himself wisely
[1:00:36] that saul knew god had anointed him
[1:00:39] to be king it's one thing
[1:00:43] i hope it's all right it's one thing
[1:00:46] to behave yourself wisely around
[1:00:48] everybody else
[1:00:50] but how do you behave in your home
[1:00:54] because you see this is where real
[1:00:56] respect and real authority comes from
[1:00:58] the same god that's in the service is
[1:01:00] the same god that goes with you
[1:01:03] he's the same god that goes when you're
[1:01:05] on the job you see god
[1:01:07] god doesn't want you being somebody
[1:01:08] different here than you are out there
[1:01:11] god wants you being yourself but he
[1:01:13] wants you to be filled with him
[1:01:16] he wants you to be a vessel that even
[1:01:18] when situations arise
[1:01:20] as they come up you're ready to stand
[1:01:22] right there run to the battle
[1:01:23] you're running to god you're running to
[1:01:25] the battle maybe on your knees and
[1:01:27] you're in prayer god help me
[1:01:29] how do i face this situation lord
[1:01:35] let's be honest there's many situations
[1:01:37] i tell you i think probably i could
[1:01:39] speak probably for all the
[1:01:40] pastors and ministers that's here
[1:01:45] try to found things of of truth and you
[1:01:48] know
[1:01:48] do we open the church here or do we do
[1:01:50] this or whatever more
[1:01:52] you've had to pray and wait on god
[1:01:55] god give you peace within it you know
[1:01:57] one thing about the will of god
[1:01:59] peace always comes with it
[1:02:03] and looking to god and god never made us
[1:02:05] a promise well nobody will ever get sick
[1:02:07] but he made promises when it comes i'll
[1:02:10] take sickness from among you
[1:02:13] many many other promises that are there
[1:02:16] but in the midst of this time how david
[1:02:18] is standing there
[1:02:22] tell saul i can't i've not proved these
[1:02:25] things i've not fought any battles with
[1:02:27] this
[1:02:28] i gotta go into this battle
[1:02:31] with what i know that's been tried
[1:02:34] true tested proven
[1:02:38] what's certain to me
[1:02:42] he wasn't looking for something new he
[1:02:45] was using
[1:02:46] the same experience he had
[1:02:51] the situation looked different but god
[1:02:53] was the same god
[1:02:59] david runs down there to the brook
[1:03:03] i'm i'm coming down
[1:03:08] and david runs down there to the brook
[1:03:12] you know he wasn't nervous a bit
[1:03:16] david runs down there and he kneels down
[1:03:19] and he starts taking
[1:03:20] up stones every one of them stones were
[1:03:24] promises
[1:03:27] those promises were right there but
[1:03:30] somebody had to go out there and take
[1:03:31] them
[1:03:33] david knelt down and he began to take
[1:03:37] five
[1:03:37] promises now you know how the prophet
[1:03:40] brings it
[1:03:40] that's j-e-s-u-s faith
[1:03:44] but you notice he didn't he didn't sling
[1:03:47] all five stones
[1:03:49] he just took one stone out because once
[1:03:52] you've got
[1:03:52] jesus you've got everything
[1:03:56] you have need of you've got the victory
[1:04:00] to face any obstacle in any situation
[1:04:05] is that right he's more than enough
[1:04:08] for whatever that you would be facing
[1:04:13] david begins to you know sling that
[1:04:16] that stone around this was you know for
[1:04:18] david
[1:04:21] david walked out there this is what
[1:04:23] david was doing what david did
[1:04:26] this was just another day in david's
[1:04:28] life
[1:04:31] come on now you know what i'm talking
[1:04:32] about there ain't no breaks from the
[1:04:35] devil
[1:04:38] like and one brother told me said i'm
[1:04:40] going to do something that the devil
[1:04:41] don't do
[1:04:41] and that's let you along
[1:04:45] you know what i'm talking about
[1:04:49] but it's always coming even when you you
[1:04:51] wake up right there maybe in the morning
[1:04:52] sometimes
[1:04:55] sometimes you'll try to come around try
[1:04:57] to trouble you in your sleep
[1:05:01] what do i do don't accept that thing
[1:05:04] just put it right back at him you don't
[1:05:08] have to just you don't have to debate
[1:05:09] with him you don't got nothing to prove
[1:05:11] to that devil
[1:05:12] you don't have to dispute with him you
[1:05:14] don't have to try to find
[1:05:16] 15 quotes what should i do just be a son
[1:05:19] and daughter of god
[1:05:21] get out of my way devil
[1:05:28] begins to swing that stone
[1:05:32] there was one vulnerable place
[1:05:35] in his armor he was an uncircumcised
[1:05:39] philistine
[1:05:41] and though david was a marksman it was
[1:05:43] god that directed
[1:05:45] that stone to the forehead of the giant
[1:05:50] knew right where to put it you know
[1:05:52] david in the midst of that hour
[1:05:53] david went to that battle with not a
[1:05:56] hope so
[1:05:56] with not a maybe so
[1:06:00] david went to that battle and when
[1:06:02] goliath as he came out there goliath
[1:06:04] said
[1:06:05] who are you sending out here this guy
[1:06:08] nothing but a youth he's ready david's
[1:06:11] calling out and saul or goliath is
[1:06:13] calling out all these things
[1:06:14] what goliath doesn't know he's only
[1:06:17] advertising
[1:06:18] of this man is small in stature ready
[1:06:22] he's flesh just like you are he doesn't
[1:06:25] realizing
[1:06:26] he's only advertising only calling it
[1:06:28] out
[1:06:29] but there's a god the living god who's
[1:06:32] right there veiled in david's life it
[1:06:35] was
[1:06:36] god who accepted the challenge it was
[1:06:38] not
[1:06:39] david's person it was god in david
[1:06:42] that accepted that challenge oh glory be
[1:06:44] to god
[1:06:48] it's god in you that accepts the
[1:06:50] challenge
[1:06:53] i tell you right now there's tests and
[1:06:55] trials that's
[1:06:57] come our way we wouldn't have put our
[1:06:58] hand up
[1:07:00] god said hey i need i need somebody you
[1:07:03] know that i can show my glory through
[1:07:05] lord are you are you asking for people
[1:07:07] to walk on the water i'll be the first
[1:07:12] guy
[1:07:14] sometimes it's battles and when you look
[1:07:16] at this with goliath
[1:07:18] sometimes the battles and things that
[1:07:20] you face
[1:07:21] it doesn't go away just within a moment
[1:07:24] but
[1:07:24] god gives you victory in your heart
[1:07:28] you can look at that devil and know he's
[1:07:30] already defeated
[1:07:34] day after day but you already have a
[1:07:36] certainty and a settlement this
[1:07:38] faith has dropped right there in the
[1:07:40] womb and you know
[1:07:42] it's settled how do you know how do you
[1:07:44] explain it because god
[1:07:45] has just dropped a faith within my heart
[1:07:48] anybody know what i'm talking about
[1:07:50] things sometimes you're praying about
[1:07:52] or things you're facing you can't
[1:07:54] explain it but how awesome that is
[1:07:56] when god drops his presence right there
[1:08:00] in our life
[1:08:01] and you just know it's finished well
[1:08:04] give me a timeline
[1:08:05] i don't know but it's finished when's
[1:08:08] this going to be over or when am i going
[1:08:10] to see my loved ones
[1:08:11] i can't give the timeline but it's
[1:08:13] finished
[1:08:17] that's greater than even if you could
[1:08:20] see the finish
[1:08:21] it's greater to know that the god who is
[1:08:25] the author and the finisher
[1:08:26] dropped it in your heart that the
[1:08:28] victory is yours
[1:08:35] god will give you encouragements along
[1:08:37] the way things that you need
[1:08:39] even as you're looking at it signs
[1:08:42] things of encouragement
[1:08:43] he's a god who encourages us
[1:08:50] don't you love him for that
[1:08:54] david stands there
[1:08:58] man i tell you just like a seat of
[1:09:00] abraham
[1:09:02] he starts prophesying
[1:09:06] he's anointed right there of the word
[1:09:08] goliath you know goliath is trying to
[1:09:10] rattle his cage
[1:09:12] he's trying to say things you know what
[1:09:14] he's trying to do trying to get him to
[1:09:15] look at himself
[1:09:16] look at his inabilities and in our self
[1:09:20] we're no match for the devil but
[1:09:24] god on the inside is more
[1:09:27] than a match for the enemy
[1:09:30] let me tell you in this age you're no
[1:09:32] match for this age
[1:09:34] but god is more than a match in this age
[1:09:38] there's overcomers in this age
[1:09:44] here stands david in that time
[1:09:49] david said i'm going to take your head
[1:09:52] off you today
[1:09:55] i hope you had your last breakfast that
[1:09:57] you liked
[1:09:59] hope they gave it to you if you like
[1:10:01] filet mignon i hope you ate that today
[1:10:03] because that's your last meal
[1:10:07] because i'm gonna take your head off
[1:10:09] today because the lord
[1:10:12] will deliver you into my hand
[1:10:16] the god of glory come down
[1:10:20] and bring you into my hand
[1:10:26] david began to whirl that that sling
[1:10:28] shot around
[1:10:30] and god directed that stone right to the
[1:10:33] forehead
[1:10:34] of the giant david just didn't stand
[1:10:37] with that david clinton he ran right
[1:10:38] over there
[1:10:39] he took the head of that philistine off
[1:10:44] because i'm sure there might have been
[1:10:45] some that were way back there
[1:10:48] and they couldn't exactly see what was
[1:10:50] going on
[1:10:51] maybe they were kind of like you know
[1:10:53] kind of trying to look over you know one
[1:10:54] another and they couldn't see
[1:10:56] and david went up there and david wanted
[1:10:59] to make sure
[1:11:00] that he could show them that that head
[1:11:03] that authority has been removed
[1:11:07] and he held that head up and he brought
[1:11:10] it back into the camp
[1:11:12] to show that that devil has been
[1:11:15] defeated you know what that did
[1:11:16] it caused the courage to rise in the
[1:11:20] camp of israel
[1:11:21] david never had to tell him hey get off
[1:11:23] your chair
[1:11:24] hey come on come help me come help me it
[1:11:27] was the living god
[1:11:29] vindicating his word it brought a surge
[1:11:32] into that camp brother they received
[1:11:35] courage
[1:11:36] from on high and they rose up out of
[1:11:39] there
[1:11:39] they were cowards one moment and they
[1:11:42] left out of there with courage
[1:11:50] i'll tell you here tonight
[1:11:55] you feel like you got a little cold
[1:11:58] maybe you feel like
[1:11:59] where's god in my home just invite him
[1:12:01] back in the camp

[1:12:39] lion
