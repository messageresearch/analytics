[3:40] [Music]
[3:44] sing I will
[3:52] sing I will
[3:55] [Music]
[3:58] sing amen we're going to read from
[4:00] Matthew chapter
[4:02] 24 and start reading in verse four and
[4:04] the setting here is some actually some
[4:07] prophecy of Jesus as he talks about our
[4:10] times and our conditions of our time
[4:12] there's several places that he talks
[4:14] about that but I want to just H in on
[4:16] this section here on Wars and Jesus
[4:18] answered and said unto them take heed
[4:20] that no man deceive you for many shall
[4:23] come in my name saying I am Christ and
[4:26] shall deceive many so we learned
[4:28] something about the end time time that
[4:30] Jesus said and that is it'll be a time
[4:32] of deception there will be many false
[4:35] Christ come and false anointed ones and
[4:37] faults that are meant to deceive people
[4:40] so uh I always like to say though if
[4:42] there's false Christ if there's
[4:44] something false there has to be a real
[4:46] for them to make the false off of Amen
[4:49] so uh you can't have a counterfeit
[4:51] dollar unless you have a real dollar for
[4:55] it to go off of so thank God that we
[4:57] have the the real living Christ here
[4:59] tonight the word uh this is not a
[5:01] deception but it's the real Christ and
[5:03] ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars
[5:07] see that you be not troubled for all
[5:09] these things must come to pass but the
[5:12] end is not yet for nation shall rise
[5:15] against Nation Kingdom against Kingdom
[5:17] and there shall be famines and
[5:19] pestilences and earthquakes in diverse
[5:22] places now it doesn't take very much
[5:24] discernment to know this is exactly
[5:26] what's going on in our times the last 40
[5:29] years and especially the last 10 years
[5:32] what Jesus said is happening before our
[5:35] very eyes and these are all the
[5:38] beginning of Sorrows then shall they
[5:40] deliver you up to be afflicted and shall
[5:42] kill you and you shall be hated of all
[5:45] Nations for my name's sake and then
[5:47] shall many be offended and shall betray
[5:50] one another and shall hate one another
[5:54] what a time to live in and many false
[5:57] prophet shall rise and shall deceive
[5:59] many so you have false Christ now you
[6:01] have false prophets if you have false
[6:03] prophets there has to be something real
[6:05] for them to make that off of verse 12
[6:08] and because iniquity shall abound the
[6:11] love of many shall wax cold but he that
[6:15] shall endure until the end the same
[6:18] shall be saved how many wants to endure
[6:20] until the end if it puts it in there
[6:22] somebody's going to endure all this Wars
[6:24] rumors of wars being hated can you sayen
[6:27] persecution but somebody's endure it
[6:30] Jesus said he that shall endure to the
[6:31] end shall be saved and this Gospel of
[6:34] the Kingdom shall be preached in all the
[6:36] world for a witness unto all nations and
[6:39] then shall the End come now I'd like to
[6:42] add one more scripture before we sit
[6:43] down because I'll refer refer to it at
[6:45] the end if you don't mind one more in
[6:47] Romans chapter 5 and verse 5 just one
[6:51] verse there because we want to plant
[6:53] that in our minds so we can have in our
[6:55] minds for this study tonight Romans
[6:58] chapter 5 and verse 5
[7:02] and hope maketh not
[7:04] ashamed because the love of God is shed
[7:07] abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost
[7:11] which is given unto us I want to read it
[7:13] again hope maketh not ashamed in other
[7:16] words that means the hope and the
[7:18] promise of God you will never be
[7:22] disappointed now are we disappointed in
[7:24] governments today are we disappointed
[7:26] with politics are we disappointed at
[7:28] Nations Rising against Nation uh do
[7:31] people disappoint you there's a lot of
[7:33] things that disappoint us but the
[7:35] promise of God will never disappoint you
[7:39] it says it says here in verse 5 we just
[7:41] fin Romans 5 and verse 5 I'll read it
[7:43] again hope maketh not ashame because the
[7:47] love of God is poured out shed abroad in
[7:50] our hearts by what by the Holy Ghost
[7:52] which is given unto us there's several
[7:55] places that Jesus is specific of the
[7:57] conditions for our time
[8:00] and that is the last days and so here is
[8:02] he gets very specific about certain
[8:04] things and uh I'm glad tonight that I
[8:07] can say that I'm not in the dark about
[8:09] what's going on in the news and we're
[8:12] not in the dark because Jesus speaks of
[8:15] it here Jesus knew what was going to
[8:17] happen and Jesus prophesized the people
[8:20] that are going to live in the end times
[8:21] this is what they're going to experience
[8:23] and so we're not in the dark how many
[8:24] are glad tonight you're not in the dark
[8:26] about what's going on uh sometimes it
[8:29] brings fear sometimes we're scared but
[8:31] we're not in the dark because the word
[8:32] tells us this is exactly what would take
[8:35] place and so one part of our security
[8:38] though is knowing that our Lord warned
[8:40] us of all this that's happening in the
[8:43] world that that's I want to talk about
[8:44] security a little bit tonight in
[8:46] different things but one part of our
[8:47] security is the Lord already warned us
[8:50] the Lord already said it the Lord has
[8:52] already proclaimed what's taking place
[8:55] right now and so that brings a security
[8:57] to me that God knows what's going on
[9:00] God knew from the foundation of the
[9:01] world he knew the wars and rumors of
[9:03] wars he knew Israel would be at War
[9:05] right now God knew all that I didn't
[9:07] know that but God knew that God said it
[9:10] in his word so it brings a security to
[9:12] me tonight to know without any shadow of
[9:15] a doubt that our Lord knows what's going
[9:17] on and then he speaks it in his word and
[9:19] it makes it all all the more comforting
[9:22] but I want to hone in on tonight this
[9:23] part about wars Jesus says here that uh
[9:26] about the wars you will hear of it and
[9:28] that it that in itself sometimes just
[9:31] hearing of War can be unsettling to us
[9:33] how many would say
[9:35] Amen just hearing of War can be
[9:38] unsettling to the individual it is
[9:41] unsettling and uh then then Jesus says
[9:44] you shall hear of Wars ye shall hear
[9:46] rumors of wars but then he says but see
[9:50] that you're not troubled about
[9:53] it see that your heart is not troubled
[9:57] so so living in the middle of this and
[9:59] hearing or watching it on the news or
[10:01] seeing these things take place it it can
[10:04] bring the reason Jesus said that is that
[10:06] it can bring a troubled heart but Jesus
[10:08] is saying I don't want you to have a
[10:09] troubled heart I don't want you to live
[10:12] in fear now tonight I want to get to the
[10:15] reason why Jesus saying that because if
[10:17] our Lord says don't be troubled when you
[10:20] hear these things happen don't be
[10:22] nervous don't be afraid that our Lord
[10:24] has to provide some type of source that
[10:28] our hearts would be calmed during this
[10:30] time I would say that to the Lord Lord
[10:33] if you said don't be troubled then what
[10:35] are you going to give me so I won't be
[10:37] troubled because if I'm on my own my
[10:39] heart's
[10:40] scared my heart's
[10:43] troubled the wars and rumors of wars and
[10:45] all the conditions and the and the
[10:47] things mounting up in the in the world
[10:49] conditions the way they are your heart
[10:51] is going to be troubled but our Lord
[10:52] says as we see it don't let your heart
[10:55] be troubled so if our Lord says don't be
[10:57] troubled in other places he says it many
[11:00] times let not your hearts be troubled
[11:03] let not now Jesus must be living himself
[11:06] in a place of perfect faith that even
[11:09] when he hit certain persecutions and
[11:12] pressure was coming on him and there's
[11:15] so many incidences in the four gospels
[11:17] that we could go to now but Jesus lived
[11:19] in a realm of perfect Faith he was calm
[11:21] all the time he never got upset at what
[11:23] was happening to him Jesus was on a ship
[11:26] one time and there was a big storm and
[11:27] all the disciples are scared to death
[11:29] you know what Jesus is doing he's
[11:32] sleeping he's sleeping during a storm
[11:34] and the disciples wake him up and said
[11:36] Lord don't you care that there's a storm
[11:38] we're all going to die here there
[11:40] something's going to happen and and you
[11:41] know what he said to him oh ye of little
[11:43] faith he wasn't worried at all by the
[11:47] storm he wasn't worried about the wars
[11:49] he wasn't worried about demons coming up
[11:52] against him he stood faithful in his
[11:54] realm of perfect Faith he knew who he
[11:56] was he knew where he stood and there was
[11:59] an any demon power or any storm that
[12:01] could ever destroy his life until God
[12:04] said so glory be to God I want wherever
[12:09] Jesus was living I want to live there
[12:11] whatever Faith Jesus was partaking of I
[12:14] want that every day in my life perfect
[12:17] Faith Masters every
[12:21] circumstance and guess what we can live
[12:24] there because he says where I am you can
[12:26] be also am we need it so Jesus is there
[12:30] and and and he's saying don't let your
[12:31] heart be troubled in other places he
[12:33] says it and uh he wouldn't say that
[12:36] unless he could provide for us something
[12:39] or someplace that we can go for strength
[12:43] for Hope for peace all of these are are
[12:46] things that we seek after God has to
[12:49] provide some place or something in these
[12:53] times for our strength for Our Hope For
[12:57] Peace for security can you say
[13:00] amen he could not say uh you know when
[13:03] you begin to feel uh insecure when you
[13:07] feel these insecurities come from the
[13:08] wars and from the pressure and and
[13:11] people hating you when you start to feel
[13:13] that then just maybe go uh through some
[13:15] mental exercises and it'll help you out
[13:18] he didn't say
[13:20] that uh I feel good I feel great I feel
[13:25] wonderful I feel good I feel great I
[13:28] feel wonderful you just convince
[13:29] yourself you're doing you're calming
[13:31] your nerves Jesus didn't say
[13:33] that uh he didn't say uh take up some
[13:36] extra yoga
[13:38] classes when it gets real bad in the
[13:40] world to calm your nerves take some
[13:42] extra yoga classes he didn't stay take
[13:45] more pills he didn't say that here when
[13:47] you hit that last days in all the wars
[13:50] he didn't say try to find more pills he
[13:52] didn't say that not against pills if
[13:55] they help a person but he didn't say he
[13:57] didn't say that he he he's got to give
[13:59] us something greater than a pill can you
[14:01] say man greater than a yoga class he
[14:04] didn't he didn't say go buy yourself
[14:06] something real nice and spend a lot of
[14:07] money on yourself so you can call calm
[14:09] your nerves he didn't say take a few
[14:11] days and binge watch Star Wars
[14:16] series of course he didn't say
[14:19] that this will calm you nerves he didn't
[14:22] say any of
[14:23] that but I I if he said don't be
[14:26] troubled he must be providing
[14:29] something deeper than a
[14:31] movie to calm our nerves you know why I
[14:34] say that you know why I say it because
[14:36] Americans and the world have so many
[14:38] things to calm their nerves but in these
[14:41] conditions it's going to take more than
[14:42] a movie it's going to take more than
[14:44] binge watching some series it's going to
[14:47] take some source that God provides by
[14:50] the holy spirit that we can feed on and
[14:52] we can rest on to calm our nerves and
[14:55] say I know where I stand in this hour I
[14:57] am not afraid God knows the hour that we
[15:01] have because he knows the hour and the
[15:03] trouble that it can cause our hearts he
[15:05] provides something deeper than this
[15:07] world he says I give you peace not as
[15:10] the world gives I give peace but I will
[15:12] give you
[15:13] peace so now I want to say something
[15:16] about war here okay because uh we we
[15:20] have to know some things about war when
[15:21] we hear of war the the war in Israel war
[15:26] comes because
[15:29] hate
[15:31] increases so he had to have the word in
[15:33] there that many shall betray one another
[15:36] many shall many shall uh condemn one
[15:39] another many shall be offended many not
[15:42] it used you know we've always had people
[15:44] offended but he says many will be
[15:46] offended there'll be an increase in
[15:48] people getting offended there'll be an
[15:50] in increase in people uh maybe uh
[15:53] leaving the Church of God and leaving
[15:55] Christ there'll be an increase because
[15:57] it's too much of a nervous time and so
[15:59] they they leave Christ there will be an
[16:01] increase in people that hate
[16:05] haters and because you have hate then
[16:09] you're going to have War because hate is
[16:11] the thing that starts War you're not
[16:13] going to have a war if you don't have
[16:15] hate more war is because we have more
[16:18] hate and there's nothing to stop it
[16:21] there's no place for go for people to go
[16:23] to relieve their hate if hate is in a if
[16:27] hate is not resolved D it leads to all
[16:30] sorts of things including War Nations
[16:33] shall rise against Nation kingdoms shall
[16:36] come against Kingdom why because hate
[16:39] and jealousy has
[16:42] increased how many can say Amen
[16:45] tonight hatred unresolved hat hatred
[16:50] hatred brewing for
[16:52] years that's why we've had a lot more
[16:54] fights that's happening even in the
[16:56] political world because all that thing
[16:58] is just festering there all that
[17:01] disagreement is all festering and so now
[17:03] it begins to come to the surface and it
[17:06] manifests at hatred and then so many
[17:08] countries and Nations it manifests into
[17:11] a becomes a war but we must know where
[17:13] it starts it starts with hatred it
[17:15] starts with something festering within
[17:17] us against somebody else we can take a
[17:20] lesson from that you cannot hold on to
[17:22] your
[17:24] hatred or else you become like
[17:27] them you cannot hold on to your
[17:30] resentment you cannot hold on to your
[17:32] bitterness can you say Amen you cannot
[17:35] hold on to hatred it will eat you
[17:38] up and it'll cause
[17:41] War so we learn a lesson is that when we
[17:44] come to more war we come to an
[17:46] increasing of hatred Nations Rising
[17:48] against more and more being against
[17:51] something people more and more being
[17:52] against something and they're saying it
[17:54] I'm against that I'm against that and
[17:56] jealousy Rises one preacher said it a
[17:58] couple weeks ago I like what he said he
[17:59] said we preach so much about what we
[18:01] were we are against we're preaching
[18:03] about what we're against but why not
[18:05] preach what we're
[18:07] for can I get a witness there's too much
[18:10] preaching about what we're against but
[18:13] why don't we preach what we're for and
[18:15] then if somebody's hungry for more truth
[18:17] if there's a heart that's already hungry
[18:19] you don't have to force that person
[18:21] they're just being honest I'm hungry for
[18:23] more truth I want God in my life I got
[18:26] to have a reality of God I got to have
[18:28] more than a religion more than a form
[18:32] more than just a baptism but something
[18:35] that puts me in touch with allmighty
[18:38] God it's got to be more than a religion
[18:42] religion people are still
[18:44] scared but when the Holy Spirit comes in
[18:47] when the Holy Ghost comes in then it's
[18:49] just didn't he call the Holy Ghost when
[18:51] he first said it in in John didn't he
[18:53] says I'm going to send you the Holy
[18:54] Ghost and he said it will be a comforter
[18:59] didn't he call the Holy Ghost a
[19:01] comforter isn't man looking for a
[19:04] comfort from things a comfort from
[19:06] pleasures and entertainments but that's
[19:08] not going to get us through these hard
[19:09] times we need a deeper comforter the
[19:12] comforter and then it says many shall be
[19:14] offended many shall be betrayed many
[19:16] shall betray you and then hate and many
[19:19] means it'll increase it we've always
[19:21] have hatred we've always had from the
[19:24] time that Cain slew his brother Abel
[19:26] we've had a Cain was a murderer where
[19:28] did that come from didn't come from God
[19:30] Cain killed his own brother after the
[19:33] Garden Eden of Eden Cain that did not
[19:36] come from God when Cain killed his
[19:38] brother where did murder come from came
[19:40] from hatred how did Cain get the hatred
[19:43] why did he get jealous at his brother
[19:45] Abel so right from the very beginning of
[19:47] the Garden of Eden we've had hatred but
[19:49] he says in the end time many it'll
[19:52] increase many shall be offended many
[19:56] shall hate one another that's the
[19:58] climate that we live
[19:59] in
[20:02] hatred and I'll just say it you may be a
[20:05] Christian but if you don't stay covered
[20:07] up in the peace of God and his spirit of
[20:10] in the spirit of God some of that hatred
[20:13] will rub off on
[20:16] you some of that bitterness is trying to
[20:18] come in your heart and you get bitter
[20:20] towards the guy that's sitting next to
[20:22] you where the sister or brother sitting
[20:25] next to you you get bitter about them
[20:27] you get bitter toward your boss you get
[20:29] hatred towards your
[20:31] boss we cannot let the spirit that
[20:34] dominates this world this nation this
[20:38] end time we cannot let it into our
[20:41] heart we have to have something to
[20:43] relieve it we have to have something
[20:46] greater is anybody listening to me
[20:47] tonight we have to have something
[20:50] deeper than
[20:53] just what the world
[20:55] provides I want to read and take this
[20:58] just a step deeper
[20:59] here uh turn with me to James 4:1 from
[21:03] whence come Wars and fightings among
[21:07] you come they not hence even of your
[21:10] lust that wore in your members so do you
[21:12] know what he says here I'm going to read
[21:13] it in the Amplified actually I'm going
[21:15] to read it in three different um three
[21:18] different uh versions I guess of the
[21:21] Bible the Amplified and a couple other
[21:23] ones because I want you to understand
[21:24] this from whence comes Wars and
[21:26] fightings among you so now we take it a
[21:29] little bit more personal it's not
[21:30] happening in Israel not happen in
[21:32] Ukraine but there can be war and strife
[21:35] that happens in your own
[21:38] home in your own
[21:40] church in your own
[21:42] family War Strife contention what is the
[21:48] source but he says what is the source of
[21:50] wars and fights among you now come on
[21:53] I'm just G to stop in wait a minute you
[21:55] know there can be Strife happened
[21:56] between brothers and sisters you know
[21:59] that Satan would like you to war against
[22:00] one
[22:01] another to fight against one another to
[22:04] fight against other churches and and and
[22:06] shoot you know misguided
[22:09] missiles over the pulpit to other
[22:12] churches and you see it all goes back to
[22:15] the same Spirit of resentment and
[22:17] jealousy and hatred and their church is
[22:20] not as good as our church all that is
[22:22] there's nothing in that in the kingdom
[22:24] of God we need to get rid of all of that
[22:27] there's no perfect Church can you say
[22:29] Amen there's no perfect Church anywhere
[22:31] there there's we're we're flawed
[22:33] individuals we're flawed human beings
[22:35] that n we all need the same Christ that
[22:39] every human being needs in this world
[22:41] and we need the reality of him but there
[22:44] isn't it's Baptist Pentecostal whatever
[22:47] Church it is here here Among Us it's
[22:49] it's it's all the same because people
[22:51] are the same we need the same God we
[22:54] need the same word that comes from the
[22:56] Lord but you see now he says now so
[22:58] we're all admitting now we can have wars
[23:00] among us we can have Strife in our own
[23:02] home a marriage can have Strife a
[23:04] marriage could have
[23:06] War until there's a divorce right
[23:09] sometimes irreconcilable differences and
[23:11] it's because you had War for 20 years in
[23:13] your marriage somebody said let's just
[23:14] stop the war that's it it's over instead
[23:16] of clinging into Christ to try to get an
[23:18] answer and so you have war in a marriage
[23:20] you can have war in a home you can have
[23:22] war with your children you can have
[23:23] strice Strife that happens among you
[23:26] even in the church but here's what he
[23:27] says in a couple places what is the
[23:29] source read it with me uh James 4:1 and
[23:32] I'll read it in this ver version here
[23:34] what is the source of wars and fights
[23:36] among you don't they come from your
[23:38] passions that wage war within you what
[23:42] is the source of conflict among you what
[23:44] is the source of your disputes don't
[23:46] they come from your Cravings or that are
[23:49] at war in your own lives what is causing
[23:52] all the quars and fights among you isn't
[23:54] it your desires battling inside you
[24:00] so there's a truth here in Scripture
[24:02] that we must admit that if you're
[24:04] complaining about strife and War among
[24:07] you in your home in your family in your
[24:09] church the first place you need to look
[24:12] as the problem is with within your own
[24:15] heart and he says if you're having war
[24:17] and struggles in the marriage and family
[24:19] or with other people with your boss if
[24:21] there's constant struggles and you're
[24:24] being affected by it then you need to
[24:26] look at your own heart because there's
[24:27] actually a war going on in
[24:31] you and there's not supposed to be a war
[24:33] going on in
[24:35] us we're supposed to be carriers of the
[24:38] peace of God we should we're supposed to
[24:40] hold so much peace within us and so much
[24:41] of God within us and the love of God
[24:43] shed abroad in our hearts that it
[24:45] doesn't matter what environment someone
[24:47] could spit in our
[24:49] face and by the way there was a man that
[24:52] spit on David one time and disrespected
[24:54] David and his because David was a type
[24:58] of Christ will never understand this
[25:00] response but it's a Christlike response
[25:02] he spit on him and one of his soldiers
[25:05] David soldiers says he disrespected the
[25:07] king that's it he's done took a sword
[25:09] out ready to do something and David said
[25:11] don't kill him leave him alone God told
[25:13] him to do that Christ coming out of
[25:16] David that response does not come from
[25:18] human
[25:19] beings that comes from Christ David says
[25:23] if I go to the lowest hell God is there
[25:27] he would be with me there
[25:30] it's almost like we live in hell today
[25:32] it's almost like we've already reached
[25:34] it it's just so much so much to it so
[25:37] much hatred Satan's Eden that we live in
[25:40] can you say Amen it's just this whole
[25:43] world is wrong it's it's it's not right
[25:45] there's a few good people in it and I
[25:47] thank God for them I thank God for real
[25:49] people and real Christians and there's
[25:52] some good people thank God for that but
[25:54] the world because they've left the word
[25:57] they're they're getting off track more
[25:59] and more and it's becoming more and more
[26:00] evil all the time and there's more
[26:03] hatred but war on the outside means
[26:05] there's there's war and conflict on the
[26:07] inside unresolved bitterness resentment
[26:10] jealousy see I have to bring this down
[26:11] to our own lives unresolved jealousy
[26:14] unresolved bitterness unresolved anger
[26:17] and Lust For against someone else or
[26:20] towards someone
[26:21] else it's it's it's saying that I I I'm
[26:24] at peace and rest inside with myself
[26:27] with God that's where we need to be is
[26:28] that we need that peace and rest and
[26:31] Holy Spirit dwelling there shed abroad
[26:33] with the love of God in our hearts
[26:35] inside of us can you say Amen towards
[26:38] God towards others and if we have that
[26:41] there'll be less war and strife in our
[26:45] family it's because you're James says
[26:48] you're you're lusting and you're you're
[26:51] struggling within
[26:52] yourself there's something going on
[26:54] within you you need to settle that
[26:57] struggle
[26:59] before you try to settle other Wars you
[27:02] could have all the peace talks that you
[27:04] want to you could have all the family
[27:07] dinners to try to make peace but if you
[27:10] walk into that and your heart is not
[27:12] resolved of the hatred and bitterness it
[27:14] will do no good where is my security
[27:17] that I would be one that could endure
[27:19] all of this endure what endure the
[27:21] hatred endure the people offended
[27:25] endure the the evil that's around us
[27:29] endure the struggle sometimes that's
[27:31] even Among Us Lord how you said endure
[27:34] to the end somebody's going to endure it
[27:35] how do I do it what have you provided
[27:38] for me and in this Romans 5 and verse
[27:41] one therefore being justified by faith
[27:45] we have peace with God through our Lord
[27:48] Jesus Christ if you want to talk about
[27:49] the source of peace in the soul you have
[27:52] to talk about how the great judge said
[27:55] you were guilty but Christ Our lamb went
[27:57] to Cal and paid the price for our sin
[28:00] you can't find a greater peace rise up
[28:03] in a heart to
[28:05] realize I've been justified by God thank
