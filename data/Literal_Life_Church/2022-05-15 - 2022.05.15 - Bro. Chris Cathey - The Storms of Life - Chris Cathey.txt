TRANSCRIPT
========================================
not worthy but god makes us work god bless you we're going to turn this morning to matthew matthew the eighth chapter matthew the eighth chapter god bless the musicians beautiful beautiful matthew 8 i want to speak on the storms of life this morning the storms of life it was up probably about three o'clock last night just really searching god's will and praying and praying and i feel like we go through a lot of storms in this day i believe what we do but we got a god that's right there beside us we might not see things in our lives and we go through things in life but this for a reason is the shape used to shape me just to build us shape us into the right person we're supposed to be matthew 8 verse 23 matthew 8 23 it says and when he was entered into a ship his disciples followed him you know that's a good place to be in his disciples if you're a disciple of jesus christ you're going to follow jesus christ you're going to follow the word of god you're going to follow what the prophet says and it releases to the word of god in this day verse 24 and behold there arose a great tempest in the sea and so much that this ship was covered with waves but he was asleep you're going to see as i go through these storms of life we could spend all morning but for what i'm speaking on this morning the storms of life you know there's one key pattern jesus was asleep and then it says verse 25 and his disciples came to him and awoke him saying lord save us we perish and he said unto them why are you fearful oh you've little faith then he arose or rebuked the winds in the sea and there was a great calm may god has blessed his may be seated father we just love you lord father we come into your house with thanksgiving and praise father how we just love you lord we just love to opening the word lord god your service is not complete without the hearing of your word father how it strengthens us father more than just the daily bread we eat but god it's our life god it's abundance that you fill us up father that that vessel just keeps getting full from an endless fountain of grace father may you bless this service may you bless this church may they continue to be a lighthouse here father father there's light in goshen this morning lord god may you just spread your wings of eagles and father may we bind our face together may we pull on the word this morning father we come in the name of jesus christ let us be an oracle for you in jesus name amen god bless you i just really like that it might be a little simple this morning but i tell you i believe god sent us a prophet with a seventh grade education where we could understand it i'm glad he stopped by mile this morning and say hey brother chris i'ma let you you can understand the word you can understand this message that we have but it says in his disciples verse 25 his disciples came to him and woke him saying lord save us we perish and he said to them why are you fearful oh ye of little faith you would think the disciples already saw the fish fry they think they saw everything you think the disciples would have the best faith you would think that a little storm or a raging storm in that day would not waver their faith you would think if you walked up to the disciples in that day it's so easy for us to say oh we believe this message or we we know all the quotes and we we know what the bible says but how are you acting through the storm how are you what are you preparing when you're when there's a storm and you you hear it on tv and you hear the or the radio or you see that we were at the thing we saw on the tv storm where the the at the hotel and the tv pops up and it shows the it shows the meteorologist he's sitting there telling you when the storm's going to take place and how to prepare for it and things like that but i think a lot of times we're not anchored in the word enough we're not reading what the prophet's saying or we're not anchored in the word enough to show to give your forecast to know what's going to happen in this day when covert arises we don't just sit around and just say well the devil's going to get victory but we still come to church when sicknesses arises and he said things wouldn't be a drop in the bucket to cancer and we hear things he's already prepared you and he's made preparation for the storm that we're in but i tell you the bride just has to rise a little farther above the storms and when you're in the airplane you've been we've been in many planes lately flying and i tell you you ever been in there and i tell you the first thing we do we walk through the plane and my wife and them will just keep on walking but i tell you i always want to look through the door to see who the captain is because i want to see who's flying that plane my wife and kids would just keep on walking they're worried about their seat i'm not worried about the seat i'm worried about who the captain of the plane is but i'm telling you we have an old ship of zion that's being controlled by jesus christ this morning there's god in your life as god in every aspect of your life this morning that every storm you battle whoever see you raging i tell you you've got jesus christ controlling that storm and i tell you how thankful we should be the one that put the stars in the space that conquer death hell in the grave that's who your conqueror is this morning i tell you i don't care what what you've come in here this morning anxiety depression it can leave you this morning i don't care what it is god can free you this morning he touched his sister's voice he can touch you this morning you've got a family that he's saved just claim him this morning he's wanting to do something for you this morning i don't care about all your storms just make sure jesus is in the boat i want to go to uh that was matthew or matthew what he said about it so let's go to uh mark let's see what mark mark 4 mark 4 35 and the same day when he when even has come he said unto them let us pass over to the other side jesus said let us pass them to the other side aren't you thankful that we have a command this morning that jesus said hey no matter what charms you're going through no matter what family problems i'm going to we're going to the other side and then it says 36 and when they sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship even as he was in this ship i'm glad that he was already there before they got there and it says and there was also there are little ships and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so it was now full and he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillow i don't know if you caught that this morning but maybe i'm simple but i was like wow jesus christ he has they have nothing on mr pillow these days what are you thinking a great thing they create everything they just get an idea from the bible he was asleep on the pillow before mr pillow created the pillow he was rested and they were in the storm and they awoke him and they said unto him master cares thou not that we perish and he arose and rebuked the wind and set unto the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm and then awesome verse 37 there's a great storm but in the midst of your great storm verse 39 there's a great calm for your storm no matter what storm you're going through whatever you came through this morning they're a great storm but there's a great calm to your storm there's a great the i all i am i am there's a great absolute we can trust this morning and then we're going to go read what luke said luke 8 turn to luke 8 verse 22 luke 8 22 it says now it came to pass a certain day that he went into the ship and his disciples said let us go to the other side of the lake and they launched forth but as they sail he fell asleep and there came down a storm of the wind of the lake and they filled with water and they were in jeopardy and he came to him and walked up saying master master we perished then he arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water and there's ceased and there was a calm and then he goes back into their faith it's impossible to please god without faith without faith that's the key this morning is having faith no matter what you're going through no matter what you've been through he's took you where he took you from you can look when you were a child to the age you are now he's took you and he took you through all different types of storms or trials or tribulations but he says they're more precious than gold that's what the bible says they're more precious than gold i'll just take the gold this morning tomorrow the rest of the week might be a rough day but i tell you i still serve my god i'll serve my god brother baby said in the oncoming storm 1960 i love this in paragraph 20. he said the church doesn't make you a christian the church only helps you to be a christian it helps you remain what you've been born into it helps you contain your experience read that again the church doesn't make you a christian the church only helps you to be a christian helps you aren't you thankful that we have a lighthouse here aren't you think we've got brother paul these ministers here that's being a lighthouse here in here in michigan i it's not to be a it's like i want to say it helps you to remain what you've been born into helps you to contain your experience where you're fellowshipping together with brethren of precious faith we're fellowshipping together this morning so when people tell you we don't need church and we don't need this you need church the prophet there's nothing in the in the message that says we don't need to go to church there's nothing in the bible that doesn't say it says more so as the days of approaching i tell you just call me a fanatic about the word but i am fanatic about jesus christ because that is that is all i got that's what's kept me through this fire this has got me and when you get anchored in jesus christ through every storm through every trial he carries us through broad ramp says in the mighty conqueror and this goes to relating to what i'm uh reading today he said old satan he said satan tried he said he tried again to do everything one night laying on the back of the ship he's seen him asleep and he said listen to this and he said i'll destroy him right now this is satan he says are you thankful for a prophet that can look through here and just pull it right out and bring it to our level he says he said he's seen him asleep he said i'll destroy him right now but he couldn't he tried to tempt him into doing the wrong thing but he couldn't do it he said why i want you to pay attention to this right here he said because he'd been sprayed with the repellent of predestination he was sprayed with the repellent predestination so i'm here to tell you this morning i don't care what trials you go through i don't care whatever your boat's shaking this morning but i'm here to tell you this morning you've been sprayed with the repellent of predestination and that's something that should put something in you this morning i'm not talking about the fertilizer on this corn this morning i'm talking about the fertilizer when you get sunk in the holy ghost and the holy ghost spills you from the head to you of every fiber of your bones and i'll tell you you'll dance like david dance you'll start running these aisles like david dance when you trust god with all your life every storm you go through in life i'll tell you when you've been sprayed with the repellent of predestination no devils in hell can come against your family no devils can take your life until god is ready that's our god he said no no the word said he'd be here amen there ain't no devil going to bother him he said no other son of god that's predestinated to take his place he is sprayed with a repellent of satan repellent satan's poison denominational daughters don't even touch him at all he moves right along nothing going to bother him see he's the man when he was laying out there on that ship that night he said he floated around ten thousand devils ten thousand devils coming after jesus you don't think he's coming after you today your family whoever he's got but i tell you greater is he that is in me the he that's in the world he said ten thousand devils on the sea swore they would drown him he said that little old ship bombing up and down like a bottle stopper he said devil says i got him now he's asleep laying there he said he's so tired from healing the sick too he can't move he said he was a man when he was laying there asleep that's true probably said but when he put his foot on the brow of the boat he looked up and said peace be still that was more than a man he said that was more than a man that was god speaking out of the sun hallelujah it's true he was a man that night laying in the back of the little boat out on the stormy sea that little boat was tossed about like a bile stopper but he said but once he arose he walked forward to his foot on the brow of the boat and looked towards heaven said peace be still and he and the winds and the waves obeyed them that was more than a man speaking there that was the great mighty conqueror that was the great mind that's who we serve this morning we don't just know the father by some creed or denomination today we know the father and we have a personal relationship with him and i tell you when it gets on the inside it's like from the inside out like the dove it cleans from the inside and it changes every aspect there's things in my life it's still shaving off because i'm not into a true adoption to to the uh theophany this morning but he still every time you come through these doors every trial you face is for your reason it's for your good brother said it's because he's got confidence in you and confidence in you he said he spoke to the wind and when he went to the cave like a puppy dog in the side of the lion he spoke to the waves and they folded their hands in perfect rest upon the sea bosom he was more than a man he was a mighty conqueror he could conquer nature he could conquer death he could conquer the waves he could conquer the air there he is he said there's never been one like him oh i know that you think i'm excited i love what he says because i feel the same way this morning he said maybe i am but let me alone he said you may think i'm crazy but i'm a lot happier this way than i was the other way i was a lot happier this way when you see your kids in church and you see them dancing in the spirit would you rather have them dancing and singing in here than out some dogs are in the world and not dancing over in that spirit hey just don't even sit there and criticize on them just say lord oh just pour the blessing on them oh a poor blessing they can't contain i always want to have my kids in the in the presence of jehovah because this world will try to change you for the worse but when you get one touch of the holy ghost he'll take all your situations you might still go through them but i'll tell you at least he's in the boat at least he's in the boat so i'm here to tell you this morning even if jesus is in your boat you're still going to go through storms even if jesus is in your boat this morning you're going through a storm okay he's asleep i just want him in the boat if he's in the back of the boat the front of the boat asleep in the boat driving the boat i just want him in my boat i just want him like controlling the boat i like what matthew said he was a great tempest mark said it was a great storm luke said the waters were raging this ain't just a little story they they told all night he says in the bible if you look through there for time it says he come in the fourth watch there's four watches that that first watch between like six and nine the second watch nine to eleven nine to twelve and then twelve to three and three the six he they told for three miles and the second storm i'm gonna go to this morning they told for three miles he says they they throw for three miles and then jesus shows up right there at the end i believe that's what we're going through right now i believe all the hells of waves because satan know his time is short i believe we're going through the raging of hell we're all in a boat together this morning but we just need to get in the boat and grab an order this morning i'm not talking about talking about one another i'm talking about getting the boat and start rowing one way to another and not go against one brother or one sister but get in the boat because we're going to a destination that's headed for victory and for cavalry it's already a paid price he's already paid it all death hell and grave has already conquered if he takes you for this right now it takes me on the road as i leave praise god i'm already in this dimension oh praise god it's just that rachel sings that song they'll speed up they'll slow down i'm looking for that day every time i get up and all that every time the sun turns and i wake up a little older i say lord i just want to be more like you i just on that day i just no matter what i've been through in life it still don't come close to what you paid for your your vessel vestige was more marred than any other human on earth your ribs were hanging out you paid the ultimate price you went through he said he was tempted in all manners i'm so glad that he sent jesus christ who came in the body himself came in the body because he wanted to see how we could be tempted because you know what he was tempted in all manners so if you're going through a trial this morning trust god this morning trust god because he said he was tempted for any manner that you've been through this morning and when you can talk to the father he's like i've been through that i've been through that sister i was tempted that way and that way he can make intercession upon our confession this morning i'm thankful we have that just make sure he's in the boat brother says why were people so tossed about 1956. he said let the storms rage my anchor holds with the veil can't tell you why we have a lot of storms on the seas this day but i'm thankful for an anchor that holds steadfast within the bell he said when she's a rocket it looks like every move she'll she send her into the bottom yet my anchor is in the veil i've anchored in the bell he said i've anchored in jesus the storms of life i brave i've anchored in jesus i fear no wind or wave i've anchored in jesus for he had power to save i've anchored in the rock of ages just like that sister was singing earlier i tell you what i'm not ashamed of the gospel i'm not ashamed of this message i'm not ashamed i'll tell you what wherever i go i want to proclaim it i don't care what i've gone through in life i want to tell you about jesus christ what he's done for me what storm he's brought me through if i'm going through a storm i'm going to still praise them if i'm in the middle of a storm i'm going to still give to the church i don't care that's when it shows you're a christian when you're going through a storm and you still can say here brother here's some money i don't have it and then the next day we've had many times where you give money and all of a sudden you'll be home and a check come in the mail for four times that much more oh it's like the in fact the lady when elijah came up towards which all she had was the more sore bread uh just one meal left and he said hey that it don't matter hey here here it here it's all but it didn't become dry he just kept filling it up because he saw our faithfulness he saw our faithfulness joseph meeting his brother in 1956 he said when he's when the sea is blowing and storms did you ever i guess maybe some of you have ever seen privilege of a sea anchored oh my i rode them when they throw out to the sea anchor like that until the little craft could couldn't even go over the top of the wave he said i would go through the wave he said it would go through the wave but as long as the anchor held that's all that makes the difference as long as you're anchored you asked some of the old-timers in here this morning you asked the sister over here you asked sister lafontaine and things like that this morning what's kept you and she'll probably most likely she's going to say jesus christ she's going to tell you jesus has brought me through everything i thought it was the biggest storm the greatest tempest but it was a great calm that's come through every storm in life every trial every tribulation my family's not saved i'll tell you don't quit don't give up on them the devil wants you to give up on them this morning but i tell you you keep claiming them you keep praying for you trust the word of god it says you can have your inheritance so go you can have it this morning oh there's going to be some people there just because your faithfulness think about it your faithfulness people will be there he said for the people that loved you brother abraham people that loved they will be there oh i take what grace what grace we have i'm not telling you to live a picnic live and just come to church and say well don't get it off of me no you keep getting in the boat and every day you might not feel like rowing the boat this morning you might have woke up not going to come to church you might have stayed up all night like me but i tell you i just tell you to get in the boat and i tell you to be consistent with your life be consistent with your prayer life be consistent with your giving be resistant with your outreach and i tell you just get in the boat and help one another this morning help one another he said oh my i rode them out he said the crap couldn't go over the top he would go through the way but as long as the anchor held that's all that makes the difference whether we go over it under it around it or through it doesn't matter the anchor holds that's the way when storms of light begin to shake us we may have to go through or we may have to go over around it he under it but just let the anchor hole within the veil to the unseen and brother ramp goes into talking about now i'm going to paraphrase this with time but he goes on talking about the little boy with the kite and he said he couldn't even see the kite he said but you know what he would do he would tug on it every once in a while have you tugged on jesus every once in a while and said i don't see you up there but hey are you still there just tug on them this morning say i'm going through the deepest trial i'm going through a family situation i'm going through a marriage situation i tell you to try jesus this morning he said he just tug on it he said tug on it he said i could feel it tugging he said if you could feel it still tugging god's dealing with your hearts he said then we know our anchor still holds first like peter said first peter 4 12-13 beloved think it and not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened to you but rejoice how hard is that when you're going through temptations and trial he says to do the opposite brother branham even says do the opposite he says but rejoices so much as ye partakers of christ's sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed you may be glad also with exceedingly joy have you ever went to the airplane and you get through there and i never finished that but you ever get up in the storm clouds and they tell you to buckle up right when you go to go to the bathroom i'll tell you that's happens to me all the time you got to go to the bathroom and they say sorry we have a weather forecast seat on the monitor about 20 minutes it's going to the storm's going to hit we want everybody to be seated nobody moving but i tell you aren't you thankful that god is the ultimate forecast don't you think that you work for the weatherman today don't you think that you have a weatherman upstairs that controls every every wave every storm you could you work for the weather man i tell you i told the boys the other day i said we work for the weather man boys we work for them i said because we have the great all the great weather man that they they can be so wrong on the weather that's right they tell you a story man we live in jeffersonville in the whole of the whole cloudiness and dreariness sometimes i think it's washington state and then when the sun comes out like i think the sun came out the other day and i said what is that wow wow that thing's beautiful what thing's shining down but i'll tell you the weatherman will tell you this and most time they'll be off and they still got a job think about it they tell you this tell you that it's going to rain it rain maybe an hour your whole plans get messed up well i was going gardening today well i get well we go do something and then all of a sudden you say well i could have done that today but i'll tell you it just shows you there's only one person you can put your 100 trust in and that's jesus christ because he controls the storms he controls we've been through airplanes where they said it's going to be the bumpiest ride the boys will start singing a song about he's the master of the wind we were in the plane the other day the other week and we were flying through a major storm i think it was it's been about a couple months ago brother john andy's church and it was so bad bumpy coming through there the boys started singing i'm telling you within minutes we've had the plane just start calming out and we call his presence in there and all of a sudden his it just starts coming out we on the other side of the storm he said well i thought it was going to be 20 minutes but uh oh i think we're through it y'all can go to the restroom now i say praise god we're gonna have revival in this sardine can we're gonna have a revival in this thing today because boys i'll tell you we live below our means today we christians are liberal our message this message is he brother said this became it's came to for you to live he said this message must live this message must live in you must live in me the word of god must live in us but i tell you i tell you it changed the circumstance because we called on the main weather man it said god i should calm this storm okay but i'll tell you i heard a story one time with the where the kids in the in the in the seat and they're getting through some hard hard trials and uh hard storms that is shaken to death and the lady's all nervous and shook up and she looks at him she says why are you still just just sitting there not enjoying playing your game or watching this or doing this he said you know why he said you know what this little kid said he said cause my daddy's the captain my daddy's the captain so i'm here to tell you our daddy's the captain this morning he's the captain of the whole ship of zion he's the captain of whatever you're going through i don't know what it is what trial god laid this on my heart this morning wherever you brought in here you can leave it here this morning you can walk away free this morning i don't care what baggage you brought in you go to the airport you walk in with your baggage i just want to tell you release your baggage this morning i tell you you walk up to the conveyor belt and you weigh it in isn't nothing like when you throw the baggage down and you don't have to carry that stuff anymore from the car to over here you don't carry it from the house to the car the car to the airport the airport to the to the conveyor belt and then you throw it on there but a lot of times we want to keep carrying the baggage around we want to walk around life and we just want to carry our baggage but jesus said he will set you free from your baggage he didn't come to hear that he's come to take all your baggage all your cares all your family problems just drop it off in the conveyor belt of jesus this morning let it go up a little bit let it go up to jesus if you've got a family problem throw it on the conveyor belt of jesus this morning he'll take every storm he'll take all your baggage and you know what the great thing about it is there's no weight limit there's no weight limit with jesus there's no weight limit they ain't a 50 pound weight limit and you don't have to already pay any more because he's paid the price at calvary he's paid it for you he's paid it for me this morning and i'm so glad they don't say pull your card out again we need your card mr kathy it's going to be 300 for your baggage because your wife packed the whole house [Applause] think about it this morning sorry sweetheart she's awesome i couldn't make it without life without her i tell you once you get a wonderful help mate you're blessed he said outside of salvation that's the second biggest thing right now and i'm blessed man but i tell you but just think about it you get on the plane and you uh we just get on the plane and you bring your baggage you hey it's so nice just to release it right before you get on the plane and you care about that baggage when you're going through the storm all you care about is your life you don't care if that plane you just want to touch down safely i've been through storms so many different storms i told the lady in the back she got all nervous and when the fire when when the stewardess gets nervous i'm starting to look at her and say well it's going to be a little rough because she just went on 12 other flights before you and you sit there and she gets all nervous and i told this one lady one time i was back by the by no i don't i don't like sitting in the back i like to be in the middle because you can just it just comes it's just a calm piece so i'm telling you to stay in the middle of the road this morning i'm telling you through life and through trials you stay balanced don't go far way to the right don't go far away to legalism go far to the right and this person this sister cuts her hair this hey just pray for them this morning i don't care what they're going through whatever store maybe you don't know what they've been through in their life maybe they grew up like me in toledo with a broke up hole but one day somebody gave me a message and said hey i love you brother i love you sister and they gave you a message and they said why are we not a nomination and that that that deep call to the deep responded and maybe you're a friend of you that came in this church this morning is going through a heartache or going through a trial or you're going through a tribulation hey just be salty to them this morning just say i love you put your arms around them i don't find anything in this message here says beat them down to a pulp nothing in this message they're not hearing what i'm hearing they're not studying what i'm studying always get confused when i hear this going on and this and that and i said they must not listen to their tapes truly i'm not talking about just pushing play in your house and just mopping the floor and it let be background noise i'm talking about something that you're actually getting the quiet of your home and you're listening to what god sent in this day that's talking to us that's feeding you and when you go to the gas station or you go somewhere where cova we travel more in colburn than we ever have i guess they knew we were the craziest family they said call the kathy they'll come we'd be out there singing the tune public gas they'd have gloves masks they'd have a whole suit on trying to get gas i'm out there praise god you want me to pump your gas brother let me pump it for you i'm not scared i said i serve a god that has a that has a cattle on a thousand hills this morning and if i get sick hey i'm not saying there's not real coping but there's a real god that we gotta put her absolutely in this one i'm tired of the devil beating you up he said he's coming to steal kill and destroy and that's what he's doing this morning he's doing it to the youth he's doing it to the young he's going to the earth he wants to get you so beaten down that you say well i just won't go to church this morning you know what i'll just stream i'll just stream now the devil's got you in your pajamas he's got you in your pajamas why are you drinking your coffee that's no different to nomination churches i'm not saying nothing's wrong with streaming because if you're truly sick it's a blessing but there ain't nobody that can ever tell me they're not coming to the house of god with us together today doesn't pull you stronger to jesus christ i tell you every time i'm in there when i'm sick or i'm in the bed and i watch you don't stream i said god i just can i somehow get there lord i just want to go and be a part of that service i want to get what god has sent me in this day [Applause] [Music] brother i said if you come to criticize you'll find some criticism you come to get something this morning you came to the right place not because of me it's because of him and when god makes a promise and opposition arise that's the only test whether you've got the word or not he said the man's that's not got good gold don't mind going to the testing stone to see bubram says he don't mind going to the testing zone i'll tell you what you might feel like right now you come in this church this morning and you're going through the largest tribe of your life and he's testing you but i tell you just keep trusting the lord keep trusting god because i tell you even if he takes you right now or takes you right i tell you broadband says death he says the devil can only take you to the end of the river and win after the river that's where life starts you know what we're just passing through this place you passed all these churches we passed this golf course over here this morning hey i'll tell you if i wouldn't say if i didn't know what i knew today i would probably be out there with them but it's the grace of god when i pass through i said thank you lord for stopping by my house one day and calling me from that golf course or some baller room or some other denomination this morning because i was coming to a church where there's light ons this morning and there's gosh there's light on in goshen this morning victory day when it looks like everything's wrong going wrong he said god's given you a trial and listen brother says this he's got confidence in you think about that this morning he said he's got confidence i tell you some of you are like wow he's got a lot of confidence in me because i'm going through so much i'm going through this i don't know which way's up i don't know which way is down but i tell you you got a god that knows every direction and knows every storm he knows it before you go through the trial before you go through the marriage problem whatever it is this morning he knows you're going through it i'll tell you to be steady in the boat and just say jesus guide me through this he said he's got confidence in you he don't have to have your baby around brave baby year round he there there's he said you're not a hotbed plant a hybrid you're a real christian god's given you the test to see what you'll do about it brother abraham says he's giving you a test to see what you'll do about it no wonder why peter said these fiery trials while counting the joy more precious than gold he said he's put his trust in you one harder i'll tell you when i sign up to the military and we're going i didn't want to go through any storm i didn't want to go through i'm telling you i'm just going to tell you now i i signed up for the gi bill i thought hey this is this will pay for school because daddy ain't going to pay for it so hey i'm going to sign up dad's handing this waiver i'm ready to go i need to get to a more established some kind of balance in my house and that didn't really have that or nothing i said well maybe the military helped me but you know what it still took jesus christ when i met him on the back side one day and i said lord come in my heart and i saw the message of the hour and i saw what the word said and i told the boys the other day i said boys you're going to learn the inside and the front and the back the middle you're going to learn every bit of this book i said because this is what keeps daddy going i said through every trial through every covenant through every sickness through every delta virus to an american airline virus i don't care what it is this morning this will get you through i said this will this will guide your life this will give you every every answer you've got there's a bible bible question there's a bible answer problem said now the fountain exhaustible fountain of life he should flow through us today lord and cleanse us from all unbelief and sin that we might stand in thy presence knowing that there is a need among us i love what he says here he said then his blood he said but then when we think of him who came and took our sins i love this then with his blood there it was not us in in the presence of god it's him just our voice through his blood his blood speaking aren't you thankful when he came in abel he said he came looking for cain he's able he came looking for abel he said i don't see him where is he he said but his blood speaks think about how much more jesus christ blood speaks this morning the innocent one when you start to speak you speak through the blood you claim jesus in every storm every trial every tribulation of what you're going through and he'll tell you he said his blood speaks i want his blood to speak in every aspect of my life every aspect but i tell you you know what the problem was with them they didn't rely on the master they didn't realize they've seen everything they saw the miracles just like in brother branham's meetings they saw miracles after miracles and you see it on the platform a deep call to the deep but you know what he would even look at brother billy paul one time and he says did you understand that service he said yes daddy he said did you understand that service he said yes daddy finally he said no daddy i did he said i could count on one hand how many people got that service but i tell you it's all in revelation brother braham said pray for revelation more than anything i say lord give me more revelation lord and this progression it's the progression walk if this sister or this young one or this brother is not there yet you keep encouraging them you know whatever they're going through the day don't get out kick them in the kick them in the leg or kick them whatever i tell you i want to tell you to encourage them so you keep pressing on brother i was but you know what's so great we have one another going through the storm because the other sister could have went through the same storm five years ago or this brother or whatever say brother i went through that i had a brother call me 11 o'clock i had a root canal the other day and my pastor called me up you asked rachel i got in the car and i'm just going to i'm going to give the devil a kick in his teeth right now and he calls me about 11 30. i'm hurting i'll just be honest i was hurting i was i was taking some medicine he called me up i was about to get in the shower i was fixing to get in he said hey brother would you go pray with this sister with me honestly i'll be honest i'm just going to be vulnerable today i was like oh i mean honestly think about we all big and bad when we're not going through things or going through storms but let them call you on the phone one time when you're hurting and you're doing this and you're walking to the bed he said hey brother would you go i said yes i will go i will go because i tell you what i serve a god that could take this tooth paint away as soon as i get in this car and i don't care how they drilled on this tooth for four hours but i don't care i serve a god if i die if i fall over going down to pray for i don't care god i'll just be in your presence so i got in the car and i said well sister i said brother what she need i said what's going on he said brother she's been facing with anxiety for like six years and she can't let it go this just happened the other day facing anxiety i started crying i started weeping because guess what i went through that i couldn't even get out of my bed because that will have me bound to anxiety he had me hooked up in anxiety and i started believing all his lies i had to carry the medicine in my body why i'm saying this this morning but i carry the medicine as a as uh you asked rachel i carry the medicine in my pocket because it was a crutch and i started relying more on the medicine than jesus christ i'm just being real and vulnerable today but i'm telling you i started to trust i started thinking i was somebody and the devil would just come right right around me i'd go down the street and i'd have to turn right back around because i couldn't even make it into my work job my job place and i would turn around and i would be shaking so much my heart be going 100 miles an hour i thought i was dying and i said lord and one day i just got in love with god and i said god i will die here until you take it from me i will die i will literally just keep praying lord i asked you and he finally took it from me so when i was hurting and i was going through that storm i got in that vehicle and i started going the street and i'm telling you i was in pain they drilled on that one tooth for four constant hours off and on and i got in that car and i started weeping and i started realizing that the storm that i went through years ago was the storm he was calling me for to go to pray for this sister i started realizing the storm that i went through this sister needed to hear about and i got in there and when i started telling her i said brother nathan you don't know the story i said let me tell you what happened to me about that time we got there and i told that sister about the story and about that time she got like she's been battling for years so she came to go outside she'll get outside she'll get started she has to go right back in and so we were in there talking to him and this just was just not long ago like the other week and i went in there we started praying and i started crying so let me tell you about a storm that i've been through and i said let me tell you who's the one that he'll heal me of that storm and i started telling her and she started weeping and she started realizing she needed to hear about my store and she started to realize whom i who i relied on that was in the boat that i didn't realize he was already in the boat i was outside the boat and then i started telling the storm we laid hands on her and she texted the other day she said god completely healed me she took away all my anxiety she took away all my she's held me completely i saw her in church the other day praising god i said that's the god we serve i'll tell you if you come with some baggage this morning i tell you to drop it off if it's a marriage problem drop it off if it's a storm you're going through drop it off because he's paid it all he set you free some of you just need to be free again some other you need your joy back david didn't lose his salvation he just lost the joy of his salvation some of it you just need your joy back some need your candle relent i'll tell you someone and some of you might need a refilling of the holy ghost this morning i'll tell you what i say lord drop a double portion on me this morning drop a double portion on me oh lord holy spirit give me some more of your love [Applause] can't even give me a double portion it's just like brother branham think about him think about the devil's kid came with the jesus in the boat they said you just read it he said he was trying to drown him thinking about his little his little child laying in the bed the devil got up on the shoulder and started saying won't you give up now once you give up now i know the devil's probably telling you that this morning he's probably saying hey give up let me tell you something where you gonna go where are you gonna go you got all you need it's just you need to rely on jesus christ you got all you need i've already been there if you haven't been in the denomination they ain't got nothing they ain't got they have got jesus christ like we got it and you know what you want to give them the key so much when i see a brother back at home or a college student a college student i went with and i say if i could just give this to you more than any dollar bill i'd rather just give you what i have i want to give you this i sav more than anything because there's a void in your life there's a void but brother abraham went through the same thing he had the devil climb up on the shoulder and say hey won't you give up he said he said blessed be the lord giveth and take it away and he said all of a sudden the atmosphere started to change he said it started to change in that room because he realized who he relied on but that came on the inside so what you rely on the storm matters what you rely on the storm matters you think about it they came peter james john they left matthew left tax collecting peter they all left fishing you would think they they would still have the faith of the world seeing all this but when they did when they went through the storm he said where's your faith where's your faith well i think a lot of times i want to read something i got to find it i think it's john first uh yeah uh john 6. this is about a second storm it talks about verse 15 to john 6 15 when jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force they they make him a king and departed again into a mountain alone and even even was now come his disciples went down to the sea and he entered into a ship and went over the sea i'm talking about another storm toward capernaum and now it now and now it was now dark and jesus was not come to them and the sea arose by reason of great wind that blew and so that i was just telling you that about them rowing they rode about five to twenty or thirty four loans that's about three miles and jesus walking on the sea and drove them nigh in the ship and they were afraid but he said to them it is i be not afraid and then willingly receive them into the ship and immediately i love that and immediately the ship was at land isn't it unbelievable no matter what storm you're going through no matter what trial you're going through when jesus shows up you're immediately over to the other side [Applause] isn't it wonderful that no matter what you're going through whatever trial you're going through that jesus can immediately just take you and put you for what you've been strolling through or your whole life and just immediately put you where you need to be and put you in the place you need to be i tell you oh we got a god that can can do it all and just put you right where he needs you to be immediately he can do that this morning if you have a sickness or a trial or what anxiety i don't care what it is he immediately can heal you it could be tomorrow it could be the next day it can be two years from now it could be when you get your theophany but he's still going to heal you he's still going to heal you but like all three of these passages jesus was asleep i read earlier but i know we're we're coming down on time but one thing i really like luke 8 8 2. i want to bring some of these out if you don't mind luke 8 luke 8 22 i'm sorry mark four go to mark 4 mark 4 35 it says and he said in the same day when they even was come he said unto them let us pass over to the other side you know what you can do go write something down i can rest on jesus's commands i can rest on all his commands whatever he tells you in this word you can rest on whatever someone tells you on facebook don't rest on or on twitter or all these other nine nonsense i tell you to rest on all these commands he tells you you're a uh you're saved by grace you take your you take it over what the devil tells you this morning if you're going through a trial say get behind me satan i tell you we need to start telling the satan more and start stop talking to them like it's like amazon i'll tell you we i don't know why i'm going here this morning but we order a lot of amazon boxes every time i come home i always go to the front door because i'm always looking for an amazon box and i'll give it five o'clock six o'clock eight o'clock there's always the amazon box and i walk out you know the funny thing is you know ups makes you sign for most of your packages amazon don't think about it i thought about studying the other day i said that's the devil i want to do that to you and me he puts your package right where you need to see it and he reminds you of it every day and you know what you don't even try to sign for it he just redelivers it to you it sits it right there but ups makes you sign for it but i know a god that signed on day of calvary has took every sin every garbage you got this morning every anxiety every storm you're going through and he signed and sealed and delivered it this morning for you to leave free this morning that's the god we serve but we can rest on his commands hebrews 13 5 and 6 let your conversation be without covenants and be content with the such things you have i say lord help me let me be content with what i got for he has said i will never leave thee nor forsake me that's the command that's a promise this morning so that we may boldly say the lord is my helper i will not fear what man shall do unto me why are we worried about what people can do to us we got the word of god we got the truth we got the word we got the message of the hour the problem is we're not it's not living in us sometimes we're not in it enough we have the instruction manual we have the instruction manual i tell you to just bury your head in this bury your life in it that's all i can lead you to this morning but it's nothing but the truth romans 8 28 and we know that all things work together for good that love god and that are called according to his purpose if you're called and you love god who it says and we know that all things work together for good no matter what you're going that's hard to say when you're going through a trial that's hard to say when you're in the boat and the boat ship and it's shifting rachel will remind me all the time she said well here comes monday and tuesday stuff will start hitting and i just she'll send me a text and have to remind me and i'll say thank you honey i needed that or she'll open the word that morning and i'll open it and show up into another scripture we might read the same scripture that morning or she'll send a quote or a text that i've read and it'd be the same one that i read broadband said that's the way he does resurrection of jairus daughter he said just about the time he gets to the very darkest of hour then jesus comes we fret we worry we christians and the baby gets sick or something happens something doesn't show up well we just get nervous and upset brother said we just sit quiet he said we should just sit quiet he's the one who commanded it that's hard but it's the truth he said we're living under his disposition living under his grace just sit still and he'll be along after a while he said don't worry he'll open up a healing service somewhere or guide you somebody to pray for the sick or god say talk about somebody he said he'll guide you who guys you could pray for somebody to lift them up send them a card in the mail when's the last time you called a sister or brother that went away from this church or send them a note i don't know why i'm saying this today when's the last time you picked up a card and said hey we miss you instead just talk about it was the last time you just picked up the note and maybe put a little gift card and said hey i love you go get you something to eat he says you know boys were riding on the road the other day we're talking about storms and i have to live it every day more more so and i look at the boys and every time about somebody this and that disrespected them i see you know the bible says boys we were driving on the road i said you tells you to love them more that despitefully use you i said boys the more that come against you the more the people that despitefully use you you love them more and that's hard to do because he's teaching me to love them even more john 16 33 these things that have spoken to you that you might he said that that in me sorry these things that i spoke with you that in me you have might have peace he said i love this in the world you should have tribulation but be a good cheer i have overcome the world jesus christ overcome the world i tell you stop living down in the dumps oh you got something to be happy about this morning if you woke up you got breath in your body i tell you if you don't believe it go to the hospital walk down the aisle for a minute go to the nursing home where my father-in-law was and you just walk through and it's depression on every corner but i tell you if you've got breath in your body we should be praising the lord this morning saying lord thank you for everything you brought me through thank you i might be going through a story but i'm going to praise you through this storm praise them in the storms but you know what they're survivors in the storm and you're it's me and you this morning they're still survivors there's i mean we're all in this boat shaking we don't know what's coming tomorrow we don't know brother brown said waiting for that last one just that one to push the atomic bomb button yeah but you know what we don't even look at that we don't look at that because he said before the first bomb dropped the bride will be going farewell farewell sweet hour of prayer i tell you i'm not worried of what putin can do i'm not worried about body can do because they're just it's all going accordingly to his purpose he's put the right priest and one day they'd like the wrong president and i'll tell you what they i feel like they might have but who cares just keep loving for jesus keep staying in the boat keep rolling your oar i tell you this morning just to get you an oar and you just keep roaring i tell you to get in the bowl with me and let's just keep roaring don't don't start rolling backwards we need to be on one accord be in consistency this morning i'll tell you what you saw in these scriptures there was consistency in their life because no matter what they went through no matter what wave they went through they kept roaring the boats and i'm here to tell you to keep rolling the boats i don't care what devil's telling you what he's told you this morning what he's lied to you about your family just throw the boat just keep rolling the boat and you will get to your destination [Applause] just keep rolling the boat he said he conquered the patriarch abraham he conquered both dale death and hell he rose up on the third day he said i have overcome and because i live you live also oh what a promise brother brown said that's the seed of abraham he conquered the grave he rose up on the third day for justification and he said when he rose up he was our justification what does that make us he said he conquered sickness he conquered death he conquered hell he conquered the grave he conquered temptation oh now we have more than conquerors through him that loved us and gave his life for us being a royal seed of abraham you're a royal seed this morning we are more than conquerors i love that song john 14 27 peace i leave unto you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth i give unto you let not your heart be troubled no neither let it be afraid peace i leave you isn't that wonderful what a promise my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth i i give unto you let not your heart be troubled never let it be afraid i tell you i love these scriptures so inspiring for time i want to skip over a few things the key to the door he said there's only one door to healing and as jesus is at that door there's only one door to peace and he said my peace i give unto you he's only one door to genuine peace you might think you got peace you might accumulate enough money to buy your home you might accumulate enough money to get your children closed have food to eat you might accumulate enough money popularity to popular amongst people he said but when you slip off your shoes at night and get ready to lay down there's only one thing that can give you peace and he said that is if you know if you were dying that night there's only one peace that's jesus is the peace he is our peace he's our healing i'm the lord thy god that heals i the diseases he's the door to heaven and there's only one door he said there's only there's no i'm sorry there's only there's no other door no other way but through jesus christ he's the door to heaven and now jesus is at that door and all those things and faith is the key that unlocks the door faith is the key that unlocks the door you want the key this morning it's not by being afraid in jesus christ when you're going through storms but just have faith he's going to bring you through it he said now jesus is at the door to all these promises of god faith is he he said in his finished work unlocks every door to every treasure there is inside the kingdom of god see key he said he is faith is the key that unlocks every promise secondly we can rest within one another i want to show you this mark 4 36 mark 4 36 it says and when they when they sent away the multitude i love this they took him even as he was in the ship so they already believed he was already there in the ship and there was also with him other little ships isn't that good there was also loyal ship so don't think you're in the storm by yourself don't think when you're going through a trial that there's not us and one another going through that trial before or we haven't went through because there's other little ships maybe beside you that are starting to sink that you can go over there and rescue come by then put put your arm around them and say i've been praying for you you're going to make it i went through that storm i went through that battle i went through that colon problem i went to whatever it is cancer i don't care what it is anxiety i went through it but there's other little ships in this church and you know what you need one another you need one another you need to support the ministry support the pastor i tell you when these doors are open i'll tell you what i don't just say this because i'm here today i tell you every time we go on a sunday i don't care you ask rachel no matter where we go on vacation i'm gonna go get a piece of bread i said boys rachel i might not be speaking let's just go find let's go get let's go find a local church where we could go get some bread it could be all our vacation maybe call me crazy or call me old-time pentecostal but i just love being together with love with with and you know what you know what the devil will tell you this morning hey you're coming to church because you know all these perfect people you know what no we're here because we're trying to get we're trying to come to perfection i'm in this church right now because i want to be a better person than i was yesterday i want to be a better person tomorrow i'll tell you i got false in every way but i say lord just shave off all the faults and lord i come to your house empty vessel lord fill me up clean me up keep changing my life make me talk different act different love one another better i tell you the devil wants to tell you not to come here because there's perfect people but i tell you we're all gonna be different shapes in our lives different storms in our life but god is the the main control he's on the main control tower today and he sees everything that's in the radar he's already seen it and he'll get you through and there's other little ships i love that i love that and three you can rest in his companionship you can rest in it you can rest in it all three stories jesus is in the boat he's in the boat but i want to bring something out of love i caught this the other night brother paul genesis verse seven you know when there was another boat was being built the ark over a hundred and something over 120 years he built the ark you don't think he went through trials you don't think they said quit believing the message give up why don't you give up why don't you stop why don't you why you believe it you know what you keep believing it because one day he said the pastor you would line up with your pastor and then they're right behind the prophet and the prophet will present us to jesus christ he said you would get in line with your pastor and your pastor your your church-aged messenger what a day of revival that's gonna be i tell you i'm so excited when i get there brother i'll tell you what i've heard brother paul paul be like brother chris calm down come here brother come here cause i'm i'm gonna be running the streets of glory praising god they're gonna say where's rachel at they're gonna she gonna say well she's over up on the hill somewhere she's gonna rest for the first 10 000 years because you spoke too much you talk too much she's resting over there i don't well just let it rest because i'm gonna have a time in the lord by what genesis 7 said alright with jesus said and the lord said unto noah come did you know jesus was already in the boat he didn't say go he said come on i don't you catch head this morning but i went how about revival the other day he said then the lord said unto noah come now and all thine house into the ark oh jesus was already in the boat he said come he didn't say go to the boat he said come to the boat we've already got it prepared i got a place i prepared for you so just come come to the house of god come to the holy spirit this morning if you've got anxiety i'll tell you to come right now after you've gotta i saw musicians come i tell you if your family's broke up come right now to the living water i tell you come get some what god's got for you this morning if you want to be healed i say calm i say come this morning if the waters are raging i say come he didn't say go he didn't say get in the boat he said come i love david 37 25 he said i've been young and now i've been old yet i have not seen the righteous forsaken nor i've seen this seed begging for bread i'm giving you a lot of promises this morning i'm just feeling you i'm putting so much in you this morning i'm just loading you down when you go through trials you got something to go to this morning and you know what it's more than just coming to church and listening to me wrap it just share this share that why don't you try it sometime why don't you try it sometime i say try jesus and i'll tell you it'll make you not be the same person anymore because i get around my dad he said you just talked like a foolish person i said dad leave me alone i'm i'll tell them something i'm not drunk like you suppose anymore i'm drunk in the holy ghost and when this gets hit on the inside and my brother said he went to that teaching well we went to jeffersonville not long ago we were in the area almost by hour away and we went to that same artesian well and that thing's still bubbling today that thank you ask rachel we will go over there we'll go on the tour in jeffersonville we'll bring people to the teaching well he talks about we'll play the tape and that thing's just still bubbles hundreds a year i mean it still bubbles and he says why are you bubbling what's going on he said because there's something on the inside there's some on the inside that's bubbling through every storm through every trial there's some on the inside that overcomes all stars because he said are you coming tribulation but i have overcome the world i've overcome i tell you what trust jesus this morning i want to leave you with this as they play something softly i want to leave you with this because it really blessed my heart you ever thought about this and this hit me the other night when they were breaking bread the last supper think about this they were breaking bread the last supper oh this was this just hit home the other day rachel probably like what in the world's going down in that basement i know she does she'll hear me just clap and praising god i'd be four in the morning and i say she said you come in the bed you ask me at least six times i say honey you go to bed and rest in christ i said because i'm having the best time of my life i said i wish i could have met him a long time ago amen all right brother brandon i wish i could have seen him a lot earlier on in life young kids let me tell you something you know why i was thinking i don't know why i'm saying this this morning if you're dating someone or you're talking to someone and they're not they're not they're not a godly christian and they don't love god more than you [Music] you don't know business talking to him you really don't because i grew up in a broke up home a miserable home but god mended it back with a loving wife that kept herself all her life for a poor richard like me [Music] but i tell you what that's mercy but i'm here to tell you you might have a broken heart now but you'd rather have a broken heart than a broken home you'd rather have a broken heart than a broken home you'd rather have it because you got to live within the rest of your life but when you find love you find a mate you're blessed you got a mom and dad that believes this message that you can i can't call on the phone and say dad i can't believe this court i heard you know this and that he you're crazy son you've lost your mind i said dad i'm still praying for you i don't come against him i say dad i love you i claim you i say dad i'm still your son that's what the father did with you and me one day he went to the garbage dump one day you ever been to garbage jump and it's all smelly and you walk through and you walk through this trash and you don't realize why he picked you up he picked the bottle up and said brother get in we're gonna clean this vessel out [Music] but then there's other trash still there that's amazing grace but i love what kept paul i mean i love what it kept noah you know what we know what made noah a survivor let me get to it you know what made him a survivor through the flood and all that you know what makes you a survivor verse 8 of verse 6. but noah found grace in the eyes of god you found grace in the eyes of god that's what you found this morning it's more than just a message this is the
