[0:00] would you read with me tonight Leviticus
[0:01] 23
[0:03] and verse 1 we'll read a section of
[0:04] scripture here and I wanted to continue
[0:06] a little bit what I touched on on Sunday
[0:08] and maybe break it down a little bit
[0:10] step back and maybe revisit some things
[0:13] from Sunday and also revisit some things
[0:15] we spoke on years ago
[0:17] and bring these back up again for the
[0:20] new ones that have come Leviticus 23 is
[0:23] a study we've worked on through the
[0:25] years and really enjoy it and to see the
[0:28] Fulfillment of these feasts and so I
[0:30] thought I'd since I talked about Sunday
[0:31] we'll talk about it again tonight on a
[0:33] little bible study and just learn a
[0:35] little bit more about it and especially
[0:37] for some of the new ones that have come
[0:38] amen Leviticus 23 and verse 1 says and
[0:42] the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak
[0:44] unto the children of Israel and say unto
[0:46] them
[0:47] concerning the Feast of the Lord which
[0:49] ye shall Proclaim to be holy
[0:51] convocations even these are my feasts so
[0:55] their holy convocations I want you to
[0:57] remember that term God calls these
[1:00] feasts holy convocations even these that
[1:03] are my feet six days shall work shall
[1:06] work be done but the seventh day is the
[1:09] Sabbath of rest
[1:10] a holy convocation you should you shall
[1:14] do no work therein it is the Sabbath of
[1:16] the Lord in all your dwellings these are
[1:18] the feasts of the Lord even holy
[1:21] convocations which ye shall Proclaim in
[1:25] their seasons and Proclaim us not just
[1:27] that you're confessing it but it's
[1:29] you're celebrating it you're you're
[1:31] exercising these these seasons and these
[1:34] convocations and these feasts in other
[1:36] words you're you're coming to them
[1:38] you're attending them and you are
[1:40] proclaiming them that is happening now
[1:42] so these are the feasts of the Lord even
[1:45] holy convocations which he shall
[1:47] Proclaim in their Seasons so every one
[1:50] of them has a season and as the prophet
[1:53] taught us we should always be working
[1:55] within the season that God is in
[1:59] and if you're doing something out of
[2:01] season like if you're trying to do
[2:03] something in the spring season and it
[2:05] didn't belong in the spring it belonged
[2:07] more in the fall we don't normally do
[2:09] that we work with the seasons that we're
[2:11] in at the time uh somebody who would
[2:14] come and offer uh hot chocolate around
[2:17] the fire Outside In The Heat Of Summer
[2:20] when it's 100 degrees that just doesn't
[2:22] really go together to have hot chocolate
[2:24] around a burning fire it's out of season
[2:25] but you know invite me over for uh
[2:28] around the fire pit you know about
[2:30] October November with the hot chocolate
[2:32] and
[2:33] some s'mores and whatever else you want
[2:35] to give me and and I'm there I'm there
[2:37] because why it's in season it's in
[2:39] season but we know how crazy it is to
[2:41] try to do something out of season and
[2:43] God's the same way how many know that
[2:45] Ecclesiastes says to everything there's
[2:47] a season there's a time so we have to
[2:50] work with God's season if we're trying
[2:52] to do something out of season he's
[2:54] trying to do this and we're trying to
[2:55] reach back here to another season we're
[2:57] trying to reach forward we're getting
[2:58] out of God's will God's continuity but I
[3:01] want to be found just submissive to the
[3:03] season God's in and I want to be right
[3:05] there with them amen Lord bless your
[3:07] word tonight and pray you anoint it
[3:09] father and give it to us again just as
[3:11] you gave it to me today as we met you in
[3:14] Jesus name amen God bless you may be
[3:16] seated so we're just going to revisit a
[3:19] few things about the the feast as we
[3:22] were on Sunday he got pretty excited
[3:23] about
[3:24] and uh I didn't realize until today that
[3:28] when I speak about the Holy convocations
[3:31] that God has here he called them holy
[3:33] convocations he called these seven
[3:36] feasts that he said that would be three
[3:38] times a year the children of Israel come
[3:40] and visit Jerusalem three times a year
[3:42] and there would be a celebration there
[3:44] would be a feast and every one of these
[3:45] feasts are different the first three
[3:47] happen together and then just a little
[3:48] while after the fourth one happened and
[3:50] then later in the season in the fall
[3:52] they would come back for the last three
[3:54] but three uh they had to visit Jerusalem
[3:57] and come for these these celebrations
[3:59] and these things that acknowledge God
[4:02] and what God was doing got what God did
[4:04] and so now I didn't realize uh when it
[4:07] was speaking about convocate convocation
[4:09] I thought it was like our modern day
[4:11] graduation but I realized there's a
[4:14] different difference between a
[4:15] convocation and a graduation and we're
[4:18] in the season of graduations right now
[4:19] so I thought it was very significant to
[4:21] talk about uh graduations but there is a
[4:24] difference and I'm going to get to that
[4:25] in a little bit so we know the
[4:26] difference between a convocation that's
[4:28] the term God is using here and a
[4:30] graduation so it's graduations are
[4:33] pretty exciting and those that are
[4:35] graduating it's it's means that you
[4:37] finish something and there's
[4:38] celebrations for that and there's
[4:39] appreciations for it there's an event
[4:41] you attend the event and uh but but the
[4:44] convocation is something much much
[4:47] deeper has a deeper meaning than just
[4:49] the graduation and so this will be
[4:52] spilling over tonight a little bit from
[4:54] my theme that I had on Sunday and that
[4:57] is that we must be personally connected
[5:00] to what Calvary did for you
[5:03] every believer every young person every
[5:06] person must have a personal connection
[5:09] with what Calvary means to you and what
[5:12] he did for you at the cross
[5:14] lest it becomes a ritual lesson because
[5:16] of tradition and uh so we don't want
[5:19] that to happen so there must be a
[5:21] personal connection and there must be a
[5:23] feeling of it there must be that you
[5:25] feel what God has done for you and feel
[5:27] it personally to you and that there's a
[5:29] power that will come in your life
[5:31] because of the sacrifice of Calvary
[5:34] every believer every person needs to
[5:38] have a personal connection with that and
[5:40] so this will spill over into that theme
[5:42] tonight as we talk about those things
[5:43] now I just want to take a moment and a
[5:45] couple of these slides and bring back
[5:46] the seven feasts and this will be real
[5:48] basic so everybody even the child can
[5:50] understand it and I want to bring up
[5:52] that first slide and show you and this
[5:53] is I was borrowed this today from
[5:55] somebody because because then I didn't
[5:56] have to do the work of putting them all
[5:58] together so this is why I was talking
[5:59] about Sunday and you'll read it in
[6:01] Leviticus 23
[6:03] um you'll read all these feasts that's
[6:05] where you find it you want to read it on
[6:06] your own and these are the seven feasts
[6:08] that God set up for the children of
[6:09] Israel to come and to uh gather together
[6:13] and to sell and every one of these had a
[6:15] meaning to them I think a a few of these
[6:18] had the Lamb with it most of these had
[6:19] the land where they brought the
[6:20] sacrificial lamb for their sins and the
[6:22] priests would bring it in but these were
[6:24] the biblical he calls them biblical
[6:26] holidays and they have actually become
[6:28] that more and more the Jews still
[6:29] celebrate these things the true Jews and
[6:31] their holidays their time set aside just
[6:33] like our American holidays and so there
[6:35] is a meaning behind them and so the
[6:37] first four happened in the spring uh
[6:40] spring days in that season and the first
[6:42] one was the Passover and then the second
[6:45] one was the UN Feast of unleavened bread
[6:47] and the third one was the first fruits
[6:50] and then the fourth one was the Feast of
[6:52] Pentecost and every one of these had
[6:54] different some things similar they did
[6:56] when they come to Jerusalem and then
[6:58] sometimes they had different things they
[7:00] did in each one and if you study them
[7:02] and if you've got an open heart every
[7:04] one of them has a meaning every one of
[7:05] them has something significant and every
[7:07] one of them point to Christ and not just
[7:09] Christ it points to Christ in our own
[7:11] lives and so that's the first four and
[7:14] then there's a space of time there that
[7:16] goes to the fall and then the other
[7:19] three are picked up now to me that says
[7:21] to me that you have something happening
[7:23] early on that's a fulfillment and Christ
[7:25] fulfilled them and then you have a space
[7:27] and then at the end time this would be
[7:29] the end time this would be the last days
[7:31] and this fellow said historically these
[7:33] were fulfilled during Jesus first coming
[7:36] he's exactly right these four feasts
[7:39] were had the the spiritual fulfillment
[7:41] of them the Jews did the ritual the Jews
[7:44] did the actual uh a feast days but there
[7:48] was a fulfillment spiritually that
[7:50] happened in each of these where once the
[7:52] once the spiritual fulfillment was there
[7:54] happening once the true Passover Lamb
[7:57] was there once the true unleavened bread
[7:59] was there once the the resurrection took
[8:02] place took place face and once it was a
[8:04] Pentecost then you had the spiritual
[8:05] fulfillment you didn't go back and like
[8:07] the Jews are doing today because they
[8:09] don't see the Messiah they're still
[8:10] celebrating the old ritual but once the
[8:13] spiritual thing comes along then you
[8:15] don't go back to the ritual it's kind of
[8:17] like what happens in our lives and that
[8:19] is that once there's a new birth once
[8:21] there's a real New Birth it's not a
[8:23] ritual anymore it's not a duty anymore
[8:25] it's not a dress code anymore can you
[8:28] say Amen something has happened and
[8:30] Christ has become real to you and the
[8:32] message and the word and everything is
[8:34] of manifestation out of you it's not
[8:37] something you're trying to do on the
[8:39] outside I'm supposed to do this these
[8:41] probably people probably thought I got
[8:42] to get to that Jerusalem I'm supposed to
[8:44] do this this is a duty and so they've
[8:46] got the family together and got in their
[8:48] minivan three times a year whether they
[8:50] wanted to or not some years and they did
[8:52] it as a ritual but once the spiritual
[8:54] part took place then it was no longer a
[8:57] ritual it was an experience it was a
[9:00] reality can you say Amen so in the Old
[9:03] Testament they did that but Christ
[9:04] fulfilled all these and then all of a
[9:07] sudden because this speaks at the end
[9:08] time then he says to be fulfilled during
[9:10] the second coming of Christ and he's
[9:12] exactly right because now we go 2 000
[9:14] years in between the spot this was a
[9:16] year for the Jews so you figure the
[9:18] first three months there and you can
[9:19] look up what months they which dates
[9:21] they uh celebrated and then there's a
[9:24] space of time of about three months or
[9:26] four months then it picks up the Feast
[9:28] of trumpets Feast the Feast of atonement
[9:30] and the Feast of Tabernacles so it all
[9:32] speaks to these last three happening at
[9:34] the end time our ears should be perked
[9:37] up because we live in the end time we
[9:39] live in the last days and so we see then
[9:42] that these are the ones that become
[9:44] significant to us because these are
[9:47] already fulfilled now we still sing
[9:50] about Christ's death we still celebrate
[9:52] what he did at the cross we still
[9:54] celebrate the resurrection we we still
[9:57] celebrate that he's the bread the
[9:59] unleavened bread how many know Christ is
[10:01] those things and we celebrate the
[10:03] original Pentecost but but traditionally
[10:05] we don't want to keep looking back to
[10:07] that we've got to find the season that
[10:09] God is in right now because the same God
[10:11] that fulfilled those feasts right now is
[10:14] ready to fulfill these
[10:16] so once again the Bible says Seasons you
[10:19] have to be in the season there's a lot
[10:22] of Christianity that's still celebrating
[10:24] you know uh in in the in what was done
[10:27] 2000 years ago and they're still
[10:29] celebrating it but they don't realize
[10:30] the prophets being is being fulfilled
[10:32] right now and the same God that
[10:34] fulfilled those feasts now is ready to
[10:37] fulfill these and it is already
[10:38] spiritually fulfilling them I don't know
[10:40] what else to say except for as far as on
[10:42] this part it's just I wanted a visual
[10:44] for everybody to be able to see this is
[10:46] what they look like and this is the time
[10:48] span between the first four and the last
[10:50] three and these are these are fulfilled
[10:52] by Christ and I mentioned something
[10:53] Sunday that the the first three were
[10:57] fulfilled Christ fulfills all seven he's
[11:00] the Fulfillment of all the seven Feasts
[11:03] but he fulfills the first three in his
[11:06] in his body in other words Jesus of now
[11:08] he fulfills the first three but he
[11:11] fulfills the last four actually in the
[11:14] body of Christ his people
[11:18] and how do I know that we may still be
[11:21] looking at these here but I know that it
[11:23] was Christ coming on the day of
[11:25] Pentecost and it was him fulfilling the
[11:28] Feast of Pentecost but what body was he
[11:30] using 120 in the upper room being filled
[11:34] with the Holy Ghost so that day and
[11:36] incidentally if you read Acts chapter 2
[11:38] and verse 1 it says and when the day of
[11:41] Pentecost was fully come they're
[11:43] actually meeting on the day that the
[11:46] Jews were celebrating Pentecost the very
[11:49] day when the day of Pentecost was fully
[11:51] come they were in an upper room and they
[11:54] were praying in one Accord and God
[11:57] fulfilled the spiritual meaning of
[12:00] Pentecost on the very same day that
[12:02] others were going to the ritual
[12:04] God was fulfilling the Fulfillment he
[12:06] was doing it Christ but where was he
[12:08] doing it filling his people with the
[12:10] Holy Ghost
[12:11] you see here's another way that we know
[12:14] that is that
[12:15] he fulfilled this in his body because
[12:17] this is unleavened bread and unleavened
[12:20] bread is with leaven is sin so there was
[12:23] no sin in this bread
[12:25] okay that means it had to be that body
[12:29] of Christ because he's the only one
[12:30] without sin
[12:32] when we come to the Feast of Pentecost
[12:34] in that feast and the Jews they used
[12:37] leaven bread that means sin was in it
[12:41] that means it wasn't the body of Christ
[12:43] it was our body because he filled 120
[12:46] believers who were born in sin shaped in
[12:49] iniquity
[12:50] and he still saved them still filled him
[12:52] with the Holy Ghost and gave them the
[12:54] Conquering power over sin in their lives
[12:56] so that was lemon bread that's why I
[12:59] know that couldn't have been the actual
[13:01] Body of Christ it was the people of God
[13:03] fulfilling the day of Pentecost
[13:06] and every one of them back in those four
[13:08] happened on the very day that the ritual
[13:11] and the the the old
[13:14] holiday was being celebrated God was
[13:16] fulfilling it fulfilling it on the very
[13:18] day and I don't know if I'll get to this
[13:19] scripture but Jesus attended all these
[13:22] Jesus attended the Senate Fox
[13:24] Jesus went to church
[13:27] Jesus attended and he's he can't catch
[13:30] this now he's attending all of these
[13:33] feasts and he's there he's present and
[13:36] yet while he's walking in the door and
[13:38] walking into the temple and around and
[13:40] while he's doing all that he knows in
[13:43] his heart he's the Fulfillment
[13:47] he's the Fulfillment of this Feast
[13:49] praise God
[13:51] I'll be it tonight if we could catch a
[13:52] revelation that when we're coming to
[13:54] church we're not just coming to church
[13:57] that we're not here to hear a sermon but
[13:59] I want to be the actual fulfillment of
[14:01] what's being preached
[14:03] can you say amen I want to be what's
[14:05] being preached I want to live that out I
[14:08] want to be Christ so whatever Feast he's
[14:10] fulfilling whatever God's doing I want
[14:12] to be the manifestation of what God's
[14:13] doing I don't want Church to become a
[14:15] ritual I'm going to talk about that more
[14:16] here in a little bit so that's it I hope
[14:18] that's a good visual for you that's how
[14:19] you kind of see these broken down and
[14:22] I'm certainly not a teacher and with
[14:24] brother wrap around now on different
[14:25] teachers and brother Stevens truth
[14:27] sitting in the same audience here now uh
[14:30] I would be crazy to try to get into
[14:32] teaching with all them present but
[14:34] anyway this is my feeble effort I had to
[14:35] borrow this off the internet these guys
[14:37] probably developed their own but I had
[14:39] to borrow it just so that you have a
[14:41] visual and idea this is what we're
[14:42] talking about so if we go to the next
[14:44] one then I broke these down later to
[14:46] realize that Christ is the Fulfillment
[14:49] here's some scriptures that show that
[14:51] Purge out there for the old leaven that
[14:53] ye may be a new lump as ye are
[14:55] unleavened for even Christ Our Passover
[14:58] is sacrifice for us that's the scripture
[15:01] identifies he's the Fulfillment of of
[15:03] the Feast of Passover
[15:05] amen second one oh I can do this can I
[15:09] sister Genie or whoever's up there happy
[15:12] anniversary brother James and sister
[15:14] Jeannie today
[15:17] I see your hand up there
[15:19] [Applause]
[15:24] um
[15:24] it's good to have you sister from where
[15:26] are you from Austria nice to have you
[15:28] tonight God bless you
[15:30] so the Feast of unleavened bread is that
[15:32] did Christ fulfill that John 6 I am the
[15:34] living bread which came down from heaven
[15:36] If any man eat of this bread he shall
[15:38] live forever and the bread that I will
[15:40] give is my flesh which I will give for
[15:42] the life of the Lord let me raise you
[15:43] and say he's the Fulfillment of that
[15:46] Feast of unleavened bread
[15:48] amen if you don't if you read the Old
[15:50] Testament don't forget now and don't see
[15:53] Christ it's all Christ being revealed
[15:56] okay it goes from the ritual to the
[15:58] reality
[15:59] how about the Feast of first fruits
[16:01] First Corinthians 15 20 but now is
[16:04] Christ risen from the dead Feast of
[16:07] first fruits in the Old Testament means
[16:09] that they had to take whatever crop
[16:12] whatever come out of the ground first
[16:13] whatever was resurrected first they took
[16:16] the first fruits and they gave it as a
[16:17] tithe the first so Christ was the first
[16:19] one that come out of the Grave from the
[16:22] dead that's what it says so he's the
[16:23] Fulfillment of this Feast the first
[16:25] fruits but now is Christ risen from the
[16:27] dead and become the firstfruits of them
[16:29] that sled Christ is the Fulfillment of
[16:32] the Feast of first fruits on
[16:33] Resurrection Day He fulfilled that feast
[16:36] and we'll have a part in that when we
[16:38] resurrect someday
[16:40] the Feast of Pentecost Acts 2 and 1 4
[16:42] says and when the day of Pentecost was
[16:44] fully come they were all in one Accord
[16:46] in one place and suddenly there came a
[16:48] sound from Heaven as a rushing Mighty
[16:50] Wind and it filled all the house where
[16:52] they were sitting and they were all
[16:54] filled with the Holy Ghost and the Holy
[16:56] Ghost is Christ it's not the third
[16:58] person of the Trinity it's Christ Christ
[17:01] was fulfilling the Feast of Pentecost
[17:03] where in the people
[17:05] so the ritual was over with can you say
[17:08] amen and the reality had come to pass
[17:10] and they were there and Christ was
[17:12] fulfilling it through his people let's
[17:14] go on now to the fifth one remember
[17:16] there's two thousand years here there's
[17:18] many months in the year in between three
[17:20] or four months but there's a space and I
[17:22] give that 2 000 years of the church ages
[17:24] then when we come to the end time the
[17:26] Feast of trumpets Matthew 24 31 and he
[17:29] shall send his angels with a great sound
[17:31] of a trumpet and they shall gather
[17:33] together his elect from the Four Winds
[17:36] from one end of Heaven to the other now
[17:39] this is fulfilled every one of these are
[17:41] fulfilled had a fulfillment for the Jews
[17:44] who are God's people and he then he
[17:46] allowed the Gentiles a bride to come in
[17:48] so we have two sides of it going to be
[17:51] see the spiritual fulfillment and that's
[17:53] the Jews so most of the time brother
[17:55] Brown refers to the Feast of trumpets
[17:57] being attached to the Jews and that this
[17:59] Feast of trumpets will gather the people
[18:01] from the four corners of the earth that
[18:03] are his people that have been scattered
[18:05] because remember they were are pushed
[18:06] out of Jerusalem their Temple was
[18:07] destroyed so they ended up going over
[18:09] Generations around the world but God
[18:12] says I'll use my trumpets to gather the
[18:15] people back into their Homeland again
[18:16] for the purpose of bringing them to the
[18:20] the six feasts and that's what I spoke
[18:22] on Sunday the Feast of atonement so the
[18:25] purpose of gathering the people together
[18:27] is to bring them back into the whole
[18:29] Homeland so he can reveal himself
[18:31] someday to the Jews and they can realize
[18:33] oh we killed our Messiah oh we didn't
[18:36] know they'll mourn for days and they'll
[18:38] come back to what our atonement is not
[18:40] in the blood of bulls and goats but are
[18:43] we killed the atonement he was crucified
[18:45] for us and actually the two prophets
[18:47] that come to Israel will give them the
[18:49] revelation of all seven of these feasts
[18:52] and the elect will catch it and say my
[18:55] I've been worshiping under a ritual all
[18:57] these years I realize Christ is the
[18:59] Fulfillment to all these and they will
[19:01] begin to have a Revival again because
[19:04] they realize Christ is fulfilling
[19:06] thankfully the bride is already
[19:08] recognizing these things I'm preaching
[19:10] it to you tonight but one day the Jews
[19:12] are going to catch the same thing
[19:14] amen if brother or sister listen to this
[19:16] the Jew I know there's some even being
[19:18] baptized in
[19:19] in Israel with brother Colin he's
[19:21] baptized in several Jews that are coming
[19:23] in Catching catching their full
[19:25] revelation of the true Messiah it's
[19:28] wonderful it's wonderful
[19:30] so Christ is the Fulfillment of the
[19:33] Feast of trumpets and it's a gathering
[19:34] how is that fulfilled in us well where'd
[19:37] you come from
[19:39] a lot of different places
[19:42] you know you're out there in the world
[19:43] in a factory or in a a business office
[19:46] somewhere didn't have a clue you were a
[19:48] child of God and by some strange pulling
[19:52] and Gathering he gathers you not and
[19:56] remember for the Jews he gathered them
[19:57] from around the world and he used trials
[20:00] to do it
[20:01] he used Hitler to do it
[20:04] Hitler was a tool Hitler all these
[20:07] dictators was used as a tool because the
[20:10] trumpets trumpets denotes War the the
[20:12] wars were used to drive his people back
[20:16] could it be tonight that the wars in
[20:18] your life
[20:19] and I'll tell you if there's Wars in
[20:21] your life you better quit fighting you
[20:22] better let God fight him for you
[20:25] could it be that the wars could be used
[20:27] in the trials in our life could be used
[20:29] to drive us to the true atonement and
[20:32] bring us back to our homeland the word
[20:33] of God so where's the bride Gathering
[20:36] we're it's a spiritual Gathering Jesus
[20:38] said
[20:40] uh I'm trying to remember the scripture
[20:42] but I know the one I'm thinking of but
[20:44] the few scriptures before it says that
[20:47] they will come and somebody says where
[20:50] to Lord where are they going to gather
[20:51] where he says wherever the carcass is
[20:53] there will the Eagles be gathered
[20:55] together it's an end time scripture so
[20:57] this is our trumpets there's a gathering
[20:59] together I'm preaching the message of
[21:01] the hour tonight and I I want to believe
[21:02] that you're here
[21:04] because there's a lot of churches to go
[21:05] to but I'm preaching the message of the
[21:07] last days and there'll be something in
[21:09] your heart to say that's the preaching I
[21:10] want to hear I want to hear the message
[21:12] of the last days that says something
[21:14] about our hearts can you say Amen you've
[21:16] been gathered spiritually for a reason
[21:18] don't look at church don't look at
[21:21] church as you looked at it before but
[21:23] look at it as Jesus said wheresoever the
[21:26] carcass is which means the fresh word of
[21:28] God for the hour not some dead animal
[21:32] that's laid there for about
[21:34] three weeks
[21:36] and there's maggots and everything
[21:37] that's kind of what denominational
[21:39] Creeds produces old old word it's not
[21:42] fresh but a carcass it's just been
[21:44] killed you'll see the Eagles around it
[21:45] can you say Amen so you have been
[21:48] spiritually gathered from all over the
[21:50] place in different backgrounds that's
[21:52] why we all have to get along because
[21:53] Christ is innocent realize different
[21:55] backgrounds different opinions all these
[21:57] other things but there's a spiritual
[21:58] Gathering to the word
[22:01] that's the trumpet call in your life do
[22:03] you know that God the trumpet he he
[22:04] called you here
[22:06] I think you're here by yourself do you
[22:08] think no something called you something
[22:10] drew you God Drew you to gather you with
[22:13] God's people and around the word of God
[22:15] that's the only place that was true that
[22:17] where there's True Fellowship it's not a
[22:19] social Gathering it's not a uh
[22:23] it's not a club
[22:25] it's not a denomination it's a spiritual
[22:28] gathering around the word of God
[22:30] fresh word of God
[22:32] I'm taking all my time on this so Feast
[22:34] on Feast of the trumpets is fulfilled by
[22:37] Christ the Feast of atonement he gathers
[22:39] them together to the Feast of atonement
[22:41] and not only so but we also joy and God
[22:44] through Lord Jesus Christ by whom we all
[22:46] now have the atonement there's more to
[22:48] there's more scriptures to the atonement
[22:50] there's more scriptures to what the
[22:53] meaning of the atonement is because it
[22:54] doesn't necessarily mean that Christ has
[22:57] to die for our sins again he already did
[22:59] but it's coming to the full revelation
[23:01] of what the atonement is the Jews will
[23:03] come to that but the bride is coming to
[23:06] that now as I preach Sunday the true
[23:09] realization and revelation of what
[23:11] Christ did for me at Calvary and what
[23:13] that means to me in life in power in
[23:16] overcoming complexes and overcoming
[23:19] family habits inherent habits can you
[23:23] say Amen the power of Calvary will
[23:25] dissolve it all
[23:27] that's our atonement and if we're not
[23:29] living in our atonement we'll keep keep
[23:31] those habits we'll keep those little
[23:33] those flaws and those things that are
[23:35] there we'll hold on to them but the
[23:36] power of Calvary the atonement you got a
[23:38] revelation of it you're going to be
[23:40] released of all these things that you
[23:42] can't overcome yourself
[23:45] amen so a lot more scriptures to that
[23:48] but he is the Fulfillment of the Feast
[23:50] of atonement and that's happening that's
[23:52] you want to know the season for this
[23:53] this is happening right now because
[23:55] we've already been gathered
[23:57] we've already been our Feast of trumpet
[23:59] spiritually but now we're we're
[24:01] celebrating and we're worshiping under
[24:03] this Feast we're we're coming to church
[24:05] and we're in the word every day because
[24:07] Lord show me the power more and more of
[24:10] what you've done for me at Calvary and
[24:12] let me live in it in Victory
[24:15] forget this traditional idea that I'm
[24:18] just thinking about
[24:19] some you know some Christ of history let
[24:23] me live in the power and reality
[24:26] of what the cross has done for me that's
[24:28] why I preached on someone has died for
[24:30] me someone died for me because when you
[24:32] realize you're connected to that it
[24:34] brings Victory today
[24:36] every day is a victory for us when we
[24:37] live in that victory of Calvary and then
[24:39] the last one is the Feast of Tabernacles
[24:41] which is a great study
[24:42] second Corinthians 5 1 4 we know that if
[24:45] our Earthly House of this Tabernacle
[24:47] were dissolved we have a building of God
[24:49] a house not made with hands
[24:52] Eternal in the heavens
[24:53] so this is the final Revelation that we
[24:56] will dwell if you go in the Book of
[24:57] Revelations God shall Tabernacle himself
[25:00] with his people that's the final Feast
[25:02] of Tabernacles is that he'll put us back
[25:04] in a millennium and God will his
[25:07] Tabernacle is with men and in men can
[25:10] you say Amen but right now we're
[25:12] catching the Revelation hearing from our
[25:14] theophonies that we have an eternal body
[25:17] just in the next Dimension that we will
[25:19] ghost to someday it's a tabernacle not
[25:22] made with hands it's a tabernacle it's
[25:24] another body can you say Amen that
[25:26] Christ has given us it's a part of
[25:28] Christ and we will go to that you talk
[25:30] about celebrating the Feast of
[25:31] Tabernacles we're awful close to a
[25:34] Rapture when we go into another body
[25:36] so you can see by this these things that
[25:39] he fulfills them all now I wanted to go
[25:42] into a couple things before I go to this
[25:45] if you're still
[25:47] here
[25:53] so let me just get to these points out
[25:54] let's just skip skip to the skip to the
[25:58] uh Leviticus 23 1 our text
[26:02] it says there that it says and the Lord
[26:05] speaking to Moses saying Speak unto the
[26:06] children of Israel and say unto them
[26:08] concerning the Feast of the Lord which
[26:10] ye shall Proclaim to be holy
[26:12] convocations even these are my feast
[26:16] so
[26:17] um
[26:18] convocation in the scriptural meaning
[26:22] means and I want you to catch this point
[26:24] tonight
[26:25] it's a me a convocation is a meeting of
[26:28] a religious character as distinguished
[26:31] from congregation which was more General
[26:34] so when he says These Are Holy
[26:37] convocations and that's what I'm
[26:38] preaching unto a holy convocation this
[26:41] is different when they gathered as the
[26:43] general assembly to synagogue and they
[26:45] gathered they had Gatherings throughout
[26:47] the year every week they'd gather
[26:48] together at Sabbath and they had other
[26:50] Gatherings but this God wants you to
[26:52] know this holy convocation is not just
[26:55] another gathering this isn't just church
[26:57] as usual every week
[26:59] this is a holy convocation so I like
[27:03] when it's worded a meeting of religious
[27:05] character as distinguished from
[27:08] congregation because when you have just
[27:09] a meeting with the congregation it could
[27:12] be very surface it could be just very
[27:13] general we do that on a weekly basis
[27:16] sometimes by sometimes twice a week but
[27:19] but when let me just say it this way
[27:21] when God speaks of a holy convocation
[27:24] it's not church as usual it's a personal
[27:27] connection with you
[27:29] that's a holy convocation
[27:32] and in other words this convocation was
[27:36] more important than just the general
[27:37] meetings of his people they had more
[27:40] meaning to it a religious character in
[27:42] other words character was involved I
[27:44] would say that this way is that you can
[27:46] come and attend a congregation and be
[27:48] around the social part of it and develop
[27:50] friendships or not develop friendships
[27:52] whatever you want to do you can enjoy
[27:54] the benefits of all that that's
[27:55] wonderful but I can tell you God wants
[27:58] to have a holy convocation with you
[28:00] personally
[28:02] and if that doesn't happen all the
[28:04] congregational Gatherings will do you no
[28:05] good
[28:07] so when he speaks of this it's more
[28:09] important than just a general meeting
[28:11] it's more important that you just make
[28:13] it to all the camps for the summer you
[28:15] should go to camps Jesus attended
[28:16] there's a scripture that says that as is
[28:19] custom one he was he went in the
[28:21] synagogue he attended these things but
[28:23] it wasn't just attending a ritual to him
[28:25] it wasn't just synagogue to him the word
[28:28] was becoming alive he was the word and
[28:30] it was being manifested in his life it
[28:32] doesn't matter that you make it to all
[28:34] the camps this summer if you're gonna go
[28:36] go because Jesus went but you ought to
[28:38] be saying Lord let that can't be a holy
[28:40] convocation for my life
[28:42] praise the Lord they add more meaning to
[28:45] them a holy convocation and I want to
[28:47] say there's a regular meeting of people
[28:49] of God that has happened almost every
[28:51] week for centuries do you realize that
[28:52] they met on the first day of week the
[28:54] early Christians met on the first day to
[28:56] celebrate the Celebration Church on
[28:58] Sundays has been going on for centuries
[29:00] now
[29:01] there's a general meeting of the people
[29:03] of God but then but then there are
[29:06] significant
[29:08] movements or connections God makes with
[29:12] his people that are above the regular
[29:16] I could stop and give testimonies to
[29:18] that myself
[29:20] I've been going to church twice a week
[29:22] all my life
[29:24] but then there's those significant
[29:25] moments that I'll call Holy convocations
[29:28] in my life
[29:30] and I love those I love going to church
[29:32] but I like it when God makes contact
[29:35] with me
[29:36] and I walk out of there it doesn't
[29:38] matter about everybody else I know I've
[29:39] met with God personally today this has
[29:42] been a holy convocation with just me
[29:44] nobody else may get it I don't know but
[29:46] young person you need a holy convocation
[29:48] with God you don't need to just go to a
[29:50] camp but you need something deeper in
[29:52] your life
[29:54] and so these were movements or
[29:56] connections God made with his people
[29:57] above the regular they are spoke of in
[29:59] the Bible these holy complications they
[30:02] are crucial that we catch them and
[30:03] gather around these things spiritually
[30:05] you can come to church and read your
[30:07] Bible your whole life and still not be
[30:10] connecting with Christ or what he is
[30:12] doing now so these were so important and
[30:15] they've become even more important after
[30:17] Jesus comes because he comes to bring
[30:19] the spiritual fulfillment of every one
[30:21] of these feasts as I said Israel did
[30:24] them as a law and they acted out these
[30:26] gatherings every year even the seven
[30:28] feasts become a ritual to them but he
[30:31] didn't intend for that to happen he said
[30:33] I want you to be sober about this I want
[30:35] you to come together and when you come
[30:37] three times a year to Jerusalem I wanted
[30:39] to be a holy convocation I want you to
[30:41] know the meaning of what you're doing
[30:43] and I want you I want to connect with
[30:45] you
[30:46] I don't want it to be church as usual
[30:51] so I'm bringing this back up what is the
[30:53] difference in a graduation and a
[30:55] convocation then graduation is a term
[30:57] used to acknowledge that you have met
[30:59] your requirements and you have been
[31:01] approved to graduate from the program
[31:04] that's graduation that's a lot of that's
[31:06] going on right now
[31:07] convocation refers to the ceremony it's
[31:10] a different ceremony and incidentally
[31:12] getting here tonight he had two
[31:13] ceremonies he had one for the graduation
[31:15] and one for the convocation there's two
[31:17] of them Solomon had his together
[31:19] but it was it was too and it's the
[31:22] convocation
[31:24] refers to the ceremony where your
[31:27] credential will be conferred
[31:31] and confirm means you are granted or
[31:34] you're bestowed a title a degree a
[31:38] benefit or a right
[31:41] now I'm going to preach
[31:43] because you can go to graduations all
[31:46] day long
[31:47] and if you don't have you haven't been
[31:49] conferred the rights of what that degree
[31:52] is giving you
[31:53] you ain't got everything yet
[31:55] this holy convocation is something
[31:57] deeper than a graduation is something
[32:00] deeper than just coming and celebrating
[32:01] can you say Amen but it's something that
[32:04] it says it grants you it's the
[32:06] convocation refers to ceremony where the
[32:08] credential will be conferred to you the
[32:10] rights everything will come over to you
[32:12] so it's pretty exciting sometimes to
[32:14] come to the event I was very excited in
[32:16] December to go to both my son's
[32:17] graduations they're here tonight and it
[32:19] was very exciting for me because you
[32:21] know I've said to you that you know
[32:22] school is a more difficult thing
[32:25] sometimes for some of us levontans and
[32:27] so to see them finish four-year degrees
[32:29] I thought it was wonderful and and then
[32:32] and then so it was nice and exciting and
[32:34] I was going to show you a couple
[32:35] pictures I grad grabbed son you can turn
[32:37] that back on because I was just going to
[32:38] show a couple pictures because I'm very
[32:40] proud of these and this is the Gathering
[32:42] at the pear style for Gideon's
[32:45] graduation and his Gathering there and
[32:47] actually this was the time that they
[32:49] actually this I don't know if this was
[32:51] the conferring but this is the Gathering
[32:52] of all the people and they had it at the
[32:54] pier style there around Christmas time
[32:55] as you can see this is a very special
[32:57] evening everybody's there all the
[32:59] graduates come across the platform
[33:01] that was a special evening for me that
[33:03] was the Gathering and then we had
[33:05] Solomon there he is on the platform and
[33:07] he went across at UT this is a very
[33:10] special evening for him to go across
[33:12] there and receive his degree this is the
[33:14] graduation ceremony and then of course
[33:16] uh but I just wanted to say he receives
[33:19] that he he has the whole you know Pomp
[33:23] and Circumstance and all those other
[33:25] things but none of that really means
[33:27] anything until you have the paper
[33:32] until something is said and they said
[33:34] here in these ceremonies you have to
[33:36] actually say something the wording has
[33:38] to be and some of them it's you have to
[33:40] say it's it is a common language in
[33:43] graduation ceremonies at least in the
[33:45] United States to hear a degree conferred
[33:47] with these words all the rights and
[33:51] privileges pertaining thereto
[33:56] so this is different when it's the
[33:57] conferring it means they say on the
[34:00] paper and verbally he has met the
[34:03] requirements and now from this moment
[34:05] forward he has all the rights and
[34:07] privileges that go and awards that go
[34:10] with that degree
[34:12] oh I'm starting to feel like preaching
[34:13] now
[34:14] I'm starting to think of that book was
[34:16] sealed with Seven Seals I'm starting to
[34:18] think of that barrier that we were
[34:20] Believers we were saved by Calvary but
[34:22] there was still a breach there was still
[34:23] there was a barrier and there had to be
[34:25] a breach a break to get through those
[34:26] seals taken off and when he took him off
[34:28] in the last days he said he hath made us
[34:32] Kings and Priests
[34:35] oh I'm going to read a quote to you in
[34:37] the morning we have a great graduation
[34:39] ceremony but I'm going to read a quote
[34:41] to you that I read this morning and that
[34:43] is to say that that he our Kinsmen
[34:45] Redeemer stood up to claim rights his
[34:49] rights and then he says but it's rights
[34:51] for his own children
[34:54] amen let me finish this a minute so this
[34:56] is this is a nice time but it's nothing
[34:58] like when you actually receive
[35:02] the paper
[35:03] and prepared to paid for all this it's
[35:05] really exciting
[35:07] I didn't pay for all of it Solomon paid
[35:09] for some of it but this is a proud time
[35:12] and this was a proud time I'm not I'm
[35:14] not boasting tonight but I kind of am
[35:18] I mean I got these pictures up and it's
[35:20] just Wednesday nights just us I thought
[35:21] I'd put these up so this but you know
[35:24] the graduation everybody's there but
[35:26] this is different this is this is
[35:28] special this is the paper in your hand
[35:30] that means they have all the rights all
[35:33] the things that goes with it it's in
[35:35] their hand can you say Amen praise be to
[35:37] God
[35:38] oh wait a minute I shouldn't put that
[35:40] one in there
[35:42] how did that make it in I was going to
[35:44] keep those personal with me
[35:51] that should have stuck with me
[35:54] turn that off
[36:00] it has to have that wording all the
[36:02] rights and privileges pertaining thereto
[36:06] brother Brown said in this quote
[36:08] this last quote and then we're going to
[36:10] close
[36:12] about our kinserman now he is not an
[36:14] animal he took the book out of the right
[36:16] hand of him that sat upon the throne who
[36:19] was it the owner the original owner the
[36:21] title deed to this earth
[36:25] when Adam fell
[36:26] the title deed fell back into the hands
[36:29] of the original owner because Satan's
[36:31] hands were too dirty for it he wanted it
[36:34] but see that didn't belong
[36:36] the rights of this Earth didn't belong
[36:39] to Satan it belonged to Adam and Eve it
[36:42] belongs to Sons and Daughters of God
[36:45] but when man fell he lost the the rights
[36:48] to it and so it didn't go back in
[36:50] Satan's hand it went back into the hands
[36:52] of the original owner then you get to
[36:54] Revelations 5 and there's a change our
[36:56] lamb that went to Calvary 2000 years
[36:57] later now steps forth into the vision of
[37:00] John and he steps forth the owner the
[37:03] original owner that had the book of
[37:04] redemption in his right hand and no
[37:06] angel nor Angelic being nothing else
[37:08] could take
[37:09] the place to take that book no one's
[37:12] worthy to take that book back
[37:14] and this bloody lamb walked out and took
[37:16] the book out of his hand
[37:18] what was it brother this is the most
[37:20] Sublime thing in the scripture an act
[37:23] that not an angel not nothing could do
[37:25] it and the lamb come and took it from
[37:28] the right hand of him that sat upon the
[37:30] throne
[37:33] and what is it now it belongs to the
[37:35] lamb amen that and that in itself should
[37:38] make us
[37:39] say oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[37:41] the title deed is back in the hands of
[37:44] my kingdom Redeemer
[37:45] it happened but he didn't keep it for
[37:47] himself God's law is required he's the
[37:50] one that holds it God's law required of
[37:51] kinsman redeemer and the lamb come out
[37:53] holding it look and he says I am their
[37:56] Kinsmen I am their redeemer I now I have
[38:00] made intercession for them for two
[38:01] thousand years he made a session only
[38:03] knows that's the scripture
[38:05] he was a high priest and he was making
[38:07] an intercession can you say Amen so he
[38:10] was the high priest of our confession
[38:11] for two thousand years I am the Redeemer
[38:13] I made intercession for them and now
[38:16] I've come to claim their rights for them
[38:19] amen there's all there's the only one so
[38:22] what did he come to do earlier on in the
[38:24] few paragraphs earlier he says he
[38:28] claimed come to claim his rights now
[38:31] later on he says I have come to claim
[38:33] their rights for them amen there's the
[38:36] only one
[38:39] I've come to claim their rights in that
[38:42] they have a right to everything that
[38:45] lost in the fall and I've paid the price
[38:49] in Revelations 5 that's what our lamb
[38:52] says to the devil I'm here to claim the
[38:56] rights for my children I'm holding this
[38:58] title deed and he actually says the
[39:00] prophet says he took it and he threw it
[39:02] to his Prophet down on Earth and then
[39:04] then spoke those things to the Bride of
[39:07] Jesus Christ that's why Revelations 10
[39:09] 10 7 does not end with seven verses I've
[39:11] been saying this Revelations 10 if it
[39:13] ended at verse 7 that means it's the
[39:15] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[39:17] it's all about the seventh angel no the
[39:19] seventh angel was on the earth at the
[39:21] time of this coming of the Lamb with the
[39:23] book open
[39:25] the seventh angel was on the earth
[39:27] because he was the one that was on the
[39:28] earth at the time of this coming then he
[39:31] threw that up to his Prophet to speak on
[39:33] Earth but it doesn't end with
[39:35] Revelations 10 7 it has four more verses
[39:38] and that is that then he says take the
[39:41] book bride John take the book and eat it
[39:45] can you say Amen through it to his
[39:47] Prophet on Earth but it didn't stay with
[39:49] his Prophet it's to get back into the
[39:51] hands of sons and daughters to God till
[39:54] they can start saying Satan I've got my
[39:56] rights back
[39:58] everything that I lost in the garden you
[40:01] may feel defeated tonight but you can
[40:03] say because of our lamb everything that
[40:06] Adam lost I've got back to me tonight
[40:08] I've got it back in my possession
[40:10] you talk about Authority it's been
[40:13] conferred
[40:14] can you say it's not just a graduation
[40:15] when we come to church it's not just
[40:17] you've graduated from a similar simmer
[40:19] you've graduated from a center
[40:22] to a Christian
[40:23] it's so much more than that well that's
[40:25] what I did Brother Paul yes praise the
[40:27] Lord but it's not just that you get a
[40:30] graduation and you went from a sinner to
[40:32] a Believer no you have rights that
[40:34] Calvary bought for you
[40:36] you've got a power to overcome habits in
[40:38] your life you got a power to overcome
[40:40] complexes in your life you've got a
[40:42] power to overcome gossip in your life
[40:44] you got a power to overcome habits that
[40:46] you couldn't break before you got a
[40:48] power to come in as Kings and Priests
[40:49] what's this Kings and Priests he after
[40:51] he opened the seals thou has made us
[40:53] Kings and Priests you may not feel like
[40:56] that tonight but this is what the word
[40:57] is making us Kings and Priests and you
[40:59] know what that means dominion and access
[41:02] to God
[41:04] I have dominion because I'm a king and I
[41:08] have access to God because I'm a priest
[41:11] yeah you want to come and have me pray
[41:14] you should believe that faith not in
[41:16] yourself you say if someone comes and
[41:17] prays ask for prayer to you
[41:19] you should say yum
[41:22] my lamb has made me a priest
[41:24] I have access to God and hopefully
[41:27] you're available and you haven't got a
[41:28] bunch of stuff in your life you've got
[41:30] to get under the blood and repent keep
[41:32] it keep clean say forgive me in my sins
[41:34] let me be available because I've got
[41:37] power here to bring a prayer to God this
[41:39] person can be healed of cancer you don't
[41:41] have to bring them to the pastor you can
[41:42] lay hands on them
[41:43] this this boy I refer to my son but it
[41:46] happens all the time I wonder sometimes
[41:48] if this is the third poll already
[41:50] happened you look for a manifestation is
[41:52] that you never hear some testimonies
[41:53] where he lays hands on the woman that's
[41:55] out for how many how many minutes uh the
[41:58] other day lay hands she's gone she's
[41:59] what do they call that
[42:03] flat line
[42:05] before they can get to her before they
[42:06] came in and get to her he lays hands on
[42:08] her she takes her breath and comes back
[42:10] they're going what happened what
[42:11] happened so now everybody okay well that
[42:13] just you see to me the third pole is
[42:16] beginning to work more and more in his
[42:18] people now I'm looking for something
[42:19] deeper than just Supernatural I'm
[42:22] looking for adoption maturity in the
[42:25] people of God and first with me
[42:28] because I got a lot of immaturities that
[42:30] God needs to burn out
[42:31] part of the third poll is that there
[42:33] will be a quiet secret work of little
[42:36] things that happen you know why it's
[42:37] happening because this word has made us
[42:40] Kings and Priests
[42:42] so you don't wait for the pastor to pray
[42:44] you have power in your prayer and
[42:46] Authority I'm going to lay my hands on
[42:48] this person
[42:50] I'm a sister here and I I'll go visit
[42:52] this person's house man but I'll tell
[42:53] them the pastor will pray though that's
[42:55] fine
[42:56] but guess what when you lay your hands
[42:58] on them in the name of Jesus
[43:00] you have access to God priests have
[43:03] access to God
[43:04] the whole world doesn't have that
[43:07] but you have dominion and you have
[43:09] access to God know how I love brother
[43:11] Brown getting excited about that
[43:13] don't that make you feel religious
[43:15] inside congregation says congregation
[43:17] says amen not by Good Works which we
[43:21] have done but by his Mercy I've come to
[43:25] claim their rights
[43:27] and they have a right to everything that
[43:31] lost in the fall
[43:33] I've paid the price
[43:40] Hallelujah
[43:44] blessed be the name of the Lord
[43:46] convocations is something deeper it's
[43:49] personal it's not just a gathering just
[43:52] a last note Jesus attended the regular
[43:54] meetings like you do and I appreciate
[43:56] that
[43:57] but then he was experiencing the reality
[44:00] in his heart while he was attending
[44:02] these things Luke 4 16 I'm closing and
[44:05] he came to Nazareth where he had been
[44:08] brought up and his as his custom was he
[44:10] went into the synagogue on the Sabbath
[44:13] day and stood up for it to read
[44:15] Jesus could have the attitude
[44:18] kind of like the children of Israel when
[44:22] it was time to go to another Feast they
[44:24] had to come during the season of that
[44:25] particular feast and worship under that
[44:28] they could have the attitude well I
[44:30] don't feel like going to the Feast of
[44:32] Tabernacles this year
[44:34] I think I'll I think I'll wait it out
[44:36] and wait till next spring
[44:39] couldn't do that to come and worship
[44:41] under the season and Christ could have
[44:43] said well I'm not going to attend these
[44:45] things because I'm the spiritual
[44:47] fulfillment there are people like that I
[44:49] don't need
[44:54] I got my Bible and I've got my
[44:57] and so I really don't need to be
[44:58] obedient to the word in these other
[45:00] things I told a young man one day I said
[45:03] you know I said the difference in me and
[45:04] you brother I said
[45:07] we're both Believers we'll both believe
[45:09] the message the last days
[45:12] we're both going to make a rapture
[45:14] because I believe that I don't have any
[45:15] right to put anybody out
[45:17] I said but the difference to you and me
[45:19] is that I need the faithful Ministry
[45:22] you don't need them
[45:26] but he knew it was the truth he don't
[45:28] need them
[45:29] I said I need the body of Christ because
[45:32] that's where Christ is in his body you
[45:34] don't need them
[45:37] couldn't say nothing
[45:39] I said I don't know how you get around
[45:41] those scriptures but listen I don't go
[45:44] for the people I don't go for there's a
[45:46] move of God happening in the Holy Ghost
[45:48] in the people of God for the last days
[45:50] if you don't realize that the bride is
[45:53] the final voice to the final age and
[45:56] this Christ that you believe is not some
[45:58] form that's up in the air somewhere it's
[46:01] living in his people
[46:03] and if you don't believe that's the
[46:05] final voice of the final age you don't
[46:06] know your Bible
[46:07] because it's the spirit and the bride
[46:10] at the Lazarus that say come
[46:13] where is he at he's not in his Corporal
[46:15] body he's not just in the preachers he's
[46:17] not the the pope is going to be the
[46:20] Incarnate Antichrist someday they're
[46:22] going to say it's Christ they still say
[46:24] now he's the biker of Christ but now
[46:25] he'll become the Incarnate Antichrist
[46:28] someday but where is Christ embodied if
[46:31] you know your Bible he's embodied in his
[46:34] people
[46:36] that's the final work of God
[46:39] and you may understand Bible prophecy
[46:41] and all events and these other things
[46:43] but how about this event how about this
[46:45] event Christ
[46:48] manifesting in his people
[46:50] so I I respectfully said that's a bit of
[46:53] difference I don't know how you get
[46:54] around those those things that say that
[46:56] in the last days this is the final work
[46:58] of the Lord what he's going to manifest
[47:00] through his people me you all the people
[47:03] of God and so to end this we gather
[47:06] together for church and for fellowship
[47:09] and for church time but there are some
[47:13] Divine appointments and holy
[47:15] convocations that God has for your life
[47:19] and we need both
[47:22] we need to attend
[47:26] can you say Amen Jesus as his custom
[47:29] Jesus had some good Customs he went to
[47:31] church
[47:33] it's okay to have good customs
[47:36] we need both we need to attend and B
[47:39] where the word is being preached but we
[47:41] also need some holy convocations with
[47:44] God we need those sacred times when God
[47:49] meets us personally and gives us
[47:50] Revelation and we see Christ in us
[47:54] living himself out that's not church as
[47:58] usual can you say man that's not just
[48:00] another synagogue Gathering that is the
[48:04] holy convocations worshiping under these
[48:07] feasts worshiping under where we're at
[48:09] right now is what God is calling every
[48:11] Prime member to in this hour it's a
[48:14] personal walk with the Lord every day
[48:20] and and let me say something about the
[48:23] times we live in do you think the age we
[48:25] live in in 2023 contributes to a
[48:29] a walk with God that's on fire
[48:34] I know
[48:36] do you think the access to our phones
[48:38] and into entertainments and gossip on
[48:40] social media do you think any of that
[48:42] contributes
[48:44] to the secret place that God's calling
[48:46] to us to none of it everything's against
[48:49] it
[48:50] everything is against that
[48:53] meeting of a holy convocation with you
[48:56] and God everything in our society is
[48:59] against it
[49:01] it's almost discouraging where you
[49:03] almost get discouraged even to keep
[49:04] preaching it but I'm not going to quit
[49:05] preaching it I'm not going to quit
[49:07] striving can you say man I want to rise
[49:09] to the occasions I won't be a little sin
[49:11] I don't lukewarm I won't be able to see
[49:14] it because you know what at the end of
[49:17] all the laodice and Luke Mormons you're
[49:19] rich and increased good and have need of
[49:21] nothing but I say the Holy Ghost says
[49:23] you're poor blind naked that's the state
[49:25] of the church
[49:26] it looks pretty miserable
[49:28] but at the end it just has those little
[49:31] things a little statement to him that
[49:35] overcome it
[49:38] because it says that I see my name right
[49:41] there I won't be lukewarm I won't be
[49:44] average I'm going to pray I'm going to
[49:47] keep praying I'm going to keep fighting
[49:49] I'm going to keep saying Lord I want
[49:51] holy convocations with you I want to
[49:54] meet with you I want to know you I want
[49:55] to know you every day
[49:57] that's what the message really produces
[49:59] can you say man that's what the message
[50:01] should produce adopted Sons and
[50:03] Daughters of God that are not just
[50:04] religion people that are just want to
[50:06] come and have a religion they have a
[50:09] personal walk with God and they're
[50:10] growing into adoption and they're
[50:12] getting their rights they're saying
[50:13] Satan wait a minute you can push so far
[50:16] but I got some rights here my kingdom
[50:18] gave me my rights back and I've got
[50:21] every right that was that Adam lost in
[50:23] the the garden I've got every one of
[50:24] those rights I don't want to remind
[50:25] Satan tonight every believer has
[50:28] everything that was lost in the garden
[50:30] has everything restored back to them we
[50:32] have access can you say Amen
[50:34] I got some right Satan and you can't
[50:37] take them away from me

[50:44] this I'm not perfect by any means except
[50:47] through the blood of Jesus Christ

[50:51] Wednesday night with you so tired so
[50:55] wore out from working and raising kids
[50:58] and to wore out from retirement that's
[51:01] even that even wears you out

[51:06] online and we love the word of God can
[51:09] you say Amen somebody said I don't come
[51:11] because I'm tired on Wednesday nights

[51:16] the rest of us are tired it's only you I
[51:18] said we're all tired but we're out but
[51:21] you know what
[51:23] I believe that we got something greater
[51:26] than ourselves greater than our tired
[51:27] bodies that we can say Amen to and say
[51:30] Lord that's the image that was preached
[51:32] to me tonight I don't want just the
[51:34] Gathering I don't want just a synagogue

[51:57] because I want to personally have a holy
[52:00] convocation with you that's why I'm
[52:02] going to that camp and if you have that

[53:12] the people of God help us to stand
[53:14] flat-footed against the enemy Lord when
[53:17] he tries to abuse us and tries to twist
[53:19] our minds and tries to create a world
[53:21] some something for us to live in that's
[53:23] in defeat we're not called

[53:43] touch God for people's lives and to live
[53:46] in Dominion where things aren't
[53:47] controlling me but I'm controlling
[53:49] things with the power of God it's
[53:52] exercising dominion over the enemy
[53:54] that's what Adam lost when he lost his
[53:56] authority and power then Satan would
[53:58] just kept knocking him around and man
[54:00] fell and fell and kept getting worse
[54:02] until today he's become Beast Lord
[54:04] without you but father you have given us

[54:09] be beasts we're to be Sons and Daughters

[54:36] the season we're in and may we recognize
