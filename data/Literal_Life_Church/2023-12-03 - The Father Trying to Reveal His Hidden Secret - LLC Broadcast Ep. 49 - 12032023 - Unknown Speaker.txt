know one I know I will press all your truth is word I follow and it'll still be true tomorrow what I believe was not the work of me his kingdom can be shaken on this glorious Foundation While others fall here I stand on Christ the Rock I stand all of the ground is seeking stand all others others others others fall While others Love is Here I Stand Here I Stand your truth is word I follow it'll still be true tomorrow what I believe was not the work of any his kingdom can't be shaken this glorious Foundation While others fall here I stand While others here I stand Luke 10 and verse 21 in that hour Jesus rejoiced in his spirit I like reading that praise the Lord there's there's another place that Jesus was troubled in his Spirit the night he was with Judas so Jesus had a spirit and it kind of sometimes was affected his Soul wasn't affected but his Spirit was affected he was troubled in his Spirit but here I want you to notice Jesus was rejoicing in his spirit makes you curious to know what he was rejoicing about in that hour Jesus rejoiced in his spirit and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou has hid these things from the wise and The Prudent and Hast revealed them unto babes even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight so it makes the it made Christ rejoice and this is something that triggers and moves the heart of God and that is when he can reveal himself not through intellect but by Revelation and he can show his elect the hidden things Mark 4:10 and when he was alone they that were about him with the 12 ask him of him the parable because he had just given a parable when he was alone with his disciples they asked him about the parable and he said unto them unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God but unto them that are without all these things are done in Parables now notice the way he's saying it now is that is that there will be ones who catch the mystery the secret there will be ones who are called to catch the father's hidden Mystery of it and there will be ones that are called just to take the par Parable and see the parable and I don't know how all that fits as far as who's in what category I'm not I'm not allowed to put people in categories but there's a truth laying here that the mystery the secret he says it's given to the elect to know the secret the mystery singular mystery there and so he he says it that way in verse 10 um excuse me verse chapter 4 and verse 10 and so he says it's unto you is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God but unto them that are without all these things are done in Parables that seeing they may see and not perceive and hearing they may hear and not understand lest at any time they should be converted and their sins should be forgiven them and it's the mystery of the Kingdom that's given to the elect it's the singular Mysteries I'm going to pull out a few words here that I'll be speaking on but he says it's given to you to know the mystery now we would think the Mysteries plural in other words there's Mysteries of the kingdom of God there's principles of the kingdom of God and uh and we know that Jesus had many things to say about the kingdom children and how they live uh examples are when he when he brought The Parables and The Parables Express revelation of the last days The Parables Express how to live in The Parables is written something but it has to do sometimes of how the children live and then you have the Sermon on the Mount which to me is preaching to the people principles of the Kingdom how the children of the Kingdom live you know what he talks about swimming on the mount uh turn the other cheek you know someone hits you turn the other cheek to them if if uh uh if he talks about lust and he talks about loving your enemies and he says be ye there per for perfect as your father's Heaven is perfect be the CH the children of the Kingdom so in all of those things there's numerous mysteries about how the kingdom children live and how they the principles they live by and they're opposite of the what the world teaches you how many know that Kingdom principles in finances in living in marriage every subject will be different than the wisdom of the world and so we cannot take our cues from the wisdom of the world but Kingdom children how many raise your hand and say I'm a kingdom child of God and I'm interested in the things of the Kingdom so so we live different and Jesus taught us we live different so I want you to know this it's not that we don't have Mysteries plural and principles plural of the kingdom of God but when he says it's given unto you know he says it's given to you know the singular the mystery so all of those things of living the principles of the Kingdom actually come back to one mystery that God is trying to get to you that's why to me the gospel is not complicated that's why the message is not complicated to me because when people become overwhelmed said I got to do this and I got to do that and I got to do this and they they make it all this overwhelming thing I want to tell you tonight the father is actually trying to only get one main thing to you the father has been trying to get one secret one mystery to you and when that comes to you when the father gets it to you then you have something that just opens it all up and now the kingdom you're living in the kingdom and the kingdom principles and the Mysteries everything be begins to open from there but if we go backwards and try to live just Kingdom principles and we block the father from getting the one main secret that we need the one mystery that we need then we're missing something huge because it's really one I know this is going to be strange to say this but there's because we we think God has so many things to show us and he has so many preachers and brother brother Paul has so many preachers coming in and there's so much that God wants us to no that's true but I want to tell you tonight God actually is trying to get you one main mystery and it's given for you to know it that's right amen does that just help you settle down a little bit and feel more peaceful but he he's but he's trying to get a a hidden Mystery to you and uh so uh there's multiple teachings and the message that God sent in the last days has multiple things of of how a Believer lives never has there been a message to our generation that's so specific H and there's so much of it there and yet here it's worded he's it's given to you to know the mystery singular of the Kingdom so really there's one main secret he's trying to get to you he's trying to bring the thoughts of it behind the mighty acts of God he's trying to bring the thought of God to you he's trying to bring his thoughts and brother strw was on that that brother Steven Sunday and what wonderful message we had what a a thing to cause us to deep to think more deeply than we should because he mentioned one statement this is the way he said it he said the thought the thought is the father of the word he said the attribute and I just I went back and listen to Just the part I had written it on my notes but this the way brother Steven said it the attribute of God that was in God before the foundation the attribute you an attribute gives rise to a thought the thought is the father of the word then it's a word so it's attribute it's thought it's word the thought is the father of the word we look in the scripture and say the Father the father and we get in our minds you know some some visible thing but Jesus says Jesus says you can't see the father so don't get into this say father and then Solomon come up here it's a father and son and two separate persons you can't look at it that way I love it when he says that the Revelation because the thought is the father of the word Jesus said no man has seen the father but the son expresses him and the son is the word so the son expresses the father in every generation the son is the word expressed Jesus Christ and the father is the thought of the word and so he says the attribute gives R rise to a thought thank you brother Stephen I know you're listening tonight God bless you the the attribute gives right rise to the thought the thought is the father of the word then it's a word the spoken word then becomes manifested and the manifestation is the image of the Heavenly amen that's powerful and I like how he said it it loses nothing in the process right glory be to God from the attribute to it passes down to it gets to the Manifest manifested thought to the the expressing the image of the Heavenly nothing is lost in the process and when it manifests in you and I brothers and sisters when it comes out in you I it's the original thought and the original attribute that God said that you would be it loses nothing in the process now everything man creates it loses in the process it's hybrid can you say Amen but God's original thought of you you are in the mind of God in the process of thought can you say amen and then it's word can you say amen and then it's manifested and then it's bearing the image of the Heavenly it never loses its effect and never loses anything from it God has his time for you amen and if it's within a year of coming to truth if it's the very night you come to truth or if it's 20 years later if you're one of God's Sons and Daughters he's going to bring it to you he's going to keep trying that's why we can't have unrealistic expectations of people because everybody has a different time that they come that's why I said a few Sundays ago is that you got people realizing that they have don't have the new birth some people and they're discovering wow I'm lacking the the most important thing in my life but you know what praise the Lord praise the Lord and you can preach the greatest sermons but I can tell you that heart isn't coming to repentance until God leads them to repentance right you can hear the best preaching in the world but if your heart isn't repentant and broken and God doesn't move on you that you're sitting there and it's like water off a deck's back right you're not getting what you need to get it's not the father getting that hidden secret to you it's all religion it's all put on it's all being forced listen friends the father's trying to get his hidden secret to you that's what needs to happen but people can go 10 years 20 years 30 years and all of a sudden bang something happens in their lives that's why you have to be patient with people pastors have to be more patient than anybody because I'm looking for everybody to be saved and filled with the Holy Ghost in one service I would love it amen but but I don't orchestrate this it's whether the father leads you to repentance see you can open your heart more can you say Amen but the Bible says it's God that leads you to repentance you don't even have anything to do with that he has to break that heart and listen if you go and buck up against it for years God's got your number that's right God's got your number God loves you enough and whatever time he moves on you he will use anything that he needs to use to get a hold of your heart and it's amazing what God uses sometimes to bring a person to True repentance but your children and your loved ones you're praying for you keep praying because they have their season that I'm not worried tonight about the economy can you say amen I I'm I'm worried about me being in tune with God more than the economy can you say Amen one fell I was reading last week said I'm not worried about the world's economy I've got a hairline that's in recession I've got belly that's in inflation and I'm in depression so I'm not worried about the world's economy I'm worried about me I'm concerned about me can you say amen I I don't want to be a distraction to what the Lord's trying to get to me can you agree tonight how many years we go through our life and we let things distract us from the father trying to get that secret to us trying to get something to us we're we're the culprit we're the one that stops it up but if I could just just be released of all my cares and take my worries to the Cross can you say Amen say God I'm going to let you take care of that I'm going to work I'm going to try to plan my finances but I'm going to let you take care I'm not going to be worried about the cares of life as he said to cast your worries and cares upon Him He gave you permission to take your worries about this life and pray and cast it on him and he's going to work it out why because he has another Main Event the economy your finances is not the main event it's like that scripture that says money anth all things you know what that means money it's in Proverbs money answer it means the end of every conversation is money that's the world we live in is the worry of money the worry of the economy the money anth all things and I'm here to tell you it doesn't answer all things it's not the main event it's not the most important thing in your life if you didn't have a dime and God was getting this secret to you then you'd be happy in the Lord can somebody say praise the Lord if you didn't have a house to live in if you didn't have a dime tonight if the father was getting that secret through to you and you were filled with the spirit of God living close to him you're a millionaire can you say amen that's the main event that's the main thing in our lives you let so many things get out of you your job the money your wife your pastor you let so many things why because you're letting that be the main event but this is the main event is the father trying to get his secret to you I want you to go to Exodus 19 and exodus 19 of course is the scripture after the the the children of Israel had come out of Egypt and uh they had come across the desert and they had went through the different things and God perform miracles for them and many things happened then all of a sudden then when all that was uh kind of come to an end then there's there was an event here that uh in the process of the children of Israel sh several years down the road there's a process with the children of Israel that was something very huge that was going to happen now and I'll just tell you what is Exodus 19 is when God begins the process of bringing coming descending upon a mountain and descending to the people for the purpose of bringing his word to them now that's the first part we know he's going to bring his word to the people now he has been a god of Miracles he's been a God that's put Pharaoh's Army in the Red Sea he's been a God that's spoken through his Prophet he's he's been a God that's provided bread when they needed food he's been a God that's provided water when they needed water he's been a God that's provided a place for them to live even though they come across the desert he's been a God that they know that has many mighty acts but you see now friends God will not God has an agenda he has a purpose he wants to get something to us and so now in this process he stops and he's going to bring something through Moses from the mountain and he's going to bring his word to the people but tonight I'm hoping the Lord will help me and let you see what the purpose of all of it was because it's not even that he would give us all of his word to live by and you just hold on you'll understand that in a minute so after several years let's read in Exodus 19 and break it down after several years of the process with God now he comes to this huge moment and there have been public displays of God Israel has seen firsthand many things I want to say to you they have been keeping up the lamb since Abraham he had they the people had been taught to keep the lamb up so you realize when he says that statement they had been keeping up the lamb he's talking about 2,000 years of church history that they have been believing in the lamb Jesus Christ they've been keeping up the lamb but this word coming from the mountain was something something deeper than that to bring us into a mystery deeper than that than just knowing that the lamb cuz they were bringing the lamb they had they had missed the Lost circumcision when they were in Egypt so when they come under uh in the land and come into Joshua then they brought back circumcision but tonight I want you to notice this event and here's let's just read it in the third month when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt the same day came they Into the Wilderness of siai Mount Si for they were departed from rehim and were come to the desert of Si and had pitched in the wilderness and there Israel camped before for the mount so they're camping right beside Mount siani and there's a purpose in that because God's going to do a different event now okay and Moses went up unto God and the Lord called unto him out of the mountain saying thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob and tell the children of Israel so God in the mountain tells Moses to tell the CH children of Israel this principal God is going to speak to his people through a prophet don't you dare try to train change that process he didn't change it in Jesus Christ Jesus was the ultimate prophet he was the god Prophet but he said I'm going to speak and so here's what he said to the people verse four ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians so you know that's a message when itself and there's some brothers more capable than me than bringing that whole thing of looking back and miam Granda and the tambourine when you see dead Egyptians floating in the water an entire Army that they were afraid and running from and you're looking no wonder miam grabbed the tambourine because you look back and see all the things that your habits all the things that are there floating in the Dead Sea dead can you say amen I tell you God knows how to deal with your enemy God knows how to deal with your habits what a rejoicing that was to look back and grab the tambourine and Shout a little bit because they can look and see that's all finished now and it's done oh my that's wonderful but he that's the first thing he says ye have seen what I did under the Egyptians and how I bear you on Eagle wings and brought you unto who myself so now we're starting to get a picture of the mystery we're starting to get a picture of the purpose in all this God calling a prophet God bringing him out of Egypt which you know is a type of the world type of denom ations the call in Revelations 19 I believe it is to come out of her my people to come out of church systems to the genuine atonement to the the truth to full truth instead of limited Truth by denominations I I pray every person would pray about that because there's a calling to come out come out to full truth can you say am maam in the last days especially so so now you see then uh I brought you but but what's the what watch the mystery now I brought you unto myself there's a reason reason that God got rid of Israel's enemy there's a reason that God delivers you there's a reason that you take you he takes you under his wings how many can say when you come to the Lord he just took me under his wings of protection I've been protected from things that I didn't even know I needed protection from but in the word God is watching over his people how many's under his wings tonight he's letting the people know it's been me in all this I destroyed Pharaoh's Army I destroyed your enemy and now you're under my wings and all of it had a reason to bring you to myself yes now therefore if you will obey my voice indeed and keep my Covenant then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people what is this mystery it's about them it's about who they are yes right I'm setting you apart you're not like the world you're a peculiar people Paul picks it up in the in the new testimony he says you're a royal priesthood you're a holy nation A peculiar people I'm calling you listen there's there's there's nothing here in this mystery there's nothing here about God doing the Miracles and God displaying himself and God showing to the world his mightiness this is getting closer to what God does it for and that's to draw you into the Third pole draw you unto himself can you say Amen draw you into being a peculiar treasure For Me Above All people for all the Earth is mine and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation these are the words which Thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel so I'm going to come back to that in a minute okay but Moses came and let me just skip yeah Moses came and called for the Elders of the people laid before their faces all these words which the Lord commanded and all the people answered together and said all the Lord has spoken we will do and Moses returned the words of the people unto the Lord and the Lord said unto Moses lo I come unto thee in a thick Cloud the the Lord said unto Moses I'm coming to you in a thick Cloud that the people may hear when I speak with thee and believe thee forever and Moses told the words unto the people moving on you still with me the and the Lord said unto Moses go unto the people and sanctify them today and tomorrow and let them wash their clothes and be ready against the third day now I want you to notice this I've been preaching on the third the three being the mystery I've been preaching on uh Elijah having three parts okay the the first part is Mount Carmel the second part was the juniper tree but the third part is when the really mystery was revealed and the third part and that was in the cave when he says I'm not in the earthquake I'm not in the wind but I'm in a still Small Voice he called them to the mountain in the third month and on on the third day and he begins to do this the Lord will for the third day the Lord will come down in the sight of all the people upon Mount Si on the third day I will descend upon the mountain skip to verse uh 15 and he said unto the people be ready against the third day come not at your wives there's the third day again and it come it'll come to pass on the third day in the morning that there were Thunders and it came to pass excuse me it came to pass on the third day in the morning that there were Thunders and Lightnings and a thick Cloud upon the mountain and a voice of the trumpet exceeding loud said that all the people that was in the camp trembled and the mo Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God and they stood at the nether part of the mount and Mount Si was all together a smoke because the Lord had descended that's right the Lord descended upon that mountain in Fire and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace and the whole Mount Quake greatly and when the voice of the trumpet SED along and the wax louder and louder Moses spake and God answered him by a what a voice now I I I want to simplify this even for the children would be listening I I want to I want to take out of this I want to draw out of this some elements simple elements of this uh ascending from God for the purpose of drawing the people to himself not that they're caught up in a miracle not that they're caught up in the Supernatural but now for the purpose of bringing his word to the people for the purpose of drawing and making them priest he knows in Revelations 5 they begin to worship when the book was open when the lamb took the book he says Thou Hast made us Kings and Priests right so what's this mystery about this mystery is not about what God displays this is not about the public show of God this is what he's making the people into this is what this is an identity can you say man this is revealing the mystery of who you are thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information please contact us by visiting our website literall life. church and if you would
