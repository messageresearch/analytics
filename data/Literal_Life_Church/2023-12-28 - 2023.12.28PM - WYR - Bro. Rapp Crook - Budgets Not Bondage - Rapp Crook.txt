TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Applause] well I'm grateful for the Applause it's not usually what you get when you start talking about budgeting you might get Applause at the beginning but not at the end so uh anyhow well welcome um so we'll try to jump right into things I don't want to take anybody's uh take too much time this this afternoon you were all very patient with me this morning I appreciate that but um our OB itive uh this afternoon is uh try to introduce you to some some good habits I'm by no means a uh a a fiscal Guru or a financial uh know at all I'm not that at all um this was one of those sessions that the Lord had kind of put on my heart but I was thinking man I could uh name a number of folks who' be much better uh doing it than I am but um you got you get me today um this kind of comes out of an assignment that I give my senior economics class when we're uh um going through the last semester before they graduate so I give my apologies I've got a couple former students here today but usually you forget everything after you get your diploma anyway so it'll probably be okay we'll we'll uh we'll see but um before we uh before we start maybe we can just stand and uh take a look in our Bibles to the Book of Luke chapter 14 our uh our title today if I have to do a title would be um budgets not bondage uh usually people consider a uh a budget a form of bondage but uh we trust it uh it isn't Luke chapter 14 and verse 28 for which of you intending to build a tower sth not down first and count the cost whether you have sufficient to finish it lest happily or avoiding the situation that after you've laid the found foundation and not and you're not able to finish it although behold it begin to mock him saying this man began to build and was not able to finish it so our our Focus here this morning is from that first verse in 28 it's important to take the time to count the cost whether we have enough uh to finish what we've started upon and then uh our next scripture will be on the screen Proverbs 22 and: 7 the rich rule over the poor and the borrower is servant to the lender and our Focus today is we want to avoid that kind of bondage because debt is bondage let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your goodness to us thank you for your grace thank you for the opportunity Lord uh to come and gather together here at the Turning of the Year Lord I pray that this would be a time we can kind of get uh recalibrated um refreshed and ready to go into the new year Lord I pray that you would grant us uh wisdom this afternoon and Grant me Clarity I pray in Jesus name amen you may be seated so I kind of look at the uh at the phase of time U of Our Lives that we're in um kind of at the beginning of a race that we're running we finished high school or close finishing High School uh we're starting to uh um have the responsibility of uh paying for our own some of our own stuff we get some of our own money and things like that and we're ready to start out and we want to be able to start off and run the race without dragging this ball and chain of debt behind them I uh um just a short anecdote as we get started um I know of a um a friend of mine um he got married and it was a wonderful uh wedding ceremony um they were absolutely bride and Grom were completely in love and they are still in love but um after they got married the husband found out and they could have just easily been the other way around in this case the husband found out that the wife's car wasn't paid for they thought they had everything planned for all of a sudden they realized hey I've got $10,000 in debt but I didn't know was there I've got a car payment I didn't realize was there and all of a sudden we thought things were going to be one way starting off and they weren't we just kind of want to uh share some uh principles to hopefully we can avoid that kind of a situation ourselves we kind of introduce ourselves to a good habit which is is budgeting so we can avoid the bad habit which is debt just uh I was this is a a Christmas Eve article on the credit card spending in the United States for many US consumers maintaining their Lifestyles while grappling with inflation means relying more on credit cards how many of us have realized or felt prices going up in the last year yeah um definitely even if you don't pay for your own groceries you still feel prices going up when prices go up and you want to maintain your lifestyle you've got um you would think you had two options you could either increase your income to continue paying for the same things you're used to paying for or you could decrease your spending that would be the normal way of looking at it but Americans have come up with a third option and that's just increasing your debt it's interesting comparing the uh our our American mentality uh with a European mentality my my wife is Dutch we've got lots of we live there for seven years and um in holl uh a year or two ago heating prices went through the roof it was very very expensive they had great inflation when that kind of thing would happen in America prices go up really high we just get an extra line of credit and pay for it in Europe they actually did something revolutionary they were turning their thermostats down they were wearing sweaters wearing extra extra clothes around the house cuz the normal two options is either increase income decrease spend spending that was what the Europeans looking at Americans we just grabbed another credit card and increase our debt and if you look at a here's a a little graph about uh American credit card debt you see after 2020 credit card did actually spiked as much as I'd like to believe it it wasn't because of good American spending habits all of a sudden it was because covid relief we get all these checks from the government uh for Co relief and instead of spending them like we were supposed to to keep the economy going um people paid off credit cards with them but you can see once the co relief died American spending went back to the old habits and credit card debt has increased even before the preco um level so the average individual credit card balance in the United States and I apologize for uh Canadians South Africans um other folks of other nationalities this is going to be a an American Center topic the principles will be more or less uh uh convertible though $6,000 in credit card debt for household that's over $10,000 and what is the average uh um interest rate for credit cards uh for mid December according to Forbes Magazine the average interest rate for credit cards if you carry your balance over is 27.8% that's a lot that's a a lot of money um and more and more people are turning to that um 84% of Americans have at least one credit card most of us do how many of us have a credit card I yeah a lot of us have have have have a credit card 84% of us have at least one um 48% of people who have at least one credit card also have a balance that's being carried over each month so how many you have a credit card raise your hand okay you folks on this side put your hands down that side is carrying a balance over each month that they're spending 27.8% on that's what the proportions are like half of the people who have a credit card actually carry a balance over each month that they're spending um that they're not able to pay off and uh 14% of people who have these credit cards um have to use credit cards in order to pay for a $400 emergency $400 emergencies aren't that big of an emergency there are a lot of emergencies that are cost a lot more than 400 bucks and what happens if if it's an emergency and you have to get uh new tires 400 bucks for a set of new tires it's probably on the low side but um we put it on our credit card because we couldn't afford paying it off at the end of the month do you think we'll be able to pay off the credit card balance for $400 if we didn't have the money at the beginning of the month to start off with we probably don't have it at the end of the month either so all of a sudden that $400 set of tires we don't we're not able to pay it off we just pay the minimum off 27.8% interest gets charged on that I think that $400 set of tires just cost $500 and if you pay the minimum balance again the next month that $400 set of tires going to cost six within a few months that's a really expensive set of tires that you uh if we just saved up a little bit we could have saved ourselves a lot of misery so this beautiful couch sticker price might be $1,200 I'm probably dreaming on that but um say we don't we're not able to afford it we put it on our credit card we miss the first payment how much does this said that how much does this beautiful couch actually end up costing us well after missing the first payment with a 27% interest rate that $1,200 couch is now $1,500 a month later it'll be $1,800 a month later it'll be over $2,000 it was a gift that just keeps on giving and this couch you could put it on Marketplace and and try to sell it but you're not going to get the $1,200 out of it so credit is a way of uh getting what we want now but you're gradually just it's kind of like uh in the old days if a patient was sick they bleed them right and just hope that they bleeding them they'll they'll they'll get better well that's what credit is doing it's just gradually bleeding us and we're living the life we want to live now and then hopefully we can pay for it in the future that is however unlikely Jin Z let's see what j z as to how jinz is taking uh handling credit those are 18 to 29 year olds between 2021 and 23 Jin Z increased its credit card balance by 174% that's a lot a lot more credit is being uh used the average jzer owes over $166,000 that's the average one in here is about $116,000 in debt of that $116,000 $3,000 if it's from credit cards what could the rest of it be from Cars student loans those are all things that uh we we'll talk about cars here in a little bit but um cars can eat up your budget and it might not be the car that you actually need it might be the car that you want but it's just sucking um sucking the life out of your your budget for this $3,000 credit card de that the average gen Zer OES this $3,000 Visa balance let's just go through this uh game again at the end of the month you're proud that you're able to actually put something on that you you put $100 toward that minimum monthly payment what happens to your Visa balance it's not $2,900 we wish it were we just paid $100 of a off but that 27% interest kicks in and no longer is it 3,000 or 2900 it is now drum roll $3,683 and you wonder what was on the Visa balance what do we use our credit cards for we use it to go to McDonald's all of a sudden that Big Mac is getting more and more expensive we used to buy some new shoes we used us to buy gas we used to buy all kinds of things because we get points for right we get points for this points for that points for that the more points we get from a card usually the higher the interest rate is and but if we're not able to make that monthly payment and half of the people who have one credit card don't pay off the balance so they're paying something else on that you're just digging a hole deeper and deeper and deeper at a time in their life and we're trying to set off on our race into adulthood and we're laid down by this big chain of debt at the end and that's what we want to avoid so Visa balances credit card balances that's a a favorite way of achieving what we want now um however um uh The Lending uh sharks are are great at coming up with new products to help us out and I had not heard of this until relatively recently shop and slay with afterpay buy now pay later anybody ever heard of buy now pay later I actually had to grabb some articles and read about what this is but um in order to do this byy now pay later just sign up for this kind of a service um and I'm not recommending it um all you have to do all you have to do is that when you check out at Amazon or go to cooh whever else you can have the option buy now pay later they say it's like the old fashion layaway anybody here remember layaway from yeah but when you put something on layaway you put put the money and then once you finished paying it off then you got the item right that was oldfashioned layaway well buy now pay later you get it now but you just it's divided into several monthly payments the first thing you do you put in your credit card information or if you don't have a credit card you can put your debit card information in and that service conveniently will automatically charge you whenever the date for that installment loan is due so if you buy a $200 pair of shoes do shoes cost $200 wow wow wow $200 pair of shoes so they say hey 200 bucks is a lot to pay at one time for a pair of shoes I would say that as well um so they would say let's just split this up into four monthly payments you pay 50 bucks today and you're able to take your beautiful new shoes home in time for the banquet and then in 3 weeks you'll get charged another $50 in six weeks you get charged another $50 and the nine weeks you'll get charged the last your dollars and you got your shoes paid for hopefully they're still good as new and that's how the buy now pay later scheme works all you do is put your information in and the service will conveniently charge you at those dates they won't uh trust that you will remember the time period because you probably won't um they'll just take the money out of your account and make sure that it gets paid off no interest charged here and they're and they're billing it as uh no fees no interest Etc but let's just kind of see how it works a little bit more a quarter of respondents when who were surveyed about the B now pater app said their total debt increased after using the app that makes sense who actually pays for it uh the buy now pator apps aren't doing it out of the goodness of their heart and they're charging the store for the service because the stores no people who use buy now pay later are going to buy a lot more stuff so the stores will be paying about 9% I think of the purchase price will go from the store to the buy now pay later app and everybody's trusting because it's on credit you'll end up buying more more than 20% ended up using credit cards to pay down their buy now pay later balances so we're doing this as a way to avoid the dangers of credit card debt but at least one and five don't have the funds at the end of the period anyhow and they're still putting it onto a credit card and what's more um when you go into a store and they ask ask um you're buying a bigger ticket item and they ask you hey how about would you like get 20% off your purchase or 10% off your purchase yeah I'd love to get 10% off my purchase what's the easiest way to get 10% off your purchase at Macy's or pennies well get the store credit card so you do that um as they're hoping that you'll come back and put more and more things on um credit um you get that store credit card and I forgot where I was going with that right when you go and get that credit card uh that new one they'll do a credit check on you are you actually able to um are are you worthy of getting an extra line of credit you may or may not be approved buy now pay later it's pretty much automatic approval because the system is separate from the credit card bureaus so it's easy then for you I mean this easy in a bad way it's easy to get the extra money because we're not checking to see whether you'd be able to pay it off in the end anyhow so um they talk about hidden interest with the buy now pay later plans it's hidden interest because a lot of the time you're not able to pay it off after the period of time so the hidden interest is because you're ending up paying it off with a credit card that's charging your interest anyhow also like I said when you get a bay now buy now pay later um app going you can get one going and you've got one payment schedule and then I go somewhere else I get a second Bal payador app going with a second set of deadlines I can get a third Bal payador app going with a third set of deadlines before you know it I've got like three or four or five different deadlines I've got to make sure I've got money in my account to meet it's hard keeping all that stuff straight and a lot of the time it is going to uh it is going to sync you because um you're going to miss something you'll uh the money will be drawn from your checking account anyway and before you know it you might have a check Bal ing extra fees and things like that but all it's doing is helping us to maintain our lifestyle um and promising us little difficulty along the way however Jin Z that's most of us in here has nearly tripled its overall debt load in the past two years a recent Lending Tree survey shows and this is that that that's us tripling our debt load and at the time in their life and we're just starting our race into adulthood we're starting it like this and this is something I this is the picture that I want us to avoid I don't want us to enter into adulthood enter into marriage um with these uh with these debts some debts we take on um you can look you might be able to look on as more of an investment like a a student loan however I'd say with even with student loans be very I wouldn't go into student loan debt to get your major in art history you need toay have something you can actually be going into and using and being aware this is money is I I will need to be paying off soon and uh um you're you're uh you're you're going be paying off on this in your future and if you if you can uh avoid it by all means uh by all means do so twice as many marriages are starting off with death than they used to 43% of people married 25 years or more start started off with debt but people married 5 years or less so recently married 86% of them almost all of them are starting off with debt and again some of that um now it might be hard to avoid but if we can avoid getting off starting off with debt like this B that's that's a great thing to avoid because um most conflict within the marriage I know this isn't a marriage seminar this is not a a young couple seminar this is a a young people similar but we're looking to the Future most conflicts within the marriage are about money and all the married people said amen or is it just my marriage that's that no um most conflicts in the marriage are about money and after adultery money is the leading cause of divorce so I'm thinking hey I'm in this age of life where I'm getting ready to sit off my race into adulthood let's clear the table of all these things that could trip me up because we if if we can avoid this debt let's do that speaking of marriage heading into marriage over half of Couples married 5 years or less say that some of their wedding expenses were covered with a credit card and 73% of those couples say they regret the decision why does it have to be that expensed I I'm all for a beautiful wedding I think marriage is something that that should be prized and we should make a big deal about it this something people have been true to each other they're doing things right they're going to get married let's let's show why this is special it doesn't have to cost $50,000 though there are a lot of other ways of of of of of doing that and we can have a have a great to a great wedding but do I really want to go $5,000 in debt $10,000 in debt just to have a nice evening when I will be paying on that evening you don't want to be talking about that how expensive your wedding evening was on your fifth anniversary that's not the situation you want to get into so like I said more couples in the younger Generations accumulated debt to pay for their wedding than older generations and that 41% say they felt pressured to spend 41% of those married 5 years or less say they felt pressured to spend more than than they could afford on their wedding I just when I read the that what would be pressuring us to spend more than we could afford on our wedding my hunch would be Facebook Instagram Etc because you see the beautiful weddings are so and so ad so and so ad so and so we got to keep up with the Joneses it's not worth it but that is the observations of somebody who's over the hill I feeling like but the the uh the purpose of this is we need to be intentional with our money if we don't tell our money anywhere to go our money's going to be the boss over us if we don't Master our money our money will Master us and you can see here the guy pulling this beautiful nice car this is his his his dream car but it becomes his burden after a while you got the the the lady pulling out this beautiful iPhone that she sprayed P SP an iPhone new iPhone does it cost $1,000 is that really true $1,000 for an iPhone I that's incredible so you you you pay for it then you're just driving that's a that' be like carrying a 10 pound lump of gold in your pocket all day long it's an expensive thing and then your kid drops it um but yeah this is a lot of money uh you got this great house your dream house or this great couch but you're chained to your stuff and your stuff becomes your master and of you become a master over it and that just is illustrative of the principle that the borrower is servant to the lender now what I want to talk about today is uh hopefully we can kind of see now that there is a a need to talk about finances a need to talk about uh stewardship um I want to talk about um budgeting I like to go to this script here from Proverbs 27:23 as the reason why we budget be thou diligent to know the state of your flocks and look well to your herds you've got to know how your household's going on if you got a farm you got to how are your cows doing how are your sheep doing is there an infection going rampid you want to jump on it take care of it as soon as you can we're not Farmers now because this this agrarian symbol might not speak to us so much but um how many of us subscribe to things yeah um how many of us try those uh um one week um uh test period and then you forget about it happens sometimes too you have we don't have a herd of cattle but we might have a herd of subscription plans that we forget about and does that cost cost us money it sure does so be diligent to know the state of your finances because what you don't know can hurt you so it's important for us to we apply this going through our monthly expenses seeing what's where the money is going um what's left if anything what we're going to do with it uh Hosea said my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge and um our budgets are destroyed for lack of knowledge also it's a really really good practice uh to have to go through your bank accounts and I use a I use a budgeting app it's called every dollar it's a I pay $45 a year to have it connected to my uh to my bank account so every transaction gets dumped right in there 45 bucks a year that's a lot of money yes but I just give up nine cappuccinos throughout the year and I've paid for it that's how you take care of that um coffee costs a lot but if I could get this budgeting app and it works nice I can see everything that cuz you know what sometimes we're not always um we buy things without always checking with the other spouse not the big ticket items but um you know what Amazon Prime it's so easy to order things on there and you could forget to talk about it but if it's on that budgeting app it gets connected you can see where your money is going because a lot of the times um usually in a marriage in a relationship one partner is the spender the other spouse is the uh is the is the saver and the spender they're just doing what comes naturally to them they really don't mean anything bad by it they just don't realize that maybe the money is not there right then so this is where it's a partnership that hey we've got this got to see where the money is and hey if we can we can get it let's go get it if not we just kind of wait because what you don't know can hurt you so I'd like to see if we can um get some participation paent here I passed out a budgeting uh worksheet and I'd like to uh fill this in um somewhat interactively I am I'm happy to hold a monologue but my students give me like negative ratings for my monologues so we will be a little more interesting if I get some feedback from you um we're going to kind of walk through the budgeting worksheet usually when you make a budget you start with your income in this case we've got so many people here we don't we're not going to put income in there yet we're just going to see what does it actually cost to live in 2023 U this is what this is assignment I give my senior students they have to um go home with their parents to their parents and they work on this for an evening or two and they have to figure out what does it cost for a um a family of two a couple to live on and think imagine yourself 5 years after you graduate what might it be costing you to live and that's what we want to uh take a look at now so can we switch over to to the Excel sheet uh so we will uh since we don't know our know our income I'm going to leave our tithe and offering blank for the moment but what is a uh what is our principle of giving how much should we be giving in in tithes yeah very good that's our that's our our 10% 100% of our income comes from God everything we receive everything we have comes from the Lord God asks for just 10% of it back and then we can give offering on top of that because if we've given the 10% back we really haven't offered anything yet that's just what God has asked us to give back to them and then we are stewards over the the other 90% And that's what we're going to talk about now what what happens with the other 90% so we'll leave the tithe and offering for for a moment we'll leave savings for a moment but um what does it what uh any any any ideas what it might cost to uh for a young couple to be to have a have a small mortgage that's the amount of debt you have to buy a home or rent for a small apartment any ideas I know we live in different regions so we'll be taking rough estimates here um what might we expect to pay for a uh for a small apartment or or a home any ideas if you have an Apartments we can $1,400 14 and this is where like uh urban areas so say he said $1,400 $1,500 that's a that's a that's a pretty hefty chunk of change um so let's go Ahad and put in $1,500 in there uh Ian if you're from a little more rural area like where I live I know little one-bedroom apartment or something that some of our starters might have you're looking looking at close to $1,000 but um it's not cheap it's not cheap so uh we got uh so let's go and scroll up a little bit so we're expecting mortgage or rent to be uh $1,500 and rent yeah that it could be that it could be have the lights on I don't know about you guys but I have a thing with lights being left on my wife loves the the uh the warmth the that it makes all the decorations look better and I and my kids have inherited that I walk through the room I see a room nobody's in there lights off lights off lights off I'm like the the Angel of Darkness all the lights off my wife likes these types cuz she's the angel of Light she literally brightens up every room she's in thanks to American Electric Power no I'm teasing anyhow what does it cost for the electricity any any any ideas here 300 bucks a mon 300 bucks a month uh maybe in maybe in the summer with with air conditioning really high another another thought 100 bucks a month maybe in the winter would bundled up really well 30 bucks that's on the really low side but of course it it it's all going to depend what kind of house you have because some houses will heat with electricity and that's going to cost extra if your house is heated with natural gas then your electric bill will be uh lower but um say electrical bill for a for a small family I bet you're talking a good $150 anyway and you're not in the summer yet so let's put 1007 let's put it's 175 because how do you budget um you know what you look for an average cost over your over the entire year so ideally and our family just moved like I said so I'm still trying to figure out what my monthly costs are going to be like because we're entering into a a new season I won't know exactly how much it's going to how much I should be setting aside each month for electric cost after a whole year has gone by this is what we'll start off with gas again it'll depend is it natural gas is it propane propane I am discovering is much more expensive than natural gas any ideas what let's say Natural Gas what what might might we pay to heat our homes to cook Etc with natural gas any ideas 75 bucks in the summer maybe okay maybe yeah I bet the that's on the really low side maybe a single guy could do that but um as soon as a woman came into my life all my my joy went up we'll just leave it like that um we'll just leave it like that um now you're probably going to talk talk about yeah 120 150 bucks easy for natural gas and propane if you're looking at propane I just had to pay $270 to put my propane tank from 50% to 75% $271 63 it hurt so let's put in gas let's put in 200 uh let's put in 200 bucks it could be give or give or take a little bit again water will kind of go quickly any idea what water might cost for a month again it could depend if you're City water well water um well water City Water what what somebody say 30 bucks a month that's that's pretty that's what I paid when I was on City Water we I thought when I went to the country oh good I've got well water it's going to be free no I've got sulfur in my well so uh I'm paying $75 every 3 months or so and getting it softened so 25 bucks a month that's not bad but that in there for water sewage it's got to be getting rid of somehow guys um uh sewage any ideas what what what what your monthly sewer bill is costing your parents or is costing you 100 bucks somebody say something I think that's a pretty high one I think I was paying $75 every quarter or so so let's say 30 bucks a month or something like that for uh for for your sewer bill trash bill that was something similar 30 bucks a month uh we kind of U property taxes it's something you you have to pay every half I think I pay property taxes in the February and July and depending what kind of house you have if you're renting it'll be different um any ideas what property taxes might cost us where the Jack 7,000 no way wow and again it depends what part of the country 7,000 per year or half wow so that means you got to start setting up $3500 per half well I moved to Florida that's right $7,000 goodness um I think mine are about Le about half of that but uh goodness let's put in for property taxes uh 275 a month I'm just putting that aside every month I don't and I put it in my own bank account that way I can earn interest on it you can also have it automatically set up where it's called escrow where with with your mortgage your taxes are set up on top of that but you don't earn the interest on that if you do it that way housing Insurance it'll depend what kind of house you have if you're renting if it's riddle Insurance um let's say uh 120 bucks a month 150 bucks a month something like that let's say 150 bucks a month for that life insurance like why why do I need life insurance I'm young that's exactly the time to buy it because you want to buy life insurance as young as you can for as long as you can um so I think uh 30 Buck depending on what age you're getting it at brother Jack whole life okay yes um I I I think term life insurance is the better way to go because you're going um you can um you're buying it for that time of life that you need it so if you buy term life insurance you might be getting it for uh 20 years and now be that time of life I I bought life insurance I was 25 years old uh say something like that um I just got married I'm starting to have children and I'm going to I think I got like a 20 year 30-y year plan whatever would the max would be there so from 25 up to 45 or 50 I've got life insurance I'm I'm I'm covered then and after that amount I might need less because my kids might be close to being out to the home I will have gotten more saved so that if something were to happen I've got a nest egg that would support my wife and family more but at the very beginning at 30 years I don't have much of anything saves if I were to die my wife would not be celebrating because she's got the budget all to herself now she would really be in mourning for me of course of course um and then she's but she's got you want to make sure the house can be paid off you got enough to get pay off your house you want enough on your life insurance guys to put some kids through college if you have to because you want to make it as easy as possible for your your your wife and children afterwards because you don't want to create a situation where a wife feels pressured then to enter into a marriage relationship than uh just just to pay for bills so get some term life insurance that that takes you for as long as you can for as little as you can and you can get a good policy I think for 30 bucks a month if you're if you're a good healthy guy super 30 bucks a month your life insurance okay now this is the scroll on down here we can do a little bit better help me out guys um how much does a cell phone bill charge cost you each month I'm I'm interested doing finding out what do we $25 okay $60 75 35 35 prea plan okay Prepaid Plan course course all of these are going to differ are we going like 100% unlimited data plans um an unlimited data plan are we going to go for so many gigs per month um that's going to be an interesting one um and the other the other question is do you own your phone because if you own your phone all you're paying for is the service if you do not own the phone and you really wanted to get that $1,000 iPhone what's the most recent one 15 14 15 15 cost a big bunch a month you sell you sign up with with Verizon for a three-year plan so much a month that thousand phone see how much that actually cost you after three years it cost a lot more so my hunt somebody said 50 bucks a month something like that if you were to go with a um if you're like a a three gig data plan for two people you're probably talking 70 bucks a month 80 bucks a month if you're getting an unlimited data plan for two people you're probably getting close like what David said to about a thousand to about $100 a month and that's if you own your phone if you don't own your phone you're probably going to be paying on top of that that pretty fair Wi-Fi want Wi-Fi at home 40 bucks 65 so somebody yeah do you need Wi-Fi home or would you rather go with a um hotspot option like the Wi-Fi okay um I bet Wi-Fi 70 bucks a month pump them like that and phone cell phone 100 bucks a month fair enough health insurance unnecessary evil um man it's it can be expensive what does health insurance cost any thoughts here any want to 200 bucks a month for solo do you have cop pays on top of that okay okay 200 bucks a month um that's for one person um I think I've got a um I've got a plan like through the Brotherhood or Good Samaritan it's like $500 a month for two people and that's a uh the gold plan but let's put let's put 450 in there kind of average that out co-pays that's if you go to the uh depending on what kind of insurance you have to go to the doctor's office to walk in the door they might require you to pay a co-pay which is your portion of it you might have to pay 50 bucks before even see the doctor before you even get a bill you just have to pay 50 bucks to go in go into the doorway other health costs uh what other health costs are there besides health insurance glasses um dental insurance uh a teeth clean I just have to pay for my kids to get their teeth clean was 85 bucks per kid $170 last month went for teeth braces several thousand but we'll just we'll leave braces for now but um copay other health class how do you budget going to the dentist I would say hey you're going to go $170 say 200 bucks twice a year for $200 you put 15 10 uh $15 $20 down each month just put that right away an envelope let's put 20 let's put 30 40 let's put $35 for co-pays other health costs and then yeah you got to get your cold medicine you what what kind of prescriptions do you have I don't go to the doctor I don't get things but I bet you go to the chiropractor I bet you get your essential oils I bet you get your health supplements I bet you get your vitamins I bet you get organic foods my son and I are figuring out a system just to get organic stickers to put on the food so my wife it's a lot cheaper guys it's a lot cheaper cheap because I think organic is half the sticker that's that's just my uh that's just my uh my two cents worth there but yeah Health supplements that's not cheap those vitamins um so I don't know vitamin folks how much can you expect to spend keeping uh uh keeping two people healthy a month with vitamins let's say uh let's say 50 bucks let's say 50 bucks 50 bucks a month good groceries this is where my wife likes to save money say honey why you have to save money on groceries that's my favorite part of a budget but that's where she saves her money groceries um but what does it cost for a any the ideas what it costs for a family at two for groceries $300 for two 300 depends it will depend on where you live 300 anybody 500 for two yeah um let's go with 300 think it's possible okay very good um the the four walls of the budget the four most important pieces of of of your budget first one is is food you got to take care of yourself because if you're if you're not eating you can't earn income but food you get it from multiple places you can get it from Aldi and I'm not being paid by Aldi to mention their name but you can also eat out each month and I'm talking right now just groceries so if we um let's just say do what sister Duff says 300 bucks let's go with that Rebecca you mentioned that too as well 300 bucks for our our groceries but um are we as a young couple going to be eating out after church on Sunday we're going to go out with our friends aren't we probably so where do you want to go out you can go out to Taco Bell and get like their $2 value option I like the $2 value option from Taco Bell I really like that one I can get uh I like the the never mind we won't go there um you can do really well if you go to Applebees if you go to Olive Garden what can you expect to drop for lunch 50s for two of you for two of you you could spend 50 bucks if you give out especially if you give it a a tip and everything it's pretty easy if you go to Applebees that sort of restaurant three times in the month you're looking at $150 pretty quick aren't you so let's put our eating coffee trips how many times a day do we go to Starbucks how much does a trip to Starbucks cost yeah very good very good so I bet um will we get three cappuccinos a week from a restaurant wa four go with four $5 cappuccinos wow Wow Let's Go 6 * 4 is 24 * 4 that's $96 a month on coffee plus uh $75 in the month that right $150 a month going out to restaurants to be with our friends that's uh so uh 150 plus 96 $246 entertainment entertainment what do we do for this this could be our uh our subscriptions Spotify Apple music whatever other things there could be gy yeah um is it Amazon Prime are we talking $25 $30 a monthly subscriptions is that $100 a monthly subscriptions $100 monthly subscriptions really wow honey I've got got a wonderful wife so let's say uh 100 bucks a month of subscriptions man gifts that's one of those necessary evils this time of year right so uh what do you give let's say you have you have a man your friend uh bachelor party or baby shower or bridal shower as the case may be what do you give to those things you come from a large family what do you give for presents I mean you're going to have to give at least $5 that's what a card costs nowadays at least $5 pick your favorite family MERS you pick your favorite family members I'd like the just kind of like drawing putting in hat names in the Hat and everybody draw one name for the whole year and that's who you buy a really nice present for but I bet hey you could spend I'm probably showing how cheap I am but you could probably mean $40 a month for gifts that's not that much not that much put 40 bucks no no I'm talking for a month I'm talking for a month no yeah yeah and of course 40 bucks a month and December's not going to cut it probably not so this is includes like Christmas so there'll be some months man this is not very much it's brother Paul no goodness gracious man I bet you could I bet you to be easy do $200 a month and that that include your Christmas for your friends let's say let's go conservative and say 100 we'll just see how it goes uh wrong wrong field gifts yep vacation camps things like that do we like we like to take trips we like to take uh traveling around the country traveling around the world things like that like going to youth retreat um you probably spent at least $200 getting here right at least and you might go to another couple camps and you might take a vacation with some friends uh somewhere uh around somewhere here in North America or outside of North America what $2,000 like to take through nice travels hey you can be real be realistic I'd really like to be able to take a nice vacation how much does it cost for a hotel room you're talking at least bucks for hotel room when you go go go somewhere and I'm not talking Motel 6 you might do Motel 6 by yourself I will not do it with that lady no um so you go out so you go for a weekend away two nights no you're $500 a couple meals a weekend away you're probably going to be5 $600 out pretty easily you want to do that a couple times a year let's budget $1,500 and that's pretty that's less than our sister to the right was hoping for $1,500 uh $1,500 per per year so divide that by 12 thank you Ian that's that's going to be pretty cheap that's going to go pretty low let's say 2,000 divided by 12 we'll just kind of see see I bet this fund is going to get robbed every month when you're up short you're going to be robbing this fund going on down car payment what is the average car payment for a new car I hear $500 $600 both are in the the average car payment for a new car is $575 for a new car that's average car payment for a used car what's the average car payment depends on what kind of use a used car average car payments with $430 you go out to the used car you get a finance average car payments with $430 so you're just putting dumping money into your car are there other ways to get the used car there's a junker you go get get a get a junker of a car um and yeah then you're paying nothing per month I know some people like and I I get it um I get it that some folks would rather have a not get the old junker used car because you don't want the maintenance costs I understand that but let's say 400 $430 a month is the average used car payment what's that times 12 that's 4,000 say close to $5,000 a year yeah $5,000 a year that's a lot let's say in that year you have to replace all four of your tires and your air conditioning and do something else you're still cheaper than the used car payments you're still cheaper so I know and and I know especially uh I wouldn't want one of you your sisters driving the junker and getting stranded on the highway after a night shift I wouldn't do that you want to have a good reliable car going to be be be safe in in situations but um I wouldn't I would avoid car debt because as soon as you drive that car off the lot the average car is going to lose 20% of its value in the first year you're not going to get it back and within the first five years that car is going to be that will be I think worth half of what it was when you bought it whereas if you go out and buy a 15-year-old Toyota Corolla you go out and buy one of those you might spend 6 or $7,000 on it a year or two later you've driven it you've saved up enough money you can probably sell that Corolla for a little less or close to what you bought it for depending on the condition and then you've got cash to go out and step up a car that's the way to do that's not the American way the American way is I want it now I need it now I need it uh I put it on on on on credit but set yourself up what's called a a sinking fund so we could we could Del a car leave the 430 there now but leave the car payment there right now but if we were to put it at zero all of a sudden we pay ourselves $400 a month and we put it into a separate account at the end of the year we've got $5,000 and we can go car shopping at the end of two years youve get over $10,000 you can get a nice car with that so the the the purpose here is uh godliness with contentment is great gain you can really accomplish a lot by putting off immediate satisfaction so leave that for let's put four let's leave that there for now uh we'll kind of hurry through for fuel depending how far you have to drive let's say 250 a month depending on what what gas prices are like auto insurance I think average price of auto insurance for minimum liability coverage and depending on what your accident record and things like that the minimum amount is like is like 50 $50 $52 a month but let's up that to be like 70 bucks a month um car expenses you're going to have to change your oil uh have to get your tags renewed every uh every year so I would put money each month aside at least probably $40 $50 uh just in case you have um the expense thing come up clothes what do clothes cost us guys nothing right we're having food in rayment we are content um but um how much should we plan to spend in clothes zero yeah nice nice nice um yeah Goodwill hey hey Goodwill is a you can get some really good Bargains at uh the Goodwill however you got to you want to get a pair of shoes every every couple years that'll put you back $100 at least 150 bucks you're going to be getting the you're going be getting something every now and and then and I thought $50 a month was a lot of money for clothing that's really not that bad I didn't say 15 I said 50 oh so I uh that's pretty conservative is that really conservative 50 bucks a month let's put let's put uh let's put 75 no no um and of course I I had to add this for some of my students who are really into pets but yes brother Enoch this is the budget for both of you your wife does not have a separate [Laughter] budget no um we can leave the pet food part but this was for a former student of mine and like pets are expensive they're very expensive so scroll all the way to the top in our expenses this is after taxes this is after taxes this is our this is our take-home pay based upon our expenses right now we've got to have to have at least $5,000 so Ian go to the second sheet right now we want to see what do I have to do to get to the and that's without tithe that's without savings that's without a lot of things um so let's say here I've got up the top where we're going to figure out what this go throws hourly wages up there how much do I need to be earning working how many hours a week how many weeks of the year to cover this budget 14 bucks an hour how much do I have I do 14 bucks an hour for 40 hours a week 50 weeks of the year so we have B5 our yearly wage is 28,000 our monthly wage is 2,300 it's not going to cut it because our expenses were 5,000 so uh McDonald's Walmart it's not going to work let's try 25 let's try 25 bucks now I think that is about the hourly wage for a for a starting welder I think that's at 20 bucks 20 uh so that's 20 so if you get $25 an hour working 40 week 40 hours a week two weeks vacation you get $50,000 is that enough Ian go back to the other page it's not enough is it we're still almost $1,000 in the red we still and taxes are in there too go back to the other let's let's up to $35 a month $35 an hour rather here we might have something we can work with so now our question is let's let's plug it in here let's let's call this $6,000 a month go back to your first sheet put $6,000 in the income section yeah so now we've got $1,000 we haven't paid anything for go down to tithes so if we have $6,000 we got 600 bucks in tithes uh no just put 600 uh yeah that's fine yeah and offering I'll leave that uh I'll leave that to your discretion there but we've got $489 left for savings and uh tax I bet $66,000 a month is going to still be on it's going to be cutting it close but uh financial advisor suggest pay um saving 10 to 15% of your income each month for retirement planning and the advice is unless you really like dog food save for retirement so how much is uh 15% of 6,000 so $600 $900 so put that in under savings all of a sudden we're in the red again so our uh our salary needs to go up let's uh let's go to the second sheet let's get a $40 an hour $80,000 go back to the first sheet okay and what was that amount fill that in the in there we can look at this a couple ways guys because we're what I wanted to show us is what what kind of work we need to be having a vision for but there's other ways of cutting some of these things because yes we can try to increase our income but we can also try to cut some of our expenses too and some of these expenses could be cut we could uh we we we we we could do some trimming and I just want to say as we think about um about career plans and things like that think man it's be really really expensive my I was talking to my wife about this um session and she said rap what do you do with somebody like brother John le Fontaine who basically just left his job and went to be a traveling evangelist with with his family with a very uncertain income and I thought wow what a legacy he has not a big Financial Legacy I think brother Paul sings a song about uh what my father left me and the brother John le Fontaine left a very rich Legacy that can't be measured in dollar figures and if we just go about pursuing what we were just talking about well I I I I put this here on the screen so we can kind of be realistic about the decisions that we make and seeing what uh what life cost for we enter into it but we're looking at all these categories this is what I have to have in order to main the life maintain the lifestyle I want to have but there's a lot more things more important than the lifestyle we might want to have because a life of ministry it has to cover these Basics you have to be able to provide for your family but um there can be other priorities sometimes as well that might require some sacrifice and but when you see that how how how the Lord can move and can work and be effective through you even though you might be earning less than you might be able to it does make it worthwhile so don't just go about pursuing higher numbers the salary with the higher numbers that's where I have to go because yes that will put a lot more things on your plate but you might you don't want to buy into the world's lie you have to have all these things in order to be a happy successful family because that's buying into another form of the LIE can we go back uh scroll back up there so yeah if we have a close to $60 $700 a month then uh you've got some left over you can give that to uh offering you can give on some more to savings let's go back to the PowerPoint and I want to uh um kind of you've been very attentive when to draw this to a to a close sometime here soon so like I said we don't want to buy into the lie that we have to have all these things and have to have a job that pays for all these things because um increasing numbers that's another form of the of of just serving laia um have have an eye for Ministry what God wants you to do John Wesley said make all you can save all you can give all you can that's a very different Creed than loud to see which is make all you can buy all you can those are very two two two very different things but just as a rule of thumb and I have this on the slide in there when you're when when you're budgeting and trying to get estimate what what cost will be yeah housing is generally going to cost you about uh um let's go back a slide oh we're good hey this is good up one y God's blessings are real they really are if you honor the Lord with your substance if you honor the Lord with your tithe he will provide for you and U you can recount many examples of that I just a couple years ago we were getting ready to go on vacation as we're pulling out of the driveway I closed my garage door and it won't go down and oh man the garage door was busted had to just put on manual put it down and we'll figure out when we come back when I got home I had a check in the mail from somebody um um who knew me and it was sent you can see the postmark on the envelope was sent before i' left for vacation and it was a check for $500 I my wife's like yes we have I said honey I bet that's going to be about what the Gage short costs are fix and that's what it was God takes care of it you might think man I can't afford to pay tithes this month I can't afford to do it we really can't afford not to do it because God's blessings are real he does he does honor you but you can look on the uh look on the slid they're on the uh if you look at they're on the drive you can access with with the QR code we don't want to get into this thing we got to work harder work harder so we can get the money that we need so we can earn more money because all the money that we need happiness is just around the corner so we can buy the things that we need because happiness is just around the corner this is just the rat race that's the allow to see in Rat Race we work harder earn more money so we can buy more things so we can be happy and it just keeps on going uh the only tonic a way to counteract this is godliness with contentment is great gain that is the let us with food and rment let us be there with content yeah so yeah here's the the two hens talking to each other I'm depressed let's go out shopping and that's what they're counting on us to do the accy is counting on our continued unhappiness consumerism versus contentment here we're going to uh wind up consumerism is an economic and social system that encourages the consumption of goods and services as a mean means of attaining wellbeing and this is the system that we live with in our world today and it reminds me of La DEA I'm rich increased with Goods I don't have need of anything I think I've got everything it's all about what you have and it kind of looks like this I've got everything I want yet you don't realize that you're actually wretched miserable poor blind and naked that is a describing our our times they think they're rich yet they've missed out on true gold they have so many Goods they think they don't need anything yet they don't realize they're so destitute that they're naked and when they discover the truth and people today young people today in the world today discover sometimes their life that I've been sold to Billet Goods by the world none of this gives me with the happiness I hope for and when you find somebody who's discovered that that is a prime witnessing a opportunity because they've come to the realization I need something more than what this world has to offer they're driven to Despair and um sometimes they realize hey everything I put value in has been a mirage there's no purpose for living left and that's when God can uh reach them because they realize they have a need this this idea of consumerism is like the old Fable of the donkey but when the donkey is pursuing the carrot he never really gets it the only winner is the person driving the donkey and if we're not careful when we pursue well-being in the consumption of goods and services we are modern donkeys we'll never get the carrots the only one who's being benefited is the person who's taking our money promising us happiness but they're not able to to give it consumerism this is just buy just buy just buy the zombies going to just buy get get their happiness this is the world we live in I just have to get my next thing get my next thing but this is what we really need I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that is of True Value and white r you may be clothed the shame of your nakedness not appear and anoint th eyes with isav that they that you may actually see this is what we really need and God is send us a a prophet in this day to help us see the time that we're living in help us see that the the world's perception of value is indeed a mirage and he's trying to Shake us awake stop stop this jump off of this Rat Race get out of it and repent put your value what is truly valuable and then in uh in closing you just want to uh look at uh the book of Hagi and uh the book of Hagi he's a Hagi is a prophet um that is prophesying right in the middle of the book of Ezra and you can read think in Ezra 5 this is when hai's prophecy comes forward the people um the the Jews who left Babylon with Ezra they've started rebuilding the temple but they get discouraged after a few years and I think for a period of almost 15 years they stop completely and they just start working on their own houses building themselves up great things kind of focusing on what our budget was like what do I need to make to be living my dream to be living to be to be to be funding everything I want I want I want want to do and they were working really hard on their houses but they weren't making a lot of progress and God sent Hagi to him is it time for you to dwell in your beautiful houses and this house the temple to lie waste thus said the Lord consider your ways and this is my invitation to us today consider our ways how can we establish good financial habits now he says you've swn much and bring in little you eat but don't have enough you drink but aren't filled with drink you get clothes but there's still n none warm and he who earns wage Wes earne wages to put it into a bag with holes you work so hard end of the month you have nothing left over and God says to them and US consider our ways so my encouragement here to you and brother Paul you can get ready to come uh my encouragement to us is start uh start off now with a uh with with with a a budget start off now tracking your expenses start off now uh saving money it would be great if when you uh go into marriage that you don't have to go ones but you have savings coming into a marriage that' be a wonderful thing uh do that kind of thing um advice is to have a $1,000 emergency fund make make sure that you have $1,000 an emergency fund that you would be able to access right away in case there were an emergency because then you don't have to put on a car that you might not be able to pay off you'll avoid the 27% interest consider our wage when to be good stewards God has given us everything he asks us to be good stewards of the other 90% % amen let's pray heavenly father I thank you Lord for the uh principles you have on your word Lord that are both uh both uh can be both deep and also very very practical Lord father I pray that you would help us to apply some of the things that we've heard today and start making good Financial choices so that we can prepare uh for the future and being good stewards Lord I pray that you'd help us not to um buy into the LIE of loud DEA that well-being is just uh by the consumption of goods and services but may we lord follow your word repent anoint our eyes with eyesa that we can see Lord and by the true gold of real value father and Lord I pray that you would help us not to jump on this Rat Race and and follow the big numbers but Lord to be like our brother John LEF Fontaine father who years back made Financial uh uh sacrifices to to do Kingdom Minister that is still paying off great dividends today Lord I pray that you'd give us not just a a financial vision for our lives Lord but a spiritual vision for our lives too oh God In The Name Of The Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you thank you thank you rap I appreciate it so much um I wonder if you'd be available if anybody wants to stay over in the corner here and come and ask rap any personal questions about your finances and thing would you be available for that I'll be the first one in line want ask you but um yeah so if you do hang around if anybody does have any questions they want to ask you can do it there that way we can let the other ones go they that want to go um I didn't I I guess I missed the memo or maybe sent it and I forgot it but I was so glad that he took a session about this I didn't know he was going to do that but I always love uh to see the realities put in front of the young people of these this thing this is I like to I like for the young people to see real numbers and actually the these are a bit conservative what he put up today but uh these are real these are I'd like you to see it because it's a reality reality that you're maybe not into especially getting married my wife poked me on the arm whisper she says nobody's going to you know nobody's going to want to get married after this presentation today so it was more of a reality check than a teaching on money but uh what I liked is we had brother rap um married now and so he's a he's a good one I'm in a different season of my life now uh although i' I've done my best to live by some of these principles we had we had some school debt coming into the coming into the marriage and we had some things like that and then because we didn't make very much it was kind of hard but so I'm in a little bit different season it took me a while to catch up and catch things but uh they're at a great stage to be talking to you for the next stage of your life if God should have that for you because they're uh young married with three children so they're right in the right in the middle of reality of expenses coming up and that'll continue as they the kids get older and so I'm really glad and then also he's married to a Dutch girl and like you said they are I love the Dutch people I love them to death they're great matter of fact I whispered over to her leiz Beth I said you know the saying that if you're not Dutch you're not much that's just the way they feel about themselves and but they're frugal people they're not Frugal they're tight wads they are so tight with their money you know and that that's how I heard that's how copper wire was invented is two Dutchmen fighting over a penny you haven't heard that one Le Beth you haven't heard that one yet um but I I like to see um you know it's it's good to hear these things to hear the real numbers and also to hear that we know that God will God is our provider so we don't live in fear and a lot of young people with the economy uh my son just got married in March my son Solomon gine is getting ready married and the them and other ones that are heading into that it it is it is can be scary the environment of the financial thing because it is a lot of responsibility to take on to have a home today it is very expensive but I don't think we should live in fear um but we can't all we can't say to that uh and not be in action to pray and do something about our finances we can't just say well you know God will provide and and uh we'll just live on love and you know I don't like to hear those things cuz you have to you was wrong it's it's not reality and God wants us to have a sound ma mind and think about these things and uh you it does take things to be able to live in this life but God can provide for you and I've often said that God provides for the birds and and all those things God provides every day for them so why should we worry he provides that he does provide but for the birds they have to go out and find the worms they have to find their food and you have to do that as well you have to work you have to employ you can't just uh let these things go and expect uh nothing on your part expect things to come out of it so um you know real quickly uh we're in a little bit different season but when we were there it was tight it was hard and I think I gave my my wife a budget of this was 30 years ago cuz we just celebrated uh two weeks ago we celebrated our 30th Anniversary my wife and I yeah so thank you thank you yep it's awesome and we got these nice little mother of pearl rings for our 30th and um so we had it was nice because we had money to buy that now we didn't have that early on but we there was one year um we' always go try to go do something for anniversary even though we had the three three kids at that time and one year we one year we had enough bonus points at a motel for one night in Flint Michigan one night to go away so we got a babysitter it was probably Ike and Amanda babysitting our kids because we always left our kids with them one night the next year we did not have a dime to go out the year before we went that free Motel one night and we had some gift cards so we ate out with that the next year we didn't have anything so we decided to just do something and just stay home a St station Gideon and uh so the kids were downstairs we had our room upstairs and we just kind of Becca kind of dressed up the room nice you know and she had some candles going and everything and and so then the kids come upstairs and you know one of them walks in the room and goes wow this is cool in here this is great man it's like get out of here get go play downstairs you know didn't have a clue what was going on and Gideon walks in he's about five years old or six and he goes man this is cool what are you guys trying to do start a fire oh man that was funny but um even when you get started a little late and you shouldn't start late you got an opportunity here to hear these things to put them into practice stay out of debt that's what it says if you at all possible in a debt driven age try to stay out of debt try to pay cash for things uh don't get Bound by credit that's what we encourage you and you have an opportunity to set order your life according to that right now instead of starting with thatt in a marriage or or any other thing don't get on these layaway plans because if you're on the layaway plan my dad used to say the layaway P plan is if you get out you pay for it till they lay you away and it's true so um I'll make make one more comment before the fall in the garden God's son and God's daughter Adam and Eve they were in control of everything as a Son of God nothing controlled them they controlled things with the power of God and with who they were they controlled the atmosphere they controlled the Earth this Earth was created for them to control after the fall things begin to try to control them so if God's restoring us through Redemption he's bringing Sons back to living in a way that things are not controlling us before you come to Christ before you have a birth if you got a sexual habit it can control you if you've got a lust problem it controls you if you got a financial problem it'll control you but when we come to the Lord and He redeems us and we're coming back to sons of God we should say Lord I don't want anything in this life to control me including my time but I want to walk as a son and daughter of God I want to be in control with God's help of everything in my life and the Dominion you've given me that I with the Lord's help will be in control of that dominion and I believe that's what Redemption is doing to uh For Us Praise the Lord let's stand I'm going to dismiss you we've already prayed brother rap will be available with any questions and uh I I missed one announcement 4 o'clock is a choir practice here and that's in about 35 minutes anybody who wants to be in the camp choir can come
