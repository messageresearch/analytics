[2:09] amen um
[2:11] my table is full this morning and i
[2:13] wanna i want you to at least get a
[2:15] sampling of all of it amen
[2:17] so
[2:18] ephesians three
[2:20] uh we'll begin verses three to ten i
[2:23] traveling light i didn't bring my bible
[2:25] i just brought my ipad and i thought wow
[2:28] i hope somebody wouldn't get offended if
[2:30] i don't carry a bible for it so last
[2:32] night i said hey brother brandon get me
[2:34] a bible he said well brother paul's got
[2:36] a stack of old bibles here i said
[2:37] perfect get me one with the most
[2:39] anointing on it and and that way i'll
[2:42] have it close to me amen and so that's
[2:44] what was happening last night i had this
[2:46] bible sitting there
[2:47] amen so
[2:49] ephesians chapter 3 verses 3 through 10.
[2:56] how let's start start at verse 1. i said
[2:59] verse 31 let's just go one through 10
[3:01] ephesians 3 1 through 10.
[3:03] for this cause i paul the prisoner of
[3:06] jesus christ you gentiles
[3:08] if you have heard of the dispensation of
[3:10] the grace of god which has given me to
[3:13] you word
[3:14] how that by revelation he made known
[3:17] unto me
[3:18] the mystery as i wrote it for in a few
[3:21] words whereby when you read
[3:24] ye may understand my knowledge in the
[3:26] mystery of christ
[3:28] which in other ages was not made known
[3:31] unto the sons of men
[3:33] as it is now revealed unto his holy
[3:36] apostles and prophets by the spirit
[3:40] that the gentiles should be fellow heirs
[3:43] and of the same body
[3:45] and partakers of his promise in christ
[3:48] by the gospel whereof i was made a
[3:51] minister according to the gift of the
[3:53] grace of god
[3:55] given unto me by the effectual working
[3:58] of his power
[4:00] unto me who am less than the least of
[4:03] all saints
[4:04] in is this grace given
[4:07] that i should preach among the gentiles
[4:09] the unsearchable riches of christ
[4:12] and to make watch this ninth verse and
[4:15] to make all men see
[4:17] what is the fellowship of the mystery
[4:20] all right so this is not just some dark
[4:23] saying
[4:25] this is not some ancient spell this is
[4:28] not some
[4:29] you know some mystical mysterious thing
[4:33] this mystery wants to have fellowship
[4:35] with you
[4:36] all right
[4:37] which from the beginning of the world
[4:40] hath been hidden god who created all
[4:43] things by jesus christ to the intent
[4:46] that now unto the principalities and
[4:49] powers in heavenly places might be known
[4:52] by the church the manifold wisdom of god
[4:56] father we surrender ourselves afresh to
[4:58] you this morning and i i can hardly read
[5:01] the text lord without feeling the
[5:02] anointing falling upon me so lord
[5:06] there's so much to say i probably can't
[5:08] get to it all and we don't want to weary
[5:10] the people so i just pray for your
[5:12] wisdom that you would move me along at
[5:15] your pace i'm surrendered to you now not
[5:18] here for my own thinking lord i'm here
[5:20] just as your assistant we commit it to
[5:22] you in jesus name amen god bless you as
[5:25] you're seated
[5:27] so paul is bringing a tremendous thought
[5:30] here that at
[5:32] first blush you can you can miss a lot
[5:35] about what he's trying to get the church
[5:37] to comprehend
[5:38] and he starts talking about how that
[5:40] things that in other ages were not made
[5:42] known to the sons of man so it when you
[5:46] think of it in that connotation then you
[5:49] think oh there must have there must have
[5:51] been some
[5:52] you know some type of secret code some
[5:55] hidden mystery some teaching some
[5:57] doctrine something that was missed but
[6:00] but really that that kind of overshoots
[6:03] what paul kind of misses the mark of of
[6:06] what he's really trying to get their
[6:07] thinking he's trying to get their
[6:08] thinking
[6:10] lined up because he's trying to bring uh
[6:12] trying to bring them an understanding of
[6:15] their position
[6:17] in christ jesus
[6:19] and so it's very much like when you read
[6:22] in the old testament how that you and i
[6:25] know we've read it since the days of
[6:28] being children in sunday school how that
[6:30] god you know made himself known to
[6:32] abraham and abraham even when he's
[6:34] taking isaac for the sacrifice you're
[6:37] familiar
[6:38] amen behold father here's the here's the
[6:41] wood here's the fire where's the lamb
[6:43] and abraham says those wonderful words
[6:47] the lord shall provide see and we say
[6:50] jehovah jireh the lord shall provide
[6:53] himself a sacrifice and so we find and
[6:57] much could be said there i cannot get
[6:59] sidetracked today i must be studious so
[7:01] just keep keep me in prayer
[7:03] so
[7:04] so so but but then now oddly enough
[7:08] if you go on over into the exodus then
[7:11] god is beginning to talk to the
[7:13] israelites in their journey and talk to
[7:15] moses and he's going to make a strange
[7:17] statement that seems like that's that's
[7:20] that's inconsistent with what i know to
[7:22] be in the scripture
[7:24] uh but of course we know that there's
[7:25] nothing inconsistent in god so the
[7:27] inconsistencies in your understanding
[7:30] and he says to them he says now by my
[7:33] name jehovah i was not known
[7:38] speaking back about abraham's day by my
[7:40] name jehovah they didn't know me like
[7:41] that see you think wait a minute but
[7:44] abraham said he's jehovah jireh
[7:46] and so how how is he not making himself
[7:49] known but you're now you're beginning to
[7:50] get paul's angle it's it's it's like
[7:54] when peter talks about how that today he
[7:58] says we have a more sure word of
[8:00] prophecy
[8:01] now he wasn't meaning that that it's all
[8:04] about you know we understand it
[8:06] doctrinally better than the old
[8:08] testament saints what he's saying is
[8:11] that now what they held in prophecy
[8:14] we're the materialization of
[8:16] we're those words in flesh we are we are
[8:19] now the living prophecy that they only
[8:22] knew is a prophecy but now it's a more
[8:25] sure word to us because we're it
[8:29] and so when he's when he's dealing with
[8:31] he's saying you know by my name jehovah
[8:34] because remember that that abraham
[8:37] calling him lord and brother branham
[8:38] would repeat constantly capital l
[8:41] capital o capital r capital d it's it's
[8:43] elohim but remember that elohim is the
[8:46] self-existing one whereas jehovah is
[8:50] that same being not a different one but
[8:52] he's moving forward in his unfolding and
[8:55] his unfolding is in manifestation
[8:58] and so now he's got a family which now
[9:01] is is closer to the meaning of jehovah
[9:04] god living with his family god with the
[9:07] family so so now he's simply saying it's
[9:11] not that abraham didn't understand
[9:14] jehovah jireh he called me that but but
[9:17] but i wasn't known like that i because i
[9:19] only had abraham
[9:21] and and i only had isaac but my but my
[9:24] but i but in my vision i see a whole
[9:27] family more than the stars of heaven and
[9:29] the sands of the sea and by the time
[9:31] they're walking through the wilderness
[9:32] two and a half million people now god is
[9:35] more like jehovah because now he's got a
[9:38] family
[9:39] [Applause]
[9:41] so now you're i'm trying to get your
[9:42] mind going in the same direction you
[9:44] understand so this is
[9:46] unfolding all right so so we realize
[9:50] then that paul now is coming to the
[9:52] church in ephesus
[9:53] and remember that everything he's trying
[9:55] to teach them this is what we are to
[9:58] achieve that that church got relaxed
[10:01] ephesus and fell away
[10:03] and therefore there was no way for
[10:05] christ to come and take a bride in a
[10:08] rapture
[10:10] all the apostles were aiming at that and
[10:12] they were preaching at that but the
[10:13] church began to be
[10:15] infiltrated by make believers and
[10:17] unbelievers and and you've got the
[10:18] apostles writing letters and saying you
[10:21] need to earnestly contend for the faith
[10:23] once delivered to the saints you know
[10:24] and you've got john writing about
[10:26] gnosticism it's encroaching effect on
[10:29] the church and said anybody who won't
[10:31] say that jesus christ has come in the
[10:33] flesh because gnostics didn't believe
[10:34] that because they didn't want to believe
[10:36] that because if they if they admitted he
[10:38] was a man then that put that put a
[10:40] responsibility on them to live a holy
[10:43] life because they were men and they
[10:45] didn't want to live a holy life so they
[10:46] wanted to make him a spirit or an angel
[10:48] or a phantom or something there's no way
[10:50] a human could live like that but a human
[10:52] can live like that as long as that same
[10:55] spirit that was in him is dwelling in
[10:57] you
[11:00] amen
[11:02] all right so i'm just just trying to
[11:04] build in lay foundation get us all on
[11:06] the same on the same direction
[11:08] so so we find then that that that church
[11:12] fell away and so rather than christ
[11:16] being able to come and take a bride in
[11:18] the rapture as everything in the letters
[11:20] of the apostles was aiming at then what
[11:23] happens we see christ has to sit back
[11:26] down in the eternities he has to
[11:28] intercede for the ignorance down through
[11:30] 2000 years he seals up the word under
[11:33] seven seals but he promises at the end
[11:36] time he'll break that seal and unveil
[11:39] christ again and there'll be an omega
[11:41] bride who's predestinated not to fall
[11:44] like that and this omega bride will be
[11:46] restored back to where the alpha church
[11:49] climax and begin to descend and we'll
[11:52] pick up at that climax and take it on to
[11:54] a body change
[11:58] so you're living in unprecedented times
[12:01] you're
[12:01] it is upon you what's going to happen to
[12:04] you and i has never happened there's
[12:06] never been a global many-membered bride
[12:10] taken in a body change and all the
[12:13] saints down through all the new
[12:15] testament era will be raised
[12:18] and we which are alive and remain shall
[12:20] be changed and the procession shall go
[12:22] by and every age jumping in and brother
[12:25] branham said as they go by then we'll
[12:27] fall in line and we'll go marching off
[12:29] to meet him in the air hallelujah
[12:32] that's an hour see your future is bright
[12:35] friends don't worry about what the
[12:36] devil's up to he ain't nobody you don't
[12:38] live by his mercies he don't have any
[12:40] say over your life your your whole life
[12:43] is in the hands of god and your future
[12:45] is bright
[12:49] god's whole purpose is to get you
[12:50] marching in the step of the gospel
[12:52] according to the vision
[12:55] wow all right so
[12:59] so now we see that this is why paul
[13:02] would would say
[13:04] there's a fellowship
[13:06] with this mystery in other words there's
[13:09] going to be a further unfolding that's
[13:11] going to unfold not in extra teaching
[13:14] not that
[13:15] that there's something in william
[13:17] branham's message that's beyond saint
[13:20] paul there's nothing william branham
[13:22] taught that's not what paul taught
[13:24] it's not everything he taught was
[13:26] established because you can't add to
[13:28] paul's revelation but there is a a
[13:31] greater fulfillment in the people in the
[13:33] bride because we're going in a body
[13:35] change
[13:37] so so we find then that that that's what
[13:40] the message of the hour restores us back
[13:44] to
[13:44] because that word is is effective to do
[13:48] it and we're predestinated not to repeat
[13:50] what happened to eve what happened to
[13:52] the
[13:54] jewish the hebrew church what happened
[13:56] to the christian church they all every
[13:59] time christ got ready every time god got
[14:01] ready found them polluted but this bride
[14:03] is predestinated to not fall
[14:14] so so
[14:15] so then we find that god now
[14:18] and then this and now i'm going to have
[14:19] to now turn it turn a quick corner
[14:22] and there's probably going to be more
[14:23] than four corners so just let me keep
[14:25] turning corners
[14:27] it might be a multi-sided building here
[14:30] so
[14:31] so we find then that now that you're
[14:33] understanding
[14:36] the development
[14:37] that it's continued manifestation it
[14:40] just keeps unfolding and
[14:43] and every time here's a here's an
[14:45] important point
[14:46] every time
[14:47] something more of god
[14:50] is known
[14:51] it's known by an unfolding in the people
[14:56] and every time there's an unfolding in
[14:58] the people
[15:00] it's it always verifies that every
[15:03] unfolding before it was also god because
[15:05] he's the same yesterday today and
[15:07] forever
[15:09] he's of old up from everlasting and so
[15:11] that's the old testament way of saying
[15:13] yesterday and forever from old from
[15:15] everlasting and it meant that every time
[15:17] that that's how you know it's the word
[15:19] because it unfolds more of christ and it
[15:22] and it and it and it's a natural
[15:24] continuation it it's not uh it's not
[15:27] something that would contradict
[15:29] a previous unfolding
[15:32] see it's all continuous and
[15:34] and and it's it's really more than
[15:36] contiguous it it actually overlaps it it
[15:39] moves and blends and and and every time
[15:42] it gets the focus gets more and more and
[15:45] more until finally you're coming now to
[15:48] the last day and we're going to see a
[15:50] bride under a capstone ministry
[15:52] say how far is it going to go into his
[15:56] very image
[15:59] that's the prophecy pick up your pen and
[16:02] write that's what he he wrote this bride
[16:04] will be in his very image so she's
[16:08] coming all the way to a body change all
[16:10] right now i got to keep moving
[16:12] so so now that you understand that's how
[16:15] it's unfolding that's how it's going
[16:16] that's what fellowship with the mystery
[16:18] means that it's christ in you becoming
[16:22] you as i said last night looking where
[16:24] the i am is it was in moses it was in
[16:27] david it was in john it was in jesus it
[16:30] was in the apostles and it's in you and
[16:32] i
[16:33] see
[16:34] so and it always bears the same nature
[16:37] always has the same characteristics now
[16:41] brother brennan makes an interesting
[16:42] statement
[16:43] and sirs we would see jesus
[16:46] now what he's about to say
[16:48] is certainly uh
[16:50] uh you know
[16:52] not inconsistent with the scripture i'll
[16:53] prove to you just in a second
[16:56] brother branham says sirs we would see
[16:58] jesus
[16:59] as our scientists tell us
[17:02] it's long ago three minutes until
[17:05] midnight
[17:07] now watch this it took a prophet to say
[17:09] this i'd never had the courage to say it
[17:10] but took a prophet to say it
[17:12] but we know
[17:14] the hand of god has stopped time
[17:19] to wait
[17:21] just long-suffering like he was in the
[17:24] days of noah
[17:26] now you're already going to have to
[17:28] abandon the classical model of time i'm
[17:32] just going to tell you right now
[17:33] because god measures
[17:36] existence according to prophecy not
[17:39] chronology not this this thing doesn't
[17:42] govern god
[17:43] understand this governs his actions
[17:48] this is happening in this but this
[17:50] doesn't control this it's the other way
[17:52] around
[17:53] and god has got his hand on the governor
[17:56] and he's manually controlling how fast
[17:58] things speed up how much they slow down
[18:00] how fast they speed up how much they
[18:01] slow down see
[18:03] now you can see that friends in the
[18:05] scripture and i'm not going to have you
[18:07] turn because it would really get bogged
[18:09] down take way too much time
[18:11] but it's familiar to us when we go into
[18:14] uh revelation seven and we
[18:17] we find that you've got you know you're
[18:20] gonna have the 144 thousand spoken of
[18:23] there and brother branham says perfectly
[18:26] an interval of time to deal with with
[18:28] catching
[18:29] the the 144 000 brother branham says it
[18:32] fits perfectly between revelation 6 and
[18:34] revelation 8 which is the coming of the
[18:36] lord and and it's it's a little interval
[18:38] of time to get israel under the trumpets
[18:41] but it's also an interval of time
[18:43] between not only the sixth and seventh
[18:45] trumpet but in an interval between the
[18:47] sixth and seventh seal because it's also
[18:50] gotta come down and drop a prophet into
[18:52] the earth and call a bride out and no
[18:54] one knows she's the bride they think
[18:56] she's a cult and they don't realize
[18:58] she's becoming into fellowship with the
[19:00] mystery and then he takes her off the
[19:02] earth not in a global event covered by
[19:04] satellite a secret rapture
[19:07] see and it's just a little interval of
[19:09] time this is why brother branham that's
[19:11] why brother branham would say the church
[19:13] goes up in revelation 3 and she's not
[19:16] seen again until revelation 19. and
[19:19] brother branham said oh everything else
[19:21] is is concerning israel you say well how
[19:25] does that what does that look like how
[19:26] does that even work but it actually fits
[19:29] perfectly because
[19:30] because god god is once the bride goes
[19:34] up in a rapture in in time then god
[19:37] turns to the jews the eagle anointing
[19:40] simply lifts up flies east picks up
[19:43] moses and elijah and goes to the 144 000
[19:46] and they get born again by the holy
[19:48] ghost by believing the same message you
[19:50] believe
[19:53] this is why when you see them in
[19:54] revelation 15 standing with the unwise
[19:56] virgin they're both standing there one
[19:59] has the song of moses one has the song
[20:01] of the lamb but only the 144 thousand go
[20:04] into the millennium and the and the
[20:06] unwise virgin don't
[20:09] they don't they're not getting the
[20:10] millennium why because they're not born
[20:12] again
[20:13] you understand now they have salvation
[20:15] from destruction not in the ra not in
[20:17] the tribulation but they went into the
[20:19] tribulation already saved from
[20:21] destruction because they have a faith in
[20:24] the death burial and resurrection of
[20:25] jesus christ and they're holy people
[20:27] they're not this fakery this artificial
[20:30] christianity today that's that's garbage
[20:33] and nonsense but they're holy people
[20:36] righteous people they're called saints
[20:39] saints mean sanctified ones and the king
[20:42] will say unto the righteous and the
[20:44] righteous will say unto the king matthew
[20:46] 25. so we find that day that brother ram
[20:50] says they have a seed they just never
[20:52] get the moisture they never their seed
[20:54] is never germatized see because because
[20:57] why they rejected the message of the
[20:59] hour and that's how you get germatized
[21:01] by a personal revelation of christ to
[21:04] you and you believe it and then god
[21:07] performs it in your life
[21:09] [Applause]
[21:11] no wonder i can't miss the rapture i
[21:13] couldn't prevent my new birth i won't
[21:15] prevent my body change hallelujah i was
[21:18] running all over the world but when the
[21:20] time met prophecy god caught me
[21:24] and i'm here to tell you i got all kinds
[21:25] of ups and downs and ins and outs and
[21:27] weaknesses just like you but on that
[21:29] morning the trumpet of god will sound
[21:34] and i will know him as i'm known
[21:42] so we find
[21:44] that
[21:46] when revelation 7 opens
[21:50] you have the four angels standing on the
[21:52] four winds
[21:54] and there
[21:55] it's it's over we're done it's time for
[21:58] tribulation
[21:59] and the first woe second third woe are
[22:02] gonna sweep the earth clean of humanity
[22:05] and they would have actually all they
[22:06] would have went continuously
[22:08] but but but but an angel rose out of the
[22:11] east
[22:12] with the seal of the living god of
[22:14] course it shows it's a portrait of
[22:16] christ in bible imagery because only
[22:18] christ has the seal of the living god
[22:20] he's the only one who can seal you
[22:22] and not only that he's the only one who
[22:24] can serve an injunction on his own on
[22:26] his own word he's the only one who can
[22:29] stop time
[22:31] see and so he rises up they've already
[22:33] got a commission to destroy the earth
[22:36] first of all second world third world he
[22:37] says hold it stop wait
[22:40] hold up
[22:42] there's other words i've got to fulfill
[22:43] first i've got people down there and i
[22:46] got to get them sealed in hallelujah
[22:48] hallelujah and that's why well and
[22:50] that's why when the first woe it brings
[22:53] on world war one then he comes there to
[22:55] stop it because what does he do he stops
[22:58] time he can't let it run to armageddon
[23:00] yet because at this time this under the
[23:03] fifth trumpet a prophet isn't even born
[23:06] yet
[23:07] to redeem a gentile brag so he's he's
[23:10] got to stop time not stop this kind of
[23:12] time but he freezes this kind of time
[23:18] makes sense
[23:20] so that's exactly what he's doing and
[23:22] that's why they don't know to this day
[23:23] who stopped world war one
[23:25] see
[23:27] but but we know that god stopped it
[23:30] now malachi 4 is identical to that
[23:33] behold i will send you elijah the
[23:35] prophet
[23:37] before the coming of the great and
[23:38] dreadful day of the lord see
[23:40] but so now the prophecy is the great and
[23:43] dreadful day of the lord
[23:45] and it's coming once it gets going
[23:48] there's going to be no stopping it
[23:50] however there's a little interval of
[23:52] time when when i'm going to send elijah
[23:55] down and call a bride out and and and
[23:58] grab a quick bride and just do a short
[23:59] quick power forward take her off the
[24:01] earth
[24:02] and then the great and dreadful day of
[24:04] the lord will have its play and it'll
[24:06] it'll go out into the end of the
[24:07] tribulation so
[24:09] so we see then that's that's what
[24:13] you know that's what seventh-day
[24:14] adventists are missing that's what the
[24:16] the people who who try to say that you
[24:19] know revelation 10 is to israel they
[24:22] they're missing the secret of the
[24:23] interval
[24:25] because they say well revelation 4 all
[24:27] the way from there on is israel and it
[24:30] is israel but you have to understand
[24:32] that that this interval of time god is
[24:34] coming down to take a bride home and and
[24:37] that's why when when revelation 4 opens
[24:39] she's called up higher she's a door
[24:42] which is christ a revelation further is
[24:45] now open and that's why brother branham
[24:47] talks about revelation 5 and 4 by
[24:50] connection because they're the exact
[24:52] same event
[24:53] that that brother brown said he's
[24:54] showing in revelation 5
[24:56] how he pulled it off how did he get her
[24:58] in those first three chapters how did he
[25:00] take her in the rapture this is how he
[25:01] done it and he goes into revelation five
[25:03] and brother adam goes to boaz and ruth
[25:05] and and again i can't get sidetracked
[25:07] but but we find then that that that's
[25:10] why when we come to revelation 7 there's
[25:13] another pause and then and then god's
[25:15] got to bring elijah and then we we find
[25:18] the coming of the lord and the coming of
[25:20] the lord under the opening of the seals
[25:22] and now prophets on the scene and now
[25:24] you've got a a mighty angel who's
[25:26] showing up visible
[25:30] hallelujah and he's got every in in all
[25:33] the bible imagery of revelation 10 1
[25:36] it's literally the bible imagery of
[25:39] christ in his bride christ in his body
[25:42] and it's not the first time that's
[25:43] happened brother branham said the very
[25:45] one in the walking in the seven lamp
[25:47] stands was actually christ but in the
[25:50] form of his body in the form of his
[25:52] bride hallelujah that's why brother
[25:55] branham would call it a bride coming of
[25:57] christ
[26:00] see
[26:01] jesus doesn't come to this earth his
[26:04] feet don't touch this earth until
[26:06] after until revelation 19.
[26:08] we meet him in the air for a rapture so
[26:11] how is he descended into the earth and
[26:13] still he's in heaven because he's in you
[26:16] it's now an unfolding there's a people
[26:18] and a fellowship of the mystery
[26:21] and she is the blood of god by the
[26:23] spirit and you are the continuation of
[26:26] that same creation
[26:32] so malachi 4 is that if you look at it
[26:34] from the hebrew
[26:35] it's an injunction
[26:37] he's saying
[26:38] i'm going to destroy it all
[26:40] however
[26:41] i'm going to i'm going to serve upon
[26:43] myself a temporary injunction and i'm
[26:46] going to first send elijah before the
[26:49] coming of the great and dreadful day of
[26:51] the lord and once he's gone and the
[26:53] bride is out of the way have at it
[26:56] then the word is going to roll and
[26:58] steamroll the whole world they can't
[26:59] stop it
[27:01] because it's the word of prophecy all
[27:04] right
[27:05] now so brother branham
[27:07] now here's another example
[27:09] that brother branham uses
[27:11] in god's stopping time to wait all right
[27:15] just like in the long suffering days of
[27:17] noah
[27:18] just like when you when god told uh
[27:21] moses it'll be 400 years i told abraham
[27:25] it'll be 400 years
[27:27] but we find out that paul when he
[27:28] records the chronicling of it paul says
[27:31] it was 430 years
[27:33] why because it's it's god moving at the
[27:36] pace of prophecy
[27:37] not moving at this he's moving at this
[27:41] this is you take comfort in that
[27:43] because that means that everything you
[27:45] see happening in the world is is under
[27:47] perfect control
[27:49] it's happening what's supposed to be
[27:51] happening there's no need for us to be
[27:52] fearful you don't have to be afraid of
[27:54] anything all we have to do is have the
[27:56] wisdom of the mind of christ to know how
[27:58] to go forward
[28:01] see
[28:03] so brother branham now here's another
[28:04] example brother branham it's very
[28:06] familiar to you look away to jesus now
[28:08] you might see some little odd things
[28:10] happening for me nothing sinful i don't
[28:12] mean that but i mean something odd
[28:14] to what the regular trend
[28:16] so in other words you're going to have
[28:17] to lose your classical model
[28:20] you're not going to be able to think of
[28:21] it normally see
[28:22] because this is something this is an
[28:24] eternal purpose working
[28:26] and those kind of things crop up all the
[28:28] time god does things in mysterious ways
[28:32] that defy the classical model and when
[28:34] people try to look at god in that way of
[28:36] human intelligence and intellect and to
[28:39] in intuition they end up that he's three
[28:41] or two or one only or they end up that
[28:44] that he contradicts and they they say
[28:46] the bible contradicts itself that's
[28:48] because they're looking at it through
[28:50] human intellectualism
[28:52] but god is mysterious you can't always
[28:55] look at him in that classical way you've
[28:57] got to have faith
[28:58] you've got to believe he that cometh to
[29:00] god must first believe that he is
[29:04] see
[29:07] so brother branham says he says not it's
[29:09] just it's going to be odd to what the
[29:11] regular trend because where i've where i
[29:14] reach to now
[29:17] in the ministry i'm dropping back here
[29:20] now he's not telling yet why he's just
[29:23] he's just bringing you up to speed to
[29:24] say
[29:26] i've got to drop back because of where
[29:28] i've arrived at now
[29:29] what does that even mean brother brown
[29:31] all right sit still
[29:33] he says
[29:35] he says because where i've reached to
[29:37] now in the ministry
[29:39] i'm dropping back here watching that
[29:41] spot and waiting for the time to use it
[29:43] he's referencing the third pool but it's
[29:45] going to be used
[29:47] he says now i must lay quietly for a
[29:49] little while just a little while now
[29:51] remember and who is listening to this
[29:53] tape you might see
[29:55] such a strange such a change in my
[29:57] ministry right away
[29:59] dropping back
[30:00] not going forward no i mean sorry not
[30:03] going up dropping back
[30:06] here now he's going to give the rhyming
[30:08] reason to it all we're right at the age
[30:11] now
[30:12] and it can't be
[30:14] can't go any further
[30:16] see now you're just like in revelation 7
[30:19] because the three woes were to sweep the
[30:22] earth clean of humanity and allow him to
[30:24] annihilate god pulls all the chucks out
[30:26] of the wheels and the wagon rolls off
[30:28] the cliff
[30:29] and and god's not going to destroy the
[30:31] world mankind god's just going to take
[30:33] you out of the way you're preventing it
[30:36] and as soon as he takes you out of the
[30:37] way he that letteth will let till he
[30:39] christ in the bride be taken out of the
[30:41] way
[30:42] and then then it rolls off the cliff and
[30:44] so man's going to destroy himself
[30:46] see
[30:48] so god doesn't have to destroy anything
[30:50] he's going to let man do it to himself
[30:53] and so he says
[30:54] dropping back not going up dropping back
[30:57] we're right at the age now it can't be
[30:58] can't go any further we have to wait
[31:00] just a minute until this happens over
[31:02] here
[31:03] to catch up then the time comes but it's
[31:06] thoroughly identified so now he's
[31:08] talking about time as it relates to
[31:10] prophecy so in other words revelation 7
[31:13] was ready to go but wait hold on i got
[31:15] to first seal the servants because i got
[31:17] another prophecy back here
[31:19] that says i'll have servants and i got
[31:21] to get them sealed so now when we come
[31:23] over here and it starts unfolding in
[31:25] real time an angel descends out of the
[31:27] east having the sealed living god and
[31:29] says wait
[31:30] time time out
[31:32] now the clock kept going this kept going
[31:35] but a war stopped
[31:37] and political geopolitical things began
[31:40] to move in the earth and we found out
[31:43] that what god is doing and they think
[31:45] it's this nation and that nation and you
[31:47] know they gotta you know austrian amen
[31:50] gets assassinated and we're gonna go to
[31:52] war and it becomes a global affair
[31:53] because now it's not just nation rising
[31:55] against nation you'll have that jesus
[31:57] said wars and rumors of wars you'll have
[31:59] that the end's not yet this now is
[32:01] beginning to be the first time that it's
[32:04] world war ii
[32:07] that it's whole nations against whole
[32:10] nations
[32:12] see so it's it's beginning to be now
[32:14] you're starting to see unprecedented
[32:16] time unprecedented things strike the
[32:19] earth that's never been in existence
[32:21] and so what's controlling it prophecy
[32:24] so now the seventh seal is open the
[32:26] third pole has made itself manifest the
[32:28] spoken word and squirrels have been
[32:30] created a storm has been rebuked the
[32:32] tumor's been rebuked
[32:34] young boys have been brought to the holy
[32:36] ghost
[32:37] all by the power that operated out of a
[32:40] man's mouth just spoke and it happened
[32:42] now you're back to genesis this is why
[32:44] we were saying last night it's
[32:45] redemption is all about restoring
[32:47] genesis
[32:49] hallelujah where god and man had an
[32:51] unfettered unbroken relationship
[32:55] to where adam was perfectly unconscious
[32:58] he just operated nature because he was
[33:01] the god of the earth oh friends your
[33:03] future is bright hallelujah
[33:06] this thing isn't accidental this thing
[33:08] has been precisionly planned
[33:11] and god has moved each step starting
[33:13] stopping pausing speeding up slowing
[33:15] down to do what now he lets man the best
[33:18] laid plans of mice and men it just comes
[33:21] to nothing
[33:23] only what god does stands
[33:26] and that's why his believers all the way
[33:28] from genesis have abandoned keeping up
[33:31] with the world they only want to know oh
[33:34] i want to know him more
[33:45] so so now he's
[33:48] he's been
[33:49] god has been governing time at the pace
[33:53] of prophecy
[33:54] he's been doing that all along since the
[33:56] dawn of time he's always done that all
[33:59] right now you can see
[34:01] that's god slowing it down and stopping
[34:04] it you can also see him hit the hit the
[34:06] throttle you see him hit the gas and
[34:08] accelerated because that's what you see
[34:11] happening under the fifth trumpet
[34:12] because what happens on the fifth
[34:14] trumpet is a star falls from heaven
[34:17] and comes down to the earth and he's got
[34:19] a special key to the bottomless pit and
[34:22] he's going to open up a prison where
[34:25] where these scorpion-like creatures with
[34:28] teeth and hair like women and stings in
[34:31] their tail and their and they're
[34:33] spiritual now they're going to be
[34:34] released into the earth and it's and
[34:36] brother branham takes that star in in in
[34:40] the book of revelation and he he in
[34:43] revelation 9 under the fifth trumpet and
[34:45] ties it back to isaiah 14
[34:48] how art thou fallen from heaven oh
[34:51] lucifer
[34:53] son of the morning
[34:55] so brother branham connects the two dots
[34:57] and so now we see
[34:59] that satan now because now you're
[35:01] getting global war now things are
[35:03] starting to heat up now we're coming
[35:04] into the 20th century it's getting time
[35:07] that you're coming up now the seventh
[35:08] age is just on the horizon hallelujah
[35:12] and god is moving god's moving all over
[35:15] the earth and they think it's politics
[35:17] nothing doing it's prophecy
[35:21] and so now satan is given a key to open
[35:24] a pit to release spirits he's in other
[35:26] words i'm going to give you a little
[35:27] temporary i'm going to give you a little
[35:28] extra juice lucifer go down here's some
[35:31] keys it's never been opened the world
[35:33] don't know what's coming but i need to
[35:35] bring it's got to go beyond nation
[35:38] rising against nation i got to bring a
[35:39] global affair i got to get the first woe
[35:42] second low third one i got to get this
[35:44] first wall started so here's some keys
[35:46] go down and open the pit
[35:51] and when he does
[35:53] and brother branham
[35:54] says here come these scorpions
[35:57] with stings in their tail
[35:59] these creatures that came out of the and
[36:01] they've got a king over them which is
[36:02] abaddon or a polygon
[36:04] and it's lucifer from isaiah 14.
[36:07] and and brother branham says he's it
[36:09] makes an interesting statement he says
[36:13] they've got hair
[36:15] like a woman
[36:17] to torment
[36:19] the women who cut theirs off
[36:22] now
[36:23] now
[36:24] now overlay these
[36:26] over late
[36:27] because where we are is we've come into
[36:29] the 20th century
[36:31] and now the first woe is about to break
[36:33] and and a first world war is going to
[36:35] start up and you know 14 15 years in
[36:38] it's going to start happening and
[36:39] they're going to assassinate a an
[36:42] austrian monarch and then the whole
[36:43] world and then this treaty and that
[36:45] treaty the whole thing is going to take
[36:46] off
[36:48] and now it's global war and so so when
[36:50] brother branham makes that statement
[36:53] you're understanding that it's right at
[36:54] the the first decade of the new century
[36:58] now if you go back historically
[37:00] the hair bob
[37:02] began in 1912.
[37:06] that's where historians tag it they say
[37:08] right there
[37:09] that that hollywood began with their
[37:12] with their picture shows they began to
[37:15] bob their hair their speakeasies right
[37:18] in 1912. now that's just uh that's just
[37:20] 30 24 to 36 months before the first woe
[37:23] gets underway world war one actually the
[37:25] one the the war the world wars aren't
[37:28] always correlated directly to the woes
[37:30] because the wall caused world war one
[37:32] just like
[37:33] the second will cause world war ii
[37:36] but world war ii ended in 1945 but the
[37:39] second woe doesn't until in the
[37:40] tribulation in revelation 12.
[37:42] see say how does that work well it's not
[37:44] hard because the the sons the the same
[37:47] men that were fighting in iwo jima in
[37:50] the late 1945 were fighting a few years
[37:53] later in korea and then their sons were
[37:55] fighting in vietnam and then their sons
[37:57] were in the gulf war and then their sons
[37:58] are in afghanistan and the world has
[38:00] never known peace
[38:03] why because it's still the effects and
[38:05] that's why in revelation 12 after they
[38:07] killed moses and elijah and the 144 000
[38:10] are all martyred the bible says that
[38:12] ends the second woe and the third woe
[38:14] cometh quickly oh my god's wrapping it
[38:16] up at that time
[38:19] you're still with me
[38:20] i'm trying to make it as clear as i can
[38:22] so you don't get lost in the shuffle
[38:24] and so so you find then that
[38:27] that harry here he comes and he's he's
[38:30] now he's going to hit the accelerator
[38:32] right satan take off down there and and
[38:34] he's going to release these creatures
[38:36] with hair like women to torment the
[38:39] women who cut theirs off in 1912 say
[38:42] how's he going to torment him in 1912 he
[38:44] don't he's not going to be in 1912 it's
[38:46] going to be a few years later when the
[38:48] first world war breaks out and you're
[38:50] going to have mothers and wives losing
[38:53] husbands and sons in a global war women
[38:57] all over the world are going to be
[39:00] tormented because they're losing their
[39:02] husbands they're losing their sons and
[39:04] whole generations are being wiped out
[39:06] it's god tormenting them because they
[39:09] cut their hair
[39:14] these things aren't accidents friends
[39:17] this stuff stacks up perfectly and
[39:18] beautifully we wouldn't know any of this
[39:20] if it wasn't for the message of the hour
[39:22] we'd be we'd be just as turned around as
[39:24] seventh-day adventists we wouldn't even
[39:26] understand what god is doing in the
[39:27] interval of time but i'm glad that our
[39:29] eyes see
[39:30] blessed are your eyes for they see it in
[39:32] your ears for they hear it
[39:35] hallelujah
[39:37] so now in that case god is hitting the
[39:39] accelerators bringing it on
[39:43] so
[39:45] this is why
[39:47] you know when when when when we look at
[39:49] what's happening i just said to my
[39:50] church recently
[39:52] you know you see what's happening in
[39:53] ukraine and i can tell you there's never
[39:55] been a time it's unprecedented and
[39:56] unparalleled the cooperation of western
[39:59] powers
[40:00] say oh well we've had it before not to
[40:02] this level
[40:03] every you read headlines causely men
[40:06] with with who who study that know that
[40:09] they're shocked and they're stunned and
[40:11] you know what's happening you know what
[40:13] vladimir is finding out
[40:16] putin
[40:17] you know he's finding out
[40:19] you can't fight the beast
[40:22] because the book of revelation prophecy
[40:24] doesn't matter what's happening here
[40:26] prophecy has already said that the beast
[40:29] brings
[40:29] the king of the north to heal
[40:32] the beast brings the whole world china's
[40:34] going to figure that out north korea is
[40:36] going to find that out radical islam is
[40:38] going to find that out you can't fight
[40:41] the beast who's already in control you
[40:43] know what's happening you know what
[40:44] russia's happening having happened right
[40:46] now that's going to come into full force
[40:48] when the bride is gone is you can't buy
[40:51] or sell except you're part of our
[40:53] program
[40:54] and we're just going to shut you down
[40:56] globally and financially because the the
[40:58] beast power rules by commerce
[41:02] hallelujah these things aren't an
[41:03] accident i don't know what's going to
[41:05] happen here
[41:06] in ukraine i don't know how that i've
[41:08] got no prophecy i've got no quotes to
[41:10] tell me what's going to happen in
[41:11] ukraine but i can tell you here what's
[41:14] happening is the world is plunging into
[41:16] a tribulation
[41:18] and the beast is gaining power and
[41:20] flexing its muscles that it's had for
[41:22] years only no one knew it was to that
[41:24] level
[41:26] oh precious friends think of the hour
[41:29] that you have arrived at you are the
[41:31] last generation you're the one upon whom
[41:33] the ends of the world have come
[41:41] see
[41:44] it's not going to matter what a
[41:46] what outcome
[41:47] happens in ukraine russia's learning a
[41:49] secret
[41:50] see and so now
[41:52] all right can i turn another corner
[41:55] i've only been 44 minutes you still with
[41:57] me
[41:58] all right
[42:00] if i see you blinking and starting to
[42:02] sway i'll have to stop so stay with me
[42:05] amen if you need to
[42:07] get awake and everybody is but if you
[42:09] find yourself sleeping get up and jump
[42:10] up down we'll think the spirit hits you
[42:12] and and people will rejoice
[42:15] amen
[42:17] so paul comes to the hebrew church
[42:21] to his own countrymen
[42:22] hebrews 6 and in through seven
[42:25] wearing god willing more bundling to
[42:27] show unto the heirs of promise the
[42:29] immutability of his counsel confirmed it
[42:30] by an oath that by two immutable things
[42:32] in which it was impossible for god to
[42:34] lie we might have a strong consolation
[42:36] who have fled for refuge to lay hold
[42:38] upon the hope set before us
[42:40] which hope we have as an anchor of the
[42:41] soul both sure and steadfast which
[42:43] entereth in
[42:44] into that within the veil whither the
[42:46] forerunner christ is entered for us even
[42:48] jesus
[42:49] made a high priest forever after the
[42:52] order of melchizedek he goes on into
[42:54] chapter seven it was
[42:56] chapters and verses were added hundreds
[42:57] of years later it's just a letter he's
[42:59] writing for this melchizedek king of
[43:01] salem priest of the most high god who
[43:03] met abraham returning from the slaughter
[43:05] of the kings and blessed him to whom
[43:06] also abraham gave a tenth part of all
[43:08] first being by interpretation king of
[43:10] righteousness and after that also king
[43:12] of salem which is king of peace without
[43:14] father without mother without dissent
[43:16] having neither beginning of days nor
[43:18] ending of life but made like unto the
[43:20] son of god abideth the priest
[43:21] continually now
[43:23] it's interesting because paul
[43:25] had had had broken down to them
[43:28] uh in the in the chapter just prior in
[43:31] hebrews 5
[43:33] paul had began to break down to them how
[43:35] that god was willing had been willing to
[43:38] lower himself down
[43:40] to become a temptable man so that god
[43:43] could feel what we feel so that he knows
[43:46] the struggles you have so that he can be
[43:48] a faithful high priest see
[43:50] and paul is trying to get them to
[43:52] understand that he he knows what you're
[43:54] going through he know i'm glad
[43:57] i'm glad he knows what i'm going through
[43:59] i'm glad he knows my frustrations
[44:03] amen
[44:04] at least half of which i probably
[44:06] brought on myself
[44:09] amen
[44:11] see but he knows
[44:13] see he's here to help me
[44:15] not destroy me i i love that that just
[44:17] rings through my soul you know just
[44:19] receive that today i don't know what
[44:21] your life is going through right now but
[44:23] i didn't promise you this he's here to
[44:24] help you
[44:26] he's not here to destroy you doesn't
[44:27] matter how sometimes the preaching can
[44:29] get really tight really hard and you can
[44:31] just really get rolled over by it but
[44:33] just believe this he's here to help you
[44:36] he's not here to harm you satan satan
[44:39] does does that to get you to feel like
[44:41] giving up
[44:43] that's why he does it he's a master at
[44:45] it he's a master psychologist
[44:49] so this is why our faith is in is in the
[44:51] word of god
[44:52] we can because we can see him in
[44:54] prophecy
[44:55] now i'm moving as rapidly as i can so
[44:58] brother branham comes now and he's going
[45:00] to he's going to bring us here about who
[45:03] is melchizedek because paul had said in
[45:05] the fifth chapter after he's trying to
[45:07] get him to understand their position in
[45:09] christ and he said look
[45:11] this whole thing about melchizedek man
[45:14] i've got a lot to tell you but wow are
[45:16] you ever dull of hearing
[45:18] and i i can't really bring it to you
[45:20] like because you're already starting to
[45:21] drift you're already starting to fall
[45:23] away and and and paul is trying to get
[45:25] him to say do you understand and he's
[45:27] going to go into chapter 6 and chapter 7
[45:30] do you understand how great this man was
[45:34] see
[45:35] so brother branham says here
[45:37] people say it was a priesthood that was
[45:38] a melchizedek priesthood he says that's
[45:40] the most likely they hold better to that
[45:42] side than they do the other because they
[45:44] say it was a priesthood brother iran
[45:45] says but it can't be that in other words
[45:47] just merely that
[45:49] for in the fourth verse it says he was a
[45:51] person
[45:52] he was a man see so in order to be a
[45:54] person he has to be a personality a man
[45:56] not a order but a person so he was not
[45:59] just a priesthood order neither was he a
[46:01] myth he was a person and now watch
[46:04] and the person
[46:06] is eternal
[46:07] and if you notice he had no father no
[46:09] mother no time he ever began no time he
[46:12] ever ended and i love this statement
[46:13] remember who he was he's still alive
[46:16] [Music]
[46:18] argue about are you all you want whoever
[46:20] he was he's still alive see
[46:23] see because the because he had no father
[46:25] mother beginning of day's ending of life
[46:27] so it would it would have to be an
[46:29] eternal person and so he says an eternal
[46:32] person see so it could only be one
[46:35] person
[46:36] that's god he's the only one that's
[46:39] eternal now watch him begin to break it
[46:41] down see
[46:43] i contend that he was god because he's
[46:45] the only person that can be immortal and
[46:47] now
[46:48] here's what's happening here's
[46:50] here's what paul
[46:52] was wearing over that that church was
[46:55] dull and couldn't quite grasp
[46:57] and you say how do you know what paul
[47:00] was weird over because i've got a
[47:01] prophet preaching the back half of it
[47:04] i've got a prophet in this message
[47:06] showing me what that age who fell away
[47:08] couldn't receive and didn't receive but
[47:10] we're receiving it see
[47:13] and he says
[47:15] he had to be immortal
[47:16] god
[47:18] changing himself into a person
[47:21] that's what he was no father mother
[47:23] beginning life reading of days the whole
[47:24] bible is the revelation of god the whole
[47:27] church is built upon the revelation of
[47:29] god there's no other way to know god
[47:32] only by revelation whom the son will
[47:34] reveal him see revelation is everything
[47:37] see and and but now remember revelation
[47:40] is not just the accumula accumulation of
[47:44] knowledge
[47:46] revelation is is faith that when god
[47:49] reveals himself to you
[47:51] you then surrender a part of you so that
[47:54] you can absorb that part of him and and
[47:57] you become him he became you so that you
[47:59] can become him
[48:00] now it's a revelation because it's a
[48:03] manifestation
[48:05] see
[48:07] now watch the opposite of it see the
[48:09] whole church is built upon it there's no
[48:11] other way to know god see watch
[48:14] to not accept the revelation
[48:17] then you're just a cold theologian and
[48:20] there's no hope for you
[48:22] see he's talking he's he's giving a
[48:24] testimony he's speak speaking to a
[48:26] minister who's trying to contend with
[48:27] him and he says but it's revelation the
[48:29] man says brother brother my brother
[48:31] branham i can't accept revelation he
[48:32] says then you cut yourself off from god
[48:35] there's no way how's god going to get to
[48:37] you if you don't accept that see the man
[48:39] is still thinking in the classical model
[48:41] he's still thinking about you know xyz
[48:44] and one two three he's still thinking of
[48:45] it in human terms and brother branham is
[48:48] in a completely different hemisphere
[48:49] going look it becomes a life a
[48:52] revelation is a living thing
[48:54] and it's that's why it changes your life
[48:56] into the image of god
[48:59] see
[49:00] that's that's the sign that you've been
[49:02] redeemed and born again your seed has
[49:04] been germanized because you start
[49:06] looking and acting like him
[49:09] see
[49:11] so he says if you don't receive that if
[49:13] you in other words if you don't receive
[49:14] the engrafted word if you don't let it
[49:16] become a part of your life then there's
[49:17] no hope for you you're just a cold
[49:18] theologian
[49:20] and he would probably be a better
[49:21] theologian than william brown
[49:24] but but they're going to have different
[49:25] destinies
[49:27] see
[49:28] so i thought there's nothing sadder than
[49:30] that you know it's one thing to have a
[49:32] doctor tell you you've got a disease and
[49:33] you're dying and there's no hope but my
[49:35] goodness to have a prophet tell you
[49:36] there's no hope for you
[49:38] see and so
[49:40] it was sad in brother branham's heart he
[49:41] wasn't trying to make the man feel bad
[49:43] you know it's just a true principle and
[49:45] an application and and that's why you
[49:47] can't become as i as i was saying last
[49:49] night and i say so again today you can't
[49:52] become satisfied by merely merely being
[49:56] by being filled with knowledge
[49:59] don't ever be satisfied because when you
[50:01] do that listen first of all the more
[50:04] knowledge you accrue
[50:05] the more culpable you become
[50:08] the more guilty you become
[50:10] the less chance you'll have at the
[50:12] throne at god's throne because to whom
[50:14] much is given much is required see
[50:18] so you never if you all you do is be
[50:20] filled with knowledge and you never come
[50:22] to life changing power that's why
[50:25] brother branham said satan don't really
[50:26] care how right you are in your doctrine
[50:29] that's really mattered him because he's
[50:30] got a military secret
[50:32] he's got a war secret that and a prophet
[50:35] told us devil got really mad he didn't
[50:36] want a prophet to tell you his secret
[50:39] but his secret the william branham
[50:40] discerned the heart of lucifer just like
[50:42] isaiah did and said isaiah said lucifer
[50:45] i know you
[50:46] you said in your heart i'll ascend
[50:48] mm-hmm and lucifer's like
[50:50] stop don't tell people that tell them
[50:52] i'm going to write it a book man i'll
[50:54] send it to the whole world this is
[50:56] exactly what you did
[50:58] and william branham comes along in this
[51:00] day and puts it on tape sends it around
[51:02] the world and now it's in the digital
[51:03] now it's in the stratosphere the satan
[51:05] will never be able to get it offline now
[51:07] that here's the secret satan don't care
[51:09] how religious you are
[51:10] he don't care how right you are in your
[51:12] doctrine he don't even care about that
[51:14] because what he knows is is if you miss
[51:17] the life you won't come up anyway
[51:22] see
[51:23] so when you refuse to allow the spirit
[51:26] to reveal himself further to you not
[51:28] knowledge but but but brother adam said
[51:31] you empty out and christ comes in the
[51:33] more you empty out the more he'll come
[51:35] in and fill up that place that's my goal
[51:38] that's why i live
[51:40] oh i want to know you more and the only
[51:42] way you can know him more is to is to
[51:44] get make less of you so you can have
[51:47] more of him
[51:49] see
[51:52] so you never
[51:54] when you don't do that you don't allow
[51:56] the spirit to reveal himself to you in
[51:58] that way
[51:59] you never become different you only
[52:01] become more religious you never really
[52:03] get more spiritual
[52:05] you're because you're you're never able
[52:07] to see now i'm coming to another corner
[52:10] you're never able to see
[52:13] your life that you're living here
[52:16] in real time
[52:17] you're never able to see your life
[52:20] blended
[52:22] into the mystery of god
[52:25] see
[52:26] that this is not just about doctrine
[52:28] that this is an unfolding this is an
[52:31] eternal being who expressed a family and
[52:34] put seed in his whole family so that he
[52:37] could redeem that seed all down through
[52:39] time and that's why you believe it
[52:41] because the seed gene inside of you is
[52:44] the exact same substance as this
[52:47] now it's not ink on paper it's a
[52:50] spiritual gene inside you but this ink
[52:52] on paper doesn't do you any good unless
[52:55] it gets inside and becomes a living book
[52:57] he's not coming to rapture your bible
[53:00] brother branham said when the books are
[53:01] closed for the last time the word will
[53:03] be flesh
[53:04] this is the third iteration of the bible
[53:07] the first one was in the stars the
[53:08] second one was enoch's pyramid this is
[53:10] the third one there's another one coming
[53:12] hallelujah it's in a body it's in a
[53:14] people
[53:16] who become the capstone they become the
[53:18] manifested word of the hour they come
[53:21] into his very image
[53:24] see
[53:27] so you're never able to see that your
[53:29] life really is here for that purpose
[53:31] it's to be blended in it's to begin to
[53:33] cooperate in a vision that god had of
[53:35] you long before you ever breathed there
[53:37] in the earth it's a mystery of god that
[53:40] is unfolding in your day and you're part
[53:42] of it now this is entanglement this is
[53:44] what i made mention of last night
[53:47] and i'm not going to go into it because
[53:49] science today there the more i study it
[53:52] the more disgusting it becomes because
[53:55] i see now why the bible says in their
[53:56] wisdom they became fools
[53:58] and they they they think they understand
[54:00] quantum mechanics although they're just
[54:02] as confused as anything and you try to
[54:05] follow their teaching and you'll see
[54:06] they're confused and they admit they're
[54:07] confused over it and even einstein
[54:10] missed it a million miles even albert
[54:11] einstein completely wrong
[54:14] and and and and you know you know you
[54:16] know you know how i understand quantum
[54:18] entanglement because i have a hillbilly
[54:20] prophet
[54:21] who put it in his language
[54:24] i have a bible that it's it speaks of it
[54:26] in the scripture i'm going to show you
[54:27] here just in a minute
[54:29] so
[54:30] so so when you find an entanglement at
[54:33] the quantum level
[54:34] you know there were three
[54:36] there were three and now it's like i say
[54:37] i'm not going to go into this deeply
[54:39] it's a
[54:40] fascinating subject i love studying
[54:41] physics but
[54:42] but there were three major
[54:45] advancements in physics in the 20th
[54:48] century of course one was you'd know as
[54:50] relativity einstein's special theory of
[54:53] relativity the second one was quantum
[54:55] mechanics and the third one was chaos
[54:58] theory
[54:59] and so we find that in the in the quan
[55:01] in the area of physics that we call
[55:03] quantum mechanics they talk about
[55:04] quantum entanglement
[55:06] where you have you know
[55:09] objects that are you you you take you
[55:12] take two objects at the quantum level
[55:14] and you and you entangle them
[55:17] and then they they actually share
[55:20] a new condition they become something
[55:23] different they be they share a new
[55:24] condition or state and and here now it
[55:27] was actually einstein that proved that's
[55:29] true
[55:30] but here's here was the whole conundrum
[55:32] of why they argued for decades and and
[55:35] albert einstein and his team he had two
[55:37] other scientists and then you had niels
[55:39] bohr who come on the scene and he was
[55:41] the counter to it ends up neal turned
[55:43] out to be right nils turned out to be
[55:44] right einstein turned out to be wrong
[55:46] and uh they didn't really couldn't prove
[55:48] that to 1964. i don't want to go let me
[55:51] let me just stop right there before i
[55:52] get into that but
[55:54] but
[55:55] but so we find that that they they found
[55:58] that they could take these two objects
[56:00] that were now entangled
[56:02] and they could they could see
[56:04] that when they were
[56:07] taken apart
[56:08] and you could actually send them in
[56:10] opposite directions for hundreds of
[56:12] light years that way and hundreds of
[56:13] light years that way and they were
[56:15] hundreds of light years apart and yet as
[56:18] soon as you observe one
[56:20] then then the then the superposition of
[56:23] the other snaps into place to match that
[56:26] one if this one is pointed up this one
[56:28] points down whatever this one does it's
[56:30] it's a it's it's a corresponding so
[56:33] whatever this one does there's a
[56:34] reaction in this one and and it doesn't
[56:37] happen over time it's instant
[56:41] it's instant as soon as as soon as this
[56:44] one moves this one moves
[56:45] i mean if i take my hand and i have the
[56:47] top and the bottom and i and i just do
[56:50] them like that now the bottom's on the
[56:52] on the top and the top is on the bottom
[56:53] but i've only got one hand
[56:55] i understand so so this is what blew
[56:59] einstein's mind and he he couldn't
[57:01] figure out how does the signal
[57:04] get from that one
[57:05] hundreds of light years and and einstein
[57:08] said it can't be instantaneous because
[57:11] that would mean that there's some and
[57:12] einstein called it a hidden force
[57:15] and he called it spooky action at a
[57:17] distance because he couldn't understand
[57:19] how does it instantly do that and
[57:21] they're hundreds and hundreds of light
[57:22] years apart and and and neil niels bohr
[57:25] would say albert you're just wrong
[57:28] you're just wrong that that it's not
[57:30] there's nothing spooky about it it's not
[57:33] it's not spooky action at a distance and
[57:35] there is no hidden force that what
[57:37] you're not realizing is they're the same
[57:39] thing
[57:42] now that blew out einstein's mind and
[57:44] why wouldn't it why wouldn't it because
[57:46] you've got two objects and you send them
[57:48] in opposite directions hundreds of light
[57:50] years away and einstein knew there's no
[57:52] way that that can be instant because his
[57:55] theory of relativity proved nothing can
[57:57] travel faster than the speed of light
[58:00] oh my
[58:01] but there's coming a world where the
[58:03] speed of light will be the slow lane
[58:06] speed of thought is infinitely faster
[58:09] than the speed of light
[58:11] because it doesn't matter it can take me
[58:13] 30 seconds to walk to that door but then
[58:15] it would take me probably three or four
[58:17] times that to walk to the road and it
[58:18] would take me months to walk to walk
[58:20] home but but it but but on that other
[58:23] side
[58:24] time and distance are a moot point it
[58:27] doesn't matter if it's 5 feet or 5
[58:30] million feet or 5 million light years of
[58:32] miles i'm there instantly all i do is
[58:35] think of it
[58:37] so i had time you can't look at it in
[58:40] the classical model and that's what
[58:41] einstein couldn't get his mind around
[58:43] and and boers would say
[58:45] there's no hidden action
[58:47] he said they only look like two separate
[58:49] things but they're he said well how are
[58:51] they not two separate things because
[58:53] they're entangled
[58:55] and this is this is what blows
[58:57] physicists mind well what does that even
[58:59] mean they're entangled and and he said
[59:01] albert there's no hidden force it's not
[59:04] anything happening at a distance that
[59:06] you're the problem you're having is
[59:08] you're looking at it as two separate
[59:10] things but once they're entangled at a
[59:12] quantum level they're no longer two
[59:15] they're one
[59:16] see so it didn't matter that god the
[59:19] father lived in the son and they were
[59:21] the same person
[59:23] and whatever the father did the son did
[59:25] likewise
[59:26] hallelujah they said it's two no it's
[59:28] not two say but he was a man sure he was
[59:31] a man but he was also god
[59:33] that's a paradox it's entanglement
[59:37] see
[59:41] and and einstein would he said he would
[59:42] say but they'd have these funny public
[59:44] debates and he'd say no he says god
[59:47] doesn't play with dice like that and and
[59:49] boer would reply through the media said
[59:51] somebody tell albert he needs to stop
[59:53] telling god what to do
[59:55] [Applause]
[1:00:00] because once they're entangled and now
[1:00:02] they're realizing only just now
[1:00:04] they're realizing that maybe they've
[1:00:06] misunderstood space entirely that maybe
[1:00:09] they don't understand space like they
[1:00:11] think they do
[1:00:12] see now i begin to they they they're
[1:00:16] beginning to understand that space
[1:00:18] might be this whole
[1:00:20] singular thing
[1:00:22] and that and that all nature might
[1:00:25] actually just be one singular thing all
[1:00:28] the way through the galaxies and all the
[1:00:30] way through the through the through the
[1:00:32] through the many multi multiverses and
[1:00:35] and and and they're they're going pow
[1:00:37] pow pow pow pow pow pow and i'm just
[1:00:39] opening a book and the prophet says
[1:00:41] all nature runs in perfect continuity
[1:00:46] i'm thinking boy you idiots you don't
[1:00:48] understand nothing
[1:00:50] why do you think all nature runs in con
[1:00:52] but brother branham would say he all
[1:00:54] nature brother branham would say of god
[1:00:56] he fills all time space and eternity
[1:00:59] and then he'll come over here and go but
[1:01:01] now he's not like the wind
[1:01:02] he's a being he lives in a house well
[1:01:04] how do i i mean but wait you how do you
[1:01:08] i mean if he feels all time but but he's
[1:01:10] not like the wind because it's
[1:01:12] expression
[1:01:13] it's the same god in the beginning was
[1:01:16] the word it actually was with him and it
[1:01:18] was him
[1:01:20] and and and that's why the the bible
[1:01:22] talks about the elected son being christ
[1:01:25] say well how did you get elected because
[1:01:27] i was in christ i said when did you get
[1:01:30] in him before the time before the world
[1:01:32] before anything before stardust i
[1:01:34] existed in god and that's why i'm a
[1:01:37] believer today because i mean i i bet
[1:01:40] you know the best way to get elements
[1:01:41] entangled is start them at the same time
[1:01:45] create them at the same time and when
[1:01:47] that logos came out of god you were in
[1:01:49] him when that logos came out of god i
[1:01:52] was in him all it had to do was go over
[1:01:55] time and overlay that with prophecy and
[1:01:57] it just walked down through the ages and
[1:01:59] brother branham said all the lives of
[1:02:02] all the people and all the bible is one
[1:02:04] goal one goal
[1:02:07] god with a family that he has expressed
[1:02:11] into the earth
[1:02:15] exactly
[1:02:18] that that's why when you go to ezekiel
[1:02:22] and you see his very first vision
[1:02:24] 30 years in
[1:02:26] and he sees a wheel in the middle of a
[1:02:28] wheel and he sees living creatures and
[1:02:30] they're all they're four but they're all
[1:02:32] one and they don't never turn they just
[1:02:35] always move forward they're always
[1:02:37] moving forward it doesn't matter they're
[1:02:39] always looking forward and when the when
[1:02:41] the wheels moved the creatures moved
[1:02:43] when the wheels lifted the creatures
[1:02:45] lifted that was entanglement it's right
[1:02:48] in the bible and science is blind to it
[1:02:52] that's why we're believers because we've
[1:02:54] been entangled with the mind of god so
[1:02:56] it doesn't matter that he's in heaven
[1:02:58] and that i'm in earth when god moves i
[1:03:01] move when god wills i will
[1:03:04] i as the father does so does the child
[1:03:09] this is what the holy ghost does it
[1:03:10] brings to life that gene of god inside
[1:03:14] you and that's the same life that was in
[1:03:16] the logos of god
[1:03:19] hallelujah you can't help but be a
[1:03:21] believer you can't help but forsake the
[1:03:23] world
[1:03:25] because that's your dna as brother diggs
[1:03:27] was saying that's the nature of what god
[1:03:29] put in you
[1:03:30] [Applause]
[1:03:36] see
[1:03:37] and so
[1:03:39] so they
[1:03:40] they didn't they couldn't even
[1:03:42] prove that they thought who is right
[1:03:45] for years is it einstein or is it bore
[1:03:49] is it
[1:03:50] is it according to einstein
[1:03:52] that well it's just already fixed that
[1:03:55] way or as boer would say does it snap
[1:03:58] into superposition as soon as you
[1:04:00] observe this one
[1:04:02] and they proved it was that because see
[1:04:06] when god
[1:04:07] is observed
[1:04:09] when god reveals himself to observation
[1:04:13] his bride his counterpart snaps into
[1:04:15] position
[1:04:17] and whatever he does she immediately
[1:04:20] snaps into position
[1:04:21] and wherever he goes she's immediately
[1:04:23] responding and it doesn't take her she
[1:04:25] doesn't have to go pray about it she
[1:04:26] doesn't have to fast 40 days for it it's
[1:04:28] something that happens it's a life
[1:04:30] inside her
[1:04:32] she can't help herself it moves her
[1:04:35] forward
[1:04:38] hallelujah
[1:04:41] and so so and then they they couldn't
[1:04:43] prove that until 1964. right at the time
[1:04:46] and brother branham is bringing shalom
[1:04:51] and brother branham now he comes to
[1:04:52] another thing and he starts talking
[1:04:55] about
[1:04:55] this symphony
[1:04:57] he's talking about a composer a
[1:04:59] conductor and
[1:05:00] you know you've got players who are
[1:05:02] we're the instruments we're playing the
[1:05:05] sheet music and god sent a conductor who
[1:05:07] was locked in with the composer who knew
[1:05:10] how the composer wanted it played and
[1:05:12] the composer and the conductor and the
[1:05:13] musicians and it's harmony and brother
[1:05:16] branham brother brennan would actually
[1:05:18] use this kind of language he would say
[1:05:20] music can be such that he said it can
[1:05:22] get so beautiful so real and brother
[1:05:25] branham said you just
[1:05:26] close your eyes and live in it
[1:05:30] you just live in it it moves you
[1:05:34] i mean music does that music wasn't in
[1:05:37] the creation music predates the creation
[1:05:40] there was already worship in heaven long
[1:05:42] before the earth was ever built
[1:05:43] you understand that's why music moves
[1:05:45] your body that's why you have to be
[1:05:46] careful what kind of music you listen to
[1:05:49] you'll find yourself moving and tapping
[1:05:51] what does that there's a there's an
[1:05:52] affinity between music and worship in
[1:05:55] your body
[1:05:57] see
[1:05:57] and so
[1:05:59] so we find that brother branham he
[1:06:00] begins to talk about this symphony and
[1:06:02] brother branham keeps it sounds like
[1:06:03] he's stumbling he says you know this the
[1:06:06] sympathy when you're when you're the
[1:06:08] sympathy of god and people are kind of
[1:06:10] going uh
[1:06:12] it's symphony and and
[1:06:14] and brother branham even fine as a man
[1:06:16] he finally goes he goes that's simp
[1:06:19] that's that's simple
[1:06:20] and he turns around and says am i saying
[1:06:22] that right
[1:06:24] symphony sympathy and and somebody says
[1:06:27] symphony symphony symphony right because
[1:06:30] that's what we are but
[1:06:32] sympathy is is what's happening to us
[1:06:36] the symp this the symphony is in
[1:06:39] sympathy with the composer
[1:06:43] and it's and it's a musical term called
[1:06:46] sympathetic resonance and and it happens
[1:06:49] but in fact is you can take
[1:06:51] musicians know this you can take a
[1:06:54] stringed instrument and you can bring
[1:06:56] another stringed instrument tune the
[1:06:57] same way and you pluck one string here
[1:07:00] and the sound energy
[1:07:02] will make this string over here vibrate
[1:07:03] you never touched it
[1:07:05] you see what i'm saying
[1:07:07] and and so so they so brother branham
[1:07:10] was actually he kept trying to say
[1:07:12] symphony and the holy ghost kept
[1:07:14] interrupting him saying sympathy
[1:07:17] sympathy in the symphony
[1:07:20] hallelujah and so so it it it you have
[1:07:23] all of these instruments and they don't
[1:07:25] they don't use it a whole lot anymore
[1:07:26] but back in the day they used it uh a a
[1:07:29] lot in fact his you find that that
[1:07:32] mozart uh he actually wrote a number of
[1:07:35] pieces for an instrument called
[1:07:37] the
[1:07:38] viola diamori
[1:07:40] and and and there and it was a precursor
[1:07:42] to some of the later inventions but what
[1:07:44] the biola it was just like a regular
[1:07:46] viola
[1:07:48] stringed instrument across the bridge
[1:07:49] moving down a fretboard but what
[1:07:51] happened was
[1:07:53] they drilled holes
[1:07:55] and so that
[1:07:56] with the with other guts of strings
[1:07:59] underneath through the holes that the
[1:08:01] sound would go through and vibrate the
[1:08:04] under so you had an over and under and
[1:08:06] mozart talked about how that it makes a
[1:08:09] a silvery velvety sound because what it
[1:08:11] does is it prolongs the sound decay so
[1:08:14] that instead of just
[1:08:15] boom
[1:08:17] it's boom
[1:08:21] it just keeps going once god said it the
[1:08:23] church just
[1:08:25] god said it
[1:08:27] and people say god said and people say
[1:08:29] what did he say
[1:08:32] you understand why what's wrong with
[1:08:33] your people
[1:08:35] [Applause]
[1:08:37] why are you acting like that i don't
[1:08:38] know something something's moving me son
[1:08:41] there's an invisible force and i can't
[1:08:43] resist it somebody's plucking on
[1:08:45] something and i'm having an effect by it
[1:08:48] because so it doesn't matter him in
[1:08:49] heaven and me on the earth when he
[1:08:51] strikes a cord i move
[1:08:53] whatever his will is is my will
[1:08:56] hallelujah
[1:08:58] this is the mystery that god has invited
[1:09:01] you into today to have fellowship with
[1:09:08] that's the mystery
[1:09:10] that you yeah and and they wrote all
[1:09:13] kinds of parts for it and
[1:09:15] even even the very famous madame
[1:09:17] butterfly and there she is and and and
[1:09:19] there's a scene where she's there with
[1:09:21] you know with cocaine and and they're
[1:09:24] waiting on the arrival of lieutenant
[1:09:25] pinkerton and all of a sudden in the
[1:09:27] back of viola diamore begins to play and
[1:09:31] what is it doing it's it's showing that
[1:09:34] there's some kind of commensurate
[1:09:36] there's some kind of love language
[1:09:38] moving in the air and her heart is ra is
[1:09:42] moving because he's coming and the
[1:09:44] anticipation and and she's already
[1:09:46] waiting and he hasn't even arrived
[1:09:48] because the music is causing it in her
[1:09:52] hallelujah there's music playing this is
[1:09:55] music to my ears
[1:09:59] they say i say turn on a tape they say
[1:10:00] oh kentucky hillbilly with broken
[1:10:02] english it's mozart
[1:10:04] it's music to me
[1:10:09] it's how i
[1:10:11] it's how i open this book
[1:10:14] and read between the lines
[1:10:17] i know what the line is saying anybody
[1:10:19] can read the line but i can read between
[1:10:22] the lines
[1:10:23] because i'm in a love affair
[1:10:26] doesn't matter
[1:10:28] oh it's a it's a dance
[1:10:30] of spirits and god comes down to his
[1:10:34] bride now how much does it mean to you
[1:10:36] to sing the song oh i want to know him
[1:10:39] more
[1:10:40] and he comes down and the dance begins
[1:10:43] and and and i'm not tripping over his
[1:10:46] feet and he's not stepping on my toes
[1:10:48] we're moving
[1:10:50] oh it's just a love affair and we love
[1:10:54] the lord and we worship him and our our
[1:10:58] life is holy and our minds are clean and
[1:11:01] our families are are moral and pure
[1:11:06] why because of this beautiful love
[1:11:08] affair that god started before the world
[1:11:11] began and you're here today to become
[1:11:14] that mystery hallelujah
[1:11:17] [Applause]
[1:11:21] and that's what's happening
[1:11:23] in our lives
[1:11:26] coming to this
[1:11:28] perfect
[1:11:29] realization
[1:11:32] from partial realization
[1:11:34] to a perfect realization so
[1:11:37] knowing then
[1:11:39] that the bible imagery of melchizedek
[1:11:43] knowing now that's why brother and say
[1:11:46] he became jesus christ
[1:11:48] see this is why this is how a prophet
[1:11:50] could say things like he fills all time
[1:11:52] space and eternity but he is a being
[1:11:54] he's not like the wind he prophet could
[1:11:56] say you know he's the beginning of the
[1:11:58] creation of god you're the continuation
[1:12:03] of that same creation no he's not it's
[1:12:06] not two god and the father and the son
[1:12:09] weren't two they were the same and and
[1:12:12] that's what science is finally starting
[1:12:14] to realize maybe we've been looking at
[1:12:16] it all wrong
[1:12:18] if they just listen to a prophet all the
[1:12:20] way back into the 50s they wouldn't have
[1:12:22] to spend billions of dollars on research
[1:12:24] they wouldn't have had to have
[1:12:25] decades-long grants and scientists from
[1:12:27] all over the world trying to prove what
[1:12:28] we already know right in the bible
[1:12:31] thank god
[1:12:32] we see these things friends
[1:12:35] and so this mystery that's that that
[1:12:38] that had been unfolding since god began
[1:12:40] to build back his vision
[1:12:42] in the garden of eden and how it would
[1:12:45] unfold
[1:12:46] down to this very ah this very hour how
[1:12:49] that he would he would work all sides
[1:12:52] he'd work all sides he had a he had
[1:12:55] plotted a solution for for the jews
[1:12:59] under the trumpets and he plotted a
[1:13:01] completely different redemption solution
[1:13:03] for the gentiles under the seals
[1:13:06] and he's working both sides of it that's
[1:13:08] what you've been seeing happen that's
[1:13:10] what happened that's what happened in
[1:13:11] the interval right right at the time
[1:13:13] he's stopping
[1:13:15] he's stopping world war one right at the
[1:13:17] time when when because when the when
[1:13:19] when the devil released those special
[1:13:22] demons and got that kind of a jump on on
[1:13:25] the world then because the bible made a
[1:13:27] promise that when the enemy comes in
[1:13:30] like a flood god will raise a standard
[1:13:32] against him and so right as god hands
[1:13:35] satan the keys and says go down and open
[1:13:37] your pit god comes over here and grabs a
[1:13:39] hold of lake and parnum and grabs a hold
[1:13:41] of seymour and starts a pentecostal
[1:13:43] revival in 1906.
[1:13:45] why because satan's been given keys and
[1:13:47] the church is going to be given some
[1:13:49] keys because god is always there to see
[1:13:51] you through
[1:13:53] so it doesn't matter what's happening in
[1:13:54] the ukraine or around the world i mean
[1:13:56] it matters but i'm just saying no don't
[1:13:58] be in fear god is here god is on the
[1:14:01] scene god is in control of these things
[1:14:06] right in the time
[1:14:08] he's allowing under the trumpets here
[1:14:09] comes the sixth trumpet and
[1:14:12] here here's demons release from
[1:14:13] euphrates
[1:14:15] right away you see him going after
[1:14:17] eichmann and hitler right away because
[1:14:18] world war one took him out of the
[1:14:20] control of the ottoman empire world war
[1:14:22] ii has got to drive him out of central
[1:14:24] europe he's got to get him home
[1:14:26] see
[1:14:26] i mean why right there in the first part
[1:14:29] of the 20th century
[1:14:31] right when the first woe
[1:14:33] is moving and nations are starting to
[1:14:36] rattle their swords
[1:14:38] god's over here
[1:14:40] in a tree
[1:14:41] speaking to a young boy
[1:14:43] and he says now
[1:14:45] don't worry about that
[1:14:46] just don't defile your body in any way
[1:14:49] when you get older don't worry about
[1:14:51] this i got this when you get older i got
[1:14:53] to work for you to do and as you see god
[1:14:57] is moving all sides of it the whole
[1:14:59] thing friends that's why i kept telling
[1:15:00] you god is not worried god's not worried
[1:15:03] about this
[1:15:04] god's worried about this
[1:15:06] this is why brother branham would always
[1:15:08] add uncertainty in his in his time
[1:15:10] predictions and he would say now i could
[1:15:13] miss it 50 years i could miss it a
[1:15:15] hundred years but say what did he know
[1:15:17] what he did know was what this said what
[1:15:20] he did know is this has always come to
[1:15:23] pass and it's coming to pass and it
[1:15:25] always will come to pass
[1:15:27] see and that's the confidence so here he
[1:15:29] is and and he's he's working both sides
[1:15:32] together and you know what he's doing
[1:15:34] he's taking all the time that he needs
[1:15:37] to take
[1:15:43] now let me just come to my last corner
[1:15:45] this might have just ended up in the
[1:15:46] four corner building i'm on my last one
[1:15:49] you got 10 more minutes
[1:15:52] i want to make this mean
[1:15:54] more to you
[1:15:55] than just an increase of understanding
[1:15:58] because i want to put this down where
[1:16:00] you live and i want to put it in real
[1:16:01] time and stitch it into the very fabric
[1:16:03] of what you're facing on a daily basis
[1:16:06] that's what preaching is designed to do
[1:16:08] we're not here just to you know have a
[1:16:10] have a wonderful rally of of
[1:16:12] understanding it is stimulation and it
[1:16:15] does stimulate and we do get excited and
[1:16:17] i love it and you're lucky i didn't blow
[1:16:18] through the roof already
[1:16:20] but i'm here to tell you i want to know
[1:16:22] i want to know this god
[1:16:24] now that i see him in all his glory i
[1:16:26] was coming to church i was driving
[1:16:27] across coming through the country and i
[1:16:29] said lord i'm just humbling myself again
[1:16:32] because lord
[1:16:34] let it be inspiring i remember sitting
[1:16:36] as a young man and and ministers my
[1:16:39] elders from years gone by and how they
[1:16:41] preached these these things and inspired
[1:16:44] me and my young heart would just burn
[1:16:46] and i want your young hearts young
[1:16:47] people i want you to burn i want you to
[1:16:50] realize mom and dad haven't fed you
[1:16:52] cunningly devised tales this is real
[1:16:56] and it's provable and you overlay
[1:16:58] history with this and it fits perfect
[1:17:02] it hits exactly you take the take the
[1:17:04] most cutting edge science you're not
[1:17:06] going to get more cutting edge than than
[1:17:07] quantum mechanics and take all that they
[1:17:09] think they know and overlay it with this
[1:17:11] and it suddenly starts making perfect
[1:17:13] sense
[1:17:14] and now i see now i see how that it's
[1:17:17] all expression and it's god unfolding
[1:17:19] himself into a family
[1:17:22] so we find out friends that
[1:17:26] that when the dead in christ rise
[1:17:29] this bride's catching away
[1:17:32] occurs
[1:17:34] i want you to take some confidence here
[1:17:37] it will not come
[1:17:39] one day
[1:17:41] late
[1:17:42] and it will not come one day
[1:17:45] early
[1:17:46] i don't care where your station is or
[1:17:49] what you got going on i'm here to tell
[1:17:51] you that you are locked into a mystery
[1:17:53] that you can't get out of
[1:17:55] and this thing is translating you and
[1:17:57] transforming you and i'm here to tell
[1:17:59] you i want to give you this piece of
[1:18:00] news according to the bible and you can
[1:18:02] take courage and run with it god is
[1:18:05] doing more in you than you know
[1:18:08] he's doing more in your children he's
[1:18:10] doing more in your family he's doing
[1:18:12] more in your life than you're even aware
[1:18:15] of
[1:18:16] hallelujah and i'm here to tell you when
[1:18:18] he does it it'll be right on
[1:18:21] time
[1:18:23] he's on time
[1:18:25] every time
[1:18:26] all the time even satan right here in
[1:18:29] his zenith of power and his zenith of
[1:18:32] influence of the world he can't stop it
[1:18:36] i you know here's what i love telling
[1:18:37] the devil when he comes to try to he
[1:18:39] already knows he can't stop god so you
[1:18:42] know he'll come after you remember how
[1:18:43] brother branham said he said now satan
[1:18:46] couldn't tell me so when he started
[1:18:47] talking to me he said he couldn't tell
[1:18:48] me there was no god
[1:18:50] because i'd already met him
[1:18:53] he said but what he told me was he don't
[1:18:56] care about you
[1:18:58] oh there's a god but
[1:19:00] he don't care about you
[1:19:02] if he cared about you why is your wife
[1:19:04] laying down there a cold stiff laying in
[1:19:07] the morgan your baby
[1:19:08] and you're begging god for her life and
[1:19:10] god drops a black sheep down as if to
[1:19:12] say shut up i don't even want to talk to
[1:19:14] you
[1:19:15] and you said he could heal cancer
[1:19:18] and the whole town thinks you're crazy
[1:19:20] and nobody will have anything to do with
[1:19:21] you and he said i was i was crazy
[1:19:24] and he said i'd give my whole life and
[1:19:25] he said i thought well if he if he can't
[1:19:28] he said that's right that's right that's
[1:19:29] right he's starting to agree now satan's
[1:19:31] got him he's moving this is the prophet
[1:19:33] of god and he's already going down the
[1:19:35] path of reasoning like eve and he says
[1:19:37] he says that's right he said i was about
[1:19:39] to say well if he can't then i'll just
[1:19:42] he said i was about to say then i'll
[1:19:43] quit and he said that's right and if he
[1:19:45] can't do it then i'll
[1:19:50] and he said something held
[1:19:51] [Applause]
[1:19:53] something was holding
[1:19:54] something was inside wouldn't let him
[1:19:57] cross that line
[1:19:59] and he just kissed her and he said
[1:20:01] sherry honey daddy wanted to raise you
[1:20:03] but the angels are coming to pack you
[1:20:05] i'll bury you with mama and on that
[1:20:07] morning i'll see you baby i'll see you
[1:20:09] again because because i get all back
[1:20:12] everything i ever loved
[1:20:15] hallelujah
[1:20:16] and god's intention friends is to have a
[1:20:19] bride ready to take a flight and i'm
[1:20:21] here to tell you something friends
[1:20:22] brother john we're not going to miss
[1:20:24] this flight this flight ain't going to
[1:20:26] get delayed this flight ain't going to
[1:20:28] get canceled it doesn't matter what the
[1:20:30] storms of life happen it doesn't matter
[1:20:33] what's happening in the middle east or
[1:20:35] europe or america or the white house or
[1:20:38] the kremlin or the vatican this flight
[1:20:40] is leaving
[1:20:42] [Music]
[1:20:44] and i'm going to be honest say how do
[1:20:46] you know i'm already on it
[1:20:48] say but what if you wait too late it's
[1:20:51] already too late for the devil
[1:20:54] i tell him that i love telling him all
[1:20:55] the time satan you're already too late
[1:20:58] he comes in he tries to wear you tries
[1:21:00] to fake you out tries to lie to you
[1:21:02] tries to tell you if if god loved you
[1:21:04] this wouldn't happen if you loved god
[1:21:05] you wouldn't have done this oh just put
[1:21:07] him in his place friends and say it's
[1:21:10] already too late
[1:21:12] i've already been impregnated by the
[1:21:14] word i've already got faith rising up
[1:21:18] out of my heart
[1:21:22] my soul
[1:21:23] has already crossed over
[1:21:26] into its eternal day
[1:21:28] sitting together in heavenly places
[1:21:31] in christ jesus that's why that's why
[1:21:33] it's impossible for someone born again
[1:21:35] to backslide
[1:21:37] now you might go off
[1:21:39] and
[1:21:40] defile yourself and embarrass yourself
[1:21:42] and and and god have to come with a rod
[1:21:45] of correction and whip you back into
[1:21:47] shape because good parents do that
[1:21:50] but you but you but you understand that
[1:21:52] that once you pass from death to life
[1:21:55] and that soul is in his eternal realm
[1:21:57] then brother branham said that they're
[1:21:58] in that eternal realm there was no
[1:22:01] there's no today there's no tomorrow
[1:22:04] there's no yesterday it's just all right
[1:22:07] now so once you've passed from death to
[1:22:09] life and you're already in that eternal
[1:22:12] realm you you can't go back because
[1:22:16] there is no back
[1:22:19] there is no back you're just present
[1:22:22] with god right now i must go forward
[1:22:26] stumble sure you stumble sure you do you
[1:22:29] stumble preacher do the preacher stumble
[1:22:31] of course we do we're just like elijah
[1:22:34] we have our ups and downs that's what a
[1:22:36] prophet said we're we're men of like
[1:22:38] passions as the bible said elijah was a
[1:22:40] man of like passions brother branham
[1:22:42] said that many had his ups and downs but
[1:22:44] i'm here to tell you something friends

[1:23:01] knees say oh but but brother brown

[1:23:28] free from them say oh i gotta i gotta

[1:29:00] the fellowship of the mystery
[1:29:02] i think we
[1:29:04] you didn't know it some of you but you
[1:29:06] passed into the eternal
[1:29:08] dimension this morning you can't think
[1:29:11] about things the way you thought of them
[1:29:12] before you can't think about anything
[1:29:15] the way you thought before and you
[1:29:16] certainly can't think of things through
[1:29:18] the filter of the wisdom of this world
[1:29:22] it's a whole different ball game
[1:29:25] hallelujah i appreciate the word today
[1:29:26] and i
[1:29:28] i have a bunch of things written down
[1:29:29] but i'm just going to leave it i know
[1:29:30] we're going to pray for a brother here
[1:29:33] and whoever else wants to be anointed
[1:29:35] with oil
[1:29:35] [Music]
[1:29:37] but i will say just a couple things that
[1:29:40] i'd say quickly
[1:29:42] [Music]
[1:29:44] and i was saying that something keeps
[1:29:45] holding me brother kenny
[1:29:48] help me believe something's key
[1:29:52] is anybody this morning if you maybe you
[1:29:54] just had this thought because i'm just
[1:29:57] trying to give my thoughts is that wow i
[1:29:59] i'm
[1:30:01] i'm
[1:30:02] i feel like my mind's just getting a
[1:30:04] little behind
[1:30:05] [Music]
[1:30:07] there's just so much
[1:30:08] how many thought that
[1:30:11] i feel like my mind's just uh
[1:30:13] can't catch it all
[1:30:15] and i can tell you your soul's catching
[1:30:17] all of it
[1:30:20] if you're a believer your soul is
[1:30:21] catching all of it
[1:30:23] can you say man
[1:30:25] and there might be someone who says my i
[1:30:27] just really realized this morning i need
[1:30:29] to read my bible i need to read the book
[1:30:31] of revelation i'll encourage you to do
[1:30:32] that
[1:30:34] those are
[1:30:35] your bible's got dust at home
[1:30:37] shame on you
[1:30:39] you need to read your bible you need to
[1:30:40] book the read the book of revelations
[1:30:42] and if you're not in this message you
[1:30:43] need to be in this message it's people
[1:30:45] still around the message and even
[1:30:47] sometimes younger haven't even listened
[1:30:48] to the seals yet and you say well i'm
[1:30:50] too busy if you're too busy for that
[1:30:52] you're too busy
[1:30:53] [Music]
[1:30:56] get your bible and read it because
[1:30:59] you'll understand more what's being said
[1:31:02] this morning
[1:31:03] that have come together more but that
[1:31:05] being laid aside your soul's not missing
[1:31:07] anything
[1:31:08] your soul's catching it can you say amen
[1:31:11] praise the lord one of the things i
[1:31:12] enjoyed he said is a pastor i see this
[1:31:14] because you're looking at people's lives
[1:31:16] you're looking at your own
[1:31:17] sometimes
[1:31:20] it's the breakdown is if you just have
[1:31:22] knowledge of the message
[1:31:24] the breakdown is that you're not able to
[1:31:26] blend it together with your everyday
[1:31:27] life
[1:31:29] and that's the downfall religion and
[1:31:31] knowledge
[1:31:32] will actually separate
[1:31:36] this mystery this we go to church and
[1:31:38] hear about the mystery but separate from
[1:31:40] your everyday life what's going to
[1:31:41] happen tomorrow in your life that's the
[1:31:43] trap of the enemy
[1:31:44] and actually for 2 000 years of religion
[1:31:46] the religious organized church they
[1:31:49] actually separate the human being
[1:31:51] because they don't know the mystery so
[1:31:52] they separate they make you a separate
[1:31:54] individual a separate entity than god
[1:31:56] that's been the trap
[1:31:58] because if you think it's a separate
[1:32:00] thing you say well i'm worshiping god
[1:32:01] i'm trying to get to god they even had a
[1:32:03] few years ago a little bracelet you wore
[1:32:05] from the denominations what would jesus
[1:32:07] do so it's still about whatever he did
[1:32:09] you see in the bible you duplicate it
[1:32:11] and you'll be fine this this this has
[1:32:13] nothing to do with trying to be some
[1:32:15] this is we're of the same thing
[1:32:18] we're of the same material
[1:32:20] something down here is that's why those
[1:32:22] two separate entities or whatever he
[1:32:24] called them he's he's uh he knows the
[1:32:27] terms but they're separated and they're
[1:32:28] acting the same and yet they're separate
[1:32:30] it's because they're made of the same

[1:32:41] what i've heard today anchored in my
[1:32:43] soul
[1:32:44] and let it not stop there
[1:32:47] but let it be blended into my everyday
[1:32:49] life the decisions i've got to make for
[1:32:51] jobs the decisions i've got to make for
[1:32:53] my family the order for my family if i'm
[1:32:56] i've got some habit in my life that i
[1:32:58] haven't laid down let this mystery
[1:33:00] affect my life every day let it be
[1:33:03] blended
[1:33:04] let us step out of just carnality into
[1:33:07] this eternal time zone that we can be
[1:33:09] the people that god wants us to be in
[1:33:11] these closing seconds of time
[1:33:14] be the people something keeps holding me
[1:33:19] those who want prayer make your way
