[0:40] now I'm so filled with fear
[0:44] that I can barely move

[1:16] somehow your promises

[2:26] Hearts
[2:27] the sea he's promised he's gonna make
[2:33] a way
[2:36] for me
[2:37] [Music]
[2:38] so this is the truth I'm standing on
[2:43] even when all my strength is gone you
[2:48] are faithful forever Lord I know you'll
[2:51] never let me fall you'll never let me
[2:55] fall right now I'm
[2:58] I'm choosing to believe that someday
[3:01] sooner I'll look back and see all the
[3:05] pain had a purpose
[3:07] your plans be perfect all along
[3:11] this is the truth I'm standing on
[3:16] cause you are my rock my shield my firm
[3:21] foundation I know I will not be shaking
[3:26] this is where my help
[3:29] comes from
[3:33] this is the truth I'm standing on even
[3:38] when all my strength is gone you are
[3:42] faithful forever I know you'll never let
[3:46] me fall oh
[3:52] to believe
[3:54] someday soon I'll look back and see all
[3:58] the pain had a purpose your plan was
[4:01] perfect all alone this is the truth I'm
[4:06] standing on
[4:12] 13 verse 31
[4:15] therefore when he was gone out and he's
[4:18] speaking of Judas when he left the room
[4:19] when Judas went out Jesus said now
[4:23] is the son of man glorified and God is
[4:26] glorified in him if God be glorified in
[4:29] him God should also God shall also
[4:33] glorify him in himself and shall
[4:35] straightway glorify him
[4:38] um it's a it's a couple of mysterious
[4:40] scriptures and for years you read these
[4:42] things and you try to ponder them and
[4:45] you look at them and as you grow in the
[4:46] Lord they become more and more clear but
[4:48] it's always been puzzling to me just how
[4:50] all that is worded we know we know Jesus
[4:53] gave glory to the father we know Jesus
[4:55] gave glory to God in his life he always
[4:57] glorified God but then now he says now
[5:00] the he's asking the father to come and
[5:01] glorify him and so he goes on if you
[5:04] skip over to John 17 he's speaking of
[5:07] the same thing when he says in John 17
[5:10] and verse 1 and 2 these words spake
[5:12] Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven
[5:15] and said father the hour is come glorify
[5:18] thy son that thy son Also may glorify
[5:21] thee so he's echoing this again as thou
[5:25] Hast given him Power Over All Flesh that
[5:29] he should give eternal life to as many
[5:32] as thou has given him and this is
[5:35] eternal life that they may Know Thee the
[5:37] only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou
[5:39] has sent so this glorifying of the son
[5:42] is related to giving eternal life to as
[5:45] many as outgiven him remember last
[5:47] Sunday
[5:48] eternal life is living for others and
[5:50] when Jesus said that Greater Works will
[5:53] you do he said to the church The Works
[5:55] that I'm doing you will do also
[5:57] Everything Jesus is doing he can repeat
[5:59] through his body
[6:01] but then he says greater works for you
[6:03] do when we found out last Sunday what's
[6:05] Greater Works than all the miracle signs
[6:07] and wonders that Jesus did he said the
[6:09] greater work is not somebody's healed of
[6:11] cancer or something the Greater Works is
[6:13] that you have the power to impart
[6:15] eternal life to someone else because
[6:17] having eternal life is greater than
[6:19] physically being healed temporarily
[6:21] the church has power to do that
[6:24] Jesus said it amen so then he's in the
[6:26] subject of being glorified and the last
[6:28] one is John 17 if you wouldn't mind in
[6:30] verse 21.
[6:32] he says that they all may be one as thou
[6:36] father art in me he's praying for the
[6:38] church here his Believers before he
[6:40] leaves that they all may be one as thou
[6:43] father art in me and I in thee that they
[6:46] may also may be one in us that the world
[6:49] may believe that the thou has sent me
[6:52] and the glory which thou gavest me I
[6:55] have given them that they may be one
[6:58] even as we are one so now the next step
[7:01] is that the Glo he had the glory of the
[7:05] of the of God in his life and now he
[7:08] says Lord the glory that we have and the
[7:11] Oneness that we have I want them to have
[7:13] that Glory too in them
[7:16] so now I in them verse 23 and thou and
[7:19] me that they may be perfect in one and
[7:22] that the world may know that thou has
[7:25] sent me and has loved them as thou has
[7:27] loved me when this Glory comes it will
[7:30] bring true Oneness when this Glory comes
[7:34] in the church
[7:36] it will bring true Oneness
[7:39] and remember it's not a one-night event
[7:41] because
[7:43] Paul says we are changed from glory to
[7:46] glory to glory and the more Glory we get
[7:50] the more one we should become I feel the
[7:53] Lord leading me to go into relationships
[7:54] a little bit and talk about them but I
[7:56] have probably more questions than I have
[7:58] answers right now in talking about
[8:00] relationships I think it's a very
[8:02] important subject I think that we can't
[8:04] talk about it enough and so when we
[8:07] talked about those the Betrayal that
[8:09] Jesus experienced then we realize that
[8:11] we experience betrayal as well and the
[8:13] effect that it has on human beings is
[8:16] really pretty strong sometimes when we
[8:18] are betrayed when we are abandoned when
[8:21] we are neglected sometimes it happens
[8:23] when we're children in fact most of the
[8:25] time it happens when we're children you
[8:26] know we can have the best of parents but
[8:28] no parent is perfect and parents have
[8:30] different issues and different things
[8:32] they're learning as they go along but
[8:34] then you have the extreme situations
[8:35] where a child was actually abandoned a
[8:37] child was neglected and these have a a
[8:41] long-term effect on human beings we
[8:45] don't deal with betrayal very well we
[8:47] don't do deal with abandonment very well
[8:49] so when we we when we come into that I
[8:52] wanted to learn from Jesus life as he
[8:54] come to the final hours of his life I
[8:57] was looking at Jesus and how he reacted
[8:59] to betrayal because as I said there's no
[9:01] man that's ever been betrayed like Jesus
[9:04] was there's no man who has lost his
[9:06] friends like Jesus was at the end in the
[9:09] time when he needed friends in the time
[9:10] he needed support in the time he needed
[9:13] commitment from his disciples in the
[9:15] time that he needed his friends the most
[9:17] that's when they all abandoned him his
[9:19] closest friends even Peter James and
[9:21] John who who trusted many times as being
[9:24] exclusive to bring in a room to pray for
[9:26] a dead man or a dead girl and raise him
[9:29] to life he had he had close friendships
[9:31] with these men and when the end when it
[9:33] was all said and done there was a
[9:34] betrayal of every one of they all
[9:36] forsook him they all left him and some
[9:38] of them screaming out in their loyalty
[9:40] to him I would never leave you Jesus I
[9:42] would never leave you and he said Peter
[9:44] before the crows you'll deny me
[9:46] three times and so human energy and
[9:49] human commitment wasn't enough and so
[9:51] the loneliness that he experienced the
[9:53] Betrayal I feel I feel oh Lord Is it
[9:56] true that you ended your life and come
[9:58] to the end with no one there you were
[10:00] completely alone is it to my heart but
[10:02] just rejoices in the Lord and goes out
[10:04] to the Lord today that he would
[10:06] experience that but don't forget our
[10:09] Lord had to experience everything that
[10:11] we experienced
[10:13] our Lord had to go through every
[10:15] Temptation that we're tempted by the
[10:18] Bible said he was tempted at all points
[10:20] as we are and tempted by a sexual lust
[10:23] tempted by all the things we think well
[10:25] Jesus never experienced that no in order
[10:27] to be a high priest he had to go through
[10:29] everything people say well why do you
[10:31] have to be born a baby and go through
[10:32] the teenage years why didn't why
[10:34] couldn't he just come as a lamb at 33
[10:36] years old old and go right to Calvary
[10:38] because he had to be born a baby and go
[10:41] through every life situation go through
[10:43] his teenage years so that when you go to
[10:46] pray he understands what you're going
[10:48] through when a teenager is lonely and
[10:51] crying out to God he understands because
[10:53] he was a teenager as well our Lord had
[10:56] to be the right he was a Kinsmen
[10:58] Redeemer Redeemer but he had to be a
[11:00] right faithful high priest who had lived
[11:03] out every area of your life can somebody
[11:05] say Amen can somebody raise your hand
[11:07] and say my Lord went through every
[11:09] season of life
[11:11] that's why I love him so much can you
[11:13] say Amen but betrayal he went through
[11:16] betrayal and being abandoned and he went
[11:18] through loneliness more than any other
[11:20] human being has ever went through before
[11:22] and he didn't deserve that he didn't
[11:24] deserve to lose his friends but you see
[11:26] Jesus I'm watching him because he did
[11:29] not get into these mully grubs of this
[11:31] victim mentality he didn't close himself
[11:33] off he didn't say I'm finished with
[11:36] everybody he said he didn't say I'm not
[11:38] going to Calvary and he had the choice
[11:40] to leave it all and say I can't believe
[11:43] I've been abandoned I'm going to go live
[11:45] my own life he had the choice and yet
[11:47] when he was abandoned and betrayed he
[11:50] made the decision to head straight
[11:52] towards Calvary
[11:55] I'm learning something from his life
[11:58] that he didn't become a victim mentality
[12:01] even though he was falsely accused
[12:05] he said I'm not going to let this get to
[12:07] me because I understand why they're
[12:10] doing this maybe he doesn't understand
[12:11] all of it but he had to understand I see
[12:13] this I see the big picture and it's
[12:16] amazing to me I've got to finish in this
[12:17] area but he says it's amazing to me to
[12:21] see Jesus came into something that not
[12:24] only endured the mistreatment of the
[12:27] Betrayal and the mistreatment of Judas
[12:29] and the mistreatment of his own
[12:31] disciples but he kept walking towards
[12:35] the sacrifice and death that would
[12:38] correct the core problem in human beings
[12:44] all right I thought I'd need to say that
[12:47] one again Jesus made the choice in that
[12:51] betrayal to keep walking towards the
[12:53] sacrifice now I'm going to preach about
[12:55] relationships you better be listening
[12:58] real close
[12:59] Jesus when he was betrayed made the
[13:02] choice to walk towards sacrifice
[13:06] and a death to himself that would
[13:08] correct the core problem that's in human
[13:11] beings and any other choice wouldn't
[13:14] have been the victory
[13:16] and the freedom that we sang about this
[13:18] morning
[13:19] freedom to worship freedom to dance you
[13:23] can't even do that or sing that unless
[13:25] he went to Calvary for you can I get an
[13:27] amen this morning unless some you
[13:30] couldn't even come back into
[13:31] relationship with God to talk to him
[13:34] this morning unless somebody made a
[13:36] sacrifice for your life unless somebody
[13:39] said I'm headed to Calvary anyway I'm
[13:41] gonna do it alone but for the future of
[13:44] these people for the future of
[13:45] relationship I'm going to go the hard
[13:47] way I'm going to go the Via Dolorosa I'm
[13:50] gonna go to Calvary I'm going to go to
[13:52] the death because I know that will be
[13:54] their victory over this betraying spirit
[14:00] over this thing that says I'm going to
[14:03] deny you I'm going to put my wall up I'm
[14:05] going to become an island I'm going to
[14:07] go by myself
[14:08] Jesus said the only way to solve that is
[14:12] to go to Calvary and sacrifice so that I
[14:16] break down the middle wall of partition
[14:20] between man and God
[14:23] you talk about walls up
[14:26] people had a wall towards God
[14:28] and God had a wall towards them
[14:32] he did yeah because you and sin
[14:35] you're born in sin you're unacceptable
[14:38] to God but I did so much and I gave so
[14:41] much to the United Way without Calvary
[14:43] in the blood you're unacceptable to God
[14:47] it's not your good works that make you a
[14:49] Christian
[14:51] and so to break down the middle wall of
[14:54] partition to Break Down The Walls
[14:56] between God and man there had to be a
[14:59] sacrifice made you'll never have better
[15:02] relationships until sacrifices are made
[15:04] until humility comes in to restore the
[15:08] relationship with God Lost In the Garden
[15:10] of Eden and to restore Oneness and
[15:11] relationship between God and man to
[15:14] bring back ultimate Oneness which is
[15:16] what Jesus is speaking him and the
[15:18] father were one and he says I pray that
[15:21] they would become with us as we are one
[15:23] and then I pray that they would become
[15:25] one with one another now this is a
[15:27] prayer over the church before he left
[15:29] this is a prophecy how many believe that
[15:31] if anybody's prayer is going to be
[15:33] answered it could be Jesus prayer
[15:36] you may think God's not answering your
[15:38] prayer but God always answers prayer
[15:40] whether it's yes or no but I can tell
[15:42] you one thing there's no doubt Jesus
[15:44] prayer is going to be heard and you know
[15:46] what his prayer is here that they may be
[15:48] one as We Are One that they would come
[15:51] to True Oneness not through a
[15:52] denomination not through a mechanical
[15:54] legislative thing not through a World
[15:57] Council of churches no no no no no
[15:58] they're going to use that scripture by
[16:00] the way they're gonna the the
[16:02] Church systems are using this scripture
[16:04] that we all become one all the
[16:07] denominations they
[16:10] Nations but sure they're not allowed to
[16:12] use that mechanically it's God that will
[16:15] make us one with one another it's the
[16:17] holy God house
[16:18] glory be to God it's only by the Holy
[16:21] Ghost
[16:21] [Applause]
[16:22] that the church becomes one it's
[16:25] actually when we break down our
[16:27] denominational barriers
[16:29] that God and by the only by the Holy
[16:32] Ghost one Spirit do we become one
[16:35] it's only by the glory of God
[16:38] and so now questions you know there's
[16:42] questions about relationships that I've
[16:44] had I trust you're not offended by this
[16:45] but the things that I ask why under this
[16:48] great restoration message is family
[16:51] relationships still lacking why does
[16:53] someone say that they have a
[16:55] relationship with God and still have
[16:57] their walls up
[16:58] and their grudges
[17:00] to certain ones and favor others within
[17:02] the church am I allowed to ask questions
[17:06] I don't even know
[17:07] s but I'm asking God why is this
[17:09] happening why why why why does uh why is
[17:13] it that when someone repents The Grudge
[17:16] is still held against them for years why
[17:18] can some talk so religious and be so
[17:21] seemed so close to God but have years of
[17:24] unresolved issues with their children
[17:26] and their wife has everybody left the
[17:28] building
[17:31] foreign
[17:33] I don't mean this I don't mean this
[17:35] isn't in this is 33 years of pastoring
[17:37] and a lot of these questions I ask
[17:39] myself because I've seen these
[17:40] breakdowns in my response to
[17:42] relationships I'm just asking the
[17:44] questions I'm asking you to take take
[17:47] them home with you and consider it why
[17:49] is it someone repents and The Grudge is
[17:51] still held for years why can some talk
[17:53] show religious online on the internet
[17:55] close to God but have years of
[17:57] unresolved issues with children
[17:58] unforgiving Spirit why can someone
[18:01] preach that's one
[18:08] in a certain category why does that
[18:10] happen
[18:12] why do people say they are a Christian
[18:14] and look for reasons to separate from
[18:17] the body of Christ why are families
[18:19] sometimes completely locked up
[18:23] maybe because there's a secret rule in
[18:25] the family we don't talk about that
[18:27] don't talk about that children we don't
[18:29] talk about that we don't go there
[18:31] why are family is locked up because of
[18:33] it
[18:34] and a lot of times Daddy's locked them
[18:36] up and realize he's doing it
[18:39] I'm talking about relationships I'm
[18:42] saying that if if we have been restored
[18:45] in a full Back to Eden relationship
[18:48] unhindered because remember Oneness
[18:51] intimacy that Adam and Eve had with God
[18:53] intimacy is a relationship without walls
[19:00] and there's you can talk about anything
[19:02] because there's no walls up between you
[19:05] that's real intimacy so how many
[19:07] marriages are married having relations
[19:10] and you know what I'm talking about but
[19:12] no intimacy the walls have been up for
[19:14] years we don't talk about that we don't
[19:15] go there
[19:17] he's hiding something or she's hiding
[19:19] something or the children are hiding
[19:20] something and nobody's allowed to talk
[19:22] about it's got the family all locked up
[19:23] trying to come to church and raise their
[19:24] hands and trying to be free
[19:26] and there's no talk about it there's no
[19:28] openness there's no open honest
[19:29] conversations if all the walls are up
[19:31] listen I I'm interested in a gospel and
[19:34] a message that is preached that brings
[19:36] Deliverance not just here at church and
[19:39] not just to help your relationship with
[19:40] God but that can trickle down into our
[19:43] families and our relationships
[19:46] God please bring the reality of the
[19:50] blood of Jesus Christ to the people
[19:53] so why why why my so many wives I could
[19:57] go on all day with the wise I have I
[19:59] have a million of them
[20:02] but you know that's that's kind of
[20:04] staying on the negative we'd all be
[20:06] pretty depressed when I if I spent this
[20:08] whole service on why
[20:09] how do I get to the Y's I want to get to
[20:11] the answers
[20:13] I want to get to some victories you
[20:15] probably got a million wise you can tell
[20:16] me why the question is is that how come
[20:19] relationships aren't better
[20:23] if Jesus said this effect
[20:26] will affect marriages will affect
[20:29] families
[20:31] if this is bringing us back to Eden
[20:33] then where's the proof of it
[20:38] now not let's not be so negative because
[20:40] we see some families that grow and
[20:43] marriages will grow you're sitting
[20:45] amongst people that marriages were
[20:46] restored that was impossible
[20:49] they shouldn't even be sitting there
[20:50] together today today
[20:52] but by God's grace and the blood of
[20:54] Jesus Christ they're sitting together
[20:55] and their marriage has been restored
[20:57] Satan has
[20:59] of the godhead more than any other
[21:01] truth
[21:04] he has messed with it
[21:07] he hates Satan he hates this teaching
[21:11] that Christ could be the fullness Christ
[21:14] could be the fullness of God in flesh
[21:18] Satan hates this why does Satan hate
[21:20] this that actually the God could pour
[21:23] himself the completion of himself tore
[21:26] himself completely in a human being
[21:28] Jesus Christ Satan hates that he doesn't
[21:31] like that I'm going to tell you in a
[21:32] minute why he's been exposed we know why
[21:35] he's jealous of why he doesn't like it
[21:36] but he is the thought that God could
[21:38] dwell in humans in perfect Oneness so
[21:41] here's two things that God could be in
[21:43] Jesus Christ in his fullness but that
[21:45] God by Spirit could dwell in the human
[21:48] beings I'm not talking about a
[21:50] relationship where we just say I'm
[21:52] trying to be like Jesus and I'm trying
[21:54] to be like the father and I've I've I've
[21:56] uh I've adjusted myself to be a better
[21:59] person to be like Jesus and so I'm
[22:02] trying to be like the father and father
[22:03] that's not the relationship friends the
[22:06] relationship is by Spirit by spirit that
[22:09] his own spirit is living within you that
[22:13] is how we're one
[22:15] Satan
[22:17] is messing
[22:20] with
[22:21] relationship
[22:25] what's he really doing
[22:27] he's limiting this thing that says man
[22:31] and God can become one in a close
[22:34] relationship
[22:36] I'm going to make it about titles I'm
[22:38] going to make it about positions that's
[22:39] why I can't stand it where people are
[22:40] more about position even in coming to
[22:43] church they're more about what position
[22:44] they hold than about Christ
[22:47] and they'll make dishes it's based upon
[22:48] positions and I listen friends this is
[22:51] about relationship
[22:54] this isn't about rules this isn't about
[22:56] positions this is about who's who Jesus
[22:59] dissolved that when he washed the
[23:01] disciples feet when he said wash one
[23:02] another's feet you know what is
[23:04] dissolving positions
[23:06] because the guy that's on the top is
[23:08] going to wash the stinky dirty feet of
[23:11] the lowest guy in the congregation Jesus
[23:13] dissolved all positions
[23:16] praise the Lord I'm having a good time
[23:19] today even if you're hesitant of where
[23:21] I'm going
[23:25] sick messing with relationship no I'm
[23:27] going to limit being that close to say
[23:29] that I'm one with God and I'm taking on
[23:31] his name and I through the Holy Ghost
[23:33] I'm going to become one with the Lord
[23:36] I'm going to limit it make it titles
[23:38] that our attention is on the titles
[23:41] rather than the man you know my children
[23:43] I'm a father I'm a son and I'm a husband
[23:49] but I have a connection with my children
[23:51] I don't want them to be close to me just
[23:54] because I'm their father
[23:58] I want to know their hearts and I want
[24:00] to give my heart to them because this is
[24:02] the closest not because I have the title
[24:04] I could use my title as father I could
[24:07] exercise my authority even when they're
[24:09] not listening even when they're 30 years
[24:11] old I can say well I'm the father you
[24:13] need to do what I say
[24:15] well that's a real good relationship
[24:17] that has no relationship in it
[24:20] is anybody with me here this morning
[24:22] Satan messes with the the truth because
[24:26] here it is you want some more proof of
[24:28] it that day that Jesus said I and my
[24:31] father are one how many knows he said it
[24:33] I and my father are one it says the Jews
[24:36] picked up stones to throw stones at him
[24:38] well who's getting mad at the Oneness
[24:41] Satan in the people is always angry at
[24:45] the Oneness God's people becoming one in
[24:48] a relationship with the father
[24:51] now I'll tell you why he's resentful
[24:53] because what you have if you have the
[24:55] Holy Ghost and you're becoming one with
[24:57] God and you're one with God by the Holy
[24:58] Ghost when you're doing that you have a
[25:01] relationship that Satan I'm going to
[25:03] tell Satan this morning Satan I have
[25:06] something that you can never have
[25:11] he has been envious from the very
[25:14] beginning of God's children he has been
[25:16] jealous of God's children that's why we
[25:18] have little jealousies come up in the
[25:19] congregation sometimes we should never
[25:21] be jealous of one another if someone
[25:23] excels in the kingdom of God we should
[25:25] Rejoice with him
[25:26] but I'm here to serve Satan notice today
[25:29] I'm going to tell him Satan I know he's
[25:31] listening he comes to church more than
[25:33] some of you all satan I have in my Heart
[25:36] by the Holy Ghost a relationship with
[25:39] the Lord Jesus Christ that you can never
[25:42] have
[25:43] he hates my relationship with God
[25:45] with God unfettered no walls under the
[25:48] blood of Jesus Christ I've come back
[25:51] into Eden again
[25:52] what was Eden unhindered relationship
[25:56] with God by the Holy Spirit come down in
[25:58] the cool of the evening
[25:59] and cooed with his children Adam and Eve
[26:02] there was no sin they weren't afraid of
[26:04] God they weren't afraid to talk to God
[26:07] they fellowshipped in the cool of the
[26:09] evening and it was unhindered
[26:10] relationship
[26:11] the blood of Jesus Christ is bringing
[26:14] God's children back to unhindered
[26:15] relationships not through a priest not
[26:18] through a pope not through a church but
[26:20] you can go directly to God
[26:21] I'll tell you Satan's envious if you got
[26:23] that this morning you say praise the
[26:24] Lord I got a relationship with him
[26:26] unhindered Satan that's why he don't
[26:28] like you he fights to this day he fights
[26:31] your mind how many raise your hands
[26:32] death the devil fights my mind how many
[26:34] say the devil always tries to question
[26:35] you I don't I don't know if you're one
[26:37] of them you made a mistake the other day
[26:38] I don't even know if you're a child of
[26:39] God how many has that devil speaking to
[26:41] you the reason he does it is he resents
[26:43] he's jealous of your relationship with
[26:46] Christ he can't have that he wanted
[26:48] power Lucifer a rose tried to take the
[26:52] kingdom influence a third of the stars
[26:53] and he wanted to lift his throne above
[26:55] the Throne of what he wanted to be
[26:56] worshiped like God he's always wanted
[26:58] that position and then God comes down
[27:01] glory be to God and he hands all the
[27:04] creative power to his son Adam not to an
[27:07] angel to his son Adam on Earth and says
[27:10] Adam this Earth is Yours I created this
[27:12] one specifically for you and guess what
[27:15] you have all the power to change animals
[27:17] names to change mountains to create
[27:19] whatever you want you've got creative
[27:20] power and Satan's going but that's what
[27:22] I wanted
[27:24] I want that creative power how many know
[27:27] Satan can't create he only perverts what
[27:29] God's already done he cannot create
[27:30] anything but he's wanted it I want it I
[27:33] want it I want it I want that creative
[27:34] power and God comes and gives it to you
[27:36] Sons and Daughters of God living in You
