[0:00] my wife's gonna start
[0:04] i just
[0:06] wanted to thank the lord because um
[0:09] yesterday at the funeral of jim brother
[0:11] jim bab's funeral at the end of it
[0:14] it was about 95 degrees and my
[0:17] outside yeah and my mom started feeling
[0:20] faint
[0:21] and
[0:22] she went over and she sat next to my dad
[0:25] and then she passed out
[0:27] um when there's they have several
[0:30] doctors in the church they gathered
[0:31] around her
[0:32] and her pulse was at 30 i think and she
[0:37] was um had already turned blue and she
[0:39] was gurgling
[0:41] um so they um revived her and by the
[0:46] time the emts got there
[0:48] um she was feeling somewhat better so
[0:50] they assumed that it was a hit the heat
[0:52] we did advise her to go on yesterday and
[0:55] be checked and everything checked out
[0:57] good but i'm just thankful because
[0:59] you know it could have been a bad
[1:01] situation and we're very thankful that
[1:03] god
[1:05] [Applause]
[1:10] someone else have spared tonight
[1:13] come forward
[1:16] very good
[1:27] god bless you all i was hoping brother
[1:29] paul bring the microphone
[1:33] but a couple of weeks ago
[1:36] there was an air show my brother has a
[1:39] concession with the air show in michigan
[1:41] and he offered us to come and help him
[1:44] you know
[1:46] so
[1:47] during that time
[1:48] there one of the staff was
[1:51] you know like kind of
[1:52] cursing my brother out and
[1:55] she was just going off on him all in his
[1:57] face and
[1:59] you know the little sister in me wanted
[2:00] to go up to her and just say hey
[2:02] back off
[2:04] you know but i started praying my heart
[2:07] and i'm like lord
[2:09] i don't know what that lady is going
[2:11] through but please just calm her down
[2:14] um you know whatever she's she's
[2:16] whatever is is in her life just you know
[2:19] make it right and just calm her down so
[2:22] a couple of seconds you know she did
[2:23] calm down and then i went about my
[2:25] business
[2:26] and
[2:28] and i forgot all about it and later on
[2:30] my brother came up to me and told me
[2:33] that she
[2:34] came up to him um you know in private
[2:37] and told him you know apologized to him
[2:39] and said that she was very sorry that
[2:41] um she embarrassed him in front of you
[2:43] know her family and his family
[2:45] and then later on when everything was
[2:47] over she came up to me she's like i am
[2:49] so sorry
[2:51] that i act the way i did and you know
[2:53] please forgive me and she told me all
[2:56] about her life and i kind of connected
[2:59] why she was acting that way but
[3:01] i told her you know it's okay you know
[3:04] and
[3:05] i i was thinking god that
[3:07] i prayed for her you know i remember
[3:10] brother paul talking about or singing
[3:12] about you know how we have to have
[3:14] compassion you know for the sinner and
[3:16] again you know i
[3:18] that's i believe that's the god in me
[3:20] because in my flesh i probably would
[3:22] have gone up to her and and said what i
[3:25] had to say
[3:26] and i'm being honest but yeah
[3:30] so i just wanted to share that with you
[3:33] big sister right and taking care of the
[3:35] situation
[3:36] praise the lord sis wonderful you were
[3:38] moved with compassion of christ and you
[3:41] moved with compassion all right somebody
[3:44] else i just wanted to
[3:46] have a testimony
[3:48] anyone from the camp
[3:58] i'm like sister jennifer i would much
[4:00] rather stay back there
[4:03] um
[4:04] but
[4:05] many of you know that
[4:07] for probably about the past year and a
[4:09] half you've all been praying for my
[4:11] health
[4:14] and
[4:18] i just want to give glory to the lord
[4:23] because i can be here and not be in
[4:25] hardly any pain
[4:29] [Applause]
[4:35] you know i can stand in my feet
[4:38] and i can sing and really praise
[4:41] without so much pain and before i just
[4:44] couldn't really stand
[4:49] so just a back story is
[4:51] about a year and a half ago
[4:53] i started having a lot of pain in my
[4:54] feet and
[4:58] we finally got on and saw
[5:01] several
[5:02] we saw two different foot doctors and
[5:04] went through
[5:05] injections and different diagnosis and
[5:08] um
[5:12] probably the last six months like
[5:14] everything just slowly got worse and it
[5:16] wasn't just in my feet it was like my
[5:18] knees and my legs and i had muscle pain
[5:20] and nerve pain
[5:22] and my knees got really bad i could
[5:24] barely walk up and down my steps at home
[5:27] so every day was a struggle
[5:31] for my age it was really hard
[5:34] on myself and my family
[5:37] but anyways the lord just put it on our
[5:39] hearts to get just to get another
[5:41] opinion
[5:43] and um we came across um
[5:46] an an old family doctor we had been
[5:48] seeing who had moved
[5:50] and um i think my mother-in-law gave me
[5:52] his information or whatever but
[5:54] we just prayed about it and i thought
[5:55] well let's just get into a family doctor
[5:57] and like just start from ground zero
[5:59] because nothing was making sense
[6:01] as to how much pain i was in for my age
[6:05] so we got in there and um
[6:08] he was like no this is not normal we
[6:11] need to like has anyone done labs you
[6:14] know hasn't i said no he said well let's
[6:16] just
[6:17] start from the ground up and just test
[6:19] for everything
[6:21] so and when when you're in that much
[6:23] pain like
[6:25] you know i i often said like
[6:28] you know i i felt like i was 65 and not
[6:31] you know 34.
[6:33] that's the way i walked
[6:35] it was really sad
[6:39] but anyways
[6:45] so he tested me for all these different
[6:48] things and it was hard because when
[6:49] you're in that much pain it's like
[6:52] lord you know what what tests and trials
[6:54] do you have for us because i feel like
[6:56] i'm dying i feel like there's something
[6:58] wrong with me
[6:59] and um god just gave me strength and
[7:02] faith and through all your prayers and
[7:04] support
[7:06] um
[7:07] everything came back good
[7:10] and i want to praise the lord for that
[7:15] the one thing he he did not test me for
[7:17] was um a mess and he was a little
[7:20] concerned
[7:21] for that with my symptoms
[7:23] and my husband just said
[7:26] we're not even gonna go there
[7:28] so i did not get tested for that that's
[7:30] like a spinal tap
[7:32] um
[7:33] but anyways everything came back clear
[7:35] and he he basically said
[7:38] like for a diagnosis he said
[7:41] fibromyalgia and as i read about that
[7:44] there's not a lot of information about
[7:46] it it's just kind of vague and
[7:48] so i asked him i said so
[7:50] i said to me i said this sounds like a
[7:52] fancy
[7:53] scientific name for we don't know what's
[7:56] wrong with you and he looked
[7:59] and he's a christian man and he laughed
[8:01] and he said that's exactly what it is
[8:04] so
[8:04] he said let's he he did suggest a
[8:06] medication which i was very leery of
[8:09] and he said let's just try it
[8:12] and we prayed about it because i don't
[8:14] like taking medicine i i
[8:17] have not in the past um
[8:20] i hate side effects
[8:22] you know and i just you know we want
[8:24] god's miraculous like just healing you
[8:27] know just
[8:28] to be gone
[8:30] but i said lord i won't be stubborn if
[8:32] you want to use a medication i'll do
[8:34] that
[8:36] and so that's what we're doing and by
[8:38] his grace i am i'm at church and i'm
[8:41] more here
[8:42] because
[8:44] the pain is gone
[8:46] and i just wanna
[8:48] you know i when i take that medicine i
[8:50] don't
[8:52] i don't rely on that
[8:54] i rely on god
[8:56] so i just want to give him all the glory
[8:59] i thank god every day that i can get out
[9:02] of bed
[9:05] forgive me
[9:09] so you just don't realize
[9:12] what you have
[9:14] our health we take our health for
[9:16] granted
[9:17] and
[9:18] i just thank the lord that i feel better
[9:21] and i can take care of my family and my
[9:22] husband and be with you all and be more
[9:25] here
[9:27] and um
[9:28] god is so good i don't deserve it
[9:31] but i give them all the glory and i
[9:33] thank you all for all your prayers and
[9:34] support oh god bless you

[12:44] shoulder
[12:45] i could really have some sympathy for
[12:47] brother ray just a small touch of what
[12:49] he goes through
[12:50] um but i don't know if it's a mixture of
[12:52] the lord touching me and guiding me to
[12:55] the right kind of supplements and things
[12:56] and food to eat but i'm a lot better
[12:59] thank god amen glory to god
[13:02] amen
[13:06] amen anybody from camp want to testify
[13:09] the camp that took place last weekend
[13:13] that you all stayed down there and
[13:15] didn't come home sunday it was so good
[13:18] and we're not holding that against you
[13:20] we're glad of it anybody want to come up
[13:22] say anything
[13:25] um
[13:27] yeah i was really happy about the
[13:28] reports on that i had a testimony come
[13:30] in this week um
[13:32] brother daniel gibson dinner it was his
[13:33] birthday monday he's a minister from
[13:35] covington georgia and i thought i'd just
[13:37] give him a call for his birthday and
[13:39] um
[13:39] he said since you called he said i want
[13:41] to share something with you on the phone
[13:42] last october
[13:44] you came and did our anniversary
[13:46] meetings and
[13:47] brother daniel i don't i wouldn't have
[13:49] time to talk about all that he's been
[13:51] through i don't know if he's i guess
[13:52] he's about 40 some
[13:54] and all that the surgeries he's had
[13:56] three shoulder surgeries he's had cancer
[13:59] he shot his hand a couple years ago we
[14:02] were
[14:02] brought these requests just about every
[14:04] time before our church and he's just
[14:07] been through a lot as
[14:08] a minister just a lot and preached
[14:11] mostly through all of that and then in
[14:13] constant pain because of the surgeries
[14:14] now he's going to have two knee
[14:16] surgeries but
[14:17] the time i met him in october and was
[14:19] down there he was on a lot of medicines
[14:21] i think probably nine or ten medicines
[14:23] he was just having to do that just to
[14:25] function the doctor said you you know
[14:27] how doctors you know you'll be on this
[14:29] rest of your life or you will you'll be
[14:30] dead
[14:31] and so you know like him and i talked
[14:34] about
[14:35] medicines can be used of the lord and
[14:37] all these other things but i'd like to
[14:38] encourage people that never accept
[14:41] that ultimately you'll be on that
[14:42] forever that because we want to believe
[14:45] that someday that in god's timing that
[14:47] he will
[14:48] have you released of that you don't want
[14:49] to accept that it's a death sentence and
[14:52] so we were talking about that he said i
[14:54] want to tell you he said you and and i
[14:56] did i entered into a real urgent fervent
[14:59] prayer when i was there with his church
[15:01] i asked the church with special prayer
[15:03] come around and lay hands on him and we
[15:05] we said a prayer that sunday it was his
[15:07] birthday that sunday two i believe and
[15:09] we
[15:10] really really entered into the need and
[15:12] really prayed for him and he says then
[15:14] he says i was just expecting and
[15:15] expecting and laid it before the
[15:17] congregation and
[15:18] this march he said something happened in
[15:20] one day and he said he went back and he
[15:23] just said i know this is the end of
[15:24] these medicines and he was released to
[15:27] go off all of them he's not on one of
[15:29] those medicines now completely with no
[15:31] pain no pain whatsoever
[15:34] so that was amen that was from october
[15:37] to march so sometimes as i was saying
[15:40] sunday
[15:41] you know
[15:42] when the word speaks
[15:44] pharaoh's days are numbered
[15:46] can you say man
[15:48] just keep believing because the
[15:49] deliverance is coming and that's just
[15:51] the way god works and we have to
[15:53] sometimes in his instant other times we
[15:55] have to wait but in his season he'll do
[15:57] the work and i thought that was a great
[15:59] testimony not to point to me but to the
[16:01] lord and what he does and the effectual
[16:04] fervent prayer of a righteous man
[16:06] availeth much that's what the book of
[16:08] james says so we when we enter prayer
[16:11] don't make it just a shallow thing enter
[16:13] into the need enter in and believe what
[16:15] you're saying is going to come to pass
[16:17] very important in our prayer to be that
[16:19] way
[16:20] i thought that was wonderful and i know
[16:22] the lord touched many hearts of the camp
[16:25] and also hear this last sunday as well
[16:28] it's just such a move of the lord we're
[16:30] praying for some more that need a touch
[16:32] from the lord but i think many were very
[16:35] touched on sunday we're thankful for
[16:36] that amen anybody else have one tonight
[16:39] before eli come on
[16:43] amen
[16:51] god bless you uh we're just
[16:53] we we want to show our gratitude to our
[16:55] god um
[16:57] this is going to end with a new car but
[16:59] that's actually not the biggest
[17:02] um
[17:02] blessing that we have seen
[17:05] um it was more of
[17:07] god
[17:08] doing
[17:09] lining everything up
[17:12] exactly you know for two weeks that was
[17:15] just amazing i kind of briefly go over
[17:18] it
[17:20] so yeah i guess two weeks ago tomorrow
[17:24] we were an accident well i guess maybe
[17:27] go back my wife had been
[17:29] wanting a bigger car suv
[17:33] for
[17:34] months
[17:35] just so she has more room to deal with
[17:37] samuel
[17:38] and so i'm slowly looking at them
[17:41] well it's you know
[17:44] you never want to spend that much money
[17:46] just because you you know if you don't
[17:48] have to so
[17:50] um
[17:51] so
[17:52] two weeks ago
[17:53] we uh we're in an accident and we thank
[17:56] god that we're all safe nobody was hurt
[17:58] the other driver was um fine
[18:01] um it just so happened we were in it
[18:04] the kid pulled into an intersection as
[18:06] we were going through we uh i had i was
[18:09] stopping on the brake pretty good so the
[18:11] front end it was just uh decent damage
[18:14] but it was like not a high end not high
[18:17] velocity
[18:18] impact um
[18:20] but my car was so old
[18:23] way too many miles so they decided it
[18:25] was totaled so
[18:28] so this was
[18:29] you know over the weekend and so tuesday
[18:31] we get this information your car is
[18:33] totaled we're like okay what are we
[18:36] going to do
[18:37] for a car so we all day last wednesday
[18:40] we went shopping for one
[18:43] we finally bought one on
[18:45] friday but the little
[18:48] series that goes
[18:50] thursday the day of the accident i get
[18:53] home
[18:54] i had already called the insurance
[18:55] company for the first time
[18:57] and we're getting ready to settle down
[18:59] for the night my boss calls me and says
[19:02] uh the mri scanner is down no need to
[19:05] come in tomorrow
[19:08] hallelujah
[19:09] so
[19:10] so luckily all day friday i was doing uh
[19:14] all the
[19:16] insurance
[19:17] you know phone calls you know things
[19:20] like that so that was like taking up my
[19:22] day on friday
[19:23] so then monday

[19:27] home
[19:28] and just so happen i was like okay um i

[19:43] calls me and was like i'm having chest
[19:45] pressure oh okay
[19:47] so we ended up going to the er
[19:49] everything was fine it was just a little
[19:51] muscle um
[19:53] pain
[19:54] and then she probably had the testimony
[19:56] that she actually
[19:58] after
[19:59] i guess would have been last sunday
[20:02] she felt completely better from that as
[20:04] well so we praise god for that um
[20:08] but
[20:09] so
[20:10] i we we went to the er so i had the day
[20:12] off to take that i was here to take her
[20:14] to the er instead of her having to deal
[20:17] with it by herself with samuel
[20:19] so then wednesday so then thursday
[20:23] well so wednesday night or wednesday i
[20:25] had been looking on
[20:27] line for cars and we had found this one
[20:30] in angola indiana is like where i work
[20:32] it's like straight across i was like
[20:34] i've been right on time right on the way
[20:36] i was like okay okay well i'll take a
[20:39] look at that on my way home
[20:41] well
[20:42] that night my boss calls me and says can
[20:45] you go down to marion
[20:47] instead of up to elkhart
[20:49] i'm like sure so i go down to marion
[20:51] well
[20:52] if i don't know if you all know the uh
[20:55] geography but angola is kind of way out
[20:58] of the way from my travel there but fort
[21:01] wayne is right on the way so
[21:03] at work there um there was another lady
[21:06] doing most of the work so i was just you
[21:08] know helping her out and uh looking on
[21:11] my phone well i found
[21:13] two other vehicles and one was up in
[21:15] detroit and one was in fort wayne and
[21:17] the one in detroit never responded to me
[21:19] but the fort wayne was like yeah stop on
[21:22] over you know
[21:23] i was like okay i should be there about
[21:24] five o'clock so i get there about five
[21:26] o'clock
[21:27] and
[21:28] the thing was that from marion
[21:30] for fort wayne was like right on the way
[21:32] i was literally five minutes out of my
[21:35] way so i was like oh i get there in this
[21:38] you know wonderful car and i'm telling
[21:40] my wife how
[21:41] you know
[21:42] how much she would love it and so
[21:44] so
[21:45] so why i'm there i text my boss and say
[21:48] what does tomorrow look like do i you
[21:50] know he's like service guy is going to
[21:52] be there tomorrow stay home like okay
[21:56] so so then that friday we
[21:59] the whole family we go over to fort
[22:01] wayne look at the car we end up buying
[22:03] it and driving back so the thing was i
[22:06] guess the whole point of this is god
[22:10] every time that i needed to be home
[22:15] the machine was down and he worked
[22:18] things out so
[22:20] exactly that what we needed for the past
[22:22] two weeks that we just
[22:24] can't do anything but praise him and i
[22:26] mean
[22:27] you know sometimes you look back and you
[22:29] see it but it was so amazing that we
[22:31] could as we were walking through it we
[22:34] were like wow
[22:35] how did he know we would need that today
[22:38] how did he know we need that today
[22:40] and it was a true blessing so awesome
[22:45] amen
[22:49] amen that's good and i i do like that
[22:51] car too so it's okay to have a nice car
[22:54] you know i did that because he's an
[22:56] on-time god

[23:40] but when eli got up and started
[23:43] testifying about the car i was like okay
[23:46] i'll say something about
[23:48] these earthly things that they're not as
[23:51] special as all the spiritual things that
[23:54] happen to our young people this week and
[23:57] and all the spiritual things that god
[23:59] provides for us every day um they don't
[24:01] matter as much but
[24:04] god is more than able and he cares about
[24:08] refrigerators and cars and
[24:11] water heaters and all of our needs
[24:14] and
[24:15] the testimony for meeting eyes we have
[24:18] our house completely

[24:31] had free cupboards and we prayed for a
[24:34] stove we god gave us a stove for free
[24:37] refrigerator freeze refrigerator
[24:40] you know dishwasher the whole house is
[24:43] ready to sell it's beautiful and it's

[29:51] humble prayer tonight
[29:52] we give you the service in jesus name
[29:54] amen
[29:57] hey man i was just
[29:58] i was uh
[29:59] just thinking what pull this up can you
[30:02] guys hear me okay
[30:03] okay
[30:04] um i was thinking jennifer and tiffany
[30:07] they're like i'd rather be back there
[30:09] right now and talking but it's not going
[30:12] to work for me
[30:13] either so
[30:15] all right so
[30:17] anyways let's turn to it in the
[30:19] scriptures tonight uh ephesians 2 verse
[30:22] 1 just a simple
[30:24] scripture tonight
[30:39] i mean if you got it say amen
[30:43] and then we got it on the
[30:47] monitor there too so
[30:49] if you want to say it with me too just
[30:51] so we're involved it's just just one
[30:53] verse we'll say here together
[30:55] and you hath be quickened
[30:58] who are dead in trespasses and sins
[31:02] amen you may be seated
[31:05] all right so
[31:07] i guess just starting off um i guess i
[31:10] got some advice on just uh
[31:14] just what to how to start or what to do
[31:17] as far as the first sermon and i got
[31:19] some advice on just
[31:21] just tell how the candle got lit
[31:23] so
[31:24] i'll just testify a little bit and
[31:27] you know we'll just go from there so
[31:30] um so when i thought of these questions
[31:32] how did the candle get lit
[31:34] uh or where did my journey start
[31:38] um the first thing i thought was you
[31:40] know i grew up in a message church grew
[31:42] up in a
[31:44] message home and
[31:46] you know just the i guess it was about
[31:48] ottawa lake there my first church and i
[31:50] was just thinking it was kind of funny
[31:51] people say they're cutting their teeth
[31:53] on
[31:54] you know message pews but it wasn't for
[31:56] us we had chairs right
[31:58] and we didn't cut our teeth on those
[32:00] pews we had those little plastic things
[32:02] on the side that we would pull off right
[32:05] and we would try to fit them in like
[32:06] different ways that's how solomon knows
[32:08] you gotta
[32:09] i don't know so that was just kind of
[32:11] refreshing where i was back there in
[32:13] those days but
[32:15] so i grew up in truth right i grew up in
[32:18] um
[32:19] honestly just
[32:20] i think i mean this was probably biased
[32:23] for me but i think
[32:24] as far as just parenting
[32:27] and just the guidance i got as a child
[32:30] teach the teaching of the word i
[32:33] couldn't have been more blessed so
[32:35] i mean for me my testimony it's like
[32:39] it's uh it's hard to you know say like i
[32:42] was you know
[32:44] extremely off or extremely just way out
[32:47] there
[32:48] but god had to bring me to that and say
[32:50] that i was off i was out there and he
[32:53] had to tell me where i was and he had to
[32:55] show me
[32:57] how how awful i was and how beautiful he
[33:00] is so
[33:02] so
[33:04] that was the first little part there so
[33:06] um
[33:06] so i was a preacher's son as well
[33:09] a lot of that
[33:10] is expectations a lot of people say oh
[33:13] man the expectations of just being a
[33:15] preacher's son and
[33:17] pastors a pastor's son you must feel all
[33:20] this pressure all the time
[33:22] and you feel i don't know just uh
[33:25] i guess you you feel like there's a ton
[33:28] of people watching you and you know you
[33:30] feel like you're you're almost like
[33:32] you've got to do everything right right
[33:34] and there's a little bit of truth to
[33:35] that because you you know you feel that
[33:37] pressure all the time but
[33:39] later on
[33:40] just to encourage i don't know who would
[33:42] watch this later but
[33:45] when god
[33:46] when god is
[33:48] when you want to please god
[33:49] that really fades away all those
[33:52] pressures really fade away because when
[33:54] his blood
[33:56] when his blood is applied
[33:58] and
[33:59] you know then all the other pressures
[34:01] all the other forces coming against you
[34:03] really don't matter anymore because he
[34:06] cleanses you he frees you from all that
[34:08] so there's no pressure anywhere from
[34:11] that so just to encourage all the the
[34:14] pks out there i know my siblings are and
[34:17] you know
[34:18] my dad was and all that so
[34:21] all right so then
[34:23] we've got
[34:24] psalms
[34:26] 103 7 17 and 18 but the mercy of the
[34:30] lord is from everlasting to everlasting
[34:33] upon them that fear him and his
[34:35] righteousness unto his children's
[34:37] children
[34:38] to such as keep his covenant and to
[34:40] those that remember this commandment
[34:43] commandments to do them
[34:45] so i was just thinking about even how
[34:47] our family got started
[34:49] and going back to uh even my grandpa my
[34:52] my on my mom's side my dad's side my my
[34:56] two grandmas
[34:58] just seeing their
[35:00] their prayers back then
[35:02] and seeing their multi-generational view
[35:05] and their prayers
[35:06] for even my life you know
[35:09] so um that little seed that was in them
[35:12] that little seed
[35:14] that's a trickle-down effect that
[35:16] affects multi-gen it's a
[35:18] multi-generational view so
[35:20] um as far as the young people i know it
[35:23] was amazing to see
[35:25] dad we've been going through some of the
[35:26] courtship stuff praying for your praying
[35:29] for your wife
[35:30] praying for your your future kids i mean
[35:33] that's that's something that
[35:35] excuse me
[35:36] that's something that uh
[35:38] we should always have in our heart
[35:40] always thinking of the future that's
[35:42] what we have amen our past is gone but
[35:44] our future is coming amen
[35:46] so
[35:47] that's just a little thought i had on
[35:49] that
[35:50] and then i also thought of grandpa you
[35:52] know yielding to the lord and how we
[35:54] must always be yielded to him
[35:57] to
[35:58] to christ
[35:59] he's
[36:00] he's
[36:01] he should be number one in just the
[36:04] transition you've heard my grandpa's
[36:05] testimony but
[36:07] um
[36:08] you know he was yielded to christ and he
[36:10] was he had that fear
[36:12] fear of the lord is the beginning of
[36:14] wisdom right
[36:15] so uh so he was
[36:18] i guess that fear is the beginning of
[36:21] his wisdom right it's not like man-made
[36:23] wisdom or anything it's it's god's
[36:25] wisdom
[36:26] so that seed that fear of the lord that
[36:29] god gave him that's the beginning of
[36:31] something and it's it's it starts
[36:34] it starts it could start
[36:37] multi-generations it could it could
[36:39] trickle down to that so starting with
[36:41] just that fear of the lord and just a
[36:43] simple believer
[36:46] i mean i was just blown away just
[36:48] thinking about that and the past as well
[36:50] so
[36:52] the past can be used for your your uh
[36:55] let me think how to rephrase that
[36:56] everyone looks at the past and think
[36:58] that it's a bad thing right and what
[37:00] their sins were and everything but their
[37:03] the past
[37:05] can be used for good and looking at all
[37:08] the victories you've had in the past so
[37:10] don't don't ever
[37:12] don't ever
[37:14] don't ever look back and say
[37:16] you know oh my past was awful or
[37:18] anything god
[37:20] god
[37:21] in predestination god had all those
[37:23] things planned
[37:25] so just keep you know keep moving
[37:27] forward i was just
[37:29] thinking about that don't uh don't think
[37:31] that your your trials and what you've
[37:33] gone through are a bad thing
[37:35] god
[37:36] god used them for your victory he used
[37:38] them for your character too
[37:40] so
[37:42] so keep that keep that in mind
[37:44] [Music]
[37:45] and then i was also thinking of this
[37:48] this word as far as my testimony i got
[37:50] uh baptized um i got baptized when i was
[37:54] nine years old
[37:55] and um
[37:57] at the time dad gave me good advice even
[37:59] going into it and um
[38:02] you know he he brought up you know it's
[38:04] actually a representation of you being
[38:06] dead in sin you're dying to yourself and
[38:09] rising again in christ
[38:11] so it was a beautiful picture for me so
[38:13] even i i because i found because i
[38:15] understood it so well i knew that that
[38:17] was
[38:18] it was confirmation i can hold on to
[38:20] that time
[38:21] and i can say that's when i that's when
[38:24] i was baptized and i you know i believe
[38:26] that's uh you know that was a step in my
[38:29] my christian walk so
[38:31] i think every christian needs that a
[38:33] water baptism amen it's uh
[38:36] water water blood and spirit amen we
[38:39] need that amen
[38:41] amen
[38:43] amen
[38:44] so yeah we got we got this time in high
[38:46] school as well i would be really real
[38:49] with you tonight
[38:51] because it's dear to my heart
[38:53] and
[38:54] you know
[38:55] you feel ashamed of it and just your
[38:57] past but at the same time i just want to
[38:59] be transparent with you and
[39:02] but in high school
[39:03] that was i would say the sanctification
[39:06] sanctification time for me i was
[39:09] very
[39:12] i guess the roller coaster i mean it was
[39:14] just up and down as far as finding my
[39:16] satisfaction and
[39:18] uh confidence in the word it still
[39:20] wasn't there right
[39:21] so i um
[39:23] i'm going through high school you find
[39:25] you're in an identity crisis you know
[39:28] you're at this stage in your life where
[39:30] you know you don't
[39:31] you don't really know yourself um
[39:34] even looking back on salvation you know
[39:36] i still
[39:38] i still uh
[39:40] i was
[39:41] like unsure you know where i stood so
[39:44] um
[39:45] so
[39:46] looking back there i i went through a
[39:48] lot of uh lust that was probably the
[39:51] main thing
[39:52] and i'm getting to where the victory
[39:54] comes but i would say freshman junior
[39:57] year there's so much of that in my life
[39:59] as far as the mental battles and as you
[40:02] guys know the the greatest battle i've
[40:04] ever fought is the mind so
[40:07] as for me as a introvert
[40:09] i i i really struggle with that so much
[40:12] more because
[40:14] you're you're alone a lot of the time
[40:16] and that's where that's where the battle
[40:18] goes on all the time see the extroverts
[40:21] they just release it they go for it you
[40:23] know they just they talk about it and
[40:25] they get it off their chats with chess
[40:27] which is probably
[40:28] brings them uh uh well i guess it's
[40:31] different forever but it brings them a
[40:33] little bit of victory even exposing the
[40:35] devil like that so for me that gets like
[40:38] it's really hard for me to do you know
[40:40] and uh being transparent and uh
[40:44] you know
[40:45] i guess uh revealing what the devil's
[40:47] doing you know and he's disrupting
[40:49] disrupting things in your life but oh
[40:52] yes so we're uh junior year um
[40:55] i would say
[40:57] that's when really god started dealing
[40:59] with me as far as how
[41:01] how ugly i was as a as a human amen um
[41:07] and it was it was a time when you know
[41:11] the mind battles you'd go through
[41:12] scenarios and your mind is almost
[41:15] completely
[41:16] completely
[41:18] um
[41:19] like controlled i guess by that right
[41:22] um by that spirit and um so i i went
[41:25] through that i would say
[41:27] i was december
[41:29] december of that
[41:31] uh
[41:32] let's see that year i can't i can't
[41:34] pinpoint the year right now but i went
[41:36] to one youth retreat and i remember uh
[41:39] it was a
[41:40] couple sermons that god was showing me
[41:42] and i was there at retreat where
[41:44] i believe god completely purified my
[41:48] life and he he realized he he spoke to
[41:51] me and i realized what i was doing i
[41:54] realized the corruption that was going
[41:56] in my mind i realized that and that's
[41:58] the first step right
[42:01] to uh to the salvation plan your
[42:04] deliverance is realizing
[42:07] realizing what you're doing wrong right
[42:11] so that came repentance right we need we
[42:13] all need repentance amen that doesn't
[42:15] stop either we all
[42:17] we need to repent every day dying daily
[42:20] right as paul said amen
[42:22] so
[42:24] so that brings me um
[42:27] so i go through that and um
[42:30] you know that that that time you're
[42:32] feeling very free you know of just uh
[42:35] what what god's uh got what god's doing
[42:38] for you but that's that's not the last
[42:40] of it right
[42:41] amen there needs to be a filling amen
[42:44] this is where i want to get to tonight
[42:46] as far as
[42:48] as far as the holy ghost goes in my life
[42:51] and even being under the age of the holy
[42:54] ghost and the eagle the eagle age this
[42:57] means so much more to me now
[43:00] the more i feed on the word the more i
[43:03] i
[43:05] the more i
[43:06] listen to them the more i realize how
[43:09] much power we have
[43:11] in the holy ghost
[43:14] just
[43:15] all we have in him all we have in christ
[43:18] so
[43:18] so i asked the question tonight what is
[43:20] the holy ghost to you what is the holy
[43:22] ghost to me that's what i ask myself and
[43:26] it's an overcoming life on a soul level
[43:28] it has to be a soul level all right
[43:30] because we can get in the flesh right we
[43:33] can get in the flesh all the time that's
[43:35] honestly being we're born in the flesh
[43:38] right that's that's usually comes what's
[43:41] number one our feelings our emotions
[43:44] everything that that we want right in
[43:46] our human desire
[43:48] but then
[43:49] but then praise god
[43:50] when that holy ghost comes in on the
[43:53] sole level
[43:56] hallelujah bring so much joy to me
[43:59] you must fight for every inch of ground
[44:01] you get
[44:03] it's the joshua commission
[44:06] the holy ghost is one with the word
[44:09] so
[44:11] with the with the sealing of the holy
[44:13] ghost you can't conflict with the other
[44:16] right
[44:16] so that's where i'm coming to tonight i
[44:18] want to say
[44:20] that people always struggle with is the
[44:22] holy ghost and the message is that
[44:26] is that the same thing is it different
[44:28] right
[44:29] but when you come to it they're the same
[44:32] they're the same the holy ghost and the
[44:33] word are one so if there's something in
[44:35] your heart that's saying i don't know if
[44:37] i have the holy ghost or not right i
[44:39] don't know if i have it but if you if
[44:41] you really have it and you you know you
[44:44] know you've had an experience with them
[44:46] your desires change right
[44:50] and i can testify that my desires
[44:52] changed when that when that happened
[44:55] i believe i believed it was there
[44:58] so
[44:59] the spirit and the word are one and it's
[45:03] it's not just the word it's the word for
[45:05] your day right
[45:07] so that's that's what comes me to the
[45:09] message it's believing the word for your
[45:11] day it's not just
[45:13] it's not just and i'm not trying to
[45:15] separate these here tonight but this has
[45:18] been enhanced for your day right
[45:21] this has been enhanced for your day
[45:24] so
[45:25] looking at these scriptures you can read
[45:27] between the lines with what we have for
[45:30] the message of the hour today amen
[45:32] so don't separate the two amen don't
[45:35] separate them god
[45:37] god is sovereign
[45:39] god speaks in many ways
[45:42] he speaks through his prophets
[45:44] amen and uh
[45:47] he's uh
[45:49] and he reveals himself to to his bride
[45:52] so
[45:54] so that's uh i was just getting to that
[45:56] the the word for your day
[45:59] and this scripture comes to me
[46:02] ephesians 1 13-14 in whom ye also
[46:06] trusted
[46:07] after that you heard the word of truth
[46:09] the gospel of your salvation in whom
[46:12] also after that ye believed you were you
[46:15] were sealed with the holy spirit of
[46:17] promise which is the earnest of our
[46:20] inheritance until the redemption of the
[46:22] purchased possession unto the praise of
[46:24] his glory
[46:26] so i was just thinking
[46:28] amen i love the the way brother aaron
[46:31] mcgeary brought it up one time we have
[46:32] the ocean right we have the ocean and
[46:35] it's just vast right it's just
[46:37] it's just there's so much there's so
[46:39] many elements to it
[46:41] but we have we have one little spoonful
[46:44] of that of the ocean right
[46:46] one little spoonful
[46:48] you take one little spoonful you have
[46:50] more molecules in there than all the
[46:53] drops right so you have everything you
[46:55] need in the earnest of your
[46:58] earnest of your redemption which is the
[47:00] holy ghost
[47:02] everything you need
[47:04] so don't
[47:05] don't cut this thing short the holy
[47:07] ghost is what we need in this evil age
[47:09] amen
[47:12] and uh i'll
[47:14] i'll say that till the day i die
[47:16] the whole the holy ghost is what we need
[47:18] in this age amen
[47:20] and we look back through the bible and
[47:23] these these characters they didn't have
[47:25] it they didn't have it the holy ghost
[47:27] right but they pers they had something
[47:29] within them they purposed in their heart
[47:31] right
[47:32] amen
[47:33] amen that just amazes me to see the
[47:35] purpose they had even without the holy
[47:37] ghost amen
[47:40] so uh
[47:42] so yeah the high school battle of the
[47:43] mind
[47:45] um
[47:46] kind of getting off track here but
[47:47] forgive me
[47:49] um
[47:51] so yeah ephesians
[47:53] but i would rather oh i love this but i
[47:56] would rather brother branham says this
[47:58] um
[47:59] but i would rather be wrong in my
[48:00] doctrine and right in my heart than to
[48:03] be right in my doctrine and wrong in my
[48:05] heart see
[48:06] i said after all it's your heart
[48:08] condition
[48:10] so now i want to start talking a little
[48:11] bit about your heart
[48:13] and
[48:15] how
[48:17] how your heart is the breeding ground
[48:19] for the seed to come forth right
[48:23] so um as far as atmosphere and the
[48:26] atmosphere you lay in this this time
[48:29] i just uh
[48:31] i was just thinking about it and uh kind
[48:34] of bringing it back even to a seed
[48:37] in the ground right
[48:39] the ground needs to be soft right in
[48:41] order for that seed to be nourished and
[48:44] and uh
[48:45] and come forth as
[48:46] as fruit right
[48:48] so uh i was just thinking
[48:51] um
[48:52] you know
[48:53] this this weekend is coming coming to
[48:55] this weekend even kind of bringing it to
[48:56] now but i can get so
[48:59] i can get so uh carnal in my mind right
[49:04] i was just sitting back there
[49:06] just at the meetings and
[49:10] i was uh
[49:11] i was just god was dealing with me but
[49:14] also i could i was also analyzing
[49:17] everything in my mind of what was going
[49:19] on what was going on in the service you
[49:21] know obviously there's a lot going on in
[49:23] the services and stuff
[49:24] but i was sitting there analyzing
[49:26] everything and saying is that right is
[49:29] that right is that right is that right
[49:30] and i'm i'm sitting there in my mind i'm
[49:33] just like
[49:34] i'm a critic right
[49:36] i'm i'm being i'm critiquing everything
[49:38] that's going on around me and now i'm
[49:40] really
[49:41] realizing so much now it's so carnal
[49:43] minded
[49:44] right
[49:45] if we could just see the power of god
[49:47] and what it's doing all those things
[49:49] would just fade away right
[49:52] all the all the carnal things we're not
[49:54] the final judge right we're not the
[49:56] final judge he's the final judge
[49:58] so why are we why are we getting so
[50:01] involved and what's what's right and
[50:03] what's wrong we need to be we need it's
[50:06] just when it comes to those services or
[50:08] in our rooms it could be anywhere but
[50:10] it's you and god right it's you and god
[50:13] so don't judge don't judge when when it
[50:16] comes to a service man god corrected me
[50:18] so
[50:19] so hard on me this weekend i i just i
[50:22] micromanage god so much
[50:25] my i i i think i've got it all figured
[50:28] out and then i don't got it all figured
[50:30] out
[50:32] so um so i was just thinking about this
[50:35] morning but um but god you know
[50:38] by the end of the weekend
[50:40] at the end of the weekend i'm there
[50:42] dancing with them
[50:44] i get going with them
[50:46] i uh
[50:47] i was in that
[50:48] i was
[50:50] i was in that brother brother branham
[50:51] talks about him going to a pentecostal
[50:53] church and him get him doing the same
[50:56] thing right and i brought i brought
[50:57] myself in his shoes i was like
[50:59] my i just experienced
[51:01] the same thing he did
[51:03] when that happens my my but it's it's
[51:06] the holy spirit discerning my heart with
[51:08] the word right
[51:10] brother tim pruitt he spoke straight to
[51:12] me he spoke it doesn't have to be
[51:15] brother branham discerning your heart
[51:16] nowadays
[51:18] it's the word of god discerning your
[51:20] heart so the more you're in the word the
[51:22] more character you're gonna get right
[51:24] the more you're in the word the more
[51:26] he's gonna refine you and bring you as a
[51:28] pure gold right
[51:30] so don't be that's when i come back to
[51:32] the soft heart why should we have a soft
[51:35] heart is because
[51:37] we want god to move if that's our desire
[51:39] in the holy ghost we want god to move
[51:41] however way he's going to move
[51:43] so let's not let's not get carnal let's
[51:46] not get carnally minded
[51:49] god god is a big god we don't we can't
[51:52] even touch
[51:53] what what he can do so let's not
[51:56] micromanage god
[51:59] let's let's give him full control and as
[52:01] a song leader too i don't want to get on
[52:03] even your left but as a song leader
[52:06] we we
[52:08] we get we can we can get so uh like this
[52:11] is the way it's supposed to be right
[52:13] like this is how it's supposed to happen
[52:16] why do that to yourself why hold
[52:19] yourself back from that
[52:21] and i i'm i'm not just talking about in
[52:23] a service i'm talking outside of service
[52:25] right
[52:27] can't just bring in the service right
[52:29] the life is out there right that's
[52:31] that's what the spirit is for and as a
[52:33] song leader i noticed that
[52:35] the way the way that you
[52:38] you worship in a service this is just on
[52:40] a a church level here but the way you
[52:44] worship in a service affects all that's
[52:46] around you
[52:47] right it's the atmosphere right
[52:50] so
[52:51] so what i'm getting at is
[52:53] if the holy ghost obviously it's for you
[52:55] and you're overcoming but it's also
[52:58] for
[52:59] the other people right it's for
[53:01] sinners to come home it's you're
[53:03] supposed to be a spiritual hospital
[53:05] right
[53:06] amen
[53:07] we sing that song um
[53:10] we're the lost and the broken bring the
[53:12] burdens and their cares it's like that's
[53:15] what we're supposed to be like this is
[53:16] your house lord right
[53:18] so i was just i was thinking the people
[53:20] around you
[53:22] they're affected by how you're
[53:23] worshiping you're getting involved but
[53:26] at the same time we're not supposed to
[53:27] be worried about this is the hard thing
[53:29] to catch you're not supposed to be
[53:30] worried about that you're just supposed
[53:32] to worship amen he deserves it
[53:34] he deserves our worship
[53:37] amen i was just realizing that when when
[53:40] he he started talking here i am in the
[53:42] service looking at everyone and
[53:44] pinpointing i'm like god when it comes
[53:46] down to it this is just supposed to be
[53:48] you and me right
[53:50] the message is supposed to bring
[53:51] relationship right
[53:54] god and man right and when i'm looking
[53:56] around me obviously there's different
[53:59] instances and i've heard them before
[54:00] it's like i can't even hear what the the
[54:02] you know the minister's talking about
[54:04] you know that can get hard but at the
[54:06] same time there may be there may be
[54:09] someone there that's getting a victory
[54:11] and you're back there in your heart
[54:14] that you're getting you're getting
[54:16] resentment
[54:17] right and you're it's actually holding
[54:19] you back as well right
[54:22] so i mean i'm just i'm just asking you
[54:24] know i'm trying to
[54:27] not bring too much correction tonight
[54:28] but at the same time you know i just
[54:30] found this god corrected me so i i i'm
[54:34] you know i'm guilty as charged but his
[54:36] his blood made me free amen
[54:39] and then by the end of the service there
[54:41] i was dancing i was shouting
[54:43] oh my the brothers were they were
[54:45] bragging on my dance moves i don't know
[54:47] what that was
[54:48] i don't know what that was about but
[54:51] um but even that you know people can get
[54:54] even with that they can get carnally
[54:56] minded like we that's not what it's
[54:57] about that's not what it's about
[54:59] god wants you to worship in spirit and
[55:02] in truth right spirit and in truth that
[55:05] means not just in church
[55:07] in your homes right
[55:10] when you're talking to your your your
[55:12] son or your daughter you're reading them
[55:14] the bible stories giving them the truth
[55:16] that they need to overcome amen it comes
[55:20] down to when there's a situation in
[55:22] church where
[55:24] it comes down to
[55:25] when uh there's a situation as far as
[55:27] there needs there needs to be a healing
[55:29] you need to step out in faith and you
[55:31] need to pray for them right
[55:33] don't be afraid
[55:35] there's there's something within you
[55:37] that that's calling you go do that amen
[55:40] don't hold back don't hold back
[55:43] so
[55:44] let's uh
[55:45] i guess i'll get to the end of here that
[55:47] was just those uh those little things
[55:49] are so exciting for me you know to see
[55:52] when god corrects me i
[55:54] yes it's hard but at the same time i'm
[55:57] like god
[55:58] lord
[56:00] thank you
[56:01] i i am just
[56:03] i am so ugly sometimes i need your
[56:05] purification to just
[56:08] lord just cleanse me lord i just i get
[56:11] so
[56:12] so carnal amen
[56:15] my mind
[56:16] so that's uh that's just a simple prayer
[56:19] i've been uh seeking the lord for for uh
[56:22] just a little bit here but um
[56:26] let's see college i'm just going to
[56:28] mention this a few things here
[56:31] college made me realize i'm in nursing
[56:33] school right now but college made me
[56:35] realize how
[56:36] evil this age is
[56:38] yeah
[56:39] i went to a baptist school in high
[56:41] school and it wasn't uh near the things
[56:44] that i get
[56:45] in
[56:46] in
[56:47] in college i mean the pressures that i
[56:49] feel
[56:50] and um just the forces that are
[56:52] constantly working in the classroom and
[56:55] even when they talk you know it just
[56:57] it's uh it gets uh
[56:59] they get so
[57:01] so evil you know and uh
[57:03] it's not you know it's not them it's the
[57:05] spirit of the age you know
[57:07] and i've got to understand that so i can
[57:09] be more of a light right i can't just
[57:12] bash these people and say they're gone
[57:14] just like i love sister jennifer's
[57:16] testimony they're having compassion for
[57:18] these people which is what
[57:20] my dad's been preaching having
[57:22] compassion
[57:23] let the holy spirit reign in your life
[57:26] let them reign in your life and have
[57:28] full control
[57:30] amen
[57:31] amen so uh
[57:33] i have this last quote and i probably
[57:36] i'm probably going a little short but
[57:38] it's my first sermon so give me a break
[57:40] give me a break um
[57:43] first last quote here i love this one i
[57:46] just found this a couple months ago but
[57:48] that's the way
[57:50] it is with every born-again christian
[57:53] and i believe that when you're born
[57:54] again you've received the holy ghost
[57:57] right amen
[57:59] when he really gets into god he watches
[58:02] his life with god's word and he realizes
[58:05] he's lined up with every bit of it
[58:09] he's got long suffering
[58:11] gentleness
[58:12] quietness meekness power faith love joy
[58:17] peace he ain't tossed about like a
[58:19] troubled sea he ain't worried about
[58:21] every little thing he ain't jumping here
[58:23] and there
[58:25] like like a bottle stopper on the windy
[58:27] ocean he is set
[58:30] his heart is pure
[58:32] his thoughts is pure
[58:34] his intentions are pure
[58:37] his alternative is is right
[58:40] and he he knows he lines up with the
[58:42] word of god
[58:44] all hell can't move him
[58:47] he's lined by the word of god he's got
[58:49] divine love purity in his heart forever
[58:53] for every man and woman
[58:55] he's got
[58:56] he's he's
[58:58] he's abstained from the things of the
[59:00] world
[59:01] they're dead to him he don't want them
[59:03] to no more
[59:04] amen that's why i was just a beautiful
[59:06] picture of the holy ghost there
[59:09] and
[59:10] you can just think of this the opposites
[59:12] of all those things opposite of love
[59:14] long suffering gentleness just those you
[59:17] can reverse that and say
[59:19] you know
[59:20] lord if there's any of those things in
[59:22] me god purify let that holy spirit
[59:24] within me god lord let the word just
[59:28] just completely purge that out of me i
[59:30] don't want any of it amen
[59:32] and god he cares about the little things
[59:34] too don't think that
[59:36] you know
[59:37] your time doesn't your time doesn't
[59:39] matter to them or you're you know just
[59:42] the little things of life your little
[59:44] white lies or different things he he
[59:46] knows he knows
[59:48] so don't don't uh think that god's not
[59:51] watching you you uh you keep lord let
[59:54] reveal yourself to me reveal the bad in
[59:57] me so the good in that you place within
[59:59] me can come out and it be expressed
[1:00:03] so those are just a few things tonight
[1:00:06] as the musicians would come
[1:00:09] even with the holy ghost
[1:00:12] i was just realizing i was looking back
[1:00:15] uh isaac used to tell me all the time
[1:00:17] but i love this analogy of just
[1:00:20] just a boxer and a rink right he's in a
[1:00:22] rink right
[1:00:24] and uh as a new boxer man you get you
[1:00:27] you get whaled you get
[1:00:30] you get you get hit to the ground over
[1:00:32] and over
[1:00:33] amen
[1:00:34] i love that too you always get back up
[1:00:36] right you always get back up amen but
[1:00:39] not only that but
[1:00:40] after a while you start studying your
[1:00:42] opponent you start studying the devil
[1:00:44] right i believe that is the character of
[1:00:46] god right you start studying of god
[1:00:49] studying studying the word you start
[1:00:51] knowing all the devil in his devices
[1:00:53] right
[1:00:54] so i started i was like so now i can
[1:00:57] look over the you know
[1:00:59] left you know left uh dodge or whatever
[1:01:02] and give him
[1:01:04] give him a good uh
[1:01:06] punch there i mean that's what i want to
[1:01:08] do amen we've got the power to do it by
[1:01:10] the word amen
[1:01:12] amen so those are just a few things
[1:01:15] tonight um
