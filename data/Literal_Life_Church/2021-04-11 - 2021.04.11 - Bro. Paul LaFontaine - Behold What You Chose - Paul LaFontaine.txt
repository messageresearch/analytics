========================================

nation uh under looking at both kings that were anointed by the same prophet and come under the same uh anointing of god and yet there's so such a different choice and one choice is by the people and one choice is god's choice so we find in here a tremendous lesson not only in the message in our in in the last days message and things that have happened in the message and things that have transpired in our history of maybe 60 70 years now in the last days message we see so many things played that has played out but this also would be a subject that has so much to it that we examine ourselves and examine our own lives examine the choices that we make it is so important that we come to the place to say lord i really want your choice in my life because i know what my choices can get me in and i want to really surrender surrender thank god they sang the song i surrender this morning because that's what it comes down to is trusting god's choice and waiting for god's choice before we would choose something that god would even bless god would anoint and god would say go ahead and do it but it's not god's choice and i trust you learned something a couple weeks ago but i want to continue because there's so much revelation related to the story of david and saul and so just to have a care for those who maybe didn't hear it and to bring you up a little bit saul was the people's choice david was god's choice but both choices were approved by god both kings were anointed the same way with the same anointing oil that went on their head both were both choices were under the same prophet under the same message there are two different forms of leadership one form of leadership that the people chose i want this type of leadership and one that god says this is the leader that i want to give you to lead your life and that's significant in our lives because we can choose the thing that leads our lives and influences our life and then we know that god has his choice of how our lives are led praise the lord so god let them have their choice because they wanted it so bad and then he warned them of the type of leading of their life that what it would do and they still wanted it after god warned them we have been blessed in the last days to receive a message of restoration and in that message of restoration we have seen a restoration of truths that have been lost many of them hundreds of truths that have been lost through the church ages have been restored to us through the message of the last days but one very important truth that we lost that got restored as brother branham preached it and anointed ones at the end time one of the great truths that was restored is the truth that the rain the holy spirit the anointing can fall on the just and on the unjust the rain can fall on the just and the unjust and that was in the bible but we didn't realize how deep this truth was to realize that you can have the rain falling and some of the things that it's falling on is false it's not right it's false doctrine it's a false vessel and yet they can be anointed under the same holy spirit as the true thing that's a hard thing to swallow we actually wonder why would god anoint something like that why would god do it well a lot of the reason is because the people choose something and they want it so bad god says all right go with it and god says i'll even anoint it but it's not my choice but the rain falls on the just and the unjust and this is the thing that we learn and anointed ones at the end time there's so many things that can be done under even the true anointing but they may not be god's perfect choice can i say that again there are so many things that can happen under the anointing even in this message but are they god's choice or not jesus said it when he says false christ will arrive as rise in the end time and christ means the anointed one so false christ which teaches us and he said the spirits would be so close in the last days it would deceive the very elect if possible but the elect won't be deceived because she receives a revelation of what's the true and what's the wrong but it's not here's how it is we because we've been taught this and this truth has been restored we in the end time cannot judge something just by the anointing of it we cannot judge things just because it's blessed we have to think deeper than that we have to seek god deeper than that can you say we cannot live on just a feeling that we're good with god we can't live with when uh when the hair stands up on our arms sometimes in the presence of the lord that's fine and we enjoy it but we've got to live deeper than just an anointing can you say man we cannot trust just because something is anointed we have to go deeper to say god i surrender to your choice and your will because we realize somebody can be completely out of the will of god and still anointed for a service praise the lord stick with me today i believe that we can learn something so it's it's so close and christ anointed one and that word in the bible is christ plural not one christ but many anointed ones many christ and so it's not the anointing that's false it's the vessel that's false and many times it's the preaching that's false somebody can be preaching false doctrine and get up and pray for somebody even prophesy and the prophecy come true and yet the vessel's faults are what he preaches his faults now i don't understand all of that but all i know is god simplified it for me when he says the rain falls on the just and the unjust and over time we will see the results just like with saul and david over time we will see who was the people's choice and who was god's choice in this message we will see over time what was people choosing their own way of the message and david rising up christ in the message and we're starting to see it more and more and more and i am rejoicing i'm excited i could some after last sunday i could just run the aisles of what god is speaking to us why because we're seeing david the anointed rising up god's choice for what should be the leadership in this message not man's leadership not dictatorship can you say amen not an angry man like saul not a man that disobeyed god like saul but god choosing for his people true pastors true leadership christ rising up in the message can you say amen so it a person let me just move on from that subject of knowing once because that just keeps going on but when a truth is given to us we don't judge it by the prophecy or how anointed it feels we judge it by the word of god and this is solemn david it's a great example with saul and david because both were anointed under the same prophet as we we preached to you so it is too true today not only to situations within our ranks and around the world but it's true to our lives is that god when we want something so bad god actually lets us have it if you even pray for something so bad god actually can let you have it and let it and he lets it go and then we begin to live with those things in the message we live with those things that's the people's choice instead of god's but but thank god he raises eventually he raises david up there's a christ there's a david of this message i hope that's not mysterious to you but there's a david that god raises up eventually and god anoints and in the midst of all the the mess that saul caused thank god for his grace that he sends us to david because if we're left with saul the people's choice we'd be in trouble if you're left with your own choices in life even as a christian you're in trouble come on raise your hand and by god's grace in our lives he lets us go on he lets us go on he we see the results of the choice there's time there that even in saul and david's life and we want to get into it down the road as we have time but you see there was a season that god chose saul because the people's choice there was a season that he anointed david but he wasn't king yet and so saul and david were there and conflicts began all these conflicts begin between the two leaderships going on and then eventually god faced saul out completely and finally we get to see what david's leadership is like all those phases all those cycles can even happen in your life that you begin to look upon your choices down the road and you see oh god forgive me that was my choice back there now i'm living with this god forgive me god raise up the david in my life let christ rule and reign in my life hallelujah so it's true to our lives and after a season god raises up his choice of leadership for our lives and uh so i want to talk about today i want to talk about behold what you chose behold the king you chose samuel is saying i want you to start beholding the kind of choice that you made behold the king that you chose because god was saying i want you to stand back and i'm going to by the grace of god do that look at the choices we make behold the king you chose and uh then the conflict between saul and david and the conflicts that we have between the will of god between us fighting for our own way the jealousy that was be from saul to david and then finally if we can get to it talking more about saul being taken out of the picture and the people submitting to david as a true leadership finally submitting to god's choice after years i don't know how many years it was i think it was two before david was anointed saul reigned two years and then we've had the many years of exile of david and the tension between them so i don't know i'll have to look that up how many years it was but there's many years that that reflects our lives can you say amen and we come to the place of what a full final surrender to god's leadership in our lives and we we start to finally submit to god's choice after many years now as we look at our own lives i like to bring it down where we live as we look at our own lives god gives us grace with our own choices god says i'll let you have it i wish i wish god would uh just come at the beginning and just slap me in the face you know for so many things in my life that i wish god would have come and just slapped me and said here is my will this is clear this is distinct and just stop the whole process from the very beginning how many would say amen to that i wish god would just sadly say do this and i would surrender and do it but god never works that way in our lives because he doesn't force you to do anything god doesn't override your free more agency he didn't do it with adam and eve and brother branham says it's not fair if he would start doing that now it's not fair under the same basis as adam and eve you're he said today you're under the same basis as adam and eve you have free moral agency you have your own choice you have choices to make in your life who you're going to marry what career you're going to have as you come to a young team you start to get more choices you get liberties to make your own choice and then through life as parents you're making choices every day what do i allow what do i not allow your choices choices joy you can get weary parents can get weary of the choices they have to make and then they get teenagers and they get very very weary of the choices they're having to make in the process of raising teenagers and uh strung out just weary of it because you have to make calls all the time and you have to really begin to depend on the lord but i wish the lord would just come at the beginning and say this is what you're supposed to do and do it but god has never worked that way in our lives god will not work that way in our lives if we're fighting for a way and a choice our only he's going to give it to us he's going to give it to us he's going to let us he's going to let us go and and deal with our own choices and he won't override our choice our lord jesus is a gentleman that's what brother branham referred to he's a gentleman and he he's got that gentleman even when he was in the prayer line with the people he said the holy spirit's a gentleman he just he's not forcing anything can you say amen what are these people that are leaving you know the truth and saying i was forced to do this i was forced to do that before that it wasn't the holy spirit forcing you to do it maybe human got involved there maybe a parent somebody got human and maybe they were forcing you but i want to tell you it never was the lord jesus christ forcing you to do anything now he may present a picture he may do like he did samuel say if you choose this this is where you're going he may warn you he may put the whole picture before you but he will never force you to do anything and override your override your will and override your free war agency he lets us go can you say amen that's the way the nature is of the holy spirit he's a gentleman and so god did not drive you away from the message god did not drive you away by forcing you to do anything you know if you feel that you have been forced i would here's what i would do is that give the message another chance give the holy spirit another chance shut out all the past and say i'm just looking at the lord and what he wants in my life and look to him and get a fresh look at the holy spirit a fresh look at the word of god a fresh look at the message of the hour because if you begin to feed on the word and get close to the holy spirit and deeper you'll find the gentleman of the holy spirit works with you a completely different way there's no force to this there's no pressures to this except for the pressure of of us living a godly life suffering persecution because people will make fun of us that's going to come with it can't guarantee that it won't it'll come with it amen and so this truth then runs through the whole bible then eve took her own choice she brought adam in to make the own choice over god's word and how to do it the only way to try to fulfill the way they chose their way to fulfill the word multiply and replenish the earth god's way was through the spoken word of god he made her own choice through the serpent's influence eve made her own choice through the serpent's influence to bring god's promise to pass by her own choice this is all through the bible abraham and ishmael abraham and then abraham had ishmael and ishmael was not god's choice ishmael was their own choice him and sarah ishmael was not god's choice can you say amen and later in their lives we see the conflict and the contrast between ishmael and isaac until in one stage in abraham's life he took ishmael and held him up before the lord and said oh that ishmael may live before thee please accept him the promise is supposed to come please take ishmael and god said no that's not my choice we bring our decisions and choices and so bad for god to accept it but he said no that's not my choice jacob and esau jacob was god's choice esau was not god's choice as the as the as the one to receive the blessing one is god's choice joseph and his brothers joseph was god's choice his brother's attention came over time and over time god showed his own brothers who god's choice really was a long time it's all through the bible of men making their own choice for something and the brothers getting jealous of god's choice of joseph but you couldn't change joseph was god's choice and it took them years of hardships to finally realize i submit i submit to god's choice i just want you to notice that it's not a choice in our lives of choosing god we choose god that's not what i'm talking about it's a choice of his will in our lives over our own will you talk about israel and saul and david they weren't unbelievers they're the children of israel they're already serving god they're already worshiping god i'm talking about people within the church that are already worshiping god i'm not talking about the choice you made to start serving the lord and get salvation i'm not talking about i'm talking about the choice you make every day between your choice and god's choice the message to the last days has come to us with a a special call to a total surrender i said it last a couple of sundays ago nothing less than a total surrender and the thing of a total surrender does not fit in this age at all a total surrender to god in the word does not fit for this age at all it's a challenge but the message is this way the message which you feed on it is nature this way calling for a total surrender and it's such in contrast to the nature of the age that it's difficult for people they get caught in between the message was sent the way that it was sent from god because it came in a church age where the people exercise their own choices so much they take or leave what they want of the word of god i'm going to be very straight for the next 5 ten minutes and uh you you can listen i'm not expecting too many amens but i've got to say a few things it's a it's the laodicean age which means people's rights people's rights later seeing and that's not the world as much as the church literally was the church world people christian people exercising their rights i have a right to do this i have a right to do that i have a right to wear what i want to wear i have a right to then guess what you do it's a free country you have a right to do it you can claim your rights as an american you can claim your rights as a human being that's what the whole thing teaches us don't override the rights of the people and we're thankful for that in our country that we have a right to worship god the way that we want to worship can you say amen we're thankful for that our laws are set up that way but when you come to serving the lord then we realize if you start exercising your own rights as an american it doesn't fit when the holy spirit's trying to take you to a deeper life you're trying to try a political freedom that you have to the word of god and it just doesn't go together because he will love you when you come into his atmosphere he will love you and move you and and just brood over you and love you to a place of a complete trust and a complete surrender it's a different it's a different atmosphere it's a different thing and so then god sends us a message that calls for this surrender in so many at so many levels our sisters in what they wear our brothers and how they rule their homes our marriages our families our what we believe what we don't believe the message came right in the middle of people's rights it's almost like god has a sense of humor i'm going to send a message right in the middle of the spirit in the church of people's rights and exercising them i'm going to do it the way that i want to do it i have a right as an american to do it and i know the message would say that but i want this and guess what god says go right ahead go right ahead you can choose that you can have it you can watch it you can wear it it's a free country and then the message comes and out of love he just says but this is my choice for what a woman wears so now this is struggle god gave his choice through a prophet god said this is the way this is the definition of modesty and then the world's over here and they've got the church this definition of modesty can you say man and god's not going to come over and say get rid of that you're getting no no that's not the way he works but it is a difference it's just god's choice and he loved the women of god this last generation so much that he was so specific say here's my choice from the for the lovely women of god for the last days right in the middle where a woman exercises her own rights as it were exercises her rights to wear what she wants to choose to have an abortion or not it's all about i choose this even to kill a baby how far can choice go in people's rights in laodicea that's how far it goes we have a right to choose whether we want to have a baby or not but there's a lot of other rights that are being taken away from us isn't that funny you give that woman a right to choose whether to abort that baby or not but you don't have a choice whether you take this medicine or not it's all messed up and it becomes more and more corrupt all the time we got to find our hope and our trust in our walk with the lord and as you sang this morning take me deeper that's got to become a prayer in your life get away from the people's rights and say god what is it that you want from my life can you say man we need christians today we don't need christians that are nominal christians they're just exercising their rights every day we need people to say what does the words what is god's choice for what i do is that okay with everybody and then brother adam he's a bit he's not nervous but he when he says things and i may read a few of them this morning but uh just a small quote you guys don't have it up there this is i'm pulling this out of where he's talking about women's dress he said a woman wearing immoral clothes indecently she is to be judged at the judgment bar as a street prostitute that sounds awful strange and that's what he said that sounds awful strange read choosing of a bride that says i don't know if i should say this or not i don't know but we got to speak truth you know and he's this seems awful why is it strange people's rights but he's bringing if you start studying the word of god he's dead on you don't dress yourself right and you draw a man's lust you're just as guilty as his lust if you intentionally do it to draw lust now you're not responsible for what he does but you're responsible for you and he says you'll be guilty for adultery just like the bible says he's guilty for adultery for lusting after a woman but you presented yourself that way so a woman standing saying i have a right to wear anything i want to wear or not wear anything i want to wear go ahead you can come here to this church and wear things that's not right but you're probably going to hear the truth on it it might be uncomfortable sometimes you're going to lean a certain way and the service will lead away and god will warn you no doubt better stop leaning that way you can paint your toenails different colors and your fingernails different colors than a natural color you can trim and cut your hair and tight skirts and shorter and shorter skirts all the times it seems like tight skirts more and more eyeliner more and more makeup caked on see-through blouses i just want to let you know that's your choice you can come it's your choice but it's not god's choice i love you and also please don't assume that brother paul allows those things just because somebody goes to the church like that i don't i believe that god gave us his choice of what a woman should wear and i trust them men can feed on movies and pornography and excite their lusts come right to church bound by pornography privately looking at things that they shouldn't look at whether it be through the wrong kind of video games or the wrong kind of tv that they're watching and they're exercising they're right i'm going to have this uncensored tv in my home or on my phone you can still be coming to church get under the anointing all these other things you can watch extreme violent videos and play those games and be a gamer instead of choosing the right type of entertainment but you're going to know that's your own choice that's not god's choice for your life just remember that you yeah do you have a right to do it yeah but that's your own choice and a man that lets his wife do these things and stay silent about it you need something deeper in your life you didn't feed on the message enough to know that your wife is exercising her choice to wear what she wants to wear and cut what she wants to cut and not god's choice and you're letting her do it you need a deeper walk with the lord my brother you can come to this church and we have them here but don't ever think that that's what we preach from this pulpit you can come to the church believe the prophet and you will enjoy the anointing that falls but here i want to let you know you can wear earrings you can cut your hair you can wear pants still believe the message there's so many of them now you can pay your tithes to a message church and cut your hair no one's stopping you from doing that you should know that's your choice but it's not god's choice let's bring a positive here just and show the power of redemption that first quote that we have up there amen praise the lord it's not just the dress i talked a couple sundays ago about parents who choose their own leadership to raise their children in the message that's just as bad as someone wearing the wrong thing it's their own choice how to want to raise their kids but the word is god's choice and the message is god's choice amen so many things i talked about preachers in the message and even outside the message but in the message and they abuse their people even with the god's anointing on them to preach but they've made their own choice how to lead the people with a soul-like leadership so just like a girl that chooses their own choice of what to wear that preacher's just as guilty when he chooses under the anointing of the message and under the prophet to choose to lead the people in a either a dictatorship or some type of anger or something like that brother that if you're listening that's your own choice that's not the david of this message that's not the christ of this message but brother brahma says now he give us free moral agency if you guys have that quote in um right here in the breach he's given us free more agency it was given to them just as we so as we so to make a choice now adam and eve in the beginning there was a tree of right and wrong before them and the same tree sets before each and every one of us see god isn't doing for adam or eve you say well it's their fault no now it's is it it's your fault you can't place it on adam now you place it on yourself because right and wrong set before you we're on the same basis as adam and eve but you see when we are redeemed listen close now when we are redeemed we no more want our own choice but we want his choice what a powerful quote what a thing that shows the power of redemption over our lives and you may not be all there yet but if your soul has been redeemed you're growing into the power of redemption now some preachers say at that moment that's it it's done but to me the way that i preach it is that a person can be born again and redeemed and they begin a life of growth in the lord they don't get everything they're not perfect a perfectly matured son right there at the altar i disagree with that respectfully to brothers i say when you get the holy ghost and the conversion and god redeems the soul you begin a life of overcoming you haven't overcome anything yet you just started an altar i've got what i need i've been redeemed in my soul but the power of redemption grows you into a son of god who finally says lord i no longer want my own choice i want your choice lord you know how i know that because of experience i've had people they've got the holy spirit they follow many things are taken from their lives it's a wonderful thing but then i watch them in a struggle of exercising their own will over things do i do this do i do that and so they begin a journey of are they going to listen to god's choice or choose their own choice and if they choose as a christian if they choose more and more of their own choice they'll watch the fruits of it for years grace grace grace watch somebody sometimes after 20 years just go through the ringer they didn't have to but they did and then they rise as i was preaching last sunday they rise out of all of that david rises in their lives and they say lord i surrender and he says those are redeemed they no longer want their own choice but we want his choice now adam and eve wanted their own choice they wanted to they wanted to find out what it was that wisdom so they probed into it and it caused death now when a man has been redeemed he don't care anymore for scholarship he'll carry more for the things of the world can you say amen when a man's redeemed he don't care for the things of the world or scholarship the wisdom of the world he don't want no choice at all christ has been his choice and that's all of it he is redeemed he just no more wants to lead himself he don't want nobody to talk him into where to go or what to do he just waits and finds out the choice of his maker oh can i go back and read that again he just no more wants to lead himself he don't want to lead himself he don't want nobody to talk him into where to go and what to do he just waits and finds out the choice of his maker see then he goes in the name of his maker when the maker tells them to go see but man seeking wisdom wants to find well this parish is pretty good but they pay me more over yonder so i'll go over there notice the example brother branham uses a very natural example this is a preacher and he's considering taking a parish over here and he's weighing this decision based upon just the money and a lot of us do that where is the more money at but i have watched people make choices solely on an increase in funds but no consideration of their family's spiritual life no consideration of where they're going to go to church no consideration how it might affect their spiritual life justice more money and sons of god cannot make decisions just based upon money because if you're in the will of god you may not get a promotion or more money but if you're in the will of god you're the most blessed person on the face of the earth you might live from paycheck to paycheck but if god has given you revelation you're a rich man your family's rich people we must say god what is your choice and he says maybe i can go over to this parish and this parish would pay me more money over here and they weigh all those decisions but you know then he says pay me more i understand i'll go over there see wisdom and when adam's sin be heeding his wife's reasoning instead of the holding to the word that's what made adam sin his wife reasoned with satan and then produced the product adam and adam turn loose the word and sold out never forget that quote in the breach it says redeemed sons and daughters of god no longer want their own choice they want god's choice god help us can you say amen we're all believers i believe here we all believe the message of the hour but that's not what i'm preaching i'm preaching on a daily basis saying god what is your choice for my family the word of god say about it so number one let's get into this real quickly you can give me a little time today so if he says to behold your choice now why don't we get into this now behold your choice number one we know if we're going to behold the choice that israel made let's talk about what they mean they made their choice upon outward appearance can you say man what is seen not what's unseen so if you're back there in first samuel if you go back there again you read very familiar scriptures about that when they were choosing samuel excuse me saul when samuel was choosing and you don't forget now the reason they were looking for a guy they had already been influenced by watching what kings were in the other nations so their choice was influenced by what do the other nations have what what are the other people doing what's the what's the new modern thing how what kind of leader do they have what do they wear how tall are they what do they look like are they good looking are they ugly so i'm going to get on the internet i'm going to google it i'm going to find what are the i we want a choice for a king can you imagine a choice for a king to lead you under jehovah god and you're going to get on google and the internet and find now what's the other nations doing let's get some influence of what they're wearing i got to make a choice when i go to the store of what i'm going to buy to wear let me get on and see what angelina jolie has been waiting lately let me see what all the other people are wearing no no that's what they did we can't make our choices based upon that and so they chose as you turn with me for first samuel chapter 9. first of all verse 20 verse 19 of first samuel eight never let the people refuse to obey this voice of samuel and they say nay but we will have a king over us that we also may be like all the other nations we have looked it up we have researched this we have googled it i've been to all kinds of websites and this is the type of thing that we need we need it this way because all their influence of their choice they have their own choice but it was influenced by all the other nations and that our king may judge us and go before us and fight our vows and samuel heard all the words of the people and he rehearsed them in theirs of the lord and the lord said to samuel hearken unto their can you imagine this statement underline it in your bible god says for the prophet to hearken to their voice look how much god is willing to just okay they want it so bad they've they've fed on things so much hearken they're supposed to be hearkening to god's voice and god says go ahead and hearken to their voice what they want praise the lord and make them a king and samuel said unto the men of israel go ye every man into his house familiar chapter nine verse one and there was a man of benjamin whose name was kish the son of abal the son of zehor zohor the son of bakarath and the son of a fella and benjamin a benjaminite a mighty man of power and he had a son whose name was saul a choice young man and a goodly and there was not among the children of israel a goodlier person than he from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people all of it is about what's visible i wish i could preach this to are you listening choices made only on what's visible we can't look to the scene we must look to the unseen because the things that are seen are temporal but the things that are unseen are eternal but my brother and sister you can apply that scripture on your everyday decisions we can judge things and make choices this is what i see even at trial and we can quickly make choices but say god no lord i need you to lead me in this because see i can make a choice being a current problem and what's visible let me move on here because i'll get to that in a minute a choice young man a goodly young man so basically it can sum up uh saul and their choice for saul he was tall dark and handsome if you research the words there there is no character there there is no heart there there's no there there's not one line about his character there's not one line about what's in his spirit there's not one line anywhere about it now interesting in a minute you're going to find that it looks like similar things in david but i'm going to show you it's not because he mentions outward things as well but in this just remember there's not one ounce of in this choice of any character or anything how it's going to affect them or what's in his spirit there was a lot of stuff in his spirit jealousy was in there envy was in there anger was in there disobedience was in there and none of them could see it but god did because they were saying this guy is basically head and shoulders above the rest when we looked at the whole crowd of thousand people this guy stands head and shoulders above all the rest so he must be the king to lead us just because he's tall dark and handsome and he was when you research it he had dark complexion like all the jews all all the other ones a darker complexion like all the other men in that day and the women that's what they were okay they were they had that dark skin so in that those features he was the same and that's probably why they chose him in his features and his head and shoulders above the rest he was the same as everybody else so he'll be a good king he was the same that's not necessarily a good choice to make he's a blender he's a mixer brother brown says people choose pastors because they're a good mixer they'll let them do this and then they mix with the people they mix with the things of the world no you don't judge it just because he looks like everybody else what is in the heart amen tall dark and handsome and i'm not so sure some single girls don't use the same choosing method method tall dark handsome oil well but does he own a bible does he know what church he belongs to does he treat his mom what's in that boy's heart but he's tall dark and handsome oil well i mean he's got rich incredibly successful and he's got a lot of money and it's it's all outward look at the car that he drives why am i trying to be practical because this is the way many of us make choices nothing unseen you won't know what's unseen same guy is tall dark and handsome beautiful head and shoulders while the rest works out got all the muscles all those other things same guy that's so strong in his muscles may be completely weak in what he watches on the internet and you go into that marriage and he's bound by pornography and you think you're going to have a normal family relations and sex not going to happen it's going to be trouble down the road but you didn't you wouldn't know that until you get to know the fella and watch his life and watch a girl's life can you say amen a lot of you sitting here married the wrong person you married what i'm preaching about a lot of those things young marriage many times and you made mistakes god's grace has redeemed you here this morning can you say man but young people sometimes think well nobody no no there's people who've been there done that got the t-shirt they made the wrong choice they're they're in a divorce today or another what and so it's it's a difficult thing when you realize but when you go back and behold the choice you made you can say i was making choices based upon just feelings and what felt good and what looked good and and all these other things no heart no character so if you turn with me oh did i finish that so he's tall dark and handsome and so over in chapter 12 in verse 5 nope that's not it over in chapter 16 verse 6 when he goes to choose jesse's sons and it came to pass when there come that he looked on eliab and said it's one of jesse's sons surely the lord's anointed is before him but the lord said unto samuel look not on his countenance or on his height of stature because i have refused him for the lord seeth not as man seeth that's why we need god's choice for the lord seeth not as man seeth for man looketh on the outward appearance but the lord looketh on the heart and i think it's deeper than just he's got a good heart he's tall darker handsome but he's got a good heart i mean i dropped my fork off the table and he come right by right away and he picked the fork up for me and he set it back on the table and just said god bless you he's got such a good heart about him he's one of the greatest christians i've ever seen well how long have you known him well i just met him there but he's just one of the greatest christians because he picked up my fork kind of smiled at me he was so loving i'm not talking about just somebody with a good heart that gives to charity and works hard i'm talking about a heart that today has the holy ghost in that heart has god on the throne of their heart so god says man looks different than what god does for he look at the network appears but the lord looketh on the heart he goes through a few of her son other sons then they set for david verse 12 when he sit and brought him in brought david in now he was ready and with all of a beautiful countenance and uh goodly to look to and the lord said arise anoint him for this is he saul was tall dark and handsome but david was short red and fair so he wasn't because he had fair skin he wasn't like all the rest of them the way he looked he was different he was fair-skinned he was short brother brahm describes it even more and this is the part i like in praise of redheads brother bram says he was a red-haired freckled face little stoop shoulder little boy can i say something in praise of redheads i know a lot of mine's gone it's changed to another color but when i was you asked my mom when i was 13 years old i had bright red hair and many times it was very long because my mom actually liked it long thinking about that one she hates when i cut my thing real short she's like you got curls you should show some of those curls and but what i there's a picture in wisconsin when i was like nine years old and i had an afro of red bright hair my mom wanted everybody to see it why because it's rare it's beautiful you know the price that arab kings give for a bright red-headed girl they're talking a lot of oil wells a lot of cows a lot of a lot of things they do they buy them because it's why because it's rare from all the other women of their nation it's rare so you see this arab king and he's got this bright red-haired girl or blond-haired girl but the red is real rare when i see redheads we have any here today anna's not here today is she but boy when i see my compliment wherever they're at say red hair is rare where oh hannah yes hannah he knows i've said it to her beautiful red hair rare i can't believe there's not more guys never mind i'm like telling some of the guys you know that come around you're missing out man what are you doing it's like wake up i mean that too you know what you know what it is about those girls they're not they're gonna they're gonna kill me for this we got some older girls in the assembly they're not old but they're older than the 16 year olds it's not just that they're beautiful girls but their spirit and their love for this word and their consistency and their faithfulness to this word and working for the house of god has been unprecedented what i've seen for years it's we've got some lovely lovely older young people and guys in this assembly but girls like that that held the standard for all these years are to be appreciated praised and thanked can you say man [Applause] and red-haired freckled face so it's redheads are special because they're they're rare they're rare and i shouldn't i guess i've spent enough time on this but the freckles and all that i just david was this way so i mean it's very spiritual more special than the rest of you there's something unique about it i hated my freckles you know that i hated my freckles i used every type of ointment and every type of oil they weren't called essential oils but they were essential to me and i had to buy them to get rid of these freckles it's been 30 40 dad i got to have this and put it all on i got to get rid of these things because i so had such a complex about my freckles i hated them and so i would use these ointments and one of them one day i put it all over my whole body and the next day i had more freckles waste of money dad said you waste my 40 bucks and let this go god made you with freckles but i hate freckles i hate freckles so quickly because you've heard this story before first two questions to my rebecca that i was interested in do you have the holy ghost number two what do you think about freckles second question that's in that's not in the message or anything but that was my question and she goes in her southern accent i love freckles i said great let's do it good to go god gave me a girl that loves freckles she loves them she thinks it's handsome she thinks it's beautiful she loves my freckles and it's not only rare to have a red-haired freckled person it's rare to find somebody who likes freckles so i was all over that spending way too much time on praising freckles and red hair hey give me my moment here you know it doesn't get praised enough in this world praise the lord this is what david was brother brown said he was that way short he was strong but he was short and god did not judge them even though you say he says goodly and beautiful countenance and all these other things it looks like it's all outside but they're giving the distinction in saul and the outward appearance this would not be a person that the people would choose this is not your most handsome person on the internet that you would choose to be a king so if you're looking for outside things david wasn't the person but god was looking at that man's heart and because israel wasn't looking at the the inside but the outside god said i'll have to help you i'll have to help you choose somebody and if you young people pray god will help you can you say man choose something that's more character than just the outward looks and just your emotions and your passions i want them i want them i just want to be with them no it has to go deeper if you'll trust the lord if you'll pray then he'll help you choose he'll influence your choice the word will influence your choice but david he was ready he was he was short he was uh he was short red and fair that's what those words mean there he was fair-skinned he was red skinned and he was fair skinned which is very rare in that day because all the people were dark skinned and so this is how god says but he looks at the inside mentioned something's about his countenance his eyes in the in the hebrew his eyes were just set a certain way and that's just deeper than tall dark and handsome you know what's in a person's eyes didn't brother branham look at the way israel's choosing jim brother man says choosing abide the kind of woman that a man would choose the quote choosing a rabbi the kind of man that a woman she would choose will reflect his ambitions and his character do you guys have that quote if a man chooses the wrong woman if it reflects his character and what he ties himself to shows truly what's in him a woman reflects what's in the man when he chooses her for a wife it shows what's down in him no matter what he says outside watch what he marries i go to the office man's office he says he's a christian pinups all over the walls and old boogie woogie music going on i don't care what he says i don't believe his testimony because his spirit is feeding on them things of the world what say if he would marry a chorus girl or what if we marry a sex queen or just a pretty modern raketa it reflects it shows what's in his mind what his future home is going to be because he's took to her to raise he's took her to raise his children by and whatever she is that's the way she'll raise those children so it reflects what's in a man a man that takes a woman like that shows just what he's thinking of the future could you imagine a christian doing a thing as that no sir i could not a true christian will not look for such beauty queens and chorus girls and sex queens he'll look for christian character now you can't have all things there might be a girl that's real pretty and the other girl maybe she her stature looks better than this one and you might have to sacrifice one for the other but if she's not the stature of a lady of a woman and she i don't care whether she's pretty or not you better look at her character whether she's pretty or not pretty now for it is becoming if a christian would choose a wife he ought to choose a genuine born-again woman because of what she regardless regardless of what she looks like it's what she is it's what makes her and then again that reflects his own godly character and reflects what's in his mind and what's going to be in his future his family will be raised by such a woman for the future plans of his home sorry for reading through this quickly but it's a large quote if he marries one of these little modern ricketts sex queens what could he expect what kind of a home could a man expect if he marries a girl that ain't got enough moral about her to stay home and take care of her house and wants to work out in somebody's office what kind of a housekeeper will she be you'll have babysitters and everything else it's true i can go with and then he goes down later he says i'm not much about this modernistic take taste of women working in a lot of cases these days it's re you have to do it out of necessity but he's not not against putting him out there in all the man's position taking positions from men taking jobs from men that the men should have and not the women he's not wasn't for them being in out all the offices and all these other things and he goes a little down down a little later in the quote and says i used to go with a rancher that i work with to buy cattle and i noticed the old fellow always looking right in the face of the heifer before he went bidding then he turned her head and looked back and forth i followed him and watched him and he looked her up and down and she looked all right the stature then he turned and looked her in the face and sometimes he'd shake his head and walk away say jeff i want to ask you something i said jeff i want to ask you something he said say on bill i said why you always look that cow in the face i said she looks all right good heavy cow said i want to tell you boy you got to learn you got a lot to learn and i realized that after he told me said i don't care how she's made up she might be beef and plump to the hoof but if she's got that wild stare in her face don't ever buy her said why so jeff well said the first thing is said she'll never stay put and he said the next thing is she'll never be a mammy to her calf and said they put here her in a pin now the reason she's fat you turn her loose with that wild stare she'll run herself to death and i said you know i kind of learned something i believe that applies to women too the whole congregation there is laughing quite a bit and choosing of a bride at this point they're laughing quite a bit he said i believe that applies to women too right you know he's right in los angeles saying these things you think that's by chance that god had that prophet preach choosing of a bride not only with the bride that god chooses but of a young man who chooses and he does it right in the hub of perversion of hollywood that's god friends i'll do it right there and he says i kind of learned something that wild staring raketa look you better stay away from her boy all that there blew stuff atop her eyes and i didn't i wouldn't want that i don't think that's becoming to a christian i don't care how much the television and paper and magazines and internet i don't care how much it says that it's pretty it's the most horrible looking hideous sight that i ever seen in my life and the prophet says the first time he's seen it in a store or in a restaurant he asked his fellow what is that i never seen that before and he says can i pray for her he says i've been foreign countries i see people with diseases does she have a disease can i pray for that's how it was of a shock it was what in the world is she coloring around her eyes for why she emphasized why is she doing that she looks sickly to do it she does it because the world says it's pretty. but my dear sisters that's your choice but it's not god's choice number two israel number we talk about number one choosing based upon what's seen number two following the crowd the motive for choosing this king is to be like other nations so their choice was heavily influenced by caring with others this is what they do so this is what i want this is what the nations do so this is what i want comparing themselves with other nations and i'll just be short on this part because i've already been preaching basically about it you should never make choices based upon what the crowd is doing what the internet is doing and what even some people that are wearing or doing in the message no no don't compare yourself with anybody else look to the word of god look to the word look to god's choice you might be 13 years old today young girl but i love you and as a gospel minister you are beautiful to god don't let the world and friends and people you see influence you to be something different than the way god has made you you are beautiful in the sight of god just the way he made you and brother ram talks about a woman and putting a little color there sometimes she said i i think that would be all right problem is i don't say that a lot because sisters not sisters but that girls will take it oh he said that then he'd just been cake on the make it it's wrong to kick out in the make it and make yourself look different than the way god made you you won't find that in the older godly sisters here in this is the images of sisters living that they're beautiful to the lord beautiful branch of the lord don't let other friends and the world tell you what's pretty look to god and say god you've already made me beautiful i am fearfully and wonderfully made let me not be intimidated you made me beautiful i know you maybe don't like the way you look most of you don't most guys well guys like the way they look but girls they're intimidated why did i have to have this why did god make this but god made you that way for a purpose god gave me my freckles for a purpose so my wife could enjoy them you say well i'm not very beautiful well your husband your true godly husband is going to think you're gorgeous just the way god made you so he made you that way for god and to be a testimony to god but he made you that no doubt for your husband to enjoy because to him and to god you'll be the prettiest woman in the world it's not in my notes this is all free this is extra don't compare yourself with others i don't know what time it is right now i don't really care ten to one all right ten to one o'clock so they were influenced by the other nations i think you get that they were influenced by other things influence from the crowd they made choices based upon following what all the other nations had i want a king i've got to have them and i want to have them just like the other nations now the last the third thing here is that trials and afflictions influence our choices too so what was number one i forgot i'm going to go ahead and read it choice is based upon outward appearance and what's seen and what's not unseen i'm trying to make this simple for you this morning number two choice is made upon following the crowd and what the rest of the world and rest the rest are doing that's not a good basis to make your choices and number three making choices through your trials and afflictions and things that you're going through be careful the decisions you make during trials because israel did the same thing because the bible says that that the enemy was gathering and there was something happening and they starting to feel the pressure and they thought well if we don't get a king we're not going to be able to make it through this this great thing that's going on this enemy coming against us if we don't get a king we need a king right now we need to do it right now and sometimes in our trials and the enemy moving in on us we will make choices in the midst of those trials and that's what israel did we got to have them now and we got to have them like the rest of it but it's because they are under pressure be careful of the decisions you make under pressure you still need to look to the unseen and not the scene can you say amen and here in our text we'll go back as we bring it to a close this morning if you go back in the scriptures up there to second corinthians 4 i want to refer to how he's wording it here and i just found this this morning and added it in but i thought this was great i know the scripture says look to the things that while we look to the things that are unseen and not to the things that are seen for the things that are seen are temporal but the things that are unseen are eternal second corinthians chapter 4 starting at verse 15. all things for your sakes that the abundance grace through the thanksgiving of many rebound to the glory of god verse 16 for which cause for which cause we faint not if we get pressures if the enemy is rushing in on us listen we don't give up faint not means to give up it says we're not going to do that we're not going to give up we're not gonna we we faint not because of the grace of god we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day so now the way that you need to look at this the way that christians need to look is look to the unseen and that is when you look at your trial or the enemy rushing in or the afflictions that's come into your life when you look at it you have to keep in mind the revelation that the outward man may perish but the inward man is being renewed can you say amen day by day if you lose sight of that you'll make the wrong choices remember i said last sunday prophecy can be being fulfilled even after jesus was dead there was a prophecy over his life so you hit a crisis in your life you hit a affliction in your life and you'll start making choices based upon what you see but you got to realize the word the inward man is still being renewed every day if you're in the word if you're getting yourself to service if you're staying in that you think nothing's going on the unseen what's happening in the unseen the inward man is growing day by day and yet you're got this trial you've got this thing that we're man is perishing not only our minds sometimes we feel like it's perishing our bodies brother ray and i say this because we're always moaning with each other about our that we're not 20 years old anymore the outward man is perishing day by day and if you get really down by that oh lord the outward manners person not just the physical but our emotions can be down our mental condition can be down the pressures of finances the pressures of of the economy and we haven't reached the end of this i'm telling you friends a good thing that we got the lord to depend on because the economy is going to change i'm not a prophet but things are going to change we haven't seen hard times yet and this is a good scripture because we got to remember the outward man may perish but the inward man is growing day by day and that's when we're looking to the unseen the outside the economy crashes all that's going on we don't know what biden's going to do next or the government or whatever we don't know what's going to take place next and i'm not going to get political but i can tell you there's more times coming that we're going to have to use this scripture i'm looking today at the unseen and not what i see and the unseen says that if i'm staying in the word there's there's something happening put that scripture over here there's something happening in the inward man that i can't see but it's happening it's happening another the one before that the outward man perishes day by day oh this is the next one for our light affliction oh man i'm closing now friends but i love how paul calls this our life and trials a light affliction you can almost get angry at that it's light it don't feel light to me the things that i bent through were not light but in comparison to the exceeding internal weight of glory it's nothing to god and so he calls it a light affliction i challenge you i challenge you when you go through a heart-heart trial to say this is just a light affliction this is no big deal why because it's and here's another funny part for every line is anointed for our light affliction which is but for a moment some of us was like it wasn't for a moment didn't feel like a moment felt like 10 years it was 10 years but what is he preaching this is the way we need to look at it when we're looking to the unseen that light affliction that happened five years ago light affliction and it was just for a moment it's not being truthful when it looks at what really happened but it's being truthful in the way god looks at it it's the light affliction just for a moment bang it was over but when you weigh it it's working for us a far more exceeding and eternal way to glory and when you look at it that way then you can call it a light affliction oh praise the lord brother paul you're preaching to me today i think that preaches to everybody i think we can all apply that can you say amen you'll always have afflictions and sufferings and and all these other things but the way we look at it is don't be like israel say we've got to have a king we've got to have king be careful the decisions you make during your trial look to the unseen something greater is working and all this is working to a far more eternal weight of glory not say we need a king we need to do this we need to make this decision we need to change this be careful in the decisions you make in trial remember abraham when he got to famine went down into guerrilla went down into egypt because he got under pressure from the economy and he didn't have anything to feed his family and when he did it he got out of the will of god he should have stayed in his homeland and when he got out of his homeland he got in trouble why did he make the choice to get out of his home land because there was a famine in the land he got nervous he wouldn't have anything to eat do you honestly think you're going to starve when you're in the homeland not going to happen god's going to take care of us god's going to supply don't make decisions too quickly or too hastily brother branham says especially during the times of affliction especially during the times of trials behold israel your decisions behold your king that you chose this is the basis you told him chosen this is the reason under pressure you look into how he looks there's so many lessons is anybody learning anything out of this and it goes on and on there's so many lessons in this i see myself you see yourself is that the choices we make lord i want if i have to wait a little while before i get something i want to wait because i want to know that it's your choice whether it's to marry somebody whether it's a choice of a car to drive could it be that we could take everything to the lord in prayer and say father you have a choice for this i look to your word but i need your direction what is your choice sons of god that are redeemed of god have come to the end of this thing of a life as a christian i'm going to do it this way i'm going to have it this my past has been influenced by somebody forcing me to do something that's done today i'm finished with that every parent needs to examine their choices and the priorities they have in their life for their children because what priorities you set is the top and most important thing you're going to trickle down to your children it's going to trickle down choices you make what's the priorities in this home what's the priorities in this life as for me and my house we'll serve the lord he's number one being in the word is number one i want to teach my children that that's priority everything else may unravel everything else is secondary and they are important they're probably important things but i want my kids to know everything is secondary to the word of god and my walk with the lord i might fail at a certainty i might not reach this goal i might not make it to this or do that it doesn't matter the inward man needs to be renewed every day you love the lord amen i'm all done can we stand and pray together let's practice a song from this friday lord we dedicate this temple to you send your fire upon the altar and make our hearts new we will glorify you father in all that we do lord we dedicate this temple to you lord we dedicate this temple to you send your fire upon the make altar hearts new we will

dedicate this temple to you may my choices be so influenced by the word of god that we would make your choice lord in each thing based upon the word of god forgive us many standing here including
