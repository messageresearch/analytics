[0:00] amen I believe there is a people today
[0:02] amen that are following him taking up
[0:05] their cross and amen it's good to be
[0:07] here and certainly a privilege to to be
[0:11] with you and an honor to speak to to the
[0:14] young people and and hopefully with the

[0:19] as brother Branham said to to put
[0:21] courage in your heart amen that's what
[0:23] we want to do and I especially want to
[0:24] thank you brother Paul for the
[0:26] invitation this week not necessarily for
[0:28] preaching all these services but uh amen
[0:31] for uh for being here in the fellowship
[0:34] we've had together I believe it's good
[0:37] for the ministry to to be in unity
[0:39] together
[0:40] and believe that amen if there's ever a
[0:43] time that called for the unity of of the
[0:46] ministry it's this hour amen because
[0:49] amen we're at the end time I was telling
[0:51] the church the other day that you know
[0:54] um we are literally at the end of of of
[0:57] the time and we are speaking which could
[1:01] be the last services that will be spoken
[1:03] and how important it is for us to to
[1:07] listen to receive to react and and to do
[1:11] that and because God does nothing in
[1:14] vain
[1:15] I don't believe this service is in vain

[2:07] of God and I pray Lord that you would
[2:09] just speak in a special way tonight with
[2:12] your help we ask in Jesus name amen
[2:15] amen God bless you if you just turn in
[2:18] your Bible perhaps to a familiar
[2:20] scripture to you judges the eighth
[2:23] chapter
[2:25] and
[2:28] let me just speak to you for a moment on
[2:31] the scene that is happening here
[2:37] how many love the word
[2:39] amen
[2:42] amen word is our strength
[2:45] amen
[2:53] and let's go to the sorry let's go to
[2:56] the 18th verse and this is Gideon that
[2:58] is speaking
[3:00] then he said unto Zeba and zalmuna
[3:05] what manner of men were they
[3:08] whom ye slew at Tabor and they answered
[3:12] as Thou Art so were they
[3:15] each one resembled the children of a
[3:17] king
[3:19] and he said they these they were my
[3:22] brethren
[3:24] even the sons of my mother as the Lord
[3:26] liveth
[3:27] if you had saved them alive I would not
[3:30] slay you
[3:32] and he said unto jether his firstborn
[3:36] up and slay them
[3:39] but the youth
[3:41] Drew not his sword for he feared
[3:44] because he was yet a youth
[3:47] in Zeba and zalmuna said
[3:51] rise thou and fall upon us for as the
[3:54] man is
[3:55] so is his strength
[3:58] and Gideon arose and slew Zeba and
[4:01] zalmuna and took away the ornaments that
[4:04] were on their camel's necks
[4:07] then the men of Israel said unto Gideon
[4:10] rule thou over us both thou and thy son
[4:13] and thy son son also for you have
[4:15] delivered us from the hand of Midian
[4:19] and Gideon said unto them I will not
[4:21] rule over you neither shall my son rule
[4:25] over you the Lord
[4:27] shall rule over you it can be seated
[4:30] may the Lord bless the reading of his
[4:32] word
[4:37] I am
[4:40] I was looking at this a while back and
[4:44] the scriptures always spoken to me where
[4:47] Gideon has asked his son to
[4:51] take his sword and and and slay the
[4:54] enemy and
[4:57] when he wouldn't do it because he was
[4:58] afraid
[5:00] these Kings said
[5:04] ask Gideon to kill them because they
[5:06] said as a man is
[5:08] so is his strength
[5:11] that's what I want to speak to you this
[5:13] evening I'm going to title it that as a
[5:15] man is
[5:17] so is his strength
[5:19] what he has in him
[5:21] is his strength
[5:24] I believe it's God's desire to put
[5:27] strength in US
[5:29] that's why he's always worked his the
[5:32] scripture says that I would you were in
[5:34] health and prosper even as your soul
[5:38] prospers even Ahab a wicked King when
[5:41] when the prophet spoke to him and said
[5:43] that the syrians are going to come back
[5:46] and go strengthen thyself prepare
[5:48] yourself to meet the enemy God has
[5:51] always provided a strength for his
[5:54] people
[5:55] the word is our strength amen when
[5:58] Abraham was was getting old and he was
[6:01] waiting upon the promise to be fulfilled
[6:03] and he was he he forced 25 years he
[6:07] waited and he waited upon the Lord and
[6:09] God appeared to him and said I am the
[6:11] almighty God walk before me and be thou
[6:14] perfect now he told this to an old man
[6:16] and brother Branham says that God was
[6:18] telling him now draw your strength for
[6:21] me and what was he doing he said he was
[6:23] preparing him for the miracle that God
[6:26] was going to do in his life God has the
[6:29] provided strength for every one of us
[6:31] this age amen what we're going through
[6:34] your personal struggles your personal
[6:37] life your family life your the family
[6:40] you came out of that none of that God
[6:42] has already measured that in to this age
[6:45] and what you're dealing with and he's
[6:48] already provided what you need to
[6:50] overcome it
[6:52] praise the Lord
[6:54] brother Branham said in in Jehovah Jireh
[6:57] he said if I could ever get the
[6:58] Pentecostals to recognize their sons and
[7:00] daughters of God and Heirs of Abraham
[7:03] then no devil or thing can hold his
[7:05] people
[7:07] nothing can hold them now uh um and I
[7:11] quoted this this morning I want to quote
[7:12] it again he said that he said we need to
[7:15] be stable we need to know where we're
[7:17] standing he says now you can honestly
[7:21] sincerely be stable you can be a stable
[7:24] Methodist you can be a stable Baptist
[7:27] Presbyterian a Catholic and be stable
[7:30] but don't be stable in your church
[7:33] doctrine
[7:34] be stable in the Bible Doctrine examine
[7:39] your doctrines by the Bible ask what
[7:41] Jesus was if he isn't the same today
[7:44] then your Doctrine is wrong
[7:47] how many believe that
[7:49] man this this scene that I'm reading and
[7:51] I'm
[7:52] um I I I I just want to if the help of
[7:55] the Lord maybe incorporate a couple
[7:57] testimonies in there if I can but um uh
[8:00] you know we look at one another I think
[8:02] we need to help one another help one
[8:04] another up
[8:05] we live in the age of of talking about
[8:08] one another and blasting out everybody's
[8:10] failures or what we disagree with one
[8:12] another on and that's not what we should
[8:14] be about we should be about helping one
[8:16] another up
[8:18] amen and so this event that I'm reading
[8:21] to you is closing out the struggle
[8:24] between Israel and and Midian
[8:29] as Zeba and zalmuna are the kings of
[8:33] Midian
[8:34] previously already the princes of Midian
[8:38] orb and Zeb have already been terminated
[8:43] and thus the rulership of this nation
[8:46] that is tormented them for seven years
[8:49] is coming to a close
[8:52] Gideon is standing here now with these
[8:55] rulers subdued in front of him
[8:59] and he's standing there and this is why
[9:00] he asked them the question who were
[9:02] these men that you killed
[9:04] and and he said they were men like you
[9:06] they look like a king They Carried
[9:09] himself like kings and he said this was
[9:12] my family
[9:13] this made Gideon a blood Avenger
[9:17] and and he said I wouldn't have killed
[9:19] you but you've messed with my family
[9:24] and so I want you to keep in mind the
[9:27] spiritual aspect of it Gideon turns to
[9:30] his firstborn son jether
[9:33] which means abundance
[9:35] and he told him
[9:37] amen rise up and draw your sword
[9:42] and slay these Kings
[9:44] I want you to notice that Gideon is
[9:47] asking his son to carry out my desire
[9:52] for you are expressing my blood link
[9:56] you're my firstborn son and I want you
[10:00] to take part
[10:01] in the victory
[10:03] that has already been won
[10:07] I want to say it again
[10:09] I want you to take part
[10:12] in a victory that had already been won
[10:17] Gideon wants his son
[10:21] to be what he is
[10:25] getting the Mighty Men of Valor
[10:28] Gideon didn't know this
[10:32] it took God to tell him who he was
[10:37] but here this has always struck me
[10:39] brother Paul because here stands a young
[10:41] man
[10:42] fully equipped
[10:44] to carry out his father's desire
[10:48] fully equipped but what kept Him from
[10:50] drawing The Sword in that day of
[10:53] consummation was his own fear
[10:57] and so instead of rising up and
[11:00] finishing what had the enemy had brought
[11:02] in upon Him amen he stepped back and
[11:06] refused to take apart in what he was
[11:08] being asked to do
[11:10] listen we're not having Youth meetings
[11:12] like this just to have fun though it is
[11:14] fun and just to come together it is
[11:16] because God is equipping you in this
[11:19] hour to carry out what this generation
[11:22] is called to fulfill amen I once was a
[11:26] youth and said in a chair like you but
[11:28] now our years have have gotten away from
[11:31] us
[11:32] right brother Samuel
[11:34] amen we're getting older we're not the
[11:37] last generation there's a generation
[11:39] coming up behind us amen and you are as
[11:43] fully equipped as a generation before
[11:45] you and God has placed everything in
[11:49] your hands that you have need of but
[11:51] what it takes is a strong hand of Faith
[11:53] to take what God has provided because
[11:56] this sword no matter how sharp it is in
[11:59] the hand of faith it takes a hand of
[12:01] Faith to drive it to the heart of the
[12:04] enemy you're going to take anything
[12:06] tonight it must be by faith
[12:12] he's placed his son in a position
[12:16] strike the last blow
[12:18] at these Kings
[12:22] you know it could have been this kid it
[12:24] could have been Gideon
[12:26] amen I'm going to take all the glory for
[12:28] myself but I I want my son to share in
[12:30] the victory
[12:33] I want my son to know what it's like to
[12:37] stand Victorious over rulers
[12:42] principalities and powers of Darkness
[12:45] that once ruled over families and even
[12:48] generations of families
[12:51] held them in fear and kept them back
[12:54] kept them thinking they couldn't
[12:55] overcome
[12:57] I want you to strike the last blow
[13:01] Don't Be Afraid these kings are already
[13:05] defeated you're only carrying out what I
[13:09] have already done
[13:12] Hallelujah
[13:15] Ephesians 4 8 says therefore it's said
[13:18] when he ascended on high he led
[13:20] captivity captive
[13:22] in other words he let a train of
[13:25] vanquished foes amen and he bestowed
[13:28] gifts on men amen Christ already
[13:31] defeated the enemies that we are
[13:34] fighting Amen in this hour every disease
[13:37] amen every afflicting amen lust and
[13:40] passion all the perversion that we're
[13:42] dealing with this in the age and some of
[13:45] these things become Tangled not amongst
[13:47] the people and you don't know how can
[13:49] God do how can he deliver God has
[13:52] already vanquished him
[13:55] he's already vanquished him he's not
[13:57] asking you to do something he hasn't
[13:59] done
[14:00] nor is he asking you to do something you
[14:02] cannot do
[14:08] Hallelujah
[14:10] I remember
[14:14] one time I
[14:16] hope this is all right I was
[14:18] in Africa
[14:21] while I was there and some of you might
[14:23] have heard this story before but I think
[14:24] it goes well with this
[14:27] a friend of mine who was a bushranger
[14:30] over there he would conduct classes
[14:33] for the Rangers to go through certain
[14:35] stages
[14:37] and the last stage of training for the
[14:41] Rangers was called sleeping with the
[14:44] Predators
[14:46] Hallelujah
[14:48] and I was privileged to go with him on
[14:50] the last class I didn't get to get all
[14:52] the other steps
[14:53] they just took me on the last class
[14:56] to sleep with the Predators and they
[14:58] literally
[14:59] put you in a position where the
[15:01] Predators come into your camp and and
[15:04] you get to Fellowship
[15:07] so what I remember about this
[15:10] Brothers
[15:11] this this Ranger he was a brother
[15:14] it was him and then it was me and a
[15:17] minister friend and another truck and
[15:19] then it was four other gentlemen in in
[15:22] another truck so there was three trucks
[15:23] before before we went out on this this
[15:27] camping trip
[15:29] um uh we had a house service well these
[15:31] four gentlemen were workers way up in
[15:34] the um in the oil fields I think
[15:36] somewhere in North Africa and then they
[15:38] came here and and they was in the house
[15:40] meeting then they were going to go with
[15:42] us on this this camping trip and and I
[15:44] remember the day that we got up to do
[15:46] that one of the brothers he was a big
[15:48] strapping South African gentleman he was
[15:51] tall he might have been six four six
[15:53] five big and strapping I remember him
[15:55] talking to me he said you know he goes
[15:57] I've been in the bush many times and he
[15:59] goes when I'm out there he said I wear
[16:01] and he he told me what kind of knife he
[16:04] straps on and he goes he goes they call
[16:06] me Rambo
[16:09] well he said Rambo
[16:11] and uh
[16:13] and so
[16:15] the day of of sleeping with the
[16:17] Predators comes and out he comes man and
[16:18] he's he is dressed to the nines ready
[16:22] for the Predators
[16:24] I don't know what a big knife is going
[16:26] to do but but he has it on and he's he's
[16:29] totally equipped
[16:31] and
[16:33] what the the ranger said he said what I
[16:37] do
[16:38] you must do also
[16:41] he said when I'm driving you drive if I
[16:44] stop you stop if I go don't stop you go
[16:49] so we get out in the bush and we're
[16:52] driving
[16:53] and and as we're driving we're we're
[16:56] going on through the bush and we get in
[16:58] the middle of a bunch of elephants now
[16:59] we're not in a zoo
[17:02] okay where you can walk away from the
[17:05] cage
[17:05] there's a bunch of elephants and they're
[17:07] starting to cross the path well as
[17:09] they're coming there's an opening there
[17:11] and the brother he just guns it he goes
[17:14] right on through the minister brother
[17:15] who's driving the truck I'm in he just
[17:17] goes right on through but these brothers
[17:19] that are carrying Rambo Rambo sitting in
[17:22] the back of the truck he's not in the
[17:23] cab he's in the back with another
[17:25] brother and and they they don't punch it
[17:29] and go through they just drive up real
[17:31] slow to the opening and when they got up
[17:33] there the elephants crossed over and so
[17:35] they had to stop so now Rambo and his
[17:38] friends are surrounded by elephants and
[17:40] if you've been around African elements
[17:41] uh elephants they're big
[17:44] and you could hear you could hear
[17:46] branches breaking you could hear the
[17:48] trumpeting of the elephants and I'll
[17:51] never forget the ranger we pulled up
[17:52] around around the bin and the ranger got
[17:55] out of the car and he slammed his hand
[17:56] down on the on the top of the hood and
[17:58] he goes I told them to do what I said
[18:03] because they didn't listen
[18:05] so then we'd drive to the camp the
[18:08] brother had took out a half of a zebra
[18:12] and Drug it around the camp to put the
[18:14] scent there and and we're at a water
[18:16] hole and so we're going to wash these
[18:18] animals and he put us all on shifts all
[18:20] night long that we would take shifts
[18:22] watching because even though you're
[18:23] going to sleep with the Predators you
[18:24] don't actually want to sleep with them
[18:26] right
[18:27] so we won a couple guys there to if they
[18:29] get too close you know Shine the Light
[18:33] and so we're you know so we would take
[18:36] one hour and a half shifts and two of us
[18:39] at a time
[18:40] well Rambo had talked to me and I can't
[18:42] I'm calling him ramble because I can't
[18:44] remember his name
[18:45] so I just call him ramble but he said
[18:47] they called him Rambo so I'll call him
[18:49] Rambo and and when he got out of that
[18:52] truck after that elephant experience
[18:55] his demeanor his way he carried himself
[18:58] had totally changed
[19:01] he'd turned white
[19:05] and he looked at me and he goes it was
[19:08] very skinny
[19:13] so he had
[19:17] an excellent
[19:18] go into the camp and we're there and
[19:20] we're waiting because lions and and
[19:22] hyenas and all that you could hear them
[19:24] out in the bush and and they're supposed
[19:26] to come and sniff the dead animal and we
[19:29] praise the Lord get to look at them and
[19:32] and so but the whole time we've taken
[19:35] shifts or an hour and a half and then we
[19:37] sit there and watch amen these these
[19:39] Brethren that sat in the back of the
[19:41] truck and they were very scared they
[19:43] never went to sleep at all they just
[19:44] kept shining their light like this the
[19:46] whole night long they never slept Rambo
[19:49] had totally changed and what happened
[19:51] fear ruined the experience of the camp
[19:56] one man's fear
[19:59] they even told me I had laid on the
[20:01] ground and was sleeping and they told me
[20:03] he said you know a red Roman just
[20:04] crawled right to you and and uh and and
[20:07] I'm like well thank you well red Roman
[20:09] looks like a tarantula it's it's big and
[20:11] and you can see the tracks right where I
[20:13] had slept it was right came up right up
[20:15] here and then it just continued on right
[20:18] on this other side this thing crawled
[20:20] right over the top of me and they said
[20:21] we watched it
[20:23] foreign
[20:24] you know I'm tired of just being
[20:26] informing what's going on around us
[20:30] man if you're equipped
[20:32] in your Rambo
[20:36] at least save me from a spider
[20:40] well I'm saying that to say this you can
[20:43] look the part
[20:44] you can have the equipment you can sing
[20:48] with the angels but if you don't put
[20:51] into operation what he tells you to do
[20:53] amen you are not going to be able to
[20:56] stand the experience
[21:01] and here here is jether now if you've
[21:03] read his story you'll find out this is
[21:05] his defining moment this is where we
[21:08] hear of him and this is where he comes
[21:10] into existence and this is where he goes
[21:12] out of existence
[21:13] amen because you find out because he was
[21:15] afraid amen uh Gideon had 70 Sons one of
[21:20] them was was from a concubine and that
[21:23] man's name was abimelech and that man
[21:25] rose up and wanted to be the ruler and
[21:27] he killed all of the sons except the
[21:29] youngest which means the firstborn died
[21:31] with all the rest in that Scourge but I
[21:34] often wondered what if that boy hadn't
[21:37] got the courage at that moment to draw
[21:39] the sword and destroy those kings that
[21:43] laid in front of him amen his the next
[21:46] chapter of his life would have been
[21:48] different
[21:51] and God brings moments like this into
[21:53] our life to confront something
[21:57] amen that you might be afraid of and
[21:59] even in their stature and in their
[22:02] rulership is greater than you amen but
[22:05] God said I'm asking you to draw the
[22:09] sword and strike the final blow
[22:13] blessed be the name of the Lord
[22:16] takes a strong hand of faith
[22:18] this was his firstborn son you're the
[22:21] Church of the firstborn
[22:23] and God doesn't ask you to do something
[22:25] you cannot do
[22:27] for what he asked you is not tied to
[22:29] your ability
[22:33] but it's tied to his word
[22:36] that's why any experience we have must
[22:39] go back to his word
[22:42] amen amen our birth amen must come from
[22:46] the word
[22:47] I remember when the Lord called me at
[22:49] the age of 17 to preach I was in prayer
[22:51] you know it's a good place to have
[22:53] communion with the Lord is while you're
[22:55] praying
[22:56] and I was in prayer and it was it was
[22:58] close to midnight it was somewhere it
[22:59] was really late in the night and and I
[23:01] was praying and the Lord just spoke to
[23:03] my heart and says you're going to preach
[23:05] the word
[23:07] and and I remember just in my heart just
[23:09] speaking back says no no I'm not
[23:13] and he never said any he only said all
[23:15] he said right after that he said acts 5
[23:18] and he named the verse and he said acts
[23:20] 5 in the verse and I didn't know what it
[23:22] was
[23:23] but I was having an experience
[23:26] but I didn't know what it was
[23:28] but I hear in his voice tell me you're
[23:30] going to preach and he gave me the word
[23:35] well then I went and looked at the word
[23:38] because you can hear a voice
[23:40] you can have an experience but if it
[23:43] doesn't line up with the word
[23:46] God doesn't ask you to hang on to
[23:48] something that's not of him
[23:51] so when I went back and looked at acts 5
[23:53] 19 it says the angel of the Lord came to
[23:56] them by night and told them to go stand
[23:58] in the temple and teach the words of
[24:00] this life so what the voice told me was
[24:03] confirmed by the words it wasn't my
[24:06] imagination I didn't dredge it up and
[24:08] ask it to happen I didn't even know what
[24:10] that scripture said I don't want to tell
[24:12] you any experience you've ever had go
[24:15] back and find it in the words because
[24:18] once it's in the words
[24:21] once it's for you find it in the word
[24:24] Satan cannot take it from you
[24:28] any experience you've ever had amen he
[24:31] can take from you because that's his
[24:33] nature but when it comes back to the
[24:35] word
[24:39] Hallelujah
[24:44] I wanna
[24:46] I just want to take this thought from
[24:47] this statement of the King as a man is
[24:49] so is his strength your strong is what
[24:51] you have inside of you
[24:55] strength is measured in different ways
[24:58] actually in spiritual if we try to live
[25:00] this in our own strength you'll find
[25:02] your strength is tied to your ability
[25:05] which God cannot use
[25:08] Amen brother Branham said Moses offered
[25:11] God his own ability
[25:13] and God couldn't use one thing that
[25:16] Moses offered
[25:18] of his human ability
[25:21] the Bible said in the book of Acts that
[25:23] Moses was a man Mighty in word indeed
[25:25] learned in all the wisdom of the
[25:27] Egyptians and he cannot use it
[25:31] and he can't use yours
[25:34] Paul said I had to forget everything I
[25:36] ever know
[25:38] to learn Christ
[25:40] this was a man that was steeped in the
[25:42] scripture concerning Zeal of Pharisee a
[25:45] Jew of the Jews
[25:48] a teacher of the Old Testament
[25:51] and he had to forget everything he knew
[25:56] Hallelujah
[25:58] your ability gets in the way of the will
[26:00] and power of God
[26:02] but faith is tied to God
[26:07] God's not even wanting to use your faith
[26:13] brother Ram says your faith is no good
[26:16] we need his faith
[26:18] when the man at the gate beautiful was
[26:20] healed it wasn't by Peter's faith it was
[26:23] in the name of Jesus Christ and by the
[26:25] faith of Jesus Christ that that man rose
[26:27] up and walked
[26:29] so that means Jesus Christ is here to
[26:32] work outside of your ability and put in
[26:35] you his own power
[26:39] praise the Lord
[26:43] and this is what the story of Gideon
[26:44] highlights to us is in Prophecy
[26:48] it's highlighting the work of Jesus
[26:50] Christ
[26:52] the strength of God flowed through the
[26:54] weakness
[26:56] not the ability of Gideon
[27:00] because Gideon really will find out was
[27:03] afraid
[27:04] and if anybody could teach somebody else
[27:06] about fear it was Gideon
[27:10] and now that same trait is coming to his
[27:13] son of fear
[27:15] you see it Carries On
[27:17] just like Abraham Under Pressure would
[27:18] tell a lie so would Isaac
[27:22] Vaughn natural traits coming from your
[27:25] own abilities figure it out by your own
[27:27] reasoning extrapolating what's going to
[27:30] happen to you in the future
[27:32] as we've been preaching amen when when
[27:34] Satan comes into your reason and he
[27:36] tells you something Jesus said he's
[27:38] telling a lie and when he's speaking a
[27:41] lie he's talking about himself
[27:43] the fears he's trying to put on you is
[27:45] his own fears it's his own hopelessness
[27:48] he's lost his first estate you've got
[27:51] yours back
[27:55] he cannot be redeemed you can be
[27:57] redeemed he cannot receive the Holy
[28:00] Ghost you can receive the Holy Ghost he
[28:02] cannot be restored you can be restored
[28:07] you're fully equipped
[28:11] I wonder how many of our young people
[28:13] are standing here tonight equipped with
[28:15] the sword
[28:17] in the final battle
[28:19] a battle that's already won
[28:22] I think Satan can stop this Rapture he
[28:24] can't stop it
[28:26] amen he's trying everything he he can do
[28:28] to produce his own body change
[28:31] through all this perversion that's going
[28:33] on in this hour
[28:35] amen trying to teach the young people
[28:37] that they don't need the permission of
[28:39] their parents
[28:40] they want to if they want to transition
[28:42] into another sex and whatever more he's
[28:45] trying to produce his own body change I
[28:46] don't need his permission
[28:49] I don't need his permission to leave his
[28:51] Camp I don't need his permission Amen to
[28:53] leave what he's trying to place upon Me
[28:55] For Greater is he that is in me than he
[28:58] that's in the world
[29:02] see I found out myself
[29:05] my own self that God don't need my
[29:08] ability
[29:12] amen he needs me to be patient with his
[29:18] I learn patience
[29:21] you know I know that's a dangerous
[29:22] statement to make brother Paul usually I
[29:23] learned patience and you're like oh it
[29:24] means you're totally patient I never
[29:26] said that I said learn patience
[29:32] amen God will teach it to you because
[29:35] patience they that wait upon the Lord
[29:37] shall renew their strength
[29:40] so Gideon himself knew what it was like
[29:42] to be fearful he was a coward and then
[29:44] when God met him and see this is the
[29:46] principle of the message you can find
[29:47] this in the Book of Judges this is the
[29:49] principle of the message this is the
[29:51] only time in the Book of Judges you'll
[29:52] find a prophet coming to the people and
[29:55] and here the principle the message a
[29:57] prophet comes and points him to a God
[29:59] who is the same yesterday today and
[30:01] forever in his mighty power and how he
[30:03] brought him out of Egypt and how he
[30:05] delivered them with his mighty hand he
[30:07] said but you have not obeyed his voice
[30:08] now this is the amazing thing is that
[30:11] they have been living under this torment
[30:13] for seven years God delivered them into
[30:16] that and they were sons of God living in
[30:20] the Promised Land
[30:22] and they went under captivity willingly
[30:32] sons of God captive in the place God has
[30:36] put them
[30:38] what a shame
[30:40] that with all the resources that God had
[30:43] promised to watch over that land and
[30:44] that land will always provide for you if
[30:47] you stay with my word but if you begin
[30:49] to bring the idols in that the other
[30:51] nations have amen you're going to lose
[30:53] that
[30:56] what happened
[30:58] they begin to worship other gods
[31:02] you know it's important to know who the
[31:05] midianites are
[31:08] they are the descendants of Midian who
[31:11] is the son of Abraham
[31:13] from his second wife
[31:15] get her up
[31:18] the Bible says that when his son those
[31:21] Sons got older from that second wife
[31:23] that he sent them away from Isaac
[31:26] and sent them to the east he wanted a
[31:29] separation between
[31:30] amen the promise seed
[31:33] and the the children of the second wife
[31:37] and they sent him away with gifts so
[31:40] they didn't leave with nothing they went
[31:41] away with gifts
[31:43] and and and they lived in the east
[31:47] I think it's a very important note to
[31:48] bring into Focus here that these are
[31:50] descendants of those who had
[31:52] relationship with Abraham
[31:56] but not according to the promise
[32:00] you'll find this nature and every false
[32:02] Doctrine every false movement
[32:06] anything associated with the truth
[32:08] that's not of God they all have this in
[32:10] common they lack that promised birth
[32:15] Midian begins to pop up here and there
[32:18] in the scripture after he sent him away
[32:19] to the east you can find them there
[32:21] they're the ones who who was also in the
[32:24] selling of Joseph uh they took them and
[32:27] and the ishmaelites came and and then
[32:29] and there and then they helped in the
[32:32] selling of Joseph and then you'll find
[32:34] out
[32:35] they're also close relation of course to
[32:38] Ishmael
[32:40] and they both have it in common
[32:42] they both were sent away
[32:46] man their relations with a grudge
[32:52] but you'll find the midianites most
[32:54] prominently in the time of Moses because
[32:56] it's something that when God sends a
[32:57] prophet there's people that rise to
[32:59] prominence in that time because of that
[33:02] influence of that prophet
[33:04] my if it hadn't been for that Prophet
[33:06] you might not ever hear of them
[33:10] right
[33:11] but there's a benefit of God sending a
[33:14] prophet
[33:16] and and you find that when when Moses
[33:20] fled from pharaoh and he went down to
[33:23] Midian he marries the daughter of of the
[33:26] prayer the priest of Midian Jethro
[33:30] and he lives there until he receives his
[33:33] commission to go back and deliver Israel
[33:35] from Egypt
[33:37] and so in that time Israel and Midian
[33:41] have a friendly relationship
[33:45] actually it's very strong ties that they
[33:48] have together
[33:50] numbers 10 tells us a midianite
[33:53] acted as a guide for Israel
[33:56] in their wonderings in the wilderness
[33:59] Moses invited him to stay with them and
[34:02] go into the promised land with them
[34:04] but something happened between Israel
[34:07] and Midian to rupture their relationship
[34:10] that was found in numbers 22.
[34:13] and there Balaam become involved
[34:18] they find this is a spirit that becomes
[34:21] prevalent it's prevalent at this hour
[34:23] and it's prevalent in the church ages
[34:27] is the spirit of Balaam
[34:30] Balaam become involved in this
[34:32] relationship
[34:34] and he he suggested that one of the
[34:38] princes of Midian would use his daughter
[34:40] and connected her with a leader in
[34:43] Israel you see because Satan attacks the
[34:46] leaders
[34:48] and so much did it rupture that
[34:52] relationship that it was the midianite
[34:54] women which seduced the Israelite men
[34:57] and it resulted in a Slaughter
[34:59] in which also Balaam was killed
[35:02] in fact the Lord said Vex the midianites
[35:06] for they Smite and smite him for they
[35:08] vexed you with their Wiles that's the
[35:12] last battle that Moses oversaw before he
[35:15] was taken home was to deal with these
[35:18] midianites the midianites out of whom he
[35:21] took a wife
[35:22] out of whom you've had a relationship
[35:24] with and now he has commanded you Vex
[35:28] them because they have vexed you
[35:32] amen so this is a major separation
[35:35] between these two Nations who are Step
[35:38] Brothers in relation
[35:40] you know Satan is a master at destroying
[35:43] relationships
[35:47] that Spirit of Balaam is still alive
[35:50] and he knows how to connect leaders
[35:54] to bring trouble
[35:57] cause problems in the camp of the lord
[35:59] we all know the story of Balaam Balaam
[36:02] was a hireling prophet he could go
[36:04] either way
[36:06] he could speak the words of God or he
[36:08] could speak the words of man
[36:11] and he was hired by balak
[36:14] the moabites
[36:16] Lots children
[36:18] because they didn't want to have
[36:19] anything to do with Israel coming
[36:20] through their land if they knew Israel
[36:22] was a successful people
[36:24] that God was with him
[36:27] that the power of God was manifest
[36:29] amongst them and signs and wonders and
[36:31] healings and deliverances and there was
[36:33] a prophet there who was carrying the
[36:36] word of God and the shadow of the king
[36:37] is in the camp
[36:40] and so they hired a prophet
[36:43] to come speak something against these
[36:46] people
[36:47] curse them
[36:49] find something bad about Moses
[36:52] find something bad about the young
[36:54] people
[36:55] find something bad about Israel because
[36:58] God is going to have to curse him Moses
[37:01] uh excuse me Balaam tried to do it
[37:05] amen he wished he told he told balak he
[37:07] said I'm going to go ask the Lord for
[37:09] permission and and if he tells me I can
[37:12] I will if he tells me I can't I can't do
[37:14] it so he went and asked the Lord and the
[37:17] Lord says no you can't do it these are
[37:19] my people
[37:22] so he goes back to bed he said I can't
[37:24] do it Bennett said I'll give you more
[37:26] money
[37:30] I give you more money to leave the word
[37:35] I'll give you success
[37:40] he made an offering to a man that has
[37:42] truly gifted truly equipped
[37:46] he was in a position he could really
[37:48] help the people
[37:50] but his appetite
[37:53] his ability
[37:57] so he went back and he said well I'm
[37:58] going to go back and ask the Lord again
[38:00] and the Lord came and he said you go and
[38:03] speak but you're only going to say what
[38:05] I put in your mouth
[38:08] so he goes and as he goes we know the
[38:10] story he's met by an Angel of the Lord
[38:12] and he doesn't see him but his animal
[38:14] sees him
[38:15] right and the animal won't go and then
[38:17] we see Balaam caught into a fit of road
[38:19] rage and he tries to beat his animal up
[38:22] you imagine how horrible it looked him
[38:24] having having a temper fit and he's
[38:26] beating his animal and the animal turns
[38:28] and speaks to him haven't I been good to
[38:29] you
[38:31] you see somebody talking to themself
[38:34] this could be what's going on
[38:36] but that animal saw the angel of the
[38:39] Lord
[38:41] and when because of that action it
[38:43] opened the eyes of this prophet and he
[38:45] saw the angel of the Lord
[38:48] so when he went up and balik said listen
[38:50] let's go over here and I can show you
[38:51] some things about these folks in the
[38:53] message and we can find a place God's
[38:55] going to have to curse them no matter
[38:57] what he saw wrong with them God would
[39:00] not allow them to be cursed let me tell
[39:03] you that's the same God today no matter
[39:06] what flaws no matter what failures you
[39:08] might find amongst the people amen this
[39:10] is God's promise
[39:14] when you reach out and try to do
[39:16] something about it you are touching
[39:17] God's anointed
[39:19] [Applause]
[39:20] could God's anointed have failures can
[39:23] they have backslidings oh yes they can
[39:25] you're still in your human body
[39:27] amen but the shadow of the king is in
[39:29] the camp the word of a prophet is
[39:32] amongst us
[39:33] God is with us
[39:36] this this influence he's he said I can
[39:40] only and some of the most beautiful
[39:41] prophecies in scripture flowed out of
[39:43] Balaam and the king of King balak said
[39:45] listen don't say anything at all you're
[39:47] not doing any good for me here
[39:51] so we went back but Balaam didn't forget
[39:54] and he realized you know what I can get
[39:56] God to deal with him in death
[40:01] I want to tell you God hated it then and
[40:03] he hates it now he hates immorality
[40:10] amen it's not a church flying a rainbow
[40:13] flag and flying in all inclusion and
[40:15] everything God hates immorality he
[40:18] doesn't hate you he hates immorality
[40:21] so he will change your life he'll clean
[40:23] you up you're not out without resource
[40:29] and there was the rift
[40:32] there was this this deep hatred and
[40:35] enmity now between these
[40:37] started
[40:39] when a false prophet
[40:41] a hireling prophet ruptured that
[40:44] relationship
[40:51] Midian is the main figure in Israel
[40:54] against Israel at this time
[40:58] so as we said Midian was a friend and a
[41:00] relative but we're not born of the same
[41:01] promise
[41:05] you know we have a lot of folks leaving
[41:06] the message
[41:09] they'll be friends for a while
[41:13] but there become enemies
[41:16] when balaamism comes among them
[41:19] because the spirit of balamism is
[41:21] looking for someone to teach
[41:28] when the Bible tells us in chapter 6
[41:30] that they join Confederacy this is what
[41:32] Spirits do
[41:34] they join Confederacy with amalek who is
[41:37] the children of Esau
[41:39] who's he saw he's a man who did not
[41:42] value the birthright
[41:45] but he found it easy to sell it out for
[41:48] a moment of appetite
[41:52] there's already been a prophecy over
[41:54] these boys the Elder Shall Serve the
[41:56] younger
[41:58] the prophecy is Holy it's from God
[42:01] Jacob was in line for that Birthright
[42:05] but the mother got involved I trust this
[42:07] is all right
[42:08] the mother got involved
[42:11] and she somewhere along the line because
[42:14] the parents were riffed and they
[42:16] separated in their affections over their
[42:18] children
[42:20] they both amen amen they tried to
[42:23] manufacture what God Said
[42:25] when God had already said Jacob's going
[42:28] to get the birthright
[42:31] when the time for Birthright the promise
[42:33] uh the blessing was to be given amen the
[42:36] church Rebecca knew about it and she's
[42:38] called Jacob in and said listen your
[42:40] father has called Esau and says come and
[42:43] say let's pray he's gonna he's gonna
[42:45] give the blessing he said and she said
[42:47] he's going to go out and he's going to
[42:49] kill and bring venison the venison stew
[42:51] that your father likes I know how to
[42:53] make that
[42:55] and here I got your brother's clothes
[42:59] I'm going to put them upon you
[43:01] and I'm going to make that stew
[43:04] and you're going to take it in and
[43:06] you're going to get the blessing that
[43:08] your brother is supposed to get
[43:11] you see the problem of it is Jacob is
[43:14] trying to get that blessing wearing
[43:15] someone else's coat
[43:21] you all right
[43:22] good can I have your coat
[43:28] it ain't gonna fit me
[43:31] I don't mean that wrong we're just
[43:48] you know sometimes young people
[43:50] we feel like we got to wear someone
[43:52] else's coat to get the blessing
[43:56] you know God did not call me to to be uh
[44:00] uh brother Paul
[44:02] um
[44:09] I've healed the pool
[44:13] I hear the call and I know his spear
[44:20] brother Samuel he never asked me to be
[44:22] him
[44:24] but somehow we feel like we got to have
[44:27] we got to all have the same experience
[44:31] because a church tells us how to do it
[44:34] [Music]
[44:35] and the church knows how to make a good
[44:37] stew
[44:40] and where they're saying if I wear the
[44:42] clothes of brother Paul I'm going to get
[44:44] the blessing of the father
[44:47] I smell like him
[44:50] praise God I got it no you don't get it
[44:57] it's going to cause you a lot of trouble
[44:59] trying to act like somebody else
[45:03] [Music]
[45:04] you think because you shout like
[45:06] somebody jump like somebody run like
[45:08] somebody you got it God never asked you
[45:10] to imitate anybody else he asked you to
[45:13] have your own experience
[45:16] get your own
[45:19] he never asked me to act like brother
[45:22] Paul or brother Samuel or anybody else
[45:24] [Applause]
[45:27] God is not here to give a church birth
[45:30] he predestinates it he predestinates
[45:33] your moment of the Holy Ghost
[45:35] it can't be taught into you
[45:38] come on a mother can put a coat on you
[45:40] and bake up a stew and I don't think he
[45:42] makes stew cook up a stew amen it's not
[45:45] going to give you the Holy Ghost
[45:47] [Applause]
[45:51] you've got to get it by meeting him
[45:55] slowly face to face where God talks to
[45:58] you and you talk back to him if you're a
[46:01] Son of God that's how he meets you
[46:07] it's a nice coat
[46:10] thank you brother
[46:13] one day I'm going to grow into it
[46:16] I remember brother Paul I I did this I
[46:19] was a number of years ago I'm not
[46:21] telling you these things that tell you
[46:22] where I've been I'm telling you things
[46:23] to help you
[46:25] God can use these simple things like
[46:27] this and you don't even know what he's
[46:28] doing
[46:29] and it was 2019 and I was way in the
[46:32] north and India we was in a convention
[46:34] and there was there was a bunch of
[46:35] ministers setting over over on this side
[46:38] and there's a man caught my attention he
[46:39] was big and tall set right on the front
[46:42] he had this nice shiny suit on nice
[46:45] silver shiny suit he's just looking at
[46:47] me and I I can't speak uh their language
[46:50] and and so I'm preaching and brother
[46:52] Roshan is interpreting and I'm talking
[46:54] about Jacob getting the blessing trying
[46:57] to get it and and I they kept getting
[46:59] attracted to that man didn't know why so
[47:01] I went over there and I said man give me
[47:03] your coat he looked at me like I I had
[47:06] asked him to give me everything he ever
[47:07] owned
[47:09] he looked real scared
[47:12] and he took his coat off and again he
[47:14] just stared he never made a smile he
[47:16] never did anything he just gave it to me
[47:18] and I went over to him
[47:21] and I knelt down before him
[47:23] sorry brother Paul I just don't have to
[47:25] do this they need to get awake and so do
[47:26] you amen
[47:30] bless me father bless me
[47:33] the only guyzek was laughing okay yes
[47:37] and and I said and here's a blind
[47:39] prophet being deceived
[47:44] I said God don't want you with another
[47:47] man's coat
[47:48] and that man stared at me and there was
[47:51] a young man in the back this is where
[47:53] the ministers he began to rejoice and
[47:55] Shout I didn't know have a clue what was
[47:57] going on
[47:58] took the coat off he CK yeah help me
[48:01] thank you
[48:03] sorry
[48:04] you take that to the cleaners
[48:06] amen
[48:07] I took the coat off and a man put it on
[48:09] he got up and left
[48:13] thanks for the coat don't leave
[48:19] he got up and left I had no idea what
[48:21] was going on I did not know that man
[48:24] was the Pentecostal overseer of the area
[48:28] and the young man in the back was trying
[48:30] to receive the message and that man was
[48:32] telling him that the message was wrong
[48:34] and I was calling that man a blind
[48:36] prophet
[48:39] and a guy was trying to receive a
[48:41] blessing wearing the wrong coat
[48:45] and just that simple illustration I had
[48:48] no idea that the Holy Ghost was the one
[48:50] doing it that's simple illustration of a
[48:53] man trying to wear another man's coat to
[48:55] receive God's blessing delivered that
[48:58] young man
[49:00] that same God is here tonight that young
[49:03] man might have went up to the meeting
[49:04] and didn't know God had already equipped
[49:07] him to be delivered
[49:11] he'll deliver you because he's already
[49:14] equipped you
[49:18] blessed be the name of the Lord
[49:20] you can't get it
[49:22] wearing someone else's coat
[49:27] he have joined Confederacy with amalek
[49:29] and Esau I won't hold you much longer
[49:31] and the children of the East Ishmael
[49:34] hear all real relatives do you see
[49:37] what's happening here all of these are
[49:38] relatives
[49:40] relatives of Israel
[49:42] someone close
[49:45] tormenting
[49:48] the people of God
[49:51] and the reason their torment was
[49:53] successful was because Israel was
[49:56] addicted
[49:58] to idols
[50:00] Jewish historians said in that time they
[50:03] were so addicted to Idols that They
[50:05] Carried little images in their pockets
[50:07] to take out and look at them once in a
[50:09] while they must have been called eye
[50:10] idols
[50:12] [Music]
[50:14] Hallelujah are and idols
[50:17] you'll get it later
[50:20] can you imagine they they would take
[50:23] them out of their pocket
[50:31] so addicted
[50:34] in the and the and the famine was so
[50:36] severe that it drove Israel out of their
[50:39] homes their homes were were in shambles
[50:41] and they lived in the dens in the caves
[50:44] God sent a prophet in the midst of that
[50:47] idolatry
[50:50] and brother bam said that here's getting
[50:52] behind a wine press trying to thrust
[50:55] some wheat
[50:57] afraid of the enemy because the enemy
[50:59] would come up with camels without number
[51:01] can you imagine the terror that was upon
[51:03] them with these these and these engines
[51:05] of War coming through their places and
[51:08] they were defenseless to fight against
[51:10] sons of God could not overcome lust and
[51:13] could not overcome the things of the
[51:15] world they was helpless in the face of
[51:17] this flood
[51:21] and here they are hiding and Gideon's
[51:24] back here he's hiding but God has sent a
[51:26] prophet and this is the pattern he's
[51:28] used today because if you realize this
[51:31] this hour was so significant in the
[51:33] history of Israel that that when Isaiah
[51:36] began to prophesy about the coming of
[51:37] the Lord he said it would be like the
[51:39] day of Midian
[51:42] go back and read it this will be like
[51:45] the day of Midian what was the day of
[51:47] Midian total victory
[51:53] but it started with conviction
[51:56] a war cannot be won without conviction
[52:01] God don't hand something to you that you
[52:04] don't care about
[52:07] you can have a sword hanging on your
[52:10] side but if you don't know how to use it
[52:11] and you don't care of it
[52:15] it's of no benefit to you to quote a
[52:17] quote
[52:21] the Bible said they came up without
[52:23] number
[52:24] and every time they would have a harvest
[52:26] they came up and would destroy their
[52:28] increase you see that's the
[52:30] characteristic of Satan every time you
[52:32] have a good service
[52:34] he'll come in and hear Robert from you
[52:36] the next day
[52:39] your cause something to happen maybe in
[52:41] relationships something to happen I
[52:43] don't know I'm not somebody affected by
[52:46] thumbs up or thumbs down on on Facebook
[52:48] and everything else I'm not that person
[52:49] because I don't have a profile
[52:52] sorry you don't have to be quiet
[52:56] I didn't condemn you if you have one I
[52:58] said I'm not affected by thumbs up or
[53:00] thumbs down it don't it don't blow my
[53:01] mind that I don't have a hundred friends
[53:05] and I don't worry about a nameless
[53:06] person that I've never met that they
[53:08] don't like me and they disagree with me
[53:11] and don't Hey listen
[53:13] amen the other day I had I had I had a
[53:15] man who used to be in my church he was a
[53:16] minister and he he's left the message
[53:18] and he started texting me at 11 30 at
[53:21] night on Saturday night I had to preach
[53:23] the next morning he started texting me
[53:24] it ended up being like 30 or 34 texts
[53:27] and started accusing me that I'm I'm I I
[53:30] know that I'm following a deceiver and
[53:33] you're lying to the people and the only
[53:34] reason you're keeping the church is to
[53:36] keep the money flow going and I don't
[53:38] expect you to answer but because you
[53:40] don't answer you're a coward
[53:44] 11 30 at nights and I gotta preach in
[53:47] the morning glory to God I wanted to
[53:50] wear another man's coat
[53:55] and I sat there and I asked the Lord I
[53:57] said do you want me to answer this man
[54:03] and he said do not cast your pearls
[54:08] [Applause]
[54:09] so I said Thank You Lord and I took out
[54:12] the enemy's text and I did block
[54:16] and I don't know if he's ever touched me
[54:18] since
[54:20] because I don't have to listen to it I
[54:23] want you to know you don't have to
[54:25] listen to what the devil tells you he is
[54:28] a line to you come on somebody he's a
[54:32] liar he tells you this message is wrong
[54:34] he's a liar if he tells you it's a false
[54:37] prophet he's a liar God is already
[54:40] Vindicated it
[54:43] now he's manifesting it
[54:46] and he's acting some young person why
[54:48] don't you draw your sword and destroy
[54:51] those two kings they can't hurt you
[54:53] they're already defeated
[54:55] [Applause]
[55:01] Glory
[55:03] so I found this Divine button
[55:06] called block
[55:09] I love it
[55:16] brother Mann said Jesus didn't clown
[55:18] around for the devil
[55:19] when he said show me a miracle he didn't
[55:22] show him anything
[55:28] amazing the only time that Herod and
[55:30] pilate became friends when they was both
[55:32] crucifying Jesus Christ
[55:36] some folks were never friends in life
[55:37] until they've all come under the
[55:39] conclusion brother random's wrong
[55:42] I'm telling you they got the same
[55:43] crucifying spirit in them that was there
[55:45] at that day amen but I won't wanna I
[55:48] don't want to be identified with that I
[55:50] wanted to be identified with those that
[55:51] stay in this hour and draw the sword
[55:54] that God has given me of this message
[55:59] he can't tell me it's true God has
[56:03] already Vindicated it in my life
[56:06] he has spoke over my life with this
[56:08] message
[56:09] you cannot tell me it doesn't work
[56:11] [Applause]
[56:14] it'll work over you
[56:17] I don't know how long you have Youth
[56:19] Services dude they go a long time like
[56:20] to midnight or something okay all right
[56:23] I am just now starting to feel untired
[56:26] and good
[56:27] that's very dangerous
[56:29] [Applause]
[56:32] oh I never set my timer
[56:35] ah
[56:37] I got to tell you another testimony
[56:42] you know brother Gideon I I once was a
[56:44] young Preacher Brother Samuel was too
[56:46] right how old are you brother Samuel
[56:48] praise the Lord he's old
[56:52] I'm 54. I want to ask you how you how
[56:55] old you are
[56:56] but I know ARP is talking to you all the
[56:58] time
[56:59] they talk to me
[57:02] I think I was around 27 or so I hope
[57:05] this is all right
[57:06] because only trying to tell you how God
[57:08] works through weakness
[57:10] I can tell you I I'd like to tell you
[57:13] how big and bold and strong I am
[57:18] but I want to tell you about times that
[57:19] I didn't even want to preach
[57:22] and I sure didn't want to do the work of
[57:24] the Lord
[57:25] can I tell you about it
[57:28] yet God had totally equipped me
[57:31] you know but I was I was on the mission
[57:32] field and I I was down in in the middle
[57:35] of nowhere in Guyana South America
[57:37] and I had flown down there with a pastor
[57:39] I had flown into the interior way back
[57:41] by the Brazil border and we're going to
[57:43] minister to the Indians in these in this
[57:45] Village
[57:46] and his village is disconnected from
[57:48] from in any any town or anything it's
[57:51] like 70 miles to the nearest town
[57:54] and we fly in there on this little
[57:55] puddle jumper
[57:57] and the brother had told me prior to
[57:58] going in there he says we're going to
[58:00] we're going to buy tickets to get in
[58:01] we're not going to buy tickets to get
[58:02] out he said when we get there we give
[58:04] the remaining money to some of the
[58:06] Indian brothers and then go buy a ticket
[58:07] for while we're there who's going to be
[58:09] there eight days and have have a Revival
[58:13] yeah a Revival of eight days and I'm
[58:16] American I like return flights
[58:21] I like to know that if I get in
[58:24] I'm getting out
[58:27] this was prior to the days of the idol
[58:30] bail and
[58:35] well I'm getting drunk
[58:42] we didn't have cell phones we had
[58:44] nothing I'm down there to do the work of
[58:46] the Lord you can only take about 24
[58:48] pounds in with you we're going to be
[58:49] there a week that means your clothes
[58:51] your Bible whatever material you're
[58:52] going to take so I took two books the
[58:55] Bible
[58:56] a notepad and some clothes and beef
[58:59] jerky because that's very important
[59:04] praise the Lord
[59:07] and I I took with me Church age book and
[59:09] demonology that's what you want to take
[59:11] on the mission field
[59:15] so I hope this is all right brother Paul
[59:17] I got a ticket in but I don't have one
[59:18] out so I told that Pastor he's a black
[59:21] brother and I told him I said uh my
[59:24] brother I said uh you know we don't plan
[59:26] that way
[59:27] we we get our tickets to come out
[59:31] here I am Young
[59:33] I got the ability to preach
[59:36] glory be to God
[59:37] totally equipped
[59:40] I'm gonna go expound
[59:43] to the needy
[59:45] did you turn me off no okay I just
[59:47] wondered
[59:49] you know we get in this mind that
[59:51] everything's glamorous I had a guy tell
[59:52] me one time brother Michael said boy it
[59:54] must be nice to travel around the world
[59:55] and preach I said go do it
[1:00:05] I told that brother I said we don't work
[1:00:07] like that we get a ticket in we get a
[1:00:08] ticket out he goes man don't worry about
[1:00:10] it everything's gonna be okay so of
[1:00:11] course then she gave me that advice I
[1:00:13] worried about it because that's what
[1:00:14] good people do we worry
[1:00:17] until it consumes us
[1:00:20] it was funny as I was flying down into
[1:00:22] Guyana from America I I pulled out a
[1:00:24] magazine out of the back and it started
[1:00:26] talking about a woman that that lived
[1:00:27] way back in this area he was gone go to
[1:00:29] she was a British woman she ran some
[1:00:31] kind of resort or something and and that
[1:00:33] and she just talked about the place I
[1:00:35] read I don't know that's nice I closed
[1:00:36] it up went well we get we get on the
[1:00:38] airplane so I asked the brother I said
[1:00:40] Is there going to be anybody pick us up
[1:00:42] he goes no
[1:00:43] I said well do you know where this
[1:00:46] Village is
[1:00:47] he goes it's somewhere in that direction
[1:00:54] don't worry about it
[1:00:57] now I did not know this whole mission
[1:01:00] trip was constructed to help Danny
[1:01:04] not the natives
[1:01:06] even though it did but
[1:01:10] God wanted me to learn something called
[1:01:12] patience
[1:01:14] because you're going to need it
[1:01:17] to wait upon the Lord
[1:01:19] and I
[1:01:21] I got so consumed with worry
[1:01:25] and me and him bickered and argued
[1:01:28] and I said that's not how we work we got
[1:01:30] people that know we're cut that pick us
[1:01:33] up and everything
[1:01:34] it was it was us Brothers
[1:01:36] us two brothers on this plane and they
[1:01:38] had put a big painting in the airplane
[1:01:40] in the cargo search I didn't know what
[1:01:42] it was and and so as we're flying down
[1:01:46] to the middle of nowhere to land on this
[1:01:48] airstrip where nobody is to pick us up I
[1:01:51] asked him
[1:01:52] um uh you know what direction he didn't
[1:01:54] know and then he started saying you know
[1:01:55] there's something wrong
[1:01:57] well great
[1:02:00] I already am not getting back home
[1:02:03] now there's something wrong
[1:02:06] and he goes something something bad is
[1:02:08] wrong I didn't know the brother's coming
[1:02:09] down with malaria
[1:02:12] but he goes there's something wrong
[1:02:14] and I go yeah there must be there's
[1:02:16] something wrong with me
[1:02:19] we land and there's a Jeep waiting there
[1:02:21] and it's not waiting for us it's waiting
[1:02:24] for the painting
[1:02:26] nobody's there to pick us up there the
[1:02:28] painting was more important than the
[1:02:29] preachers
[1:02:32] and the brother asked him said hey can
[1:02:34] we hitch a ride with you we're trying to
[1:02:35] get over to this this Village he said
[1:02:37] they said yeah hop in we'll take you
[1:02:38] over to this Farm maybe they can get you
[1:02:40] there we ended up at this Village nobody
[1:02:42] came to get us but we ended up and the
[1:02:43] whole time he's telling me don't worry
[1:02:44] about and I worried about it we fought
[1:02:45] you know we're on the mission field
[1:02:47] we're there for the glory of God walking
[1:02:49] in his inspiration fighting like cats
[1:02:51] and dogs
[1:02:53] he calls me a little child and I called
[1:02:55] him an old woman I'm sorry it's just the
[1:02:57] way it was
[1:02:59] we're there to have a meeting
[1:03:03] see you thought with preachers is all
[1:03:04] Halos and prayer meetings
[1:03:09] I'm trying to help you
[1:03:12] you know here's a young preacher
[1:03:14] brother Desmond told me he's went on
[1:03:16] bless his heart he's went on to be with
[1:03:17] the Lord now we became real close
[1:03:19] friends don't think we became enemies we
[1:03:20] became real close friends we we laughed
[1:03:22] about that until the day he died I mean
[1:03:24] you know he's a little child and you're
[1:03:25] an old woman it was we had great
[1:03:27] identification with one another and and
[1:03:30] uh and he said listen he said I can't
[1:03:32] preach he said you're going to have to
[1:03:34] preach now I'm there eight days I went
[1:03:36] into a deep depression I got to be
[1:03:38] honest a deep depression because number
[1:03:39] one I'm not getting back home I have no
[1:03:41] return ticket I got to preacher Revival
[1:03:43] meeting while I'm depressed
[1:03:46] track that's how it was
[1:03:48] I Can't Describe to you how much
[1:03:50] depression came down upon me so I went
[1:03:52] because I was depressed I went and laid
[1:03:54] in the hammock under tree and tried to
[1:03:56] study so of course because I'm depressed
[1:03:57] I pulled out demonology it's a good
[1:03:59] sermon to go along with how I'm feeling
[1:04:03] you feel oppressed let's look about
[1:04:05] demons you know how they work
[1:04:08] so I did and you know I opened up that
[1:04:10] book and and the first thing I saw is
[1:04:12] brother Graham says now on the mission
[1:04:14] field I said uh
[1:04:16] on the mission field he began to talk
[1:04:18] about all the dangers and the snakes and
[1:04:20] the mosquito just touch you you got
[1:04:22] malaria and he says then at the end of
[1:04:24] it he says
[1:04:26] but don't worry about it
[1:04:28] Lord will go before you and wave it all
[1:04:30] out of the way
[1:04:33] now I gotta tell you to my fault I read
[1:04:36] that it never moved my meter one bit
[1:04:41] I'm going to tell you about the glory of
[1:04:43] God
[1:04:44] the brother came to me he's sick he's
[1:04:46] like give me your money I gave him it
[1:04:47] was eighty dollars my last money on
[1:04:49] Earth I gave to him
[1:04:51] and he gave it to an Indian brother
[1:04:53] and the Indian brother strapped a live
[1:04:55] pig to the back of a bicycle
[1:04:58] and bicycled 70 miles and he was going
[1:05:01] to meet us at the end of the eight days
[1:05:04] so I did not know for eight days when I
[1:05:07] was going home when I wanted to last I
[1:05:10] solved my money was when the piggy was
[1:05:11] gone to the market
[1:05:13] literally
[1:05:17] literally
[1:05:21] it wasn't funny then
[1:05:25] I'd like to tell you
[1:05:27] that I got up and preached messages that
[1:05:30] soared like the angels
[1:05:32] but I can't remember a word that I
[1:05:34] preached
[1:05:37] telling you that to my shame but also to
[1:05:39] his glory
[1:05:40] because if you're in the will of God
[1:05:43] he's going to teach you
[1:05:46] to wait upon him
[1:05:49] and that if you're facing something that
[1:05:51] you don't know how it's going to work
[1:05:52] out he's saying you just wait upon me
[1:05:55] see if jesser had realized who it was
[1:05:57] that it was inspiring that man Gideon it
[1:06:00] was that man that he met after the
[1:06:02] prophet came
[1:06:04] that said get in you're a mighty man of
[1:06:06] Valor Gideon's like how am I that I'm
[1:06:08] the weakest one in my family I'm at the
[1:06:11] bottom of all this bad gene pool
[1:06:14] and God says no you're a mighty man of
[1:06:17] Fowler
[1:06:18] amen he actually attached his own name
[1:06:21] to Gideon because you look up mighty man
[1:06:23] it's Gabor and God is called a Mighty
[1:06:26] Man a warrior
[1:06:28] and he attached his own name to a
[1:06:30] cowards
[1:06:32] and asked him now before you win this
[1:06:35] battle go home to your father's house
[1:06:37] and chop down the Groves and the idols
[1:06:40] because before you can have victory
[1:06:43] Idols have got to be gone
[1:06:48] that's the same God that was with me and
[1:06:50] Guyana
[1:06:52] now I want to tell you this story I
[1:06:54] preach and I don't remember a thing I
[1:06:55] preached brother Paul but all I know is
[1:06:57] the chief's father came to us at the end
[1:07:00] of the meeting
[1:07:01] and we was getting ready to leave to go
[1:07:04] find out if we was going home and you
[1:07:05] asked me did you make it home what do
[1:07:07] you think
[1:07:09] this is not my ghost
[1:07:16] is the chief's father come to me this
[1:07:19] was on the morning we're leaving after
[1:07:21] eight days he comes to me
[1:07:24] and he's a Jehovah Witness
[1:07:27] and he said I had a dream last night
[1:07:31] and he said I dreamed that two angels
[1:07:35] came to the Village
[1:07:36] a black angel and a white angel
[1:07:40] if I'd have known better I'd asked did
[1:07:42] the white one look depressed
[1:07:46] now I want you to know how God was
[1:07:47] representing me while I wasn't
[1:07:49] representing him
[1:07:53] and he told this man in this dream these
[1:07:56] two angels have visited your village and
[1:07:58] he showed him two trees he said one tree
[1:08:00] represents what he preached and this
[1:08:03] other tree the message he preached and
[1:08:04] the other tree represents your
[1:08:06] denomination take your knife and strike
[1:08:09] the false tree
[1:08:10] God gave him a challenge to believe
[1:08:13] and he said I took my knife and I struck
[1:08:16] that tree of Jehovah Witness
[1:08:19] now I want you to know here I am
[1:08:21] depressed wanting to get home but
[1:08:24] because I was doing what God had asked
[1:08:26] to do it was God that done the equipping
[1:08:29] my ability had nothing to do with him I
[1:08:33] did not want to be there but God still
[1:08:35] showed up
[1:08:39] young people that's what I'm trying to
[1:08:42] tell you if Jester had realized that was
[1:08:45] the god that was standing by his side it
[1:08:48] was more than his father
[1:08:50] Peter just drawn that sword and finished
[1:08:53] what God asked him to finish
[1:08:55] he would not have died in the next
[1:08:57] chapter but I want to tell you this is
[1:09:00] your night to rewrite what that young
[1:09:02] man could not do
[1:09:04] oh yes let me for don't let me forget
[1:09:06] you asked me did it work out yeah you
[1:09:08] know we're walking through that Village
[1:09:10] 80 miles away and we're walking there in
[1:09:12] that Indian stepped around the corner of
[1:09:13] the big old gap tooth grin and he pulled
[1:09:15] out his back pocket two tickets it was
[1:09:17] glorious
[1:09:21] the whole time I look back on that and
[1:09:23] God said now listen if you would just
[1:09:24] wait upon me
[1:09:26] and you quit worrying I'll work it out
[1:09:30] I'll work it out through people you
[1:09:32] think it won't work out through I will
[1:09:35] finish the work that you think cannot be
[1:09:37] finished I don't need your ability I
[1:09:40] just need you
[1:09:42] God prove that to me down there in
[1:09:44] Guyana because it wasn't my ability my
[1:09:47] ability when we take me back home but
[1:09:49] God's word showed up and he finished
[1:09:52] what he started
