[0:00] don't want my mind we want his mind the
[0:02] only way he can get his mind is God just
[0:03] jumps in there and does the rest right
[0:05] we're not here theological teaching or
[0:07] or some great big scholar stuff but uh
[0:10] thank goodness because you'd miss me
[0:12] miss on that one here but it's this is
[0:14] the 24th chapter verses 58 I want to
[0:17] read that scripture there real quickly
[0:19] then you'll pray
[0:21] and they called Rebecca and and said
[0:23] unto her we'll go with this man
[0:26] and she said and I thought the greatest
[0:28] thing that she could ever say
[0:30] in all that she had experiences she made
[0:32] a decision
[0:34] and she's I will go amen that's a great
[0:37] the three words that I guess is amazing
[0:39] that I think we all make those same
[0:41] words in different ways but we all made
[0:43] the decision now I will go amen and I
[0:45] think that's the greatest thing she did
[0:47] in this whole experience that she had
[0:48] she made that final Choice I'll go with
[0:51] you Lord I think that's a major thing
[0:52] it's by our hearts Lord Jesus we are
[0:54] grateful to be here this morning that
[0:56] you have invited us here Lord and we ask
[0:59] you Lord to have your way as we approach
[1:01] the word of God tonight today Lord this
[1:04] morning you got to have people here and
[1:05] we ask you Lord to take control take
[1:08] control of the word take control of your
[1:10] people take control of the anointing of
[1:12] God in this place this morning that
[1:14] you'll bring the light upon the hearts
[1:16] of your Believers Lord we're living in
[1:18] the light of the hour it's Lord is a
[1:20] tremendous thing the world might not
[1:22] understand the power of the light of the
[1:25] word and how it affects every person
[1:27] that comes in contact with it Lord but I
[1:30] pray you will help us to understand this
[1:32] wonderful anointing you've given to us
[1:34] we ask you in our lord to bless your
[1:36] word and Bless the people Lord bless and
[1:38] give us the right words to say and that
[1:40] we step aside that you can have your way
[1:42] Lord and bless this little building in
[1:44] the church here in with the Paul in the
[1:46] ministry Lord you've just given so many
[1:49] blessings to so many around the message
[1:51] around the world that you've blessed
[1:53] you've given him the ministry to reach
[1:55] out to our young people and do the great
[1:57] works that needs to be done I pray now
[2:00] your blessing for that work and all
[2:01] that's here to push forward that effort
[2:04] and we ask it now in Jesus name amen you
[2:08] can be seated praise the Lord
[2:11] amen
[2:13] how many would like to be Rebecca
[2:15] amen I I think we can say I believe be
[2:19] honest and I got in my notes I said this
[2:21] is the hour of Rebecca
[2:23] because we can look at all the women
[2:24] outside the church I said we can look at
[2:25] the bottom of the women in the Bible we
[2:27] can see you know go and find out we can
[2:30] find out you know we look at Mary for
[2:32] instance and she had her day and her
[2:33] calling and and she met an angel and she
[2:37] believed the word didn't she and she
[2:39] believed the promise and through that
[2:41] came Christ and then you know and then
[2:43] she that was her Duty and that was her
[2:45] hour and that was what God called her
[2:47] but something anointed her to believe
[2:50] you know I think it's a very important
[2:51] thing to don't ignore the anointing that
[2:54] we've received and it's a great calling
[2:56] because it does things we're not if it
[2:59] was just tradition or just maybe I would
[3:01] think just intellectual teaching and
[3:03] just knowledge of the word and knowledge
[3:05] of a Bible and coming to church and
[3:07] singing great songs and we would be just
[3:09] as like we would probably be shortcoming
[3:11] because there's greater greater ones can
[3:13] sing better and greater preachers than
[3:15] us and in a way of theology Theology and
[3:17] so on they would have missed the calling
[3:18] but thank goodness it's not on those
[3:20] things but I believe this whole
[3:22] experience that we have experienced it
[3:25] kind of doesn't come from these things
[3:28] it comes from the anointing of the holy
[3:30] ghost that comes in this hour to receive
[3:33] to bring forth and look for a bride I
[3:35] believe here uh we find out there was a
[3:39] God was looking for a bride
[3:41] I see we can find out also we talked
[3:44] about a little bit before I have over we
[3:46] see that in the days of
[3:49] we have Rebecca here but we also have a
[3:52] Sarah you know that Sarah in the Bible
[3:53] Sarah was a tremendous woman wasn't she
[3:57] you know if we turn the Bible real
[3:58] quickly there I want to read about Sarah
[3:59] now and we're going to go back to
[4:01] Rebecca as we can just get a little
[4:03] Foundation here over
[4:06] in the uh
[4:09] Genesis the 17th chapter maybe we can go
[4:12] there and we'll just move forward a
[4:14] little bit but you know Sarah was a
[4:16] unique person Abraham was a unique
[4:18] person and but they you know come from
[4:21] Abraham come from a family of of just
[4:23] idolaters and nothing special there but
[4:26] there was something special in him and
[4:28] we all that was said and all that done
[4:30] that didn't hinder what God had in store
[4:33] for Abraham there was still something
[4:35] down on the inside amongst all the mess
[4:36] that God had to get out and bring forth
[4:39] and manifest so he called him Abraham
[4:41] and he called Sarah and they begin to
[4:43] move and God given you know there had to
[4:46] be a promise take place but I want to
[4:48] believe one thing and I think that God
[4:50] does not sit not on some great platform
[4:52] somewhere letting his work move itself I
[4:55] believe God's in every movement I
[4:57] believe God's in every single uh I every
[5:01] single step of the way that God is
[5:03] orchestrating these things because
[5:05] there's no way we could make it happen
[5:07] it had to be God bringing and forth the
[5:10] order and making things a move in its
[5:13] way we will be here you know I never
[5:15] planned on being a Christian in my whole
[5:17] life I was wasn't saved as a young boy I
[5:20] was saved as a man in the in in the
[5:23] military I was I was raised not very
[5:26] religious I didn't raise in a message I
[5:28] didn't know anything about God much she
[5:30] said I know I went to a Church of God
[5:31] and that's all I had I went there just
[5:34] because I had to go there it wasn't
[5:36] nothing that I really found there but
[5:39] you know what I I I didn't know inside
[5:42] there's something you couldn't figure
[5:44] out but through the years you forget
[5:46] those things and the world grabs you and
[5:49] I wasn't a good fella but I found God or
[5:52] God found me I know the one meeting
[5:54] there is that when when the Bible says
[5:55] no making come to me except the father
[5:57] draw him first
[5:58] well I know that's the fact
[6:01] because I never looked for God Adam Eve
[6:04] never sought God God sought them
[6:07] when they was when they fell they hid
[6:09] themselves because that's the nature of
[6:11] man we always hide we always try to
[6:13] avoid the problem I wish I'd avoid the
[6:15] confrontation always want to get away
[6:17] and maybe we can we can just push the
[6:19] problem under the rug but God doesn't
[6:21] allow that especially for us but Adam
[6:24] and Eve when you find out they found and
[6:25] God looked for them and he found them
[6:27] and we can feed the Bible all through
[6:29] the scripture it's the same exactly same
[6:31] circumstance and none of us here isn't
[6:34] any difference God found you you know
[6:36] because he was looking for you you know
[6:38] this is your hour you know we can look
[6:40] in the past look at all the ages right
[6:42] we know the history but God look for
[6:45] those Believers in those ages found them
[6:47] place them and they become the bride for
[6:49] that hour in that age we can find them
[6:51] all the way up through the the growth of
[6:53] the bride and to the point that here we
[6:55] are today and you know so I know that
[6:57] how it is that God can find somebody and
[7:00] and change things in almost a moment you
[7:03] know when I was in the world I was in
[7:06] the military and I was a a rascal you
[7:09] don't want you would never want anybody
[7:10] around me you know that's how we were in
[7:13] the world most of you probably been
[7:14] there but I was there and God found me
[7:16] and that and and that place it wasn't a
[7:19] good place God found me but I'm gonna
[7:20] tell you where God found me I was in a
[7:22] bar when God found me sounds weird
[7:24] doesn't it but I was in a bar drinking
[7:26] when God found me I was sitting there
[7:28] like I always done military people I was
[7:31] by myself that day sitting at the bar I
[7:33] could look at it like it was right now
[7:34] it's been 30 some I guess the 1980s he
[7:37] found me right there I was sitting there
[7:39] I never much looked for God never cared
[7:42] about God but I knew there was a god
[7:44] but I never liked to be witness to me
[7:46] because I knew I said I'm going to hell
[7:48] leave me alone that was my attitude
[7:50] at a Baptist girl one time always
[7:52] witnessed him I said leave me alone I'm
[7:54] going to hell
[7:55] and that's where I'm going to go so
[7:57] don't mess with me no more
[7:58] that was my attitude believe me that you
[8:01] would think don't get this guy to church
[8:03] but that's what but then I found out I
[8:06] was in a bar and then I was there and
[8:07] I'm going to say my testimony because I
[8:09] think I need to
[8:10] and I was in that bar drinking like
[8:13] normal
[8:14] and then I felt something in there the
[8:16] music was playing I had a drink in my
[8:18] hand I can know exactly I can see it
[8:21] right now
[8:21] something strange happened
[8:24] I felt something were reaching to me
[8:28] and pulled something out there was a
[8:30] hand coming up bar and I was believe me
[8:33] I'm a I'm a rascal I said what just
[8:35] happened I can I knew something just
[8:38] ripped out of my heart I said man what
[8:40] was that and I I couldn't and I just I
[8:43] looked around the music was playing
[8:45] something happened but I said you know
[8:47] what it must be me
[8:49] so I started drinking and I drink more
[8:52] and I drink more and I was trying to
[8:54] silence that bothered something that I
[8:56] couldn't now get away from and I stayed
[8:58] that way for months and months and
[9:00] months and I would fight it and I would
[9:02] fight it and I didn't know what was
[9:03] happening things were changing in my
[9:05] life and I still didn't understand it I
[9:08] still did the same thing you know I
[9:10] always say that when God deals with
[9:11] somebody it's not going to overnight
[9:12] things sometimes
[9:14] when people come into churches not
[9:16] overnight things sometimes
[9:18] you know we have a lot of people come to
[9:19] their church and they're not maybe on
[9:21] our level I would guess that sounds kind
[9:22] of self-righteous but they're not in the
[9:24] thing do you think they should be in
[9:27] and they come and they they come with
[9:29] what they have
[9:31] that's all they got
[9:34] but to say you don't know where they're
[9:35] at you don't know where God because God
[9:38] is on God is getting with him on that
[9:40] moment in that time on their schedule on
[9:43] his schedule with them not on your
[9:46] schedule
[9:47] I can imagine if people would saw me and
[9:50] that wasn't it wasn't a message there
[9:51] was a this guy he's definitely a serpent
[9:53] seed
[9:54] you know because definitely our
[9:56] government I had the good characteristic
[9:58] of it but it wasn't me but I for you for
[10:01] months and all of a sudden I said I'm
[10:02] gonna go home on vacation and I went
[10:05] home on vacation and uh my sister was
[10:08] going to church in a Church of God of
[10:10] Prophecy and here I am still bothered
[10:13] still bothered couldn't figure it out
[10:15] went to my old friends and the old bars
[10:17] back home and they look at me says
[10:18] what's wrong with you I said I don't
[10:19] know what's wrong with me
[10:22] it was bothering me
[10:24] it it aggravated me
[10:26] I didn't like it
[10:28] but something was bothering me and
[10:31] everybody saw it and I felt it and I
[10:34] couldn't get away from it but I went to
[10:35] church one morning because my sister was
[10:37] going to church and I would stay in
[10:38] their house and I said I'll just be
[10:40] respectful and I'll go to church didn't
[10:42] want to go but I wouldn't the Church of
[10:44] God of Prophecy here's a denomination
[10:45] you know that and I went there and I
[10:48] don't know what the man said
[10:51] don't nobody I don't know the ceremony
[10:54] and I don't think you know I don't think
[10:56] really had no difference I think God
[10:58] wanted to get me still just long enough
[11:03] and I was sitting there all of a sudden
[11:05] I the altar call was made
[11:07] and I really felt pulled in to go to the
[11:11] Altar and I went to the altar now you
[11:13] have Pentecostals there everybody's
[11:15] trying to teach speaking in tongues and
[11:16] laying on the and I didn't know about
[11:18] that didn't care about it I just knelt
[11:20] down on my knees as Lord Jesus
[11:22] coming to my heart and forgive my sins
[11:24] and be my savior
[11:27] at that moment
[11:30] that same hand that was in the bar
[11:33] came back
[11:35] this time he didn't take it he placed
[11:37] something different
[11:41] that hand wreaked on that flat on that
[11:43] poop on that on that altering and stuck
[11:46] into me that missing part that was I
[11:48] couldn't figure it out and I said that's
[11:50] exactly what it was
[11:54] and there's where God got a hold of me
[11:55] there's where God saved me
[11:58] and then I stayed in the denomination
[12:00] for several years and the founding there
[12:02] was something more problem with me
[12:03] something got to be more and something
[12:05] got to be more and then I found that
[12:07] what God is doing
[12:09] it was the light of God just shining
[12:11] down on me bringing me greater into a
[12:13] greater place you know
[12:15] and then I then I found what God was
[12:17] doing now and it was like that's exactly
[12:19] what I was looking for again see God
[12:21] always takes you further and further and
[12:23] further in the light of the word
[12:26] and I believe what I'm saying is it's an
[12:28] anointing that grabs a hold of you
[12:30] there's a there's a there's something
[12:33] that begins to move in a people and God
[12:36] is God's timing
[12:38] in God's searching and God looking we
[12:42] know the story of the ego it was it was
[12:44] the Holy Ghost type of an eagle
[12:45] searching for to finding who you are and
[12:48] finding God's elect and then the
[12:51] scriptures verify that all through the
[12:53] Bible
[12:54] and I was looking through theirs and
[12:55] seeing how Sarah was called by God and I
[12:58] don't think Sarah looked for God I don't
[13:00] think Abraham looked for what was going
[13:02] on they were there
[13:04] because God was looking for them
[13:07] God found me looked for me found me in
[13:09] the unusual place he found Sarah and
[13:11] Abraham in a situation you know what you
[13:14] know because they didn't know what was
[13:16] taking place but Abraham at that moment
[13:18] he recognized God on the scene Sarah
[13:20] didn't know what was taking place you
[13:23] can look and find out in the Genesis and
[13:25] watch what Genesis says over here with
[13:27] Abraham and Sarah you know he but she
[13:29] began to uh go and find Sarah and one
[13:33] thing you can understand in the Bible in
[13:36] Genesis the 17th chapter or you'll find
[13:38] out here's Abraham and Sarah but watch
[13:41] what takes place you can read it later
[13:43] watch what takes place and I thought was
[13:45] a strange thing that here's Sarah behind
[13:48] the tent and Abraham came with the the
[13:51] the the the angels of God Three Angels
[13:53] We Know Two went to Sodom one stayed
[13:56] with Abraham
[13:57] but that one Angel began to say his main
[14:00] priority and I think God's priority
[14:03] God is praying God's priority today is
[14:06] you are the priority of God
[14:08] Nothing Else Matters to God you are the
[14:11] very priority of God he you're the
[14:13] reason he came
[14:17] You're the Reason God has brung a
[14:19] visitation
[14:20] he needed you
[14:23] and you didn't know you needed him
[14:25] but he needed you
[14:27] and then we found out later that I need
[14:30] him
[14:31] I think a lot of times we don't know
[14:32] what we need until God comes on the
[14:34] scene now I know I need God but I didn't
[14:36] know I needed God but God knew I needed
[14:38] God
[14:39] because God needed me God works on both
[14:42] levels you understand Sarah was there
[14:45] and Sarah was in the tent and we know
[14:46] the history of Sarah she was she was
[14:49] Bare and always has been nothing changed
[14:51] in her life she was just Baron Abraham
[14:53] couldn't have young youngins at all but
[14:55] God had a promise and he sent the
[14:58] promise to them but he said first thing
[15:00] he didn't go look for Abraham at that
[15:01] moment really his attention was where
[15:03] Sarah
[15:04] could you imagine
[15:06] Abraham come to the great angels of God
[15:08] and hear the word he recognized one had
[15:10] to be Jehovah
[15:12] my Lord you visited me
[15:16] and could you imagine you've been
[15:18] Abraham and and you are the husband and
[15:20] you are the very one and he looks to
[15:22] Abraham's word Sarah
[15:24] where is Sarah I I'm the one I'm the
[15:27] Abraham where is Sarah at I think
[15:29] there's a key thing God came and he
[15:33] looked for Sarah
[15:35] Sarah had up something to do in the
[15:38] kingdom of God
[15:39] Sarah God needed her
[15:43] because she through her was going to
[15:45] come up from us where is she at and in
[15:48] her immaturity of course you know
[15:50] immature she laughed
[15:53] when he says you're going to have a baby
[15:55] that's ridiculous you know immaturity we
[15:58] do dumb things
[15:59] but watch as as the promise was given to
[16:02] her anyway she began to grow and begin
[16:05] to mature and now the promise become
[16:07] more relevant more real to her and when
[16:09] she walked in the promise and believed
[16:11] their promise and walked in a promise
[16:12] for so many years that finally it came
[16:15] to pass but he was looking for her
[16:19] God searching out Sarah God searching
[16:23] out his people and it's not leave it
[16:26] there because we found out that God knew
[16:29] Sarah Abraham and we know the the
[16:31] miracle we know how that's the type of
[16:34] the rapture we understand here they were
[16:36] old people old ages 90 years old and
[16:39] stuff and they went to a king and the
[16:41] King fell in love with Grandma
[16:43] or did she or did he I think maybe they
[16:47] had a change
[16:48] something took place
[16:51] not just that but she was restored back
[16:54] what's your restoration not you know
[16:56] remember the restoration is different
[16:58] than a than a Reformation
[17:01] you had reformations right Sarah didn't
[17:04] have her information
[17:05] he didn't just correct it and did a
[17:07] little correction here make her young
[17:09] again it was beyond that
[17:11] but he'd done a restoration He restored
[17:14] her back the way she was before she was
[17:16] barren
[17:18] see He restored her back to the original
[17:21] condition that she could bring forth a
[17:22] promise
[17:24] and I was thinking that seriously we had
[17:26] reformers and reformers and reformers
[17:28] but they all they did was to correct era
[17:31] it'll add a little more here and just
[17:33] move this around and and move that
[17:35] around we had our our Luther and Martin
[17:37] Luther and all and and Wesley and they
[17:40] just corrected a little messed up and
[17:42] just corrected this and but never had a
[17:44] restoration come
[17:46] Sarah brung a restoration God restored
[17:49] her right back to her youth again right
[17:51] back to where she could bear
[17:53] she had no that was never there but he
[17:56] restored that and I believe we're in a
[17:59] restoration now the difference now
[18:01] restoration is to bring it back to the
[18:03] original
[18:05] not just tweak it here
[18:07] I don't know a few my brother that does
[18:09] restoration in cars
[18:11] you know what you have to restore a car
[18:13] I like cars I like a 1967 uh GTO
[18:17] personally
[18:19] can't afford them but they're sure
[18:20] pretty cars
[18:22] he said go look for one I said what I
[18:24] look for he says look for the block of
[18:27] the engine
[18:28] that's the most valuable part of the car
[18:30] if you got the true original block you
[18:32] can restore it back
[18:34] if you don't have the block what good is
[18:36] the car
[18:37] so the value in a real restoration is
[18:40] the power that's on the inside that
[18:43] drives that
[18:45] you can fix the dents and the scratches
[18:47] and all these other things
[18:49] he said that's not word we can fix that
[18:51] but the reality the most valuable is
[18:54] that on the inside
[18:56] and that's what they look for and they
[18:59] restore I think you know God don't care
[19:00] about your scratches and your discs
[19:03] because we come to God all dented all
[19:05] scratched all messed up completely
[19:08] goodness you ain't very good Lookout you
[19:10] have no value at all in you and the
[19:12] world don't see the value
[19:14] because the world don't or the world is
[19:17] not a restorer but God is the restorer
[19:20] and God begins to come on the scene and
[19:23] he looks past your problems you know you
[19:25] think oh my sins are so great I have so
[19:28] many things I don't know that doesn't
[19:30] bother God
[19:32] oh he wants to look down is there's
[19:34] something on the inside
[19:36] that can believe my word
[19:38] and he looks and finds the seed of God
[19:41] and there's the original
[19:45] see you think you see this ain't the
[19:48] original
[19:49] but that is the original
[19:51] that makes this valuable
[19:54] and one day this is going to drop off
[19:56] but the original is what God's looking
[19:58] for because he's bringing a restoration
[20:00] again
[20:02] he's restoring us back to where we
[20:06] come from not to Pentecostal
[20:09] denomination not to not even to the book
[20:12] of Acts
[20:16] our faith isn't restored to a uh we we
[20:19] like to go back to to John and and Peter
[20:22] and all these that's fine but I think
[20:24] our faith goes way back past that
[20:26] because brother Madam also says we have
[20:28] the faith of Abraham
[20:31] that can believe and breathe their
[20:33] promise and to bring that problem stuff
[20:35] that's way back there that believed that
[20:37] when you was unbelievable
[20:39] and so our faith is we have been now
[20:42] restored back to something greater
[20:45] this is a great Reformation
[20:48] Mr restoration
[20:49] beyond all that so God is looking for to
[20:53] restore you back to your Regional with
[20:55] that said there's an anointing that
[20:57] comes behind that
[20:59] so Sarah had that and she brung forth a
[21:01] promise didn't she what'd she bring
[21:03] forth Isaac
[21:05] what a wonderful promise
[21:07] so God needed Sarah to bring the promise
[21:11] right
[21:13] but see it wasn't finished
[21:16] Isaac's born but he's got to grow up
[21:20] and then another woman comes on a scene
[21:22] called Rebecca
[21:24] and the Book of Rebecca in Genesis 24 we
[21:27] can find something else happen here
[21:30] God now he had a promise
[21:32] he needed a he needed he needed uh Sarah
[21:35] to bring the promise but now God needs a
[21:38] bride for a promise
[21:40] we have Isaac's a promised son but where
[21:42] is his bride so God had to look for a
[21:45] bride for Isaac so we have to find a
[21:48] bride
[21:49] for the promise
[21:51] because he was a promise seed and God
[21:54] has have a bride for a promise see
[21:57] so what does he do he goes and searches
[21:59] for her
[22:01] look in the book of look in the book of
[22:04] uh Genesis
[22:06] you know I just with that always comes
[22:08] to mind with me look at Genesis the uh
[22:11] let's go to Genesis the 24th chapter
[22:14] real quickly and you'll we'll start
[22:16] there a little bit but you know it goes
[22:17] back to my thought a little bit on on
[22:19] what's taken place is don't ignore
[22:21] something so simple
[22:23] well you got your hold your chapter can
[22:24] you hold your Bible there
[22:26] because everything runs together
[22:28] we can see Sarah we can see Rebecca we
[22:31] can see Mary all those things had
[22:32] something in common
[22:34] there was a power behind it
[22:37] there was an anointing behind it
[22:38] something was moving in the background
[22:42] and they were just players in a great
[22:45] play
[22:46] and we are players in a play
[22:49] you know we can we we we God has your
[22:52] you have a position in the play you're a
[22:55] great Orchestra he says you're the
[22:56] you're that that or that makes the music
[22:59] you you bring forth that music in the
[23:01] great symphony symphony our Orchestra
[23:03] you have a conductor you have the one
[23:06] that wrote the song you were in that
[23:08] type of plane right you have a place but
[23:11] look over if you could let's go to I
[23:14] think first John
[23:15] how many believes we're in the light of
[23:17] the hour
[23:18] let's look real quickly can I go
[23:20] something already make it simple people
[23:22] wonder what the message is you ever
[23:24] thought about that it says what do you
[23:26] believe I believe the message well what
[23:27] is the message you ever asked that
[23:30] question what do you mean the message
[23:33] you ever think about that
[23:35] if I'm asking you hey what is the
[23:36] message you would say well uh
[23:40] brother badham and no it's not
[23:43] but the Venom is not the message
[23:46] if you think brother bam is a message or
[23:49] I'm the message or by the Paul's a
[23:51] message then you got your you get so
[23:53] you're off your something's off here
[23:55] but watch what the Bible says and I'm
[23:56] saying that we believe the message is
[23:58] not something new for this day it's
[23:59] always been the same way
[24:02] Through the Ages they've always had the
[24:03] message of God
[24:04] but watch in first John let's read
[24:07] something let's go John 1 first John 1.
[24:09] watch I like when they always go back to
[24:12] the beginning
[24:13] why is it they go back to the beginning
[24:16] that was you from the beginning
[24:18] you know you know John 1 1 also started
[24:20] the same way that which was from the
[24:22] beginning what are they trying to tell
[24:23] us
[24:25] there's something taking place
[24:27] that which was from the beginning which
[24:29] we've heard which was seen in our eyes
[24:30] we looked upon and our hands handled the
[24:33] word of life
[24:34] how can you even handle there's
[24:36] something great there
[24:37] is more than a carnal understanding
[24:40] watch what he says keep further further
[24:42] I've I I've seen it we've handled it
[24:46] for the life was manifesting we've seen
[24:48] it and we bear witness and shown to you
[24:50] and show unto you eternal life what
[24:52] which was with the father and was with
[24:54] manifesting to us so think about it real
[24:57] quickly these are the brothers talking
[24:58] about something they've experienced
[25:01] they've they are handling eternal life
[25:03] life was manifested they had contact and
[25:07] they bear witness and they have handled
[25:10] eternal life can you ever handle eternal
[25:12] life it's more than what just words
[25:15] you're handling
[25:17] eternal life that was their experience
[25:19] they're trying to explain the message
[25:22] watch this is an explanation they're
[25:24] trying to do because you ever they pray
[25:25] tell everybody what do you guys believe
[25:27] well this is what believe that which was
[25:30] from the beginning is what we believe
[25:32] we've seen it we've we feel it we we've
[25:35] handled life they're in a position of
[25:37] tangible handling something eternal
[25:41] have you not had that experience
[25:43] this is nothing new for you
[25:46] watch what he says for the life was
[25:48] manifested we've seen it we bear witness
[25:50] and we show them to you how have you
[25:53] ever shown anybody eternal life
[25:56] I don't know how
[25:59] but I guarantee you we can say I'm shown
[26:01] to you eternal life
[26:03] we've experienced that we've grabbed
[26:06] total life
[26:07] you are Eternal people
[26:11] God is giving you the understanding of
[26:13] what eternity is
[26:15] and you grab the hold of eternal life
[26:18] and if I can show you this
[26:20] but it's difficult
[26:22] watch
[26:24] we've seen it we declared it go back to
[26:26] that which we have seen we've manifested
[26:29] and we've seen it we bear Witness
[26:31] that which we've seen in the declaring
[26:32] to you also we have Fellowship one with
[26:34] the other and the fellowship with his
[26:36] father and with his son Jesus Christ
[26:37] keep on going
[26:38] let's keep on going
[26:40] and these things we say unto thee that
[26:41] your joy may be full keep on going we're
[26:43] going to keep going down for this is
[26:45] what
[26:49] amen
[26:50] amen I'm gonna read this that which was
[26:52] from the beginning which you've heard
[26:53] which we've seen with our eyes and we
[26:56] looked upon and our hands have handled
[26:58] eternal life it's not not a revelation
[27:01] see we can see that by Revelation I've
[27:04] handled eternal life I've seen it I've
[27:07] tasted it I see it by Revelation you do
[27:10] that
[27:11] so you can all you can you can kind of
[27:13] understand you can agree and you can see
[27:15] exactly the same thing they got a hold
[27:18] of or that got a hold of them has got a
[27:20] hold of you
[27:21] that was from the beginning that's what
[27:24] we have heard that we have seen that our
[27:26] eyes have looked Upon Our Hands have
[27:28] handled the word of life has not that
[27:31] been in your experience
[27:33] can you explain that you probably ain't
[27:35] able to explain it
[27:37] because you can just talk about it but
[27:39] it takes something you have to
[27:41] experience that to understand this
[27:44] so it's hard to explain it but they said
[27:47] but this is the message
[27:49] so what is the message you've seen it
[27:51] you've heard it you've tasted it you've
[27:53] handled it this is the message which we
[27:55] heard of him and declaring that God is
[27:57] what light in him is no Darkness at all
[27:59] so what is a message God is light
[28:03] and there's no Darkness
[28:05] the simple thing goes what is that
[28:07] message light don't get complicated
[28:11] when light comes to you
[28:14] real genuine Supernatural experiential
[28:17] light that is the message in every age
[28:20] it's always been the same
[28:22] we make it Complicated by trying to put
[28:24] people in the mix
[28:26] we make it complicated well I believe
[28:28] it's brother Bam's message it never was
[28:30] never has been
[28:34] what brother Madam received was the same
[28:36] light you received
[28:39] what Paul had is the same light that
[28:41] brother Benham had the same light that
[28:43] you have Paul had nothing greater than
[28:45] you he had Faith to believe it and it
[28:49] moved in his life and put him into
[28:51] action brother Madam he was a messenger
[28:53] to come because he had to have a prophet
[28:55] Malachi 4 because the Bible says there
[28:58] had to be a restoration so he sent a
[29:00] prophet and God used a man to bring the
[29:03] word that he could declare light to you
[29:07] the seals were open everything was made
[29:09] mermaid revealed it opened up and now
[29:13] we're in the day the Bible says this is
[29:15] a time in the evening time there shall
[29:17] be light why because Darkness faced it
[29:21] was upon everything gross darkness of
[29:24] people but light had to be brung forth
[29:26] that we could see Who We Are
[29:29] you'll never recognize it you're the
[29:31] bride without God really bringing forth
[29:34] the light of the word to you so that's
[29:36] the message of the hour is that God is
[29:38] light and if he is light there's in your
[29:42] life there is no Darkness
[29:44] he reveals the hidden things that's what
[29:46] light does the seals are open the hidden
[29:49] things we feel because the light was
[29:50] there so what is a message simple and
[29:53] that's that's a good answer God's light
[29:55] how do you mean well the Bible says the
[29:58] light of the world brings forth the word
[30:00] and God is light and we've walked in
[30:03] that light if we walk in that light
[30:06] what does it say read that for the
[30:08] verses 6.
[30:09] no darkness and we say and do you have
[30:12] fellowship with him and walk in darkness
[30:13] you lie and the other truth so you
[30:15] cannot say well yes I believe it and
[30:17] still walk in the dark on
[30:19] that not under the revealed word oh I uh
[30:23] you can you can see that a mile away
[30:27] I've seen people come and play the
[30:28] guitar and run around but it's something
[30:30] you can't put your finger on it
[30:34] he said you can impersonate you want to
[30:37] you can't really bring that
[30:39] verse seven here's the key but if you
[30:42] walk in the light as he is in the light
[30:44] you got to stay with the word
[30:46] can't go in front of him he can't go
[30:48] behind him you got to stay right in time
[30:50] right in a step
[30:52] and you're walking in the in in the the
[30:54] movement of God
[30:56] we have Fellowship one with the other
[30:57] and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanse us
[30:59] from all sin
[31:02] aren't you glad there's a covering now
[31:04] there's an umbrella protection that the
[31:07] Believers are under because you're
[31:08] walking in the light of the word there's
[31:10] an anointing on you that believes and
[31:12] walks and trusts and has faith in it now
[31:16] real quickly let's go to uh just rather
[31:18] quick over to uh
[31:21] let me go here real quickly
[31:23] get a little bit further if you don't
[31:24] mind uh first John 2
[31:26] and verses uh 20 another thought he goes
[31:30] right there too
[31:31] he says first John 2 24. let that
[31:35] therefore abide in you
[31:37] what which was
[31:40] that that abide in you which ye have
[31:42] what
[31:43] are you go back to the beginning and
[31:45] heard from the beginning from the
[31:46] beginning you've heard something from
[31:48] the beginning something speaks forth
[31:50] from the beginning
[31:52] something begin you that which we advise
[31:54] and use that which we have heard they
[31:56] hadn't experienced they've heard
[31:58] something something grabbed them it
[32:00] changed them and they caught a word that
[32:03] comes from the eternities and brings
[32:05] them and shows them there is a you've
[32:08] heard that which was from the beginning
[32:11] that which spoke into Heavens that's
[32:13] which created all things that voice had
[32:16] come down from heaven said let there be
[32:17] light and there was light that's what
[32:19] you've heard and that which we heard
[32:22] from the beginning which which that
[32:24] which we have heard from the beginning
[32:25] shall remain in you so now the what
[32:29] you've heard has to stay in you
[32:31] it's got to remain in you what is that
[32:34] the voice that speaks to you that which
[32:37] was from the beginning that presence
[32:39] that God must remain in you
[32:42] and if he he says remember so also you
[32:45] continue in the Sun and in the father
[32:48] don't forget verse 25. and this is the
[32:51] promise
[32:52] that there hath given to us even
[32:54] eternal life
[32:55] now they understand eternal life a
[32:57] little bit more how many here
[32:59] understands eternal life more I never
[33:01] knew an eternal life then unless you
[33:03] don't teach it that way
[33:05] they don't teach the fact that you had
[33:07] to be in the beginning to be eternal
[33:09] they never taught that because God is
[33:13] eternal he never began he never ends you
[33:16] can't get eternal life at the altar
[33:18] denominations believe that they put a
[33:20] the time frame well you just received
[33:22] the eternal life what a big lie that is
[33:26] what a big deception that is that a
[33:29] church give it to you no you you just
[33:32] recognize you had eternal life when you
[33:35] come to God and he reveals himself to
[33:38] you and he you now has heard something
[33:41] grabbed you changed you and you oh had
[33:45] the same experience I had but a
[33:47] different form a different way
[33:50] is that all right
[33:52] it says here verse 20 first
[33:55] but the promises made that eternal life
[33:56] These Things are Written unto you
[33:58] concerning them that seduce you but
[34:00] watch 27 but the anointing in which you
[34:02] have received of him abides in you so
[34:05] what was abiding let that was from the
[34:08] beginning abide in you
[34:10] but it's an anointing now
[34:12] so there's an anointing that abides in
[34:14] you which come from the beginning which
[34:16] we know what that anointing is it's a
[34:19] light that leads you and guide you and
[34:21] reveals things to you because the light
[34:23] is a revealer and God is light you can't
[34:27] separate God from light from anointing
[34:30] from much which for heard from the
[34:32] beginning it all comes together as God
[34:34] manifests himself in the lives of
[34:36] Believers and he brings his own
[34:38] anointing upon you and he believes you
[34:41] and you seem like you just I don't know
[34:42] do I just believe
[34:46] you ever heard that uh coming out of
[34:48] denomination if you've never been there
[34:50] it's something you understand that you
[34:51] says wow I've never heard that before
[34:54] but I believe it
[34:56] and the general overseer says well you
[34:58] can't believe that that's not what the
[35:00] church teaches
[35:01] I said I don't know about that
[35:04] and I stood in the office and he called
[35:06] me every name in the book
[35:08] I said I'll tell you what my brother
[35:09] I'll pray for you
[35:10] he said don't you pray for me I pray for
[35:13] people people don't pray for me you
[35:15] watch that devil rise up a little bit
[35:18] so we excommunicated me but that's okay
[35:22] I wanted to get out anyway
[35:25] amen something going on
[35:27] God got a hold of me revealed to me what
[35:30] God was doing in my life I think what
[35:32] you have what this does is not really
[35:35] reveal much more than I would say it's
[35:38] the most important thing about this that
[35:41] he abides in you
[35:43] and he teaches you
[35:46] you must have him and it's between you
[35:49] and him
[35:52] he comes searching for a bride that
[35:55] would have that characteristic of
[35:57] believing and trusting to be a bride
[36:02] he don't search for anyone God's very
[36:04] picky
[36:05] he wants a wife that's going to believe
[36:07] him and accept him and everything right
[36:11] he says so what is the anointing we
[36:13] understand the anointing of course it's
[36:15] the Holy Ghost
[36:17] we make the Holy Ghost speaking in
[36:19] tongues and things like that there
[36:20] that's that's your gifts of the Holy
[36:22] Ghost but we want the person the person
[36:25] brings forth the effects of the life of
[36:28] believer it's the person in you that had
[36:31] that you now receive the same Revelation
[36:34] that the prophet received
[36:36] or you're just nothing but a bird
[36:39] a parrot
[36:40] you recruit your quotes good you quote
[36:43] better and I quote you know every
[36:45] paragraph every page every scripture in
[36:47] the Bible you're just a parent with a
[36:50] good memory without the Holy Ghost
[36:53] there's no salvation
[36:55] without a complete salvation without the
[36:58] Holy Ghost
[36:59] you can be saved and Sanctified but the
[37:02] Holy Ghost puts you in service
[37:05] with Jesus Christ put you in a place
[37:08] that he can have a relationship with you
[37:10] that's the anointing that you've
[37:12] received not to put you in a church and
[37:14] to keep you there but an anointing
[37:16] that's going to bring a maturity in the
[37:18] bride
[37:19] that's what it's doing
[37:21] Sarah matured the all matured they come
[37:24] to a place now here's Rebecca and what
[37:26] is he doing he's sending out
[37:29] a message to find his bride
[37:32] so we understand this or are we okay
[37:34] with the light there
[37:35] amen is that okay
[37:37] because I think it's important what a
[37:40] thing it is to know what light is
[37:43] amen because it's it's a good thing
[37:46] to understand really what we're under
[37:48] it's beyond us Beyond any man it's an
[37:51] anointing we received now Brooke go back
[37:53] to Genesis the 24th chapter watch what
[37:56] Sarah here she is now Rebecca I mean
[37:59] coming to the point and she begins now
[38:01] here's Abraham old now of well-stricken
[38:04] in age and the Lord had blessed Abraham
[38:07] in all things I'm sorry I'm gonna go to
[38:09] uh
[38:11] Rebecca here yep here we go and Abraham
[38:14] said unto his Elder servant to the house
[38:16] rule over that I had put I pray thee thy
[38:19] hands under thy thigh and I will make
[38:21] thee swear by the Lord God of heaven and
[38:23] God of the earth that thou should take a
[38:26] wife unto the son of a Daughters of the
[38:28] Canaanites among whom I dwell that shall
[38:31] not do that God's very picky of where he
[38:34] gets
[38:35] his people
[38:38] amen
[38:41] unbelief won't fit in God's God's
[38:44] picking he don't want someone that's
[38:46] dragged through this and still had their
[38:47] hearts elsewhere
[38:49] you're not ready for a marriage that way
[38:51] how would you marry a wife that has a
[38:53] boyfriend over here and you have I love
[38:55] you but yeah I like him too you can't
[38:57] marry that
[38:58] she has a several complete relationship
[39:00] with that
[39:01] and come right to you so you're all
[39:04] You're My All In All you're the only one
[39:06] you're the one I love because God don't
[39:09] do that to you
[39:10] God don't flirt with denomination I like
[39:12] them too but like you too more so but I
[39:14] like them God severely they rejected him
[39:18] many years ago and if you reject God God
[39:21] don't hang around rejection
[39:24] do you leave him alone He Goes Forth
[39:26] he'll find his wife throughout the ages
[39:28] but the wife will always be loyal to him
[39:30] he will he knows your heart
[39:33] you want to marry a wife make sure he
[39:34] says no boyfriends on Facebook
[39:39] you know I always say when you get
[39:40] married
[39:41] wipe out your sisters wipe out those old
[39:43] boyfriends
[39:44] if you want to keep it wipe it our
[39:46] brothers wipe out your girlfriends
[39:48] you shouldn't have anymore said well I'm
[39:50] just keeping in touch you don't need to
[39:52] keep in touch with the old things
[39:54] well they're nice no they're not no
[39:57] that's fine leave them alone cut it
[39:59] short because that's a devil that will
[40:01] work in the background
[40:02] to get you talking to him and he's hey I
[40:05] just thought he was on my mind
[40:07] yeah that's the devil trying to
[40:09] interfere and disrupt your wedding and
[40:11] just watch your bad relationship or your
[40:13] marriage you got to be careful the devil
[40:15] is out to destroy you that's why pastors
[40:17] we very careful who we counseling what
[40:19] we counseled I don't take a single woman
[40:21] in my office and close the door
[40:23] I don't say well let me sit there and
[40:25] talk to you me and you by myself don't
[40:26] do it you know why the devil will use
[40:29] that and maybe nothing's there but
[40:31] somebody might walk by and have a bad
[40:33] report on you
[40:35] and my job as a medic on the fire
[40:37] department I never treat a young woman
[40:38] by myself
[40:40] I won't allow the devil to interfere one
[40:43] accusation your life is ruined you got
[40:46] to protect yourself you gotta you gotta
[40:48] get away from anything that appears to
[40:50] be evil the Bible says because you have
[40:52] you are the bride
[40:53] keep your keep your skirts spotless and
[40:56] don't get caught up with the things of
[40:58] the world
[40:58] so here's Rebecca Rebecca was a person
[41:02] God chose her
[41:04] because she was that nature she had a
[41:07] character but what do you do he goes and
[41:09] sends forth his servant and watch very
[41:11] quickly on the uh versus uh five and the
[41:15] servant said that servant said unto him
[41:17] here's Elias you're talking to Abraham
[41:19] pure venture
[41:20] the woman will not well the woman will
[41:23] not follow the willing to follow me
[41:25] until the land must I bring thy son
[41:28] again unto the land which thou cameth
[41:31] and Abram says unto him
[41:34] beware doubt that thou shalt bring not
[41:38] thy my son hither again the Lord of
[41:40] Heaven which took me from the father's
[41:42] house and from the land of the kindreds
[41:44] and spaked and which spake unto me and
[41:47] this and that swore unto me saying unto
[41:49] thy seed I will give this land he shall
[41:52] send his Angel before thee and thou
[41:54] shall take a wife unto my son
[41:57] so Abraham you know he always think
[42:01] about your past experiences I like that
[42:03] he goes back we know he took me from
[42:04] this he took me from here he took me
[42:07] from my kindreds he came from all the
[42:08] unbelief the same God that did that gave
[42:10] me a promise here
[42:12] I think it's good to go back
[42:14] and put markers in your life
[42:18] we have monuments of Victories around
[42:21] the world around the nation
[42:22] you know we ran a great battle here
[42:25] we got a a marker of a great battle won
[42:28] by the you know Civil War battles the
[42:30] union won a battle here this
[42:31] Confederates won a battle here and they
[42:33] put monuments because they've they've
[42:35] made a conquering battle and they laid a
[42:38] stake down there that you can remember
[42:40] John Joshua crossed the river and he put
[42:43] a monument there to remind the people
[42:45] what God done on Jordan
[42:48] he says pass some Stones there that your
[42:51] children will know and your children
[42:52] shall remember what God did you know why
[42:54] because God wants you to remember how
[42:57] you overcome how God LED you through you
[43:01] know why it's not for mainly it's not
[43:04] for God as much as for you
[43:07] because you'll need those markers
[43:11] you'll need them because one day you're
[43:13] going through a hard time
[43:15] and you said like oh God I'm lost I
[43:18] don't know what to do I feel horrible I
[43:20] feel like a sinner
[43:21] but join the cloud
[43:24] you know the devil doesn't put that
[43:26] thing on everybody who are you look at
[43:28] your past
[43:30] you how in the world God save someone
[43:32] like you but then you go back and you
[43:34] say oh God but then you begin to think
[43:37] but God did this
[43:39] God found me in a bar
[43:41] God did this in my life
[43:44] God led me from this point into that
[43:46] point and to that point that's the god
[43:48] that is the same message as ever and if
[43:50] he did that for me praise God he'll do
[43:53] it again
[43:54] so Abraham he uses past markers to give
[43:58] him the faith to say if God did it then
[44:01] don't you worry Elisa he'll do this this
[44:04] time
[44:04] he had no doubt in what God said because
[44:07] God already proved to him
[44:09] who he was now you need that type of
[44:11] faith
[44:13] not in what God did for me but what
[44:15] God's done for you
[44:16] and what God is doing for you every time
[44:18] you have a victory remember that
[44:21] every time God's help you overcome will
[44:23] it be smoking or drinking when you're
[44:25] coming to the out of the world or be
[44:28] whatever it may be or any bad habit Mark
[44:30] that in your life and remember that day
[44:34] that God gave you Victory you'll need
[44:36] that one day
[44:38] now you never see a monument up for a
[44:41] loss
[44:42] we lost the battle here we'll put a big
[44:44] statue up don't do that you don't find
[44:46] that only the victories
[44:49] so make sure you put the victories there
[44:51] you don't got to put well I found back
[44:53] said don't leave that Monument there
[44:55] that don't want that
[44:58] you want God's Victory monuments in your
[45:00] life and then he'll take those monuments
[45:02] and you'll use those monuments for God
[45:04] to give you strength and faith that he
[45:07] never he's always the same and he said
[45:09] that he began to that's the truth but
[45:11] watch what he says he says uh
[45:14] and if a woman he said and if the woman
[45:16] will not so he's going back well Abraham
[45:18] what if she won't come God will send it
[45:21] but but now Abraham
[45:24] God willing what if she doesn't want to
[45:27] come
[45:27] see Ellie he's just just a man trying to
[45:30] do a job and you know he's got a task
[45:32] he's got to do he's got to go find a
[45:33] wife or
[45:35] Isaac that's Abraham's son what a
[45:38] challenge into a city that he's never
[45:40] been probably I don't know but he goes
[45:43] there blindly
[45:45] what is he going to do
[45:47] now we can type elegia with this day
[45:49] there's a Rebecca that needs to be found
[45:52] and what is God doing he's got to send
[45:55] forth a messenger to bring a message to
[45:57] find his bride
[45:59] watch what he says here if the woman
[46:00] will not willing to follow me then thou
[46:03] shall so he says he Abraham gave this if
[46:06] the woman will not be willing to follow
[46:07] thee thou shall be clear with an oath
[46:10] only bring not thy son hither so he gave
[46:12] another Assurance if you have Oath but
[46:15] Abraham was not even worried he knew
[46:17] good and well she would follow
[46:19] he said and the servant put his hand
[46:21] upon the thigh of Abraham master and
[46:23] swore by him concerning the medal and
[46:24] the servant took ten camels and I'll go
[46:26] past that all that and he came to the
[46:29] chemist to kneel down the city of the
[46:31] well and the time of the evening even
[46:34] the time the woman goes out to draw
[46:36] but watch what he does he wants
[46:38] something to happen Lord I don't know
[46:40] what did you say here next
[46:42] verse 11 verse 12. watch what he says
[46:44] here it's evening time is it he said
[46:46] Lord say oh Lord please
[46:48] thy good Master pray that you send good
[46:51] speed this day and show me kindness to
[46:52] my father Abraham my master verse 13.
[46:55] watch what he says
[46:57] behold I stand Here by the will of water
[46:59] and the daughters of men of the City
[47:01] come out to draw water keep on going and
[47:04] let that come to pass at the damn store
[47:06] whom I shall let down the picture I pray
[47:08] thee that I may they may that I may
[47:10] drink and she say drink and I'll give
[47:13] the camel's drink also and let the same
[47:15] be she that thou has appointed for their
[47:18] servant Isaac therefore shall I know
[47:20] that thou has sent kindness to my master
[47:22] so here he gave a a a a duty
[47:26] for God
[47:27] Lord let this happen
[47:31] he gave a fleece before God let this
[47:33] happen Lord let me let this come to pass
[47:35] and watch what she did and you
[47:37] understand what happened we see and she
[47:39] come to the place and now here she comes
[47:41] and he she did exactly what he asked her
[47:46] to do gave him drink gave this camel's
[47:49] drink verse 15 and it come to pass
[47:52] before they had done speaking that the
[47:54] Rebecca came out from both of Bethel and
[47:57] Son of Mika Monica and the wife of nehor
[48:00] Abraham's brother and her picture upon
[48:04] her shoulder what an experience that was
[48:06] as soon as he said that here she come
[48:08] you think God doesn't rearrange things
[48:12] he arranges different situations it was
[48:16] already arranged you don't think that
[48:18] she was I mean I don't think she knew
[48:21] what was happening I don't think Elysia
[48:23] had the Assurance but God had both
[48:25] moving at the same time he had Elijah
[48:28] there and he had Rebecca there
[48:31] Rebecca was on the same wavelength as
[48:33] God and Elisha was on the same wave as
[48:36] God together they come together but they
[48:38] never knew exactly they was doing what
[48:40] they was doing
[48:41] you never knew you was coming to God
[48:43] when you went to church and got saved
[48:44] God just placed you the right place at
[48:47] the right time and the Holy Ghost was
[48:48] there and he found you he convicted you
[48:51] and you came to the altar dimple
[48:54] you can come to the Altar and dry out
[48:56] confession the prophet said and you'll
[48:58] be nothing but a sinner when you come
[48:59] and a sinner when you leave but let God
[49:01] call you and you'll leave a saint
[49:05] because when God calls when God does it
[49:07] it doesn't do in vain it's impossible
[49:10] for God to fail
[49:11] in your life it's impossible God can
[49:14] never fail your experience
[49:16] you might think you're failing but
[49:18] remember there's a greater anointing
[49:20] than you think you have
[49:22] God is moving on your behalf everything
[49:25] is moving because God has orchestrated
[49:28] your life completely
[49:29] you're not here by chance you're
[49:31] predestined that means he knew you away
[49:33] from the beginning he knew you were here
[49:35] so it's not as coincident that you're
[49:37] here at this hour this day this age
[49:39] because he's prepared you for that day
[49:41] that's why I'm saying we're prepared for
[49:43] this hour you look at the world you look
[49:45] at thought of my condition you look at
[49:47] the world of transgender and that mess
[49:48] out there oh you shouldn't say that I'll
[49:50] say what I want to say
[49:53] it's a devil
[49:55] anointing our children and the parents
[49:57] are under demon are anointing to have
[50:00] their children under that Spirit of
[50:02] anointing
[50:03] and if they come together and and stand
[50:06] against it maybe there'll be a change
[50:07] but I don't think so because we have to
[50:10] come to sodomites
[50:13] and the world in a sodomite condition
[50:15] ungodliness
[50:17] Even in our own government
[50:19] homosexual and men dressed like women
[50:21] and they're part of the health
[50:23] department and part of this department
[50:24] how disgraceful
[50:26] of a nation that said under God We Trust
[50:29] but that's the way it's got to be
[50:33] there's an anointing on the people
[50:35] to do what they do
[50:38] but watch now
[50:40] she come that way and here she comes God
[50:43] worked on her side and brung her right
[50:45] to the angel she did exactly what she
[50:48] did she come there and she gave the
[50:50] water she gave the camel water she gave
[50:52] him water and here which God was doing
[50:55] he found the wife for whom he found the
[50:59] wife
[51:00] four
[51:01] the promise
[51:04] who's that the you know who's the
[51:05] promise is
[51:06] Christ is always a promise
[51:09] and he looks for a bride
[51:11] and what are you to do you're the one
[51:13] that God come to find
[51:15] let me read something here if you're
[51:17] okay
[51:18] you are with me
[51:21] amen
[51:23] let me read something from I think my
[51:24] things are going let me find something
[51:25] here you love him
[51:28] what's here now
[51:30] oh did Rebecca say I'll go God praise
[51:33] God that's what we want to do now is the
[51:35] is the hour now is a time of decision we
[51:38] know it's Rebecca and Isaac being blood
[51:40] blations but now but but now they're
[51:43] typing Israel natural seed but by faith
[51:46] Christ come on the scene which is not by
[51:48] Nature not by natural he didn't come
[51:51] that way he come a supernatural bride
[51:53] now did you know that that uh when
[51:56] Rebecca came that guess what happened
[51:59] something else came before her this is
[52:01] important watch this quote you never
[52:03] probably knew this maybe you did it was
[52:05] an even time when he commented the well
[52:07] near the city and all and it was all
[52:09] about the time Rebecca had to make a
[52:11] decision it was in the evening time when
[52:13] he come to the well near the city it was
[52:15] about the time that Rebecca had to make
[52:17] a decision I believe
[52:20] listen this I believe
[52:23] that the Lord
[52:25] beat Elijah or him there
[52:29] about a half hour
[52:31] for he will send his angels before you
[52:33] and make a way clear it must have been
[52:35] about the angel that God spoke to
[52:36] Rebecca's heart and says go to the water
[52:37] you see so but that says an angel God
[52:41] because the Bible says those tennis
[52:42] Angels before to prepare the way so the
[52:45] angel came and got to Rebecca the
[52:48] prophecy about a half hour before Elise
[52:50] you're gonna see him so he prepared a
[52:52] heart before even the messenger came and
[52:54] he got her ready because he she was
[52:57] going to receive something but he got
[52:58] her heart ready to receive it
[53:00] you think that God didn't send an angel
[53:02] before you when you heard this message
[53:04] and prepare your heart oh yes he did you
[53:08] didn't believe it out of your own
[53:09] natural way
[53:10] you didn't believe it because your
[53:11] denomination taught you to believe an
[53:13] angel got to you and something how he
[53:15] prepared your heart to receive that
[53:19] message he said oh God what did it the
[53:22] angel got to you got your heart ready
[53:24] and you received the word like Rebecca
[53:27] did because Rebecca is a type of you
[53:29] this is Rebecca's hour
[53:31] this is the hour of Rebecca this is the
[53:34] hour of the Bride because we are the
[53:36] wife of the promise
[53:38] you're the wife of the promise
[53:40] you're the one that gives the promise a
[53:42] wife that he can he can bring forth his
[53:45] life through and he's and she left with
[53:48] Eliza and took her journey all the way
[53:51] there what happened when she got to the
[53:54] tent
[53:55] she dropped everything he was surprised
[53:58] everything else where was Eliezer at he
[54:01] was off the scene
[54:03] it was in his job his job was to bring
[54:06] and find it and leave her at the steps
[54:08] of the promise
[54:10] and God and the believer is now moving
[54:14] in direction to receive the promise and
[54:17] prepare her it wasn't that she received
[54:20] the teaching
[54:21] no forget that
[54:23] it's beyond teaching
[54:27] because I can teach you a lot of good
[54:28] things that don't mean anything
[54:30] but elieza taught her
[54:34] of the character
[54:36] and the nature you know can you imagine
[54:38] let me tell you about Isaac he's a man
[54:41] of character and begin to talk to her
[54:43] about who he is
[54:45] and all the great things in the nature
[54:48] and characteristics that he has and so
[54:50] that's what drawed her
[54:53] his nature his character it wasn't some
[54:57] story or some Doctrine we teach because
[55:00] I can teach you Doctrine and Doctrine
[55:01] induction but if you don't know the
[55:03] character of Christ
[55:04] and you know don't you don't go for that
[55:07] you just become an intellectual
[55:09] a message a message Theologian because
[55:12] you've never found we want to find the
[55:15] character that's the attraction
[55:17] see the brother says what attracts God
[55:20] to the people
[55:21] what attracts God to you
[55:23] you're attracting you attract God by
[55:26] believing this word
[55:27] that's what attracts God
[55:29] that's what the Bible says that's what
[55:30] he says you attract God has attracted to
[55:32] you because you keep his word
[55:35] sure so you ready to keep his word
[55:37] that's attraction that God has oh she's
[55:40] wonderful she'll keep every word I have
[55:42] faith in her her heart single with me
[55:45] she don't know no other one but me
[55:48] oh I'm glory to God what's God doing now
[55:51] taking a bride bringing to a place bring
[55:55] into a position Oh Glory to God what is
[55:57] he doing bringing her to that place
[55:59] watch I said surely the word of God the
[56:03] same character that is that in there
[56:05] that you dealt with would be in the same
[56:07] Basics that would be on my question this
[56:09] was the brother man said this I like
[56:11] this he had a question Lord let me find
[56:14] a character in the Bible that represents
[56:16] what God is doing right now and watch
[56:18] what he said oh surely there's something
[56:21] in the word of God from Genesis to
[56:22] Revelation that some character in there
[56:25] that you dealt with would be the same
[56:28] basis that would be my question that's
[56:29] the question he had if someone done
[56:31] something you got after him about let
[56:34] him turn to the place in the Bible if
[56:36] someone whatever it is done it'll lean
[56:38] my way well I've done wrong I've done
[56:41] something you want to do you haven't
[56:43] done let's see the character in The
[56:45] Bible like that and I close my eyes just
[56:48] let the Bible Bible fall open put my
[56:50] finger on the scripture so he went there
[56:53] looking for a character that would
[56:54] describe what's taken place maybe in his
[56:56] ministry as well and the bride and
[56:58] Genesis 24 7 came to him Elijah Abraham
[57:02] Stay full servant the model servant of
[57:04] the Bible sending being sent to hunt the
[57:07] bride for Isaac oh children over me
[57:10] surely that's that's right with the rest
[57:12] of the message pulling out a bride
[57:15] Oh Glory see the prophet recognizes that
[57:18] the message of Elijah
[57:21] was a message to go and pull out a bride
[57:23] the angel got to her before everything
[57:26] was set in place oh don't think this
[57:28] message is some type of Hocus Pocus
[57:30] stuff God is bringing a reality in God's
[57:34] people and I want to make sure amen that
[57:37] God is bringing forth and you know when
[57:39] God brung a message and he brings and
[57:43] and he's looking for a bride there's an
[57:45] anointing that releases out
[57:48] because there's the angel coming
[57:50] so when you know you're in the hour
[57:52] there's anointing been released and what
[57:54] does that anointing do goes and finds
[57:56] and looks and looks it's the Holy Ghost
[57:58] anointing bringing you into a position
[58:00] and God is going to meet the challenge
[58:02] and you're going to meet that challenge
[58:04] of the hour that's the anointing we
[58:06] received right there
[58:07] what's anointing we received that's
[58:09] anointing
[58:11] that God has anointed you to receive all
[58:14] that God has for you in this hour I
[58:16] believe we're in that hour right now how
[58:18] many believe that I believe we're in a
[58:21] time that God is bringing forth all
[58:23] these wonderful things we're in an hour
[58:25] now that's so great that we can barely
[58:27] contain the Revelation is coming down in
[58:29] your hearts
[58:30] it's a truth
[58:32] we're we're bringing forth the word the
[58:34] word revealing to you remember this is
[58:35] not our message this is not the
[58:38] prophet's message this is God's message
[58:39] to Eliezer
[58:41] and we get to the point we think we put
[58:43] names and titles on what God is doing
[58:45] don't forget you're the equation God
[58:47] came to get you you're the bride I'm the
[58:49] bride it's not me and brother Paul and
[58:52] this one you are the elect God's bride
[58:55] you're the one he's coming for you're
[58:57] the one that he sends down the anointing
[58:58] to grab a hold of this message that's
[59:01] doing their job and it's not anything
[59:03] come by a man brother Batman had to
[59:05] clear that up he says this what you
[59:07] received it's it's I am not the son of
[59:10] man
[59:13] just that's not me
[59:16] don't confuse the prophet with something
[59:18] greater than he is don't don't make his
[59:20] ministry a shame
[59:22] he's I was only there
[59:24] when he come
[59:28] and he come
[59:30] to reveal himself I'm just one standing
[59:33] there when he does it
[59:35] as his ministry of a prophet to come to
[59:37] to bring forth the word to you but
[59:40] remember it's always on that side that
[59:42] God doesn't revealing
[59:44] the pressure Prosper can't reveal
[59:46] nothing to you he can't save you he
[59:48] can't redeem you he can't bring
[59:49] Revelation to you all we can do is bring
[59:51] the word bring the message and bring
[59:52] what God the scriptures and the God goes
[59:54] out and does the rest you know these
[59:56] things but I think we're an hour now
[59:58] that we have a great challenge you have
[1:00:00] your home your life your spiritual walk
[1:00:02] your families your children all this in
[1:00:04] at weighed out Upon Our Lives and with
[1:00:08] that you've got to understand there's
[1:00:09] some there's a way that God has planned
[1:00:11] that
[1:00:12] you have to be faithful keep God first
[1:00:15] keep your family first keep your desires
[1:00:17] with God and then but yet don't be a
[1:00:21] fanatic but the man says the worst thing
[1:00:22] that happened to Martin Luther
[1:00:24] you know the biggest problem is wasn't a
[1:00:26] Catholic Church he said it was a
[1:00:28] fanaticism that followed his message
[1:00:29] that was a hardship Luther had to deal
[1:00:31] with
[1:00:33] so let's not make this wonderful Gospel
[1:00:36] of Jesus Christ The Gospel is not
[1:00:38] preaching the word it's it's not just
[1:00:40] preaching the gospel is the life of the
[1:00:44] word being revealed to the people
[1:00:47] the gospel come to save you the gospel
[1:00:50] found you it's the anointing of the
[1:00:53] Gospel by the holy ghost that finds and
[1:00:55] captures you and bring it back and you
[1:00:57] can say what Paul says I have been
[1:00:59] apprehended of that
[1:01:02] I have been apprehended by the word of
[1:01:05] God he said not that I've apprehended or
[1:01:08] I have called but has apprehended me
[1:01:10] and there's a key
[1:01:12] see let the word apprehend you put you
[1:01:16] in prison of love that nothing else
[1:01:18] matters
[1:01:20] let that which you want to apprehend get
[1:01:22] you
[1:01:23] and you got and if it's got you you'll
[1:01:25] get what God has for you amen you love
[1:01:28] him I believe it I believe God's doing
[1:01:31] now is a great move that we got to
[1:01:33] understand and don't ever think that
[1:01:36] you're you and don't get it get common
[1:01:38] don't let this message become just a
[1:01:40] common thing like God is on the move and
[1:01:43] it's a great hour look at what's taking
[1:01:45] place what an hour we're living in now
[1:01:47] that we can we can be a participant of
[1:01:49] what God is doing and God is bringing
[1:01:51] the bride to perfection
[1:01:53] not in your way his way
[1:01:56] near his way don't don't get ahead of
[1:01:59] God's program just let your faith stand
[1:02:01] let God do the perfecting let God do the
[1:02:04] dressing let God do the work in your
[1:02:07] life and don't get too fast and too
[1:02:09] quick because your time is God's timing
[1:02:12] all right God's timing should be your
[1:02:14] timing
[1:02:15] don't get worked up and just distracted
[1:02:18] and and depressed because you don't feel
[1:02:20] like you're growing strong enough just
[1:02:21] believe God have faith in God and let
[1:02:24] God bring the increase
[1:02:26] see God's a farmer God's a tiller God's
[1:02:30] the one that nurtures God's the one that
[1:02:31] cultivates a Believer so let God do it
[1:02:33] just lay in the presence of the Sun and
[1:02:36] let the sun bake out all the greenness
[1:02:38] of you
[1:02:39] don't get ahead of God just stay on
[1:02:41] courts just ride on this Glory ride on
[1:02:45] this word let that word take you home
[1:02:48] that's what that's the vision that he
[1:02:49] had when he's up that Creek jump on the
[1:02:51] log and ride it to the camp and that's
[1:02:53] what we got to do right write the
[1:02:55] message write the word all the way to
[1:02:57] Glory don't worry about anything else
[1:02:59] just believe God you know because the
[1:03:02] reason you believe God because God
[1:03:04] dealing with you the reason you're
[1:03:05] hunger and thirst because God's
[1:03:06] revealing things to you if you didn't
[1:03:08] have hunger and thirst that means God's
[1:03:10] not messing with you but because you do
[1:03:11] want more and you feel God I just need
[1:03:13] more that's because God's got more for
[1:03:15] you
[1:03:16] that's true that's why he says he says
[1:03:19] why would a what comes first the water
[1:03:21] the fin
[1:03:22] the fish had to have water before it
[1:03:24] could swim in
[1:03:25] so he put a fan on a fish's back because
[1:03:27] water was there to be swimming
[1:03:29] he put a hunger in your heart because
[1:03:30] there's something God wants to give you
[1:03:32] so why do you hunger and thirst church
[1:03:34] he said because God's trying to reveal
[1:03:36] things to you
[1:03:37] so while you're hungry and as you're
[1:03:39] thirsting just enjoy the blessings
[1:03:41] because just believe in what God reveal
[1:03:44] his Mysteries and reveal and you'll know
[1:03:47] that what day you're living in you'll
[1:03:49] come and recognize on a closing I'm
[1:03:51] gonna read this quote if I can real
[1:03:52] quickly what God has done just what God

[1:04:04] amen
[1:04:05] and we'll just close out real quickly on
[1:04:07] this what God is doing I think what now
[1:04:10] we're in an hour we have to let God take
[1:04:13] us home let God take his will be
[1:04:15] faithful with him and let God do exactly
[1:04:18] what he wants to do amen bringing the
[1:04:20] bride to that place amen can we stand
[1:04:23] real quickly and I'm going to close out
[1:04:25] I just want to make sure and I'm excited
[1:04:28] because I can see these types coming
[1:04:30] together you know I've never seen so
[1:04:31] much scripture and so much prophecy made
[1:04:33] manifest in the last four or five six
[1:04:35] years of my life
[1:04:38] never
[1:04:39] we don't know what day it is that's not
[1:04:41] our job I don't put times and days and
[1:04:43] hours that's ridiculous
[1:04:45] I just want to know when that happens
[1:04:46] I'll be ready

[1:04:55] buy your church go do these things don't
[1:04:57] worry about that God has timing your
[1:04:59] timing should be God's time that means
[1:05:01] you just keep going as God has planned
[1:05:04] for you to go and don't worry don't get
[1:05:06] closed down and go crazy just believe
[1:05:09] what God is bringing you to amen amen
[1:05:12] let's see here
[1:05:13] there we go here we go he says uh
[1:05:18] amen well God I have that here I want to
[1:05:21] read that before we close out we can do
[1:05:23] a musician's coming up I guess I don't
[1:05:25] know that's why I call them up but I
[1:05:27] think you've let me come
[1:05:28] I'm just glad that God can bring us to a
[1:05:31] place now
[1:05:32] that God is bringing us into position
[1:05:34] that he can work through the bride amen
[1:05:37] they will all find it a little bit but
[1:05:39] I'm glad God's a great architect how
[1:05:40] about you
[1:05:42] I'm glad he is amen hearing about Hearts
[1:05:45] now and I was asked God to have his way
[1:05:49] how many believe that you're a Rebecca I
[1:05:52] hope so
[1:05:53] God has sent an elegia to find you
[1:05:57] that Holy Ghost goes and reaches out and
[1:05:59] searches every part of the world of
[1:06:02] pioneer and somehow he says Lord I
[1:06:04] believe
[1:06:05] amongst all the controversy of all the
[1:06:07] unbelief all the problems that you have
[1:06:09] to go through to believe you believed
[1:06:11] anyway
[1:06:12] the church is really coming to
[1:06:14] understand what's taking place now he
[1:06:17] says this the church is beginning to
[1:06:18] understand the message to hear the
[1:06:20] message and to understand it better
[1:06:22] friends I listen you got to lay in the
[1:06:24] presence of the sun we got to be ripened
[1:06:26] our faith isn't ripened intellectually
[1:06:28] we're hearing a message of God has given
[1:06:31] to us
[1:06:32] seeing the signs that he's shown to us
[1:06:34] proven by the Bible is there but oh how
[1:06:38] the church needs to lay in their
[1:06:39] presence until it's tindered up you know
[1:06:42] the great sweet in the spirit so that
[1:06:45] it can bathe down something that speaks
[1:06:48] to the message something that speaks the
[1:06:50] message you heard and you get harshened
[1:06:54] have to break in and that because you've
[1:06:56] got to clinch it like a nail to hold it
[1:06:59] sometimes it needs to be preached hard
[1:07:01] it can clinch right but when the church
[1:07:04] once gets it the elect is called out and
[1:07:06] separated then the presence of God I
[1:07:09] know
[1:07:10] it'll be something like that people was
[1:07:13] there when it takes a Rapture so God
[1:07:16] says you are now coming to the recognize
[1:07:19] and understand what God is doing
[1:07:22] I think we're understanding now we went
[1:07:24] to a lot of different and we've been
[1:07:25] through a lot of brother Paul we've been
[1:07:27] through a lot of changes
[1:07:28] through the message haven't we
[1:07:30] we've been in this position and we have
[1:07:32] the theologians we have the time where
[1:07:34] it was quoting and quoting and quoting
[1:07:35] then we come to this time and it's
[1:07:36] amazing how we've come to those those
[1:07:38] little things and here we are and God is
[1:07:41] bringing that bride to a greater
[1:07:42] maturity than we're very imagined and
[1:07:45] you are the great you're in such a
[1:07:46] mature state right now you might not
[1:07:48] understand yourself but that don't make
[1:07:50] a difference what God sees is important
[1:07:52] you'll never see yourself there I don't
[1:07:54] think because you'll if you see yourself
[1:07:56] perfect
[1:07:58] you'll quit
[1:08:01] I think we just you know your God always
[1:08:03] want to keep your thirsting and trying
[1:08:05] and reaching and reaching for more if
[1:08:07] you stop reaching you'll die if you stop
[1:08:09] drinking your thirst to death you'll die
[1:08:11] it's natural death and spiritual death
[1:08:13] you don't hunger and thirst he keeps you
[1:08:15] hungry he keeps you thirsting he keeps
[1:08:18] you fed he keeps you going because if
[1:08:19] you don't you'll die
[1:08:21] and when it's time for you Perfection
[1:08:23] he'll make the Rapture and he'll take
[1:08:25] you out of here until then we're all
[1:08:27] growing together
[1:08:28] how many believe you're growing but
[1:08:30] we're going together you know why
[1:08:32] there's not going to be an individual
[1:08:33] Rapture it's going to be a full Rapture
[1:08:35] so somehow God puts it all together and
[1:08:38] will all go up in a moment we're going
[1:08:40] to go how I don't know but that means we
[1:08:42] all got to be ready at the same time I
[1:08:44] don't know how he's going to do that but
[1:08:45] Paul I don't know how he's going to do
[1:08:46] that but I know he will because the word
[1:08:48] said he would in a moment in a twinkling
[1:08:51] of eye
[1:08:51] she's gone that means everybody had to
[1:08:54] be in their position in their place and
[1:08:56] now if we look at ourselves I don't know
[1:08:58] if I'm going to make it you'll make it
[1:08:59] be have faith in the word
[1:09:01] if you don't think you're going to make
[1:09:02] it get to the doctor make sure you're
[1:09:03] going to make it but the bride knows who
[1:09:06] she is Rebecca has an anointing to
[1:09:09] recognize her position Lord Jesus we
[1:09:11] glorify your name we thank you for your
[1:09:13] word or we glorify you now and thank you
[1:09:15] for all you've given to us Lord let us
[1:09:17] begin to just focus and and meditate
[1:09:20] upon Lord what you have done in our
[1:09:22] lives bringing us to a maturity bringing
[1:09:25] the word to reality let the word strike
[1:09:28] us Lord every day let us believe and
[1:09:31] follow every step Lord that you can send
[1:09:34] a messenger to come Elijah to strike and
[1:09:37] find the bride Lord Jesus and here we
[1:09:40] are responded seems like a supernatural
[1:09:42] response it is because the Holy Ghost a
[1:09:46] supernatural God that knows the language
[1:09:47] of the Bride speaks to the heart of the
[1:09:49] people in our own language that we can
[1:09:52] understand what the world might not
[1:09:54] understand Lord I believe you have a
[1:09:56] language of the Bride that you speak to
[1:09:58] us in a supernatural experience a
[1:10:00] revelation is a a language that you give
[1:10:03] us the rest of the world will understand
[1:10:05] this language but Lord you have given us
[1:10:07] that that Supernatural Supernatural
[1:10:10] intelligence that that language to us
[1:10:12] becomes so real and we can hear you
[1:10:15] speak to us and we can see your word
[1:10:18] come into reality it's because you speak
[1:10:21] the language of the Bride Lord God that
[1:10:23] we have and it's the same language Lord
[1:10:26] you've always spoke Through the Bible
[1:10:27] Through the Ages the same Believers with
[1:10:30] the same language the same anointing
[1:10:32] believe in the same gospel bring the
[1:10:35] bride to the same position ready for a
[1:10:37] Rapture in Grace Lord I praise your name
[1:10:40] and we glorify you now Lord we give the
[1:10:42] people to you you'll move on the hearts
[1:10:45] of our families our homes dear God
[1:10:47] you'll help us to be better parents help
[1:10:49] us our children be better Believers Lord
[1:10:51] there's always more room for improvement
[1:10:53] in our walk Lord I want to be a better
[1:10:55] husband I want to be a better father I
[1:10:58] want to be a better provider I want to
[1:11:00] be a better exam simple to my children
[1:11:02] my home my wife and I'm sure Lord
[1:11:05] Jesus's sisters has the same desire she
[1:11:07] wants to be a better mother she wants to
[1:11:09] be a better wife or a husband dear God a
[1:11:12] better example
[1:11:14] Lord if we can have the spirit of Christ
[1:11:16] in our home
[1:11:17] if we can just laid everything to the
[1:11:20] altar
[1:11:21] if we can just love one another
[1:11:23] let the word bring that love in our
[1:11:26] homes let our children let our children
[1:11:29] feel that let them see God operating in
[1:11:33] our homes as young little fellas they
[1:11:35] need to see Mom and Daddy they need to
[1:11:37] see the prophet said don't take your
[1:11:39] children to a Sunday School
[1:11:41] you bring them this Sunday School
[1:11:43] it's not Sunday school that does it but
[1:11:45] mom and dad must bring them with them
[1:11:47] there's the example of the Prophet said
[1:11:50] take them there let them see God in you
