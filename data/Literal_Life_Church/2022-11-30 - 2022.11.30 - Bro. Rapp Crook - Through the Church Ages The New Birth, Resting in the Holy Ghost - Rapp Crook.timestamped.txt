[0:00] we made it glad for that and just uh
[0:03] just a month ago it I feel like I'm kind
[0:05] of rusty and out of uh out of rhythm
[0:08] because a month ago we had lost my voice
[0:10] uh one uh three or four days out of that
[0:13] week and it was just I I warned Brandon
[0:15] on Monday said I hope I can make it but
[0:18] just be ready just in case and and he
[0:21] was and I appreciate that but uh what's
[0:25] uh
[0:26] we finished up the uh we're toward the
[0:28] end of the uh smyrnian Church ages we're
[0:30] going through the uh Church age book and
[0:33] uh last time we I believe it was we
[0:36] talked about uh Alberta Brandon restored
[0:38] the truth that there's no eternal hell
[0:41] that uh that um you'll be it'll be a
[0:45] limited time of punishment but the only
[0:47] one form of eternal life and that's
[0:49] God's life and by making Eternal uh hell
[0:52] a place of geography
[0:54] um hell is just where you're at and the
[0:56] eternal life is where it's where God's
[0:58] at geography isn't the basis of what
[1:00] eternal life is it's a relationship and
[1:02] brother Branham restores that and it's
[1:04] just beautiful wait when you see it that
[1:06] way
[1:07] but toward the end of the uh um the
[1:09] Smyrna Church age
[1:11] um brother Brandon
[3:34] you can have Security in your
[3:36] relationship with God this is the kind
[3:39] of experience this Cliffhanger
[3:40] experience that's what the devil wants
[3:42] us to experience in her walk with God
[3:44] but what God wants us to experience
[3:48] is this
[3:49] it's still an exciting experience but is
[3:54] this person hanging on by his own
[3:56] strength he's not he's able to
[3:58] completely rest in the strength of the
[4:01] ropes and the strength every time how
[4:03] he's anchored and he's in a dangerous
[4:05] spot
[4:06] but he's resting and there's a picture
[4:10] and one from Brother Lonnie's teachings
[4:12] I got years ago and it's of of this guy
[4:16] hanging onto this chain link this this
[4:19] change he's going over the Flames of
[4:21] hell just hanging on for dear life I
[4:24] couldn't find that Graphics I had to
[4:25] come up with these but that's what the
[4:27] devil wants us to experience we're just
[4:29] hanging on for dear life but this is
[4:31] what it really is in the next picture
[4:33] was the fella is sitting in the chain
[4:37] and he is just gradually rioting across
[4:39] he's resting upon not his own muscles or
[4:43] his own grip he's resting on the
[4:45] strength of the chain and that chain is
[4:47] the grace of God will get us over and
[4:49] that's what we're trying to get here
[4:51] as and if I could just put the service
[4:52] in a nutshell
[4:54] the new birth is simple as God brings in
[4:58] the scriptures brother Branham teaches
[5:00] it it's simple the devil wants to make
[5:03] it complicated because if it's confusing
[5:05] he's got us if he can get us confused
[5:08] he's goddess because there we have it
[5:10] confusion is one of the Satan's Chief
[5:12] tools so if you're getting confused hey
[5:15] it's not the work of the Holy Spirit
[5:17] that's getting you confused
[5:20] we'll talk about how each Christian's
[5:22] experience will vary we don't we don't
[5:25] measure ourselves by ourselves we don't
[5:28] have to imitate somebody else's
[5:29] experience that's very human to do that
[5:33] but that's not how God works God is Not
[5:35] and they're creating cookie cutter
[5:37] Christians every single person is going
[5:41] to be unique and when we can rest in who
[5:44] we are in Christ rest in the Holy Ghost
[5:46] we will be the most individual that we
[5:49] have ever been when the when the world
[5:51] talks about individualism it seems like
[5:53] everybody gets more and more alike
[5:55] because they're getting pressed into the
[5:57] devil's image but when we're resting in
[6:00] who we are in Christ then true
[6:02] individuality comes out because it's the
[6:05] uniqueness of Christ and each one of us
[6:07] that's coming out
[6:10] we get actually get in God's way when we
[6:13] try to imitate another's experience been
[6:15] there done that yes we we get in God's
[6:19] way the book of Galatians says we don't
[6:21] want to frustrate the grace of God but
[6:23] we do that when we try to imitate
[6:25] someone's experience another's
[6:26] experience and lastly just try to hammer
[6:29] away if the new birth doesn't depend on
[6:31] us we repent we're baptized God does the
[6:36] rest we just continue on walking with
[6:39] him the devil wants us to think you've
[6:42] got to do this this this and this and
[6:43] then you might you might come into
[6:46] qualification to receive the new birth
[6:48] baloney that's what the devil wants us
[6:51] to think so that we won't even have the
[6:53] guts the boldness to enter into God's
[6:55] presence but no my son didn't have to
[6:58] worry can I present my list to Dad it's
[7:01] it's there's that relationship
[7:04] then the Acts 2 37
[7:07] you repent you're baptized in the Name
[7:10] of Christ for the remission of sins you
[7:12] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[7:14] God does not pay you the Holy Spirit he
[7:18] does not exchange you the Holy Spirit he
[7:20] gives you the Holy Spirit
[7:22] it's a promise it's unto you to your
[7:25] children to all that are far off as many
[7:27] as the Lord Our God shall call
[7:29] about a month ago I believe brother Ken
[7:31] Andes was here before coming he was just
[7:34] sharing how simple the new birth was and
[7:37] I just really appreciated his
[7:39] perspective on and he quoted this next
[7:41] scripture he says if you parents if you
[7:43] know how to give good gifts to your
[7:45] children
[7:46] and your carnal you're evil you know how
[7:49] to give good gifts to your children how
[7:51] much more shall your heavenly father
[7:54] give good things that ask of them
[7:57] and again
[7:59] the devil corrupts Us by saying yeah
[8:01] sand is watching you and only if you're
[8:03] really really good will you get
[8:05] something for Christmas that's parents
[8:08] have a different kind of relationship
[8:10] it's not paying it's you're giving out
[8:12] of the goodness of of of of of your
[8:14] heart but how the devil wants to switch
[8:16] that relationship in our minds and it's
[8:18] not the goodness of God it's not the
[8:20] grace of God it's our works to earn
[8:24] something from God that's what he wants
[8:26] to get
[8:27] and it was interesting this comparing
[8:29] this in the in the book of Acts when
[8:32] Simon the Sorcerer he wants he sees what
[8:35] what Peter's doing there in Samaria and
[8:37] he says mike Peter I'll pay you
[8:40] and if I can pay you enough will you
[8:42] give me the gift of the Holy Spirit and
[8:45] Peter says thy money perish with thee
[8:47] because you thought that you could
[8:49] purchase the gift of God with money
[8:51] now none of us have probably asked the
[8:54] Lord God how big of a check do you need
[8:55] to write and put an offering plate in
[8:57] order to get the Holy Spirit we haven't
[8:59] probably thought that way but we've
[9:01] probably thought how many hours can you
[9:03] spend at the altar how long do we need
[9:06] to fast how many how many of this that
[9:08] or the other thing do I have to have
[9:10] done before I can receive that
[9:12] and then we're thinking and we're really
[9:14] what we're thinking
[9:15] we're trying to buy it we're trying to
[9:18] get good enough and God's saying the
[9:19] same thing your good works perish with
[9:22] thee because you thought that you could
[9:24] purchase the gift of God with money and
[9:27] when someone is giving you a wonderful
[9:30] gift and then they want to pay you for
[9:33] it and pay you for it that almost ruins
[9:36] the gift experience because it just
[9:38] wants to be generous just just receive
[9:40] the gift and say thank you and
[9:41] appreciate but you want to pay it for me
[9:43] that ruins the giving experience if
[9:46] that's what the devil wants us to do he
[9:48] wants us to get the idea that we can pay
[9:50] enough but could we ever pay enough
[9:55] no all he's trying to do is to Rob us of
[9:59] the joy of serving God so he can keep us
[10:03] on pins and needles wondering am I going
[10:05] to make it am I going to make it this is
[10:07] a White Knuckle experience when really
[10:09] all we we can actually let go over the
[10:12] Rope because we're sitting in a seat
[10:14] that's eternally cure anchored by God
[10:17] himself we can sit back and enjoy the
[10:20] view and take our rest to take a little
[10:22] climb further take our rest that's the
[10:25] Christian experience that God intends
[10:28] for us one that is filled with joy and
[10:30] peace yes there will be trials yes there
[10:32] will be turbulence
[10:34] but through it all we can still have
[10:36] joy and peace so no we can't purchase
[10:39] the gift of God with money Simon
[10:41] couldn't it and we can't purchase any
[10:43] gift of God with any amount of good
[10:46] works
[10:51] in the book of Philippians Paul writes
[10:53] that we can be confident of this very
[10:56] thing they who began the good work in
[10:58] you will perform it to the day of Jesus
[11:00] Christ he is the author of it he's the
[11:03] finisher of it
[11:04] all we have is a role in the story but
[11:07] he's the author he's the finisher we can
[11:10] relax
[11:12] so like I right here in the notes the
[11:16] devil wants our Christian experience to
[11:18] be a white knuckled Cliffhanger when God
[11:20] intends for it to be a journey of peace
[11:23] and joy
[11:25] because we can rest secure what he's
[11:27] already done for us
[11:29] so this evening I Pray by God's grace
[11:31] that we can emphasize that the new birth
[11:33] it is a supernatural experience
[11:36] which makes it difficult to Define in
[11:39] its specifics we want to be able to nail
[11:41] down exactly what happened how it
[11:44] happened what happened when it happened
[11:45] and we won't have every single detail so
[11:48] we can be completely secure but it's a
[11:50] supernatural experience which is going
[11:51] to defy explanation of all things we're
[11:55] just going to have to accept some things
[11:56] by faith
[11:59] um when we focus on having a particular
[12:02] experience I will know I have had the
[12:04] Holy Spirit if I experience X if I get a
[12:07] revelation of x if I get something then
[12:09] if that's our mentality if we're not
[12:12] careful we're going to start pursuing
[12:14] that thing
[12:16] that Revelation that experience instead
[12:20] of pursuing Jesus Christ
[12:23] we get the cart before the horse
[12:25] but that's what the devil tries to get
[12:27] this to do we we unintentionally start
[12:30] seeking something else other than Christ
[12:32] and the devil loves it if he can get
[12:34] Christ clouded out of our picture then
[12:37] we're not looking at him if we're
[12:38] looking at him Paul writes in First
[12:41] Corinthians as we gaze At His Image were
[12:44] transformed into that image but if we
[12:47] can start looking at our own image and
[12:49] our own imperfections the devil's
[12:51] goddess because there's nothing that's
[12:52] going to be transforming us to be
[12:54] greater than that
[12:57] so without realizing when we have this
[12:59] mentality that I've got to have X or Y
[13:01] before I have the Holy Spirit and we
[13:03] pursue X or Y instead of Christ and then
[13:06] we're seeking God by our own Works
[13:10] instead of by faith and as soon as we
[13:14] start doing that we lose our peace we
[13:17] lose our joy and our Christian
[13:19] experience becomes a white knuckled
[13:22] cliffhanger
[13:23] I love the quotes for brother Branham
[13:25] talks about
[13:27] um how the Christian Life is built
[13:29] entirely upon rest
[13:31] and a couple of sermons in 1956 he he
[13:35] talks about this he talks about he woke
[13:36] up in the middle of the night and starts
[13:38] preaching to his wife and just sharing
[13:40] with her what God showed to him how the
[13:42] Christian Life is based solidly upon
[13:45] rest a Christian's not tossed about a
[13:50] Christian doesn't run from place to
[13:51] place a Christian isn't fuss fume worry
[13:55] about things a Christian rests
[14:00] it's all over
[14:02] it's all finished for the believer
[14:05] at Calvary
[14:07] at Calvary Jesus Christ is it calvary
[14:09] it's finished we've come to faith in
[14:12] Christ it's finished it's all finished
[14:14] there we've repented we've confessed his
[14:17] name the rest is just going to be
[14:20] working out what's already been put in
[14:22] this as we take in Christ's nutrients as
[14:24] we're in as we're receiving more if we
[14:26] continue walking with him the rest is
[14:28] just going to happen
[14:31] remember Minister ministering one time
[14:33] talking about why is the Old Testament
[14:36] so much longer than the New Testament
[14:38] why could the New Testament be so short
[14:41] well in the Old Testament a lot of
[14:44] Abraham's life is told a lot of David's
[14:47] life is told the ups and downs
[14:48] everything in between
[14:50] in the New Testament the only part that
[14:52] really needs telling is when somebody
[14:54] comes to Christ because you've got that
[14:56] part the rest is definite the rest is
[14:59] going to happen it doesn't really matter
[15:01] what happens after that because you've
[15:02] had that experience the rest doesn't
[15:04] need to be told
[15:05] so that's I think that's beautiful we
[15:07] can just rest
[15:10] amen
[15:17] the top of page two he says the whole
[15:19] principle the whole Christian principle
[15:21] is based upon rest
[15:25] and he says as he was lying there in bed
[15:27] next to his wife it was just burning in
[15:29] my heart resting he said why are we
[15:32] troubled Jesus said let not your hearts
[15:34] be troubled we're just resting come to
[15:37] me and ye can find rest
[15:40] but when our hearts are troubled where
[15:43] do we go
[15:45] a lot of times we don't go to Christ
[15:46] we'll go to our favorite playlist we'll
[15:50] go to our favorite podcast we'll go to
[15:52] our favorite whatever it is but not to
[15:55] Christ but let not your hearts be
[15:57] troubled Jesus said come to me and ye
[16:00] shall find rest why are we troubled
[16:04] because we're going somewhere else
[16:06] besides Christ because even you can be
[16:07] in the most difficult storm in your life
[16:10] yeah you can still experience rest there
[16:13] have we experienced that before it's
[16:15] just a supernatural thing why am I
[16:16] feeling this piece there's no way I
[16:18] should feel that but there's a calm in
[16:21] that storm because you're going to
[16:22] Christ with the troubles
[16:24] amen
[16:27] in the uh in the church age book we'll
[16:30] be reading some from the smyrnan church
[16:32] age
[16:33] and looking at um brother Brands can be
[16:36] emphasizing that the baptism of the Holy
[16:38] Ghost that's that's part of being born
[16:40] again
[16:41] and it's important to realize that God
[16:43] is sovereign
[16:44] and he's going to meet each person he'll
[16:46] meet each one of us
[16:48] as he chooses
[16:50] and we can have a desire God I want you
[16:52] to meet me just like this and if you
[16:54] meet me like this then I'll know that
[16:57] I've had the Holy Spirit
[16:59] but that kind of puts us on the throne
[17:02] and telling God how he needs to come to
[17:04] us and there's a situation is actually
[17:05] the reverse where we come to Christ and
[17:08] however he wants to come to us that's a
[17:10] that's up to him
[17:11] he's Sovereign he meets as he chooses
[17:14] and
[17:17] and the church age book about the part
[17:19] of the slides here I'm gonna pick up
[17:21] this is on page 157.
[17:28] he's talking about the Holy Spirit and
[17:30] he says now before we leave this subject
[17:32] I want to make myself very clear on what
[17:35] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[17:37] according to the word he said it's not
[17:39] according to me it's not according to
[17:41] you it has to be according to thus saith
[17:44] the Lord or we're falsely LED amen
[17:47] he says to begin with
[17:49] you'll notice in my meetings when I
[17:51] finished preaching an Evangelistic
[17:53] service or some teaching message I cast
[17:56] the net and invite a response from the
[17:58] people I asked him to come forward and
[18:00] receive the Holy Spirit
[18:02] everybody in the audience is hearing the
[18:04] same words come forward and receive the
[18:07] Holy Spirit but to some people they're
[18:09] hearing it one way people are hearing it
[18:11] a different way and how that's being
[18:13] translated affects what's being done
[18:15] he says my Pentecostal friends upon
[18:18] hearing me say this and invite people to
[18:20] come up and receive the Holy Spirit they
[18:22] they think I'm inviting people that come
[18:24] forward to be baptized with the Holy
[18:26] Ghost because they're already born again
[18:29] so when I invite those who are spirits
[18:31] filled to come and deal with those
[18:33] who've answered the invitation to
[18:35] receive the spirit these dear ones
[18:37] search forward and deal with the people
[18:39] in such manner as to encourage them to
[18:42] yield to God and believe to speak in
[18:43] tongues and this has caused a great deal
[18:46] of confusion
[18:48] and I want to tell you exactly what I
[18:49] mean I mean
[18:51] for The Sinner to come forward
[18:53] and be born again
[18:56] which is to be baptized into the body of
[19:00] Christ by the Holy Ghost
[19:03] and then you've got somebody dealing
[19:05] with them trying to get them to a
[19:06] certain experience that's actually
[19:07] bypassing what they need
[19:10] and he said I just want them to come
[19:12] forward be born again and they should be
[19:15] um
[19:15] and be born again which is be baptized
[19:18] in the body of Christ by the Holy Ghost
[19:20] which is exactly what took place at
[19:21] Pentecost when the church was launched
[19:24] in other words to be born of the spirit
[19:25] is to be truly baptized with the Holy
[19:28] Ghost it's one and the same
[19:30] think back to the day of Pentecost
[19:33] Peter's there preaching repent be
[19:36] baptized all of you in your name of the
[19:38] Holy Spirit you receive the gift of the
[19:39] Holy Ghost the spirit Falls
[19:42] it was that simple repent be baptized
[19:45] you receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[19:47] it was that simple every time it
[19:49] happened to the book of Acts repent be
[19:51] baptized they received the gifts of the
[19:53] holy spirit period there was nothing
[19:55] else involved and we can we can brother
[20:00] bread I'm saying it's all one and the
[20:02] same experience
[20:04] let me see
[20:09] I don't want to go too fast here sorry
[20:13] at the top of Page Three
[20:15] I didn't have everything on there
[20:18] um I should bother page two these
[20:20] directions
[20:21] came as a direct answer from Peter
[20:23] relative to what had actually happened
[20:25] at Pentecost what came to pass was that
[20:28] God according to Joel was pouring out
[20:30] the promised Holy Spirit upon All Flesh
[20:32] he wasn't poured out before that time or
[20:34] given before that time this was it but
[20:37] this was to come from now on by
[20:39] repenting being baptized in the name of
[20:42] the Jesus Christ and then God was Duty
[20:44] bound
[20:45] to fill the ones who came he's Duty
[20:48] bound to fill the ones with came you you
[20:50] step forward and do what Christ has
[20:51] asked you to do he's Duty bound he will
[20:55] fulfill this word
[20:56] Peter and then any of the Apostles never
[20:59] said you must be born again and then be
[21:02] filled with the Holy Spirit he didn't
[21:04] say that it could be come full repent be
[21:06] baptized you shall be filled with the
[21:08] gift of the Holy Spirit and
[21:11] we think of it sometimes as multiple
[21:14] experiences because we're humans
[21:17] but because we thank God something
[21:19] happened with me at this particular
[21:22] meeting and then I go on and something
[21:24] else happens to another meeting and then
[21:25] something else happens at another
[21:26] meeting we're Bound by time and that's
[21:29] just that's how we see things but to God
[21:30] that's outside of time to God starts
[21:33] working in their lives it's all one
[21:35] experience to God
[21:37] and we think I'm close to God when I
[21:39] feel this presence there in the meeting
[21:41] and when they go away I'm at work or I'm
[21:42] at home I'm further away from God but no
[21:45] we're still walking with God it's all
[21:47] part of the same spiritual walk with God
[21:50] you can be walking with God anywhere
[21:52] you're at
[21:54] it's all the same thing
[21:56] and then John 8 31 I don't have this in
[21:59] the in the slides but Jesus said to the
[22:02] Jews who believed on him
[22:03] if ye continue in my word then you're my
[22:07] disciples indeed you believe Keep On
[22:09] Believing it's all the same experience
[22:12] God's going to do it you're my disciples
[22:14] and all you have to do
[22:17] is believe you step out in faith and
[22:20] keep out on stepping out in faith and
[22:22] keep on walking with him he's going to
[22:23] fulfill it you don't have to wonder do I
[22:26] have to do I have to be special perfect
[22:28] a certain way just keep walking that's
[22:31] all there is to it
[22:33] that's simple now some of us like to I
[22:37] know we like to but we tend to approach
[22:39] our walk with God as in a sort of a
[22:42] checklist mentality okay I've repented
[22:45] check I've been baptized check and then
[22:49] now I'm ready for the spirit
[22:52] so I haven't and let me think okay I'll
[22:55] pray longer I'll pray longer check oh
[22:58] fast some check and before long we're
[23:01] doing these good things we have the
[23:03] attitude by praying longer I'm getting
[23:06] God's arm I'm twisting it twist until he
[23:08] says Uncle okay okay I'll give you the
[23:09] holy spirit because you finally prayed
[23:11] long enough
[23:12] that's not the relationship that God has
[23:15] with us that's not the relationship that
[23:17] we have with our children or that our
[23:19] parents should have with us we're just
[23:21] seeking God that's all that it is so
[23:24] there is no checklist mentality
[23:27] my brother Branham says the apostolic
[23:30] way God had no set rule when I saw this
[23:34] quote the first I said whoa hold up no
[23:36] set rule Acts 2 38 to set rule you got
[23:40] to repent got to be baptized and then
[23:42] you'll to me that was a set rule but you
[23:44] know what God's Sovereign Peter
[23:46] Cornelius never got baptized but he
[23:49] received the gift of the Holy Spirit and
[23:51] I think for God that was God showing to
[23:54] Peter Cornelius the Gentiles good enough
[23:56] for me he better be good enough for you
[23:59] now Peter
[24:00] he was doing away with all of Peter's
[24:03] judaistic checklists and God loves to do
[24:07] away with our checklist also when the
[24:10] heart's hungry
[24:12] he'll give you what you're hungry for
[24:14] and the devil loves to give us all kinds
[24:18] of junk food
[24:20] to say our hunger
[24:22] but if we keep hungering keep continuing
[24:25] you know if you if you keep following a
[24:27] diet it's going to have an effect on you
[24:29] how hard is to keep following that diet
[24:32] but if we continue in his word it's
[24:36] going to have an effect on us if you
[24:39] want the Holy Ghost it can fall on you
[24:41] right now hold up it can't be that
[24:43] simple it can't no it is that simple
[24:46] when you want to come to God God wants
[24:49] to fill us more than a week you can even
[24:50] imagine being filled we can't how can
[24:53] how can the child comprehend the love
[24:56] that his or her parent has for her
[24:59] there's no way that the child can
[25:02] understand what it means for a parent to
[25:04] love them
[25:05] no way
[25:07] we can't imagine how much God loved us
[25:10] how much God wants to bless us and do
[25:12] good for us it's we're so separate from
[25:14] we we can't have that imagination but
[25:16] God
[25:17] wants it that much so there's no
[25:20] checklist mentality
[25:22] there is a promise blessed are they who
[25:25] hunger and thirst after righteousness
[25:26] for they shall be filled
[25:29] so if you haven't been filled yet and
[25:32] you're just hungering and thirsting
[25:34] you're already blessed hungering and
[25:37] thirsting is a great blessing because
[25:40] how many people out in the world aren't
[25:42] hungering and thirsting after God to
[25:45] have a hunger for God that's the great
[25:47] one of the greatest things in life to
[25:49] hunger for God that is not something to
[25:51] be taken for granted in the days of
[25:53] Moses Noah God said my spirit will not
[25:56] always strive with man so that God is
[25:59] striving and pulling Upon Our Hearts
[26:01] that's a great thing because there's no
[26:04] guarantee that'll go forever it's a
[26:06] wonderful thing but there's a promise
[26:08] you're blessed because you're hungering
[26:10] and thirsting for God because you shall
[26:13] be filled not because of the work that
[26:16] you've done not because of how good
[26:17] you've been how hard you've prayed how
[26:20] much you've fasted not because of that
[26:22] because God loves you it is his promise
[26:25] and he'll fulfill it
[26:28] Satan loves confusion though confusion
[26:31] robs us of blessings of what God has
[26:34] already done for us Satan doesn't want
[26:37] us to have this glorious experience
[26:38] looking out of her God's Great creation
[26:41] and climbing up the rocks to to meet God
[26:43] up and he doesn't want us to have this
[26:45] glorious experience but by confusing us
[26:48] he makes this what God intends his
[26:50] glorious journey into this Cliffhanger
[26:53] experience
[26:54] confusion robbers of blessings of what
[26:58] God has already done for us you can
[27:01] remember an experience with God you
[27:02] might have been God just for the working
[27:04] there in your life and you feel so close
[27:06] to God you're like man God am I in this
[27:09] child he loves me so much and then you
[27:12] get away from that
[27:13] and you start thinking man do I have the
[27:15] Holy Spirit or not
[27:17] does the Lord really love me or have I
[27:19] have I sinned away my day of Grace we
[27:21] have those kinds of questions sometimes
[27:24] what's the devil doing there he's
[27:27] confusing us to take away what God's
[27:29] already done for us because he touched
[27:32] our hearts there if he began working in
[27:34] our hearts he's the author he's the
[27:36] finisher a lot of us husbands might
[27:38] leave home projects half done
[27:41] God doesn't
[27:43] he finishes his own projects he's not
[27:46] going to leave us hanging there
[27:47] wondering is it going to happen or not
[27:49] he's it's going to get done it's gonna
[27:52] get done
[27:53] he's the author and the finisher we can
[27:55] rest in that confusion Rob this of what
[27:58] God is of enjoying what God's already
[28:00] done for us
[28:02] so if we notice confusion in our life
[28:05] God is not the author of it
[28:08] Satan is the author of any confusion in
[28:10] her life and if we're getting confused
[28:12] go back to the basics
[28:15] what's the most frequently told Bible
[28:18] story in the book of throughout the Old
[28:19] Testament
[28:21] the story of Israel coming out of Egypt
[28:24] that's made into songs sung again and
[28:28] again and again and again
[28:30] why so that it stays in their memory so
[28:33] it's imprinted that we are God's chosen
[28:36] people he did so much to draw us out of
[28:39] Egypt he preserved us the Wilderness In
[28:42] Spite of Ourselves and it's told again
[28:45] and again and again and again and we
[28:49] should do that same kind of thing with
[28:50] our kids sing Jesus loves me this I know
[28:54] why so it gets in their mind it stays in
[28:57] their mind they'll forget all kinds of
[28:58] things but get it in their mind so they
[29:01] know Jesus does love me he has a plan
[29:04] for my life so that's that's that's
[29:06] there
[29:07] and that we can forget our own testimony
[29:09] sometimes I actually remember going down
[29:12] to Louisiana Camp God touched my life as
[29:14] a 13 year old three or four years down
[29:16] the road I was getting discouraged and
[29:17] commands anything ever happened and I
[29:19] did an amazing thing I actually talked
[29:21] to my dad that's really hard for
[29:23] teenagers to do right and dads could say
[29:25] hey I can tell you one thing rap you
[29:27] went down to that camp but you came back
[29:29] somebody different
[29:30] and I'd forgotten that
[29:33] how often do we forget our own testimony
[29:36] when when the children in the Old
[29:38] Testament as the children of Israel are
[29:40] going through things if God met Abraham
[29:42] Isaac or Jacob and he did something for
[29:45] him they made an altar of stones there
[29:48] why says they're going back they'll see
[29:51] that hey look there's an altar oh I
[29:54] remember what God did this is Bethel hey
[29:56] boys this is where I spent all night I
[29:59] couldn't sleep and I finally got to
[30:01] sleep and I got this dream of this
[30:03] ladder Angels going up and down up and
[30:05] down and I put this all here so I
[30:08] wouldn't forget about it
[30:09] so when God does something in their
[30:11] lives make a big altar so that we can be
[30:14] reminded of it
[30:15] and I've got in the back of my Bible
[30:17] here I've got a couple sticky notes of
[30:21] dated what God's done for me
[30:24] I can remember this one was this is
[30:25] Wednesday
[30:27] July 11 2001 and this person was I want
[30:32] victory in this area of my life I want
[30:34] to be encouraged not discouraged by
[30:36] stronger Christians
[30:38] think why could you be discouraged by
[30:40] stronger Christians because you look at
[30:41] it man
[30:43] you could never be like that and if I've
[30:45] got to be like that to get the gift of
[30:47] the Holy Ghost I'm a lost cause
[30:51] but you know what I put that there this
[30:54] is the request and then put on the back
[30:57] of it I think God's really done this for
[30:59] me absolutely done it for me and this is
[31:01] my little altar of stones
[31:03] because it reminds you what God's done
[31:06] for you so I don't know if you put
[31:08] something on your mirror wherever there
[31:10] and there in your car if God's done
[31:12] something for you if he's right right in
[31:14] your Bible a day so then you're building
[31:15] this little altar as you're reading oh
[31:17] yeah God did something for me he is
[31:19] author of my faith he's continuing the
[31:21] story he's he's not the fixed man that
[31:24] stops he's continuing and I'm still in
[31:27] this experience with God he hasn't
[31:29] stopped
[31:30] amen
[31:32] now the spiritual nature of the new
[31:35] birth
[31:36] makes it difficult for us to pin the
[31:39] particulars down
[31:41] we'd love to be able to say I know
[31:43] exactly on this date this time the Holy
[31:46] Spirit came into my life sometimes
[31:48] that's possible
[31:50] I can remember there was a teenager we
[31:52] were in
[31:53] um little youth group and the youth
[31:55] leader asked how many of you are able to
[31:58] remember the date and time when God
[31:59] filled your Holy Spirit and I remember a
[32:01] couple of them raised their hands like
[32:03] wow
[32:04] these are really super spiritual young
[32:06] people
[32:07] but you know what those ones who were so
[32:10] confident this day this time God did
[32:12] something for me they're gone now
[32:15] they're completely out in the world you
[32:18] wouldn't it's amazing
[32:21] gone
[32:22] and maybe they were looking more I
[32:24] finally achieved this
[32:27] and then you're doing it based upon your
[32:29] own works and you're seeking this
[32:30] experience and you're seeking The
[32:32] Experience instead of actually seeking
[32:34] Christ
[32:35] and we get the ex the devil left I don't
[32:38] know how the this is how it happened we
[32:40] get the experience but we don't continue
[32:43] on because I think I just got the
[32:44] experience all I have to have but the
[32:46] Christ says no I want you want me keep
[32:48] on going chase after me don't stop with
[32:50] the experience go after me continue in
[32:52] my word follow after me that's what it's
[32:54] all about don't stop whenever you've got
[32:57] this particular Revelation or this
[32:59] particular experience this would ever
[33:00] keep on with God keep on walking with
[33:02] him that's what it's all about not
[33:04] anything this that or other
[33:08] amen it's a spiritual experience
[33:11] Supernatural experience defies full
[33:14] explanation leave it that way
[33:18] John 3 8 says the wind blows where it
[33:20] listeth
[33:22] you hear the sound thereof but you can't
[33:24] tell where it's coming from
[33:26] or where it's going
[33:28] so is everyone that's born of the spirit
[33:31] that's a description
[33:34] of the new birth it happens you can see
[33:36] the wind
[33:37] going back and forth little kids will
[33:39] observe it Dad where's the wind come
[33:42] from
[33:44] kids can ask some good questions comes
[33:47] from the Lord how's the New Birth come
[33:49] from what do you have to do to get it
[33:51] just follow the lord repent and be
[33:53] baptized and God will take care of it
[33:55] that wind will come
[33:56] amen
[33:58] brother Branham quotes this and he
[33:59] speaks the following you don't know
[34:01] where it comes from where it's been
[34:02] where it's going where is that wind but
[34:05] you know one thing where it's going to
[34:07] take you
[34:08] wherever it come from it doesn't matter
[34:10] but it'll take you back with it that's
[34:13] the important thing we think if I know
[34:15] how I got this
[34:17] where that wind came from that wind came
[34:20] because I did this and I did this then I
[34:22] approached God this way and I finally
[34:24] did this long enough and then all that
[34:26] wind came
[34:27] we're saying we know where it came from
[34:29] but no that wind came from a sovereign
[34:32] Act of God we can't do any other way
[34:36] I might have told this story before I
[34:38] can remember a Young Guy's young men's
[34:40] bible study prayer meeting was just a
[34:43] spontaneous thing years back I was
[34:45] probably 16 17 years old
[34:48] remember the car I drove it was two-tone
[34:50] old 1984 I think it was your aunt's car
[34:53] by the time that I bought off of him
[34:55] there was an old car but I uh I met up
[34:59] with John but the John Brooks's mothers
[35:01] and we had a little prayer meeting in
[35:02] the basement of his parents house they
[35:04] it was just still being worked on
[35:06] just got together and we started praying
[35:09] and it was just a sovereign thing the
[35:11] Holy One brother started oh started in
[35:12] prayer and then we just one brother
[35:15] praise and the spirit of prayer just
[35:17] came down that goes from one brother to
[35:18] another brother to another brother we
[35:20] were there for I don't know how long it
[35:22] was but it was just a sovereign Act of
[35:24] God
[35:25] a couple weeks later hey guys let's get
[35:27] together for a prayer meeting so we get
[35:29] to send the same Brothers together I'm
[35:30] thinking okay
[35:31] this brother opened in prayer last time
[35:34] it worked out really good we'll ask the
[35:36] same breath of the opening prayer this
[35:38] time and it was as flat as anything
[35:41] because we tried to say we know where it
[35:43] came from came because we did this this
[35:45] this and this that's not how spiritual
[35:47] experiences work it's Sovereign just get
[35:50] together and like yes we want to be with
[35:52] God we don't but he planned it you can't
[35:54] plan that spiritual experience you just
[35:56] get together with an open heart hunger
[35:58] for God and who knows what will happen
[36:00] but we only know one thing wherever it
[36:02] came from it doesn't matter however it
[36:03] got there it doesn't matter but it
[36:05] didn't depend on us came from God but
[36:07] it'll take you right back with it
[36:09] I love this quote I don't know the
[36:12] mechanics of the Holy Ghost for the
[36:13] Branham said but I know it fell on me I
[36:16] can't tell the mechanics of it but I
[36:18] know the blessings of it that's all I
[36:21] care to know about it is the blessings
[36:23] of the Holy Ghost and mechanics he works
[36:26] them that's his secret
[36:29] I read this quote over the summer said
[36:31] wow that's beautiful we all want to
[36:33] figure out the mechanics so we can give
[36:35] the handbook here's how you receive the
[36:36] Holy Ghost brother follow these
[36:38] mechanics that's not how it works it's
[36:40] his secret we just go trust relax in him
[36:44] amen
[36:48] sometimes we get so focused on trying to
[36:52] figure out the mechanics
[36:53] that we miss the forest for the trees
[36:57] I tried to figure out the particulars of
[36:59] our own experience that were the keys we
[37:01] think man this is exactly what it was
[37:02] and we miss what God actually was doing
[37:06] there
[37:07] and um
[37:09] First John 3 7 talks about how there
[37:11] were three that bear record in heaven
[37:12] the father of the word the Holy Ghost
[37:14] these three are one there's three that
[37:16] bear with this Nerf the spirit the word
[37:18] and the blood and these three agree in
[37:20] one and brother Bram uses us to talk
[37:22] about how the natural birth and the
[37:24] spiritual birth go in parallel
[37:27] water blood spirit that's how it is
[37:31] naturally and spiritually
[37:33] and I think about this uh this little
[37:35] child
[37:36] does he remember
[37:38] being born and being held like a biased
[37:40] mother like this
[37:42] no he doesn't
[37:44] it would be really strange if he becomes
[37:46] a teenager gets to be about 18 19 20
[37:48] years old and he wants to go find out
[37:50] was I really born
[37:52] I want to go find out that birth
[37:55] certificate I want to know where it
[37:57] really happened what time it actually
[37:59] happened who was the doctor who signed
[38:01] it who was the nurse present that'd be
[38:04] really really weird
[38:06] but you know what that's what we
[38:08] sometimes do we want to pry into this
[38:11] Supernatural experience so much that we
[38:13] almost destroy the supernatural
[38:15] experience what this child doesn't need
[38:18] to have physical proof he's alive he's
[38:20] alive that's enough
[38:22] and our inability to remember details
[38:27] of our physical birth doesn't alter the
[38:30] fact of our birth
[38:32] our inability to understand when how we
[38:38] were spiritually Born Again doesn't
[38:40] alter the fact that we've been born
[38:42] again has God changed our hearts yes are
[38:47] we different than what we used to be yes
[38:49] relax enjoy it you don't trying to
[38:53] understand every single thing is just as
[38:55] ridiculous as this little baby growing
[38:57] up I want to see my birth certificate to
[38:59] know that I'm alive take your pulse to
[39:02] have a desire for God yes you're alive
[39:04] God's going to work on you because that
[39:06] desire for God you weren't born with it
[39:08] I mean that God put into you that's a
[39:11] real special special thing
[39:13] amen
[39:15] brother Branham says water blood spirit
[39:18] same thing just as you go along the
[39:20] three elements that those are the three
[39:21] elements that take you back into the
[39:23] body like it brings from your natural
[39:25] birth it types your spiritual birth the
[39:28] baby's born the first things water next
[39:30] blood that's in life
[39:32] that's the way you come into the kingdom
[39:33] of God the same way
[39:36] do you have a physical do you have a
[39:37] natural desire for God no but do you are
[39:39] you feeling a desire for God that's a
[39:41] supernatural thing to take your pulse
[39:43] I'm alive enjoy the enjoy the journey
[39:46] from there on out
[39:49] brother Paul and different other
[39:50] brothers have been telling in the last
[39:51] year or so
[39:53] the story of a man who came to brother
[39:55] Brandon one day he sees this tract is
[39:59] there a way to be saved and he picks up
[40:01] the tracks and he just starts reading it
[40:03] and reading it and reading it and it
[40:06] grips him and he prays a simple prayer
[40:08] of faith and then he goes on his journey
[40:12] but somewhere along the journey some
[40:14] confusion came along and he came to
[40:17] brother Branham come sits on this poor
[40:19] brother Branham I was once a businessman
[40:22] I've spent years trying to get saved
[40:25] that might sound a little bit like us
[40:27] I've spent years trying to get the Holy
[40:29] Spirit I spent years trying to do
[40:31] whatever
[40:32] um and he was telling all of his trouble
[40:34] so his wife went down and got the spirit
[40:36] but he couldn't get the spirit
[40:39] and here we have it says what do you
[40:42] mean brother he told me where he was
[40:44] from he expressed himself and they said
[40:47] are you trying to get saved he says yes
[40:49] I'm trying to get saved I said the Lord
[40:52] wants and he says I believe I've crossed
[40:54] the line brother Brandon where you can't
[40:56] get saved anymore so oh I don't know
[40:58] about that
[40:59] only tells the story I went to my
[41:01] brother Billy Graham's meetings a famous
[41:04] preacher and he told me to do this and I
[41:06] went to the inquiry room and had a
[41:08] meeting we prayed together and something
[41:10] then nothing happened after that they
[41:12] said it was safe but nothing happened
[41:13] then they went over to another the free
[41:16] methodists and they said you just got to
[41:17] get Sanctified and experience with God
[41:19] and I got happy enough so I could shout
[41:21] and but you know what I didn't feel like
[41:24] I still didn't have it they went to
[41:25] Brother Oral Roberts meetings and they
[41:27] said I spoke with tongues and but but
[41:29] the Branham I still ain't got it he says
[41:33] and well brother Brandon says here I
[41:35] took the liberty here to to color code
[41:37] the conversation the Green's going to be
[41:40] brother Branham speaking
[41:41] and blue is going to be the brother
[41:43] speaking back to him he says my brother
[41:44] the only thing you're just confused
[41:48] and I said the confusion is one of the
[41:50] key key strategies of the devil to take
[41:53] away the blessings of a God that's
[41:55] already done for you and we're going to
[41:57] see it happening here
[41:59] you're just confused I want to ask you
[42:01] something
[42:02] did you always love the Lord Jesus
[42:07] and he says well I belong to the
[42:09] Pentecostal church but I just went there
[42:13] and says well what happened that you
[42:15] change your mind all at once you grew up
[42:16] in the Pentecostal church but I just I
[42:19] just went there wasn't anything personal
[42:21] and brother Brandon Maxwell why did you
[42:23] change your mind he says well one day I
[42:25] was coming in for making a sale out in
[42:27] the yard and I happened to reach in my
[42:29] pocket and somebody had given me a
[42:30] little old tract and I sat down in the
[42:34] office and began to read distracting the
[42:37] awful ass feeling come over me that I
[42:40] ought to get right with God
[42:42] and I've been searching ever since
[42:45] and the brother bam stops and says I
[42:48] want to ask you something
[42:50] when this feeling came over you you'd
[42:52] never been able to get out of it
[42:55] no I haven't
[42:57] he says well that's when you received
[42:59] Christ
[43:01] it doesn't mean raising up your hands
[43:03] that's all right shouting speaking in
[43:06] tongues all these demonstrations that's
[43:08] attributes that follows this but first
[43:10] is to receive Christ
[43:12] he thought he had to have this this this
[43:14] or the other thing to receive Christ but
[43:17] that desire
[43:19] that's the all telling that's your
[43:21] spiritual pulse is that desire still
[43:23] there
[43:25] they asked them brother Brandon I've
[43:27] been saved all the time
[43:29] sure look do you love him with all my
[43:33] heart well one time you didn't love him
[43:36] that's right
[43:39] and now you do love them that's the
[43:41] truth
[43:42] well you had them all the time
[43:45] it's simple
[43:47] you you hear the call however that call
[43:49] is you respond to it you repent the
[43:54] baptized you shall receive the gift of
[43:55] the Holy Ghost period
[43:58] period we think all these other things
[44:00] have to happen in between and sometimes
[44:03] they might but they don't have to
[44:05] repent you're hungering for it God will
[44:08] give it to you period And when they you
[44:12] well you had them all the time and then
[44:13] he jumped off the porch began crying
[44:16] holding me his arms oh god I've been a
[44:18] Christian all these years
[44:20] but you see the thing of it was he
[44:22] wasn't straightened out in the beginning
[44:25] and here's how a wrong conception or a
[44:28] wrong understanding of how God works
[44:31] man you might have started with God and
[44:33] he and you you had a supernatural
[44:35] experience you were born again the devil
[44:37] has you deceived for years thinking
[44:39] you're not and you're just thinking oh
[44:41] my I hope I'm good enough for God the
[44:43] devil's telling you're not a wild man
[44:45] but you just keep right on going you
[44:46] keep right on going and you keep running
[44:48] going because your desire is so strong
[44:51] it pushes back against all those lies
[44:53] you keep pushing back pushing back
[44:56] but he's with you all the time you
[44:58] already had that the devil's making a
[45:00] White Knuckle experience that doesn't
[45:02] have to be that way we can rest in the
[45:07] Holy Spirit
[45:08] and of course some folks can hear this
[45:10] say my then you can just make Grace
[45:12] disgrace because you don't have to do
[45:13] anything you have to seek after God or
[45:15] anything but I tell you if you've got a
[45:16] real desire after God you're going to
[45:18] run after him and pursue him you're not
[45:20] going to desire anything else you're not
[45:22] going to desire to go out in the world
[45:23] and maintain a confession you might do
[45:26] something wrong but you desire so bad to
[45:28] get right back in the community with
[45:29] them that's the strong spiritual pulse
[45:32] that there is that desire you're going
[45:34] to fail but you know when the Christian
[45:35] Falls a Christian always going to fall
[45:37] forward because you're going to get back
[45:39] up and you're still making progress
[45:42] you can't fall away you'll fall forward
[45:45] amen every experience every Christian's
[45:48] experience can be different
[45:52] I just want to talk about that for a few
[45:53] minutes here
[45:55] second Corinthians 10 12 says they
[45:58] measure themselves by themselves
[45:59] comparing themselves among themselves
[46:01] they are not wise
[46:05] but that's what so many of us do and I
[46:08] can remember I've you might have told me
[46:10] I've told you before I'm in youth
[46:13] meeting sitting next to my best friend
[46:14] and he's just raising his hands and
[46:16] worshiping God tears streaming down his
[46:18] face like Niagara Falls I think man he's
[46:21] so spiritual I'm just squeezing my eyes
[46:23] as hard as I can and I can't get
[46:25] anything to come out of my eyes like man
[46:27] I'm a hopeless case but that's just
[46:29] different how we're made
[46:31] it doesn't mean anything else well God
[46:33] man looked on the outward appearance we
[46:36] look on that word appearance say my how
[46:38] many ounces of Tears did you let I
[46:39] didn't let that much I'm that much
[46:41] further from God but God looked at our
[46:43] hearts and that's the most important
[46:45] things when we compare each other with
[46:47] each other we make it a carnal race and
[46:51] that's not a wise thing
[46:53] at all
[46:54] I can remember reading in the message
[46:57] things are to be for the first time
[46:59] I was probably uh 20 21 years old I'm
[47:03] reading this as the first time and it
[47:04] was such a blessing it was really
[47:06] freeing and liberating just seeing how
[47:08] God is all kinds he's a god of variety
[47:11] that's what it says he's a god of
[47:13] variety
[47:14] and he made all of you in a variety some
[47:16] men are real blusterous some are real
[47:19] dogmatic others are fine others are kind
[47:23] and they just find all different kinds
[47:25] of people
[47:26] and in his kingdom
[47:31] the dogmatic people are in his kingdom
[47:35] the blusterous people are in his people
[47:38] are in his kingdom he doesn't say the
[47:40] blusterous person's kind
[47:42] he doesn't say the dogmatic person's
[47:44] fine but he says God makes him all a
[47:47] different way and they're all in his
[47:50] kingdom
[47:52] and when I read this man that just helps
[47:54] me relax
[47:57] and it says uh look at Saint Peter and
[48:00] judge him by Andrew this is on page six
[48:03] see Andrew is that prayer Warrior
[48:06] he just stayed on his knees all the time
[48:09] whereas Peter fell asleep in the Garden
[48:11] of Gethsemane
[48:13] the Apostle Peter is one of those fire
[48:15] brands that just preached the house down
[48:17] Andrew you only see him a couple of
[48:20] times he brings the boy with the with
[48:22] the Five Loaves two fishes to Jesus he
[48:24] brings another friend to Jesus another
[48:26] friend of Jesus he's just really good at
[48:27] bringing individuals to Jesus
[48:30] that Peter's out there and he's just
[48:32] he's just like he is his name's on the
[48:35] advertisement for special meetings
[48:36] everyone's right there everyone's there
[48:39] because it's going to be a special
[48:40] experience
[48:42] Andrew doesn't get special meetings he
[48:44] brings in one by one
[48:45] Andrew didn't have Andrew wasn't the one
[48:49] who multiplied the loaves he just
[48:50] brought the one to Jesus he's just this
[48:52] guy in the background
[48:54] but he's still on his kingdom
[48:58] Paul was more scholarly like
[49:01] I can imagine Peter and Paul to have
[49:03] complexes about each other because Paul
[49:05] wasn't a good speaker and he was he was
[49:08] he wasn't comfortable in front of people
[49:09] but I think Peter you give him an
[49:11] audience he'd just come alive
[49:14] Paul likes you really carefully think
[49:16] things through and Peter's reading he
[49:18] said man Paul he writes things that are
[49:20] really hard to be understood and he
[49:22] might have been tempted to say Paul he's
[49:24] just an intellectual he might have been
[49:26] tempted to say that but he says they're
[49:28] all in his kingdom
[49:31] see
[49:33] Moses wrote the first four books of the
[49:35] Old Testament he wrote the first five
[49:36] books actually he wrote the Old
[49:38] Testament the rest of it was the laws
[49:39] King so forth someone with the prophets
[49:41] Moses wrote the law the different books
[49:43] of the Bible and then it goes on and on
[49:46] Paul rewrites much of the New Testament
[49:48] Matthew Mark Luke and John Paul
[49:49] separates law and Grace puts it into
[49:51] place
[49:53] but he's using such a variety of
[49:55] different people to do this that's a
[49:57] beautiful thing he does the same thing
[49:59] today we don't we can just be at rest in
[50:03] the way God made us whether we're
[50:04] dogmatic or blusterous or kind or find
[50:07] we don't have to change ourselves we
[50:10] just have to die to self and God will
[50:12] use whatever nature he put in this into
[50:14] his glory and that'll be the expression
[50:16] of Christ that only you can express and
[50:19] we can just rest in that
[50:23] the important thing is that the Holy
[50:26] Spirit works in your life it doesn't
[50:27] matter what kind of personality we have
[50:28] or don't have
[50:30] the important thing is the holy spirit
[50:31] works in your life just leave the how up
[50:35] to him
[50:39] so what is the uh the evidence of the
[50:41] holy spirit it's not seeking this thing
[50:43] that thing this or that experience it's
[50:45] just continuing with them are we just
[50:47] going to continue with him and um in the
[50:50] Book of Revelation every single Church
[50:52] age ends with the hath and ear to hear
[50:55] Let Them hear what the spirit saath to
[50:58] the churches and on page 183 here
[51:02] um
[51:03] let me find it
[51:10] it says um
[51:12] I want you to notice very carefully that
[51:15] Jesus did not say that the evidence of
[51:17] being baptized with the Holy Ghost was
[51:18] speaking in tongues interpreting
[51:20] prophesying shouting dancing he said the
[51:23] evidence would be that you would be in
[51:25] the truth you would be in the word of
[51:26] God for your age evidence has to do with
[51:28] receiving the word the evidence of a
[51:32] Spirit-filled Christian believer is not
[51:34] to produce the truth but to receive the
[51:37] truth
[51:38] to believe and Obey it the spirit gives
[51:41] the word if you have the spirit you'll
[51:43] hear the word for your age and just
[51:45] continue in it and I like that statement
[51:47] the EV the the evidence of the
[51:50] Spirit-filled Christian believer is not
[51:51] to produce the truth to live a certain
[51:54] life that is so Flawless or whatever
[51:56] this it's not producing the truth it's
[51:58] to
[51:59] receive the truth Jesus said my sheep
[52:01] hear my voice
[52:04] that's the indication who is sheep are
[52:06] he didn't say my sheep produced the best
[52:09] quality wool that's how I know they're
[52:10] my she didn't say that he said my sheep
[52:12] hear my voice that's the important thing
[52:15] doesn't my sheep have particular bad no
[52:17] just all this it's not what they should
[52:19] produce
[52:20] it's what the sheep hear
[52:22] that's the evidence of being a real
[52:25] Spirit-filled believer
[52:29] so going on the evidence being that you
[52:32] receive the word for your age and
[52:33] continue in that
[52:35] John 14 26 the comforter which is the
[52:37] Holy Ghost whom the father will send
[52:39] into my name he shall teach you all
[52:41] things
[52:42] the holy spirit will teach all things
[52:44] and if you receive the Holy Spirit
[52:45] you're going to be receiving what he's
[52:47] teaching that's the that's an Evidence
[52:49] of that
[52:50] Revelation 2 7 he that hasn't here let
[52:54] him hear
[52:56] and then on page 153 the evidence is
[52:59] hearing what the spirit says and it's
[53:02] really interesting if you look at the
[53:03] seven if you look up fast forward to the
[53:05] seventh Church age delayed the CN age
[53:08] this is the only age that's talking
[53:11] saying I am this I am that I am rich and
[53:15] increased with Goods I have needed
[53:16] nothing it's the only age that's talking
[53:19] the evidence isn't how much we're
[53:21] speaking how much we're producing the
[53:23] evidence is just hearing and receiving
[53:26] the truth the spirit's talking
[53:28] the spirit's teaching that's what Jesus
[53:30] said would come
[53:31] now when we hear this
[53:33] evidence of the holy spirit is receiving
[53:36] the word for your age like man that
[53:38] means I've got to understand everything
[53:41] and that can be like a really high high
[53:45] um
[53:45] barrier to overcome
[53:48] and Jesus said in Matthew 13
[53:50] blessed are your eyes for they see in
[53:53] your ears for they hear and this is
[53:54] after Jesus is going into The Parables
[53:56] of the Kingdom like The Parables of the
[53:58] seed the sower different ones like this
[54:01] and I can imagine the disciples when
[54:03] they when he says this Bluster your eyes
[54:05] or they see your ears for they say Yes
[54:07] man we feel special because we hear we
[54:10] know this is the one we're feeling
[54:12] really special and super
[54:14] but as You Follow The Parables Jesus
[54:17] tell us the parable of the sower you
[54:18] tell us the parable the tares and um
[54:22] then the crowd goes away they don't get
[54:24] it
[54:25] but you know the disciples don't get it
[54:27] either
[54:29] after Jesus sends the maltes away
[54:32] they're both they're together with them
[54:34] in the house in the privacy of the house
[54:36] they feel
[54:37] able to be open enough I say Jesus we
[54:40] didn't get it
[54:42] could you explain
[54:44] the parable of the tears of the field at
[54:46] first thinking yes we know it we're the
[54:48] people we know we have ears here is just
[54:50] seeing it at the end of the day
[54:52] it all went over my head Jesus does that
[54:54] mean I don't have eyes to see in the
[54:56] ears to hear
[54:57] and it would feel like if I don't
[54:59] understand what the preacher is saying
[55:00] if I don't understand what brother
[55:01] Brandon's saying how can I ever make it
[55:04] we the devil will tell us that
[55:06] that's the disciples we're experiencing
[55:08] here but Jesus explained it to them and
[55:12] you know what what's different between
[55:13] these disciples who didn't understand it
[55:15] and the multitudes who didn't understand
[55:18] it the disciples stayed
[55:22] the multitude
[55:23] heard it that what in the world is he
[55:26] saying let's go home
[55:30] the disciples heard us says what in the
[55:32] world is he saying and it just couldn't
[55:35] get out of their ears they couldn't get
[55:37] what does he say what does he mean by
[55:38] this there's something there
[55:42] they might not really see but they see
[55:46] that there's something to see
[55:49] and I just like this this this picture
[55:52] here
[55:54] what do you see here
[55:57] I looked at it as man I see something
[55:59] but it's a kind of a strange picture
[56:03] what do you see here
[56:06] I see trees I see a couple little Huts I
[56:10] see some birds flying over but then
[56:13] somebody's gonna tell you there's more
[56:14] to it than that
[56:16] Gabby sees it
[56:18] do you see
[56:20] an elephant yeah you see there's there's
[56:23] an elephant there when you see there's
[56:24] no there's something more than you look
[56:25] at it you look at oh man
[56:27] they're my oh and you as soon as you
[56:29] know there's something more to be seen
[56:31] to see there do you see it Gideon
[56:34] Gideon doesn't see it yet you got to
[56:36] pray for Gideon he didn't get it yet no
[56:39] he uh yeah got those little pieces of
[56:42] fence between the Huts those are the
[56:43] those are the feet the birds are the
[56:45] back oh good Brandon's gonna explain the
[56:49] the space between the first tree and the
[56:50] and the first time that's that's the
[56:53] trunk but this is like what Jesus is
[56:55] telling the disciples he's telling these
[56:57] Parables say there's something more that
[56:59] we see here there's something more to
[57:01] see and they go they're walking that I
[57:03] just can't see it I just can't see it
[57:04] but they can't get it out of their hands
[57:06] they can't get out of their eyes till
[57:07] they have the actions explain to them
[57:09] other people says this is baloney throw
[57:12] it away and walk away why because
[57:14] there's nothing on the inside
[57:16] blessed are your eyes though for you see
[57:19] and if you don't see it yet Gideon you
[57:21] will okay but that's how it is we might
[57:23] feel like things go over our head that's
[57:26] okay
[57:27] you're still here hang with it it'll be
[57:29] fine because you see that there's
[57:30] something to see and in God's time he'll
[57:33] show it to you and until then yes relax
[57:35] because you can just relax and enjoy the
[57:38] journey it's not like oh I got White
[57:39] Knuckles I can't get I can't make until
[57:42] I can explain what the seventh seal is
[57:46] it's a lost cause I must not be it
[57:49] don't worry it's intriguing God will
[57:52] give it to you in his time and we can
[57:55] just relax
[57:56] and God will deal with each one of us
[57:58] individually and
[58:00] kind of want to close with uh with this
[58:05] we don't want to impersonate somebody
[58:06] else's experience
[58:09] brother Brandon toward the end of his
[58:11] discussion in the smyrnian church he
[58:13] asks what has caused all of this
[58:16] misunderstanding and he says the answer
[58:18] is
[58:19] experience we have gone by experience
[58:22] and not by the word
[58:24] I did that with my with that little
[58:27] brother's prayer meeting I was involved
[58:29] with and for the second prayer meeting I
[58:31] went by experience I said if you want
[58:34] the blessing ask Brother David to open
[58:37] with prayer Brother David opens with
[58:39] prayer it's going to happen I'm going by
[58:42] experience and it's going to be
[58:43] disappointing and confusing the second
[58:45] time it doesn't happen
[58:47] that's how we that's how the confusion
[58:49] happens
[58:50] away with experience as you're measuring
[58:53] line there's only one Plumb line one rod
[58:56] and that's the word
[58:58] watch carefully and get this Peter said
[59:01] repent and be baptized in the name of
[59:03] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[59:05] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[59:07] Holy Ghost
[59:08] Paul said if you receive the Holy Ghost
[59:10] since he believed this is the whole of
[59:12] our problem right here people repent of
[59:15] their sins they get baptized in the
[59:17] water
[59:18] but they don't go on and receive the
[59:20] Holy Ghost you believe unto receiving
[59:22] the spirit
[59:23] Believing on Jesus is the step in the
[59:26] right direction and then they just stop
[59:28] I've got it but Jesus says keep it
[59:30] continueth in my word as my disciple
[59:32] indeed I'm not after an experience of
[59:35] being wet in the water and coming out
[59:36] and everybody applaud and pray with me
[59:38] I'm not seeking the experience I mean
[59:40] after an emotional experience at the
[59:42] altar though I love that I'm pursuing
[59:44] Jesus
[59:46] these things are steps along the way I
[59:47] just keep on walking walking walking I
[59:49] pursue him and nothing else
[59:52] and then I don't have to grasp and hold
[59:54] on to any experience I'm grasping
[59:56] holding on to him
[59:59] when we impersonate somebody else's
[1:00:01] experience and then impersonates a
[1:00:03] strong word sound like we're doing
[1:00:04] something bad we don't mean to
[1:00:07] that when we're trying to get something
[1:00:08] that somebody else has been blessed with
[1:00:10] we think we've got to have that too we
[1:00:13] can be pushing ourselves into something
[1:00:15] that's a sovereign work of God and our
[1:00:18] well-intended efforts can frustrate the
[1:00:20] grace of God
[1:00:21] last year we closed our our school year
[1:00:25] with a pretty interesting Chapel service
[1:00:29] done by Brother Richard grills from down
[1:00:31] in Bluffton and here he had
[1:00:34] he had a bunch of eggs and he had kids
[1:00:37] coming up and he said what do you think
[1:00:39] is going to happen this kid puts this
[1:00:41] egg up against his head what's going to
[1:00:43] happen What will be the result what'll
[1:00:45] be the it'll it is interesting because
[1:00:47] every and it was for this he had to get
[1:00:49] the seniors first the seniors had to
[1:00:50] come up and hit themselves in the head
[1:00:52] and the point was we can say we think
[1:00:55] what we know is going to happen but we
[1:00:57] should always say the Lord will this or
[1:00:59] that could happen with the Lord's will
[1:01:01] we can't be the produced perspective of
[1:01:03] the future because we don't know maybe
[1:01:04] it's a hard-boiled egg
[1:01:06] that's been smuggled there maybe the
[1:01:07] person gets really nervous so nervous
[1:01:10] that they get all sweaty palms and egg
[1:01:12] slips and it just doesn't work out the
[1:01:14] way they thought maybe they just hit
[1:01:16] really hard maybe they don't we don't
[1:01:18] know what's going to happen
[1:01:19] and he was teaching in that way as I
[1:01:22] watched we had like a dozen kids coming
[1:01:24] up there and I have a little video of
[1:01:26] little Marcus here
[1:01:27] um he had he had a blast I just wanna
[1:01:30] um
[1:01:31] there's a little here's Marcus uh I'm
[1:01:33] going to play a short video clip but the
[1:01:35] the visuals it's important here Marcus
[1:01:38] can't wait his hands on that egg
[1:01:41] is it gonna happen
[1:01:43] now what happens when brother Marcus
[1:01:52] with the egg just say that again he
[1:01:55] couldn't wait
[1:01:58] no
[1:02:02] I can't wait to get the egg and he gets
[1:02:04] the egg and man he just goes at it
[1:02:12] [Applause]
[1:02:14] got up there they had a blast doing it
[1:02:16] now one of the four seniors
[1:02:19] um wouldn't do it and there was just
[1:02:22] kind of like
[1:02:23] um not gonna go there um one of the four
[1:02:26] seniors wouldn't do it and they said
[1:02:27] look I'll volunteer Mr cook
[1:02:30] I got volunteered to go up and they sure
[1:02:33] enough they got a kick out of seeing me
[1:02:34] up there I'm looking at what is this
[1:02:35] gonna how am I going to get out of this
[1:02:37] but yeah I I had you had to be a good
[1:02:39] sport and I did it as well oh I
[1:02:43] got to see the real thing here
[1:02:46] there we go
[1:02:49] but you know what people have different
[1:02:51] experiences the first guy was a little
[1:02:53] bit nervous he's kind of
[1:02:55] on his head but you know it cracked and
[1:02:57] got yoke on them he had an experience
[1:02:58] with the egg there was no doubt about it
[1:03:01] but one guy he really got into it and
[1:03:06] this was the experiences just that it
[1:03:09] won the day for sure
[1:03:14] it went all over the place I was afraid
[1:03:18] I was going to clean off my American
[1:03:19] flag I mean he had this thing down he'd
[1:03:23] been he said please follow me calling me
[1:03:25] I want to do this and he is he's having
[1:03:28] a blaster
[1:03:30] but I watched all these kids doing this
[1:03:32] I thought man you know what this is
[1:03:34] everybody wants to have the same egg
[1:03:37] experience
[1:03:38] I woke it up I want to have that
[1:03:40] experience just like that kid had and
[1:03:42] the next kid who followed him wanted to
[1:03:44] do it but it didn't work out that way I
[1:03:46] think he had his finger spread too far
[1:03:48] I'll probably have to egg a certain way
[1:03:49] I had the mechanics down by the end of
[1:03:52] it but you know what only one person had
[1:03:54] this experience where this went
[1:03:57] everywhere carpet everywhere we have
[1:04:00] graduation that next day we had to clean
[1:04:03] everything up because this kid had an
[1:04:05] experience at this point from Dan to
[1:04:07] Beersheba the egg and think I want that
[1:04:09] experience but everybody had their own
[1:04:12] experience with the egg
[1:04:15] I would have loved to bring the eggs
[1:04:16] here but I wasn't brave enough
[1:04:19] but you know when we come to God
[1:04:22] each one of us are going to have our own
[1:04:24] experience with God
[1:04:27] some of us might be calm cool and
[1:04:30] collected we just say I mean it's a big
[1:04:31] step of faith we just want to get the
[1:04:33] egg in their hands we just step up to
[1:04:34] the altar we just
[1:04:36] and the Egg just cracks open a little
[1:04:38] bit but we get God on us
[1:04:40] we get it's a little bitty thing but you
[1:04:42] know what God worked on us we hadn't
[1:04:43] experience with
[1:04:46] the egg we had an experience with God
[1:04:48] but somebody else going to get up there
[1:04:49] he's gonna whack and they'll just go all
[1:04:52] over the church does that mean that
[1:04:54] they're more spiritual it does not
[1:04:56] that's just how God works
[1:04:59] every of us all of us are going to have
[1:05:01] our own experience with God that's how
[1:05:03] God designed it don't copy somebody
[1:05:05] else's experience don't try to get
[1:05:07] somebody else's experience just get that
[1:05:10] egg in your hand and go whack and
[1:05:12] whatever happens rejoice in it you'll
[1:05:14] have the same smile on it Levi had that
[1:05:17] Marcus had it's just great hit a great
[1:05:20] experience that's the kind of experience
[1:05:23] with God we want to have listen whatever
[1:05:24] happens happens and I love God and God
[1:05:27] loves me I'm gonna go forward
[1:05:29] that's what God wants for us
[1:05:33] Galatians 2 20. do I have that here I do
[1:05:38] Paul says I'm crucified with Christ
[1:05:40] nevertheless I live yet that I but
[1:05:43] Christ liveth in me
[1:05:45] and the life I now live in the flesh
[1:05:48] it's not my own life
[1:05:50] I live it by the faith of the Son of God
[1:05:52] it's not even our faith
[1:05:55] it's the faith of the Son of God faith
[1:05:58] is a gift
[1:05:59] who loved me and gave himself for me
[1:06:02] I don't frustrate the grace of God
[1:06:05] I frustrate the grace of God when I try
[1:06:07] to have the same experience the brother
[1:06:09] Jason had when I try to have the same
[1:06:11] experience the brother Michael had and I
[1:06:13] had the same experience that somebody
[1:06:15] else said then I'm frustrating the grace
[1:06:16] of God because if righteousness come by
[1:06:19] the law
[1:06:21] Christ is dead in vain if we think we
[1:06:23] have to do this this or this to purchase
[1:06:26] the goodness of God we'll hear the same
[1:06:28] thing that Peter said to Simon you and
[1:06:31] your money away with you it's a gift
[1:06:34] just enjoy the gift
[1:06:38] on the bottom of page seven on top of
[1:06:40] page eight I've got different things
[1:06:42] that brother Brandon said I'm gonna
[1:06:43] close here were by the time
[1:06:46] but he's talking different people who
[1:06:48] are approaching him in the prayer line
[1:06:49] the first one uh this is and when their
[1:06:51] eyes were open they knew him he says now
[1:06:53] just believe with all your heart don't
[1:06:55] doubt don't doubt just have faith in God
[1:06:58] let's start looking on this side over
[1:07:00] here somewhere somebody somebody just
[1:07:02] look you have to stand around here all
[1:07:04] kinds of belief
[1:07:05] don't don't press at it so you jump over
[1:07:07] the top of it I can imagine somebody
[1:07:09] thinking that but try to believe as hard
[1:07:12] as I can
[1:07:13] he says don't press at it
[1:07:16] you jump over the top of it it's it's
[1:07:18] it's part of you just relax yourself and
[1:07:21] say well sure
[1:07:22] it's the word I believe it
[1:07:26] just relax yourself and that's how God
[1:07:28] comes to you
[1:07:29] and the message greater than solemnness
[1:07:31] here he says your faith is unconscious
[1:07:34] don't press now or jump you jump away
[1:07:37] from it it's right with you just relax
[1:07:40] yourself and believe just believe now
[1:07:43] have faith
[1:07:45] sometimes your faith is unconscious you
[1:07:49] have it and you don't know it
[1:07:52] and there's different places where he he
[1:07:54] calls somebody out
[1:07:56] and he says my am I you there yes you
[1:07:59] with the green shirt on and and and and
[1:08:01] and the tie you've been praying God's
[1:08:03] heard your prayer and he says I'm doing
[1:08:05] this is that shocked you when I called
[1:08:07] you out there and you would think if
[1:08:09] somebody's believing they're expecting
[1:08:12] to be called out but faith is
[1:08:14] unconscious and then when they're called
[1:08:15] out they're actually surprised man
[1:08:17] that's not expecting Faith No it is
[1:08:19] Faith is just an unconscious thing we
[1:08:22] don't always realize how it works or
[1:08:24] when it works
[1:08:25] but lastly the new birth doesn't depend
[1:08:29] upon us
[1:08:31] it's all upon what Christ did at Calvary
[1:08:33] for us and upon the seed of God that
[1:08:36] sown within us without those things it's
[1:08:39] it's impossible and just want to um in
[1:08:42] the on page eight there's a quote from
[1:08:44] the spring and church age
[1:08:46] he says now we're coming to a conclusion
[1:08:48] musicians can come as the Eternal logos
[1:08:51] God was manifest in the son and Jesus to
[1:08:53] win throughout all the fullness of the
[1:08:55] godhead bodily the Eternal Father one
[1:08:57] the Eternal one was the father manifest
[1:08:59] In the Flesh of Jesus
[1:09:01] this goes on is that in that same way
[1:09:04] when the spirit is Manifest in flesh
[1:09:07] when those Eternal thoughts are
[1:09:09] maniflashed in flesh those are the sons
[1:09:11] of God as we're called he says we did
[1:09:13] not come become seed when we were born
[1:09:16] again we were seed and that's why we
[1:09:20] were born again for only the elect can
[1:09:23] be reborn and this comes right from the
[1:09:26] scripture acts 13 48 when the Gentiles
[1:09:29] heard the preaching they were glad and
[1:09:32] glorified the word of the Lord and as
[1:09:34] many as were ordained to eternal life
[1:09:36] believed
[1:09:38] it's not that they were believed that
[1:09:40] they believed and thin were ordained
[1:09:42] because they believed no they were
[1:09:44] ordained and that's the only reason why
[1:09:47] they could believe
[1:09:51] so it's not a White Knuckle experience
[1:09:54] if we're experiencing White Knuckles in
[1:09:56] our walk with God we're listening to the
[1:09:58] devil too much
[1:10:00] the Christian life that God has for us
[1:10:02] is where we can just relax and what God
[1:10:06] has already done for us amen
[1:10:10] let's pray
[1:10:13] Heavenly Father
[1:10:14] I thank you Lord for what you have done
[1:10:17] for us I thank you Lord for how you
[1:10:20] called and and pulled on our hearts
[1:10:22] father
[1:10:23] Lord we could look back in our lives and
[1:10:25] how things could have been different in
[1:10:28] so many ways at different times but yet
[1:10:30] you were the one who kept us all the
[1:10:33] time and we're thankful for that oh God
[1:10:36] and Lord I just pray that if if as we've
[1:10:39] listened this evening and that we've
[1:10:40] seen sometimes we have we we recognize
[1:10:44] I've been seeking God by my own works
[1:10:48] and not by Faith Lord forgive us for
[1:10:50] that we don't want to frustrate the
[1:10:52] grace of God Lord help us each one of us
[1:10:54] to relax
[1:10:57] to open up and so we can just see what
[1:10:59] you've done us and we just continue
[1:11:01] walking
[1:11:02] I don't care Lord when it happens what
[1:11:05] happens but that happens I'm just going
[1:11:07] to keep on walking I'm not be seeking
[1:11:10] anything else but you I'm you are the
[1:11:13] one I want Lord to boil you down to a
[1:11:15] certain experience or through emotional
[1:11:17] Revelation or or a certain set of
[1:11:20] perfection that's so that's so so so so
[1:11:23] cheap I just I want you Lord
[1:11:26] Lord I pray that you'd help us to run
[1:11:28] that race that you would energize us
[1:11:30] each step of the way oh God I pray that
[1:11:32] you would encourage each one in their
[1:11:34] walk lord lord lord I pray you give them
[1:11:36] peace and rest and Assurance oh God in
[1:11:39] Jesus Christ's name
