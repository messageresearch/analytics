[35:26] at 5:00 p. p.m. over at Crossroads
[35:28] Church. We'll be using that church on
[35:29] Saturday. We'll be back here on Sunday
[35:31] morning. And we have a lot of visitors
[35:33] from many different states and some
[35:35] countries coming in for that live
[35:37] recording and that night of worship. If
[35:39] you wanted to join us, we'd love to have
[35:40] you just worshiping the Lord together.
[35:42] We appreciate that. We appreciate sister
[35:44] Jerusa singing this morning. We missed
[35:46] the blessing of having her sing more
[35:48] because her and brother Blessing are um
[35:50] transferred. It's still happening. I've
[35:52] been trying to stop it, but it's going
[35:54] to happen. They have to move. We have
[35:56] enjoyed. What a great name for brother
[35:58] blessing because they and him and his
[36:00] wife has been a blessing to us and uh we
[36:03] hope someday we can fellowship together
[36:05] again and you guys can be back. May God
[36:07] bless you as they go to Florida and he
[36:09] finishes his doctor degree there. We
[36:11] send you with our blessings. God bless
[36:13] you guys and we appreciate you being in
[36:15] the congregation in that special this
[36:16] morning as well. 2 Kings chapter 5 and
[36:20] verse 9. We can read together. So non
[36:23] came with his horses and with his
[36:25] chariot and stood at the door of the
[36:27] house of Elijah Elisha. And Elisha sent
[36:30] a messenger unto him, saying, Go and
[36:32] wash in Jordan seven times, and thy
[36:35] flesh shall come again to thee, and thou
[36:37] shalt be clean. But non was wroth and
[36:40] went away, and said, Behold, I thought,
[36:44] &gt;&gt; you know, my dad used to say, that's
[36:45] where we get in trouble.
[36:48] Behold, I thought he would surely come
[36:50] out to me and stand and call on the name
[36:53] of the Lord his God and strike his hand
[36:55] over the place and recover the leper.
[36:58] Are not Abna and far uh Farpa uh rivers
[37:02] of Damascus better than all the waters
[37:04] of Israel? May I may I not wash in them
[37:08] and be clean? So he turned and went away
[37:10] in a rage. and his servants came near
[37:13] and spake unto him, and said, "My
[37:15] father, if the prophet had bid thee to
[37:18] do some great thing, wouldest thou not
[37:20] have done it? How much rather than when
[37:23] he saith, wash and be clean?"
[37:26] I mean, the scripture in Isaiah, I think
[37:28] it is, he says, "Don't despise the day
[37:31] of small things."
[37:33] We're living in that day where God can
[37:36] get glory and bring deliverance through
[37:38] small things and small obedience to the
[37:41] Lord. Then went he down and dipped
[37:44] himself seven times in Jordan according
[37:46] to the saying of the man of God. And his
[37:48] flesh came again like unto the flesh of
[37:51] a little child, and he was clean. May
[37:55] the Lord add his blessings to the word
[37:56] this morning. God bless you. You may be
[37:58] seated.
[38:05] Once God sends
[38:08] a prophet
[38:10] and the prophet speaks that word,
[38:14] after that prophet is even gone, the
[38:18] word remains.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; And I would say it this way that once he
[38:23] speaks it to his prophet and his prophet
[38:25] goes on, it is out of the picture. What
[38:27] he said remains and it's there. If I can
[38:30] say it this way, it's in the land. God
[38:32] spoke spoke it and all of the purpose
[38:36] God gave with that word. It holds its
[38:39] purpose still. It holds purpose behind
[38:42] it. It holds power behind it. It will
[38:45] never return void to God. That's what
[38:47] the Bible says. God says, "My word will
[38:50] never return void." And we know he uses
[38:53] prophets to bring his word. But when he
[38:55] brings it and even after the prophet's
[38:57] gone, if that word has been spoken and
[39:00] it's in the land, it has the purpose in
[39:03] it. It has power in it. It'll go forth
[39:05] and reach into the whole earth. Can you
[39:07] say amen? And it will accomplish what
[39:10] God sends for it to do. There's nothing,
[39:12] and I say this, there's nothing Satan
[39:14] can do to stop that word
[39:17] &gt;&gt; once it's in motion. And when I say in
[39:19] motion, once it's been spoken and it's
[39:21] in the land and it goes out, there's
[39:23] nothing Satan can do to stop it, it's
[39:26] going to accomplish what God sent it to
[39:28] do. And so that should give us a great
[39:30] strength this morning. There's nothing
[39:32] Satan can ever do to stop it from
[39:34] reaching every seed and challenging the
[39:37] very worst of sin and habits in the
[39:40] people. Once that word has been spoken,
[39:43] it's going to go forth into every parts
[39:45] of the land. And it's going to reach his
[39:47] elected seed. It's going to call them.
[39:50] And then when that elected seed is bound
[39:52] by habits and sin and fear and whatever
[39:55] it is, that word is going to call the
[39:58] seed. And it's going to deliver them
[40:00] from any habits of this age, any
[40:03] leprosy, any sin. That word, the prophet
[40:06] doesn't have to be here, but the word is
[40:08] in the land. And the word will not
[40:11] return void. The word will still have
[40:13] the power in it. The word will still
[40:16] have a purpose in it. I'll tell you,
[40:18] you're not under a denominational word.
[40:20] You're living by a word that has power
[40:22] and has purpose in it. And it will
[40:24] accomplish in your life. Everything that
[40:27] you're missing, this word is going to
[40:28] provide.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; I'm glad you're not depending on Paula
[40:32] Fontaine. Can you say amen? And you're
[40:34] glad. You should be glad of that, too.
[40:36] Or any preacher for that matter. It's
[40:39] the word that the preacher preaches. Can
[40:41] you say amen?
[40:43] &gt;&gt; When I walk out every Sunday morning and
[40:45] walk into this, I say, "Well, thank God
[40:47] there's people here today." It's it's a,
[40:50] you know, it's nice because you see
[40:52] people hungry for the word of God. Can
[40:54] you say, "Amen." It would be bad if I
[40:56] walked out and nobody was here. It's
[40:58] hard to preach when nobody's there, but
[41:00] when people are there, then they know
[41:01] there's got to be something in this word
[41:04] for me. Can you say amen? And it's
[41:06] because when it's spoken by a prophet,
[41:08] it has the power within it to go forth
[41:11] and accomplish and in this case take us
[41:13] into a rapture. How many want to go in a
[41:15] rapture? This is a rapturing faith word
[41:18] that we're under.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; You'll never stop it. And when anybody
[41:23] who aligns themsself against a prophet's
[41:26] word,
[41:28] when anybody aligns himself against
[41:30] this, you're not aligning yourself
[41:31] against a prophet or the people who
[41:34] follow it. When you align yourself
[41:36] against the word of a prophet, that
[41:38] means trouble for you.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; Great trouble in your life. You've
[41:43] aligned yourself against the wrong
[41:44] thing. You can align yourself against
[41:46] the president, against country, against
[41:48] politics, your local government, but let
[41:50] me tell you something. When you align
[41:51] yourself against not a prophet, but
[41:53] against the prophet's word that's in the
[41:55] land, you've aligned yourself against
[41:57] the wrong thing. I'm amazed at this
[41:59] story of non so inspired on Wednesday
[42:01] night as our brother broke a few things
[42:02] to us. Brother Gideon from Nigeria. And
[42:05] I was so amazed I couldn't get over
[42:06] this. And although I want to go into
[42:08] some other things, I I just wanted to go
[42:10] back to this story after Wednesday
[42:12] night. And to to realize that Elisha was
[42:16] only actually carrying on the ministry
[42:18] of Elijah. That's interesting to us
[42:20] because we've had that spirit of Elijah
[42:22] return to this land according to
[42:24] scripture. If you're listening in, uh
[42:26] you'll be able to know from scripture
[42:28] that Elijah is used five times in the
[42:31] Bible. God so trusted that spirit to
[42:33] send that to speak to his people. And
[42:35] we're in the I believe the fourth time
[42:37] that God used it in our generation. He
[42:39] said, "I I'll send you Elijah the
[42:41] prophet before the great and dreadful
[42:42] day of the Lord." And he'll send that.
[42:44] It's God sending his servant. And then
[42:46] uh then he said, John the Baptist had
[42:48] the spirit of Elias Elias on him,
[42:50] Elijah. And so that he sends it again.
[42:52] He's going to send it one more time to
[42:54] the Jews according to the book of
[42:55] Revelations. But you see now in this
[42:58] incident when the first time Elijah come
[43:00] we realize that Elijah was uh was gone
[43:03] already and Elisha was there now and he
[43:06] had only received he received a double
[43:08] portion of Elijah's spirit. So we
[43:11] realize Elijah is not even there but the
[43:13] word of Elijah is still carrying on. The
[43:16] word of Elijah is still in the land. It
[43:18] was years later that he pronounced
[43:20] judgment over Jezebel. But it was after
[43:22] Elijah was gone that that judgment came
[43:24] to pass. because everything that he
[43:27] said, if it come from God, it's going to
[43:30] come to pass even when Elijah's gone.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; Is anybody with me this morning?
[43:35] &gt;&gt; So Elisha has a double portion of this.
[43:38] And Elisha is a type of the bride. He's
[43:41] not he's he's carrying on what Elijah
[43:43] had. And and Elisha and you even had
[43:46] that sh in there, that she it's the
[43:49] feminine part. He's the type of the
[43:51] bride. I love to read Elisha because
[43:52] that's the days we live in. and and and
[43:54] the incident with non is something that
[43:56] happened that's a type of our our time.
[43:59] So the bride is a prophetic people just
[44:02] like Elisha was carrying on the prophecy
[44:05] of Elijah.
[44:07] The bride listen now is a prophetic
[44:10] people because she is speaking and
[44:12] holding to the same word under Elijah.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; We're not just Christians but we're a
[44:20] people. We're a prophetic people. We're
[44:23] under a prophecy. Can you say amen?
[44:24] We're under a word that's God has put in
[44:27] the land and not just in the land. Then
[44:29] he puts it in our hearts.
[44:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; This is not just church. This is not
[44:35] just another gathering of Christians.
[44:37] No, we are a prophetic people carrying
[44:40] out God's word for this age.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; And uh it it it's an amazing word. It's
[44:45] a powerful word. And it's nothing in
[44:47] ourselves. But she she is a prophetic
[44:49] people because she's speaking and
[44:50] holding to the same word of Elijah.
[44:52] Elijah's word is in the land. It's in
[44:54] his people. His servants are carriers of
[44:57] that word. They don't have the power,
[45:00] but they have the authority with that
[45:02] word to use the power of God. Like a
[45:05] policeman, he doesn't have any power
[45:07] within himself, but he has authority.
[45:09] And he has all the city backing him up.
[45:12] Every believer here this morning has all
[45:14] of heaven backing you up.
[45:16] You don't have a power but you have
[45:18] authority to use the power of God. You
[45:21] don't want a power within yourself. You
[45:23] can do nothing but you have access to
[45:25] the power of God which is in the word of
[45:28] God.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So then the the that word
[45:34] reaches all the way now now just catch
[45:37] this that word reaches all the way out
[45:40] to the even to the headquarters of the
[45:43] Syrian army to a man named non who was a
[45:46] captain in the Syrian army. So watch how
[45:48] far that word goes now. It reaches all
[45:51] the way to the headquarters of the enemy
[45:53] army Syrian army uh the ones that
[45:56] fighting against Israel.
[45:58] The word reaches in there by a little
[46:01] maid girl that's she's away. She's in
[46:04] captivity. But the word of the prophet
[46:07] reaches through a little maid girl. And
[46:10] she sees an incident and there's no cure
[46:13] for it. There's no cure for leprosy. But
[46:16] she knows there's a prophetic word.
[46:18] There's a prophet. There is a source
[46:21] that's in the land for deliverance for
[46:24] something that's completely incurable.
[46:29] How many know how many incurable
[46:31] diseases we got today? And we're trying
[46:33] to get sights. We're trying to tackle
[46:35] all of them. But listen now. When
[46:37] there's no cure for a habit or a sin or
[46:40] a demon, there is a cure within the land
[46:43] and we are witnesses to that.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; We are carriers of that word.
[46:50] this little girl, she starts to hear
[46:52] this and I'm getting ahead of myself,
[46:54] but she just says, "Listen, there's a
[46:56] word in the land.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; If you can get to that word, leprosy is
[47:00] not leprosy is not a problem."
[47:03] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. I feel like shouting
[47:05] this morning.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; Do you know that beyond what you think
[47:08] of yourself, the word that he's put in
[47:10] this land and put in your heart is more
[47:12] powerful than any demon that can come
[47:14] against your life. It's more powerful
[47:16] than any anxiety. It's more powerful
[47:18] than any trial in your life. It's not
[47:21] you, it's the word he's placed within
[47:23] you.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That word reached all the
[47:28] way to the headquarters of a army that
[47:29] was fighting against Israel and a little
[47:31] maid girl working in non's home in
[47:34] captivity. Away from all the comfort of
[47:36] her own people and her own church, away
[47:39] from all the comforts. We got it pretty
[47:41] nice today. We got believers that we can
[47:43] fellowship with. We got to cover our
[47:45] children have a pretty safe place to be.
[47:47] But this girl was taken away from her
[47:49] parents, away from her church just like
[47:51] Daniel was and his friends Shadrach,
[47:53] Meshach, and Abedneo. They were taken
[47:55] into Babylon, away from Jerusalem, away
[47:57] from the comfort of being able to go to
[47:59] church every week. And we don't know how
[48:01] much pressures will come against. But
[48:03] when that word, when you're carrying
[48:05] that word, you can be in the worst of
[48:07] Babylon. You can be in the worst of
[48:09] atmospheres. Can I get an amen this one?
[48:12] You can be in in your employment or your
[48:14] school in the worst of atmospheres and
[48:17] you're carrying something within you.
[48:19] That's the word of the Lord.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; Let me just say this. Don't ever
[48:27] underestimate that word and where it
[48:30] will reach and the witness of it. Right.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; I tell you, if the last days message of
[48:36] Christ that we preach is man-made, it
[48:40] should have never reached as far as it
[48:42] has today.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; I preach the message of Christ for the
[48:48] last days, and if it was man-made, it
[48:50] would have never reached as far as it's
[48:53] reached.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; True. because it's God's word
[48:57] &gt;&gt; where it's it's going gone into country
[48:59] countries that to me and I could
[49:01] elaborate on this but to me I it it went
[49:05] against all communism in countries. It's
[49:08] getting into places that it's never
[49:10] going to get in there. It's never going
[49:12] to be accepted there. But somehow it's
[49:14] getting in cuz God's looking for his
[49:15] elected seed.
[49:18] Don't ever estimate where the word will
[49:20] reach and the witness of it. If this
[49:22] last days messes of Christ is man-made,
[49:24] it would have never reached as far as
[49:25] this. God had a little cleaning girl way
[49:29] away from her people, but she got a
[49:31] source that she can tell pe people
[49:33] about. And as she heard conversations in
[49:35] the home like, and I'm just elaborating,
[49:38] how in the world did our great captain
[49:40] non get leprosy? Our master, he's
[49:44] honorable. He's mighty. He's a mighty
[49:46] warrior. How in the world did he get lep
[49:50] leprosy? It's not fair. We learned
[49:52] something this morning. We learned that
[49:54] leprosy, which is a type of sin, can
[49:56] affect anyone.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; It's a captain in the Syrian army. And
[50:02] the Bible says in chapter 5 and verse
[50:04] one, a man with his master in honorable
[50:07] because by him the Lord had given
[50:08] deliverance unto Syria. He was also a
[50:10] mighty man in valor, but he was a leper.
[50:12] And so this teaches us something. sin,
[50:15] leprosy can get to anybody. I don't care
[50:18] how much money you have.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Can I get an amen?
[50:22] &gt;&gt; He He was It can Your position in the
[50:25] world doesn't matter. Your money doesn't
[50:27] matter. Your status does not make you I
[50:29] hope you're listening online this
[50:30] morning as well and on the broadcast.
[50:33] Sin can reach if you've got all the
[50:35] money in the world. If you got all the
[50:37] position in the world, if you're the
[50:39] president, whatever position, your
[50:41] status does not make you immune from the
[50:44] disease of sin.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; And let me just say this,
[50:50] &gt;&gt; the disease of sin, except by the blood
[50:53] and the token, we're not immune from it
[50:55] either.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm in the message. I've been in
[50:58] the message for 40 years. Those things
[51:01] don't bother me. You live in the flesh,
[51:03] my brother. Twothirds of you is not born
[51:05] again. And if you give yourself to the
[51:08] wrong thing, you'll take on the disease
[51:10] of sin. It may not get to your soul, but
[51:12] it'll start to work in your life. You
[51:14] feed on the wrong things and you're
[51:16] going to start taking the disease of sin
[51:18] in your life. You're going to It doesn't
[51:20] matter because sin will go to any it'll
[51:22] take you further than you want to go. It
[51:24] touched a a mighty warrior here that
[51:27] would have never expected. And that's
[51:28] why we need to realize we start saying,
[51:30] "Well, this is unfair. That person lives
[51:32] such a good life. Why were they struck
[51:34] with this disease? Anybody ever said
[51:37] that?
[51:38] &gt;&gt; It just seems so unfair that they would
[51:41] get this particular let somebody else
[51:43] get it. That's a bad person.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; No, Satan don't work that way.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; Satan doesn't work that way. He goes for
[51:53] the juggler. He goes for anybody and
[51:55] especially believers.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; If he would want to strike somebody with
[52:00] cancer, he's going to strike a believer.
[52:04] But he doesn't know when he strikes a
[52:06] believer, he's in big trouble.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; When he strikes a believer, he's dealing
[52:13] with something different because he he
[52:16] didn't he's not going to know what hit
[52:17] him. Can you say amen? He's not going to
[52:19] know what hit him because he struck the
[52:22] wrong thing,
[52:24] &gt;&gt; the wrong person. Because if they're
[52:26] carrying that word, if God decides to
[52:28] take them, that's still up to God.
[52:29] That's still a victory in God. But
[52:31] listen now, he tries to get this to
[52:33] believers and all these diseases,
[52:36] especially the disease s, you know, the
[52:37] disease of sin is worse than cancer.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; And and we get nervous about that and
[52:43] and and and sometimes we're human, we do
[52:45] that. But let me tell you what you feed
[52:47] on in worldly things. And the disease
[52:49] you can get from that is worse than the
[52:51] disease of cancer.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; The disease of the mind and the disease
[52:56] of uh things that come to your spirit,
[52:58] emotions, and mind, it's worse. Amen.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; So
[53:08] we learn that leprosy, sin can affect
[53:10] anyone. Your position in the world, all
[53:11] these other things doesn't matter. But
[53:13] also we learn that this word will reach
[53:16] anyone. So the the the disease of sin,
[53:18] leprosy struck somebody that we wouldn't
[53:20] expect. But you see now we also the
[53:22] positive thing is the word that will
[53:24] deliver them will reach anyone as well.
[53:27] This little young person must have had
[53:29] the belief that the healing is in the
[53:31] word and it was for everyone. Otherwise,
[53:33] she wouldn't have been testifying in the
[53:35] house. She believed it was for everyone.
[53:38] She believed this word. If they'll
[53:39] respond to it and go to it, it's for
[53:41] everyone. Listen, we don't have a right
[53:44] to be exclusive with this message. Can
[53:46] you say amen?
[53:47] &gt;&gt; It's for everyone who will believe.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; I know there's predestinated seed. I
[53:52] know there's categories, but we don't
[53:54] worry about this category. That little
[53:56] girl said she if she would have been
[53:58] selective, if she would have been said,
[54:00] "Well, these guys aren't even believers
[54:01] and they're the enemy." If she'd have
[54:03] had that attitude, he wouldn't have got
[54:05] his deliverance. Before she even said
[54:08] something, she had to have the attitude,
[54:11] "This word is for everybody."
[54:17] &gt;&gt; If she'd have looked at that man and
[54:19] said, "This is a cusser. He's cussing
[54:21] all the time around. I can't even stand
[54:22] the atmosphere. He's drinking. He's got
[54:25] all kinds of this stuff around his body.
[54:26] He's, you know, if we judge people by
[54:29] how they look on the outside, then we'll
[54:31] start thinking this word must have been
[54:33] for me
[54:35] &gt;&gt; and not them.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; She didn't do that. She didn't have that
[54:40] attitude.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; Anybody listening this morning? I'm
[54:44] trying to correct a lot of message pride
[54:46] that says we're better than everybody
[54:47] else and we got an exclusion on this
[54:50] word. it's ours and we're going into
[54:52] rapture and the rest of us can and
[54:54] fodder. That's that's terms that a
[54:56] prophet can use. But you be careful how
[54:58] you use those because you might rule
[55:00] somebody out.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; She's here. She's hearing them talk and
[55:07] say, "Why does this have to come to him
[55:10] for days? This is not fair. He's got
[55:13] this leprosy all over his skin. He could
[55:16] die of it." And even though there was no
[55:19] cure,
[55:21] the word of a prophet, she she pipes up
[55:23] and says, "I know a man. If you can get
[55:26] to him, if you can get there, you can be
[55:29] delivered of this leprosy."
[55:32] &gt;&gt; A minister spoke one time on deception.
[55:36] And we know the bride of Christ, his
[55:39] wife, can't be deceived.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Right. The bride can't be deceived. But
[55:47] but the bride and all people can be
[55:50] affected with the disease sometimes
[55:53] temporarily. Even though they're not
[55:55] completely deceived, you can come under
[55:58] a deception temporarily.
[56:00] You have to realize we're not above
[56:02] temptation. How many can say amen to
[56:03] that? We're not above temptation. Not
[56:06] above being affected by spiritual
[56:08] diseases. We're not above that. Um we we
[56:11] we can never as a believer, it can never
[56:14] lead us to death. spiritual uh uh the
[56:16] the death angel if we have the token
[56:19] cannot fully strike the home that way
[56:22] but but it can try to infect the home.
[56:24] It can try to affect a believer. It can
[56:26] never lead to death or denying Christ
[56:29] but it sure can afflict us sometime.
[56:31] It's like a snake bite. It's like some
[56:34] people get a snake bite and they get
[56:35] poisoned. Some people die of it, but
[56:38] some people get healed. Some people are
[56:40] poisoned for a time once they have that
[56:42] poison in their system. That's a type of
[56:44] us. We may not die of a spiritual
[56:47] disease, but we can be temporarily
[56:49] poisoned.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; We can be temporarily tempted and
[56:55] sometimes on the surface deceived by
[56:57] something and God in his grace wakes us
[56:59] up and God purges us and God heals us.
[57:02] It's like some people listen too much to
[57:03] the internet and they leave the message
[57:05] because they've been poisoned. I pray
[57:07] for those people because hopefully
[57:09] hopefully they just been bit. They
[57:11] listen to the the hiss of the serpent
[57:14] just like Eve did. Can I get an amen
[57:16] this morning? You're on that stuff.
[57:18] You're listening to the hiss of the
[57:19] serpent. Well, a snake, if you stay
[57:21] close to it, it'll bite you. I hate
[57:23] snakes. I stay away from snakes. And the
[57:25] two things with snakes, if you're a
[57:28] little boy, you want to play with
[57:29] snakes, you you shouldn't do that
[57:31] because the pleasure will be short
[57:35] &gt;&gt; and the pain will be great. Right.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; It's good advice.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; I learned that when I was a little boy,
[57:44] &gt;&gt; go ahead and play with them.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; But the the the pleasure will be short
[57:48] and the pain will be great.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; And these people listen to all this
[57:52] stuff on the internet and it poisons
[57:54] you. I've watched people poison, but
[57:55] I've watched God heal them of that
[57:57] poison. And they come back to say
[57:58] there's no other. I've watched them go
[58:00] to theological colleges and schools and
[58:03] spend 20 years of their life trying to
[58:05] dispel this thing and they come right
[58:06] back and saying there's not never been a
[58:08] supernatural God express himself than
[58:11] through this ministry and this last days
[58:13] what he's doing in the bride. This is
[58:15] where God is is trying to work through
[58:17] his people.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So let me get done with
[58:22] I just want to add this in. You can be
[58:24] bit by a snake. Some die, some don't. So
[58:26] we need to pray for the people that are
[58:28] poisoned by the by by the wrong spirit
[58:31] that they don't die of it spiritually
[58:34] &gt;&gt; that they're healed.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; Leprosy is an infectious disease. How
[58:39] many knew that leprosy is an infectious
[58:41] disease and it's on the skin by the way
[58:43] which we might point out that leprosy is
[58:45] a type of sin. Brother Bram says and
[58:47] leprosy is is a skin disease. It gets on
[58:50] the sink. Brother Gideon said Wednesday
[58:51] night, he said it actually comes from a
[58:53] bacteria and that bacteria can come from
[58:56] the food that you're eating. Believe it
[58:57] or not, it came through the food back in
[58:59] that day. Bacteria can come through
[59:01] food. So he preaching up a storm
[59:03] Wednesday night. Listen to that service
[59:05] was really great. He's we got to feed on
[59:08] the right things. We're taking the book.
[59:09] We're feeding on the book. This open
[59:11] book of redemption. Can you say amen?
[59:13] But you're on your social media and all
[59:15] those things for 24/7. I'm rarely on my
[59:18] phone and I still get a time slot at the
[59:20] end of the week. You've been on your
[59:22] phone 3 hours every day this week and
[59:24] I'm going, "No, not me. How? Who in the
[59:26] world?" The three hours. No, but I know
[59:28] if I'm 3 hours and don't think that I'm
[59:30] on it, uh, I think some of you need to
[59:33] take a look at your time on the phone.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; I know I won't get a lot of shouts and
[59:39] glory and amens out of that.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; But I'm going to tell you straight, you
[59:43] better be have your Holy Ghost armor on.
[59:46] Can you say in mind? You better be
[59:48] holding because this stuff brings in sin
[59:52] subtly
[59:53] &gt;&gt; on the surface. But you see, see now
[59:56] it's on the surface. Not inside you yet,
[59:59] but it can move on the inside and it
[1:00:01] leprosy can kill. That was what their
[1:00:02] worry and fear was. The surface the
[1:00:05] surface things of sin has the potential
[1:00:08] to kill you. And we think it's okay on
[1:00:10] the surface. We think a lot of things
[1:00:12] are okay on the surface. Leprosy came on
[1:00:15] the surface first
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; and when you get something they had no
[1:00:22] cure for this but when we get infectious
[1:00:24] diseases and different things I remember
[1:00:26] my wife got sick of salmonella she got
[1:00:28] really sick from a restaurant we went to
[1:00:30] MRI was just born she was a she was a
[1:00:33] preeie and so my wife in those first two
[1:00:36] weeks which I got my father-in-law and
[1:00:38] mother-in-law here uh today uh brother
[1:00:41] Emanuel sister Carol I forgot to
[1:00:43] announce them there a great honor to
[1:00:45] have them in the service today. Let's
[1:00:46] give them a hand. Amen.
[1:00:50] God bless you guys. It'd be a joy to be
[1:00:53] with him this week. A joy to have in the
[1:00:54] service. They don't travel too much
[1:00:56] anymore. So, we're glad to have him. And
[1:00:58] my father-in-law is not so bad. Even
[1:01:00] though he keeps me in my place, you
[1:01:02] know, when I married Becca and they
[1:01:04] said, "You're a Lefontaine. That don't
[1:01:06] matter to me. You put your pants on the
[1:01:08] same as everybody else."
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; So, he keeps me in line. He keeps me
[1:01:12] humble.
[1:01:14] I like my mother-in-law a little better
[1:01:16] than my father-in-law, actually.
[1:01:19] She cooks some good biscuits.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; I can't use any of the mother-in-law
[1:01:25] jokes on my mother-in-law. She's a
[1:01:27] wonderful woman and she wanted me as a
[1:01:29] son-in-law. She didn't care who which
[1:01:30] daughter that I married of her family.
[1:01:32] She wanted me as a son-in-law.
[1:01:35] So, we've had a really good relationship
[1:01:37] for 32 years.
[1:01:40] How How did I get into this? Why am I
[1:01:42] talking about my mother-in-law? Oh, she
[1:01:44] was here when my wife gets sick. So,
[1:01:47] she's in the hospital in Flower
[1:01:48] Hospital. She's up on the third or
[1:01:50] fourth floor there and they're saying
[1:01:52] that she's and she's fading out. I can
[1:01:54] tell that this may end up in a death.
[1:01:56] And I I'm I'm desperate. I'm just a
[1:01:58] young father and young husband. And so,
[1:02:01] it's a it's a disease. So, it's just
[1:02:02] something that's come in her system, in
[1:02:04] her blood. And uh she's going on going
[1:02:06] on. And the regular doctors, you know,
[1:02:08] they're just saying this is not looking
[1:02:09] good. Then my daughter Rya gets it and
[1:02:12] she's down and uh uh Mama Wade has to
[1:02:16] come in and take care of her while my
[1:02:18] wife is in the hospital. And then my my
[1:02:20] daughter gets it and she's down in
[1:02:22] emergency at Flower Hospital. A lot of
[1:02:23] you know Flower Hospital. She's down
[1:02:25] emergency just on the verge of dying. My
[1:02:27] daughter my wife's on the verge of dying
[1:02:28] upstairs. And uh my mother-in-law's down
[1:02:31] there. You remember this, Sister Carol?
[1:02:32] And she's down there and she's I had to
[1:02:34] go upstairs and see my wife. I stopped
[1:02:36] by in the bathroom. I'm just weeping and
[1:02:38] asking God. I said, "If I have to go
[1:02:40] through what brother Brandon went
[1:02:41] through, then you'll give me grace, but
[1:02:43] oh God, would you have mercy on my
[1:02:45] family at this moment?" And uh so she's
[1:02:48] down there when I was away and she sees
[1:02:50] Rya uh just kind of tighten up and the
[1:02:53] the line on the meter, what's it called?
[1:02:56] The
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; heart. It goes straight. It goes Is that
[1:03:00] when they're going?
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, and it just goes and she sees
[1:03:05] it and Rya stops breathing and mammo
[1:03:10] goes, "Satan, I rebuke you in the name
[1:03:11] of the Lord Jesus Christ." And Rya just
[1:03:14] takes a breath like that and she's she's
[1:03:17] here in the service this morning. God
[1:03:19] spared my daughter.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; And God spared my wife as well.
[1:03:25] Amen.
[1:03:27] These are people of faith here,
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; Brother Emanuel, Sister Carol. They
[1:03:31] believe that God is still God. And uh
[1:03:33] but I just wanted to say that they had
[1:03:35] to bring in she was about ready to go
[1:03:37] and I I know I give the glory to God,
[1:03:38] but they brought in an infectious
[1:03:40] disease specialist. And after a week,
[1:03:43] they thought we better bring in a
[1:03:44] specialist. And I'm going, why didn't
[1:03:46] you bring him in the first day, you
[1:03:48] know, but when he when they she came in
[1:03:51] a specialist in this? And I was only
[1:03:53] saying it to realize that we've got
[1:03:55] diseases and we've got things today. It
[1:03:58] don't just take a general doctor. It
[1:04:00] takes a specialist. And I want to tell
[1:04:01] you, our Lord Jesus is a specialist in
[1:04:04] every disease of sin. My doctor is a
[1:04:08] specialist in every disease of leprosy
[1:04:10] and sin.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; And he come in there. She come in there
[1:04:13] and she said, "Oh yeah, I know what this
[1:04:15] is." And and within a few days, she was
[1:04:16] out of the hospital. I give God glory.
[1:04:18] But it took a specialist. I'll tell you,
[1:04:20] in this age, it takes a specialist for
[1:04:22] the problems. It takes a specialist for
[1:04:24] the diseases.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; They're too subtle. Can you say amen? us
[1:04:28] preachers, if we don't yield to the
[1:04:30] Lord, we don't preach the things. If we
[1:04:32] don't get in the mind of the Lord, then
[1:04:33] we can't address the things Satan is
[1:04:36] bringing subtly into people's lives and
[1:04:38] young people's lives.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; So, we pray, God, you're the specialist.
[1:04:43] Bring a word that delivers your people
[1:04:45] cuz this is too subtle of disease.
[1:04:47] Sometimes it's on a surface and people
[1:04:49] are begin to get that surface of leprosy
[1:04:52] sin. They don't even realize it, but
[1:04:54] it's got to be exposed. It's got to be
[1:04:55] dealt with by a specialist. Can you say
[1:04:57] amen?
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; I want to say thank you to the young
[1:05:00] people for a couple of days of wonderful
[1:05:01] refreshment and fellowship and and joy.
[1:05:04] It was such a restful time the last
[1:05:06] couple days with them. I enjoy all of
[1:05:08] them. We have shared in the word. And
[1:05:10] I'll just tell you, I don't say this to
[1:05:11] boast, but I just give glory to God. On
[1:05:13] Thursday night when we shared in the
[1:05:15] word from our hearts, the Holy Spirit
[1:05:17] come down in that living room and we
[1:05:19] prayed together. And I'm telling you, he
[1:05:21] was present. He was on the scene. Just
[1:05:23] 20 of us there. But all the young
[1:05:25] people, how many raise your hand and
[1:05:26] testify our Lord was present in that
[1:05:28] room.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; I thank God for that because in this age
[1:05:31] and this time of 2025, we need more than
[1:05:35] just head knowledge. We need more than
[1:05:37] just somebody said just believe or
[1:05:38] prophet. No, we need the reality and the
[1:05:40] power of that word.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; And we need an infectious disease
[1:05:45] specialist.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Maybe you need it this morning.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:53] There are some diseases so subtle and
[1:05:55] creep in so slow that it takes a a
[1:05:57] specialist, not just a regular doctor.
[1:05:59] The way sin creeps in our life today, it
[1:06:01] takes the word. A word that's got a word
[1:06:04] that's got the devil's number and knows
[1:06:05] what he's talking about. Just as God
[1:06:07] makes a way of escape from temptation.
[1:06:10] How many believe God will make a way of
[1:06:11] escape from temptation? Yes, the Bible
[1:06:14] says that. But you see now, he also
[1:06:17] makes a way and a remedy for every part
[1:06:19] of sin. the nature of sin and the
[1:06:22] influence of sin. It's not just having
[1:06:24] the nature of sin that you're born with.
[1:06:26] Calvary, the blood takes care of the
[1:06:28] very nature of sin. That's why you need
[1:06:30] a new birth because you were born with
[1:06:33] the nature of sin. That's why you like
[1:06:34] to sin. That's why you like to you're
[1:06:37] attracted to the things of the world.
[1:06:38] That's the nature of sin. Calvary kills
[1:06:41] the nature and desire of sin.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; But also, there's an influence of sin.
[1:06:47] And the blood also has power. The word
[1:06:51] has power against the influence of sin.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, you know, being
[1:07:00] under the feast of atonement spiritually
[1:07:03] is where we're at at now. If you know
[1:07:05] your Bible and know as these feasts have
[1:07:07] been restored, starting with Jesus
[1:07:09] Christ, the the the uh the feast of the
[1:07:11] Old Testament that they worshiped under,
[1:07:13] Christ fulfilled every one of them. the
[1:07:15] feast of Passover, uh the feast of
[1:07:18] Pentecost. As time has went on in 2,000
[1:07:20] years, we see those the spiritual
[1:07:22] fulfillment of the feast fulfilled in
[1:07:24] the bride. Christ doing it, but many of
[1:07:26] them through the bride. Now, we're in
[1:07:28] the day of the feast of atonement being
[1:07:30] restored. And I I just wanted to touch
[1:07:32] on this to say the feast of atonement
[1:07:34] that we're living in now is not another
[1:07:36] killing of the lamb. That was that was
[1:07:39] the feast of the lamb. That was the
[1:07:41] feast. But if you read in Leviticus 23,
[1:07:44] uh if you write it down, you read all
[1:07:46] the feasts of the Old Testament, all
[1:07:47] seven, and you'll read in there, read
[1:07:50] the feast of uh atonement that I'm
[1:07:53] talking about this morning, because you
[1:07:55] will find it's not another killing of
[1:07:56] the lamb, but what we find in that feast
[1:07:59] of atonement that it's a washing, it's a
[1:08:03] it's and and God knew that the feast of
[1:08:06] atonement was needed today more than any
[1:08:08] other time because he knew how dirty and
[1:08:12] how diseaseinfested
[1:08:13] the world would become.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; And he knew the bride would live in it.
[1:08:19] But he's not left us without a specific
[1:08:21] word to deal with it.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; And we we do what we we lean to the word
[1:08:26] to keep oursel out of temptation, but
[1:08:28] how to and how to escape it, but then
[1:08:30] how to quickly be cleansed of a disease.
[1:08:34] This is the day of atonement in this
[1:08:36] hour. And you'll find in the atonement
[1:08:39] if you read it there, it wasn't another
[1:08:41] killing of the lamb, but it was a a
[1:08:44] mourning or a conviction or a repentance
[1:08:46] in that. So, in other words, Christ
[1:08:48] didn't go have to go to Calvary again.
[1:08:50] He was the Passover lamb. He already
[1:08:52] fulfilled that. But this in this feast
[1:08:55] of atonement, it's a restoration back to
[1:08:58] what our atonement did for us.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; And when the message was revealed to us,
[1:09:02] it brought us back to the true
[1:09:04] atonement.
[1:09:06] Let me quote the prophet. He says that
[1:09:09] this this message of the last days
[1:09:10] brings us out of Pentecostal and world
[1:09:13] traditions
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; to the genuine atonement, the word.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Let me say it again. This message was to
[1:09:22] bring us out of out of Pentecostal and
[1:09:24] world traditions. Boy, I could preach
[1:09:26] another sermon on that. This message has
[1:09:28] not come to take us back into Pentecost.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; That's a deception. Amen.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; This message has come to bring us out of
[1:09:37] Pentecostal and world traditions to the
[1:09:41] genuine atonement, the word.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Why do we need the word resto? Why do we
[1:09:46] need a word in the last days? Because in
[1:09:49] the word, it's bleeding for us. It has a
[1:09:51] washing. It's the washing of the water
[1:09:54] by the word.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; And more than any other healing, God is
[1:09:58] healing cancer here. God is God is doing
[1:10:01] mighty things because his atonement are
[1:10:03] provided for it. But you know what you
[1:10:04] need the atonement for in this hour more
[1:10:06] than anything? To clean you and wash you
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; from the filthiness and the disease of
[1:10:13] sin.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; The word washes us.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; The priests in the Old Testament were
[1:10:20] washed and dressed by the prophet.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; This word is washing a people and
[1:10:27] cleaning a people. Why? Because in the
[1:10:30] end time, she'll get dirtied again.
[1:10:32] Satan wants to dirty her.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; You stay in this word. It'll wash you.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Non. It'll wash you.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; It'll clean you.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; You're a clean through my word. Jesus
[1:10:44] said, can you say amen? Jesus said,
[1:10:46] you're a clean through my word. Praise
[1:10:50] the Lord. I'm going to have to skip some
[1:10:51] of this here. Now, if you want to know
[1:10:58] what hour we're living in, we're under
[1:10:59] the feast of atonement.
[1:11:02] The message calls us out of Pentecostal
[1:11:04] world traditions to the genuine
[1:11:06] atonement, the word. This is a washing
[1:11:08] like no other. God knew at the end time
[1:11:10] how dirty and how diseaseinfested this
[1:11:12] world would be. He knew the bride would
[1:11:14] be living in it. And he has not left us
[1:11:16] without a specific word to deal with it.
[1:11:18] What to do to keep oursel out of
[1:11:20] temptation. We know what to do. The
[1:11:22] word. Can you say amen? And also to
[1:11:25] quickly be cleansed of the disease of
[1:11:28] sin. I just want to make a note. This is
[1:11:30] why this church, Literal Life Church, is
[1:11:32] here. It's to preach the power of the
[1:11:35] blood through the word.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; This is what it's all about. Can you say
[1:11:40] saving people from their sin, their
[1:11:44] leprosy?
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; That's for you. And that's for anyone
[1:11:49] who walks through that door.
[1:11:51] We preach the power of the blood of
[1:11:53] Jesus Christ, which is the only remedy
[1:11:56] for sin.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; I should get bigger amens to that.
[1:11:59] That's what this church is all about.
[1:12:02] You have a strange person show up, I
[1:12:04] believe we should embrace him and
[1:12:06] welcome him or her. And I believe we
[1:12:08] should create do everything in our power
[1:12:11] to create an atmosphere that the Holy
[1:12:13] Spirit can come down and they be washed
[1:12:15] in the blood of the lamb. You have a
[1:12:17] part in that. You're not just coming to
[1:12:19] church to sit there like a bump on a
[1:12:20] log. But when you worship, when you say
[1:12:22] amen, when you join in, you're creating
[1:12:25] an atmosphere
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; that his power of his blood can purge
[1:12:30] the leprosy, clean the people, and the
[1:12:32] worst sinner that walks through these
[1:12:34] doors, you ought to create an atmosphere
[1:12:36] so they can be delivered. That's what
[1:12:37] this church is about. Amen.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; If you came in this morning all consumed
[1:12:43] by other thoughts, the music, the
[1:12:46] temperature, I believe the music is part
[1:12:48] of it. But if you got your mind on the
[1:12:49] music or what temperature it's too hot
[1:12:51] or too cold in here, or the problems
[1:12:53] that's in the church, which we're not
[1:12:55] immune from that, or how you look to
[1:12:57] everybody or you're thinking about your
[1:12:58] job or your money, shame on us for
[1:13:00] coming to church that way. It's an
[1:13:02] important time to come and see the blood
[1:13:05] do its work.
[1:13:07] Everybody should have a chance at this.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; And you have a responsibility to not
[1:13:12] only be clean yourself, but to say we
[1:13:15] have a word here that can clean any. The
[1:13:17] worst of sinner, the worst of habits,
[1:13:20] the worst of addictions, the worst of
[1:13:22] panic attacks, the worst of depression
[1:13:26] is under the atonement.
[1:13:31] If you believe that like I believe it,
[1:13:33] we ought to stand together every service
[1:13:35] Wednesday night or Sunday and create an
[1:13:37] atmosphere
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; that he comes down and says, "I'm
[1:13:42] pleased in this atmosphere." It's not
[1:13:44] people that are, you know, I just say
[1:13:46] something as a little rebuke from the
[1:13:47] pastor. God didn't call us here to just
[1:13:49] sit on the sit like a bunk on bump on
[1:13:51] the log and not say, "Amen, just be
[1:13:53] quiet and go back out again." No, we
[1:13:55] engage because we're part of bringing
[1:13:57] our lick of fire.
[1:14:01] You're part of that young person. You're
[1:14:03] part of that.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Sometimes this becomes too intellectual
[1:14:06] where we just come and hear in a sermon.
[1:14:08] We get in our cars and go. We're not
[1:14:09] here just to hear a sermon. We're here
[1:14:11] to see what he can do in our lives. For
[1:14:13] the word to clean us, wash us.
[1:14:18] That that river from Calvary because
[1:14:20] we've created Aperture will flow right
[1:14:23] from Calvary right through this whole
[1:14:25] audience.
[1:14:28] Somebody say, "It's gone. It's finished.
[1:14:31] It's done."
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; That's why when the Holy Spirit come
[1:14:34] down in that youth meeting the other
[1:14:35] night, that girl confessed something.
[1:14:36] She said, "I've never confessed this
[1:14:38] before." Many of them were confessing
[1:14:39] things and conf the Bible says, "I
[1:14:42] didn't ask for that." The Bible says,
[1:14:44] "Confess your faults one to another. You
[1:14:46] expose the devil." And God becomes
[1:14:49] pleased at the honesty, the humility,
[1:14:51] and all of a sudden the Holy Spirit
[1:14:53] drops down. We begin to pray. But it's
[1:14:55] because she said, "I believe because
[1:14:57] I've done this tonight. I believe this
[1:14:59] is over tonight. This that I've had most
[1:15:02] of my life, it's done tonight." And I
[1:15:04] said, "If you're going to confess that,
[1:15:06] we're going to stand and pray right now
[1:15:07] and stand behind that confession.
[1:15:12] Right now. It can be done right now."
[1:15:18] That's what we should be believing.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Well, maybe they'll get it someday. No,
[1:15:22] you better seize that moment.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; You might ought to seize it this morning
[1:15:27] and say, you know, whatever is the devil
[1:15:28] bothering me, I'm going to confess it's
[1:15:30] going to be over and I'm going to leave
[1:15:31] this building this morning without that
[1:15:33] habit.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; I know we talk about waiting on the
[1:15:38] Lord. But when he moves the waters, you
[1:15:40] better get in the water.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; What are you thinking about that's too
[1:15:45] much of a trouble in your life? What are
[1:15:47] you thinking about? Don't keep thinking
[1:15:48] about it. Confess it before the Lord.
[1:15:51] Say, "God, I want you to take this thing
[1:15:52] right now.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; This pornography, this temptation, this
[1:15:57] this thing that's binding my life, this
[1:15:59] bitterness towards other people.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; Take it right now.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Let the flow of the washing of the word
[1:16:06] wash through here and just wash it out
[1:16:08] of my life.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; I feel his presence here this morning so
[1:16:14] real." Hallelujah. Somebody lift your
[1:16:16] hand. Say, "God, I receive what you have
[1:16:18] for me this morning. I receive it in
[1:16:20] Jesus name.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; I take it because it's the word you've
[1:16:24] given for me.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:27] Amen. So, we are the church. We stand as
[1:16:30] a church that way. We stand being washed
[1:16:33] of our sin and our spirits and our
[1:16:35] attitudes and our habits and our
[1:16:38] prejudice and our pride. That's why we
[1:16:41] come to church. Can you say amen?
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Don't forget that. Amen.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Even leprosy, they never had a cure for
[1:16:49] it for thousands of years. Did you know
[1:16:52] the physical disease of leprosy, they
[1:16:54] never had a cure in the Bible, of
[1:16:56] course, but they never had a cure for
[1:16:58] leprosy until the 20th century.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Well, isn't that amazing?
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; They never found a care. And brother
[1:17:08] Bram says that's a type of sin. And I
[1:17:10] know he went to Calvary and he paid the
[1:17:13] price. But now we come in Satan's Eden,
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; And the people of God living in that.
[1:17:19] We're going to need a revelation of what
[1:17:20] our atonement has done for us.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; I said we're going to need a revelation
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; and worship under this feast of
[1:17:26] atonement. And I forgot to mention you
[1:17:28] in Leviticus 23. It's a mourning. It it
[1:17:31] is a repentance. It's not another
[1:17:33] killing of the lamb. You'll see in there
[1:17:35] it's also don't get don't work that day.
[1:17:37] Don't work that because what is our
[1:17:39] feast of atonement? It's rest. You'll
[1:17:40] see the word rest. It's a rest. Don't
[1:17:42] you dare go to work. Don't you dare do
[1:17:44] that. What are we resting in? The
[1:17:46] finished work of Calvary. This is not
[1:17:48] another killing of the lamb, but it's a
[1:17:50] feast that we worship. I'm resting in
[1:17:52] what the lamb has done for me. I don't
[1:17:54] have to get to heaven by my works.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; I'm resting in a finished work.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; And the last thing he says, I love this
[1:18:03] part about the feast of atonement. It is
[1:18:05] your day to celebrate.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Celebrate what? Celebrate our atonement.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; I am covered. Covered. Covered by his
[1:18:21] blood.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Walking by faith. What are you doing?
[1:18:24] I'm celebrating my atonement. Living in
[1:18:27] love. I am covered. Covered. Covered by
[1:18:31] his blood. Oh Jesus has rescued me.
[1:18:36] Anybody else want to celebrate? I am
[1:18:38] covered. Covered, covered by his blood.
[1:18:43] Oh, walking by faith. Oh, living in
[1:18:47] love. I am covered, covered, covered by
[1:18:51] his blood. Oh, Jesus has rescued me.
[1:18:57] It's not another killing of the lamp.
[1:18:58] It's celebrating our atonement.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; It's worshiping and saying, "God, did
[1:19:03] you really do this for me? That there
[1:19:06] isn't any addiction? There isn't any
[1:19:08] sin. There is no leprosy that this
[1:19:11] atonement didn't cover.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; It's time to be happy about that.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; It's time to celebrate.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Boy, when that lamb took the book, there
[1:19:21] was worship going on. In Revelations 1,
[1:19:23] they worshiped because he was Lord. They
[1:19:25] worshiped because of his creation. In
[1:19:28] Revelations 5, they worship because of
[1:19:30] redemption.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; That's a deeper worship. A lot of the
[1:19:35] church world is worshiping their songs
[1:19:37] saying because of creation. That's
[1:19:39] great. But when you come to the power of
[1:19:41] redemption and what Calvary's done for
[1:19:42] you, it's time to celebrate. It's time
[1:19:45] to worship.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; It's time to shout, "Thank you, Lord."
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Because you see now people like you can
[1:19:52] come and you say, "I don't feel worthy
[1:19:54] and I got all this baggage and I' I've
[1:19:56] come through a divorce." Whatever it is
[1:19:59] this morning, the atonement says if
[1:20:01] you'll repent and mourn and say, "God, I
[1:20:04] bring my life under this feast of
[1:20:05] atonement." He says he'll answer back,
[1:20:08] "Forgive you completely."
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; You no longer had to sit there this
[1:20:15] morning thinking, "This is for everybody
[1:20:17] else, but I'll never get in." That's a
[1:20:18] lie of the devil. This blood is for your
[1:20:21] mistakes. This blood is for your sin.
[1:20:25] Lift your hand and receive it this
[1:20:26] morning.
[1:20:28] It's for me. It's for my problems. It's
[1:20:31] for what I've come through. Every one of
[1:20:33] you have a story. And none of you wanted
[1:20:35] the story that you got.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; But you have a story. And the story
[1:20:40] doesn't end with just your problems. The
[1:20:42] story ends in redemption.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; The story ends in redemption.
[1:20:49] Hallelujah.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; Your biography, your book is going to
[1:20:53] end not because you perfected yourself,
[1:20:56] but because the blood washed you clean.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; How many want to be clean? Washed in the
[1:21:04] water of his word. Clean of this
[1:21:06] leprosy.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, I you know, I know I can't I can't
[1:21:12] finish preaching this morning. I think
[1:21:14] we ought to stand and rejoice and
[1:21:17] celebrate our atonement.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; I'll finish this wherever God says to
[1:21:21] finish it. But you ought to lift, shout,
[1:21:23] "Thank you, Lord. Glory be to God. Thank
[1:21:26] you for my atonement, Lord. Thank you
[1:21:29] for what you did for me. It was for my
[1:21:30] problems. It was for my past mistakes.
[1:21:33] It's for my habits. It was for my
[1:21:35] addictions. It's for my sin that I did
[1:21:38] last year or last week. This is God. I
[1:21:40] confess it. There has to be a true
[1:21:43] repentance to say, "God, I repent." How
[1:21:45] many would say before this, "I repent.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; I repent. I I I God, I bring it to you.
[1:21:51] Whatever it is, I bring it to you.
[1:21:53] Father, I pray, Lord, that you will
[1:21:56] come, Lord, and just once again identify
[1:21:59] yourself among your people." Lord, we
[1:22:02] could ask for a lot of things. There's
[1:22:03] many sicknesses and many things, and we
[1:22:05] ask for those things. But Lord, we are
[1:22:08] celebrating and rejoicing that your
[1:22:11] washing of the water of the word is
[1:22:14] still here for your people. And if the
[1:22:17] mind has become dirty through social
[1:22:19] media, if the spirit has been tainted
[1:22:22] and dirtied, if we've even taken on
[1:22:25] filthy spirits, may your blood cleanse
[1:22:28] us as we repent this morning. Let it
[1:22:31] wash it all away in Jesus name. In Jesus
[1:22:37] name.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; In Jesus name. Hallelujah.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; I say hallelujah.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; I say praise our God.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Somebody needs to lift some praise to
[1:22:50] him this morning. The musicians can
[1:22:53] come, but you don't need music to praise
[1:22:54] the Lord. You don't need to sing a song.
[1:22:56] You just say, "Lift your voice. Say, I
[1:22:58] thank you, Lord. Deliver me, Lord.
[1:23:02] Wash me, Lord.
[1:23:04] Wash me of all those things. Let me come
[1:23:06] Lord before your presence in this day of
[1:23:08] atonement. This feast of atonement. Let
[1:23:10] it be a celebration. You know friends,
[1:23:14] the message rank sometimes is they're
[1:23:16] debating this feast of atonement.
[1:23:18] They're debating over the atonement.
[1:23:20] Who's in? Who's out? Let's stop debating
[1:23:22] the atonement and start celebrating our
[1:23:25] atonement.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; I say it online. Let's stop debating
[1:23:30] this message. Let's start celebrating
[1:23:32] the atonement. Let's start worshiping
[1:23:34] about it.
[1:23:36] Let's let the effect of this atonement
[1:23:39] affect us in our lives instead of
[1:23:41] debating about what season we're in and
[1:23:43] what feast we're in and all these other
[1:23:45] things. I told you I believe we're in
[1:23:46] the feast of atonement cuz the next one
[1:23:48] is the feast of tabernacles, the last
[1:23:50] one. And God's going to fulfill that
[1:23:51] too. You know what it is? It's little
[1:23:53] tents, little places, little dwelling
[1:23:55] places. Guess what? When we go in a
[1:23:58] rapture, we're getting a new dwelling
[1:23:59] place. And that's when we'll fill we'll
[1:24:02] fill the feast of fulfill the feast of
[1:24:04] tabernacles.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Getting ready to cross over into my
[1:24:09] little tent.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; And it's a word body. It never gets sick
[1:24:12] and never can be tempted. The devil
[1:24:14] can't whisper in my ear. And that's the
[1:24:16] next feast I'm headed towards. But
[1:24:18] before I get there, I'm worshiping under
[1:24:20] this feast of atonement. Look what the
[1:24:22] Lord has done for me.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Look what the Lord has done for you.
[1:24:31] Hallelujah.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; I will praise him. I will praise him.
[1:24:39] Praise
[1:24:41] the lamb for sinners.
[1:24:48] Oh,
[1:24:50] give
[1:24:52] him glory.
[1:24:56] people
[1:25:00] for his blood has washed away
[1:25:06] each sin.
[1:25:10] Let me hear you sing it now. Oh, I
[1:25:15] will praise him. Yes, I
[1:25:21] will praise him.
[1:25:24] Praise
[1:25:26] the L for
[1:25:41] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:25:43] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:25:47] Blood can wash away.
[1:25:53] Let our lamb hear your voices. Sing it
[1:25:55] without the music. Let the lamb hear
[1:25:57] your voice. I
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; I will praise you
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; with all your heart now.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; I
[1:26:06] will praise him.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise
[1:26:13] the lamb for sinners.
[1:26:22] Oh, give
[1:26:25] him glory,
[1:26:27] oh ye people.
[1:26:33] For his blood has washed away,
[1:26:40] each day.
[1:26:44] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:26:47] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah Lord.
[1:26:54] Hallelujah. And when the book was open,
[1:26:56] they worshiped. They praised because he
[1:27:00] has made us kings and priests. We have
[1:27:03] been redeemed by his blood.
[1:27:06] Out of every kindred and nation and
[1:27:08] people, out of every situation, out of
[1:27:11] every story, you've redeemed them. You
[1:27:14] You brought us back. Your word has found
[1:27:17] us, Lord. May no matter if we're raised
[1:27:20] in the message or raised in the world or
[1:27:23] you found us. You found us. Your
[1:27:25] redemption found us. And that's why our
[1:27:29] hearts are joyful this morning. Let me
[1:27:31] say before we sing again, this atonement
[1:27:35] feast is not without repentance. And
[1:27:38] deliverance is not without repentance.
[1:27:42] Non had to dip seven times in a river.
[1:27:44] He didn't want to. When God asks you to
[1:27:47] dip in humility seven times, wherever he
[1:27:52] asked you to do, would you have the
[1:27:54] repentance in your heart? You're not
[1:27:55] going to get there without saying,
[1:27:56] "Lord, I repent for what I've done. I'm
[1:27:59] sorry, Lord. Can I please have access to
[1:28:03] this blood of the precious lamb?" How
[1:28:06] many would do it just now? If you
[1:28:08] haven't given your life to the Lord, if
[1:28:10] you haven't rededicated your life to
[1:28:12] Jesus Christ, maybe you're coming to
[1:28:15] church, but you haven't rededicated. I'm
[1:28:17] encouraging you other this feast. When
[1:28:20] you are saying, I mourn for my sins. I
[1:28:23] mourn for what I've done, but now I want
[1:28:25] to celebrate. I don't want to be free in
[1:28:27] Jesus name. Bless those hearts. Bless
[1:28:30] those lives, Lord. God,
[1:28:36] you'll not leave one of them out, Lord,
[1:28:39] that are called. You reached all the way
[1:28:42] over into the Syrian army to a non who
[1:28:45] was stubborn, who's prideful, thought he
[1:28:47] was too big to go in the Jordan, but you
[1:28:49] reached out. Your word went to him and
[1:28:51] found him. May your word reach out to
[1:28:54] every person here this morning. And may
[1:28:56] your word reach out to this community.
[1:28:58] May you find your elected seed. I'm
[1:29:01] asking for them, Lord. May they hear us
[1:29:03] on the broadcast. May they come to
[1:29:05] visit. May they hear through a witness
[1:29:07] of a servant that's standing here. But
[1:29:09] may you find your last elected seed in
[1:29:12] this community and this area and bring
[1:29:15] them to the washing of the water of the
[1:29:18] word. Not to a church, but to the
[1:29:20] washing. Lord,
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; grant it. Father, we pray. And we give
[1:29:24] those lives, rededicated lives into your
[1:29:28] hands now in Jesus name we ask it. Amen.
[1:29:33] I am covered.

[1:29:40] faith,

[1:31:35] For I can speak the name of Jesus
[1:31:38] Christ.
[1:31:40] Oh, he still comes knocking when he can.
[1:31:46] But I've been delivered by the blood of
[1:31:50] the lamb. I am covered
[1:31:53] covered
[1:31:55] by his blood. Walking by faith,
[1:31:59] living in love.
[1:32:01] When I get covered, covered
[1:32:06] by his blood. Lord Jesus has rescued me.
[1:32:11] Brother Bobby, come here, brother.
[1:32:14] Michael, he's looking at me like I'm
[1:32:16] acting crazy this morning. Are you
[1:32:18] Michael? Yep. I am crazy. Crazy about
[1:32:22] the Lord. I've seen the way you're
[1:32:24] looking at me. You haven't seen anything
[1:32:26] yet, but I can dance for the Lord.
[1:32:29] Amen. Sh. Tell us what you know of that
[1:32:32] grandson.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a miracle. What a miracle.
[1:32:37] When this first happened, um Elijah was
[1:32:40] actually playing at my house and we were
[1:32:41] skirting him with a hose and I got a my
[1:32:44] daughter got a call. There's a kidney
[1:32:45] that came in. We got to rush him to the
[1:32:47] hospital. So when
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; summer seizure some Yeah, it was a
[1:32:51] Donald Center a couple years older than
[1:32:53] him, but uh I guess they passed away and
[1:32:56] we had to get him to the hospital. My
[1:32:58] daughter called me and said, "Dad, what
[1:33:00] should I do? Should we trust in God?
[1:33:02] Should I turn this kidney down? Just
[1:33:04] believe in God." So I got a hold of
[1:33:06] brother Paul. I said, "Brother Paul,
[1:33:07] what should I do? My daughter's crying."
[1:33:09] She said, "Should we just trust in God
[1:33:11] and not take this kidney?" And he said,
[1:33:13] "Brother, if God hasn't established the
[1:33:15] healing yet, go what the doctors are
[1:33:18] doing."
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; So but listen to brother Paul said,
[1:33:21] "Lonnie, this is what we need to do."
[1:33:22] Well, Lonnie did that. We went to the
[1:33:24] hospital and brother Paul showed
[1:33:27] pictures. I I'm amazed. A couple hours
[1:33:30] after surgery, he's up bouncing a
[1:33:32] balloon. Even before that, his eyes is
[1:33:34] countenance. Look like nothing even
[1:33:36] happened. And and this is a kidney
[1:33:38] transplant. I never seen nothing like
[1:33:40] this in my life, but I know what kind of
[1:33:42] God we serve. And that's a absolute
[1:33:45] miracle.
[1:33:47] And then uh when I was blessed to
[1:33:50] before, he checked the catheter bag full
[1:33:53] of urine. If I can say this in a good
[1:33:55] way, the kidneys functioning beautiful.
[1:33:58] And I just thank God. and he just he
[1:34:03] looks like a little boy that just came
[1:34:05] in and put a hospital gown on like
[1:34:07] nothing even happened. It's just a
[1:34:09] miracle. Thanks, brother Paul and all
[1:34:11] the saints for praying. God bless you
[1:34:13] all.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:34:21] Don't forget to pray for him. He's still
[1:34:22] got some hurdles to go through. Let's
[1:34:24] lift him up in prayer and believe God's
[1:34:26] going to make him a completely normal
[1:34:28] boy in the name of Jesus Christ. Just
[1:34:30] make him a completely normal boy so he
[1:34:32] can enjoy the rest of his life. I am
