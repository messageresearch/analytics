[0:00] going to head the men's meeting so if
[0:03] everything these days is lord willing
[0:05] lord willing takes on extra meaning
[0:07] these days and that's the way it should
[0:11] on september 24th to the 26th then
[0:14] everything you need to know is on the
[0:16] men's meeting dot org website so that's
[0:18] the registration still open there's
[0:19] still a few uh slots that are available
[0:22] there
[0:22] brother paul mentioned being busy uh
[0:25] this uh this season of our lives and i
[0:28] just wanted to share a little bit with
[0:30] you this morning about vision books and
[0:32] what we're doing there uh it's it's
[0:34] become something that is uh larger than
[0:36] we expected but uh it's been a blessing
[0:39] to many many people and uh there was
[0:42] nobody in the world who's uh doing
[0:44] large-scale printing of the message uh
[0:46] at the moment and so the lord laid it on
[0:48] our hearts to be able to uh
[0:51] take the message and to be able to print
[0:53] it we print it offshore uh and we're
[0:56] able to distribute in many many
[0:58] countries around the world these this is
[1:00] a picture of uh a series of six books we
[1:03] did in the bemba language
[1:05] in zambia and when i was there two years
[1:08] ago uh there's a whole section i think
[1:10] there's something like
[1:12] 20 million people who speak bimba
[1:15] in that part of the world and there's
[1:16] many many believers who are there
[1:17] they've never had books in their
[1:19] language before
[1:20] they've had some recordings with
[1:22] translations but they've never had books
[1:24] before and these are people who live in
[1:26] very very primitive conditions
[1:28] uh no electricity no water and they live
[1:31] in huts and caves and
[1:33] there's believers among them and they're
[1:36] just so excited there's kind of a
[1:38] revival going on just because now these
[1:40] evangelists can go and they can
[1:43] preach and they can witness and they can
[1:45] share materials and leave things with
[1:46] them
[1:47] we're in the process of waiting for the
[1:50] publishing of
[1:51] bibles in the bemba language we have
[1:54] sent english bibles to them but they've
[1:56] hardly ever seen a bimba bible you've
[1:59] got to understand that in your town you
[2:01] have very few christian bookstores left
[2:03] in in most third world countries there
[2:05] are none at all there never have been
[2:07] for years and so to have access to a
[2:10] bible
[2:11] for them is a really extraordinary thing
[2:14] and so uh by god's grace we've been able
[2:16] to supply bibles to many many nations
[2:19] around the world and uh it's uh it's
[2:21] just been very exciting
[2:23] so uh this is a
[2:25] one of on the left here is one of the
[2:27] missionaries we sponsor about 30
[2:28] missionaries who travel in different
[2:30] parts of africa
[2:32] and when they're able to go they tell us
[2:34] that there's very few people who come
[2:36] out of denominations even who've been in
[2:38] denominational churches all their lives
[2:40] who've ever seen a bible they've never
[2:42] had one and so
[2:44] this is a
[2:45] a big issue for them and they're just
[2:47] excited to have their own
[2:49] their own materials here this is just a
[2:51] picture of some of the places where
[2:54] books are gone and and
[2:56] for instance we ship materials into
[2:58] malawi and malawi feeds about four or
[3:01] five other countries that uh that that
[3:05] they have access to because they're kind
[3:06] of stuck right in the middle of a bunch
[3:08] of other nations and so
[3:10] it's kind of an exponential thing for
[3:12] books to be traveling to that part of
[3:14] the world i like this picture here i
[3:16] wanted to show it to you because
[3:18] this is a lady here who's looking up
[3:20] some things in her bible the brother on
[3:22] the right yellow shirt he's an
[3:23] evangelist and a missionary and he's
[3:26] instructing this husband and wife in
[3:29] things in her bible i'm going to take
[3:31] the same picture and blow it up here's
[3:32] her bible
[3:35] so that bible's had a lot of use
[3:37] and they hang on to bibles like that
[3:39] because they can't replace them
[3:41] and uh it's just for them to let that
[3:44] bible go that would be a terrible thing
[3:46] they just they just want to hang on to
[3:47] it until they can't read it anymore so
[3:49] it's really exciting but these
[3:51] missionaries are traveling among uh
[3:53] these are messiah
[3:55] people in
[3:56] eastern africa and tanzania and they're
[3:59] just excited to have these materials
[4:02] brother anwar does a lot of translating
[4:05] still in in new york and
[4:08] we have because pakistan is a muslim
[4:10] country we cannot import christian
[4:13] materials into pakistan
[4:15] so we print within the country and right
[4:18] now they're at the last stages of
[4:19] printing the seven or seven seals book
[4:22] we've already done the seven church age
[4:24] book and you can see on his motorcycle
[4:26] there he's got bundles of books that
[4:27] he's bringing around to rural areas and
[4:30] a very dangerous part of the world but
[4:32] these missionaries are so excited to
[4:34] have uh you know books in their language
[4:36] that they're just excited so
[4:39] they've got supplies now that they can
[4:41] give out to all their converts and old
[4:43] and young people who are able to read
[4:45] they're able to have their own copy of
[4:46] the book and this is the church age book
[4:48] that they have here that's brother
[4:49] anwar's brother on the right uh octar
[4:52] and he's given out books to some of his
[4:55] folks there and actually teaching to
[4:56] read at the same time they have reading
[4:59] classes because 75 percent of pakistani
[5:02] people are illiterate and they can't
[5:04] read so this is exciting for them to be
[5:06] able to have their bibles and in the
[5:07] read as well this is a group from
[5:09] brother ron borthwick's church brother
[5:11] ron passed away a couple of years ago
[5:13] and uh this is a group from the church
[5:15] brother mekwee is the pastor there now
[5:17] and uh they're receiving books in great
[5:19] britain and english
[5:20] english language there
[5:22] i thought this was a great picture i
[5:24] mean uh you couldn't make this up these
[5:26] are horse riders going into the
[5:28] mountains in remote villages uh in an
[5:31] undisclosed area they didn't want us to
[5:33] say where this is but they've got their
[5:35] saddlebags full of church age books in
[5:37] spanish
[5:38] and they're bringing the the books
[5:40] around the people in honduras were so um
[5:44] zealous about spreading books that uh
[5:46] they've had
[5:47] several reprints of of books already
[5:51] once we establish a connection within
[5:53] the country and get the import
[5:54] straightened out
[5:56] we're able to
[5:57] reprint and reprint and so the people in
[6:00] honduras they travel all over the place
[6:02] and and get books out it's just really
[6:04] exciting
[6:05] to do that this is another place in uh
[6:07] in honduras and those people get the
[6:10] books they're just excited in their
[6:12] churches there to be able to have
[6:13] materials on their own and again this is
[6:16] uh east africa here messiah people i've
[6:19] got literally thousands and thousands of
[6:22] pictures like this and testimonies and
[6:24] stories of people receiving new bibles
[6:26] and materials like that and so it's just
[6:29] exciting for this for this part of the
[6:32] world to be receiving
[6:33] materials you can see the
[6:36] there's many many churches that we've
[6:37] got pictures of that look just like the
[6:38] building in the background there
[6:40] one of the most exciting places though
[6:42] where things are happening is in malawi
[6:44] and this is brother precious makatanji
[6:48] and he is the lead translator in malawi
[6:51] and uh malawi is just uh you know thanks
[6:55] to
[6:56] some believers we've got
[6:58] over a hundred thousand dollars worth of
[7:00] new bibles distributed among people in
[7:02] the backwoods part of malawi over the
[7:04] last two or three months
[7:06] and uh as we speak there are three
[7:09] different shipments coming from three
[7:10] different places in the world
[7:13] into malawi and one of the shipments
[7:15] contains
[7:16] sermons like this there's three sermons
[7:18] in this booklet here
[7:19] and uh these are uh these are are
[7:23] printed together in one little booklet
[7:25] to cut the cost down and a
[7:28] book like this costs
[7:30] 8.6 cents
[7:33] per booklet
[7:35] so we printed 480 000 of these
[7:38] for the believers in malawi in the
[7:40] chichewa language and they're on route
[7:43] now they're matter of fact just a couple
[7:44] of days away from uh from malawi and uh
[7:47] they're just let me tell you they're
[7:49] they're already have
[7:50] revivals have already broken out in the
[7:52] country uh for uh for the expectation
[7:55] that they have as they haven't had books
[7:57] since 2003 they haven't had any
[8:00] materials brought to them and so they're
[8:02] very excited about uh having their own
[8:04] uh materials
[8:06] and so brother uh precious has been
[8:08] instrumental in helping to establish
[8:10] things over there with some of the other
[8:12] older brothers that are there some of
[8:14] them uh brother paddington and uh
[8:17] brother jim has worked with malawi for a
[8:19] lot of years and done a fabulous work
[8:21] there and
[8:23] this is this is just renewing the hearts
[8:25] of the people over there and
[8:27] they're just very excited so these are
[8:29] some of the bibles that are going into
[8:30] the back parts of the country one pastor
[8:33] made a little video recording and he
[8:35] said
[8:36] for the last 10 years he said i never
[8:38] had any books and never had my own bible
[8:40] so i preached from my phone
[8:43] for the last 10 years that's what he
[8:45] would bring to the pulpit and he would
[8:47] preach from his phone
[8:49] two years ago he said his phone broke
[8:52] and it was no replacing so imagine now
[8:54] he's he's preaching to his congregation
[8:57] without a bible without any message
[9:00] books
[9:01] uh he came in he came in the message
[9:03] after books were available so he had he
[9:06] has nothing but he believes the message
[9:07] and preaches it every a couple of times
[9:09] every week and and has has no resources
[9:12] whatsoever and he was just so excited to
[9:15] be able to have his own bible
[9:17] and uh we you're all looking at me funny
[9:19] like you know what's the big deal about
[9:21] having a bible if you haven't ever had a
[9:23] bible and you're a preacher in this
[9:25] message to get your own bible is a
[9:27] really extraordinary thing and they're
[9:29] very excited let me tell you so uh
[9:32] this is this is just really neat but now
[9:35] like i say the the the effect of this
[9:37] the net effect of this is just uh you
[9:40] know rippling through these uh countries
[9:42] and uh people are blessed i brought
[9:44] along uh one of the copies this is the
[9:46] first copy of the book to be printed in
[9:48] india
[9:49] and it's in the shona language and we
[9:52] have a young minister in our church
[9:54] who's from zimbabwe and he speaks the
[9:56] shona language and so we re we printed
[9:59] the church age book for these believers
[10:01] there and
[10:03] this is this is just absolutely
[10:05] wonderful to be able to have this and
[10:06] the quality uh it's made so that it
[10:09] doesn't fall apart in the african heat
[10:11] uh if you just glue it it'll fall apart
[10:13] when it gets hot enough so they stitch
[10:15] it and glue it and um
[10:17] you know make it uh very durable
[10:20] so to print this book
[10:22] and we have printed in the millions of
[10:24] these not this particular language but
[10:26] of these books it costs us 86 cents per
[10:29] book
[10:32] so that's why we're able to do so many
[10:34] and and uh be able to distribute them so
[10:36] far so it's it's uh it's just a blessing
[10:39] you know for the uh for the saints over
[10:41] there and uh brother paul and and your
[10:43] mission group here has been very
[10:45] supportive and we appreciate that very
[10:46] much
[10:47] uh it's it's that's the way it operates
[10:50] and to me uh having the fivefold
[10:52] ministry in a particular country they're
[10:55] the ones who decide what's printed then
[10:57] they take the books when they arrive and
[10:58] they distribute them fairly among the
[11:00] churches over there
[11:02] there's a lot of work that's being done
[11:04] through the five-fold ministry in those
[11:06] nations there and i think that's the way
[11:08] it should happen i think that the
[11:09] ministry should have a say
[11:12] in how that's done so we're just a part
[11:14] of that process and uh at vision books
[11:17] and we just facilitate the need and uh
[11:20] we thank you for all the support uh
[11:22] that's been given
[11:24] uh so why don't we stand to our feet i
[11:26] don't want to take too much time here
[11:28] this morning and let's take our bibles
[11:30] if you don't mind let's go to
[11:32] jeremiah the 29th chapter
[11:36] we'll take a little study there this
[11:38] morning
[11:40] and i'd like to title this a turning
[11:42] point
[11:44] um just as we begin i just want to say
[11:47] there's a lot of folks that we haven't
[11:48] seen in a while it's great to see the
[11:50] hatfields here and
[11:52] the terries and good to see sister
[11:54] loretta uh here this morning may god
[11:56] bless you and
[11:57] uh all of our friends here it's it's
[11:59] just wonderful to be able to reconnect
[12:01] and may god bless you
[12:03] uh jeremiah chapter 29 this is a
[12:05] familiar passage of scripture to us and
[12:07] i wanted to read uh just beginning if
[12:09] you don't mind that
[12:15] let's begin at verse 10 for thus saith
[12:18] the lord
[12:20] that after 70 years be accomplished at
[12:22] babylon i will visit you
[12:24] and perform my good word toward you in
[12:27] causing you to return to this place so
[12:30] this is literally a turning point this
[12:32] is this is not yet this is going to be
[12:35] in 70 years because they're moving out
[12:37] to babylon and then in 70 years
[12:40] things will take a turn and you will
[12:42] return back to this place
[12:44] for i know the thoughts that i think
[12:46] towards you saith the lord thoughts of
[12:48] peace and not of evil to give you an
[12:51] expected end
[12:53] and then shall ye call upon me and ye
[12:55] shall go and pray unto me and i will
[12:58] hearken unto you and you shall seek me
[13:00] and find me when you shall search for me
[13:02] with all your heart and i will be found
[13:05] of you saith the lord i will turn away
[13:07] your captivity and i will gather you
[13:09] from all the nations and from all the
[13:11] places whether i have driven you saith
[13:13] the lord and i will bring you again into
[13:15] the place once i caused you to be
[13:17] carried away
[13:19] captive heavenly father we thank you
[13:21] lord for the reading of the word and now
[13:24] we pray you'd pour yourself out upon it
[13:26] and bless it to our hearts
[13:28] make it real make it personal
[13:31] in jesus christ's name we pray
[13:34] amen you may be seated this morning god
[13:36] bless you
[13:40] now
[13:41] let me just give you this little
[13:42] quotation i'm not going to rely too much
[13:44] on this here this morning but just to
[13:46] get us
[13:47] some key statements there
[13:50] but i just wanted to say this about
[13:51] brother paul uh this morning and uh like
[13:54] he said he and i we've not been together
[13:56] a great deal over the last little while
[13:58] but i appreciate his work and here's
[14:00] what brother branham said about a pastor
[14:01] he said what we need in our churches is
[14:04] a man that's got an absolute
[14:06] you should be thankful that you have a
[14:07] pastor that has an absolute today
[14:10] a man of god that will stand tied to the
[14:12] word and to christ and to bring that
[14:14] congregation
[14:15] under that condition of where each
[14:17] member walks in the condition of this
[14:20] word
[14:21] seeing that word manifested and follow
[14:23] them these signs shall follow them that
[14:25] believe
[14:27] i'll tell you what it's a blessing to be
[14:28] able to have a a man of god who stands
[14:31] with the word of god knows what the
[14:32] absolute is and doesn't vary from that
[14:34] but brings the congregation under the
[14:36] condition of that word in other words
[14:38] getting the people ready for the next
[14:40] series of events
[14:41] that are taking place and this was on my
[14:43] heart this morning and i i just uh i'm
[14:46] just gonna look to him i've never really
[14:48] dealt with this subject per se before
[14:50] but i just felt on my heart the last
[14:52] couple of days that we would talk a
[14:53] little bit about this idea of a turning
[14:56] point and i believe we're on the cusp or
[14:58] the edge of a reality shift in our world
[15:01] uh there are things that are imminent
[15:03] things that are going to happen every
[15:04] single in indicator uh in our world
[15:07] whether it's financial or political or
[15:09] social uh spiritual every indicator is
[15:13] pointing towards an imminent change
[15:15] that's taken place and uh turning
[15:17] corners is something that brother
[15:19] branham talked about uh over his
[15:21] ministry he talked about it in several
[15:23] different places and uh it was certainly
[15:26] an interesting thing for him to uh
[15:28] describe it the way that he did
[15:31] so uh brother branham he he uses this
[15:34] phrase uh all through his ministry but
[15:36] he refers to it this way
[15:39] only at the end of his ministry and i
[15:42] found in my research i've found
[15:44] this is the first place where he makes
[15:46] this statement in particular about our
[15:48] time watch what he says
[15:50] he says the trouble of it is today that
[15:52] the churches will speak and say well
[15:54] what did moody say and what did sankey
[15:57] say
[15:58] he said this is the way that people will
[16:00] do it they'll look backwards to see what
[16:02] other men who were used of god what they
[16:05] said they're looking backwards and he
[16:08] said but speak and say what god said
[16:11] let's go forward and not back.
[16:15] now you remember brother branham said
[16:17] it's he said it's it's uh common for
[16:20] people to look back at what god did and
[16:22] look ahead to what god's going to do and
[16:23] fail to realize what god's doing in the
[16:25] present
[16:26] right but he says now what we need to do
[16:29] is to speak
[16:30] speak the word of the hour and say what
[16:32] god has said and let's go forward and
[16:34] not look back he said go this way i
[16:36] think it's wonderful that we've had a
[16:38] prophet that pointed us in a definite
[16:40] direction to so that we could know
[16:42] exactly where we need to go he said it's
[16:44] hard on these turning corners
[16:46] church don't want to believe that
[16:48] they're always referring back from their
[16:50] educational standpoint
[16:52] he said of course that's a school and
[16:55] stuff that's what schools do they they
[16:57] learn a method or they learn a viewpoint
[16:59] they learn a way and they uh you know
[17:01] they they promote that way they teach
[17:03] that way and he said but that's what
[17:05] schools do that's what they're that's
[17:06] what their job is that's what their
[17:08] mandate is but now that's not us that's
[17:11] what schools do
[17:12] right
[17:13] so he says that's
[17:15] they they learn through their book
[17:17] learning they that's that's the the way
[17:19] that they learn but we know so he's
[17:21] talking about them but we know that's us
[17:24] now he's talking about we know that
[17:26] through experience
[17:28] of trusting god
[17:30] and knowing that he does this
[17:33] in other words we know by experience
[17:36] that god turns corners doesn't he even
[17:38] when it's not politically correct even
[17:40] when it's not popular god still turns
[17:42] corners
[17:43] god does the unexpected in the early
[17:46] church in in the book of acts chapter 13
[17:48] when paul took the gospel from the jews
[17:50] and gave it to the gentiles it was a it
[17:53] was a turning point that there was not a
[17:56] jew in the in the world who would have
[17:57] appreciated what paul did
[18:00] they didn't even understand what paul
[18:02] did
[18:02] they thought they were the people of the
[18:04] covenant they thought they were the
[18:05] people who had a corner or a monopoly on
[18:08] on the on the promises and the prophets
[18:10] and the word of god and access to god
[18:12] they thought they had it and paul took
[18:14] it and turned it to the gentiles it was
[18:16] a major turning point
[18:18] in the history of the church but we know
[18:21] through experience god does this
[18:24] so it's not surprising to us that we see
[18:26] in the last day that god's doing the
[18:28] same thing and we're at a point where
[18:30] things are changing that things are
[18:31] turning and therefore your
[18:34] let me let me say it this way i believe
[18:37] there's a special type of grace that's
[18:39] given to the people that have to turn
[18:41] corners
[18:42] and to be able to go in a direction
[18:45] following the leadership of god
[18:47] even when it's not visible
[18:50] but there's a special type of grace
[18:51] that's given to people who have to turn
[18:54] corners and follow god into into a
[18:56] future like we're facing here because it
[18:59] is not logical it is not obvious we're
[19:02] actually walking to the change of our
[19:04] body we're walking to the marriage
[19:05] supper none of us have ever seen the
[19:07] marriage supper we're walking to a
[19:09] millennium none of us have ever seen the
[19:10] millennium but we believe it's there by
[19:12] faith don't we and so the this this
[19:15] exercise of your faith being being
[19:18] developed or grown to a place where
[19:20] you're actually going to walk out of
[19:22] this body and walk off the earth and
[19:24] join with our loved ones and take your
[19:25] seat at the marriage supper that is an
[19:27] exercise of faith that's going to
[19:29] require a step of faith and i believe
[19:31] that what god is doing is conditioning
[19:33] us or teaching teaching us to go through
[19:35] that transition even when the world
[19:38] speaks of other things and the world
[19:40] denies what you believe and the world is
[19:42] redefining everything that god has
[19:44] defined everything that's sacred is now
[19:47] seemingly
[19:49] up for redefinition
[19:51] in the eyes of the world but i will tell
[19:53] you something that's why i appreciate a
[19:54] man that has an absolute i appreciate
[19:56] god establishing an absolute in our day
[19:59] reestablishing the word of god as an
[20:01] absolute because without it we'd be
[20:03] floundering like everybody else out in
[20:05] there in the world wondering what is
[20:07] right wondering which way to go
[20:09] wondering what's next
[20:10] and having no clear idea or clear vision
[20:14] of what god is actually doing in the
[20:15] world around us
[20:18] and so brother bam said turning corners
[20:20] is hard and if you rely on education
[20:22] you're going to fall back on what other
[20:24] people have said about our time let me
[20:26] tell you i mean we know that nobody
[20:29] really got it right when it come to the
[20:31] opening of the word in the open book in
[20:32] the last day nobody really got it right
[20:34] brother bam said i studied all those
[20:36] writers and the you know the church
[20:38] fathers over those years
[20:40] and he said i had conclusions made when
[20:43] it came to the preaching on the seven
[20:44] seals and he said i was wrong about all
[20:46] of it the holy spirit had to come into
[20:48] the room and give him that understanding
[20:50] of the word of god personally
[20:52] and so therefore if we're relying on
[20:55] something that's back
[20:56] it's it's not going to be clear like god
[20:59] has made it clear in our time
[21:03] so i i think like i say i think there's
[21:04] a special kind of grace i believe that
[21:06] god
[21:07] don't tell me that god doesn't have a
[21:08] sense of humor he does have a sense of
[21:09] humor he chose us for the last and the
[21:12] greatest age on earth for the gentile
[21:14] people and you're looking around saying
[21:16] you know yeah i'm right and you look in
[21:19] the mirror and you think wow i'm just
[21:20] full of faults and failures i can't get
[21:22] my kids uh to pick up their socks in
[21:24] their bedroom and uh it's hard to make
[21:26] ends meet financially and all the other
[21:28] things that go on but yet god and his
[21:30] sovereignty chose you to live in the
[21:32] last day
[21:33] in the greatest of all of the ages to
[21:35] take the greatest of all the messages
[21:37] and embrace it in such a way that it
[21:39] would so quick in your body that your
[21:41] body your flesh would actually drop and
[21:43] you would elevate you would be elevated
[21:45] into a dimension
[21:46] that the world knows nothing about that
[21:48] the world doesn't see they don't they're
[21:50] not in tune with at all it's almost like
[21:52] the world is listening to am and we're
[21:54] tuned into fm
[21:56] right i mean they have a different
[21:58] priority they have a different way of of
[21:59] seeing things they have a different
[22:01] expectation about what tomorrow holds
[22:04] and it's almost like they're locked into
[22:05] am and god's got the bride tuned into fm
[22:08] over these years we may think we're a
[22:10] part of the slowest movement on the face
[22:12] of the earth
[22:13] you may be sitting there thinking well
[22:15] you know really nothing happens i
[22:17] remember brother brandon i'm talking to
[22:18] brother matson bozey in chicago and
[22:21] brother manhattan loved him and loved to
[22:23] go to that church there and he said
[22:25] about uh one time in a conversation
[22:27] brother bran and i don't have it on this
[22:29] screen here but brother branham said in
[22:31] a conversation with him he said brother
[22:33] brother branham uh
[22:35] his brother jose was telling him he said
[22:37] i i prayed and i fasted for years that
[22:40] god would shake chicago that god would
[22:42] send a revival here and you know that
[22:45] god would do something he said we've
[22:46] longed for that we've thirsted for that
[22:48] and we pray that god would do that and
[22:50] he said i'm an old man now and he said i
[22:52] i just am so disheartened that it's
[22:54] never happened in our time brother
[22:56] branham said brother jose he said you're
[22:58] a great smart man you're a theologian
[23:00] and he said you're learned it in the
[23:02] word he said i could never touch you uh
[23:04] in terms of learning and scholarship but
[23:06] he said one thing about you he said you
[23:08] have terrible discernment that's what he
[23:10] said you have terrible discernment he
[23:12] said because a lot of people he says can
[23:14] be in the middle of something that god
[23:16] is doing and fail to recognize
[23:18] the the the actual uh power that god has
[23:22] exercised in a place and people are
[23:23] looking over the top of that they're
[23:25] looking for something great they're
[23:26] looking for something uh fantastic
[23:29] by their own expectations and he said
[23:31] brother jose
[23:33] god has already shaken chicago
[23:35] god has already shaken this place
[23:38] by sending a message in this last day
[23:40] and by sending a word in this last time
[23:43] brother branham says that again he says
[23:45] in 1964 you're familiar with this idea
[23:48] he says now we're building a building
[23:49] not a wall and the builders want to take
[23:51] a line of blocks and go straight down
[23:53] any builder can do that but it takes a
[23:55] real master mechanic or real master
[23:58] builder to turn the corner and when you
[24:00] get to the corner it shows whether
[24:02] you're really a stone mason or not when
[24:04] you can bring turn the corner and keep
[24:06] the continuity of the rest of the
[24:08] building
[24:10] so that's important not just to turn it
[24:12] but to turn it in continuity with the
[24:14] rest of the of the building or the
[24:16] blueprint and he said it's on those
[24:17] corners when troubles come the builders
[24:19] want to keep on building on down but
[24:21] we're not building a wall we're building
[24:23] a building
[24:26] it's a change
[24:27] it's a change that god brings
[24:31] it's a change that god mandates
[24:33] if you don't mind take your bible i
[24:35] don't have this in your
[24:37] on the screen either in genesis the
[24:39] sixth chapter this is familiar you you
[24:42] know the story of noah obviously but
[24:44] just to take a couple of words here in
[24:47] genesis chapter 6 and verse 4 there were
[24:49] giants in the earth in those days and
[24:51] also after that when the sons of
[24:53] daughters i i'm i'm reading genesis 6
[24:55] and 4 came into the daughters in unto
[24:58] the daughters of men they bear children
[24:59] to them and the same became mighty men
[25:01] which were of old men of renown
[25:04] and god saw the wickedness
[25:07] of man was great in the earth
[25:10] the word wickedness there is a is a
[25:13] powerful word in the hebrew it it means
[25:16] two things it means first of all
[25:18] arrogance they had an arrogance in that
[25:21] time and god saw the arrogance of the
[25:23] people
[25:24] the arrogance of people that will look
[25:26] in the face of god and look in the face
[25:28] of the history of the world it's only
[25:30] 2000 years old at this point but look in
[25:32] the face of it and say you know what it
[25:34] doesn't matter what god has said it
[25:36] doesn't matter what god requires it
[25:37] doesn't matter what god's conditions or
[25:39] god's standards are really it doesn't
[25:41] matter we're going to do our own thing
[25:43] and that attitude even carried over
[25:45] beyond the ark when nimrod said we're
[25:47] going to build a tower so that god won't
[25:50] be able to destroy us ever again right
[25:52] and there's an arrogance i mean in our
[25:54] world as an arrogance today there's lots
[25:56] of people that will shake their fist at
[25:57] god and say it doesn't matter there are
[25:59] people in the realms of government who
[26:00] will say hey the word of god has no
[26:02] place in the halls of government in our
[26:04] country
[26:06] this is a far cry from where we where we
[26:08] originated this is a a far cry from
[26:10] where we were but there's an arrogance
[26:12] in the hearts of the people and god
[26:14] identified that in genesis chapter 6
[26:17] prior to the flood we know that
[26:19] obviously as it was in the days of noah
[26:21] so will it be today that's the first
[26:23] part of that word wickedness the second
[26:24] part is from where we get our word
[26:27] related to cancer which is malignant
[26:31] now if you take the word malignant and
[26:32] divide it into two
[26:34] ignorant is the the root word for fire
[26:36] like we ignite a fire
[26:39] and a fire a malignant tumor in your
[26:41] body is the wrong kind of fire that's
[26:44] growing
[26:45] mal
[26:46] means it's like malware it's a malady it
[26:50] is something that is negative
[26:52] and when you have a negative fire
[26:54] burning in your body we say that
[26:55] somebody who has cancer has a malignant
[26:57] tumor it means that it's a fire out of
[26:59] control it's going to destroy that's
[27:01] what that means
[27:03] when god identified the problem in the
[27:05] days of noah he saw the wickedness of
[27:07] men was great they had an arrogance and
[27:11] unchecked that's going to grow to the
[27:13] place where they would engulf the whole
[27:15] world if possible and god would have to
[27:17] destroy it all
[27:19] that's the way god viewed the days of
[27:22] noah as it was in the days of noah it's
[27:24] no stretch to believe that that's
[27:26] exactly where we find ourselves today
[27:28] isn't that right
[27:29] that if left to themselves men would
[27:32] change every law everything that's
[27:34] decent they would confuse every young
[27:36] person is born about their gender they
[27:38] would change the you know the boundaries
[27:41] of morality they would crush everything
[27:43] that is holy and righteous if time went
[27:46] on long enough let me tell you but as it
[27:48] was in the days of noah god's going to
[27:50] shut it down god's going to judge it and
[27:52] take the righteous elect off the face of
[27:54] the earth and i'm glad i can say i'm one
[27:56] of them
[27:56] [Applause]
[28:00] can i give you just a little example
[28:01] here and i i don't want to belabor this
[28:03] point but let me just say give you a
[28:06] couple of things here that i wanted to
[28:07] share with you this morning
[28:09] uh in relation to this about where we've
[28:11] come to because this is also a
[28:12] transition or turning point that we've
[28:14] come to
[28:16] and i i i do this i have uh i have sons
[28:19] who are a lot smarter than i am and
[28:22] they're good researchers and and they
[28:23] sent me some material
[28:25] protestants no longer make up a majority
[28:27] of the u.s adult population that's quite
[28:29] a that's quite a turning point that's
[28:31] quite a place we've come to that that
[28:33] there's less than 50 percent of of
[28:35] adults in the united states
[28:37] who
[28:38] uh
[28:39] you know identify as christians or
[28:41] believe the bible
[28:42] and this this also is corresponding to
[28:47] the rise of nuns i mentioned nuns last
[28:50] night nuns are people who want to have
[28:52] no connection with the bible no
[28:54] connection with god no affiliation with
[28:56] the church no kind of a moral standard
[29:00] uh presented to them they don't want to
[29:02] they won't hear anything about it they
[29:03] are they have none no religion
[29:05] whatsoever
[29:07] and there is a corresponding rise of
[29:09] nuns with the decline of of christians
[29:13] and protestants in our world
[29:15] and they did this huge study in 2007 it
[29:18] was called a religious landscape study
[29:20] and they found that 51.3 percent in 2007
[29:24] identified as protestants that number is
[29:26] dropping
[29:27] so in every uh in every measure they
[29:30] find there are fewer christians in our
[29:32] country so therefore correspondingly our
[29:34] government's gonna change right if there
[29:36] are fewer
[29:37] people who respect the bible then
[29:39] obviously they're going to be fewer
[29:40] elected officials in the bible i'm just
[29:41] i'm just telling you how uh what i what
[29:44] i've noticed here and in the south those
[29:46] not affiliated with religion or nuns
[29:48] rose they're rising so it's not so much
[29:51] the bible belt anymore it's just a belt
[29:54] that's a we that's how we refer to it
[29:56] and lots and lots and lots of churches
[29:58] now are just becoming apartment
[29:59] complexes uh in the south
[30:03] it's it's constantly rising in the
[30:05] northeast it's climbed to 25 percent
[30:08] one-fourth of the population are
[30:09] considered nuns in the west nuns are
[30:12] larger than any religious group making
[30:15] up 28 to the public
[30:17] now watch non-religious americans have
[30:20] become increasingly organized since 2007
[30:23] forming political groups designed
[30:26] to keep religion out of public life
[30:29] so a nun is not just a description and
[30:31] none is a verb as well
[30:33] it means that we have an agenda we are
[30:36] not just going to opt out a religion
[30:38] we're going to make sure everybody else
[30:39] opts out of religion in the same way
[30:41] that france made it a contrary to the
[30:44] law uh this this week to homeschool
[30:46] in their country it's against the law
[30:48] now so there there's an agenda that's
[30:51] ongoing here uh there's a
[30:53] you know
[30:55] there's a
[30:56] fuel on the fire here
[30:58] that uh turns everything blue
[31:04] well why don't we stay on our feet and
[31:06] sing of course and we'll go home
[31:09] but
[31:10] by every state
[31:12] you can go down through every state and
[31:14] you see the systematic decline by state
[31:18] of the number of christians in every
[31:20] part of the nation now i didn't have
[31:23] that i couldn't blow this up properly
[31:25] but the title of this little graphic
[31:27] here
[31:28] is america's views of the moral
[31:30] acceptability of issues it's the
[31:33] view of americans in general the whole
[31:35] population
[31:37] of the moral acceptability of things in
[31:40] other words do you find this morally
[31:42] acceptable now or not
[31:44] and this is what it says
[31:47] i don't know where we've gone here
[31:49] but for instance the first thing on that
[31:51] the first thing on that list is uh birth
[31:54] control divorce and fornication
[31:57] and you can see the numbers here that
[31:59] people would think that it's morally
[32:02] acceptable
[32:04] to practice these things
[32:06] gay relations gambling children born out
[32:08] of wedlock assisted suicide that's
[32:10] physician-assisted suicide and abortion
[32:13] you can see that the majority of
[32:14] americans believe that that's morally
[32:16] acceptable
[32:19] wow
[32:22] that's really an incredible thing
[32:25] they also did a survey to try to find
[32:27] out
[32:28] what
[32:29] what source do teenagers rely on
[32:32] when it comes to common sense and moral
[32:35] guidance
[32:36] who are teenagers in the country turning
[32:38] to now to get guidance and you can see
[32:41] that down the list is religious teachers
[32:44] and
[32:45] religious leaders and religious
[32:46] teachings and so forth so
[32:48] a lot of young people today are
[32:50] depending on
[32:51] either
[32:52] parents family members or their
[32:54] practical experience and common sense
[32:58] uh i'm sorry but a 16 year old doesn't
[33:01] have a lot of common sense a matter of
[33:04] fact no offense i don't think they have
[33:06] any
[33:09] i said no offense so
[33:14] they also don't have a lot of practical
[33:16] experience
[33:18] i got a little more practical experience
[33:20] than my sons do
[33:23] just by virtue of age and exposure and
[33:26] you know pastors and ministers we have a
[33:28] little bit of a little bit of an insight
[33:30] into how things are and and let me tell
[33:33] you if if young people today are relying
[33:35] on their peers and they're relying on
[33:37] their own insight to figure out the
[33:40] moral standard that they should live by
[33:43] our nation is in trouble
[33:48] and
[33:50] that's contrary to scripture here's what
[33:52] the bible says come me children and
[33:55] hearken unto me and i will teach you
[33:57] it's not meant for you to figure it out
[33:59] yourself you are to be faithfully taught
[34:01] by somebody who is in the faith and is
[34:03] able to impart wisdom unto you the bible
[34:06] also says in proverbs 13 he that walketh
[34:08] with the wise shall be wise and if you
[34:10] want to be wise you hang around with
[34:11] smart people and not people your own age
[34:14] but you find a wise person and learn
[34:16] from them but a companion of fools in
[34:18] other words contemporaries
[34:20] contemporaries share their lack of
[34:22] experience and their lack of insight and
[34:25] a companion of fools shall be destroyed
[34:27] so god knew that 16 18 year olds would
[34:30] not really be able to make solid life
[34:32] decisions about what's acceptable and
[34:33] what's right like you know to know the
[34:35] dangers of gambling to say that most
[34:37] people believe that gambling is okay let
[34:39] me tell you gambling is a spirit it's
[34:41] caused by a spirit
[34:44] hello
[34:45] it's not a good thing
[34:47] and it can get a hold of somebody and it
[34:49] can destroy families and marriages and
[34:51] cause great loss in the lives of people
[34:53] it's not a good thing but there's a lot
[34:55] of people now that feel like in our in
[34:58] our country and in our culture hey that
[35:00] you know it's it's acceptable it's okay
[35:07] so you got a brother barry why are you
[35:09] talking about this and
[35:10] where's this coming from
[35:12] well they did a massive
[35:15] survey a little while ago with 4 500
[35:18] independent pastors and
[35:20] officials in churches and i asked them
[35:22] to define what the successful church is
[35:24] if you're wondering why the values and
[35:26] the morals of our nation are skewed you
[35:28] wonder why so many young people are
[35:30] messed up today and why we have the rise
[35:32] of nuns in our time
[35:34] and they asked these ministers currently
[35:37] how would you define a successful church
[35:39] what components are needed to have a
[35:42] successful church and they gave five top
[35:45] answers and here they are number one
[35:47] the amount of money you bring in is the
[35:50] number one indicator of how successful
[35:52] your church is number two the number of
[35:54] people in attendance well if that's your
[35:56] two top criteria and you're not going to
[35:58] say things that are going to offend
[36:00] people's lifestyle
[36:02] right you're not going to talk about
[36:03] trimming hair you're not going to talk
[36:04] about uh you know
[36:07] you know abstaining from things or
[36:09] you're not going to you're not going to
[36:10] offend the masses if the masses are are
[36:12] helping you to become numb the number
[36:14] one church in the state
[36:16] right you got to preach a generic
[36:18] feel-good gospel where everybody's you
[36:20] know feels user-friendly and uh you know
[36:22] leaves out feeling good and sung nice
[36:24] songs and kumbaya 50 times and we'll
[36:27] walk out and feel good about ourselves
[36:29] and now you know i'm glad i know jesus
[36:31] and all the rest of it right you're not
[36:33] gonna you're not gonna preach the gospel
[36:35] like brother branham preaches you're not
[36:36] gonna roll up your sleeves and lay it
[36:38] out and confront the spirit of the age
[36:42] and deal with the immorality of our time
[36:44] and deal with the consequences of sexual
[36:46] sin you're not going to you're not going
[36:48] to approach that uh in if if you need to
[36:51] have lots of people and lots of people
[36:53] bringing lots of money
[36:55] you're not going to do that
[36:57] matter of fact if you want to hold on to
[36:58] the people who are under 40 you got to
[37:00] do some entertaining
[37:02] you got to bring in the kind of music
[37:04] that they want and you got to find out
[37:05] what they want and and provide that
[37:08] instead of finding out what god wants
[37:09] and preaching the gospel and being
[37:11] instant in season and out of season it's
[37:13] a complete reversal of where we should
[37:14] be and you wonder why people are mixed
[37:16] up in our time you wonder why people
[37:18] don't know they've got the complete
[37:20] graph there that i just showed you
[37:21] upside down those things should be an
[37:23] abomination to our uh to our hearts in
[37:26] our nation here that's not about how our
[37:27] nation was founded that's not how we
[37:29] began that's not how we started out on a
[37:32] good moral foundation not at all
[37:35] but listen let's not just put it off to
[37:37] people out there in the world like
[37:38] brother branham didn't do it let's just
[37:40] say this that when stuff is around long
[37:43] enough it becomes normalized in
[37:46] everybody's eyes
[37:47] and there are things that you were
[37:49] offended with when they first came out
[37:51] but we watch it enough on our on our on
[37:53] our cable or whatever else our our
[37:55] netflix or whatever you know what we're
[37:58] not as grieved by it as we used to be
[38:00] and that's called a process of
[38:01] normalization it's become normalized in
[38:04] our time let's be honest folks and stop
[38:07] polishing your halo right there our
[38:09] children are exposed to all kinds of
[38:10] things that are immoral in their schools
[38:12] and you were grieved at it at the first
[38:14] but nobody said anything
[38:16] and now our kids become normalized well
[38:18] that's the way families are you know two
[38:19] dads and two moms and all the other
[38:21] things that are going on and there's no
[38:23] reapproach for divorce there's no
[38:24] reports for child reproach or
[38:26] childlessness there's none of that
[38:27] anymore and we as people we just kind of
[38:30] fall asleep because the supreme court
[38:31] said so
[38:33] well you know what that's not god's way
[38:35] that's not god's way when john the
[38:37] baptist rolled into town and herod was
[38:40] up to what he was up to john the baptist
[38:42] just didn't go to his own little corner
[38:43] and his own little group and preached to
[38:44] them he stood out in the in the
[38:46] marketplace and he said the woman you're
[38:48] living with now is not your lawful
[38:50] husband it cost him his head but he did
[38:52] not stop anyway he was a voice crying in
[38:55] the wilderness and i say the only voice
[38:57] for morality and reason today that's
[38:59] left is right here in this room the
[39:01] people who know better the people who
[39:03] understand the standards of god and the
[39:05] heart of god those are the people i'm
[39:07] preaching to this morning i don't
[39:08] believe we should just roll over and be
[39:10] passive i don't think you need to run
[39:11] for office i wouldn't advise you to do
[39:13] that but i'll tell you when you have an
[39:15] opportunity in the marketplace in which
[39:17] you operate i don't believe that it
[39:19] hurts for you to say i want you to know
[39:20] that i don't stand for that i stand for
[39:22] the things that are found in scripture
[39:25] i stand for the word of god and i'm not
[39:27] ashamed of it i'm not ashamed of the
[39:29] standards that god has raised in our
[39:31] time i'm not ashamed of backing down
[39:33] because god has said so in the world
[39:35] says something contrary that's the
[39:36] arrogance that we found back in the days
[39:39] before the flood and when god saw that
[39:41] there came a point where god says i
[39:43] cannot deal with that anymore i cannot
[39:45] reverse that i'm going to take the
[39:47] righteous and destroy the rest and we're
[39:49] living right at the same time and that's
[39:51] why i say i believe we're living on the
[39:52] cusp of a real reality change and
[39:55] there's a lot of people going to be
[39:56] looking to god to find an answer when
[39:59] the bride is gone
[40:01] because if i understand it right brother
[40:03] braham said there's lots of people in
[40:04] tribulation looking for a solution and
[40:06] saying wasn't there supposed to be a
[40:08] message come first
[40:10] and the world's been shaken and they
[40:12] missed it
[40:14] the third thing is the number of staff
[40:15] meetings the number four is square
[40:17] footage i mean you guys are up there on
[40:19] that one and then the number of programs
[40:21] offered
[40:22] those are the five things that churches
[40:25] use as a criteria or a measurement in
[40:27] terms of whether they're successful or
[40:29] not
[40:30] it's not anything about preaching the
[40:32] word and being in season or being
[40:34] sensitive to god or having access to god
[40:37] nothing like that these are the
[40:39] standards so therefore you're going to
[40:40] have your message tailored to be able to
[40:43] increase these numbers right here
[40:45] because it's all about measurement
[40:48] it's all about measurement
[40:50] but when it comes to the people of god
[40:52] it's not about measurement because it
[40:54] doesn't really matter how many people
[40:55] are here and it doesn't matter how new
[40:57] your carpet is it matters about the
[40:59] spiritual maturity and the spiritual
[41:01] growth of the people of god because god
[41:03] is preparing you for another kingdom not
[41:05] to live in this one this world's falling
[41:07] apart god's preparing you for another
[41:10] kingdom in another place so this carpet
[41:12] doesn't matter and the kind of car you
[41:14] drive doesn't matter and the amount of
[41:15] money you have in a bank really doesn't
[41:17] matter and how well you sing really
[41:19] doesn't matter i'll tell you what
[41:21] matters is that you're in tune with god
[41:23] and god has access to you
[41:26] that you have access to god and god has
[41:28] access to you it's a great thing for you
[41:30] to feel like you have access to god and
[41:32] you can pray to god and he hears you but
[41:34] i'll tell you what it's a more important
[41:36] thing that god has access to me that he
[41:38] can visit me anytime that he can change
[41:40] my body any time he can take me where he
[41:42] wants me to go anytime and it doesn't
[41:44] matter it doesn't matter what the world
[41:46] says what the world does enoch walked
[41:48] right through that time and was
[41:50] unscathed by that world and god took him
[41:52] for he was not
[41:55] hallelujah
[41:58] so i mentioned this last night and i
[42:00] don't want to dwell on it except to make
[42:02] a point
[42:03] this is an article about the equality
[42:05] act the equality act has changed quite a
[42:07] bit uh it's still lurking around uh
[42:10] different other bills that are going
[42:11] through uh the halls of congress right
[42:14] now but uh this was an article
[42:16] describing that but i wanted to this was
[42:18] this was actually in in the magazine
[42:20] christianity today which is the largest
[42:22] christian ministers magazine in the
[42:24] world and uh he was describing how that
[42:28] uh the the protestant evangelical
[42:30] community has wavered in their
[42:32] convictions about marriage and sexuality
[42:34] and you might as well say amen because
[42:35] we are looking at that wholesale
[42:38] even the methodist church
[42:40] and all the other groups out there that
[42:42] have wavered and said how do we hang on
[42:44] to the younger generation how do we be
[42:46] considered
[42:47] tolerant and how do we uh you know how
[42:49] do we be all inclusive and how do we get
[42:52] this younger generation in the church
[42:54] well the only way we're going to do that
[42:55] is to
[42:56] redefine the standards we're going to
[42:58] redefine uh what's right about uh
[43:00] same-sex relationships and so forth it's
[43:02] a bunch of malarkey it's a bunch of
[43:03] baloney but nonetheless this is what
[43:06] this person says so the pardon bold the
[43:08] headwinds against socially conservative
[43:10] positions that's us by the way
[43:13] if you're not clear that's us
[43:15] do you agree we have a socially
[43:16] conservative position
[43:19] we're really socially conservative if
[43:20] you haven't figured that out we're on
[43:23] we're on the on the you know the amish
[43:25] side almost
[43:29] the headwinds against
[43:32] us
[43:32] and people who take a socially
[43:34] conservative position
[43:36] i mean we really don't care what society
[43:39] says
[43:40] right
[43:42] in terms of the word of god our
[43:43] standards we don't care
[43:48] the headwinds against socially
[43:49] conservative positions on marriage and
[43:50] religious liberty are stronger than ever
[43:54] you can expect that they will get
[43:56] stronger
[43:57] all the time
[43:59] but now here's what the author wrote
[44:01] and this is an incredible statement i
[44:03] underlined it here he says where should
[44:05] today's evangelicals go from here
[44:08] this is the leading christian magazine
[44:10] in the world today and he's asking the
[44:13] question here
[44:14] where do we go from here
[44:16] can you imagine being a part of a
[44:18] mainline protestant denomination today
[44:21] and you feel like that your eternal
[44:23] destiny is based on what they believe
[44:25] and the leaders of that movement are
[44:27] saying well where do we go from here
[44:30] what do we do now
[44:33] all right you you don't you don't even
[44:34] know what i'm talking about because you
[44:36] know where you're going from here
[44:38] by god's grace we know where we're going
[44:40] we know where this is leading we know
[44:42] that there's only two destinies for the
[44:44] people of this earth right and one of
[44:46] them is the tribulation and the other
[44:48] one is the marriage supper and there's
[44:49] nothing in between
[44:51] we know where we're going but to be a
[44:53] part of a movement that that claims to
[44:55] be christian and protestant and bible
[44:57] believing and they're asking the
[44:59] question i'm not but they're asking the
[45:00] question where do we go from here in
[45:02] other words what do we do now the
[45:04] solutions we tried didn't work the
[45:06] changes we made did not work and
[45:08] everything about us seems to be falling
[45:10] apart my goodness where do we go from
[45:12] here
[45:13] and the government's hot on their heels
[45:16] changing laws squeezing them and
[45:18] squeezing them continually listen folks
[45:21] i'm not making this up this is the stuff
[45:22] that's happening this is the stuff
[45:24] that's going on right now there's a
[45:26] culture shift there has been a
[45:28] progressive culture shift in our time
[45:30] one of my sons sent me an article this
[45:32] morning and i didn't have time to put it
[45:34] on uh this right here but it was a very
[45:37] interesting article and i'll send it to
[45:38] brother paul so he can have it here but
[45:41] the article is in a mainstream media
[45:43] forum and it talks about why women are
[45:45] not having as many children as they used
[45:47] to
[45:48] and
[45:49] the article i i just kind of glanced at
[45:51] first and then i went back and looked at
[45:52] it closely and i just sent back one word
[45:55] to my son who sent me the article i just
[45:56] said wow because this is exactly what
[45:59] brother branham said would happen this
[46:01] is exactly what uh the mindset of the
[46:04] people would be here's here's a sentence
[46:06] or two out of that article this woman uh
[46:09] she's 35 years old now she's been
[46:10] married for four years and she's uh
[46:13] she's laying out her case as to why she
[46:15] doesn't have children all right and this
[46:18] is their choice and she says uh levy
[46:20] says that she and her husband have
[46:22] realized that they prefer their current
[46:24] lifestyle they own a condo and they are
[46:26] loving parents to their dog
[46:28] and though they both earn a comfortable
[46:31] living they'd rather spend their money
[46:33] on things that they love
[46:36] you know what that is that's a
[46:38] reflection of a mindset
[46:40] that is different
[46:44] than us
[46:49] can i go a little further
[46:52] hey
[46:53] they're out there
[46:54] asking the largest denomination
[46:56] protestant denomination in a nation is
[46:59] fracturing they're about to split
[47:01] and they're split over political issues
[47:05] i mean it's just incredible that they're
[47:07] so wound up on political issues and
[47:08] backing political candidates and
[47:10] political viewpoints that they've lost
[47:12] their way
[47:14] which is exactly what brother branham
[47:15] said would happen they would lose their
[47:16] way and they wander in darkness and
[47:18] without a vision the people perish how
[47:20] many believe that without a vision the
[47:22] people perish listen it's an
[47:23] understatement for me it's common your
[47:25] pastor says it all the time every
[47:27] minister says that how grateful we
[47:28] should be for the clear vision that god
[47:31] has given to us in the last day that
[47:32] lets us know exactly where we need to be
[47:34] and exactly where we're going you may
[47:36] feel like you're involved in the slowest
[47:38] process of in time but i'll tell you god
[47:40] knows exactly what he's given to you he
[47:42] knows exactly what you need he knows
[47:44] exactly what you need to hear he knows
[47:46] exactly your station in life he knows
[47:48] where to bring it to the next spot and
[47:50] he knows exactly how to prepare your
[47:51] heart for the change of your body and
[47:53] that's the thing you got to let god do
[47:55] it may not be apparent in the cosmos but
[47:58] i'll tell you in the hearts of god's
[47:59] people people who are hard after god
[48:01] they wait on god and they look to god
[48:03] and lord it may not be obvious or
[48:05] physical in my eyes it may not be
[48:07] something i can put my hand on but i
[48:08] believe by faith you're moving us closer
[48:10] to that kingdom and you've got to have
[48:12] that anchored in your heart you've got
[48:13] to believe that god is actually at work
[48:15] in the bride of christ
[48:17] whether getting the message out or you
[48:19] know bringing the last one in or however
[48:22] it works or god dealing with you about
[48:24] some of your issues and your complexes
[48:26] and your
[48:28] hey listen whether god's dealing with
[48:29] somebody in a village hot somewhere in
[48:31] africa or whether god's dealing in your
[48:33] inside of your car as you drive to work
[48:35] every morning god is still dealing with
[48:37] the hearts of his people
[48:39] and you've got to believe you're under
[48:40] his watchful eye
[48:43] so the world out there they might wonder
[48:44] what's next here's brother brandon
[48:46] telling us you know they're asking him
[48:47] well what's going to happen next and he
[48:48] says well the next thing is the rapture
[48:51] aren't you happy he says the next thing
[48:53] that happened is the gentile elected
[48:54] bride to be caught up with the rest of
[48:56] the gentile elected bride
[48:57] that's been down through the ages in the
[48:59] presence of christ in the heavens that
[49:01] means that
[49:02] one day god is moving us toward the
[49:04] place where our bodies will be changed
[49:06] we'll pick up brother john lafontaine
[49:07] and all the other people that have uh
[49:09] passed on a little bit ahead of us and
[49:11] we'll link arms together and we'll all
[49:13] enter into glory at the same time that's
[49:14] what's next for the people of god no
[49:16] question there no mystery there right
[49:19] right
[49:22] how long that's going to take between
[49:24] now and the change of our body i don't
[49:25] know
[49:26] and what's going to happen between now
[49:28] and that time that our bodies are
[49:30] changed i really don't know
[49:31] but that's up to god
[49:33] because he chose not to let us know the
[49:35] future day by day we get it one step at
[49:38] a time and i really believe that what
[49:39] god wants you to do is walk the rest of
[49:41] the journey rest of the distance by
[49:43] faith not by sight
[49:46] not by sight
[49:49] now
[49:54] i uh
[49:56] i just i just want to say this in the
[49:59] next little part here i just want to say
[50:01] this
[50:02] carefully
[50:04] and i just want you to hold with me here
[50:06] just for a moment here and say that
[50:09] we know that god
[50:12] he hides truth
[50:14] he hides things
[50:16] and he has done that all from the
[50:18] beginning of time
[50:19] there's certain things that he has said
[50:21] certain things that he's revealed
[50:23] we know for a fact that god
[50:26] does not hide things from us but he
[50:29] hides things for us
[50:32] there's a big big difference
[50:34] he hides things for us so that in a
[50:37] season
[50:38] they are revealed they are made known
[50:42] he hides things from the world right
[50:44] remember jesus prayed i thank you father
[50:46] that was hidden these things from the
[50:47] wise and prudent he hides things from
[50:49] the world from the unbeliever he hides
[50:51] things
[50:52] but he hides things for us
[50:55] that in season they become known
[50:59] to the people of god by revelation
[51:02] and when
[51:04] when
[51:05] god revives a
[51:06] promise when god revives something that
[51:09] pertains to a particular day he is
[51:11] really introducing or reintroducing to
[51:14] us
[51:15] a portion of the kingdom that we're
[51:17] moving into
[51:19] let me say it again when when god
[51:21] revives a promise we
[51:23] we know that uh
[51:25] we know that in in the days in the
[51:27] ministry of brother branham he had a
[51:29] gift of healing
[51:30] and we always knew that god was a healer
[51:32] because the bible said so but he came
[51:34] and demonstrated that he revived that if
[51:36] you like he he he made it live in a way
[51:39] that we had never thought was possible
[51:40] in our time right
[51:42] and and he's introducing something to us
[51:45] about the kingdom we're moving into
[51:47] he's introducing something to us because
[51:49] in that kingdom there's no sickness
[51:52] in that kingdom there's no death in that
[51:53] kingdom there's no cancer
[51:55] and no in that kingdom there's no
[51:56] malignancy on that side over there and
[51:59] so when god revives a promise to us over
[52:01] here he's actually introducing us to the
[52:04] way things are going to be in that
[52:05] kingdom over here
[52:07] now think about this that that in this
[52:09] message i believe that somehow or
[52:11] another in the mix god put rapturing
[52:13] faith do you believe that
[52:16] god put rapturing faith in this in this
[52:18] end time message that we have and i
[52:20] believe that he put that in there
[52:22] because that's what we're moving into
[52:24] we're moving into a cycle where our
[52:26] bodies are going to be changed and in
[52:28] order for that to happen god had to mix
[52:29] that into the word for our day just like
[52:31] he mixed a martyr's faith into the
[52:33] message that they got in the dark ages
[52:36] they didn't have a rapturing faith they
[52:38] had a martyr's faith and god mixed that
[52:40] in to the message they heard and the
[52:42] things that they believed so they could
[52:43] be they could endure they can move
[52:46] through that uh period and not
[52:47] compromise and not be overcome by fear
[52:50] and pain and all the other things that
[52:52] that existed in that time i was i stood
[52:54] my wife and i stood in downtown uh um
[52:59] not glasgow the other edinburgh in
[53:01] scotland and and we we stood in the
[53:03] place where they have a little tiny
[53:04] graveyard at the on one of the main
[53:06] streets there in in edinburgh and they
[53:10] they said that they told us stories of
[53:12] these martyrs who had died
[53:14] this is a place where john knox had
[53:16] lived and preached and it was amazing we
[53:18] stood there
[53:19] on the street where john knox's church
[53:21] was and his grave was actually paved
[53:24] over and used as a parking lot by the
[53:25] city because they had such disrespect
[53:28] for their uh founding fathers but on
[53:30] this tombstone they had little stories
[53:32] and testimonies of people that died in
[53:34] the martyr times because that history is
[53:37] recorded over there and they said that
[53:39] uh you know this is a spot where uh
[53:41] there were families and they would take
[53:43] uh the the roman church would take
[53:46] families and they would line them up on
[53:49] a beach
[53:50] and they would have them from the back
[53:52] of the church say up to here and they
[53:54] would put uh the oldest down here and
[53:57] they would stake them to the ground they
[53:58] would tie them with stakes to the ground
[54:00] back down there in the low tide
[54:03] and then they would line them up head to
[54:04] toe
[54:06] from the oldest to the babies on the on
[54:09] the shoreline
[54:10] and just let the tide come in gradually
[54:12] and drown them all
[54:14] and everyone behind would hear the
[54:16] screams of the ones who were drowning
[54:18] and dying being staked to the to the
[54:21] beach that was there and and the the
[54:23] whole idea was to get the younger
[54:25] generation to recant and to repent of
[54:28] their of their faith and their beliefs
[54:29] that they had let me tell you those
[54:31] people will be on the other side when
[54:33] you get there and you know sometimes our
[54:34] complaint is that you know hey
[54:36] somebody's sitting in my pew when i got
[54:37] to church
[54:41] it's almost it's almost laughable when
[54:43] you think about it and how we think well
[54:45] if the air conditioning goes out of my
[54:47] car you know what that's what that's
[54:48] tribulation for me
[54:50] but you think about what those people
[54:52] went through and they went through with
[54:53] a faith and a determination and
[54:56] something deep within them because god
[54:58] mixed that into the message that they
[55:00] heard because god was preparing them for
[55:02] what laid ahead
[55:03] and in our time i'm simply saying that
[55:05] now in our day god has mixed in
[55:07] rapturing faith because he's preparing
[55:09] us for the thing that lays ahead and the
[55:11] thing that lays ahead is simply the
[55:12] change of your body not the reformation
[55:14] of this world not the reformation of our
[55:16] government but the changing of your body
[55:18] because that's the only thing that god
[55:20] can do with this culture is destroy it
[55:22] and take the righteous out just like he
[55:24] did in the days of noah
[55:26] that's not popular that's not what
[55:27] everybody wants to hear but that's the
[55:29] turning point we've come to
[55:36] so god hides things for us
[55:41] and we inherit those things as we
[55:43] embrace the promises made real
[55:46] so in other words let me say it this way
[55:52] god says
[55:54] i'm going to give you a word
[55:57] and the word of god is not just
[56:00] statements it isn't just information
[56:05] it is not just
[56:07] a prospectus on what might happen
[56:10] or what will happen it's not just that
[56:12] it is all of that
[56:14] but it's not just that
[56:16] i believe that every true spoken word of
[56:20] god
[56:21] that comes from god
[56:22] has the power within itself to bring
[56:24] itself to pass
[56:28] i need you to think about this for a
[56:30] minute here
[56:31] if god said it
[56:33] even if it doesn't happen then
[56:35] that word has the power
[56:37] to bring itself to pass
[56:39] in god's season
[56:42] behold a virgin shall conceive he says
[56:44] it brother brahm said it just spun out
[56:46] there until it lodged in the womb of a
[56:48] certain virgin named mary and there
[56:51] can't become a certain time there had to
[56:53] come a certain season for that there had
[56:54] to come a certain hour but when that all
[56:56] those conditions were made right and and
[56:59] mary believed that word in other words
[57:01] it was it was uh watered it was
[57:03] fertilized by faith in that particular
[57:05] hour even though mary had never
[57:06] experienced that before but yet she
[57:08] believed somehow this was of god and
[57:10] when that happened because it was a true
[57:12] spoken word of god it came to pass and
[57:14] produce exactly what god had promised in
[57:17] the spoken word itself
[57:20] we read in jeremiah chapter 29 that god
[57:22] told the children of israel back then he
[57:24] said uh you know you will you will be
[57:27] here 70 years not three years as this
[57:29] joker says over here but you'll be here
[57:31] 70 years and in 70 years i will visit
[57:33] you and i will come and i will deliver
[57:35] you and bring you back we don't find
[57:36] anywhere after 70 years that god came
[57:38] down himself we don't see any place
[57:41] where god showed up on the scene himself
[57:43] and delivered the children of israel but
[57:44] you know what they got back because the
[57:46] word of god is capable of fulfilling
[57:49] itself every spoken word has the power
[57:50] within itself to bring the word of god
[57:52] to past as god said it because it is
[57:54] god's word god's word is not just
[57:56] history it's not just information it is
[57:59] a living word it is a power in itself to
[58:02] bring to pass exactly what god has said
[58:08] if that's true
[58:10] if that's true and god has made certain
[58:12] pronouncement pronouncements about our
[58:14] time hey listen don't let don't let the
[58:16] world or don't let what other people do
[58:19] define god for you
[58:22] because the world will the world would
[58:25] and other people will
[58:27] you know they'll react in different ways
[58:28] let me give you an example
[58:30] in luke chapter 10 you remember there
[58:31] were 10 lepers that came to jesus from
[58:33] afar off and they said jesus have mercy
[58:36] on us heal us
[58:37] and jesus does he speaks to them just by
[58:40] the spoken word from a distance all ten
[58:43] of them are healed
[58:45] we know in the rest of the story nine of
[58:47] them walk away
[58:49] one of them comes back
[58:51] and thanks jesus for the healing he
[58:54] received
[58:56] now if you look at that wrongly
[58:58] you could think wow that's not very good
[59:00] fruits of his ministry one out of ten
[59:03] but let's think about it this way
[59:05] the miracle was healing by the spoken
[59:08] word
[59:09] and he had 100 success in that
[59:13] but you don't want to let what other
[59:14] people do
[59:16] define god for you
[59:19] and by making sense
[59:22] we're all wired to react different ways
[59:25] but all of them were healed
[59:27] all of them went their way clean one of
[59:29] them came back and was thankful and it
[59:31] was i believe the right thing for them
[59:32] to do to come back and be thankful but
[59:34] the miracle the great thing and the
[59:36] power demonstrated was that there was no
[59:38] sickness that could stand before jesus
[59:40] there was no no illness that could stand
[59:42] there and he healed all 10 of them and
[59:44] they all walked away healed
[59:47] but if you let it sometimes if you
[59:49] listen if you don't have your eye fixed
[59:52] on the spiritual reality that exists
[59:55] that god has brought us into that god is
[59:57] moving us into if we don't have our
[59:59] hearts set on that you'll focus on an
[1:00:02] inferior reality which is the world
[1:00:04] around you
[1:00:06] the world around us is an inferior
[1:00:08] reality guess what it's going to pass
[1:00:10] away and right now it's falling apart
[1:00:12] it's crumbling and there's no amount of
[1:00:14] leadership and there's no amount of
[1:00:16] money and there's no amount of chinese
[1:00:18] investment that's going to keep the
[1:00:19] thing together it is falling apart how
[1:00:22] many of you would agree
[1:00:23] when we look at this it is an inferior
[1:00:25] reality compared to that one and god has
[1:00:28] given us a word that introduces that
[1:00:30] kingdom that we're moving into and that
[1:00:32] word shall not fail heavens and earth
[1:00:34] can pass away but my word shall never
[1:00:37] fail
[1:00:39] so when we come to the turning point and
[1:00:41] this is all i simply want to say took a
[1:00:43] while to get there
[1:00:47] we want to open our hearts to that world
[1:00:53] because if god truly meant
[1:00:57] what he said about our time
[1:00:59] and i believe that he did
[1:01:01] the word spoken about our time will come
[1:01:03] to pass
[1:01:05] it has the power within itself to make
[1:01:06] it come to pass
[1:01:08] and you need to make sure you don't fall
[1:01:09] into the trap of interpreting things
[1:01:11] ahead of time
[1:01:15] do you know what
[1:01:17] what we know is great what we don't know
[1:01:19] is also great
[1:01:22] you got to avoid the trap of
[1:01:24] interpreting things ahead of god
[1:01:26] your job is not to interpret god's word
[1:01:28] or to bring it to pass and if there are
[1:01:30] things we don't know which which that's
[1:01:32] very true there are things we don't know
[1:01:33] there are things we don't know that are
[1:01:34] coming that are that are prophesied
[1:01:36] scripture but we don't know how it's
[1:01:37] going to happen i mean we don't even
[1:01:38] know how to change our bodies right i
[1:01:40] don't even know how to lose five pounds
[1:01:41] i'm trying i don't even know
[1:01:44] it's hard there's a lot of things about
[1:01:45] this life that are mysteries that are
[1:01:46] hard
[1:01:48] and let me tell you there are things
[1:01:49] that
[1:01:50] what it's going to be like before our
[1:01:52] bodies are changed or how far up the
[1:01:53] road that is we really don't know but
[1:01:55] you know what i believe i believe
[1:01:58] that romans 8 is still true that all
[1:02:00] things work together for good and as
[1:02:02] long as we're here you know what i'm at
[1:02:04] rest because i know it's in god's hands
[1:02:06] he never let us slip from his hands
[1:02:09] he never put the steering wheel in our
[1:02:10] hands
[1:02:11] he's still in control he believed that
[1:02:13] god's still in control
[1:02:15] god still got god still he's still on
[1:02:17] the throne and i i believe that god's
[1:02:19] going to have his way i believe that his
[1:02:21] word is going to come to pass exactly as
[1:02:23] it said because the power to produce
[1:02:25] itself lays within it and that's why
[1:02:28] after 70 years those children of israel
[1:02:30] got out of the uh the the
[1:02:33] country of babylon they got out of that
[1:02:35] because god's word said that they would
[1:02:37] come back after 70 years and in season
[1:02:39] that's exactly what's going to happen
[1:02:42] nothing's going to stop it
[1:02:44] last scripture i want to give you if you
[1:02:45] don't mind just turn in your bible to
[1:02:47] exodus chapter 3 and you may not even
[1:02:49] need to turn to it because this is this
[1:02:51] is pretty uh common to us a matter of
[1:02:53] fact
[1:02:54] it's found right at the end of exodus
[1:02:56] chapter 2. this is the story of moses
[1:02:59] and how god meets moses
[1:03:02] moses in verse 21 of chapter
[1:03:05] exodus 2 21 and moses was content to
[1:03:08] dwell with the man and he gave moses
[1:03:10] zipporah his daughter so moses is in the
[1:03:12] wilderness here and he's going along for
[1:03:14] 40 years benny bear him a son and call
[1:03:16] his name gershom he said i've been a
[1:03:18] stranger in a strange land
[1:03:20] and it came to pass in the process of
[1:03:22] time that the king of egypt died and the
[1:03:24] children of israel sighed by reason of
[1:03:25] the bondage and they cried and their cry
[1:03:28] came up unto god by reason of the
[1:03:30] bondage
[1:03:31] i'm in exodus chapter 2 and reading
[1:03:33] verse 24 and god heard their groaning
[1:03:37] and god remembered his covenant with
[1:03:39] abraham and with isaac and with jacob
[1:03:43] if you're looking there watch this and
[1:03:44] god looked upon the children of israel
[1:03:46] and he had respect unto them
[1:03:50] god remembered his covenant i got to ask
[1:03:52] you a question did god forget
[1:03:55] does god forget like we humans forget
[1:03:58] no
[1:04:00] but god made a promise to abraham
[1:04:03] and he said to abraham your seed will
[1:04:05] sojourn in a land
[1:04:07] for a period of time
[1:04:09] he said they'll be down there
[1:04:11] he said but in in the appointed time
[1:04:14] i will come on the scene
[1:04:16] and we'll make sure that all of the
[1:04:18] children all the seed of abraham come
[1:04:19] back to the land that i gave abraham
[1:04:22] so it's not that god forgot but god had
[1:04:24] to leave it until everything was
[1:04:27] fulfilled in its season
[1:04:29] and the time was right
[1:04:32] we look at time running out that's true
[1:04:35] but god looks at how much time is
[1:04:37] actually left
[1:04:39] and that's a different perspective so
[1:04:41] god knows how far he can let this go
[1:04:43] god knows how far he can leave us here
[1:04:46] god knows let me tell you you wouldn't
[1:04:48] be here if it was unsuccess if it was
[1:04:50] possible for you to be overtaken by this
[1:04:53] age and uh there'd be no way up you you
[1:04:55] would not be still here if it was
[1:04:57] possible uh if it was impossible for you
[1:04:59] to be an overcomer in our time you
[1:05:01] wouldn't still be here because that
[1:05:02] would defeat god's purpose
[1:05:05] the re the fact that we are still here
[1:05:07] means that satan is actually defeated
[1:05:09] and he's he's still unable to overtake
[1:05:11] god's elect in this earth he's not
[1:05:13] unable to overtake those that are bought
[1:05:16] by the blood of christ the fact that
[1:05:18] you're still here means that satan does
[1:05:20] not have all the power he thinks he has
[1:05:23] and you're a living testimony you are a
[1:05:25] living representation of the fact that
[1:05:27] satan's not the powerful one in this
[1:05:29] world but that god is and it's christ in
[1:05:32] me that's the reason that we stand and
[1:05:33] that's the reason that we have victory
[1:05:35] and that's the reason why you still come
[1:05:37] time after time with all the things you
[1:05:39] people have been through and all the
[1:05:41] troubles you faced and you're still here
[1:05:44] it's because satan's not quite as
[1:05:45] powerful as what he thinks
[1:05:48] and so god made god looks at this a
[1:05:50] little differently than we do because we
[1:05:52] say hurry up hurry up hurry up and you
[1:05:54] know time's running out but god knows
[1:05:55] exactly how much time is left and so he
[1:05:58] looks at you and he says i got a little
[1:05:59] bit more work to do i got a little
[1:06:00] tweaking here to do and even with the
[1:06:02] young people i got a little bit of work
[1:06:04] to do and so i'm going to let it go a
[1:06:06] little bit longer a little bit until the
[1:06:07] uh the cup of the uh amorites is full
[1:06:10] the iniquity of the amorites is full
[1:06:13] and so god does not forget but god
[1:06:16] waits until the time is right but then
[1:06:19] it says then it says in in the passage
[1:06:21] that we read there in that last verse it
[1:06:23] says that god looked upon the children
[1:06:25] of israel and he had respect unto them
[1:06:27] that word respect there and i'm going to
[1:06:28] close with this but the word respect
[1:06:30] there is the word for
[1:06:32] intimacy
[1:06:34] it is the word for like adam knew his
[1:06:37] wife eve and they conceived and bore a
[1:06:39] son that's the same word the word
[1:06:41] respect here is the same word that was
[1:06:43] used in that case
[1:06:45] so in other words when god looked at the
[1:06:47] children of israel
[1:06:49] he looked at he looked at
[1:06:51] the
[1:06:52] the potential if you like he looked at
[1:06:54] the fact that i have more
[1:06:57] for this people
[1:06:59] i have something for them
[1:07:01] i have more for them than what they even
[1:07:04] would dream of i have something great in
[1:07:06] store for them
[1:07:08] just like adam uh you know he had uh he
[1:07:11] had you know a pleasure he had uh you
[1:07:14] know the means to bring forth a son uh
[1:07:17] when he knew eve his wife and so god is
[1:07:20] looking at the children of israel not in
[1:07:21] a natural sense now but in a spiritual
[1:07:23] sense he's he's looking and saying i i
[1:07:26] have i have respect for the children of
[1:07:28] israel i know they're suffering and i
[1:07:29] know what they're going through but i
[1:07:31] have great things in store for them i
[1:07:32] have something that's coming that they
[1:07:34] don't even know anything about they
[1:07:35] don't they don't know how they're going
[1:07:36] to get out of egypt they don't know how
[1:07:38] they're going to get back into promised
[1:07:39] land they don't know how i'm going to do
[1:07:41] it but i'm going to do it they don't
[1:07:42] know anything about manna they don't
[1:07:44] know anything about uh you know the
[1:07:46] parting of the red sea they don't know
[1:07:48] anything about the great exploits that i
[1:07:50] have that lays ahead but i have respect
[1:07:52] unto them i have something intimate for
[1:07:54] them and only them not anybody else but
[1:07:56] for them i have great things in store
[1:07:58] for them and as they walk in faith in
[1:08:01] the promise of the hour as god begins to
[1:08:03] release them from that land god pours
[1:08:05] out those things for them in their
[1:08:07] journey
[1:08:09] i believe it's no different than in our
[1:08:11] time i believe that god had great things
[1:08:13] in store for us in this last day and my
[1:08:16] expectation is is that no matter how far
[1:08:19] this journey takes us no matter how much
[1:08:21] longer we are walking in this journey i
[1:08:23] believe god's got great things in store
[1:08:24] for us i believe there's going to be
[1:08:26] somehow or another time is going to
[1:08:28] cease and the door is going to open and
[1:08:30] we're going to step into another
[1:08:31] dimension i believe there's going to be
[1:08:33] a body waiting over on the other side
[1:08:34] because the bible tells us that i
[1:08:36] believe that our loved ones are going to
[1:08:37] be on the other side i believe there's
[1:08:39] all kinds of great things in store for
[1:08:41] the bride of christ because we are the
[1:08:43] bride of christ and god respects the
[1:08:46] bride of christ he looks at her as his
[1:08:48] favored one that god is going to do
[1:08:50] great things for that the world knows
[1:08:51] nothing about don't think that you're in
[1:08:53] a process that god has forgotten about
[1:08:56] don't think that you're in a time when
[1:08:57] god is not aware of where you are and
[1:08:59] what you're going through i believe god
[1:09:01] has respect unto you and god has great
[1:09:03] things in store even if you can't see
[1:09:05] them and you can't even anticipate them
[1:09:07] i believe god has great things in store
[1:09:09] because your body as you know it is
[1:09:11] going to end one day and it will be
[1:09:12] changed in a moment in a twinkling of an
[1:09:14] eye and what god's going to do to get us
[1:09:16] there i really don't know but i have
[1:09:18] that expectation that god
[1:09:20] is going to bring it to pass
[1:09:22] let's stand on our feet let's stop there
[1:09:24] don't you worry about the conditions of
[1:09:26] our world don't you fear the conditions
[1:09:28] of our world and who's elected and what
[1:09:31] comes through our time let me tell you
[1:09:33] god god watches over his people very
[1:09:36] carefully
[1:09:37] god knew you where you needed to be god
[1:09:39] knew what kind of a pastor you needed to
[1:09:41] have god knew what kind of uh message we
[1:09:43] needed in the last day long before we
[1:09:45] prayed or knew anything about william
[1:09:47] branham god knew exactly what kind of
[1:09:49] message we'd need in the last day
[1:09:51] he was right wasn't he
[1:09:54] who knew god did
[1:09:56] he knew
[1:09:58] he knew even before jesus stood on the
[1:10:00] earth and he inspired malachi to write
[1:10:02] this and say before the coming of the
[1:10:04] great and dreadful day of the lord there
[1:10:06] will come an elijah that will turn the
[1:10:07] hearts of the children back and it's
[1:10:09] still happening in our time because god
[1:10:11] knew he could put within that message
[1:10:13] everything that we have need of and
[1:10:15] transfer from his kingdom to us what we
[1:10:18] need to have our bodies change
[1:10:20] that's what the spoken word is that's
[1:10:21] what the message is to me it is god
[1:10:24] transferring through the spoken word
[1:10:26] what we need of to get out of here
[1:10:29] it'll happen
[1:10:30] i believe it'll happen
[1:10:32] our expectations should be for nothing
[1:10:34] less
[1:10:35] our expectations should be uh you know
[1:10:38] for for exactly god to do what
[1:10:41] exactly god has said
[1:10:43] and that's where we find ourselves today
[1:10:46] jesus warns us in john chapter 13 he
[1:10:48] says you be careful about the cares of
[1:10:50] this world
[1:10:52] because he said they'll choke you
[1:10:54] there's a lot of people who are choked
[1:10:56] by fear today
[1:10:58] they are
[1:10:59] they are bound
[1:11:01] with fear they are consumed with
[1:11:04] criticism
[1:11:05] they'll criticize everybody
[1:11:07] they'll criticize the government
[1:11:09] they'll criticize
[1:11:11] everybody there's people criticizing
[1:11:13] people ahead to vaccine there's people
[1:11:14] who criticize them people who don't
[1:11:16] there's people who live to criticize
[1:11:18] your pastor because he makes a decision
[1:11:20] that's a tough place to be in when he
[1:11:22] makes a decision and he knows
[1:11:23] everybody's not going to like it
[1:11:25] i'm a pastor i know exactly what i'm
[1:11:27] talking about
[1:11:29] it is one of the most unenviable
[1:11:31] positions to be in
[1:11:34] at this particular point in this sense
[1:11:35] in this sense because we live in a world
[1:11:37] where everybody's got opinions and
[1:11:39] nobody's nobody's reluctant to get
[1:11:40] online and share those opinions and make
[1:11:42] them really big
[1:11:44] and spread them all over the place
[1:11:48] you know what at the end of the day it
[1:11:50] doesn't really matter
[1:11:54] it doesn't really matter what the world
[1:11:56] does what the world inflames what the
[1:11:59] world uh considers important
[1:12:02] it really doesn't matter what matters is
[1:12:04] what god says because that's the word
[1:12:06] that has power within it that's the word
[1:12:08] we want to embrace
[1:12:09] that's the word that we want to fall in
[1:12:11] love with
[1:12:16] we're at a turning point
[1:12:18] i don't think he needed me to come and
[1:12:19] tell you we're at a turning point but
[1:12:20] sometimes it's interesting to kind of
[1:12:22] dig down a little bit and realize that
[1:12:24] the world is turned in a direction
[1:12:25] they're not going to turn back from
[1:12:27] the churches
[1:12:28] are looking for answers as to where do
[1:12:30] we go from here what do we do now
[1:12:32] you want to go back and be a part of
[1:12:34] that
[1:12:35] i mean it's amazing that somebody would
[1:12:37] leave the light that we enjoy and go
[1:12:39] back to that
[1:12:41] and have the leaders themselves say
[1:12:42] where do we go from here
[1:12:44] they're without an absolute because
[1:12:45] they're trying different things and
[1:12:46] they're they're opening up their systems
[1:12:49] to all kinds of immorality and all the
[1:12:51] rest of it and i mean it's just amazing
[1:12:53] that somebody would want to go back and
[1:12:55] say
[1:12:55] i i'm so glad i'm a part of the people
[1:12:57] who don't know what they're doing
[1:13:00] i'm so glad i'm with you all you people
[1:13:01] you have no idea where
[1:13:03] we're going to go from here
[1:13:04] this is really great to be a part of you
[1:13:06] that sounds funny
[1:13:09] but i'm grateful for the direction that
[1:13:11] this word provides for us
[1:13:13] it's an understatement to say
[1:13:20] let's pray
[1:13:24] gracious heavenly father we
[1:13:27] count it lord
[1:13:30] a privilege and that would be an
[1:13:31] understatement lord to say that we are a
[1:13:33] privileged people
[1:13:35] but you placed a perfect word in our
[1:13:37] land and you said it's going to be a
[1:13:39] perfect word to create a perfect people
[1:13:42] to inherit a perfect world
[1:13:44] and even though in ourselves in our
[1:13:46] flesh we don't always feel perfect
[1:13:48] we don't always feel
[1:13:50] right
[1:13:52] in our humanness
[1:13:56] but lord we're thankful that
[1:13:58] our destiny is not based on how we feel
[1:14:02] our destiny is based on election
[1:14:06] so our prayer today lord is that you
[1:14:07] just draw us close that
[1:14:10] lord we would
[1:14:11] always have access to you but more
[1:14:14] importantly lord that you would have
[1:14:15] access to us
[1:14:18] you would be able to speak to us at any
[1:14:19] time
[1:14:20] you would be able to draw us close to
[1:14:22] your presence
[1:14:23] until the day when you draw us out of
[1:14:24] these bodies bring us into that kingdom
[1:14:28] we're depending on you
[1:14:30] we're depending on you lord for the next
[1:14:31] steps we're depending on you for each
[1:14:34] day
[1:14:35] and all that it holds
[1:14:37] we live in a world where now we know the
[1:14:39] world can change very quickly
[1:14:42] that there are forces in the world that
[1:14:44] exist to destroy
[1:14:46] and to kill
[1:14:49] and those forces have become evident
[1:14:52] father god we believe with all of our
[1:14:54] heart the greater is he that's in us
[1:14:57] than he that's in this world
[1:15:00] and we are encouraged
[1:15:02] we are encouraged lord to know that
[1:15:04] we're resting on that we're not resting
[1:15:06] on some man's solution
[1:15:08] i pray lord you would minister to this
[1:15:10] church may this church
[1:15:13] always be a place
[1:15:15] where people can come and experience the
[1:15:17] peace
[1:15:18] presence of god
[1:15:20] people can come and begin to walk in the
[1:15:22] light of this hour
[1:15:24] the lord you would anoint brother paul
[1:15:26] and sister rebecca and all that labor
[1:15:28] with them
[1:15:30] this place may always be a lighthouse
[1:15:33] it might be lord
[1:15:35] a place where you can lead your elect
[1:15:38] and prepare us
[1:15:39] [Music]
[1:15:40] father we ask now that you would just
[1:15:44] bless the balance of our day and all
[1:15:45] that we do lord may our may our lives be
[1:15:48] shaped by the gospel may our
[1:15:51] hearts lord be in tune with you
[1:15:54] lord that involves a pushback of the
[1:15:55] culture a culture which is becoming
[1:15:57] increasingly aggressive
[1:15:59] the lord may we have the courage and the
[1:16:01] strength to stand like noah did in the
[1:16:03] face of all opposition but he held to
[1:16:06] the message that you gave him
[1:16:08] in that day
[1:16:10] we love you lord
[1:16:12] and we thank you
[1:16:14] we ask lord that you would enrich us
[1:16:15] continually
[1:16:17] by your presence in jesus christ's
[1:16:19] lovely name
[1:16:20] for those who are sick and needy lord i
[1:16:22] pray that you would bring healing to
[1:16:24] their bodies
[1:16:25] those are the maybe that are searching
[1:16:27] and asking questions
[1:16:29] maybe they've debated even the existence
[1:16:31] of god
[1:16:33] lord you know
[1:16:34] the hearts of
[1:16:37] each one that's here in your presence
[1:16:39] lord i pray you would deal with that
[1:16:41] soften us lord i pray
[1:16:44] bring the bring the very thing that's
[1:16:46] needed we think of brother soriano lord
[1:16:48] brother jim babb laying in the hospital
[1:16:50] and different ones lord that are
[1:16:52] reaching out to you and families that
[1:16:53] are praying and we commit them to you
[1:16:56] we thank you lord jesus that we have you
[1:16:57] to turn to
[1:16:59] and give you all the praise and the
[1:17:00] glory and the honor in jesus christ
[1:17:02] lovely name
[1:17:05] amen
