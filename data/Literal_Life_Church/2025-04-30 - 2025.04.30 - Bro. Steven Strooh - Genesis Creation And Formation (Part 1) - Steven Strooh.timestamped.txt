[25:36] confess because I was going to just use
[25:40] my Bible tonight and surprise everybody
[25:42] instead of the PowerPoint. And at the
[25:45] last minute, my faith dropped.
[25:49] And I decided that I would uh go ahead
[25:54] and um uh just set up a couple of
[25:59] slides and

[27:24] Amen. All right. Um Genesis chapter 1.
[27:28] So, are we up? Not yet. Um let's just
[27:32] read um while we're um while we're uh
[27:35] waiting for the crew. And I'll tell you
[27:37] what we'll do. I think we'll just read
[27:39] the first three verses and then you can
[27:40] have your seat. So in the beginning,
[27:44] God, how many of you can quote this by
[27:46] the way from memory? Thank you, brother.
[27:49] How can anybody want to have a have a go
[27:52] at that? Um I love to be able to quote
[27:55] scripture. Um just you
[27:58] know I just tell you very briefly I met
[28:01] somebody um years and years ago who's a
[28:03] radio preacher from California and he
[28:05] came to minister in South Africa and uh
[28:08] he did three services for us. He never
[28:11] once opened his
[28:13] Bible and there was no powerpoints in
[28:15] those days and he was able to quote the
[28:18] most random scriptures um just off the
[28:21] top of his head and then he would go and
[28:23] then that would be Philippians 2:10 you
[28:26] know or something and I was and I asked
[28:28] him afterwards I said how did you do
[28:30] that and he said no he believes it's
[28:32] God's gift that he was able to read it
[28:35] and then um with very little study he
[28:38] was able to remember it and since he had
[28:39] read the Bible many times he was able to
[28:41] quote it, you know, just word for word.
[28:44] And I remember we had our Bibles and we
[28:46] were following along and he was he was
[28:49] right on the uh uh on the word uh word
[28:53] for word. It's just phenomenal. So, all
[28:56] right, back to uh Genesis chapter 1
[28:58] verse one. I can quote the first few
[29:00] verses, but um I'm not going to attempt
[29:03] that tonight. So Genesis 1 vers1 in the
[29:07] beginning God created the heavens and
[29:08] the earth and the earth was without form
[29:10] and void and darkness was upon the face
[29:13] of the deep and the spirit of God moved
[29:15] upon the face of the waters and God said
[29:19] let there be light and there was light.
[29:21] May the Lord just add his blessing to
[29:23] the reading of the word. You may have
[29:25] your
[29:26] seats. Okay. Oh, is this not working
[29:30] from
[29:31] here? Oh dear. Well, I was. Yeah. Oh, it
[29:34] seemed to be up. Um, let's just Is that
[29:38] Did it change? Yeah. No, we we're good.
[29:40] Thanks, brother. I No, I just did
[29:44] that. Oh, no, I
[29:46] didn't. All right. Well, we'll make
[29:48] work. No problem. Okay. So, what I want
[29:52] to do is uh this evening um if you'll
[29:55] have some patience with me,
[29:59] [Laughter]
[30:04] It's just apple juice, brother. Help
[30:16] yourself. Thank you, brother. I'll take
[30:18] it off
[30:21] there. Well, this is getting off to a
[30:24] really good start.
[30:29] So, whoever's editing the videos will
[30:31] know what to
[30:34] do. Oh goodness. Okay. So, where were
[30:39] we? And this microphone keeps cutting
[30:41] out, Sister Genie. I don't know if
[30:43] there's anything we can
[30:45] do. I don't mind. Well, but
[30:53] it it must be absolutely first of all,
[30:57] I've got all the scriptures marked, so
[30:59] we're
[31:03] good. Yeah, handheld's good. Yeah, no
[31:06] problem. As long as you hold
[31:11] it. All
[31:15] [Music]
[31:25] right. Having an adventurous evening
[31:28] this evening. Amen. But I like who
[31:31] whoever said it must be a good service
[31:33] because that's uh that's exactly right.
[31:36] I'm going to set my timer for whatever
[31:38] that's worth. Probably nothing.
[31:41] give it a try. All right, folks. So,
[31:44] what we're what I'm trying to do, and
[31:46] brother Paul has allowed me to have a
[31:49] second service if if we need it um in a
[31:52] couple of weeks. So, we're going to get
[31:55] started on the subject. If we could back
[31:57] up the slide one more, let me do it. I
[31:59] can I can run it from here. All right.
[32:02] So, what we're looking at is um Genesis
[32:05] chapter 1. And the reason, one of the
[32:07] reasons I'm doing it is that we did hear
[32:09] brother Steve Brass just casually
[32:11] mention, you know, a little bit about
[32:13] Genesis 1 and then went into um two and
[32:16] three and and then I think brother Paul,
[32:18] you know, made a mention of the fact
[32:20] that uh you know, Genesis 1 shows the
[32:23] creative power of God and and of course
[32:27] that power is now um uh our inheritance
[32:32] because we're made in the image of God.
[32:34] And so there's um a couple so many
[32:37] different thoughts about that and I just
[32:39] wanted to share this one quickly. Um you
[32:42] know uh brother Gideon's very kindly
[32:44] sings a song I like. I've got the power
[32:46] the the love of God in me. I've got his
[32:48] love his nature and his ability. But
[32:50] that's very important to to that we
[32:52] think about that that that is residing
[32:55] within us. Now there's something else
[32:56] that resides in the creative power. Sure
[32:58] we understand that. But there is
[33:00] something else and that's uh the idea
[33:04] that we can be others
[33:07] centered. So we know that God cares for
[33:10] us. That means he is he is other people
[33:15] centered. God is thinking of us. He sent
[33:17] his only begotten son. Right? So guess
[33:20] what resides within us is the ability to
[33:23] be others centered. And by the way, uh
[33:26] that's a that's a very important trait
[33:30] in an entrepreneur. So the reason
[33:32] somebody takes the risk and goes to all
[33:34] the expense of starting a business and
[33:36] all of those things is because they see
[33:39] a need and they want to feel that
[33:42] they've got a solution for that need.
[33:44] And so because they're others centered,
[33:47] they can uh make that step into into a
[33:51] business. So it's not just the creative
[33:55] power but that's of course you know the
[33:57] thing that we're talking about this
[33:58] morning evening. What I want to do is I
[34:02] want to look at some of the things that
[34:04] perhaps haven't been quite clear to us
[34:07] over the years. Um and the reason that
[34:10] I've actually gone this direction again
[34:12] is I was helping uh brother rep and the
[34:16] teachers at the school um to get a
[34:19] little bit of a better handle on the on
[34:21] the creation uh story if you if you like
[34:25] uh because the message has a quite a
[34:27] different um take on it than what you'll
[34:30] get for example um at AIG u answers in
[34:33] Genesis or the the Ark experience um
[34:36] because primarily because of the age of
[34:38] the earth. But there's another thing
[34:40] that um is also quite
[34:43] uh problematic, let's say, and that is
[34:46] uh this idea of uh the gap between
[34:49] Genesis 1 and 1 and Genesis 1:2, which
[34:52] we just read. Now, you may not have seen
[34:55] the gap, but there's a gap, right? So,
[34:58] Genesis 1:1, in the beginning, God
[35:00] created the heavens and the
[35:01] earth, and the earth was without form
[35:05] and void. And um a way of understanding
[35:08] that is that it was
[35:10] chaotic. Now would God really is that
[35:14] the way he does things? He he he starts
[35:16] off with chaos and then he figures it
[35:19] out as he goes along like oh I think I
[35:22] can figure this out if I adjust this and
[35:24] I adjust this. Maybe I'll get it to work
[35:27] eventually. It doesn't sound like God
[35:30] right. So the fact that it's chaos
[35:33] uh tells you that there must have been
[35:35] something that happened in between
[35:37] creating the heaven and the earth and
[35:41] the next verse and then there was
[35:44] chaos. Now you might say to yourself,
[35:47] well does it really
[35:48] matter? And what I may get to tonight is
[35:52] to show you how the pattern of Genesis
[35:57] 1, the first few verses up to verse,
[36:01] well, let's say the end of the third
[36:03] day, and how that relates to us. And
[36:05] brother Brandham says there's a direct
[36:06] correlation between the events of those
[36:09] first few days and what happens in our
[36:11] life. Now, there's a few things that
[36:13] need clarity here.
[36:16] One is that the word create is only used
[36:19] three times in Genesis chapter 1. It's
[36:22] used for the first uh creation in the
[36:25] beginning and then it's used again the
[36:28] next
[36:29] time for
[36:31] animals and then the third time for
[36:35] man. So all the other things that are
[36:38] happening in Genesis chapter 1 are not
[36:41] creative works. And if you think about
[36:44] it, there's one that comes to mind
[36:45] immediately, right? The seeds in in on
[36:49] day three that that spring into life, uh
[36:52] those uh those seeds weren't created.
[36:55] They just started to grow. And we'll
[36:57] look at all of that this evening. Let's
[36:59] see if I can make this work. Oh. All
[37:04] right. I think this is the button. All
[37:07] right. So, we read um the first few
[37:10] verses. I'm going to have to do both.
[37:11] That's going to be fun. All right. So,
[37:13] let's carry on then from verse four. So,
[37:16] verse three, God said, "Let there be
[37:18] light." And there was light. You know
[37:20] what I think I'm going to do? I think
[37:22] I'm going to um do this like we were
[37:24] doing it in in the scripture instead of
[37:26] reading all these slides and then going
[37:28] back. Uh I think I'm going to do that in
[37:31] interest of time. So, you'll notice in
[37:34] verse two it says, "And the spirit of
[37:35] God moved upon the face of the
[37:39] waters." There's some other things that
[37:41] we could talk about there. But here's
[37:43] the important thing. Nothing
[37:46] happened until God
[37:49] said, "So the spirit moved on the face
[37:52] of the waters." And you would say, "Oh,
[37:55] so the spirit must have must have done
[37:57] something." I mean, you know, we think
[37:59] of the spirit in our lives. I mean, the
[38:00] Holy Spirit moves in a service and and
[38:02] and and suddenly the drummers are going
[38:05] and hitting themselves outside the head
[38:07] with the drumsticks, you No, I mean
[38:08] they're getting all carried away in the
[38:10] service because the spirit is moving.
[38:12] So, we're used to thinking of an action
[38:15] associated with the spirit of God.
[38:17] Nothing wrong with that. But in this
[38:20] case, the spirit moves on the face of
[38:22] the waters and does
[38:24] nothing until God
[38:27] said until the spoken word goes out and
[38:31] then something happens. And I've got
[38:33] something else to add to that. So God
[38:35] said, "Let there be light." And there
[38:37] was light. So what was the
[38:40] interpretation of let there be light?
[38:42] What did that
[38:43] mean? Who interpreted
[38:46] that? God interpreted it by bringing it
[38:49] to pass. So when God speaks, he has the
[38:54] obligation to make it happen. Otherwise,
[38:57] he's speaking in vain. You understand? I
[39:00] mean, why would God say anything if he
[39:03] didn't intend it to happen? A virgin
[39:05] shall conceive. it it wouldn't make any
[39:08] sense for God to be, you know, making
[39:11] statements that have no intention of
[39:13] ever being
[39:15] manifested. And that's exactly how we
[39:18] believe um the the the whole concept of
[39:21] the godhead with the logos coming out
[39:23] and then uh Jesus being uh born uh on
[39:27] earth and the word becomes flesh and
[39:29] dwells among us. And so that's the
[39:31] manifestation of the spoken word. And
[39:34] here's the wonderful thing. So, we're
[39:37] manifestations of the spoken word. If
[39:40] Jesus was the word for his day, guess
[39:43] who the word for our day is? It has to
[39:46] be us because we were spoken in the
[39:50] scriptures. And therefore, we have to uh
[39:53] be willing, this is difficult to step
[39:56] into that revelation of the word that we
[40:00] must take it and appropriate it for
[40:02] ourselves and say, "God said it. I
[40:04] believe it that settles and those aren't
[40:05] just words. They can become just a
[40:08] slogan. Heaven forbid, but it means that
[40:12] we can actually step into that vision
[40:15] that God had in the in the back of his
[40:18] mind from the foundation of the world.
[40:20] Now, why am I talking about that in
[40:22] Genesis chapter 1? Because that's
[40:24] actually what it's all about.
[40:26] This is a story about creation, but
[40:29] there's another creation that God's much
[40:33] more interested in, and that's you and
[40:36] I. Now, I want you to think about this
[40:38] when we're going through this. This is
[40:40] talking about the earth, the big old
[40:44] planet that we live
[40:46] on. But guess what? Dust to dust, ashes
[40:51] to ashes, we're lumps of earth. We're
[40:54] just a little smaller, but we're no less
[40:57] significant in the mind of God. In fact,
[40:59] I would put it to you, we are more
[41:01] significant than this big old planet
[41:03] because guess what? He's going to rip it
[41:05] all apart. Put it back together again.
[41:08] All right? After sin has been
[41:09] annihilated. So, here's the thing. When
[41:13] we read this passage, we have to read
[41:17] it in the context of how God works with
[41:21] us.
[41:22] So, I'm going to jump ahead here again.
[41:24] In fact, I could probably close the
[41:26] computer because so off my slides. But
[41:29] here's the
[41:31] thing. The spirit of God moves on the
[41:34] waters. And what is the remember brother
[41:37] Paul mentioned this? What is the
[41:38] condition of the earth at that stage?
[41:42] Chaos. Now, I don't know what kind of
[41:44] life you had, but I think of the chaos I
[41:47] was raised in. You remember I talked
[41:48] about that last time. I mean just
[41:51] absolutely unbelievable until I got
[41:53] adopted by my new family. And then when
[41:55] brother Steve was talking on Sunday
[41:57] actually reminded me of something and I
[41:59] mentioned it to him. So my first father
[42:01] kind of gave up on us and sent me and my
[42:04] two brothers to an orphanage and uh then
[42:08] uh by God's grace I got adopted into a
[42:10] family and they heard the message and
[42:13] and that's that's how I'm here today. Uh
[42:16] but then my dad passed away. my adopted
[42:20] dad in when he was 51 years old. And I
[42:23] think about where I'm 15 years past that
[42:26] and he passed away when I was uh
[42:29] probably late teens, early early 20
[42:32] maybe 20, 21. And so I was thinking
[42:35] about what brother Steve was saying
[42:37] about that relationship with with the f
[42:39] with a father and that what he could
[42:41] have taught me. And I've often thought
[42:43] to myself if I could just pick up the
[42:45] phone and call my dad was a very wise
[42:48] guy and I not in the sense of Italians
[42:50] brother
[42:52] um but um he had tremendous wisdom and
[42:57] uh I would have so much appreciated his
[42:59] advice in in the years you know that I
[43:02] was I was growing up and raising a
[43:04] family and so forth and so I missed out
[43:06] on all that but um that's really
[43:10] interesting uh to hear brother Steve
[43:12] talk about that because it's it's true
[43:16] when my father my my my adopted father
[43:20] when he passed away something switched
[43:24] in me because I so much looked up to him
[43:27] and I was having a secondary experience
[43:30] with God via my father because I so
[43:35] admired him and he was such a good
[43:36] believer and and and so it was like I
[43:39] never had to step up. And then after he
[43:42] passed away, it was within the the next
[43:45] year that the Lord really got hold of my
[43:47] life. And and I've and it's it's it's
[43:50] been it's been amazing since then what
[43:53] God has been able to do uh in my life.
[43:56] And I'm not sure that would have
[43:57] happened if my dad had lived for another
[44:00] 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 years. You see what
[44:04] I'm saying? So this is very interesting.
[44:06] So how does God like in my case how does
[44:10] he become our
[44:11] father? It's because the spirit of God
[44:14] is going to move over that chaos that is
[44:17] our lives. And if you don't have a
[44:20] chaotic life then this service is not
[44:23] for
[44:24] you because it's it's predicated on
[44:28] chaos because whatever happened in verse
[44:31] one is gone. Now if you think about that
[44:34] in terms of us, verse one is our
[44:37] theophony. It's our existence in the
[44:40] mind of God. It's what God was doing in
[44:43] our in in our um uh
[44:47] preexistence. You remember Job, the
[44:50] morning star sang together, and the sons
[44:52] of God shouted for joy. Whenever that
[44:54] was taking
[44:55] place, all right, that's verse
[44:59] one. But now we're in verse two. So now
[45:03] this is coming right back to our home
[45:05] address. Now we can say all right I'm
[45:07] here.
[45:09] Chaos,
[45:11] darkness,
[45:13] emptiness. This is all about
[45:15] me. I'm I'm sure some of you think it's
[45:17] about you, but it's really it's about
[45:19] me. All right. And darkness is on the
[45:21] face of the
[45:23] deep. But then the spirit of God moves
[45:26] on the face of the waters. So how does
[45:28] God get our attention? How does he
[45:30] interact with us? How does he bring us
[45:32] to back to himself? It's by the Holy
[45:35] Spirit. That's how conviction happens.
[45:38] That's that's where that process starts
[45:41] that first Thessalonians talks about
[45:43] where it says um that uh we should
[45:47] um here we go quoting um but that it the
[45:51] the order in Thessalonians seems to be
[45:54] spirit uh soul body which m body soul
[45:59] spirit excuse me which makes people
[46:01] think that the soul is in the middle and
[46:04] we know it isn't. The soul's in the
[46:05] inside of the inside, but it looks like
[46:07] it's in the middle, you know, body on
[46:10] the outside, then the soul, then the
[46:11] spirit because it says body, soul,
[46:14] spirit. But that's not the way it is.
[46:16] That's the way it works.
[46:19] It starts in the
[46:21] spirit and then it goes to the soul
[46:25] where we accept what we've heard from
[46:27] the spirit. And that's when the spoken
[46:30] word is quickened or quickens within us.
[46:34] his seed. That's kind of odd because the
[46:37] seed and the word are the same, but it
[46:39] gets quickened and then it starts its
[46:42] outward journey. So now that soul's
[46:44] quickened and now the soul starts to
[46:47] bump into the spirit and say, "How about
[46:49] this? What about this idea? How about
[46:52] loving that person? How about forgiving
[46:54] that person?" And you're like, "Whoa,
[46:56] what are you talking about?" All right.
[46:57] And in our spirit realm, there's a this
[46:59] little battle going on. It's called the
[47:01] mind. But
[47:04] eventually, at least in my case, a
[47:07] little bit of it leaks through into the
[47:09] body and I start to act on those things
[47:12] that are being prompted from the Holy
[47:14] Spirit that is being prompted by the
[47:17] soul, by the word. Do you see the
[47:20] picture? So, the spirit's hovering over
[47:22] the waters. Then God
[47:26] says something must happen. God's word
[47:29] speaks. And isn't that a song? His word
[47:33] speaks, I think. Anyway, and so once we
[47:36] start reading the scripture and we start
[47:37] seeing ourselves in this word, this word
[47:40] starts to bring about what the Holy
[47:43] Spirit promised. And I love that that
[47:45] brother Steve talked about the the
[47:47] promise. And so here we go. So he said,
[47:51] "Let there be light." And there was
[47:53] light. And God saw the light that it was
[47:56] good. And God divided the light from the
[47:59] darkness. And God called the light day
[48:01] and the darkness he called
[48:03] night. And the evening and the morning
[48:05] were the first day. We'll get to that. I
[48:08] want you to notice I highlighted the
[48:09] word good. Is it readable for everybody?
[48:11] Big enough. Okay. Just not for me. Um so
[48:15] God saw that light that it was good.
[48:21] Now, if you if you have your Bibles, not
[48:25] tonight, but when you get home, little
[48:27] homework, you should go through and see
[48:30] where the word good appears in Genesis
[48:32] chapter 1. I learned something today. I
[48:35] know that's hard to believe. I actually
[48:38] learned something today. I learned that
[48:41] on the second day, God did not say it
[48:44] was
[48:45] good. Anybody else have that revelation?
[48:49] I hadn't I couldn't believe it because
[48:51] if you count the number of goods which
[48:53] I've done many times there seems to be
[48:55] the right
[48:56] number but unfortunately the third day
[48:59] has two goods or or it could even yeah
[49:02] the third day and so this is this is
[49:05] interesting because why is that
[49:07] important that the second day doesn't
[49:09] have the word
[49:10] good? So the light was good and it
[49:14] divided the light from the darkness. So,
[49:16] can you see in our own lives, even if
[49:18] you don't know the Hank Williams song, I
[49:21] saw the light. All right, that's what
[49:24] he's talking about. It was right. Our
[49:26] life was shrouded in darkness. And then
[49:29] when the Holy Spirit moved on our lives
[49:31] and we accepted the word that Jesus is
[49:34] my savior, I shall not be moved. I'm in
[49:38] the song thing tonight. And so that uh
[49:42] that experience that we have with him is
[49:46] exactly what's being described here, the
[49:49] light and the darkness. Now, if you're
[49:53] if you're if you're in that uh mode, and
[49:55] I pray that the Lord would just have us
[49:57] in that to bring scriptures to our
[49:59] remembrance, you you'll remember how
[50:01] many times we read about the separation
[50:04] of light and darkness, light and
[50:07] darkness, and the darkness comprehended
[50:09] it not from John chapter 1. Right? So,
[50:12] there's so many scriptures and I might
[50:14] even get to some. And then he called the
[50:16] light day and the darkness he called
[50:19] night. Uh, I haven't got time to go into
[50:22] that. There's some really interesting
[50:23] things there. Oh, this is not working.
[50:25] All right. Um, it's going to take some
[50:27] getting used to. So, let's keep reading.
[50:30] And God said, "Let the
[50:33] uh let there be a firmament in the midst
[50:37] of the waters, and let it divide the
[50:39] waters from the waters." So, we've seen
[50:41] this word divide twice already. Why is
[50:44] that?
[50:46] Because the first thing that happens
[50:47] when God gets hold of us is he starts to
[50:52] divide.
[50:54] He wants to
[50:56] separate. He wants to move us from this
[51:00] position that we've occupied our lives
[51:02] born in sin shaped in iniquity. And he
[51:05] wants to drive a wedge in between that
[51:08] and move us towards his will, his word,
[51:12] his way. And so the first step is to get
[51:15] rid of the darkness. The second step is
[51:19] to divide the waters from the waters.
[51:21] Now physically speaking, this is most
[51:23] likely ice that is under uh on the face
[51:27] of the earth and under those deep waters
[51:30] because the sunlight couldn't penetrate
[51:32] and so it's quite possibly an ice age as
[51:34] they say. Um but who knows? But
[51:37] nevertheless, he's dividing waters from
[51:40] the waters. And then it says from the
[51:43] waters which were above the firmament
[51:45] and the waters which were under the
[51:47] firmament. So if you're thinking about
[51:49] this, what he's creating is the
[51:52] atmosphere. So the first thing he does
[51:55] when he says let there be light, we'll
[51:56] look at this in some detail. He removes
[51:59] the
[52:01] darkness. Okay? That's how the light
[52:04] penetrates. He takes away the veil. Then
[52:08] the light strikes the earth and we go,
[52:12] "Oh, I'm a child of God." And we'll read
[52:15] later, "I'm a child of the
[52:17] light." Remember that scripture two
[52:20] twice that I know of. It says we're
[52:22] children of the light. I love that. And
[52:25] so here is the dividing process that's
[52:29] actually setting up the atmosphere.
[52:32] And verse uh 8, and God called their
[52:35] firmament heaven, and the evening and
[52:38] the morning were the second day. And did
[52:40] you notice the word good was missing? I
[52:44] kind of gave you a heads up. But it's
[52:47] not good yet. Why
[52:51] not? My
[52:53] opinion, and maybe Mr. Scoffield's as
[52:56] well, Dr. Scoffield I think he might
[52:58] mention is that the
[53:01] atmosphere is also inhabited by those
[53:05] other creatures that shall go
[53:07] unnamed or at the powers and
[53:09] principalities of the air. And so in
[53:13] this condition just at this stage in our
[53:17] lives guess who's
[53:19] active as we start to pull away from the
[53:22] things of our old life. I'll give you
[53:24] wonderful analogy I've used for hundred
[53:27] years. Um, when we're born, we get into
[53:30] a taxi and that taxi gets given a name,
[53:33] Steven. Well, in my case, it was null.
[53:36] But I changed that. I made it Steven.
[53:38] When they wanted to adopt me, I said,
[53:40] "No, no, I don't like null. I'm going to
[53:42] be Steven." Uh, with a V, by the way. I
[53:45] was four years old. So
[53:48] anyway, so you get a
[53:51] name and there you are
[53:54] proudly driving
[53:56] your car now. It's become yours. It's
[53:59] not just uh like another taxi. It's
[54:02] actually your taxi that you drive around
[54:04] in. Anybody remember their first driving
[54:07] experience knows what a proud moment
[54:09] that is. And so at some point we, you
[54:11] know, we get our accountability and we
[54:14] start to be in charge of our destiny.
[54:18] So, here we
[54:21] go. We see a couple of people along the
[54:24] roadside. I hope I don't take too long
[54:25] of this story. A few people along the
[54:28] roadside, hitchhikers that are looking
[54:30] for a ride. And these people look quite
[54:34] interesting. Uh they seem to have um
[54:37] some interesting personalities and so
[54:40] forth. And we say can have some company
[54:42] on the road. Hey, jump on in.
[54:46] And eventually the back seat is all
[54:48] crowded with all these demons that we've
[54:51] picked up along the road. And guess
[54:53] what? They're all yelling at us, me,
[54:57] where to go. Hey, there's a bar, there's
[55:00] a pub, there's a cigarette, there's
[55:01] whatever. My case,
[55:04] gambling. Anyway, and so we're like, oh,
[55:09] that sounds like a neat idea. Let me try
[55:11] that. And so here we are taking these
[55:16] detours. Now remember, God wants us to
[55:19] go to a certain
[55:21] destination. But these demons have other
[55:24] ideas and they're influencing us this
[55:27] way and
[55:28] that. We life gets rough after a while.
[55:31] Man, this is not working. This gambling
[55:34] habit of mine is just the pits. I am I
[55:39] am so embarrassed that I never even
[55:42] played cards when I was growing up and I
[55:44] suddenly got to university and suddenly
[55:45] I'm a card shock I
[55:49] thought. So I was more the the the shock
[55:52] food. So the thing
[55:54] is eventually we're getting fed up with
[55:57] this lifestyle by God's
[56:01] grace. And we see another person
[56:03] hitchhiking and he looks like just what
[56:06] I need, some calming influence. He looks
[56:09] so serene and so calm. And so we think,
[56:12] I want to stop and pick this guy up. So
[56:14] the Lord Jesus gets in our vehicle. He
[56:17] doesn't throw out all the demons. I hate
[56:19] to say it. the atmosphere. It's still
[56:22] the same atmosphere. It's just there's
[56:25] another
[56:26] influence in our
[56:30] vehicle and he's in the front seat and
[56:34] every now and then you'll hear some
[56:36] chirping from the back seat and he'll
[56:38] say, "No, Stephen, I want you to go to
[56:40] that church. I want you to do this. I
[56:42] want you to be kind. I want you to read
[56:44] your Bible. I want you to do these
[56:45] things."
[56:48] and he keeps giving me
[56:50] directions. He's like my little helper
[56:52] in the car. Can't get anywhere on my
[56:55] own. So, got to have somebody in the
[56:57] passenger seat telling me where to
[57:01] go. And so, I'm starting to follow his
[57:05] directions. Eventually, it doesn't take
[57:08] long before I think to myself, you know
[57:11] what? It would be a lot more efficient
[57:13] if I just handed the steering wheel over
[57:15] to him.
[57:17] otherwise known as the baptism of the
[57:19] Holy Spirit. And now he's driving and
[57:23] I'm the passenger. And guess what? When
[57:25] he starts driving, guess what happens to
[57:28] all the fellows in the back seat?
[57:30] They're like, "This is my stop. I'm
[57:32] getting out here. This is no, this isn't
[57:34] fun anymore. He's not doing anything we
[57:36] want him to do. So, we're going to we're
[57:38] just going to we're going to, you know,
[57:39] just exit right here." And so slowly but
[57:42] surely, those habits fall away and and
[57:45] we and we start to have a closer
[57:47] relationship with Christ. And and that's
[57:51] the that's the picture that's going on
[57:53] here with this separation in the
[57:56] firmament. Because as we serve the Lord,
[57:59] we start
[58:00] to separate have a division from those
[58:05] things that are not pleasing to him. All
[58:08] right. So we we're you're we're we're
[58:10] together. Then verse 9. Oh, sorry. Let's
[58:14] go to eight. And God called the
[58:16] firmament heaven, and the evening and
[58:17] the morning were the second day. And God
[58:20] said, "Let the waters under the heaven
[58:23] be gathered
[58:29] together into one place, and let the dry
[58:32] land appear." And it was
[58:35] so. And God called the dry land earth,
[58:37] and the gathering together of waters
[58:39] called he sees. And God
[58:40] said, I like
[58:43] it. He said, "This is
[58:45] good."
[58:47] Why? What does the dry land represent?
[58:50] Now, I don't have time to show you all
[58:52] the scriptures, but what does the dry
[58:54] land
[58:56] represent? Abraham's seed was like the
[58:59] sand of the
[59:01] seashore. That's one reference. We'll
[59:04] have another one later. So dry land
[59:07] would represent believers because we
[59:10] know from Revelation 17 that the seas
[59:13] represents the multitudes of people. So
[59:16] the multitudes of people obviously are
[59:18] not the ones that are doing it right.
[59:21] That's never been God's plan. So the the
[59:24] amount of uh dry land on Earth is about
[59:28] 30 33%.
[59:30] So a third of the earth's surface is dry
[59:34] land, 2/3 is water. So that tells you
[59:36] where we stand, right? We have we have
[59:39] our work cut out for us, right? But he
[59:42] said, "This is good because now the
[59:45] separation is continuing now." And and
[59:48] guess what? What does dry land represent
[59:50] compared to being on a
[59:53] boat? All right, firm foundation.
[59:58] So now we're able to stand for what we
[1:00:02] believe in. And God says, "This is
[1:00:05] good. This is really good. This this is
[1:00:08] what I was working towards." And we'll
[1:00:10] read that scripture in a minute. Verse
[1:00:12] 11. And God said, "Let the earth
[1:00:16] who who yeah, you and I, the little
[1:00:21] lumps of earth, remember I set this up.
[1:00:23] So the little lumps of earth, you and
[1:00:27] I, bring forth grass, and the herb
[1:00:30] yielding seed, and the fruit tree
[1:00:33] yielding fruit, whose seed is in
[1:00:36] itself after his kind, whose seed is in
[1:00:38] itself upon the earth, and it was
[1:00:44] so. So when you become a
[1:00:47] believer, that's not the end.
[1:00:51] Now you're actually have a job to do.
[1:00:54] Now you've got that seed and your job is
[1:00:59] to make sure that seed
[1:01:01] multiplies. And we may read that later,
[1:01:04] multiply and replenish. So right in
[1:01:07] different ways. So if we're thinking
[1:01:09] spiritually now, how do we multiply and
[1:01:12] replenish? Remember replenish means to
[1:01:15] like redeem. It's to bring it back to
[1:01:18] something that was there previously. So
[1:01:21] what's our job in this process is for us
[1:01:24] to be part of God's process of bringing
[1:01:27] back the
[1:01:29] lost. That we're co-working with Jesus
[1:01:33] who came to seek and to save that which
[1:01:36] is lost. And so we're actually stepping
[1:01:39] into that role now
[1:01:42] that we've seen the light. We've had
[1:01:45] some
[1:01:47] separation and now the light has struck
[1:01:50] that seed. So why were those
[1:01:52] intermediate days important? What
[1:01:55] happened the first day? The darkness was
[1:01:57] dispelled and the light of the sun that
[1:02:00] was already there. Remember from verse
[1:02:01] one, the heaven and the earth, the
[1:02:03] sunlight struck the earth.
[1:02:06] Then God starts to separate
[1:02:10] sanctification and he allows us to go
[1:02:14] through this process which isn't always
[1:02:17] good and then he gets to the point where
[1:02:19] he says now that seed has got the right
[1:02:23] atmosphere the right environment you
[1:02:25] remember atmosphere from Sunday it's now
[1:02:28] got the right atmosphere in which it can
[1:02:31] grow it has the ingredients for growth
[1:02:34] which is
[1:02:37] First of all, there has to be a
[1:02:40] seed. Then light has to strike the seed.
[1:02:45] Then there has to be dry land like a
[1:02:48] church in which those seeds can grow.
[1:02:52] And then life comes into that seed which
[1:02:55] is the baptism of the Holy Spirit. And
[1:02:57] what day is that? The third day.
[1:03:00] Justification, sanctification, baptism
[1:03:02] of the Holy Spirit. But we're not
[1:03:05] finished. And that may be for next time.
[1:03:08] So let's keep reading because I think
[1:03:10] there's some other scriptures that we
[1:03:11] should look at. And God said, "Let the
[1:03:13] earth bring forth grass, the herb
[1:03:14] yielding seed, the fruit tree, yielding
[1:03:16] fruit after his kind whose seed is in
[1:03:19] itself." So when we share the gospel,
[1:03:22] we're not just sharing words on a page.
[1:03:25] We're actually sharing a fruit that
[1:03:27] looks very attractive. You know, fruits
[1:03:29] look
[1:03:30] attractive. And the reason they look
[1:03:32] attractive is because there's a seed
[1:03:34] inside that when somebody takes the
[1:03:36] attractive fruit and they say, "Man, I
[1:03:40] want what you've got. I I admire your
[1:03:43] life. I I'm I've been watching you and
[1:03:45] your life is
[1:03:47] attractive." And guess what happens when
[1:03:49] they take the fruit? They get the seed.
[1:03:52] The seed is the word of God. And now it
[1:03:55] starts to multiply and starts to
[1:03:57] propagate. Right? So this is obviously
[1:03:59] exactly what we see in the book of acts
[1:04:02] and it was so right. So God interprets
[1:04:05] his word by bringing it to pass even
[1:04:08] here. All right this
[1:04:11] is I need another hand. So the earth
[1:04:15] brought forth grass and herb yielding
[1:04:17] seed after his kind and the tree
[1:04:19] yielding fruit whose seed was in itself
[1:04:21] after his kind. Haha. And God saw that
[1:04:25] it was good. Evening and the morning
[1:04:27] were the third
[1:04:29] day. You may be curious as I was
[1:04:33] once. Wasn't there a bad tree as
[1:04:38] well? Now, how can it all be good if
[1:04:42] there's a bad
[1:04:45] tree? Makes you think it might not be
[1:04:48] sort of an ordinary tree, right?
[1:04:52] So God saw that it was
[1:04:54] good. Verse 20 for verse 14. And God
[1:04:58] said, "Let there be lights in the
[1:05:00] firmament of the heaven to divide the
[1:05:01] day from the night. And let them be for
[1:05:03] signs and for seasons and for days and
[1:05:05] years. And let them be for lights in the
[1:05:07] firmament of the
[1:05:11] heaven, excuse me, to give light upon
[1:05:14] the earth." And it was so. And God made
[1:05:16] two great lights. The greater light to
[1:05:18] rule the day, the lesser light to rule
[1:05:20] the night. He made the stars also. And
[1:05:22] God set them in the firmament of the
[1:05:24] heaven to give light upon the earth and
[1:05:26] to rule over the day and over the night
[1:05:31] and to divide the light from the
[1:05:34] darkness. And God saw that it was good.
[1:05:37] So this theme doesn't stop because we
[1:05:40] have the baptism of the Holy
[1:05:42] Spirit. There's more divisions that need
[1:05:46] to happen. there's more separation from
[1:05:48] darkness that needs to take place. And
[1:05:51] that's why this is so important, this
[1:05:54] Genesis chapter 1 passage. Uh and
[1:05:57] then what does it say in verse
[1:06:01] 18 and to rule over the day and over the
[1:06:05] night and to divide the light from the
[1:06:07] darkness and God saw that it was good.
[1:06:11] So we chafe under the stresses of life
[1:06:16] and the pain and the difficulties and
[1:06:20] the circumstances and the you
[1:06:23] know failed expectations perhaps and the
[1:06:27] the things that we wish could have been
[1:06:30] different and but guess
[1:06:32] what? This is good in God's eyes. I'm
[1:06:38] with you. It doesn't always seem so
[1:06:39] good.
[1:06:40] But this is good because this is
[1:06:43] continuing his sanctification process.
[1:06:46] Now it's not the stage of sanctification
[1:06:49] but it's the continuing washing by the
[1:06:51] waters of the
[1:06:52] word which does never stops until the
[1:06:56] redemption of the body and the evening
[1:06:58] and the morning were the fourth day. So,
[1:07:01] I'm going to uh jump ahead uh or back if
[1:07:05] you like to go back to that um those
[1:07:09] first few words in in Genesis. And you
[1:07:12] may and you may notice um that there's
[1:07:15] some highlighted words. So, I will spend
[1:07:17] a few minutes. I got a couple of minutes
[1:07:19] left. Uh in the
[1:07:21] beginning. So, beginning um implies I
[1:07:25] wonder if you can if you can agree with
[1:07:27] me. Beginning implies
[1:07:32] something
[1:07:35] time because before this there was no
[1:07:38] time. It was just
[1:07:41] eternity. So this is in the
[1:07:45] beginning and this is now God initiating
[1:07:49] his entire plan out of his mind and
[1:07:54] bringing
[1:07:55] it to pass.
[1:07:58] And it was in the
[1:08:00] beginning. What happens
[1:08:06] next? God. See, this could take forever,
[1:08:12] right? So, what's so important about the
[1:08:15] word
[1:08:18] God? It's because the word is L or L. We
[1:08:22] know we sing that lovely song L.
[1:08:26] But here in this case it's
[1:08:29] elohim or as the Israelis would say
[1:08:32] elohim. Now there's something about
[1:08:35] Hebrew is if you add him to the end of a
[1:08:39] word it means
[1:08:41] plural. So the trinitarians love
[1:08:44] this because they go oh there we go
[1:08:47] three go three three in one elohim
[1:08:50] plural. The only trouble is if you read
[1:08:52] your Scoffield Bible and you read the
[1:08:54] Jewish commentators, it's not a plural
[1:08:57] word. It's a uni plural word. Anybody
[1:09:00] know an example of a uni plural
[1:09:03] word? One that's means one and many at
[1:09:07] the same
[1:09:08] time.
[1:09:10] Sheep. So, how do you know how many
[1:09:12] sheep I'm talking
[1:09:15] about? The sheep run. Shout it out. How
[1:09:18] many sheep is that? The sheep run. Many
[1:09:20] or one? H many. Thank you, Sister
[1:09:26] J. The sheep
[1:09:28] runs. How many sheep is that? It's just
[1:09:32] one sheep. So, you see how the word
[1:09:35] sheep doesn't mean you plural or
[1:09:39] singular until you look at the verb.
[1:09:44] So, the word for God is
[1:09:47] Elohim. The word for
[1:09:52] create is
[1:09:54] bar. So in the beginning, I'm not going
[1:09:57] to try and read all the Hebrew. Elohim
[1:10:00] bar, God created. And all the Jewish
[1:10:04] people go, the Lord our God, he is
[1:10:07] one because they know bar means that the
[1:10:13] noun in this case is singular, not
[1:10:16] plural.
[1:10:19] So what happens when we get down to let
[1:10:20] us create man in our image? Because now
[1:10:24] they love to jump from oh this Elohim
[1:10:26] means plural and here we see the plural
[1:10:28] us. Well, there's one problem with that
[1:10:31] and I won't go into too much detail
[1:10:32] because there's some scriptures we could
[1:10:33] look at. But if you've got three
[1:10:36] people creating in their image and only
[1:10:40] two pop
[1:10:42] out, that doesn't look like an image of
[1:10:45] three.
[1:10:48] But if it's one God and he's making the
[1:10:52] spirit of mankind, male and female, now
[1:10:56] it all makes sense because God also has
[1:10:59] feminine
[1:11:01] qualities which we could get into
[1:11:03] another time. So in the beginning time
[1:11:07] begins God
[1:11:09] Elohim the heaven and the earth. So it's
[1:11:12] all done. So when we talk about the days
[1:11:15] of
[1:11:16] creation, how many days did this take in
[1:11:19] verse
[1:11:22] one? But the Brennham says we don't
[1:11:27] know. No
[1:11:29] idea because this is a misnomer. I took
[1:11:33] a picture. I was going to put it in. I
[1:11:36] forgot. When you look at the creation
[1:11:38] story in children's books and and any
[1:11:41] any just about anywhere, especially if
[1:11:42] it's coming out of
[1:11:44] AIG, they always talk about the earth
[1:11:47] was created in six
[1:11:50] days. We're going to test that theory
[1:11:53] from scripture. But anyway, I'm sorry.
[1:11:55] So, we've gone through without form and
[1:11:57] void. So, we're kind of skipping along
[1:12:00] uh at least on my
[1:12:03] computer. We'll get there.
[1:12:09] There we go. Okay. So, I'll just uh zoom
[1:12:11] ahead here or whoever is running the
[1:12:14] slides can jump ahead to the
[1:12:18] quote. Obviously, this was designed to
[1:12:21] go as I was talking. So, apologies.
[1:12:26] Right. So, question and answers on
[1:12:28] Genesis. Brother Ram says, "And when he
[1:12:30] did create in verse one, and atom
[1:12:33] bursted, I love that. and the sun came
[1:12:36] into existence. So when brother
[1:12:38] Brandham's in 1953 is referring to the
[1:12:41] big bang that was not a very popular
[1:12:44] theory back in
[1:12:45] 1953. In fact was a very unpopular idea.
[1:12:49] All right. It was it was mocked by
[1:12:52] people like Sir Fred Hy. And that's
[1:12:54] where the phrase uh what do you call it
[1:12:57] um big bang came from is he goes oh you
[1:13:00] mean there was a big bang and it's very
[1:13:02] mocking. Unfortunately, it stuck. And
[1:13:05] yes, there was a big bang because in the
[1:13:07] beginning, God created heavens and
[1:13:10] earth. The whole lot. There was nothing
[1:13:12] and then there was everything. That's
[1:13:14] the way God works. She whirled for
[1:13:17] hundreds of millions of years, not six
[1:13:20] days, forming clinkers and burning and
[1:13:22] forming like it is
[1:13:25] today. So, it's very interesting. But
[1:13:28] here's the verse that always comes up in
[1:13:30] the last few minutes.
[1:13:33] For in six days the Lord, please read it
[1:13:37] carefully with me. For in six days the
[1:13:40] Lord created heaven and
[1:13:43] earth and the sea and all that in them
[1:13:46] is and rested the seventh day. Wherefore
[1:13:49] the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and
[1:13:51] hallowed it. Did I read that
[1:13:54] right? Thank you. He didn't create in
[1:13:58] six days.
[1:14:00] He made in six days. Now do you remember
[1:14:04] remember the title slide creation and
[1:14:06] formation. Do you remember brother Steve
[1:14:08] talking about the
[1:14:10] difference? So Adam was formed from the
[1:14:13] dust. He was created a spirit being but
[1:14:16] then his body was formed from the
[1:14:19] ground. The word is yatsa in the Hebrew
[1:14:23] and it's a completely different word
[1:14:25] from create. So let's look at uh
[1:14:27] Strongs. Um, you can sort of see that
[1:14:30] how Strongs defines the word
[1:14:34] made. And I'll just highlight a couple.
[1:14:37] Do, make, rot, deal, commit, offer,
[1:14:41] execute, keep, show, prepare, work, do
[1:14:44] so, perform, get, dress, make, maintain,
[1:14:47] and 154 other variations. Not one of
[1:14:51] them says
[1:14:54] create. So create means to make out of
[1:14:57] nothing.
[1:14:59] Exhilo is the Latin. Since we've got a
[1:15:02] conclave going on, we might as well get
[1:15:04] in the spirit of
[1:15:05] it. Have a few Latin phrases to throw
[1:15:09] out. So, you can see this word made is
[1:15:14] misinterpreted if you want the earth to
[1:15:17] be created in six days because it was
[1:15:20] created on day one. Not day one, before
[1:15:23] day one.
[1:15:25] And what was happening after that?
[1:15:28] That's the question. Now in Genesis
[1:15:31] chapter 2 verse4, we get another view of
[1:15:34] this. These are the generations. Notice
[1:15:37] the highlighted
[1:15:39] plural of the heavens. You remember in
[1:15:42] Genesis 1, it's heaven, the heavens, and
[1:15:45] of the earth. when they were created in
[1:15:49] the day that the Lord God made the earth
[1:15:53] and the
[1:15:54] heavens. So, the creation was heaven and
[1:15:59] earth as we understand it, except
[1:16:01] there's a little plural in there we
[1:16:02] won't get into now because I'm down to
[1:16:04] 37
[1:16:06] seconds. But you can notice that he
[1:16:09] says created in the day that the Lord
[1:16:13] God made earth and heavens. So what did
[1:16:17] he make earth and heaven? Remember the p
[1:16:20] the the the remember the order creates
[1:16:23] heaven and earth. All right. Then what
[1:16:26] happens next? Let the light strike the
[1:16:29] earth. So where's the focus? It's on the
[1:16:32] earth. The viewpoint in actual fact we
[1:16:35] read other scriptures is from the earth
[1:16:37] looking up and the clouds pull apart and
[1:16:40] here's the light shining through the
[1:16:42] light of the sun. And so he
[1:16:44] says made the earth and then he says the
[1:16:50] heavens. So what's the order in Genesis
[1:16:52] chapter one? He's doing stuff with the
[1:16:55] earth
[1:16:57] first. Then life comes into the seed
[1:17:01] when the earth's in a good place to
[1:17:03] produce life, you and
[1:17:05] I. And then something happens on the
[1:17:07] fourth day. And where are those objects
[1:17:11] located?
[1:17:14] heaven, the sun, moon, and stars. We'll
[1:17:18] get to that hopefully, Lord willing. I'm
[1:17:20] going to give myself a few extra seconds
[1:17:22] if that's not too Is that okay with you
[1:17:25] all? So, I was, and even if it isn't, I
[1:17:28] was talking to a person not long ago who
[1:17:31] was trying to discuss with me saying,
[1:17:33] "Aren't you ashamed to say that God
[1:17:36] created the heavens and the earth in six
[1:17:39] days?" Now notice he's not quoting it
[1:17:42] right. I said, "Well, that's what the
[1:17:45] Bible said." Brother Brandon's going to
[1:17:47] give him the rope. He's going to give
[1:17:49] him the benefit of the doubt. Not
[1:17:51] everyone's a Bible
[1:17:54] scholar. He said, "Well, we've got
[1:17:57] evidence and can prove that the world is
[1:18:00] millions of years old."
[1:18:03] And brother Michael was so gracious to
[1:18:05] make a little video for us to explain
[1:18:07] how that's how that's determined.
[1:18:11] Thanks, brother Michael
[1:18:13] again. So he says, "We've got
[1:18:16] evidence millions of years old." And I
[1:18:19] said, "That doesn't have anything to do
[1:18:21] with it." Genesis 1:1 says, "In the
[1:18:23] beginning, I'm going to get to something
[1:18:24] that maybe you haven't heard before. Uh,
[1:18:26] beginning God created the heaven and the
[1:18:29] earth." Period. That's all.
[1:18:31] Now the world was without form and void.
[1:18:33] And I said I
[1:18:36] believe every seed was laying right
[1:18:40] there from some other civilization or
[1:18:43] something. By the way, I've always
[1:18:45] focused on civilization and I kind of
[1:18:47] got mixed up there because I it could
[1:18:50] didn't
[1:18:50] compute. But he says or something. So
[1:18:53] I'm going to go with the or something.
[1:18:54] And as soon as the water lifted off and
[1:18:58] I've just put in a note that is the
[1:19:00] water became water vapor and when you
[1:19:03] can see through water vapor it's
[1:19:05] invisible and the light struck up came
[1:19:09] the Oh, I'm so sorry. Is it Are are you
[1:19:12] guys following? Oh, the blessing. All
[1:19:14] right. So, as soon as the water lifted
[1:19:18] off, it becomes water vapor and the
[1:19:21] light shines through that water vapor.
[1:19:23] up came the trees and everything. And
[1:19:26] the same thing with a human being as a
[1:19:29] type. Now, Brother Brennham has a bit of
[1:19:31] a word salad here, which you'll have to
[1:19:34] forgive me because I couldn't I couldn't
[1:19:37] clean it up till it actually, you know,
[1:19:39] became readable. So, I wrote it. I
[1:19:41] rewrote it, but using his words. So when
[1:19:44] the mist clears that real seed is
[1:19:47] germinated by the light of the gospel
[1:19:50] that the revealed truth and it'll live
[1:19:53] when struck by a true vindication of the
[1:19:56] word. So brother Brennhams has now
[1:19:58] explained what I was trying to explain
[1:20:01] and took me 40
[1:20:04] minutes and he does it in one sentence
[1:20:06] which is pretty good. So we're going to
[1:20:08] go to the next slide.
[1:20:10] If it's got life in it, it'll believe.
[1:20:14] Outside of that, it can't live. It has
[1:20:16] no life in it. Those names that were put
[1:20:18] in the lamb's book of life before the
[1:20:19] foundation of the world will come forth
[1:20:21] just as certainly as anything. And
[1:20:23] that's why Jesus sits right there and
[1:20:27] waits with his mediatorial work until
[1:20:30] that last seed. And he'll know exactly
[1:20:33] when it strikes. So what is our role?
[1:20:38] How important is our role in this
[1:20:41] process? Jesus is
[1:20:44] waiting for something and it's for that
[1:20:48] last seed for this gospel of the kingdom
[1:20:50] will be preached to the ends of the
[1:20:51] earth. And then shall the end come by
[1:20:56] who? The other
[1:20:57] guy. Somebody else. Somebody else going
[1:21:01] to have the vision. But it's not. It's
[1:21:03] every one of us. Even your neighbor.
[1:21:06] even your child, even your coworker,
[1:21:09] even anybody that comes across your path
[1:21:13] where you have the opportunity to let
[1:21:16] them see the fruit that the Holy Spirit
[1:21:19] has developed in your life and they will
[1:21:23] take that fruit if they have that in
[1:21:26] them. Now, we're nearly
[1:21:29] done. So, I mentioned without form and
[1:21:31] void. So here's the picture as we
[1:21:34] close. The chaotic state is not the way
[1:21:37] God made it. That's what happened after
[1:21:41] that previous something where those
[1:21:44] seeds came from. And the spirit of God
[1:21:46] moved upon the face of the waters. So in
[1:21:50] Job 38, we read that when I made the
[1:21:53] cloud, he's he's questioning Job, where
[1:21:56] were you? the cloud, the garment
[1:21:58] thereof, the thick darkness, a swaddling
[1:22:01] band for it. Now, there's many
[1:22:03] scriptures that we could go into, but
[1:22:05] God made it. God allowed it. God wanted
[1:22:09] an example of what our lives are like
[1:22:12] when we're shrouded in
[1:22:14] unbelief. And we've got this beautiful
[1:22:17] word picture that we can go, "Oh, if I
[1:22:20] just let the Holy
[1:22:23] Spirit, convict
[1:22:26] me. God's going to speak and the clouds
[1:22:29] are going to roll back and light is
[1:22:31] going to strike that seed that's in me."
[1:22:34] Oh, now he says, "I believe every seed
[1:22:38] was laying right there from some other
[1:22:40] civilization or something. And as soon
[1:22:41] as the water lifted off and the light
[1:22:43] struck it, up come the trees and
[1:22:44] everything. So, how do you know the
[1:22:47] light
[1:22:48] struck? Oh my goodness, there's fruit.
[1:22:51] Where did that come from? I didn't have
[1:22:53] that fruit before. I wasn't able to turn
[1:22:55] the other cheek. I wasn't able to bless
[1:22:57] somebody who's cursing me. I wasn't able
[1:22:58] to pray for those who despitefully use
[1:23:01] you, use me, and say all manner of evil
[1:23:03] against me falsely for his name's sake.
[1:23:06] Wasn't able to do that. But suddenly,
[1:23:08] there it is. Fruit. All right. So, oh,
[1:23:12] you're following up
[1:23:17] there. That that picture is important,
[1:23:19] but we'll we'll see it again. All right.
[1:23:24] So, why does he talk about a previous
[1:23:28] civilization? Because we have physical
[1:23:30] evidence of it. There's geological
[1:23:33] features. Brother Michael, you agree?
[1:23:37] Brother Michael's a geologist.
[1:23:39] fossils. You've all seen fossils and
[1:23:42] their seeds. And brother Random says the
[1:23:44] seeds were from the previous
[1:23:46] civilization or whatever. And then we
[1:23:49] have the verse and you can look this up
[1:23:51] later on in this chapter, multiply and
[1:23:54] replenish. And then if you go to first
[1:23:56] second Peter, I think it's the earth
[1:23:58] that then was was covered in water. All
[1:24:03] right. Now, what does brother Brennham
[1:24:05] say about fossils?
[1:24:07] Some crushed rock was on the road in
[1:24:09] there with a there was a little fossil
[1:24:11] of some sea animal or something that
[1:24:13] lived many many years ago. I said, "Look
[1:24:15] at this thing here." And brother Cox
[1:24:17] said, "Brother Brennan, I wonder how old
[1:24:19] that really is." I'm going to shake
[1:24:20] Brother Cox's hand. It's the only
[1:24:23] reference to this anywhere in the
[1:24:25] message that I could find because
[1:24:27] Brother Cox asked the question. So, if
[1:24:29] you ever have the thought to ask a
[1:24:31] question, please ask the
[1:24:33] question. You never know what may be
[1:24:35] found. Oh, did you? Okay, it's
[1:24:38] following. So I said, 'Well, brother
[1:24:40] Cox, it's perhaps chronologists, people
[1:24:43] that, you know, look at the time of the
[1:24:45] earth would say up into the millions of
[1:24:48] years, way back before this earth was
[1:24:50] ever inhabited by human beings.
[1:24:55] So, one of the big problems with the gap
[1:24:59] theory as it's called, the gap between
[1:25:02] Genesis 1 and Gen 1 and Genesis 1 2 is
[1:25:06] how does death, all those dead animals
[1:25:10] occur on the
[1:25:12] earth before
[1:25:15] sin. It was a question I had for years
[1:25:18] and I only found this quote when I was
[1:25:20] doing the Bible doing the preparation
[1:25:22] for
[1:25:24] rap and I'm so pleased I
[1:25:27] did he because there were no
[1:25:31] humans. Now there were there was some
[1:25:34] something right there was even record of
[1:25:37] cities and whatever there was something
[1:25:39] but brother Random says they weren't
[1:25:42] humans which then makes perfect sense.
[1:25:44] So animals don't
[1:25:46] sin. Animals don't need
[1:25:49] repentance. Animals don't have a soul.
[1:25:52] So all of the things that we associate
[1:25:55] with the fall does not apply to animals
[1:25:58] directly. Animals are going to live and
[1:26:01] die because they're
[1:26:02] animals. And so he says those animals
[1:26:06] perhaps lived many many many millions of
[1:26:10] years
[1:26:11] ago. Isn't that wonderful? So now we I'm
[1:26:14] going to jump ahead. So then God said,
[1:26:16] "Let there be lights." And this is the
[1:26:18] picture.
[1:26:21] Sorry. Okay. And that's the the picture
[1:26:24] that Lan has where he he shows like the
[1:26:28] the the shroud, the swaddling band
[1:26:31] rolling back and light striking the
[1:26:34] earth. And where are those little lumps
[1:26:37] of earth? So this picture makes perfect
[1:26:39] sense.
[1:26:41] So when the light
[1:26:43] strikes, all right, we are now in a
[1:26:47] different era. We're no longer subject
[1:26:50] to the chaos. Now we allowing, we can
[1:26:54] allow ourselves to be subject to the
[1:26:57] word. And God said, "Let there be
[1:27:02] light." And that's what he had to do for
[1:27:05] us. He had to tell us, "Let there be
[1:27:08] light." Now I'm going to close I promise
[1:27:12] but maybe another 10 or so
[1:27:15] slides. So Isaiah 45:7 I form remember
[1:27:19] formation and creation I form the
[1:27:22] light and create
[1:27:26] darkness. When we have
[1:27:31] trouble it's
[1:27:35] allowed. I make peace and I create evil.
[1:27:39] Not sin. Evil. I the Lord do these
[1:27:41] things. What is what is the evil here?
[1:27:43] The word in the in the Hebrew is sorrow,
[1:27:46] adversity,
[1:27:47] calamities. So it's not sin, but it can
[1:27:49] sometimes be the fruit of sin. So you
[1:27:52] can see how forming the life. Oh yeah, I
[1:27:55] never finished that thought. I'm going
[1:27:56] to stop because I'm I'm kind of getting
[1:27:58] carried away.
[1:28:02] So when I talk about forming versus
[1:28:06] creating or making versus creating, what
[1:28:09] am I talking
[1:28:10] about? Creating is out of nothing.
[1:28:14] Forming is starting with something. So
[1:28:17] he starts with the dust. He forms man
[1:28:19] from the dust of the ground. But what
[1:28:22] about the firmament and moving things
[1:28:26] around? And by the way, when the waters
[1:28:28] and the dry land separates, what
[1:28:31] moved? The waters moved. It's not the
[1:28:34] dry land's job to push the water back.
[1:28:37] Gravity pulls the water away from the
[1:28:39] dry
[1:28:41] land. And that's a lovely comfort to us.
[1:28:44] Anyway, another another service
[1:28:46] sometime. But the the the thing that I'm
[1:28:49] trying to get to is all of this that he
[1:28:51] said in six days he made the earth and
[1:28:54] the heaven is he was ordering the
[1:28:58] creation. He was making it do something.
[1:29:02] And I wish I could find that verse for
[1:29:04] you
[1:29:06] tonight. Oh, maybe this is it. Hold on.
[1:29:10] Praise God. Uh let me uh advance here.
[1:29:14] It's also in Isaiah. A lot of these
[1:29:16] verses are actually in Isaiah. Oh, there
[1:29:17] it is. Let's read it together because
[1:29:20] then we're going to close. Isaiah 45:18.
[1:29:22] For thus saith the Lord that created the
[1:29:26] heavens, God himself that formed the
[1:29:32] earth and made
[1:29:34] it has established
[1:29:38] it. He created it not in vain.
[1:29:42] He formed it to be inhabited.
[1:29:47] That's what happened in the first
[1:29:51] chapter of Genesis. It created on day
[1:29:54] one. Then he has to create the animals
[1:29:57] and man. But in between, he's forming
[1:30:00] it. He's organizing it. He's ordering
[1:30:02] the creation. He's separating the
[1:30:04] waters. He's letting the dry land
[1:30:05] appear. He's giving light water and dry
[1:30:09] land to the plants. And they start to
[1:30:11] grow. And then he says he made the sun
[1:30:14] the greater light to rule the day and he
[1:30:16] made the lesser light to rule the night
[1:30:18] and he made the stars also and for signs
[1:30:21] and for seasons and days and
[1:30:23] years. Did he create the sun, the moon,
[1:30:27] the stars? If so, where did the light
[1:30:29] come from on day two or day one? Verse
[1:30:34] two and three. Big problem. It's because
[1:30:37] they were already there in verse one. So
[1:30:40] all he's doing is he's
[1:30:42] positioning the sun, moon, and
[1:30:45] stars. He's putting them where they can
[1:30:48] shine their light on the earth so that
[1:30:52] those who are interested can take their
[1:30:55] direction from our lives as long as
[1:30:58] we're in position.
[1:31:01] But if we get out of position and
[1:31:04] Orion's three stars suddenly start
[1:31:06] flying off and the southern cross
[1:31:09] becomes the northern cross and the great
[1:31:11] bear becomes the great wolf or know the
[1:31:13] great cheetah in South Africa
[1:31:16] everything's going to go
[1:31:18] ary but if we find our correct place our
[1:31:23] correct position and what's that called
[1:31:25] in the
[1:31:26] message
[1:31:28] adoption so justification
[1:31:30] sanctification, baptism of the Holy
[1:31:32] Spirit. The fourth day,
[1:31:35] he's placing, positioning each of us,
[1:31:39] himself included, the sun, the moon, and
[1:31:43] the stars to tell his
[1:31:46] story. You see how that worked? And what
[1:31:49] was it for? It was to be
[1:31:51] inhabited. So, it had to have all those
[1:31:54] steps in Genesis 1 in order to be
[1:31:58] habitable.
[1:32:01] And so for the Holy
[1:32:03] Spirit to find a habitation in our
[1:32:08] hearts, we need to go through these
[1:32:12] steps. And if we
[1:32:14] do, he will be able to direct our
[1:32:20] paths. Steps of the righteous are
[1:32:23] ordered of the
[1:32:24] Lord. Sons of God are led by the spirit
[1:32:26] of God. And now we find our position in
[1:32:30] the body. We find our position with
[1:32:34] him. And now we start to grow in
[1:32:38] maturity. And others can now benefit
[1:32:41] from our experience. Isn't that
[1:32:44] incredible? So that's what he means by
[1:32:47] made the earth and the heavens is to
[1:32:50] make them for his
[1:32:54] purpose. Does it make sense? I hope so.
[1:32:57] Well, God bless you. Let's stand.
[1:32:58] Musicians, you can
[1:33:00] come. Um, that includes you,
[1:33:12] brother. How many of us
[1:33:16] appreciate? Absolutely appreciate. God
[1:33:20] bless you.
[1:33:21] Take cause trouble.
[1:33:29] Grace of the Lord. Sing that. Amazing
[1:33:30] grace shall always
[1:33:35] be. Amazing
[1:33:38] grace
[1:33:41] shall be my song of praise.
[1:33:48] For it was
[1:33:53] grace that bought my
[1:33:59] liberties. Yes,
[1:34:01] Lord. Oh, I do not
[1:34:08] know just why he came to
[1:34:13] love me so.
[1:34:17] But he
[1:34:19] looked
[1:34:22] beyond my fault and
[1:34:27] saw my
[1:34:29] need. Amazing grace. Sing it again. Oh,
[1:34:34] amazing grace.
[1:34:37] [Music]
[1:34:38] It shall
[1:34:40] always
[1:34:42] be my song of
[1:34:46] praise. Oh, for it was
[1:34:53] grace that bought my liberty.
[1:35:03] I do not
[1:35:08] know just why he came to love me
[1:35:16] so. Oh, he looked
[1:35:20] [Music]
[1:35:23] beyond my
[1:35:25] faults and saw my
[1:35:29] need. Let it be your song.
[1:35:32] Oh, I shall
[1:35:39] forever lift mine eyes to
[1:35:47] Calary to you. The
[1:35:53] cross where
[1:35:55] Jesus died for me.
[1:36:01] How
[1:36:02] marvelous, how
[1:36:05] [Music]
[1:36:08] marvelous the grace that caught my
[1:36:14] falling
[1:36:17] soul. He looked
[1:36:23] beyond my faults and saw my need.
[1:36:30] [Music]
[1:36:32] Hallelujah. Just bow our heads before we
[1:36:35] grow. Dear heavenly father, thank you
[1:36:37] for Lord painting this beautiful picture

[1:36:55] Jesus, in you, Lord Jesus. There'd be
[1:36:58] nothing to stand in our way, Lord God.
