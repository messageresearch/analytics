it is oh nothing compares to this what a wonderful name the name of Jesus Acts chapter 4 and verse 32 and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul neither said any of them that ought of what things which he possessed was his own but they had all things common and with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and great grace was upon them all neither was any of them that lacked for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them and brought the prices of things that were sold and laid them down at the apostles feet and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need and Joseph who was by who by the apostles was surname Barnabas which is being interpreted the son of consolation a levite of the country of Cyprus having land sold it and brought the money and laid it at the apostles feet I want to emphasize verse 32 today as under my text and subject I want to emphasize that this is where the people of God were after the Redemption and the Holy Ghost had come this is the state of mind this is the state of heart is that they were of one heart and of one Soul this is what the Holy Ghost does if you go back to Acts 2 I'll go ahead and read this I'll refer to it later Acts 2 it says a lot of the same thing after writing Acts 2 after the Holy Ghost fell then he Peter directs the people and then it comes down and it says verse 41 Acts 2 41 then they gladly they that gladly received his word how many want to gladly receive his word today them that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day that was added unto them three thousand souls and they continued steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine and fellowship and in Breaking of bread and in prayers and fear Came Upon every soul and Many Wonders and signs were done by the apostles and all that believed were together and had all things common just a few weeks ago we were on a subject of uh relationships after the fall relationships after the fall and we were delving into after everything fell when mankind fell then we know that it wasn't just that they'd fallen in sin but everything in relationships began to fall number one their relationship with God was broken and their Oneness with God was broken and that was the worst tragedy but not just their their relationship with God was broken and became strained and there was a wall between them and God not only the relationship with God but also their relationship with one another in their marriage and from that point on relationships were broken because of the fall of sin and so we elaborated on that talked about the relationships that took place and some of the attributes of Fallen relationships and Fallen things when man is away from God and when man is broken from God and away from God then we realize then he can't be right he can't be what should be life is never correct life is never what it should be when we're not in relationship with God and so we elaborate on that but today I want to pick up the series again as I have just a little unfinished business to talk about because we don't want to leave man after the fall but we want to call talk about relationships after Redemption relationships after Redemption and we want to pick this up again today we we do have some things to look at what this was looking like of of the power of God in people's lives after Calvary after the resurrection and after they were filled with the Holy Ghost and that that we can praise the Lord this morning that the Oneness that was broken at Eden was completely redeemed and restored and begin to express itself after they begin to come out of the upper room everything that was lost in Eden was restored and they come out of that Upper Room with all the power laying within them that had been lost in the Garden of Eden can you say Amen tell you when we have life and when we have what they had in the book of Acts when we have Oneness I'm happy I love church order but Church order without life I don't want that that's getting something that's that's the cart before the horse you have to have the life of Pentecost the life of God the Oneness the relationship with the Lord first it has to be a relationship with the Lord I want the life of what happened in those people I want the Oneness can you say amen I want the relationship that they had with God I want the relationship that they had with one another after Redemption this is what it looks like and it starts right away in our text and says they are of one mind and one heart and brother Brown says that's the Oneness it was pure one mind and one heart and all of a sudden so I'm just going to start elaborating on these these attributes of what it looked like in in um in the days of the book of Acts we have the supernatural manifested we have the life of God in the people we had Oneness we had all those things happening but quite often the supernatural gets emphasized more than the Oneness and quite often I've heard preachers many times bring it down to where that's the full Vindication of the Bride if we have the supernatural working among us and we have prophecies and we have all this going on that's the Vindication that we're the bride and I just want to remind everybody that that's not the full Vindication of the Bride we should always have that God should always be dealing with us our young people need to see the power of God in the Supernatural God but it's not the final Vindication of we the bride because God can honor faith and they can have the supernatural happen out there you can't put God in a box I might lose some of you right here but I'm going to just plunge on ahead you cannot isolate that to being the only Vindication of the Bride it's part of it but it's not the final Vindication they have healings there they have prayer lines they have results because it's our God that does it and he honors faith and I want to remind us as well that before the Oneness of Pentecost came in the Holy Ghost Jesus had already given his disciples power without the Holy Ghost in their soul to pray for the sick and to cast out devils you did remember that right that they had that power to cast out Devils before they had the Holy Ghost but they had no power for Oneness they had Now power to come in Oneness with God they had no power to come in Oneness with one another there was nothing there they couldn't even become one with Christ I'll read a quote in a minute they couldn't even become completely one with Christ they couldn't get on the same page with them they didn't understand why he was leaving they didn't understand the word there was hardly any Revelation there can you say Amen but they could cast out Devils because we know when they came back they rejoiced that even the devils are subject to us without the Holy Ghost so don't make that the final Vindication of the Bride that this is the bride because she can cast out Devils because they were doing that before and you remember the other incident when they come back rejoicing he said don't Rejoice because the devils are subject to you don't just be shouting because devils are being cast out the reason for your worship should not only be prophecies and casting out the devil he said don't Rejoice because the devils are subject Rejoice because your names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life that's our worship here's another thing that that happened that said what they owned all of a sudden something huge changed with the Holy Ghost and with Oneness what they owned they did no longer say this is mine what's mine is mine and what's yours and yours yours is yours let me say it again what's mine is mine I own it what's yours is yours keep it separate leave me alone I have my life you have your life all that gets washed away now I might lose some of you I'm talking about what the book of Acts did in the church to bring Oneness and to bring relationship and it burned out this this isn't this is mine and these are divided this is my stuff that's your stuff and then we can fight over it and then even siblings can say but that's mine and we bring it to the court of mom and dad to settle whose it really is all comes from a fall in nature it speaks of children it speaks of immaturity so it speaks of immaturity say this is mine it speaks of immaturity that's in adults sometimes to act like children and say this is mine this is all mine so it's an attribute of children even if they're adults and I'm here to tell you the the change of the Holy Ghost and Redemption begin to change this is my thing this is mine and so now it's it's now that they begin to consider it common property in other words for the use of all I want to emphasize that this it's not just about property it's not just about what you own but it became common the word common is that you're and you remember as we elaborated on the fall in the beginning the first thing they did after the Falls begin to blame each other they begin to act alone as separate entities Eve began to act alone Adam began to act alone and they begin fighting for themselves to protect their their own selves and blame somebody else and become very selfish they never were that way before but the fall brought in selfishness the fall broke relationships and you cannot have you cannot have decent relationship with selfishness involved you can't have a right marriage with selfishness you got it in your mind this I'm marrying this person they're going to meet all my needs all the needs that I want they're gonna have she gonna do it just this way and you're just on the wrong track buster you know it's to lay down your lives to one another it's saying I'm entering this marriage how can I make their life better how can I meet their needs that's a Christian marriage amen because that came after Redemption and we will get into that what marriage looks like after Redemption we will get into that not today but they considered it common property for the use of all and and after the fall they were blaming one another standing alone in separate entities before they were one with one another Adam was saying this is bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh she's one with me if she does this I'm a part of her she's a part of me and it's all Oneness after the fall he's saying the woman did this you did it he's protecting himself it came from the fall it comes in our fallen nature and and blaming one another and then he comes to the woman and she blames The Serpent and and so but you see in this book of Acts church friends it was no more it's whatever is mine is theirs whatever happens to them happens to me if there's a need if there's a burden then I have a need and I have a burden if there's a a a a something that's happened to them then it's happened to me because I am one with them we are together in this we have all things common it wasn't just possessions but it was the Holy Spirit amongst the people that there was no big eyes or little use or better people or better dress people or rich or poor see that's the world we live in it's categories of people it's categories the rich the poor the preppies the the Uglies the good lookings it's it's separated us all none of that belongs in the body of Christ it's all things are common and we're all saved by grace they lost us whatever happens to them happens to me because this other person next next if they didn't have churches yet so the event in houses this pretty person sitting on the couch next to my next to me now I'm not trying to look them look at them in the chair and examine where they came from and put them in a category and they're sitting there in that chair and we're sitting there in the same house and and so they're no more were they looking back and said look at what he wears and look at where all this stuff and judging him by the outside I wonder where he comes from and then he starts to share and we prejudge them that was washed away friends washed away because they were together they had all things in common and if he has the Holy Spirit he's just as much a part of God as I'm a part of God I'm not above him because I'm the pastor this young man got baptized last year God has transforming his life I'm no better as a pastor I'm a brother in Christ to this man and he has the same inheritance on the other side as I have the same inheritance so so life our life is shared our possessions it strains that this is brought up uh they didn't view people as being rich and poor anymore whether they were or not it's kind of strange because you would think back in that time most the people were poor more likely they were but there were some rich people um different ones they were rich and it speaks here of of uh Barnabas probably being a richer man selling some of his lands to go to the needs of the people and so there were some rich but more likely it was a lot of it poor so whether or not they were poor or not possessions must have a way of putting people in categories of better or worse possessions can possess us and I read a quote a couple weeks ago or maybe it was last Sunday I'm starting to forget from Sunday to Sunday but you know he said you have a family come into the Lord and they're blessed and they're having family prayer together and they're excited they got life and I'm paraphrasing but he goes on there doing fine and then God gives them a little money God blesses their business and they get this and they get that they get a new car they get a new house they move up he gets a promotion and so all of a sudden if they're not careful now all of a sudden the family prayer goes the life of God goes Church goes everything gets to be laid aside and anybody could do it possessions have a way of possessing us maybe that's why they're mentioned in the book of Acts whether you have a lot of them or whether you don't have a lot of them when the Holy Ghost came to these people possessions were not the most important things so much so they said I'm going to let go of this because there's a need over here I'm going to sell this and I'm going to give the money to help this need that's when it's sacrificial giving possessions have a way of putting people in categories of Better or Worse levels of success we live in a world of levels of success and degrees and and and we measure a person based upon degrees or houses or lands or the kind of car they drive or success that they've been we measure People based upon their gifts that they have we measure people upon their better looks that they have and this is not based upon looks or gifts or successes it's all washed away can you say Amen so they let loose of relation they let loose of all relationships based upon status or position let loose of pride of selfishness they sold things sometimes you have to let go of something that you're holding on to so dearly they sold it maybe that's a good thing the Holy Ghost made them do that many times they just sold it got rid of it they're tied to something you ever seen somebody just so so obsessed and tied to something some possession that they have they're just that's it that's the ultimate that might be something you need to pray about and look at because you should never be that tied to something for status can you say Amen Supply someone else's needs sometimes so in conclusion in this part god purged the hearts in the book of Acts he purged the hearts of self-focused self-pride true and brought True Fellowship and love that could work amongst the people in relationships why because no one was better than the other they all had been promoted by the Holy Ghost they had all been promoted they had all received a promotion to Sons of Abraham can I get an amen they had all come into sons of Abraham and thus become spiritual millionaires they were all treated as the royalty of Heaven look at that acts 2. look what it says they continued steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine continued still this is this is a relationship with God after Redemption they continued steadfastly consistently staying around it continued step this is the relationship they have with God it wasn't a one-nighter it wasn't every week at church this is a daily continued steadfast in the word in the apostles Doctrine and why were they doing it because they had relations that they were connected with the Lord in their souls can you say amen and when you're connected with the Lord you're hungry I got to hear more of the word I want to know more of the word I want to stay in fellowship with the word and I want to be steadfast I want to be consistent I want to continually be doing it today we have no consistency in things people are in and out they're up and down they're in and out of this and that they can't stay committed to something they can't stay committed to jobs many times they can't be consistent and some people can be ever committed to their jobs to be there every morning on time but you're not consistent with the Lord in your relationship these people were so changed that they loved the Lord so much they continued steadfastly in a relationship with the Lord thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information please contact us by visiting our website literallife.com and if you would like
