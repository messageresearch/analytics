[0:12] this evening or say thank you brother
[0:13] Paul for having me to speak this evening
[0:15] God richly bless you we're going to turn
[0:18] in our scriptures to tonight to Exodus
[0:21] the third chapter
[0:24] and we're going to read verse 16 and 17
[0:27] together
[0:39] amen Exodus 3 16.
[0:44] go got go and gather the Elders of
[0:47] Israel together and say unto them the
[0:51] Lord God of your fathers the god of
[0:53] Abraham of Isaac and of Jacob
[0:57] appeared unto me saying I have surely
[0:59] visited you and seen that which is done
[1:03] to you in Egypt
[1:04] verse 17 says and I have said I will
[1:08] bring you up out of the afflictions of
[1:10] Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites
[1:13] and the Hittites and the amorites and
[1:16] the parasites and the hivites and the
[1:18] jebusites unto a land flowing with milk
[1:22] and honey let's bow our heads together
[1:23] Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful
[1:26] for this word Lord that we could read
[1:28] together Lord we thank you that it
[1:30] speaks to our hearts tonight father and
[1:33] we ask you to open it up into our hearts
[1:35] Lord that we could Minister this evening
[1:37] Lord Words of Life words of Peace Lord
[1:40] words of healing from this scripture
[1:42] Lord that it would be embedded into our
[1:45] hearts Lord take me aside tonight Lord
[1:48] let it be my mouthpiece only that's
[1:50] speaking for you father O Lord that I'd
[1:53] be a blessing to these people of yours
[1:55] we pray we love you and we thank you for
[1:58] this gathering tonight in the name of
[2:00] Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen you
[2:03] may take your seats tonight
[2:07] so we read here in the in the book of
[2:09] Exodus Israel was previously in bondage
[2:12] we understand that from the context and
[2:14] Moses has gone up up to the mountain to
[2:17] meet the Lord and he's met with the
[2:18] pillar of fire and here's the Lord
[2:21] speaking into him and he's telling him
[2:22] that he's going to bring out the
[2:24] children of Israel from Egypt and
[2:27] deliver them from their enemies and he
[2:29] lists them here in the scripture
[2:32] and so Israel had to find their position
[2:34] with God and it took some time for them
[2:36] to do that Moses brought them a promise
[2:39] when he left the mountain when he had
[2:41] communed with God and he went back into
[2:44] Israel and he found the children the
[2:46] Elders of the people and he went back
[2:48] with them with a promise telling them
[2:50] that they would come out of the of the
[2:53] Egypt and they would go into the
[2:54] Wilderness and soon they would come to a
[2:56] Promised Land which was called Canaan
[2:58] and that promised land was ahead of them
[3:00] as a promise unto what they could look
[3:02] to
[3:03] and so we understand that there there
[3:05] are three stages in our Christian walk
[3:07] to come into salvation we have
[3:10] justification we come through
[3:12] sanctification and then of course we
[3:14] have to be baptized by the Holy Spirit
[3:15] to come into our Arcanine
[3:18] and so Israel as a type of the church we
[3:21] want to look at this tonight and see
[3:22] that the children of Israel were found
[3:24] in the same three stages in Exodus that
[3:26] they had to come through
[3:28] brother Branham says in the adoption
[3:30] series number 11960 if you noticed
[3:32] Israel was brought up out of Egypt and
[3:35] there are three stages of their Journey
[3:37] one stage was leaving Egypt the next
[3:39] stage was the Wilderness and the third
[3:41] stage he said the next stage was Canaan
[3:44] one stage was leaving Egypt which types
[3:47] justification the second one was where
[3:49] they had exitedly
[3:51] Egypt and went into the Wilderness and
[3:54] they're going through a sanctifying
[3:55] process and the third stage was entering
[3:58] Canaan by and and we're going to type
[4:00] that as the Holy Spirit receiving the
[4:02] Holy Spirit
[4:04] so they've come into their promise of
[4:06] their day and they're walking towards
[4:07] their baptism of the Holy Spirit or into
[4:10] their promise which is Canaan land so
[4:12] we're going to look at the three stages
[4:13] this evening together and just see what
[4:15] the Lord could speak to our hearts
[4:17] the first they had to leave Egypt they
[4:19] had to get out of their routines they
[4:21] had to accept the fact that Moses had
[4:23] brought them uh Moses who was a son so
[4:27] to speak of the House of Egypt he had
[4:28] been grown up in in the lands as a as a
[4:31] as an Egyptian in the house of pharaoh
[4:33] and he had they had to come and accept
[4:35] the promise that he was delivering to
[4:38] them from God
[4:40] so they had to come out of it they had
[4:42] to come and leave their Comforts of this
[4:44] land they have so many Comforts in Egypt
[4:46] they were really relaxed they had gotten
[4:48] into routine although the the bondage
[4:51] was hard and the work was hard but they
[4:53] had certain Comfort levels that they
[4:54] maybe didn't even know yet that they
[4:56] that they had that they had lived in
[4:58] this lifestyle for so many years
[5:00] and so just the same we have to leave
[5:03] our Egypt we have to leave this a place
[5:05] of unbelief where we feel comfortable in
[5:07] our in our sin and many of us have
[5:09] already done this and we have we are
[5:11] called by the Lord and we have to accept
[5:13] this promise to leave our Egypt
[5:16] we realize what a horrible condition we
[5:19] were living in and we've realized what
[5:21] sin that we were in and and the place of
[5:23] of horribleness that the devil had
[5:26] tempted us or that we had been brought
[5:27] up in in our in our natural flesh
[5:30] and we had to come to a point where we
[5:33] could realize this horrible condition
[5:34] and we could repent and we could come
[5:37] and choose we had to make a choice just
[5:38] like the children of Israel had to
[5:40] choose and the elders had to choose to
[5:43] accept the word from the Lord from Moses
[5:45] we had to make a choice a conscious
[5:47] choice to live for Christ and to choose
[5:49] Christian Faith by the message of the
[5:52] hour
[5:54] the children of Israel realized this
[5:56] condition they were living in and they
[5:58] were oppressed they felt the oppression
[6:00] and when they came to that realization
[6:01] they accepted the promise that Moses
[6:04] brought them and and they chose to come
[6:06] and uh to leave Egypt and go into the
[6:08] Wilderness with Moses
[6:14] now when we all made that first decision
[6:16] decision to follow Christ
[6:17] it wasn't really always the easiest
[6:20] decision maybe we had to leave family we
[6:23] had to leave friends we had to leave
[6:24] things of the world behind but once we
[6:26] made that decision we knew that we were
[6:28] right on the right path
[6:29] I mean I in my own life as when I grew
[6:32] up in the message I was I was cutting
[6:34] bread from a message Pew but when I made
[6:36] that choice to to follow Christ and to
[6:38] have an experience with him that made
[6:40] the exact difference and what I I felt
[6:42] like I was going in the right direction
[6:43] and if you came from that place or if
[6:46] you came from a past of sinful living
[6:48] you knew exactly that you're in the
[6:50] right calling of the Lord when you when
[6:52] you made that choice for him and so when
[6:54] we made that decision life is amazing
[6:56] we're following God he's blessing us we
[6:59] feel the goodness raining out in the
[7:01] services and we're just pressing into
[7:02] the word and we're so strong but that
[7:05] first easy com that first step can
[7:07] become easier over time but then it
[7:09] becomes harder as as tests and Trials
[7:12] come upon us and the devil is tempting
[7:14] us as a child of God and he's throwing
[7:16] fiery darts and arrows trying to trip us
[7:19] up and get us down and have us fail so
[7:21] that we do not press on to our final
[7:23] destination
[7:25] and so as we've been now we've been
[7:27] we've left Egypt and we've come to this
[7:29] part where we're dying out to Christ and
[7:32] we've we've made this uh We've made this
[7:34] decision and we've made the recognition
[7:37] that we are in this this uh condition
[7:40] now we've we've passed through
[7:41] justification we've asked for repentance
[7:43] and now we've come into the second stage
[7:46] with the children of Israel have left
[7:48] Egypt and they've gone and they've
[7:50] passed the Red Sea where the Lord did
[7:52] the miracle there and now we're Into the
[7:55] Wilderness stage
[7:57] and so the second stage once we've we've
[8:00] left Egypt we found ourselves sometimes
[8:03] alone in the wilderness with Satan just
[8:06] like Jesus was there in the time of of
[8:08] the New Testament and we have to fight
[8:11] off the devil we have to overcome and
[8:14] the way that we can overcome is with the
[8:16] word with the Bible with the message of
[8:18] the hour
[8:19] and God provided in in the children of
[8:22] Israel in the Old Testament God provided
[8:24] a pillar of fire that led them day by
[8:27] day a pillar of fire and a cloud of
[8:30] smoke by night and the scriptures and
[8:33] and the message today can be likened
[8:35] unto that in which this is our guide the
[8:38] the word is our guide and it is by which
[8:40] we we follow and we which why we read
[8:43] and we take the promises to our hearts
[8:45] so that we can be anchored in the
[8:47] scriptures so that we can overcome the
[8:49] devil we can overcome Satan and his
[8:52] enemies
[8:53] we need to take the word and every every
[8:55] scripture every line and bury it into
[8:58] our hearts and put it inside deep
[9:00] concreted into our lives so that we can
[9:02] come when the Devil comes to Temp us we
[9:04] can do like Jesus said and say it is
[9:06] written it is written by the scripture
[9:08] Satan get behind me
[9:12] and the Wilderness got hard for the
[9:14] Israelites tomb they began to complain
[9:16] to Moses and they began to imagine two
[9:18] million people almost complaining to one
[9:19] man amen and and the Wilderness got hard
[9:23] and they were longing back for Egypt
[9:25] they were they were telling Moses we
[9:27] want to go back to Egypt back to the
[9:30] place where they had come and because
[9:32] the the temp the the the trials and the
[9:35] struggles were so difficult that they
[9:37] felt that they needed to go back they
[9:39] were longing for those that leaks and
[9:41] the garlic and the onions and the cool
[9:43] water that they once drank out of Egypt
[9:45] but when God called you out of your
[9:47] Egypt when he called me out of my Egypt
[9:49] there was no promise that it would
[9:51] really would be easy passed through our
[9:53] sanctification we're being asked to cut
[9:56] away things of the flesh were being
[9:58] asked to wash out ourselves we're being
[10:00] asked to die out to ourselves and and
[10:04] accept the promises of God and die out
[10:06] to him so that he could fill us up
[10:09] it's like brother Branham said he's it's
[10:11] not a picnic time we're living in but
[10:13] this is a battle it's a war it's not
[10:15] promised to be easy it's not promised to
[10:17] be relaxed time where we can just relax
[10:19] with our families but it's a war and we
[10:21] need to be have our guards up and we
[10:23] need to be watching out for what the
[10:25] devil could pull on us
[10:27] as they traveled and they wandered in
[10:29] the wilderness for 40 years they they
[10:31] were yet blessed by God
[10:33] when I remember the Lord is always
[10:35] blessing us through this time he's still
[10:37] with us he hasn't abandoned us he hasn't
[10:39] sent allowed Satan to tempt us and he
[10:42] hasn't allowed trials to come on us
[10:43] without being right next to us and right
[10:46] by our side and we see that in the in
[10:48] the story in the count with the children
[10:50] of Israel he was he was blessing them
[10:52] yet with a quail and with manna
[10:56] and brother Branham says in the
[10:57] Intervale 1956 there's three stages of
[11:01] the journey represented here today just
[11:03] the same and we're entering in the last
[11:06] stage of the journey God promised to
[11:08] supply everything physically that he had
[11:10] need of the the meat to go through there
[11:13] the Mana began to fall through Heaven
[11:15] which was a type of the holy spirit so
[11:18] we see in in our time now as you're
[11:20] going through this process of
[11:21] sanctification the holy spirit is still
[11:24] reigning with you he's still with you
[11:25] he's still your comforter he's still
[11:27] your guide and he's not left you but
[11:30] he's yet there blessing you as you are
[11:31] walking through these trials and these
[11:34] tests as he's accompanying you and so we
[11:37] know that the man is still falling the
[11:39] Holy Spirit still falling today he's
[11:42] still in the church today can you say
[11:43] amen and God Is providing for us he's
[11:46] never left us he's been so faithful time
[11:49] and time again and there is a true word
[11:51] still being poured out from pulpits from
[11:53] churches across message across the
[11:55] message world today day and across the
[11:57] United States and all over the world in
[12:00] Canada anywhere the Lord is still
[12:02] pouring out a storehouse of of message
[12:04] of word from Vindicated from the
[12:07] Vindicated prophet of the day and from
[12:08] our faithful pastors and Ministers of
[12:11] the Gospel I mean we've not been left
[12:13] here to fend for ourselves Without A
[12:15] word without the holy spirit to guide us
[12:17] to lead us
[12:18] so now as we've left our sin and we've
[12:21] come to be washed we're called in to
[12:23] live a Sanctified life and we're coming
[12:25] into sanctification and sanctification
[12:27] is that clean holy life before the Lord
[12:30] getting rid of the Customs that we once
[12:32] had like we already said and it's coming
[12:35] to the Lord and he wants to take it from
[12:38] you
[12:40] he wants to take all the things that you
[12:42] were once in he wants to he wants to
[12:43] better than you then you know he wants
[12:45] to take it from you and there's a way
[12:47] through and it's through the word
[12:49] Colossians 2 13
[12:52] and you being dead in your sin and the
[12:55] uncircumcision of your flesh hath he
[12:57] quickened together with him having
[12:59] forgiven you all the trust all
[13:01] trespasses blotting out the handwritten
[13:04] of ordinance that was against us which
[13:07] was contrary to us and it took out the
[13:10] way nailing it to the Cross verse 15 he
[13:13] says and having spoiled principalities
[13:16] and Powers he made us Sue of them openly
[13:19] triumphing over them in it so he's made
[13:23] a way through the word through through
[13:24] the crucifixion that that we could bring
[13:27] our sins that we could bring our faults
[13:29] to him and that he could nail them to
[13:31] the cross that he could take them from
[13:33] us and that is how the sanctification
[13:35] sanctification sanctificating process
[13:38] takes us is we can take our burdens we
[13:41] can take our sin we can take our past
[13:43] and nail it to the cross with the blood
[13:45] of Jesus Christ and it is all it is all
[13:48] passed over
[13:51] as we go into the third stage God let
[13:54] the children of Israel wander in the
[13:56] wilderness as he was teaching them and
[13:58] getting ready getting them ready and
[14:00] finally when they decided and the Lord
[14:03] leaded them LED them to to travel
[14:05] northward they came to a point in their
[14:08] Journey where they had to cross Jordan
[14:09] and this is outlined in in Joshua 4 in
[14:12] the scripture we won't go through it
[14:14] just to to keep going but in in the
[14:18] passage there there decide they're going
[14:20] to to travel up northward into Canaan
[14:23] into the promised land is where they're
[14:25] headed and so to get to Canaan they had
[14:27] to come across Jordan they had to cross
[14:29] Jordan and we know that Jordan
[14:31] represents death and then it's the cusp
[14:34] here of moving from the second stage of
[14:36] sanctification into the third stage now
[14:38] where we're receiving the baptism of the
[14:40] Holy Spirit or having receiving our
[14:42] promise in the Old Testament they were
[14:44] going to be receiving the promised land
[14:46] where they would there live but you in
[14:48] our day today we're going to we can have
[14:50] the ability to receive the Holy Spirit
[14:52] and have that the Lord come and live
[14:55] directly into our hearts
[14:57] and so you must come to Jordan you must
[14:59] come to the death death by the Watergate
[15:02] and water baptism as we understand in
[15:04] the name of Jesus Christ and we
[15:06] witnessed that here last Sunday it was
[15:08] so wonderful a young brother gave his
[15:09] life to the Lord and went through this
[15:12] channel of water baptism death to his
[15:15] flesh to receive the Holy Spirit
[15:17] and so when we die out to ourselves
[15:19] we've washed away all the sin and we've
[15:21] come through repentance and now we're
[15:23] ready to cross over Jordan This watery
[15:26] gate and receive the Holy Spirit
[15:28] 1947 experiences brother Branham says
[15:31] remember
[15:32] their leader Moses all the time was a
[15:35] type of Christ the spirit today
[15:37] is that right but Moses never took the
[15:39] people across Jordan there was a new
[15:41] order that came in was that right Moses
[15:44] took the the people across Jordan the
[15:46] church manager he called him
[15:48] and Joshua took the people across that's
[15:51] right and Friends great organizations is
[15:54] not going to take the church across
[15:55] Jordan now remember that Joshua coming
[15:58] on the scene see God is going to send
[16:01] this nine spiritual gifts to the church
[16:03] it's going to pull together and she'll
[16:05] Cross Jordan remember he said rise now
[16:08] and let's Cross Jordan he said to Joshua
[16:14] so we we learn here from what brother
[16:16] Branham speaking is that it's not going
[16:18] to be any church organization that's
[16:20] going to take us over into
[16:22] eternal life it's not going to be any of
[16:24] our friends or any of our our groups
[16:26] that we can we can rely on that's going
[16:28] to take us over into our promised land
[16:30] it's not going to be the pastor that can
[16:33] take you it's not going to be a
[16:34] spiritual leader in the church you
[16:35] attend it's not going to be your family
[16:37] your mom or your dad grandma or Grandpa
[16:40] there's nobody that can take you across
[16:42] Jordan except for Jesus Christ because
[16:44] the blood that was shed there on Calvary
[16:46] Jesus is Calling You to rise to cross
[16:49] your Jordan tonight and possess your
[16:51] inheritance by the blood of the Lamb
[16:55] 53 God talked to Moses now as Israel
[16:58] made her journey going to the promised
[17:00] land it had three stages he's just
[17:02] repeating that again
[17:04] and coming out of Egypt kadish barnia
[17:06] the Judgment Crossing into the promised
[17:09] land and that's just exactly three
[17:10] churches
[17:12] and After the Dark Ages the three
[17:14] churches then next the Philadelphian
[17:16] church then next to the laodicean church
[17:19] that's us today then she crossed over
[17:22] beautiful he says today as laodicean
[17:25] we're in stage three where we need to
[17:26] make sure that we are Crossing Jordan we
[17:29] need to make sure that we've made the
[17:30] commitment and that we've we've come
[17:32] through justification that we've been
[17:34] Sanctified that our lives are clean
[17:36] before him and that we're moving over
[17:38] and Crossing Jordan and that we're we're
[17:41] checking that we have the Holy Spirit
[17:42] living on the inside of our lives
[17:45] so the Church of the Bride of Jesus
[17:47] Christ was called up there and and will
[17:50] cross over the veil raptured and we are
[17:53] required to have the token this in
[17:54] filling of the Holy Spirit
[17:56] if you turn in your Bibles with me to
[17:58] Psalms 108 I'd like to read a Psalm
[18:01] David wrote giving praise to the Lord
[18:24] amen we'll read the whole we'll read the
[18:26] whole Psalm oh God my heart is fixed I
[18:28] will sing and give praise even with my
[18:31] glory awake Sultry and heart by awake
[18:33] myself early
[18:36] I will praise thee O Lord among the
[18:38] people and I will sing praises among
[18:40] thee among unto thee among the Nations
[18:43] for thy mercy is great above the heaven
[18:46] and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds
[18:48] be thou exalted o God above the heavens
[18:52] and thy Glory above all the Earth that
[18:54] thy beloved may be delivered saved with
[18:57] thy right hand and answer me God has

[19:23] will lead me into Edom wilt thou o God
[19:26] who has cast us off and will not thou o
[19:29] God go forth with our hosts giving us
[19:33] help from trouble for vain is the help
[19:35] of man through God we shall do valiantly
[19:38] for he it is that shall tread down our
[19:42] enemies so David is writing here and he
[19:45] he's saying I will praise you among the
[19:47] people I will praise you among the
[19:48] Nations and I believe that we can learn
[19:50] from David and he's always praising the
[19:53] Lord every time he's writing the Psalms
[19:56] and he's praising the Lord he's giving
[19:57] worship to the to the Lord and he's
[20:00] continually in song and in prayer and in
[20:03] meditation and in in today's time where
[20:06] we live and we live in such a secular
[20:07] world where nobody cares to worship God
[20:10] anymore
[20:11] people are ashamed to put themselves in
[20:13] a vulnerable position where they're
[20:15] surrendering themselves people I find
[20:17] sometimes don't want to lift their hands
[20:19] in church anymore because it feel
[20:21] awkward because they're having to
[20:22] surrender it's a sign of surrender to
[20:24] the Lord Jesus
[20:26] and instead of surrendering to the lord
[20:28] they're they're having the tendency to
[20:30] now put up Idols in their life and
[20:32] worship those Idols because it fits
[20:34] their flesh a little bit better it feels
[20:36] a little bit nicer there's no there's no
[20:38] awkwardness to them because they can do
[20:40] it privately uh in their own time or
[20:43] they can worship a sports star that
[20:45] everybody's famous to or they can look
[20:47] up to a music store or a movie star and
[20:50] people start even acting like that they
[20:52] start dressing like that they start
[20:54] talking and they the reason they do that
[20:57] is because they try to run to something
[20:59] that gives them self-gratification
[21:00] they're looking to something that can
[21:02] lift themselves up because they don't
[21:04] they don't feel adequate and rather when
[21:07] they come in and they worship these
[21:08] Idols these these material things are
[21:11] these other people really they're
[21:12] pushing themselves down in their spirit
[21:14] because it is not the way they were not
[21:16] made to worship idols but they were made
[21:19] to worship God
[21:20] brother Branham says God's way that in
[21:22] God's way that's been made for us 52 now
[21:25] I want you to watch God's way LED right
[21:28] up the gangplaint
[21:29] Gangplank I can see Shadrach Meshach and
[21:32] Abednego walking the Death March I can
[21:35] hear Shadrach say a Bendigo did you pray
[21:38] through yep all right then
[21:40] are you sure we're in God's way yes sir
[21:43] and God said in his word for us not down
[21:46] to Bow not to bow down to idols and we
[21:48] won't do it God is able to to Deliver Us
[21:51] from this fiery furnace but if he don't
[21:53] what of it we're not going to bow down
[21:56] we're going to go we're going God's
[21:59] provided way and I can hear somebody
[22:00] saying are you sure he got this his
[22:03] provided way and brother Branham says
[22:05] yes hallelujah amen and and we don't
[22:08] want to bow down to the idols of the
[22:10] world like like and be a testimony in in
[22:12] today's day like Meshach uh Shadrach
[22:15] Meshach and Abednego and we don't want
[22:16] to bow down to the as Idols but we want
[22:19] to have confidence in the word and in
[22:21] confidence in the Lord that he's going
[22:22] to take us through through his provided
[22:24] way in worshiping him King
[22:27] Nebuchadnezzar was putting up an idol in
[22:29] those days and they chose again to not
[22:32] to bow down to that Idol and it's the
[22:35] same way we have to make a conscious
[22:37] decision in today's world that we're not
[22:39] going to bow down to things that of this
[22:41] world of this flesh we have to make a
[22:43] conscious decision to not spend more
[22:45] time on our phones or our Electronics
[22:47] than in time in the word or time
[22:49] worshiping the Lord we need to make that
[22:52] conscious decision to spend time where
[22:54] it's due fit with the Lord and in
[22:56] worship and in fellowship with him
[23:02] it's a choice to go against the ways of
[23:04] the world it's easier to go with the
[23:07] world it is easier it's easier to just
[23:08] go with the trends what everybody's
[23:10] doing you just go that way because it's
[23:12] just easier nobody's pointing fingers at
[23:14] you nobody's looking at you but it takes
[23:16] the Holy Spirit and it takes the word of
[23:19] God to push you in the direction and to
[23:21] stand confident with the Lord and to
[23:23] stand exactly where he's telling you
[23:25] because of the word what the word tells
[23:27] you and we need to stand boldly in the
[23:29] face of Satan and reject his lies it
[23:32] took confidence for the the Hebrew
[23:34] children to walk straight into the fire
[23:37] I tell you would have been really scary
[23:39] thing to be thinking you're going right
[23:40] into some Flames sometimes we we read
[23:42] this story and it's it seems really
[23:44] God's saving power that kept them but if
[23:47] we think just for a moment in our
[23:49] natural flesh if we had to walk directly
[23:51] where we knew that everybody else would
[23:54] has died in this fire before us everyone
[23:56] else has passed away nobody else has
[23:58] made it through even the guards who are
[24:00] standing next to us making sure that we
[24:02] don't get rid of our our little ropes
[24:04] they're passing right off the side of
[24:07] the the balcony there and they're dying
[24:09] from the Heat and so that would be a
[24:11] terrible thing to just walk straight but
[24:14] the word of God held them in confidence
[24:17] to to walk forward and to walk directly
[24:20] into the promise that the Lord had
[24:23] promised them
[24:25] they were walking not only because of a
[24:27] promise which is true but they were also
[24:29] walking because of their relationship
[24:31] with God they had such a relationship
[24:33] with the heavenly father that they knew
[24:35] and they were confident that because
[24:37] they had stayed true to the word and
[24:40] they had stayed true to not bowing down
[24:42] to this Idol and taking idol worship
[24:44] that the Lord would see them through
[24:48] and it takes Fellowship to be able to
[24:50] have that confidence in the word of God
[24:52] it does not come just by rhetoric this
[24:56] does not come simply by reading but we
[24:58] have to have a fellowship with the Lord
[25:00] and worshiping him and having a
[25:02] relationship with the Lord that we
[25:04] receive this confidence
[25:06] and and worship is fellowship fellowship
[25:10] and worship are very similar in in David
[25:12] when he wrote The Psalm he had
[25:14] Fellowship because he was continually
[25:16] worshiping the Lord and he had a
[25:18] relationship with Christ in this
[25:20] Fellowship brother random says
[25:22] Fellowship by Redemption 1955. now in
[25:25] the beginning when God made man to
[25:27] worship Him and live God taking care of
[25:30] him fed him man had perfect fellowship
[25:33] with God there was nothing wrong and God
[25:36] came down in the evening and talked to
[25:38] Adam and Eve and what a beautiful
[25:40] picture so Adam and Eve and in the
[25:42] beginning of time they had a fellowship
[25:44] with the Lord because they would worship
[25:45] Him and they would commune with him and
[25:47] they would have have sweet fellowship
[25:49] with him and human flesh was created for
[25:52] that one purpose to worship God and
[25:54] worshiping God is fellowshipping him and
[25:57] building a relationship with Christ and
[25:59] through that we would do sing and we
[26:01] will have prayer and we can through
[26:03] meditation in the quietness of our heart
[26:05] and through service we We Worship the
[26:08] Lord and we fellowship and our
[26:10] fellowship builds our confidence so that
[26:12] when we come into a Triumph when we come
[26:14] into a test we can confidently know that
[26:17] the Lord is going to take us through
[26:18] we've read the scriptures and now we
[26:20] have the confidence in the author behind
[26:22] those scriptures to move forward and
[26:25] just to press on with the Lord what the
[26:27] Lord's telling us through the word
[26:30] it's a daily thing we can't just worship
[26:33] on Sundays and Wednesdays we need to
[26:35] find ourselves in a secret place every
[26:38] day of the week on our knees before the
[26:40] Lord and we need to find ourselves in
[26:41] devotion and and really devote Our Lives
[26:44] to this gospel and devote our our
[26:47] families and devote everything that we
[26:49] can't think about to the word and to the
[26:51] Lord so that when we come into a trial
[26:53] when we want to have the the
[26:55] supernatural power of the holy ghost
[26:57] acting in our situations it's because
[26:59] the we've been faithful to the Lord and
[27:01] he'll be faithful to us
[27:04] amen
[27:06] David wrote about this too in the
[27:08] scripture we read he wrote Rising early
[27:10] and worshiping the Lord for Glory and
[27:13] his Mercy David was a worshiper and we
[27:16] could see the Lord really worked in his
[27:18] life and when and the Lord was faithful
[27:20] to him and he had confidence and he had
[27:23] confidence in the word of God
[27:27] amen
[27:32] when we're thinking about idols
[27:35] two of the first Commandments that God
[27:38] gave Moses the first was to have no
[27:40] other gods before me and the second was
[27:43] you shall not have make Idols so the
[27:45] word in God himself that was made flesh
[27:47] now that dwells amongst us he he he
[27:50] commissioned Moses these things and and
[27:53] he asked that we would make no other
[27:55] gods before him and that we would not
[27:57] build up idols and worship them and so
[28:00] it must become our passion it must
[28:02] become the love and the admiration of
[28:05] our hearts and it is God that we put
[28:07] first to worship that it's the word it's
[28:09] the scriptures that we worship him
[28:12] because he is all that is to us
[28:15] and it's if our minds and our hearts can
[28:17] be consumed and filled and Anointed with
[28:20] the things of God our whole lives will
[28:22] become an incense of praise and an
[28:24] incense of worship before him so that
[28:27] when when we come and we Fellowship him
[28:29] we're just closer than a brother like a
[28:32] father would be to us and we can just
[28:34] have this Fellowship this relationship
[28:36] with him and we want the genuine if we
[28:39] want the genuine moving of the Holy
[28:41] Spirit we can't let this Sodom condition
[28:43] of all these Idols to seep into our our
[28:45] lives and pollute our experience with
[28:47] the holy spirit because when we start
[28:49] taking away the focus from the Lord and
[28:51] we start taking away the focus from God
[28:54] and the scriptures and the things of of
[28:56] the lord we we will automatically turn
[28:58] to something else because we need to
[29:00] fill a void and that's human nature
[29:02] within us and so if we can make the
[29:04] focal point of our lives and the focal
[29:06] point of our experience this uh commit
[29:09] this communication with the Lord in this
[29:11] reverence and relationship I believe we
[29:14] will see the anyone moving of the holy
[29:17] spirit in our churches in our homes and
[29:19] in our private lives
[29:26] 1961 brother Brenham says in
[29:28] expectations I believe in old-fashioned
[29:30] Pentecostal sky blue skin sin killing
[29:34] religion yes sir I believe in being Gun
[29:37] Barrel straight and preaching it the
[29:39] same way and living it the way you
[29:42] preach it and just jump as high as you
[29:44] can live
[29:45] amen formal dead religion is not going
[29:48] to cut it for us we need to have this
[29:50] life in our in our beings and we need to
[29:53] get that from from the word of God and
[29:55] we need to have that from that
[29:56] fellowship if you have fellowship with
[29:58] the Lord and continual uh conversation
[30:01] with him and you have that relationship
[30:03] with him the things of the word are not
[30:06] going to be boring to you the things of
[30:08] the message they're going to spark in
[30:10] your heart and they're going to keep you
[30:11] alive and and keep you keep you living
[30:15] so this formal dead religion won't cut
[30:17] it and and although theology is good and
[30:20] and we want to understand the scriptures
[30:22] and we don't understand the history
[30:23] behind things and those are all good
[30:26] things to know as a Believer but it's
[30:28] the real solid understandings and the
[30:30] comprehension of the word that is gonna
[30:32] that is Gonna Keep Us Concrete in the
[30:35] message and it's going to keep us tied
[30:37] to our anchor that when we when we are
[30:40] are meeting our creator on our knees
[30:42] then we know exactly what we're what
[30:44] we're talking about and we can just have
[30:46] fellowship with him it's the best thing
[30:48] when you get together with a friend and
[30:50] you begin to talk about things and and
[30:52] you can really relate on the same level
[30:54] amen you can really talk about uh the
[30:57] same subject matter or you can talk
[30:59] about the same the same things and and
[31:01] you can Bond over that and it's the same
[31:03] in the natural as a spiritual if we
[31:05] could really understand the scriptures
[31:06] and we could really know uh what the
[31:09] word says we can we can talk to the Lord
[31:11] about it in our private times and we can
[31:13] ask him Lord what did you mean by this
[31:16] and Lord I I want to I want to go deeper
[31:19] in this thing I wanna I wanna have a
[31:21] greater experience in this area Lord
[31:23] Jesus and he can we can have that
[31:25] relationship a close bond with him that
[31:27] will that will give us strength to live
[31:29] on in this life
[31:31] it goes beyond knowing uh just the
[31:34] things that our Sunday school teachers
[31:36] tell us it goes beyond the things that
[31:38] our youth leaders and we learn in youth
[31:40] meetings it even goes beyond the
[31:44] services but we have to have that in our
[31:45] private time where we're just gleaning
[31:48] from the word of God and we get hit away
[31:50] in the secret place and we worship and
[31:52] fellowship with the Lord
[31:58] if we make room for this genuine moving
[32:00] of the holy spirit in our lives and just
[32:02] worship him we can let praise come out
[32:05] and get in touch with Jesus and I
[32:07] believe that this outpouring and God
[32:09] moving in our in our midst Miracles are
[32:12] going to happen heal greater healings
[32:14] are going to take place and it's all
[32:16] because our faith just needs to be
[32:18] kicked into action I mean we believe
[32:20] that our faith is already within us like
[32:22] brother random tales of the acorn that
[32:24] the faith is within our hearts and it's
[32:27] there it just needs to grow up and it
[32:28] comes it needs to come and take action
[32:30] in our lives
[32:36] Amen brother Branham says in Fellowship
[32:38] 1960
[32:39] I want to call to your attention hear
[32:42] one thing especially that is on the
[32:44] hyssop hyssop was the applying the blood
[32:47] was applied with with uh by with hyssop
[32:50] and hyssop is as common as weeds and the
[32:54] blood is applied by faith something
[32:55] common reach out and get it anywhere see
[33:00] that's how the blood is applied you
[33:02] don't have to go someplace to get it you
[33:04] just take the weeds the common things by
[33:06] simple faith in Christ and believe and
[33:09] the blood is applied to the door of your
[33:11] heart by simple Faith just Faith just
[33:14] believe him brother Brenham says in
[33:16] nothing and not nothing you have to get
[33:18] any different just the faith that you
[33:20] got now so it's it's the common things
[33:22] that we have in our lives it's just
[33:24] faith is common brother Brenham is
[33:26] typing here and in this in that sermon
[33:29] fellowship and it's it in in the
[33:32] children of Israel's time it was in
[33:34] Egypt and he's talking about this
[33:37] um in the scripture to to apply the
[33:39] doorpost with hyssop of the blood of the
[33:41] Lamb and hyssop was just a common weed
[33:44] that was growing in in Egypt and in
[33:46] Goshen at the time and so all they had
[33:48] to do was take that plant and dip it in
[33:50] the Lamb's blood and paint it over the
[33:52] doorpost that was the instruction and so
[33:55] they had to apply the blood but through
[33:57] faith because the death angel was going
[34:00] to pass and they had to have the faith
[34:02] in the word of God through Moses the the
[34:05] prophet that he he was telling the
[34:06] children of Israel to paint their doors
[34:08] with this Lamb's Blood using the hyssop
[34:10] and they had to apply it but through
[34:12] faith so Faith was really the tool by
[34:15] which they applied the token to their
[34:17] lives
[34:18] it was through faith that they applied
[34:20] this token and so we already have the
[34:22] faith in growing in the Common Grounds
[34:25] of Our Lives it's already there and it's
[34:27] all around us we just have to take it up
[34:29] and we have to paint the blood over the
[34:31] doorpost of our hearts and we need to
[34:33] walk in into the the promises of God and
[34:36] it is it there it is it takes uh
[34:39] spiritual Revelation for you to harvest
[34:41] that hyssop around you and take it up
[34:44] and with action of Faith apply it to
[34:47] your trouble or a try apply it to your
[34:50] trial or your your situation that you're
[34:53] going through
[34:59] and so we've moved into a a New Covenant
[35:02] as as Jesus died on the cross and this
[35:05] blood that was shed for us brings us
[35:06] into a new covenant
[35:08] where now previously was the blood of
[35:12] the bulls and goats that that could take
[35:14] away the sin and brother Branham says
[35:16] now in I am the resurrection and the
[35:18] life 52 we know this that in the Old
[35:21] Testament
[35:22] the blood of bulls and goats could not
[35:24] take away sin
[35:27] it's only covered sin
[35:29] it only covered sin so it could not take
[35:31] away the sin but it could just cover it
[35:33] for the time being and the living was
[35:35] just waiting in Paradise for the day
[35:38] that sin could be taken away but when
[35:40] Jesus came the Son of God the Messiah he
[35:43] took away sin he divorced it never
[35:45] covered it but he took it away and
[35:48] Christ Jesus never covered sin when he
[35:50] came but it was removed completely gone
[35:52] I like what brother Branham says he
[35:54] divorced Sin from us he cannot come back
[35:56] it's gone forever
[35:59] and calling Jesus on the scene 64. now
[36:02] remember every Redemptive blessing you
[36:04] has already been purchased the price is
[36:07] paid there is only one way you'll ever
[36:10] ever be able to receive it it's to
[36:12] believe it and to accept it he's the
[36:14] high priest of our confession the Hebrew
[36:17] says there the Hebrew letter says he's
[36:20] the high priest of our confession to
[36:22] profess and confess is the same thing of
[36:25] course so we he is the high priest of
[36:27] our compassion therefore he cannot do
[36:30] anything for us until we first confess
[36:32] that he has done it so we need to take
[36:35] the faith in our lives and apply it and
[36:37] just confess exactly what we have needed
[36:39] we have to confess our healing we have
[36:41] to confess our breakthrough in our
[36:43] situation we have to confess the peace
[36:45] that is flowing over us and it just
[36:47] takes that one thing brother random says
[36:49] is to confess it receive it and believe
[36:52] it
[36:56] Romans 8 29 and 30. for whom he did for
[37:01] no he also did Pro destinate to be
[37:04] conformed to the image of his son that
[37:07] he might be the firstborn among many
[37:09] Brethren moreover whom he did
[37:12] predestinate then he also called and
[37:14] whom he called he also justified in whom
[37:17] he justified he also glorified
[37:20] God called you he didn't call anybody
[37:23] else but he called you
[37:25] he planned this all for you and he had
[37:27] you in mind
[37:28] salvation is for you sometimes people
[37:31] want to push off salvation to somebody
[37:33] else and they want to say well I'm not
[37:35] good enough and I've done all these
[37:37] things in my life and I I had such a
[37:39] horrible past and I've done such
[37:40] horrible things but there's no need to
[37:42] doubt tonight because the Lord Jesus
[37:45] Christ ordained this this justification
[37:48] and desanctification and he called you
[37:51] the scripture says he called you and he
[37:54] predestinated you that means from the
[37:55] beginning of time he put your name in
[37:57] that book and he called you for
[38:00] salvation
[38:01] there's not one person here tonight or
[38:03] listening to this service that the Lord
[38:05] has called you by accident the Lord
[38:07] doesn't make accidents he he he
[38:10] ordained everything from the beginning
[38:12] of time and your name is there for a
[38:14] purpose and it has a job you have a job
[38:16] to do for him and the Lord wants to
[38:19] speak to you so you need to listen for
[38:20] your calling sometimes we we feel like
[38:24] we'll just come to church and we'll just
[38:25] come Sunday Wednesday and we'll do our
[38:28] devotions but we're not looking for what
[38:29] what we could do for the Lord I believe
[38:32] we need to be always watching Lord what
[38:33] can I do for you today Lord where can I
[38:36] speak to somebody where where could I my
[38:38] life be a testimony sometimes we don't
[38:40] always have the opportunity to speak
[38:42] directly to somebody vocally but if our
[38:45] lives can just be a shining testimony
[38:47] and we can reserve ourselves Lord let my
[38:49] life be a light in the in the places I
[38:51] go today
[38:53] that he could work through you because
[38:55] he has a job for you to do Jesus is
[38:57] Calling out to you the mighty hand of
[38:59] Jehovah's is knocking and Revelations 3
[39:02] 20 says behold I stand at the door and
[39:04] knock
[39:06] and if any man hear my voice and open
[39:08] the door I will come into him
[39:11] I will sup with him and he with me
[39:15] and that's what the scripture says there
[39:16] and and Jesus is God in flesh it's him
[39:20] who's knocking at your door if you just
[39:23] imagine for a moment it's not just
[39:24] anybody who's knocking at your door but
[39:26] it's Christ Jesus the one who died on
[39:28] the cross he's there knocking on your
[39:30] heart's door and he's asking you to let
[39:33] let him in he says I will come into him
[39:35] and I will sup with him and he with me
[39:37] it's God in flesh the same one who
[39:40] created the world the one who created
[39:42] the flowers of of the garden and the
[39:44] ocean and all the fish in the sea and
[39:47] imagine all the the sky he created and
[39:49] every bird and every animal that would
[39:51] fly in them he created that's the same
[39:53] God that created our bodies he's the
[39:56] same one today that's calling you he's
[39:58] knocking on your door and if you'd only
[39:59] receive him tonight that he could move
[40:02] in your situation he could move in your
[40:04] life and young people if he could just
[40:06] give you the Holy Spirit tonight that he
[40:08] could fill you from your top of your
[40:10] head to your bottom of your toes this
[40:11] evening he's more than able he can feel
[40:14] you right now and those who need
[40:16] something from the Lord you could just
[40:17] reach out and grab it because it's
[40:19] waiting for you he's calling you he's
[40:22] asking you to let him in and he's going
[40:25] to tell you exactly your position in him
[40:28] he wants to have fellowship with you
[40:30] sweet communion so we just want to let
[40:33] the Lord come into our hearts and to
[40:35] speak to us speak into our hearts Lord
[40:37] tell us what we need to do is our prayer
[40:42] we want to look at David just a moment
[40:44] again and David in his young age he he
[40:47] learned the ways of God from a very
[40:49] young age he would go out and he would
[40:51] tend to his father's sheep when he was
[40:53] just a young boy and he would worship
[40:55] there in the field and he would
[40:57] fellowship with the Lord as he's keeping
[40:59] the sheep and his confidence in the Lord
[41:01] be in God became to grow stronger as his
[41:04] relationship it grew stronger as he was
[41:06] spending more time with with God and and
[41:09] he then grew the confidence to be able
[41:12] to be commissioned to go take Goliath in
[41:16] in the battle at the time
[41:18] and David in the Bible was he was
[41:20] meeting on the way to meet his brothers
[41:21] and he was bringing food and that's what
[41:23] he was he was called to do in his timing
[41:26] he thought he was called to just take a
[41:28] lunch up to his brothers and then he he
[41:30] was he saw uh
[41:32] Goliath there and he he felt in his
[41:35] heart all of a sudden now he needs to do
[41:37] something he needs to act on this and
[41:39] this this Philistine is is making fun
[41:42] and he's gawking at the children of
[41:44] Israel who are called they're the people
[41:45] of God and so in his heart he he went
[41:48] after this and he said his brother
[41:50] Branham says here in the great warrior
[41:53] David 55 and when David went to meet
[41:56] Goliath Goliath looked at him and
[41:58] laughed and said
[42:00] why what am I a dog to you you coming
[42:03] out to meet me like that a little old
[42:05] Ruddy boy looking
[42:06] he was ready little
[42:08] you know what Saul called him said who
[42:11] is this Stripling that's what Saul said
[42:13] and who is this Stripling out there just
[42:16] a little old kid you know a little
[42:18] looking fellow probably shoulder stooped
[42:21] over sometimes this is what the devil
[42:23] tells us he tells us like like uh
[42:26] Goliath was saying to David or even like
[42:28] Saul the king he tells us you're nothing
[42:30] but weak you're nothing but a failure
[42:32] you're nothing but a mess up and he says
[42:35] you could never take on this task you
[42:37] could never overcome this thing in your
[42:39] life you could never beat this the devil
[42:41] is stronger than you and he's just
[42:43] trying to get up in your head and talk
[42:45] you down out of your position in the
[42:46] Lord he's trying to talk you out of your
[42:48] position as a child of God as the bride
[42:52] but I want you to remember that God
[42:54] chose you tonight
[42:56] you're God's child and you're the elect
[42:57] Bride for this hour brother Branham
[43:00] continues here and he says and here he
[43:02] come with this little sling but he know
[43:05] God
[43:06] that's the main thing he was a Believer
[43:08] he was elected he was called and he was
[43:11] anointed and he was placed Hallelujah
[43:14] and tonight you know God you are called
[43:17] and you are anointed for the work of the
[43:19] Lord you are anointed for what God's
[43:21] given you and you are placed
[43:24] he's placed you with an anointing to
[43:26] continue on with his work brother banham
[43:28] continues in the same quote you say can
[43:32] that well brother Branham I wasn't
[43:33] called to be a preacher I you might be
[43:36] called to be a housewife but you got
[43:38] your position in Christ by the Holy
[43:40] Ghost amen you're just as much David as
[43:43] the rest of them one was he said so you
[43:46] might not be called to be a preacher you
[43:48] might not be called to be a worship
[43:50] leader or even on the musician team or
[43:52] something you might not be called to be
[43:53] a Sunday school teacher or somebody
[43:55] that's working actively every day in the
[43:58] church but that doesn't mean you're not
[44:00] called that's not the requirement to be
[44:02] called you might be called just to be a
[44:04] prayer Warrior or like brother Branham
[44:06] says a housewife making your house a
[44:08] Godly environment for your children to
[44:10] grow up in you might be called to be
[44:13] helping with the elderly in the church
[44:15] and working with the widows perhaps
[44:16] maybe God's called you just simply to be
[44:19] an amen corner to be an amen and a
[44:21] visual witness in the house of God so
[44:23] that when this gospels preached and an
[44:25] unsold unsaved Soul walks into this
[44:28] house they see Christ on display in this
[44:30] very sanctuary
[44:34] but one thing for sure is that God
[44:36] called you he chose you he predestinated
[44:38] you from the foundation of the world to
[44:40] be working for him and that's your
[44:42] position you've been called and it is in
[44:44] Christ Jesus we move forward
[44:48] amen
[44:54] I just want to go back here to Psalms
[44:56] 108 7 8 and 9.
[44:59] and look at something just the Lord
[45:00] placed on my heart God hath Psalms 108
[45:04] verse 7 God has spoken in his Holiness I
[45:07] Will Rejoice I will divide shechem and
[45:10] meet out of the valley of sucketh
[45:12] Gilead is mine Manasseh is mine Ephraim
[45:16] is also the strength of my hand Judah is
[45:18] my lawgiver Moab is my washpot
[45:22] over Edom I will cast out my shoe over
[45:24] philistia I will Triumph
[45:27] I want to look at this certain phrases
[45:30] Moab is my wash pot
[45:33] and when I first read this scripture in
[45:35] my devotion I was I was uh kind of
[45:38] stumped over like what is a wash potting
[45:40] and why is the scripture referring to
[45:42] Moab this place in the scripture as a
[45:44] washpot and so I did a little bit of
[45:47] looking and I found that a washpot is
[45:49] not like something for the dishes for
[45:51] the kitchen but rather it is a a big pot
[45:53] they used to use in the Bible times to
[45:55] wash the feet of the people when they
[45:56] would come into the house
[45:58] and we know that that was a tradition
[46:00] they had is because they walked in
[46:02] sandals their feet were dirty and so
[46:04] they would they would come before coming
[46:06] into the house they would sit there and
[46:07] they'd often have what we returned as a
[46:10] foot wash flunky and to wash their feet
[46:12] before they would go into the house
[46:16] and so I looked at this statement Moab
[46:17] is my wash pot and Moab was a territory
[46:20] ruled by a king and the children of
[46:22] Israel were often held captive by this
[46:24] by the nation and Edom was a neighboring
[46:28] territory and and which the children of
[46:31] Israel were kind of spread out through
[46:32] the land living there
[46:35] and the and the scripture tells us that
[46:37] after the children of Israel were
[46:39] scattered through the land
[46:41] um
[46:42] they were kind of being persecuted and
[46:46] they were having uh all these trials and
[46:48] tests in this time so I would like you
[46:50] to turn with me to Judges chapter 3 and
[46:53] we're just going to read a passage of
[46:54] scripture just to understand the context
[46:57] of of what's happening in the scripture
[47:00] with the children of Israel
[47:08] so Judges chapter 3 will start from
[47:11] verse one I apologize for the lengthy
[47:13] reading we're going to read 15 verses
[47:18] now these are the nation which the Lord
[47:20] left to prove Israel by them even as
[47:23] many of Israel as had not known all the
[47:26] wars of Canaan
[47:28] only that the generation of the children
[47:30] of Israel might know to teach them War
[47:32] at the least such as before knew nothing
[47:35] thereof namely five Lords of Philistines
[47:38] and of the Canaanites in the city of
[47:40] knights and the hivites that dwelt in
[47:42] Mount Lebanon
[47:43] from Mount belarherman unto entering
[47:46] unto the entering of hamath
[47:49] and they were to prove Israel by them to
[47:52] know whether they would hearken unto the
[47:54] Commandments of the Lord which he
[47:56] commanded their fathers by the hand of
[47:58] Moses
[48:00] and the children of Israel dwelt among
[48:02] the Canaanites Hittites and amorites and
[48:05] parasites and hivits and jebusites and
[48:07] the children of Israel Cried unto the
[48:09] Lord the Lord raised up a deliverer to
[48:12] the children of Israel who delivered
[48:14] them even athenil the son of kanaz
[48:17] Caleb's younger brother
[48:18] and the spirit of the Lord came upon him
[48:20] and he judged Israel and went out to War
[48:22] and the Lord delivered
[48:25] king of Mesopotamia into his hand and
[48:29] his hand prevailed against shushan
[48:31] rishtiyam
[48:33] and the land had rest 40 years and
[48:37] othniel the son of kanaz died
[48:40] and the children of Israel did Evil
[48:42] again in the sight of the Lord and the
[48:44] Lord strengthened eglon the king of Moab
[48:46] against Israel because they hadn't done
[48:49] evil in the sight of the Lord and He
[48:52] gathered unto him the children of Iman
[48:54] and amalik and went and smote Israel and
[48:58] possessed the city of the palm of palm
[49:00] trees so the children of Israel served
[49:03] eglon the king of Moab 18 years
[49:05] but when the children of Israel Cried
[49:08] unto the Lord the Lord raised them up a
[49:10] deliverer Ehud the son of Guerra a
[49:13] benjaminite
[49:14] a left-handed man and by the by the
[49:17] children of Israel sent a present unto
[49:19] eglon the king of Moab and so the rest
[49:21] of the passage of the scripture goes on
[49:23] to tell the finishing of the story where
[49:25] he was a deliverer and he delivered the
[49:28] children of Israel out of their
[49:30] situation of bondage and so the we see
[49:33] in this In this passage here the
[49:34] children of Israel as a nation they're
[49:37] living in amongst their enemies and
[49:39] they're continually in these lands and
[49:42] they were in this win-lose cycle they
[49:43] were they were doing well for the Lord
[49:45] and they were on fire and then something
[49:48] would happen and the scripture says they
[49:49] would sin before the Lord and the Lord
[49:51] would allow their their captors or their
[49:54] oppressors to oppress them for a certain
[49:56] amount of time and so time would pass we
[49:59] see eight years of bondage and then 40
[50:01] Years of freedom and a cycle continues
[50:03] again they had 18 years of bondage and I
[50:05] believe four score years which would be
[50:08] 80 of Freedom so continually up and down
[50:10] there through this cycle they're cycling
[50:12] they're they're winning and they're
[50:14] losing and this this cycle of sin would
[50:16] continue and they would cry out for God
[50:18] to Mercy and God was faithful I'm
[50:21] thankful the Lord's faithful sometimes
[50:22] we do the same sometimes we're found in
[50:24] this download place where we're just not
[50:26] on fire for the Lord and maybe we're not
[50:28] doing completely right before the Lord
[50:30] and we have to continually ask for
[50:32] forgiveness as we do daily and we ask
[50:35] the Lord forgive us and his grace and
[50:37] mercy is faithful each time and we're so
[50:39] thankful for that but we see in the in
[50:41] this the passage here of the children of
[50:44] Israel they're in this up and down up
[50:46] and down up and down and so David writes
[50:49] here in the Psalms 108 God spoke saying
[50:52] Moses is my wash pot and a wash pot we
[50:55] said was a water basin in which they
[50:57] washed the feet and so Moab was this
[51:00] place where the the children of Israel
[51:03] were in this continually continual cycle
[51:05] of getting dirty again and then
[51:07] re-washing the Lord was allowing them to
[51:10] be oppressed by their captors they were
[51:12] being uh in bondage for so many years
[51:15] and then the Lord would raise up a
[51:17] deliverer and they would wash them off
[51:19] in his life that sanctifying process
[51:21] over and over and over and over again in
[51:24] Moab and so we understand then why why
[51:27] David says Moab is my wash pot because
[51:30] it's this place where the soul is being
[51:33] washed or the children of Israel are
[51:35] being washed off continually and and
[51:37] it's a Sanctified entrance for for the
[51:41] sin and so we we come into Moab the
[51:43] washbottom we are washed and washed from
[51:46] our sin but then we need to come out of
[51:48] Moab we need to come on come out of Moab
[51:50] and continue on like the children of
[51:52] Israel did and go up to Jordan where we
[51:54] can cross the river and where we can
[51:56] receive eternal life and where we can
[51:58] receive our promises if we're always
[52:00] stuck in Moab we're just continually in
[52:03] this cycle of winning and losing and
[52:05] we're we're never getting anywhere for
[52:07] the Lord we're never making a stand
[52:09] we're not progressing in our spiritual
[52:11] walk and so we need to get out of Moab
[52:13] and so I want to kind of title this
[52:16] service getting out of Moab
[52:18] that we that we could come through the
[52:20] sanctification process because we need
[52:22] to we need to die out and we need to
[52:24] cleanse our our souls and our lives and
[52:26] we need to make things right before the
[52:28] Lord and live in sanctification but Moab
[52:31] is not the stopping place for us it's
[52:33] not the place that we stop and we
[52:35] continually live in this uh Sanctified
[52:37] Place although when we do come up to uh
[52:40] Jordan we cross over we're still living
[52:42] the Sanctified life we're just not going
[52:45] back to the muck of sin continually and
[52:47] we're not going back to the new the old
[52:49] things that we we once did and we're not
[52:51] getting ourselves dirty in the old
[52:53] things we did but rather we just
[52:55] continue on living our Sanctified life
[52:57] in our position of sanctification
[53:00] and so that his time is a call this
[53:02] evening to come and get out of Moab come
[53:05] and get out of Moab and cross into
[53:07] Canaan line step out of the filth of
[53:09] your life step out of the trials step
[53:11] out of the the situations that you're in
[53:14] and overcome with the word of God and
[53:17] walk forward in cleanness of not of life
[53:23] there is forgiveness that's available
[53:25] but it's time that we left Moab It's
[53:28] Kind it's time to come into our
[53:30] Salvation in full and it's time to
[53:31] receive that baptism of the Holy Spirit
[53:33] if you've not had it and it's time that
[53:36] we we must wash we must attend that wash
[53:39] pot but it's not time to stay there but
[53:40] it's time to continue on
[53:44] there are only
[53:47] one way to enter the promised land of
[53:50] eternal life and that is the sealing of
[53:51] the Holy Ghost God himself
[53:54] so that we can know God in our position
[54:00] then with the spirit of God and we can
[54:02] confidently say because of our
[54:04] fellowship because of our relationship
[54:06] we can confidently say as the scripture
[54:08] says Gilead is mine manasa is mine these
[54:12] are all the things that the the the the
[54:14] enemies of the children of Israel these
[54:17] are all the things that the the people
[54:18] the the Nations that they could uh
[54:21] conquer because of of the the spirit of
[54:24] the Lord that was with them because of
[54:25] the grace of the Lord so with confidence
[54:27] with the Holy Spirit and with the
[54:29] confidence because of our fellowship
[54:31] that we've had with him through our
[54:32] worship and with our our devotion to him
[54:34] we can say Gilead is mine and Manasseh
[54:38] is mine all things in Christ are ours by
[54:41] faith we just need to kick our faith
[54:43] into action tonight and all the promises
[54:45] of our ours of the Lord get out of Moab
[54:48] walk clean before the Lord in faith
[54:51] worshiping him in fullness and in truth
[54:53] will we stand together tonight

[55:07] delivered to us father
