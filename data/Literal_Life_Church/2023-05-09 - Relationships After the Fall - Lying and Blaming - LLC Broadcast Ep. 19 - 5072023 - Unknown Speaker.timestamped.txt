[7:01] the serpent was more subtle than any
[7:03] beast of the field which the Lord God
[7:05] had made and he said unto the woman ye
[7:07] hath God said ye shall not eat of every
[7:09] tree of the garden and the woman said in
[7:11] the servant we may either the fruit of
[7:13] the Trees of the garden but of the fruit
[7:14] of the tree which is in the midst of the
[7:16] garden God hath said ye shall not eat of
[7:19] it neither shall ye touch it lest ye die
[7:21] and the serpent said unto the woman knee
[7:23] shall not surely die for God doth know
[7:26] in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes
[7:29] shall be opened and ye shall be as Gods
[7:31] knowing good and evil I want you to
[7:34] notice the first thing that's happening
[7:35] here is a misinterpretation of the word
[7:38] but you can really technically call it a
[7:41] lie
[7:43] it's a lie even though there's 90
[7:45] percent truth to it if it's got air in
[7:48] it this way and it's misinterpretation
[7:50] it's still called a lie
[7:53] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[7:55] good for food and that was pleasant to
[7:56] the eyes and a tree to be desired to
[7:58] make one wise she took of the uh she
[8:01] took of the fruit thereof and did eat
[8:02] and gave also unto her husband with her
[8:04] and he did eat and the eyes of both of
[8:07] them were opened and they knew that they
[8:09] were naked and they sold fig leaves
[8:11] together and made themselves aprons and
[8:13] they heard the voice of the Lord walking
[8:15] God Walking In The Garden in the cool of
[8:17] the day and Adam and his wife hid
[8:19] themselves from the presence of the Lord
[8:21] God Among the Trees of the gardens and
[8:23] the Lord called unto Adam and said unto
[8:25] him where art thou and he said I heard
[8:27] thy voice in the garden and I was afraid
[8:28] because I was naked and I hid myself and
[8:31] he said who told me that thou was naked
[8:33] hast thou eaten of the tree where have I
[8:35] commanded thee that thou shouldest not
[8:37] eat and the man said the woman whom thou
[8:40] gave us to be with me she gave me of the
[8:44] tree and I did eat and that is instead
[8:46] of taking ownership and telling the
[8:48] truth himself because remember now the
[8:49] spirit of Lies is consuming everything
[8:52] now listen now they become Liars
[8:54] themselves he should have been answering
[8:56] yes I took of it and said now he's
[8:58] blaming his wife so nobody starts to
[9:00] answer truthfully
[9:02] because you're under the spirit of Lies
[9:04] now
[9:06] so now in in this and lies Spirit of
[9:08] Lies will never work in Oneness in
[9:12] relationships
[9:14] only the truth
[9:16] and he said who told me that that was
[9:18] naked verse 12 and the man said the
[9:20] woman thou gave us to me she gave me a
[9:22] tree and I did and the Lord said unto
[9:23] the woman what is this that thou has
[9:25] done and the woman said the serpent
[9:27] beguiled me and I did eat it's amazing
[9:31] if you look very deeply you can see that
[9:34] there are characteristics coming out
[9:36] that are so revealing of how broken
[9:39] relationships function today
[9:42] if we if we can be honest and we can see
[9:45] our fallen condition and the broken
[9:48] conditions that we live in today uh if
[9:52] we would just look honestly at that then
[9:54] we can see it back where it started at
[9:56] the beginning and not just to look
[9:58] honest and to be honest and to see we're
[10:00] in a fallen condition and uh we're in
[10:03] broken conditions with our families and
[10:06] there's such a a such a so many things
[10:09] we can talk about as far as broken
[10:10] families and broken relationships the
[10:12] hour that we live in I think it's a
[10:14] worse age that we've ever had for that
[10:17] and so but when we look at the beginning
[10:19] we can look and honestly see where our
[10:22] fallen condition came from and that also
[10:25] there is no way to get on the road to
[10:28] Redemption and restoration unless we are
[10:31] honest about the condition that we are
[10:34] in
[10:35] in Lester's repentance unless there's an
[10:37] acknowledgment of the condition that
[10:40] we're in first and that's why when the
[10:42] kingdom of God opened up in the book of
[10:43] Acts it began with repentance you'll
[10:46] never get into the channel or God's
[10:49] Redemptive power unless there's
[10:50] repentance first unless there's an
[10:53] acknowledgment of the condition that
[10:55] you're in and that I need help from God
[10:57] that I need help my relationships are
[11:00] broken I I'm at I'm at a lost here I
[11:02] don't know what to do unless there's a
[11:04] repentance and say Lord I need help
[11:06] you'll never find the path to Redemption
[11:08] but once you begin repenting and saying
[11:11] I acknowledge the condition I'm in I see
[11:13] it in the garden I see it now in my
[11:15] family I see where I've done I see what
[11:17] I've done wrong and when you begin to
[11:19] get in that kind of mode then you open
[11:21] yourself up to a great great power and
[11:25] The Road to Redemption and restoration
[11:27] and the only way we have that is through
[11:29] the blood of Jesus Christ at Calvary
[11:31] that he made a way to redeem us back and
[11:34] to restore broken relationships
[11:37] not only with God but with one another
[11:39] as well let me Proclaim at the outset
[11:42] that whatever I say on relationships in
[11:44] your life that are in a still in a
[11:47] fallen condition if I get specific today
[11:49] and talk a little bit about things that
[11:52] make it uncomfortable for you let me say
[11:54] that whatever I talk to you about in the
[11:57] relationships in your life being maybe
[11:59] still in a fallen type condition no
[12:01] matter how ugly no matter how bad it is
[12:04] you need to know that however Fallen the
[12:07] power of redemption can come to Sons and
[12:10] Daughters of God and give them the right
[12:12] thing and restore the worst conditions
[12:16] and if we don't believe that we
[12:17] shouldn't even be at church this morning
[12:19] there is a power of redemption that
[12:21] comes from Calvary that has the power
[12:23] for every impossible situation every
[12:26] marriage that's broken every family
[12:28] that's broken anything that has been
[12:30] broken Calvary has the power to restore
[12:34] it's when you admit that you are in a
[12:36] mess and say I need you Lord I need you
[12:40] Lord right now
[12:42] that's what God needs
[12:44] and he didn't just need that 20 years
[12:45] ago when you came to the altar he needs
[12:47] that every day Paul said I Die daily to
[12:50] myself
[12:51] I Die daily I need the Lord more than
[12:54] I've ever needed him before and he needs
[12:56] you here that cry in your heart I need
[12:59] you Lord I'm crying out to you Lord
[13:01] this whole generation millions of people
[13:03] they don't need the lord they're not
[13:05] crying out but there's a bride that's
[13:06] crying out I need you Lord I need your
[13:09] blood but I need I need your blood to
[13:11] have power in it to change my life
[13:14] God wants you to hear that you need him
[13:17] God needs you to speak the truth God
[13:20] needs honest truthful confession not a
[13:23] religion not to just know it was the
[13:25] blood it's when true Redemption takes
[13:27] place that Redemption power kicks in
[13:30] it's when true repentance takes place
[13:33] that true repentance and fellowship
[13:35] kicks in so let's start to break this
[13:38] down
[13:39] first thing they both started to do is
[13:42] lie and the other thing they start to do
[13:44] is blame the other person
[13:45] that is a relationship that is not
[13:48] healthy and normal it's a fallen
[13:51] condition when you lie and when you
[13:54] blame other people
[13:55] and don't take personal responsibility
[13:58] for what you've done that is a fallen
[14:01] condition that's from your Fallen nature
[14:03] and you will act that way from a fallen
[14:06] nature never never is that within what
[14:09] Christ is trying to be in your life here
[14:11] and now when Adam and Eve listen to the
[14:13] die of the devil the holy image of God
[14:15] left them their Fellowship was broken
[14:16] with God The Fellowship of Oneness with
[14:19] God was broken the very minute they
[14:21] listened to the LIE of the devil that
[14:22] broke their Fellowship in the very
[14:23] minute that you listen to the LIE of the
[14:25] devil it'll break your fellowship that's
[14:27] the very minute that you go out from the
[14:29] presence of God like she did is when you
[14:31] failed to take God's word just as it is
[14:35] so everybody understands the foundation
[14:36] to this Oneness message is to realize
[14:38] when you listen to the LIE of the enemy
[14:40] it breaks Oneness with God uh it breaks
[14:43] fellowship with God and it breaks
[14:45] fellowship and the minute you listen to
[14:47] the LIE the devil he says it'll break
[14:48] your fellowship so what's the thing that
[14:50] establishes Fellowship what's the thing
[14:52] that strengthens Fellowship your
[14:55] fellowship with God what's the thing
[14:56] that solidifies what's the thing that
[14:58] brings it back certainly we when we stay
[15:01] close to the word of God and we listen
[15:03] and obey the word of God and we're
[15:05] living on the word of God and not the
[15:07] LIE of the enemy not his interpretation
[15:09] of the word you can't have a solid
[15:11] marriage unless you live on truth and
[15:14] the truth comes out and you speak truth
[15:15] to one another
[15:16] anytime there's secrets in time of
[15:19] Secrets it breaks the fellowship
[15:22] anytime this little dabbling over here
[15:24] in adulterous pornographic things you
[15:27] don't even have to tell your wife you'll
[15:30] start to feel the the Oneness break and
[15:32] the wife starts to sense something's
[15:34] wrong and there's a break and there's a
[15:36] pride and there's there's uh he's
[15:38] getting more angry about stuff what's
[15:39] going on you break here with a
[15:40] fellowship with God you dabble in sin
[15:42] you break your Oneness with one another
[15:45] blaming as a result of the Fall it's not
[15:47] right it's not the christ-like way
[15:50] there's a young man in jail that said
[15:52] it's not my fault the other guys stole
[15:54] the stuff but they accused me
[15:59] the comedian Philip Wilson I remember
[16:01] this as a kid he used to say the devil
[16:03] made me do it
[16:04] so people blame other people
[16:06] they blame the devil and they blame God
[16:11] and you got a lot to you know you got a
[16:13] lot to blame there you know lots of
[16:14] people you blame God you can Blade the
[16:16] devil Flip Wilson said the devil made me
[16:18] do it the devil why'd you do that the
[16:19] devil made me do it
[16:21] that's not always good to shift the
[16:23] blame on him when you got to own up to
[16:26] what you did we blame fast food
[16:27] restaurants for making us fat
[16:31] we blame tobacco companies for giving us
[16:33] cancer we blame the church for our lack
[16:35] of spiritual growth
[16:37] we blame God for results of our poor
[16:40] choices oh God why is this happening to
[16:42] me we are in a culture we're blaming
[16:44] others for our failures happens all the
[16:46] time but how does God view this Blame
[16:48] Game could it be a form of idolatry
[16:51] where our feelings of Pride are elevated
[16:53] above any sense of responsibility we
[16:55] expect blame shifting from a child we
[16:57] expect it from a child how many has ever
[16:59] seen a child do that they're exposed
[17:02] it's it's there and they're still going
[17:04] to say Johnny Johnny did it he did it
[17:09] we expect children to act this way but
[17:12] not adults many adults never grow to
[17:15] mental and emotional maturity still
[17:17] blaming others for their mistakes
[17:20] grown-ups acting like children
[17:22] counselors call this blame shifting we
[17:25] come by this Blame Game honestly it's
[17:28] inherited sin I'm reading a lot of
[17:30] things that happen to us are the result
[17:32] of multiple multiple contributing
[17:34] factors and it can be caused by a mix of
[17:38] our own actions and those of other
[17:39] people for example if you were to hit a
[17:42] pothole in the road and fall off your
[17:45] bike it was probably partly due to the
[17:47] fact that the road has been poorly
[17:49] maintained
[17:51] but also that you were cycling too fast
[17:54] and not looking where you were going
[17:59] if that were you you might be ranting
[18:02] and raging about your taxes are spent on
[18:06] these roads
[18:09] now that one was just too close to home
[18:11] with me it's just too convicting
[18:15] I had to repent right here
[18:17] ranting and raging about what your taxes
[18:20] are spent on these days and or would
[18:22] accept the part that you played in it
[18:24] and vow to learn from your mistakes if
[18:28] you find yourself trying to pass the
[18:30] buck for every mistake you make then
[18:32] it's probably gotten you into trouble in
[18:33] the past especially if you try to shift
[18:35] the blame onto your partner your
[18:37] marriage partner family best friends or
[18:39] people you have to work closely with no
[18:41] matter how much people love us there's
[18:43] only a certain number of times people
[18:45] will tolerate taking the blame for
[18:47] something that genuinely genuinely
[18:49] wasn't their fault
[18:51] you're only going to do that so long
[18:52] it's going to catch up with you and I'm
[18:54] talking to all of us here you're going
[18:55] to do that for so long it's going to
[18:56] catch up with you because people aren't
[18:58] going to tolerate being blamed for your
[19:00] mistakes
[19:01] as well as weakening our relationship
[19:03] being unable to take responsibility for
[19:06] our mistakes can damage Us in other ways
[19:09] so now we have some reasons we blame
[19:11] others for our mistakes just so we we
[19:14] don't know sometimes the reasons why we
[19:16] do it you may have your own reasons but
[19:17] here's reasons why we choose to blame
[19:20] others for our mistakes all right number
[19:22] one to explain why something happened
[19:25] as humans it's our default to always
[19:28] look for something called it's our
[19:30] default to always look for the cause of
[19:32] something
[19:34] we like to have narratives that explain
[19:36] why things happen so that we can add
[19:38] these to our mental story of life rather
[19:40] than turning the light on ourselves or
[19:42] looking at the bigger picture and
[19:43] context we can explain things more
[19:46] quickly and easily by attributing them
[19:48] to others number two the reason why we
[19:51] blame others to attack someone Shifting
[19:53] the blame onto someone who is a subtle
[19:55] way to attack them we might do it so
[19:58] unconsciously but if we hold a grudge
[19:59] against someone for some reason perhaps
[20:01] we feel you've they've wronged us or
[20:04] blamed us in the past then if an
[20:06] opportunity to blame them presents
[20:07] itself it can be very tempting to take
[20:09] it blaming them for something is also a
[20:11] tactic we may use to hurt our partners
[20:13] whether we're aware of doing it or not
[20:15] number three why do we blame others it's
[20:18] a great defense mechanism Shifting the
[20:20] blame directly onto someone or something
[20:22] else is the perfect way to avoid having
[20:24] to reflect on your behavior or delve
[20:27] deeply into your uh psyche that way that
[20:30] way you can remain blissfully unaware of
[20:33] your own shortcomings which can help
[20:35] maintain a fragile Eagle number four
[20:37] it's easier that way to blame others why
[20:40] would we bother doing all the tricky
[20:41] self-analysis and taking steps to fix
[20:43] the situation if we can just take the
[20:45] blame off of our own shoulders and place
[20:46] it on someone else sometimes we convince
[20:48] ourselves that it's really someone's
[20:49] else's fault but sometimes we know we're
[20:51] lying but we often decide on the spur of
[20:54] the moment that it's easier to tell a
[20:55] lie than it is to deal with the
[20:57] consequences of Truth we learn to lie
[20:59] early on in life how many would say Amen
[21:02] we are taught to lie
[21:05] we learn to lie early in life and most
[21:08] of us get pretty good at it we weigh the
[21:11] possibility of people finding out we've
[21:12] lied against the consequences we have to
[21:14] face if we own up and often take the
[21:17] easy option
[21:19] I'm just reading these to show you this
[21:21] is all from a fallen nature
[21:23] this is how we can react react if it's
[21:26] from the Fallen nature but Christ does
[21:28] not react this way as a matter of fact I
[21:30] might as well say it Christ took the
[21:33] path of Calvary and to actually take the
[21:35] take the pain of our sin on himself
[21:40] number five we blame others because it
[21:42] removes inhibitions blaming other people
[21:44] can provide us with an excuse to act in
[21:46] a hurtful manner it's a way of
[21:48] justifying our actions
[21:50] excuse me it's a way of justifying our
[21:52] actions to ourselves to remove our
[21:54] brains natural inhibitions that are
[21:56] there to prevent us from having behaving
[21:58] poorly towards others it means we can
[21:59] build a thought pattern that allows us
[22:02] to act in a way that our moral compass
[22:03] would normally prevent
[22:06] so that's that's the five that came from
[22:09] other writers I'm adding six and seven
[22:12] you blame others because you come out
[22:13] looking good
[22:16] self-righteous
[22:17] talking about other people makes us feel
[22:19] better about ourselves
[22:21] if we can tell what they did we don't
[22:23] look so bad
[22:25] that's why people talk about other
[22:27] people many times and God convict us all
[22:29] I'm guilty of it
[22:32] may we all do you think that I'm
[22:34] preaching that someone no no no no no
[22:35] I'm preaching to every one of us here
[22:37] this morning
[22:38] number seven reason you do is you're
[22:41] more interested in being right
[22:43] than the full truth or Oneness with that
[22:46] person
[22:47] relationship must not be that important
[22:49] if you're always trying to put the blame
[22:52] on somebody else and not own up to it
[22:54] yourself you're more interested in
[22:55] looking out for yourself than the other
[22:57] person
[22:58] you're happy to hold on to a half truth
[23:00] then whole truth thus
[23:02] if you have hold on to half truth
[23:04] instead of pursue the whole truth thus
[23:07] half victories and not full victories
[23:09] God himself is not to blame for your
[23:13] problems bring your problems to the Lord
[23:15] and admit you're wrong
[23:18] you'll never be able to use it on
[23:21] Judgment Day to stand there and say but
[23:22] they did me wrong and this happened in
[23:24] this preacher and nor did you know about
[23:26] this situation it'll never stand up in
[23:29] court on the other side because at the
[23:31] end of the day it's about you and the
[23:33] word can you say Amen in this Bible
[23:36] there's prophets that Satan condemned
[23:38] and spoke against and tore down and
[23:40] fought against and guess what the truth
[23:43] marched on and they're still in this
[23:45] Bible and we're still feeding on it
[23:47] Satan I want to remind you you can never
[23:50] destroy the truth of God's word
[23:54] do it
[23:57] and so I can use that to say in
[23:59] situations sometimes when I'm counseling
[24:01] you
[24:02] be patient
[24:03] because the truth will always come out
[24:07] God is a Defender Of Truth
[24:12] the hardest thing is to wait till it
[24:13] comes out
[24:15] we want to act
[24:17] quickly
[24:20] that the truth is marching on
[24:22] you can't destroy this message you can't
[24:24] destroy the prophets that they came from
[24:26] God you can't destroy the influence of
[24:28] it you can't take children and Sons and
[24:31] Daughters of God and cause you can't do
[24:34] it you can't Satan you couldn't do it
[24:37] throughout Generations you can't do it
[24:39] today the truth is marching on can you
[24:42] say that why am I saying that because
[24:44] the way that we can live life is to be
[24:48] lovers of Truth and waiting till the
[24:51] truth comes out
[24:53] because the truth
[24:56] will set you free
[24:58] Julia Ward Howe 1819-1910
[25:02] gave the United States and the world
[25:04] some of the most inspirational words
[25:06] ever written and she penned The Battle
[25:07] Hymn of Republic public I don't know if
[25:09] you have that sister Genie up there she
[25:11] penned The Battle Hymn of Republic in
[25:13] November of 1861 during a wartime tour
[25:17] of Washington DC
[25:19] As Americans realize with Gloom that the
[25:23] seven month old Civil War would be
[25:25] longer darker and deadlier than it was
[25:29] anticipated
[25:31] so she's right there in the middle of it
[25:33] she's watching she's watching the
[25:34] campfire she's watching the things and
[25:36] they realize this isn't going to be over
[25:37] anytime School anytime soon this is
[25:39] going to be a fight it's going to be a
[25:40] fight a lot of lives are going to be
[25:42] lost and they knew that they knew
[25:44] thousands of lives one of the worst wars
[25:46] ever and more lives lost than just about
[25:48] any other war and they knew it and it
[25:50] was coming but you know what the fight
[25:51] was over
[25:52] you know what the fight was over the
[25:54] truth
[25:56] that all men are created equal
[26:00] but there's gonna have to be a fight
[26:03] there's going to have to be men give
[26:05] their lives for truth
[26:07] how many you know your freedom today
[26:09] wasn't free
[26:12] she pinned this song house Masterpiece
[26:14] has been called America's fight song
[26:17] Glory Glory Hallelujah his truth is
[26:20] marching on
[26:22] it's been called the fight song it's
[26:24] lyrics inspired the United States this
[26:25] spiritual resolve and sacrifice the
[26:28] words tell the biblical heroic story of
[26:30] the Union Soldiers marching to their
[26:31] death in the Name of Christ devanque
[26:34] slavery
[26:35] so they're Marching In The Name of
[26:36] Christ and her songs in the lyrics we
[26:39] won't go through all of them
[26:43] their lyrics intertwine with scripture
[26:46] especially when she says the word as he
[26:49] died to make men holy we die to make one
[26:51] free it's a link between what Christ has
[26:54] done for us spiritually and what we have
[26:56] to do in war sometimes to fight for a
[26:59] truth and lives are lost and so this is
[27:02] all intermingled and it says the words
[27:04] tell the biblically
[27:06] um heroic story of Union Soldiers
[27:09] marching to their death in the Name of
[27:11] Christ to Vanquish
[27:13] slavery as he died to make men holy let
[27:17] us die to make men free his truth is
[27:20] marching on blaming others will only
[27:23] bind you
[27:24] but the truth will set you free
[27:27] fighting is okay if you're fighting to
[27:29] get to the truth
[27:31] not fighting one another and against one
[27:34] another but we rest that the truth will
[27:37] always win
