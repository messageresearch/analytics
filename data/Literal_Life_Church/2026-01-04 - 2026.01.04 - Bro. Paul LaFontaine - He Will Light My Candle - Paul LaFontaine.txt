What we're singing and that's just the way it happens, right? This is the first time I've seen them all week pretty much. Solomon conclude it all is vanity and now my heart believes that it is true. Took me all this time to find reality that all I ever really want is you. All that really counts. All that's really true. All that really matterers, Lord, is you. Everything to gain, nothing else to lose. All I ever really want is you. So take the grandest thing you know that this life can give and weigh it with eternity bright side. One thing I have learned in all this life I live that there is truly nothing good but God. How many will agree this morning? You're all that really counts. All that's really true. All that really matterers, Lord, is you. Everything to gain, nothing else to lose. All I ever really want is you. All that really counts. All that's really true. &gt;&gt; All that's really true. &gt;&gt; All that matters. &gt;&gt; All that really matters. All &gt;&gt; is you is you. Everything together mountain all I ever want &gt;&gt; it's just you. All I ever really want is you. All I ever really want is you. That's my design. Is that your design? Hallelujah. Well, I'm not giving up. No, no, no. I'm not turning around. By the grace of God, I'm going to wear a shining crown someday. And I'll keep holding on, holding on to the nail scar. I'm not giving up. No, I'll do it on you. Sing it with us now. Tell the devil, "I'm not giving up." No, no, no. I'm not turning around. By the grace of God, I'm going to wear a shining crown. Someday I'll holding on, holding on to the nail star. I'm not giving up. know I'll be pulling on. I've been walking through the valley through this spell of tears and at times I've even questioned even if my Lord is near and many times that old devil he says why not turn around you can't get any further because of or just losing ground, but I'm not. &gt;&gt; Somebody tell them this morning, I'm not turning around. By the grace of God, I'm going to wear a shining crown. Someday I'll be holding on, holding on to the sky. Well, I'm not giving up. know I'll be going on now. Would you mind to tell me? Cuz there's been something bothering me. Why is it that old or devil, he just won't let God's children be laed and determined to get right in the way and lead us from the way of life and lead our soul? Somebody standing. I'm not giving up. No, no, no. I'm not turning around. By the grace of God, I'm going to wear a shining crown. Someday I'll keep holding on, holding on to their scar. I'm not giving up. No. I'm not to give it up and I'm not sure right. I'm going to keep holding on, holding on to the nail head. Oh, I'm not giving up. No, I'll keep going on. I'm not giving up. I'm not turning around right. I'm going to keep holding on, holding on to the next hand. Oh, I'm not giving up. No, I'll keep going. Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's give our Lord. They want to continue doing that. They want to keep singing that one. Praise the Lord. I love to tell the devil. I'm not giving up. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's a good New Year's resolution. &gt;&gt; Amen. Doesn't matter what happens, what comes our way. We're not going to give up. It's because something within us. Praise the Lord. Doesn't matter what you're facing this morning. Make that confession. You know, I've appreciated the last few days. My daughter, uh, she's in the hospital and some high blood pressure and she's got the baby coming. So, I ask for your prayers for her in Washington. My wife is with her today. But I appreciate her confession. Uh I don't know if I've taught her that, but I know the word teaches us to keep that confession. Everything's going to be right. The Lord's going to bring us through. I said you hold that confession, God. We praise the Lord. Amen. Hope you didn't mind us singing this morning. That's what happens when there's no specials. That's what happens is you stuck with us to sing it. So, that's what happens here. Praise. &gt;&gt; Well, happy new year to you all. God bless you. It's great to have you in the service and and just feel his presence and uh we're looking forward to what the Lord has in mind for us. I hope you are looking forward because he always goes above and beyond our expectations. He's a wonderful God. Amen. Can you stand today and let's read if you would in Psalms chapter 18 and we'll just read a verse of scripture together and come to the most important part of all of our lives is that we take time in the word of God to be able to get revelation from him to be able to live Psalms chapter 18 we'll read Psalms 18 verse um 25. Psalms 18 verse 25. This is one of the scriptures here is what we had engraved in your gift that we gave you. I wanted this to kind of set a theme for the year and you'll find that verse here. We appreciate brother Henry doing those for us, carving those into the wood and also a candle. Sister Miriam doing the candles. But we took the one scripture from this area. Psalms 18 and verse 25 says, "With the merciful, thou wilt show thyself merciful. With an upright man, thou wil show thyself upright." So there's a response from the Lord. Um if someone uh offers something to to God then he responds back in verse 26. With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure and with the forward thou will show thyself forward. For thou wilt save the afflicted people but will bring down high looks. &gt;&gt; Thou will save the afflicted people but will bring down high looks. And the next verse is what we gave you in that gift. For thou the Lord will light my candle. The Lord my God will enlighten my darkness. So if there is afflicted, if there's darkness, if there's anything, God, what will he do? He'll light our candle. &gt;&gt; God wants to light your candle. &gt;&gt; Amen. And as we heard last Sunday, as we were uh just hearing our brother Steve last here Sunday really just preaching in such a wonderful way to show us that the mystery is Christ in you the hope of glory. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; So God wants to take this light and this word and light your candle. And whenever we move out of depending on a church, depending on I'm in the message, depending on I'm a certain a part of I'm part of a group. Whenever we start lean that way, we get away from the mystery that God wants to express himself in you. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; And he wants to light your candle. Can you say amen? And that light will shine, that revelation, that light, that understanding will shine into not only your own dark darkness, but the people that you come to and the darkness that you come into. It only takes one little candle. It's not how big the candle is. It's how powerful the light is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this is a powerful light. &gt;&gt; Father, we pray you'll bless anoint us today. We thank you, Lord, for bringing us into this new year. We thank you for the blessings of the retreat this week and the fellowship with all the young people. And we pray, Father, as we set our directions, many may be sitting down, writing out their goals, and just praying, Lord, asking us to be better representatives of of your love, Lord, and your light of this hour. We pray, Father, as we do that, that you'd come with your Holy Spirit. That may it not just be mechanical or something we write down, but let it be by revelation. Let it be something from the inside out, Lord, that would be able to change us and also to change others. Help us and give us strength in each thing, Lord. And as the song said, we're not giving up, Father, because you've put something within us that will rise above every situation. We commit the situations and we commit our trials. We commit, Lord, the new year to you. We ask it in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. The recent service we had a couple weeks ago in talking about the Christmas message was talking about light and darkness. And um we learned that Jesus uh manifested is to bring light to any darkness in any age in any time. Uh when you have Jesus manifested, the person of Christ manifested, he is there in order to shine light in the darkness that's already there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the manifestation of Jesus Christ. Uh and whatever interpretation we have of him, even if it's a historical Jesus that you've been presented with, uh we don't want a historical Jesus. We want a a Jesus that when he manifests his word, it manifests light and it brings darkness within us or darkness to this world. If darkness is still there, if darkness remains, then the light of this word has not broke through yet. I would say that to you kindly. But if if darkness is still in your life, that shows that Jesus has not manifested himself for you in the way that he could. Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh because he is light, the word is light and he is he wants to manifest himself that way to drive away any dark any darkness that's there. If there was a a direction that I could give the church for this coming year, uh I would just point us in this direction that it would be the evening light that God has sent us. that from the evening message and the evening messenger of Christ. It is what he has provided in order to enlighten uh your darkness first and then it's not just I don't want to stay there because as the scripture says he'll light my candle and he'll drive away my darkness but then it's not just to drive away our darkness within us but it is a light that is to be expressed to drive away the darkness around you. Now, we was telling the young people that uh in one of the devotions this week that that you will go into schools and you will go into a job and you will go into areas that I will never get into. The rest of the people won't get into. And Jesus wants to come into that area. And guess who he's doing it through? He's bringing light &gt;&gt; to that job, to that place. Light would never get there unless you were there. And you know, people think, "I'm there for a job. I'm there for a promotion. I can't wait for a promotion. I'm there for a paycheck. You're not believers are never there for just a paycheck. We are to be the light of the world. Light my candle so that where I walk into, no one else can get there except you. &gt;&gt; And so we cannot be carnal-minded that we're just there for a job or just there to make friends. But we are there to carry because we are carriers of this light of the last days. This evening light is not somewhere out here and not even in books and tapes. this evening light that he promised is to be in us and shining brightly. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So it is it is this light that's within us to that takes away our darkness first. And I might say this is that you should allow that light to drive your darkness away first. Cuz you can't be a proper witness if you still have some darkness within you. Say Lord let this revelation of the word for the last days, this evening light. Let it shine on all the areas of my life that I would be hiding. &gt;&gt; Christians can hide things sometimes. Christians can have things for years and they look good at church, but they still have some dark areas in their life. And so the first thing say, "Lord, let this revealed word of the last days, let it shine so deeply in me that it would drive away my darkness." But then when it does, then we we want to see the light have an effect on the darkness that's around us and around others that we're coming in contact with. And so we learn that to have light is to have understanding. Light is revelation. Light is understanding. And one of the understandings we have is the understanding of the times that we live in. This present darkness that we live in. Because darkness in every age is a little bit different. Sometimes it's way different than the other ages. Our darkness today is a different darkness than what they dealt with in the early age, in the early days of Christ, in the early days of the church. So our darkness is different than other times. And also our light and our revelation is different because our light, our evening light is meant to come up against the darkness of this evening and this evening time and this last days. Darkness changes. So we live in a different darkness. And so our light is to meet the darkness of our age. &gt;&gt; And so now we realize that that that we cannot affect the darkness around us for this age if we're living in the light of another age. &gt;&gt; WE CANNOT BE DEPENDING ON A HISTORICAL JESUS. &gt;&gt; We can't just look ABOUT JESUS OF NAZARETH 2,000 years ago that was on the shores of Galilee. I love to read about that. But today I know that I KNOW THE JESUS THAT WALKED THOSE SHORES of Galilee through the word. I know him for this day. AND YOU CANNOT USE AN HISTORICAL JESUS to shine light on this darkness for this day. IT HAS TO BE PRESENT TRUTH, PRESENT LIGHT that he's shining now that affects the darkness. &gt;&gt; That's why you say a lot you see a lot of people claiming Christianity, but they live dark lives. They're still in darkness because the power of the light of the hour has not come to them yet. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Hallelujah. So, how crucial is it then that we know the time that we're living in and understand the times we live in so that we can meet the challenge of the darkness that we're in now? How crucial is it that we know the time? There was a people in the Old Testament and they marked them. They said that they were men of understanding. They were men of understanding. We need to be a people of understanding. We need to understand to meet the challenge for this hour. And spiritual ignorance will get us into trouble. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In this hour, spiritual ignorance, and I say that because all ignorance can get us into trouble, but especially spiritual ignorance. Brother Rap was talking a couple one of the sessions there at retreat and he was talking about this generation seeking answers to their questions and their identity. He was talking about identity. And so most of the generation is borrowing or taking their answers to their identity from the internet, from social media, from everybody else, from professors, wherever, whatever source because they haven't come to the true source to find their true identity. Every young person needs to go to the word of God to find their true identity. And what happens if you don't? You will be given another identity. &gt;&gt; You will be handed because we as human beings, we receive everybody else's word on it. So, you'll take your identity off of social media. You'll take your identity. The problem is, and I'm I'm quoting what uh he said, is that uh a a generation that takes their answers to this huge question, who am I? The question, who am I? And if you take the world's answers, it can only be destruction to your life. Now, I I don't mean to be a doubter, but I'm telling you the truth. IF YOU TAKE THEIR ANSWERS, it it looks good, but it'll LEAD TO DESTRUCTION. THAT'S why we have so much suicide related to social media now &gt;&gt; because they're hungry for identity. And so if you keep going that direction, destruction is down the road. Suicidal spirits and demons down THE ROAD BECAUSE GOD HAS NOT CALLED YOU TO LIVE SOME OTHER IDENTITY. Some from the world or some from HOLLYWOOD OR SOME FROM SOCIAL MEDIA. HE'S CALLED YOU TO FIND YOUR IDENTITY IN CHRIST. AMEN. &gt;&gt; And all those identities can lead to destruction. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So we are a generation seeking for that answer of who am I? And if we take the answers from the So now I want to go to some prophecies because a couple weeks ago we talked about Christ being born 2,000 years ago. But look at this light. Look at this prophecy bringing it up to our day now. Zechariah 14 and verse 6. This is the promise that we can believe for our time. And it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall not be clear nor dark, but it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord, not day nor night, but it shall come to pass that at the evening time it shall be light. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So I hope I don't have to explain that TOO MUCH. THAT'S A prophecy for our time. Remember I said we got to understand our times. So in understanding our time, it says that it shall be not light, not clear, nor completely dark. Uh the prophet called it a dismal day. We live spiritually in a dismmo day. So it's confusing if we're talking about understanding. It's confusing. It's dism. But we have a promise. In the evening time, it shall be light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; He'll give us understanding. He'll give us eyes to see. And and so then another prophecy in Isaiah 60 and verse one. Another one for our day is arise, shine, for thy light is come. And the glory of the Lord has risen upon who? Upon thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people. But the Lord shall arise upon thee, and the glory shall be seen upon thee, and the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of THY RISING. NOTICE HOW THE LIGHT, IT'S not something we're looking at out here, but it's thy light. They'll come to thy light. The the the the glory will arise upon thee. Can you say amen? That's why I can say the Lord can wants TO LIGHT YOUR CANDLE BECAUSE THE LIGHT IS NOT IN BOOKS AND TAPES AND ALL THESE OTHER THINGS. IT'S TO BE LIVING IN YOU AND SHINING IN YOU. &gt;&gt; And everything about the evening light at the end time is related to that light. WHERE IS IT? WHERE IS THIS EVENING LIGHT? WELL, WE KNOW IT CAME INITIALLY THROUGH THE WORD. BUT HOW DOES IT SHINE EVERY DAY? THAT UNDERSTANDING, THAT REVELATION, THAT LOVE, WHATEVER IT IS THAT GOD PROVIDED IN THE EVENING LIGHT, WHERE IS IT? IT HAS to be in his people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You can invite people to church. But if they don't come to church, you're you say, "Lord, light my candle." &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; With this light of the last days and this evening time. Praise the Lord. Are you with me this morning? &gt;&gt; Seems kind of quiet here this morning. Maybe too much pumpkin pie over the holidays. I don't know. Notice all of you know that Jesus said, "I'm the light of the world." How many would say, "Amen. Jesus said he was the light of the world." &gt;&gt; Everybody knows that. Everybody can say amen to that. But did you ever hear too many sermons on when he turned around before he left this earth? And he says, "Now ye are the light of the world." &gt;&gt; So everything that he was now is split into his body. And they're NOT GOING TO GET IT through his body. They're going to get it through you. ANYTHING OF GOD IN THE LAST DAYS WILL COME THROUGH HIS PEOPLE. THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET COULD SAY SHE IS THE FINAL VOICE TO THE FINAL AGE. WHO? THE PROPHET. NO, HE WAS USED INITIALLY. BUT YOU SEE, SHE'S THE FINAL VOICE &gt;&gt; TO THE FINAL AGE. &gt;&gt; SHE'S THE ONE SHINING THE LIGHT. WHERE IS IT? SHE'S CARRYING IT. &gt;&gt; She's speaking it. She's living it. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. SO, YE are the light of the world at the end time especially. He lights your candle. And that means his light is in you. Where is it? In you. Not in a church, not in a book, not even in our Bibles. It's in you. It's Christ in you. As we were, as I said her last Sunday, anything less than Christ in you is becoming denominational. I'm going to say it again. Anything less than the mystery of Christ being in you is becoming denominational. &gt;&gt; Cuz we'll get a crutch to lean on. I'm in the message. A crutch to lean on I'm lean on my parents. &gt;&gt; A crutch to lean on. I'll get in because of this or I I I I'm in a part of the message group. BROTHER PAUL, QUIT PREACHING ON ME. I GO TO A MESSAGE CHURCH. ISN'T THAT ENOUGH? NO, IT'S NOT ENOUGH. &gt;&gt; IT BECOMES DENOMINATIONAL WHEN YOU DEPEND ON THAT. THIS MYSTERY COMES DOWN TO CHRIST IN YOU INTERPRETING IT EVERY DAY, LIVING IT OUT EVERY DAY. &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING THAT HE SENT US. I THANK GOD FOR IT. BUT I'M WAITING uh uh my LIFE IN MY LIFE IN YOUR LIFE. LET ME SEE it all manifested in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In my life. Praise the Lord. It's Christ in you. It's your candle that he wants to light. Why? You will carry it into places that he can't get to in his own body and you I can't get to. You'll carry that light into areas and his light will get there through you. And he has confidence in what he puts in you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There was one uh Christian leader who said all the darkness in the world. Now, if you want to put that gift that we gave you back up, just one candle. You're just one candle. But this one writer said one he said all the darkness in the world cannot extinguish the light of a single candle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I got to thinking about that. How powerful &gt;&gt; is that light if it's been lit by God &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; that if you take it into a room of darkness there is no way that darkness within itself can knock that light out &gt;&gt; one single candle &gt;&gt; why because it's not you &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; if he lights it him &gt;&gt; and darkness will never ever be more powerful than the light &gt;&gt; unless Unless you let it, &gt;&gt; unless you don't let him light your candle. Unless you say, "I'm just going to live a life of religion. I'm just going to live a life. I'm in the message. I'm I'm fine." That something greater's GOT TO HAPPEN. HE HAS TO LIGHT YOUR CANDLE. &gt;&gt; I'M ONLY 14 YEARS OLD. IT DOESN'T MATTER. YOU SHOULD SAY, "LORD, FILL ME WITH THE HOLY GHOST. LIGHT MY CANDLE. I KNOW YOU LIT MY PARENTS. I KNOW I CAN TELL BROTHER PAUL'S HIS FIRE IS LIT. BUT LORD, LIGHT MY CANDLE THIS YEAR. &gt;&gt; WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO FOR THE KINGDOM of God?" &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that doesn't necessarily mean what you would do in the church and your your gifts and all that. It's what does he want me to do for his kingdom as he lights my lights my candle lights my life up. Can you say amen? So he said that the world darkness in the world cannot extinguish the the light of a single candle. If it goes out, if the light goes out, it won't be because of the darkness. You know, a candle, it won't go out because you're standing there in the darkness. The darkness won't do it. It w I If it goes out, it won't be because of the darkness. Light is always stronger than darkness. Other things can stop it, but not darkness. Isn't that a revelation? Remember that &gt;&gt; other things can try to blow out the light, but darkness can't affect a single candle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it's him. Light is always stronger. Other things can stop it if it is connected to the source. And you know the story about even in the Bible where there has to be oil in the lamp. There are components to a candle and there not many components but all those components have to be there for the candle to be lit and the candle to keep lighting. So it's it's not the darkness that affects it but all the co components have to be in place. And if there's oil in the lamp it will burn and it will continue to burn. Now if there's no oil in the lamp it won't continue to burn. So that wasn't the darkness is that you DIDN'T GET THE OIL. &gt;&gt; OIL IS the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; And it had to THE WICK HAS TO STAY LAYING IN THE HOLY SPIRIT ALL THE TIME TO SHOOT THAT THROUGH THE WAX THAT'S THERE. THE WAX the the wick uh all these are components of a a candle. I'm certainly not an expert, but the wax the fuel the wick wax is part of the fuel. And so all those components coming together, the wax has a fuel in it. THE WICK DRAWS UP THAT fuel and brings it up to the flame and keeps it going. I would only SAY THIS, DARKNESS CAN'T KNOCK IT OUT, BUT DON'T MESS WITH THE COMPONENTS. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; YOU START MESSING WITH THE COMPONENTS, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TROUBLE. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT A PROBLEM that darkness is the devil did this, the darkness, and they did that. NO. IF YOU'RE LIT BY GOD AND STAY LIT BY GOD, THAT DARKNESS WILL NEVER overcome you. &gt;&gt; YOU WILL SHINE IT in the worst darkness. &gt;&gt; ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT. SO MAYBE YOU'VE MESSED with the components. You mess with the wax or the fuel, the wax has a fuel in it. The wick draws it up to the flame. Don't mess with the components. Keep your vessel filled with the Holy Ghost. Keep your wick or your L trimmed. And that to me means sanctification. WE WE CONSTANTLY SANCTIFY our lives AND TRIM THAT WICK. CAN YOU SAY, "MAN, Sister Miam even gave us a little stick to trim the the the wick because we have to keep that trim." That's sanctification. &gt;&gt; Don't laugh at me. I'm using all the wrong terms. I'm sorry. I'm sure I am. But get my point? Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not a candle expert here, &gt;&gt; but you know, uh, you you you got to keep your vessel filled with the Holy Ghost and you got to keep your wick trimmed in sanctification. That's a life of sanctification. Sanctification isn't when you just first come to the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's a lifestyle. &gt;&gt; And staying on fire for God is a lifestyle. It's it's something that should continue on. But you can't do that unless you would keep your lamps trimmed and glowing and left keep your life sanctified. Something's going to be affected if you start not living a sanctified life. Well, I've been serving the Lord 20 years and then you turn to something dark secret thing. You start doing that, you're going to affect the components of the light burning. &gt;&gt; You did it. The darkness didn't do it. You did it. &gt;&gt; You mess with the components. And so Jesus said in the evening, now he gives a parable of our time. EVERY TIME I KEEP REFERRING to the evening, the in the in the evening time there shall be light. I want to keep referring because you have to understand our time, our light and our time. And we have an evening light that's shining. And Jesus WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE THE RAPTURE AND THE BRIDEGROOM COMES, THIS IS WHAT HE TALKED ABOUT. Keep your lamps trimmed. There was 10 virgins and the only thing they realized at the last minute, they were all trimming their lamps. So in other words, all of them were sanctifying their lives. They had a sincerity. I want to serve God. The problem was is ones realized they didn't have any oil. &gt;&gt; They didn't have the true Holy Ghost. And that's the fuel. You can't have your candle lit without the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Oh, I should be getting more amens. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; I don't care how OLD YOU ARE. YOU CAN'T MAKE IT IN THIS DARKNESS without the true new birth experience of the Holy Ghost. And we say, "What do I do, brother Paul?" Well, the father's ready to grant that to you as soon as you ask sincerely from your heart. He's like our like the earthly fathers. He's nothing like our earthly fathers. But what won't our fathers if a child needs something do everything they can to get that? And Jesus said, "How much the more will he give the Holy Ghost TO THEM THAT ASK HIM?" &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO WANT IT. &gt;&gt; SAY, "WELL, I'm a pretty good Christian." AND NO, NO, I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT. I'M SAYING, "HAVE YOU EVER SAID, "LORD, CHANGE ME. FILL ME WITH A TRUE GENUINE NEW BIRTH OF THE HOLY GHOST. Have you ever said that? Have you ever come to an altar in your life say this has got to start first? I need the OIL AND NOBODY'S MAKING THE RAPTURE WITHOUT THE OIL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Cuz they ended up scared and they said, "Oh, give us some of your oil." No, they said, "No, I've got enough just enough Holy Ghost to make it through myself. Go to them that buy." And guess what? When they went to buy the oil, it was too late. The bridegroom came. That's a serious message the Lord has given us is that you better have your lamps shrimped and you better have oil in your lamp. &gt;&gt; He didn't say make more money before the rapture comes, bridegroom comes, you if you can do that, praise the Lord. He didn't say give more in the plate and if you can do it, go ahead and give it. We We need it here. We got a roof coming up and different things. But he didn't say that. What we need to do is trim our lamps and make sure that we have the oil. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he talked about uh they missed it. They missed the oil when he came and they were still trying to get the oil when he came. Many people will do the works of sanjification. It's great and I appreciate it. But with no oil does no good. You must be born again. Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed? &gt;&gt; Oh, I believe. I I'm a a good person. No, no. I'm Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed? That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he's got confidence in the fire that he lights &gt;&gt; and no darkness can stop it. Can you say &gt;&gt; amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh even Satan if he blows it out and you let him blow it out or you blow it out yourself because a light can be blown out except for these new candles that came about 20 30 years ago. And I love those candles because it plays such a trick because when everybody thinks the candle is out, you know, you got whatever you got now. They don't even have they don't even sell enough candles now for my birthday cake. But when you have 10 or 15, you ever been tricked that somebody slipped in the candles and you're going and everybody's excited and you go, you ever watch little kids do that? It's a lot of fun. And they do it and they get all the candles and everybody goes, "Yeah, woo! You did it. You did it." And they're sitting there going, "I'M SO PROUD of myself. I was so proud of myself." And then all of a sudden all the candles begin to light again &gt;&gt; and they keep blowing on them and they won't go out. I think it's a modern, you know, the last 23 years a modern thing. I think it's cool, but I think it speaks of the light. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That the Lord would put in somebody. &gt;&gt; Satan may try to blow it out. &gt;&gt; You may blow it out. But if it's his light, it's going to come back on again. If it's the true thing, it's going to come back on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE LIGHT OF GOD. IF IT'S THE TRUE LIGHT OF GOD, THEN YOU DARKNESS DOESN'T DO ANYTHING TO IT. IF IT GETS BLOWN OUT FOR A WHILE, THEN GOD, IF IT'S HIS LIGHT, HE LIGHTS THAT BACK UP AGAIN. IT COMES BACK AGAIN. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you today, if Satan's blown your candle out, you just wait a minute because you just say, "Lord, is this is THIS TRUE?" JUST WATCH THE LORD COME IN AND THAT THING light up again. &gt;&gt; It might you might need that to happen. HOW MANY RAISE YOUR HAND SAY? I NEED HIM TO DO THAT IN MY LIFE. I NEED HIM TO LIGHT MY CANDLE. WELL, IT'S ALREADY LIT. IT'S JUST SOMETHING BLEW IT OUT. &gt;&gt; But we need these candles shining bright in the darkness we live in. &gt;&gt; We don't need compromisers. We don't need people that's just religion. We don't need people to put religion on the outside. WE NEED THE true light of the last days, THE EVENING LIGHT, LIGHTING OUR INDIVIDUAL CANDLE, &gt;&gt; AND TO KEEP IT bright and shining. &gt;&gt; This may be simple to you this morning, but listen, this is what the Lord has given us. HE'S GIVEN US LIGHT IN the last days. &gt;&gt; IN THE EVENING TIME, IT SHALL BE LIGHT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YEAH. &gt;&gt; So now, and you know, Satan can be so proud when he blows it out, but even he's surprised. &gt;&gt; You know, that whole birthday party all there, and everybody's surprised it all comes back on. Satan is surprised when your flame comes back on so quickly. &gt;&gt; He doesn't like it. I thought I blew that out. It was over. No, this is a whole new lighting in the end time. This is a whole new candle, Satan. &gt;&gt; That's right. You're dealing with a light that's shining so bright. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're dealing with something that you think you can blow out, &gt;&gt; but you can't if it's the true light of God. &gt;&gt; I really do believe that keeping our lamps trimmed and our vessel full is important. Would you agree with me? &gt;&gt; I believe there needs to be a stability. And you hold on to that word because we're going to get to it in a minute here. A stability and a consistency. a stability, staying in the word and resting in that word continually every day. I believe stability in the word and resting in it to me is the real revival today. &gt;&gt; You know, Paul said, "Having done all to stand, stand therefore." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, there's a glory, there's a there's a power, there's a strength today in just standing. &gt;&gt; Everybody's falling, &gt;&gt; but it's a miracle when somebody just stands through all of this. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Having done all to stand, stand therefore. You put the armor of God on. BUT LISTEN, JUST STANDING in the midst of winds and storms and everything. Just the consistent stability. You know what? I'D LIKE TO SEE MORE OF STABILITY IN PEOPLE'S LIVES. STABILITY IN SERVING THE LORD. NOT THEY'RE UP AND DOWN AND ONE DAY THEY FEEL THEY'RE SAVED, ONE DAY THEY'RE NOT. THEY'RE OUT OF CHURCH FOR 6 MONTHS, THEN THEY COME BACK AND THEY'RE SUPER SPIRITUAL TO EVERYBODY. LORD, LET US SEE SOME CONSISTENCY. LET US SEE SOME FAITHFULNESS. LET US SEE THE LIGHT SHINING EVERY DAY WHETHER YOU'RE AT CHURCH OR NOT. LET US SEE PEOPLE THAT ARE CONSISTENT TO COME TO THE HOUSE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; I've seen enough instability in the world. I don't need to see that in church people. WE NEED TO BE STABLE IN THE WORD. And can you say amen? Rest, peaceful, STANDING IN THE WORD. THE MIRACLE TODAY IS NOT SOMETHING SUPER SPIRITUAL. &gt;&gt; The miracle is the bride will still be standing. &gt;&gt; Somebody ought to say, "Praise the Lord." WE LOOK FOR MIRACLES. AND GOD DOES MIRACLES. HE'S DOING THEM THIS WEEK. BUT LISTEN, THE REAL MIRACLE FOR THE BRIDE IS SHE'S THE ONE THAT'S LESS STANDING AFTER ALL OF THIS. &gt;&gt; EVERYBODY ELSE FELL, &gt;&gt; BUT SHE'S just s standing. And it's his grace that she's still standing. &gt;&gt; May you be encouraged this morning that the miracle is not just an outward manifestation of emotion every year at camp. &gt;&gt; But let me see some stability in your life. Let me see that fire burning every day. When you're not around camp, when you're not around all the young people to encourage you, when you're by yourself, when you're alone by yourself in your room, is the candle shining there by yourself? &gt;&gt; Is there consistency? Is there stability? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll get to that word again in a minute. I think there's a steady burning of a candle, and that's better than some bright light that fizzles out after every camp &gt;&gt; looking for consistency and faithfulness. So now I want to take this a bit deeper if you'd open your Bibles to Genesis 18. Uh some wonderful things here that the Lord showed us last night. Genesis 18. You remember we talked about Sarah and she took a long time and she coming to the promise of God. Abraham came to it but she was kind of slow and coming to it and then we realized Sarah finally caught it. She caught the the same faith of and seeing the same thing as Abraham. So that was wonderful. So I said last night I felt led to what's the next thing after Sarah catches that and after this this visitation with Elohim, these three angels, two angels that were going to go down to Sodom and one angel Abraham's calling Lord. Now he's in flesh. He's eating with Abraham. He's sitting down there eating with him and Abraham's calling him Lord. One of those was Lord. He didn't call three of them Lord. &gt;&gt; It was not a trinity. There was one. The other two were angels, but one of them was Lord. And he's meeting our father Abraham. How many believe we're the children of Abraham? &gt;&gt; So when we look at our father Abraham, he's having a special visitation of the son of man. And it's the Lord who is the son of man. And he's sitting there eating with him, reminding him, I'm going to give you your promise. Tell Sarah, I'm gonna give you your promise. It's all about his promise. But look what happens here now in this setting of the evening time. He was there in in the heat of the day at this meeting with him. But then as the evening goes on, then something else happens. And let's read it. Verse 16. And the men arose from then and looked towards Sodom and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way. So he kind of walks out of the way with them. And two of these angels are headed to Sodom. Does anybody know why they're headed to Sodom? because God has pronounced judgment and he's going to go down and check it out and judgment's going to come to Sodom because they had become sodomites. They had become in sin. They had become uh um filled with vile spirits without God. You turned to all kinds of things, homosexuals, lesbians, trans. You say, "You're saying that publicly?" Yes, I am. Because all you need to do is read your Bibles. When men get further away from God, that's the sin that comes in. It is a sin. It is an abomination to God. &gt;&gt; You say, "What about the people?" Well, I'll love the person, but God is not going to love you and let you stay the way you are. He's going to love you out of that spirit. &gt;&gt; It's an abomination to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so that's what Sodom WAS. NOW, DOESN'T THAT SHOW US THE TIME WE'RE living in? How many could say as Jesus said, "As it was in days of Sodom, so shall it be in the coming again of the Son of Man." So now we have the setting for our day. It's a Sodomite condition. It's Sodom and Gomorrah. Even our laws, some of them have been passed to cater to the Sodommites. &gt;&gt; And they keep continue to pressure that way. We're living in the days Jesus said of the evening time. And that is we're living in the midst of Sodom. &gt;&gt; Spiritually like Abraham, we're living on the mountain away from it. But remember, Lot went down there to try to help the people. And he's down there trying to work with them. And so, watch what happens. Now, listen to this. Abraham already has his promise. And that's a body change. His body's going to change. Sarah's body's going to change. And they're going to have a baby. And but watch the spirit of our father Abraham. And I'm asking you to check yourself and see if you have this &gt;&gt; because this is what's next after the son of man visits us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Seeing that Abraham, verse 17, the Lord said, "Shall I hide from Abraham this thing that I do?" Isn't that wonderful? The Lord says, "You know what? I'm going to do something, but I can't really hide it from my elect. &gt;&gt; Amen, Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you what I'm going to getting ready to go do. &gt;&gt; Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him. For I know Abraham, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment, that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he had spoken unto him. I want all the brothers and all the men and all the young men to keep that verse in front of you because this is what impressed God about Abraham. He had the promise, but one of the reasons God brought it to him is because I know him. I know him &gt;&gt; and he will command his children and his household after him well in the things of the Lord. He'll direct and be the leader in that family to direct them to the things of God. I trust him to do that. in this in the middle of Sodom Gomorrah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need men like that. &gt;&gt; We need young men not to get married until they have that strength in their life &gt;&gt; that he's going to command his household well. And he is going to actually be having a multi-generational vision that what I do now is going to affect the future of my family, &gt;&gt; my grandchildren. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The decisions I make now. And and God said, "I know him. I know Abraham. So, I'm going to share my secrets with him." And the Lord said, "Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorra is great, and because their sin is very grievous, I will go down now and see whether they have done alltogether according to the cry of it which has come up unto me, and if not, I will know." And the men turned their faces from then, and went toward Sodom. But Abraham stood yet before the Lord. So two of them head that direction. Abraham stood before the Lord. And Abraham drew near and said, "So now Abraham has his promise, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; His his body's going to change. He's going to have that baby. Him and Sarah, Jessica, he's got his promise of being in the rapture, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You think he's done? &gt;&gt; You think that's all he wants?" No. He's stepping near the Lord and before he goes, he's saying, "Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?" &gt;&gt; That's right, &gt;&gt; Perventure. There are 50 righteous within the city. Wil also destroy and not spare the space, the place for 50 righteous that are therein. Nobody is giving any hope for Sodom except &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; this light. &gt;&gt; Amen. of the evening time &gt;&gt; shining and saying to the Lord, "No, there's no hope for Sodom. There's no hope for Lot, for his family down there except for the prayer &gt;&gt; of Abraham." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; My friends, I I read that last night. I stand corrected because you know what Abraham's asking the Lord for? Just like brother Steve brought it up last Sunday, we've been here the last few months is that even when the judgments have already been pronounced, somebody who would rise and ask for grace, &gt;&gt; God will step in and do it. &gt;&gt; Brother Steve said Jonah that day, all these days, there's a mystery in scripture that says when judgment has been pronounced and friends, America, the world, judgment has already been pronounced. She's headed for tribulation and there's nothing we can do to stop it. But but he's actually asking the Lord if you find 50 righteous. &gt;&gt; And he's not asking for the 50. &gt;&gt; He's asking if there's 50 there, are you sure you want to destroy the whole thing? He's getting the Lord to promise &gt;&gt; to go against his judgment. &gt;&gt; WOW. &gt;&gt; WHAT KIND OF POWER IS IN THE light of a son and daughter of Abraham? BOY, HE MUST HAVE KNOWN HIS POSITION TO BE ASKING THE LORD THAT IF YOU FIND 50, I WANT YOU TO SPARE ALL OF THOSE SODOMITES. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm just going to be honest with you. I've not heard too many sermons about that in the message. And I'm not boasting. I'm doing I haven't preached too many. But we stop at our promise of the rapture. &gt;&gt; And the type does not show us stopping at our promise. &gt;&gt; It says we're reaching out and saying, "I'm concerned about destruction hitting these people." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What I've heard in our ranks is that sodomites, they had it coming to them. They deserve it. GOD'S BRINGING JUDGMENT ON THEM. THAT'S ALL TRUE. BUT THE SPIRIT OF ABRAHAM SAYS, "LORD, LORD, &gt;&gt; IS THERE SOME WAY? &gt;&gt; DON'T DESTROY THEM, LORD. &gt;&gt; WHY DO WE HAVE THIS THING IN OUR RATES THAT'S SO WILLING TO DITCH SOMEBODY ELSE? GIVE THEM UP. PUT THEM IN A CATEGORY. THEY'RE FINISHED. AND WE'RE GOING ON WITH THE WORD AND WE'RE IN OUR CONVENTION SHOUTING ABOUT THE WORD, BUT WE HAVE NO CARE OR HEART FOR SOMEBODY WHO'S A SODOMITE. I SAY, LORD, HELP US TO HAVE ENOUGH LIGHT AND GRACE THAT WE HAVE GRACE FOR A SODOMITE. GRACE FOR THE CONDITIONS OF DARKNESS, &gt;&gt; LIGHT TO SHINE THERE. &gt;&gt; PAUL, I can't even talk to that guy, his feminine feminine ways. Well, listen, you need something deeper in your life cuz you HAVE TO LOOK PAST THE SIN &gt;&gt; CUZ YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO SAY SOMETHING THAT THAT WOULD draw him out of that. &gt;&gt; He needs the Lord. &gt;&gt; He needs this light. &gt;&gt; It's up to him if he receives it, but it's up to you to have that kind of Abraham heart. Oh God, I'm standing in this position right now. If you could just spare this person from this demon power that he's under. It's not him, it's the demon. GOD, CAN YOU USE ME TO SAY SOMETHING? IF THERE'S 50, will you spare them? &gt;&gt; WE NEED TO GROW, FRIENDS, &gt;&gt; IN THE MESSAGE. WE'RE TOO CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT OTHER CHURCHES ARE THINKING. WE'RE TOO CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS WEARING. AND WE'RE WE'RE STUCK. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; AND YOU KNOW WHAT? WERE SELFFOCUSED. &gt;&gt; GOD DOES NOT WANT US TO BE SELFFOCUSED. OUR FATHER ABRAHAM, HE COULD HAVE BEEN SELFFOCUSED, BUT HE HAD A HEART FOR WHAT WAS GOING ON out there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, I wish the Lord give me words to say it this morning. He kept working on them. Verse 24, preventure there be 50 righteous within the city. Wil thou also destroyed uh not spare the place for the 50 righteous that are therein that be that be far from thee to do after this manner to slay the righteous with the wicked and that the righteous should be as the wicked that be far from thee? Shall not the judge of all of all the earth do right? &gt;&gt; You imagine he's talking to the Lord this way. &gt;&gt; You're you're the judge of the whole earth. Don't you want to do right in this? This seems a little bit injustice. &gt;&gt; Wow. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Lord said, "If I find in Sodom 50 righteous within the city, then I will spare all of the place &gt;&gt; for their sakes." &gt;&gt; He said, "I'll do it. I'll spare all of Sodom and Gomorrah from the fire and brimstone &gt;&gt; for you &gt;&gt; because you're asking." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What if we're the only hope? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; For those that are out there, Verse 27. And Abraham answered and said, "Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes." So, he's going to go further. And as he goes further, he gets a little bit embarrassed. And he keeps asking, but he said, "I'm just dust and ashes. Pre-adventure, there shall lack five of the 50 righteous. Wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five?" And he said, "If I find there 40 and five, I will not destroy it." And he spake unto him again and said, "Per adventure, there shall be 40 found there." And he said, 'I will do it for 40's sake. And he said unto him, "Oh, let not the Lord be angry with me, and I will speak. Prayer adventure, there shall be 30 found there." And he said, "I will not do it if I find 30." &gt;&gt; And he said, "Behold now, I'm sure that we don't catch the full depth of what's being happening here, &gt;&gt; but this is our father Abraham &gt;&gt; living a type of the bride of the last days. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In a Sodom Gomorra comm uh condition and has already had uh a a visitation of the son of man. We stand in that position. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is right. This is us in the scripture. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And the type says that Abraham's pleading &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; to hold back the judgment. &gt;&gt; The only one doing it. He said, "Oh Lord, be not angry with me and I speak, but this preventure 10 shall be found there." And he said, So he drew him down to 10 from 50 to 10. And I will not, he said, I will not destroy it for 10 sake. And the Lord went his way as soon as he had left communing with Abraham. And Abraham returned unto his place. He kept coming before the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. with his light that he already has. &gt;&gt; He's using his light. &gt;&gt; God has lit his candle with revelation. &gt;&gt; But what is he using it for now? Oh God, can somehow there be mercy for them out there? &gt;&gt; I don't hear no us no more. &gt;&gt; I don't hear we're Abraham's royal seed and we've got it. I don't hear any of that. &gt;&gt; I hear his whole focus is to appeal to Elohim &gt;&gt; that's visited him. Now that I've got you here, I'm pleading for my family. I'm pleading. &gt;&gt; I'm speaking on behalf of my family members. I'm speaking to you, Lord. Would you spare the whole thing if you find 10 righteous? And guess what? He didn't find 10. But the Bible says because he remembered Abraham, &gt;&gt; he spared Lot. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Read the story. &gt;&gt; Amen. He comes to his two son-in-laws and his son-in-laws. They say, "We got to get out of here. We got to go." Because his daughters were married. He said to his son-in-laws, "Get your let's get out of here." And son-in-laws as if he mocked them. It was a joke to them. We're not going. &gt;&gt; His daughters came with him, but not his son-in-laws. &gt;&gt; It speaks of families being broke up sometimes. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. because they're not seeing the mercies of God to lay their lives at the altar to he say he's reaching out a hand of mercy to me. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I wonder if those son-in-laws tried to influence their wives to stay. &gt;&gt; It's another sermon, but I'll tell you that's what was happening. Sodommites were trying to come in and take these angels even because they must have been they were in flesh and blood. Sodommites were trying to pervert Lot's own home. Remember, Lot was living there. He should have been living there, but he's living there. And the the the the sins of Sodom vexed his righteous soul daily. &gt;&gt; He wasn't doing anything about it, but he was there and he was vexed. So, because that little thing was there and because Abraham said it, he grabbed them and says, "Because of Abraham, grace is extended. Grab your daughters and your wife and head out of here and run towards the mountain &gt;&gt; because of Abraham." Now, I got to move along here. Uh, but there's there's a quote that I want to get to and then I'll bring this to a close. I don't want you to have the impression that I'm uh a long-winded preacher. One of my New Year's resolutions. Don't laugh, Michael. Um, look at some things he says here. Now, we're going to Yeah. Now, we're going to speak about evening light just for a moment. The Bible predicts. You still with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible predicts that there will come a time right at the closing time that the sun will come out and there will be an evening light. We all know that, don't we? We're we who are familiar with our message today from the Lord Jesus, we believe that there will be an evening light. And this evening light, of course, the great light will come when Jesus himself will be manifested here on earth or up in the heavens taking away his bride and then the millennium will set in. I want you to notice the distinction he makes in the great light. The evening light is different than the great light because the great light is when we go in a rapture and go in a millennium. &gt;&gt; But then he said then the million was said but we've got one of the most dreadful times to go through that ever laid before human beings. Now it said the day itself the day between that time will be kind of like oh like a dismal a dark day could not be called day or night in between that. Now remember notice this is the time that the son of man will be revealed. The revealing of the son of man. Now, the Son of Man was actually revealed potentially just for a few moments there, just before Sodom was burned. That's what I just read to you. Just before Sodom was burned, and he did burn it, by the way. Now, that man was Elohim. That was God. And Jesus is God. And God was revealed potentially right there for a few moments to talk to Abraham in the investigation judgment just for a little bit. The son of man was revealed. The son of man, Elohim. Do you see it, church? The son of man, Elohim, was revealed just for a few minutes. For the next morning, she was burned before the sun could come up again. So there can't be no organization left. Neither can there be any further advancement that what's going on right now for shall burn before the day breaks again. The revival is over. Stop right there. Did you see what he just said? &gt;&gt; There'll be no denomination officially. No organization. There's no time for another organization out of this &gt;&gt; and there can be any there can't be any further advancement than this revealing of the son of man to us. So listen, we're there. &gt;&gt; We're right here. We've had the revealing of the son of man. We're still having it even this morning. The revealing of the son of man. So we're right where Abraham stood just the day before destruction hits Sodom and Gomorrah. Tribulation sets in. That's where you're at. &gt;&gt; That's where we're at. And so just for a little bit, the son of man was revealed uh coming down here. There ain't he says I want just to notice the revival is over across the nation. There ain't going to be no more revivals. Now why? How could brother? How could you say that? &gt;&gt; Because it's not in the type. &gt;&gt; Before Sodom and Gomorra, it's not in THE TYPE. THAT'S WHY THE people don't know their Bibles in the types. They're out there saying there's going to BE A BREAK NATIONWIDE REVIVAL. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A WORLDWIDE revival and even you have temporary little things happen which I rejoice in. Charlie Kirk dying is is is created this hunger for God in the young people and they're coming by droves to church now. I say praise God. &gt;&gt; I don't mock that. I say praise the Lord. BUT THE REVIVALS THIS nation has had. WE'RE NOT IN THE TIME TO HAVE a big national revival. That is over. Why? It's not scripturally supposed to happen that way. We're in the days of tribulation setting in. So know where you're at. DON'T PREACH SOMETHING THAT'S NOT IN THE SCRIPTURE. &gt;&gt; DON'T PROMOTE A NATIONWIDE REVIVAL WHEN WE KNOW that's over. It's not in the scripture for that. We've had the visitation of the son of man and now we are standing here just before judgment. And so for a little bit the son of man was revealed. Oh, I always lose my place here. Oh yeah. So there's no more. He says um there'll be no organization left. Neither can there be any further advancement than what's going on right now. offer shall burn before the day breaks. The revival is over across the nation. There ain't going to be no more revivals, big sweeping revivals. This nation never received it. You might have an intellectual gathering, but I mean a real I mean a spiritual revival. We've seen all of it. I hope you're catching it. Listen now. I want you listen close where he goes. I'm saying it in such a way that I hope you get it. See, it's over. A fine minister said a while ago said, "Brother Brandham, IF I COULD JUST HAVE THE JOY OF THE LORD IN MY HEART." And what he's probably referring to is he come from Pentecost and he wanted that type of joy again. And he's saying, "Oh, IF I COULD JUST HAVE THE JOY IN MY HEART." I SAID, "SON, the revival is over." &gt;&gt; Wow. That seems just like it's discouraging. But no, what it is, it's recognizing the time you're in. &gt;&gt; I believe there's a revival, but I believe it's God lighting your candle. Sure. &gt;&gt; I don't believe in a church revival. I don't need a message revival. I believe individuals are having a revival in their hearts. &gt;&gt; I do believe in that. But when this man is asking for the joy of the Lord for a national revival, he said, "It is over. That is over." And so all of us would say, "How is he going to answer next?" If he says, "Son, the revival is over." Here's what he says next. Now, now the stabilizers have been put on the ship. &gt;&gt; You know what he just did? He just told us the time we'll enter into now. Don't look for a national revival. Don't look for big meetings. The stabilizers have been put in the ship. Now, I when I read that, I'm thinking in the Philippines, and they got a picture there. I'm thinking of those things that in the Philippines. It's like that's the stabilizers for a little canoe. But I didn't realize how big a stabilizer had in the cruise ship. A few years ago, my wife and I were on one for just two or three days and it was the worst experience. My wife said, "I'll never go on one again." Uh, and so we went through a storm and that's why it got got a little rocky there. Um, but I can guarantee you now that I know this, those things come out of the side of a big ship. If you didn't have those stabilizers, and I didn't realize they had such big ones, well, we'd have never made it through that storm. We would have been finished. That's right. &gt;&gt; It it it went through the storm because the stabilizers were there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then I got my wife to go on another one last year. We went on a Southern Gospel cruise that was a lot of fun. It wasn't it wasn't, you know, we didn't die. We're still here. And uh it it was fine. But you know, you realize that it was a smooth. It still rocked just a little bit. But I'm telling you now that I know this. I know what's stabilizing the ship. And that's a big ship to stabilize. That's a big deal. But there are big storms we're facing today. And brother Brandham says going back to the quote, "The stabilizers have already been put in the ship." I hope you're catching it. I'm saying now the stab put in the ship. Next one. Great fearful waves are out there. What year are we in? 1965. Great fearful waves are out there before us. But we know just beyond that wave yonder, we're nearing the shore. You see, we're nearing the shore. Just stay stabled. Just stay in the word. Stay with God. No matter how you feel, what anything else, stay right with the word. &gt;&gt; DON'T TRY TO WORK UP SOMETHING HIGHLY EMOTIONAL. IF YOU GET EMOTIONAL, I WOULDN'T MIND IF YOU DID THIS MORNING. IT'S FINE. BUT WE'RE NOT LIVING ON EMOTIONS NOW. WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR A NATIONAL REVIVAL. WE'RE NOT TRYING TO WORK UP WITH THE STABILIZERS OF THE WORD HAVE BEEN PUT in the ship. And we're going to go through some difficult times. &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to people in my own congregation that went through times in the last two years that you would have never dreamed they'd have never dreamed it up they'd be GOING THROUGH THIS &gt;&gt; RIGHT NOW even going through it. &gt;&gt; What hope do I have my counseling? Well, I do my best, but you know what? You know the hope the stabilizers have been put in the ship &gt;&gt; and we're going to crest every one of those waves. Can you say amen? We're nearing the shore. Just just stay stable. Stay in the word. This is the miracle. It's not that we have big meetings with a lot of things. No, the the miracle, the revival is somebody stays stable in the word. &gt;&gt; That just seems so intellectual. It's not intellectual. &gt;&gt; It's the power of God to that keeps us that sustains us. &gt;&gt; That when that little devil whispers giving up, something else rises in the FIRE AND SAYS, "I'M NOT GIVING UP. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE, SATAN. I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE." SOMETHING RISES UP. CAN I GET AN AMEN THIS MORNING? WHEN WE FEEL LIKE GIVING UP, AND THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. WE'RE NOT GOING ON FEELINGS NOW. THE STABILIZERS HAVE BEEN PUT IN THE SHIP. The message, the word is there. I hope I can get into it in a few weeks that that word is our stability. And if you're not in that word, you're missing the STABILITY IN YOUR LIFE IN THIS DARKNESS. AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'LL BECOME? Jesus said the if the blind lead the blind, IF YOU'RE BLIND to the understanding that's in this message, you'll follow the blind that's not in it either. That's right. &gt;&gt; And if the blind lead the blind, &gt;&gt; they'll fall in a ditch. &gt;&gt; We have the message for light, for understanding. &gt;&gt; He said great fearful waves are out there before us. Stay with the word. The next one or is that? Let's let it stay stable. When you see all these great big old clouds around us and storms coming and atomic bombs and everything else they're talking about, but our stabilizer is right straight in the word. God said it would be here. will crest every one of them waves. Yeah, we'll go right over the top of them. Yes, indeed. They can't sink us. They can't drown us. &gt;&gt; Can you confess it this morning? I don't care how big the wave is, it ain't going to sink us. &gt;&gt; Next one. You can put us in the grave and we'll come out again. &gt;&gt; That's just all there is to it. There ain't no way in the world to keep it down there. We'll crest every one of them because our great chief captain is calling at the other side. We're anchored in Jesus. The storms of life I'll brave. I've anchored in Jesus. I fear no wind or wave. Whatever it might be, let it come. And go skipping down in the quote now. What may, what will, doesn't make any difference. We're anchored right there in Jesus. If I live, I live to the glory of God. If I die, then I could die to the glory of God. I just want to just it's to the glory of God is what I want to do. When that's all over, I don't want to stay any longer. I want to go to where to my reward that he brought bought for me. Not what I earned, but what he bought for me. What he gave to me by his &gt;&gt; Oh, church of the living God, get to your feet. Believe him with all your hearts. &gt;&gt; All that's in you. Hold to that w little wheel in the middle of the wheel. So friends, I'm going to end on this. He enters into his prayer here. And I want it to make it our prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hold to that little wheel in the middle of the wheel. Let it stabilize every move and every motion that you make. &gt;&gt; Every thought that you have, may it be controlled by this tower on the inside of you. Because God is sitting right in his word of this hour in the evening light showing forth his light. &gt;&gt; Here we are today sitting in the midst of the word and the word being revealed to us by Jesus Christ. Then this is God's word and be his subjects and be a subject. We must walk close to the author of the author to understand for it to reveal. Now, how many say, "Brother Paul, I want to walk closer to the author of the book &gt;&gt; so that he can be me bring me more understanding that I can shine my light in this darkness." And so, I want to walk close to the author to understand for it to reveal. Oh Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? Now listen, this is where Abraham was. This is where he is ending. The evening lights have shine. Lord, light my candle. But here's how it ends up. Us four are no more. I'm happy with my promise. No, he's saying, "Oh Lord, what will thou have me to do this year, Lord? What will you have me to do?" &gt;&gt; Sounds like a seed of Abraham to me. &gt;&gt; Sounds like what Abraham was saying. &gt;&gt; If I must go to the fields and preach the gospel or must stay at home. Brother Rap, you were on that at camp a little bit that sometimes we glorify what am I going to do for the Lord? big positions, going overseas, all these other things. Often, brother Brandon mentions these things as being great works as well that God is using. Or if I must stay at home, sisters, that's a calling, too. &gt;&gt; Lord, what would you have me to do? Stay home? Well, God gets just as much glory out of it. No matter what it is, if it must be a good housewife or if I must be a good mother, if I must do this, that or the other, whatever it is, if I must be a farmer, whatever it is, Lord, what would you have me to do? Wasn't that what Saul cried out there, Lord, what would you have me to do? When the light struck Paul, he said, Lord, what would you have me to do? &gt;&gt; First, he said, who are you, Lord? He said, I'm Jesus. Once he knew it was, you know, the next question, what would you have me to do? &gt;&gt; Can God just burn any selfishness and self-focused out of us in this message? &gt;&gt; Make me like my father Abraham. Take all the selfishness out and all the nitpicking and all criticism. I le next Sunday, Lord willing, I want to talk about if I have to don't have to go out and see my daughter. We'll see how it goes. But next Sunday, I want to talk about things that cause division &gt;&gt; in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Because we need to know what causes division because we're not interested in more division. &gt;&gt; We're interested in oneness. &gt;&gt; To come to oneness to this word so we can bring this rapture on. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Lord, burn all the self- focus. Lord, make me like the father, my father Abraham. that with his promise in the bag, he reached out and says, "But what about those other ones? &gt;&gt; What?" And the prophet's saying the same thing. What would you have me to do? Excuse me for referring to him that way. We we believe that Malachi 4 was fulfilled that the last days, Revelations 10:7. And so there's many scriptures that talk about a prophet in the end time. If you come and see me, I'll be glad to explain that to you. There's too many scriptures to deny it. And we believe God used a ministry at the last days to bring us back to Bible faith. &gt;&gt; Okay? So, don't let that stumble you. I'll be glad to share that with you. And we we quote from all the seven age messengers that were in go Christ's right right hand in the book of Revelations. We quote from a lot of them, other gospel ministers, but the seventh one we quote from quite a bit because we realize he's the closest one to point us in the right direction back to Bible faith in this evening light. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. What would you have me to do? I think that's a good word. He said he would Paul come down to the road down to put the church into prison. But when the he cried out, "What would you have me to do?" When the light turned on as a big pillar of fire hanging above him, "What would you have me to do?" The response in Paul, the response here in Brother Brandham, response of Abraham when the light was shining to him, the question is now what would you have me to do for others? Same response. Paul meets the pitifier. what would you have me to do? And I think that's a good word to close on and say, Lord, what would you have me to do? When I see this scripture so perfectly revealed right now, Lord, what would you have me to do? Let us bow our heads. I ask everyone in here to search out your hearts now and ask that question. Lord, what would you have me to do? And you people, if you're still on the telephone wires across the nation these days, it would be streaming as some are today. You bow your heads and ask, "Lord, what would you have me to do?" Can we do that just now? Seeing that we're here in the last days, in the last hours, just so perfectly before, so plainly revealed, "What would you have me to do?" He keeps coming back to that. Dear God, while they're asking you that question, I ask myself to you, what would you have me do? Lord, as I realize that each day must be counted for. And I pray that you'll help me, Lord, to live so that each day, if you want a a New Year's goal, here's one. Let me live a life so that each day it'll be counted to your honor and your glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't miss a day. Every day. What would you have me to do? &gt;&gt; And I want to make every day count &gt;&gt; for his glory. You may only have two days left. You may only have 10. We're pretty close. Okay? We may not have a year to plan out our our goals. We may have just tomorrow. &gt;&gt; We don't know. But can we all have that before the Lord? Can we can we ask it? Lord, what would you have me to do? &gt;&gt; Burn all of the selfishness out of me. Burn all the self-focus out of me. I pray the Lord takes it from our rank. Somehow we have way too much of it. But we can start here this morning. If there be any selfish way in us, make me like my father Abraham that's pleading that's pleading. Lord, can I shine this light? What will you have me to do? Light my candle. Can you close your eyes and ask that, Lord? Light my candle. Light my candle. Light my life with your word, Lord. Change me, Father. Burn out all the selfishness and all the selffocus. Oh God, seeking for and running after what I want, Lord. Here we are with Sodom getting ready to go down. What can I do for you, Lord? How can I further your kingdom? Can I talk to somebody? Can I be a blessing to somebody? Can I be light, Lord, shining in this darkness? Light my candle, Lord. I pray. Father, I spent time with you the other night, Lord, just writing down my goals and things. But Lord, it's not so much writing them down. And this one, this one trumps all of them. Lord, how can I serve your kingdom? How can I How can I find what I'm supposed to do, Lord, and fulfill that, Lord? Let me never let money or popularity, anything take the place of this calling for this last days. Who's carrying this evening light? when you said there shall be light about the evening time and we received it Lord through Malachi 4 but Lord who's carrying it we're carrying it Lord may we carry it to the darkest moments the darkest places that you would choose to put us in not that we go there but Lord the places that are dark that we are in and called to may you speak through us if not through words through our life. Humble us, Lord. Teach us, Lord, what it means to be this last light that would shine on this earth as tribulation comes in. And Lord, there's a part of us that says, "Come quickly, Lord Jesus. We want to get out of here." But then there's another part that says, "Oh, but Lord, I I don't want to leave my family members behind. I don't want those to end up in tribulation. Lord, I cry out for them. I I ask you, Lord, save my loved ones. Save my uncles and aunts. Save my family. Lord, I ask you, Lord, do something to reach out to them, Lord, because they don't know how close we are, but I know how close we are, Lord. You showed me your secrets like you did to Abraham, and how close we are to destruction. I know it, Lord. So because of that, I want to be that one that ask for mercy for my family members and those Lord that we're influencing in the community, in our schools and our jobs wherever we're at. Lord, may we die to the pride of looking at the surface of who we are and that we know more than everybody else. May we die to all of that. And may we come alive with this light, Lord. As John Wesley said, "What do I do for the kingdom?" He says, "Just catch on fire and the world will come and watch you burn." Grant it, Father. I pray each of these young people that are here. Lord, if you would light their life with the Holy Ghost, they'd be so instrumental, Lord, in shining your light in areas, Lord, that we can't get to. Now Lord, I pray move upon their hearts. Move upon their lives. Lord, may they be broken. Lord, not to go back, try to fix their own problems, but today is the day I come. I respond. I give my life. Light my life with your word. I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Let's stand together. You're welcome to come to this altar if you're receiving the Lord. We'll be glad to pray with your desire because God is God is looking at you this morning. He'll take whatever yielding you give him. He'll take that and begin to work from that. How many believe that pleasing? Let's just worship now. Let me be pleasing to you. Let everything oh Jesus that I do be pleasing to you. Praying that everything I pursue, oh be pleased, oh Lord, unto you. We're making it our prayer now as we sing it again. You come to the altar if you want to receive Christ today. Oh, please. Let me be pleased to you. Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. Everything. Do you want to begin this year on a good path towards the Lord? Come to the altar. Give your life to Christ. Turn it all over to him. Give everything to him. Let it go. Hallelujah. Let everything I pursue. Come to the altar and give your all. Begin this year the right way. Laying it all at the altar. everything that you are, your time, your energy, everything to him. Oh, please some of the ministers can come and pray with these. Let some of the sisters want to come and pray. Do we have time this morning to just take this time in his presence to respond to him? Oh Jesus, further your kingdom, Lord. Bring the kingdom inside these. Lord, let them receive Christ. Let them receive Christ. I give my all to you. I give my time. I give my energy. I give my ambitions to you. Have you given everything to him? Oh, I may just I want more than a religion. And I want God to light my candle full of the Holy Ghost like lamps trimmed and burning to burn the midnight oil. Hallelujah. Want to be burning, burning the midnight. Oh, sing it now. With my lamp. With my lamp. Oh, trimmed and glowing. A vessel full of the Holy Ghost. I will shine the light. This is what matters this morning to the word. I must be Lord. Oh, there is a virgin bride burning the midnight. That's what I want to be. Hallelujah. Sing it now. I want to be burning. Burning the midnight. With my lamp all trimmed and glowing, a vessel full of the Holy Ghost, I will shine the light. Through the night to the word I must be Lord. There is a virgin bride burning the midnight. Oh. Oh, think about it now. Jesus said it. And in the midnight hour there'll be virgins who hear the great cry. Think about it. It's what Jesus said. Behold, he cometh. Rise and trim your lash. Go and meet him. The bridegroom is nigh. Oh, it's close friends. But some discovered they were lacking the oil. They were empty with no light to see. So I ask you, dear Lord, come and fill me with your spirit. Keep me burning for you is my belief. I want to be burning. Oh, hallelujah. With my lamp all trimmed and glowing, a vessel full of the Holy Ghost, I will shine the light through the night to the word. I must be Lord. Yes, Lord. There is a virgin bright burn in the midnight. Oh, hallelujah. Think about it now. Oh, sometimes I really get to wondering why it's a struggle. Think about think about the darkness in the spirit of complacency. We're surrounded by them. How many wants to pierce through that darkness? Yes. I am running with the burning. Oh God, burn it within me, Lord. Light of my Let's pray together. We're looking day and night with the one you hold cross. It's time for us to rise. I want to be perfect. A vessel full of the Holy Ghost. I will shine the light through the night to the word.

Lord, have your way. What would you have me to do, Lord? Guide me, lead me, be a shepherd in my life, I pray. Let my light shine. Praise the Lord. Can we sing that little chorus before we go this morning? This little light of mine, even though it's little, it can shine through all the darkness. Remember that. And the darkness can affect it if we keep it burning. God bless you each one this morning. Uh I wanted to say before we sing this that there were 24 states represented at the retreat. Two countries, our country and Canada, many provinces of Canada. So we give glory to God. Some of them are here this morning. It's nice to have you guys in the service with us. You're always welcome.
