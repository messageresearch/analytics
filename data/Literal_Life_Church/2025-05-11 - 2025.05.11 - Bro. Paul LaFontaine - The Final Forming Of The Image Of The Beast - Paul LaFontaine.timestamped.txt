[18:27] special. The Lightning Sisters. Yeah.
[18:29] After this song will happen. My life is
[18:32] in your hands. I think you have

[18:39] F. You don't have to
[18:42] [Music]

[18:50] Joy comes in the

[19:52] down. And all your friends and
[19:56] lovers, they're
[19:58] nowhere to be
[20:01] found. Remember there's a friend in
[20:06] Jesus who will
[20:09] watch. And if your heart is
[20:16] broken, just lift your hands and say,
[20:21] "Oh, I know that I can make
[20:27] it. I know that I can stand.
[20:32] No matter what become my
[20:37] own with Jesus I can make it this

[22:07] morning, we come to church this morning
[22:09] and
[22:10] then we were having a good time and then
[22:12] we just remembered my
[22:14] brother-in-law and it was it was a very
[22:18] sad situation this morning.
[22:20] Well, you know what? Jesus is there for
[22:22] us.
[22:24] I told my wife, I said, "You went to
[22:26] rest."
[22:28] And I know some of us have different
[22:30] situations and loved ones you've lost
[22:33] and people who you what they in hard and
[22:37] they are not here anymore. And once in a
[22:38] while you have that grief. But you know
[22:41] in all the situations that we go
[22:42] through, Jesus is with us. And I want to
[22:45] tell you this morning, we can make it.
[22:48] Amen. God bless
[22:49] [Music]
[23:07] you. There's torn up pages in this book.
[23:12] Words that tell me I'm no good. chapters
[23:17] that defined me for so
[23:21] long. But the hands of grace and endless
[23:26] love dusted off and picked me up told my
[23:31] heart that hope is never gone.
[23:36] God is in this
[23:38] story. And God is in the
[23:42] details. Even in the broken parts, he
[23:46] holds my heart. He never fails. When I'm
[23:51] at my
[23:53] weakest, I will trust in
[23:56] Jesus. Always in the highs and lows, the
[24:01] one who moves before me.
[24:04] God is in this
[24:08] [Music]
[24:08] [Applause]
[24:12] story. So if the storm you're walking
[24:16] through feels like it's too much, you
[24:20] wonder if he even cares at
[24:26] all. Well, hold on tight to what you
[24:30] know. He's promised he won't let you go.
[24:34] Your song of feelings written in his
[24:39] scars. God is in this
[24:43] story. God is in the
[24:47] details. Even in the broken parts, he
[24:51] holds. He never fails. When I'm at my
[24:57] weakest, I will trust in
[25:01] Jesus. Always in the highest, the one
[25:06] who rose before
[25:08] me. God is in this
[25:12] story. and he carries like addiction. He
[25:18] carries like disease. He's the one who
[25:23] fears a prisoner. He's the healer of all
[25:28] things. There is
[25:31] oppression. There is broken home. He's
[25:36] the one who holds your sorrow. He won't
[25:40] leave you here alone.
[25:44] Oh, God is in this
[25:48] story. God is in the
[25:52] details. Even in the broken parts, he
[25:56] holds my heart. He never fails. When I'm
[26:01] at my
[26:03] weakest, I will trust in
[26:06] Jesus. Always in the highs and lows. The
[26:11] one who goes before
[26:13] me. God is in this
[26:18] story.
[26:21] Oh, God is in my
[26:25] story. In this
[26:28] story, God is in this story. God is in
[26:34] this story.
[26:36] God is in your story.
[26:41] [Music]
[26:48] Hallelujah.
[26:51] Glory. Praise
[26:54] God.
[26:57] Amen.
[27:01] Hallelujah. Amen.
[27:04] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[27:07] How many you raise your hands? I've
[27:08] lived that out. God is in my story. You
[27:11] know, I'd appreciate about these girls
[27:13] singing it, too. It's not just a song.
[27:15] They're living that out and they know it
[27:16] to be true. Praise be to God. There's
[27:19] nothing like that to have it truly being
[27:21] lived out. God bless you as you give in
[27:22] your tithes and offerings this morning.
[27:24] Well, praise the Lord. God bless you
[27:26] all. And just before we go into the
[27:28] word, I want to say how much I
[27:30] appreciate all the mothers this morning.
[27:33] all that you do and all of us husbands
[27:36] and fathers and children want to honor
[27:39] you for all that you do today. There's
[27:41] not enough that we could do. We have a
[27:44] gift for you. So, make sure after church
[27:45] you go into the the fellowship hall and
[27:48] pick that up. Just a little gift of
[27:49] token of our
[27:51] appreciation. But I wonder if you'd all
[27:53] stand all the moms. And uh I'm going to
[27:56] let the scripture say it because it says
[27:58] it best um in honor and how much the
[28:02] worth is of these precious sisters. So
[28:05] we want to do that out of Proverbs 31
[28:08] today. And we'll just read it and let
[28:09] the scripture speak for itself how much
[28:12] we should honor a woman of
[28:15] virtue.
[28:19] Amen. Who can find a virtuous woman? for
[28:23] her price is far above
[28:25] rubies. So all you can remind the
[28:28] husbands of your worth and maybe
[28:31] there'll be some rubies there for you.
[28:33] The heart of her husband doth safely
[28:35] trust in her so that he shall have no
[28:38] need of spoil. She will do him good and
[28:40] not evil all the days of her life. She
[28:42] seeketh wool and flax and workketh
[28:44] willingly with her hands. She is like
[28:46] the merchant ships. She bringeth her
[28:49] food from afar. She riseth also while it
[28:51] is yet night and giveth meat to her
[28:54] household and a portion to her maidens.
[28:56] She considerth a field and buyth it with
[28:59] the fruit of her hands. She she planteth
[29:01] a vineyard. She girthth her loins with
[29:04] strength and strengthen her ar
[29:05] strengtheth her arms. She perceiveth
[29:08] that her merchandise is good. Her candle
[29:10] goeth not out by night. She layeth her
[29:13] hands to the spindle and her hands hold
[29:16] the the staff. I'm getting tired just
[29:18] reading all of
[29:20] this. The scripture expresses it. You
[29:22] know, this is just a window in all that
[29:25] these sisters do. She stretcheth out her
[29:28] out her hand to the poor. Yay, she
[29:30] reacheth forth her hands to the needy.
[29:33] She's not afraid of the snow for her
[29:35] household, for all her household are
[29:36] clothed with scarlet. She maketh herself
[29:38] coverings of tapestry. Her clothing is
[29:41] silk and purple. For her husband is
[29:43] known in the gates, when he siteth among
[29:45] the elders of the land. She maketh fine
[29:48] linen, and sellth it, and deliverth
[29:50] girdles from the uh unto the merchant.
[29:53] Strength and honor are her clothing, and
[29:56] she shall rejoice in time to come. She
[29:59] openeth her mouth with wisdom, and her
[30:02] tongue is the law of kindness. She
[30:04] lookth well to the ways of her
[30:06] household, and eateth not the bread of
[30:08] idleness. Her children arise up and call
[30:12] her blessed. Her husband also, and he
[30:15] praiseth her. Many daughters have done
[30:17] virtuously, but thou excelst them all.
[30:21] Favor is deceitful, and beauty is vain,
[30:24] but a woman that fearth the Lord, she
[30:28] shall be praised. Amen. Give her the
[30:32] fruit of her hands, and let her own
[30:34] works praise her in the gates. Mamas,
[30:38] thank you for all that you have done,
[30:41] all that you're doing. Thank
[30:50] you. Praise God. There's not enough
[30:53] praise given in this generation, in this
[30:55] culture to the moms and what they do.
[30:57] The fifth gospel, Brother Brandham said,
[30:59] teaching those children the wisdom of
[31:01] God and all that you do. Thank you once
[31:04] again and make sure you get your gift.
[31:05] Heavenly
[31:06] Father, bless these precious women
[31:09] today. Lord, in a world where we know
[31:13] that there's many forsaking their
[31:14] children and many don't want to have
[31:16] children. But Lord, here we have some
[31:18] moms that have given u countless hours,
[31:22] Lord. And I know that most of her reward
[31:25] as a godly mom will be on the other
[31:27] side. I know you'll reward them. But
[31:29] today, we just want to say thank you. We
[31:32] want to say we how much we appreciate
[31:34] these women in our lives and how they
[31:36] have touched our lives. And Lord, those
[31:39] of us had a godly mom who taught us the
[31:41] principles. Lord, my mother's here
[31:43] today. I'm thankful to have her. And
[31:45] Lord, much that I am is because of her
[31:48] molding of the character and her the
[31:50] things that she taught us in her life
[31:52] and her words. So Lord, we appreciate
[31:54] them. We pray you'll give them an extra
[31:56] special blessing today and in the year
[31:59] coming. We give them to you Lord and for
[32:02] their protection, their health and their
[32:03] strength. Lord, may they feel
[32:05] appreciated from you today as well. We
[32:08] ask it in Jesus name. Amen.
[32:11] Amen. Uh husbands and fathers remember
[32:14] give her the fruits of her
[32:16] hands. Give her something. Give her
[32:19] something.
[32:21] Amen. Let's give them one more hand.
[32:23] Appreciate these
[32:26] pictures. Praise the Lord.
[32:30] I thought I was so special this morning.
[32:32] I brought my wife's card into her while
[32:34] she was still in bed and she woke up and
[32:36] I gave her the card and I thought I
[32:38] picked out such a neat card because you
[32:41] open it and there's certain doors you
[32:42] open and the first one says, "You're a
[32:44] great wife. I love you. You're a great
[32:46] mom." And you keep opening the doors
[32:48] until finally it says, "I love you." I
[32:50] thought, "This is perfect." Well, there
[32:52] was another door that I didn't see. And
[32:54] when you open that last door, it's a
[32:56] rock song.
[33:03] Yes. Sorry, I didn't notice that was
[33:06] there,
[33:08] hun. I don't know. Something like,
[33:11] "Baby, I love you. You're my girl." or
[33:13] something like
[33:15] that. Maybe I should check the Christian
[33:18] section for cards a little bit better
[33:21] than that. We got a good laugh out of
[33:23] it, though, for sure. Would you stand
[33:25] with me and we'll go to the word this
[33:27] morning. And God bless you each one.
[33:28] Once again, we appreciate all of you,
[33:30] Brother Michael, and uh Brother John,
[33:33] Sister Laura, for your labors in the
[33:35] gospel, spreading the gospel. God bless
[33:37] you for it. Amen. Let's turn, if you
[33:40] would, to Revelations chapter 13. And uh
[33:43] knowing the time and knowing some of you
[33:45] taking your moms to lunch today or
[33:47] however you have plans, we'll be mindful
[33:49] of that today. And uh we're just going
[33:52] to read Revelations 13 here and talk a
[33:55] little bit
[33:56] about the final forming of the image of
[33:59] the beast. Now, just wanted to welcome
[34:02] all of our visitors. I know we have
[34:03] quite a few. Um my friend Lisa
[34:05] Freriedman is in town. It's good to have
[34:07] you, Lisa. And uh God bless you. And all
[34:10] the other ones that are visiting, God
[34:11] bless you. I know looks like Kelly's uh
[34:14] Yeah, he's What was his name again?
[34:16] Greg. Nice to have you, Greg. God bless
[34:18] you. We welcome all of you to the house
[34:20] of the Lord this morning. We trust
[34:21] you'll feel um included and feel safe
[34:25] and feel that you can come into the
[34:27] presence of the Lord and whatever need
[34:29] that you have, you can say, "Lord,
[34:30] here's here's where I'm at." And I
[34:33] believe the Lord can take you where
[34:34] you're at and take you where you need to
[34:35] be. Revelations 13, I'm not going to
[34:38] read the whole chapter, but the first
[34:40] part of chapter 13 is deals with a beast
[34:43] coming out of the sea. And I trust by
[34:45] the help of the Lord I can break this
[34:47] down a little bit this morning. The book
[34:48] of Revelations is in symbols and we
[34:51] don't understand it unless the Lord
[34:52] reveals it um particularly through
[34:55] prophets and and opens the word to us.
[34:57] So we trust that even the children will
[34:59] be able to understand these important
[35:00] things in the times we live in.
[35:02] Revelations chapter 13 until about verse
[35:05] 10 speaks of the beast that rises out of
[35:07] the sea which is a power. But uh
[35:10] significant to us is when it picks it up
[35:12] in uh chapter 13 and verse 11, it is
[35:15] speaking about our country, the United
[35:17] States. And the reason is is because
[35:19] this beast comes out of the earth. So
[35:21] I'm going to begin reading and and I
[35:23] won't comment too much now. We'll get
[35:24] into breaking it down in a little bit.
[35:26] Verse 11, I beheld another beast coming
[35:28] up out of the earth. And he had two
[35:31] horns like a lamb and he spake as a
[35:34] dragon. So it rises as a lamb. Our
[35:37] country rose in its innocence and two
[35:40] horns of the civil and ecclesiastical
[35:43] power that it had. It was in simplicity.
[35:45] We came to America. We actually came
[35:47] here for freedom of worship to get away
[35:49] from systems of religion that were so
[35:51] overpowering. And we traveled over here.
[35:54] And so this was a young thing. But you
[35:56] notice now the the quick transitions in
[35:58] the scripture that it it was a lamb and
[36:00] then then it begins to speak as a
[36:02] dragon. And he exercisth all the power
[36:05] of the first beast before him, and
[36:07] causeth the earth, and them which dwell
[36:09] therein to worship the first beast,
[36:11] whose deadly wound was healed. And he
[36:13] doeth great wonders, so that he maketh
[36:15] fire come down from heaven on the earth
[36:17] in the sight of men, and deceiveth them
[36:20] that dwell on the uh dwell on the earth
[36:22] by the means of those miracles which he
[36:24] had power to do in the sight of the
[36:26] beast, saying to them that dwell in the
[36:28] earth, that they should make an image to
[36:30] the beast which had the wound by a sword
[36:33] and did live. So now what plays out is
[36:35] that there's an encouragement to form an
[36:38] image to that first beast back there uh
[36:41] in another country and we'll get into
[36:42] that but this is to form an image to
[36:45] that beast within our own country and he
[36:48] had power to give life under the image
[36:49] of the beast that the image of the beast
[36:52] should both speak and cause that as many
[36:54] as would not worship the image of the
[36:56] beast should be killed. Whoa, wait a
[36:58] minute. This is not just an innocent
[37:00] thing. It has such power to it that it
[37:03] actually wants to kill those who don't
[37:05] agree with it. Verse 16, it causes all
[37:08] small and great, rich and poor, free and
[37:10] bond to receive a mark in their right
[37:11] hand or in their foreheads that no man
[37:14] might buy or sell save he that had the
[37:16] mark or the name of the beast or the
[37:18] number of his name. Wow. Here comes a a
[37:20] force and a pressure to join this thing
[37:24] that you can't buy or sell unless you
[37:26] join this thing. So, it's not just an
[37:28] innocent thing. It has a spirit of force
[37:31] behind it and a system. And unless you
[37:33] become a part of that system, you can't
[37:36] buy or sell and you could be killed.
[37:38] Here is wisdom. Let him have
[37:40] understanding. Count the number of the
[37:42] beast for it is the number of a man and
[37:44] his number is 6003 score and six. May
[37:47] the Lord add his blessings to the word
[37:49] this morning. Heavenly Father, we pray
[37:51] that you would anoint us, Father, to
[37:54] speak of the some of the current events
[37:56] and some of the things that are taking
[37:57] place in before our eyes. And we pray
[38:00] you'll encourage each one including the
[38:01] children, every age group, Lord, that we
[38:04] would receive something out of your word
[38:06] and eyesight today to be able to look
[38:09] into those things, Father, that we've
[38:11] been blessed, our eyesight to see, that
[38:13] we could know how to stand as Christians
[38:15] in this hour. That we could know our
[38:18] stability is in the word of God, Lord.
[38:21] that we would not be swayed by the
[38:23] nervousness of the instability of the
[38:25] times we live in, but to know that
[38:27] prophecy is being fulfilled and the
[38:30] coming of the Lord is at hand. We rest
[38:33] in that, Father, and we pray that you'll
[38:36] help us to understand it better. We ask
[38:38] it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[38:40] Amen. God bless. You may be seated.
[38:48] A couple of the events this week have uh
[38:51] raised high alert. And if you're on a
[38:53] little bit of social media, I'm not. I'm
[38:55] a part of some ministers chats and
[38:57] things, but uh the events this week have
[38:59] certainly raised some high alerts in the
[39:01] hearts of believers. And uh it it sure
[39:05] seems like another step towards
[39:07] prophecy. And that's why this morning
[39:09] I'd like to take this time. I know it
[39:11] seems a little strange to speak on these
[39:13] things, but it's relevant right now of
[39:15] what's taking place in the news. And so,
[39:17] I want to address and post the church on
[39:19] some things. And every believer uh
[39:22] should have an interest in knowing where
[39:24] we're at, uh knowing the time we live
[39:26] in. And that when we take small
[39:28] movements closer to things being
[39:30] fulfilled, every believer should have an
[39:32] interest in that. Not not to put us in a
[39:35] scare because when I heard some of these
[39:37] things this week and heard how they fit
[39:39] some of the uh the things that the
[39:41] prophet has said, when I heard it, it
[39:43] didn't make me afraid at all. It made me
[39:45] rejoice. Can you say amen? How many felt
[39:48] the same way? I'm not afraid of it at
[39:50] all. I say, even so, come quickly, Lord
[39:52] Jesus. That's what I said. said that's
[39:54] what one of my sons said as well. And so
[39:57] these things are when we see another
[39:59] step towards prophecy being fulfilled.
[40:01] Uh you know I think it's a great thing
[40:03] to believers and and God you know I want
[40:06] to say this first today I'm not here to
[40:08] interpret anything because God has not
[40:11] left us here as interpreters of the
[40:13] word. Uh we we always say these things
[40:16] could this be because we are not
[40:19] interpreters of the word. Uh the the
[40:21] message has taught us that God
[40:24] interprets his word by bringing it to
[40:26] pass. And that's the greatest
[40:27] vindication is when you see something in
[40:29] the scripture and then you see it
[40:31] actually come to pass. There's no
[40:33] doubting that. There's no fighting with
[40:35] that. There's no arguing with that. God
[40:38] interprets his word by bringing it to
[40:40] pass. And so we have those uh boundaries
[40:43] that we live by. We have been taught
[40:45] that God interprets it by bringing it to
[40:47] pass. And when God speaks and when he
[40:50] brings it to pass, there's no questions.
[40:52] It's not fuzzy. Uh and I personally
[40:55] believe that the greatest vindication of
[40:57] this message is just around the corner.
[40:59] I believe the great, it's been
[41:01] vindicated, but the greatest vindication
[41:03] is just ahead of us. And so we should be
[41:06] careful not to draw final conclusions
[41:09] when we see something happening in the
[41:10] news when it sure seems right. We don't
[41:13] have the right to make final
[41:14] conclusions. And yet we are looking at
[41:17] these things through the eyes of the
[41:19] word. And when we look at it through the
[41:20] eyes of the word, uh I believe that we
[41:23] can see things slowly transpiring and
[41:26] sometimes they speed up a bit. And uh
[41:29] you know, I'm thankful once again to
[41:31] know that we're close to the coming of
[41:32] the Lord. We see these things. So it's
[41:34] not a fear, it's a rejoicing that the
[41:36] Lord is close to us and his coming is
[41:38] near. And that coming should rejoice our
[41:40] heart as it says that he comes and
[41:43] appears to those that are looking for
[41:44] him. There's a scripture says he'll
[41:46] appear to those that are looking for
[41:49] him. Not all the world is looking for
[41:51] him, but believers are looking for him.
[41:53] They're looking for his appearing.
[41:55] They're looking for him coming. And when
[41:57] they see things line up, it rejoices
[41:59] their heart because that's what they're
[42:01] looking for. Above making more money in
[42:03] this life, above a better house, all
[42:06] that's fine. But what we're really
[42:07] looking for is the coming of the Lord.
[42:09] Can you say amen? And we got our eyes on
[42:12] it. And not everybody has their eyes on.
[42:13] Matter of fact, there's a lot of fear in
[42:15] the world when these happen. Brandon,
[42:17] brother Brandon was telling me in the
[42:18] office about a man, he's not even a
[42:20] believer, but he's from uh Honduras.
[42:22] Said he he looked at this thing with the
[42:24] pope and he looked at these things and
[42:25] the earthquake said he's not even a
[42:27] believer, but it's it's creating kind of
[42:29] a nervousness in his heart because even
[42:31] they know things are taking place. They
[42:34] just don't know what's taking place. Can
[42:35] you imagine not knowing the fear that it
[42:37] brings to your heart and not knowing
[42:39] where you stand? Not knowing that you're
[42:41] ready to go. I believe this morning if I
[42:44] can accomplish anything, all of us need
[42:45] to be know where we're going. Know where
[42:47] we stand. Know that we're filled with
[42:49] the spirit of God. Young person, if you
[42:52] don't know that, then you can just go
[42:53] before God this morning and say, "God,
[42:54] let me know where I stand. Let me be
[42:57] filled with your spirit." Because that's
[42:59] the one question that has to be answered
[43:01] is that, "Do I know where I'm going? Do
[43:04] I know where I stand? Praise the Lord.
[43:06] So now, uh, it's not a fear, but it's a
[43:09] rejoicing to see these things. And I
[43:12] remember in 1995 when they sent out a
[43:14] left behind, uh, series of novels, left
[43:17] the left behind series. And I guess it
[43:19] was just to alert and some people have
[43:21] said it's very good. And if you've read
[43:23] it, that's fine. But they came and then
[43:25] they came out as movies. And I guess it
[43:27] was to alert them of the times and maybe
[43:30] missing the rapture and then going into
[43:32] tribulation. And it was called Left
[43:34] Behind. And they even uh put out movies.
[43:37] I never read any of that. And I never
[43:39] seen the movies because I don't have
[43:41] much interest because I'm not called to
[43:43] be left behind.
[43:46] The title kind of scared me. I don't
[43:48] want to be left behind. I'm not called
[43:49] to Can you say, "Man, I'm not called to
[43:51] be left behind." Uh, I'm still reading
[43:54] uh some good things about uh sermon
[43:57] titles like the secret catching away and
[44:00] the rapture and uh things that are to be
[44:03] and events made clear by prophecy. Not
[44:06] fuzzy, but events made clear by
[44:09] prophecy. That's what that's what I'm
[44:11] reading. That's the series that I've
[44:12] been reading. I'm still reading them.
[44:15] And they're not novels. They are
[44:17] announcements by the seventh angel
[44:19] messenger of the time that we live in.
[44:22] Can you say amen? And it's not to bring
[44:24] us fear, but it's to give us the Holy
[44:26] Ghost and rapturing faith that we can
[44:28] say, I'm a part of the rapture. I'm not
[44:31] here to be left behind. Can you say
[44:33] amen? I'm called to something different.
[44:35] Praise the Lord. And there's no movie on
[44:38] this particular rapture. Actually, I am
[44:41] the movie.
[44:44] I'm not looking for an event. I am the
[44:46] event. Can you say amen?
[44:48] Uh, I'm acting out this last part of the
[44:51] drama that's uh rapture material and
[44:54] God's making me rapture material. He's
[44:56] making the bride. He's giving her
[44:58] rapturing faith. It's not an event. If
[45:00] it is an event, I am the event. And you
[45:03] can read about something coming. You
[45:05] know, people read about something coming
[45:06] and oh, something and you can come to
[45:08] church this morning and hear about, oh,
[45:10] this is coming. This is coming. But
[45:11] there's a difference in reading about
[45:13] what's coming and actually being a part
[45:15] of what's coming. I don't want to read
[45:17] about it. I don't want to have just a
[45:19] sermon. I want to be a part of the drama
[45:22] of the last days.
[45:24] I want to be a character in this play.
[45:26] Can you say amen? There's a symphony
[45:28] playing out. And I'm not in the audience
[45:31] watching the symphony. I'm playing an
[45:33] instrument in this symphony. Can I get
[45:35] an amen this morning? Hallelujah. I'm
[45:38] not going to a concert watching the
[45:40] symphony. I've got the sheet music for
[45:42] the last days. I've got the final sheet
[45:44] music. I'm in the spirit of the
[45:46] composer. Can you say amen? I'm watching
[45:49] the director every day. I'm watching the
[45:52] events. I'm going to play and strike the
[45:54] final chords of this rapture music.
[46:00] Like it's like I look back there at
[46:01] brother Tom, you know, and he's been
[46:05] friends for years and he's the one that
[46:06] taught 35 years gym class to True School
[46:11] and then he had, you know, all teaching
[46:13] all of us how to play sports and how to
[46:16] exercise, but he taught a lot more than
[46:17] that. And from the very beginning when I
[46:19] met him and I tried to take him to a
[46:21] football game or take him to a baseball
[46:23] game, he says, he said, "Don't don't go
[46:26] watch a football game. get outside and
[46:29] play football.
[46:32] He didn't want to go. I don't want to go
[46:34] to a baseball game. Let's go out and
[46:35] play baseball. So, he taught us
[46:36] something. And listen, it's true in the
[46:38] spiritual, too. Don't go watch what's
[46:40] going on. Don't go into a message church
[46:42] and nod your head. Say, "I want to be a
[46:44] part of this. I want rapturing faith in
[46:48] my heart."
[46:50] We can talk about events all day long
[46:52] and read quotes all day long, but this
[46:54] isn't just an event, a thing that we
[46:56] read about. This is something that we
[46:57] are.
[46:59] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. We're not.
[47:02] I'm so tired of spectators in the
[47:04] message. I don't want to be a spectator.
[47:06] People come to even my church and they
[47:08] sit back and they're just spectators of
[47:10] what's going on and then they get a
[47:12] little offended and they're up and down.
[47:13] We don't need to be up and down. We
[47:15] don't need to be offended. We don't need
[47:17] to go through all these emotions. We
[47:19] need to just find out where we stand. Is
[47:21] anybody listening to me this morning?
[47:23] This is not an hour to be a spectator.
[47:26] This is an hour to get full of the Holy
[47:27] Ghost, know where we stand, know this is
[47:30] rapture time.
[47:33] That's right. Praise the Lord. So,
[47:36] there's a couple things that I want to
[47:37] read uh from the message and they're
[47:39] related to this subject this morning of
[47:42] the final forming of the image of the
[47:45] beast. The final final forming of this
[47:47] image. And uh I want to make some
[47:49] foundational statements here that
[47:51] something that is forming of course can
[47:54] take years. Prophecy will take years to
[47:57] form until it completely materializes.
[48:00] And we all the children even have to
[48:02] know that because sometimes it can take
[48:04] years. I think it was 4 or 500 years
[48:06] after the prophet and many of these
[48:08] things are spoken by prophets. But it
[48:10] doesn't happen right away. 400 years
[48:13] before it happened, there was a prophet
[48:14] that said, "A virgin shall conceive."
[48:16] 400 years later, all of a sudden it
[48:19] materializes. But there are events that
[48:21] take place that start forming that. And
[48:24] one thing brother Lonnie said one time,
[48:25] I was in Africa with him and he said
[48:27] something. He was witnessing to uh this
[48:30] uh this man that was Christian man and
[48:32] he was witnessing and so he recognized
[48:34] brother Lonnie as a teacher and had a
[48:36] lot of knowledge and so he was probing
[48:37] him questions. I was privileged to just
[48:39] being a fly on the wall listening to all
[48:41] this because I'm learning how to witness
[48:43] to somebody of this word. And uh brother
[48:45] Lonnie he just began to go and he says
[48:47] he says back in Jesus day there was an
[48:49] accumulation of prophecy being fulfilled
[48:52] where for years it delayed and then all
[48:54] of a sudden bang bang bang bang it
[48:56] happened very quickly at the end. He
[48:57] said that's happening in the last days
[48:59] where there's prophecy laying there and
[49:01] he said you hit a certain point and
[49:03] things start to happen really quickly
[49:05] and you got to catch what's going on
[49:07] because it's going to be a wrap- up
[49:08] pretty quick. There's a forming of the
[49:10] prophecy and political and world events
[49:13] and all these things start to form
[49:16] everything. All political governments,
[49:18] all nations, you know who they're being
[49:21] formed by? They're being formed by
[49:23] prophecy being fulfilled. And all of
[49:25] them think they're doing their own
[49:26] thing. Even Trump thinks he's doing his
[49:29] own thing. But I can tell you, he's
[49:31] working by the hand of God so this word
[49:34] can be fulfilled. Can you say amen?
[49:37] But the wheels of prophecy can go slow
[49:40] sometimes. And brother Lonnie shared
[49:41] some more things with him. And that man
[49:44] actually invited us to we were at a uh
[49:46] what do they call those place like a
[49:48] someone had purchased while we were
[49:50] ministering there a a jungle a um what
[49:52] do they call that where you go see the
[49:54] lions and everything? Safari. Someone
[49:57] had purchased a nice one uh for brother
[49:59] Lonnie as a gift. And I just happened to
[50:01] be there to tag along. Worked out real
[50:04] good. I never seen one since. never seen
[50:06] one before that, but it was great. They
[50:08] had a little small Pentecostal group
[50:10] going on in that actual camp of all the
[50:12] workers and they asked Brother Lonnie to
[50:15] speak that night at their service and we
[50:17] went and I sang and he spoke and just
[50:19] being a blessing to them because the the
[50:21] fella's eyes was opening up a little bit
[50:22] through the word. So, but you see now
[50:24] what he said is true. There's a there's
[50:26] a there's a forming and there's a
[50:28] there's an accumulation of prophecy that
[50:31] begins to take place and then it it
[50:32] speeds up a bit. And uh so the I want to
[50:36] talk about how something is formed that
[50:39] this image of the beast that is in
[50:41] Revelations 13. It takes a long time to
[50:44] form into something like that especially
[50:48] in the United States because when we
[50:50] look at it then we realize that that
[50:52] beast and power system that was Rome
[50:55] started with Rome. It's still Rome but
[50:57] it changed its front. You'd have to go
[50:59] to Revelation 17 to see the front that
[51:02] that beast system has. It's always been
[51:04] that Rome system. That's the beast.
[51:06] That's the power. But then it had a
[51:08] front to it. You'd have to go to
[51:09] Revelation 17 and see that it has a
[51:11] religious front to it. But I'm sticking
[51:14] just with the beast and the power in the
[51:15] system. That was a cruel system. And it
[51:18] was actually a an organized system. And
[51:20] the purpose of it was back in pagan Rome
[51:23] is how do we get everybody to agree and
[51:26] come into the same system and be on the
[51:29] same page? Well, they formed a system,
[51:31] an organized system to accomplish that.
[51:34] And then they even formed with it a
[51:37] force after that that if you wouldn't
[51:39] become a part of the system, then you
[51:42] were killed. Then you were snuffed out,
[51:44] then you were, you know, all these
[51:45] things happened. That was a cruel,
[51:47] brutal system of this beast of Rome.
[51:51] Then it takes on, it was wounded. The
[51:53] Bible says you can read it. And then the
[51:55] wound was healed. So there was a period
[51:56] of time it looked like Rome was gone.
[51:59] That beast is gone. It's not gone. It
[52:01] got healed. Its wound got healed. And it
[52:04] rose up again under a religious front.
[52:07] Still the same power, still the same
[52:09] cruelty, still the same system to try to
[52:13] bring people together.
[52:15] And then all of a sudden now you see out
[52:17] of the United States rises this. Let's
[52:20] make an image to that beast. So it's
[52:22] going to be similar. And what's it going
[52:24] to be? It's going to be a system. It's
[52:26] going to be a form system that everybody
[52:29] needs to become a part of it for the
[52:31] good of mankind
[52:35] and then it becomes a force because you
[52:37] can't buy or sell. So all the attributes
[52:39] of that beast system now come in this
[52:41] image of the beast. But it's an amazing
[52:43] thing that it comes from the United
[52:45] States. That's the paradox because we're
[52:48] the nation that come to get away from
[52:51] all of that. And some two or three
[52:54] hundred years later, now we're inviting
[52:57] the same thing.
[53:00] Very true. Why? You think people would
[53:03] say, "Do you want that same thing that
[53:05] was that cruelty to come back into our
[53:07] country?" No, we're Americans. We don't
[53:08] want that. But you see, they'll be
[53:10] deceived because it comes in such a
[53:12] deceptive way. It comes in such a way to
[53:15] sell it. It's easily sellable because I
[53:18] and I believe CO was a test to get the
[53:20] people's hearts ready because CO and
[53:23] doing all the things they asked us to do
[53:25] six feet apart and mask and some people
[53:28] couldn't go to church and all this
[53:29] stuff. I think it was a tester to get
[53:32] the people ready for everybody coming on
[53:35] board to do the same things to keep this
[53:40] disease out of our country.
[53:42] That's an easy cell.
[53:45] Amen. That's true. All right. Well, just
[53:47] join in with it. We'll join in with it
[53:48] because because it's helping all of
[53:51] mankind. Come to find out now, science
[53:54] and everything else is being exposed to
[53:56] realize we didn't need to do as many of
[53:58] those things as we thought. But see,
[54:01] it's part of a deception. And I'm I'm
[54:03] not being political today. I'm just
[54:05] saying in the big picture of prophecy,
[54:08] men's hearts have to be prepared for
[54:10] what's coming.
[54:11] And when you have the United States
[54:13] slowly over uh the last since Kennedy
[54:16] was president, how did we get a Catholic
[54:18] president? How did that happen? When we
[54:20] come to get away from that system, then
[54:22] we actually have a Catholic president.
[54:23] And since that time, the growing and the
[54:26] forming of the people's minds and the
[54:28] forming of religious systems and the
[54:30] forming of everything to get it to the
[54:33] place that we'd actually form an image
[54:35] to that same power and people can't buy
[54:38] or sell unless they join into that
[54:40] system. How do we get there? That's the
[54:42] paradox. How does it happen? And why is
[54:44] it happening? Because prophecy must be
[54:47] fulfilled. What God said in his word,
[54:50] can you say amen? What God said will
[54:53] come to pass. God has a perfect track
[54:56] record that what he has said, it may
[54:58] take a thousand years, but it always
[55:00] comes to pass.
[55:03] You can't count on too many things
[55:04] today, but you can count on that word.
[55:07] It's going to come to pass.
[55:10] But my subject today is how it forms and
[55:13] and and and and uh you know it's when
[55:16] you have an image of something like we
[55:19] have uh statues and it takes the
[55:22] sculptor years to form. I don't know how
[55:24] long Michelangelo took on some of his
[55:26] when he did Moses. I don't know how many
[55:28] years he took for it. But but it's not
[55:31] something overnight. An image to
[55:33] something is formed over time. Everybody
[55:35] listen it. Right. So, it's in the
[55:38] forming of it. You don't present it
[55:40] right away. And you certainly couldn't
[55:42] take the power of that first beast and
[55:44] bring it right over to the United
[55:45] States. But when there's a forming of
[55:47] the image and so it's going to be an
[55:48] image. It's going to be the same spirit.
[55:50] It's going to be invited the same thing.
[55:52] But it's an image unto the beast. It's
[55:54] going to be a system, a religious system
[55:57] that forms that it's so similar to that
[56:00] religious system that it actually joins
[56:03] together. So now it's formed over time.
[56:05] A sculptor forms this over time and it
[56:08] comes from something original. Moses,
[56:10] whoever they're doing, there was an
[56:11] original, but this is an image unto it.
[56:13] And the image unto it is a slow
[56:16] formation bringing it into that image
[56:19] that we can look at it and say it's the
[56:21] same thing. It's a it's like a shadow on
[56:23] the wall of your hand. It's imaging the
[56:26] reality of your hand, but it's a shadow
[56:28] of it. So an image is something, but
[56:30] this image will have just as much power
[56:33] because the power that's behind that
[56:36] first beast, they're inviting that power
[56:39] to energize this image of the beast.
[56:43] And when you have that, it's the dragon
[56:45] who is Satan. It's the it's the power.
[56:47] It's the beast system. A beast in the
[56:49] Bible in book of Revelations is a power.
[56:51] And then you have uh the dragon speaking
[56:54] behind it. Who is the devil? The
[56:56] revelation says that's the devil. So
[56:58] he's the one that's speaking and so now
[57:00] you have this image that's formed.
[57:02] Sometimes it's exciting to see things
[57:06] forming towards the
[57:09] fulfillment. I'm going to give you an
[57:10] example. Read with me a scripture.
[57:12] Revelation
[57:15] 16:12. Revelation 16:12. And this is the
[57:18] seven vials that pour out during the
[57:20] tribulation period. Seven vials. Seven
[57:23] angels bringing seven vials. is the it's
[57:25] the punishment or the judgment that's
[57:28] coming in the church in in the um
[57:30] tribulation. I'm just going to read the
[57:33] what the in verse 12 the sixth vial and
[57:36] the sixth angel poured out his vial upon
[57:39] the great river Euphrates and the water
[57:42] thereof was dried up that the way of the
[57:46] kings of the east might be prepared. Now
[57:49] you can read that and you know that it's
[57:51] prophecy to be fulfilled, right? It's
[57:53] coming someday. It's not today. It's
[57:55] going to be in uh the tribulation period
[57:58] because that's when the vials are poured
[57:59] out. When the bride goes up, the devil
[58:01] comes down. When the bride's gone,
[58:04] tribulation and judgment hit this earth.
[58:06] And all of a sudden, you wouldn't want
[58:07] to be here because all the judgments of
[58:09] God that's been building up are going to
[58:11] be poured out upon this earth. Seven
[58:13] vials is the proof of that. And each
[58:15] vial is different. This one is
[58:16] particular to the Euphrates River, which
[58:19] feeds many nations in that time. One of
[58:23] the vials and judgments is going to be
[58:24] it's going to be dried up. Look what
[58:27] come out last year. The Euphrates River
[58:30] is facing a critical threat of drying up
[58:33] due this is 19. This is 2024 last year.
[58:36] The Euphrates River is facing a critical
[58:38] threat of drying up due to a combin Oh,
[58:41] okay. They got it up here. Due to a
[58:43] combination of factors including climate
[58:45] change, reduced rainfall and human
[58:47] activities like dam construction and
[58:50] water usage. According to multiple
[58:51] sources, a government uh report warned
[58:55] that the river could be completely dry
[58:57] by 2040. This poses significant
[59:00] challenges for the region, particularly
[59:02] in Syria, Iraq, and Turkey, where
[59:05] millions rely on the river for water,
[59:08] agriculture, and hydroelectric power.
[59:11] Isn't that interesting?
[59:16] Isn't it interesting?
[59:19] Now, you know, here's here's a
[59:20] scripture. You might read over it. It's
[59:23] not necessarily for the bride's day, but
[59:25] for later on, but it's a scripture. And
[59:27] now now they report last year it's
[59:30] starting to slowly dry up. Might dry up
[59:32] before then. But what does it do? Young
[59:34] people, I hope you're listening. It
[59:36] shows us that in the word of God, things
[59:39] will begin to form. And you'll see them
[59:41] in the news that are forming to that
[59:44] prophecy being fulfilled. That river is
[59:47] going to dry up someday. It is going to
[59:49] affect a lot of nations and it'll be
[59:51] part of the judgments of God, but it's
[59:53] already forming
[59:55] in prophecy, right? Amen.
[59:58] It seems like a fulfillment forming. It
[1:00:02] may take years, but I wanted to give
[1:00:04] that example. And that's a wonderful
[1:00:06] rejoicing thing to see so many of these
[1:00:08] things working towards prophecy being
[1:00:11] fulfilled even coming in the
[1:00:13] tribulation. So now when we go back to
[1:00:15] re Revelations 13. I'm not going to be
[1:00:18] long today. So, I hope you listen quick
[1:00:20] and I hope you say amen. Of course, if
[1:00:22] you really get into it and say amen,
[1:00:24] then I'll get into it some more and we
[1:00:26] might be longer here on Mother's Day.
[1:00:28] See, if I say that, you'll stop saying
[1:00:30] amen
[1:00:32] now. Get me a sign like brother Diggs.
[1:00:34] Oh, say
[1:00:37] amen. Praise the Lord. You love him.
[1:00:41] So, you know, this and this is different
[1:00:43] for a Mother's Day message. I
[1:00:46] understand. But I had to obey the Lord.
[1:00:49] I'm not as bad as my dad who went to a
[1:00:51] church when I was a kid and he forgot it
[1:00:54] was Mother's Day and he preached on the
[1:00:55] mother of
[1:00:57] harlots. He
[1:00:59] did, didn't he? Sharon, Sherry. Yes, he
[1:01:03] did. I'm not that extreme this morning.
[1:01:05] I'm not going there. I know that it's
[1:01:08] Mother's Day, but the Lord told me to
[1:01:10] talk about
[1:01:11] this. Praise the Lord. So, Revelations
[1:01:14] 13, there's a power that rose out of the
[1:01:17] earth, which was a young, tender, new
[1:01:19] country of the United States. Even the
[1:01:22] number 13 is tied to the United States.
[1:01:25] There was a beast power in the first
[1:01:27] part of the chapter that come out of the
[1:01:30] sea. And when the Bible, Revelation says
[1:01:32] when something comes out of the sea, it
[1:01:34] represents peoples and tongues and
[1:01:36] nations. That's where that beast system
[1:01:38] come out of the first one. The d and
[1:01:40] then the dragon Satan gave that beast
[1:01:42] its power. It was Rome. And so I've
[1:01:45] already mentioned that. So so we see
[1:01:46] that first beast was out of the sea. But
[1:01:48] this one didn't rise out of the sea. It
[1:01:51] rose out of the earth. This innocent
[1:01:53] young new country and then later on it's
[1:01:56] not innocent anymore because it begins
[1:01:58] to rise in arrogance and speak like a
[1:02:00] dragon. And that's a shame that things
[1:02:02] have to change that way that all of a
[1:02:04] sudden you have this tender innocent
[1:02:06] thing and we we come here to get a get
[1:02:09] freedom of religion that we can worship
[1:02:11] according to the dictates of our heart
[1:02:13] and here we are. We got and we can
[1:02:16] follow the word the the way that God's
[1:02:18] leading us and then look what our nation
[1:02:20] does now. It crosses over to speaking
[1:02:23] like that dragon speaking uh as a
[1:02:26] dragon. So it changes from this
[1:02:28] innocence to something of power. It
[1:02:31] looks like it was the first base was
[1:02:33] wounded to death. It looks like that
[1:02:34] Rome was over. But the wound was healed
[1:02:37] when papagan Rome changed to pap Rome.
[1:02:42] That wound was healed and it's still in
[1:02:45] power today just as much as when the
[1:02:49] Caesars ruled in Rome.
[1:02:54] The the deadly wound was healed. It's
[1:02:56] still just as much in power. It still
[1:02:59] dominates every nation in this country.
[1:03:02] What power dominates in every nation in
[1:03:05] this country? Think about it. Think
[1:03:07] about it. That power is still in power
[1:03:10] today. It means it's still going today.
[1:03:14] But this second one was a this and and
[1:03:17] and this was a strange power. It says no
[1:03:20] one was able to make war with it. So
[1:03:22] it's it's got to be a very interesting
[1:03:24] type of power because normal nations
[1:03:27] that want to go to war one with one
[1:03:29] another, they have armies and they have
[1:03:31] things and so now they'll create create
[1:03:33] a war and they'll go to war, but nobody
[1:03:35] can make war with this system. And yet
[1:03:38] it's a powerful beast, but no one could
[1:03:42] make war with it. You just think about
[1:03:43] it and you'll come up with the right
[1:03:45] conclusions. There's a power that
[1:03:47] dominates in that Roman system that
[1:03:50] nobody can make war with it. If not,
[1:03:52] they don't make war with it. They
[1:03:54] actually cater to it, invite it, get
[1:03:58] excited when there's a pope from the
[1:03:59] United from
[1:04:02] America. All the world wandered after
[1:04:05] this power. It's integrated in the whole
[1:04:08] world. Verse seven says, "And it made
[1:04:10] war with the saints." Well, this power
[1:04:13] makes war with true Holy Ghostfilled
[1:04:17] people, and it's been doing it for
[1:04:19] generations. If you're exposing this
[1:04:21] beast power, you must read all of its
[1:04:24] attributes. And one of the main
[1:04:26] attributes is to come against and to
[1:04:28] kill the true saints of every hour.
[1:04:32] It hates the ones that truly have the
[1:04:35] Holy Ghost. That's right. It don't it
[1:04:38] don't hate nominal Christians. It don't
[1:04:39] hate modern Christians who kind of make
[1:04:42] up their own rules on modesty and
[1:04:44] everything else. No, no. It hates the
[1:04:45] ones that hold to the word of God
[1:04:48] through the Holy Ghost. That's the one
[1:04:51] it'll turn against. And it m it just it
[1:04:54] it it it it
[1:04:56] uh comes against those Holy Ghost people
[1:04:58] of every generation. It did it since the
[1:05:00] very beginning. You say, "Where do you
[1:05:02] get that history?" Look at the Roman
[1:05:04] power tried to even kill Jesus when he
[1:05:07] was born. Who was in charge? Rome.
[1:05:11] And then who was one killing Christians
[1:05:12] in the early church? Who was
[1:05:14] instrumental to do it? Rome. Killing
[1:05:16] Christians. Then the dark ages. They're
[1:05:18] killing even more of them. The ones who
[1:05:20] would hold true to the light of God's
[1:05:22] word. And those who wouldn't join the
[1:05:24] systems are the ones that got killed by
[1:05:26] this power. It's still there today. It
[1:05:29] still has the same force to it. The only
[1:05:31] thing is something's got to rise up of
[1:05:33] that pressure within our own innocent
[1:05:36] country. That's right. Amen. That's the
[1:05:38] reality of it. So now it switches to
[1:05:41] speaking the power of rising out of
[1:05:43] earth. And when it's young and innocent
[1:05:44] as a nation, it was a lamb with two
[1:05:46] horns, civil and ecclesiastical powers.
[1:05:48] Then it begins to speak like a dragon.
[1:05:51] And so you see, I hope you're catching
[1:05:53] my simple point. You see this all
[1:05:55] forming up into something over 200 years
[1:05:58] now. It's forming into an image unto the
[1:06:02] beast.
[1:06:04] So now we have political systems and I I
[1:06:07] mean it respectfully because every good
[1:06:10] thing that a man does to try to help us
[1:06:12] Americans financially and to be more
[1:06:14] safe, I I I thank the Lord for it. But
[1:06:18] that becomes the prominent thing now is
[1:06:20] that this is the final agenda to have a
[1:06:23] president who's going to bring a golden
[1:06:25] age. To have a president that's going to
[1:06:26] make our nation safe again, get rid of
[1:06:28] all the bad people. Although I don't
[1:06:30] understand why they're only getting rid
[1:06:31] of the illegals that are bad because if
[1:06:34] you get rid of all them, we still got a
[1:06:35] lot of bad people here. Are we going to
[1:06:37] send them off as well?
[1:06:41] We're going to make America safe again.
[1:06:44] It's going to be a golden age. We're
[1:06:45] going to make America great again. And
[1:06:47] you got all these thrusts that we're
[1:06:50] coming to something. And yet, when you
[1:06:52] get your Bible, the Bible says it's
[1:06:55] forming into an image unto the beast.
[1:06:59] I don't mean to be a doubter this
[1:07:00] morning. I'm here to tell you the truth.
[1:07:04] Don't be duped
[1:07:07] into what they say the final end of
[1:07:10] America is because it's what the Bible
[1:07:12] says is the final end. Okay. I believe
[1:07:16] we can rejoice and live as Christians
[1:07:18] every day. I don't we believe we need to
[1:07:20] be scared. I believe we can rejoice in
[1:07:22] the coming of the
[1:07:23] Lord. What if we hit financial trouble?
[1:07:26] Brother Paul, we're already hitting it.
[1:07:28] All I can tell you, I've I got a word
[1:07:29] for that. I've never seen the righteous
[1:07:31] forsaken or his seed begging for bread.
[1:07:33] I've got a word that's going to carry me
[1:07:35] through. And I've got a word that says
[1:07:37] in rapture time, in the time of trouble,
[1:07:39] he shall hide me in his pavilion. He'll
[1:07:42] protect me from all this stuff. He'll
[1:07:44] protect my children from the homosexual
[1:07:47] agenda. He'll protect because he's put
[1:07:50] protections in place. Somebody ought to
[1:07:52] say, "Praise the Lord." We better be in
[1:07:54] the word and not our own reasoning of
[1:07:57] things. We better not have a religion or
[1:07:59] part of that system. We better be
[1:08:01] wordbased. Can you say amen? Cuz that's
[1:08:03] where our protections are. So it's it's
[1:08:05] going to make great America great. It's
[1:08:07] going to do this again. It's going to
[1:08:09] make America save again. Why Why don't
[1:08:11] they have Why didn't Trump had let's
[1:08:13] make America moral again?
[1:08:17] I never heard that in the campaign.
[1:08:21] But they can't do it without God. That's
[1:08:23] right. Maybe that's why they didn't
[1:08:24] pursue it. They're trying to make
[1:08:26] everything religious and bring it all
[1:08:27] all everything together. But you see now
[1:08:30] uh you never see that. But I just wanted
[1:08:32] to say that you can work. But look at
[1:08:34] this other scripture here. I'm trying to
[1:08:37] show our young people and everyone if
[1:08:39] you don't know this. Revelations 13 is
[1:08:42] so specific to the United States and
[1:08:46] where we're going. Amen. Here's another
[1:08:49] example. Verse 13 says, "And he doeth
[1:08:52] great wonders so that he maketh fire
[1:08:54] come down from heaven on the earth in
[1:08:56] the sight of men." Well, who what in the
[1:08:59] world? There's some of us who believe
[1:09:01] that's that that's attached to atomic
[1:09:03] power.
[1:09:05] And I looked it up and the who exercised
[1:09:09] and flexed its atomic muscles first?
[1:09:12] There was laboratories and stuff and
[1:09:14] USSR and all those things, but who
[1:09:16] flexed their muscles with it first? the
[1:09:18] United States. And here they are. He
[1:09:21] shall sow fire coming from heaven. The
[1:09:24] first time atomic power was flexed, we
[1:09:27] thought it was Japan. No, the first time
[1:09:28] it was flexed was on July 16th, 1945 at
[1:09:32] the Trinity testing site.
[1:09:40] Okay, we'll just leave that alone for a
[1:09:42] minute here.
[1:09:43] First time atomic power was flexed was
[1:09:46] on July 16th, 1945 at the Trinity test
[1:09:50] site in New Mexico. According to the Air
[1:09:51] Force Nuclear Weapons Center, this
[1:09:53] marked the first ever detonation of
[1:09:56] nuclear weapon of a nuclear weapon. The
[1:09:58] explosion of the plutonium implosion
[1:10:01] device
[1:10:03] co-enamed
[1:10:06] Trinity was a demonstration of the power
[1:10:09] of Manhattan's project work. the first
[1:10:12] demonstration, the first time it was
[1:10:15] used, and then the first time it was
[1:10:16] used publicly, because I didn't know
[1:10:18] about that one until last night, but the
[1:10:20] first time we knew publicly is using it,
[1:10:22] dropping a bomb on
[1:10:24] Japan. Flexing its what?
[1:10:28] Power. Just letting you all know we're
[1:10:31] using this for the first time. We've got
[1:10:34] power.
[1:10:38] It was the month after July 16th in
[1:10:42] August is when they dropped the bomb on
[1:10:47] Japan. Just some simple points that we
[1:10:49] should understand. Pagan Rome became a
[1:10:51] force to force unity and bring everyone
[1:10:53] on the same page to come under one
[1:10:55] system. When it changes to paparome, it
[1:10:57] did the same thing at Niasa to force
[1:11:00] everyone to one system. We got all these
[1:11:03] outskirts of people out here. We've got
[1:11:05] to bring it to one system that we all
[1:11:07] believe the same. That's what nia was.
[1:11:10] It looked like such a ma matter of fact
[1:11:12] a lot of all due respect most of
[1:11:14] Christianity today look at na as a good
[1:11:16] thing. But if you read history you see
[1:11:19] many people coming into that meeting who
[1:11:21] disagreed with it and they were ousted.
[1:11:23] They were no you've got to come to this
[1:11:25] system because this is a good thing for
[1:11:28] all of Christianity and for all of
[1:11:29] mankind. We've got to come together and
[1:11:31] believe in one organized system. And
[1:11:34] that's where it started. Same spirit is
[1:11:36] on pagan Rome. Can you say amen? It it
[1:11:38] it and and it didn't start forcing
[1:11:40] people till later. But the agenda was to
[1:11:42] bring it all under one system, forming
[1:11:45] it under one system. If this power did
[1:11:48] that two times before, then it certainly
[1:11:51] will do it in the image that's to the
[1:11:53] same thing.
[1:11:56] I'm going to summarize this thought on
[1:11:58] this final forming of things. The Bible
[1:12:02] proclaims what is forming. Many times it
[1:12:04] proclaims it and shows it even forming.
[1:12:06] The
[1:12:07] prophecy as I said not to make America
[1:12:10] great again. Not to take a man like
[1:12:13] Trump and create a golden age. Prophecy
[1:12:16] doesn't say things to say things to make
[1:12:19] America safe again to make America
[1:12:22] peaceful and the world peaceful again.
[1:12:24] To make America healthy again. I I'm not
[1:12:27] against all that. But I'm just telling
[1:12:29] you that's not the end result of the
[1:12:31] agenda and the final goal of the United
[1:12:34] States in the
[1:12:37] scripture. For many, many years things
[1:12:39] have been forming towards this image of
[1:12:42] the beast. The very fact that we elected
[1:12:44] the first Catholic president in Kennedy
[1:12:46] was a
[1:12:48] change. And so we look at things that
[1:12:50] are forming and and now I bring you to
[1:12:52] this quote that probably you've seen all
[1:12:53] over the internet this week.
[1:12:56] And I even sent it out to my
[1:12:58] family. the discovery of what the
[1:13:01] prophet said. If you want to enter
[1:13:05] in image of the beast, you'll find all
[1:13:08] the way back to
[1:13:09] 1952-53 so many references and so many
[1:13:12] little nuggets to put the pieces
[1:13:14] together of maybe how this would form
[1:13:17] and how in the world does the United
[1:13:20] States turn to forming an image unto
[1:13:23] that beast and putting pressure on
[1:13:25] churches and Christians to join that
[1:13:29] system.
[1:13:31] Remember, you won't just some people
[1:13:33] won't join by giving their hand of
[1:13:36] fellowship to it. Some will join by
[1:13:38] giving their mind to it because the mark
[1:13:40] is in the hand and in the forehead.
[1:13:43] That's right. So, you'll either give
[1:13:45] your service or your money towards it or
[1:13:47] you'll give your mindset completely over
[1:13:49] to it. I wish I could talk to the
[1:13:52] satility of Satan to sell. Do you do you
[1:13:56] think it'll be an easy thing to not see
[1:13:59] through that? Only through the
[1:14:00] discernment of the Holy Spirit can you
[1:14:02] see through this modern Christianity.
[1:14:05] And remember now, it's not the people
[1:14:07] that are in it,
[1:14:09] but it's the system.
[1:14:11] Don't be duped by it. Well, they've come
[1:14:14] up with their own theory to living,
[1:14:16] their own theory to this, their own
[1:14:18] theory to modesty. They come up with
[1:14:19] their own and they set the rules for it.
[1:14:22] God didn't give who died and made you
[1:14:24] interpreter of the word, Baptist,
[1:14:26] Presbyterian, all of it. It sounds like
[1:14:29] that you've taken your system and it's
[1:14:31] so similar to the original system that
[1:14:34] basically took the true word of God and
[1:14:36] started to interpret it their own way.
[1:14:39] That's the Roman Catholic system, right?
[1:14:42] So when you have a system of dabbling
[1:14:44] and changing absolutes in this and
[1:14:46] making it their own way, making Peter
[1:14:48] the first pope even though he never was
[1:14:50] in Rome ever, right? And you got all
[1:14:54] these saints and worship of saints and
[1:14:57] praying to Mary and all this stuff.
[1:14:59] Where's it at in here? I can name to you
[1:15:02] probably 90 things. I have a book 90
[1:15:05] things that are completely
[1:15:08] unscripturable scriptural that are
[1:15:10] standards in that system as being the
[1:15:13] word of God. How deceiving is that? And
[1:15:17] you think by some denomination of yours
[1:15:19] that you can tamper with this, you're of
[1:15:21] the same mindset. I'll choose the way
[1:15:24] that I want to live and I'll manipulate
[1:15:28] this Bible and interpret it the way I
[1:15:30] want so I can live the way that I want
[1:15:32] to live.
[1:15:34] You got to know I love you when I tell
[1:15:36] you that straight.
[1:15:38] But I'm not here to pat you on the back.
[1:15:40] I'm here to tell the truth. What we're
[1:15:43] headed toward is not a nation that's
[1:15:45] going to defeat communism and we all be
[1:15:48] together and Christians are going to No,
[1:15:50] no, no, no, no. This this is going to
[1:15:51] become a pressure on true Christians.
[1:15:55] I already feel some of the persecution
[1:15:57] sometimes. Now, I have people that
[1:15:58] respect me for what I believe. They know
[1:16:00] what I believe. There's a respect level.
[1:16:02] Praise the Lord. There's boundaries. I
[1:16:04] have other people, they don't respect it
[1:16:06] at all.
[1:16:08] There's no respect level and it becomes
[1:16:10] more and more of a thing. I've told you
[1:16:12] before that I have gotten liberty to put
[1:16:15] my broadcast on a secular
[1:16:17] station and and if they hear this, I
[1:16:20] want to thank you all, WWO, because they
[1:16:22] welcomed us and they let us be on there
[1:16:25] and and I thank the Lord for it. We can
[1:16:27] get the truth out and, you know, speak
[1:16:29] to people. I get I walk into banks and
[1:16:31] walk into places that, you know, I I
[1:16:34] seen you on TV. I really enjoy that. I
[1:16:36] had a couple businessmen that I know in
[1:16:38] town and they they seen me the other
[1:16:40] day. He says, "Yeah, my wife and I,
[1:16:42] we're watching you every Sunday." And
[1:16:43] they go, "Well, not every Sunday, but
[1:16:45] most Sundays we're watching you on the
[1:16:47] TV." So now I'm a TV evangelist.
[1:16:52] But it's neat because when they say they
[1:16:54] don't have to, you know, some of them
[1:16:56] come and visit, but listen, if I've got
[1:16:58] a half hour to share things that's been
[1:17:02] open to us and this Bible being open to
[1:17:04] us, I am a happy man because my job is
[1:17:07] not to do something in their heart. My
[1:17:08] job is to get the truth out there. Every
[1:17:11] one of you ought to make that your goal.
[1:17:12] We're not here to just sit us four and
[1:17:14] no more in this congregation. The vision
[1:17:16] of this church is not to sit here and
[1:17:18] wait for people to come or wait for
[1:17:20] people just to uh come from other
[1:17:22] message churches. No, no, no, no. Our
[1:17:24] eyes, where is the seed that haven't
[1:17:27] heard this wonderful truth yet? And
[1:17:29] every one of you ought to be a witness
[1:17:30] of that. You ought to arrange your life
[1:17:32] that that's the main goal is to find the
[1:17:34] last elected seed that has a hunger for
[1:17:37] this truth. Can I get an amen? That's
[1:17:40] the vision of this church. Thank you,
[1:17:42] brother. That's the vision of this
[1:17:43] assembly. You know, I'm going to say it.
[1:17:46] I am more more less interested in being
[1:17:49] accepted and being, how should I say it,
[1:17:52] respectfully, making sure that we fit
[1:17:55] everything perfectly in in the eyes of
[1:17:57] the message movement.
[1:18:02] I I I believe this message with all my
[1:18:04] heart. I hold every bit of it, okay? I'm
[1:18:06] not compromising. But we shouldn't be so
[1:18:08] concerned about impressing everybody
[1:18:10] else. Couple weeks ago, I talked to the
[1:18:12] pastors and I encouraged them in the
[1:18:13] scripture that says there's there's a
[1:18:15] group of people Paul said, this is in my
[1:18:17] notes, so this is
[1:18:19] free. There's a group of people in
[1:18:21] Paul's day and he says they comparing
[1:18:24] themselves with themselves and Paul said
[1:18:27] that's carnal. Brother Bram called it
[1:18:29] carnal comparisons that you're comparing
[1:18:32] yourself with other people like that and
[1:18:35] so they compare preachers compare
[1:18:36] themselves with themselves. We're not to
[1:18:39] do that. It's carnal to do that. We're
[1:18:41] to compare ourselves with the word of
[1:18:43] God. And I was encouraging the pastors
[1:18:45] and pastor's wife, don't sit around
[1:18:47] there and see how you're looking to
[1:18:48] every other message church and oh, we're
[1:18:50] not growing like them or oh, we don't
[1:18:52] have that kind of ministry or we don't
[1:18:53] have this. Quit worrying about that and
[1:18:56] do what God has called you to do in your
[1:18:58] local area. Find the will of God for
[1:19:01] your local church and do that. Amen.
[1:19:05] When I first started my church, I loved
[1:19:07] Brother Biscll's church so much and he
[1:19:09] had me out. We was good friendship. I
[1:19:10] thought, "Wow, there's a successful
[1:19:12] church. It's growing. I like everything
[1:19:13] they do." And I tried for the first five
[1:19:16] years to form their church the way that
[1:19:18] brother Bisll do it until the Lord
[1:19:20] rebuked me and spoke to me one day.
[1:19:22] Spoke to my says, "I haven't called you
[1:19:24] to make your church like brother
[1:19:25] Biscllow's church. I've called you to do
[1:19:27] something specific for this area. I need
[1:19:29] you to follow my lead." And that's what
[1:19:31] I began to do. What is God calling us to
[1:19:34] do in our local community, in your job,
[1:19:37] in your environment, your domain? Quit
[1:19:40] worrying about the rest of the message
[1:19:42] groups.
[1:19:44] Is this okay to say this morning? We are
[1:19:47] so concerned about comparing oursel to
[1:19:49] everybody else. Quit worried about
[1:19:51] what's going on out there. Quit worried
[1:19:53] about what we're doing. Is it going to
[1:19:55] be acceptable out there? Let's find the
[1:19:57] will of God. Say, "Well, what if
[1:19:58] something needs correction?" If we're
[1:19:59] following the Holy Ghost, God will
[1:20:01] correct our local assembly. He puts the
[1:20:04] gifts in the church to correct correct
[1:20:05] the music, correct this, correct that. I
[1:20:08] trust in the Holy Ghost to correct us.
[1:20:10] But I'm not trying to compare and say,
[1:20:11] "Oh, I hope we're doing it right so the
[1:20:13] visitors, they can see everything's just
[1:20:15] right and make them happy." I'm not as
[1:20:17] concerned about that anymore because I'm
[1:20:20] here to please the Lord. And when I get
[1:20:23] on the other side and step into that
[1:20:25] dimension, I want to hear him say, "Well
[1:20:28] done, thou good and faithful servant."
[1:20:31] And you weren't concerned about
[1:20:32] everybody else's opinion. I did. You did
[1:20:36] what I called you to do. If I don't have
[1:20:39] any more come this and there's a few
[1:20:41] souls that come in. Listen, I'm still
[1:20:43] praying. Brother Ron Spencer was here
[1:20:45] one time and he says, "I see all these
[1:20:47] rows filled with prostitutes and harlots
[1:20:49] and drunkards and everything else. I
[1:20:52] say, "Let it come to pass." There's
[1:20:54] still some empty seats here that some of
[1:20:57] you aren't even come to fill on
[1:20:58] Wednesday nights and you live five
[1:21:00] minutes away. May God fill them with
[1:21:02] people who want to hear the word of God.
[1:21:08] It comes from a hunger of the word of
[1:21:10] God. It comes from I want to know truth
[1:21:12] and I want to know where I stand. But it
[1:21:14] it it we have to be we can't form a
[1:21:18] system even here.
[1:21:20] God doesn't want to work through
[1:21:21] systems.
[1:21:23] He wants to work through a Holy Ghost
[1:21:25] fil church.
[1:21:26] Wants to work in his body.
[1:21:31] Praise the Lord. I better get back up
[1:21:33] here to my notes or I might say some
[1:21:35] more
[1:21:40] things. Look at this. And remember I
[1:21:44] said a few months ago I was talking
[1:21:46] about the
[1:21:48] um the time of trouble and I was
[1:21:50] emphasizing communism filling our
[1:21:52] country. 1955 brother said our country
[1:21:55] is full of it. It's full of communism by
[1:21:58] spirit. It's full of
[1:21:59] communism. So now I want you to discover
[1:22:01] something he said here about communism
[1:22:03] all the way in
[1:22:04] 1953. And watch how now this image of
[1:22:07] the beast, watch, even back then he's
[1:22:09] speaking of things forming because you
[1:22:11] have to have a common enemy to join
[1:22:15] together. One of the ways Satan sells it
[1:22:17] is if we all have a common
[1:22:19] enemy to join to fight against. Okay,
[1:22:23] that's the best way to sell it. Remember
[1:22:25] COVID? We got to find a common enemy.
[1:22:27] Everybody join in so everybody can live.
[1:22:31] And so now he says here 1953 now you
[1:22:34] just do I still have uh can I have a few
[1:22:37] more minutes you just keep on this on
[1:22:40] your mind now they're going to have a
[1:22:44] confederation of churches the churches
[1:22:46] of Christ of America is already
[1:22:48] confederating with all their churches
[1:22:50] and they're going to have a band here
[1:22:52] someday that'll shut out to fight
[1:22:57] communism. Got to find a common enemy.
[1:23:00] And so when they recognize themselves
[1:23:02] like a prophet says it back there that
[1:23:04] our country is full of communism full of
[1:23:06] communism and I broke that down what
[1:23:08] that spirit is a godless spirit you know
[1:23:11] I want god my own way and I don't want
[1:23:14] the god of the bible so that's the core
[1:23:16] of communism but you see now this
[1:23:18] religious system it's not it's not
[1:23:21] godless it wants god but it wants it
[1:23:23] through the religious system so it has a
[1:23:25] religious front to it very very nice but
[1:23:28] you see now What do they fight together
[1:23:30] against? Communism. So I just want to
[1:23:33] make a point now. They didn't discover
[1:23:36] back then that our country was full of
[1:23:37] it. But I can tell you the last
[1:23:39] election, the last two or three
[1:23:41] elections, it became at the forefront
[1:23:44] that people begin to recognize,
[1:23:46] especially our president, that this
[1:23:48] country is becoming full too much in our
[1:23:51] colleges of socialism and communism.
[1:23:54] It's being taught to our kids. I gave
[1:23:57] you something in
[1:23:59] 1966 where the actual agenda of the
[1:24:03] communists, they're meeting in our
[1:24:04] country. They have meetings, but they
[1:24:06] wanted to bring agenda. So, they're
[1:24:07] presenting it to make it law. And I read
[1:24:10] to you all those 21 things. I think
[1:24:12] there were brother uh I think brother
[1:24:14] Steven put me on to that, but I was I
[1:24:16] read all the things, you know, to break
[1:24:17] up homes, to uh to mess up the genders.
[1:24:21] It had it all there in the 60s. And so
[1:24:24] maybe they didn't get it passed back
[1:24:25] then in Congress, but they kept pushing
[1:24:27] it in colleges through professors right
[1:24:30] until communism. So now something rises
[1:24:34] up with the last election, last couple
[1:24:37] elections. This is filling our country.
[1:24:39] We all need to rise up against it and
[1:24:42] fight socialism and fight communism. And
[1:24:45] it is working a little bit because the
[1:24:47] things are being changed. But isn't it
[1:24:50] interesting that he says they'll have to
[1:24:52] find a common enemy with this image of
[1:24:55] the beast, something to fight against?
[1:24:57] We're all going to rise religiously and
[1:24:59] we're going to fight against this
[1:25:01] communism around the world and bring
[1:25:03] peace to the world and bring God to the
[1:25:05] world and maybe bring Christianity to
[1:25:08] the
[1:25:11] world. I I try to keep a right attitude.
[1:25:14] That all sounds good. Let's just be
[1:25:17] careful what channel it comes through.
[1:25:20] Is that okay to say it that way? Don't
[1:25:22] be duped. It sounds very good.
[1:25:31] Let's finish the quote
[1:25:34] now. to fight communism which will hook
[1:25:37] up with catechism, Catholic Catholicism,
[1:25:40] the Protestant church, the Catholic
[1:25:42] Church together. And the
[1:25:43] interdenominations who stand out for the
[1:25:45] truth and get away from the dogma that
[1:25:47] they got will be persecuted. The mark of
[1:25:49] the beast, the seal of God, the showdown
[1:25:51] will soon come. And brother, if that's
[1:25:53] not in there, they'll be deceived as
[1:25:54] sure as the world because it will look
[1:25:56] nice. It'll say now communism made for
[1:25:59] the world. Why? let us make another
[1:26:00] agreement and bring all the Christian
[1:26:02] and Christianize the world back and look
[1:26:05] so good the people will jump into it.
[1:26:07] See, they'll confederate the churches
[1:26:09] and bring and try to make Christianity
[1:26:11] one unit. And the Bible says in
[1:26:13] Revelations that he give his power and
[1:26:15] everything that he made an image unto
[1:26:18] the beast and exercise all the power the
[1:26:21] beast did before him in the first part
[1:26:22] of Revelations 13. Moving along now
[1:26:25] another thing there has to be a link as
[1:26:28] we read Revelations 13. There has to be
[1:26:31] a link made between that
[1:26:34] system and the US. There has to be a
[1:26:38] link. They have to form a system like
[1:26:41] the Roman system and then this week the
[1:26:45] white smoke comes out of the cyine
[1:26:50] chapel. Millions. Millions. How many's
[1:26:53] in first of all the that system they're
[1:26:56] rejoicing but the whole world's
[1:26:57] rejoicing that white smoke has come out
[1:27:00] of the cysteine chapel.
[1:27:03] I'll just say where there's smoke
[1:27:04] there's fire
[1:27:13] respectfully. This happens this week and
[1:27:16] by surprise the conclave chooses a
[1:27:21] pope from our
[1:27:25] America. And what's surprising is it was
[1:27:28] surprising to everybody. They never
[1:27:30] thought that would happen. It wasn't
[1:27:31] expected to happen. Uh we got commentary
[1:27:34] after commentary. Brother Jared was
[1:27:36] talking to some in the office this
[1:27:37] morning what he's been reading and it
[1:27:40] there was reasons why they said this
[1:27:42] never going to happen. never come and
[1:27:43] come come from the United States. Some
[1:27:45] did not want him to come from the United
[1:27:47] States. Some did, but they they'd say
[1:27:49] that'd be great if a pope came from the
[1:27:50] United States, but it's never going to
[1:27:52] happen. Then we go back to 1954. You
[1:27:54] probably read this on the internet this
[1:27:55] week. 1954, Acts of the Holy Spirit in
[1:27:58] Jeffersonville. I believe one of these
[1:28:00] glorious days when this United
[1:28:01] Confederation of Church goes together
[1:28:03] and the new pope is brought out of the
[1:28:05] United States and put over there
[1:28:07] according to prophecy. Then they'll form
[1:28:10] an image like unto the beast.
[1:28:14] And I tell you, the true church of God
[1:28:16] will be drove together.
[1:28:18] There's a positive note.
[1:28:22] May whatever is happening drive us
[1:28:24] together in love.
[1:28:27] I won't leave it alone. True believers
[1:28:29] out of Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian,
[1:28:33] Pentecostal, Nazarene, Pilgrim,
[1:28:35] Holiness, whatever they'll be, will go
[1:28:38] together and cement it by the love of
[1:28:40] God. How many's praying for that? Yeah.
[1:28:44] You don't want to write off anybody
[1:28:45] right now. Oh, they're a part of You
[1:28:47] don't know who's a part of that system.
[1:28:48] You don't know who's sold out to it. But
[1:28:51] let that love start between us. Let
[1:28:53] these events drive us together. But you
[1:28:56] see what I'm preaching on? It's a
[1:28:58] forming. And he says the next thing is
[1:29:00] the image of the beast. And the before
[1:29:01] it is a pope that's out of the United
[1:29:04] States. That's the one they chose. So
[1:29:06] once again, I'm not saying I'm saying
[1:29:08] could this be because I don't have a
[1:29:09] right to interpret this is the one could
[1:29:11] be another one from the United States
[1:29:13] later. I don't know. I don't have a
[1:29:14] right to do that. But I'm just pointing
[1:29:16] you to what he said is that it's very
[1:29:18] close to the forming of the beast when
[1:29:20] we have something like that happen
[1:29:22] scripturally. Scripturally there has to
[1:29:25] be a strong link between the United
[1:29:29] States Catholic Church and that and and
[1:29:33] over there. You can't get a stronger
[1:29:35] leak
[1:29:36] link to Revelations 13. You can't get a
[1:29:40] stronger link than choosing a pope of
[1:29:42] the United States.
[1:29:46] Finish the quote. Sorry. Cemented by the
[1:29:49] love of God that'll make the body of the
[1:29:50] Lord Jesus Christ all the believers and
[1:29:53] agnostics and shallow-minded will be
[1:29:55] cast to one side. That's an interesting
[1:29:58] thing. I'd like to preach a sermon on
[1:30:00] that. The agnostics and the
[1:30:02] shallowminded. This isn't a time to be
[1:30:05] shallowminded. This is a time for a
[1:30:07] revelation deep in your soul. Yes.
[1:30:10] And they'll go right on into the
[1:30:11] confederation of your Now, Brother
[1:30:13] Brandham said this in December of 1954
[1:30:16] about a pope coming from America.
[1:30:20] December 1954. Mr.
[1:30:24] Pvost from Chicago was conceived in
[1:30:27] December of 1954. The reason we know
[1:30:29] that, a minister looked it up. Nine
[1:30:31] months later he was born in
[1:30:33] 1955. If you set the time the same time
[1:30:36] brother Bram said this is the same time
[1:30:39] he had to be conceived which would be
[1:30:41] the next pope come the first pope from
[1:30:44] America and the next pope that we have
[1:30:46] now. No one expected it. I've heard it
[1:30:47] over and over. This would have never
[1:30:49] happened to have one come from the
[1:30:51] United States. the Silver Bulletin, Nate
[1:30:53] Silver says um in many of the news
[1:30:57] outlets by at least publishing an
[1:30:59] article earlier this week that covered
[1:31:01] the buzz Pos was generating. What he's
[1:31:03] saying is that the week before they were
[1:31:05] saying there's no way this can happen.
[1:31:06] There's no way. However, they ultimately
[1:31:09] dismissed his candidacy, Prieos
[1:31:11] candidacy by citing a scholar who said
[1:31:13] that the church wouldn't want to give
[1:31:14] America any more influence. Yes, but a
[1:31:19] pope from the United States is unlikely
[1:31:21] for several reasons, including that an
[1:31:24] American pope would give the US more
[1:31:27] influence than it already has. Lyola
[1:31:30] University scholar Michael Cares te
[1:31:32] tells that then Mr. uh bulletin says
[1:31:36] here on in in this he says with the
[1:31:37] benefit of hindsight this logic seems to
[1:31:40] have the polarity of the situation
[1:31:42] reversed. The Catholic Church might not
[1:31:46] want the United States to have more
[1:31:49] influence, but it might want to have
[1:31:52] more influence on the United States.
[1:31:56] This isn't a guy with the Holy Ghost.
[1:31:58] This is a guy saying, "Why? We didn't
[1:32:00] want this. Why?" And he said, "Could it
[1:32:02] be? It's not so much they was they
[1:32:04] didn't want it because they wanted to
[1:32:06] keep America's strong influence." Now
[1:32:09] Trump has influence around the world.
[1:32:11] Okay? We're keeping that away from the
[1:32:12] Catholic Church. But maybe it was we can
[1:32:15] come in and influence the United States
[1:32:18] more fitting right with Revelations 13.
[1:32:23] How do you form an image of the beast to
[1:32:25] that system unless you have this type of
[1:32:28] type of link? And I really believe
[1:32:30] that's why he said it. I'm going to read
[1:32:32] more one more quote if you give me five
[1:32:34] minutes. I want to complete this if we
[1:32:36] can. And the Rome had a religious system
[1:32:39] whose deadly head or deadly wound killed
[1:32:41] him in his head. I trust that young
[1:32:44] people, the children that can everybody
[1:32:46] can understand today when you go to
[1:32:48] Revelations 13 in your own Bibles, you
[1:32:50] can understand that symbols. But God has
[1:32:52] blessed us to be able to see this is the
[1:32:55] United States. You live in the United
[1:32:57] States and you will see this forming
[1:33:00] quicker and quicker and quicker, which
[1:33:03] points us to a rapture time. Yes. Amen.
[1:33:06] I want to be ready, don't you? And now
[1:33:09] they're going to make an image to it out
[1:33:11] of the beast that comes out of
[1:33:12] Revelations 13. All the other beasts
[1:33:14] come out of the water, which is
[1:33:15] thickness, multitudes, and peoples. The
[1:33:16] Bible said, "But this little beast come
[1:33:18] out of the earth where there was no
[1:33:20] people. Yet he was a lamb, freedom of
[1:33:22] religion. Then see it formed into then
[1:33:25] he spake like a dragon and united
[1:33:27] himself with a power and then all the
[1:33:30] dragon did before him." Exactly. So
[1:33:32] where you are, it's just got to be that
[1:33:35] way. No other way of getting around it.
[1:33:37] And here we today, here we are today
[1:33:39] forming a system. A system. We can't
[1:33:43] wait till some we tried to make every
[1:33:45] everybody become Lutheran. Couldn't do
[1:33:47] it. We tried to make them look at all
[1:33:49] the years of the efforts of
[1:33:51] denominational systems with the effort
[1:33:53] same effort as as Pharisees proceliting.
[1:33:56] Tried to make them all Baptist. We
[1:33:58] couldn't do it. All become Methodists.
[1:33:59] All become Pentecostal and they couldn't
[1:34:01] do it. So in order to do this the time
[1:34:03] is so short they have formed a council
[1:34:06] ahead an image to the beast. That's
[1:34:09] exactly what they've done. And Jesus
[1:34:12] spoke of this not as
[1:34:14] communism. So there we have they'll make
[1:34:18] the problem and the common enemy
[1:34:20] communism. But I want to tell everybody
[1:34:22] today that's a lie.
[1:34:26] The problem isn't commun that is a
[1:34:28] problem but that's not the most
[1:34:30] deceiving thing. The most deceiving
[1:34:32] thing will be a religious system that we
[1:34:35] partake of in mindset or service and
[1:34:38] you'll be forced to join it. That's
[1:34:40] true.
[1:34:42] Jesus spoke of this not as communism but
[1:34:45] in Matthew 24 beginning with the 21st to
[1:34:47] 26th verse. He predicted that the spirit
[1:34:50] in this system would be so much like the
[1:34:52] real thing till it would deceive the
[1:34:54] very elected. If it was possible, the
[1:34:56] elected whose names are put on the
[1:34:58] lamb's book of life before the
[1:35:00] foundation of the world. The book of
[1:35:02] revelation says says this beast will
[1:35:05] deceive all the world. They'll all
[1:35:09] wonder after it
[1:35:13] blindly except those names that are
[1:35:17] written in the lamb's book of life.
[1:35:20] Everybody will and it'll be so close it
[1:35:22] would deceive the elect if possible. you
[1:35:24] said that means it's not going to just
[1:35:26] be blatantly out there say oh this type
[1:35:28] of Christianity oh that couldn't be
[1:35:30] wrong be careful
[1:35:33] it'll be so close it'll look like the
[1:35:34] real thing
[1:35:36] and yet many will be taken in by it and
[1:35:39] yet there'll be a
[1:35:44] people I don't want to boast of it but I
[1:35:47] just want to say there will be a people
[1:35:50] who turn it down and there will be a
[1:35:52] people who escape
[1:35:55] before the real force
[1:35:59] comes. We're already in a squeeze. We
[1:36:01] already feel persecution. Sometimes I
[1:36:04] feel it from people that are even closer
[1:36:06] to me. You feel that
[1:36:09] pressure. Felt it a few years
[1:36:12] ago. I guess it's been 13 years ago when
[1:36:16] a spirit kind of rose in the church with
[1:36:17] a couple brothers and they wanted me to
[1:36:20] change and distance myself from this
[1:36:23] message and the quotes and become just a
[1:36:26] bibleelving church where we didn't read
[1:36:28] the message and they in a brother's
[1:36:31] meeting they were just asking questions
[1:36:33] and you could just sense and the
[1:36:36] brothers the other brothers could sense
[1:36:38] they answer to these brothers and I
[1:36:40] respect them they've gone on now to to
[1:36:43] what they believe, that's fine. But
[1:36:45] there was an effort before they left to
[1:36:47] change this. Brother Brandon had a dream
[1:36:50] while it was going on that he came into
[1:36:52] our church that was our old church and
[1:36:54] the whole altar was completely with a
[1:36:57] bunch of flowers and just looked like
[1:37:00] Cain's Cain's sacrifice very beautiful
[1:37:04] and looked like a Catholic
[1:37:07] um a Catholic altar and a Catholic
[1:37:10] pulpit. very very much like that. And he
[1:37:13] said that was that spirit trying to get
[1:37:16] you off of the word of this message to
[1:37:19] turn this thing into that system. And
[1:37:22] God, not through me, but God rose up
[1:37:24] through different brothers in that
[1:37:26] meeting that we had and they spoke up
[1:37:28] and says, you know, we believe we want
[1:37:31] to stand with this word and we want to
[1:37:33] stand with a pastor who's staying with
[1:37:35] this message.
[1:37:38] Isn't it interesting though that I get a
[1:37:40] few criticisms saying, "I don't even
[1:37:42] preach this message anymore."
[1:37:45] And then my congregation laughs because
[1:37:47] they know that's not true. I believe
[1:37:49] this with all my heart. I believe it was
[1:37:51] the seventh angel God sent to us. I
[1:37:53] believe he opened up the Bible to us and
[1:37:55] all the fanaticism and all the things
[1:37:57] that even we may not know the complete
[1:38:00] prophecies
[1:38:02] still our heart is anchored
[1:38:05] not to William Brandham but to Jesus
[1:38:07] Christ the revealer of the word our
[1:38:10] heart is anchored to Jesus Christ who is
[1:38:12] the word the Jesus Christ is not 2,000
[1:38:16] years ago some figment of our
[1:38:18] imagination that we dream up no Jesus is
[1:38:21] the word of every generation. That's the
[1:38:24] person of Jesus that reveals the word to
[1:38:27] every generation. And when we find the
[1:38:29] word to our generation, we find Jesus.
[1:38:32] We stand with him. We believe it. Can I
[1:38:35] get an amen out of some of
[1:38:38] you? And we're going to stand with the
[1:38:40] truth of it despite the criticism,
[1:38:43] besides the spirits that come in and try
[1:38:45] you just adjust things a little bit. No,
[1:38:46] no. We're not going to try to explain it
[1:38:49] unless God gives us a revelation of it.
[1:38:51] We're standing with this because this is
[1:38:53] the thing. Most of the stuff I preach
[1:38:55] today, I couldn't even preach unless my
[1:38:57] eyes were open by the seventh angel to
[1:39:00] see what the system was.
[1:39:03] We wouldn't even know it except the
[1:39:04] eyesight of a prophet. And now we don't
[1:39:08] have to emphasize the prophet. Remember
[1:39:10] there's an image to the prophet in book
[1:39:11] of Daniel that got it wrong. They said,
[1:39:13] "Let's build an image to Daniel.
[1:39:17] Let's build an image to William
[1:39:18] Brandom." No, no, no, no. That's
[1:39:20] deception, too.
[1:39:22] This isn't an image to a system. It
[1:39:25] isn't a movement. It isn't a system of a
[1:39:28] dress code. It's not to make another
[1:39:30] denomination. It's just purely the word
[1:39:33] of God. Whether it's modesty or whatever
[1:39:35] it is, it's just what the word said.
[1:39:37] Blessed be his name. There's nothing
[1:39:40] tainted. There's nothing added to it.
[1:39:42] We're staying with it. We're believing
[1:39:44] with all of our heart because we see
[1:39:46] these things in the news happening. And
[1:39:48] we know the greatest vindication that
[1:39:51] this is true is not because I stand
[1:39:52] there and try to argue with you. This is
[1:39:54] true. This is true. No, no, no. The
[1:39:55] vindication is coming. God's going to
[1:39:57] prove this thing is right.
[1:40:00] But we won't be idolizing a man. I'll
[1:40:03] shake Brother Ram's hand when I get the
[1:40:04] other say, "God bless you, brother."
[1:40:06] He'll shake my hand. Say, "God bless
[1:40:07] you, brother." Because that's just the
[1:40:09] way he believed it. He was a brother
[1:40:10] born in sin shaped in iniquity but used
[1:40:13] greatly of the Lord to like John the
[1:40:15] Baptist to come and introduce the first
[1:40:17] coming of Christ. And John said when I
[1:40:20] introduced him says there's the lamb. I
[1:40:23] must decrease he must increase. Our
[1:40:25] prophet would have said the same thing
[1:40:27] if he was here this morning. I have
[1:40:29] introduced you to the word Christ. Now
[1:40:33] William Brennham decreases and Christ
[1:40:35] increases.
[1:40:37] It's the same way. I'm not in some cult.
[1:40:40] I don't believe some man. I believe
[1:40:42] God's men that he's chosen from Luther,
[1:40:45] Wesley, Paul, Isaiah. Can you say I
[1:40:49] believe all the prophets of the Bible,
[1:40:51] but I don't idolize those men.
[1:40:54] Only the God that was in them. All of my
[1:40:58] worship belongs to Jesus Christ.
[1:41:01] The eternal word, the the the word made
[1:41:05] flesh to every generation.
[1:41:08] My my heart is just crying out to you
[1:41:10] today. You're on the internet and people
[1:41:12] make you teeter totter and you don't
[1:41:14] know where you stand. I tell you, you
[1:41:16] need to get into the Bible and get into
[1:41:18] this message and find out where you
[1:41:20] stand.
[1:41:21] Don't listen to those voices.
[1:41:24] Because there's one thing that we need
[1:41:26] to be in these times. We need to be
[1:41:28] stable in the word of God. We need to
[1:41:30] know that we know that we know. You can
[1:41:33] have a mama telling you little hints of
[1:41:36] doubt.
[1:41:38] Amen. You can have a family member say,
[1:41:41] but but but you don't need to listen to
[1:41:44] that. You need to listen to the word.
[1:41:45] There's only one voice. That's the voice
[1:41:47] of truth.
[1:41:50] Some people got one in, one foot into
[1:41:53] this and one foot out still, and they
[1:41:55] think they'll be safe. And I'm here to
[1:41:56] tell you, you're not safe. You need to
[1:41:58] make your choice.
[1:42:00] Be filled with the spirit. Your lamps
[1:42:03] trimmed,
[1:42:05] glowing. Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:42:07] Something needs to be settled in your
[1:42:09] life cuz this system is not easily
[1:42:12] detected detected. It takes the Holy
[1:42:14] Ghost in a person in the word to see
[1:42:16] what it really is. Say, I want to be
[1:42:18] accepted. I want to be careful your
[1:42:20] right hand of fellowship to give people
[1:42:22] so they're not maybe they'd be
[1:42:23] influencing you.
[1:42:26] I go back to that
[1:42:29] broadcast the the
[1:42:31] local Christian station. I'm not done
[1:42:35] yet here.
[1:42:38] And some of you say, "I wish he was
[1:42:39] done."
[1:42:41] The local Christian station asked us for
[1:42:44] a couple years to pay for a broadcast
[1:42:45] and be on there. And so, finally, we got
[1:42:48] it all together with getting it
[1:42:50] organized. Brother Kyle, Sister Laura,
[1:42:51] they're going to edit and we're going to
[1:42:53] put it up there and got to that. I had
[1:42:54] to sign the paperwork to go on to the
[1:42:56] Christian station, which is what I would
[1:42:58] have preferred to go on. I sent it in,
[1:43:01] emailed it to them. I wouldn't sign that
[1:43:03] we believe God in three persons. I said,
[1:43:05] "I'm sorry. I won't sign that. We
[1:43:07] believe it's God in three offices, but
[1:43:09] it's one God. It's not three persons."
[1:43:12] And I just keep that symbol. If you want
[1:43:13] me to write more on this, I can, but I
[1:43:16] just I won't sign that. They said, "We
[1:43:18] can't we can't have you on." Wow. Turned
[1:43:21] us
[1:43:22] down. Now, can you imagine? A secular
[1:43:26] station
[1:43:28] didn't make that an issue, but the
[1:43:30] Christian church made Trinity an issue.
[1:43:35] Now you think about that. I got shut out
[1:43:38] even though I had the money. Thankfully
[1:43:39] after 30 years I had some money to pay
[1:43:41] for a
[1:43:43] broadcast.
[1:43:45] But I got shut out of the Christian
[1:43:48] church. I got
[1:43:49] persecuted. We're not the to the days of
[1:43:52] buy or sell yet, but I got persecuted. I
[1:43:55] got shut out from the Christian
[1:43:57] establishment.
[1:44:01] But but someone else who doesn't hold
[1:44:04] that doctrine, they say, you know, you
[1:44:07] you'll pay. If you want to pay, we'll
[1:44:09] have you on.
[1:44:10] Now, if if Kyle and Laura put some of
[1:44:13] this stuff on today, I'm let them make
[1:44:16] the decisions. It might be my last
[1:44:17] broadcast. I don't
[1:44:20] know. But I'm happy to get what time I
[1:44:23] have because I'm not here to say that
[1:44:25] I'm right and everybody else is wrong.
[1:44:26] I'm here to say there's a truth. There's
[1:44:29] a Babylon and God has sent a voice to
[1:44:31] call us out of Babylon. And I want to
[1:44:34] stay out of that. And even if I try to
[1:44:36] stay, I'm going to be persecuted. I'm
[1:44:38] gonna be looked down on our what we wear
[1:44:41] from what we wear all the way to what we
[1:44:43] believe. We're going to receive
[1:44:45] pressure, a squeeze. Won't be like the
[1:44:48] tribulation, but it's already started.
[1:44:52] And I just say
[1:44:54] again, brother Bobby, even so come, Lord
[1:44:59] Jesus.
[1:45:01] Even so come, Lord
[1:45:04] Jesus. God calling us to repentance if
[1:45:07] we're not
[1:45:08] right. So I'm I'm I'm closing this today
[1:45:13] calling you to
[1:45:15] repentance. If there's anything in my
[1:45:18] life that's resisting truth in all of
[1:45:20] its light and glory, Lord, take it out
[1:45:23] of my life. Amen. I repent before your
[1:45:26] presence this morning. Would you bow
[1:45:27] your heads? Would you do that this
[1:45:29] morning? Because we need to be
[1:45:32] established and know where we
[1:45:35] stand in this time of
[1:45:38] pressure. We need to be unmovable. We
[1:45:41] need to be settled. We need the rock.
[1:45:45] Be very
[1:45:47] sure. Be very
[1:45:51] sure. Your anchor
[1:45:54] holds and grips the
[1:45:59] solid. George Beverly Sheay sang this
[1:46:01] song, that first
[1:46:03] verse. In times like
[1:46:07] these, we need a
[1:46:11] Savior. In times like
[1:46:16] these, we need an
[1:46:21] anchor. Be very
[1:46:24] [Music]
[1:46:26] sure. Be
[1:46:28] very
[1:46:30] sure. Oh yes,
[1:46:32] Lord. Your anchor
[1:46:36] [Music]
[1:46:37] holds and grips the solid.
[1:46:43] [Music]
[1:46:45] Now we before we sing and it just bow
[1:46:46] your heads and you speak to the Lord.
[1:46:49] He's here. You don't need to speak to
[1:46:51] me. I'm only a channel to tell you what
[1:46:54] truth is. But you speak to our Lord and
[1:46:57] he will receive a heart that really is
[1:47:01] repentant before
[1:47:02] him. He will receive that heart. He can
[1:47:06] create something and take
[1:47:08] you open your
[1:47:12] eyes. Revelations 3 it says that you
[1:47:14] give us IsaV and anoint our eyes that we
[1:47:17] could see the word and see these
[1:47:19] prophecies and to see things forming
[1:47:22] coming into what they would be. How many
[1:47:24] would raise your hand and say the
[1:47:26] prophecies are forming but let the image
[1:47:29] of Christ form in me. Let me be formed
[1:47:34] into more of the image of Christ. Let me
[1:47:36] be
[1:47:37] formed. That's the forming that I want
[1:47:40] to see more than anything. Heavenly
[1:47:43] Father, we do repent before you, Lord.
[1:47:46] The cry of the bride is, "I'm wrong.
[1:47:50] You're right, and we're
[1:47:53] wrong. Your word is right, and we're
[1:47:56] wrong."
[1:47:57] [Music]
[1:47:58] There is a pressure today, Lord, on the
[1:48:02] people through social media and
[1:48:04] different opinions and different seeds
[1:48:08] of doubt that's planted. There's a
[1:48:11] pressure that comes with it. Lord, even
[1:48:13] homes are feeling pressures.
[1:48:16] But Lord, I pray that the the rock that
[1:48:19] you've given us to stand on, the h the
[1:48:22] secret place you've given us to run into
[1:48:24] to be really safe. I pray that was
[1:48:27] presented to these lives, these young
[1:48:29] lives. Father, these young boys, these
[1:48:32] young girls, Lord, they they understand.
[1:48:34] They see it. So Lord, as you open their
[1:48:36] eyes, I pray that they would open their
[1:48:38] hearts and trust you, follow you, Lord,
[1:48:41] and give you, Lord, a a a complete
[1:48:44] surrender to Jesus Christ. Grant it,
[1:48:47] Father, we pray. Lord, we commit every
[1:48:50] precious life into your hands. Even
[1:48:52] those listening, Lord, whether they are
[1:48:54] listening, whatever stage they're at,
[1:48:57] just help them, Lord, to simplify. This
[1:49:00] is Jesus Christ manifested in the word
[1:49:03] of the hour. His word being fulfilled
[1:49:05] and he and he's calling for a full
[1:49:07] surrender. It's just that simple. Grant
[1:49:10] it. Father, we rejoice in prophecy being
[1:49:14] fulfilled in Jesus name. Amen. Look at
[1:49:17] this second verse now. If you want to
[1:49:19] stand. I know you've been sitting a long
[1:49:20] time. In times like
[1:49:26] these, we
[1:49:28] need the
[1:49:30] [Music]
[1:49:33] Bible in times like
[1:49:38] these. Oh, be not
[1:49:45] idle. Be very sure. Be very sure. Be
[1:49:53] very
[1:49:57] sure. Your anchor
[1:50:02] holds and grips the
[1:50:07] solid. Ah, bring it up one key. First
[1:50:10] verse again. In times like these, sing
[1:50:15] it with all your heart.
[1:50:17] Now we need a
[1:50:21] savior. Yes, Lord. You need a
[1:50:26] savior. You need a
[1:50:29] savior. We need
[1:50:35] anor. Be
[1:50:37] very
[1:50:41] sure. Be
[1:50:43] very sure.
[1:50:46] [Music]
[1:50:48] Your anchor
[1:50:52] holds and grips the
[1:50:57] solid
[1:51:02] ground. Hallelujah. Let's give glory to
[1:51:05] the Lord. Amen. God is good. His word is
[1:51:10] good. Praise the
[1:51:13] Lord. Amen. and I'm going to dismiss you
[1:51:16] in Jesus name. God bless you all. May
[1:51:19] have a wonderful day with your moms and
[1:51:21] such. Be grateful that I didn't speak on
[1:51:22] the mother of harlots
[1:51:24] today, but I pray our eyes would be open
[1:51:27] and we could stand stable and know where
[1:51:29] we stand in this hour. Even our young
[1:51:31] people, even our young girls, our young
[1:51:33] guys, they need to see these things. God
[1:51:35] bless you. God be with you each one. And
[1:51:38] be very sure that your anchor holds and
[1:51:41] grips the solid rock. The name of the
[1:51:43] Lord is a strong tower wherein the
[1:51:45] righteous run into it and they're safe.
[1:51:48] Can you say amen? Sister Sharon still
[1:51:51] here? I don't think she's still here.
[1:51:56] Would you come Sharon?
[1:51:57] [Music]
[1:52:00] We'll just pray for Sister Sharon again.
[1:52:04] We're not backing down.
[1:52:07] [Music]
[1:52:09] Amen.
[1:52:10] In the days of Paul, they took from his
[1:52:15] body cloth
[1:52:17] sometimes. They lay hands on. And I
[1:52:21] wanted to This was given to me by
[1:52:23] brother Steve West. And it was a
[1:52:27] handkerchief from the prophet. So, we're
[1:52:29] privileged to have it. It's not this
[1:52:31] that heals. It's the blood of Jesus
[1:52:33] Christ. But we need to join in prayer
[1:52:36] again against the enemy, against this
[1:52:39] tumor, and ask the Lord to curse it. Ask
[1:52:42] the Lord to stop it and dissolve it.
[1:52:46] Amen.
[1:52:47] Amen. Let's join together. Heavenly
[1:52:51] Father, we appeal to your throne again,
[1:52:54] Lord.
[1:52:56] And like we spoke Wednesday night about
[1:52:58] the woman who kept coming to the unjust
[1:53:01] judge, Lord, she wearied him by her
[1:53:04] continual coming. I know in prayer your
[1:53:07] daughter here comes to you probably by
[1:53:10] the minute, Lord, asking for a
[1:53:15] miracle. But Lord, today she has many in
[1:53:18] the body of Christ that is appealing to
[1:53:21] you again. It's coming to you again. And
[1:53:24] we are asking Lord Jesus that you bring
[1:53:26] the healing. We believe we stand upon
[1:53:30] the healing of Calvary and the stripes
[1:53:34] upon your back. We've seen it over and
[1:53:36] over again, Lord. And so, Father, we
[1:53:39] take this cloth from our prophet of this
[1:53:41] generation. Lord, we touch your body
[1:53:44] with it. We're asking, Lord, it's not
[1:53:45] the cloth, but we're asking, Lord, that
[1:53:47] faith would be anointed, Father, to be
[1:53:50] able to reach out and claim, say, I
[1:53:51] believe that I'm healed with all my
[1:53:53] heart. God, this is a woman of faith.
[1:53:56] She doesn't back down. She stays
[1:53:58] positive. So, Lord, we want to be an an
[1:54:00] energy and strength to her today and
[1:54:03] say, "Satan, you are defeated.
[1:54:09] You have
[1:54:10] badgered. You
[1:54:13] have scared this life long enough.
[1:54:18] We rebuke you in the name of Jesus
[1:54:20] Christ.
[1:54:23] We curse that demon of cancer.
[1:54:26] [Music]
[1:54:30] Oh enemy, we know that you're listening.
[1:54:33] If what I preach is the truth today,
[1:54:35] Lord, we stand upon the word. Satan, if
[1:54:39] you're listening, I know you are. The
[1:54:42] word, the healing that's in your word,
[1:54:46] is still available today. And we believe
[1:54:49] it. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[1:54:52] today, and
[1:54:54] forever. Curse it in Jesus' name. And
[1:54:56] may the
[1:54:57] healing continue, Lord, we
[1:55:00] pray. Give our dear sister the miracle
[1:55:03] that she she is holding in front of you,
[1:55:06] Lord. The promise she's holding in
[1:55:08] front. Give her that miracle. She looks
[1:55:09] more in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:55:11] Christ. We ask it. Let the work be
[1:55:15] done in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:55:19] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Let's praise
[1:55:22] God. Let's praise him. Let's praise
[1:55:26] [Music]
[1:55:27] him.
[1:55:31] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:55:37] Hallelujah. Oh
[1:55:39] Lord, you are good.
[1:55:41] [Music]
[1:55:42] Father, you are a mighty God. Thank you,
[1:55:46] Lord Jesus. Your word is true. Thank
[1:55:49] you, Jesus.
[1:55:52] Satan, you're defeated. Satan, you're a
[1:55:54] bluff. You're defeated in Jesus name.
[1:55:58] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:56:01] Hallelujah. Blessed be our God. Amen.
[1:56:05] Oh, brother Kenny, the name of the Lord
[1:56:07] is a strong tower wherein the righteous
[1:56:10] run into it and are
[1:56:13] safe. Hallelujah. Before we go today,
[1:56:15] let's rejoice. The rapture is just near
[1:56:19] us, friends. How many give me rapturing
[1:56:22] faith? I don't care about America
[1:56:24] becoming safe again. I want to be safe
[1:56:27] in that rock. Can you say
[1:56:29] amen? Hallelujah. Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord.
[1:56:34] [Music]
[1:56:35] Hallelujah. The name of the Lord
[1:56:40] is a
