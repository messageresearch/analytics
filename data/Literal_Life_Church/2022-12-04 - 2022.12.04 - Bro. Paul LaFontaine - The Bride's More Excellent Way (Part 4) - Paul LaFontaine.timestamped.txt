[0:00] Peter chapter 3 a portion of scripture
[0:03] we welcome is that sister Lily with us
[0:05] with uh I know her name but I don't know
[0:07] the other one what's your name sister
[0:10] Chantel nice to have you girls and
[0:13] you're sitting right behind Ryan so make
[0:14] sure you let you connect with Rye their
[0:16] own buddy buddies from way back good to
[0:18] have you this morning and all the other
[0:19] visitors God bless you all
[0:22] where did I say we were reading okay
[0:24] First Peter chapter 3. First Peter
[0:27] chapter 3 is we're going to take the
[0:29] text out of this morning
[0:30] mm-hmm
[0:32] God is good amen God is good all the
[0:35] time
[0:37] first Peter
[0:40] chapter 3
[0:42] and verse 8
[0:47] . now this portion of scripture will be
[0:51] that I'll read will be
[0:54] um in in relation to our response and
[0:58] our courtesy to to others and
[1:03] Paul comes into verse 8 speaking about
[1:06] marriage before I'll let you read that
[1:08] on your own but he's speaking about
[1:09] marriage and you have to have honor in
[1:12] marriage Christian honor and christ-like
[1:15] honor and marriage or the marriage does
[1:16] not work right and for Christian
[1:18] marriages if you skip back to verse 7
[1:20] likewise ye husbands dwell with them
[1:23] according to knowledge giving honor unto
[1:26] the wife as unto the weaker vessel and
[1:28] as being heirs together of the grace of
[1:30] life that your prayers be not hindered
[1:32] the honor thing and the respect for one
[1:34] another shows up and our word shows up
[1:36] in our attitude and that happens every
[1:39] day in a marriage if it's going to be
[1:40] right then your treatment of one another
[1:42] should be with honor that's how things
[1:44] work right that's how the Holy Spirit
[1:46] works in your marriage so this is a
[1:48] scriptural thing so this is what he's
[1:49] talking about and he applies it to to
[1:51] the marriage first but now he just
[1:53] expands it to everybody when he says in
[1:55] verse 8 finally be ye all of One mind
[1:58] and having compassion one of another
[2:01] love as brethren be pitiful be courteous
[2:05] not rendering evil for evil or railing
[2:08] for railing that's not how we respond is
[2:11] that they were evil to me so I'm going
[2:13] to respond with the same thing they
[2:15] deserve it but contrary wise blessing
[2:18] knowing that did he just say that we
[2:20] respond with the blessing to somebody
[2:22] being evil to us yes he did
[2:25] not many amens on that one but yes he
[2:27] did that's what he said that's how we
[2:29] respond contrary wise a blessing knowing
[2:32] that ye are there into called so this is
[2:34] a calling as a Christian did you know as
[2:36] a Christian it's not just being a
[2:38] Christian that you're called to what the
[2:40] scripture says you're called to that
[2:41] this is a calling the rest of the world
[2:43] doesn't have a calling you have a
[2:45] calling you also have a calling to take
[2:47] this gospel into the whole world you
[2:49] have a calling to be a witness can you
[2:51] say Amen you don't live in your own
[2:52] little your own little world but we're
[2:54] called to be witnesses to everybody and
[2:57] so we're called to this type of Life of
[3:01] responding and blessing instead of evil
[3:03] for evil that ye should inherit a
[3:05] blessing verse 10 for he that will love
[3:07] life and see good days let him refrain
[3:10] his tongue from evil and his lips that
[3:13] they speak no guile let him issue evil
[3:17] and do good let him seek peace and ensue
[3:22] it let's pray heavenly father bless your
[3:25] word anoint it to day Lord I pray you'll
[3:27] give me Grace from your throne that I
[3:29] can minister to it in Lord in the way
[3:32] that you want it to come across and we
[3:33] commit that to you in the name of the
[3:35] Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you
[3:38] shake somebody's hand as you sit down
[3:39] today in Christian love God bless you
[3:41] each one
[3:45] now by the grace of God I'm I'm uh I'm
[3:48] just going to take a couple more of the
[3:51] attributes of divine Love In First
[3:54] Corinthians 13 to take our time with
[3:56] this and this series is called the
[3:58] bride's more excellent way because Paul
[4:00] introduced something greater than the
[4:02] gifts and all these other things
[4:04] something better a more excellent way
[4:07] and I'm preaching that more excellent
[4:09] Way To You Paul introduced it to the
[4:11] church back in First Corinthians 13 and
[4:13] so I'm going to hold up more of the
[4:15] attributes of the image of Christ First
[4:18] Corinthians 13 just to bring you into
[4:20] the channel that we've been speaking of
[4:21] First Corinthians 13 in your Bible to me
[4:24] is a window it's a window into the
[4:26] deepest place a Christian can enter
[4:29] First Corinthians 13 is the deepest
[4:32] place that a Christian can enter in
[4:34] their Christian wall it is deeper than
[4:37] all the other manifestations of the
[4:39] spirit and what it does it's deeper than
[4:41] all the other manifestations of the
[4:43] spirit in the church and what it does
[4:45] what he presents is the more excellent
[4:47] way is beyond faith how many believe
[4:50] that we preach Faith how many believe
[4:52] that just stay back at the other screen
[4:54] we preach faith and we believe in faith
[4:57] how many believe that you can have faith
[4:58] to move mountains how many believe God
[5:00] can raise the Dead
[5:02] how many believe there's enough faith in
[5:03] this word that come that the blind eyes
[5:05] can be open cancer can be healed God is
[5:08] nothing impossible with God and we need
[5:10] perfect faith we need Faith to do that
[5:12] so we're not dumping out Faith how many
[5:14] believe that's important for us to read
[5:16] our Bible and to get knowledge of the
[5:17] word of course it is how many believe
[5:19] it's important important just to have
[5:21] knowledge read the word but to ask God
[5:23] to give you Revelation the word because
[5:25] reading is is one thing but Revelation
[5:27] is another of the word Jesus talked
[5:29] about Revelation the disciples asked him
[5:31] why do you speak in Parables why do you
[5:33] speak in Parables why don't you just
[5:36] come out plainly he said because it's
[5:38] given to you disciples to know the
[5:40] Mysteries Behind The Parables but it's
[5:42] not given to some and so I speak in
[5:44] Parables to draw the attention but if
[5:47] we'll ask God he'll give you the meaning
[5:48] for the parable and you'll understand
[5:50] the word can you say Amen so we believe
[5:52] in knowledge we believe in reading our
[5:54] Bibles we should do that we believe in
[5:56] faith but what Paul introduces here is
[6:00] deeper than the manifestations of of the
[6:02] spirit deeper than the gifts it's beyond
[6:05] faith it's beyond knowledge it's beyond
[6:08] good works
[6:11] this is something for a Christian Beyond
[6:13] good works and how many believe we
[6:15] should do good works of course we should
[6:17] that's part of our Christian Journey as
[6:19] well we should do good things we should
[6:21] give to the poor but when he says though
[6:22] I give my body to be burned and give all
[6:24] my goods to feed the poor and have not
[6:26] charity I am nothing this more excellent
[6:29] way has to be our pursuit or all the
[6:32] good works that we do mean nothing
[6:35] so we can't pursue those things and a
[6:37] lot of those things sometimes feel
[6:39] better is to give to the poor you feel
[6:41] good about yourself it feels good when
[6:43] you're Anointed with some type of gift
[6:44] of the spirit oh it's it's some it's
[6:47] it's it feels good but yeah listen Paul
[6:49] says you can have all that and not have
[6:51] Divine love
[6:54] and can you say Amen
[6:55] and sometimes when you preach on Divine
[6:57] love what I'm going to do today it
[6:58] doesn't feel very good let me just warn
[7:01] you when I get into the traits today
[7:02] it's not going to feel very good because
[7:04] most of us most of us are going to leave
[7:06] the service today saying Lord I I need
[7:09] help
[7:11] can you say man I need help
[7:14] but nevertheless it feels better to give
[7:16] the poor it feels good when you rise to
[7:19] a faith and pray for somebody lay hands
[7:20] and they're healed of cancer that feels
[7:22] better and God will continue to do those
[7:24] things but we if we ignore in our
[7:27] Christian walk this more excellent way
[7:29] we are a troubling person because we're
[7:31] ignoring the most excellent way and the
[7:33] the better thing for the Christian to
[7:35] pursue
[7:36] and so it's beyond faith it's beyond
[7:39] knowledge it's beyond good works it's
[7:41] beyond of what true Christianity has
[7:44] always produced for two thousand years
[7:45] it's this this love is greater than hope
[7:50] it's greater than Faith Can you say Amen
[7:52] let me ask you this this morning if we
[7:55] are in the end time and if we are on the
[7:57] finishing the Capstone of God's work in
[8:00] a people for two thousand years
[8:02] Christianity started 2 000 years ago and
[8:05] so now God has been in this work to take
[8:08] out a people for his namesake to take
[8:10] out a people to to bring them to a
[8:12] culmination to a Capstone if we are in
[8:16] that finishing Capstone work on God's
[8:18] people then shouldn't we be entering
[8:21] into the best expression of who he is at
[8:25] these Final hours I'm asking
[8:26] shouldn't this be the time
[8:28] that we enter the final Capstone and the
[8:32] final expression of who Jesus is in a
[8:35] people
[8:37] I think it's time
[8:39] and if Paul opened to us the more
[8:41] excellent way shouldn't this be our
[8:43] desperation more than any other thing
[8:46] that this be our expression as a
[8:49] Christian that this be if Paul opened it
[8:52] up to us shouldn't this be our
[8:54] desperation more than anything
[8:57] I think it's a good question
[8:59] shouldn't this be our Pursuit more than
[9:01] possessions
[9:04] more than careers
[9:07] more than School
[9:09] more than education
[9:11] don't dump any of that out but there's a
[9:14] Pursuit more than more than that
[9:17] that fishing boat that your brothers
[9:19] want
[9:23] right more than that new dress that new
[9:26] outfit your sisters want and you're
[9:28] you're given hints to your husband the
[9:31] next few weeks
[9:33] more than any other Pursuit
[9:36] this as a Christian should be Lord I got
[9:39] this lane from me God this is the final
[9:42] age is the final time God let the people
[9:45] see this Divine love in my life
[9:48] can I get an amen this morning praise
[9:51] the Lord so but because but you see
[9:53] that's the pursuit it is the more
[9:55] excellent way that a Christian will live
[9:56] We tend to fall back on our known our
[9:59] ways that are known to us of gifts in
[10:02] the church and knowledge in the church
[10:03] and good works we tend to fall back on
[10:05] that but this is a whole other thing
[10:07] altogether and it's also I've been
[10:10] preaching to you that this Divine love
[10:12] is not just a giving to the poor this
[10:15] Divine love is not in human effort it
[10:18] doesn't originate in us as humans it
[10:21] doesn't originate in our minds this
[10:23] don't try to mechanically put this on
[10:25] this morning this Divine love only comes
[10:28] through one source and that's the Holy
[10:30] Ghost himself living in the soul this is
[10:33] not human love this is his Capstone
[10:36] Divine love living in you
[10:40] so we just yield ourselves because he
[10:41] wants to express that and so it's the
[10:44] full expression of his character
[10:46] expressing his bride his wife and that's
[10:49] why you have the term bride showing up
[10:52] at the end of the Bible quite a few
[10:54] times the bride the bride the bride
[10:56] who's the bride because the people that
[10:59] God has taken for his namesake the
[11:01] people is are in the final expression at
[11:04] the end I read the scripture to you the
[11:06] spirit and the bride say come he speaks
[11:08] of a bride in the Book of Revelations
[11:10] because the final culmination to God's
[11:13] work is he Christ will take a bride a
[11:16] many many membered body he will take a
[11:18] bride for himself and she will become
[11:20] into a marriage at the end time she will
[11:22] marry Christ and then it talks about the
[11:25] marriage supper of the Lamb that we go
[11:27] to I'm gonna blow your mind a little bit
[11:29] the marriage of Christ is not to come
[11:32] someday when we go in heaven the
[11:34] marriage is happening now we go to the
[11:37] marriage supper
[11:40] a marriage is the union can you say amen
[11:42] and the marriage the spiritual union
[11:44] between Christ and his bride is not
[11:47] coming someday it happens at the end is
[11:50] he the word Christ presents himself and
[11:52] the bride says yes I will be become your
[11:55] wife I will obey your word I will follow
[11:58] your word I will become your word I will
[12:00] Express what your word says
[12:04] there's a lot of groups of people a lot
[12:06] of churches
[12:07] let me just say it this way
[12:09] and I think I said this when I started
[12:11] the church in Toledo 30 33 34 years ago
[12:15] I kept saying this because I was looking
[12:17] up in the phone book
[12:19] and I I was saying there's like seven or
[12:21] eight pages of churches well on one side
[12:24] you could say praise the Lord you know
[12:26] there's Christian churches that are
[12:28] preaching
[12:29] but then I thought as the Lord began to
[12:32] show me that that God wants something
[12:35] more than just more churches
[12:38] God's not looking for another church to
[12:40] start he's looking for a bride
[12:46] and then I was wondering where the
[12:47] statement holy Toledo came from
[12:51] holy toledo
[12:53] and I found out I researched and I found
[12:56] out that Toledo had more churches per
[12:59] capita than any other city I don't know
[13:01] if it's the same but at that time 30
[13:03] years 30 years ago Toledo had more
[13:05] churches per capita than any other city
[13:07] in the United States and that's where
[13:09] the term came from holy toledo
[13:11] but I've lived here for 33 years and
[13:14] Toledo is not holy
[13:17] it's not holy there's there's a lot of
[13:20] Unholy things that happen every night
[13:23] every day
[13:25] and so you can't so how you have to be
[13:29] honest and say if you have more churches
[13:31] doesn't guarantee you have more holy
[13:33] people
[13:35] if you have more churches that are using
[13:37] the Bible even praise the Lord we thank
[13:39] God for that but we have to have a
[13:40] result that God is calling a people for
[13:43] his namesake he's not calling another
[13:45] church he's not calling people to
[13:48] religion but he's calling a bride to
[13:51] marry in this last days how many want to
[13:53] be a part of that bride
[13:55] we don't need more churches we don't
[13:57] need another church Toledo has a lot of
[13:59] churches but Christ is looking for a
[14:02] bride he's calling a bride in the last
[14:04] days to be married to him the word
[14:07] praise the Lord
[14:09] amen that's scriptural you believe it
[14:11] without a heart so let's start this
[14:13] morning you say well you already started
[14:14] no I'm starting right now that was all
[14:17] just the opening so let's start by
[14:19] reading my text today in the Amplified
[14:21] and go into the subjects this morning on
[14:22] Divine love the next oh I do this right
[14:25] I okay I hit the button all right
[14:28] so this is the scripture we had in our
[14:30] text in the Amplified so let's make sure
[14:32] we get it as we go into this theme of
[14:34] what the theme is today finally all of
[14:37] you be like-minded United in spirit
[14:39] sympathetic brotherly kind-hearted
[14:41] courteous and compassionate towards each
[14:44] other as members of one household say no
[14:48] there's a lot of households here no
[14:49] really you got your household but you're
[14:52] when you become a member of the body of
[14:53] Christ you're a member of One household
[14:55] the body of Christ
[14:57] so now that's why we treat each other
[14:59] because this is brothers and sisters
[15:01] this isn't just some alien that's
[15:03] sitting next to you here this morning
[15:04] maybe you might treat him like an alien
[15:06] I don't need that person I don't need to
[15:08] shake their hand I don't it makes me
[15:10] uncomfortable shaking hands I just want
[15:12] to come if you want to come for a while
[15:14] and you don't want to just talk to
[15:15] anybody then you you should come and sit
[15:17] on the front seat
[15:21] and then you'll be undistracted by
[15:22] people and you just look at me
[15:26] you're welcome to do that now you don't
[15:28] have to sit the front seat you say
[15:29] whatever you want but listen now people
[15:30] kind of get this way but you you if
[15:32] you're born into by a new birth into
[15:35] Christ you're born into a household
[15:37] you're born into a body
[15:40] so just like at home when you got a
[15:41] household with all different brothers
[15:43] and sisters and kids
[15:44] uh young or old and it doesn't matter
[15:48] you're a household so now we see every
[15:51] day what it takes to make a household
[15:53] rung and I'll tell you you're not going
[15:55] to have a good household without without
[15:57] courteous compassionate
[16:00] forgiving kind-hearted brotherly if you
[16:04] if you violate those things what kind of
[16:06] home are you going to have
[16:08] so if it works in a you know it has to
[16:10] ask you have to have certain boundaries
[16:12] of respect you have to have certain
[16:14] things you have to love one another when
[16:17] somebody's unlovable you have to repent
[16:18] you have to talk it out if you want a
[16:21] functioning household well that works
[16:23] the same in the household because he
[16:24] says be sympathetic be brotherly
[16:26] kind-hearted courteous and compassionate
[16:28] towards each other as members of one
[16:30] household and humble in spirit and never
[16:33] return evil for evil or an insult for an
[16:37] insult
[16:38] avoiding scolding avoiding scolding
[16:42] berating and any kind of abuse it's
[16:46] interesting that abuse any kind of abuse
[16:49] but it's interesting abuse is used with
[16:51] something you're saying it's your words
[16:53] it's when you're scolding you're using
[16:56] your tongue your words when you're
[16:58] berating you're using your tongue your
[17:00] words can you say Amen so those when he
[17:02] says the abuse today abuse abuse is not
[17:06] just physical abuse there are many forms
[17:09] of abuse and verbal abuse is one of them
[17:12] so in our words we got to bring our
[17:15] tongue under subjection to those that
[17:17] we're supposed to be honoring
[17:20] and it has to express itself in being
[17:23] courteous and compassionate even when we
[17:25] disagree now some of you might have
[17:27] households where you you you agree on
[17:30] everything
[17:33] and everybody's laughing
[17:36] you know if you do meet me in the office
[17:39] because I'd like to ask some questions
[17:41] what you're doing right
[17:43] all right but listen so we don't agree
[17:46] on everything but when we disagree
[17:49] we we don't we don't go here to being
[17:52] discourteous or disrespectful or
[17:55] scolding or abuse you don't have any
[17:57] right as a Christian to go the direction
[17:59] of abuse verbally just because you
[18:02] disagree and just because somebody's not
[18:04] doing what you want to do want them to
[18:06] do can you say Amen so so berating any
[18:09] kind of abuse I like to talk more on
[18:11] that because we have way too much abuse
[18:13] going on today even sometimes in
[18:15] Christian homes and because because
[18:17] people don't know what abuse is they
[18:19] don't know what they're doing they've
[18:20] developed habits over time habits in
[18:23] their home that they come from and they
[18:24] just do it because they think it's
[18:25] normal and it just passes on from
[18:28] generation to generation what your
[18:30] household was normal this is the way we
[18:31] did it so you just start abusing you
[18:33] start lashing out whatever comes from
[18:35] your past home and but as a Christian
[18:37] you got to stand still and said no wait
[18:39] a minute I'm the one by the grace of God
[18:41] would like to break the cycle of homes
[18:43] being in such a disarray giving it a
[18:45] normal status that it's normal to just
[18:48] scold somebody and walk away and never
[18:50] repent of it I need to know Lord help me
[18:52] because you're presenting to me a what a
[18:55] Christian home is and a Christian Body
[18:57] of Christ this is the way we should
[18:59] function if you want to leave today and
[19:01] ignore just this scripture and say
[19:03] nobody can live like that you go right
[19:05] ahead but for a Believer he's saying
[19:07] Lord I don't have all that yet but it's
[19:10] your word and the word does not come in
[19:13] just word only but power and
[19:14] demonstration and I want to see the Holy
[19:17] Ghost bring a demonstration of this word
[19:20] in my life
[19:24] avoid scolding berating in any kind of
[19:27] abuse but on Con on the contrary give a
[19:31] blessing pray for one another's
[19:33] well-being contentment and protection
[19:36] for you have been called for this very
[19:40] purpose this isn't just an instruction
[19:42] that you intellectually okay I'm gonna
[19:45] go home and do this this is a calling
[19:48] you've been called by God to this
[19:51] you ever hear somebody running from a
[19:53] calling
[19:55] a minister can run from years from a
[19:57] calling and he feels this
[19:58] urgency in the inside something's there
[20:00] I don't know what it is and and but they
[20:02] can run from a calling and usually the
[20:04] one that's running has the calling
[20:07] and you're never going to get away from
[20:08] it if God's called you you can fight for
[20:11] 10 20 years but if it's a calling he's
[20:13] called you to you're going to have to
[20:15] address that someday and unbelievers
[20:17] don't care about this but Believers you
[20:19] have a calling to live this way and to
[20:21] treat people this way and from the
[20:23] pastor down to the Pew from the pastor
[20:26] to the janitor whoever it is this is our
[20:29] calling
[20:33] for you have been called for this very
[20:35] purpose that you might inherit a
[20:36] blessing from God that brings well-being
[20:40] happiness and protection
[20:47] for this is the rest of it for the one
[20:50] who wants to enjoy life and see good
[20:54] days whether a parent or not the one who
[20:57] wants to enjoy life can we show a raise
[21:00] of hands who wants to enjoy life
[21:05] who well the reason wants to see good
[21:07] days
[21:10] can't guarantee every day is going to be
[21:11] good
[21:12] but if we're pursuing something we can
[21:15] have more good days and we can have we
[21:17] can have enjoy life a little better and
[21:20] that's by saying I yield myself in
[21:22] humility that I'm going to say Lord take
[21:24] over my tongue and my character and my
[21:27] attitude and let me treat everybody in
[21:29] this household and in the household of
[21:31] God with respect
[21:34] let's say praise the Lord
[21:37] amen so now laying that down as we take
[21:40] the next two attributes of divine love
[21:43] these two next ones are tied together
[21:46] these two next ones are tied together
[21:48] and so the first one here is love is not
[21:52] rude you'll have to go back and listen
[21:54] to the other attributes we've been
[21:55] through I think five of them we'll take
[21:57] two more today so love one of them today
[22:01] is love is not rude and the second one
[22:03] is love is not self-seeking this is in
[22:06] First Corinthians love is never rude
[22:08] Love Is Never self-seeking
[22:11] because it's not about you
[22:14] right lane
[22:16] it's not about you it's about Christ
[22:20] yeah
[22:21] I'm quoting Lane this morning
[22:23] who gave that admonition to his mom one
[22:26] Wednesday night
[22:28] as she was struggling to get to church
[22:31] and almost gave up to come to church
[22:33] because of the traffic and because
[22:34] everything going on and trying to get
[22:36] him to church and trying to and just
[22:38] pulling her hair out but it wasn't too
[22:40] bad she still has her hair this morning
[22:43] and Lane says when she drives in
[22:45] frustrated into the parking lot Lane
[22:48] says but Mom
[22:50] it's not about you
[22:56] and out of the mouth of babes
[23:00] he speaks the truth
[23:03] thank you Lane
[23:07] so
[23:09] love is not rude and love is not
[23:11] self-seeking both of these are complete
[23:13] opposite both of these tied together
[23:16] because they're the complete opposite of
[23:18] a self-centered person
[23:20] God's love is never selfish and never
[23:23] self-centered
[23:26] can I say it again
[23:28] you'll never find in the true genuine
[23:30] love of God
[23:32] self-centeredness or selfishness you
[23:35] can't find it in the love of God
[23:38] so if you still have some of that then
[23:40] it's not coming from the the Divine love
[23:43] that's in the Holy Ghost not coming from
[23:45] that it's coming from something else
[23:48] and it's hard to move into a life of
[23:50] divine love when you have
[23:51] self-centeredness or selfishness so now
[23:54] we're going to go into the first one
[23:55] which is love is not rude so First
[23:58] Corinthians 13 5 says does not behave
[24:00] itself unseemly that's the way it's
[24:02] worded in First Corinthians but it means
[24:03] love is not misbehaving love is not
[24:07] behaving it's about behavior when you're
[24:09] acting rude to somebody you're you're
[24:11] treating that person bad you're more
[24:13] about yourself than their feelings and
[24:15] and it's about Behavior does not behave
[24:18] itself unseemly which means it doesn't
[24:20] love does not behave itself
[24:23] dishonorably or improperly
[24:27] Divine love of God is not rude to
[24:30] someone else Divine love of God is not
[24:32] rude to someone else it is not
[24:34] dishonorable it doesn't dishonor it's
[24:37] not behaving improperly and I'll add
[24:40] Titus 3 2 in the ESV to speak evil of no
[24:44] one to avoid quarreling to be gentle and
[24:49] to show perfect courtesy toward all
[24:53] people
[24:54] love is not rude
[24:58] Divine love is never rude or
[25:01] self-seeking
[25:04] Divine love is not rude
[25:07] and so now love does love does not
[25:10] needlessly offend love has good manners
[25:15] love is courteous it is polite it is
[25:19] sensitive to the feelings of others and
[25:21] always uses tact
[25:27] the reason we are not courteous of
[25:29] course is that we are thinking only of
[25:31] ourselves and not of others not honoring
[25:33] the other person and so now this is
[25:36] bringing us into saying Lord help us
[25:37] this morning because every person has a
[25:40] right of my honor as we preached a few
[25:42] months ago every person I owe the love
[25:44] of God to every person I owe it I'm in
[25:47] debt to every person that's what the
[25:48] Bible says you oh suddenly say well they
[25:51] I they don't owe me nothing and I don't
[25:53] owe them nothing you can't say that as a
[25:54] Christian
[25:56] you stay over there I stay over here I
[25:59] don't owe you anything it's not true if
[26:01] you have the love of God you owe them
[26:03] you're in death you owe everybody the
[26:04] love of God
[26:06] you're in debt to them because God gave
[26:08] it to you and it's not just for yourself
[26:10] can you imagine now I've got the love of
[26:12] God for myself but it becomes selfish
[26:14] with the love of God
[26:15] there's no selfishness in the love of
[26:18] God
[26:19] there is no holding back in the love of
[26:21] God so then this description of Love In
[26:24] First Corinthians 13 includes a list of
[26:27] what love is not and love is not rude we
[26:30] read that love is not rude in verse 5
[26:32] love then has good manners the Greek
[26:36] phrase could literally be translated
[26:38] does not act unbecomingly that's why it
[26:41] says does not behave itself unseemingly
[26:43] because in the Greek it says love does
[26:46] not act unbecomingly or does not act
[26:48] inappropriately notice it's not what
[26:50] you're thinking it's how you're acting
[26:52] this isn't about what you're thinking
[26:54] because you could say do you love them
[26:56] and you say you might say yeah I love
[26:58] them it's not how you think
[27:00] it's not your words
[27:03] but it's your behavior and your words
[27:05] that are expressed to say whether you
[27:06] love them or not love has honor love has
[27:09] respect love has a tolerance not for
[27:13] something off the word but it has a
[27:15] tolerance for that person's growth may
[27:17] God help us may God help me to have a
[27:19] tolerance for a person's growth in the
[27:21] Lord and where they're at our attitude
[27:23] has to show something in our behavior
[27:25] that love cannot ever be rude to someone
[27:29] no matter what state they're in and no
[27:31] matter how rude they're treating you
[27:37] the Greek phrases does not act
[27:39] Unbecoming it doesn't act
[27:40] inappropriately Christian love does not
[27:42] seek to cause problems or it does not
[27:44] belittle others Christian love involves
[27:47] choosing appropriate actions and
[27:49] responses that help other people
[27:52] rudeness is finding more and more
[27:54] Acceptance in today's culture I'm
[27:56] reading from a writer now a few things
[27:58] on rudeness and I agree with this
[28:00] completely rudeness is finding more and
[28:02] more Acceptance in today's culture
[28:04] things have changed in the last 10 20
[28:06] years in rudeness people are becoming
[28:09] more rude
[28:11] stay at a light too long texting and you
[28:15] find out how rude we get
[28:19] rudeness is more and more accepted today
[28:22] and become normal but it's not normal in
[28:25] God's Kingdom
[28:26] what's normal in the world and I'll tell
[28:29] you you should take this for every
[28:31] subject what's become normal and in the
[28:34] world what's become normal in American
[28:36] lifestyle don't you dare accept that as
[28:39] normal as a Christian lifestyle
[28:41] you know what I find that there's a lot
[28:43] of Christians today they're Christians
[28:46] but they don't live a Christian
[28:47] lifestyle they live an American
[28:49] lifestyle
[28:51] and I could take some time right now and
[28:53] describe the American lifestyle and
[28:55] basically in lifestyle they live just
[28:57] the same as the world
[28:59] but they're Christian but I believe that
[29:02] a Christian does not take on an American
[29:04] lifestyle or a European lifestyle or an
[29:07] American Spirit we have a different
[29:09] Spirit we're from another kingdom
[29:11] altogether can you say amen and though
[29:13] we may be humans like other Americans if
[29:16] we have the love of Christ and the Holy
[29:18] Ghost within us it'll bring a different
[29:20] lifestyle in our lives
[29:22] they used to have a show Lifestyles of
[29:24] the Rich and Famous I wanted to preach a
[29:26] sermon sometimes lifestyles of the poor
[29:28] and unknown
[29:33] all right I'll preached that one this
[29:35] morning the other one everybody's quiet
[29:37] so maybe I'll preach this one lifestyles
[29:39] of the spiritually poor and unknown
[29:42] that's what most Christians today are
[29:45] spiritually poor can you say Amen
[29:48] they're they're unknown or sometimes
[29:50] they're spiritually poor and popular
[29:55] some of our singers that are the most
[29:57] popular singers in Christianity they are
[30:00] popular and they are they're they're
[30:02] maybe rich and they're they're known but
[30:06] you look at their lives and they're
[30:08] spiritually drained and poor
[30:11] not all of them
[30:12] but a lot of them and a lot of
[30:13] Christians today are spiritually poor
[30:16] it's a lifestyle can you say man it's
[30:19] the lifestyle
[30:20] so
[30:22] rudeness is finding more and more
[30:23] Acceptance in today's culture public
[30:25] behavior and words that were Unthinkable
[30:27] a generation ago are now being
[30:29] commonplace now commonplace we live in
[30:32] what the uh SAS marrow Marco in the Wall
[30:35] Street Journal calls a Renaissance of
[30:37] rudeness
[30:38] I read the article it's the Renaissance
[30:40] of rudeness we're in the age of rudeness
[30:42] and it's increasing
[30:44] one writer says that our politicians in
[30:47] the last four or five years have taught
[30:49] us that it's okay to be more rude
[30:53] and because they do it then we can do it
[30:55] because we're all we're all followers
[30:57] can you say man we're sheep God made a
[31:00] sheep so we're not we're followers so
[31:02] the image is what they do what they say
[31:04] if it becomes normal for the Hollywood
[31:06] stars and for the politicians we develop
[31:08] it must be normal for us so rudeness
[31:09] it's the Renaissance of rudeness because
[31:11] these people start doing it it becomes
[31:13] normal to walk up in an award show and
[31:16] just basically haul off and slap
[31:18] somebody in the face
[31:22] and get a free pass for it
[31:24] right you don't think that Millions eyes
[31:26] are watching and so the next day if they
[31:29] get angry it becomes normal you just
[31:31] walk up and slap that wife in the face
[31:34] or slap that child in the face
[31:36] we're taught by Hollywood and our
[31:40] leaders in this culture it is the
[31:43] Renaissance of rudeness
[31:49] we're being taught through what we feed
[31:51] on that it is normal to be rude when we
[31:53] feel like it when you're having a bad
[31:55] day that it's okay to be rude
[32:01] thank you
[32:03] when a woman is having a difficult time
[32:07] at a certain time
[32:09] in a month
[32:10] then it becomes okay to be rude I'm here
[32:14] to say for a woman or a man it's never
[32:16] okay to be rude
[32:21] we justify rudeness we justify how we
[32:24] treat one of the people thankfully
[32:26] there's some families that when you're
[32:28] rude which I have been all of you have
[32:31] been thankfully we have some families
[32:32] either you're not going to correct that
[32:33] unless there's a complete disclosure and
[32:35] an apology and say I was wrong I was
[32:38] rude to you I belittled you and that's
[32:40] how we get through this stuff can you
[32:42] say Amen our goal is to lead less and
[32:44] less rude until we have Divine love only
[32:47] Divine love coming from our vessel does
[32:49] anybody hear what I'm saying this
[32:50] morning are our our desire because you
[32:54] see our I loved it when brother rap
[32:56] spoke Wednesday night is such a powerful
[32:58] message on the Holy Ghost and what it is
[33:00] please go and listen if you haven't
[33:01] heard it I haven't heard it in a long
[33:03] time the Holy Ghost broke down like that
[33:05] but one thing's for sure he was talking
[33:07] about taking the pulse of something and
[33:09] we take the Pulse based upon whether we
[33:11] have the evidence of Holy Ghost not it's
[33:13] not about signs and miracles and wonders
[33:15] or speaking in tongues can you say man
[33:17] the evidence says do you do you do you
[33:19] believe but the greatest one is taking a
[33:22] pulse of your desires
[33:24] the pulse of what whether you have
[33:27] something real or not is your desire
[33:32] because you can make a lot of mistakes
[33:33] but what is it you desire and your
[33:35] desire will make you repent and make it
[33:37] right and say God don't let this fruit
[33:40] come from my life let it stop with me
[33:42] Lord
[33:43] I desire not just to go repent to my son
[33:46] or my daughter or my wife or my pastor I
[33:49] desire not just to repent but I'm saying
[33:50] Lord not only bring fruits or repentance
[33:53] changed me that I stopped doing that can
[33:56] I get it amen this morning change me
[33:58] Lord that I stop being rude that I
[34:01] stopped this just making people feel so
[34:04] mistreated
[34:07] take the Pulse of the evidence and the
[34:10] pulse is our desire because God's
[34:13] looking at our desires if you don't have
[34:15] the Holy Ghost you don't have the true
[34:17] desire for the things of God
[34:20] you'll never have the desire for the
[34:21] things of God and more of his word
[34:22] unless you have the truly and that's the
[34:24] evidence that you have it it's not
[34:26] speaking in tongues it's not
[34:27] intelligence it's not how much you know
[34:28] of the Bible it's the Life of Christ
[34:30] Living you that is the Holy Ghost
[34:33] and it's he changes your desires and
[34:36] hunger for the word of God
[34:38] and when God's diagnosing you other
[34:41] people diagnose you do they have the
[34:42] Holy Ghost or not God diagnoses by has
[34:45] your desire been changed and he's
[34:47] working off of your desire
[34:50] what do you desire this morning
[34:52] your life may be shadowed with all kinds
[34:54] of sin and all kinds of past and you
[34:57] don't feel worthy to even be in this
[34:58] building
[34:59] but what is your desire
[35:02] because if he can fill you with his
[35:04] desire
[35:05] things are going to be different in the
[35:07] years to come how many want them to be
[35:09] different in the years to come things
[35:11] are going to be different for your life
[35:12] Mercy is going to rewrite your book
[35:14] Mercy is going to rewrite your biography
[35:16] Mercy rewrote my life can you say Amen
[35:19] grace and mercy will rewrite it and the
[35:21] passes in the sea of forgiveness and now
[35:24] I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God
[35:25] I'm still a human being but I got a
[35:28] desire to serve the Lord I'm going to
[35:29] work off of that desire I'm going to
[35:31] read the word I'm going to stay close to
[35:33] him I'm going to direct my children the
[35:35] right way and I'm going to repent when I
[35:37] need to repent and I'm going to give it
[35:39] all to God and my future will be better
[35:41] than my past
[35:43] somebody say praise the Lord
[35:45] it works off your desire what's your
[35:47] desire this morning I got all this all
[35:49] over me I got my my spirit is full of
[35:52] all kinds of trash from the world
[35:54] what's your desire
[35:56] take that desire
[35:58] no matter how small it is and say God I
[36:00] desire for things to be different
[36:05] but getting back to rudeness we're in a
[36:07] generation of that
[36:09] we are taught to be that way that it's
[36:11] normal if you're having a bad day
[36:13] I've been looking some of the conditions
[36:15] that the prophet described way back in
[36:18] the 1950s as a nervous and neurotic age
[36:22] in the 1950s a nervous and neurotic age
[36:25] if it was in the 1950s people are scared
[36:27] people are nervous and I will say people
[36:30] are under guilt some of his guilt some
[36:33] of it they're nervous and nervousness
[36:36] and pressure will make someone act rude
[36:43] they didn't mean to do it but pressure
[36:46] will make them blow their stack
[36:49] and treat everybody with rudeness
[36:57] we're nervous and neurotic we're
[37:00] we're more nervous than we ever have do
[37:03] you know that some of it is the
[37:04] judgments of God are looming over this
[37:06] world
[37:07] you don't think human beings know we're
[37:09] almost there
[37:12] it's not if it's when
[37:15] there's not many preachers that preach
[37:17] the judgments of God are coming
[37:19] but the Bible says the judgments of God
[37:20] we're almost here we're in
[37:22] pre-tribulation right now there's more
[37:24] diseases that hit the earth there's more
[37:26] afflictions that's at the Earth there
[37:28] someday we'll get more things that
[37:30] cancer will look like a toothache
[37:35] there's more homosexual diseases coming
[37:37] attributed right to homosexuality monkey
[37:39] pox
[37:40] how appropriate that name
[37:46] because when man begins to without the
[37:49] Holy Ghost without the holy ghost man
[37:51] becomes Beast
[37:54] and Romans 1 says it man becomes like a
[37:57] beast and Men turn to one another that's
[38:00] what the Bible says and then you have a
[38:03] disease coming from it I'm not
[38:04] condemning you brother I'm trying to
[38:07] trying to bring conviction in your life
[38:08] if you're looking at me there in the
[38:10] screen or here today and you've got that
[38:12] Spirit on you that's never normal that's
[38:14] never right that's not what God intended
[38:17] for you to be you learned that and you
[38:19] took the wrong Spirit God has better
[38:21] things for you you can be delivered of
[38:23] that
[38:24] that is an Abomination to God but God
[38:27] can God can deliver somebody and you
[38:30] won't be Abomination but you'll be a son
[38:31] of God
[38:33] filled with the Holy Ghost the very
[38:36] image of God can you say Amen but how
[38:38] appropriate monkey pox because man
[38:40] without the Holy Ghost turns back to
[38:42] monkey and Beast again
[38:44] not a monkey because they can't find the
[38:46] missing link between us and monkeys
[38:51] we know what it is
[38:53] that there was a beast in the garden in
[38:55] between humans and monkeys
[38:58] so close to us the serpent
[39:02] and he was dissolved after the fall
[39:05] he spoke he stood upright he spoke to
[39:08] Eve so he's very close to human because
[39:10] he could speak to Eve but God after that
[39:12] dissolved his form and put him in the
[39:16] form of a serpent
[39:18] as we know what a serpent is
[39:22] did I just blow your mind
[39:25] it's what the Bible says he said well
[39:27] I've never heard that before well it's
[39:29] what the Bible says we know the missing
[39:32] link and it's not we're tied to monkeys
[39:35] we're tied in our human first birth to
[39:37] the serpent that beguiled Eve
[39:41] and misinterpreted the word to her
[39:44] and we fell because of a misinterpreter
[39:47] misinterpretation of the word
[39:52] that's not in my subject about rudeness
[39:55] but it might be some of the reason
[39:57] people are just rude
[40:00] that comes from the serpent nature the
[40:01] serpent nature was in
[40:03] Cain and he murdered his brother
[40:07] you'll never find that originating in
[40:09] God
[40:11] so I'd say if he murdered his brother
[40:13] I'd say
[40:15] he had some rudeness
[40:18] doesn't come from the love of God it
[40:20] comes from the the dark side
[40:25] can you say Amen
[40:27] can you say you love me
[40:29] thank you thank you I'll take all I can
[40:31] get here this morning
[40:33] feeling emotionally unstable so I need
[40:35] your support
[40:42] people are under lots of pressure
[40:44] they're nervous
[40:45] the Judgment Day of God is looming and
[40:48] the people know it and they're scared
[40:50] but none of that all that nervousness
[40:53] never none of that ever gives Christians
[40:55] a right to be rude
[40:58] can you say Amen
[41:00] look at us we don't want to look at each
[41:02] other hardly we're looking at our phones
[41:04] all the time even at home when we're
[41:05] sitting across on the couch to one
[41:07] another look at this look what we're
[41:08] doing
[41:10] could I say that that's a level of
[41:12] rudeness when someone's trying to have a
[41:14] heart-to-heart conversation and we're in
[41:17] our phones
[41:18] you say well I can multitask
[41:21] not a heart-to-heart conversation
[41:24] somebody's lied to you somebody's made
[41:25] it normal to you
[41:27] I said don't bring your phones in the
[41:29] church because people were you know
[41:31] doing business and looking at things on
[41:32] their phones in the church if it's your
[41:34] Bible I guess that's fine but we'd
[41:35] rather you not have it because can't you
[41:37] give can't you give an hour hour and a
[41:39] half of your life away from that phone
[41:42] but it's a part of the rudeness in this
[41:44] generation can you say Amen it's a part
[41:46] of the rudeness there's a rudeness that
[41:49] is that is here today and people are but
[41:53] there's so many levels of this rudeness
[41:55] rudeness turns into violence it's not
[41:57] just happen on your phone being on your
[41:59] phone but it rudeness turns into
[42:01] violence can you say Amen that someone
[42:03] to take children's lives in a school or
[42:06] wherever it's at uh and and
[42:08] you know have no sensitivity they don't
[42:12] know who they are they just snap and
[42:15] they so destruct disrespect human lives
[42:18] there's no value for human life not only
[42:21] cussing them out but murdering them
[42:26] Time Magazine wrote an article back a
[42:28] year ago why everyone is so rude right
[42:31] now
[42:32] and they said September was bad A bad
[42:35] month for manners it says
[42:37] on the 21st a woman pulled a gun on
[42:40] servers at a Philadelphia fast food
[42:41] restaurant when they asked her to order
[42:43] online she pulled a gun on him on the
[42:46] 16th several women from Texas pummeled a
[42:49] host is that a New York City family
[42:50] style restaurant a few days prior to
[42:52] that a Connecticut mother was
[42:53] investigated for slapping an elementary
[42:55] school bus driver and that same week a
[42:58] Californian woman was charged with
[43:00] felony assault for attacking a Southwest
[43:02] Airlines flight attendant and dislodging
[43:04] some of her teeth
[43:08] we're going through a time where
[43:10] physiologically or psychology of
[43:12] people's people's threat system is at a
[43:15] heightened level right now says Bernard
[43:17] golden a psychologist and the author of
[43:19] The overcome destructive overcoming
[43:21] destructive anger this period of threat
[43:24] has been so long that it may have had a
[43:26] damaging effect on people's mental
[43:28] health which was for many has been uh
[43:31] further uh debilitated by isolation loss
[43:35] of resource the death of loved ones and
[43:36] reduce social support during covid there
[43:39] has been an increase in anxiety a
[43:41] reported increase in depression and
[43:43] increased demand for mental health
[43:45] services he adds lots of people in other
[43:47] words are on their very last nerve
[43:51] this is true he adds whether they
[43:53] believe the virus is an uh was a a
[43:57] threat or whether they don't believe it
[44:00] was a threat half the people fear covet
[44:03] said golden half the people fear being
[44:05] controlled
[44:08] so I can label it I think like brother
[44:10] Chad labeled it in Lima this was a
[44:13] pandemic of fear
[44:18] that's accurate it was a real pandemic
[44:21] and we did what we could to protect
[44:23] ourselves but you're not looking at the
[44:25] bigger picture if you think it was just
[44:26] covered was the problem because there's
[44:28] people if they didn't fear code it was
[44:30] just some of us who didn't they did for
[44:32] coven some people feared the government
[44:33] take over the government control what
[44:35] they use for covet to control things
[44:37] more and if if you don't think that was
[44:39] part of it you're blind
[44:41] the government's going to start using
[44:42] everything and here I am in uh
[44:46] saying this
[44:48] this internationally
[44:53] if you think it was just covet or if you
[44:56] think it was just that and not the
[44:59] government moving into the spirit that
[45:00] the Book of Revelation saves the moon to
[45:02] for controlling one day they say you're
[45:04] not be able to buy or sell unless you
[45:07] receive the mark of the beast we're
[45:09] headed to a government control can you
[45:11] say man
[45:12] that's exactly scriptural whether we
[45:14] want it or not can you say Amen but half
[45:16] the people were fearing covet half the
[45:18] people be if you're being controlled and
[45:20] so it was a code a pandemic of fear and
[45:23] now they're saying we're still under the
[45:25] results of going through covet because
[45:27] of this this rudeness that has increased
[45:30] this violence that has increased
[45:34] it wasn't like Americans were exactly
[45:36] overlooking their differences before the
[45:38] pandemic some researchers point to the
[45:40] increase in the increase in crude public
[45:42] discourse both from political leaders in
[45:44] online discussion
[45:46] which encourages outsized emotions oh my
[45:50] goodness
[45:52] I've been preaching that for quite a few
[45:54] years that online social thing and all
[45:57] this thing that people are feeding on
[45:59] can encourage
[46:01] outsized emotions as the Gateway
[46:04] rudeness that has led to the current
[46:06] wave we don't filter ourselves as much
[46:09] as we used to we don't check ourselves
[46:11] as much as we we don't watch what we say
[46:13] as much we used to on the internet
[46:15] people feel like they can say anything
[46:19] they no longer guard themselves and I
[46:22] think they transfer that lack of filter
[46:24] into public life
[46:26] so they learn there's no filter I can do
[46:28] and say whatever whatever I want and
[46:30] then they don't bring any filter to
[46:31] their interaction at the job or at
[46:34] church and they give themselves
[46:35] permission
[46:37] to be rude
[46:41] at the very beginning of the pandemic
[46:43] people just didn't know how to be polite
[46:44] it was hard to communicate a smile and
[46:47] it became necessary to avoid rather than
[46:48] Embrace people but after a certain point
[46:52] the unintentional rudeness became
[46:54] intentional
[46:56] and deliberate
[46:58] it's meant to call attention to what
[47:00] they see as this kind of unjust policy
[47:02] some demons some discrimination or some
[47:05] infringement on some other right says
[47:07] Zach in the minds of some individuals
[47:10] snapping at the flight attendant is not
[47:13] rude anymore it's a civil disobedience
[47:17] but rudeness is never civil
[47:21] and it's never a civil disobedience
[47:25] the Renaissance of rudeness perhaps you
[47:27] read about Lakeisha beard the 39 year
[47:30] old woman who was charged with
[47:31] disorderly conduct for talking loudly on
[47:33] her cell phone in the designated quiet
[47:35] car of an Amtrak train as she traveled
[47:37] last weekend from Oakland California to
[47:40] Portland Oregon according to the old
[47:41] Oregon State Troopers who finally
[47:43] escorted her off in cuffs she had talked
[47:48] non-stop on her phone for 16 hours
[47:52] despite repeated complaints and warning
[47:55] from all the people
[47:58] rude
[48:01] she's being told she's rude
[48:03] she don't care
[48:08] the fact is that rudeness is rooted in
[48:10] selfishness can you say Amen
[48:12] ERS are meant to reduce the friction of
[48:15] human interaction that's an interesting
[48:16] statement matters are meant to refuse
[48:19] reduce the friction of human interaction
[48:23] correct manners Christian manners
[48:26] conduct words we say are to reduce the
[48:31] friction in human interaction because
[48:33] humans have friction
[48:36] with one another
[48:39] you got different personalities you got
[48:42] your irritations you got your past and
[48:45] then you got the other dimension that's
[48:47] full of devils that's trying to get you
[48:49] to argue trying to get you to fuss
[48:51] because Satan hates Oneness
[48:54] when Jesus did miracles
[48:57] none of the disciples took up Stones
[48:59] against him
[49:00] but when he said the words I and my
[49:03] father are one then they took up stones
[49:08] the devil hates Oneness
[49:13] and if you're becoming really truly one
[49:15] with Christ truly and this word get
[49:19] ready for the devil to fight
[49:23] get ready for your home to have
[49:25] sometimes more friction
[49:28] because the devil's screaming and the
[49:29] demons are screaming no no we've got to
[49:31] stop this we've got to stop this Oneness
[49:38] friction comes but God puts this
[49:41] courtesy
[49:43] in order to reduce the friction of human
[49:46] interaction discourtesy reveals a lack
[49:49] of consideration for others the
[49:50] ill-mannered person is communicating
[49:52] that it's all about me the song doesn't
[49:56] go and it's all I'm coming back to the
[49:59] Heart of Worship and it's all about me
[50:04] it's all about me Jesus
[50:11] and Jesus is
[50:14] okay
[50:18] don't think I'm weird Revelations 3 says
[50:20] because of their lukewarm lifestyle in
[50:22] the last days I will spew them out of my
[50:25] mouth
[50:28] that's right yeah he hates a lukewarm
[50:31] like he'd rather be cold in the world or
[50:33] on fire for God but when you're lukewarm
[50:35] God says I feel like spilling you out of
[50:37] my mouth
[50:39] you'd like you to be one or the other
[50:41] decide what you're going to be
[50:43] I'll love you the same but decide you
[50:45] need to decide you're going to be a
[50:47] miserable person until you decide I
[50:49] either want to be an on fire filled with
[50:51] the spirit Christian every day or I'm
[50:53] going to just
[50:55] be on fire filled up worldly person
[50:59] don't be lukewarm and so it's all about
[51:02] me
[51:04] I'm a songwriter so I can do this it's
[51:06] all about me Jesus no we're coming back
[51:10] to the Heart of Worship and somebody
[51:12] wrote that probably that got the
[51:14] Revelation it's not about the songwriter
[51:16] it's not even about the artist it's not
[51:19] the worship isn't about worshiping the
[51:22] artist who's singing it I'm coming back
[51:24] to I believe it was inspired to say this
[51:27] I'm coming back why is the songwriter
[51:30] saying that who's in the Christian
[51:31] Realms because we've had about 50 60
[51:33] years there that it become Christian
[51:35] music became about Hollywood became
[51:37] about the artists become those people
[51:39] aren't worshiping God they're they're
[51:41] worshiping the person just like
[51:44] Hollywood worship Their Stars
[51:47] and somebody caught a revelation Lord
[51:49] forgive me this isn't about me this is
[51:52] about you may I direct the worship
[51:54] towards you
[51:58] it's not about you it's about him right
[52:01] lane oh right lane it's not about you
[52:04] it's about Jesus
[52:07] do you go to the bathroom
[52:10] you feel better now
[52:11] all right
[52:13] it's good to have you back
[52:15] sorry I just embarrassed you
[52:18] my dad used to do that my brother Ike
[52:21] all the time I don't know where he is
[52:23] right now but he used to do it all the
[52:25] time
[52:26] around the country we traveled all those
[52:28] years around the country like five or
[52:30] six years old sitting on the front row
[52:32] because Dad I think made him sit on the
[52:33] front row so he could keep his eyes on
[52:35] him and Ike would get up and start
[52:38] walking halfway back while Dad was
[52:39] preaching he'd say Ike where are you
[52:41] going
[52:45] well that's rough
[52:47] to the bathroom and sometimes dad would
[52:49] say okay go ahead sometimes you say no
[52:51] you don't need to come back sit down oh
[52:53] Lord
[52:55] talk about doing damage
[53:00] I don't know where he went he was here a
[53:01] minute ago
[53:02] I'm going to do it to him sometime again
[53:07] I shed a car to wherever he went out
[53:09] here I should have caught him today Mike
[53:10] where are you going
[53:14] to trigger all that past
[53:17] I seem to be doing it a lot lately with
[53:19] people it's trigging things like that so
[53:22] hey we got to move on to the next one I
[53:24] think that's enough about rudeness
[53:35] I don't know where he's at
[53:38] his where's he at
[53:41] is in the back room okay so he's
[53:43] watching all this on the screen back
[53:45] there
[53:46] all I know is his 50th birthday is
[53:48] coming up the end of the month and I'm
[53:50] going to have to now buy something very
[53:52] very nice for his birthday
[53:55] love is not rude and love is not
[53:57] self-seeking seeketh not her own
[54:02] Philippians 2 3 that's how it's word in
[54:04] the Bible seeketh not her own love is
[54:07] not self-seeking Philippians 2 3 in the
[54:09] end of I do nothing do nothing
[54:12] from selfishness or empty conceit
[54:14] through factional motives or strife
[54:19] that's why
[54:23] brother Branham taught us to check our
[54:25] motives all the time
[54:27] because with our motives we can be doing
[54:29] wrong things but did you know that you
[54:30] can be doing the right things with the
[54:32] wrong motive
[54:34] so we don't check what we did as much we
[54:37] check our motives for why we did it
[54:39] because that's the Hidden World right do
[54:41] nothing for selfishness or empty conceit
[54:42] through factional motives or Strife but
[54:44] with an attitude of humility being
[54:47] neither arrogant nor self-righteous
[54:50] regard others as more important than
[54:54] yourselves can you say Amen
[54:57] it is not it is not selfish does not
[55:01] demand its rights one writer says the
[55:04] secret of every Discord in Christian
[55:06] homes communities and churches is that
[55:08] we seek our own way excuse me the secret
[55:11] to every Discord in Christian homes
[55:13] communities and churches is that we seek
[55:15] our own way and our own Glory rch
[55:19] Lesinski put it this way if you cure
[55:21] selfishness you plant a garden of Eden
[55:27] another writer says selfishness is the
[55:29] root problem of the human race it is the
[55:32] antithesis of love which is
[55:35] self-sacrifice and you got a temper
[55:38] you got something about you makes you
[55:40] talk when you ought not to talk
[55:44] you got a temper you got something about
[55:46] you makes you talk when you ought not to
[55:48] talk so I guess evidently there's times
[55:50] that we ought not to talk
[55:54] if you're angry Under Pressure that's
[55:56] not the time probably to talk
[55:59] but you better come back and talk later
[56:05] oh God lay it there now lay it there
[56:07] watch the fire of the altar come down
[56:09] and take it away watch the love of God
[56:12] Lick It Up watch all that old
[56:15] selfishness the way you've been talking
[56:17] to your wife the way you've been talking
[56:18] to your husband the way you've been
[56:20] talking to your neighbor the way that
[56:22] you've talked about the people in the
[56:24] church and pretty much covers it lay it
[56:27] on the altar this morning
[56:29] and the fire of God will come down and
[56:32] take it right away and divine love will
[56:35] burn in its place and we can raise your
[56:37] hand say I'm in agreement with the word
[56:39] of God
[56:40] let Divine love burn out the rudeness
[56:43] and selfishness and let Divine love take
[56:45] over and let Divine burn it in its place
[56:48] praise the Lord
[56:50] what we need tonight is not an arguing
[56:52] on the a little Creed but what we need
[56:55] tonight is the Holy Ghost and Fire
[56:57] old-fashioned powers of God to burn sin
[57:00] and selfishness disrespect for each
[57:02] other burn it out of us with the love of
[57:05] God that's right now remember it's only
[57:08] the sick that demands attention service
[57:10] just the stick they demand attention and
[57:13] when you see a preacher and may I not
[57:15] only limit it to a preacher but may I
[57:16] limit it to every church member that
[57:18] wants attention I'm somebody
[57:22] just remember there is a spiritual sick
[57:24] person they are needing attention
[57:27] Pride that we talked about last week
[57:29] pride and arrogance and someone who is
[57:34] about themselves I'm somebody and
[57:37] belittles everybody else whether it's a
[57:39] father to his children a husband to his
[57:41] wife a pastor to his congregation I'm
[57:44] somebody that's for you who did not know
[57:47] and have not researched the nicolaitan
[57:50] spirit in the Book of Revelations in the
[57:53] early church within just a few years he
[57:55] he rebuked the nicolaitan spirit Nico
[57:58] and the Greek is conquer Nicholas
[58:00] conquer Leighton there's a laity they
[58:03] begin to conquer the laity and through
[58:06] over time it put all the Holiness behind
[58:09] the pulpit and took the Holiness and
[58:11] holy ghost out of the people so all
[58:13] people need to come to do is go to their
[58:15] priest
[58:16] come on the Holiness is all behind the
[58:18] pulpit
[58:19] you see that's the nicolaitan spirit
[58:23] we believe the original church was that
[58:25] God did not just fill Peter and the
[58:27] leaders but he filled every believer in
[58:30] that upper room with the Holy Ghost
[58:32] the laity get the same Holy Ghost as the
[58:34] preacher does
[58:36] praise the Lord
[58:38] amen
[58:40] uh a limit every Churchman that wants
[58:42] attention I'm so it's not just that they
[58:44] have arrogance Pride but sometimes they
[58:46] need attention that's why they brought
[58:48] all the attention to themselves and say
[58:50] I'm somebody but they're needing they're
[58:52] needing attention their Spirit that's a
[58:54] spiritually sick person that's
[58:56] self-centered
[58:58] they need the attention of the spirit of
[59:00] God to give them something that will
[59:02] take that attitude out of them and heal
[59:05] them for from their selfishness
[59:10] should we have a prayer line
[59:12] to see selfishness healed
[59:16] because the prophet said
[59:18] they need something to heal them from
[59:20] their selfishness not just their
[59:22] toothaches not just cancer
[59:24] not just their broken hip
[59:27] but they need healing for their
[59:30] selfishness
[59:33] I'll let you ponder that one a little
[59:35] bit this week
[59:36] heal them from their selfishness and
[59:38] their big ideas and the big me and
[59:41] little you
[59:42] the Holy Ghost makes us all the same
[59:47] praise the Lord
[59:51] ah
[59:52] okay
[59:54] I I don't know okay I've got just a
[59:56] little bit more time would you turn with
[59:59] me real quickly
[1:00:00] um
[1:00:02] I want to reference a scripture here
[1:00:04] back in first Samuel chapter 25. can you
[1:00:10] give me about 10 minutes
[1:00:13] this is not a 20-minute sermon this
[1:00:15] morning
[1:00:17] are you learning anything
[1:00:20] amen you sit at Jesus feet and we learn
[1:00:23] from his word he's the word
[1:00:24] first Samuel 25
[1:00:27] . I want you to look at something that
[1:00:28] is here
[1:00:31] uh
[1:00:33] David
[1:00:34] is not coming to his throne yet and now
[1:00:38] he's kind of with his men and going in
[1:00:40] conquering different places and he's
[1:00:42] Gathering his army and he comes to this
[1:00:45] certain area
[1:00:46] and they see a rich man there called
[1:00:49] nabel and he has a lot of food and he
[1:00:52] has a lot of things we can get food so
[1:00:53] they're hungry so he's going to request
[1:00:54] David's going to request
[1:00:56] some get to get some food from some of
[1:00:58] their men respectfully okay so they're
[1:01:00] coming through the area and verse 2 says
[1:01:02] about uh nabel and there was a man in
[1:01:05] Mahon whose possessions were in camel
[1:01:07] and the man was very great had three
[1:01:08] thousand sheep thousand goats and he was
[1:01:11] shearing his sheep in Carmel
[1:01:14] and now the name of the man was nabel
[1:01:16] and the name of his wife was Abigail and
[1:01:18] she was a woman of good understanding of
[1:01:20] a beautiful countenance but the man was
[1:01:22] churlish and evil in his doings and that
[1:01:25] sureless nabel was labeled as being a
[1:01:27] husband who was rude trellis means rude
[1:01:30] and mean-spirited
[1:01:33] nabel was rude and mean-spirited and but
[1:01:36] the man was churlish and evil in his
[1:01:39] doings and he was of the House of Caleb
[1:01:41] and David heard in the wilderness that
[1:01:42] neighbor did hear his sheep David sent
[1:01:44] out 10 young men and David said unto the
[1:01:47] young man so let me make the long story
[1:01:48] short because of my time here this
[1:01:49] morning and you promised to hold on
[1:01:53] so he sends his man ten men and he's
[1:01:57] going to ask respectfully ask this man
[1:01:59] enabled send a message to him you guys
[1:02:01] are are you guys are got food here and
[1:02:04] uh you're shearing the sheep and you got
[1:02:06] different things so can we borrow some
[1:02:08] of this as we go through respectfully
[1:02:10] and we're not going to do anything we're
[1:02:11] coming through we mean War everywhere
[1:02:13] but we're going to come through we will
[1:02:15] leave your men alone we'll be respectful
[1:02:16] to it so here's here's the the rude guys
[1:02:19] response to David verse 9 and when
[1:02:22] David's young men came and they spake
[1:02:24] the neighbor according to all the words
[1:02:25] in the name of David and cease because
[1:02:27] he said go to them in my name and
[1:02:29] David's thinking this guy's going to
[1:02:31] have respect for his name tell him this
[1:02:33] is in my name I'm the son of Jesse
[1:02:36] I I'm this that the other I'm set to be
[1:02:39] king just throw that in
[1:02:45] you guys are not just on your own you're
[1:02:46] coming in my name it's kind of like the
[1:02:48] Christian we come in his name
[1:02:50] and so he goes and when the young young
[1:02:53] David's young men came they speak the
[1:02:54] neighbor according to those words in the
[1:02:55] name of David and ceased and nabo
[1:02:58] answered David's servants and said
[1:03:02] who
[1:03:04] is David
[1:03:06] he's not even on my
[1:03:10] radar
[1:03:12] list
[1:03:14] who is David and I'm sure he's heard of
[1:03:17] him but he's rude and he don't care who
[1:03:19] David is and he says who is David and
[1:03:22] because they said we come in the name of
[1:03:24] David the son of Jesse
[1:03:27] who is David and also who is Jesse they
[1:03:32] mean squat to me
[1:03:36] this guy's rude
[1:03:39] your name your boss means squat to me
[1:03:45] who's this guy there'd be many servants
[1:03:47] nowadays that break away every man from
[1:03:49] his master there's a lot of people in
[1:03:51] this world but I've heard maybe heard
[1:03:53] but who's David to me that's really what
[1:03:55] he's saying who's David to me so this
[1:03:57] guy's rude and so shall not shy then
[1:03:59] take my bread and my water and my flesh
[1:04:01] that I've killed for my shears and give
[1:04:03] it unto men whom I know not whence they
[1:04:05] be so David's young men turned their way
[1:04:07] and went again and came and told him all
[1:04:09] those sayings next step and David said
[1:04:12] unto his men gerd ye on every man his
[1:04:15] sword and they girded on every man his
[1:04:17] sword and David also guarded on his
[1:04:20] sword and there went up after David
[1:04:22] about
[1:04:23] 400 men and 200 Abode by the stuff I'll
[1:04:27] leave 200 but this guy's disrespected me
[1:04:31] this is a Rude Dude
[1:04:38] and I'm going up with just his little
[1:04:41] kingdom there I'm going up with 400
[1:04:44] sordid guys
[1:04:46] now we know David's the type of Christ
[1:04:48] but guess what
[1:04:51] this ain't that part
[1:04:55] I say that part
[1:04:57] and there's some other things in David's
[1:04:58] Life That's The Human Side and that's
[1:05:01] the type of Christ
[1:05:02] and it only takes a revelation to see
[1:05:04] when Christ is coming out you're going
[1:05:06] to see it in a minute when Christ is
[1:05:07] coming out and when David's coming out
[1:05:09] and guess what his this guy's rudeness
[1:05:13] David is reacting to his rudeness with
[1:05:16] the same rudeness
[1:05:18] in our original scripture says we don't
[1:05:20] fight evil with evil we don't fight
[1:05:22] argument with argument
[1:05:25] we don't fight back with the same thing
[1:05:27] somebody's fighting with us with there
[1:05:29] has to be something comes from the
[1:05:30] depths of our heart to say Lord let me
[1:05:31] stop let me settle down here because it
[1:05:34] never works you're never going to win
[1:05:36] when it's all a spirit of argument let
[1:05:38] me stop right here let me respond in the
[1:05:40] right way let me wait let whatever and
[1:05:43] David did not do that he said this guy's
[1:05:46] rude he's churlish he's he's
[1:05:49] disrespectful to me and my name and
[1:05:52] everything God's called me to do get
[1:05:54] your swords I'm getting mine and we're
[1:05:56] going to show him later on he says in
[1:05:58] the scripture there won't be one animal
[1:06:00] left in his entire Kingdom not it no
[1:06:03] there won't be one scratch of anything
[1:06:04] of nabel left
[1:06:07] it's a bit rude
[1:06:12] you can't respond
[1:06:15] when somebody's rude to you
[1:06:17] with more rudeness or vengeance
[1:06:20] I'm going to get back to them they don't
[1:06:22] know who I am
[1:06:24] can't do it
[1:06:25] so to make a long story
[1:06:28] longer
[1:06:32] the men come back to Abigail's wife and
[1:06:34] says he's coming for you he's coming for
[1:06:36] the whole thing Abigail gets some food
[1:06:39] together and she comes and Bows before
[1:06:42] David pleads her husband's case
[1:06:45] she actually enters into she's she's
[1:06:48] actually going to absorb
[1:06:51] the iniquity of her husband that's
[1:06:55] another sermon altogether
[1:06:57] but I'm telling you you even find the
[1:06:59] Life of Christ in Abigail doing that
[1:07:05] you know first you can ask your question
[1:07:07] why'd she ever marry
[1:07:10] this Rude Dude
[1:07:12] she knows him better than David
[1:07:13] obviously she's lived with them how she
[1:07:16] ever married this guy I'll never know
[1:07:17] and girls pay attention
[1:07:20] young girls single girls pay attention
[1:07:25] I don't know how she married it she
[1:07:27] didn't know he's churlished before
[1:07:31] she didn't sit down and pray and God
[1:07:32] show her don't marry him he's churlish
[1:07:37] is that what the word is am I saying it
[1:07:39] wrong people are looking at me funny
[1:07:43] yeah churlish
[1:07:45] I don't know why she even why she did
[1:07:47] this but she comes She lays before and
[1:07:49] said
[1:07:50] let my verse 25 let not my Lord I pray
[1:07:52] thee regard this man of Baal Belial
[1:07:56] um the man of Belial
[1:07:59] uh
[1:08:00] I don't have that written down but the
[1:08:03] sons of Belial and the man of Bilal
[1:08:05] she's not calling him nabel she's saying
[1:08:07] he's a son of emptiness and wickedness
[1:08:09] and worthless there's a generation that
[1:08:11] he called the Sons of Bilal they're just
[1:08:14] they don't have anything good within
[1:08:16] them
[1:08:17] and I married a son of Belial
[1:08:21] even nabel for as his name is so is he
[1:08:24] oh well that's interesting somebody
[1:08:26] needs to underline that because that's
[1:08:28] what that's what brother Branham taught
[1:08:30] us that your name means something
[1:08:34] has an attachment to it your name means
[1:08:37] something uh name enables his name and
[1:08:40] Folly is with him that's what his name
[1:08:42] means but I iodine handmade saw not the
[1:08:45] young man my Lord whom thou descend now
[1:08:47] therefore my Lord as the Lord liveth and
[1:08:49] as I so liveth seeing the Lord hath with
[1:08:51] those withhold me from coming to shed
[1:08:52] blood and from avenging thyself with my
[1:08:54] own hand now let thine let now let thine
[1:08:57] enemies and they that seek evil to my
[1:09:00] Lord be as Naval and now this blessing
[1:09:02] which thine handmaid hath brought unto
[1:09:04] my Lord let it even be given unto the
[1:09:06] young men that follow my Lord here you
[1:09:08] go and she's standing in the Gap I pray
[1:09:11] thee forgive the trespass of thine
[1:09:12] handmaid it's not her trespass
[1:09:16] it's his she's absorbing it
[1:09:19] for the Lord will certainly make my Lord
[1:09:20] a sure house
[1:09:22] because my Lord fighteth the battles of
[1:09:24] the Lord and evil hath not been found in
[1:09:26] the holidays do you realize what this
[1:09:28] woman was doing I'm closing I know where
[1:09:29] I'm at
[1:09:31] I want you to notice something don't
[1:09:32] miss this okay
[1:09:34] it's this bride this woman here that has
[1:09:37] caught a revelation
[1:09:38] of David's position when he forgot it
[1:09:44] he's forgot his position because he's
[1:09:47] called to become King David and he's
[1:09:49] called her the right thing and she even
[1:09:51] says they're not bound there have not
[1:09:53] been evil found in the all the days if
[1:09:55] he goes and does this there's going to
[1:09:57] be evil he's going to wipe out a guy
[1:09:58] just because he was rude to him
[1:10:00] that's not acting like King David that's
[1:10:03] not what his calling is and she is used
[1:10:06] to remind
[1:10:08] David
[1:10:09] hey
[1:10:11] my husband's like this
[1:10:13] this isn't you
[1:10:17] can I say to you this morning as a
[1:10:19] minister of the Gospel
[1:10:21] if you're sitting here hungry for the
[1:10:22] word hungry for the Holy Ghost you may
[1:10:25] act out of place sometimes
[1:10:27] but if you have a desire for God
[1:10:31] if you act out of place
[1:10:33] that's not you
[1:10:36] or I should say that's not who you're
[1:10:38] meant to be
[1:10:40] that's not your calling
[1:10:43] so this scripture shows they are sons of
[1:10:45] Belial who will always be rude and die
[1:10:48] rude
[1:10:49] and we leave it up to them how God
[1:10:51] judges them on the day of judgment
[1:10:54] but there's some predestinated people
[1:10:57] like David who are meant for the throne
[1:11:00] I believe I'm preaching to some here
[1:11:02] this morning
[1:11:03] and you have to be reminded
[1:11:05] when you make a mistake repent of it
[1:11:08] make it right but don't ever let the
[1:11:11] devil tell you that that's completely
[1:11:13] you
[1:11:15] said David I got to read the next
[1:11:17] scripture David
[1:11:21] yes
[1:11:23] a man yet a man is risen to pursue thee
[1:11:26] verse 29 and to seek thy soul
[1:11:31] but the soul of my Lord shall be bound
[1:11:34] in the bundle of life
[1:11:38] and that is actually the bundle of Love
[1:11:40] Your Soul
[1:11:42] this is incredible
[1:11:44] she's pointing out what's in his soul
[1:11:47] and she's saying this isn't in the soul
[1:11:49] of my husband but this is what's in your
[1:11:52] soul is different than what's in my
[1:11:53] husband's Soul you're acting out of
[1:11:55] place yet a man rise to pursue and to
[1:11:58] seek thy soul but the soul of my Lord
[1:12:00] shall be bound in the bundle of love
[1:12:02] with the Lord thy God and The Souls of
[1:12:04] thine enemies them shall he sling out is
[1:12:06] out of she's separating that there's
[1:12:08] something different in The Souls of men
[1:12:10] and the ones that have the souls that
[1:12:12] are predestinated seeds they may act in
[1:12:15] the flesh sometimes but they don't have
[1:12:17] that in their soul they have another
[1:12:20] calling they're destined for the throne
[1:12:22] can you say Amen and when he acted out
[1:12:24] of place it was going with 400 men to
[1:12:26] destroy Naval that wasn't acting the way
[1:12:29] he should act a woman corrected him and
[1:12:31] caught the Revelation and reminded him
[1:12:32] David this isn't you repent of this
[1:12:35] don't do this turn around and guess what
[1:12:37] he listened to her because he knew what
[1:12:40] she was saying is the truth David this
[1:12:42] isn't you
[1:12:43] you haven't done this don't start doing
[1:12:46] this
[1:12:48] aren't you glad for the grace of God
[1:12:51] that comes in services and speaks to the
[1:12:53] road and you could be filled as defeated
[1:12:56] as you can feel and yet he loves you to
[1:12:58] come and tell you that's not you you're
[1:13:01] a son and daughter of God
[1:13:06] that's not in your soul that's not what
[1:13:09] you're meant to be that's not your
[1:13:11] calling stop living like another man
[1:13:14] stop living like another woman and
[1:13:16] submit your life to what your purpose is
[1:13:18] in life that my purpose is not to be
[1:13:21] another statistic my purpose is not to
[1:13:24] be rude like the rest of the world my
[1:13:25] purpose is to react with Christ the
[1:13:28] image in my life to every situation
[1:13:31] perfect Faith Masters every circumstance
[1:13:34] Let It Be Lord that my life expresses
[1:13:37] them the only thing that comes out of
[1:13:39] this vessel is divine love in every
[1:13:42] situation in every bit of rudeness in
[1:13:44] everything that I've dished out in life
[1:13:46] let it be
[1:13:49] expressed
[1:13:52] let's stand together let's Worship the
[1:13:54] Lord give him a hand this morning that
[1:13:56] he chose you
[1:13:58] [Applause]
[1:14:01] it's what's in your soul
[1:14:03] it's your desires can you say Amen
[1:14:06] try to be good to one another try to
[1:14:08] shake hands and be friendly and nice

[1:14:34] is let me be wrapped in a bundle of love

[1:14:39] that's the making of God what did he say
[1:14:41] about little old David when he was up

[1:15:27] he first loved me there's only one way
[1:15:29] to express Divine love of God when you
[1:15:31] have a revelation how much he loves you
[1:15:33] he loved you before the foundation of
[1:15:34] the world you weren't even born yet and
[1:15:37] Christ died because he loves you went to
[1:15:39] Calvary for you

[1:15:42] has given your life and when it begins
[1:15:44] to Dawn on you and come on you by
[1:15:46] Revelation you don't have a problem
[1:15:48] loving the next person you don't have a
